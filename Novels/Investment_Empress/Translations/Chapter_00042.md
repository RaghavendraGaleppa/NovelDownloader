**Chapter 42: Choosing a Weapon in the Divine Edge Cave, Re-engaging Chixiao**

Outside the carriage window, the beautiful scenery of the Qingyuan Mountain Range receded.

"Guess I can call myself a swordsman now," Li Mo thought. "From Great Completion to the Empyrean Realm... eighty years." His initial joy from his newfound skill had subsided somewhat, and he began to wonder if the expenditure was too high. All in all, he had spent over a hundred years of martial dao enlightenment on sword arts. If it weren't for "Ice Block" teaching him personally, he would have spent even more. It felt somewhat like buying a high-end computer with two months' salary in his previous life, only for it to gather dust, unused due to lack of time.

Well, not quite that bad. Empyrean Realm swordplay was definitely much more powerful than simply smashing things with his fists.

"My martial dao enlightenment should be sufficient for now," he mused. "With a hundred and ten years remaining, I won't be caught unprepared if I acquire new martial arts." Li Mo pondered for a moment, then decided not to dwell on it further.

"When you enter the Divine Edge Cave, you might want to look at the Chixiao," Ying Bing said, gently sipping her tea.

"Alright," Li Mo readily agreed. In fact, he was indeed planning to try out the Chixiao Sword. It wasn't that he held a grudge, wanting a "thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river" scenario simply because he'd been "beaten up" by a sword. The Chixiao's attribute was fire, and when paired with the Fire Lotus Heart Art, its power would double, making it extremely suitable for him. This amplification might not be very obvious in the Blood Qi Realm, but once he reached the Inner Breath Realm, it would definitely be clearly visible.

At this moment, outside the window, the sounds of metal being hammered could already be heard. Stepping out of the carriage, they saw a bustling crowd in front of the Divine Edge Cave. The moment Ying Bing descended, the chatter in the area quieted considerably, and gazes of awe turned towards her. The oppressive aura of "Ice Block." She was now not only a true disciple of the Sect Master but also the future of the sect. Not just among her peers, but in the entire history of the Qingyuan Sect, she was uniquely brilliant.

"Brother Li!"
"Junior Brother Li!"

From the crowd, two people called out greetings simultaneously, then exchanged surprised glances. Murong Xiao and Xiao Qin looked at each other and nodded slightly. They had both achieved good results in the sect trials, having met each other once before.

"Brother Li, you actually took first place! As expected of you," Murong Xiao praised him.

"I was also quite surprised when I found out," Xiao Qin added. His aura was much stronger than before. Having passed the trials, he had now returned to the Inner Sect. To his surprise, Junior Brother Li's aura was now distinctly stronger than his own. He had essentially dispersed his cultivation and re-cultivated, with the aid of his master. Junior Brother Li's progress was truly astonishing.

"What kind of weapon is Junior Brother Li planning to choose today?" Xiao Qin asked.

"My sword arts have recently made some minor advancements," Li Mo replied.

"Hmm, it shouldn't be a problem for Junior Brother Li to obtain a renowned artifact," Murong Xiao commented.

"This is where Brother Xiao doesn't quite understand Brother Li..."

After some pleasantries, the two mostly spoke of their recent developments. Murong Xiao had initially achieved Body Tempering success, fulfilling Elder Hancrane's expectations, and could now begin learning the forging techniques passed down through the Divine Armament Peak lineage. As for Xiao Qin, he had not only returned to the Inner Sect but had even caught the eye of an Elder, with the potential to be taken as a true disciple in the future. Everyone had a bright future ahead. Seeing the people he had "invested" in now thriving, Li Mo couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment.

*Clang, clang, clang—*

Suddenly, a gong sounded at the entrance of the Divine Edge Cave. The Inner Sect Deacon guarding the cave entrance stepped out. "Time's up!"

Every year, the Divine Edge Cave would briefly calm down, only to erupt even more fiercely afterward. Disciples whose cultivation realm wasn't high would typically choose this time to enter the cave and select a weapon. The disciples instinctively cleared a path. Ying Bing lowered her gaze and walked into the Divine Edge Cave. However, she stopped once she reached the middle of the first layer, gently raising her pristine hand.

Just as everyone was bewildered, *Zheng—*

Sword hums rang out, and over a dozen gleaming white streaks of sword light flew through the air, hovering before Ying Bing, allowing her to choose. All of them were longswords of the renowned artifact grade.

"Emmmmm..." How should he put it? Li Mo watched, feeling a sense of déjà vu, like someone with a cat-attracting physique entering a cat cafe. He wasn't particularly surprised, however. He remained calm, but the others were far from it; gasps of astonishment erupted all at once.

"Renowned artifacts, all of them renowned artifacts!"
"Damn, it's one thing to gain the recognition of renowned artifacts, but for them all to fly out from the third layer, just waiting to be chosen?"
"Didn't they say renowned artifacts possess spirits and are aloof? Ordinary people can't even get them to spare a glance, so why are they all gathering today?"
"This is too terrifying..."
"Wait, look, what's that?"

As discussions buzzed around, another two streaks of light, one blue and one white, shot forth, causing the other renowned artifact longswords along their path to move aside. One radiated scorching heat, dispelling the air; the other was cold as ice.

To Li Mo, they were both old acquaintances: Chixiao and Tianshuang.
