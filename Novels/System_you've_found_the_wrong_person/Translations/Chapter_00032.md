# Chapter 32: Blood Oath of Brotherhood (4000 words)

Mount Sanyang was an ancient and renowned mountain where a sage once preached, enlightening three disciples whom he named Qingyang, Hongyang, and Ziyang. This once-nameless mountain gained its title from this event, and over time, it became a gathering place for scholars and poets, its fame growing with each passing day.

Three hundred years ago, a martial artist who called himself the Patriarch of Sanyang emerged, overthrowing temples and sects to claim Mount Sanyang as his own. After a century of upheaval, the Sanyang Sect established itself firmly and has endured to this day.

The mountain's scenery was breathtaking, with three peaks rising abruptly as if they had been placed there by human hands rather than formed naturally. Dou Changsheng ascended the stone steps step by step until he reached the summit of Qingyang Peak.

From afar, he could see a spring at the center of a white marble railing. The spring water flowed gently, its refreshing aura palpable even from a distance, causing the innate qi within his body to circulate faster. Practicing martial arts near this Qingyang Spring would yield results 10-20% faster than elsewhere—a decade of cultivation here would equal twelve years elsewhere. And this was without even drinking the spring water, which would further enhance the effects.

This single spring was enough to serve as the foundation of the Sanyang Sect, ensuring its prosperity for generations. The absence of martial artists practicing nearby suggested the sect had devised a method to concentrate the spring's energy in secluded chambers for even greater benefits.

It was truly a treasure.

This was the kind of advantage that set sect and noble family disciples apart from wandering cultivators.

A Daoist clad in purple robes approached with a warm smile. "This humble Daoist is Ziyang. Since Young Hero Dou has arrived at Mount Sanyang, I shall be responsible for your accommodations and needs. If you have any requests, feel free to speak with me directly."

Despite Ziyang's enthusiasm, Dou Changsheng remained wary. This man had already pledged allegiance to Chen Qingyao, the Grand Chancellor of the Great Jin Dynasty. Three years from now, he would personally ambush the future Dou Changsheng, forcing him to unleash a hidden trump card to slay him in a single strike. To the present Dou Changsheng, Ziyang was a formidable foe.

The pinnacle of the Xiantian Profound Realm—where three flowers gathered atop the head and five qi returned to their origins—was the final stage of the three Xiantian realms. Ziyang had reached the limit of this realm, just one step away from breaking through to become a Divine Marvel Grandmaster. But that step was as vast as an abyss—success meant soaring to the heavens, while failure meant remaining mired in mediocrity.

"I only need a simple guest room and light meals," Dou Changsheng replied calmly.

Ziyang chuckled. "Though the Sanyang Sect is not a major sect, we do have a Divine Marvel Grandmaster and can be considered a prominent school. How could we mistreat our honored guest? The finest accommodations have already been prepared for you. A banquet is ready, and heroes from all walks of life await your presence."

Ziyang personally led Dou Changsheng to a grand hall. At its center stood a main table, flanked by two slightly smaller ones. Rows of tables lined both sides, adorned with exquisite porcelain plates bearing fruits, dishes, and delicate wine jugs. Most seats were already occupied, with only the central seat reserved for the sect leader, Qingyang, remaining empty.

Ziyang took his place at the right side of the main table, while a red-robed Daoist sat to the left, eyes closed as if in meditation. Dou Changsheng was directed to a seat of honor, second only to the three hosts. The weight of numerous gazes fell upon him—some curious, some hostile, others resentful.

The hostility came from across the table, where a man with a long blade resting before him sat. This could only be the Mad Blade, Lin Daoqi. At twenty-seven, Lin appeared more like a burly man in his thirties or forties, with a thick beard and large, ox-like eyes. A member of the prestigious Lin Clan of the capital, he was renowned for his "Thirteen Winds and Clouds Blade Technique." The current Lin Clan patriarch, known as the Tyrant Blade, was an Earth Ranking Grandmaster.

Lin's presence here was no accident—his clan specialized in blade techniques, and any member who strayed from this path faced ostracism.

As Dou Changsheng took his seat, Qingyang finally arrived, timing his entrance perfectly. Stroking his goatee, the sect leader spoke warmly, "You are all outstanding talents of the Great Jin, destined to compete with heroes from other nations and bring glory to our country. A place on the Human Ranking awaits you. This gathering is a rare opportunity—who knows when we might meet again? Thus, before the sword competition, we host this Hero's Banquet."

Before Qingyang could finish, Lin Daoqi slammed the sheath of his blade against the table with a sharp crack, drawing all eyes to him. "My hand slipped," Lin said with a grin. "Forgive me, Elder."

Qingyang's gaze turned piercing as he stared at Lin for a long moment. Lin met his gaze unflinchingly, his large eyes fully open. Only when Ziyang tugged at Qingyang's sleeve did the sect leader relent. "Be more careful," Ziyang warned.

Lin smirked. "There won't be a next time."

The incident was brushed aside, but Dou Changsheng noted how meekly the Sanyang Sect had yielded. Qingyang, a Divine Marvel Grandmaster, had backed down before a mere Xiantai True Realm warrior. Lin Daoqi had reached the pinnacle of the Five Qi Returning to Origin stage, with one of his three flowers already condensed. Coupled with his mastery of supreme techniques, he was strong enough to challenge the Human Ranking—not as a bottom-tier contender but as one capable of breaking into the top hundred.

Qingyang, having lost his appetite for conversation, raised his wine cup. "To all of you!" After a perfunctory sip, he excused himself and left, clearly slighted by Lin's audacity.

With the sect leader gone, the atmosphere quickly grew lively. The gathered heroes treated Qingyang's departure with indifference, as if he were no more significant than an ordinary Xiantai warrior.

Dou Changsheng found this puzzling but decided to inquire about it later from Tang Qingyan.

A man in snow-white robes with flowing hair and striking features—Chen Weiquan, one of the Capital's Ten Elite—leaned over. "Don't mind it. The meek are often bullied. Sect Leader Qingyang cares too much about the Sanyang Sect, so others take advantage. But they only dare to slight his pride—no one would cross the line with a Divine Marvel Grandmaster. Even a cornered rabbit bites, and who wouldn't fear a furious grandmaster?"

His words seemed contradictory, and Dou Changsheng sensed something amiss.

"Feels fishy, doesn't it?" Chen said, drinking deeply. "We all think so. This isn't just about humbling Qingyang—it's a test."

He lowered his voice. "The military payroll was stolen near Mount Sanyang, shocking the nation. The amount was staggering—not just silver, but equipment for three thousand Mystic Armor Cavalry. Full-body armor, horse armor, battle banners... With these, three thousand cavalry could crush tens of thousands of elite infantry. The court spared no expense to assemble this force, aiming to bolster the northern defenses. Now, with most of the empire's fifteen thousand Mystic Armor Cavalry stationed in the north, everyone from the emperor down is terrified. If three thousand suddenly appeared outside the capital, a bloody coup would be inevitable."

"Qingyang's submissiveness is an act—a show of harmlessness to distance himself from the theft."

Chen's blunt revelation laid bare what everyone knew but dared not voice. The stolen silver was secondary—it could eventually be recovered. The true crisis was the missing armor. If it fell into the hands of rival nations like Western Qin, Eastern Qi, or Southern Chen, disaster would follow.

The Mystic Armor Cavalry was the Great Jin's elite force, instrumental in past victories. While armor had been stolen before, the battle banners and formation disks—critical to their tactics—had never been lost until now.

Chen's gaze sharpened as he turned to Dou Changsheng. "You're bold to come here at such a time. No—not bold. Righteous. You're from Xiangzhou, yet you risk yourself for northerners you've never met. I admire that."

He raised his cup in salute. "Lin Daoqi dislikes you because of your families' feud. But even he respects your character, or he'd have challenged you already. I'm called one of the Capital's Ten Elite, but it's only due to my family's influence. I've never accomplished anything meaningful. Compared to you, I'm but a firefly to the sun."

After another drink, Chen continued, "I came for the Qingyang Spring—my Seven Injuries Fist is one step from mastery. If not for that, I'd wait another year. But I'm running out of time to make my mark on the Human Ranking. Part of me wants to uncover the truth about the theft, but I've been too afraid to get involved. Seeing you here has steeled my resolve. Life is short—why hesitate? A true man should strive for greatness, even if it means a glorious death rather than a feeble one in bed. I'll help you investigate. My connections in the capital will be useful, and if needed, I can summon imperial reinforcements."

A loud slap interrupted them. Lin Daoqi stood, his massive frame looming over the table. "Such a venture can't proceed without me!" he boomed. "This theft has thrown the north into chaos, imprisoned our general, and shaken the empire. If we don't act, the barbarians and Southern Chen will invade. For our nation and for justice, let us unite! Here on Qingyang Peak, we swear a blood oath—brothers in life and death, until this case is solved!"
