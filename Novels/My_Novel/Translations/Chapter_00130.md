# Chapter 130: The Power of the Dual Pupils and the Secret Glimpse

The dual pupils possessed a terrifying aspect that struck fear into the hearts of men.

Li Xian already possessed extraordinary handsomeness, highlighted by the vertical mole between his eyebrows. Now, with the addition of the dual pupils, his aura became even more imposing and domineering. Anyone who saw this strange yet majestic appearance would surely be taken aback.

It was no different from an immortal descending to the mortal realm.

The Qi Lake grew rapidly, its waves surging, having already reached a height of over ten zhang.

His physical strength surged, feeling as though he could tear tigers and leopards apart with his bare hands or capture dragons.

Li Xian breathed deeply, sensing the changes within his body. The itching in his eyes had stopped, and the flow of time seemed to slow down.

He was doing a handstand, causing the world in his eyes to flip upside down. A more exquisite scroll of all things unfolded before his eyes.

Mosquitoes in the distance, dirt on the grass, the vibration of cicadas singing on tree trunks, the patterns on their wings, the veins of the leaves...

Countless details were presented clearly in his vision.

Looking into the distance, he could see further and wider. The night was like a black silk curtain, yet it could not obscure his sight.

He could see the distant mountain peaks, and through the gaps in the trees, he could see the flowing stream and the deer and beasts drinking in the forest.

His eyesight was terrifying!

These details were usually visible, but limited by the strength of his vision, he could see them but not perceive them clearly, missing out on much of the joy.

"Hm?"

Li Xian suddenly felt the courtyard wall becoming transparent. Focusing his attention, he channeled his internal Qi into his eyes, and his vision actually pierced through the wall.

He saw into the distant courtyard, where two guards were slacking off, sitting on stone stools and chatting.

Li Xian shifted his angle.

He looked toward the Xiadan Pavilion, hoping to偷看 (steal a glance) at the art of alchemy.

However, he first saw a scene of spring light fully revealed, beautiful beyond words, as refreshing as bathing in spring water.

"Does alchemy require undressing? Madam is truly a famous beauty of the martial world. Such a figure, such..." Li Xian rubbed his chin, looking on with great interest.

Li Xian was not a strictly honest man. With the wisdom of two lifetimes, though he adhered to his principles, he was gradually adapting to the rules of this world.

Moreover, heroes struggle to pass the test of beauty; it is in the nature of men. Li Xian had a resilient heart and prided himself on passing the test of beauty, but he would not deny that he appreciated beauty.

The Madam took light steps, her posture elegant, her skin like congealed fat. However, illuminated by the firelight, it added a faint red glow.

She was observing the contents of the furnace.

Under the intense fire, various medicinal herbs fused together, gradually taking the shape of a pill.

The situation was excellent, and the pill was almost formed. Her mood improved greatly. Madam Wen thought, "If this pill is successful, my strength will advance another step. At the Dragon Banquet, I will have an additional bargaining chip."

Suddenly, she felt something amiss in her heart, and her smile vanished instantly. Her willow-like brows furrowed.

She flipped her hand, summoning a transparent silk robe back into her hand, and turned to put it on.

However, this clothing was not designed for modesty.

It offered no coverage at all, instead adding a hazy beauty.

The Madam's expression turned ugly, her eyes filled with suspicion. The feeling was still there. She shouted coldly, "Which scoundrel is there? Do you have a death wish?"

A moment later, the Madam's anger subsided, replaced by confusion. The alchemy pavilion was airtight, with no windows or other openings.

Where was this peeping gaze coming from? Was it an illusion? And with her strength, if someone with ill intentions were nearby, how could she avoid her perception?

Li Xian was secretly surprised, knowing the Madam had sharp senses and had detected someone peeping. This "X-ray" vision was wonderful, but he dared not abuse it in front of others.

Another breath passed.

His eyes grew fatigued, bloodshot, and he had no choice but to close them and rest for half an hour.

The next day.

Early morning.

Li Xian sat cross-legged. When he opened his eyes, the strange aspect of his eyes had faded. But his eyes were deeper, hiding a sharp light within.

After a night of contemplation.

The [Dual Pupil Aspect] was truly extraordinary. It possessed the power to scare away dragons and tigers, rivaled the strength of dragons and elephants, and possessed the ability to see through the finest details.

Li Xian possessed two aspects in one body, which was already world-shocking and unbelievable. The red mole on his forehead was conspicuous, easily noticed by others at a glance.

This strange eye could be kept as a hidden card.

Furthermore, the Dual Pupil naturally carried a deterrent force. Once opened, the imposing aura was too terrifying.

To prevent theft, the manor raised dozens of wolves and dogs, kept near the West Courtyard. When Li Xian swept his gaze over them with his Dual Pupils, the dogs all fell silent, wetting themselves and howling in misery.

This showed just how powerful the aspect was.

The Food Pavilion.

"Commander, it seems... you have changed again?"

At noon, after the guards finished their patrol, Li Xian and Ding Hu were eating in the Food Pavilion.

The Food Pavilion served simple dishes, lacking the color and aroma of the city's taverns. But the ingredients were not bad, and the meat soups and vegetable portions were very generous.

The Grade A meal was the highest standard at the Food Pavilion, offering beef and mutton, and occasionally some body-strengthening medicinal meals.

Ding Hu looked at Li Xian, his heart pounding, feeling a mix of fear and respect unconsciously.

Li Xian said calmly, "It's an illusion."

Ding Hu said, "Commander Li, last time you showed your divine might, not only in our manor, but even in Qingning County, your reputation has soared."

"Is that so?" Li Xian didn't care much.

Ding Hu reminded him, "Commander Li, the weather is good today. The manor's Armory should be cleaned and maintained."

"The Armory?" Li Xian was confused.

Ding Hu said, "You are young and have exceptional martial arts, but you haven't been here long, so you don't know some things. When Commander Pang was here, every few years, he would take out the equipment from the Armory, wash it with spring water, and dry it in the sun."

"The Armory is where we select our weapons. All our sabers, spears, swords, and staves come from there. But you probably haven't been there. That narrow saber of yours was directly passed down from the previous guard."

"I keep hearing people in the city panicking, saying something about the Yellow Dragon Army coming. I thought we should take some precautions, let the iron tools see the light, and have everyone practice a bit."

"If they really attack, we won't be caught unprepared. Commander Li, what do you think..."

Li Xian thought to himself upon hearing this: "I started as a laborer and rose to become Commander. My weapon is just a narrow saber. I really didn't know there was an Armory. This Ding Hu is indeed useful."

Li Xian always showed one hand, kept one hidden, and concealed two. Although the matter of the Yellow Dragon Army was not yet certain, he had already taken preventive measures.

He patted Ding Hu on the shoulder and praised, "You reminded me very well. It's still early, and there is still more than an hour before the afternoon patrol."

"Go gather everyone and lead the way to the Armory!"

Ding Hu accepted the order. He secretly thought that Commander Li was decisive and efficient, never delaying. Since he took office, the sycophantic风气 among the guards had changed significantly, which was a good thing.

It didn't take long.

Everyone was gathered. Li Xian didn't know the location of the Armory, so Ding Hu led the way.

The manor was vast. It contained mountains, forests, and lakes. Deep in a forest, a small house covered in vines came into view.

The plaque read "Armory," but due to lack of maintenance, the characters were severely damaged.

"I heard Commander Pang say that when the Madam first arrived to establish the manor, she wanted to live quietly and improve her martial arts. But the local snakehead forces were not convinced. Seeing the Madam occupying such a vast area, they even wanted to seize it by force."

"Commander Pang stood up for the Madam and dealt with them. After several battles, Commander Pang won a great victory. Many of the weapons were spoils of war from that time."

"除此之外，这些年来，陆续有些江湖高手，欲要探究一合庄。有些被庞统领拦下，有的被夫人解决。这些人的古怪武器，也充入武库当中。”

Ding Hu said.

He pushed the door open.

A chilling aura hit them, and the room was pitch black. Ding Hu lit a fire stick to light the oil lamps in the room. But because the Yin and evil energy inside was too thick, it went out as soon as it entered.

After several attempts, he barely managed to light the three oil lamps in the room.

Looking around, sabers, spears, swords, and staves were the most common, seen everywhere. In addition, large iron shields, meteor hammers, tridents... and other weapons made Li Xian feel refreshed.

The guards worked together to move the weapons to a spacious open area.

They washed them with well water and dried them in the sun.

Some people, feeling playful, tried to swing them a few times. The sound of whistling wind rang out from time to time.

Li Xian looked around curiously, his gaze falling on a stone sword.

"Commander Li, this stone sword was once wielded by a martial expert. It is a heavy sword without an edge. With a light swing, it can shatter stone and startle the heavens."

"It takes four or five of us guards to barely lift it."

Ding Hu explained.

"Is that so?"

Li Xian held the hilt and applied a little force, easily lifting it from the rack. He swung it casually a couple of times, stirring up a dull wind sound.

If it hit a person, light injuries would mean broken bones and rotten flesh, half a life gone. Heavy injuries would mean being cut in half and dying instantly.

"It's not that heavy," Li Xian said, tossing it lightly and catching it again, treating the stone sword like a toy.

Ding Hu was dumbfounded, his jaw dropping. He had carried this sword before, and he did it with Pang Long. They walked three miles and were exhausted to the core.

His whole body ached, and it took more than half a month to recover.

After coming to his senses, he gave a thumbs up, his heart filled with admiration.

Commander Li is not an ordinary person!

"There are really many good tools here. That stone sword just now is quite good, very handy to use."

"Commander Pang was not wrong in one thing. Martial artists should try various martial arts to accumulate their own experience. Finally, choose a path they are good at and study it deeply."

"And the broader your knowledge, the more composed you will be when facing the enemy. Only by combining the strengths of many schools can one become a great master."

"I might as well take this opportunity to choose a weapon and practice a martial art. Change my equipment."

His gaze fell on a long spear.

This spear emitted a silver light, its cold gleam piercing the eyes, and it felt cool to the touch. The tail of the spear was shaped like a ball, containing a spear pill.

When the spear was swung, the spear pill bounced around, making noise. The strange sound disturbed the mind. Even Li Xian, who was wielding the spear, was affected and felt annoyed.

"Commander Li, this is the Spitting Bell Spear. We never move it. The bell at the back of the spear rings as soon as it moves, and it rings, it annoys the heart. There was a guard who, after hearing the bell too much, went bershot, his internal Qi ran wild, and he died a few days later."

Ding Hu covered his ears and hurriedly advised.

Li Xian let out a soft "oh" and put the spear back in its place. "This spear was probably specially forged by a martial expert based on their own martial arts. That person must have been quite strong, but if they offended the Madam, they probably didn't survive."

The Madam's fierce reputation added another layer.

Li Xian's narrow saber was blunt.

He took this opportunity to change his weapon. Although there were many weapons here, they were also messy and disorganized.

After a good selection, he finally found a suitable weapon.

It was a long saber. The blade was thin and long, with a single edge. The body was black, seemingly made from black obsidian and refined steel.

The material was far superior to the guard's narrow saber.

He tried swinging it a couple of times, using the Great Luo Saber Technique. The power increased significantly between openings and closings, and the weight was just right.

He put it away.

Li Xian was in a good mood. Now his whole body felt renewed. He had learned good martial arts, washed his new aspect, and changed his new weapon.

His strength, situation, and future... were completely different.

"Having said that, everything I have obtained was bestowed by the Madam. If the Madam wants to take it back, it would take only a word. I still need to work hard. One day, relying on myself, I will fight for a new world."

"By then... I can also be famous throughout the world, have a reputation in the martial world, and be able to protect a region. Open a manor and establish a sect... Of course, if I could also have beauties in my arms, that would be even better."

Li Xian thought of that scene and couldn't help but look forward to it. Filled with motivation, he returned to the courtyard to practice martial arts diligently.
