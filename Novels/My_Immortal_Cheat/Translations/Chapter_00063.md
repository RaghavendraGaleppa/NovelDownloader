## Chapter 63: The Victor!

Old man Li Lingyi’s face was as dark as the bottom of a pot. Zi Qing and Tie Niu were both outstanding talents of Daluo Academy's current generation, not ordinary individuals, yet they failed to even break into the top ten and were completely suppressed and defeated by the Banished Immortal right here. How could he possibly be happy?

"Scholar Li, look on the bright side. How many among your peers can contend with the Banished Immortal for so long?" Zhou Tian consoled Li Lingyi with a patronizing air, completely relegating Zi Qing to a junior status. The Taoist and Ferge across from them were speechless, because these were the exact words the Taoist had just used to comfort Ferge, but now Zhou Tian was using them to mock Li Lingyi.

"Hmph..." Li Lingyi snorted coldly, offering no reply. Now that the victors were kings and the vanquished were mere bandits, anything he said was meaningless and would only invite further disdain.

A tense atmosphere began to permeate the great hall. The competition within the secret realm proceeded in an orderly fashion. Battles raged on. While only a short time had elapsed in the great hall, over a month had already passed within the secret realm.

The remaining participants dwindled, and the number of individuals from other factions diminished. Tie Niu's righteous qi was split asunder by Gu Feng's single blade. The remaining participant from the Mechanical Kingdom was roasted to near death by Liu Yan directly inside his mecha; even the coolant made from ten-thousand-year ice hearts proved futile. A remaining Buddhist Son from Luotian Temple also had his 'dog'... no, his Buddhist head, shot off by Nan Qing. Master Zhikong's forehead pulsed with veins; he felt specifically targeted, as Nan Qing had, to date, only fired two arrows, eliminating two bald men respectively. The two assassins from the Light faction were quite dedicated, thoroughly upholding their creed of striking once and then retreating a thousand li if unsuccessful. Unfortunately, they successively encountered the scheming Sun Duan, who had placed profound marks on them, chasing them for thousands of li and ultimately slaying them with her... copper coins. The Taoists of the Dao Alliance were remarkably versatile; the breadth of their knowledge was astonishing. From high-level spells and array formations to beggar's eight-treasure chicken, they were incredibly proficient; they even mastered the art of brewing wine. Their journey through the secret realm was undoubtedly the most leisurely. Then, they were literally crushed to death by money by two fat cultivators from the Treasure Gathering Pavilion. The cultivation method of the Treasure Gathering Pavilion was exceedingly unique, requiring actual currency as an auxiliary. Of course, this wasn't currency where a number was simply written on paper, but rather astonishingly powerful currency refined by mighty cultivators through great effort and time. However, these two fat cultivators also had bad luck, encountering Zhao Yuan and Wu. Zhao Yuan's physical body withstood the deluge of money, his vitality soaring, his physique like dragon-veined refined gold, as he hammered one of the fat cultivators into submission. Wu was no less impressive; his fighting style was incredibly wild, and he also eliminated one of the fat cultivators. The Fool only sent one representative this time, so none of their people participated in the competition, preventing Zhou Tian from witnessing true strategic planning from thousands of miles away!

In the end, only the participants from Tianqin remained. Besides Zhou Xunchuan and his companions, there were also individuals from Tianqin's affiliated forces. Nan Qing was one, and another young man from Mount Huoyun. Mount Huoyun was home to a lone cultivator of considerable renown, whose mastery of fire techniques was near perfection. His disciple, Yan Hao, was similarly gifted. This was evident from Yan Hao's fiery red hair, as generally, only those with special physiques exhibit such unusual traits. Only these two entered the final rounds of contention; the rest of Tianqin's rogue cultivators had largely been eliminated.

Two months passed within the secret realm. The number of participants continued to decrease. Li Xuanyi and Gu Feng encountered the Banished Immortal and were eliminated after a prolonged struggle.

Whether by coincidence or fate, Liu Yan encountered Zhou Zui. They stood in a standoff for a long while. Just as Zhou Zui was on the verge of admitting defeat, Liu Yan preemptively pressed a palm to his own chest, thereby ending his journey in the secret realm and leaving Zhou Zui with nothing but a bitter, endless smile.

The two battle maniacs, Zhao Yuan and Wu, met. Fists met flesh, blood and gore splattered. Ultimately, Zhao Yuan emerged victorious due to his superior physical body. In the great hall, King Xiaoyao's mouth was stretched wide, almost audibly laughing. However, mindful of Prime Minister Liu's grim gaze, he kept silent, almost hurting himself from holding it in.

Sun Duan and Zhang Yi's fated battle... resulted in them enthusiastically pulling out a chessboard and playing a game, which made Zhou Tian feel drowsy. In the end, Zhang Yi won by half a move.

Zhou Xunchuan fully displayed his imperial demeanor, eliminating Yan Hao with grand, sweeping moves. Even though Yan Hao possessed the Blazing Heaven Sacred Physique, the Emperor among fires, it was of no avail.

In the end, only five individuals remained in the secret realm: the Banished Immortal, Nan Qing, Zhou Xunchuan, Zhou Zui, and Zhao Yuan.

In the remaining time, the Banished Immortal encountered Nan Qing. Nan Qing drew his bow for a long time, its body radiating a dazzling bloody glow, but ultimately failed to release an arrow, conceding defeat somberly.

Zhao Yuan and Zhou Xunchuan met. Disregarding his status as a prince, Zhao Yuan immediately tore his clothes, inviting a full-on brawl. They fought intensely, both drenched in sweat. Ultimately, Zhou Xunchuan proved superior, throwing Zhao Yuan to the ground.

What was strange was that Zhou Xunchuan and the Banished Immortal then met. A super battle ensued. Dragon roars and phoenix cries echoed, massive palms covered the sky. The fierce battle lasted for nearly half a day. Ultimately, the Banished Immortal emerged victorious. However, he wasn't unscathed either. A trickle of crystalline blood flowed from the corner of his mouth, nourishing a patch of land.

And so, Zhou Zui simply 'lurked' until the final decisive battle with the Banished Immortal, making Zhou Tian couldn't help but sigh at this fellow's incredible luck.

When only two individuals remained, to save time, the secret realm directly indicated their respective directions. Neither of them showed fear, rushing towards the other's location. Originally, Zhou Tian expected this to be a one-sided crushing defeat, but the actual situation was somewhat beyond his expectations.

"Seven Emotions and Six Desires Sacred Art?" The Banished Immortal frowned the moment he saw Zhou Zui, speaking. This was the first time he had spoken within this secret realm, his voice low and resonant, like the tolling of the Grand Dao's bell.

"You can tell?" Zhou Zui was also slightly surprised. "Are you truly some ancient mighty figure?"

Divine patterns surfaced in the Banished Immortal's eyes, silver light radiating outwards as if he possessed nine-layered pupils. He didn't respond to Zhou Zui's question, instead saying, "How is your progress so fast? Have you found your tribulation?"

"It seems your origins are indeed profound. To know the Seven Emotions and Six Desires Sacred Art so well, you must at least be a figure from before the collapse of the Futian Realm." Zhou Zui also did not reply. Both of them seemed to be talking to themselves.

Dragon patterns appeared on the Banished Immortal's forehead, emitting golden light. After a long while, the dragon patterns vanished, and he spoke, "There's no need for this battle. Although I would temporarily gain the upper hand, if you unleash the sacred art's divine abilities, I would be greatly affected due to special reasons. Therefore, I concede!"

Zhou Zui remained silent, seemingly acquiescing. If the Banished Immortal truly was a returned mighty figure from ancient times, the Seven Emotions and Six Desires Sacred Art would indeed have a significant impact on him. After all, it was unknown whether he was still the Banished Immortal or that particular mighty figure.

The Banished Immortal conceded, vanishing from the secret realm. Zhou Zui became the final victor. A sky-reaching pillar of light enveloped Zhou Zui. Heavenly maidens appeared, scattering Grand Dao flower petals. The entire secret realm cheered for him.

Zhou Tian wore a dumbfounded expression. He won just like that? This was too fake! Had the Banished Immortal taken a bribe? He had 'lurked' until the very end, only to discover he perfectly countered his opponent, winning without a fight?
