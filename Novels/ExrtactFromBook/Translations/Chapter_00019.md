# Chapter 19: Spending

Han Yue picked up the first item, the [Demon Containment Pagoda], carefully examining the properties of this magical artifact. 

He found the craftsmanship exquisite—holding it felt like cradling a work of art. The [Ethereal Jade] material was incredibly light, making the pagoda almost weightless in his hand. As he extended his spiritual sense into it, the thirty cubic meters of storage space felt tangible, as if within reach.

Xiao Qing explained from the side, "This [Demon Containment Pagoda] is currently the largest storage artifact in our shop. However, its size makes it inconvenient to carry around. Moreover, the price is steep, putting it out of reach for most buyers. We expect it will likely be purchased by large organizations for storing and transporting high-value goods."

Han Yue nodded in agreement. Storage artifacts had unique properties and couldn't be merged with one's body. Given its bulkiness, this pagoda didn't suit his needs. He set it aside without hesitation.

Next, Han Yue picked up the [Treasure Pouch]. This small bag was much more portable—soft to the touch and easy to carry on his person. 

Xiao Qing continued, "We have plenty of [Treasure Pouches] in stock, with storage spaces under three cubic meters. The smallest holds just one cubic meter and is much more affordable. Most cultivators opt for these pouches since a few cubic meters are enough for personal belongings. Paired with specialized storage items like corpse bags, ore sacks, or herb cases, they cover nearly all storage needs while offering the best value."

Han Yue found this setup quite appealing—it aligned with his preferences and was budget-friendly.

Finally, he picked up the [Silver Hairpin], the most expensive item per unit of storage space. Despite its simple name, the hairpin felt exceptional in his hand. 

Crafted from meticulously forged precious metal, it had a dense, weighty texture. The slender pin, about two-thirds the length of his palm, was adorned with intricate engravings—only a few flowing cloud patterns graced its tip, exuding understated elegance. 

Han Yue swung the hairpin lightly like a small sword, its sharp whistle cutting through the air. He was instantly smitten—this little hairpin had won him over completely.

Xiao Qing remarked, "This [Silver Hairpin] truly reflects a master's craftsmanship. Many find it irresistibly beautiful upon handling it. The reason it hasn't sold yet is purely due to price. Custom-making it was costly—material expenses alone accounted for eighty percent of the production cost. We can't afford to sell it at a loss."

"The [Ascendant Gold and Crushed Silver] used here is incredibly durable, impervious to ordinary attacks, making it inherently valuable. Add the master artificer's touch, and the price naturally soared to ten thousand merchant coins, which drastically narrowed the pool of potential buyers. Many high-profile clients already possess inherited or sect-bestowed storage artifacts, so demand is lower than one might expect."

Xiao Qing was an excellent salesperson—her explanations were thorough and logical, free from pushiness, which Han Yue appreciated.

Once he held the [Silver Hairpin], Han Yue had already made up his mind. He was determined to acquire this captivating artifact, even if it meant paying a premium. 

In his past life, he'd squandered money on useless luxuries without a second thought. This artifact, however, was genuinely valuable and practical. Besides, in this ruthless world of demons and monsters, why should he deny himself?

Han Yue promptly expressed his intent to purchase. Delighted, Xiao Qing swiftly processed the transaction and even secured him a bonus—a delicate purple [Treasure Pouch] with exactly one cubic meter of storage space.

Without hesitation, Han Yue tossed the pouch to Xiao Liu, who had been watching enviously. The unexpected windfall nearly made the boy's grin split his face. 

He couldn't believe he now owned a storage artifact of his own—it felt like a dream. Clutching the pouch reverently, he stroked it repeatedly before finally attaching it to his belt. Part of him wanted to wear it on his forehead just to flaunt it to his friends. The mere thought of their envy-filled drooling made him even happier.

Meanwhile, Xiao Liu bombarded Han Yue with effusive praise: 

"Xiao Liu will follow Brother Dao forever—alive as your man, dead as your ghost!" 

"When we get back, I'll stage a coup and hand over Sister's shop to you!" 

"Xiao Liu will make Sister bear your children!"

His ridiculous declarations had everyone laughing.

After purchasing the expensive [Silver Hairpin], Han Yue's merchant account was nearly depleted, leaving only a little over a hundred coins—months of savings spent in an instant.

Yet, spending truly could bring joy. Both Han Yue and Xiao Liu were thoroughly pleased with their new acquisitions.

For Han Yue, the past few months of hunting had been immensely fruitful—tempering his magic, strengthening his body, honing his divine abilities, and accumulating combat experience. Now, he'd converted his wealth into a coveted artifact. It was perfection.

By now, Han Yue had fully adapted to his transmigrated life. He'd found his social standing, built meaningful relationships, defined his goals, and was making steady progress. He faced the future with confidence, ready to overcome any challenge.

As they prepared to leave, Xiao Qing handed Han Yue a booklet. 

"Master Han, the order you placed with our fifth-floor associate Tang Xian has been completed. Here is the delivered product for your review. Should any issues arise, feel free to return."

Han Yue took the book, its cover inscribed with three characters: *Records of Observations*. Though newly compiled and brief in content, it brought him great satisfaction.

Earlier, Han Yue had spent two thousand coins commissioning the merchant house to gather and compile information about regions beyond Fenrou Market—details on sects, geography, local specialties, cultivation methods, and more. This booklet was the result.

With a final exchange of pleasantries, Xiao Qing escorted them downstairs, concluding their mutually satisfying transaction. Han Yue and Xiao Liu strode away, their spirits high.
