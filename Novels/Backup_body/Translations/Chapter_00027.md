# Chapter 27: Divine Powers Bestowed by Heaven? I Can Bestow Them Too!

"What?" The wall-perching bird exclaimed, "Innate divine abilities are born with us, evolving as we grow! How can such powers be granted?"

"Since ancient times, it's been said that divine powers are bestowed by heaven!"

"Why have the records never mentioned that divine powers can be artificially granted?"

Its eyes were filled with skepticism as it added, "I've read many books—don't try to fool me!"

"To be honest, I've never heard of it either," Ghost Valley Lingguan spread his claws and said, "But while reshaping you, I examined your flesh, bones, organs, and marrow from the inside out. I roughly understand how your innate divine abilities are formed!"

He continued, "Divine abilities are like the wings birds are born with, allowing them to soar the skies! So, if I attach a pair of wings to someone, connect the tendons and bones, and train them, they too could fly—as if bestowed with the power of flight! Unfortunately, we lack the materials here to give him a proper pair of wings..."

Then Ghost Valley Lingguan's eyes gleamed with excitement as he chuckled, "But I can grant him the **Divine Flame** ability! This will be an unprecedented feat in all of history!"

"Divine Flame?" the wall-perching bird gasped. "Isn't that the divine ability of my White Phoenix lineage?"

"I've already fully deciphered the Divine Flame ability you were born with," Ghost Valley Lingguan waved his claws dismissively. "In your throat, the muscle layers appear as one, but in reality, they consist of 36,500 tiny muscle fibers and 187,643 fine meridians connected to your internal organs."

"When you will it, the movement of your organs and qi activates these 187,643 meridians, causing the 36,500 muscle fibers to vibrate!"

"The patterns within these fibers resemble inscribed formations, containing hollow spaces that store the fire-attribute spiritual energy drifting in the world."

"As your organs stir and the meridians pull, the 36,500 fire-infused muscle fibers rub against each other like flint striking stone, producing sparks!"

"Thirty-six thousand five hundred muscle fibers—thirty-six thousand five hundred sparks—merge into a single flame!"

"Infused with inner qi, like oil poured on fire, the moment it leaves your mouth, it becomes a raging inferno!"

"This is the essence of the Divine Flame ability!"

Ghost Valley Lingguan explained it all casually, yet his words struck like a thunderbolt!

Li Zhengjing was astonished, while the wall-perching bird was utterly dumbfounded, its eyes filled with disbelief.

"Young man, my plan to grant you the Divine Flame ability is already perfected!"

"First, I'll make an incision in your throat and meticulously divide the muscles into 36,500 segments, etching them with formation runes—that's step one!"

"Then, I'll extract 187,643 fine meridians from Fan Kaihu and implant them into your body, connecting them to the 36,500 muscle fibers—that's step two!"

"Finally, I'll link these meridians to your internal organs!"

"Once that's done, with just a thought, your organs will activate, the 36,500 muscle fibers in your throat will vibrate, spiritual energy will ignite, and flames will emerge—granting you the Divine Flame ability!"

Ghost Valley Lingguan's eyes burned with excitement and fervor.

Li Zhengjing's expression shifted slightly, his throat suddenly feeling dry and sore.

Noticing his hesitation, Ghost Valley Lingguan reassured him, "Don't worry. A human throat is much larger than a bird's, making the procedure far easier for me. The success rate is much higher!"

"If I were to grant this ability to an ordinary bird, I'd only have a ten percent chance of success."

"But for you, I have at least a fifty percent chance! Rounding up, it's practically guaranteed!"

He added, "And I can even give you a voice like his—clear and melodious. When you're older and struggle to find a wife, a voice like that will make things much easier! So, what do you say?"

"No!"

Li Zhengjing shook his head firmly.

Because at that moment, he had already seen the changes on the golden page.

**Fortune:**  
- Ghost Valley Lingguan grants you the Divine Flame ability by modifying your throat, but you lose your voice in the process.  
- When the Thousand Illusion Divine Monarch returns to the mountain and discovers you've been rendered mute without recovery, he will conclude you are not the Eternal Verdant Sacred Body. Enraged, he will have you executed by slow slicing, your bones crushed to ashes, leaving no corpse intact!  

**"You refuse?"**  

Ghost Valley Lingguan looked disappointed. "After all the effort I put into deciphering the Divine Flame ability, I can't just let it go to waste. What about... your hand?"  

He clapped excitedly like a child. "It's settled then! If your hand is ruined, I'll chop off his and give it to you!"  

He pointed at Fan Kaihu, who had just emerged from the medicine room.  

In an instant, Fan Kaihu's face turned deathly pale.  

Because he knew—the old ghost wasn't joking.  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing glanced at Fan Kaihu's hands and shook his head. "The palms and fingertips are calloused, and the fingers are stubby. They're neither attractive nor practical."  

Fan Kaihu's expression darkened further, though inwardly, he breathed a sigh of relief.  

Ghost Valley Lingguan sighed. "Then how about my dragon claws?"  

He extended his own claw—covered in scales, cold and metallic.  

He flexed it. "Dragon claws are tough and powerful, but for surgery, healing, and handling medicine, human hands are steadier and more precise. That's why I kept one..."  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing fell silent again, glancing once more at the golden page.  

**Fortune:**  
- Ghost Valley Lingguan modifies your left arm to grant the Divine Flame ability, embedding a hidden mechanism that provides an outlet for the **Great Profound Void Myriad Transformation Sword Qi**!  
- This prevents the sword qi from erupting through your body once you reach the peak of the **Inner Qi** realm, sparing you from being torn apart from within, your organs ruptured, and your appearance ruined!  

**Fortune (2):**  
- Upon reaching the peak of the **Inner Qi** realm, with the Divine Flame ability and the sharpness of the Great Profound Void Myriad Transformation Sword Qi, you will be unrivaled among all Inner Qi practitioners in the world!  

**Fortune (3):**  
- After reaching the peak of the **Inner Qi** realm, the Thousand Illusion Divine Monarch becomes even more convinced you are the Eternal Verdant Sacred Body, listing you as his third potential replacement vessel!  

**Fortune (4):**  
- **Congratulations!** You are one step closer to becoming the Thousand Illusion Divine Monarch!  
- *"Congratulations my ass! Thanks a lot!"*  

Li Zhengjing cursed inwardly but quickly reconsidered, finding an unexpected silver lining. *"According to the fortunes, modifying my left arm will succeed?"*  

*"And once it's done, I'll be safe until I reach the peak of the Inner Qi realm!"*  

*"During that time, I won't have to worry about being killed by the Great Profound Void Myriad Transformation Sword Qi or being executed by the Thousand Illusion Divine Monarch!"*  

*"Even though the sword qi's danger remains afterward, that's a problem for the **True Qi** realm."*  

*"By then, I'll be considered an upper-tier cultivator, with broader knowledge and resources to find another way to alter my fate!"*  

Having made up his mind, he took a step back and bowed respectfully.  

"Senior, please bestow upon me this divine ability!"  

"Excellent!"  

Ghost Valley Lingguan could barely contain his excitement, waving his claws. "Let's begin at once!"  

"Master, don't do this! This old freak isn't—"  

Before the wall-perching bird could finish, a claw smacked it unconscious, and Ghost Valley Lingguan casually tossed it onto the wall.  

Tucking the dragon horn into his robes, he grinned at Li Zhengjing.  

Clearly, his interest in modifying the White Phoenix had waned—his greatest excitement now lay in granting this young man the Divine Flame ability!  

"Since ancient times, it has been said that divine powers are bestowed by heaven alone!"  

"If this succeeds today, it will be an unprecedented feat!"  

"I will be the first physician in history capable of granting divine abilities to others!"  

"And you—the first person to receive such a gift—will also be recorded in the annals of history!"  

"They say divine powers are bestowed by heaven, but I say... **I can bestow them too!**"  

Ghost Valley Lingguan's expression bordered on madness as he laughed wildly, his golden eyes gleaming, fangs bared, looking utterly terrifying!  

Seeing his frenzied state, Li Zhengjing felt a pang of unease and regret.  

*Did I agree too hastily?*
