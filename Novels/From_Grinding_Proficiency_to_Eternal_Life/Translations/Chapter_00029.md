Chapter 29: True Power

Under the influence of the Dao Sect's Dragon and Tiger Great Pill, Li Haomiao even felt that he had already stepped into the Organ Refining Realm. His Qi and strength were enduring, and the power contained in every punch was extremely astonishing.

With every punch thrown, Li Miaoyun had to retract her hand to defend. Her fingers moved like plucking flowers, with strange ripples dancing at her fingertips. She actually化解ed the force from Li Haomiao's fist from about an inch away, using Qi to neutralize it from a distance.

It was still a bit lacking. If his control over his strength were sufficient, Li Miaoyun would have been taken down by him long ago.

Li Haomiao secretly lamented. Although his limbs had grown back, he still needed some time to adapt. After all, he had been without hands and feet for several months, and now that they were restored, he needed time to get used to them. Moreover, regenerating severed limbs required too much vitality; one Dragon and Tiger Great Pill was barely enough.

As time passed, Li Haomiao's control over his own strength became more and more refined.

At this moment, a deafening roar suddenly erupted from his chest, like the roar of an ancient beast. The sound waves rolled out, shaking even the surrounding snow.

His legs were firmly planted on the ground, sinking deep into the snow. On his arms, blue veins, like winding small snakes, rapidly crawled over them. Under the tension of his muscles, they rose layer upon layer, with every muscle pulling into traces as fine as steel wire.

His手掌 clenched, and his five fingers accurately hooked together, forming a fist seal.

Immediately after, his arm, like a cannon that had been primed for a long time, pushed out swiftly. At the moment the punch was thrown, the muscles of his shoulder and back exerted force simultaneously, driving the power of his arm to stack layer upon layer, like a surging wave, one wave after another, constantly increasing.

"True Power?"

Li Miaoyun's eyes suddenly turned cold. She reacted swiftly, raising her arms to defend. The thin gauze of her sleeves billowed and churned wildly as Qi surged through them, her posture steady.

With a "bang" sound, the two of them each took several steps back.

This was somewhat unfavorable.

Li Haomiao's heart sank. He had already mobilized the active True Blood in his body with this punch, but he still couldn't injure Li Miaoyun.

The External Three Unions nurtured Qi, allowing him to cross two major realms and fight against the Blood Refining Realm. Now that he had activated his True Blood, he thought he could suppress her, but he didn't expect...

Li Miaoyun had made her judgment. Just then, countless strange, hair-thin, black-green veins instantly crawled all over her body, even covering her face.

However, this did not affect her appearance; instead, it carried a breathtaking beauty. Every winding black-green vein on her body seemed naturally formed.

"If you had cultivated True Qi, I would have turned and left. But now, you have only just activated your True Blood, yet you are so arrogant and reckless. You're seeking death..."

She pressed her thin lips together. Since he had True Power, she didn't need to hold back too much. She would just beat him until he had only one breath left. As for the rest, as long as his head wasn't severed, there were ways to save him.

She tapped with her bare feet, and her figure, like a ghost, instantly closed in.

So fast!

Li Haomiao's pupils contracted sharply. He stood with his feet not quite in a horse stance, using his body as the axis, his fists and palms swaying, stirring up a劲 wind to protect his whole body.

However, Li Miaoyun's hands, like phantoms, rapidly穿梭ed around Li Haomiao's entire body. Every attack was incredibly precise, carrying a sharp劲 wind that passed through Li Haomiao's defense and struck his vital points.

Although Li Haomiao tried his best to dodge, because his newly grown limbs were not yet fully adapted, his evasion speed was slightly slower. He was quickly struck multiple times by Li Miaoyun's attacks.

Blood continuously seeped from the corners of Li Haomiao's mouth and his wounds, dyeing his clothes bright red.

But his eyes remained firm. He gritted his teeth, enduring the severe pain, constantly searching for a chance to counterattack.

While Li Miaoyun attacked frantically, her breathing also became increasingly unstable. Such high-intensity movement of her body technique was almost mostly used to protect her body, consuming her energy extremely drastically.

The wisp of Qi she had nurtured in her body was nearly exhausted in such a high-intense battle.

Suddenly, Li Miaoyun faced the nearby Li Haomiao, clasped her hands together in front of her chest, and formed a strange seal. From her mouth, she uttered a strange syllable.

'Om!'

It was like a great bell or a grand bell, yet it seemed like a great sound is rare. The sound of this strange syllable was not loud; one could even say it was a whisper.

However, this sound tugged at people's hearts, making Li Haomiao lose his focus, and the rhythm of his attacks slowed down by more than half.

In a contest between experts, such a slow opening was a huge mistake that could determine the victor.

Li Miaoyun's fingers moved, and one finger shot out again, stirring up wind and thunder, and pierced into Li Haomiao's chest, going straight in.

Li Haomiao grunted, but paid it no mind. His fists, like hammers, bounced through the air, creating a heavy 'humming' sound.

Bang!

With a muffled sound, Li Miaoyun, like a leather drum, flew far away. However, in mid-air, she twisted her body and flipped in a way that defied common sense. Her figure, like catkins or goose feathers, lightly landed on the snow.

Although her every move carried a sense of ethereality, Li Miaoyun's face became increasingly pale. One could even see that the blood beneath her skin had vanished, and her aura was extremely unstable.

Li Haomiao was also stumbling at this time, staggering back a few steps before sitting down on the ground, completely collapsing. His chest heaved rapidly a few times, then the movement became extremely slow.

Li Miaoyun's finger had pierced through his heart. He needed to regulate his heart, controlling its contraction and beating frequency, otherwise he would die on the spot.

Li Miaoyun stabilized her breath and slowly walked up to Li Haomiao. The light in her eyes was no longer indifferent as before, but instead carried a trace of killing intent. However, as if she remembered something, the sharpness in her eyes quickly faded.

"If it weren't for His Majesty wanting you alive, you would have died just now."

The moment her words fell, a black shadow shot out from the side like lightning. Its momentum was like a fierce tiger. As it charged forward, the snow was actually trampled into pits. The newcomer was none other than Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan tightly wrapped his arms around Li Miaoyun, his hands and legs intertwined, and pressed her down onto the ground.

Li Miaoyun had never suffered such a treatment. Her expression was clearly stunned for a moment, then she quickly reacted, and for the first time, anger appeared on her face.

"Let me go!"

She wanted to use her Qi, but found that after fighting with Li Haomiao, it was already exhausted. If she used it recklessly, the Qi she had nurtured for many years would be ruined.

This hesitation flashed through her mind in an instant.

Li Haomiao, lying on the ground, saw this and forcefully supported his almost collapsing body to get up. He mobilized the little True Power left in his body.

A faint, almost imperceptible golden light appeared at his fingertip. He suddenly pointed it at Li Miaoyun's chest.

This imperceptible golden light instantly surged into Li Miaoyun's body, tightly sealing the wisp of Qi in her body that was now faint and almost non-existent.

Li Miaoyun let out a painful grunt, and her tense body instantly became soft and powerless.

Her eyes were filled with unwillingness and disbelief. Her Qi had been sealed?!

After completing this strike, Li Haomiao also completely lost his ability to fight. He collapsed to the ground, gasping for large breaths. The blood hole in his chest, pierced by Li Miaoyun, kept opening and closing, and blood began to flow out continuously.

He had exhausted his strength and could no longer hold his body together.

But hearing Xu Yunfan squeeze Li Miaoyun until her bones creaked, Li Haomiao endured the pain and said.

"Don't, don't kill her. Now that the Qi in her body has been sealed by me, she is no different from a weak woman. She has a great use."
