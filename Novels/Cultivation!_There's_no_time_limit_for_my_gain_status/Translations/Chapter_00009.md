# Chapter 9: The Role of the Jade Token  

Fu Zhong sighed dramatically, pausing for effect before continuing.  

"Little brother, I'll be frank with you. In those sects, a top-grade spiritual root will get you directly into the inner sect. As for the outer sect, disciples with high-grade spiritual roots usually receive much better treatment than those with mid-grade ones."  

"Here's the deal, Jiang Li. I, Fu Zhong, genuinely feel for your situation. If you can persuade your friend to stay with the Ascension Pavilion together, I'll personally ensure you receive the same treatment as a high-grade spiritual root disciple. What do you say?"  

Jiang Li was momentarily taken aback. He glanced at Yan Hong before bowing respectfully to Fu Zhong.  

"Thank you for your kindness, Elder Fu... I'll do my best to try."  

He deliberately lowered his voice for the latter half of his response, feigning eagerness to convince Yan Hong to stay.  

Fu Zhong was visibly pleased, his already narrow eyes narrowing further into slits.  

After glancing at the wooden plaque now hanging around his neck, Jiang Li smiled and stood beside Yan Hong.  

Given the incident with the scale demons, it was almost certain that the Ascension Pavilion was involved in human trafficking to some extent.  

Potential cultivators like them were essentially commodities, much like the scale demons, capable of generating profit.  

However, Fu Zhong's seemingly sincere attitude reassured him somewhat.  

It was clear that mid-grade spiritual roots and above held significant value for the Ascension Pavilion and other sects.  

Yet, despite being on their turf, they didn't forcibly recruit promising candidates. Instead, they used persuasion—implying some unspoken rules prevented them from exploiting defenseless aspirants.  

The most likely explanation was the presence of other sects in the region.  

These cultivators were centuries-old foxes. Even if they outsourced recruitment to the more specialized Ascension Pavilion for convenience, they wouldn't leave it unchecked. Otherwise, if all the top talents were monopolized by the Ascension Pavilion, the entire Great Chong Mountain's cultivation world would fall under their control within a century.  

Soon, the half-hour limit ended. The testing arrays flickered out as their energy depleted. Among the remaining eight tested alongside Jiang Li, none managed to fill their spirit orbs.  

Notably, one of them was Yan Fengyue—the mixed-race girl whose peeping incident had led to the original Jiang Li's death. Her delicate features were now etched with disappointment as an attendant carelessly hung a low-grade spiritual root plaque around her neck.  

Jiang Li glanced at her. She clutched the plaque tightly, her gaze flickering toward him and his companions, lost in thought.  

Once the proud princess, adored by many, she had expected to rise like a phoenix after the test—only to be labeled with a low-grade spiritual root.  

Meanwhile, Jiang Li, Yan Hong, and Li Baichen—people she had once looked down upon—now possessed talents far surpassing hers.  

The jealousy gnawing at her heart was unbearable, yet she could do nothing. Resigned to reality, she began plotting her next move.  

"Yan Hong and Jiang Li are close. One has a high-grade spiritual root, the other a dual-attribute mid-grade. Together, they'll form a formidable group among this batch."  

"Yan Hong and I share royal blood from the Hongyan Kingdom. Jiang Li used to pursue me—yes, he got beaten because of it, but that wasn't my fault. If Yan Hong puts in a good word and I play the victim a little, I can make him fall for me again."  

"If I join them, with Yan Hong and that fool Jiang Li's help, maybe in the future..."  

Yan Fengyue wasn't the only one scheming.  

With the spiritual root results out, the original unstable group dynamics within the caravan had collapsed.  

None of them were fools. Each had their own calculations, and soon, new factions would form around the few high-grade spiritual root holders.  

After a long wait, the testing of over two hundred youths concluded.  

Only nineteen, including Jiang Li, had mid-grade spiritual roots. High-grade spiritual roots numbered a mere five, and not a single top-grade spiritual root was found.  

The brutal culling of the cultivation world had begun at this very first step.  

"Alright, everyone has completed their tests and learned their spiritual root attributes and grades."  

"Now, all those with mid-grade or higher spiritual roots, as well as those holding our Ascension Pavilion jade tokens, follow me. We'll depart for the Ascension Assembly shortly."  

"As for the rest, remain here. You'll have alternate arrangements."  

At these words, nearly half the youths stepped forward to stand behind Fu Zhong. Most were dressed in fine silks, while the few plainly clothed among them were the ones who had tested with mid-grade or higher spiritual roots.  

Left behind were over a hundred anxious youths, all in coarse linen—their families clearly unable to afford the jade tokens.  

Could it be...?  

Jiang Li and Yan Hong exchanged glances, both forming the same suspicion.  

"I'll go ask."  

Yan Hong suddenly seemed to recall something. After a quick word, he hurried to Fu Zhong's side and began speaking with him.  

Their round, plump faces made for an oddly harmonious pair.  

Likely due to Yan Hong's high-grade spiritual root, Fu Zhong shared quite a bit with him before leading them to a resting chamber and taking his leave.  

They were told that reaching the Ascension Assembly required another mode of transport and that they'd have to wait for other caravans to finish testing before setting off together.  

Fortunately, the resting chamber was stocked with exquisite food. After the grueling journey and hours of testing, everyone was exhausted and hungry. Cheers erupted as they dug in.  

The high-grade spiritual root holders instinctively spread out across different tables, while the others chose their seats based on their own calculations—an implicit declaration of allegiance.  

However, a minor issue arose at Jiang Li and Yan Hong's table.  

"Brother, I found out what that jade token is about."  

"Go on."  

Though Jiang Li had his own suspicions, confirmation would be ideal.  

"When the cultivator testing us mentioned that this token could exempt us from two years of labor in any sect, that was only half-true—and not entirely accurate."  

"This is just an ordinary jade token. It holds no power in any other sect!"  

"The accurate statement is: This token exempts you from two years of labor—but only in the Ascension Pavilion!"
