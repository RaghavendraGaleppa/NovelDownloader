# Chapter 129: Jade Liquid Golden Elixir

At Qingfu Palace, Fushong was casually recounting his experiences in Tianxuan City to Zhang Jingxiu, who had just emerged from seclusion. His tone was understated, yet the tale itself was thrilling and magnificent.

Zhang Jingxiu's face darkened as he listened, then he remarked coolly, "Brother Fushong, your indifference to life and death truly surprises this old Daoist."

Fushong's face was full of question marks—was Zhang implying he was usually a coward? 

This was pure, unadulterated jealousy!

However, Fushong had already decided to record this experience in his "Tales of the Immortal Realm by Daoist Fushong." In it, he would describe his fierce battle with one of the Three Evils of Tianxuan, while Zhou Qing effortlessly subdued a Foundation Establishment Great Perfection cultivator with his hands behind his back.

This would highlight Fushong's contributions to the battle while showcasing Zhou Qing's immense divine abilities. Of course, his own account would be entirely truthful.

After all, had he not fought fiercely with Ye Chong, one of the Three Evils of Tianxuan? Had he not caused Ye Chong to suffer grievous injuries? 

As for Zhou Qing subduing a Foundation Establishment Great Perfection cultivator—well, in Fushong's eyes, Ye Chong was no ordinary opponent. Who's to say he wouldn't reach Great Perfection in the future? And even if he didn't, so what if Fushong misjudged his cultivation level? Couldn't he be at the peak of mid-Foundation Establishment?

Though Zhang Jingxiu's praise was laced with sarcasm, Fushan offered a fair assessment: "Junior Brother Fushong's willingness to endure heavenly lightning back then was indeed a testament to his transcendence of life and death. However, he has grown lax in recent years. It is heartening to see him rekindle his Daoist heart."

Zhang Jingxiu smiled. "The human heart is treacherous. For us, cultivating the Dao is difficult, but upholding it is even harder. External distractions easily unsettle the mind. Brother Fushong has surely grown greatly from this experience."

Fushong snorted lightly. "Old Zhang, since you've emerged from seclusion, does this mean your Giant Spirit Profound Art has achieved success?"

"Indeed," Zhang Jingxiu replied serenely.

Fushong grinned. "Perfect timing. Qingzhi and I have returned to gather Qi Refining pills for the Luopoling Market. Since you're out, you must be eager to visit your little tree. Why not spar with Qingzhi?"

Zhou Qing was in the medicinal garden, listening to Lin Wan'er play the qin while Yuan Mingyue accompanied her on the xiao. The harmonious duet evoked the free-spirited ethos of the martial world.

Yuan Mingyue had also set up a Water Spirit Formation in the Jiangzhou medicinal garden, drawing underground water veins to create a spiritual spring that meandered through the garden like a winding stream.

Whenever Zhou Qing returned, he would relax here. He had even woven fragile mulberry branches—pruned from the Great Mulberry Tree—into chairs. This, he hoped, might reduce the tree's spiritual essence, making it less likely to attract heavenly lightning. 

Zhou Qing had gone to great lengths for the Great Mulberry Tree.

As for Maori, he was still stationed at the Water Mansion.

After his transformation, Maori exuded the aura of a fifth-tier demonic beast at the late Foundation Establishment stage, surpassing even Little Snake (a fourth-tier demonic beast at mid-Foundation Establishment). 

It seemed that Little Snake's rapid progress years ago had pressured Maori, who had secretly trained hard over the years. At the critical moment of the Great Mulberry Tree's transformation, Maori had piggybacked on its energy to undergo his own metamorphosis, stunning everyone with his progress.

This proved the wisdom of raising Little Snake—competition bred motivation. Otherwise, Maori would have lazed around all day.

Practicing "Lung Metal Thunder" was excruciating for Zhou Qing. Each session felt like countless needles piercing his body, with the pain searing into his consciousness. Yet he endured it without complaint.

Persistence was never difficult for him. What frustrated him was the agonizingly slow progress despite the immense suffering. Fortunately, his "Health Preservation System" allowed him to perceive tangible improvements with each session. Without this, the ordeal would have been unbearable—like descending into an endless hell with no hope in sight.

"I hope that after the beast tide war, our ties with Tianxuan City will strengthen, allowing me to find spiritual materials to aid in practicing Lung Metal Thunder," Zhou Qing mused.

His cultivation of the Five Organs Thunder followed the principle of "reverse generation of the five elements." Perhaps this aligned with the Daoist adage: "Following leads to humanity; reversing leads to immortality."

Metal and water nourish each other. The Lung Metal Thunder and Kidney Water Thunder could also synergize. The vast metal-attribute spiritual energy generated by practicing Lung Metal Thunder merged into the "One Yuan Heavy Water."

Zhou Qing discovered that although the nine drops of One Yuan Heavy Water had reached the first-layer perfection and couldn't fuse into the second layer, they could still continuously absorb the metal-attribute energy from Lung Metal Thunder, refining and increasing their weight.

He speculated that completing Lung Metal Thunder might allow him to advance the One Yuan Heavy Water to the second layer without reaching the Golden Core stage. At that point, the One Yuan Heavy Water would qualify as a Golden Core-level divine ability.

He wondered what effects it would have when used to temper the Green Wooden Sword.

As Zhou Qing listened to the qin-xiao duet, his mood relaxed. Suddenly, he sensed something and vanished from the garden.

"Brother Zhang, you wish to spar with me to test the power of your Giant Spirit Profound Art?"

"Correct."

"Then let's go to the Jingyang Dao Domain first. Merge with the Great Pine Tree before we fight."

A Demonic Seed cultivator was only at full strength when fused with their Demonic Seed. During his seclusion, Zhang Jingxiu had isolated himself from the Great Pine Tree to focus entirely on comprehending the Giant Spirit Profound Art. Now, he needed to reconnect.

Zhang Jingxiu's lips twitched. "The Great Pine Tree is terrified of you. How can I fight you after merging with it?"

Zhou Qing chuckled. "No problem. I'll use Thousand Illusions to mask my aura."

Zhang Jingxiu nodded.

Fushong, ever the spectator, eagerly tagged along to witness the event.

Once preparations were complete, Zhang Jingxiu merged with the Great Pine Tree at the market, and they headed to the seaside in the mortal domain. Unlike the Jingyang Dao Domain, here they were sovereigns over thirty million lives. Even earth-shaking battles would cause no ripple.

On the sea, Zhang Jingxiu stood bare-chested, his muscles bulging as his body grew taller, exuding a terrifying, ferocious aura. Even Fushong, watching from afar, felt a chill.

Xiao Ruowang, having received a message, also arrived.

The bond between them was far deeper than the typical relationships in the Jingyang Dao Domain. They had faced life and death together, supporting each other on the path of cultivation. Thus, they could spar without reservation, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses.

Moreover, those who underwent heavenly lightning baptism possessed extraordinary Daoist nature—a pattern recently noted by the Daoist Court.

Even Qi Refinement cultivators who later endured heavenly lightning experienced profound mental effects, though not as pronounced as martial cultivators who underwent the transformation to Innate Realm directly.

For martial cultivators, enduring heavenly lightning to reach the Innate Realm was currently the most promising path within the Daoist Court, second only to Zhou Qing's self-initiated breakthrough.

Research by Tang Jieyuan and others in the Ancient Texts Pavilion suggested that powerful cultivators could provoke heavenly tribulations—a notion corroborated by the Great Mulberry Tree's experience.

A thunderous boom erupted as towering waves surged around them. Amid the cascading water, Zhang Jingxiu swung his right fist.

Zhou Qing didn't activate his Insight-Seeing Eye, relying only on his natural spiritual vision to perceive a colossal fist filling his field of view.

A resounding crash followed as an ice wall materialized silently before Zhou Qing, blocking Zhang Jingxiu's strike.

The ice wall shattered, and Zhang Jingxiu's second fist followed instantly.

A tiger's roar and thunderclap exploded in Zhang Jingxiu's mind—**Mind Disruption!**

But Zhang Jingxiu, familiar with Zhou Qing's tactics, steeled his heart like iron, unaffected.

Zhou Qing inwardly praised him, though he knew his Mind Disruption relied on surprise. Against prepared opponents or those with protective artifacts, its effectiveness waned.

He still lacked a formidable divine soul attack technique—a rarity in the cultivation world.

Calmly, Zhou Qing flicked his fingers, summoning dark, abyssal thunderbolts that collided head-on with Zhang Jingxiu's second strike.

A burst of profound darkness erupted. The towering waves collapsed, only to surge again in a cataclysmic upheaval.

Amid the roaring tides, Zhang Jingxiu unleashed his third punch. His blood qi and true energy coalesced into a colossal phantom that descended with his fist.

"Giant Spirit Phantom!"

Zhou Qing sensed danger. The Giant Spirit Profound Art was indeed extraordinary.

Water vapor coalesced into a massive shield under Zhou Qing's control, slowing Zhang Jingxiu's assault. Seizing the moment, Zhou Qing erupted with blinding speed, appearing behind Zhang Jingxiu.

**Wood Thunder!**

Azure thunderbolts blasted toward Zhang Jingxiu's back.

Yet Zhang Jingxiu seemed to anticipate this. The Giant Spirit Phantom twisted, intercepting the Wood Thunder.

*"The cicada senses the wind before it stirs."* Zhang Jingxiu's keen intuition saved him from complete vulnerability.

Zhou Qing smiled faintly and unsheathed the Green Wooden Sword.

A world-shaking slash cleaved through the Giant Spirit Phantom. Zhang Jingxiu barely dodged, but the sword still gashed his shoulder, leaving a deep wound that quickly healed.

Yet his blood qi and true energy churned violently—Zhou Qing's strike had been terrifyingly powerful.

"Brother Zhou, how is your sword so strong?" Zhang Jingxiu sensed mortal danger the moment Zhou Qing drew his sword.

"The Green Wooden Sword is now my life-bound artifact, upgraded to peak-grade."

Zhang Jingxiu marveled, "The might of a peak-grade artifact is truly fearsome."

Zhou Qing nodded. "A cultivator's combat power is fully realized only with suitable weapons and artifacts."

Zhang Jingxiu coughed lightly. "I lack a peak-grade artifact."

Zhou Qing smiled. "The Blazing Fire Saber I gave you earlier was only mid-grade. But since wood fuels fire, merging with the Great Pine Tree and practicing the Giant Spirit Profound Art, you might refine it into a high-grade artifact."

Zhang Jingxiu agreed. "I've considered that. This spar made me realize the Giant Spirit Profound Art's power, but its flexibility needs improvement."

Zhou Qing added, "Against peers, the Giant Spirit Phantom has flaws. But against hordes of weaker beasts, its might shines."

Zhang Jingxiu nodded. "Indeed. There's much to refine. Later, I'll spar with Brother Fushong."

Fushong: "..."

In Tianxuan City, at the Jin family estate.

Jin Guang, the Jin family patriarch, had been stuck at Foundation Establishment Great Perfection for thirty years. His cultivation, divine abilities, and artifacts had all reached the pinnacle, yet he still lacked the spark to form a Golden Core.

Though outsiders touted him as the most likely among human cultivators to achieve Golden Core, Jin Guang knew his window was closing within twenty years. Beyond that, his vitality would inevitably decline.

"True Golden Core formation requires the perfect fusion of essence, energy, and spirit. Achieving this before Foundation Establishment would make the process smoother. But merely reaching Foundation Establishment is arduous enough. For Qi Refinement cultivators, perfecting the three harmonies is even harder than Golden Core formation for Foundation Establishment cultivators." Jin Guang sighed.

He threw a punch, the air rippling with force.

His physical body had reached the mid-Cauldron stage—a rarity among Qi cultivators in the Jingyang Dao Domain. Even among body refiners, few matched him.

"To think your physical cultivation surpasses even that Qinglingzi's senior brother," remarked Ye Chong, entering.

"Has your injury healed?" Jin Guang asked.

Ye Chong shook his head. "Qinglingzi exploited flaws in my techniques, leaving hidden wounds tailored to my weaknesses."

His expression darkened, yet a hint of relief lingered.

Jin Guang understood. If Ye Chong recovered, his techniques would be perfected, potentially elevating him to Great Perfection. Moreover, Ye Chong's cultivation method, though theoretically leading to Golden Core, had slim chances. Repairing its flaws would align it perfectly with him.

For cultivators, calamities often harbored opportunities. Surviving this ordeal was a blessing in disguise.

Noting Jin Guang's silence, Ye Chong pressed, "What did Shang Zijian discuss with you during the council?"

Jin Guang smiled faintly. "He urged me to prioritize unity and dissuade you from provoking Qinglingzi."

Ye Chong snorted. "That brat is meticulous. With my injuries, I might not survive the beast tide. I've sworn a Dao oath—why would I seek trouble?"

Jin Guang said, "I explained the oath to Shang."

Ye Chong sighed. "Shang Zijian is decent. Realizing Qinglingzi exploited my flaws, I know I can never defeat him. But what technique does he practice to achieve this?"

Jin Guang mused, "Likely, his pre-cultivation medical expertise and serendipitous encounters granted him unique insights. Given Shang's intervention, it's best to reconcile. Who knows what might happen during the beast tide?"

Jin Guang, ever pragmatic, knew provoking Qinglingzi during the beast tide would risk offending Tianxuan Patriarch. Moreover, Qinglingzi, despite his youthful appearance, was undoubtedly young. Hot-headed youths might retaliate covertly, leaving Jin Guang no recourse.

Ye Chong, humbled by his defeat, had mellowed. "What do you propose?"

Jin Guang said, "Since Qinglingzi inflicted your wounds, let him heal you. We'll use this chance to bury the hatchet."

After Shang Zijian's warning, Jin Guang realized Qinglingzi's terrifying potential. With spiritual sense rivaling his own, Qinglingzi would inevitably reach Great Perfection and possibly form a Golden Core before him.

Though Jin Guang had compensated Qinglingzi, their grudge remained unresolved. If Qinglingzi formed a Golden Core first, with Tianxuan Patriarch nearing his end, the Jin family might face annihilation. Jin Guang couldn't assume Qinglingzi would share Tianxuan Patriarch's magnanimity.

Thus, he sought to mend ties, ensuring Qinglingzi wouldn't oppose him post-Golden Core. Most crucially, if Qinglingzi formed a Golden Core first and obstructed Jin Guang's attempt, his hopes would vanish.

Ye Chong, bound by his oath, saw little point in reconciliation. Then it dawned on him—Jin Guang feared Qinglingzi's future retaliation.

Had Jin Guang not intervened, Ye Chong would likely have died at Luopoling. Moreover, as one of the Three Evils, Ye Chong had many enemies. The Luopoling incident had been a trap. Jin Guang, ever cautious, had sent Ye Chong as the vanguard, leading to disaster.

Still, Jin Guang had ultimately saved him.

Ye Chong nodded. "Very well."

Jin Guang smiled. "Given your strained resources, I'll cover the consultation fee."

Ye Chong said, "My thanks. But ordinary gifts won't move Qinglingzi."

Jin Guang chuckled. "My offering will suffice."

---

At the Luopoling Market, Zhou Qing had just returned to the Water Mansion when he received a message.

"Brother Jin wants me to treat Ye Chong's injuries?" Zhou Qing was surprised. It made sense for the perpetrator to heal the victim, but why would they think he'd agree?

Jin Guang wasted no words, tossing over a jade slip. "Read this first."

Zhou Qing scanned it and smiled. "Generous. But aren't you afraid I'll take the formula and renege?"

Jin Guang replied, "To be frank, we're here to apologize again for past grievances, hoping you'll let bygones be bygones."

For a Great Perfection cultivator, such humility was rare. Zhou Qing respected Jin Guang all the more for it—true strength lay in adaptability.

Antagonizing Jin Guang further served no purpose, especially when he came bearing sincerity.

"I accept this gift. Your intentions are clear. Henceforth, we are fellow Daoists—let the past rest." Zhou Qing smiled.

Jin Guang knew a rare pill recipe alone wouldn't fully sway Zhou Qing. From his storage pouch, he produced a blood-red Dragon Blood Ganoderma. "With this, even if you lack other ingredients for the Jade Liquid Golden Elixir, you can still refine potent pills."

Zhou Qing's eyes gleamed.

The recipe Jin Guang provided was for the "Jade Liquid Golden Elixir," which increased Golden Core formation chances by thirty percent and extended the lifespan of pre-Golden Core cultivators. The ingredients were exceedingly rare, requiring thirty types of spiritual herbs, each at least five hundred years old.

Yet even an incomplete version of the elixir would be invaluable for Golden Core attempts. Moreover, the recipe itself offered insights into Golden Core formation, benefiting any Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Though Zhou Qing pursued the Dao Furnace path, the recipe's principles could aid his breakthrough. High-level cultivation truths were often universal.

Most ingredients Zhou Qing already possessed, thanks to the ancient herbs from the Divine Water Palace's garden. The three main components were:

1. **Longevity Jade Liquid** (naturally boosts Golden Core chances by 0.5%)
2. **Dragon Blood Ganoderma**
3. **Spiritual Dew from a Wood-attribute Foundation Establishment-level spirit**

Only the Dragon Blood Ganoderma eluded him—it was a specialty of the Blood Demon Sect, as Zhou Qing learned from Qin Qing's jade slip. That Jin Guang could procure it was impressive.

Zhou Qing wouldn't risk dealings with the Blood Demon Sect, given Qin Qing's death at his hands. That Jin Guang parted with the ganoderma suggested he had more.

For Zhou Qing, one was enough.

"Your generosity is appreciated," Zhou Qing said.

Jin Guang relaxed. With these gifts, unless Zhou Qing was truly malevolent, he'd have no reason to antagonize the Jin family further.

Pill recipes boosting Golden Core chances were priceless, often closely guarded secrets. Even if Zhou Qing couldn't gather all ingredients, the recipe itself was a treasure trove of insights.

If Zhou Qing formed a Golden Core with it, he'd owe Jin Guang a favor. Conversely, if Jin Guang succeeded first, he'd have no reason to oppose Zhou Qing—potential allies were precious, especially with Tianxuan Patriarch's impending demise.

This was the mindset of elite human cultivators in the Jingyang Dao Domain. Even Ye Chong, when he came to Luopoling, hadn't sought bloodshed—only control over the market and the Great Pine Tree.

Demonic cultivators, however, grew more unpredictable with age, unbound by such considerations.
