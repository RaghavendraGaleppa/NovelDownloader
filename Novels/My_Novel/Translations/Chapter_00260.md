# Chapter 260: Excessive Love Breeds Anxiety, Excessive Anxiety Destroys Serenity

The reeds swayed as the painted boat docked at the riverbank.

Li Xian secured the anchor rope and helped Wen Caixang disembark. The woman they had rescued, Wang Cuicui, followed quietly behind. Terrified of Wen Caixang, she dared not approach too closely.

Wen Caixang walked with slow, graceful steps, her figure swaying. Her silken skirt reflected the moonlight, her movements elegant and dignified. Wang Cuicui marveled that such a woman was a rarity in her lifetime.

They walked four or five miles.

The outline of Qing City appeared in the distance. Despite the late hour, the lingering fires and bustling activity indicated it was still lively. Wen Caixang said, "Lead the way."

Wang Cuicui immediately stepped forward, walking ahead of the two. Wen Caixang scolded, "You are not allowed to look at her." She pinched Li Xian's chin and said, "You may only look at me."

Li Xian smiled. "If I only look at you, I won't even be able to walk. Let me handle the business first. Tonight, I will look at you slowly."

Wen Caixang's pretty face flushed slightly. Her steps felt weak, her heart filled with sweetness. Having endured betrayal and near-death, Wang Cuicui couldn't help but envy the couple's tender words.

The outer city was cold and quiet, while the inner city was lively. Wang Cuicui's family was wealthy, possessing hundreds of acres of fertile land, seven shops, and a three-entry courtyard mansion in the inner city. Filled with hatred, she led them straight to the mansion to seek revenge.

The lights were dim, and the red gates were tightly shut. Li Xian vaulted over the courtyard wall, slipped into the rooms, and crept to the master bedroom, only to find it empty.

Li Xian questioned Wang Cuicui again. He learned that Zhang Dajiang was very close with a courtesan. Since he wasn't at the mansion, he must be at the brothel seeking pleasure.

To make things easier, they left Wen Caixang and Wang Cuicui in the main hall. Li Xian leaped up and over the courtyard wall. Stepping on the light tiles, his body like a wild goose, he drifted away into the distance.

He found the brothel. His martial arts were strong, and although he hadn't practiced the "Seven Star Steps" in a while, the light and ethereal essence remained. He skillfully climbed onto the roof.

He peered through a window. Seeing an old madam walking by, dressed in gaudy clothes, he opened the window, pulled her to a corner, and dislocated her jaw.

The old madam knew she was outmatched and cooperated obediently. Li Xian popped her jaw back in and interrogated her. She told him everything she knew, revealing Zhang Dajiang's room.

Li Xian found the location and kicked open the door. Zhang Dajiang, given to debauchery, was indeed in the midst of his pleasure. His eyes were covered with a black silk strip, his hands groping around as he laughed lewdly, "Beauty... where are you~ Don't let me catch you... hehe~"

Li Xian felt utter disgust. Zhang Dajiang's fingers were rough, his palms calloused, but the calluses showed signs of fading. Wang Cuicui's words were true; Zhang Dajiang was originally an ordinary farmer who was招婿 (married into the family) and gradually lost his nature, indulging in wine, women, and lust.

Li Xian suddenly felt a sense of self-mockery. "In matters of indulgence, I have no right to judge him. But his actions—plotting for wealth and life, forgetting his roots, and bullying the weak—make me despise him."

He took two steps forward, using the "Miao Yun Shou" (Wonderful Cloud Hand) to strike Zhang Dajiang's pressure points. He grabbed his neck and flipped out the window. Li Xian stepped on the roof tiles, traversing the rooftops, quickly crossing several streets and alleys.

The courtesan felt a sudden gust of wind. When she looked left and right, the room was empty, only the window left open.

The Wang family mansion was quiet, with a faint candlelight in the hall.

Wen Caixang sat quietly in the hall. Catching sight of Li Xian, a smile appeared on her face. "My husband handling such a small matter is naturally extremely easy."

Wang Cuicui, seeing the matter was resolved, was extremely excited. She was both respectful and fearful of Wen Caixang, unable to express her gratitude. She knelt and kowtowed repeatedly. "Mis... Mistress... thank you so much, thank you so much. I thought the world was full of people in cahoots, but I didn't expect there to be such good people as you and your husband!"

"Good people?" Wen Caixang sneered. "I am not. Hmph, my husband has a easy-going nature and was willing to help you, but I won't allow you to look at him. Otherwise, I'll gouge your eyes out."

Wang Cuicui's face turned pale, terrified. Seeing Wen Caixang's extreme beauty, she also sensed a cold, ruthless aura. She vaguely understood that if it weren't for her husband's easy-going nature, Wen Caixang would be an extremely difficult person to get along with.

Li Xian jumped into the hall. Wen Caixang's expression softened instantly, like ice and snow melting, as sweet as honey. Wang Cuicui patted her chest lightly, slightly relieved. But remembering the earlier "threat," she dared not look at Li Xian. Her eyes wandered until they landed on "Zhang Dajiang," then fixed on him.

Li Xian undid the pressure points and threw Zhang Dajiang to the ground. "Take off the black cloth," he said.

Zhang Dajiang let out an "Aiyo" as he fell. His knees were red and swollen, his clothes disheveled, truly a disgrace. Wen Caixang crossed her legs, glanced at Zhang Dajiang once, and then couldn't be bothered to look again, her eyes all on Li Xian.

Zhang Dajiang tore off the black silk strip. Still reeking of alcohol, he staggered to his feet. When his vision cleared, he first saw the shapely figure of Wen Caixang sitting there. He immediately giggled, "What a beauty... how did I... end up at your feet? Could it be that you..."

Li Xian's mind was steady. Although Wang Cuicui's story was tragic, he had remained skeptical. But seeing Zhang Dajiang's debauchery now, he was certain that ninety percent of Wang Cuicui's words were true. Hearing Zhang Dajiang's wild talk, Li Xian's heart filled with anger, and he kicked out.

A "crack" sound echoed as Zhang Dajiang's hand bone shattered. Wen Caixang clapped her hands lightly, looking very pleased. She loved it when Li Xian stood up for her.

Li Xian said, "Zhang Dajiang, you should take a good look at this person." Zhang Dajiang cried out in pain, his drunkenness completely sobering up. He glanced at Wang Cuicui and let out a wail, shouting "Ghost!" as he scrambled backward into a corner.

Li Xian said, "Miss Wang, how do you want to deal with him? This scoundrel took your life and plotted to swallow your property. Killing or carving him up is justified by heaven."

Wang Cuicui lowered her head and thanked him repeatedly. She heeded Wen Caixang's words and never looked at Li Xian. She stepped forward quickly and slapped Zhang Dajiang across the face twice.

The sound was fierce. Wang Cuicui gritted her teeth, kicking and punching to vent her hatred. Zhang Dajiang, in pain, seeing that Wang Cuicui wasn't dead, suddenly flew into a rage and lunged at her, only to be kicked away by Li Xian again.

Wang Cuicui hated Zhang Dajiang to the core. She borrowed a long sword and stabbed him several times. Blood pooled on the ground. Zhang Dajiang knelt and apologized, sincerely admitting his mistakes, finally terrified. Wang Cuicui, even more enraged, beheaded him with one sword stroke.

Blood stained the hall.

Li Xian wrapped the body in coarse cloth. He slipped into the city's government office, hung the body at the entrance, and used the sword as a pen to write the crimes on the body.

He also wrote a letter to intimidate the local county magistrate, demanding that he吐出 (hand over) the stolen treasures to provide Wang Cuicui with a place to live.

By the time these matters were settled, the sky was beginning to lighten. Li Xian and Wen Caixang had been drifting for days and rarely entered a city. They found a tea shop outside the government office, ordered some tea, and watched the rising sun and the increasing flow of people.

The crowd was bustling.

The government office was surrounded by pedestrians, pointing and discussing. Zhang Dajiang's body hung there, his clothes stripped clean. The local county magistrate, seeing this gruesome sight, was so scared his legs went weak.

How could he dare to investigate?

Fearing that Wang Cuicui had a powerful backer, he visited her that very day with heavy gifts to慰问 (offer condolences). He retried the old case and cleared her name.

Li Xian also despised this county magistrate. But officials in the court had complex family connections behind them, and killing one would be very troublesome. Li Xian wasn't afraid of trouble, but after fleeing with Wen Caixang for months, he ultimately sought stability.

All matters were concluded.

Li Xian and Wen Caixang returned to the painted boat. Without outsiders to disturb them, the boat drifted slowly, and the warmth and affection grew again.

[Sun Sword Sheath, Proficiency of Waning Sun Blood Sword +1]

[Brave Charge, Sheath Complete, Proficiency +1]

Their spirits soared, day and night blurred. Only when the boat drifted out of the reeds and occasional游船 (pleasure boats) appeared on the river did they slightly restrain themselves.

Li Xian, always suppressed, having reversed the order and proven his worth, vented all his previous grievances. He was restless all day, making Wen Caixang complain endlessly, yet she enjoyed it.

Thus, a solitary boat drifted.

With a beauty by his side.

Endless joy.

One day, the wind and rain temporarily ceased. Li Xian suddenly came to his senses, looking at the blue waves and thinking: "I was able to step onto the path of martial arts because the Mistress valued me. With such love between us, could I... could I betray her?"

"I... though I yearn for the vast sky and wide sea. If the Mistress's affection is true, how could I betray her? I... my situation is such that I can no longer be a playboy. Well, staying together forever is not bad either."

He deeply appreciated Wen Caixang's honey-like tenderness. Though lust could be克制 (restrained), true feelings made him unable to betray her. The boat drifted gently, Li Xian's mind open and broad, he held Wen Caixang to enjoy the scenery.

Wen Caixang occasionally broke free from the sweetness and felt a great panic. The indescribable anxiety made her temper strange. Sometimes she scolded Li Xian, but every time she spoke harshly, she would regret it and apologize humbly.

She was extremely skilled at calculating interests. Because she demanded "perfection" and was incredibly smart, she calculated interests clearly. When she handled matters, she was naturally reasonable and orderly.

However, in matters of emotion, the more she calculated, the more confused she felt, and the more she feared losing. Her usual principles of action failed here.

Thus, there was always an inexplicable fear and inexplicable frustration. She couldn't control it, yet she was deeply immersed in it, unable to extricate herself. The longer she interacted with Li Xian, the more this became the case. Only when practicing the "Three Layer Sword Art" daily could she forget all her worries.

But as the tide receded, the more joy she had, the deeper her fear grew. She had extensive knowledge and rich experience, but she was at a loss.

Far less carefree than Li Xian.

Li Xian was a playboy, but not necessarily promiscuous. If Wen Caixang bound him with love, Li Xian, who valued affection and nature, could indeed be firmly tied. But ironically... those involved were confused, and Wen Caixang was far from understanding this.

A river of water flows south.

Wen Caixang's heart was filled with love, depression, and fear. She thought of the past, and the trivial matters with Zhang Dajiang... "I love Li Lang so much. As long as he is by my side, I am extremely happy. His talent is too high, he tells too many lies, he is too much of a playboy, too full of spirit. If... if he surpasses me, and Li Lang wants to leave... can I... can I stop him?"

"If... if only he were the perfect companion. Ah! Just the perfect companion! He... he says he loves me and can do anything for me. I... if I make him gouge out his pupils, from then on, wouldn't he only see me? Even if he meets a more beautiful woman, he would only see me."

"It's a bit unfair to him, but... but I will spend my life making it up to him. I'll obey him in everything. Even if he hits or scolds me, I'll be happy."

Once this thought occurred, it became harder to restrain. She no longer knew moderation. Her heart pounded with excitement. She thought she had found a foolproof plan, and the panic immediately dissipated. She thought: "Li Lang would risk his life for me. What are a pair of eyes? I... I really have no other way. To use such a drastic measure, I have to hurt his body, and I feel terrible about it. But if I don't do this, I..."

In the middle of the night, the painted boat swayed gently, the spring water rippled. Her voice was charming and酥骨 (bone-softening). "Li Lang... do you love me very much?"

Li Xian said, "Of course. Mistress, why do you ask this suddenly?" Wen Caixang said, "Will you leave me?"

Li Xian paused for a moment and said sincerely and seriously, "I... I will not escape. I will always be with you." Wen Caixang was delighted. "Good, good... you will do anything for me?"

Li Xian thought: "That depends on the situation. I'm not stupid." But in this atmosphere, telling the whole truth would ruin the mood, so he said insincerely, "Of course. How dare I not obey the Mistress's words?"

Wen Caixang's joy was immense, her heart wrapped in sugar and honey. She hugged Li Xian repeatedly and said, "Then... then if I ask you to gouge out your pupils for me, would you be willing?"

Li Xian said, "Mistress, you are joking." Wen Caixang said, "I'm not joking, Li Lang. I love you so much. You... you will gouge out your pupils for me, won't you?"

"From then on, I will serve you well. I will teach you superior martial arts. You... whatever you want, I will give you. Good husband..."

Hearing that Wen Caixang was not joking, Li Xian's expression changed slightly. He did value affection and righteousness greatly. The idea of leaving the manor had faded. He was willing to give up freedom to be with her sincerely. But this matter made him think differently:

"Why does the Mistress want me to gouge out my eyes? I treat her sincerely. Why... why does she always want to hurt me?"

His love suddenly cooled. He thought of the events in the manor. In Wen Caixang's hands, Li Xian had schemed and calculated just to survive.

He couldn't help but wonder how Wen Caixang viewed him. If she saw him as a lover, why would she force him to gouge out his eyes? If she saw him as an object, what use would it be to keep him by her side?

Passion was like fire, but cold water was suddenly poured on it. He found it hard to understand the complexity of Wen Caixang's heart. He only thought that Wen Caixang had never changed, filled with coldness, indifference, and calculation.

He was naturally open-minded, but he was still hurt.

"Perhaps from the beginning to the end, it was just my own assumption that my relationship with Wen Caixang was good. But she only did this to practice the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword. In that way... everything makes sense. She asked me to gouge out my eyes, not because she loves me, but because she treats me as a tool to be used."

"Mistress, Mistress... if we calculate it this way. I have repaid all the favors. I no longer owe you anything."

Li Xian smiled. "Of course... Mistress, I am very willing. When we return to the manor, I will gouge out my eyes for you. Otherwise, on the remaining journey, I won't be able to protect you."

Wen Caixang was overjoyed. "Good... good husband, obedient husband." She was immersed in joy and didn't see Li Xian's abnormality.

Li Xian was tired that night. After Wen Caixang fell asleep from exhaustion, he sat alone on the deck of the boat, thinking deeply all night.

He also felt sad. His will was strong, but he was always manipulated and used. Li Xian picked up a small stone from the boat and threw it into the river, skipping it across the water.

"If I stay by the Mistress's side any longer, I will be no different from Commander Pang and Qiuyue. I, a poor boy, happened to climb up. The Mistress is skilled in calculation, how could she truly favor me? The tender facade made me confused. I... I should leave."

"But for the remaining short journey, I will send the Mistress off one last time. Have a beginning and an end. And escaping the Mistress will require careful planning."

Li Xian suppressed his sadness, returned to the room, and slept soundly. He smelled Wen Caixang's hair fragrance, his expression complex. On the remaining journey, Wen Caixang suspected nothing else. She was completely devoted to Li Xian, serving him well, never disobeying. Li Xian smiled in response, but a rift had already formed.

This day.

As the boat drifted south along the river, it was about to leave Qiong Tian Prefecture. The two docked ashore. Wen Caixang said, "Li Lang, do not destroy this painted boat. When we return to the manor, I will have someone carve a lake and place this boat in it. Whenever we feel like it, we can ride this boat together."

Her expression hid shyness and joy. The journey on the water was not enough for her.

Li Xian suddenly felt: "In the Mistress's eyes, I am no different from this boat." He said, "Alright."

They stayed for a day, moving the boat into the reed marshes. They spread "mugwort" to repel insects and covered the boat.

Wen Caixang's legs were sore and weak. When walking, she leaned to the side. Because they had been intimate wildly on the boat, they missed the shore crossing. There was still a distance to Qingning County.

The two hurried along the road, yet they still indulged in passion. Camping in the wild, staying in inns... Wen Caixang became increasingly dependent, her affection pouring out. She felt the scenery along the way and other people were so碍眼 (annoying) and noisy.

If only everything could disappear, leaving only the two of them, to fully reveal their affection.

She clung to him tightly. As soon as Li Xian practiced martial arts a little, she would wrap herself around him again.

[Waning Sun Blood Sword · Third Layer]

[Proficiency: 4569/8000 (Minor Accomplishment)]

Li Xian's progress was incredibly fast, all trained through "real swords and spears." The Yin-Yang baptism brought him immense benefit.

Wen Caixang had been skilled in calculation since childhood. Reward and punishment were measured, martial arts cultivation, profound knowledge... Her achievements today were all related to her nature and talent. But when it came to measuring emotions, she always struggled to get it right.

She rewarded when angry, punished when happy... there were signs of this early on. Asking Li Xian to gouge out his eyes was not actually a calculation of interests. It was because she was so deeply immersed that she completely didn't know what to do, a reckless策 (plan) driven by many factors.

They traveled for several more days.

They arrived at "Huangshan Town." Thirty miles west was "Qingning County." Wen Caixang was sweating fragrantly, her legs sore and waist weak, so she didn't rush the journey.

They found an inn in the town to stay for the night. Huangshan Town was remote and poor. The inn room was narrow and cramped. The wooden bed was very unstable. When the two lay on it together, it made "creaking" and "creaking" strange noises.

Li Xian smiled. "Mistress, bear with it for one night. We'll be at the One Union Manor tomorrow."

Wen Caixang said, "Husband~ thank you for this journey. Once we reach the One Union Manor, this matter will be settled. Hmph, that so-called Sword Seeking Alliance, they came aggressively, but what can they do to you and me?"

"After I dissolve the蛊虫 (poison worm), we will rest and recover for a few years. We... we will take the original route back. Then we will visit them one by one to seek justice. Vent all our anger. Good husband... is that good?"

Li Xian said, "It's a pity that by then, I won't be able to see anything."

Wen Caixang felt heartache and pity, extremely reluctant. She almost said several times that gouging out the eyes wasn't necessary, just love me well. But a vague worry always lingered, and she suppressed it. "Good husband, it's okay. I... I will serve you forever. The Buddhist sect has a martial art called 'Mind's Eye'... I will accompany you there then and ask that old monk for it."

She was overflowing with tenderness, massaging Li Xian's shoulders and back. Li Xian said, "Mistress, let's sleep well."

They whispered and practiced sword moves. They exhausted Wen Caixang until she was physically and mentally tired. Even on the simple wooden bed, she could sleep soundly.

Li Xian gently checked her breathing. Wen Caixang had no guard, so she slept deeply. Li Xian thought about his escape plan and took out rice paper to write a letter.

Li Xian thought: "Since the favor is settled, I should just be honest."

He dipped the brush in ink and wrote a few words. He couldn't help but mock himself. His calligraphy was also taught by Wen Caixang. Li Xian sighed:

"My martial arts... ninety-nine percent are related to the Mistress. If I leave her, I won't even have [Essence Treasures] to consume. Martial arts manuals, money and treasures, connections... I have none. But how can I not leave?"

He wrote:

"To Mistress Wen."

"I apologize for suddenly saying goodbye. The favor is cleared, staying is pointless. Li Xian bids farewell. In the vast world of rivers and lakes, let's meet again if fate allows."

The handwriting was clear and crisp. He wanted to express his grievances but feared it would make Wen Caixang mock him. So he kept it brief and expressed his intent directly.

Li Xian folded the letter. Seeing Wen Caixang's alluring body, he had never seen such a woman in his life. Ruthless, cold, seductive... contrary to his nature, but very charming.

"With weak strength, I can only do this. When my strength grows in the future, I might visit the One Union Manor again."

Li Xian muttered softly. He felt complex emotions. He drifted, his heart had no home. He was about to leave again, not knowing where to go.

He folded the letter and put it in his pocket. He took out the Heaven and Earth Box, which contained the "Ancestor Silkworm."

Li Xian said, "Some favors can be repaid, some are hard to repay. But since I'm leaving, let's clear everything. From Wen Caixang's perspective of interests, I indeed owe her nothing."

He saw the Ancestor Silkworm sleeping in the box, closed it again, climbed onto the wooden bed, and slept.

The next day.

The rooster crowed, and the slanting sun entered the room.

Li Xian and Wen Caixang had rested well and felt refreshed. Li Xian's face was as usual. He helped her braid her long hair. During these days on the boat, Wen Caixang had taught Li Xian how to braid her hair.

Whenever they braided her hair, it always ended up messy again.

Today, they braided a "Cloud Bun." It was dignified and luxurious, decorated with silver hairpins and pearls. Her pretty face was charming, with willow eyebrows and vermilion lips, truly beautiful.

Wen Caixang looked in the mirror and smiled. "Husband, your braiding skill is not worse than Qiuyue's." Li Xian said, "My technique is crude. It's just that you are as beautiful as a fairy. Anything looks good no matter how I mess it up."

Wen Caixang smiled. "You have a slick tongue." Li Xian said, "We can reach the manor today."

Wen Caixang nodded. "Yes. Time flies. When I first left the manor to attend the Dragon Appreciation Banquet, I was confident. I didn't expect so many twists and turns on this trip. Fortunately, you were with me, allowing me to pass through dangers repeatedly."

Li Xian said, "Let's have some breakfast and then return to the manor."

Wen Caixang said softly, "Husband... you decide. I will listen to everything you say. If you want to go elsewhere for a couple more days, I will accompany you."

Li Xian smiled. "We've played for long enough." He helped Wen Caixang downstairs. The town street was lively, with carriages and ox carts hurrying by.

Huangshan Town had a famous breakfast called "Oil-Poured Spicy Powder." It involved grinding coarse grains into powder, sprinkling chili powder, and pouring a layer of hot oil over it. It was eaten with some vegetables.

Li Xian and Wen Caixang found a small stall, ordered two servings of spicy powder, and a portion of hot tofu. The ordinary stall was filled with common people. Li Xian and Wen Caixang had extraordinary demeanor, instantly attracting everyone's attention and gasps of admiration.

Wen Caixang knew Li Xian had an easy-going nature. Although she despised the environment here, having Li Xian by her side made her extremely happy. She rolled up her sleeves and tasted the folk food. The taste was average, very heavy, but it was very filling.

When she felt greasy, she took a bite of the cool tofu to remove the oiliness. The people of Huangshan Town were already used to it.

Some regular customers could even eat it in various ways. They would ask for some scallions, garlic... paying a few extra copper coins to get more meat shreds and slices.

Hungry, one bite down. The pleasure was indescribable. Li Xian ate very happily. He had been to Huangshan Town before to sell animal fur.

Ordinary hunters would hunt wild beasts in the mountains. They would store the fur from the beasts. When they accumulated enough, they would secretly sell it.

Li Xian had come to sell furs. He earned some money and, in high spirits, ate a bowl of oil-poured spicy powder. The taste was still remembered to this day.

Li Xian paid the bill. It was still early, the warm sun was high in the sky. Wen Caixang said, "Li Lang, there is still some money here. You can use it."

She took a pouch from her sleeve containing a dozen or so taels of gold. Li Xian said, "We have been out of the manor for a long time. We were very miserable along the way. It's better to buy a carriage and ride it back for the remaining journey."

"So the people in the manor won't notice anything. It would be a loss of the Mistress's face if we were seen fleeing in a panic."

Wen Caixang was delighted. "Husband, you are very good, thinking very thoroughly."

Li Xian found a horse shop. He bought a wide carriage. Wen Caixang shook the carriage lightly. Seeing that the material was average but the mortise and tenon joints were firm and very shock-resistant, she was pleased.

Li Xian paid for the carriage and helped Wen Caixang into the cabin. Wen Caixang lifted the curtain and said, "Shopkeeper, do you have a driver?"

Li Xian said, "Why do we need a driver? I am the Mistress's driver." Wen Caixang glared at him, thinking: "If you drive the carriage, who will accompany me? It would be boring to sit alone in the cabin."

The shopkeeper gathered some drivers. Wen Caixang scanned them and picked an elderly driver. "It's you. Li Lang, give the shopkeeper one tael of gold as the rental fee for the driver."

They prepared the carriage and horses.

The elderly driver skillfully drove the horse, moving smoothly along the street. Soon, they left Huangshan Town and traveled on a mountain road.

Wen Caixang lifted the curtain and asked softly, "Old Uncle, how old are you?" The driver said, "Sixty-seven... Master, you can rest assured. I used to be a groom for a wealthy family. Later, I bought my freedom and helped people pull carts and raise horses. My driving skills are top-notch. I guarantee a stable and smooth ride to your destination."

Wen Caixang smiled. "Thank you. This is the reward, please take it." She casually threw a pouch.

The driver opened the pouch and saw a dozen or so taels of gold. Converted, it was over a hundred taels of silver. An ordinary person could hardly save that much in a lifetime.

The driver was shocked. "Master... you... you... aren't you..." He was too stunned to speak.

Wen Caixang smiled faintly. "This money is not easy to take. I need to ruin your ears, making you deaf. Are you willing?" The driver hesitated for a moment, picked up the gold and rubbed it. He thought that at his age, to get such a windfall was truly rare. Being deaf or having tinnitus was nothing. "Then... that's fine."

Wen Caixang flipped her sleeve and drew her sword. The soft sword was like a spirit snake, its blade flickering, piercing the ear canals. The driver only felt a "buzz," his ears went numb, and two lines of blood flowed out. He realized the pain later and could no longer hear external sounds.

He sighed lightly and tied the gold pouch tightly. He held it firmly in his hand, muttering, "Hehe, this pouch is valuable too!" He hid it inside his clothes against his skin.

Li Xian wanted to say something but stopped. Wen Caixang closed the curtain and leaned into Li Xian's arms,娇喜 (charming and happy). "Li Lang... this way, no one will disturb us. He can't hear."

Li Xian smiled. "Mistress, you are so bold." Wen Caixang scolded, "You小子 (little rascal), don't I know you? Your bad nature is even bolder."

The carriage raced through the wilderness.

The driver held the reins, looking ahead, unable to hear. He felt this mountain road was very bumpy, but fortunately, he drove well.

Several hours later.

They entered the official road. The number of vehicles and horses along the way increased, and the road became smoother.

Li Xian lifted the curtain and saw they had arrived at Ziqiong County. Seeing the familiar road conditions, he felt a mix of emotions.

Wen Caixang leaned against his shoulder, her face still slightly red. She glanced at the scenery outside the window with no interest.

Another three-quarters of an hour passed. The outline of the One Union Manor could be seen. After months away, the manor was as before. Wen Caixang had long been preparing to move the manor. The land and shops had all been sold.

Li Xian said, "Old Uncle, stop here. You can walk back by yourself." He secretly used his internal energy, a buzzing sound, vaguely conveying his meaning to the old man.

The driver nodded repeatedly and jumped off the carriage to run away, afraid that Li Xian would take back the gold. Li Xian thought: "I will try to escape later, and it will inevitably involve the innocent. It's better to drive him away first."

Li Xian held the reins and drove towards the side gate of the One Union Manor. This gate led directly to the inner courtyard, so there were few servants and guards.

Li Xian said, "Ah! Mistress... I prepared a big surprise for you, but I forgot it in Huangshan Town!"

Wen Caixang smiled lightly. "You husband, it's okay, it's okay. It's the thought that counts." Li Xian said, "No... my intention cannot be wasted like this."

Wen Caixang said helplessly, "What do you want to do? Go back the same way?" Li Xian said, "Since we are already at the manor, and you have been tired from the journey, I feel heartache. I am rough and don't know my limits, and I hurt you again. Why don't you enter the manor and rest first?"

Wen Caixang heard the word "rough," her pretty face flushed. She thought: "You little rascal, bringing this up again, deliberately making me blush. You are not rough, you are full of bad ideas."

She heard Li Xian's considerate words, how could she bear to refuse. Plus, returning to the manor, her mind relaxed, and she said reluctantly, "Alright, you must come back quickly."

Li Xian said, "Okay!" He took out a Heaven and Earth Box from his chest and said, "Mistress, this thing is yours. Now that we are back at the manor, please keep it safe."

Wen Caixang was filled with tenderness, how could she think of anything else. She thought Li Xian respected and loved her, returning the item.

Wen Caixang put it in her sleeve, thinking: "Mine is yours. Between you and me, why do we need to distinguish between yours and mine? I calculate interests with outsiders, but how could I calculate with you?" She said, "You little rascal, speaking of this, I haven't settled the score with you."

"You... you were so fierce to me at the time, making me so angry."

Li Xian said, "When I return, I will accept any scolding from the Mistress." Wen Caixang said softly, "I haven't blamed you for a long time, Li Lang... I really can't bear to part with you. Let me go with you. I want to see what trick you are up to first."

Li Xian said, "Mistress, if you go with me, the surprise will become a shock. I... I also hate to part with the Mistress, but alas, alas... that's how things are."

He sighed inwardly.

Wen Caixang leaned on him for a while, watching Li Xian ride the carriage away, and watched for a long time. Her heart felt vaguely empty. Just this moment, it was already unbearable. She took a few steps forward.

Suddenly, a voice sounded: "Mistress!"

Ding Hu, hearing the noise, came to patrol. "Mistress, is that carriage trespassing? I will send someone to chase it."

Wen Caixang said淡淡ly (coldly), "No need. Don't disturb him, otherwise I will punish you severely." She looked at the carriage, and her expression was full of tenderness again.

Having just tasted that flavor.

Uncle Xiang hurried over. "Mistress! You have finally returned!"

Wen Caixang turned and entered the manor, waving her sleeve lightly. Ding Hu and the other guards retreated. Uncle Xiang followed behind, bowing and stooping, very respectful.

Wen Caixang walked with light steps, like a swimming dragon, and entered a flower garden. She plucked a flower casually and sniffed it at the tip of her nose. The fragrance was long. She usually liked to grow flowers, but her interest had shifted. Seeing the flowers in full bloom, competing for beauty... she no longer had the elegance.

Her heart was full of thoughts about Li Xian's surprise. At the same time, she worried about "gouging out the pupils." She trusted that lover, but she was afraid of hurting his body after gouging out his eyes. She felt both pained and conflicted.

Uncle Xiang said, "Mistress, I heard the Dragon Appreciation Banquet ended long ago. Why... why have you returned so late?"

Wen Caixang said, "This Dragon Appreciation Banquet added many twists and turns. But the matter is over, and it's useless to talk about it now. You just need to know that I have returned to the manor safely and have gained greatly."

She opened the treasure box.

The Ancestor Silkworm crawled onto her finger. Wen Caixang thought of something and smiled, cursing, "Bold." She gently played with the Ancestor Silkworm and muttered, "These past few days, you have indeed suffered. Don't blame me for not helping you."

Uncle Xiang was very surprised. He vaguely felt that Wen Caixang had changed a lot. Her brows were relaxed, her lips red and cheeks pink... but he couldn't say exactly what.

Wen Caixang said, "How is the preparation for moving the manor?"

Uncle Xiang said, "Very smooth. Mistress, where are we moving to? But because of the sudden move, many properties are hard to handle clearly. Some properties were sold at a low price inevitably."

"It's fine." Wen Caixang said, "I stayed here for the Dragon Appreciation Banquet. Now that the banquet is over, I naturally need to change places. And my whereabouts have been exposed. If I stay here, although I am not afraid of enemies finding me, constant harassment would ruin my mood."

Uncle Xiang didn't dare to ask more and was very respectful. Wen Caixang looked inward at herself. The "Food Qi Gu" (Eater of Qi Gu) was attached to her Qi Lake. She needed to deal with it immediately. She said, "Uncle Xiang, immediately help me prepare 'Yang Fire Stone' and 'Moonfall Silver'..." She listed eighteen types of strange minerals.

Then she detailed nineteen types of rare herbs. They were priceless, and their medicinal properties were mixed. Wen Caixang was proficient in pharmacology, and her method of compounding was strange.

The manor had countless treasures. Uncle Xiang didn't dare to be negligent and fetched them one by one. Wen Caixang dismissed Uncle Xiang and arranged the strange minerals into a formation.

Then she compounded the various herbs and boiled them to make a medicinal bath. She undressed and suddenly her expression wavered.

She thought: "I haven't practiced the Silkworm Clothes Jade Skill for a long time. Now that I have this relationship with Li Lang, if I can't move, wouldn't... wouldn't it be even more letting him do whatever he wants? I..."

Her pretty face flushed. In her embarrassment, she couldn't say how much she looked forward to it. The joy of men and women, she wanted to explore all its wonders with him.

From the "Yin-Yang Baptism," she understood why the "Food Qi Gu" was so powerful. The human body is like heaven and earth, and internal energy is mysterious, with various theories.

That day, the Yin-Yang was chaotic. The Food Qi Gu drank the energy slowly, causing a trace of internal energy to remain in Wen Caixang's Qi Lake. After the baptism, the Food Qi Gu returned to normal and drank that trace of internal energy completely.

Wen Caixang already knew that the "Food Qi Gu" was related to the Five Elements and Yin-Yang. The "Food Qi Gu" was renamed "Transform Qi Gu." Wen Caixang's internal energy was surging and had undergone several transformations.

With a single gu worm drinking for a long time, it should have burst long ago. The Food Qi Gu was small but had five feet and two heads.

The two heads were Yin and Yang, the five feet were the Five Elements. Attached to the Qi Lake, it secretly followed the principles of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements, dissolving the internal energy. Others who were poisoned didn't know the true mechanism of the gu worm, only saying that this gu ate human internal energy.

Thus it was called "Food Qi Gu."

That day, the Yin-Yang was chaotic, and the Food Qi Gu was infected, slowing its transformation speed. This allowed Wen Caixang to keenly detect an opportunity. She had already thought of how to resolve it during the journey.

This attempt was indeed very effective.

The Food Qi Gu was gradually suppressed. In Wen Caixang's Qi Lake, a small pool of water gradually accumulated. Wen Caixang was very pleased and said, "Old bastard, even if you threatened my life, this evil gu has been solved by me."

The Food Qi Gu was very stubborn. It still attached to the Qi Lake and drank the internal energy. But Wen Caixang knew the principle, and the manor had many treasures, enough to deal with the gu worm.

She focused her mind on research, using natural treasures to "fight" the gu worm.

Li Xian drove the carriage away from the manor. He let out a light breath of turbid air, both worried and happy, his emotions complex and hard to describe.

"Leaving secretly last night was the safest plan. But I... dragged until today to walk the last journey with the Mistress."

"Indeed... I have a beginning and an end, sending the Buddha to the west, sending the Mistress home. I was afraid that on these dozens of miles, there would be another twist."

"But... at the bottom of my heart, the Mistress is different from others. I admire her knowledge, fear her strength, desire her tenderness, and lust for her body... alas, the affairs of the world are hard to clarify. If I escape like this, the Mistress... the Mistress will probably hunt me down."

"I have escaped the tiger's den only to enter the wolf's lair. I hope the Mistress's internal energy is fully gone and she needs a few days to deal with it. And I hope that as a little servant, I am not worth the Mistress personally making a move."

Li Xian leaned against the carriage. Looking into the distance, the sky was blue as if washed, with no clouds for miles. He smelled the lingering fragrance of hair on his clothes. He lifted the carriage curtain; there were still some water stains inside.

Several hours later.

The sky began to darken.

Li Xian returned to Huangshan Town and visited the inn where they stayed last night. He spent a few taels of silver to rent the same room.

He placed the letter on the table. Then he left under the cover of night.

Wen Caixang focused her mind on healing her injuries and dealing with the Food Qi Gu. The "Thunder Injury" and "Vajra Palm Injury" in her body, combined to form the "Brahma Sound Injury," and Li Quan's "Marrow Fixing Finger Injury" were solidified inside her.

She had fled all the way and had gradually grown accustomed to it.

Now that the situation was stable, the storms and thunderstorms had all passed. She looked at her body and couldn't help but laugh. "Such complex injuries, if it were anyone else, they would not have escaped disaster. Only Li Lang, with his outstanding intelligence and courage... saved me."

She couldn't help but feel very sweet. Recalling the taste of the journey, it was extremely dangerous at the time, her life hanging by a thread. But looking back, it had a unique flavor.

The injuries were solidified and couldn't be healed in a short time. She had profound knowledge and knew how to deal with them. Li Quan's "Marrow Fixing Finger" was the easiest to solve. Using a few rare treasures, it could be completely cured.

The "Vajra Brahma Sound" was very troublesome. It was a fusion of human power and heavenly might. Wen Caixang had Uncle Xiang bring a piece of music.

It was a "Tribute to Heaven Eternal Music" composed by a famous scholar during the Nanyang period. This piece could be played on a pipa. When it was激昂 (passionate), the sky would hum as if accompanying it.

It also belonged to the "Immortal Sound Music." It could be played with Immortal Sound. Wen Caixang was not skilled in the way of Immortal Sound, but that was only relative. She knew of this score but had never practiced it.

Now she played it. The Immortal Sound lingered in the room,久久不散 (lingering for a long time). There was a gurgling stream and red flowers and leaves in the inner courtyard. The melody drifted, and the stream rose with mist, the flowers bloomed with halos.

It was indescribably beautiful.

Wen Caixang played the Immortal Sound, her long hair slightly suspended. She was ethereal like a fairy in the mist. The "Vajra Brahma Sound" in her body was gradually divided, turning back into Vajra Palm power and Thunder killing power.

She immediately used a method to weaken the palm power and weaken the Thunder killing power. In this way, the long-standing injuries were broken one by one.

Food Qi Gu, Marrow Fixing Finger, Vajra Palm, Thunder killing power... all were greatly weakened. In a few more days, they would be no threat. Wen Caixang would naturally return to her peak.

When she came to her senses, it was already evening.

Wen Caixang called Uncle Xiang and said sternly, "Didn't I say that if Li Xian returns, let him come to see me and don't stop him?"

Uncle Xiang said confusedly, "But... but Mistress, Li Xian hasn't returned."

Wen Caixang was stunned. She glanced at the sky, knowing that the round trip would take time. But it was already evening, and it was taking too long.

She thought: "Could it be... that Li Lang has encountered danger?" She should have easily thought that Li Xian might have fled. But she had been tender every day. Even on the most dangerous journey, Li Xian had refused to leave her.

Now that they had finally returned to the manor, how could she imagine that Li Xian would leave? She was so gentle she couldn't control herself, and she thought Li Xian was the same. But the obvious truth was hard for her to grasp.

Wen Caixang's injuries had recovered by ten percent. The Food Qi Gu was frustrated, and its transformation speed had sharply decreased. Her Qi Lake had accumulated ten percent of internal energy, and she felt vaguely uneasy:

"No, I need to go find him."

How could she sit still? She immediately prepared a horse and set out overnight.
