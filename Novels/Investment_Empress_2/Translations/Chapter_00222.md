# Chapter 222: Seven Stars Zhou Tian, System Ranking Countdown (1/2)

Inside the courtyard residence.

A circle of scorched marks had appeared around the area where the alchemy furnace was placed.

By the time Elder Xue and Senior Brother Xiaobao arrived, Li Mo had already prepared the medicinal herbs needed for today, some of which were meant to be given to Elder Xue.

Even with Senior Brother Xiaobao’s assistance, practicing the External Alchemy technique was far more mentally taxing than refining ordinary pills.

“Elder Xue, you’ve worked hard these past few days.”

Li Mo noticed a hint of exhaustion between the elder’s brows.

“The External Alchemy technique was my own idea to begin with.”

Xue Jing organized the herbs and said somewhat irritably, “But having me continue refining external pills... it really is a bit too much to handle.”

“This is temporarily the last time.”

“Temporarily? Seven aren’t enough?”

Xue Jing raised an eyebrow.

Although their External Alchemy technique was temporarily successful, and Li Mo could afford the cost, this was just too reckless!

After a moment of contemplation, Xue Jing said, “Xuandan must be controlled properly to complement each other; otherwise, they will interfere with one another, doing more harm than good. You must grasp this balance yourself.”

“You make a good point.”

Before Li Mo, six Xuandan floated, their light restrained and their colors varying. The aura of each Xuandan required the maintenance of his Intent Soul to operate normally without conflict.

If not for the special Divine Intent he observed, it would have been difficult even for a Nine Aperture Observation Deity to achieve the coexistence of seven Dan.

Seven Xuandan were likely the limit of the Observation Deity realm.

The *Zhou Tian Xing Dou Xuandan Sutra* was not something meant to be practiced at his current realm.

“Adjust your breathing.”

Xue Jing became much more serious, sitting to the side and closing his eyes to adjust his own state.

Surrounding Li Mo, the six Xuandan revolved while a wisp of clear brilliance gradually solidified, its serene and peaceful fluctuations calming the distracting thoughts in his heart.

The moonlight reflected off them.

As his mind sank inward, he found that the inscriptions on the small figure in his Dantian had become even more complex and mysterious, and compared to its initial childlike appearance, it seemed to have grown a little.

This was partly due to the treasures he had consumed, but it was also inseparable from the dual cultivation of the *Phoenix Singing in the Sky Marsh*...

He was currently progressing toward the Three Apertures of Observation Deity.

When that time comes, it will be much easier to go to Hengyun Sword City to copy the strange stones.

...

One hour later.

Inside the furnace where fierce flames raged, six Xuandan revolved around Li Mo, transmitting a wondrous fluctuation, like the movement of stars.

Not far away, the Dragon and Tiger Golden Dan transformed by Tang Xiaobao was also spinning rapidly.

With the help of Senior Brother Xiaobao, who was spinning so fast he was about to smoke, the aqua-colored Xuandan was almost formed.

Now, it was time to test Little Li.

For him, seven Xuandan were currently the absolute limit, the limit of his Intent Soul.

The balance was extremely delicate.

This meant that he had to be extremely careful to incorporate the Xuandan condensed from the *Raging Wave Force* into the trajectory of the Seven Stars’ operation.

Li Mo even broke out in a light sweat on his forehead, though it was instantly evaporated.

“Focus!”

Xue Jing’s voice came from outside the furnace.

Li Mo stared intently at the Xuandan, not even having the time to reply.

Three minutes later.

A wave of exhaustion, like a tide, surged forth, and Li Mo’s vision went slightly dark.

But in the end, he saw it clearly.

The Raging Wave Xuandan was incorporated into the cycle...

*Boom!*

The furnace lid flew exceptionally high this time.

However, the flames inside the furnace showed no sign of stopping.

Through the surging flames, Xue Jing’s anxious voice came again:

“Xiaobao, why isn’t he speaking? What’s wrong?”

The dizzy Tang Xiaobao stopped spinning.

“Master, Junior Brother Li... he fell asleep.”

“...Let’s look for the lid first.”

...

不知过了多久。

“Sleeping felt like...”

“...like I got beaten up.”

Li Mo slowly woke up. Outside, the wind and rain were dark, and he couldn’t tell what time it was.

---

He felt a bit uncomfortable, but his mind was still exhausted, so he couldn’t be bothered to think about the reason.

So, he directly took a set of pills for internal injuries, external injuries, and the Intent Soul.

The effect was immediate.

He took a slight look and saw that the seven Xuandan were all obediently circulating within his body, continuously swallowing and spitting out a massive amount of Heaven and Earth Primordial Qi.

His Intent Soul had also reached the Three Apertures.

“It’s more than just a little bit stronger than before...”

“And, I’ve gained another trump card for saving my life.”

Li Mo got up and did a set of broadcast calisthenics to move his body.

He was eager to try it out outside.

But considering that if he threw a punch, he might just fall asleep again...

Better not.

This Sky-Overturning Hammer, rather than mobilizing the power of the stars, is more like allowing him to mobilize the power of the World Seed to a greater extent.

...

Li Mo walked out of the room and received some bad news—it wasn’t mealtime.

Chu Long was cleaning the main hall, tidying up useful things.

Ying Bing, on the other hand, was practicing for once, sitting there with her brow slightly furrowed.

*Gurgle—*

Little Li, who had just sat down to drink tea, let out an untimely growl from his stomach.

Then he heard the second piece of bad news.

“Are you hungry?” Ying Bing asked.

Li Mo: “......”

Saying he wasn’t hungry would be ridiculous.

Saying he was hungry, he was afraid Ying Bing would reply, ‘I’ll make something for you.’

He had no idea where this Ice Cube got her interest in cooking...

“Ahem... I want to eat Donkey Meat Buns, there’s a place right across the street.”

Little Li thought quickly.

“I... I’ll go buy them...”

Jiang Chulong left the main hall and went out to Yulong Street.

Li Mo sighed in relief and looked at the girl opposite him.

She seemed to be in poor condition today... She didn’t go to the Sword City to lecture, nor did she practice...

He suddenly remembered.

It was the end of the month.

This time period was when the Ice Cube’s emotions were off; it should also be when she had her period...

“If you really feel unwell, I have a method.”

“Hmm?”

Ying Bing put down her teacup, a hint of confusion in her eyes.

She had been looking at the system countdown.

Today was the last day of the system ranking, which is why she hadn’t gone to Hengyun Sword City.

Unwell?

“What method?” she asked casually.

“Acupressure massage to relax the muscles and meridians. Would you like to try it, Miss?”

Li Mo’s expression was serious.

He could just not use the messy moves from the *Flicking Flower Finger*; the effect would be weaker, but that was fine.

But even if incomplete, it was still a supreme martial art.

It contained acupoints to relieve menstrual pain...

Hearing this.

Ying Bing’s eyelashes trembled slightly.

He...

Why was he bringing this up again?

Is he obsessed with this aspect?

And today of all days...

“Today... it’s not possible. We can talk about it later.”

“Alright then.”

Li Mo had planned to set up a few massage rooms on the upper floors of this restaurant.

After all, it was a supreme martial art; it shouldn’t be wasted. He could recruit some people and teach them a move or two.

And this restaurant could serve as the Qingyuan Sect’s base in Yunzhou; it was necessary to manage it.

When it reopens, the restaurant will offer food, drink, and entertainment all in one. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?

He decided to act immediately.

He called Xu Yi and went up to the third floor together.
