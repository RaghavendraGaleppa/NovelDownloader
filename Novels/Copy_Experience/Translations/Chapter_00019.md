# Chapter 19: Mid-grade Alchemist

Lu Xu didn't move, nor did Er Lengzi. It wasn't that Er Lengzi had suddenly seen the light and aspired to immortality; it was simply because he was too embarrassed. Er Lengzi was timid, normally too shy to speak to pretty girls. Now, suddenly being told to choose, how could he overcome his inner barrier? He had his eyes on several girls but just couldn't make a move. When he saw them being chosen by others, Er Lengzi was so anxious his heart ached, but he still couldn't take that step.

The Mo Family Patriarch was quite understanding. He gave a signal, and immediately, several bold Mo family women from the hall giggled and approached Lu Xu and the others. They knelt before the jade tables, held up wine cups, their eyes hazy, their bodies softly leaning against them. Their voices were charmingly seductive: "Young Master, let this humble one accompany you in drinking!" With a few leading the way, the group of Mo family women immediately surrounded the remaining male cultivators. Some poured wine and tea, some sang, some played the zither or flute, each displaying their talents. Who could resist such a spectacle?

In less than three minutes, Er Lengzi was crimson-faced, hunched over, and walked out supported by two Mo family beauties. Before leaving, he didn't forget to say, "Brother Lu, I've always dreamed of having a wife. Now that my dream is about to come true, I won't wait for you!" Lu Xu was speechless and raised a cup to him as a farewell. A cold aura emanated from him, intimidating most of the Mo family women from approaching. However, in the end, a strikingly beautiful and charming young woman approached him. She was quite bold, leaning against Lu Xu, as soft and boneless as a water snake. She picked up the wine pot, poured wine for Lu Xu, peeled a grape, and brought it to his lips. Lu Xu enjoyed her service, but no matter what methods she used, he absolutely refused to mention the matter of becoming a live-in son-in-law. The main goal was to enjoy the freebies!

But there were few with such firm resolve as him. Before long, seven or eight more male cultivators walked out of the hall, leaving fewer than thirty people remaining. Under the sugar-coated bombardment of the Mo family women, even knowing there might be a trap, many still jumped in with heated heads. Mortal women are mortal women, but at least they are beautiful, gentle, obedient, and sensible, right? Among the mid-grade spiritual root holders seated at the front, all but one older man in his thirties who walked out embracing two women remained unmoved. The Mo Family Patriarch couldn't help but frown at this scene. He knew the one who left; this person had been here once before.

However, last time, this person was resolute, wholeheartedly aspiring to immortality, and had no desire to be a live-in son-in-law. Now, ten years later, he couldn't hold out anymore. He saw the situation clearly and decisively yielded to the Mo family.

"They're all tough nuts to crack! It seems beauty alone won't sway these people; we'll have to offer some inducements!" the Mo Family Patriarch thought, stroking his chin. He clapped his hands and declared loudly: "Everyone, the first part of this gathering has concluded. Please follow these maids to meet some people!"

Meet people? What new trick was this? Various guesses flashed through Lu Xu's mind.

"Young Master, please follow this humble one!" The charming woman beside Lu Xu chuckled, took his hand, and led him out of the main hall. The two walked towards another palace in the distance.

"They're not going to force things, are they?" Lu Xu was startled and immediately didn't want to go. He wasn't afraid of sleeping with the woman. What he feared was the Mo family using this to force him into becoming a live-in son-in-law. As if sensing his worries, the charming woman quickly said: "Young Master, I'm just taking you to meet an elder. He has something to tell you!" Hearing this, Lu Xu somewhat eased his worries. On the Mo family's territory, worrying seemed useless; he could only comply.

A moment later, in a hall, a ruddy-faced old man appeared before Lu Xu.

"Haha, young friend, this old man is Mo Changyun, an elder of the Mo family. The girl who brought you in is my granddaughter!" The old man, seeing Lu Xu, enthusiastically introduced himself first.

"This junior, Lu Xu, a humble spirit farmer, greets Senior!" On the Mo family's territory, Lu Xu kept a very low profile.

"Haha, young friend, don't worry about anything. The Patriarch sent you to me because I can offer you better terms!" The old man chuckled, appearing exceptionally benevolent. "Let me be straightforward. This old man is one of the Mo family's only five alchemists! The Tier 1 Mid-grade Qi Nourishing Pill is this old man's most proficient elixir! This old man can promise you that as long as you become a live-in son-in-law of our family and bear a child whose spiritual root aptitude is no less than yours, I can give you four bottles of Qi Nourishing Pills as a reward!"

One bottle of Qi Nourishing Pills costs 150 spirit stones; four bottles would be 600 spirit stones. This was truly a hefty investment; how could an ordinary cultivator resist such temptation? Lu Xu, however, was not tempted in the slightest. He knew very well that while the elder's promise sounded good, how difficult would it be to actually achieve? A child with mid-grade spiritual roots was not easily conceived, and even if one could be, it might be decades later. And still, it would be with a mortal! The Mo family would absolutely not allow their female cultivators to marry these live-in sons-in-law; they would only marry within the family.

"Check!" Lu Xu had no mind to listen to the elder speak; instead, he silently chanted in his heart. After a flash of blue light, a line of text appeared before his eyes: [Tier 1 Mid-grade Alchemist: 47/100 (Triple)]

Without much hesitation, Lu Xu silently chanted "copy" in his heart. After a flash of blue light, countless knowledge and experiences related to alchemy poured into his mind. Lu Xu slightly lowered his head, feigning a diligent listener, but his eyes were already vacant. After a while, when he had digested the experience, the elder was still eloquently describing the benefits.

"Senior, this matter is truly too important. May I have some time to consider it carefully?" Lu Xu raised his head, a troubled expression on his face.

"What? You..." The old man's face turned cold. He understood Lu Xu's meaning; he was going to refuse.

"Hmph! Ungrateful!" The old man flicked his sleeve and turned away.

"This junior takes his leave!" Seeing this, Lu Xu quickly left the hall. He secretly rejoiced that the Mo family still adhered to rules and didn't resort to forced transactions.

After he left, a curtain on one side of the hall was drawn open, and the charming young woman walked out. "Grandfather!" she softly called out.

"This man doesn't know what's good for him. I couldn't convince him!" The old man's face was extremely cold, emanating a chill all over his body. The young woman appeared somewhat afraid, lowering her head and standing not far from him, not daring to speak further.

"A mere spirit farmer, daring to climb the path of immortality? Ridiculous! It seems he's had it too easy. We'll have to let him experience how difficult cultivation is; if he doesn't comply with our Mo family, he'll have no future! Go fetch your Uncle Yuancheng. I have ways to make this man willing to become a live-in son-in-law for our family in ten years!" the old man commanded coldly.

"Uncle Yuancheng? He's the captain of the patrol guard outside the market. Why would Grandfather need him?" Doubts flashed through the young woman's mind. But she didn't dare to ask more and quickly walked out.

Lu Xu walked back towards the main hall he had come from. After walking for a while, he suddenly saw a pavilion on a small artificial lake ahead, and within it, a figure in a black dress stood gracefully. Taking a glance, Lu Xu didn't want to get involved and quickly prepared to walk away. At this moment, the woman in the pavilion turned around.

"Are you the neighbor of He Qing, who was killed by the rogue cultivator?" The woman's clear, cold voice sounded.

"She actually remembers He Qing's name!" Lu Xu muttered in his heart.

"Fairy has a good memory. I am indeed He Qing's neighbor!"

"Please come over for a chat!" Lu Xu thought for a moment, then walked over and entered the pavilion. Spirit carp swam in the artificial lake, their scales shimmering with brilliant colors under the sunlight.

"You rogue cultivators often have more informed news than us Mo family members. In these past years, have you heard any noteworthy rumors in the market?"

"Related to rogue cultivators!" the woman in black added. Lu Xu noticed that the woman named Qingchan seemed to have a hint of worry in her eyes. What was she worried about?

"Fairy, that truly puts me in a difficult position. There are all sorts of rumors in the market; I genuinely don't know which ones are noteworthy!"

"Have you heard anything related to rogue cultivator organizations?" Lu Xu immediately recalled the news Yin Yu had told him. A few years ago, someone accidentally saw members of the Black Robe Society in Green Lake. He also thought of Tan Hu, that unusual buyer.

"No, all I've heard are rumors about things like the Green Robe Three Brothers!" Lu Xu shook his head and said. The woman in black seemed somewhat disappointed at his words. She was silent for a moment, then suddenly asked, "How many spirit stones did Mo Qingyuan take from you that day?"

Lu Xu glanced at her with some surprise, thought for a moment, then said, "Twenty!" The woman in black counted out twenty spirit stones from her spatial pouch at her waist, put them into a brocade bag, and handed it over.

"He is the direct grandson of Elder Changzong; I can't control him. But his attitude doesn't represent the Mo family. Our Mo family absolutely abhors such matters! I am returning these twenty spirit stones to you on behalf of the Mo family!" the woman in black said with a clear, cold, and extremely serious voice.

Lu Xu secretly chuckled upon hearing this. Ever since he entered Green Lake Market, every Mo family member he had encountered, whether it was Fatty Mo or the man in white, had been trying to exploit ordinary cultivators. As far as Lu Xu knew, it was much the same in several other industries controlled by the Mo family. If they truly abhorred it, why would so many people openly exploit lower-level cultivators? He dismissed the words of the woman in black, but since the spirit stones were being handed to him, Lu Xu wouldn't refuse. So he took the cloth bag and said with a sincere expression, "Fairy, I will convey your words to the other two fellow Daoists in the courtyard!"

The woman in black nodded: "You serve the Mo family, and the Mo family will absolutely not mistreat you! In the future, if you hear anything related to rogue cultivator organizations, I hope you can inform me promptly. I can give you a certain reward!" she said again. Lu Xu nodded, but he had no intention of telling the woman any information, as that might expose his dealings with talismans.

As Lu Xu was about to turn and leave, he heard the woman ask again, "You rejected Elder Changyun, didn't you?"

"That's right, I have no intention of being a live-in son-in-law!" Lu Xu stated directly.

The woman in black nodded: "You did the right thing. A good man should aspire to great heights; how could he become a live-in son-in-law?" When she mentioned "live-in son-in-law," a clear look of disgust flashed in her eyes.

"This person seems to have a story!" Lu Xu thought to himself. He had no desire to probe further. Seeing that the woman in black had no intention of asking him anything else, he cupped his hands in farewell and left.

Returning to the previous main hall, there were nearly twenty people there besides him. Lu Xu noticed that two fewer mid-grade spiritual root cultivators were present, indicating they had been swayed by the Mo family. After waiting a while longer, two or three more people gradually returned. Finally, the Mo Family Patriarch appeared in the hall, glanced at everyone, and couldn't help but sigh:

"Enough, enough. You may all return and consider carefully. Our Mo family isn't trying to harm you!" He waved his hand, and everyone immediately scattered, unwilling to stay any longer, as if fleeing from a dragon's pool and tiger's den.
