# Chapter 25: The Ancient City of Tai

The Ancient City of Tai was more magnificent than Xiao Ji had imagined. The entire city floated above a vast sea, visibly divided into several layers with misty clouds swirling around it. Spirit birds soared through the skies while floating vessels of various sizes came and went.

The higher one looked, the more indistinct the upper layers became. A massive floating vessel, resembling a small city, passed near the ship from Guixian Gate, blocking the sunlight and creating an oppressive atmosphere.

Unfortunately, Xiao Ji's perception range was currently limited to sixty feet. If he could perceive objects thousands of miles away, he could have easily comprehended the entire Ancient City of Tai.

Though not the largest Daoist city, Tai was quite renowned. During the voyage, Xiao Ji had heard from wandering cultivators that this city was more inclusive than others—less arrogant towards visitors. Regardless of one's background, as long as they met the entry requirements, they could expect fair treatment.

Many cultivators even made a living here. Sleeping on the streets wasn't frowned upon, and during festivals, the city would distribute mooncakes and dumplings to wandering cultivators.

The city lord was the Great Immortal Sanyun, a late-stage Unity Realm expert—a rather amiable old man with a good reputation. Most importantly, he was wealthy and still single. As for his age, no one cared much about the years of a Unity Realm master.

In this world, once cultivators reached a certain realm or age, they enjoyed being called "Great Immortal," though none truly deserved the title. This custom stemmed from mutual flattery among peers, where everyone bestowed grandiose titles upon each other.

"Great Immortal Kaitian, out buying buns?"

"Ah, isn't this Great Immortal Changqing? Care for a drink?"

"There are celestial maidens performing new dances in the square. Would Great Immortal Shenbing like to join me in admiring them?"

Over time, the title "Great Immortal" became increasingly watered down, far from its original meaning.

The floating vessel docked at a massive pier bustling with cultivators, the weakest being at least at the sixth level of Qi Refinement. Many Golden Core cultivators and above simply flew directly to the city gates on their artifacts to save time.

Indeed, entry into the Ancient City of Tai required inspection, and flying within the city was prohibited. After disembarking, Xiao Ji arrived at the towering city gates, where Tai guards stood watch. Various magical artifacts hung above the gates, including one that detected cultivation levels—those below the sixth level of Qi Refinement were denied entry.

Xiao Ji noticed that Tai resembled a pyramid. As a Qi Refinement cultivator, he was restricted to the first layer. Upon inquiry, he learned that the city had three distinct zones, each catering to specific cultivation levels. The first layer was for Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, and Nascent Soul cultivators, while higher realms were barred from entering.

Similarly, cultivators from lower realms couldn't access the upper zones. The next layer was for Void Interpretation, Soul Formation, and Unity Realm experts, while the highest level was reserved for those approaching the Great Ascension Realm—many on the verge of transcending their tribulations frequented that area.

Great Immortal Sanyun had designed this system not out of discrimination but for protection. In Tai's early days, when all cultivators mingled in a single zone, many amusing incidents occurred—until two Great Ascension experts clashed, their spiritual energy waves killing a crowd of Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment spectators. Since then, the city had been divided.

Entering the gates, Xiao Ji marveled, "They say the world is teeming with cultivators, and today I finally caught a glimpse. And this is just one Daoist city—imagine how many more exist across the world."

"First time in Tai, fellow Daoist? It's vast, with streets laid out like a chessboard..." A lanky cultivator approached with a smile.

Before he could finish, Xiao Ji cut in, "I'm not buying a map."

The man choked on his words, forcing an awkward smile. "I'm not selling maps."

"I don't need talismans either, and my sword isn't for sale." Xiao Ji had no patience for scammers targeting newcomers.

"Actually, I..." The scammer scrambled for words, unwilling to let fresh prey slip away.

"Enough. You'd better start planning your escape route." Xiao Ji glanced toward a street corner.

Puzzled, the scammer followed his gaze and paled upon spotting a group armed with weapons searching for someone. When he recognized a red-robed female cultivator among them, he hunched his shoulders and prepared to flee—yesterday, he'd sold her a fake artifact bracelet, and now she'd returned with reinforcements.

Though Tai prohibited magical combat, physical brawls were tolerated as long as no lives were lost. If both parties consented, they could duel in designated arenas.

"Leave me a Tai city map, or I'll call them over," Xiao Ji demanded with a smile, essentially extorting the man.

Grudgingly, the scammer produced a map from his storage artifact and handed it over before darting into an alley. Unfazed, Xiao Ji unfolded the map to locate Ershi Shop.

According to the markings, only one Ershi Shop existed in Tai—"Four Seas Ershi Shop," situated at the end of the main street. Comparing nearby landmarks, Xiao Ji confirmed his position at the street's entrance.

As he walked toward the end, the surroundings grew shabbier, lacking the cleanliness of the main thoroughfare. Listless cultivators sat along the curb, some holding signs, others leaning against walls or tree roots with placards beside them.

Approaching, Xiao Ji read their messages:

"Qi Refinement seventh level, Alchemy Path. Former outer disciple of third-rate sect Hundred Pill Valley. Skilled at furnace-tending, no napping record. Sect-certified. Seeking any position in a medical hall..."

"Qi Refinement ninth level, Martial Path. Excellent physique, hardworking... Experienced enforcer available..."

"Late-stage Foundation Establishment, Sword Path wanderer. Former sect founder (closed due to poor management)... Willing to change professions..."

All were job seekers.

Only those who'd experienced the cultivator's struggle understood their plight—constantly scrambling for spirit stones, forced to leave their homelands for opportunities in cities like this.

"Two Confucian Path cultivators wanted. Foundation Establishment or above. Meals and lodging provided, two Daoist robes monthly, two Yellow-grade spirit stones salary. Qualified applicants step forward." A well-dressed cultivator announced the opening.

Several men sprang up. Xiao Ji noticed the ninth-level Martial Path cultivator swiftly swapping his sign to claim Confucian expertise.

No wonder Tai was praised for its inclusivity—here, even the lowest cultivators could persist on their path, regardless of background.

Scanning the crowd, Xiao Ji sensed most had exaggerated their qualifications, some outright fabricating experience.

Since Tai was predominantly inhabited by cultivators—from whom Xiao Ji could easily harvest cultivation points—he found the city ideal. Given sufficient time and spirit stones (silver being nearly worthless here), he'd gladly extend his stay.

His gains from the voyage and Tai's streets had already elevated him to the seventh level of Qi Refinement.

[Name: Xiao Ji]  
[Age: 19]  
[Affiliation: Formerly Yuanshen Temple]  
[Spiritual Roots: Erratic, varying in number]  
[Realm: Qi Refinement 7th Level (3/70)]  
[Cultivation Art: "Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Purple Gold Technique"]  
[Perception Range: 90 feet]  

This breakthrough caused no major physical changes, though surging spiritual energy briefly nauseated him, making him faint momentarily—an episode job seekers mistook for hunger-induced collapse, a tactic to garner sympathy.

Fortunately, Xiao Ji recovered quickly. After his advancement, he hurried toward Ershi Shop, eager to secure the four-stringed pipa fragments.

Standing before the Four Seas Ershi Shop, an ominous premonition struck him. Even without using his perception, the place appeared abandoned.
