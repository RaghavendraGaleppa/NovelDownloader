Chapter 14: Mastering the Fist Technique and Receiving Pay

“Brother Luo, hello.”

Li Xian retracted his fist and stood upright, replying with a smile.

“Brother Li, it’s not that Brother Luo is criticizing you. I have many affairs to attend to, and when I get busy, I tend to forget things.”

“You should be more proactive. If there is anything you don’t understand, come and ask me主动ly. Don’t be afraid of disturbing me.”

Luo Tongyun spoke earnestly, as if he truly had Li Xian’s best interests at heart.

“Of course, of course.” Li Xian put on an awkward smile on the surface, but in reality, he knew the situation clearly.

Luo Tongyun had grasped the essence of the “Square Fist.” He appeared gentle on the outside but was insidious on the inside. He spoke beautifully but acted dirtily.

Li Xian knew this man harbored ill intentions. Perhaps he simply didn’t like the sight of Li Xian, or maybe there was another reason. In any case, he absolutely did not want Li Xian to succeed.

Therefore, seeking guidance from him would yield nothing.

Li Xian decided to simply study and practice diligently on his own.

“You, you. Perform the fist technique once. Let me see how much you have achieved.” Luo Tongyun shook his head and sighed.

“Alright.”

Li Xian threw his punches stiffly, deliberately exposing flaws in his movements.

“Stop!”

Luo Tongyun felt secretly delighted. He thought to himself, “Excellent. If this continues, the task will be completed in ten days.”

However, verbally, he criticized Li Xian as if he were a disappointing student:

“No improvement at all, absolutely no progress. If this keeps up, I’ll be anxious for you.”

“Forget it. Since things have come to this, everyone has their own aptitude. This cannot be forced.”

“I told you earlier to practice hard in seclusion, but I’m afraid that’s all you’re capable of. You might as well put aside the fist technique for now and focus on tempering your physique.”

Li Xian said, “Brother Luo, but there is Commander Pang’s assessment…”

“Don’t worry. Just listen to my arrangement. I will explain the situation to Commander Pang.”

Luo Tongyun patted Li Xian on the shoulder and said earnestly, “Little Li, you must work hard. If you fail the assessment, I will lose face too.”

“Thank you for your concern, Brother Luo.”

Li Xian cupped his fist in salute.

After Luo Tongyun left, Li Xian’s eyes flashed, and he continued to practice his fist technique.

No matter how difficult the situation, the only way to completely break the predicament was to master the fist technique as soon as possible!

Pang Long was the chief commander of the guards, responsible for the peace of the First Unity Manor.

He patrolled twice a day, in the morning and at night. The rest of the time, he spent at his own residence, practicing martial arts diligently.

“Some time ago, I was fortunate enough to receive a medicinal soup from the Madam. I drank two portions and distributed the remaining five portions to my brothers.”

“After drinking the soup, I vaguely felt changes in my body. Could it be… that I am approaching the state the Madam spoke of?”

Pang Long practiced his fist technique, palm technique, and movement technique, refining each one. All had reached a bottleneck. His daily hard practice was merely to ensure his realm did not regress.

For a martial artist…

Once one embarks on this path, it is a lifelong commitment. If one does not practice martial arts for a day, half a month of hard work is wasted. One cannot achieve anything by practicing intermittently.

Natural talent and bone structure for the Dao of martial arts are even more important. Pang Long’s “Emptying Palm” had seen very little progress for several years.

He intuitively felt it was limited by his natural talent.

“Right, that kid has been a guard for five or six days. I wonder what his situation is now.”

Pang Long wiped away his sweat and put on his clothes. He sent someone to summon Luo Tongyun and asked directly:

“Little Luo, what is the situation with that kid?”

Luo Tongyun said, “He… he is well-behaved, but… but…”

“If his aptitude is a bit lacking, but he is willing to work hard, it doesn’t matter.” Pang Long’s furrowed brows relaxed slightly.

He was just a guard. High aptitude is naturally good, but it doesn’t matter if it isn’t high. However, Pang Long could not tolerate those who were slippery, lazy, or tried to take shortcuts.

Luo Tongyun said:

“His aptitude is actually okay, it’s just… that he is a bit casual. In these five days, he has rarely come to me for guidance.”

“Every time, it was me who went to inspect him. I don’t know if he took my advice to heart. From the looks of it, his fist technique progress is a bit slow.”

His words didn’t contain a single lie.

“Hmm?” Pang Long frowned. “Could it be that once he became a guard, he developed a lazy heart?”

He had seen too many such people. They could endure hardship, cold, and hunger, but could not resist sweet words.

“Forget it. If he doesn’t meet my standards in ten days, send him back to where he came from.”

Pang Long waved his hand dismissively.

Seeing that his plan was proceeding smoothly and that Commander Pang had no special relationship with this boy, Luo Tongyun felt a surge of joy and became even bolder in his sabotage.

Another four days passed in a flash.

After the morning training, Li Xian, as usual, picked a secluded spot to practice his fist technique hard.

[Square Fist]
[Proficiency: 319/1000 Mastery]
[Description: Using the body as the pivot, striking in all four directions. The fist wind is simple and plain, but hides the wonder of the universe. One need not fear enemies attacking from all sides.]

[Skill: Running]
[Proficiency: 450/1000 Mastery]
[Description: You run through the mountains and fields, landing lightly. Your speed is already quite fast.]

Li Xian had grown a little taller and his body had become much sturdier. The “morning run” during daily training meant his speed and endurance were now above average.

If he were to run for his life, aided by the [Weeding]-derived tenacity, out of the hundreds of guards, there were probably only a handful who could outrun him.

Li Xian felt that the warm current in his Dantian was now as thick as two fingers.

Constant dripping wears away stone. Internal strength was accumulating bit by bit.

It was already winter. Circulating internal strength could dispel the cold, which was very useful.

Li Xian thought to himself:

“If I can really make a name for myself in the future, I also want to travel the martial world.”

“Fourth Brother, still practicing your fist?”

Zhao Han put his arm around Li Xian’s shoulder, in an excellent mood.

“Big Brother, you’re so happy today. Did something good happen?” Li Xian had just assumed a fighting stance. Seeing Zhao Han, Wang Chun, and Zhuo Yilie approaching, he retracted his stance and asked curiously.

Wang Chun said, “I told you that Fourth Brother has gone傻 from practicing martial arts. How could you forget such an important day?”

“Fourth Brother, today is the day we receive our monthly pay,” Zhao Han said with a smile.

“Ah! So that’s it.” Li Xian counted the days and said, “But I haven’t been in the manor for a full month. Do I get paid today too?”

“Naturally, naturally. Forget practicing martial arts, let’s go get our pay,” Zhao Han said, practically dragging Li Xian along.

Thus, the four of them from the same dormitory lined up and headed toward the accounting office.

There was a long line outside the accounting office. They waited half an hour before it was Li Xian’s group’s turn.

“Li Xian, originally a laborer, monthly pay fifty coins. Now an Class D guard, monthly pay one hundred and fifty coins.”

“During your time as a laborer, you performed well and received a total reward of thirty-seven coins. This month’s pay totals one hundred and seventeen coins.”

The accountant couldn’t help but look at him a few more times.

From laborer to guard… this was quite rare. He had a slight impression of this kid. At the end of autumn, when he signed the contract, his handwriting was quite good.

“Here is your pay, take it carefully.”

A green cloth bag contained over a hundred copper coins. Li Xian took it and gently weighed it in his hand, unable to help but smile lightly.

A single coin can stump a hero.

He finally had money in his pocket!

In this world, in these times… money was simply too important!

“Zhao Han, Class C guard, monthly pay two hundred and twenty coins. Full attendance on patrol duty, an additional fifty coins…”

After calculating all the odds and ends, Zhao Han’s pay amounted to a full three hundred coins.

It was almost three times that of Li Xian.

Li Xian sighed with emotion: “Even within Qingning County, there aren’t many people who earn three hundred coins a month.”

“The Manor’s Madam is truly wealthy. I wish I had so much money too.”
