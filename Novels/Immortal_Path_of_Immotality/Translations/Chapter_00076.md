# Chapter 76: Tortoiseshell Fragment

The appraisal master, an elderly man surnamed Zhang, was a Foundation Establishment cultivator and the chief appraiser of Yichuan Auction House, overseeing seven or eight other appraisers. 

Master Zhang highly valued Lin Shan's appraisal talent and directly recommended him to the auction house's owner—the Golden Core elder of Yichuan's Internal Affairs Bureau, Elder Zuo!

As a mere Qi Condensation novice, Lin Shan found himself bewildered as he was led to meet a Golden Core expert for the first time, trembling with reverence as if in a dream.

They now stood in the inner chamber on the fifth floor of the auction house. Seated at the head was an eyebrowless elder with waist-length black hair, heavy-lidded eyes, a face full of brown spots, and a weathered, vicissitudinous expression. He idly played with two ordinary-looking black iron balls in his hands.

Yet Lin Shan could sense an invisible gravitational force emanating from those iron balls, pressing down on him from the steps below, making him feel an almost irresistible urge to kneel.

"Manifestation of divine abilities—a magic treasure!" 

This was the hallmark of a Golden Core cultivator's magic treasure, capable of overturning rivers and seas, its might incomparable to mere magical instruments.

However, Elder Zuo himself appeared amiable, likely out of respect for Master Zhang. He offered Lin Shan a few words of encouragement.

"Not bad. Reaching late-stage Qi Condensation before twenty—there's a sliver of hope for Foundation Establishment."

Despite his eyebrowless, stern appearance, Elder Zuo's voice was warm and genial, like that of a kindly elder.

Lin Shan hastily bowed. "You flatter me, Elder. I don't deserve such praise."

Generally, cultivators who formed a Golden Core were respectfully addressed as "Golden Core Elders," while Nascent Soul cultivators were titled "Nascent Soul True Lords." These were honorifics Lin Shan had never needed before, but now, standing before a Golden Core elder, he dared not show the slightest disrespect.

Elder Zuo nodded slightly. "Master Zhang tells me you're a prodigy in appraisal, potentially his successor. Let me test you."

With a flick of his wrist, a golden light flashed from the Buddhist prayer beads on his wrist, and three items materialized before Lin Shan. Clearly, Elder Zuo's storage artifact wasn't an ordinary storage pouch but the Buddhist bracelet on his hand—or perhaps even a storage treasure, though Lin Shan's limited knowledge couldn't fathom the wealth of a Golden Core elder.

Lin Shan respectfully accepted the three brocade boxes. Seeing Master Zhang's encouraging look, he realized this was a rare opportunity to impress a Golden Core elder—one he absolutely couldn't squander.

Gritting his teeth and swallowing hard, Lin Shan opened the first box and lightly touched its contents. The enhancement panel appeared.

**[South Sea Mermaid Pearl]**  
Quality: Fourth-grade spiritual material  
Description: Formed from the tears of a Golden Core mermaid from the South Sea, usable for alchemy or artifact refinement.  
Enhancement cost: 64 points  
...

Lin Shan's heart trembled. *Holy shit!*

The classification of spiritual materials in the cultivation world was nebulous, unlike the clear hierarchies of techniques, artifacts, or pills. Materials—whether natural or man-made—were evaluated based on the cultivator's level, the material's age, environment, mutations, and other factors, with no fixed standard.

For instance, this South Sea Mermaid Pearl could be from a Golden Core mermaid or a Qi Condensation mermaid—the difference was like clouds and mud. Without the enhancement panel, he'd never have guessed what this was!

But even knowing the answer, Lin Shan hesitated about revealing it outright. Under Elder Zuo's piercing gaze, how could he, a Qi Condensation youngster without any appraisal tools, identify this as a Golden Core mermaid pearl? He'd never even been to the South Sea!

After turning the pearl over in his hands, Lin Shan knew time was running out. He had to decide.

"Elder, this spiritual material contains surging water-attribute spiritual energy. Judging by its texture, it doesn't seem to be a natural spiritual material but rather a product of a living being—perhaps a tear? I can't say for certain."

Lin Shan lowered his head, sweat soaking his back. He had no idea how his answer would be received.

Master Zhang, observing the pearl, seemed thoughtful.

Elder Zuo remained impassive, merely uttering an indifferent "Hmm" before pointing to the second box. "Next."

Lin Shan hurriedly opened the second box, revealing a black fragment with irregular grooves. The enhancement panel updated.

**[Tortoiseshell Fragment]** (Damaged)  
Quality: Minor Divine Ability (Incomplete)  
Description: A nameless minor divine ability created by a Nascent Soul Black Tortoise of the South Sea during its leisure. Requires soaking in Black Tortoise blood for three months to activate the inheritance.  
Enhancement cost: 64 points  
...

Lin Shan broke out in a cold sweat. *Elder Zuo is really playing hardball with these obscure items!*

He suspected even Elder Zuo might not know what this was, using him as a test—if he succeeded, great; if not, no loss.

Examining the unremarkable fragment, Lin Shan grew convinced this was indeed an inheritance from a spirit beast, and in its damaged state, it was utterly nondescript. Elder Zuo likely had no clue about its origins either.

After some thought, Lin Shan decided to offer a vague hint. "This... resembles a type of divine ability inheritance mentioned in my family's ancient texts."

He stroked his chin uncertainly while stealing a glance at Elder Zuo.

Elder Zuo's eyes narrowed slightly, and he too studied the fragment, as if recalling something.

Seeing this reaction, Lin Shan pretended to ponder further. "I'm not entirely sure what divine ability it is, but I recall ancient texts mentioning that such inheritances often require corresponding blood to activate—soaking it for three months might reveal something."

That was all he could suggest. This Nascent Soul Black Tortoise had created the ability but never named it—who knew what it was called?

His words seemed to enlighten Elder Zuo, who nodded repeatedly, growing visibly excited.

The eyebrowless elder immediately retrieved the fragment and beamed at Lin Shan. "Young friend, your family's knowledge runs deep. May I ask your origins?"

Lin Shan hesitated. Making up a background was risky—cultivation clans were limited in number, and fabrications could easily be exposed. 

Using someone else's name? But if Elder Zuo had wide connections, he might see through it.

He didn't dare invoke Thunderclap Daoist's banner this time—Elder Zuo wasn't as gullible as those two fake immortal descendants.

In desperation, Lin Shan had a flash of inspiration. "My ancestors belonged to a major cultivation sect before leaving to establish a clan. Over centuries, my branch declined into a mortal family in the Southern Border. Only my cousin and I were fortunate enough to enter the path of cultivation."

He knew better than to fabricate outright—every cultivation clan had traceable origins. The Lin family of Qinghe County had only existed for a hundred-odd years, so even if Elder Zuo investigated, he'd find nothing amiss.

Elder Zuo pressed for the sect's name. Lin Shan had no choice but to blurt out, "The Witch Dao Sect."

This wasn't entirely made up—the "Nailhead Seven Arrow Book" from the enhancement panel mentioned it. As long as it had historical basis, he could justify it.

Elder Zuo frowned, racking his centuries-old memory. He felt he'd heard the name before but couldn't quite place it. Master Zhang, over a hundred years old himself, was equally stumped.

Eventually, Elder Zuo gave up and pointed to the third box. "If you can accurately identify this last item, it's yours!"

Clearly, Lin Shan's help with the tortoiseshell fragment had earned him this reward. A Golden Core elder's casual gift would be a treasure to a Qi Condensation cultivator.

Lin Shan opened the box to find a palm-sized bronze mirror, dull and unremarkable, resembling a mundane object. Its surface reflected his youthful face, with irregular edges and pockmarks—some scratched, others burnt—looking more like a roofing tile than a treasure.

Master Zhang gasped. "Elder Zuo, isn't this the—"

Elder Zuo chuckled and waved him off, watching as Lin Shan picked up the mirror.
