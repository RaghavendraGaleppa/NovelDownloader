# Chapter 74: The Immortal's Trap

Xu Yunfan looked up and saw the firelight hanging halfway up the mountain, like several red lanterns suspended under the night sky.

As he drew closer and got a clear look at the so-called mountain gate, a cold sweat broke out in Xu Yunfan's palm.

It was out of sheer frustration.

The three characters for "Qixia Temple" on the slanted signboard were peeling, clearly indicating this was a converted old temple.

In the empty space before the hall, dozens of people sat gathered. In the middle of the crowd was a thin, middle-aged Daoist with a goatee, dressed in a brocade Daoist robe, continuously preaching his doctrine.

Surrounding them stood several fierce-looking men with sinister expressions, their eyes scanning the area sharply.

After the Daoist finished his sermon, he shouted loudly, "The world is full of suffering, and suffering is as deep as an abyss. Birth is the beginning of suffering, and death is not the end of it. Only by entering my sect, offering sincere worship, can one escape the cycle of rebirth. Chant the scriptures a hundred times a day, turn your heart to the light, donate gold and silver, and you shall attain liberation. Those who do not listen or believe will sink into the sea of suffering forever, and their descendants will suffer for it."

The crowd, filled with fanaticism, shouted in unison, "Many thanks to Master Qixia for clearing our doubts!"

With that, they generously opened their purses, and the merit box in front of Master Qixia was soon filled with silver coins.

Master Qixia nodded in satisfaction and said earnestly, "The current times are perilous, and we must naturally band together for warmth. Since the current Empress ascended the throne, we commoners have suffered unbearably..."

He suddenly raised his right hand.

"The evil world must be destroyed, the righteous way must rise again. Those who defy the mandate shall die, and the believers shall enjoy peace."

Upon hearing this, the dozens of people became excited, raising their arms and shouting in unison.

"The evil world must be destroyed, the righteous way must rise again. Those who defy the mandate shall die, and the believers shall enjoy peace."

Damn it, it's a pyramid scheme!

Xu Yunfan's eye twitched. Although he felt something was wrong, he had come here with a sliver of hope. Now, seeing it with his own eyes, he finally gave up that thought. He grabbed Zhang Tiehu.

"Give me back my money."

So fast!

Zhang Tiehu was horrified. He realized the young man's martial arts realm was far superior to his own; he might even be a First-Stage Martial Apprentice.

His eyes darted around. Looking at the dozen or so burly men standing or sitting around Qixia Temple, his panicked expression suddenly turned cold.

"Kid, our Qixia Temple isn't a place you can just come and go as you please. If you want to leave, fine. Leave the money on you and copy down a volume of the martial arts you practice, and we'll let you go."

They really want to eat you alive and take the leftovers too!

Although this place wasn't far from the nearest village, it was deep within the mass grave—a perfect spot for killing and robbing.

A chill appeared on Xu Yunfan's face.

"Do you think I'm a three-year-old?"

With a slight exertion of his single arm, he lifted Zhang Tiehu into the air. Zhang Tiehu's face changed drastically. He drew the long knife at his waist and slashed at Xu Yunfan, shouting at the top of his lungs.

"Sect Master, save me!"

Xu Yunfan's other hand flicked out, knocking the falling long knife away.

Zhang Tiehu felt his虎口 (tiger's mouth/hand) go numb. A tremendous force surged through him, and he could no longer hold the knife. It was sent flying, clattering to the ground.

The clear sound immediately drew the attention of everyone in Qixia Temple. The dozen or so men in black rushed over like a storm of fire, surrounding him.

Among them was a burly man with a face full of横肉 (cross-grained meat/brutal features) holding a tiger-head broadsword, sneering repeatedly.

"Where did this trash come from, daring to..."

Before he could finish, the lean middle-aged man beside him poked him with his elbow.

The burly man immediately changed his tune. "Daring to make trouble in the territory of Qixia Temple, you must have a death wish."

Xu Yunfan swept his gaze over them, having already gauged their strength. He couldn't help but sigh. He pressed down on Zhang Tiehu's head with one hand and twisted.

*Crack!*

Zhang Tiehu's head was twisted one hundred and eighty degrees, and he stopped moving for good.

He casually tossed Zhang Tiehu's corpse to the ground. The dull thud of the body hitting the ground startled the crows roosting on the withered branches nearby.

Xu Yunfan's right hand spread and then clenched, the knuckles making seven cracking sounds like popping beans. The cloth strips wrapped around the handle of the瓮金锤 (Earthen Gold Hammer) fell three inches with a *whoosh*.

"You guys... why bring this upon yourselves?"

"Seeking death!"

The tiger-head broadsword man was the first to strike. The blade cut through the air with a piercing whistle.

The slash was cunning, the blade slanting up toward Xu Yunfan's left ribs, targeting the blind spot where an ordinary martial artist would have the least power.

Xu Yunfan's back muscles suddenly surged like angry waves, his spine shuddering segment by segment. The Earthen Gold Hammer swept upward from below. Before the hammer head even arrived, the gust of wind had already flipped the merit box three zhang away. The fine steel tiger-head broadsword scraped sparks off the hammer's surface, as if it had struck a boulder.

Thirty-Six Paths of the Gale Hammer, Reverse Sweeping the Heavenly River.

Xu Yunfan twisted his waist and hips like a millstone, swinging the two-hundred-plus-jin hammer around like a windmill.

The tiger-head broadsword man watched helplessly as his prized blade was swept away by the hammer's wind. Suddenly, a tearing pain shot through his right arm; the muscles and tendons had been ripped apart by the centrifugal force. When the white bone pierced through his shoulder, it was still dripping with blood.

The lean man took this opportunity to close in. Two Emei daggers slid out from his sleeves. This insidious weapon was specifically designed to break hard-body techniques. Three cold glints targeted Xu Yunfan's eyes and throat. However, they saw the tendons on Xu Yunfan's neck suddenly bulge like earthworms. As his head tilted back, it emitted a sound like a taut bowstring being released.

Iron Lock Across the River.

The Earthen Gold Hammer, riding its previous momentum, spun back. The hammer handle shot out, thrusting between the lean man's legs and twisting around his ankles.

The muscles on Xu Yunfan's left leg suddenly swelled by a third. The sole of his boot crushed the blue bricks, and he swung the entire lean man around, smashing him into the crowd.

Three grey-robed men rushing forward were smashed by this human weapon, their chest bones shattering completely. A mist of blood exploded three feet high under the moonlight.

Master Qixia, who had been watching from a distance, finally changed his expression. He hadn't expected the intruder to possess such martial prowess. He waved his horsetail whisk urgently. "Form the Seven Killing Formation! Activate the Warrior Arts!"

The seven black-clad men surrounding Xu Yunfan crushed the pills hidden in their mouths and swallowed them. In an instant, their muscles grotesquely swelled, and their eyes instantly filled with bloodshot veins. Holding long knives and spears, they formed an array and pressed in. Their steps followed a strange rhythm, almost completely cutting off Xu Yunfan's escape routes in all directions.

Their aura was much stronger than before.

Xu Yunfan suddenly smiled.

He reversed his grip, holding the Earthen Gold Hammer across his chest, his back bending into a full moon.

His clothes snapped in the fierce wind, his shoulder blades protruding like two steel blades.

When the first poisoned spear thrust toward his face, he stomped his heel into the ground. The blue bricks cracked in a spiderweb pattern. Instead of retreating, he advanced.

The Earthen Gold Hammer in his hand turned into a blur.

The large spear was as fragile as a wooden rod under the hammer head. The right arm of the man holding the spear splintered with bone fragments and iron shards, yet he seemed to feel no pain, merely stumbling back under the heavy blow.

Xu Yunfan spun like a top. The heavy hammer knocked away three poisoned spears. With precise control, it sent them flying right back. The spear shafts pierced the chests of two sect members, their momentum undiminished, finally钉 (nailing) a bowl-sized hole into the worn-out dragon pillar in front of the hall.

Master Qixia swept his whisk urgently, and twelve Bone-Piercing Nails shot out.

But Xu Yunfan seemed to have eyes in the back of his head. The handle of the left hammer swung back to block, and all the nails embedded themselves in the hammer's surface.

The Earthen Gold Hammer twisted and spun. Using the momentum, Xu Yunfan suddenly flew out with the heavy hammer, pulling a piercing shriek through the night sky.
