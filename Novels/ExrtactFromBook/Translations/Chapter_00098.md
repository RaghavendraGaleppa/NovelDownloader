# Chapter 96: Advancement  

Wu Bing successfully achieved a breakthrough in spreading the [Pure Yang Heart Mantra] through parasitic objects.  

By controlling the queen bee, the entire [Gold-Devouring Bee] colony was destined to fall under Wu Bing's dominion—it was only a matter of time.  

Now free from the threat of bee attacks, Wu Bing swaggered right up to the hive entrance. A few worker bees emerged, pushing two large chunks of [Gold-Devouring Honey] toward it before handing them over.  

Wu Bing hoisted the massive honeycombs and trotted cheerfully back to Han, declaring,  

"Master, this [Gold-Devouring Bee] colony is under my control now. I plan to return to Iron-Eater City to trade these honeycombs for some high-grade rations."  

Han had no objections. With nothing pressing until his next [Lightning Summoning], he simply mounted Wu Bing's back, and the two set off on their return journey.  

Wu Bing raced toward Iron-Eater City with sparks and lightning trailing behind it.  

Ever since meeting Han, Wu Bing felt as though its fortunes had turned. It was no longer the weakest fighter among the Iron-Eater clan.  

With its newly acquired powerful divine ability, it had effortlessly subdued an entire colony of [Gold-Devouring Bees]. With this swarm under its command, its combat power had skyrocketed!  

And the two massive honeycombs it had obtained so easily? Such a windfall had been unimaginable in the past. Life was clearly looking up.  

Over the next few days, Han accompanied Wu Bing as it roamed Iron-Eater City. He watched as it sold the honeycombs for a handsome price, then purchased a spacious ore-storage pouch, which it wore around its neck on a leather cord.  

Wu Bing then visited several shops, buying large quantities of refined second-tier metal ingots.  

The innate supreme divine ability of the [Iron-Eater Beast] bloodline, [Devour Metal], allowed them to enhance their bloodline power by consuming metal—the foundation of their cultivation.  

This ability required vast amounts of precious metals, making the upbringing of every [Iron-Eater Beast] an enormous financial burden.  

Only in Goldblade Gorge, where veins of graded metal ore were abundant, could Iron-Eater City sustain the growth of so many [Iron-Eater Beasts].  

Yet even here, Wu Bing had never been able to guarantee a steady diet of second-tier metals. Throughout its past growth, it had relied primarily on first-tier metals to strengthen itself.  

But now, with its new divine ability, it could upgrade its diet to second-tier metals, drastically accelerating its progress.  

Han was more than happy to see this. Wu Bing's growth meant that the benefits it provided him would also increase—something well worth encouraging.  

---  

After concluding their business, Han once again set out with Wu Bing. Having adjusted his condition, he was ready for his third [Lightning Summoning].  

Wu Bing sprinted northeastward once more, and after most of a day's travel, they found another [Gold-Devouring Bee] hive.  

Now well-versed in handling the bees, Wu Bing had no trouble claiming this hive as well.  

To Han and Wu Bing, each [Gold-Devouring Bee] hive in Goldblade Gorge was now a rich vein of mana and spiritual sense waiting to be mined.  

Han didn't interfere with Wu Bing's hunt. Instead, he soared away on his escape light to a secluded spot and began his third [Lightning Summoning].  

After nearly a month of recuperation, Han had not only fully recovered from his injuries—his overall strength had also grown.  

His mastery of the [Lightning Summoning] technique had deepened considerably.  

He was confident that, given a little more time, his understanding of the technique would surpass that of any other Divine Thunder Palace disciple who had only begun practicing it at the Golden Core stage.  

Hands forming seals, he summoned the gathering thunder.  

Han felt an even deeper connection to the lightning's power.  

For thunder cultivators of the Divine Thunder Palace, attuning oneself to heaven, earth, wind, rain, and lightning was a fundamental practice.  

By beginning his [Lightning Summoning] training before forming his Golden Core, Han had gained a tremendous advantage on his path.  

In an instant, lightning flashed, and his body was saturated with mana. Once again, he was reduced to a charred husk before vanishing in a flicker.  

Compared to his second [Lightning Summoning], Han had endured one more lightning strike, and the number of lightning-nurturing runes he had condensed continued to grow.  

His mana accumulation was increasing at ten times the usual rate, bringing him to the very threshold of refining essence into qi!  

And so, the man and the bear roamed Goldblade Gorge, each pursuing their own goals with great enthusiasm.  

One was obsessed with being struck by lightning, refining mana, and playing the skin-shedding game—his face growing thicker with each trial, now nearly impenetrable.  

The other was addicted to manipulating bee demons, seizing hives, stealing honey, and occasionally gnawing on priceless metal ingots.  

A year passed in the blink of an eye.  

Han was now a completely different man.  

This was his seventeenth [Lightning Summoning]—and a critical one at that.  

Beneath the roiling thunderclouds, he stood calm and unshaken, as if the storm were nothing.  

A bolt of lightning crashed down upon him!  

Yet Han, gripping [Immortal's Bane], didn't even blink. He simply raised the sword in a sweeping arc.  

The lightning's power gathered along the blade without so much as grazing his body.  

[Immortal's Bane] was tempered inside and out by the lightning's force.  

After enduring sixteen previous [Lightning Summoning] sessions, Han's control over lightning mana had reached a new level.  

Now, the vast power summoned by the technique obeyed him like a tamed beast.  

A second bolt descended.  

The lightning mana coursed through Han's body but was effortlessly absorbed into his dantian.  

Then came the third, the fourth…  

By the time the thunderclouds dispersed, Han remained completely unharmed.  

An immense surge of lightning mana churned within his dantian, but under his control, every attempt of the mana to escape was firmly suppressed.  

One lightning-nurturing rune after another condensed within his dantian.  

Then, in an instant, Han felt as though he had broken through a minor bottleneck.  

His mana momentarily stilled—before erupting into violent motion!  

The fifth great perfection of the [Body-Nurturing Soul Thunder Method] had been achieved!  

Han had finally crossed the threshold to forming a first-grade Golden Core!  

He could now begin cultivating the [Supreme Divine Thunder Primordial Magnetism Longevity Scripture].  

From this moment onward, he no longer needed to wait for the right moment to form his core.  

When the opportunity arose, he could refine essence into qi at any time!  

Now, the lightning summoned by the [Lightning Summoning] technique could barely keep up with Han's needs.  

It was time to push the technique's potential even further.  

With a flicker of his escape light, Han reappeared atop Wu Bing's back.  

After a year of growth, the bear had expanded in size, its mana and spiritual sense advancing rapidly.  

The growth of its spiritual sense, in particular, had exceeded all expectations.  

By now, the great bear had seized control of twenty-three [Gold-Devouring Bee] colonies in Goldblade Gorge, using them as its parasitic vessels.  

The power of the [Pure Yang Heart Mantra] was now beyond compare!
