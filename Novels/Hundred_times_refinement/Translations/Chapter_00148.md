# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass  
Chapter 96: The Heart Demon Oath  

Lin Xian's expression remained calm, but inwardly he was overjoyed. This trip to the Xi Yue Stream had yielded far more rewards than he had anticipated.  

With these treasures in hand, he was confident that his cultivation and strength would soon advance by several levels.  

The only drawback was that someone had discovered his secrets. Lin Xian raised his eyes to the Cloud-Soaring Fairy, a shadow flickering across his face as he pondered in silence.  

Logically speaking, they were fellow disciples who had fought side by side and shared hardships—friends, not foes. Yet she now knew far too many secrets she shouldn't have.  

Should he silence her?  

Lin Xian hesitated. He didn’t consider himself a virtuous man, but to suddenly turn on an ally from moments ago felt... wrong.  

Moreover, even if he steeled his resolve, after his battle with the Clear Spirit Elder, most of his talismans had been depleted. With his remaining means, he wasn’t entirely confident he could defeat this senior sister.  

"You want to kill me?"  

While Lin Xian remained silent, Qin Yan spoke up. Her voice was melodious, but the words startled him. When he looked up, he saw no hostility on the beautiful girl's face—only an unexpected calm.  

"Senior Sister jokes. Why would I wish you harm?"  

A flash of ruthlessness crossed Lin Xian's eyes, but he quickly concealed it. If there had been a sliver of hope for an ambush earlier, now that Qin Yan was on guard, even if he tried to silence her, the Cloud-Soaring Fairy could easily escape if she couldn’t win.  

Qin Yan stood up, scrutinizing Lin Xian from head to toe. Suddenly, her smile bloomed like spring flowers, radiant and captivating.  

The normally cold and aloof Cloud-Soaring Fairy, now smiling, exuded an intoxicating charm. Yet Lin Xian's gaze remained clear. His only concern was whether his secrets would be exposed, and he was too preoccupied with strategizing to appreciate her beauty.  

"Junior Brother, don’t worry," Qin Yan said. "I know that someone with no spiritual roots, yet able to cultivate to your current strength, must have his secrets. Everyone has their privacy—I don’t wish to pry, nor will I speak of it to a third party."  

"Oh?"  

Lin Xian's eyebrows rose, and a resolute glint flashed in his eyes. Since she had laid her cards on the table, there was no need for pretense. Lowering his voice, he spoke deliberately, "I’d like to believe you, Senior Sister. But I dislike leaving my fate in another’s hands."  

"You don’t trust my word? Or do you think only the dead can keep secrets?"  

---  

"No need for that. I only ask that Senior Sister swear an oath to her heart demon."  

Cultivation was a path of defying the heavens, and every practitioner had their own heart demon. For those seeking immortality, an oath sworn upon one’s heart demon was inviolable. Breaking it would not only create insurmountable bottlenecks in cultivation, halting all progress, but also make meditation and absorbing spiritual energy perilously prone to deviation.  

For tens of thousands of years, no cultivator had ever dared to break such an oath.  

"Two choices, Senior Sister. Either swear upon your heart demon never to reveal today’s events, or only one of us leaves here alive."  

Lin Xian’s gaze was unyielding as spiritual pressure radiated from him. He watched the girl before him, waiting for the Cloud-Soaring Fairy’s decision.  

---  

Half an hour later, Lin Xian had already flown hundreds of miles away on his artifact, well beyond the territory of the Fire Spirit Sect. Only now did he feel truly safe.  

Halting his flight, he hovered midair and surveyed his surroundings. This was a crossroads—heading south would take him back to the Drifting Cloud Valley, while going west would lead him out of Yan Province’s borders after a few thousand miles.  

After a brief hesitation, Lin Xian turned westward.  

The events of half an hour ago were still vivid in his mind. With everything laid bare, Lin Xian had steeled his resolve—he refused to leave his fate in another’s hands and had forced Qin Yan to choose.  

Initially, he had expected the proud Cloud-Soaring Fairy to resist coercion, and he had prepared for a fight. Yet the outcome was better than anticipated.  

After a moment of contemplation, Qin Yan had indeed sworn an oath to her heart demon.  

Lin Xian exhaled in relief. His secrets were now safe—no one in tens of thousands of years had dared to break such an oath.  

After parting ways with Qin Yan, each flew off on their own. But upon reflection, Lin Xian decided against returning to the Drifting Cloud Valley.  

It wasn’t because of Qin Yan, but because he saw no benefit in rejoining the sect.  

Rather than enduring the constraints and constant vigilance of sect life, he preferred the freedom of a rogue cultivator.  

Before coming to Xi Yue Stream, he had already carried all his treasures and tens of thousands of discarded pills in his storage bracelet—enough to sustain him until he achieved Foundation Establishment.  

---  

The world beyond was vast. Yan Province was but a remote corner of the Zhao Kingdom, with relatively backward cultivation standards. Though Lin Xian had seldom ventured out in recent years, he had heard tales of the outside world from senior brothers and elders.  

More formidable cultivators, more powerful artifacts—now, he yearned to see it for himself.  

With his mind made up, Lin Xian didn’t hesitate. His flight light streaked westward like a shooting star.  

After a while, a streak of firelight caught up from behind. Frowning slightly, Lin Xian reached out and caught it—a message talisman.  

Infusing it with spiritual energy, Qin Yan’s melodious voice reached his ears:  

"If you choose not to return to Drifting Cloud Valley, I shall not insist. I will keep myself pure. Should we both form Nascent Souls within a century, I offer myself to you, that we may cultivate together and seek the Dao in unison."  

The talisman crumbled to dust, scattering in the wind. Lin Xian stood frozen, speechless. He hadn’t expected the Cloud-Soaring Fairy to harbor such feelings for him.  

If both reached the Nascent Soul stage, they would become cultivation partners?  

Nascent Soul stage?  

That was a realm of unimaginable power. The Drifting Cloud Valley hadn’t produced such a cultivator in a thousand years. Qin Yan’s confidence was staggering—while the elders believed she would surely form a Golden Core, she actually believed she could reach the Nascent Soul stage?  

And she thought a rootless mortal like him could achieve the same?  

Cultivating together after forming Nascent Souls...  

The image of Qin Yan’s exquisite beauty and perfect figure stirred a warmth in Lin Xian’s chest. But he quickly shook his head. He had only just secured his path to Foundation Establishment—the Nascent Soul stage was still a distant dream.  

For now, his priority was refining the supreme-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pill.  

Lin Xian resumed his flight into the distance.  

---  

Two days later, Lin Xian landed on a desolate mountain, having crossed from Yan Province into You Province.  

Though both were part of the Zhao Kingdom, You Province was vastly different from the borderlands of Yan. It was ten times larger in area and population. Even disregarding the mortal world, its cultivation world far surpassed the backward Yan Province.  

In Yan, the Drifting Cloud Valley and Fire Spirit Sect were top-tier powers, but in You Province, they would rank as second-rate at best—among dozens of similar sects.  

The three greatest cultivation sects in You Province were the Azure Cloud Mountain, the Thread Gorge, and the Thundercloud Manor.  

Rumors said these sects each had over ten thousand disciples—though most were at the Qi Refining stage. Still, such numbers spoke to their terrifying strength.  

Beyond these major sects, there were countless rogue cultivators and cultivation clans. The overall level of cultivation here was a full tier above Yan Province.  

Even the demonic beasts were more numerous here.  

Yan Province was simply too barren, lacking in spirit stones and cultivation resources. Otherwise, the Drifting Cloud Valley and Fire Spirit Sect would never have dominated—they’d have been swept aside by You Province’s sects long ago.  

After reviewing what he knew of You Province, Lin Xian found a secluded cave in the mountain’s depths.  

First, he restored his spiritual energy, then sorted through his gains.  

The spoils from Xi Yue Stream were substantial, but he hadn’t had time to organize them.  

He first placed the Silver Moon Flower and Firefly Grass into a specially crafted wooden box. Made from unique materials, it could preserve the herbs’ spiritual energy for a month, keeping them as fresh as when first picked.  

Next, he retrieved the Clear Spirit Elder’s storage pouch and emptied its contents.  

A clattering sound echoed as treasures spilled out. As expected of a sect leader—his wealth surpassed Lin Xian’s expectations. Fifty-six mid-grade spirit stones, numerous bottles and jars, and several spirit artifacts.  

Among them, one artifact immediately caught Lin Xian’s eye...
