# Chapter 303: The World’s River Book, Great Achievements, and the Nether River

The flower boat had left the port for about a quarter of an hour when white mist surged from all sides, making it impossible to distinguish north from south or east from west. The surrounding scenery turned into a vast, indistinct blur. Li Xian, well-versed in the "Five Elements Strange Escape," knew this mist was a type of miasma.

It was the "Chaos Sky Miasma" from the depths of Dongran Lake, a unique feature of the lake area that had evolved over a long time. Yan Hao relied on the Five Elements Strange Escape to pull it over and envelop the Water Altar, using it as the first layer of the island's protective barrier.

An outsider watches for the spectacle, while an insider sees the principle. Having established a foundation in the Five Elements, Li Xian could now observe the lake's mysterious formations. Although he couldn't break them yet, he could already discern their origins. Standing on the deck, he looked at the lake and said, "What an exquisite layout."

There were several completely different currents hidden within the lake. Following each current would lead to a different outcome: either circling back and forth, hitting hidden reefs, bypassing the Water Altar, or arriving at the deeper parts of Dongran Lake.

By arranging the islands in the water, Yan Hao could change the direction of the currents. All things in heaven and earth could become his traps. After sailing for half an hour, Li Xian experienced over a dozen types of perilous, bewildering formations.

\[Minor Five Elements Strange Escape\]

\[Proficiency: 67/100\]

Li Xian possessed the "Observing Heaven and Earth" trait, making his perception of the world more vivid and clear. It is said that reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles. Both "reading ten thousand books" and "traveling ten thousand miles" have their merits. Reading clarifies principles, while traveling teaches worldly affairs. But neither is as fruitful as first reading ten thousand books and then traveling ten thousand miles. Li Xian had previously studied the "Minor Five Elements Strange Escape," and now he was observing a rare Five Elements entrapment layout in the world.

His gains were abundant, far surpassing what Yan Hao could teach verbally. His progress was so fast it truly surprised Yan Hao. Unknowingly, he saw the sky darken into a vast, indistinct expanse. His proficiency in the Minor Five Elements Strange Escape had reached \[70\].

Li Xian snapped back to awareness, gazing at the waterway they had come from. Having just parted ways with Nan Gong Liuli, he felt a deep longing in his heart. He closed his eyes and sensed it; the hairs he had left behind had taken root... In the courtyard, he could faintly see the graceful figure of Nan Gong Liuli.

"A man's ambition should be vast. I must only become stronger. Only then can I help Sister Liuli escape this predicament. What is a brief separation?"

Li Xian stayed on the second floor. The bedroom was three zhang wide and three zhang long... the space was quite spacious. The lake waves gently rippled, causing the boat to sway.

He slept simply.

The next morning, he woke naturally. He sat cross-legged and practiced the Internal Five Organs Turbid Purification. Heart Turbid, Lung Turbid, Kidney Turbid... The various turbid energies circulated within, bringing immense benefits.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency +1\]

The Five Organs Avoiding Turbid and Gathering Sun Meridian grew ever more profound. By the time he had practiced until the hour of Chen (7-9 a.m.), Li Xian pushed open the cabin window to observe the strange scenery of the lake. White mist curled around him; even with his Double Pupil vision, he could not see far.

The mountains, rivers, and sky were like an invisible curtain, obscuring his vision.

Feilong City was located in the southeastern region of Huaiyin Prefecture. It could be seen on the Great Wu Dynasty's maps, belonging to the ranks of notable cities. Li Xian had experienced many things, visited perilous and treacherous places, and passed through life-and-death situations, but he had never yet entered a true metropolis. He couldn't help but feel a mix of curiosity and anticipation.

He suppressed his emotions and silently practiced internally.

By noon, a servant from the boat brought a meal, consisting of "Oily Fish Soup," "White Jade Grapes," "Peach Blossom Fresh Brew"... Li Xian enjoyed the lake scenery while tasting the fine dishes.

After eating his fill, he went to the deck for some fresh air. The sails flapped in the wind, making a "whooshing" sound as the boat moved at a considerable speed. Li Xian had heard Yan Hao say that Elders Ye Cheng, Han Zisha, and An Weicheng would be leaving the island one after another. The ferry envoy, Jin Shichang, was extremely busy, so the boat was sailing quite urgently.

On the deck, ordinary disciples were arranging formations and practicing.

The Flower Cage Gate specialized in the various arts of formations, a truly correct move to leverage their strengths. The gate's customs and rules were different from ordinary sects. Moreover, most of the disciples came from lowly backgrounds, with uneven martial talent. Only the art of formations could compensate for their shortcomings.

He observed silently. He deeply felt that every disciple of the Flower Cage Gate was very weak in strength. But when they formed a formation, they became extremely difficult to deal with. For instance, the "Five Elements Flower Veil Formation" being practiced on the deck at that moment.

The formation was composed of five people. Each held a sack, which had been specially made with a tough material that was resistant to water and fire. It could also be disassembled and changed into various forms. Twisting the sack turned it into a short whip. Spreading the sack out turned it into a cloak, a cover... and other weapons or tools.

The five people used the sacks to cover themselves, wrapping themselves into round balls and rolling their bodies, looking like five meatballs spinning around. If one were trapped in the formation, the five would use this flexibility to their advantage, making it truly棘手 and difficult to handle.

Suddenly, the five reached into their sacks and each pulled out a weapon or hidden projectile: "sword," "spear," "staff," "dart," etc. Combined with the formation, they would attack, capture, and harass... in a hundred变幻 ways, truly unpredictable.

They suddenly changed their technique, all throwing their sacks at once. The threads of the sacks scattered into a sky-full of iron wires, tangling and connecting with each other, instantly binding the target in place. The five then walked according to a specific footwork. The wires would either strangle or bind the enemy...

This formation had many奇妙 points. It was difficult to grasp just by watching from the side; only by being inside the formation would one know its true terror.

Furthermore, all five could produce a "Chest Drum Thunder Sound." Using the sack to cover someone, combined with the Chest Drum Thunder Sound to defend or intimidate... there were a thousand and one奇妙 applications.

"Martial artists... don't necessarily have to fight alone. No matter how powerful a martial artist is, if surrounded and killed by a formation, they could still fall into danger. Formations and martial arts are not fundamentally different; both are derived from insights into the heavens and earth. This Five Elements Flower Veil Formation contains insights into the Five Elements of heaven and earth, and is combined with the Five Elements Strange Escape."

Li Xian couldn't help but ponder: "My attainment in the Five Elements Strange Escape has already shown some promise. If I were in the formation, combining the Five Elements Strange Escape and my understanding of martial arts, could I break this formation?"

As he watched from the side, he thought of strategies to break the formation. He realized that using martial arts alone would be difficult to crack. Because the five figures were agile, and with the formation's changes, they never engaged in direct combat. Moreover... there was a hidden sense of "Five Elements transformation" within the formation.

Martial arts are derived from insights into heaven and earth. Executing martial arts is not just about fist and foot techniques, but also the evolution of insight. The sense of "Five Elements transformation" in the formation disrupts the evolution of martial arts. Martial arts techniques, the power of internal energy... are naturally weakened.

Li Xian watched for a moment and already had a strategy to break the formation in his heart. It required combining martial arts and the Five Elements Strange Escape, first following its principles, then breaking it from within. He deeply felt that his recent studies were not in vain. Martial artists have a long lifespan and should be more learned and refined.

The lake waves were calm.

Li Xian gazed at the lake surface from afar. Suddenly, he saw the boat sail into a region of pitch-black water, faintly emitting a chilling aura. This place was the "Frozen Water Area," where the water was extremely cold. Dongran Lake was vast, and strange water areas were often seen. Some hid dangers, some hid treasures.

Tang Feng came to the deck, saw the dark water, and shouted a few words of praise. He immediately ordered people to cast iron nets to catch fish and beasts in the lake area. The water here was cold and dark, nurturing the "Cold Heart Strange Fish."

This fish was a medicinal herb. When boiled into a fish paste, it could heal burns and resist the torment of intense fire. Its value was not insignificant. Every time the Flower Cage Gate's flower boat passed this area, it would cast nets to catch some along the way and sell them elsewhere.

Tang Feng laughed and said, "Brother Hua, come, give me a hand!" Tang Feng personally held an iron net and threw it forcefully onto the lake surface. The net spread out across the sky and sank rapidly the moment it touched the water.

Tang Feng's wrist shook. With every shake, the lake surface trembled, raising tiny splashes. He played the "Thousand Jun Immortal Sound" internally, transmitting it through his palm into the net. The net became as heavy as a thousand jun, sinking rapidly into the water to cover the fish and beasts.

With this one cast... the net was filled with too many fish and beasts, making it extremely heavy. Li Xian flashed to his side, grabbed the net's rope, wound it around his arm, and then pulled hard.

"Clatter!" Water splashed everywhere.

Thousands upon thousands of Cold Heart Strange Fish were pulled out of the water and scattered on the deck. Tang Feng was shocked: "What great strength!" His eyes widened. Pure physical strength and the mysterious power of internal energy... both are manifestations of strength, but there is a subtle difference. Pure physical strength refers to strength exerted purely by the body, which disappears upon leaving the body and cannot linger in the air. However, for lifting heavy objects or moving stones, it is more convenient. And when fighting at close quarters, if one's pure physical strength is strong, they gain an无形 advantage.

The mysterious power of internal energy is more profound, coming from internal energy. Before the Qi Lake's first transformation, it was very difficult to distinguish from pure physical strength. Later, as martial arts progressed and insights deepened, after the Qi Lake underwent its second and third transformations... the internal energy adapted to the natural world and gradually became able to remain in the external world. The distinction between the mysterious power of internal energy and "pure physical strength" became increasingly clear.

The mysterious power of internal energy can linger in the void. With the evolution of martial arts, it reveals many奇妙 effects. The two types of strength mutually reinforcing each other can unleash considerable power. They are often used simultaneously.

If two martial artists were to compete purely in strength. The one with greater pure physical strength would have the advantage. Therefore, when pulling the net just now, Li Xian's pure physical strength was greater, giving him more advantage. A slight display of his skill left Tang Feng astonished.

Dozens of disciples on the flower boat competed to cast their nets, trying to catch as many Cold Heart Strange Fish as possible. Li Xian also asked for an iron net. With one cast and one pull, the lake surface was "rumbling" and "clattering"... being thoroughly折腾 and ravaged.

He pulled in a large net every time. The fish and beasts on the deck piled up to the height of a calf. But the flower boat did not stop, and soon sailed past this area. Jin Shichang was at the helm, busy with affairs, and recently many flower boats were going out. Therefore, he did not delay, proceeding as quickly and urgently as possible.

Kong Yu, He Wangfu, and Wei Ze, the three patterned disciples, had originally been unconvinced by Li Xian. But seeing his immense strength and truly peerless ferocity, they all secretly exchanged glances and dared not say more.

Tang Feng made a fortune and was extremely happy, storing everything in the cabin.

That evening, the boat's banquet had a few more fresh dishes. After sailing for another two days, the slanting sun shone upon them. They had already passed the Water Altar area. Jin Shichang took a small boat and headed back.

Full-speed sailing... it would take about three or four days to leave the vicinity of the Water Altar. The last time Li Xian took Ye Cheng's flower boat, it took over ten days to reach the Water Altar. Firstly, Ye Cheng was being pursued and was not in a hurry to return to the island, lingering outside to observe the situation. Secondly, Ye Cheng and Jin Shichang drank and made merry every night; Jin Shichang was drunk and dazed most of the time, rarely at the helm.

Li Xian stood at the bow, stretching his arms and body. The fresh lake breeze blew against him, bringing indescribable joy. He murmured, "Finally out of the island." He thought that if he found an opportunity to leave now and take another path, he could摆脱 these many noisy trivial matters.

But thinking of Nan Gong Liuli, if he couldn't安置 her properly. If Li Xian fled far away like this, his heart would be uneasy. Li Xian's brows raised as he thought:

"So what if I'm a great lecher? A lecher is a lecher, a bad reputation is a bad reputation."

There was a natural, innate wickedness. As long as he held to his bottom line, the curses, slanders, misunderstandings, and jealousy of others... would all be like clouds passing before his eyes. Why bother caring too much?

Tang Feng had a water map. Following the map to sail out of the lake, after about another day, the flower boat docked. Tang Feng said, "Everyone, get on land and stretch your legs. Gather here again in two days."

The Flower Cage Gate disciples scattered in a哄. Tang Feng was on a mission to the island, and the boat was equipped with fish, honey goods, wine... The flower boat was disguised as a merchant ship, and indeed, it also served the purpose of trade.

He needed to联络 contacts and find ways to sell some of his stock; the accumulated fish goods needed to be sold as soon as possible. He disbanded the disciples for the purpose of selling the Cold Heart Strange Fish over these two days. The destination of this trip was Feilong City, and the remaining journey still involved nearly a thousand li of waterways. Naturally, along this route, he aimed to maximize profits.

Buying local products at low prices, then transporting them elsewhere to sell at high prices. A single flower boat, continuously producing benefits.

Li Xian sighed: "One really cannot become a martial artist without being shrewd." He got off the boat to move around.

This place was in Huaiyin Prefecture, Huaian County. It could be considered a prosperous water town, with a complex network of waterways. Li Xian walked slowly along a waterway and soon saw a village. Looking out, the paddy fields were arranged neatly, and farmers were working hard in the fields.

A prosperous water town...

Li Xian thought: "In previous years, at this time, Qiongtian Prefecture would already be covered in heavy snow. Here it's still like spring. Apart from the slightly cool climate, it truly lives up to being a prosperous land."

Dongran Lake was very mysterious. The existence of this lake affected the surrounding climate, making the four seasons less distinct. Li Xian strolled leisurely, aimlessly. In a daze, he walked into the fields and chatted with the farmers about farming. He entered the village and played with the children.

He spent a day in this leisurely manner. At night, he slept by a campfire in the wild. The next morning, he entered a nearby town to wander. Although Peach Blossom Town was peaceful and serene, its scale was rather small.

This town was bustling, with a constant flow of people, and a thick atmosphere of life and烟火气 filled the air. Horse-drawn carriages and ox-carts were visible everywhere on the streets. Occasionally, one could see wealthy young masters passing by in luxurious carriages, with an arrogant look on their faces.

Li Xian met the patterned disciple "He Wangfu." He was sitting in a tavern, embracing a charming beauty, enjoying himself to the fullest. The two exchanged a glance and each gave a slight nod, then parted ways.

For this outing, Li Xian carried over forty taels of silver. It was enough for ordinary purchases. He first went to a local food stall, ate and drank until he was full, then went to the black market to hunt for goods.

The black market was located on the west side of the town, with relatively dim lighting. The pedestrians were mixed, and the stalls were simple: a coarse cloth spread on the ground, with goods displayed on top. There were sellers of herbs, incomplete martial arts manuals, and various sundries...

Whenever Li Xian saw an incomplete martial arts manual, he would go and take a look. The stall owner would always boast wildly, praising Li Xian's good eye for spotting this divine skill秘籍 at a glance. If he bought it and practiced diligently, he would surely become invincible under the heavens in the future and win the hand of a beauty, and so on and so forth.

When Li Xian asked the price, the stall owner would name an exorbitant price, asking for a hundred or a thousand taels. If Li Xian wanted to leave, the stall owner would quickly lower the price, selling it for dozens or even ten taels.

The black market was a mixed bag, with many deceivers. But there were also a few奇特 items. In a corner of the black market, an old blind man was摇头晃脑, muttering some strange words.

Li Xian walked to the stall. "Old man, what are you selling here?" He casually picked up the only incomplete book on the stall to look at.

The old blind man said, "Young hero, see for yourself, the title is on the cover." Li Xian read the three characters on the cover: "Pinching Pulse Hand?"

The old blind man shook his head and said, "It's the Kan Pinching Pulse Hand." A corner of the book was damaged, and the character "Kan" was missing.

Li Xian thought to himself that he already had many martial arts and needed time to cultivate. Whether this Pinching Pulse Hand was real or fake, he didn't need to bother with it anymore. But purely out of curiosity, he casually asked, "Does this Kan Pinching Pulse Hand hide some great secret?"

The old blind man clapped his hands and said, "Young hero, you've asked the right person. This Kan Pinching Pulse Hand... is not a martial art."

Li Xian became interested and asked, "Then what is it?" The old blind man stroked his beard and smiled, "It seems today, I've met a fated person."

Li Xian smiled, "Old man, don't try to fool me. I'm just looking, I might not buy it." The moment he heard "fated person," he immediately thought of a "sucker."

The old blind man shook his head and smiled, "I've been sitting here for thirty-four days. I've met one thousand, two hundred and sixty-four visitors. Those who spoke with me, upon hearing that this book is not a martial art, immediately turned and left. Since you've stayed, it shows you don't lack martial arts. Coming to the black market to wander, your temperament is aloof; you're not here to捡漏 or take advantage of a bargain."

Li Xian smiled, "That's not necessarily true. If there's a bargain, wouldn't I refuse it?" The old blind man laughed even more, "Good, good. That's a rare open-mindedness."

Li Xian said, "Old man, you still haven't said what this Kan Pinching Pulse Hand is." The old blindman said, "Young hero, why don't you take a guess?"

Li Xian pondered for a moment and said, "Generally, books with the character 'pulse' on the cover refer to meridians. If it were a martial art, it would be about capturing and seizing meridians. If it's not a martial art... then it would refer to pulse-taking and diagnosis, related to the art of medicine."

He continued, "But neither seems to fit. Please be direct, old man."

The old blind man chuckled, "This Pinching Pulse Hand, indeed it is for pinching pulses. But it doesn't pinch a person's pulse, it pinches the river's pulse."

Li Xian was startled, thinking: "River pulse? The Great Wu Dynasty has countless river脉, complex and intricate. To this day, no one has been able to unify and catalog all the rivers under heaven. What is the principle behind pinching the river脉? Is this old man deliberately trying to trick me?"

The old blind man摇头晃脑 and said, "In ancient times, there was a scholar named Zhang Zhisong, who wanted to rectify all the rivers under heaven and compile them into a River Book. If this were accomplished, do you know what it would mean?"

Li Xian pondered, "If it's an ordinary commoner, living in a remote area, the rivers of the world have little to do with him. But if you look at the dynasty as a whole, if all the rivers in the world were compiled into a book and given a unified name, the dynasty... would surely become unprecedentedly powerful."

"Transportation of goods by water, exchange of local customs, and even local governance."

The old blind man was slightly surprised: "Good young hero, your vision and格局 are indeed not small. That's right, if the 'River Book' were to appear in the world, it would not only mean a thorough understanding of all the rivers. It would also possess the qualification to dominate the world. Wherever there is water, there can be endless life."

"If you were to command troops. Transporting troops by waterways, appearing and disappearing like a god, using troops as if divine. You should understand the power of this."

Li Xian secretly nodded, then smiled, "可惜 I have no ambition to dominate." He added, "Besides, the great affairs of the world, how could they concern a poor boy like me to worry about."

The old blind man said, "That Zhang Zhisong was too worried. He was born in a chaotic era and witnessed the struggles of the times. He gained a thread of fortune from a humble background."

"He wanted to use his literary skills to save the world and end the chaos. So he resolved to compile the River Book. If the River Book were completed, it would be a great achievement that stirs heaven and earth. The dynasty's fortune would become solid from being scattered. The dynasty could use this to breathe and develop."

"At that time, water transport would be unimpeded, regions would exchange what they had, and peace would last for generations. The people would be prosperous, the dynasty would be strong, and local noble families would also benefit. The dynasty could then use the River Book to set things right, ushering in another era of strength and peace!"

Li Xian was deeply shocked. He didn't expect to hear such a profound discourse in a small black market. For a moment, he felt deep admiration and did not doubt its truth. He sighed, "This Zhang Zhisong is truly a remarkable person."

The old blind man said, "可惜 he did not succeed. He only completed half a volume of the River Book, and this Kan Pinching Pulse Hand is the experience Zhang Zhisong wrote down when he first touched the river脉."

"By touching the river脉. To predict the flow and direction of the river, the condition of the riverbed, the fish and beasts in the river, the vegetation on the banks... If, moreover, one were to supplement it with the ability to read feng shui, though the world is vast, a single river could be fully understood."

Li Xian deeply agreed. If he had the River Book back when he and Wen Caishang were surrounded and killed,借助 the winding and complex turns of the river... Zhang Hu, Su Qiuwu, and the others would have found it very difficult to track them down. And many waterways are actually connected. Small rivers merge into big rivers, big rivers flow into small rivers.

Whether for transporting troops to dominate or for business and trade, it offers a tremendous advantage.

The old blind man added, "Furthermore... a martial artist's martial arts are derived from insights into heaven and earth. If there really were a River Book in the world, and one could悟出 one or two martial arts from it, the power of that would be可想而知."

Li Xian said, "Indeed so!"

The old blind man smiled, "So, young hero, do you want this Kan Pinching Pulse Book?" Li Xian felt curious and asked the price.

The old blind man named a sky-high price, directly saying three thousand taels of silver. Li Xian's face twitched. Although he felt the old blind man had profound knowledge, what he said might not be entirely true. Three thousand taels of silver was truly difficult for him to produce.

The old blind man added, "Fine, fine. No matter how good the thing, if it can't be sold, it's worthless. Since we are fated to meet, I'll sell you this book for thirty-nine taels, four hundred and ninety-seven copper coins."

Li Xian felt his cloth bag. The money he had left was exactly thirty-nine taels, four hundred and ninety-seven copper coins, not a penny less. Li Xian asked suspiciously, "Old man, are you really blind?"

He deeply felt the old blind man was no ordinary person. But his temperament was open-minded and did not seek to understand everything thoroughly. So he didn't press further and happily exchanged money for the book. He thought: "If what the old blind man said is true, the Kan Pinching Pulse Book isn't too exaggerated, but the River Book is of great significance."

"Even as learned as Madam, regarding the complex water systems of Qiongtian Prefecture and Huashui Prefecture... no, she would be helpless and at a loss. If I could deepen my studies in this field, I would have one skill that surpasses Madam first."

The martial way in the world... cannot do without essence treasures, and essence treasures cannot do without the two characters 'water' and 'charcoal'. Or rather, it cannot do without 'water' and 'fire'. From the small streams and rivers below, where ordinary farmers must fight, seize, and grab during irrigation seasons, to the great rivers above, where families and forces along the rivers also fight, seize, and grab.

Martial artists cannot do without water.

Water is also the origin of martial arts.

所谓的 martial arts families, are no different from village farmers. What they do is nothing but fighting for water and seizing land.

The Kan Pinching Pulse Hand is a miscellaneous book. It records geographical features and landscapes, involving feng shui, the Five Elements Strange Escape, and even human stories. Even if treated as a storybook, it is still fascinating to read.

Holding it in his hands, after flipping through the first few pages, Li Xian felt the money was well spent. This Kan Pinching Pulse Hand was written in Zhang Zhisong's early years. The content of the first few pages showed that he was just starting out, with shallow experience, but already displayed remarkable knowledge.

"Who is this Zhang Zhisong, and from what era? If I meet Madam in the future, I will ask her."

He read it carefully. As he went further, Zhang Zhisong had开创ed the奇特 techniques of "Reading the River," "Asking the River," and "Pinching the River." Li Xian read it briefly and could not yet grasp its essence for the time being.

Continuing on, there was a sentence that caught his attention: "There is a Nether River in the world, connecting to the Netherworld."
