# Chapter 58: Soul Refinement  

In an instant, a surge of malevolent energy filled the air, accompanied by faint ghostly wails. The Song brothers turned pale, their teeth chattering in terror, unable to even utter a plea for mercy.  

Three dark green flames drifted out from the Hundred Souls Banner and sank into their bodies. Under the eerie glow of the ghostly fire, Ye Tian’s expression grew even more sinister. Gripping the banner in his right hand, he continuously channeled spiritual energy into it.  

At first, the three men writhed in agony, their faces twisted with pain. Though they couldn’t move, their struggle was evident. Yet, moments later, their breathing ceased entirely.  

Ye Tian transferred the banner to his left hand and formed a seal with his right, sending several beams of white light into the corpses. Guided by the light, three yellow orbs—their souls—were forcibly pulled from their bodies.  

The souls struggled desperately to escape, but Ye Tian snorted coldly and waved the small banner. A surge of black energy swept forth, ensnaring the yellow orbs.  

"Seal!"  

The Hundred Souls Banner expanded abruptly, and the ghostly mist swirling around it coalesced into a monstrous skull, which swallowed the three souls whole.  

Ye Tian’s expression remained tense. One after another, he channeled seals into the banner, his hands outstretched as dark green ghostly flames spewed forth.  

The refinement had begun.  

*Should I intervene, or take this chance to leave?*  

Lin Xuan hesitated briefly before turning away expressionlessly. Though his strength had grown significantly, demonic cultivators were far too unpredictable and mysterious.  

Acting recklessly without certainty was unwise.  

Moreover, as a mere Qi Refinement cultivator, Ye Tian’s possessions were unlikely to be valuable. The potential gains from killing him were negligible, while the risk of failure was too great. Lin Xuan had no illusions about being a righteous hero—he wouldn’t take risks without clear benefits.  

Weighing the pros and cons, Lin Xuan decided to leave. He would pretend he had seen nothing today and simply avoid Ye Tian in the future.  

Carefully suppressing his aura, Lin Xuan descended the mountain. Moments later, his figure vanished into the distance.  

Seated cross-legged, Ye Tian suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze fixed in the direction Lin Xuan had left. A glint of murderous intent flashed in his eyes.  

Had it not been for the souls within the Hundred Souls Banner being acutely sensitive to living auras, he wouldn’t have detected the presence of an onlooker. Whoever it was, they could not be allowed to live.  

Gritting his teeth, Ye Tian intensified his efforts, refining the three souls with full concentration. Fortunately, the cultivators had been weak, and their souls were not particularly resilient. Soon, they were fully assimilated into the banner.  

Clutching the demonic artifact, Ye Tian’s face twisted with manic glee. But when he looked up, his entire body radiated terrifying bloodlust. Locking onto the path Lin Xuan had taken, he gave chase in a frenzy.  

---  

Lin Xuan had not yet returned to Piaoyun Valley. What he had witnessed today sent chills down his spine—fellow disciples turning on each other, souls being extracted. He hadn’t expected a demonic cultivator to be hiding within the sect.  

Today’s events served as a stark reminder: cultivation was not only arduous but perilous. A single misstep could lead to utter annihilation. If he wanted to walk this path further, he needed to be ever vigilant.  

Of course, the most crucial factor was strength. Power was the first law of survival in the cultivation world.  

Lin Xuan suddenly halted. His spiritual sense was far sharper than that of his peers, and he detected someone approaching rapidly—carrying a violent, bloodthirsty aura.  

*Ye Tian!*  

Lin Xuan recognized him instantly. He quickly checked his body and his expression darkened. Silently channeling a technique, he released a wisp of spiritual energy to envelop himself.  

Then, he retrieved a talisman from his robes and affixed it to his body. A strange phenomenon occurred—the solid earth beneath his feet turned into loose, shifting sand. Lin Xuan sank entirely into the ground, and moments later, the sand reverted to ordinary soil.  

Not long after, Ye Tian arrived at the spot, his face filled with suspicion as he scanned the surroundings. Earlier, while refining the Hundred Souls Banner, the onlooker had been tainted with traces of Yin energy—too faint to be noticeable, but detectable through the souls within the banner.  

Yet inexplicably, that presence had vanished.  

*Had the target detected him first?*  

*Was he a Foundation Establishment cultivator?*  

Ye Tian’s thoughts raced. Demonic cultivators possessed far stronger spiritual senses than their orthodox counterparts, and thanks to the rapid progress of demonic techniques, he had already reached the sixth layer of Qi Refinement. His spiritual sense surpassed even those at the peak of Qi Refinement.  

In other words, only a Foundation Establishment expert could have detected him in advance.  

But if that were the case, why hadn’t the opponent struck him down at the mountaintop?  

Perplexed, Ye Tian grew increasingly paranoid. He had no way of knowing that Lin Xuan was an anomaly. Whether through the trials of the Heart-Tempering Path or the refinement of pills and herbs, Lin Xuan’s spiritual sense had been honed to extraordinary levels.  

In terms of spiritual sense alone, Lin Xuan was no weaker than an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator!  

Even the wisest may err. Initially, Lin Xuan had been slightly careless, failing to notice the faint traces of Yin energy clinging to him. But now that he had enveloped himself in spiritual energy, Ye Tian could no longer track him.  

---  

Unable to locate his target, Ye Tian grew anxious. Though he couldn’t discern the opponent’s true strength, if the sect discovered he had used his fellow disciples’ souls to refine a demonic artifact, he would face dire consequences.  

Gritting his teeth, Ye Tian’s face twisted with cruelty. He retrieved the Hundred Souls Banner and channeled spiritual energy into it. A thick, rolling black mist erupted from the banner, spreading outward in all directions.  

Lin Xuan had no intention of waiting passively. Though he didn’t know what technique Ye Tian was preparing, the ominous aura made it clear that this wouldn’t end peacefully.  

In that case, striking first was the wiser choice.  

Without a sound, Lin Xuan raised his hand. Though buried underground, the Quicksand Talisman allowed him to move freely. The only drawback was the inability to breathe, but at his current cultivation level, holding his breath for over ten minutes was no issue.
