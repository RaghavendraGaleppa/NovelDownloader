# Chapter 43: The Pocket-Sized Elephant – A Star Spirit of Forty Millennia

A brilliant arrow of light streaked across the void like a golden meteor, trailing a dazzling tail of flame.

Lan Tianlu had just shattered Gu Yuan's secret seal and was reveling in his triumph when the sharp, lethal energy abruptly pierced toward his forehead. His Star Spirit frantically warned him, filling his heart with unprecedented panic.

"No!" Lan Tianlu roared, his energy surging as he desperately tried to block the attack. But the power of the "Arrow Dao" surpassed even that of the "Sword Seal." It was a force compressed and accumulated over an unknown length of time, now unleashed with earth-shattering might.

**Bang!**

Lan Tianlu's expression froze. Icy blue blood gushed from his forehead as his massive body shrank rapidly, like a deflating balloon, before crashing lifelessly to the ground.

**Huff...**

Seeing Lan Tianlu completely devoid of life, Gu Yuan exhaled deeply, his legs giving way as he sat cross-legged to recover his spiritual energy. Meanwhile, fine powder from spent spirit stones trickled between his fingers.

Gu Yuan had long prepared for this confrontation with Lan Tianlu, stockpiling numerous techniques and breaking through to the sixth level of Qi Refinement. He had expected this battle to be easily won.

Yet, Lan Tianlu's strength had exceeded his expectations.

Originally, Gu Yuan believed that activating sixty Dao patterns and unleashing half the power of the Secret Origin Arrow would be enough to kill his opponent. But the unexpected twist in the Mist Cloud Seal forced him to drain all his spiritual energy—even exhausting the spirit stones—just to fully unleash the arrow's power and secure victory.

That icy blue "Giant's Strength" had nearly rendered all his preparations futile.

"Thankfully, I was cautious enough to choose the Secret Origin Arrow for its decisive strike. Had I gone with the Nine Elephants Seal, I might not have been his match."

After meditating briefly and recovering some energy, Gu Yuan opened his eyes, deep in thought.

"That power earlier couldn't have been something Lan Tianlu cultivated himself. The Giant's Strength—its force likely exceeded a hundred thousand jin. A normal sixth-level Qi Refinement cultivator would be crushed in a single blow. How could he have mastered that in just a few months?"

In this world of cultivation, beyond the power of seals, the path of physical strength also held terrifying might. However, cultivating raw strength was an even more arduous branch of the "Dao of Techniques." To pursue it required special "Body Seals," such as the "Mountain-Lifting Seal," the "Tyrant Seal," or the "Colossus Seal." Only by refining these unique seals could one temper their body to achieve such devastating power.

But even with these seals, strengthening the body was a slow, gradual process—impossible to rush without risking self-destruction.

"There must be something else at play here."

Gu Yuan stood, extending his spiritual sense to search the battlefield for answers.

**Moo!**

Just then, a tiny creature burst from Lan Tianlu's forehead, attempting to flee as a streak of light.

**Bang!**

Gu Yuan had been watching closely. He immediately summoned his spiritual energy, weaving it into a net that trapped the creature mid-air.

**Moo! Moo!**

The tiny being struggled frantically, but its strength was pitiful—no match for Gu Yuan's binding.

"Is this... a Star Spirit?"

Now, Gu Yuan could see it clearly: a pocket-sized "elephant," no larger than a ladybug. Its body shimmered ice-blue, exuding a faint chill, its skin covered in intricate blue patterns that pulsed with an enigmatic Dao rhythm. The miniature elephant even seemed to cultivate—inhaling wisps of spiritual energy with each breath, brightening the patterns on its body.

"It really is a Star Spirit! How did Lan Tianlu obtain such a treasure?"

Gu Yuan was stunned.

This tiny elephant was one of the rarest beings in existence—a Star Spirit, also known as a "living seal."

*"When stars fall from the heavens, they carry the Dao patterns of the cosmos, condensing the essence of sun and moon. Upon landing, they transform into spirits—living embodiments of the Dao, granting those who nurture them an additional technique."*

This was the description from *Forty Millennia of Star Spirits* in the Scripture Pavilion.

Legend held that tens of thousands of years ago, as the world's structure stabilized, celestial stars would occasionally descend. These stars underwent profound transformations during their descent, eventually giving birth to these peculiar creatures upon impact. Neither beast nor demon, Star Spirits were like living seals—sentient yet simple-minded, akin to small animals with limited awareness of their own abilities.

At birth, their Dao patterns were sparse, their powers weak. Some were even accidentally consumed by mindless beasts. Yet, the Star Spirits did not perish. Instead, the beasts that ate them gained their abilities, acquiring an additional "technique."

Moreover, Star Spirits could be nurtured. The better they were raised, the more they grew, amplifying the power of their innate "technique."

There were tales of great demons in the Eastern Sea who, wielding Star Spirits, had clashed with the descendants of true dragons, shaking the heavens.

As knowledge of Star Spirits spread, factions, rogue cultivators, and noble clans began scouring the land for them, desperate to harness their power.

But Star Spirits were elusive. When they fell, they left no fiery trails, no brilliant flashes—just tiny, unassuming stones dropping silently to the earth, barely stirring the dust. Even Golden Core or Nascent Soul cultivators could not detect them with spiritual sense; they had to rely on sight alone.

This made Star Spirits exceedingly rare.

Gu Yuan had only read about them in texts. He had never seen one in person, nor had he heard of any being sold in markets.

Yet Lan Tianlu had possessed one.

"Was that overwhelming strength earlier derived from this little thing?"

Gu Yuan stared at the toy-like elephant, momentarily dazed.

**Pfft!**

As if sensing his disbelief—or perhaps frustrated at being trapped—the Star Spirit curled its tiny trunk, its patterns flashing as it spat a thin stream of icy blue liquid at Gu Yuan.

**Whoosh!**

The stream dissipated harmlessly against his spiritual barrier.

**Pfft! Pfft!**

Annoyed, the Star Spirit sprayed repeatedly, its tiny legs stomping in agitation.

**Moo! Moo! Moo!**

When its attacks proved futile, it let out a series of high-pitched cries—less like an elephant's trumpet and more like a baby demanding milk.

Gu Yuan chuckled, then remembered something. He retrieved a spirit beast pouch from Lan Tianlu's corpse, wiped away its imprint, and opened it. Inside, he found a small, glowing spirit jujube.

The Star Spirit's eyes lit up instantly, its cries growing urgent.

**Munch!**

Gu Yuan tossed the jujube over, and the tiny elephant eagerly caught it with its trunk, nibbling happily—completely forgetting it was still trapped.
