# Chapter 57: The Art of Wood Escape Talisman  

To avoid running into Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang from next door, Chu Ning deliberately set out early and arrived at the training ground ahead of them.  

The training ground for the Spirit Plant Division was located in the same area as the Technique Transmission Hall, not far from the spirit plant cultivation fields. By the time Chu Ning arrived, several people were already seated inside.  

However, these were all unfamiliar faces to Chu Ning, so he saw no need to greet anyone. After a quick glance, he noticed that there were many available seats in the training ground.  

Uncertain whether seating arrangements mattered, and to avoid unnecessary trouble, he simply chose a spot in the corner.  

Before long, Lu Ming, Chen Jinhua, and the others who had been promoted alongside him the previous day also arrived. Seeing where Chu Ning was sitting, they joined him in the corner.  

The six newly promoted disciples occupying the corner drew occasional glances from the others. However, since everyone seemed aware of the recent promotions, no one appeared overly surprised.  

As more disciples filed in, the training ground soon filled with over two hundred people.  

Chu Ning observed the crowd, his expression growing more solemn.  

Apart from himself, the lowest cultivation level in the room was at the sixth level of Qi Refining. And among those at the sixth level, aside from the few newly promoted disciples near him, there were only a handful of others.  

But upon reflection, this made sense.  

Unlike the Outer Sect, where some talented but newly admitted disciples could be found, the Spirit Plant Division’s Third District was composed entirely of promoted labor disciples from the Fourth District. None of them had particularly outstanding aptitudes, and without a certain level of cultivation, they wouldn’t have been promoted in the first place.  

"Even with my actual cultivation at the fifth level of Qi Refining, I’d still be at the very bottom here," Chu Ning mused inwardly.  

And right now, he was only outwardly displaying the fourth level of Qi Refining.  

No wonder everyone had looked so surprised when he was promoted the day before.  

As Chu Ning was lost in thought, the training ground suddenly fell silent.  

He Changyou had entered and taken his seat at the front.  

"Today, I’ve gathered all the disciples of the Third District for one matter only," He Changyou began, cutting straight to the point just as he had the previous day.  

"The sect has decided to increase its efforts in nurturing labor disciples, selecting those with talent to teach them specialized cultivation arts."  

At these words, the disciples were momentarily stunned before their faces lit up with excitement.  

Previously, even in the Third District, aside from cultivation work, only a handful of disciples had been assigned basic tasks in the Hundred Arts Hall.  

Chu Ning, for instance, was responsible for making talisman paper—one of the few exceptions.  

Now, hearing that they would have the chance to truly learn these arts, everyone was overjoyed.  

"So it's true!" Chu Ning's eyes gleamed with anticipation.  

The news Mu Ling had shared with him earlier was indeed accurate. What surprised him, however, was how quickly it had come to fruition—just one day after his promotion to the Third District.  

"Among the Hundred Arts of Cultivation, the most crucial are undoubtedly alchemy, talismans, artifact forging, and formations," He Changyou continued.  

"Most of us in the Spirit Plant Division practice wood-attribute techniques, so talisman-making is the most suitable. Of course, if you’re confident in other arts, you may choose them instead. We’ll discuss that individually later."  

As he spoke, He Changyou flicked his wrist, sending a stack of papers flying toward the disciples. Each sheet landed neatly in front of one person.  

"The sect’s scriptures are precious, so we can’t teach talisman-making to everyone. What you have here is the method for crafting the Wood Escape Talisman, a basic low-grade talisman. Take it back and practice for five days.  

"After five days, the ten disciples with the highest quality and success rate will be formally taught the art of talisman-making."  

The announcement sent a wave of murmurs through the training ground.  

"Five days? Even though the Wood Escape Talisman is a basic low-grade talisman, how can anyone master it in just five days? And with a decent success rate, no less!"  

"We’ve never learned talisman-making before. Expecting us to master this in five days is too much!"  

The complaints reached He Changyou’s ears, and his expression darkened. He swept his gaze over the disciples before speaking coolly:  

"It seems you’ve forgotten what I said at the beginning. The sect is selecting those with talent. If you don’t believe you have what it takes and aren’t willing to spend these five days trying, you may return the method to me now."  

Silence fell instantly. No one dared to speak up again.  

Satisfied, He Changyou stood to leave but paused at the exit, turning back for one last remark.  

"Five days from now, anyone with a success rate below twenty percent will be disqualified from the evaluation."  

The disciples exchanged uneasy glances. Twenty percent? Achieving a twenty percent success rate in just five days?  

Even those with some knowledge of talisman-making knew that seasoned talisman masters typically only achieved a forty to fifty percent success rate with familiar talismans.  

A sixty percent success rate was considered exceptional—reserved only for the most gifted.  

As He Changyou departed, sighs filled the training ground.  

Then, the duty disciple who had remained silent behind He Changyou—a man in his late twenties—spoke up.  

"If you wish to purchase a talisman brush and ink from the sect, come to me. One brush, one ink set, and fifty sheets of talisman paper—twelve spirit stones for the set."  

The moment his words landed, the room erupted.  

"Twelve spirit stones? That’s too expensive!"  

Jiang Dawei, one of the newly promoted disciples beside Chu Ning, grimaced.  

For those who had just ascended from the Fourth District, twelve spirit stones were no small sum. Even for someone like Jiang Dawei, who had managed better harvests than most, it amounted to an entire season’s earnings.  

After all, not everyone could make money as effortlessly as Chu Ning did through talisman paper.  

Even the original Third District disciples wore pained expressions.  

A fair-skinned disciple who looked like a scholar was the first to voice his discontent.  

"Senior Brother Liu, the sect expects us to test ourselves, but we have to buy our own brushes and ink? And at such a high price?"  

"Take it or leave it," Senior Brother Liu cut him off coldly, leaving the disciple speechless.  

Soon, a few disciples stood up and approached Senior Brother Liu to purchase the materials.  

Seeing this, others gradually followed suit.  

Though Chu Ning had already made up his mind, he didn’t rush to join the line immediately.  

He first watched as Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang stepped forward without hesitation. Then, after about twenty others had lined up behind them, he finally rose with a conflicted expression and joined the queue.  

Twelve spirit stones—it didn’t matter where he bought them.  

What truly excited Chu Ning was the realization that he was finally getting the chance to craft talismans for real!
