# Chapter 15: The Third Divine Ability

Han Yue was unaware that among the many cultivators in the inner domain, very few could successfully refine the Thread Armor in a single attempt. 

Normally, when early-stage cultivators obtained the Thread Armor, they would only use their excess mana to refine it, provided it didn't interfere with their own cultivation. Moreover, due to the insufficient quality of most cultivators' mana, this refinement process was extremely lengthy, often taking decades. 

Those who could successfully refine the Thread Armor before reaching the perfected stage of the first-rank Foundation Establishment were considered to have achieved a commendable result. Only after advancing to the second rank, where their mana reserves increased significantly, could cultivators continuously refine the armor. 

Han Yue's successful refinement this time was entirely due to the high-tier mana quality of his [Thoughtless Slash] and his deep mana reserves—achieved through sheer brute force. 

Successfully refining the Thread Armor ahead of time was a tremendous boon to Han Yue's cultivation path! 

However, the additional burden of mana consumption was undeniably real. Han Yue needed to find a new source of mana. 

He reviewed his personal information once more:

**[Host: Han Yue]**  
**[Realm: First-rank Body Entry (Foundation Establishment Stage)]**  
**[Cultivation Method: "Nourishing Body Thunder"]**  
**[Magical Artifact: Thread Armor]**  
**[Keywords: None]**  
**[Divine Ability Extraction: Conditions Not Met]**  

**First Page:**  
**[Divine Ability: Jade Void·Golden Light Flight]**  
**[Quality: Mythic·Gold]**  
**[Proficiency: Beginner (7%)]**  
**[Keyword: Movement]**  

**Second Page:**  
**[Divine Ability: Raiden Shogun·Thoughtless Slash]**  
**[Quality: Epic·Purple]**  
**[Proficiency: Beginner (47%)]**  
**[Keyword: Severing]**  

Due to insufficient mana reserves, the proficiency of [Golden Light Flight] hadn't increased at all. However, [Thoughtless Slash] had steadily grown in experience thanks to Han Yue's refinement of thunder techniques and his daily participation in meat distribution. 

In Han Yue's judgment, it was time to extract his third divine ability! 

Over the past few months, Han Yue had constantly pondered how to better utilize the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws*. Every divine ability he obtained from it would profoundly impact his future. 

Given the circumstances of his transmigration, Han Yue's first two divine abilities had been chosen out of necessity—maximizing escape and offensive capabilities. These two abilities had provided him with immense help, giving him a foothold in this world. 

But in Han Yue's plan, extracting a divine ability that could accelerate his cultivation speed and aid his rapid growth would be the most beneficial at this stage! 

---

This time, the extraction wasn't as urgent, allowing Han Yue to plan carefully. 

He listed out keywords that could meet his requirements, inputting them one by one into the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws* to test the results. 

**Keyword: [Growth]**  
*"Ding! Extraction conditions met! Proceed with extraction?"*  
*"No!"*  

**Keyword: [Resources]**  
*"Ding! Extraction conditions met! Proceed with extraction?"*  
*"No!"*  

**Keyword: [Talent]**  
*"Ding! Extraction conditions not met!"*  

After continuous attempts, Han Yue still hadn't found the perfect fit. Even though some keywords allowed extraction, they only met the minimum requirements. The indicators on the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws* barely crossed the first threshold, not even approaching the second. Extracting now would likely result in a low-quality divine ability. 

Han Yue remained patient. He hoped to find a keyword that could push the indicator to the second threshold, ensuring a high probability of obtaining an Epic (Purple) quality divine ability. 

He continued testing: **[Wealth]**, **[Money]**, **[Profit]**—none worked. As someone who had been poor in both lifetimes, keywords related to wealth simply weren't recognized. 

Finally, after exhausting all possible keywords, Han Yue found two that could reach the second threshold:  

**[Consumption]** and **[Energy]!**  

After careful consideration, Han Yue settled on his third divine ability's keyword:  

**[Energy]!**  

Between the two choices, the keyword **[Consumption]** could lead to absorption- or digestion-type divine abilities. Han Yue judged that there was a high probability of obtaining a body-enhancing absorption ability—though there was also a chance of obtaining a devouring-type offensive ability. 

In comparison, **[Energy]** aligned more closely with Han Yue's needs. 

Once decided, Han Yue didn't hesitate. He summoned the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws* and placed his palm on the third page. 

*"Ding! Extraction conditions met! Proceed with extraction?"*  
*"Extraction keyword: [Energy]!"*  
*"Extract!"*  

*"Ding! Congratulations, you have obtained the divine ability [Gu Immortal·Celestial Treasure Emperor Lotus]!"*  

In an instant, a surge of pure white energy erupted from the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws*, converging toward Han Yue's dantian! 

Han Yue felt as though his dantian was about to burst from the sudden influx of energy. He channeled all his strength into operating *Nourishing Body Thunder* to absorb this pure energy! 

---

Massive amounts of thunderforce began generating, rushing toward the runes of [Thoughtless Slash]. One after another, *Nourishing Body Thunder* runes condensed! 

Han Yue exerted every ounce of effort to digest this energy. Soon, however, *Nourishing Body Thunder* could no longer keep up with the energy supply. 

Han Yue redirected the remaining energy into his sea of consciousness, flooding it into the two divine ability talismans. 

The process lasted for a long while before finally stabilizing. 

Han Yue's body was now completely saturated with energy! 

Both [Thoughtless Slash] and [Golden Light Flight] were fully charged! His meridians brimmed with thunderforce refined by [Thoughtless Slash]! 

Han Yue felt an unprecedented surge of power—no longer the man who hesitated to use his abilities for fear of exhaustion. 

On the third page of the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws*, the following information appeared:  

**[Divine Ability: Gu Immortal·Celestial Treasure Emperor Lotus]**  
**[Quality: Epic·Purple]**  
**[Tier: Locked to Host's Realm]**  
**[Keyword: Energy]**  

Han Yue had finally obtained his third divine ability! 

He was immensely satisfied with this result. 

**[Celestial Treasure Emperor Lotus]** would fundamentally resolve Han Yue's current predicament—his insufficient cultivation realm and mana scarcity preventing him from freely using his divine abilities. 

This was a qualitative improvement in every aspect! 

Moreover, the massive energy obtained during the extraction of **[Celestial Treasure Emperor Lotus]** had been successfully absorbed by Han Yue. 

This windfall of mana had also granted him the most significant cultivation progress since his transmigration. 

Han Yue focused inward. 

In his sea of consciousness, the two divine ability talismans shone brilliantly. 

Within his dantian, 365 *Nourishing Body Thunder* runes orbited a small white lotus. 

His progress in *Nourishing Body Thunder* had skyrocketed! 

Han Yue had reached the perfected stage described in the *Nourishing Body Thunder* scripture.
