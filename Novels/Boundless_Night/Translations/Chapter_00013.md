# Chapter 13: Passion Fades

Xu Yueping remained silent. It wasn't until they had left Silvervine Town that he rushed into the gloomy forest, slamming his fist hard against a large tree, sending snow rattling down from the branches.

"If it weren't for my wife, children, and old parents, or if I were twenty years younger, I would have dragged Feng Yi'an down with me today, even if it meant my death!" He gasped, his heart heavy with suppression, his arms trembling slightly.

He had been humiliated in that private room, and the finger marks were still on his face. As a man, he couldn't swallow this insult. But he had a family and was no longer young; the burdens and obligations forced him to endure. He clenched his fists and murmured, "My passion has been worn away by life."

Qin Ming didn't know how to comfort him, his own emotions fluctuating with Xu Yueping's. "Uncle Xu, don't let them get to you. Their evil deeds will catch up to them sooner or later."

It was a long while before Xu Yueping exhaled a turbid breath. "Let's go back," he said.

Small snowflakes still drifted in the night sky. There wasn't much conversation between them on the way, but Qin Ming tried to find topics to alleviate the heavy atmosphere. "Why haven't they cleared the mountain yet?"

Xu Yueping replied, "The higher-ups are probably still negotiating with the mysterious creatures in the mountain."

He then looked grim as he mentioned something else: the Patrol Team had a catalytic liquid being prepared, and it would be delivered to Twin Trees Village in three days to be poured into the fire spring. It was obvious that this liquid, beneficial for the Black Moon seeds to sprout, would be harmful to the fire spring.

"Have the other villages all agreed?" Qin Ming asked.

Xu Yueping sighed, "There were some twists with three of the villages. Based on the continuous decline in fire field yields over recent years, they also suspected there was a problem with the seeds. But in the end, they couldn't withstand the pressure and agreed. Only the neighboring Green Mulberry Village remains. The Patrol Team is wary of the person who gave the Second Freak advanced cultivation methods, so they haven't dared to push too hard."

"It's almost mid-month," Qin Ming observed, looking at the dark sky. He already knew that the Patrol Team members only appeared together in the mountains around mid-month and at the end of the month.

Just then, a giant ox with fiery red fur emerged from a fork in the road opposite them, making it impossible not to draw attention. Its back was significantly taller than an adult man, and its thick, long fur gleamed with a reddish glow. Besides two normal curved horns, it had a straight, sharp, sword-like horn in the center of its forehead. Clearly, this was a mutated creature.

But what was most striking was the man riding on it. He was extraordinarily tall; if he stood on the ground, he would likely exceed three meters. His long black hair reached his shoulders, and his eyes were like knife blades as he swept a glance over the two of them. The fiery red mutated giant ox trampled the accumulated snow, moving very fast as it galloped towards Silvervine Town.

"There's actually someone that tall," Qin Ming exclaimed in surprise.

"He's walking a different path," Xu Yueping said, watching the retreating figure.

"Is it due to premature Rebirth, leading to early overgrowth?" Qin Ming asked. According to the experience summarized by predecessors, the optimal time for the body's Rebirth was around fifteen or sixteen years old, as it allowed one to lay a golden foundation. If it occurred too early, it was very easy for the body to become imbalanced because at that time the body was already in a period of rapid growth. Adding "Rebirth" to promote it might lead to growth hormone disruption, eventually turning one into a giant. The most crucial point was that most such giants would die young, as their bodies often spun out of control after such drastic changes.

Xu Yueping explained, "Only major noble families have the experience of previous sages. They pour vast resources into such individuals to enable them to grow. A few giants can survive and, once they rise, become extremely formidable, capable of overcoming many with brute force."

"Such people walk the Giant Spirit God path," Xu Yueping stated, emphasizing that ordinary families simply couldn't afford to nurture them. He guessed that the man and his mount just now likely came from Scarlet Mist City.

Touching on the topic of body Rebirth, Qin Ming naturally brought up Fu Entao, the leader of the Patrol Team. Xu Yueping turned to him, saying, "Little Qin, you're not thinking of seeking them out, are you? Don't even think about it."

Qin Ming shook his head. "Uncle Xu, you're overthinking. I'm just a newcomer. What qualifications or strength do I have to confront a Second Rebirther?"

Xu Yueping breathed a sigh of relief. He was truly afraid that Qin Ming, in a moment of impulse, might jeopardize himself. "While the First Rebirth is comprehensive, it actually focuses more on strength. The Second Rebirth, however, leans slightly towards physical qualities like flexibility and speed."

As they chatted along the way, Qin Ming gradually began to outline Fu Entao's prominent domains and power level in his mind.

During their return, they entered the dense forest multiple times, not wanting to go back empty-handed. They hoped to bring back a few prey animals for families struggling with food shortages.

"That was close! Even I, a Rebirther, almost got hurt. The wild creatures are restless from time to time; we really do need to clear the mountain," Xu Yueping said with a lingering fear. A mutated "Spiked Leopard" had just ambushed him from behind, like a black lightning bolt, completely unpredictable. If Qin Ming hadn't intervened, he would have been knocked down.

"This area has just seen the emergence of mutated plants, making it quite dangerous. We shouldn't linger."

The two didn't delay, dragging the mutated Spiked Leopard with them. It weighed a hefty 450 jin (approx. 496 lbs) and was covered in five-inch long black spikes from its belly to its head.

Upon returning to the village, Qin Ming immediately felt a sense of oppression and gloom. Even the children, who usually loved playing in the snow, were fewer in number. Xu Yueping finished distributing the Spiked Leopard meat to each household before heading home. He was utterly exhausted, mainly on a psychological level.

Qin Ming stood by the bright fire spring, gazing out at the wilderness. Distant, faint mountain shadows were faintly discernible. "The catalytic liquid will be delivered in three days and poured into the fire spring. You're forcing people onto a dead end, leaving no time at all," he murmured.

He walked towards the wilderness, preparing to enter the mountains. "I'll scout the path first." It was still early night; he wasn't planning any drastic actions yet. Most importantly, it was still two days until mid-month.

"Must you force people onto a dead end? Disregarding next year's famine, ignoring the lives of others." Qin Ming strode into the mountain forest. This time, he didn't carry his hunting fork, as it was no longer needed after his full body Rebirth. He only brought a bow and arrows and a wood-cutting knife. He knew the Patrol Team's outpost and walked with firm steps in a specific direction. The wind was fierce, and the snow continued to fall. This environment in the mountains was advantageous for him, helping to erase any traces he left behind.

Each Patrol Team was responsible for a specific region, covering six to eight villages. Fu Entao and Feng Yi'an's resting place when they recuperated was ahead, not deep into the mountains. Along the way, Qin Ming tried to avoid any mutated beasts he encountered, not wanting to stir up trouble. After traversing a large area of forest and crossing several mountains, he approached his destination.

A mountain peak emitted faint red light. There was a miniature fire spring there, barely reaching Level 1, not as bright as the one in Twin Trees Village, but it was more than sufficient as a Patrol Team outpost. This place had once been occupied by a powerful mutated creature years ago, before Fu Entao led a team to surround and kill it. Deeper in the mountain range were higher-grade fire springs with excellent environments, which the mysterious creatures dwelling there wouldn't bother with the dim fire springs on the periphery.

Qin Ming observed from an adjacent peak. On the opposite side, fire mist flowed, and several wooden cabins were built on a flat area, with figures moving around. Normally, at most two or three patrol members would be active in the vicinity. When they acted together, it was only to search for mutated plants and spirited creatures, hoping to achieve Second Rebirth.

"They're raising a mutated creature with a keen sense of smell," Qin Ming frowned. There was a large golden mastiff there, its size comparable to a tiger. He then showed indignation, having spotted a glossy-furred snow ape, clearly a domesticated anomaly, bathing in the fire spring. Some villagers had been attacked by snow apes before, with some suffering broken ribs and others nearly having their arms torn off.

Qin Ming silently watched the peak for a long time, finally disappearing without a sound into the night. He emerged from the forest and looked towards Twin Trees Village. Under the night sky, fire mist shimmered at the village entrance, the nearby houses seemingly edged with gold, revealing hazy outlines. Smoke curled up from some homes.

This was originally a soft, beautiful scene, but upon entering the village, Qin Ming heard sounds of weeping. "Uncle Qian didn't make it. He just passed away, sigh!" Many villagers stood outside the Qian family's door, some unable to hold back a sigh. "Old Qian was old. That snow ape almost tore his neck, and he barely held on until now."

Qin Ming listened quietly, not speaking. This was already the third person to die in this incident. Xu Yueping and Old Man Liu also arrived, both looking grave. They knew the truth and felt immense hatred for Feng Yi'an and his group.

The next day, as Uncle Qian's funeral procession began, members of the Patrol Team appeared at the village entrance. Feng Yi'an sighed and stepped forward, handing a roe deer to the Qian family. Watching his feigned sympathy as he comforted the Qian family's elderly and young, even the oldest, Old Man Liu, felt disgusted and turned his face away. The Qian family, unaware of the truth, remained grateful to him. Qin Ming silently clenched his fists. A roe deer for a human life? The hidden truth was stark and bloody; Uncle Qian's life seemed incredibly cheap.

A tall man in armor spoke up, "Whether it was that Blood Bear or that vicious Snow Ape, we've already killed them both. Everyone can now safely go hunting in the mountains." Qin Ming recognized him; his name was Shao Chengfeng. Once, when entering the mountains, Qin Ming and Yang Yongqing had encountered this man on the road. At the time, he had even thought Shao Chengfeng was responsible and hardworking for patrolling the mountains late at night. Now, this man was speaking blatant lies, taking credit for evil deeds, which was truly despicable.

Subsequently, several members of the Patrol Team sought out Xu Yueping. They weren't there to comfort the villagers, but to personally inspect the planting of the Black Moon seeds. "Brother Xu, you've worked hard," Feng Yi'an said, patting Xu Yueping's shoulder, seemingly very satisfied this time. Qin Ming also stood by the fire spring, thinking that although Feng Yi'an was smiling, there was no goodwill in it.

Xu Yueping's face was expressionless. Remembering the humiliation in Silvervine Town, he felt a stinging pain on his face and in his heart.

Shao Chengfeng chuckled, "Last time, I misjudged you. I didn't expect little brother Qin to be a Rebirther who laid a golden foundation. When the mountain clearing operation begins, we'll most likely be fighting side by side. How about you join our Patrol Team directly and become one of us early?" Qin Ming immediately declined. Even as the other party's smile gradually faded, he pretended not to notice.

Soon after, the Patrol Team members departed. "No need to test him, we already know that kid is hostile towards us. Find a chance to eliminate him once the mountain clearing begins!"

"Don't waste him! The fire spring in the Blood Bamboo Forest is about to go out. We can use him to scout the way." The few individuals chatted casually as they disappeared into the wilderness.

That day, Qin Ming diligently sharpened his wood-cutting knife in the courtyard.
