# Chapter 65: Worshiping Heaven and Earth Is Not as Good as Worshiping Oneself

What surprised him even more was that the world before his eyes seemed to have become more vivid and bright than ever before.

It was as if a mask had been removed, restoring colors to their hundred percent purity.

Xu Yunfan subconsciously pressed his fingers to his temples, and the skin beneath his fingertips was actually trembling slightly.

In front of the ancient Buddhist hall, the drifting trajectory of moss spores on the steps, the frequency of earthworms rolling and rubbing their bodies below, and the hairline cracks inside the bronze bells at the eaves' corners.

These details, which originally required focused concentration to capture, were now pouring into his consciousness like a torrential rain.

At that moment, countless cultivation memories suddenly manifested in his mind.

He saw himself building a thatched hut on a mountaintop for ten years, standing on a cliff every day at the Yin hour (3-5 AM) to watch the sea of clouds surge, hoping to comprehend how the universe reflects the heart and seeking spiritual sublimation and transformation.

Whether it was the scorching sun peeling his skin or the deep winter frost and snow forming an armor of ice on his eyebrows, Xu Yunfan always maintained the hand seal of the Lin character. Until one day, when the morning sun pierced through the clouds and the dawn glow dyed the sea of clouds a golden yellow, a sudden realization arose in his heart.

Immediately after, he slowly rose, shook off the thick dust from his tattered clothes, and walked down the mountain step by step.

The memory fragments suddenly switched to a snowy, icy summit.

He walked barefoot, shattering thousand-year-old profound ice, leaving behind a bloody lotus-like imprint with every step.

In the layer of fierce winds at an altitude of three thousand zhang (approx. 10 km), he actually untied his fur robe to face the cold winds of heaven and earth, allowing ice crystals to cut his skin, all to comprehend the true meaning within the Lin character technique: "Body and mind like a newborn, clear and bright inside and out."

The final scene froze at the moment he climbed to the legendary Cloud-Top Heavenly Palace.

The Lin character technique, cultivated for decades, finally broke the shackles in his heart. When his inner and outer worlds were connected, he finally saw the先天 (Primordial) deity seated within the Heavenly Palace.

This deity was surrounded by surging immortal light and mist, his form indistinct and unstable. As Xu Yunfan's spiritual energy gradually dried up, the deity finally moved, taking steps and walking down from the divine platform.

The surrounding mist and immortal light seemed like a long rainbow breaking through dawn, exploding within the divine palace.

Xu Yunfan clearly saw the face of this deity—it was none other than his own.

In reality, Xu Yunfan's pupils trembled slightly, and a realization arose in his heart.

Worshiping Heaven and Earth is not as good as worshiping oneself with true sincerity.

The existences that used to make him feel pressure had now vanished without a trace, replaced by an unprecedented tranquility and serenity.

The sound of the wind, birds chirping, and the rustling of leaves all entered his ears with extreme clarity.

He could feel the touch of the breeze brushing against his skin and even distinguish the subtle differences in the various scents in the air.

His emotions were like a well of water, without a single ripple, devoid of any fluctuation.

His calmness reached the extreme, as if he had no emotions. His entire body was perfectly under his control, and not a single ounce of strength was wasted in his movements.

The power of his entire body was thoroughly mastered at this moment.

He carefully sensed it; this state, similar to hyper-sensitivity, was draining his spiritual energy every second and was difficult to sustain.

Once his spiritual energy dried up, if he continued to maintain it, there was a high probability that his soul would collapse.

He could last at most three breaths.

Watching the golden stream of light shooting over from the horizon, the old monk's expression was agitated, no longer the decrepit look from just moments ago. He stood tall and bowed.

"Lord Bodhisattva of Power Awareness, the Spiritual Awareness has arrived!"

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. The tip of his foot shattered the green stone bricks beneath him, and his entire figure shot backward, instantly disappearing into the nearby forest. He climbed up an old pine tree and fell silent.

When the golden stream of light flew down, Xu Yunfan finally saw it clearly—it was a pair of clubs!

The gold-gilded clubs, shrouded in golden flowing fire, crashed down with a roar, landing heavily in the temple's courtyard.

*Boom!*

The moment the bricks and stones shattered, the bronze bells atop the ancient pagoda simultaneously exploded into dust.

In the forest nearby, Xu Yunfan, having withdrawn from the Lin character seal state, was shocked. He stared at the large pit smashed out in the courtyard by the gold-gilded clubs.

The earth and stones in the courtyard rolled over like waves, revealing the densely packed, grim white bones below.

The bones were embedded in the soil, as if countless empty eye sockets were staring fixedly at the sky. The number was so great it made one's blood run cold. The entire courtyard seemed to have become a massive graveyard.

With such a quantity, this vast courtyard must hold tens of thousands.

A blood sacrifice technique!

Xu Yunfan stared intently at the gold-gilded clubs in the pit, which were still emitting a faint golden light, and a look of understanding flashed in his eyes.

Xu Yunfan's heart chilled. He had heard Lu Yi mention earlier that spiritual weapons have spirits, indifferent to good or evil, and particularly enjoy consuming human Qi. If the killing intent is not removed in time, once the killing becomes too much, a spiritual weapon will turn into a vicious weapon.

This pair of gold-gilded clubs was said to be the protective spiritual weapon of a general from the previous dynasty. Now that it has been drawn out, it must be related to the human burials under this Bodhisattva of Power Awareness.

However, does this Bodhisattva of Power Awareness really possess intelligence?

It is likely that the earth dragon's upheaval deep in the accumulation cloud mountain was also the work of this Bodhisattva of Power Awareness.

In the courtyard, the old monk staggered to his feet, dusted off the dirt on his body, walked to the cushion under the Buddhist hall's altar, knelt down, and shouted loudly.

"Welcome, Bodhisattva, take your seat! Welcome, Bodhisattva, take your seat!"

As soon as he finished speaking, the Bodhisattva statue on the divine platform suddenly cracked with countless fine fissures. Black mist surged out from the cracks, rolling and filling the entire Buddhist hall.

The old monk was swallowed by the mist, but instead of showing any fear, his expression became even more fanatical.

He raised his hands high, his voice like a beast's roar: "Please, Bodhisattva, descend upon me and grant me immortality!"

For a moment, the black mist in the Buddhist hall seemed to smell blood and began to frantically钻入 (drill into) the old monk's body.

At this time, five shadows shot out from different directions.

At the eastern eaves corner, a martial artist built like an iron tower but with the agility of an old ape. His hands hung down, actually passing his knees, and his toes were more than twice as long as a normal person's, flexible as if they were hands.

This man was nearly three meters tall, his arm muscles twisted and bulging. The玄铁 (profound iron) vambraces on his arms reflected a strange patterned luster under the moonlight. He was striding forward, and wherever he went, high walls were as easily shattered as if made of paper. He then stepped into the courtyard.

From the direction of the west wall, a red-haired man vaulted over.

With every step he took, the green bricks beneath his feet exploded like thin ice in spring.

As he moved, his red hair danced wildly like burning flames, and his body hair seemed like tiny flames gently floating on his body, emanating a scorching aura.

Another emerged from the shadow of a broken pillar, his form like ink, vanishing if one wasn't careful. A chain blade in his sleeve flickered like a snake's tongue as he swung his hands.

Looking up, a one-armed swordsman had unknowingly stood atop the roof.

On the north wall, a woman holding a jade flute and wearing a silver palace dress landed lightly on the wall as if walking on the wind. She frowned slightly and let out a cold snort.

"Heretical demon, thinking you can achieve immortality by worshiping a wild god. I say you are courting death."

The ape-like martial artist had a cold expression and said coldly, "Hmph, this spiritual weapon belongs to me today!"

With that, he immediately strode toward the large pit, wanting to be the first to rush in and seize the spiritual weapon.
