# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 117: Theft of the Pills  

Though he felt troubled, Jin Tao was even more reluctant to offend Lin Xuan.  

After hesitating for a moment, he gritted his teeth and said, "Very well, Senior Brother Lin. If you could just leave some proof that you took these defective pills, so I can account for them..."  

"No problem."  

Seeing Lin Xuan agree, Jin Tao sighed in relief and quickly brought over a jade slip. Lin Xuan left his spiritual imprint inside using his divine sense.  

Then, Jin Tao personally led the way, taking Lin Xuan to a room on the second floor. Using his identity token to dispel the restrictions, he opened the door and gestured, "After you."  

"Senior Brother Jin, I can go in alone from here."  

"Alright!" Jin Tao hesitated for a moment before agreeing to Lin Xuan's request. After all, the other party was a Foundation Establishment cultivator. These defective pills would be useless to him, so he certainly wouldn't take too many.  

Lin Xuan entered the room alone.  

Rather than calling it a single room, it was more accurate to describe it as a large hall—spanning several hundred square meters, with rows upon rows of neatly arranged shelves.  

On the shelves were white bottles, one after another. Lin Xuan picked one up and opened it.  

It was filled with defective pills.  

There were two types of defective pills: Foundation Establishment Pills and Essence Consolidation Pills.  

Lin Xuan roughly estimated that there were hundreds of thousands of each type—accumulated over a thousand years by the Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

Standing in this treasure trove, Lin Xuan found himself in a dilemma.  

If he had followed his initial plan, upon arriving here, he would have swept away all the defective pills and fled.  

After all, his original purpose in joining Spirit Medicine Mountain had been to scheme for these very pills.  

But now, Lin Xuan was unwilling to do so.  

There were several reasons.  

First, while Lin Xuan was no saint, he wasn't a villain either. Repaying kindness with betrayal was something he couldn't bring himself to do. Elder Tongyu had treated him well, and scheming against him would weigh on his conscience.  

Second, after half a year in Spirit Medicine Mountain, Lin Xuan had come to realize that the sect was actually quite good. As the saying goes, "A big tree provides good shade." For someone like him, who was solely focused on cultivation, having the protection of a sect was far safer than being a rogue cultivator.  

Here, he could cultivate without distractions.  

At least until he reached the Core Formation stage, Lin Xuan had no intention of leaving Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

Yet, no matter what, he was determined to obtain the pills.  

Fortunately, Lin Xuan had already devised a suitable plan. Though not foolproof, it should allow him to successfully acquire enough defective pills.  

"Yue'er, come out!"  

"Young Master!"  

A streak of white light flew out from Lin Xuan's sleeve, materializing into a faint shadow. The shadow gradually grew clearer until it transformed into a beautiful young woman with bright eyes and pearly teeth.  

However, upon closer inspection, one would notice that this lovely girl cast no shadow.  

She was not human but a ghost cultivator with some cultivation.  

Her name was Lin Yue'er, the ghost cultivator who had signed a master-servant contract with Lin Xuan.  

Compared to half a year ago, Lin Yue'er's form had stabilized significantly. Ever since learning that ghosts could also attain immortality, she had trained diligently. Coupled with her innate talent, her current cultivation was equivalent to that of a mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator.  

The stronger the ghost cultivator bound to him, the more help they could provide. Unless necessary, Lin Xuan didn't want to disturb her cultivation. But now, to acquire the defective pills, he needed someone to act out a play with him.  

Lin Xuan explained his plan to the little ghost, and Lin Yue'er naturally agreed without hesitation.  

Lin Xuan took out his storage bracelet and tossed it forward, then cast a spell on it. The bracelet began to spin rapidly, and moments later, a beam of white light shot out.  

The white light swept across the rows of shelves, collecting all the jade bottles containing the defective pills.  

In no time, all the defective pills in the room had been stored in the bracelet, leaving only a few bottles in the corner.  

Lin Xuan carefully put those away, then hesitated for a moment before waving his hands and casting a series of spells toward the room.  

Something miraculous happened—the previously empty shelves were now filled with bottles again, identical to the ones that had held the defective pills.  

Soon, the entire room was restored to its original state!  

This illusion technique was a high-level spell, extremely difficult to master. Lin Xuan had spent considerable effort to learn it—specifically for today's operation.  

Of course, if he simply left now, while he might deceive Jin Tao temporarily, once the illusion wore off and an investigation was conducted, he would still be the prime suspect.  

Lin Xuan didn't want that, so he needed a permanent solution to the problem.  

"Yue'er, ready?"  

"Mm."  

The little ghost nodded. Lin Xuan cast the illusion spell again, this time targeting Lin Yue'er.  

Under the spell's effect, the sweet and lovely Lin Yue'er transformed into a terrifying ghost with claw-like fingers and disheveled hair.  

Moreover, the ghostly aura she emitted was powerful enough to rival a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

After Lin Xuan entered the pill room, Jin Tao waited outside the door.  

Excitement flickered in his eyes from time to time. Though Spirit Medicine Mountain placed less emphasis on cultivation strength compared to other sects, its hierarchy was just as rigid.  

Here, one's status was determined by alchemy skills.  

Jin Tao was only a mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator with no particular talent for alchemy. He had only managed to join Spirit Medicine Mountain by chance and was eventually assigned to manage the defective pills.  

He had no future.  

If things continued this way, he would never reach Foundation Establishment, and even living comfortably would remain a distant dream.  

But today, Lin Xuan had come to the defective pill room. He was Elder Tongyu's disciple and the designated successor to the sect leader—undoubtedly one of the most influential figures in the sect.  

Originally, according to the rules, Jin Tao shouldn't have let Lin Xuan into the pill room so easily. It was a violation of sect regulations.  

But so what? Jin Tao was determined to curry favor with Spirit Medicine Mountain's future leader. With Lin Xuan's support, his status within the sect would rise significantly.  

Unlike other sects, Spirit Medicine Mountain had an abundance of pills. Though his alchemy skills were mediocre, his spiritual roots weren't terrible. If he could obtain more pills each month, he might still have a chance at Foundation Establishment.  

With Lin Xuan's status, as long as he was willing to put in a good word for him, this was entirely possible!  

Lost in his beautiful fantasy, Jin Tao couldn't help but smile...  

**Boom!**  

A sudden explosion from behind shattered his daydream. Startled, Jin Tao turned around, only to hear a series of explosions and Lin Xuan's furious shouts.  

"What happened?"  

Without thinking, Jin Tao rushed into the pill room. What he saw turned his face pale with fright.  

Inside the room, a hideous, disheveled female ghost was brandishing a black banner, surrounded by eerie winds and thick ghostly mist.  

Countless spirits poured out from the demonic banner, intertwining to form a blood-red skull several meters tall.  

Lin Xuan, his expression grave, was manipulating a flying sword with hand seals, locked in fierce combat with the skull.  

The female ghost exuded terrifying pressure, her ghostly aura no weaker than that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Despite Lin Xuan's best efforts, he was gradually being overpowered.  

How could such a terrifying ghost appear in the defective pill room? Jin Tao was baffled. Watching Lin Xuan and the ghost battle, their flashes of light dazzling, he knew his own cultivation was far too weak to intervene.  

Just as he was at a loss for what to do, the female ghost noticed him. With a flick of her banner, ghostly mist surged forth, condensing into a black spear.  

"Go!"  

The spear shot toward him like lightning.  

Jin Tao froze in terror, forgetting to dodge or even activate his defensive barrier. Just as the spear was about to pierce him, a loud shout rang out:  

"Senior Brother, move!"  

He felt himself shoved aside by an invisible force, barely avoiding the spear as it whizzed past him, leaving him drenched in cold sweat.  

"Are you alright?"  

"Th-thank you, Senior Brother, for saving me!"  

Jin Tao looked at Lin Xuan with gratitude, but the latter's expression suddenly changed. "Not good!"  

"What?"  

Following Lin Xuan's gaze, Jin Tao saw the vicious female ghost transform into a black cloud, swirling through the room and snatching all the defective pills from the shelves before darting toward the exit.  

"She stole the pills!"  

Lin Xuan shouted and gave chase, but the ghost turned her head and spat a cloud of poisonous mist. Lin Xuan, caught in the blast, staggered, clutching his head.  

"Senior Brother, are you okay?"  

Jin Tao supported Lin Xuan but made no move to pursue. The ghost was equivalent to a Foundation Establishment cultivator—he wasn't suicidal.  

Lin Xuan's face was ashen, his expression grave. He remained silent, seemingly focusing on expelling the poison. After a while, his complexion improved, and he stepped outside with Jin Tao to look around.  

The ghost was long gone, having vanished without a trace.
