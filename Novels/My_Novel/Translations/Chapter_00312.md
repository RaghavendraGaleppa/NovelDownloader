Chapter 312: The Hero in the Snow

Inside the Dream Recalling Inn, the prodigies watched Wang Dezhong with serious expressions. Though they harbored pride in their hearts and found the tale of "terrifying archery" hard to believe, his dejected demeanor seemed genuine, sparking intense curiosity.

In the inn's main hall, three pots of beast stew were boiling and steaming. The精华 (essence) pot bubbled with tiger and bear hearts, their textures distinct, while bear paws and leopard spines cooked to half perfection. The aroma was intoxicating.

Yang Wentian took out dozens of bowls and chopsticks. He sprinkled some seasoning beside the Korean soup, then arranged the bowls neatly on the ground. With a palm strike from a distance, he hit the beast pot. The pot trembled, splashing beast soup like rain, falling perfectly into each bowl without a single drop missing.

Amidst a chorus of praise, everyone took a bowl of soup, slurping it down as they sat around the pot in a lively circle. Zhou Ting of the Yangshan Sword Sect shouted, "Innkeeper, bring water and wine!"

The innkeeper's apprentice carried in wine jars and fresh water. The water was poured into the pot, while the wine jars were placed to the side for the prodigies to take as they pleased. Everyone sat down, drinking soup, wine, and eating meat, quietly waiting for Wang Dezhong to speak.

Gu Nianjun took a small sip and said, "Brother Wang, please proceed."

Wang Dezhong called for a jar of wine, took a few deep gulps, and slowly began. "Today's hunt... I actually used a trick. I possess the [Azure Eyes Physique], my eyes are unique. My ability to track and find traces is far stronger than that of ordinary people."

"I saw that the winter hunt was crowded, with many fellow disciples from the same sword sect. While catching ordinary beasts is respectable, bagging a Snow Beast would greatly boost one's reputation and showcase one's archery."

Everyone chuckled upon hearing this. Yang Wentian said, "To be honest, I also wanted to hunt a Snow Beast. But these beasts are incredibly cunning; I didn't even catch a glimpse of one."

Many echoed with laughter. Gu Nianjun asked, "And then?" Wang Dezhong said, "I got lucky and found a Snow Tiger. I wounded it with an arrow, but it managed to escape."

Zhou Shijie said, "Snow Beasts have formidable vitality. If you don't kill it with one arrow, it's highly likely to flee. Such a setback shouldn't make you so dejected as to retire your bow, should it?"

Wang Dezhong said, "With my Azure Eyes, though I lost sight of it for a moment, I gradually picked up its trail again through subtle signs. I tracked it down, and by then, I was confident I could kill a Snow Tiger!"

Wang Dezhong took a drink of wine and said, "That's when it happened."

Everyone leaned in, their curiosity piqued by his dramatic tone. Gu Nianjun frowned slightly and urged, "Brother Wang, just tell us."

Wang Dezhong said, "I crept up quietly, less than three hundred zhang from the Snow Tiger. I nocked an arrow and let it fly. But just then, another arrow flew in from somewhere and shot mine down!"

Luo Feiyan exclaimed, "Brother Wang, your arrow was already in flight, yet it was shot down?"

Wang Dezhong nodded. The prodigies gasped in astonishment. For an arrow to intercept another in mid-flight, especially one flying at such speed and force, was incredibly difficult.

Wang Dezhong said, "That wasn't all. I looked back and saw the archer... he was two li away... no, I thought he was two li away. In reality, it was much farther. The snowy mountains were vast and white, making his red bow stand out, which made him seem much closer."

"It's like the saying, 'The mountains look close, but a horse will die trying to reach them.' When I actually walked over, the distance was at least five li... no, eight li! Or even more? I couldn't be sure, the snow was endless."

Mu Hongchou said, "Wait, you're saying he shot your arrow down from eight li away? That's absurd. Unless he used internal energy or martial arts, it's impossible."

Wang Dezhong shook his head. "I'm certain it was pure archery."

Hua Wu nodded. "Unless... you were shooting at each other, with your arrows flying in opposite directions."

Wang Dezhong shook his head again. "No, I said I was looking back. The man was directly behind me. It wasn't a head-on exchange."

Yue Kai pondered, "I think I understand. It must have been a coincidence. The other man shot first, you shot later. The timing and direction were just right, so the arrows collided."

Gu Nianjun and Mu Hongchou both secretly nodded, finding this plausible. Mu Hongchou said, "So, in reality, it was your arrow that shot down his. But due to the complex situation, you thought he shot yours down."

Wang Dezhong said, "At the time, I was competitive and also thought it was a huge coincidence. So I nocked another arrow. This second arrow left me with no illusions."

Everyone pricked up their ears. Wang Dezhong said gravely, "If the first was a coincidence, the second was impossible. I saw with my own eyes my arrow being shot down again. And his arrow arrived after mine; I shot first, he shot later."

Yang Wentian was deeply skeptical. "Brother Wang, could you have been under a spell? How could such a thing happen?"

Mu Hongchou said, "An arrow shot later hitting one shot first is too unbelievable. Besides... you were eight li apart. With my archery, I wouldn't dare claim to hit a target perfectly from eight li. Hitting a flying arrow from eight li? I've never even heard of it!"

Gu Nianjun remained silent, her eyes flashing. Wang Dezhong gave a bitter smile. "Why would I lie to you? This is the absolute truth."

"The man held up a finger, meaning he would let me shoot one more time. I poured all my life's learning and skill into that third arrow."

Luo Feiyan said, "Was it shot down again?" The entire room fell silent, a pin drop could be heard, all waiting for Wang Dezhong's response.

Wang Dezhong nodded. "Yes, without a doubt, it was shot down again. But this time, I watched him draw his bow and shoot. His posture, his demeanor... I... I have no words to describe it. I could only prostrate myself in complete submission."

"After that arrow, I had no more thought of competing with him. I watched him draw his bow again and, from several li away, shoot the Snow Tiger lying in the snow dead. His presence was... truly humbling."

He finished by taking another drink of wine. Zhou Shijie and Yue Kai looked thoughtful. Mu Hongchou and Gu Nianjun exchanged glances, both feeling a strange sense of intrigue, their hearts itching like a cat was scratching them. They were just about to speak.

Hua Wu said, "I still think Brother Wang must have been delirious. It's just too unbelievable."

Someone in the crowd doubted, "Yeah, maybe Brother Wang's eyesight is good, but his archery is just average. Feeling his hunt was inadequate, he made up a god-like figure to excuse himself?"

Wang Dezhong flared up. "Compared to that man, my archery is indeed average. But compared to you lot, I'm probably still a cut above."

Mu Hongchou said, "True or false, a test will tell. Brother Wang, everyone, please come outside."

The crowd poured out. The sky was dark, the wind and snow were relentless, and it was bitterly cold. Mu Hongchou said to a junior sister, "Good sister, please set up a target two li away."

The junior sister used her light footwork and returned quickly. Mu Hongchou said, "Brother Wang, please shoot." To prove his innocence, Wang Dezhong took up his bow again. The moment he gripped it, the image of that figure filled his mind. Suppressing his feelings of inferiority and self-loathing, he drew the bow to its full extent and loosed the arrow.

It hit the target perfectly. Wang Dezhong said, "At the time, the Snow Tiger was three hundred zhang from me. My first arrow was like this, my second like this, my third like this." He recreated the trajectories of his three shots one by one.

By the time he shot the second arrow, the scornful looks from the onlooking prodigies had completely vanished. The third arrow, like a serpent turning, was agile and precise, fully displaying his profound skill in the Way of the Archery. The prodigies applauded and praised him, but Wang Dezhong immediately put away his bow, sighing deeply.

Yang Wentian exclaimed in shock, "Even with Brother Wang's archery, he suffered such a defeat? What kind of person is that?"

Hua Wu of the Lishan Sword Sect said, "If it's true, my god... just what level has that person's archery reached? I've met many prodigies, but I've never heard of anyone with such archery."

Zhou Ting of the Yangshan Sword Sect said, "Could it be an old monster?"

Wang Dezhong said, "If it were an old monster, why would I be so heartbroken? I don't think so."

Mu Hongchou asked curiously, "Brother Wang, please shoot again. Let me see if I can shoot your arrow down."

Wang Dezhong said, "Alright." With bows and arrows ready, Mu Hongchou stood beside him, and the two took their stances. Wang Dezhong shot first, and Mu Hongchou immediately nocked and shot after him.

The two arrows were almost simultaneous, but Mu Hongchou's still couldn't catch up. In the end, they hit the target one after the other. Mu Hongchou frowned. "Again!"

Wang Dezhong shot another arrow. Mu Hongchou adjusted her posture slightly and shot right after. This time, her arrow caught up from behind, touching Wang Dezhong's arrow and knocking it off course.

Mu Hongchou's eyebrows flew up, looking quite pleased. Wang Dezhong asked curiously, "Sister Mu, how did you do that?"

Mu Hongchou didn't answer, but said, "Brother Wang, please use your second and third arrow stances."

Wang Dezhong nodded. He shot the second and third arrows one after another. This time, Mu Hongchou gave it her all but couldn't catch up. Her archery was indeed a fraction superior to Wang Dezhong's. They tested nineteen arrows in total, and only one was shot down. All the others failed.

Yang Wentian said, "Let me try! My Thunder Sound Bow might be able to do it." He volunteered, standing beside Wang Dezhong.

Wang Dezhong shot again, repeatedly displaying his three stances. Yang Wentian's arrows shot like thunder, with immense power, but lacked precision. After more than ten attempts, he only nearly succeeded once.

The prodigies all tried a few times and felt it was impossible. They were filled with awe, knowing Wang Dezhong's archery was extraordinary and his words were not false. They also felt the difficulty. An inexplicable sense of pressure and gloom settled over their hearts, making them feel terrible. They gradually understood Wang Dezhong's feelings.

Wang Dezhong said, "Everyone, there's no need to try further. Sister Mu, how did you manage that one arrow?" Mu Hongchou said, "I used the wind to increase my arrow's speed!"

Yang Wentian said, "In that case, that person must have used the wind as well." Everyone felt secretly relieved.

Wang Dezhong gave a bitter smile. "Hard, hard, hard!" He continued, "Have you all forgotten, we were standing in the same spot? Using the wind, you could catch up by a hair's breadth. But what about a difference of several li?"

The crowd was shocked, uttering sounds like "Ah," "Eh," "Huh." No one had an appetite for food anymore, their hearts shrouded in darkness. Mu Hongchou and the others woke from their dream, suddenly realizing the vast difference, feeling an indescribable sense of defeat.

Wang Dezhong said, "Everyone, don't forget how far we were from the target."

Lan Yingying, a junior sister from the Hushan Sword Sect, said, "It was two li." Wang Dezhong said, "When Sister Mu shot my arrow down, how far was it from the target?"

Mu Hongchou said, "When the two arrows collided, it was less than ten zhang from the target."

Wang Dezhong said, "Sister Mu used the wind, and her arrow chased for over a li just to catch mine. In terms of archery, Sister Mu is superior to me. But everyone, don't forget, when I was hunting the Snow Tiger, I was only three hundred zhang away..."

"The time from me releasing the string to it hitting the target was instantaneous. There was no leeway for an arrow to catch up. The difference, you can all imagine."

Everyone gasped in unison, their eyes wide, shouting "Ah!" in shock. Luo Feiyan stammered, "Th-this..."

Wang Dezhong said, "The more I think about it, the more terrified I become. To be honest with you all, when I returned to the inn, I was drenched in three sets of clothes with cold sweat. The moment that man shot, I truly felt the wind stop, the snow cease, and everything go silent. If he wanted to shoot me... I... would not have survived either."

The prodigies stood dumbfounded outside the door, the wind and snow whipping at them, yet they remained unable to come to their senses.

Gu Nianjun's thoughts drifted, her beautiful eyes shimmering with a strange light. "Purely with archery, it is indeed possible."

Wang Dezhong said, "Oh?" Gu Nianjun said, "Archery... even the纨绔子弟 (playboy sons) of noble families will learn a thing or two. The basics can be practiced, but the further you go, the more you hit a bottleneck. Progress becomes impossible, and it all depends on talent and flair. If someone has supreme talent in archery, they can perfect it."

"They can infuse their arrows with their own unique spirit. Their arrows become faster, their momentum fiercer. Perhaps they could achieve such a feat. But those who can do so are as rare as a phoenix's feather or a unicorn's horn! If such a person truly exists, their demeanor..."

She did not finish. She inexplicably thought of the figure of Li Xian at the Tower Banquet. But she imagined that even Li Xian would be far inferior to this person.

Gu Nianjun thought to herself, "Though I have not met this hero, his heroic presence is as if before my eyes. Heaven have mercy, I pray for a chance to meet him. Otherwise, this trip to Feilong City would be a great regret."

Zhou Shijie pondered, "Brother Wang's story reminds me of a strange incident as well." Everyone gathered around.

Zhou Shijie continued, "Today, Brother Yue and I wanted to hunt a Snow Ape. We followed its tracks and finally found it. It's laughable to say, but even with the two of us shooting together, we couldn't capture the Snow Ape, and it escaped far away."

"But just then, an arrow flew in from who knows where. It shot the Snow Ape dead in one shot, and a strange man picked up the ape. When Brother Yue and I saw him, we wanted to invite him to talk and chased after him. But this man's footwork was bizarre, he swayed left and right, and then vanished without a trace. We couldn't even speak to him!"

"Ah!" Mu Hongchou exclaimed in shock. "Sister Gu, in that case, that person is probably him!"

Gu Nianjun's heart pounded. "Yes."

Wang Dezhong said, "Sister Mu, I've heard you had a strange encounter as well, could it also be..." Mu Hongchou said, "Yes. Sister Gu and I were on our way back when we came across Snow Bear footprints. We followed the trail."

"We found a man driving a Snow Bear along the way, and then shot it dead with one arrow. That Snow Bear was very difficult to deal with, but in his hands, it was like a plaything. What a pity..."

Gu Nianjun sighed, "What a pity, by the time we discovered his tracks, he had already gone far. We couldn't see him, couldn't see what he looked like."

Wang Dezhong said, "In that case, it's almost certainly him. I thought he might be a fellow traveler. But now it seems, this person is not among us."

Gu Nianjun suddenly asked, "Shijie, you were closest to that person. What is his appearance? Is he handsome? What is his demeanor?" As she spoke, she suddenly felt strange looks from around her, her pretty face flushed, and she immediately restrained herself.

Zhou Shijie felt a twinge of jealousy and said truthfully, "Nianjun, you'll be disappointed. That man wore a white mask and held a red bow. We couldn't see his face."

Yue Kai said, "Though we didn't see his true face, this man is tall and straight, with long hair flowing. His posture... is indeed exceptional."

Having poured out his frustrations, Wang Dezhong felt even more profound admiration for Li Xian. "From afar, I could feel his extraordinary temperament. It's hard to describe. Sister Mu, Miss Gu... if you are choosing a husband, don't miss out on this one."

Gu Nianjun and Mu Hongchou both blushed. Mu Hongchou scolded, "Nonsense." Gu Nianjun, however, observed Mu Hongchou's expression and thought, "Though this hero's face is not shown, for him to earn such admiration from Wang Dezhong and the others, he must be incredibly formidable. If fate allows it, Sister Mu, I won't let you have him."

Wang Dezhong extremely praised Li Xian and added, "There is one thing, perhaps worth mentioning. If I am not mistaken, this hero likely possesses a special eye ability, just like me."

Zhou Shijie's heart soured. In the provincial city, he held the title "The Civil and Martial Exiled Prince," his reputation unparalleled among his peers. He sought to be first in both martial and literary arts. On this outing, he met many fellow prodigies. Though he still commanded great presence and respect, he knew his own martial path was slightly weaker, relying entirely on "luck" to maintain his leading position. Now hearing of prodigies emerging one after another, he felt his own weakness more acutely. Today, hearing of such a peerless archery genius, of the same age as himself, he felt completely outclassed. Hearing the man possessed special eyes only deepened his sense of inferiority.

He saw Gu Nianjun remained calm and composed, but the admiration in her eyes was already intense. He asked, "How did you deduce that, Brother Wang?"

Wang Dezhong said, "Snow Beasts are incredibly difficult to track. This man shot one dead from several li away. His eyesight is even superior to mine, so I推测 (speculate) he may possess special eyes."

Gu Nianjun suddenly recalled that morning, when she was riding and locked eyes with a man for a moment. Those eyes were clear and profound, quite captivating. She had been dazed and only came to her senses after riding some distance. She hadn't even noticed he wore a mask or carried a red bow.

Remembering this, she brightened and said, "Ah... I've actually seen this person."

Mu Hongchou said, "Sister Gu, you've seen him?"

Gu Nianjun said, "While riding today, I happened to catch a glimpse of him. I saw him heading towards the western range of Snow Dragon Mountain." Mu Hongchou secretly noted this.

Gu Nianjun thought to herself, "Sister Mu, we are just acquaintances, please don't blame me for deceiving you." She knew the western range was remote with fewer beasts. If this hero was here for the Snow Fox, he wouldn't go there. By deliberately saying he went west, Mu Hongchou would surely search the west. Meanwhile, she would go to the eastern and northern ranges, where there were more beasts. The chance of a meeting would naturally be greater.

Mu Hongchou, unaware of this, secretly observed Gu Nianjun's face. Seeing her calm expression, she thought, "Sister Gu is indeed from the Gu family, it seems she has no interest in him. With such incredible archery, I must meet him."

After this incident, the prodigies had no more interest in gathering. They rode back to their respective residences and parted ways. Hua Wu of the Lishan Sword Sect, Wang Dezhong of the Jiushan Sword Sect, Mu Hongchou of the Hushan Sword Sect, Zhou Ting of the Yangshan Sword Sect, Yue Kai of the Yueshan Sword Sect, and the others returned to their sect courtyards and reported the matter to their elders.

For a time, the five great sword sects kept their lights on all night, repeatedly inquiring about the details. They were astonished that there was such a young hero in the world, whose archery at such a young age was so terrifying? Rumors began to spread among the five sects.

On another side, Zhou Shijie and Gu Nianjun traveled together. He observed the details of Gu Nianjun's expression, seeing her calm and graceful, with a scholarly air, as if nothing had happened. He felt slightly relieved, knowing Gu Nianjun was one who remained unmoved by favor or disgrace, so perhaps the matter was already over.

Zhou Shijie said, "Nianjun, we've already seen Little Fan on this trip, shouldn't we leave?"

Gu Nianjun said, "Oh? Shijie, didn't you say that难得 (it's rare) to witness the grand alliance of the five sword sects, and you wanted to see it firsthand, wishing to stay a few more days? Why are you suddenly saying we should return?" She thought to herself, "Besides, you are going to the Zhou family, and I am returning to the Gu family. Even if we leave, we are not on the same path." Out of consideration for their schoolmate friendship, she didn't say it aloud.

Zhou Shijie said, "The grand event of the sword sects is indeed rare to hear. But..." He couldn't find a reason.

The truth was, when Zhou Shijie was in his element, commanding the winds and rain, he was naturally willing to stay longer. But today's hunting event, where everyone displayed their prowess, their catches were all more abundant than his, made him feel inadequate. Furthermore, when everyone spoke of the mysterious "White Mask, Red Bow," they completely ignored him.

He knew that if he stayed longer, his weaker martial path would surely cause him to be sidelined. He was even more afraid that with so many prodigies gathered, the longer he stayed, the more he would seem like an average person. Thus, he wanted to leave early.

Gu Nianjun smiled. "Shijie, it's a rare event. If you have urgent matters, feel free to leave first. I will stay a while longer." Her thoughts drifted elsewhere.

Back at the Jade Bamboo Residence, she suddenly saw Mayor He, who considered himself a student, sitting beside Li Xiaofan, listening to Fu Haoran's teachings and reading poetry aloud. Gu Nianjun suddenly thought, "Such a hero is truly hard to find. If I do meet him, I need to prepare in advance. If I could get a map of Snow Dragon Mountain, I would surely have something to talk to him about..." Her face brightened, and she hurried towards Mayor He.

Meanwhile, Li Xian saw the Snow Bear was far away and carrying it would be troublesome, so he drove it along the way with his arrows. He had few arrows, so after shooting one, he would go back and retrieve it. This allowed him to guide the Snow Bear to his destination before killing it with a final arrow.

Snow Bears, Snow Tigers, Snow Apes... three Snow Beasts lay dead in the snow. Li Xian thought, "Carrying three Snow Beasts back like this would be too strange." He looked around and saw an abundance of wood.

He took out his dagger and executed the "Great Luo Saber Technique." He cut down trees to make a raft, threw the three Snow Beasts onto it, and dragged it back. Li Xian didn't want to cause trouble, so he took a secluded path, avoiding the crowds of prodigies like Zhou Shijie, Gu Nianjun, and Wang Dezhong.

Li Xian felt very hungry. After leaving the Snow Dragon Mountain range, he discarded the bear skin, took a piece of bear belly, ape arm, and tiger spine meat, wrapped them in oil paper. This would be his dinner. He dragged the three Snow Beasts to the outskirts of the city.

He didn't rush into the city. First, he wandered through the dense forest outside the city and saw a small hut in the woods. This was a "hunter's hut." Hunters who went into the mountains to hunt, sometimes facing long journeys and finding it troublesome to enter and exit the city gates, and since hunting was not a one-day affair, would build simple wooden huts to avoid wind and snow and save on travel time.

Li Xian saw a hunter's hut was occupied, so he knocked on the door. A middle-aged hunter came out. Li Xian spoke with him, wanting to use his hand to connect with a "noble family" and sell the Snow Beasts to them.

The hunter was extremely excited upon seeing the Snow Beasts. In Snow City, these were hot commodities. Once a supply appeared, they would be snapped up. The hunter acted as a middleman and contacted the steward of the Duan family in Feilong City.

For forty taels of silver, the three Snow Beasts were bought out. In reality, one Snow Beast should have cost "one hundred and thirty taels." But the steward was shrewd, seeing Li Xian was in a hurry to sell, so he drove a hard bargain.

Li Xian didn't want to haggle over a few taels of profit. Getting the money in hand, he felt very pleased. He entered the city safely and returned to the inn to rest properly.

He was completely unaware that the rumor of the "White Mask, Red Bow" was quietly spreading. And naturally, it reached the ears of a certain Madam.

(P.S.: Some readers say the plot is a bit slow. It is indeed a little slow. Recently, many characters have appeared. I admit my writing skill is insufficient, and I'm afraid of making mistakes, so I can only slow down the complex parts and explain them slowly. But the plot is advancing steadily every day, and the style has always been like this.

Moreover...

I've seen many author friends take leave to play during the National Day. I'm still painfully typing, not missing a single day... So I'm asking for monthly tickets and continued reading!)
