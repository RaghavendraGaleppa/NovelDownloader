# Chapter 38: A New World!

"It is well-known that we humans are not a supernal race; we are not born with divine abilities. So, in the primordial era, who imparted the Dao? Do you dare to claim that the common mortals who groped for their path were also useless trash?"

Zhou Tian pointed at the man, his hair stirring without wind, his eyes razor-sharp.

The man's face turned ashen, clearly flustered. Da Luo Academy strongly emphasized respecting teachers and the Dao, let alone those earliest pioneers of the Dao. If he dared to say such a thing, Da Luo Academy would likely expel him directly!

In truth, Zhou Tian was once again twisting concepts. While those initial explorers were indeed mortals, they were capable of cultivation, not incapable of it. Debates like this emphasized mental agility, and in his past life, exchanges among keyboard warriors required not only flexible thinking but also fast typing speed. This was multitasking; otherwise, one would be stifled to death if others typed three sentences while they only managed one character. Thus, Zhou Tian's mind was quite flexibly trained.

The best way to defeat someone was to attack them mentally and physically. Since Zhou Tian couldn't defeat the person physically at the moment, he could only mentally crush him...

"You wouldn't dare say it!"

"Why wouldn't you dare say it?"

"Because you're afraid of losing your current status!"

"Of falling back to being looked down upon!"

"Not only do you not dare to call those people trash, you don't even dare to speak harshly to me!"

The man's eyes brightened as he was about to speak, but Zhou Tian cut him off.

"You might be thinking, 'I dare! I dare!'"

"But have you considered who I am? I am the son of the Qin King of the Tianqin Empire, the Qin Emperor's own nephew! And you? You're just an ordinary student of Da Luo Academy, with no background, no influence. If something were to happen to me because of you, the Tianqin Empire would go to war with you all!"

"And if you were to die here, would Da Luo Academy go to war with the Tianqin Empire for your sakes?!"

"Just like now..."

Zhou Tian stepped forward and slapped the man across the face.

*Smack!* The sound was exceptionally loud... Everyone was dumbfounded!

"I slapped you. Do you dare to hit back?!"

"Do you dare?!"

Zhou Tian roared, grabbing the man's hand.

"I'm just a mortal. You could crush me in an instant. Come on, do you dare!!!"

The man's eyes were vacant. He covered his face with one hand, looking at his other hand being pulled by Zhou Tian, trembling.

*Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing?*

*Pfft!* He coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, his eyes rolled back, and he fainted.

"Now *that* is trash, understood?!"

Zhou Tian looked at the remaining students, taking a breath. "Do you know what a keyboard warrior is? Little bunnies!"

"Let's go!"

The remaining people, their faces grim, lifted the unconscious man from the ground and exited the hall.

Tian Ling watched Zhou Tian with her big, adorable eyes, filled with little stars. *So amazing...*

"That was incredible, big brother!"

Zhou Zui stared at Zhou Tian, dumbfounded. To make someone faint just by talking, that was truly something!

"These people truly are as you said, unworthy, with incredibly fragile mental states." Zhou Tian said nonchalantly. "Their minds are too weak. It's clear they aren't disciples from major powers trained since childhood."

"But they've definitely held a grudge against you," Zhou Zui said. "There were a few tough characters among those who came today, though none of them showed up." He added that he'd encountered a few tricky opponents during his fights that day, and it wasn't always a one-sided crushing defeat.

"It doesn't matter. Aren't you clear on my capabilities?" Zhou Tian said, patting Tian Ling's head.

"You're right." Zhou Zui recalled the divine ability that had held him frozen in place for a good while with just three sentences.

"Oh, right, how long were you sitting there?" Zhou Tian asked, still unsure about the duration of his [Sacred Word] ability.

"Big brother, you don't know? A full half-hour! When I got up, the formation had been active for quite a while. I figured it was too late to go anywhere else, so I just came straight to the imperial palace!"

"Half an hour, huh..." Zhou Tian stroked his chin.

"Hey... Gentlemen, don't leave! Stay and have something to eat!" While deep in thought, Zhou Tian suddenly saw a few young people from the Qi Kingdom stealthily making their way toward the hall door, and he couldn't help but call out.

"No, no need..."

"We're not hungry..."

"Let's chat next time, next time..."

"..."

The few forced smiles, then hurried away. *Are you a devil? Still asking us to eat? What if you slap us again later?*

After the departure of those few, the vast palace hall was left with only Zhou Tian and his companions.

Looking at the empty hall, Zhou Tian sighed, "Third Prince, how could you not host them properly? What will you tell His Majesty when he arrives?"

Everyone was speechless...

Zhou Xunchuan gave a wry smile. "Qin King's Heir, aren't you aware of what just happened?"

"What's 'aware' or 'unaware'? You people always fuss over these superficial things. Let's eat, let's eat! Our Tian Ling is hungry!" Zhou Tian led Tian Ling to the table, pulled out a roasted leg of meat, and began stuffing it into Tian Ling's mouth.

***

Inside the Imperial Palace's Council Hall, a place specifically for meetings, not formal court assemblies. It was more for mutual discussion and sharing opinions. Everyone present here held high positions and power, unlike those mere functionary officials.

In the center of the hall was a massive oval metal table. Black metal was engraved with dragon patterns, and at the head sat the Qin Emperor on a purple-gold dragon throne, exquisitely crafted and extraordinary.

The ministers were divided into two rows: the Qin King, the Carefree King, the Imperial Advisor, Prime Minister Liu, and several other highly esteemed individuals were all present.

Zhou Quan and Zhou Yu were also there, but they weren't yet qualified to sit at the main table and could only sit on chairs to the side, observing quietly.

The Qin Emperor, seated at the head, had a slight smile playing on his lips. The ministers seated around the table were unaware of what had transpired. Inside this imperial palace, there was an array that blocked divine sense; only the Qin Emperor's divine sense could extend outwards.

Suppressing his smile, the Qin Emperor continued, "Zhou Quan, please tell us about this newly discovered world!"

"Yes!" Zhou Quan stood up and said, "Some time ago, a powerful world fluctuation emanated from the Void Sea. Following this fluctuation, we discovered a super-large world!"

"Super-large world..." The Imperial Advisor slightly frowned, his eyes shining like stars, constantly evolving.

"What information do we have about this super-large world?" Prime Minister Liu asked from the Qin Emperor's right side.

"The world barrier of this super-large world is too sturdy; we haven't penetrated it yet. The only thing we can confirm is that this world is no less significant than any of the Nine Ancient Provinces!"

*Hiss~*

A collective gasp could be heard.

"Can this information be confirmed?" The Imperial Advisor glowed all over, divine light bursting from his eyes, countless arrays fluctuating, and immense aura pressing down on the council hall.

"This was confirmed by the Three Ancestors!" Zhou Quan stated.

"Then there's no mistake!" The space around Prime Minister Liu twisted. Although he showed no outward aura, his heart was far from calm.
