# Chapter 68: At the Same Realm, My Colossus is Invincible  

The lake shimmered with rippling waves, its emerald waters encircling the scene.  

Gentle breezes brushed past as Liu Baiyu held a nine-tiered exquisite pagoda in his hand. The wind chimes tinkled melodiously, their crisp notes weaving into a harmonious tune.  

He wasted no time in making his stance clear.  

Liu Baiyu's words were sharp as a blade, piercing straight into the heart of Liangdi—Gongshu Duwang.  

The unrest in the northern territories was due to their geographical circumstances, bordering the barbarian tribes. If things escalated and the two hundred thousand frontier troops mutinied, opening the eight passes to welcome the barbarians south, how could the Great Jin resist?  

Moreover, the north had General Yu Yun—the foremost of the Ten Great Generals, a revered figure in military strategy, respected throughout the realm.  

But what did Liangdi have?  

Situated deep within the Great Jin's heartland, its martial spirit had long withered.  

If Liangdi dared to rebel, a hundred thousand frontier troops could march south while the capital's imperial forces advanced north, encircling Daliang within ten days.  

Having conceded to the north, the court could not afford to yield to Liangdi as well—otherwise, what authority would the Great Jin have left to command the land?  

His words provoked outrage among the Liangdi representatives. Du Changwang's eyes blazed with fury, his face twisted in indignation. Though he sighed inwardly, knowing this confrontation was inevitable, as a son of Liangdi, he could not back down.  

Du Changwang stepped forward and shouted, "Why is the Heavenly King so harsh toward the people of Liang?"  

Before he could continue, Liu Baiyu coldly interrupted, "What 'people of Liang'? There has only ever been the people of Jin!"  

"Du Changwang, you twist words with malicious intent, seeking to divide the Great Jin!"  

"Speak!"  

"Are you colluding with Eastern Qi to sow chaos in our empire?"  

Zhongsun Taishi adjusted his tall crown and stepped forward with solemn dignity. His voice was steady and grave. "The court's cruelty leaves no room for compromise."  

"Do you think Liangdi has no one left?"  

"Half the court's taxes come from Liangdi!"  

"Without us, where would the court find the might to stand above all nations?"  

Lin Sanxing, who had been standing silently with a beast-patterned sword strapped to his back, finally opened his eyes and studied Zhongsun Taishi before speaking slowly, "Brother Zhongsun is a man of the mountains, devoted to poetry and music. Why involve yourself in worldly strife?"  

Zhongsun Taishi sneered, "There is no such thing as 'beyond the world.' Born in Liang, I shall die in Liang."  

"If I do not stand for Liangdi in its time of need, caring only for my own gain, how could I face the millions of our people?"  

"You, as the court's hound, only know how to obey. What do you understand of human bonds?"  

From afar, a booming voice rang out: "Well said!"  

"For years, the north has suffered under the barbarians—but has Liangdi fared any better?"  

"Countless people toil all year, only for the court to take the fruits of their labor. The land yields barely enough to pay taxes!"  

"Thus, we had no choice but to turn to commerce—that is the true source of Liangdi's prosperity!"  

"Today's wealth was earned through our own hands, not bestowed from the heavens!"  

"Why is wealth treated as a crime, a sin?"  

"The court tears down our barriers, leaving Liangdi defenseless against the north. Even if the barbarians stay away, northern troops could sweep in overnight, surrounding Daliang within days!"  

"Are northerners human, while we of Liangdi are mere beasts of burden, destined to serve you for life?"  

A towering figure strode forward—a burly man with a thick beard, tattooed arms, and a thunderous voice.  

Lin Sanxing recognized him at once: Lu Heshang, the eccentric hero of Liangdi.  

With this, all three of Liangdi's Earth Ranking experts—Gongshu Duwang, Zhongsun Taishi, and Lu Heshang—had gathered.  

In the past, when the Great Jin mobilized against Eastern Qi or marched south against Chen, these men had always found excuses—illness, secluded training—never assembling in full. Yet when opposing the court, they stood united.  

Just as the north had revealed its hidden masters, including the legendary Bai Zizai, Liangdi now did the same.  

The Great Jin stood as the foremost of the four nations, not just in military might but in the strength of its martial artists. Yet this power remained fragmented, wasted.  

Zhao Wudao, who had remained silent until now, finally spoke. His single eye gleamed like a star as he surveyed the assembly.  

"My foster father's presence in the north ensures no southern incursion. Your fears are unfounded."  

"Liangdi's sacrifices are not ignored by the court."  

"But the Mohists are outsiders—they must not enter Jin."  

"My foster father blocked the Mohist Grandmaster for the empire's sake. Yet he also said Liangdi's grievances must be heard."  

"We are all subjects of Jin—none above or below."  

Liu Baiyu frowned at Zhao Wudao's sudden shift in tone, clearly displeased. Lin Sanxing, however, was unsurprised—Yu Yun had always been a man of contradictions.  

His loyalty was never to the north alone—it was carved into his bones, an unshakable devotion.  

Otherwise, he would not have lost the north's support, weakening his own faction.  

The Prime Minister had sent Liu Baiyu and Zhao Wudao precisely because he understood their roles—one as the enforcer, the other as the mediator.  

Zhao Wudao paused before continuing, "Each side has its arguments."  

"In the end, strength decides the outcome."  

"That is the only way to settle this fairly."  

"And that is why Master Gongshu invited us here."  

"But martial contests risk bloodshed, breeding lasting grudges."  

"We are all Jin's people—family. To turn on each other would only amuse our enemies."  

"The Colossus is an ancient treasure, a symbol of Jin's might. It should not be wielded against our own."  

"Instead, let us set a rule: combatants must be below the Divine Miracles realm. Each side selects a champion to decide the outcome."  

"Even if they fight to the death, with our skills, we can intervene in time."  

The Great General's talent for mediation was undeniable.  

Silence fell over the gathering.  

Gongshu Duwang, seated atop his one-horned dire tiger, gazed down at Zhao Wudao and Liu Baiyu. This was an insult—Liangdi's younger generation lacked such prodigies.  

Jin Wuming's origins were unknown, but the Divine Blood Sect was a demonic faction from Zhengdi's Fangzhou. How could Liangdi compete?  

Gongshu Duwang chuckled mockingly.  

"Conflict without destruction is no bad thing."  

"I speak for Liangdi, not for myself."  

"This method is acceptable—but selecting juniors is unnecessary."  

"I have brought forth the Mohist treasure—under Universal Love, all are equal."  

"Let us all suppress our strength to the Xuan Realm of the Innate Stage."  

"Then we shall see who is truly superior."  

"You've saved yourselves—for at the same realm, my Colossus is invincible."
