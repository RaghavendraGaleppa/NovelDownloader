# Chapter 42: The Empress, Two Kings, and a New Era  

Deception.  

It was all deception.  

The longest path in this world was the path of deception.  

In the autumn of the fourth year of the Zhi Zheng era of Great Jin, on the eighteenth day of the ninth month, Chancellor Chen Qingyao declared that the emperor was frivolous and unfit to rule. Emperor Liu Shaobai was deposed and demoted to the rank of Prince of Beiyang. With the kingdom unable to endure a single day without a ruler, the Grand Princess Liu Qingzhi was enthroned as the new sovereign—the second female emperor in history.  

The very next day, the new empress held her grand wedding. Chen Qingyao, now titled Imperial Consort, was enfeoffed as Prince of Zheng and appointed as regent.  

Meanwhile, General Yu Yun of the Northern Garrison was released without charges, promoted to Grand General, and enfeoffed as Prince of Yan, also serving as regent.  

In just three short days, an earth-shattering upheaval settled into place, vanishing without a trace.  

Dou Changsheng watched this grand spectacle unfold before his eyes, utterly dazzled.  

The young emperor had been thoroughly devoured, left with nothing—not even his most trusted aunt, the Grand Princess, who had long since conspired with Chen Qingyao, sharing both a bed and schemes.  

Liu Baiyu, the revered "Tota Heavenly King" and a formidable figure of the imperial clan, had been conveniently stationed far away at Sanyang Mountain when the crisis struck, unable to return to the capital in time. Similar cases were numerous. By the time the dust settled and Liu Baiyu finally returned to the capital, he found his noble rank elevated, his official position adjusted, his salary increased, and his relatives all promoted. With no choice, he could only sigh and accept the rule of the empress.  

The only one who truly suffered was the young emperor.  

Ah, right.  

Dou Changsheng himself had also reaped some benefits.  

His three-day stay in the capital was precisely to await the new emperor's rewards.

### The Hall of Supreme Harmony  

This sacred hall of Great Jin was where decrees capable of shaking the world were issued. After passing through layers of security, Dou Changsheng now stood within this lofty, celestial-like palace.  

The Grand Princess—no, the Empress—did not appear in full regalia. Instead, she wore simple green robes, her dark hair cascading loosely, her sleeves rolled up to reveal pale wrists. Beside her, Chen Qingyao knelt behind a guqin like a musician, his slender fingers plucking the strings, filling the air with melodious notes.  

Opposite them sat a man of ordinary appearance, raising cup after cup of wine with a melancholic expression, his eyes shadowed with guilt. At first glance, Dou Changsheng recognized him—Yu Yun, now Grand General and Prince of Yan.  

These three represented the most powerful figures in Great Jin, embodying its three dominant factions:  

- The Empress, representing the imperial clan and the capital's Liang region.  
- Yu Yun, representing the northern territories.  
- Chen Qingyao, representing the Zheng region.  

As Dou Changsheng entered, the Empress lifted her gaze and spoke gently, "The northern territories are in turmoil due to the deposed emperor. The people’s hearts are restless, resistant to the court’s rule."  

She sighed. "I do not blame them. Their grievances are justified. Now that I have rectified the chaos, it is time to soothe their discontent."  

"After discussions with my ministers, we have decided to dispatch the arrears of military pay to the north. Since today is as good a day as any, I appoint the Pacifying Barbarians Commandant as the escort officer to personally deliver the funds."  

"Furthermore, I shall issue an edict exempting the north from taxes for three years. All checkpoints between Liang and the northern territories will be dismantled to facilitate unimpeded trade. Northern goods may flow freely to Liang and Zheng, while supplies from those regions can swiftly reach the north."  

Yu Yun set down his cup and interjected, "Liang is a land of open plains. Without checkpoints, if the north falls, Liang will be defenseless. Enemy forces could reach the capital in a single day—no time to establish defenses. The empire would face ruin."  

The Empress waved her hand decisively. "Precisely. Only by doing this can we regain the north’s trust. I must show them that I stand with them."  

"If the northern territories fall to the barbarians, Great Jin falls with it."  

Yu Yun sighed but did not argue further. He took another sip of wine, recognizing the manipulation at play. He saw through it, yet had no choice but to voice his concerns—exactly as Liu Qingzhi had intended.  

The young emperor was gone, but what replaced him was no saint either.  

Only this one was older, more skilled in the art of power.  

Ah, well.  

At least she was better than the immature boy-emperor.

Dou Changsheng felt nothing. After all, he was not truly of this world. But he couldn’t show it. Instead, he offered hollow courtesy: "This humble subject thanks Your Majesty."  

Sacrificing an emperor to placate the explosive tensions in the north—there was no denying its effectiveness.  

Dou Changsheng had no reverence for emperors, having grown up in an era where their mystique had long faded. But in this world, even among mighty martial artists, many still clung to the creed: *If the ruler demands death, the subject has no choice but to die.*  

Loyalty to the throne and devotion to the nation were deeply ingrained.  

In just three days, a new emperor was crowned, military pay was secured, and the north was pacified. It all felt surreal.  

A proper imperial enthronement required months of preparation—auspicious dates, elaborate ceremonies. The same went for an imperial wedding. Yet everything had been rushed through under the guise of "simplicity for the sake of the north," cloaked in righteousness to silence dissent.  

When officials protested that such haste diminished imperial dignity and invited mockery from other nations, they were rebuked: *The saved funds will feed the northern people, saving lives.*  

Observing the trio before him, Dou Changsheng realized his timeline had diverged from that of "Future Dou." In that other path, the young emperor likely still reigned.  

Here, their swift action had been triggered by Qingyang Daoist’s failed fake death, exposing the military pay scandal. In the other timeline, without that misstep, the young emperor might have retained power.  

Truly, the flutter of a butterfly’s wings could stir a storm across the ocean.  

As Chen Qingyao’s guqin played on, the Empress spoke again:  

"Dou Changsheng."  

"You exposed Qingyang Daoist’s scheme to fake his death and uncovered the true culprit behind the stolen military pay. Your contributions to justice and stability are immense."  

"The court rewards merit without hesitation. Name your desire—rare treasures, divine techniques, peerless beauties, hidden paradises…"  

"Whatever Great Jin possesses, it shall be yours."  

*Dream on.*  

Dou Changsheng scoffed inwardly. Such grandiose promises were empty words—only a fool would believe them.  

If he dared say, *I’d like to be emperor*, he’d never leave this hall alive.  

But lacking the knowledge to make a precise demand, he replied without hesitation:  

"What Your Majesty bestows is what this humble subject deserves."  

"I dare not entertain presumptuous desires."  

He tossed the ball back into her court.  

Surely an empress wouldn’t be stingy, right?
