# Chapter 39: Bearing Karma  

During the auction process, Han Yue would strictly adhere to the price limits he had set for himself.  

Following the order of items being auctioned, if Han Yue failed to secure an earlier item, he would reallocate the unused budget evenly to the subsequent items. This ensured that as the auction progressed, his available funds for later items would increase.  

After all, he had already decided to invest all his spirit stones into this Dharma Assembly.  

Han Yue carefully reviewed his plan and, satisfied with it, tucked the manual away.  

Of course, there would inevitably be third-grade treasures at the assembly that weren’t listed in the manual. In such cases, Han Yue would have to adapt on the spot.  

He continued immersing himself in cultivation—refining his mana bit by bit, tempering his body, and condensing runes. The path of cultivation was endless!  

Watching his steady progress brought Han Yue immense joy, ensuring he never found the process tedious.  

In the days that followed, Han Yue rarely left his residence. He spent his time within the courtyard, purifying his mana and practicing stillness. During breaks, he would ride the light up to the clouds, calming his mind as he observed the rolling sea of clouds, the moon bathing him in its glow, and the sun reigning supreme in the sky.  

He particularly enjoyed alternating between secluded mana refinement and soaring freely in the open sky, savoring the interplay of stillness and movement.  

This routine purified his spirit and cleansed his aura.  

Han Yue relished this lifestyle—it smoothed away his inner restlessness and released subconscious pressures.  

As a result, his mana grew increasingly vibrant.  

One Thunder Nurturing rune after another took form.  

Han Yue was inching ever closer to his second Great Perfection!  

His understanding of *Thunder Nurturing the Body* deepened with each passing day.  

However, as Han Yue reduced his frequency of hunting expeditions, the accumulated mana within him gradually reached its absorption limit.  

Whenever this happened, he would channel all his mana into the **[Thread Armor]**, subjecting it to intense refinement under the surging energy.  

The more refined the **[Thread Armor]** became, the more harmoniously it fused with Han Yue’s aura, enhancing its defensive capabilities.  

Han Yue always found ways to push his limits, tirelessly cultivating every aspect of his strength.  

Time flowed steadily, and Han Yue deliberately minimized his presence in Fenrouji. He was preparing to leave.  

On several occasions, Xiao Qing, representing the merchant house, came to invite Han Yue on hunting trips, but he declined each time.  

For now, Han Yue only wished to quietly await the arrival of the Dharma Assembly.  

---  

As the assembly drew nearer, more and more out-of-town cultivators began appearing in Fenrouji. Most arrived in merchant caravans, with only a few traveling alone.  

The influence of the merchant house’s Dharma Assembly exceeded Han Yue’s expectations.  

Geographically, it spanned a full quarter of Guizhou Prefecture!  

For a secondary organization under Fenrouji’s banner, this was the merchant house’s absolute limit.  

Some distant sects and factions had set out early to ensure they wouldn’t miss the event.  

Many of these visitors, upon arriving in Fenrouji, ventured into the outer territories.  

With Fenrouji temporarily welcoming outsiders, it was the perfect opportunity to hunt some demonic beasts.  

The town grew increasingly chaotic.  

As the assembly approached, Han Yue stopped leaving his residence altogether, confining himself to Courtyard Nine.  

He spent his days practicing, sparring with Fang Yi, and occasionally guiding Xiao Liu in hunting techniques.  

He had already informed the residents of Courtyard Nine about his impending departure and received their support.  

When it came to matters of the Dao, no one could rightfully stand in his way.  

Then, three days before the assembly, an entirely unexpected visitor disrupted Han Yue’s routine.  

The master of the Sword Pavilion—whom Han Yue had briefly met during the New Year’s Fenrou Ceremony—suddenly arrived at Courtyard Nine. Under the astonished gazes of the others, he sought out Han Yue, proposing a transaction.  

Han Yue was equally surprised, but he held great respect for the swordsman’s strength and was willing to hear him out.  

He invited the Sword Pavilion master into his quarters, and the two spoke behind closed doors.  

Han Yue initiated the conversation:  

"I’ve long wished to make your acquaintance but never found the right opportunity. I never imagined you’d come to me first. May I ask the purpose of your visit?"  

"You flatter me, Master Han. I am Yang Fan. My sudden visit is indeed presumptuous, but with the Dharma Assembly so close, time is of the essence. I’ve come to request an item from you for the assembly."  

Yang Fan wasted no time, stating his request directly.  

Han Yue was even more puzzled. He considered himself penniless except for his spirit stones—what else of value could he possibly possess that would draw someone’s interest?  

"What item do you seek?"  

"After some inquiries, I learned that when you first arrived in Fenrouji, you carried a white fox-skin bundle. Is that fox pelt still in your possession?"  

Han Yue was stunned.  

Someone was specifically seeking the fox pelt he had brought from the Demon Nation!  

---  

Yang Fan continued:  

"The pelt itself isn’t particularly valuable, but its origin holds significance for me."  

"I don’t know where you obtained it, Master Han, but this pelt carries heavy karma."  

"You are not a disciple of a major sect, nor do you have deep backing. Keeping this pelt would bring you no good fortune."  

"If someone gave this to you, they’ve essentially burdened you with a calamity—truly malicious intent!"  

"If you’re willing to transfer the pelt to me, I can swear a Dao oath to bear its karma in full."  

After hearing Yang Fan’s words, Han Yue retrieved the white fox pelt from his **[Silver Hairpin]**.  

He asked, "Is this the item you seek?"  

Yang Fan took the pelt, plucked a strand of fur, and examined it closely before nodding.  

"Without a doubt, this is it."  

Han Yue then said,  

"I’ve had this pelt for some time now, yet nothing unusual has occurred. Could you enlighten me about the karma behind it? I’d like to set my mind at ease."  

"That’s only fair," Yang Fan replied.  

"This white fox pelt originally belonged to a first or second-grade demonic cultivator. Among second-grade materials, its quality is top-tier, but since it hasn’t reached third-grade, it holds little value for cultivators like us."  

"However, this white fox’s bloodline is extraordinary. Tracing its lineage, its ancestor is a fourth-grade Heavenly Fox—a renowned Great Sage among the demonic races!"  

"To be honest, these Great Sages of the demonic races live eternal lives, with endless longevity. Their less-talented direct descendants aren’t particularly valued."  

"But recent events have led these Great Sages to begin reclaiming their scattered bloodline descendants."  

"And this white fox pelt cannot escape the ancestral bloodline tracking. Sooner or later, it will be discovered!"
