Chapter 215: Golden Core Realm! Taiyi Tiangang Myriad Gods' Natal Realm

"An eighth-grade Immortal Seed?"

A look of expectation, yet not surprise, flickered in Zhang Jing's eyes. After all, the colossal three billion experience points consumed by the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability after reaching Level Nine had all been accumulated for this very transformation. Not to mention, it was originally a divine ability that was already close to the peak of the ninth-grade.

With a shift of his mind, within his Niwan Palace, a peculiar Immortal Seed, about the size of a palm, subtly displaying the rotating anomaly of twenty-four heavenly worlds, appeared in his vision. The moment he first saw it, a vast and boundless aura spread out. Simultaneously, as the numerous illusory heavenly worlds within the Immortal Seed rotated, they drew in endless void energy, which was then jointly transformed into a massive amount of immortal qi by the Primordial Immortal Core and the Void Furnace.

During this process, the wondrous miniature world membranes, semi-tangible yet semi-ethereal, that enveloped each layer of the illusory miniature heavenly worlds, continuously exhaled extremely rich immortal qi. Threads of profound energy immediately began to brew, seemingly making these twenty-four illusory miniature heavenly worlds appear to transition from虚 (void) to 实 (reality). A flood of insights burst forth from the depths of his heart, almost causing Zhang Jing's thoughts to stagnate.

...

After a long while, "Whoosh—"

A deep, prolonged breath suddenly echoed throughout the entire cultivation chamber. The sound was incredibly heavy, as if an ancient behemoth was slumbering within. In the palace, and even outside on the immortal island, sand and stones flew, and strong winds howled, a truly terrifying sight.

"The Twenty-Four Heavens Immortal Seed has been successfully cultivated, which means the last condition before advancing to the Golden Core Realm has been met. So, next—"

A sense of感慨 (deep emotion/reflection) flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. The various experiences of bitter cultivation within the Proud Cloud Secret Realm and on the immortal island during his secluded retreat, flashed before his eyes. He had wasted so much time, expended such immense energy. Wasn't it all for this very moment?

"Let's see what kind of Golden Core I can forge this time, and what kind of divine ability I can meld." Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed. Immediately, all his concentration immersed itself in his Niwan Palace. Although it was a blank expanse, it was constantly filled with a powerful True Meaning of Grand Beginning, and his Dao Foundation entered his vision, surrounded by immortal light, radiating profound intent of primordial creation.

With a thought from Zhang Jing, a wisp of hazy immortal light abruptly appeared. Threads of true intent for creating void instantly surged forth. At the same time, a terrifying Dao Will, which, upon its mere appearance, seemed to pull everything back to the state of primordial creation and the unity of all things, followed closely behind.

"The pseudo-version of Innate Primordial Immortal Light, the Dao Will of Taiyi!"

His gaze lightly swept over the two trump cards he had relied upon to win first place in the Foundation Establishment stage of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm. An uncontrollable surge of excitement welled up in Zhang Jing's heart. Although both were products of the fusion of the thirty-six fundamental Dao Wills he had mastered, they had branched into two different directions, containing distinct Dao and principles. One focused on the Dao of Creation, while the other traced back to the Dao of Innate Taiyi's origin and genesis.

However, without exception, both served as the foundation for Zhang Jing's advancement to the Golden Core Realm. "It seems I spent the most time, energy, and fortune on the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability, but ultimately, the Twenty-Four Heavens were merely the perfect soil to carry and even enhance these two Dao and principles."

"An eighth-grade Immortal Seed should be enough."

Above him, a six-layered, six-hued, six-colored auspicious cloud quietly ascended. The six-colored immortal light immediately surged, then began to descend. Zhang Jing's figure was gradually enveloped by the immortal light. In an instant, his expression became calm as still water. His entire being seemed to have entered a peculiar state of neither sorrow nor joy.

As Zhang Jing willed it, the jade talisman in his Niwan Palace instantly blazed with light, enveloping the Twenty-Four Heavens Dharma Seed. In the next moment, the pseudo-version of the Innate Primordial Immortal Light materialized into its original form, with the purest Dao principles represented by the thirty-six fundamental Dao Wills intertwining and merging. The Five Elements and Yin-Yang served as the core, while Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water acted as the sharp edge! Nothing could block it, nothing could destroy it.

Subsequently, enveloped by the jade talisman's light, the various Dao principles and laws of the pseudo-version of Innate Primordial Immortal Light broke down into fragments, gradually merging into the Twenty-Four Heavens Immortal Seed.

Boom—

Trembling! Everything in his vision was trembling! Faint 'crackling' sounds, both distinct and indistinct, echoed in his ears. That was the sound of the Twenty-Four Heavens Immortal Seed shattering and then continuously re-forming, unable to bear the power of the Innate Primordial Immortal Light.

Still seemingly not fast enough, Zhang Jing's heart stirred. The Dao Will of Taiyi, already vibrating non-stop, also began to gradually integrate into the Twenty-Four Heavens Immortal Seed. On the jade talisman, the small characters recording the information of the eighth-grade Twenty-Four Heavens Immortal Seed began to blur. Vaguely, it could be seen that the Immortal Seed's rank was rapidly ascending.

[Eighth-grade Immortal Seed: Twenty-Four Heavens]
...
[Seventh-grade Immortal Seed: Twenty Heavens]
[Seventh-grade */%#:&%* Heavens]
...

Behind Zhang Jing, layers upon layers of twenty-four illusory heavens spontaneously rose, and a vast, boundless aura began to spread rapidly in all directions. If anyone were to enter the cultivation chamber at this moment, they would certainly discover that within each layer of the twenty-four illusory heavenly worlds behind Zhang Jing, terrifying Dao Will of Taiyi was gathering, turning the entire illusory world into a chaotic spectacle.

Furthermore, countless streaks of Innate Primordial Immortal Light, connecting heaven and earth, began to gradually merge into the illusory heavenly worlds. The boundaries were expanding! And—new illusory heavenly worlds were faintly being opened, transforming into entirely new realms. An indescribable and inexplicable terrifying change began to appear little by little within Zhang Jing's body and upon the Twenty-Four Heavens Immortal Seed.

At the same time, the Twenty-Four Heavens Immortal Seed, having merged with the Dao Will of Taiyi and the Innate Primordial Immortal Light, began to gradually burrow into the Dao Foundation of Grand Beginning under Zhang Jing's gaze.

In an instant, hundreds of thousands, even millions, of Dao patterns densely appeared on the Dao Foundation of Grand Beginning, faintly outlining thirty-six magnificent illusory heavenly worlds, which were then enveloped by a veil of chaos. The Dao Foundation began to collapse little by little. A faint golden light began to emerge, grand and boundless, like a scorching sun.

...

Who knew how long had passed.

Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, the boiling aura on his body now restrained to the extreme, not leaking a single wisp.

"This is the Golden Core Realm!"

"All cultivation and insights converge into a single Golden Core; from now on, my divine abilities are immeasurable."

A touch of joy abruptly sprang from the depths of his heart, then instantly spread to his face, transforming into a brilliantly contented smile. Zhang Jing closed his eyes and savored the feeling for a moment. Then, the curve of his lips grew increasingly exaggerated, as if they would split to his ears in the next instant.

"Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine years of lifespan!" Zhang Jing couldn't help but click his tongue in amazement. It seemed the longevity of cultivators in the Grand Beginning Primordial Realm lineage wasn't just talk. He, too, could now be considered... truly immortal, in a sense.

"Right!" As if suddenly remembering something, Zhang Jing's mind abruptly sank into his Niwan Palace.

He saw a Golden Core, radiating myriad rays of light like a blazing sun, rotating steadily near the center, precisely where his Dao Foundation of Grand Beginning had previously resided. With each rotation of the Golden Core, an overwhelmingly vast amount of immortal spiritual energy was devoured, subtly strengthening his cultivation by a fraction.

However, Zhang Jing wasn't particularly concerned with that at the moment. He looked directly at the jade talisman, which firmly occupied the central position. Then, his mind paused.

[Talent: Taiyi Tiangang Myriad Gods' Natal Realm]
Natal Realm Opened: 0/36
Innate Deities Born: None

"Wait, it actually directly melded into a talent divine ability? But why is there no grade?" Zhang Jing thought with a hint of surprise.
