# Chapter 59: The Spider Demon Begs for a Quick Death

The human-handed spider demon king had laid out a three-layer web trap. Any prey attempting to escape would ultimately be ensnared in the sticky strands.

A rather cautious demon indeed.

Xiao Ji waited for it.

He had taken antidote pills in advance—specifically formulated against spider venom—along with general poison-resistant pills, creating a double layer of protection against toxins. These pills were expensive, but Qian Duoyu didn't care. He had even asked, "Is one enough? Want a whole bottle?" 

Such was the way of cultivation through pill-popping tycoons.

The spider demon king circled the two men rapidly, leaping from tree to tree like a monkey. Xiao Ji knew it was secretly releasing hallucinogenic poison gas. 

For now, the spirit flame lantern wasn't needed. Xiao Ji's first move was to intimidate the creature with his Thunderstart Sword. 

The sword left its sheath with a violet glow. Its blade shone like a crescent moon, radiating killing intent that destroyed everything in its path. The spider demon dodged the attack, leaping to a treetop and spitting deadly venomous threads downward.

Xiao Ji easily pulled Qian Duoyu out of harm's way.

After several exchanges, the spider demon king began feeling powerless. It wasn't that the daoist posed an overwhelming threat, but rather that all its efforts seemed to land on empty air—unable to inflict any real damage on the human cultivators. 

It was like punching cotton. 

That sense of futility could only be understood by those who experienced it firsthand. Moreover, only the spider knew how desperately it had been releasing poison—nearly exhausting its entire reserve of venom and silk. Any more, and it would have poisoned itself. 

Yet its opponents remained unaffected in such close combat. Were they born with poison-resistant spiritual roots? What terrible luck. 

"And someone with poison resistance couldn't possibly look like that," the spider demon fretted anxiously. 

Anxiety wasn't exclusive to humans—all creatures could feel it. 

Xiao Ji had predicted every move, or rather, knowing the spider's actions in advance allowed him to evade danger effortlessly. 

Seizing the moment when the spider demon hesitated, Xiao Ji suddenly threw Qian Duoyu forward. 

Distracted by the portly cultivator, the spider momentarily forgot about the daoist's sword. 

Three violet sword beams slashed horizontally. The spider instantly spat out a silk shield, blocking the attacks. 

Then Xiao Ji flicked a spark from his spirit flame lantern, burning away the shield and exposing the demon's lower body. 

Another flash of the sword, and six of the spider's legs were cleanly severed—so swiftly it seemed rehearsed.

A legless spider, even if it could still move using demonic energy, was significantly slower. 

Under Xiao Ji's relentless assault, it soon lay gasping for breath on the verge of death. Dozens of smaller spider demons also fell to the sword. 

"Friend Qian, since you don't get out much, wouldn't you like to do something to it?" Xiao Ji suggested, wanting the man to participate. 

"Its meat doesn't look very tasty," Qian Duoyu said hesitantly, eyeing the spider's dark, unappetizing flesh. 

Was food all he thought about when it came to demons? 

Xiao Ji shook his head and sheathed his sword. "I meant, don't you want to experience the thrill of slaying a demon?" 

The opportunity was perfect, with virtually no risk. 

Qian Duoyu brightened at the idea. Since his father had urged him to cultivate, he had diligently consumed pills day and night but never actually fought a demon. 

Today would mark his first demon-slaying—even if it was just delivering the final blow to a creature far stronger than himself. 

A moment worth commemorating. 

He first swallowed half a bottle of qi-boosting pills, then launched condensed qi spheres that exploded upon hitting the spider. 

The spider didn't die. 

He continued. 

After dozens of attempts, the spider still clung to life. Qian Duoyu had to gulp down more qi-restoring pills to maintain his stamina. 

Such was the struggle of a lower-level cultivator—even with perfect accuracy, damage output remained lacking. 

The spider demon king protested the portly cultivator's actions with strange screeches. Unfortunately, the language barrier prevented Qian Duoyu from understanding. 

But Xiao Ji did. 

[This spider demon wishes the fat man would stop and let you finish it quickly...]

While en route to hunt the Skywing Tiger demon, eliminating the spider demon king was an unexpected bonus. 

Xiao Ji extracted the demon core and venom sac, then used his spirit flame lantern to burn away the three-layer poison web trap before resuming their journey. 

After this interlude, Qian Duoyu refrained from using his magical tools. He realized that doing less was his greatest contribution to their duo. 

"The spider demon core and venom sac are our spoils from this hunt," Xiao Ji said. "Though you seem wealthy, fairness is fairness. We'll sell these in Tai Gu City and split the proceeds." 

Qian Duoyu was delighted. Though money meant little to him, earning spirit stones through his own efforts was a first. 

"You're quite decent!" was all he managed to say. 

"I think so too," Xiao Ji replied without modesty. 

Though not comparable to blessed lands or secret realms, the Nine Nether Valley was ideal for low-level cultivators. Its complex terrain and diverse, manageable creatures made it perfect for inexperienced practitioners. 

Moreover, information about the valley was well-documented—which demons lurked where, what dangers to avoid, and detailed strategies were all available, even published in guidebooks. 

Xiao Ji consulted his copy. "Two more days along this path, past a swamp, and the second lake we see is the Skywing Tiger's territory. It's nearly mealtime—shall we rest and eat?" 

"Excellent idea." Qian Duoyu perked up at the mention of food. 

After some discussion, they decided to return and try roasted spider legs. 

No matter how grotesque a demon looked, its meat always tasted better than ordinary creatures—hence why restaurants thrived in cultivation cities. 

Cultivators supplemented their qi by consuming demon meat, and the wealthy even selected dishes based on their spiritual roots: wind-aligned cultivators ate avian demons, water-aligned favored fish, earth-aligned preferred spirit vegetables... 

As the cultivation saying went: "You are what you eat." 

Though unproven, the tradition persisted unquestioned. 

Qian Duoyu wasn't picky—the stranger the food, the more he wanted to try it. 

"Roasted spider legs are amazing!" he exclaimed by the campfire. "Brother Xiao, should we grill the venom sac too?"

**Author's Note:** Why write about a spider? Because days ago, I found one the size of a palm on my pillow... After a fierce battle, I weakened its speed by whipping off a leg with my enchanted shorts, then finished it with an ancient dust-covered broom before sealing it in a plastic furnace for refinement...
