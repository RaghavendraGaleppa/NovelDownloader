# Chapter 658: The Human Calamity Begins

The Divine霄 (Shenxiao) Dao Fruit had already begun to manifest in the world.

After all, the Divine霄 Dao Fruit had been hidden from the world. To force it to manifest again, prying it from the jaws of the Heavenly Dao, required immense effort. Otherwise, how could Xu Yunfan have needed to initiate a ritual to build up momentum?

"I wonder if killing a True Lord would allow the Dao Fruit to condense instantly..."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but mutter softly, lifting his gaze toward the distance, his eyes filled with a hint of anticipation.

At this moment, the Golden Body of the Bodhisattva Hui Ri trembled violently. The golden river of merit flowing through the roots of the Bodhi Sacred Tree was actually being corrupted by dark golden blood lightning.

Seeing that Wukong's Eight-Armed, Angry-Eyed Dharma Form had completely solidified, the nascent Caged Hell Mingwang Grotto-Heaven was frantically devouring the shadow of the Buddhist Kingdom.

The Bodhisattva let out a piercing, furious roar: "The throne of the Self-Royal Buddha was obtained by our Buddhist Sect after ten thousand years of empty attunement! How dare you demonic scum lay your hands on it!"

"Demonic scum?"

True Lord Pudu suddenly pressed his fingers together, slicing open his palm. His essence blood transformed into a blood-colored Bagua and merged into the barrier. "Back when the True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra of the Divine Martial World was forcibly altered by you into the Battle-Buddha Sutra, why didn't you mention the words 'demonic scum'?"

When competing for the Divine Martial World, the Primordial Origin Sect had suffered a great loss, allowing the Bodhi Zen Pure Land to grasp the external Dao Fruit pointed to by the True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra.

Now was the perfect opportunity for retaliation.

The blood light of the barrier flared intensely, actually pushing back the shadow of the Buddhist Kingdom until it cracked inch by inch.

Seizing this opening, the ninety-nine Purple Gold Divine Dragons in the Eastern Wasteland Ruins completely clamped down on the Golden Core shadow, branding the Dao markings that could obliterate all methods onto the void.

"Too late!"

True Lord Pudu suddenly pulled back.

The Battle-King Buddha Fruit had fully formed into a demonic aura, and a blood-stained Vajra pestle pierced through the firmament of the Buddhist Kingdom.

Meanwhile, the pillar of lightning from the Divine霄 Dao Fruit violently contracted, and a Dao Fruit slowly descended toward Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan looked up. As his mana surged, he began to lift his Grotto-Heaven, ramming it toward the Dao Fruit.

The Bodhisattva Hui Ri's Thousand-Hand Dharma Form dissipated inch by inch, and cracks spread across his Golden Body like porcelain.

True Lord Pudu had already dissipated into pure energy, leaving only his voice echoing through the mountains and rivers.

"The earthly Buddhist Kingdom has ultimately become a mere illusion... If the Great Awakening One asks for an explanation, remember to say it was Lu Chunyang who forced this Lord to choose the Eastern Wasteland."

The Bodhisattva Hui Ri's Thousand-Hand Dharma Form shattered with a悲鸣 (mournful cry), and a trickle of pale golden Buddhist blood溢出 (overflowed) from the corner of his Golden Body's mouth.

"Xu! Yun! Fan!"

The Bodhisattva's furious roar resounded through the Three Sects.

It was over. Everything was over.

He looked resentfully at Wukong, who had fully transformed into the Battle-King Buddha, undergoing the baptism of the Dao Fruit. The three disciples below, including Sanzang, were already too stunned by the rapid changes to speak.

"Wukong has become a Bodhisattva?" Zhu Bajie stammered.

Sanzang, who was the present incarnation originally enlightened by the World Honored One Tathagata, couldn't help but let out a deep sigh upon seeing this scene. He lowered his hands and silently chanted a Buddhist name.

In the end, the Sect Master of the Primordial Origin Sect was one move ahead.

In the ruins, Xu Yunfan's main body was slowly floating into the air, facing the descending lightning of the Divine霄 Dao Fruit.

Within his Dantian, the ninety-nine Purple Gold Divine Dragons clamped down on the Golden Core shadow. The indestructible imagery of "Obliterating All Methods, Carrying the Myriad Heavens" turned into substantial Dao markings, branding the void.

The Divine霄 True Lord shall be established today.

High above the firmament, a crack silently tore open the void. The slightly weakened and disheveled True Lord Qingyuan rushed out from within.

He was just about to return to the Primordial Origin Sect when his figure paused. He looked toward the Eastern Wasteland, his expression filled with unexpected shock.

At this moment, how could he not know that Xu Yunfan had used the three main gods of Aitira to besiege him, delaying his return, and immediately turned back to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World to undergo his ascension.

If Xu Yunfan were truly to succeed, True Lord Qingyuan would not be able to eat or sleep in peace.

With the enmity between the two, even if the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect valued profit over righteousness, they absolutely could not let go of this grudge.

Or rather, he might let it go, but Xu Yunfan definitely would not.

Over the years, those who had provoked Xu Yunfan had basically met with bad ends.

He had seen it all with his own eyes.

True Lord Qingyuan's gaze pierced through the endless distance, landing simultaneously above the Eastern Wasteland and the Wansheng Sword Sect.

When he saw the majestic Dao Rhyme of the Divine霄 Dao Fruit and the Cangming Dao Fruit appearing together, and especially felt the supreme imagery of Xu Yunfan's main body, forged from ninety-nine strands of Golden Nature, on the verge of fully solidifying—"Divine霄 Thunder Obliterates All Methods, Profound Vault Unending Carries the Myriad Heavens"—a trace of an extremely complex expression finally appeared on his dignified and majestic face: shock, greed, and icy killing intent.

"Truly impressive, Xu Yunfan, truly impressive, ninety-nine strands of Golden Nature! To execute such a plan of 'concealing the heavens and crossing the sea' and 'diverting attention to the east,' using causal secret arts and the clone Han Shi to simultaneously attract the favor of three Dao Fruits."

True Lord Qingyuan murmured. With just one glance, he instantly deduced the key points of the matter.

"Wanting to use the chaos of the Bodhi Zen ritual and the牵引 (pull) of the Wansheng Sword Sect to make us True Lords unable to split ourselves, creating the only chance for your main body to ascend to Divine霄? Truly a great scheme! A pity, a pity that I have returned early."

If he had truly been entangled with those three main gods in Aitira, by the time he returned, the matter would have been settled, and there would be no way to turn the tide.

But right now, there was plenty he could do.

In one sentence, he was a Golden Core.

Before Xu Yunfan had attained the Dao Fruit and achieved Golden Core, even if he had the aura of a Golden Core, his foundation was still at the Foundation Establishment stage.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan's main body was beneath the shadow of the Bodhisattva Hui Ri's palm. The pressure of destruction made the space itself solidify.

Although Pudu True Lord had transformed the Self-Royal into Battle.

Wukong's Dao Base Grotto-Heaven had crashed into the Battle-King Buddha Fruit attained through the Dao Fruit, becoming a Bodhisattva.

But he no longer cared about Xu Yunfan.

His objective had already been achieved. The Primordial Origin Sect having one more True Lord is nothing, having one less is even better.

The resources of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World were limited, and the more True Lords that were attained, the stronger the Heavenly Dao's resistance would become.

Pudu True Lord naturally would not offer much more help.

To achieve this scene, and even kindly injected a trace of pure energy to enhance Xu Yunfan, Pudu True Lord felt that he hadn't shown a kind heart in hundreds of years, and had finally encountered a moment of softness.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan's expression was calm to the extreme. His eyes held only the increasingly clear Divine霄 Yuqing Jiuxuan Profound Vault Myriad Transformations Unending Dao Fruit, which was about to descend completely.

The ninety-nine Purple Gold Divine Dragons in his Dantian roared. The imagery of "Obliterating All Methods, Carrying the Myriad Heavens" rapidly solidified within the infinite lightning, transforming into a pillar of thunder that pierced through heaven and earth, pointing directly at the Dao Fruit star high above.

He ignored the Bodhisattva Hui Ri's furious strike, pouring all his mind, all his luck, and the terrifying power accumulated by the ninety-nine strands of indestructible Golden Nature into the ultimate summoning of the Divine霄 Dao Fruit.

"My Way, Divine霄 governs punishment, Profound Vault bears the heavens! The枢机 (pivotal mechanism) of Myriad Transformations, shall be proven today! Dao Fruit, come!!!"

BOOM!

The immense will descending from the Divine霄 Dao Fruit suddenly solidified. A brilliant pillar of light, as thick as a mountain and composed of pure thunder laws, crashed down, instantly tearing through the vast Buddhist light surrounding the Bodhisattva Hui Ri's sky-covering palm.

The pillar of light precisely enveloped Xu Yunfan's main body, completely包裹 (enveloping) him and the imagery of the Profound Vault Unending.

"Seeking death!"

The Bodhisattva Hui Ri's hair and beard flared in anger, and the power of his palm increased by another three points, crushing space as it slammed fiercely onto the pillar of thunder!

THUMP!

A deafening sound that shook the entire Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

Golden Buddhist light and Purple Gold Divine Thunder clashed and annihilated violently. The狂暴 (fierce) energy currents swept through the surroundings, sending countless Dharma protectors flying. The Bodhi Sacred Tree swayed, and the glazed Buddhist light dimmed by several degrees.
