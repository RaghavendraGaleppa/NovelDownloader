# Chapter 36: Huahanying Returns, A Great Feast of Tiger Meat

The weather grew colder by the day. Qingning County was located in the southeast, and every year in mid-October, strong winds and heavy snow were inevitable.

In these past few days.

The estate had distributed cotton-padded jackets. Wearing them kept everyone much warmer.

The morning training was never canceled. Li Xian ran swiftly through the snow, leaving everyone else behind. He finished three laps early but didn't stop there.

His breath was long and steady, his blood and energy showing no fluctuations. Running through the snow felt like moving on flat ground. Suddenly, in an instant, his speed surged, and his strides became even more effortless.

\[Skill: Running\]

\[Proficiency: 1950/3000 Great Mastery\]

\[Description: Running across snow, riding the wind. You have grasped the 'Treading on Snow' trait.\]

The snow was loose and soft, like cotton fluff spread over the ground. Every step sank into it. Because of this, the ground offered no resistance, making running difficult.

It was impossible to speed up.

This was the biggest obstacle to running in the snow.

The 'Treading on Snow' trait treated the snow as a 'slippery surface,' using skillful force with every step.

Instead of compressing the snow, it used its soft properties to glide forward a certain distance. It conserved stamina while increasing speed.

Li Xian's mind focused, and in that instant, his speed increased by a full seventy percent.

"Speaking of running in the snow... even the wild beasts in the mountains probably can't outrun me now."

Inside the estate's main courtyard, Pang Long had someone boil a 'Warming Body Soup.' The guards who returned from the morning run each drank a bowl, and their bodies quickly warmed up.

They then began to practice in the courtyard.

Li Xian's Clear Breeze Legs and Four Directions Fist improved steadily every day.

Just as it approached the hour of Si (9-11 AM).

Pang Long suddenly walked over to everyone with great enthusiasm.

"Hahaha, you guys are in luck. Huahanying hunted a mountain tiger yesterday."

"You're getting a treat. Today, we're having tiger meat. Hehe, this is a rare item. The mountain tiger is the king of the forest beasts. Eating it strengthens your bones and muscles."

Pang Long raised his thick eyebrows and laughed out loud.

His facial features were rough, with large eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and ears, making his expressions very obvious and unable to hide his thoughts.

He was genuinely happy.

"Master Ying? Master Ying is back?"

The guards let out a series of exclamations.

Huahanying was an A-rank guard.

The Mistress owned tens of thousands of acres of fertile land, as well as mulberry fields and tea gardens. Some guards were sent out of the estate to garrison these locations for long periods.

To deter the villains.

"Haha, it seems you all remember me."

As he spoke, a tall man walked out from behind Pang Long with a hearty laugh.

This was Huahanying, truly a top-tier figure among the guards.

His eyebrows were like handsome peaks, full of pride. As he scanned the crowd, he didn't hide his sense of superiority.

"Hanying, you haven't been back for a long time. Why don't you show everyone a thing or two?" Pang Long laughed.

Seeing the guards' admiration, Huahanying was delighted and intended to display his martial arts. He said, "Then I shall make a fool of myself."

He walked to the center of the crowd and assumed a stance.

His martial arts were well-practiced, with a solid foundation. A single move revealed his strength was no small matter.

Suddenly, he leaped into the air and clawed fiercely at the ground. With a 'bang,' snow exploded several zhang high, drawing a chorus of gasps from the crowd.

"Master Ying, I'm in awe!" The guards all cheered.

However, when the crowd looked closely, they were even more terrified.

A patch of snow on the ground was gone, revealing yellowish-brown soil. A burnt smell came from the soil; the inside of the claw marks had been blackened...

"Master Ying, your Fire Eagle Claw is truly formidable."

"If this claw strike landed on a person, the consequences would be unthinkable."

"Master Ying is invincible."

Among the crowd, Li Xian nodded secretly. This claw strike was indeed powerful.

Striking from a high place, it was the strongest besides Pang Long in terms of force, angle, and the use of internal energy.

"I've now mastered the Four Directions Fist, so I can see some of the intricacies."

Li Xian thought to himself.

"Hanying, you've actually trained the Fire Eagle Claw to the Great Mastery level!" Pang Long walked over, patted his shoulder happily, and praised without reservation: "Excellent, excellent!"

"I must thank Commander Pang for his guidance," Huahanying said with a calm smile.

"Have the Mountain Wind Stronghold and the Hongquan Gang made any moves recently?" Pang Long asked as he led Huahanying into a room.

"Hmph, what can a bunch of rabble do?" Huahanying said coldly.

Pang Long didn't care much about hierarchy. He poured tea for Huahanying, sat down casually, and continued:

"That place is a treasure land. The Mistress's medicinal herbs can only grow there. Only you can hold the fort there, and only then can I rest easy."

"Commander Pang, I understand it all," Huahanying said.

"Alright, I have good news for you too," Pang Long raised his eyebrows, extended his hand, and said, "Take a look at what this is."

"Empty..." Huahanying looked for a moment, then his pupils constricted. He saw a wisp of white vapor rising from Pang Long's palm.

This is...

One of the characteristics of the Rebirth Realm, known as 'Immortal Mechanism in the Palm,' meaning that those who can achieve this have vaguely grasped a certain kind of immortal opportunity.

Huahanying's throat moved, his heart churning like rough seas. He trembled and asked, "Could it be... could it be... you..."

"Hahaha, it's still early. It's just a tiny half-step," Pang Long didn't notice Huahanying's anomaly, lost in his own joy.

"Congratulations," Huahanying quickly raised his teacup, took a sip, and let out a slight sigh of relief.

"The tiger meat isn't as delicious as I imagined."

In the Food Pavilion.

The tiger meat was distributed. A-rank guards could eat the tiger's claws, head, heart, and gall. B-rank guards ate the tiger's legs, penis, and back.

C-rank guards ate some miscellaneous meat.

As for D-rank guards, they had to fight for the soup.

Only after the A-rank and B-rank guards had eaten their fill did the C-rank guards enter the pavilion to dine.

Li Xian took a wooden bowl. The chef ladled him a bowl of soup with two large pieces of tiger meat in it.

"Thanks, brother," Li Xian said with a bright smile and walked off with the bowl.

The tiger meat was very tough; anyone with bad teeth would find it hard to chew. The taste was also quite average, with an indescribable fishy smell.

\[You ate cooked tiger meat, 'Consumption' proficiency +5\]

But it was indeed a great tonic.

For Li Xian's fifteen-year-old body, eating this kind of beast meat could quickly make up for previous deficiencies.

The more he ate, the brighter his eyes became. His body was nourished, and with a full stomach and strength, everything he did would be twice as effective with half the effort.

After the meal, Li Xian drank the soup clean, took a large white steamed bun to wipe the bowl clean, leaving not a single scrap behind.

"Can I have another bowl?"

Li Xian thickened his face.

"You kid... fine," the kitchen staff hesitated for a moment, then ladled another bowl of soup for Li Xian, along with a fist-sized piece of tiger bone.

There was bone marrow inside the tiger bone, a milky white gelatinous substance that had been boiled off the bone. With a strong suck, it all went into his stomach.

\[Sucked tiger marrow, strengthened blood and energy, nourished the physique, 'Consumption' proficiency +6\]

This mouthful was truly the essence of essences.

After eating and drinking everything clean again, Li Xian's body radiated waves of heat. Endless 'internal energy' was generated inside him, gathering in his dantian.

"It's the 'Consumption' trait enhancing the effect, helping me absorb it faster and more. Also... I previously had poor nutrition, so the internal energy I cultivated couldn't proliferate."

"Now that I've had a big meal of tiger soup and meat... making up for the previous deficit, has the internal energy returned?"

In the time it took for this meal, his internal energy had actually increased by thirty percent.

It seemed his eyesight and hearing had also become sharper.
