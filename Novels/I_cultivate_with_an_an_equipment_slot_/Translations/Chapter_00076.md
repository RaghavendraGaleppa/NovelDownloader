...  

Zhang Yan stared at the token in his hand, unable to calm his racing heart.  

This was the first time he had seen an artifact with so many attributes—and most puzzling of all, many of them were duplicates.  

"Why is this?" Zhang Yan couldn't understand.  

The Thunderflame Token already had a "Mastered" level for the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art, so why were there also "Minor Mastery" entries? Not just one, but multiple.  

"Could it be that each attribute represents a different understanding?" A vague suspicion formed in Zhang Yan's mind.  

But now wasn't the time to test it. He would have to wait until he returned.  

"Thank you, Elder Lei." After bowing in gratitude, Zhang Yan took the token and left without delay.  

Only Lei Kunhai and Lei Wanbao remained in the cavern.  

"Ancestor, you—" Lei Wanbao stared at Lei Kunhai, his face filled with shock.  

He never expected Lei Kunhai to hand over the Thunderflame Token to Zhang Yan so quickly!  

Though he had long known that Lei Kunhai intended to nurture Zhang Yan, this was far too sudden! They had only known each other for a few days!  

The Thunderflame Token and the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art were the closely guarded secrets of Thousand Treasures Peak!  

Even Lei Wanbao himself had struggled immensely when he first learned the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art.  

And now?  

Lei Kunhai had given it away so casually.  

Lei Wanbao felt bitter inside.  

"Shut your mouth!" Lei Kunhai glared at him. "If you weren’t so useless, would I need to find someone else to inherit it?"  

At those words, Lei Wanbao immediately fell silent. If he said any more, all the blame would fall on him.  

---  

Meanwhile, Zhang Yan left Thousand Treasures Peak and headed straight for the Scripture Pavilion.  

"Hmm? The Thunderflame Token?"  

The two Daoist guardians at the entrance of the Scripture Pavilion were visibly startled when they saw the token in Zhang Yan’s hand.  

One of them clicked his tongue in amazement. "Incredible. Elder Lei actually gave you the Thunderflame Token to learn the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art."  

"Enough, enough. Don’t talk nonsense, or Elder Lei might come and beat you up," the other Daoist nudged him.  

"Go ahead and exchange for it. But the original stele for the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art is special—you can only make a single copy to take with you," the Daoist explained as he led Zhang Yan inside.  

They located the original stele for the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art, and the Daoist helped Zhang Yan make a copy.  

---  

With the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art in hand, Zhang Yan returned to his cave abode.  

After discussing recent events with Liu Yiting, he equipped the Thunderflame Token into his gear slot.  

The moment it was equipped, Zhang Yan felt a sudden clarity in his mind, followed by a flood of insights.  

As he slowly digested these insights, he realized something remarkable.  

Each insight corresponded to a different person’s understanding of the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art.  

Because each person’s comprehension varied, the token had accumulated so many different attributes.  

"Different people understand it differently—some might be correct, some might be wrong, or perhaps each person grasps a different aspect."  

Zhang Yan pondered.  

If the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art were compared to a beautiful woman, each person would paint her based on their memory after a single glance.  

Those with clearer memories would paint more accurately, while those with vague impressions would produce blurrier images.  

This was the difference between "Mastered" and "Minor Mastery."  

But if he used one "Mastered" version as a foundation and supplemented it with the others, he could reconstruct the original—the true "Mastered" state.  

The realization excited him.  

"So, to cultivate something to perfection, I don’t necessarily need to find a 'Perfected' attribute. A large number of inferior attributes can serve the same purpose—it’s just more tedious."  

This discovery thrilled him. If this was the case, his future cultivation would become much easier.  

"And the Thunderflame Token has so many attributes! But this one seems the most outstanding." Zhang Yan singled out a "Mastered" attribute of the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art.  

He decided to use this as his foundation and fill in the gaps with the others.  

As he carefully studied the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art, he couldn’t help but marvel at its ingenuity.  

Whoever created this technique had truly bold ideas.  

The Thunderflame Body Tempering Art required drawing heavenly thunderflame into the body to temper it.  

Just reading about it sent a chill down Zhang Yan’s spine.  

One misstep, and he’d be blown to pieces!  

No wonder the manual stated that the minimum requirement for cultivation was the late Qi Refining stage, along with various elixirs and magical artifacts for support.  

"But what does that have to do with me, Zhang Yan?"  

He clearly remembered that the Thunderflame Token had a "Thunderflame" attribute.  

This meant he could use the token to temper his body directly.  

However, there was no need to rush. He still needed to thoroughly study the technique and prepare the necessary materials.  

Besides, there was something else he needed to attend to—his spirit plant cultivation.  

His efforts were nearing completion.  

Thanks to the "Grafting" technique, ten second-grade spirit plants had already sprouted new shoots.  

The only remaining challenge was the single Clearheart Lotus.  

Though the lotus hadn’t died, it was only surviving due to Zhang Yan’s constant application of the Rain Summoning Art and Wood Element Technique.  

Without him, it would perish.  

Following the method Elder Weng had taught him, Zhang Yan decided to use "Grafting" on it.  

Though this would lower the Clearheart Lotus’s quality, it would ensure survival and increase yield—a worthwhile trade-off.  

---  

Another month passed.  

During this time, Zhang Yan spent his days farming, forging, and studying the Thunderflame Body Tempering Art.  

By now, he had achieved minor proficiency in artifact forging—a fact that nearly drove Lei Wanbao to despair.  

Every time Lei Kunhai saw Zhang Yan’s progress, he had to clench his fists to maintain his composure.  

But more importantly, Zhang Yan’s spirit plant cultivation was finally complete.  

"It’s time to complete the mission."  

After being bathed, perfumed, and dressed in fresh robes by Liu Yiting, Zhang Yan made his way to Wood Spirit Peak.  

The moment he entered, a terrifying aura erupted from the peak, shaking the entire sect.
