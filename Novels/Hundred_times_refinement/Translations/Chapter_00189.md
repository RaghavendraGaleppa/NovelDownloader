# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb - Chapter 137: Demonic Heaven City  

For ordinary mortals, five years is no short span of time. But on the long path of immortality, it passes in the blink of an eye for cultivators.  

With the aid of countless spirit pills and relentless effort, Lin Xuan's cultivation had reached the second layer of the Foundation Establishment stage—the peak of the second layer, to be precise.  

The "Nine Heavens Profound Art" Lin Xuan practiced was immensely powerful, divided into three parts: upper, middle, and lower, each suited for Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, and Nascent Soul stage cultivators, respectively.  

Coincidentally or not, each part was further divided into seven layers, perfectly corresponding to the seven layers of each cultivation realm.  

For instance, since Lin Xuan was now at the second layer of Foundation Establishment, he naturally practiced the second layer of the upper part of the Nine Heavens Profound Art.  

Once he mastered the third layer of the upper part, his cultivation would advance to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.  

The correspondence was clear and straightforward, and the art's power was extraordinary, standing out even among top-tier techniques. This meant Lin Xuan, who practiced the Nine Heavens Profound Art, would surpass cultivators of the same level in strength.  

For cultivators of the same realm, disregarding factors like magical treasures, pills, and spirit stones, their relative strength depended on the cultivation technique they practiced.  

Take Ouyang Qinxin, for example. The soundwave technique she cultivated was a renowned top-tier art. Despite being only at the early Core Formation stage, she could hold her own against mid-Core Formation demonic cultivators—all thanks to her technique.  

Beyond its power, Lin Xuan discovered another benefit of the Nine Heavens Profound Art: an astonishing youth-preserving effect. He had entered Foundation Establishment at twenty and began practicing this art. Now, five years later, his appearance remained unchanged, exactly as it had been at twenty.  

After settling his affairs, Lin Xuan sealed his cave abode, temporarily refusing all visitors.  

From that day onward, he would strive to break through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.  

With the aid of spirit pills, his chances of success were high. After all, advancing a single layer in his technique was far easier than ascending an entire cultivation stage.  

---  

Three months later, Lin Xuan emerged from seclusion. The breakthrough had gone even more smoothly than expected.  

Clenching his fist, he felt deeply satisfied with his progress. At twenty-five, he had reached mid-Foundation Establishment. At this rate, forming a Golden Core in the future was not beyond reach.  

A flicker of fervent ambition flashed in Lin Xuan's eyes, but he soon fell into contemplation. Truthfully, he had not intended to leave seclusion yet and would have preferred to continue cultivating. However, an urgent matter demanded his attention.  

Over the past five years, aside from his own progress, Yue'er had also advanced rapidly in her cultivation.  

This delighted Lin Xuan, but it also presented a problem. The ghost-path cultivation manual he had given her was something he had stumbled upon by chance—a crude and rudimentary text.  

Now that Lin Yue'er had reached the early Foundation Establishment stage, she had exhausted that manual and needed a new technique.  

Though Lin Xuan possessed several Foundation Establishment-level techniques, Yue'er, as a spectral entity, could only follow the ghost-path. Ordinary cultivation methods were useless to her.  

Thus, Lin Xuan had no choice but to suspend his seclusion. After all, forming a Golden Core was a long road ahead. For now, helping Yue'er advance would be a more immediate boost to his own strength.  

After careful consideration, Lin Xuan decided to make a trip to Demonic Heaven City.  

As the name suggested, Demonic Heaven City was a gathering place for demonic cultivators.  

In Youzhou, though demonic cultivators were not as powerful as orthodox immortal cultivators, their sects and lone practitioners were far from few—such as the Extreme Demon Cave, the Ghost Fiend Sect, the Heavenly Slaughter Cult, and others.  

Most of these sects were concentrated in northern Youzhou, in a place called Demonic Heaven City.  

The ghost-path was, in fact, a branch of demonic cultivation. Thus, if Lin Xuan wanted to find a suitable technique for Yue'er, the markets of Demonic Heaven City were his only option.  

Once decided, Lin Xuan packed his belongings and set off.  

---  

Two days later, Lin Xuan arrived before a vast forest. Descending from his flight, he surveyed his surroundings.  

This forest was the only route to Demonic Heaven City.  

However, this was no ordinary mortal forest—it teemed with demonic beasts.  

Fortunately, skirting the forest's edge would suffice. The beasts lurking on the periphery were mostly first-tier, posing little threat to someone of his strength.  

After assessing the situation, Lin Xuan flew forward without hesitation.  

Along the way, he occasionally encountered a few demonic cultivators. They glanced at him but paid no further attention, diving straight into the forest—likely to hunt demonic beasts for spirit stones.  

Perhaps because of this, Lin Xuan encountered no attacks and arrived at his destination without incident.  

The city before him sprawled wide, its walls built of sturdy granite and faintly exuding spiritual energy—evidence of some protective formation.  

Suddenly, Lin Xuan narrowed his eyes as two streaks of light approached him.  

"Greetings, fellow Daoist!"  

A young scholar in white robes clasped his hands in salute. Beside him stood a woman in red robes, their intimate demeanor marking them as cultivation partners.  

Lin Xuan returned the gesture but remained aloof. "What brings you two here?"  

The scholar, undeterred, smiled warmly. "Brother, are you also heading to Demonic Heaven City? How about we travel together?"  

Having anticipated this, Lin Xuan shook his head. "My apologies. I'm accustomed to solitude and prefer to journey alone."  

The scholar blinked, seemingly surprised by the refusal. "Brother, is this your first time visiting Demonic Heaven City? Surely you know it's dangerous for orthodox cultivators here. Traveling together ensures mutual support."  

Contrary to popular belief, orthodox and demonic cultivators were not mortal enemies. Self-interest ruled the cultivation world, and notions of righteousness were mere child's play.  

Yet, their relationship was undeniably strained, marked by mutual disdain.  

Thus, orthodox cultivators venturing alone into Demonic Heaven City faced considerable risk.  

High-level cultivators at the Core Formation stage and above could afford to be indifferent—few demonic cultivators would provoke them needlessly.  

But for those at the Qi Condensation or Foundation Establishment stages, the story was different. Many low-level orthodox cultivators had met their end in Demonic Heaven City under flimsy pretexts.  

Despite this, the city's markets—though not the largest in Youzhou—often featured rare goods unavailable elsewhere, drawing orthodox cultivators in droves.  

Naturally, they had grown wiser. No one wished to die for nothing.  

Orthodox cultivators visiting the city fell into several categories:  

High-level Core Formation cultivators had nothing to fear, so long as they avoided trouble.  

Group expeditions from sects, even without high-level leaders, were safe—a dozen or so Foundation Establishment cultivators traveling together deterred most threats.  

After all, attacking them would be arduous and tantamount to declaring war on their sect. Demonic cultivators might disdain orthodox ones, but they weren't foolish enough to court disaster.  

The truly vulnerable were the lone wanderers—those without sect backing. If they perished in Demonic Heaven City, no one would seek justice for them.  

Thus, lone orthodox cultivators rarely visited. When necessity forced their hand, they usually banded together for safety.  

The white-robed scholar and his wife were such a case. They needed an item only available in Demonic Heaven City but, as lone cultivators, dared not venture in alone. Having heard tales of the city's dangers, they had waited for another orthodox cultivator to join—only for Lin Xuan to reject them outright.  

The scholar, still hoping Lin Xuan was unaware of the risks, tried to explain, but Lin Xuan remained politely firm.  

"Husband, leave him be. If he refuses our goodwill, he'll regret it soon enough," the red-robed woman snapped, her temper flaring.  

The scholar sighed. Facing a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator, he was reluctant to give up. But seeing Lin Xuan's resolve, he hesitated before handing him a talisman.  

"My wife and I will be lodging nearby. If you change your mind, you can contact us with this messenger talisman."  

Lin Xuan accepted it with a nod.  

"Let's go, husband. Why waste words on him?"  

The woman huffed and flew off. The scholar offered an awkward salute before following.  

Only after they vanished did a faint smile touch Lin Xuan's lips.  

Their offer hadn't necessarily been altruistic—mutual benefit was likely their aim. But for him, it was entirely unnecessary.  

After a moment's hesitation, Lin Xuan stored the talisman in his storage bracelet rather than discarding it.
