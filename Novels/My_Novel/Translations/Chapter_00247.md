Chapter 247: A Test of Will

The wind howled and the river roared beneath a gloomy sky.

Wen Caishang’s slender fingers kneaded gently. Her mind wandered; in all her life, she had never massaged a man’s shoulders. Li Xian said, "Harder."

A moment later, he added, "Softer." He was fastidious and demanding, creating a strange reversal of the days in the One Union Manor when he had served her.

Wen Caishang pressed her red lips together, her expression peculiar. Li Xian said sternly, "If you don't serve me well, I won't let you eat." He thought to himself, *I must take advantage of this opportunity to enjoy myself. Let the Madam taste this feeling too.* He had no restraint.

"Enough!"

A martial artist a few yards away slammed the table and stood up, roaring, "Kid, don't push your luck!"

"Lady, this rascal knows no chivalry to bully you like this. Rest assured, I cannot stand such villains."

"If you are willing, please... come eat at my table."

Wen Caishang smiled, her enchanting charm causing the men to daze. Li Xian cupped his fists and said, "Good sirs, it is virtuous to stand up for justice. However, this is a domestic affair between us. Whether we fight or make peace is none of your business. It was a misunderstanding, let it be resolved here so everyone can be at peace!"

He spoke with grace. Li Xian pulled Wen Caishang close, touching her intimately, lips brushing lips. He said, "We are deeply in love. It is not that I treat her poorly; she simply prefers it this way. Good sirs, you may rest assured."

He then sat back down. Hearing the phrase "prefers it this way," Wen Caishang knew Li Xian was playing a trick. She was angry for a moment but did not argue.

The big man looked grim and said, "Good lady, do not be afraid. If you are being coerced, please speak up. We will surely stand up for you!"

Li Xian said impatiently, "Brother, you are meddling too much."

The big man said, "Hmph! The martial world is treacherous. If you commit crimes, I, Zuo Yilong, will never let you off!"

The other martial artists agreed. They were famous martial artists from the surrounding area of the Wei Tiger River.

Li Xian did not want trouble. Wen Caishang weighed the benefits and felt the same. She said, "What is between me and Li Lang, how can you judge? I enjoy serving him."

The heroes looked at each other, feeling indignant. It turned out that "standing up for justice" was fake, while "lust" was the truth. Zuo Yilong sat down helplessly, took a few sips of wine, and held back his anger.

He thought, *I, Zuo Yilong, cannot swallow this insult. This guy is too arrogant. I need to find a reason to mess with him.*

He suddenly stood up again and shouted, "Kid! You look familiar. Aren't you the criminal on the Red List!"

At that time, information was scarce, and "heroes" in the martial world were mostly self-proclaimed. They could pick a fight with any flimsy excuse. If they won, they would naturally claim to be "enforcing justice for heaven." Li Xian said coldly, "I have tolerated you for a long time. How dare you frame me? Die!"

He picked up two pieces of beef and flung them out. They shot directly into Zuo Yilong’s mouth, hitting his throat and destroying his vocal cords. Then he threw the chopsticks, piercing both wrists and nailing them to the wall.

Li Xian’s display stunned the others. Among the passengers waiting for the boat, few were true experts. No one dared to speak anymore and they retreated outside the hall.

The two ate and drank, savoring the delicacies. Li Xian said, "We just need to wait for the ship. We will take the water route. The paths are complex; no matter how many men they have, it will be useless. Madam, please serve me."

Wen Caishang said softly, "Alright, I will serve you well." She was gentle as water, massaging Li Xian’s shoulders again. Wen Caishang thought, *I am plagued by bad luck; can it really be this smooth?* She felt a bit worried and said, "If we encounter an accident, do you have an escape plan?"

Li Xian said, "How can there be a perfect plan in the world? It depends on the size of the accident... Madam, do you think this trip won't go smoothly?" Wen Caishang nodded and said, "I am restless. Perhaps... it is going to rain!"

The sky was gloomy, as if thunder was gathering. A storm was brewing...

Li Xian laughed and said, "Don't think too much. Please help me by massaging my legs, Madam." Wen Caishang laughed helplessly and said, "You... you are getting used to ordering me around. Does... does ordering me around like this make you happier?"

But she did as she was told.

Around evening, the sky darkened. With a thunderclap, a heavy rain began to fall. Li Xian thought, *The dark clouds have been gathering for days and finally burst. The rain is really heavy!*

The spray was dense. Travelers from all directions waited in the dining hall as rain dripped from the eaves. The mist on the river surface offered a unique aesthetic.

The doors and windows were closed. It was dark, so the shopkeeper lit candles and fixed them on the tables.

They waited quietly for the ship.

As the hour of Yin approached, a large ship drew near and docked by the pier. The waiting passengers took umbrellas and boarded. Wen Caishang held her long skirt; her clothes had long been changed to cloth. Drenched by the rain, they were naturally wet. After a few steps, her boots and the hem of her skirt were stained.

Boarding the ferry, she felt slightly relieved. The ship swayed and was very cramped, but since they were escaping for their lives, they didn't ask for comfort. Around the second quarter of the hour of Yin, the rain eased. Although it didn't stop, it no longer hindered the ship's progress. They raised the anchor and steered the rudder, moving along the river.

Li Xian muttered, "Merging into the river, the world is vast. Where will they find us?" He breathed a slight sigh of relief. Suddenly, he heard a clamor on the deck...

Li Xian braved the rain to the deck. More than ten fellow passengers had gathered, all looking at the riverbank. At one spot on the riverbank, a tiger roar shook the sky... dozens, hundreds, thousands... even ten thousand tigers gathered.

Li Xian saw the scene and quickly called Wen Caishang to look. They were both curious: "Tigers are kings of the forest. Usually, two tigers cannot share a mountain. Why are so many fierce tigers gathering here?"

Hundreds of tigers roared together, like rolling thunder, rising and falling one after another. Suddenly, someone shouted, "They are coming!"

They saw countless tigers jump into the river with a "splash." The "tiger waves" rolled; this scene was truly unheard of.

A tiger that just entered the river wailed a few times, was swept away by the waves, sank to the bottom, and was carried away by the current.

The rain was heavy, the wind strong, and the waves muddy. This scene was no less spectacular than a "flood dragon walking on water." With the众 tigers rushing into the river, looking out, the river was black with tigers.

"Bad! Turn the rudder and go back!" a crew member shouted. The ship shook violently...

It had been scratched by a few tigers at the bottom of the river, flailing blindly and tearing the hull! As the waves rolled, hundreds of tigers were pushed to the side of the ship.

Seeing a life-saving straw, the tigers swam desperately toward the ship. Their sharp claws hooked the planks, and they climbed into the ship. Li Xian frowned, drew his bow, and shot several tigers down.

However, a thousand horses and ten thousand tigers were like a rolling river. The tigers on the distant mountains were endless, pouring into the river... The momentum was vast, and human strength was difficult to stop.

Li Xian sighed: "There are too many wonders in this world, and too many obstacles!"

The helmsman panicked and could only return the way they came, docking at the shore. After Li Xian and Wen Caishang got off the ship, they immediately asked the manager: "With this situation, when can we sail again?"

The manager said: "You are very unlucky! The ship is damaged; it will be hard to sail for a few days."

Li Xian and Wen Caishang exchanged a look. Wen Caishang sighed softly and had to accept it. Li Xian comforted her: "We will walk along the river and find another shipyard."

Wen Caishang said: "It has to be this way." Shipyards do not refund money. Li Xian didn't want to argue and walked out into the rain overnight.

He cut two lotus leaves and walked closely under them. Li Xian lamented: "When you are unlucky, even drinking water will choke you!"

In fact... Heaven is fair. The Earth Essence has been unheard of for hundreds of years; how precious is it? If it were obtained openly and fairly, one would not be plagued by bad luck. To plot for the Earth Essence is to damage one's own luck.

There are many obstacles... naturally, there are many. But precisely because of this, one can see how great Wen Caishang's gain was. The rain gradually thinned, but it dripped incessantly, wet and sticky, likely to last a long time.

The next morning.

A howl came from the river... The Tiger Sect and the Elephant Sect were riding boats, fishing up tiger corpses from the river. Thousands, tens of thousands. With a sweep of an iron net, several tiger corpses were hauled up.

If a tiger still had a breath of life. The Tiger Sect would be overjoyed, feeding it the "Tiger Saliva Green Blood Dew." They intercepted its vitality and stimulated its heart. If it survived three days, it would transform into a "River-Turning Strange Tiger," with a huge body, capable of turning rivers and dancing waves, very fierce and powerful.

If the tiger was dead, they would skin it and remove its bones... The uses were wide: refining medicine, making leather, making weapons, boiling pills... One tiger could bring considerable profit.

Why is the Tiger Sect's "Tiger Saliva Green Blood Pill" so effective in healing heart wounds and intercepting vitality? It is because of the timing, location, and situation. If the efficacy is off, the "River-Turning Tigers" would all become "Sunken River Tigers."

Wen Caishang said: "For a sect to stand, it needs a stable industry. Last night, the tigers jumping into the river brought countless silver and gold into the water. Now the silver sinks temporarily, and the gold floats up. They sift through the big waves to find gold, returning with full loads."

Drowned tigers, numbering in the tens of thousands, mostly sank into the river. It would take a few days for the tiger corpses to swell and float on the water surface. By then... people from the surrounding towns would enter the river to salvage the corpses for money.

"The world is bustling, all for profit..." Seeing more, Li Xian suddenly felt: *No wonder the Madam values profit. Looking around, who does not value profit? I also value profit, but in this life, one cannot value only profit.*

Li Xian asked: "Why is the Elephant Sect also picking up tiger corpses?"

Wen Caishang said: "The Elephant Sect can also sell tiger corpses for money. And... if they find a live tiger with a breath left. The Elephant Sect will kill it immediately, so the Tiger Sect doesn't get an extra River-Turning Tiger. The conflict between the two sects will last for a hundred generations!"

They passed another shipyard. After inquiring, they learned that because the Tiger Sect and the Elephant Sect were picking up corpses in the river, the shipyard had mostly stopped operations to avoid trouble.

Because of this, Li Xian and Wen Caishang's water route plan was greatly delayed. Li Xian pondered: "Wait a few more days... Su Qiuwu and the others, even if they are stupid, will have found us by now! The current situation is truly bad!"

Li Xian forced himself to stay calm and continued walking along the river. After walking for another day or so, visiting several shipyards, the answers were all the same.

The third day.

Li Xian gained nothing and had to make a decision. He stopped visiting the riverbanks and decided to change his route.

Li Xian wanted to buy a map and re-plan the route. The two walked for half a day and saw a large city. They entered the city quietly and suddenly felt the movements in the city were strange. There were many people with martial arts skills, and several people were looking around intentionally or unintentionally.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang tried to hide their tracks. They were very low-key, but they were still looked at a few times. Fortunately, they were not recognized. Li Xian felt a warning and immediately knew that the pursuers were close!

He turned into an alley to hide. He glanced at the entrance of an inn where several swordsmen with backswords were renting rooms.

Wen Caishang said solemnly: "It is the Infinite Sword Gate."

"Shi Luo Village!"

On the street in the distance, several dried corpses stood still.

The Yellow Sand Gate, the Infinite Sword Gate, the Tai Heart Sect, the Sword Rain Tower, the Shi Luo Village... They had completely formed a siege.

Their figures could be seen everywhere in the surrounding cities. The encirclement was strict, the pressure tight, the momentum fierce, and the situation urgent like never before.

Li Xian observed secretly. The Red List was posted on the streets and alleys. People were discussing the two of them at the ends of the streets.

The martial artists who answered the "Red List" pursuit to kill Li Xian and Wen Caishang were numerous.

There was no way to heaven, nor a door to earth!

(There are readers who hope for a faster pace.

I am trying my best, but it is hard to go faster.

Each chapter covers a lot of plot. The scene of tigers jumping into the river, the underlying operations of the Tiger Sect, the hunt and chase, emotional changes... If these are simplified or cut, I don't know how you readers would feel, but for me, writing it would become tasteless.

Also, regarding the issue of the plot dragging, this section does have a lot of ink. But it concerns the emotional transformation between Li Xian and Wen Caishang. So I am polishing it slowly.)
