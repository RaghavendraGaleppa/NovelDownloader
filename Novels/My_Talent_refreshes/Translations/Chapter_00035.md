# Chapter 35: Monthly Subscription

Chu Ning walked a short distance and soon arrived at Zhuang Yunde's residence.

"Junior Brother Chu is here? Coming to submit your talisman papers?" Zhuang Yunde warmly welcomed Chu Ning into the courtyard.

Instead of immediately asking about Mu Ling, Chu Ning first took out the batch of talisman papers he needed to submit to the sect.

Zhuang Yunde accepted the bundle from Chu Ning, carefully examined them, counted them, then nodded with a smile. "Excellent quality, and exactly 3,500 sheets. Well done, Junior Brother Chu has fulfilled this season's quota."

His next words, however, caught Chu Ning completely off guard. "Did you happen to meet Junior Sister Mu Ling on your way here?"

"Senior Brother Zhuang, you knew about this?"

Zhuang Yunde chuckled. "Let me first explain Junior Sister Mu Ling's situation. She's a junior relative of Elder Mu, who is one of the few Golden Core stage elders in our sect."

"Golden Core elder?" Chu Ning inhaled sharply. With just this statement, Zhuang Yunde had made clear Elder Mu's status.

Golden Core elders were completely different from Elder Chen who had brought them into the sect. Elder Chen was at the Foundation Establishment stage and merely an instructor in the Teaching Hall. But Golden Core elders were pillars of the sect, the strongest combat force of Qingxi Sect. From previous conversations with Zhuang Yunde, Chu Ning knew there were only four such elders in the sect.

"Then why is she in the Hundred Arts Hall?" Chu Ning asked, slightly puzzled. As a Golden Core elder's junior, entering the inner sect would have been effortless.

"She actually started in the inner sect," Zhuang Yunde explained. "But Junior Sister Mu Ling's talent truly isn't remarkable. After several years of slow progress in cultivation, she lost interest in the path of cultivation and became fascinated with other arts—specifically talisman-making."

At this point, Zhuang Yunde shook his head. "However, her talent for talisman-making is equally mediocre, with a low success rate. Yet she persists in making talismans obsessively, wasting large quantities of talisman paper with poor results. When Elder Mu learned of this, he ordered the hall to ration her talisman paper supply to encourage her to focus on proper study."

Chu Ning's expression turned slightly peculiar upon hearing this. He couldn't quite imagine how abysmal Mu Ling's success rate must be, nor how much she must have practiced, for the Hundred Arts Hall to actually ration her paper.

Zhuang Yunde continued, "Later she turned to buying talisman paper from the market. But recently Elder Mu went on a journey, and because Junior Sister Mu Ling caused some trouble outside, she's been placed under house arrest and can't go out to buy more."

Now understanding the situation better, Chu Ning asked, "So Senior Brother Zhuang told her about my talisman paper production?"

Zhuang Yunde's small eyes twinkled with amusement. "I considered it a mutually beneficial arrangement. You know the sect pays 55 sheets per spirit stone for returned talisman paper, and the market price is even lower. I assume Junior Brother didn't sell to her at that rate?"

"She offered one lower-grade spirit stone for 50 sheets." As he spoke, Chu Ning took out eleven spirit stones from his robe and handed them to Zhuang Yunde.

Accepting them smoothly, Zhuang Yunde's eyes crinkled further with satisfaction. "You see? With just a few words, I earned an extra spirit stone, and Junior Brother earned several more. Why not take the opportunity? If you have more talisman paper, you could continue selling to her."

Chu Ning sighed and shook his head. "I brought all my finished papers today. She bought my entire personal stock of over a thousand sheets too."

"No hurry, there's always next season," Zhuang Yunde said with an innocent expression. "With this batch of practice, Junior Brother will surely improve and be able to earn even more spirit stones next time."

Taking the hint, Chu Ning immediately clasped his hands respectfully. "Thanks to Senior Brother's guidance. If I do make progress, I certainly won't forget your mentorship."

Zhuang Yunde beamed at this response. After some more casual conversation, Chu Ning took his leave.

"Junior Brother Chu!" He had only walked a short distance when Mu Ling appeared again.

"Senior Sister Mu!" Chu Ning's tone grew even more polite.

Mu Ling jogged up to him. "Now that you know who I am, I'd like to ask for your help with something."

Chu Ning felt a headache coming on. Knowing Mu Ling's powerful background, his first instinct was to keep his distance. She seemed like nothing but trouble, and with her backing, offending her wasn't an option.

He replied tactfully, "I'm just an outer disciple. I'm afraid I can't be of much help."

"This is something you can definitely help with," Mu Ling said, either ignoring or missing his reluctance. "I just need you to buy a thousand sheets of talisman paper for me every month. I'll provide the spirit stones, pay you a service fee, and even give you this storage pouch."

Chu Ning eyed her suspiciously. "That's all?"

"That's all!" Mu Ling nodded emphatically. "Buying a thousand sheets monthly from the market would be tedious—probably requiring visits to multiple shops, maybe several trips if they don't have enough stock at once."

Waving the storage pouch enticingly, she added, "But no problem! I'll give you a ten percent commission each time."

Chu Ning's interest was piqued—this sounded like a windfall. Purchasing a thousand sheets monthly was nothing; he still had several thousand in his own stock. Yet he remained wary of such good fortune falling into his lap.

"Why me?" he asked.

Mu Ling explained readily, "Since you make talisman paper yourself, you can judge quality reliably. Other disciples in the Hundred Arts Hall could too, but they're all busy and might not go to the market monthly. Outside disciples can't enter here freely either. You're the perfect choice."

Considering her explanation alongside Zhuang Yunde's description of Mu Ling's personality, Chu Ning was mostly convinced. Putting on a slightly reluctant expression, he said, "Since Senior Sister thinks so highly of me, I'll handle this errand for you."

Delighted, Mu Ling immediately handed him the storage pouch. "Take this then. There are twenty-two spirit stones inside—twenty for the paper, two as your fee. Just deliver the papers to me this time next month."

Without waiting for further response, she turned and hurried off. "Ah, I need to go practice talisman-making!"

Leaving Chu Ning standing alone, slightly bewildered.

Well... it seemed he'd been hired on a monthly retainer?
