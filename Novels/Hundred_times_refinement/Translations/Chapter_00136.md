Chapter 86: Spirit Medicine

After Lin Xuan left, a beam of light descended from the sky, and three Fire Spirit Gate cultivators emerged.

"Senior Brother, the person's trail disappeared here," said a young cultivator in his early twenties, with starry eyes and a youthful appearance, yet his cultivation had reached the late stage of the sixth layer.

"We must be cautious. Jin and Chen, the two junior brothers, were not weak, yet they were simultaneously poisoned by that person. He's not an ordinary rogue cultivator."

"So what if he's not? From the state of their corpses, it's clear they were ambushed."

"Regardless, being cautious won't hurt."

From their conversation, it was clear that the three had discovered the unfortunate cultivators' corpses, which Lin Xuan had eliminated. They had somehow tracked the location to this place.

"He must have crossed the river. Let's chase after him!" One of the cultivators, who had been silent until now, spoke up, his voice filled with impatience. Without waiting for his fellow disciples to respond, he activated his flying talisman and flew towards the opposite bank of the river.

"Wait, Junior Brother!" The senior brother, Wan, was taken aback. Although he didn't have Lin Xuan's vast experience and didn't recognize the Blood Demon Beast, the blood-colored mist floating above the river was clearly not a good omen. He wanted to observe for a while before deciding what to do, but his junior brother had already acted rashly.

By the time Wan wanted to warn his junior brother to be careful, it was too late. The blood-colored mist suddenly churned, sensing prey entering its domain. The Blood Demon Beast wouldn't be polite; it condensed blood-colored threads and stabbed towards the junior brother.

The impatient cultivator was startled, of course, and wouldn't sit idly by. He slapped his left wrist, activating a small talisman that turned into a pale blue light shield, enveloping his body.

It was a rare high-grade defensive talisman!

The blood-colored threads struck the light shield, causing it to tremble, but they couldn't break it. The young cultivator had just breathed a sigh of relief when his face turned white as paper.

The threads suddenly entwined, forming a giant python shape, and wrapped around the light shield.

Witnessing this shocking scene, not only did the cultivator trapped in the blood mist feel uneasy, but his two companions were also horrified.

In an emergency, the two didn't have time to think; "Junior Brother, don't panic, I'll help you!"

Both Fire Spirit Gate disciples activated their spiritual tools; one wielded a two-meter-long iron whip, and the other unleashed a gray misty sword.

Although the quality of their tools was only low-grade, as Spirit Resonance period cultivators, having such treasures was already enviable.

The power of spiritual tools was not to be underestimated, and the demon beast didn't dare be careless. The blood mist transformed into giant pythons, entangling with the two cultivators.

The trapped cultivator didn't sit idly by either; he pulled out several talismans from his storage and threw them towards the center of the blood mist.

In an instant, spiritual tools clashed, blood-colored mist churned, and explosions echoed. The demon beast and the three cultivators fought fiercely.

On the other side of the riverbank, Lin Xuan slowly withdrew his gaze, a mocking smile on his lips. The three who had been tracking him were destined to fall here.

The Blood Demon Beast's strength was not to be underestimated; only Foundation Establishment period cultivators could defeat it. Spirit Resonance period cultivators, unless they had numerous treasures like Lin Xuan, would become its prey.

It was good to let the demon beast eliminate these annoying followers, making it less likely to arouse suspicion.

However, he needed to hurry; he had to obtain the two spirit herbs as soon as possible. Otherwise, if a Foundation Establishment period expert arrived, the Blood Demon Beast wouldn't be able to withstand it.

Thinking this, Lin Xuan turned and quickened his pace, remaining vigilant. Besides his spiritual shield, he activated the Golden Rope, rotating it around his body. Although it wasn't a defensive spiritual tool, it provided some protection to its user.

Currently, Lin Xuan had many offensive means but lacked defensive treasures. Besides his basic spiritual shield, he had a few defensive talismans sealed with mid-grade spells, acquired from the Dao Symbol Mountain.

Talismans were one-time use, and Lin Xuan didn't want to waste them without a clear enemy in sight.

He expanded his spiritual sense and heightened his vigilance.

An hour later, Lin Xuan arrived at the foot of a small hill. The hill wasn't tall, but it stood alone, majestic. From below, Lin Xuan smelled a fragrance that was refreshing and soothing.

The scent matched the descriptions of the Silver Moon Flower and the Glow Grass in the books. Lin Xuan's face lit up with joy; he had finally found them, and from the intensity of the fragrance, the herbs were at the peak of maturity.

Not wanting to linger, Lin Xuan followed the scent to a giant rock halfway up the hill.

Two peculiar plants grew beside the rock.

One plant was only a few inches tall, with a uniquely shaped flower, curved like a moon. The other plant was slightly larger, resembling ordinary wild grass at first glance, but its leaves emitted a faint glow.

The spirit herbs were right in front of him. Lin Xuan's eyes shone with excitement, but he didn't act rashly. Instead, he took a deep breath, calming himself down.

If it were another cultivator, they would have grabbed the herbs immediately. However, Lin Xuan wouldn't be so foolish. A mere thousand-year-old ginseng had a venomous toad nearby; such heavenly spirit herbs wouldn't be without a demon beast guarding them.

Lin Xuan didn't want to be careless and put himself in danger.

He extended his spiritual sense, and after a moment, a strange expression crossed his face.

There was no demon beast; otherwise, the fluctuations of spiritual energy wouldn't have escaped his notice. However, there was a faint, strange yin energy.

It felt somewhat like a ghostly or yin presence.

Lin Xuan hesitated, then stretched out his hand. Two beams of white light swept towards the Silver Moon Flower and the Glow Grass. Just as he did so, a mournful roar echoed in his ears...
