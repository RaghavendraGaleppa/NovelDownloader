# Chapter 5: Gathering Qi Pill  

"Fellow Daoist, we bear no enmity between us, but this century-old Blood Spirit Fruit is of utmost importance. I cannot risk any information leaking out—my deepest apologies."  

"I swear upon my soul to keep silent—I can even make a blood oath!"  

"Tsk, tsk. Unfortunately, I only trust the dead to truly keep secrets."  

"So you're determined to kill me no matter what? Then I have no choice but to destroy this Blood Spirit Fruit before I die."  

As he spoke, Qin Chong's expression turned fierce. He sat up, gripping the Blood Spirit Fruit tightly in his hand, channeling a trickle of spiritual energy into his palm.  

Mutual destruction!  

Seeing this, the young man's expression changed. He halted his steps about three meters away from Qin Chong and slightly retracted his magical weapon.  

"Fellow Daoist, let's talk this through."  

In truth, Qin Chong was gambling. He had no idea whether he could actually destroy the Blood Spirit Fruit, but he believed his opponent wouldn't know either.  

Qin Chong remained furious and resolute.  

"How about this—we each take a step back. If you hand over the Blood Spirit Fruit first, I promise to spare your life. What do you say?"  

"Oh? And how can I trust you to keep your word afterward?"  

"You—!"  

The young man then declared with righteous indignation, "I can swear a blood oath. If that reassures you, name any condition."  

"Fine. I'll trust you for now."  

With that, Qin Chong tossed the Blood Spirit Fruit toward him. The young man's attention was completely captured by the fruit.  

At that moment, Qin Chong's aura surged abruptly. A streak of yellow light shot out, aiming straight for the young man's heart.  

Qin Chong's cultivation had suddenly risen to the fifth level of Qi Refinement, shocking the young man. The sudden sneak attack left him no time to react.  

Yet, the man reacted swiftly, barely dodging the Flying Dragon Sword's strike. Though it pierced through his body, it missed his vital organs.  

But Qin Chong had another move prepared—a barrage of fireballs followed immediately.  

Now at a higher cultivation level, Qin Chong could unleash over a dozen fireballs at once. Amid agonized screams, the young man was engulfed in flames.  

Qin Chong then recalled the Flying Dragon Sword, its blade flashing as it severed the burning head from the body.  

After killing the man, Qin Chong retrieved the Blood Spirit Fruit and seized his opponent's magical weapon and storage pouch. Only after watching the corpse turn to ashes did he finally mount his sword and flee.  

---  

This was Qin Chong's first time flying on a sword, and he struggled to maintain balance, wobbling in the air before finally stabilizing. His speed, however, was far from impressive.  

Though the trial period wasn't over yet, Qin Chong decided to leave the Xiaocang Mountain area immediately. Even if it meant loitering in a nearby city, staying here was no longer an option.  

Half an hour later, Qin Chong gradually adapted to flight, picking up speed. A streak of yellow light cut through the sky as he headed toward Pingyang City.  

Pingyang wasn't the closest city to Xiaocang Mountain, but after killing a cultivator, Qin Chong chose the farther destination for safety.  

This was the first time Qin Chong had taken a life. His heart still pounded with a mix of fear and exhilaration—a feeling hard to describe. Yet in the ruthless world of cultivation, such experiences were inevitable.  

As night fell, Qin Chong realized he wouldn't reach Pingyang City in time. He descended and, after some searching, took refuge in a cave.  

Settling in, Qin Chong inspected the spoils from the storage pouch:  

- 67 low-grade spirit stones  
- One mid-grade magical weapon: the Azure Water Sword  
- One low-grade defensive artifact: the Black Iron Shield  
- Over a dozen medicinal herbs, mostly 40-50 years old, with two exceeding 70 years  
- Miscellaneous low-grade materials  
- A bottle of nine Gathering Qi Pills—perfect for mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators like himself  
- Three jade slips and three manuals, all containing basic cultivation techniques of little value  
- One token  

The token!  

Qin Chong examined it closely. Engraved with a lifelike black dragon, the token bore a name at its center: "Huo Yuanliang."  

His heart skipped a beat. This was a token of the Canglong Valley. The surname "Huo" suggested the man was not only a disciple of Canglong Valley but likely a member of the Huo Clan.  

Canglong Valley was a major sect in Yan Province, its influence spanning over a thousand miles. Countless cultivation families, including Qin Chong's own Qin Clan, were subordinate to it.  

The Huo Clan was a mid-tier cultivation family, rumored to have an elder at the late Foundation Establishment stage.  

Qin Chong had covered his tracks well, but he hoped the investigation wouldn't lead to him. He stored all of Huo Yuanliang's belongings inside the Eight Trigram Space—except the storage pouch, which couldn't be placed there.  

The pouch was a problem—he couldn't discard it or sell it yet. For now, he had no choice but to keep it hidden on his person.  

---  

As expected of a disciple from a major sect. Judging by his cultivation, the man was likely an outer disciple of Canglong Valley, yet his wealth left Qin Chong envious. Over the years, Qin Chong had only managed to save a pitiful dozen or so spirit stones.  

Comparisons were truly disheartening.  

But envy aside, with the Eight Trigram Mirror in his possession, his circumstances were bound to improve. Not only would his cultivation advance rapidly, but resources would also flow in steadily.  

After some contemplation, Qin Chong swallowed a Gathering Qi Pill and began meditating.  

The Qi-Inducing Pill, Gathering Qi Pill, and Condensing Qi Pill were the three most common pills for Qi Refinement cultivators, corresponding to the early, mid, and late stages. Their advantage lay in readily available ingredients and straightforward refinement, making them suitable for all cultivation methods.  

Their drawback was their mediocre efficacy compared to attribute-specific pills—those tailored to certain cultivation methods or elemental affinities. Such pills were far rarer.  

Even mid-tier families like the Huo Clan lacked them, let alone minor clans like the Qin. Likely, only a handful of core disciples in sects like Canglong Valley had access to them.  

In all his years, Qin Chong had only consumed a dozen or so Qi-Inducing Pills. This was his first time trying a Gathering Qi Pill.  

He cultivated the "Earth Mantra," an earth-attribute foundational technique. Though he had long memorized all ten layers, his progress had been stalled at a bottleneck.  

Unexpectedly, this twist of fate had propelled him straight to the fifth level of Qi Refinement.  

Now, Qin Chong suspected the Eight Trigram Mirror had been the cause of his stagnation. While this breakthrough was a pleasant surprise, he couldn't help but worry—would the mirror trap him at the next bottleneck?
