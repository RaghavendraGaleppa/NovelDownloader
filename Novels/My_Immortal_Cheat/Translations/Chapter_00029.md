# Chapter 29: Resurrection!

Zhou Yi's eyes lost their bloody glint, his aura calmed, and he carried Zhou Tian to his room, with Elder Zhan and Emperor Qin following behind.

Zhou Zui watched their retreating figures, feeling utterly cursed today. Although he didn't know what had happened, it seemed unrelated to him. However, at this point, leaving wouldn't be simple. He gritted his teeth and followed.

On the jade bed in Zhou Tian's room, he lay motionless, devoid of any vital signs.

Zhou Yi stood by, staring at Zhou Tian with deep eyes, lost in thought.

Emperor Qin and Zhou Zhan stood behind him, their brows deeply furrowed.

"Elder Zhan, what happened this time? You couldn't stop the opponent even with your intervention?" Emperor Qin asked Zhou Zhan, who was beside him.

Zhou Zhan sighed and said, "This is my responsibility. I thought it was just some rat-like enemies we had, but I never expected that old fellow Saint Devil would smuggle himself back to Kyushu and make a move against us!"

"Saint Devil!?" Emperor Qin's pupils constricted slightly; he was clearly not unfamiliar with this name.

He had seen this name in the Zhou family's ancient texts. He rose to fame nearly ten thousand years ago, an individual from the same era as Zhou Zhan. This person possessed a unique soul—one soul with two wills, a phenomenon akin to what's called split personality. Logically, such an individual would find it extremely difficult to embark on the path of cultivation because with two personalities simultaneously controlling the body, the spiritual energy within would easily fall into chaos. However, this person, somehow acquiring an unknown fortuitous encounter, stepped onto the path of cultivation and became unstoppable thereafter. One personality followed the path of light, while the other walked the path of darkness, secretly aligning with the will of heaven. His breakthrough speed was incredibly fast, making him one of the top prodigies of his time.

Although having dual personalities granted him rapid breakthrough speed, it also prevented his strength from ever truly surpassing the very top tier of prodigies. This was because while he cultivated two distinct paths, he only possessed one body, which could bear limited power. In every battle, he could only utilize half of his body's energy, unable to commit a single personality's full power. This slight difference became an insurmountable chasm!

These pieces of information flashed through his mind, and Emperor Qin spoke: "How could he smuggle himself back? Kyushu's formations are incredibly powerful; even a Celestial Venerable would find it difficult to..."

"He doesn't necessarily have to confront it head-on. Back then, he had deep connections with the monks of Luotian Temple in Heavenly Buddhist Province. Many speculated that the inheritance he received came from an ancient grand figure of Buddhism. This time, he's likely inseparable from those bald donkeys!" A cold glint flashed in Zhou Zhan's eyes.

"They also made a move?" Emperor Qin's brows were furrowed with anger. Above the imperial palace, the Dragon Vein qi churned ceaselessly, and dragon roars shook the heavens. Many prominent figures in the imperial capital were speculating what exactly had happened today. Was Luotian Temple seeking war?!

"Not yet. After all, their reputation is at stake; they wouldn't dare make a move so openly."

"Then why was there a problem? Isn't he unable to exert his full strength?" Emperor Qin asked, frowning.

"While dual personalities allowed him extremely fast breakthroughs, after reaching the Heavenly King realm, it also created a problem: because he cultivated two deep paths, he couldn't break through to the Dao Lord realm at all!" Zhou Zhan continued in a strange tone.

"He was called the easiest and also the most difficult person of our era to break through to the Dao Lord realm. Easy, because as long as his two personalities merged, he could almost instantly become a Dao Lord. Difficult, because both personalities were in the Heavenly King realm and possessed indestructible Dao hearts. Even if he willingly abandoned resistance, his two personalities couldn't merge. For thousands of years, he wandered outside Kyushu, searching for a solution, but always without success. But this time, things changed..."

"He found a method to merge! Even if it was just a wisp of energy, it was something I couldn't resist!" A hint of melancholy appeared in Zhou Zhan's eyes. He had been the leader of that era, dominating the world, and had once looked down upon Saint Devil. Now, however, he had fallen one step behind.

"Even if he breaks through to the Dao Lord realm, what then? He should know the depths of my Zhou family's heritage!" Emperor Qin snorted coldly.

"This must be the reason he returned to Kyushu. He's been stuck at this step for countless years. His sudden enlightenment this time suggests someone behind the scenes made a deal with him!" Zhou Zhan said. This wasn't difficult to deduce. The Zhou family had no past grievances or recent enmity with Saint Devil. His sudden attack on them, coupled with Saint Devil's sudden comprehension of a merging method, made the underlying conspiracy almost obvious.

Emperor Qin said no more. The name Saint Devil had already been marked with a death sentence in his mind. The Zhou family had more than just Zhou Zhan!

Zhou Zui, standing to the side, listened, dumbfounded. What in the world was this all about? Saint Devil? That name sounded incredibly formidable just hearing it!

Time passed minute by minute. Prince Qin's Estate was already under strict lockdown, with no one allowed to enter or leave.

In the cultivation chamber of Prince Qin's Estate, the decor was luxurious. The black walls were covered in inscribed formations, and rich spiritual energy gathered there. In the center lay a massive purple jade stone, with an ethereal mist swirling within it.

Seated on the jade stone was a person with fair skin and beautiful features, her brows slightly furrowed, evoking pity in anyone who saw her. It was Tian Ling, currently in secluded cultivation, preparing for the grand competition.

Tian Ling opened her eyes. What was going on? Why couldn't she calm her mind even while sitting on this warm purple jade stone? Why did she feel a sense of unease...

A somber atmosphere permeated Zhou Tian's room. Zhou Zui crouched in a corner, barely daring to breathe. Everyone had given up hope. The previous times Zhou Tian had lost his vital signs, he had regained them within a very short period. But this time, several hours had already passed. It was likely...

Zhou Yi remained silent, flecks of bloody light appearing in his eyes. The sound of blood waves echoed from the void...

Just as the time passed midnight, lines of text refreshed in the log panel of the Undying System:

"Resurrection count refreshed."
"Undying System activated."
"Host resurrected!"

To everyone's disbelief, Zhou Tian's heart thumped, "Thump!" He opened his eyes and simply sat up...

"Holy crap..." Zhou Zui's face turned ashen, his breathing rapid, looking like he was about to pass out.

Zhou Zhan's eyes were filled with golden light, lightning flickering within. He meticulously scanned Zhou Tian, but found no problems. Emperor Qin performed the same action, with auspicious qi empowering him, countless runes swirling in his eyes, yet he also couldn't detect any issues...

Zhou Yi's figure flickered, instantly appearing before Zhou Tian, his eyes holding an eerie bloody glint as he looked at Zhou Tian.

"Whoa..." Zhou Tian was startled by Zhou Yi's sudden move and exclaimed in surprise, "What do you want? I'm telling you, even a tiger won't devour its cub! Besides, my flesh isn't tasty!"

"Haha!" Zhou Yi chuckled at his words, the bloody glint in his eyes fading as he smacked Zhou Tian's head, saying, "Little brat, it's good that you're alright!"

Zhou Tian rubbed his head and looked at the few people in the room. Upon seeing Zhou Zhan and Emperor Qin, he couldn't help but straighten his posture, his expression becoming solemn, and said, "You're all here. Oh... why is Zhou Zui crouching in the corner? That's quite impolite!"
