# Chapter 27: The Path of Spells  

The path of cultivation is vast as the ocean. Magical artifacts and spiritual tools possess immense power, while talismans hold wondrous abilities. Beyond these, there are also various mystical spells.  

By harnessing spiritual energy, one can command the might of heaven and earth. Although spells may not match the power of spiritual tools, they require less spiritual energy and no external medium, making them particularly favored by low-level cultivators.  

Examples include the Ice Bullet Technique, Inner Vision Technique, and Spiritual Shield—all commonly used spells.  

Cultivation is divided into eight stages: Ethereal Opening, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, Soul Separation, Cave Profound, Spirit Division, and Heavenly Tribulation. Demonic beasts follow a similar progression from first to eighth rank. However, spells are categorized differently, consisting only of low-tier, mid-tier, and high-tier levels.  

The reason is simple: by the Core Formation stage, cultivators wield magical artifacts—formidable tools for both offense and defense. Spells, which require no medium, seem weak and redundant to high-level cultivators, who naturally abandon them.  

Only cultivators at the Ethereal Opening and Foundation Establishment stages use spells. Those at Ethereal Opening can learn low- and mid-tier spells, while Foundation Establishment cultivators can master high-tier spells.  

In practice, Ethereal Opening cultivators rely on spells the most, as those at Foundation Establishment usually possess spiritual tools, which are more powerful. Of course, exceptions exist—some high-tier spells rival the might of spiritual tools. Moreover, though spiritual tools are merely simplified versions of magical artifacts, they remain rare treasures. Some impoverished sects or destitute rogue cultivators may reach Foundation Establishment without ever obtaining one.  

This highlights just how wealthy Lin Xuan was, owning three spiritual tools—one of them a top-tier item.  

Currently, using spiritual tools still strained his spiritual energy, so he decided to supplement his arsenal with suitable spells. Resolved, Lin Xuan took action.  

From his storage ring, he retrieved an unremarkable notebook, its handwritten contents appearing valueless at first glance. Yet Lin Xuan treated it with great care.  

This notebook contained three years' worth of his personal notes.  

Lacking spiritual roots, Lin Xuan’s cultivation progress had once lagged far behind his peers. Without sufficient spiritual energy, he could only watch enviously as others practiced the spells taught by their instructors. Another person might have given up, avoiding the humiliation of attending lectures at the Young Eagle Pavilion. But Lin Xuan persisted. Not only did he attend every lesson, but he also diligently took notes, rain or shine.  

To others, this seemed foolish. But Lin Xuan had his reasons—and now, his foresight proved wise.  

Back then, he had thought, *Even if I can’t practice these techniques now, I’ll study them once my cultivation advances. Writing them down ensures I won’t forget.*  

Had he not done so, he wouldn’t even know where to begin learning spells now. This was the benefit of his meticulous nature—planning ahead and acting with deliberation.  

Over three years, the instructors had taught many spells, but mastering them all was neither feasible nor necessary. Rather than dabbling in redundant techniques, it was better to specialize in a few suited to his needs.  

With this in mind, Lin Xuan carefully reviewed his notes, first eliminating low-tier spells. Though easier to learn, their power was limited, and he refused to waste precious time on them.  

His focus was on mid-tier spells. After careful consideration, he selected three:  

1. **Spiritual Shield** – A defensive spell. As the saying goes, *Before learning to strike, learn to endure.* In battle, survival comes first, so this was his priority.  
2. **Ice Needle Technique** – A water-attribute spell from the Five Elements, renowned for its formidable and unpredictable offensive power. Though harder to master, Lin Xuan didn’t fear hardship—only insufficient strength.  
3. **Wind Riding Technique** – An auxiliary spell, similar to the low-tier Light Body Technique but far more advanced.  

While cultivators needed spiritual tools to fly, mastering the Wind Riding Technique granted extraordinary agility—leaping dozens of meters in a single bound. Even the greatest mortal martial artists couldn’t compare, as this technique relied on spiritual energy, placing cultivators beyond ordinary limits.  

With spells for defense, offense, and evasion, Lin Xuan’s selection was comprehensive—offensive when needed, defensive when necessary.  

From then on, Lin Xuan’s days grew busier. Between refining pills, meditating, and practicing spells, he had no time to rest. Fortunately, as his cultivation advanced, he required less sleep.  

*Endure hardship to ascend beyond immortals.* Others might struggle with such a grueling regimen, but Lin Xuan was different. Having endured repeated failures and mockery for lacking spiritual roots, and having overcome the illusions of the Heart-Tempering Path, he now had the means to succeed. A little hardship meant nothing.  

### Progress  

Days passed, and Lin Xuan made steady progress. He began with the Spiritual Shield, a mid-tier defensive spell widely favored by Ethereal Opening and even Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

The principle was simple: channeling spiritual energy to form a protective barrier around the body, deflecting attacks.  

Though sturdy—capable of repelling blades and arrows—its effectiveness varied with the user’s spiritual energy.  

Despite being a mid-tier spell, mastering it was straightforward with sufficient spiritual energy. Even without spiritual roots, Lin Xuan’s strong spiritual power allowed him to master the Spiritual Shield in just three days!
