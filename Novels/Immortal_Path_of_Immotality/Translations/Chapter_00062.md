# Chapter 62: Fighting on Two Fronts

When Huang the Immortal Master heard that Lin Shan was willing to stay and fight alongside him rather than flee, tears welled up in his eyes, his lips trembling speechlessly.

Lin Shan wasn't acting on impulse. If Huang hadn't saved his life by the stream, he might have fallen victim to Princess Guo's soul-piercing bell—a formidable magical artifact indeed. 

Facing these two opponents now, Lin Shan felt no fear. 

This time, he wouldn't repeat his mistake of holding back. He immediately summoned his Cold Iron Sword, pointing it directly at the hook-nosed man. With limited combat options and no auxiliary artifacts, his strategy was simple: eliminate one opponent first to gain the upper hand.

The hook-nosed man acted the moment Lin Shan finished speaking, activating his Soulhook. A murky, translucent shadow lashed out, making both Lin Shan and Huang feel as if their souls were being torn away. 

Lin Shan channeled his spiritual energy wildly, causing the Cold Iron Sword to blaze with blue light as sword qi erupted. Beside him, Huang frantically cast earthen prison spells on himself while directing his moths toward the green-robed elder. His role was simple—hold out until Lin Shan broke through and came to his rescue.

The hook-nosed man had the same idea—occupy Lin Shan until the green-robed elder dealt with Huang, then gang up on Lin Shan.

The hook-nosed man knew Princess Guo's capabilities—an ice spirit root cultivator, mid Qi Refinement stage before twenty, lavished with resources by Prince Huai'an, equipped with offensive and defensive artifacts, the Soulstartle Bell, and intermediate spells—a formidable figure even among the capital's rogue cultivators.

That Lin Shan had nearly killed her spoke volumes about his strength!

Seeing the blue sword qi approaching, the hook-nosed man produced a talisman, summoning a golden barrier around himself.

"Clang!"

The barrier dimmed slightly, but he remained unharmed.

"An intermediate-grade talisman!"

Lin Shan's heart tightened. This Golden Light Talisman resembled the one used by Immortal Master Nan at Dongting Lake, but its power was markedly different. His Frost Sword Qi had shattered Princess Guo's intermediate Ice Mirror Spell in one strike, yet couldn't breach this barrier.

There was only one explanation—the talisman's creator was at least late Qi Refinement stage or beyond.

Lin Shan quickly distanced himself. His greatest advantage was range—the Cold Iron Sword's attack radius doubled others'. At twenty meters, he unleashed another sword beam.

Seeing his golden barrier dim further, the hook-nosed man winced. These were expensive! He gave chase, but how could a fire-attribute cultivator match a wind-attribute's speed?

Thus began a lopsided battle—the hook-nosed man couldn't close the distance, his attacks fell short, and dodging was impossible. Lin Shan kited him effortlessly at twenty meters.

After enduring seven or eight sword strikes, the golden barrier shattered with a "pop," dissolving into motes of light. The talisman in his pocket spontaneously combusted into ashes.

A defensive talisman worth twenty spirit stones—equivalent to a low-grade artifact—gone just like that!

Before he could lament, Lin Shan's next strike forced him to summon a round shield artifact.

"Clang!"

A shallow dent appeared on the shield's surface, frost creeping across it.

Lin Shan marveled at his opponent's defenses but pressed the attack relentlessly. Strike after strike rained down as the hook-nosed man could only endure.

Three breaths later, the shield was pockmarked.  
Five breaths, cracks spread across its surface.  
Seven breaths, it shattered into frozen chunks.

The hook-nosed man's heart bled—he was losing more than he could possibly gain! Envy gnawed at him as he realized the gulf between their equipment. 

Intermediate artifacts were rare among rogue cultivators. Low-grade artifacts cost 20-50 spirit stones—affordable for most. But intermediate ones started at 200, with specialized versions reaching hundreds. Lin Shan's triple-inscribed Cold Iron Sword was top-tier.

Seeing his opponent weakened, Lin Shan intensified his assault. When the next frost beam struck, the hook-nosed man crossed his Soulhook defensively—only to be sent flying, weapon and all.

"Clink!"

As he scrambled up, another beam forced him to block again.

"Snap!"

The precious soul-hooking artifact split in two.

Lin Shan inwardly winced—these could have been his spoils! Channeling his frustration, he unleashed a furious barrage.

"Die already!"

With his opponent's talismans and artifacts exhausted, Lin Shan deployed his trump card—the Startle Technique learned from Nightingale.

But to his astonishment, the hook-nosed man produced another low-grade sword from his storage bag, stubbornly persisting with his "physical resistance" strategy.

Lin Shan sighed—typical of a "blacksmith's apprentice." After breaking one sword, he had another! How many low-grade artifacts had this man hoarded? His dedication to mediocrity was almost admirable.

But today, he would die.

Finally at his limit, the hook-nosed man bellowed at the green-robed elder, "Can't you handle one useless old man? I'm getting slaughtered here!"

Lin Shan turned to see Huang in dire straits—his purchased spirit insects annihilated, poison powder raining from surviving moths overhead, his earthen prisons corroded through. The green-robed elder's pagoda released swarms of flying ants that covered Huang, biting viciously as he screamed.

"You're dead!"

Lin Shan pivoted, one sword beam decimating the moths, another shattering their gourd vessel. Though a magical tool, the gourd's fragility made it no match for his blade.

The green-robed elder howled at the ruined gourd and frozen larvae, cursing the hook-nosed man's failure to contain Lin Shan. But when he looked—his ally had fled, all pretense of teamwork abandoned.

Panicked, the elder stuffed his pagoda away and bolted in the opposite direction.

Lin Shan finished off the remaining moths, but Huang was now writhing under the ants' relentless assault, flesh torn and bleeding. 

"Go after them! Leave me!" Huang gritted through the pain.

Without hesitation, Lin Shan gave chase, wind-walking across the ground. In ten breaths, he spotted the hook-nosed man and struck. A desperate block failed—the man's head rolled.

Snatching the storage bag, Lin Shan doubled back past Huang to pursue the elder.

Within minutes, the green-robed figure came into view. Lin Shan's sword pulsed with blue light as its runes ignited once more.

"Fellow Daoist Lin, hear me—"

The elder's plea was cut short as the sword beam arrived. He managed to fire a whistling arrow skyward before the strike hit home—a firework blooming in the night.

Lin Shan retrieved the storage bag, then froze. Another firework erupted over a distant mountain—a clear response.
