Chapter 197: Who Taught You That Unit of Measurement?

"Exactly how much is 'a little bit'?"

The white-haired youth and the elderly man with white hair and a childlike face looked at each other and couldn't help but chuckle.

As everyone knew, sword cultivators were people who valued face and reputation.

Walking the Jianghu meant living with abandon and pleasure; they had never hesitated to spend a fortune on a whim.

From the elders down to the disciples, they all shared a generous nature.

As a sect of sword cultivators without other sources of income like pill refining or artifact crafting, the Hengyun Sword City was not considered wealthy.

However, that was only when compared to other forces at the state level.

Even if Li Mo were to bring over the entire treasury of the Qingyuan Sect, it wouldn't mean much to them.

The Sword City owed Li Mo a favor, and moreover, although the Divine Skill Li Mo had comprehended was extraordinary, it wasn't a sword technique. They couldn't make things difficult for him.

Li Mo cleared his throat and said, "Seniors, with your sword bones and noble character, you naturally view money as dirt."

"The first proposal is merely to show my gratitude, just a token of appreciation."

He knew how to flatter the old men.

The white-haired youth puffed out his chest. "Indeed, how could we sword cultivators care about mere gold and silver?"

This kid was a man of face.

Sword cultivators loved dealing with people who valued face.

The elderly man with white hair and a childlike face stroked his beard and asked with a smile, "In your opinion, how much gold and silver would be reasonable to pay for a single viewing of the sword mark?"

Li Mo gestured with his fingers again.

"Two thousand taels of gold?"

Li Mo shook his head.

"Twenty thousand?"

Little Li shook his head again.

"Two hundred thousand?"

The white-haired youth maintained a calm and relaxed expression on the surface, but his heart trembled slightly.

Does this kid have a gold mine at home?

Two hundred thousand taels, and it's gold, enough for the Sword City disciples to 'live freely in the Jianghu' for a whole year.

However, Li Mo shook his head again.

Could it be two hundred taels? That really would be just a token of appreciation.

Shaking his head slightly, the white-haired youth asked again, "What about the second proposal you mentioned?"

"Uh..."

Li Mo was just about to state the price he had in mind, but since the senior had already asked about the second proposal, he had no choice but to say, "The second proposal is to give this junior some time."

"Wait until my strength increases, and I meet the conditions to fully unleash the Divine Skill, then I will come back to record it."

"I am confident I can fulfill this promise within three years."

The *Heaven-Shattering Human Path Killing Hammer* imposed requirements not only on the user's cultivation realm.

It also had conditions that were harsh for an ordinary person.

Li Mo said seriously, "If the two seniors have any concerns, we can set a three-year agreement..."

The request for a three-year agreement was rejected.

In terms of talent for the hammer technique, no one had any doubts about him.

"I trust you." ×3.

Of the four people, three replied without hesitation.

The Ice Cube didn't speak, but her expression said it all.

Li Mo: "..."

For the first time, he felt such complex emotions because of someone's trust.

"The second proposal is still reasonable."

The old man thought for a moment and asked, "Then what about the third?"

"The third is for me to leave a complete sword technique in the Sword City."

"The sword technique I used in the Sword Testing Grand Conference, the two seniors should have some understanding of it. It is in no way inferior to a Divine Skill."

Li Mo didn't feel any heartache at all.

He would be more than happy if the two elders chose the third option.

"Is that the sword technique that breaks all methods and turns the rotten into the miraculous?"

The two Law Body powerhouses straightened their posture.

"Yes," Li Mo nodded.

Seeing him looking so serious with clear eyes, they couldn't help but praise him inwardly.

When this kid said he wished for 'every sword cultivator under the heavens to become a Sword Immortal', it seemed to be from the bottom of his heart.

This boy's magnanimity was even more like that of a sword hero.

Ahem...

Actually, Little Li's thoughts were very simple.

First, it would fulfill the rules of the Hengyun Sword City, and second, there might be unexpected investment returns.

*Solitary Nine Swords* was extremely difficult; those who could gain something from it must be extraordinary individuals.

The two Law Bodies of the Sword City did not hesitate.

After exchanging a glance, the white-haired youth nodded and said, "Then let's go with the third proposal."

"Senior, are you sure you don't want to consider the first proposal?"

Li Mo confirmed again.

After all, that was also a form of investment... and it was an investment with immediate returns.

"For us sword cultivators, money is nothing but floating clouds."

"You're looking down on us."

The white-haired youth shook his head with a smile.

"Alright," Li Mo scratched his head.

Sword cultivators walking the Jianghu would spend money generously for justice at the drop of a hat.

He had always been curious about where sword cultivators got their money.

Shaking his head, he took out his brush and ink and began writing the general principles of *Solitary Nine Swords*.

After he finished writing.

The two Law Body powerhouses looked at it together, both revealing expressions of astonishment.

This sword technique had an incredibly high concept!

But it was also extremely, extremely difficult.

It was hard to imagine how Li Mo had managed to practice it to such a degree...

"It is indeed not inferior to a Divine Skill."

"Mm, if one were to perfect this sword technique, it wouldn't be impossible to grasp a path of the Sword Dao."

Li Mo was truly sincere.

Without any hesitation, he left the complete general principles of the sword technique in the Hengyun Sword City.要知道, the sword techniques left by Ying Bing and Jiang Chulong were only one or two moves of a Divine Skill.

A complete Divine Skill was enough to make Law Body powerhouses envious and provoke the covetousness of Sage Realm experts.

"In that case, we have taken a huge advantage from you."

"If there is anything you need, just ask!"

"This junior has some research in painting and wishes to make a rubbing of the strange stone. I ask the seniors to grant this wish."

Li Mo was not coy; he had planned for this long ago.

The two Law Body powerhouses felt that Li Mo was also a man of face.

Could such a small matter be considered a problem?

"Ahem, there is just one thing you must take note of."

"Oh?"

"You must never, ever take out your hammer in front of the strange stone."

"...Alright."

If he were to press it again, the strange stone wouldn't be able to be flipped over.

Both the host and the guests were delighted, and everyone was quite satisfied.

As they were bidding farewell.

The elderly man with white hair and a childlike face, who was still reading *Solitary Nine Swords*, casually asked, "By the way, how much exactly was the amount you gestured earlier?"

The white-haired youth also looked up.

It wasn't two thousand taels, not twenty thousand, and not two hundred thousand.

Little Li was such an open and straightforward kid; it couldn't have been two hundred taels.

"Two?"

Li Mo, who was already at the door, stopped in his tracks.

He didn't use that unit of measurement anymore.

"I said two mountains of gold."

"...How much?"

"Two mountains of gold, just... mountains the size of the sect gate."

Li Mo gestured with his hands.

The three of them walked away.

The white-haired youth and the old man stood where they were, silent for a very, very long time.

They had even forgotten about studying *Solitary Nine Swords* for a moment, and were only curious about one thing.

Who the hell taught you that unit of measurement?!
