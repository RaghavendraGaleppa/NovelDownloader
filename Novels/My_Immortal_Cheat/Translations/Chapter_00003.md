**Chapter 3: Tian Ling**

“Tian’er, are you alright?” Zhou Yi stepped forward, asking worriedly.

“I’m fine.” Zhou Tian shook his head. His head still ached a little, but the pain was gradually subsiding.

“Your Royal Highness, Prince of Qin, I shall take my leave.” The old man sitting by his bed stood up and bowed to Zhou Yi.

“Yes, you may go.” Zhou Yi nodded. Uncle Zhou, who was behind him, led the old man out.

“I told you to exercise more often, but you wouldn’t listen. I gave you all those heavenly treasures, but you wouldn’t eat them. Look at your body now, you get exhausted and faint just from walking!” After the old man left, Zhou Yi spoke to Zhou Tian, frustrated by his lack of progress.

Zhou Tian gave a wry smile. His father had never been a mortal without cultivation for a single day since birth, so he had no idea what a mortal’s physique was like. Even a regular mortal wouldn't get exhausted and faint just from walking.

He vaguely remembered hearing a strange language before losing consciousness, something like “Undying System activated.” He wondered if it was just a hallucination.

Just as he was thinking this, a purple box suddenly popped up in front of his eyes. At the top was his avatar, next to it was a long bar, similar to an experience bar in a game, and below it was a small ‘2’.

Below that was a small window with the words “Skills” and a small yellow ‘1’ flickering above it.

At the very bottom was a small box containing lines of small red text:
“Host suffered a soul attack!”
“Host has died!”
“Undying System activated!”
“Host has been resurrected!”
“Death count increased by one!”
“Host leveled up, skill point gained!”

“What is this!?” Zhou Tian’s pupils constricted as he stared at the purple box floating before his eyes. He quickly looked up, but saw no abnormality in the people present. It seemed only he could see this box.

“This must be my ‘Golden Finger’, right? The Undying System? A system that makes me unable to die? Interesting!”

“…Tian’er…Tian’er…Zhou Tian!” A shout pulled Zhou Tian out of his thoughts. He snapped back to reality and saw his father frowning at him.

“Are you still uncomfortable anywhere?”

“No, I was just thinking about something.” Zhou Tian shook his head, casually giving an excuse. Perhaps because his attention shifted, the purple box also disappeared. He was still thinking about the box, having not had time to properly examine it, but now was not the time for research. He could only temporarily suppress his curiosity.

“It’s good that you’re fine. Let me introduce you. This is Elder Li of the Haotian Sect. He is one of the well-known venerable elders in our Futian Province.” Zhou Yi pointed to the white-haired middle-aged man.

Haotian Sect?

This world spanned nine vast provinces. Each province was controlled by a powerful major force. The province where Zhou Tian resided was called Futian Province, and its ruler was the Tianqin Empire. Under the Tianqin Empire, there were also many scattered forces, and the Haotian Sect was among the strongest of these scattered forces.

Mulling over this information, Zhou Tian rose and said, “Greetings, Elder Li.”

Elder Li laughed heartily, saying, “Oh, no, no, I only have a slight reputation in one province. Prince Qin, however, is renowned throughout all nine provinces!”

After some mutual praise, hosts and guests alike were delighted.

Zhou Yi smiled, pointing to the girl beside him, and continued, “This is Miss Ling Tian, the direct disciple of the Haotian Sect Master. Despite her young age, she is already a master who has activated the Heavenly Treasure of the Three-Treasure Realm. She is also ranked highly on our Futian Hundred Flowers List.”

Ling Tian stood up and said to Zhou Yi, “Uncle Prince Qin, you jest. Ling’er only has a little meager talent, nothing worth mentioning.”

Then she turned to Zhou Tian and said, “Greetings, Elder Brother Zhou Tian.”

Her voice was soft and sweet, her teeth bright, her eyes like crescent moons, and her presence ethereal like an immortal.

Although Zhou Tian had seen many girls of peerless beauty due to the prevalence of various Photoshop software in his previous life, this was the first time he had encountered someone with such an aura. Fortunately, he was also an excellent “keyboard scholar”—what is a keyboard scholar? A keyboard scholar possesses a fastidious aesthetic eye. It's not just about “finding a bone in an egg”; even “looking for a polar bear in the South Pole” wouldn’t be difficult for them. For example, this young lady, while beautiful and possessing great temperament, had a major flaw: her chest was too small.

Therefore, Zhou Tian was not enchanted by Miss Tian Ling’s appearance. He bowed and said to her, “Greetings, Miss Tian Ling.”

This world had a complete cultivation system, from mortals without the strength to truss a chicken to experts capable of destroying the heavens and earth. Each stage had strict divisions.

They were: Mortal Transformation, Sky Soaring, Heavenly Revelation, Three Treasures, Dharma Aspect, Saint, and Great Saint. Zhou Tian’s original body only had fragmented memories up to the Great Saint realm, as he couldn’t cultivate, so paying attention to these stages wasn’t very useful for him.

Mortal Transformation was the initial departure from the realm of mortals. Upon reaching Sky Soaring, one gained the ability to fly. Breaking through to Heavenly Revelation granted various miraculous abilities. The Three Treasures were divided into Heavenly, Earthly, and Human Treasures. Activating these three treasures would bestow various bizarre and unfathomable divine abilities. After activating all Three Treasures, one could condense a Dharma Aspect, gaining the preliminary ability to change the world. As for what kind of realm a Saint was, Zhou Tian’s original body had no memory of it; it could only be intuitively understood, not explained in words, let alone realms beyond Saint.

Zhou Tian was seventeen. Since Miss Ling Tian called him “Elder Brother,” she wouldn’t be older than him. To break through to the Three Treasures Realm at this age was indeed worthy of being called peerless talent.

Zhou Tian absorbed this information, but his expression remained largely unchanged.

Zhou Yi nodded, appearing very satisfied at this scene, then said, “You young people can chat for a while. Elder Li and I have some matters to discuss, so we’ll excuse ourselves first.”

Elder Li also nodded, signaling his agreement.

Zhou Tian had a strange feeling, but still bowed and said, “Father, Elder Li, please take your time.”

Miss Tian Ling also softly said, “Elder Li, Uncle Prince Qin, please take your time.”

After the two middle-aged, somewhat greasy uncles left, a strange atmosphere settled in the room.

“As the Prince of Pickup Lines, how can I let the atmosphere remain so awkward!” Zhou Tian secretly pondered, then spoke, “Miss Tian Ling, are you… thirsty?”

Miss Tian Ling was slightly startled by his question, then showed a faint smile and said, “I am a little thirsty indeed.”

See that, see that? I have special pickup skills.

Zhou Tian secretly gave himself a thumbs-up for his quick wit.

He walked to the table, picked up a purple-gold sand pottery pot, and poured out a cup of tea, from which wisps of steam curled up. There were also faint golden coiling dragons swimming within it, indicating it was clearly no ordinary item.

Miss Tian Ling held the teacup with her fair, tender hands, took a glance, and exclaimed, “Tianlong Tea! It has the effect of nourishing the soul, and even has a slight effect on people in the Dharma Aspect Realm. Outside, it has a price but no market!”

Zhou Tian was astonished to hear this. “This stuff has so many intricacies? I drink it every day and haven’t noticed anything.”

“Even in our Haotian Sect, only the Sect Master can occasionally enjoy a cup.” Miss Tian Ling lowered her head, sipped from the tea with her cherry lips, and closed her eyes. Her smooth forehead glowed faintly, and a mysterious rune could be seen flickering.
