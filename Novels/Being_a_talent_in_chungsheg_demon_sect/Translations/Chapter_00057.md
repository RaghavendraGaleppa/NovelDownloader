**Chapter 57: Cultivation Knows No Time**

Within the Holy Sect of Primeval Origin, amidst the Sea of Connecting Clouds.

When Lu Yang finally returned to Butian Peak, there was barely a patch of good flesh left on his entire body. His injuries were even more severe than those sustained during the great battle at Skeleton Mountain.

On his return journey to the sect by flying boat, the vessel was ambushed by a righteous sect. A Qi Condensation Grand Completion cultivator used a divine ability to cleave his left hand down to the bone, and his face was covered in scars, left behind after a scorpion beast ambushed him with its tail stinger while he passed through a mountain forest.

These were merely his superficial wounds.

Beneath this battered physique, his meridians, acupoints, Dantian, and Purple Mansion all suffered varying degrees of damage, all inflicted by individuals weaker than himself.

“This is what they mean by 'when fortune turns, even heroes lose their freedom'.”

Lu Yang wore a helpless expression. His fortune for the next thirty years had been prematurely exhausted by True Man Yinshan's 'fishing', leaving him plagued by bad luck. Naturally, nothing he attempted went smoothly.

Initially, Lu Yang tried to retaliate.

However, whenever he engaged in combat, various mishaps would befall him, such as old injuries flaring up, overexertion leading to internal damage, or even divine abilities backfiring. In the end, he could only continuously flee.

Still, he was now a Qi Condensation Grand Completion cultivator. Although his luck was gone, his life was sufficiently tough, allowing him to persevere until he returned to the sect.

As for the Holy Sect's war of annihilation against the Divine Martial Sect, initiated after the Skeleton Mountain incident, Lu Yang dared not participate. In his current state, where he might even fall into a latrine just going to the restroom, he worried that a Foundation Establishment True Man could swat him dead from a thousand miles away if he truly went to the Divine Martial Sect.

Upon returning to the Holy Sect, Lu Yang immediately retreated into his cave abode.

He then deployed the Blood-Washing Sky River Sword Array Formation Diagram outside and plastered various talismans both inside and outside the cave abode, completely sealing it off and isolating it from all external disturbances.

“For the next thirty years, I will not leave!”

Moreover, with bad luck clinging to him, even cultivation was a luxury. Far from advancing his cultivation, the only likely outcome was cultivation deviation.

Fortunately, he had already reached Qi Condensation Grand Completion, so there was no urgent need to continue cultivating.

Lu Yang sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, then retrieved a jade slip from his storage bag. This jade slip, however, was unlike ordinary ones; it was a brilliant golden color.

This item was called the "Dao Enlightenment Jade Slip".

As a substitute for a Foundation Establishment Rare Treasure, True Man Yinshan had bestowed this item upon him. As he had wished, it was a secret treasure that could help one comprehend Dao principles.

Should he encounter any difficulties during cultivation, he only needed to inject his question into the jade slip, and it would provide an answer. Within the Qi Condensation realm, its answers were 100% accurate, an effect almost equivalent to a Foundation Establishment True Man helping him deduce a divine ability. For Lu Yang, it was truly a godsend.

“In my current state, comprehending divine abilities is a dead end.”

“Given how unlucky I am, I'd certainly fail to grasp the correct path and might even stray onto a crooked one. But this Dao Enlightenment Jade Slip is different!”

“True Man Yinshan said that this rare artifact has faintly touched the threshold of Foundation Establishment, so its answers will not be affected by my bad luck.”

Despite this, Lu Yang was not in a hurry to use it to comprehend the Supreme Clarity Edict Treasure Talisman. Although it was the last divine ability of his great divine method, the *Grand Yin Transformation Corpse Release True Method*, he valued another gain from Skeleton Mountain even more: the *Great One Golden Flower Pill Scroll*!

Of course, he hadn't obtained the complete *Great One Golden Flower Pill Scroll*.

After all, he wasn't a true disciple of Butian Peak, and the quality of his cultivation methods was limited, so he didn't receive the full text from True Person Yun Miao.

He only obtained one-third of it, a divine ability named "Great One Primordial Essence Jade Splendor".

As the name suggested, after cultivating this divine ability, one could condense a jade-colored "essence light" which, when applied to the physical body, would make it indestructible.

In addition, it also had the effect of repairing physical injuries.

This point was especially crucial for Lu Yang now. Due to his bad luck, he was currently "missing pieces," his physical body severely damaged.

“Once my injuries and luck recover, I might need to find a body-tempering cultivation method to practice.”

Thinking this, Lu Yang immediately took out his disciple token and contacted Luo Wuya, the Second Senior Brother of the Three Rivers Society, intending to inquire about suitable cultivation methods.

As a Qi Condensation Grand Completion cultivator, he now had the qualification to converse with Luo Wuya as an equal.

Soon, Luo Wuya sent a reply:

“There is indeed a cultivation method very suitable for Junior Brother, but it cannot be cultivated yet. Junior Brother might as well wait a few years; I will notify you when the time is right.”

Lu Yang naturally agreed with pleasure and then entered secluded meditation.

A few years later, a spirited young man arrived outside Lu Yang's cave abode.

The young man, named Wang Song, had just been accepted into the Holy Sect a few days prior. He had also joined the Three Rivers Society through the recommendation of his grandfather, Wang Bairong, and had taken on Luo Wuya's commission.

“Senior Brother Luo and Senior Brother Lu had an agreement regarding a body-tempering cultivation method. However, Senior Brother Luo fought valiantly for several years against the Divine Martial Sect, earning great merit and receiving a Foundation Establishment rare treasure from a True Man. He is now preparing to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm and cannot come personally, so he specifically asked me to deliver the cultivation method...”

“But now Senior Brother Lu is also in seclusion. What should I do?”

Wang Song's face was troubled. In the end, he had no choice but to find a cave abode nearby Lu Yang's and settle down. He was young, after all, and had the time to wait for Lu Yang to emerge from seclusion.

Thinking this, Wang Song glanced at Lu Yang's cave abode again, his eyes filled with anticipation.

As far as he knew, this Senior Brother Lu seemed to have been an ordinary disciple once, yet he had distinguished himself to become a Qi Condensation Grand Completion cultivator, with Foundation Establishment now within reach.

“If Senior Brother Lu can do it, why can't I?!”

“I am currently at Qi Condensation Level One. As long as I study diligently, cultivate arduously, and strive unceasingly, I, too, will surely become a figure like Senior Brother Luo and Senior Brother Lu in the future!”

“Thirty years to the east of the river, thirty years to the west of the river; do not bully a young man for being poor!”

Cultivation knows no time; in the blink of an eye, thirty years passed.

Butian Peak's Library Pavilion.

Wang Song, now over fifty years old, had been stuck at the Qi Condensation Level Three bottleneck for over a decade, with little progress in his cultivation. Traces of old age were already visible in his features.

Wang Bairong, the elder of the Library Pavilion who had originally recommended him to the Holy Sect, had long since passed away, leaving him only the stable job of Library Pavilion Steward and a cave abode that still required thirty years of loan payments. Fortunately, his luck had been decent; after thirty years of diligent work, he was finally close to paying off the loan.

The sharp edges of his youth had long been smoothed away.

Now, Wang Song's face only showed the numbness of someone who had been severely beaten by the Holy Sect. His mindset had shifted from the initial "do not bully a young man for being poor" to "the dead are paramount."

Just get by, he thought.

Looking on the bright side, at least he was almost done with his cave abode loan. This way, when his son joined the Holy Sect, he would have something to start with...

Just then, a loud bang suddenly echoed from afar.

“Hmm?”

Wang Song looked up blankly, only to see the cave abode – that abode he loved, hated, and felt helpless about, which he had once cursed at but had never seen open – suddenly stir.

“Emerging from seclusion... Senior Brother Lu is emerging from seclusion!?”

The next second, the cave abode opened, and Wang Song immediately saw a handsome young man, as youthful and spirited as Wang Song himself was thirty years ago, stepping out.

Thirty years had flowed by, yet they had left not a single trace on him.

Then, as if sensing Wang Song's gaze, the handsome young man suddenly turned his head, his calm gaze seemingly capable of piercing through people's hearts.

“You are...?”

Lu Yang's face showed curiosity. With a thought, a halo of light, like a full moon, instantly appeared behind his head, within which flowed incredibly intricate talismanic scripts.

The scripts resembled dragons and phoenixes, giving a sense of extreme contradiction. At first glance, they were as minute as mustard seeds, but upon closer observation, one would fall into them as if witnessing a vast universe. And as time passed, these scripts continuously transformed, displaying the myriad forms of flowers, birds, fish, insects, and all creation.

The Supreme Clarity Edict Treasure Talisman!

This was the last divine ability of the *Grand Yin Transformation Corpse Release True Method*, completely different from the Demonic Sky-Blood Transformation Divine Light and the Profound Yin Soul Seizing Grand Method; it was not used for combat.

Instead, it was used for divination.

Thus, the moment Lu Yang's gaze fell upon Wang Song, with the talismanic scripts operating, the entire sequence of events was no longer a secret to him.

Whether it was Wang Song's identity, his ancestors for eighteen generations, the cultivation method he practiced, his cultivation level, his proficient divine abilities, or even why he had waited outside the cave abode—Lu Yang learned every detail, every cause and effect. This feeling of understanding everything as clearly as the lines on his palm made Lu Yang sigh with emotion:

‘Perhaps this is what it feels like to be a Foundation Establishment True Man?’

Of course, this was also due to the enormous cultivation gap between him and Wang Song. If he were to divine a Qi Condensation Grand Completion cultivator, it would certainly not be so effortless.

From this, it was clear that he was still far from a Foundation Establishment True Man.

On the other side, Wang Song had finally waited for Senior Brother Lu, whom he had thought about for decades. He stumbled forward, about to pay his respects, but only heard a sigh:

“No need to bow. Give me the item.”

Wang Song dared not delay. He quickly took out a jade slip that he had kept for thirty years. Lu Yang's spiritual sense swept over it, and the slip's restrictive enchantment automatically dissolved, revealing its contents.

Luo Wuya hadn't lied to him; he had indeed sent a body-tempering cultivation method, and it was indeed very suitable for him.

Its name: *The Sage's Theft*.
