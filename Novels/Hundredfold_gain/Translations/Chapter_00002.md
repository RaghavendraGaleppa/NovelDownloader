# Chapter 2: Entering the Main Sect, Receiving Cultivation Techniques  

After the spiritual root test concluded, the Qi family's immortal master gave the newly selected disciples some time to settle their worldly affairs before taking them to the main sect for cultivation.  

Qi Li, Qi Huo, and others were bidding farewell to their families.  

Having been born and raised in Baishi Town, Qi Chuan naturally had relatives as well. While waiting for his golden finger system to finish loading, he walked through the crowd of ordinary townsfolk toward the edge of the square, where he soon spotted a middle-aged couple dressed in fine robes.  

"Uncle, Aunt," Qi Chuan greeted with a gentle expression.  

In the year of Qi Chuan's birth, Baishi Town had suffered an attack by demonic beasts, resulting in many casualties—his parents among them. He was the sole survivor. Fortunately, his uncle and aunt had taken pity on the orphaned child and raised him as their own until this day, when he turned ten.  

"Good, good. Our Ah Chuan has grown into an immortal master now," his aunt said warmly. Though her face bore only faint crow's feet at the corners of her eyes, her kindness had always been evident in the way she cared for Qi Chuan. She reached out to straighten his sleeves and collar, her eyes filled with pride and joy, though a trace of reluctance lingered beneath.  

"Your aunt is right," his uncle chimed in. Still in his prime with a full head of hair and neatly dressed, he looked particularly spirited today. "Our family finally has an immortal master. The higher your cultivation, the better our lives will be. If you reach the late stages of Qi Refinement, who knows—maybe I can even take a few concubines!"  

"Qi Yue, what did you just say?" His aunt turned to him with a sweet smile.  

"I—I mean, Ah Chuan, I have a letter here. Once you enter the valley, make sure to deliver it to your Second Grandfather," his uncle stammered, quickly changing the subject as he pulled out a prepared letter from his robe.  

Of course, had Qi Chuan not awakened a spiritual root today, this letter would never have seen the light of day.  

"A letter for my Second Grandfather?" Qi Chuan was already used to his uncle's antics and ignored the reckless remark, focusing instead on the letter with curiosity.  

He had long known about his Second Grandfather—his grandfather's younger brother. His grandfather had only two sons, and after his father's death, his uncle had been the only one left. Yet, their family had managed to live comfortably in Baishi Town, partly due to the lingering influence of his Second Grandfather, an immortal master in the main sect.  

However, rumors suggested that his Second Grandfather hadn't fared well in the sect, his cultivation stagnant at a low level. Qi Chuan wondered how much truth there was to that.  

"Exactly. Your Second Grandfather entered the valley decades ago—a true veteran immortal master. By now, he might even be at the late stages of Qi Refinement. With this letter, he’ll surely lend you a hand," his uncle declared confidently.  

Qi Chuan wasn't entirely convinced. Still, having a relative in the sect, even a struggling one, was better than being completely alone. He couldn't help but wonder—what realm had his Second Grandfather actually reached?  

After a few more exchanges and final instructions, the time for parting arrived.  

"Aunt, take care of yourself. I’ll come down to visit when I can."  

"Uncle, have more children. If any awaken spiritual roots, send them to me in the sect."  

"I’m off now."  

With the letter safely stored, Qi Chuan waved goodbye and turned away.  

"From this day forth, the divide between immortal and mortal..." His uncle sighed mournfully as he watched Qi Chuan's retreating figure.  

"Yes..." His aunt's voice trembled slightly. Though Qi Chuan was her brother-in-law's son, she had raised him for ten years. From now on, the times they would meet could likely be counted on one hand. Tears welled in her eyes as sorrow clouded her heart.  

His uncle pulled her into an embrace, his own gaze distant and heavy with emotion.

A streak of sword light soared from the square, carrying the newly selected disciples away from Baishi Town and deep into the heart of Red Maple Valley.  

Standing on the broad, iron-like flying sword, the young disciples buzzed with excitement, though a hint of nervousness flickered in their eyes. The wind brushed past them as the scenery below gradually shrank into the distance. Qi Chuan tapped the solid surface beneath his feet—this was far from the legendary flying swords that could slay enemies from a thousand miles away.  

"Probably just a standard flight artifact shaped like a sword," he mused.  

**[100x Multiplier System Loading: 81%]**  

A line of text appeared before his eyes—another feature he had recently discovered. The system interface could be hidden or revealed at will, which was quite convenient.  

"Progressing quickly. Already past 80%."  

With a thought, the text faded away. Qi Chuan then turned his attention to the immortal master standing at the sword's tip, robes fluttering majestically in the wind.  

"Immortal Master!" Qi Chuan bowed slightly before speaking up.  

"What is it?" The robed immortal master turned, his demeanor calm and composed.  

"I have a family letter here. Would you be so kind as to deliver it to my Second Grandfather? I would be deeply grateful." Qi Chuan presented the letter.  

"Your Second Grandfather is also a cultivator in the clan? What is his name?" The immortal master took the letter casually.  

"Qi Bai Cang."  

"Ah, him." Recognition flashed in the immortal master's eyes. With barely over a hundred cultivators in the Qi family, everyone knew each other. Though he wasn't particularly close to Qi Bai Cang, he nodded. "I'll pass it along."  

"Many thanks, Immortal Master. May I ask how my Second Grandfather fares in the sect?"  

"Your Second Grandfather suffered an injury in his early years. His cultivation remains at the third level of Qi Refinement."  

Qi Refinement had ten stages, and the third level was still in the early phase.  

"I... see. Thank you for telling me."  

Qi Chuan didn't know what else to say. So the uncle's much-boasted Second Grandfather was only at Qi Refinement Level 3? It seemed he couldn't rely too much on this relative. If he wanted to pursue immortality, he'd have to depend on his own efforts.  

The sword light soon descended upon a picturesque mountain peak deep within Red Maple Valley.  

Standing before a grand hall, Qi Chuan and the others looked up at the plaque above the entrance: **"Hall of Transmission."** The air here felt fresher, likely due to the dense spiritual energy.  

Led inside, they were greeted by an elderly, white-haired man—the Qi family's Transmission Elder. A few other young disciples, likely from other mortal towns, were already present. Qi Chuan wondered about their spiritual roots—surely they weren't all low-grade like his group?  

"Excellent, excellent. Fine seedlings for cultivation indeed," the elder said, stroking his beard with a benevolent smile. "We elders will eventually pass on, and the future of the Qi family rests upon your shoulders. This year's selection—both in quantity and quality—is quite promising. It seems our family's fortunes are on the rise."  

As a high-level Qi Refinement cultivator, the Transmission Elder held one of the highest positions in the clan. Inspired by his words, Qi Li, Qi Huo, and the others burned with determination, vowing to achieve greatness and bring glory to their family.

Meanwhile, Qi Chuan kept his eyes fixed on the nearly complete loading bar, patiently awaiting the arrival of his golden finger.
