# Chapter 715: Defying Fate, the Cycle of Life and Death Never Ceases

On Han Shi’s side, the cracks on the surface of the Niyuan Xuanjian Mirror multiplied, spreading like a spider’s web. The Beiming Xuanjing embedded in the back of the mirror flickered rapidly, its light waxing and waning unpredictably.

The layer of illusory simulation protecting him began to fluctuate violently, appearing and disappearing intermittently. An even more terrifying chill of death and a spatial tearing force instantly pierced through. Han Shi grunted in pain, and even his Innate Sword Body was suddenly covered in fine, white marks.

He felt as if he were about to die. The shadow of death had never been so clear.

“It’s going to shatter!”

A warning screamed in Han Shi’s mind, and a sense of despair nearly consumed him. He did not want to die. He could even hear the faint groans of the ancient mirror’s internal structure, groaning under a burden it could no longer bear.

At that moment, Xu Yunfan, who had been monitoring the situation closely, moved. A sharp light flashed in his eyes without the slightest hesitation. His right index finger, resting on his knee, pointed into the void.

Inside Han Shi, far away in the passage of the Reincarnation Underworld Gate, a majestic, irresistible divine power of the Celestial Thunder erupted. This power did not originate from Han Shi himself; it was forcibly channeled by Xu Yunfan through the Attribute Panel’s control channel, ignoring the barriers of space and the laws of reincarnation, and projected directly from his main body.

The vast spiritual power of a Golden Core True Lord forcibly propped open the last sliver of the Niyuan Xuanjian’s barrier, transforming it into a tough, purple-gold lightning aura that enveloped Han Shi’s entire body. Simultaneously, this force grabbed Han Shi, as if by an invisible giant hand, and violently yanked him backward at a speed that surpassed the turbulence within the passage.

*Pfft!*

The moment the Niyuan Xuanjian completed its final mission, it could no longer withstand the pressure from both inside and out. The mirror’s surface completely shattered into dust, and the Soul-Nourishing Wood Heart at the back cracked with several deep fissures. The seven Beiming Xuanjing lost their light and fell off one by one.

With a flash of light, the disheveled Han Shi was forcibly ripped out of the Underworld passage and slammed heavily onto the cold, black jade floor of the Celestial Thunder Palace. He coughed violently, a trickle of blood tinged with a cold aura seeping from the corners of his mouth. His black robe was torn in many places, and his Innate Sword Body was covered in fine scratches and frost.

In his hand, only the broken frame of the Niyuan Xuanjian and a few dull fragments remained.

“Xu Yunfan!”

Han Shi jerked his head up, his eyes burning with a raging fire. His gaze was one that wished to tear the person on the cloud platform to shreds. “Do you treat my life as if it were straw?! Was once not enough that you had to do it again?! This damn mirror is completely useless!” His voice was hoarse with anger and fear.

Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes. His indifferent gaze swept over the maddened Han Shi without a single ripple. The vengeful sword intent within him grew even more refined. This was a good way to nurture his sword intent. The more intense Han Shi’s vengeful sword intent became, the more感悟 he could share with his clone, and thus, the more Xu Yunfan could comprehend.

With this thought, Xu Yunfan raised his hand in a grabbing motion. The fragments of the Niyuan Xuanjian in Han Shi’s hand and scattered on the ground flew uncontrollably into his palm. He didn’t even glance at Han Shi again, as if the other’s tearful accusations were merely a breeze blowing over a hill, leaving Han Shi so stifled he felt like vomiting blood. The other’s attitude was completely that of looking at an insect. How could the naturally arrogant Han Shi endure this?

Xu Yunfan’s attention, however, was entirely focused on the fragments, which still bore the erosion marks of Underworld laws, as Han Shi continued to complain incessantly.

“You are truly noisy,” Xu Yunfan said, slightly displeased. “If not for this body, you would already be a mindless banner spirit in the Star Spirit Banner. To be able to live and serve as a test subject is where your value lies.”

His fingertips glowed with a faint light as he carefully examined the direction of each crack on the fragments, the residual traces of energy node collapses, and the subtle characteristics of the Underworld death qi attached to them.

Han Shi was choked into a state of chest tightness by that icy gaze and those words. With nowhere to vent his full rage, he could only clench his fists tightly, his fingernails digging deep into his palm and leaving bloody marks. The vengeful sword intent around him churned like layer upon layer of waves, but in the end, it did not erupt. He knew that resistance was futile. In the face of absolute power and control, his anger and his life were nothing more than a line of data in the other’s experimental log.

A profound sense of helplessness and numbness, like an icy tide, began to drown the flames in his heart. He gradually fell silent.

Xu Yunfan was immersed in the analysis of the fragments for a long time, his spiritual sense deeply integrated with the Attribute Panel, repeatedly deducing the cause of the failure. Suddenly, a sharp light flashed in his eyes, as if he had captured a key point.

“So that’s how it is…” Xu Yunfan suddenly understood. “The polarity sequence of the Beiming Xuanjing was disturbed by the temporal-spatial turbulence. The conversion of the Yin-Reversing and Yang-Embracing nodes mentioned in the Nine Netherheart Manual has a 0.5-instant law vacuum at the core of the death qi vortex. The previous combination of patterns did not adequately account for this.”

Several key problems that had been troubling him, after being combined with this real-world combat data and information from the ancient text fragments, were suddenly resolved. Indeed, practice is the sole criterion for testing truth.

“Another attempt in half a month,” Xu Yunfan said. He put away the fragments and closed his eyes again, his spiritual sense sinking into deduction and reconstruction. The rare ores and spiritual woods piled up like mountains within the Celestial Thunder Palace began to fly under his spiritual sense’s control. The Eight Scenery Cloud Qi and the Celestial Thunder Fire intertwined, and a new refinement had already begun.

Within the palace, only Han Shi’s heavy breathing and the roar of melting and forging spiritual materials remained.

Half a month later.

The scene was identical. The Celestial Thunder Palace, the cloud platform, and below it stood the expressionless Han Shi.

Xu Yunfan tossed him a dark, ancient mirror whose exterior was almost identical to the previous one, but whose back had even more complex and profound runes, and whose surface had a deep, reserved luster.

Han Shi looked at the new Niyuan Xuanjian in his hand, his eyes empty. There was no longer the suspicion of the first time, nor the fury of the last. He knew that resistance was useless; any rebellion was a joke in the face of Xu Yunfan’s absolute power and control. He was even too lazy to ask another question, merely taking the ancient mirror woodenly, as if accepting a tool that had nothing to do with him.

Driven by Xu Yunfan’s invisible will, he turned around again and, without hesitation, leaped into the Reincarnation Underworld Gate that seemed capable of devouring everything.

The familiar, violent turbulence; the familiar, bone-eroding chill. Han Shi numbly urged his spiritual power into the new mirror. The dragon-scale patterns on the mirror’s surface lit up, and a cold, clear brilliance once again constructed a barrier.

However, after penetrating only one-third of the distance from last time, the familiar *cracking* sound rang out again. Fine cracks appeared once more on the mirror’s surface, though their location and speed of spread were slightly different.

Han Shi’s mouth twisted into a bitter, cold smile; he no longer had the energy to curse in his heart. *As expected… it’s the same again.* He closed his eyes, preparing to迎接 the pain of being torn apart and the imminent forced recall.

Inside the Celestial Thunder Palace on Mount Celestial Thunder, Xu Yunfan frowned slightly. The real-time monitoring of the Attribute Panel had issued another alert. But this time, he did not act immediately as he had before.

*‘Crack generation pattern changed. Concentrated around the Soul-Stabilizing Pearl on the mirror’s handle.’*

*‘The simulated illusion shows a phase shift when dealing with high-frequency law ripples.’*

*‘The buffering efficiency of the Soul-Nourishing Wood Heart has increased to 85% of the expected value, but it still does not meet the standard.’*
