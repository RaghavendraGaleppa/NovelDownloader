# Chapter 1: I Have a Synthesis Panel

"Is this... my Golden Finger?"

A sharp glint flashed in Su Yu's eyes.

*Ding-a-ling!*

The dismissal bell rang.

Su Yu grabbed his school bag and dashed towards the school gate.

In a dilapidated rental room, Su Yu, panting, put down his bag and excitedly gazed at the Synthesis Panel that only he could see.

"I wonder what good stuff this Synthesis Panel can create."

Su Yu searched around, found two identical blank sheets of paper, and carefully placed them into the Synthesis Panel.

Immediately, below the golden synthesis grid, rows of text appeared.

"Common White Paper: Truly a very common sheet of white paper!"

"Synthesize?"

Su Yu suppressed his inner excitement.

"Synthesize!"

Su Yu pressed the synthesis button. A flash of light erupted, and within the golden synthesis frame, a pristine, flawlessly white sheet of paper appeared.

"Refined White Paper: A finely processed sheet of white paper!"

Su Yu mused, "It seems that even synthesizing ordinary items doesn't produce anything significantly better; it only offers an improvement upon the original basis."

A moment later, with another flash of golden light, two Blood Qi Pills disappeared, and in their place, within the golden Synthesis Panel, a deep crimson medicinal pill appeared.

A line of small text automatically popped up.

"Blood Refining Pill: A Rank 2 medicinal pill, capable of greatly enhancing the body's Blood Qi intensity. Effects diminish with excessive consumption!"

Su Yu's eyes lit up.

Success!

Su Yu took the Blood Refining Pill from the golden Synthesis Panel and took a deep breath.

Just by inhaling, he could sense the rich medicinal aroma emanating from the deep crimson pill. It was so potent that even the Blood Qi within his body began to surge.

"This must be good stuff!"

"I just don't know what the effects are like yet."

Su Yu murmured, a hint of determination flashing in his eyes.

"Who cares! Only by becoming stronger can I earn more money!"

With that, Su Yu consumed the Blood Refining Pill.

The pill melted in his mouth, transforming into a warm current that surged through his entire body.

Su Yu only felt his whole body warm up, and then, his Blood Qi began to roil.
