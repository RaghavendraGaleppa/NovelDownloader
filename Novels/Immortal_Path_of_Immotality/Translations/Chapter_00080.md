# Chapter 80: Preparing to Depart  

"Rigged! This is absolutely rigged!"  

The red-faced monk was filled with righteous indignation as the Joy Buddha statue he had almost secured slipped through his fingers. He wanted to shout and demand justice, but when he saw the dangerous glint in the eyes of the auction host, Elder Zhang, and noticed the Foundation Establishment experts stationed around the auction house watching him closely—clearly ready to intervene if he caused trouble—he swallowed his words.  

The other cultivators in the hall also watched the scene with strange expressions, but none dared to voice any objections.  

After all, it was none of their business. Those with lower cultivation didn’t dare to make a fuss, and those with higher cultivation still had their sights set on the remaining treasures. Offending the host would be unwise.  

As for the so-called "rigging"? One bidder sat in a private box on the second floor, while the other was stuck in the common seating area. One had connections; the other didn’t. Anyone with eyes could see the difference. A little favoritism was hardly surprising—this was the world of cultivation, where the strong preyed on the weak. Absolute fairness was a fantasy.  

Up in the private box, Lin Shan was overjoyed. He almost wanted to hug Elder Zhang’s leg in gratitude.  

*Having a backer in the cultivation world really makes all the difference!*  

Hmm? That monk downstairs... Why is he staring at me like that? Looks like he’s not too happy...  

Ignoring the red-faced monk’s furious glare, Lin Shan grabbed the stunned receptionist beside him and hurried to the front desk to settle his payment.  

What he didn’t know was that in a room on the third floor, where the imperial envoy of the Great Song Dynasty resided, Princess Guo and the middle-aged man in brocade robes exchanged shocked glances.  

They had recognized Lin Shan’s voice. What stunned them was that he could actually produce **1,600 spirit stones**—a staggering sum!  

*"He must have obtained some incredible legacy in Dongting Lake,"* they both thought, their speculations eerily aligned.  

Meanwhile, the red-faced monk who had been bidding against Lin Shan stared coldly at the second-floor box before turning to leave.  

Before departing, a sinister smirk curled at the corners of his lips.  

*"Good... Very good. The legacy statue of my sect carries a traceable imprint. Wherever you go, I’ll find you. Just wait, brat..."*  

---  

Unbeknownst to Lin Shan, his single bid had drawn the attention of two separate factions.  

At the front desk, he was enthusiastically haggling with three auction house staff members.  

"The payment for the Purple Spirit Fruit seeds is waived, plus three months of my salary in advance. With the staff discount, that’s exactly **1,625 spirit stones**!"  

"What’s wrong? You don’t look too happy. Should I calculate it again?"  

The female attendants exchanged bewildered glances.  

*You’ve been working here for less than a day, and you’re already demanding three months’ salary in advance? Do you really think the higher-ups will approve this?*  

To their astonishment, the attendant who had gone upstairs to consult returned shortly after.  

"Elder Zuo approved it."  

Now, they all stared at Lin Shan as if he were some rare creature. Elder Zhang’s favoritism was one thing, but even Elder Zuo was indulging him? Did this guy have some hidden background?  

Two of the attendants even began eyeing him with newfound interest.  

*Not even twenty years old, already at late-stage Qi Refining, handsome, and with powerful connections... He’d make a perfect cultivation partner!*  

Subtly, they started batting their eyelashes at him.  

---  

Lin Shan didn’t bother watching the rest of the auction. The final treasures would either be snatched up by Golden Core cultivators or wealthy sects—far beyond his reach.  

After the auction concluded, Elder Zhang endured Lin Shan’s relentless flattery before finally shooing him away.  

---  

Three days later, at the misty formation gate of Yichuan, Elder Zhang waved his sleeve impatiently.  

"Enough, enough! Stop seeing me off! I can fly on my own—no need for you to drag me along on foot. Get lost already!"  

Lin Shan bowed sincerely.  

"Safe travels, Elder. When I achieve great things in the future, I’ll definitely visit you in Yinchuan!"  

With a final wave, Elder Zhang summoned a purple flying sword and soared into the sky, soon disappearing into the horizon.  

Lin Shan watched until the distant speck vanished completely before finally turning back.  

And where would he return to?  

Naturally, the high-end residence in the city center!  

Broke and with his previous cave dwelling’s lease expired, Lin Shan was technically in debt to the auction house for three months’ worth of wages. But thankfully, Elder Zhang had rented a premium cave dwelling in the city center for **30 spirit stones per month**, and there were still a few days left on the lease.  

Seeing Lin Shan’s dire financial straits, Elder Zhang transferred the lease to him before leaving and even generously prepaid another three months.  

Once again, Lin Shan was reminded of how crucial it was to have a powerful backer in the cultivation world.  

Otherwise, after spending **1,625 spirit stones** on the Buddha statue, he might have been forced to pack up and leave Yichuan altogether.  

As for the Joy Buddha statue he had acquired, it brought him an unexpected surprise.  

**[Joy Buddha Statue]**  
**Quality:** Postnatal  
**Description:** An artifact used by the Joy God Monarch to absorb mortal worship. The channel for faith has been severed, cutting off all external connections long ago.  
**Enhancement Cost:** 4 points  
**Ancient Aura:** 10 points  
**Absorb?**  

Lin Shan didn’t hesitate.  

With this absorption, his Ancient Aura reserves returned to **17 points**.  

The description mentioned a "Joy God Monarch" who, much like the Buddha of the immortal realm, had once collected faith. However, with the channel severed, Lin Shan had no way of knowing whether this so-called "Joy God Monarch" was alive or dead.  

But given that Golden Core cultivators were addressed as "True Persons" and Nascent Soul cultivators as "True Monarchs," the title "Joy **God** Monarch" suggested...  

Lin Shan didn’t dwell on it. If the faith channel were still active, he wouldn’t dare provoke such an entity—he knew his limits.  

But since the connection was broken, this matter had nothing to do with him. Besides, the Joy Sect had long been annihilated. It wasn’t like the Joy God Monarch could reach through the void to kill him...  

---  

Back in his cave dwelling, Lin Shan began a three-month cultivation session.  

Given his innate talent, progressing from the seventh to the ninth level of Qi Refining would normally take **thirty years** in the outside world.  

But the spiritual energy density in the city center’s cave dwelling was **twice** that of his previous urban residence, **six times** that of the suburbs, and a staggering **thirty times** that of the mortal world!  

Originally meant for Foundation Establishment cultivators, this environment allowed a Qi Refiner like Lin Shan to cultivate at breakneck speed. He estimated reaching **Qi Refining perfection** in just **one year**.  

The sheer disparity was staggering—this was the power of wealth!  

Lin Shan didn’t spend all his time in secluded cultivation, however. Having taken over Elder Zhang’s position as the auction house’s chief appraiser, he made regular visits.  

The other appraisers had been waiting for him. The moment Elder Zhang left, they conspired to put him in his place.  

They gathered obscure and rarely seen treasures from the auction house’s collections, pretending they couldn’t identify them, and demanded that Lin Shan—as the chief appraiser—pass judgment.  

Their plan was to humiliate him in front of the entire staff, tarnish his reputation, and force him out.  

But they hadn’t accounted for Lin Shan’s cheat-like ability.  

With the Enhancement Panel, he could identify anything with a single touch, explaining each item’s origins and properties in meticulous detail. The appraisers were dumbfounded—this guy’s appraisal skills were inhuman!  

Undeterred, they escalated their sabotage, deliberately altering some items beyond recognition before presenting them to Lin Shan.  

Yet again, the Enhancement Panel crushed their schemes effortlessly.  

A month later, Elder Zuo—who had been studying the turtle shell fragment—made a breakthrough in his research. He even summoned Lin Shan for another round of cultivation guidance.  

Now that the auction house staff knew Lin Shan had ties to Elder Zuo, no one dared challenge him again.  

Three months passed in the blink of an eye.  

Lin Shan successfully advanced to the **eighth level of Qi Refining**.  

But his cave dwelling’s lease had expired, and this time, he was truly penniless.  

"It’s time to return to the Great Song capital."
