Chapter 102: Deduce the "Mysterious Method of Karma Flame Red Lotus", Is There a Dish Made with Imperial Jelly?

Meanwhile, in the hot pot restaurant under the bright moon.

"You... are about to break through again?" Li Mo quietly opened his eyes. The two-colored internal energy circulated, giving the girl's complexion an otherworldly glow. The cold and enchanting aura harmonized at this moment.

In the past two days, he had sensed that Ying Bing's internal energy was becoming more solid day by day. He hadn't expected it to happen so soon. Ying Bing opened her eyes, silently gazing at him. The two remained silent, the cold aura growing more intense.

In Li Mo's perception, his internal energy could no longer balance with Ying Bing's because she had started to condense her energy into liquid.

"You focus on breaking through." Downstairs, Zuo Qiu Yang and Xiao Qin were startled by the commotion upstairs.

"She..." Zuo Qiu Yang began.

"Yes, she's condensing her energy into liquid," Li Mo nodded.

Zuo Qiu Yang was taken aback. "She's only sixteen."

Xiao Qin felt a bitter taste in his mouth. He had just stabilized his internal energy in the Condensed Qi realm and was still far from the Jade Liquid realm. This was thanks to his teacher's guidance and the numerous elixirs he had consumed to enhance his internal energy. Ying Bing, on the other hand, hadn't seemed to practice much.

"Disciple, the gap between people can be greater than that between humans and dogs," Qian Xing Wu Zun said, as if only now coming to his senses.

"The gap between you and the geniuses of the Central Divine Continent is the same as the gap between them and her." Xiao Qin was speechless for a moment before turning to Li Mo. "Li brother, you..."

"I've also reached the peak of Condensed Qi," Li Mo smiled. Since they were dual cultivating, their internal energies needed to be balanced.

Xiao Qin was taken aback. "Old Xiao feels a bit closed off." Qian Xing Wu Zun comforted him, "When I first entered the martial path, I wasn't as talented as the geniuses of the Central Divine Continent either. When you enter the Observing Spirit realm, if you can achieve the highest境界 of the 'Thousand Forms Decree,' you may still be able to catch up to them."

Just then, the familiar field covered the area, binding the cold tide within the hot pot restaurant. It was Shang Wu. With her help, Zuo Qiu Yang and Xiao Qin felt a bit more at ease. The commotion from the breakthrough didn't leak out.

"The ingredients in the kitchen are safe," Zuo Qiu Yang sighed in relief. Xiao Qin looked eastward, remaining silent for a moment before saying, "Tomorrow, we probably won't need to open the door." Li Mo nodded in agreement.

Zuo Qiu Yang was taken aback. Following Li Mo's gaze, he saw a firework exploding in the city, forming the emblem of the Fine Rain Tower. The Uninterrupted Trial had ended. According to their agreement, they would head to Ling Jiang Pier tomorrow to kill Xiao Mi Tuo. With Ying Bing's breakthrough, their plan to quickly kill their target had gained an additional layer of assurance.

The three discussed their plan before retiring to rest and prepare.

Li Mo shook his head, sitting down on the ground. His consciousness sank, and he attempted to condense his internal energy into liquid like Ying Bing. However, it exploded, and his internal energy dispersed again. He realized that his path to condensing internal energy might not be the same as Ying Bing's.

Using his accumulated twenty years of martial arts comprehension, Li Mo injected it into his understanding of the "Mysterious Method of Karma Flame Red Lotus." The comprehension revealed the name of the martial art and hinted at its profoundness.

As he continued to inject his comprehension, Li Mo gained a deeper understanding of the "Mysterious Method of Karma Flame Red Lotus." It was not just a martial art but a complete仙法 (immortal method) that used extreme destruction to give birth to vitality.

Li Mo's comprehension was exhausted, and he finally managed to grasp the entry-level understanding of the "Mysterious Method of Karma Flame Red Lotus." He began to refine the lotus seed in his thirty-six main meridians, and the scene of unity between heaven and man reappeared around him.

Upstairs, the波动 from Ying Bing's breakthrough gradually dissipated. She seemed to have changed, yet remained the same, still possessing that icy beauty. She walked to the window, and Li Mo's figure practicing martial arts appeared in her eyes.

She thought about Qian Xing Wu Zun's words: when Li Mo entered the Inner Scene realm, he would become very strong. Those who could achieve unity between heaven and man were outstanding in the Inner Scene realm.

Ying Bing was walking a different path, one that even the elders of the Qing Yuan Sect and Shang Guan Wen Cang hadn't anticipated. She was using the nine-colored primordial phoenix soul to gather the Tai Yin moon phoenix god.

To return to the top of the rankings, she needed to lead in terms of realm. With the stage-by-stage rewards of Imperial Jelly, she should be able to achieve this. "Is there a dish made with Imperial Jelly?" she wondered.
