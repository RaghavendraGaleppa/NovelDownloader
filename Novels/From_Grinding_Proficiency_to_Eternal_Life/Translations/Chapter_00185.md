# Chapter 185: Below Xuan Steel City

Half a cup of tea later, Xu Yunfan looked at the corpses strewn across the ground. With a slight flick of his wrist, he shook the blood off the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer.

Listening to the tiger's roar echoing in his ears, Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. Carrying the bronze cage, he rushed toward Tiangong City.

Tiangong City's gates were guarded at all times by three hundred and sixty scorching fire crossbows. On the walls, there were also over a dozen newly installed mechanical beasts from the Mechanism Hall—enough to delay the beast, buying the Sect Master time for Hong Baichuan to make a move.

This tiger demon might have been a formidable figure in the past, but in this era, even Xu Yunfan could provoke it, let alone a Marrow Cleansing Master.

Rushing all the way, Xu Yunfan stomped his foot. As earth and stones splashed, his body shot out like an arrow loosed from a hundred-stone bow.

He tilted his head slightly, glancing behind him. The three-zhang-tall demon tiger was truly like a fierce tiger descending the mountain. Trees along its path snapped one after another. Its momentum shook the earth and mountains, terrifying to behold.

One led, the other followed.

Thirty li of treacherous mountain roads were as level as flat ground to him. In the blink of an eye, he arrived outside Tiangong City.

Without the slightest hesitation, Xu Yunfan pulled the whistle arrow from his right waist and shot it into the sky.

*Whoosh!*

The sharp whistling sound of the arrow instantly spread throughout Tiangong City.

Qi Huan, who was on watch on the city wall today, looked toward the source of the sound and saw Xu Yunfan rushing over from the distance.

Qi Huan's five fingers gripped the crenellations of the city wall. The morning dew condensed between the blue brick seams soaked into his bracers, actually freezing into a thin layer of frost. If someone touched his body now, they would find it icy cold.

His eyes moved slightly, a barely perceptible twisted black line flashing through his gaze.

"Senior Brother Qi, look at the thing behind Senior Brother Xu!"

Qi Huan seemed not to hear, his eyes fixed on the familiar figure in the dust.

The bronze cage on Xu Yunfan's back emitted a strange green glow in the morning sun. Every step he took left a deep pit in the rammed earth of the official road. However, his attention was mostly gathered on the cage wrapped in Xu Yunfan's clothes.

The thing inside made him exceptionally agitated. He almost couldn't suppress it, and fine scales began to appear on his cheeks.

"Senior Brother Qi! Look behind Senior Brother Xu!"

Qi Huan's gaze shifted. Thirty zhang behind Xu Yunfan, a twisted shadow was skimming along the ground.

The thing's limbs were bent backward like a spider's, its rotting tiger skin wrapped around a disproportionate torso, and the exposed muscles were a corpse-green color!

When he saw its appearance clearly, he couldn't help but twitch his eyebrows.

"Demon..."

*Crack.*

A piece of the crenellation crumbled in Qi Huan's hand.

He clearly saw the rotting flesh falling off the corpse tiger as it leaped. Those dark red chunks of meat hit the ground and actually rose wisps of black smoke. The surrounding weeds withered and curled at a visible speed.

What was even more terrifying was the beast's forehead. Where the "King" character pattern should have been, a fist-sized tumor bulged, its surface covered with earthworm-like blue veins.

"It's... it's a demon!" The voice of the junior brother beside him trembled. "The day before yesterday, I heard the boatmen of the Canal Gang say that a large tomb in Shuzhou suddenly collapsed, and a demon crawled out."

"Archers, string your bows!"

The fierce shout startled the crows perched on the wall. The玄钢 (Xuan Steel) city wall of Tiangong City shook instantly, and machine ports sprang open, revealing three hundred and sixty scorching fire crossbows. The sound of the mechanisms turning was like a plague of locusts swarming.

Qi Huan reached back and steadied his trembling junior brother's shoulder, but his own palm was already sweating.

This wasn't fear. When he saw the hideous demon, saliva had unknowingly started to fill his mouth.

He wanted to eat it.

He shook his head, suppressing the discomfort in his heart.

As the chief true disciple of the Hidden Blade Pavilion in Tiangong City, he had seen the Poison Corpse people in the miasma of Diannan and the wolf bandits roaming the Western Regions, but he had never seen a monster that violated the natural order like this.

The sound of muscles tearing was clearly audible as the corpse tiger ran. It was clearly a corpse that should have long since decayed, yet it was now fiercer than a living creature.

The spiritual energy of the world is reviving, and demons are rising...

"Load the armor-piercing arrows!"

Qi Huan tore the copper tally from his waist and threw it at the command pillar. The sound of metal striking stone woke the dazed archers. "Prepare the winch for the吊桥 (drawbridge) below!"

He forced himself to stare at the approaching demon.

"Senior Brother Qi, Senior Brother Xu is almost at the moat!"

Xu Yunfan raced across the floating stakes of the moat. The medicinal fragrance seeping from the bronze cage left an invisible trail behind him, making the demon tiger behind him even more frenzied.

Tiangong City's Xuan Steel-cast gate was slowly lowering. Half-extended from the wall, the three hundred and sixty seven-shot scorching fire crossbows sounded their mechanisms simultaneously. The精钢 (fine steel) arrow grooves reflected the cold moonlight.

This gate faced the Ghost Weeping Abyss on the other side of Tiangong City. On normal days, besides the Tiangong Cave disciples, there were no traveling merchants, so Xu Yunfan naturally chose this entrance to enter.

"Loose!"

At Qi Huan's command, a sky full of fire arrows wove a golden-red net.

The arrowheads were dipped in the black oil refined by the Tiangong Department, which ignited upon meeting the wind, enveloping the tiger demon in a several-zhang-wide ball of fire.

The beast's rotting tiger skin curled and peeled away in the flames. Finally, it broke through the large团 (ball) of fire. Its fur was gone, leaving only muscle fibers constantly stretching and contracting with its movements.

The smoke of gunpowder had not yet cleared when a harsh grinding sound of metal tore through the night sky.

The demon tiger's sharp claws hooked into the cracks of the city wall bricks, actually climbing three feet up the vertical wall.

Xu Yunfan, who had rushed into the暗门 (secret door) just as the Xuan Steel city wall opened, narrowed his pupils. He had not expected the scorching fire crossbows to only burn off the beast's fur with no other effect.

"Open the Earth Dragon Gate!"

Hong Baichuan's fierce shout came from inside the city.

Mo Shisan was also thrown down from a high altitude by a team of disciples riding a giant kite. When he saw the demon tiger about to climb the city wall below, he shuddered and immediately began operating the control panel beside the battlements.

In an instant, seven mechanical beasts over two zhang tall burst out of the ground. The gears in the chest of the墨玉 (Ink Jade) tiger-type beast spun rapidly. The "King" character pattern on its forehead suddenly split open, shooting out thirty-six black gold bone-piercing nails.

The steel tails of the leopard-type beasts on the left and right swept across, and chains as thick as a bowl's mouth, covered in barbs, sealed off the demon tiger's retreat.

When Xu Yunfan leaped onto the battlements, he saw the demon tiger's lower jaw bone dislocate unnaturally.

This demon actually made a movement that was difficult for a living creature to perform. Its iron-boned tiger claws hooked onto the Ink Jade tiger-type beast's skull, and the sharp tiger fingertips precisely pierced into the driving gears.

With a grating sound of metal distortion, the thousand-jin mechanical beast knelt heavily to the ground.

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. "Senior Brother Mo, is this all you've managed to modify these past few days? These piles of scrap metal?"

Mo Shisan's face instantly flushed red. He jumped up and said, "These are all old models, I haven't had time to replace them yet! My humanoid mechanical armor is still not ready to be taken out! Who knew you would provoke a demon and bring it in here! You..."

"Senior Brother Mo, don't say I'm a jinx. I could have beaten this demon tiger myself."

"If you could beat it, why did you bring it here?!"

"It hurts. Besides, Tiangong City has countless mechanisms. I know no less than you do! I naturally knew this would save effort. Afterward, we can just have the civil engineering brothers from the Tiangong Department recast it."
