# Chapter 256: The Best Feeling Thing, The鸣蛟 Stir!

Li Mo and his companions dismounted from the Peng bird at the edge of the鸣蛟 Dragon Clan's territory.

As this was the territory of a sworn enemy, the Peng could not venture further. If discovered by the strong experts of the鸣蛟 Clan, it would likely be struck down.

Watching the Peng demon fly away, Li Mo fell into deep thought.

He had been to the military camp in Baoping Town. With the border troops there and a Divine Observation Realm expert guarding it, they could have captured the Peng demon long ago, or at least driven it away.

So why did they allow it to roam Mount Baoping, causing panic among the people?

The group walked on foot across the land known as the Black Water Marshes.

Even in this place, often plagued by mud and heavy rain, there were human towns, though no longer any garrison troops.

The humans who lived here for generations all worshipped 'Witch Spirits'.

Different towns offered prayers to different Witch Spirits, each with strange and varied functions beyond protecting the peace.

For instance, right now.

After walking for five days through the mountains, a relatively flat town finally appeared.

The entire town was built by a lake, and the faint sound of exotic fishing songs drifted from the waters.

"This is the last town before entering the鸣蛟 Clan's territory," Huang Donglai said, looking at the map with certainty.

"The clothes here in the Black Water Marshes have such strange fabric," Murong Xiao said, taking off the silk hat covering his head. After shaking it once, all the water droplets slid off, leaving it dry and gleaming with a faint, magnificent luster.

Huang Donglai explained, "Different lands nurture different people. This Pearl White Lotus Silk naturally repels moisture and is extremely valuable."

"The feel is truly amazing. It's simply the best feeling thing in the world," Murong Xiao said, stroking the silk hat.

"That's not true!" Li Mo suddenly interjected, his expression firm.

His look made it clear he wasn't joking.

"Then what is the softest and smoothest thing in the world?" Murong Xiao asked, confused.

"Ah..." Li Mo sighed, shaking his head as he took the silk hat and began to knead it gently.

This technique couldn't just be called similar; it was practically a massage...

"???"

Murong Xiao was completely baffled, racking his brain but unable to understand what Li Mo's actions meant.

Brother Li's knowledge was truly beyond his reach.

"This fabric is quite good, much more comfortable than Black Cloud Gauze. What do you think about using it to make stockings?" Li Mo asked, seemingly without thinking.

Indeed, it wasn't just his hands that had a mind of their own; now his mouth did too!

"???"

This time, not only Murong Xiao was stunned, but Huang Donglai was as well.

"You guys know, my hammer skills are decent, so I've been quite interested in forging lately," Li Mo said, clearing his throat. "Forging such delicate items is a great test of technique. I could buy a few thousand catties to practice with."

He put the hat back on Murong Xiao's head.

Murong Xiao's eyes were filled with wisdom and surprise. He had trained extensively with Elder Han He on the Divine Weapon Peak. His master had said that once he could forge a合格 (qualified) Black Cloud Gauze inner armor, he could be considered a skilled artisan.

Brother Li was choosing to start with the even more difficult Pearl White Lotus Silk?!

"..." Huang Donglai thought to himself, *What does this have to do with forging? This is weaving!*

"Brother Li, it takes ten thousand catties of lotus roots to produce two ounces of silk."

"Forget about a few thousand catties; the entire town's output doesn't even reach twenty catties."

"....."

Li Mo looked out towards the lake. He saw figures bending over in the mud. Some women carried infants on their backs, stumbling through the mire, one step deep, one step shallow. They were so dirty it was as if they had grown from the mud themselves.

It was hard to associate the pearl-white lotus silk fabric with the group of people before him.

Li Mo and the other three entered the town.

After spending a large sum of money to purchase a few catties of lotus silk from a traveling merchant, Li Mo's confusion only grew.

---

明明他們手中生產出了如此名貴之物。
Why did women with infants still have to work in the fields?

The merchant, however, enthusiastically said, "Today, there happens to be a Witch Spirit ceremony here. If you aren't in a hurry to travel, why don't you go see it? The Witch Spirit here is very effective; many people believe in it."

"Thank you," Li Mo said, though he wasn't very interested.

Murong Xiao was also uninterested in the所谓的 (so-called) Witch Spirit ceremony. He was now a mix of excited and nervous.

"I wonder if my parents are getting anxious," he said. Since he was born, he had never met his parents.

"Mm... I also hold your father in high regard..." Li Mo said, then couldn't help but ask curiously, "Since your father and mother miss you so much, why didn't they come to see you at the Clear Abyss Sect? How could they let you come to the Southern Frontier alone?"

"Maybe they have their own difficulties. Besides, we're almost there safely," Murong Xiao said with a grin, his heart filled with the joy of about to meet his biological parents.

Li Mo: "....."

If it weren't for the joint enforcement of the Hengyun Sword City and the Drizzle Tower, you'd still be the神子 (Divine Son) of the Summoning Demon Cult.

However.

After so many years apart, it just so happened to be when the Jade Phoenix God descended upon the Southern Frontier that Murong Xiao was suddenly told to return.

It was hard to say there wasn't a connection.

But the reason for it would only be known after arriving at the鸣蛟 Clan's territory.

As they spoke, the group arrived by the marsh, where a tall, weather-beaten altar stood.

They could see the statue on top without even getting close.

The statue was made of stone, with a large head and a small body, and two pairs of eyes. It was grotesque and terrifying.

"Hiss... why does it feel familiar?" Li Mo thought of the Sanxingdui from his past life, but it wasn't an exact match.

Suddenly, he seemed to remember.

It was on the Qunyu Peak!

Among the Divine Observation statues that his beautiful master had shattered, there was one with a similar form.

At that moment, a priest wearing a mask identical to the statue's face was performing a strange dance on the altar.

The people below devoutly offered sacrifices and received a stick of black incense. After lighting it, they prayed fervently, some unable to help but voice their wishes.

"Hope for a bountiful harvest this year..."
"Hope to give birth to a son..."

Li Mo raised an eyebrow.

This Witch Spirit...

He discovered that the Witch Spirit statue gave him a vague feeling of looking at a Divine Observation diagram, yet it was far more诡异 (eerie) than a typical Divine Observation statue.

This didn't seem like a proper deity.

Li Mo recalled that in the other villages they had passed, the Witch Spirits being worshipped were all similar.

"Hope the vicious鸣蛟 don't attack the village anymore..."
"Hope to meet my parents smoothly..."

Huh?

Li Mo turned his head and discovered Murong Xiao was also praying.

*Wait, Brother Murong, the main purpose of this Witch Spirit is to ward off the鸣蛟.*

*And you're praying to it?*

*Even if the Witch Spirit agrees, would the Buddha agree?*

Just then.

*Gurgle, gurgle—*

The sky suddenly darkened. A whirlpool appeared in the lake, rapidly expanding, with a huge, dark shadow inside.

"The鸣蛟 is stirring!"
