# My Undying Cheat - Chapter 91: I Have a Unique Prayer Method.

Putte had just emerged from the prayer sanctuary, feeling invigorated and eager to venture outside and tear the heretical cultists to shreds. He heard that the Pope had re-established contact with the Lord, confirming that the Lord had indeed not abandoned them. *If only the Lord would respond to my prayers*, he mused.

As Putte was lost in thought, he turned into an alleyway. After only a couple of steps, he heard a voice calling out, "Friend, friend..."

Putte looked up to see someone in a white robe not far away. Their head was covered by a hood, and he could vaguely make out a "Sacred Judge's" mask on the face hidden in the hood's shadow.

Putte looked back, finding no one behind him. It seemed the person in front was indeed calling out to him.

"Are you calling me?"

"That's right, it's you, friend."

Putte watched as the person quickly approached. Although he couldn't see their facial expression, he could discern a clear enthusiasm in their tone.

Frowning deeply, he took two steps back, a wary expression on his face. He demanded, "Who are you? Why are you dressed like this? Are you a heretical cultist?!"

This was his usual route home after every prayer, and he had never seen anyone dressed so strangely here before. Recalling recent reports of increased heretical activity, a thought struck him: *Could today be the day Putte fights for the Lord?*

"Friend, don't be nervous. How could I possibly be one of those bastard heretical cultists? I have a unique prayer method here; would you like to know it?" A low voice came from beneath the mask.

Putte didn't relax his guard, but he asked suspiciously, "A unique prayer method?"

"That's right. Using my prayer method can triple the chance of the Lord responding!" The voice beneath the mask was like a demon tempting one to fall, guiding Putte step by step.

"Really?" Putte asked, half-believing, half-doubting.

"Of course, everyone who's used it says it's excellent!"

"Then why are you telling me? Why don't you keep such a good method for yourself?" Putte raised another question. Believers like them wished their faith to be like an emperor's harem, where he favored only one out of three thousand concubines. Putte knew in his heart that if he discovered such a method, he would certainly not share it with anyone.

"Naturally, I wish to spread the Lord's glory and let more people believe in my Lord!" The masked person spoke with conviction and force, as if they could sacrifice themselves for their faith at any moment. "Do you want it or not? If not, I'll have to pass it on to others so more people can perceive the Lord's glory!" The masked person's voice grew impatient.

"Yes, I want it!" Putte quickly replied, feeling secretly ashamed. He had just questioned a saint who was wholeheartedly dedicated to the Lord's cause; it was simply unforgivable.

"You want it? Come closer, this method is difficult to explain verbally." The masked person waved to Putte, who quickly stepped forward. "This method requires not only mentally reciting the Lord's holy name but also visualizing the Lord's valiant form. Come, let me teach you..."

As the masked person spoke, they opened their robe, revealing several pieces of paper with messy drawings on them. Putte leaned his head closer.

After barely a glance, Putte's pupils contracted. He trembled uncontrollably, his face turning crimson from surging blood, and his eyes were streaked with red.

"Th-this... this is the method you spoke of?" Putte stammered, his finger pointing at the papers in the masked person's arms.

What was terrifying was that perhaps the "artist" feared the drawings were too abstract for others to recognize, so they thoughtfully wrote "Lord" in bold red letters on the humanoid creature, and "Sacred Judge" on the creature with six pairs of wings. It was essentially a complete "Lord #* Sacred Judge %@ Horrific" image.

"That's right, isn't it amazing? I'm telling you, if you think of your Lord like this when you pray, He'll definitely respond to you."

Hearing the masked person's proud tone, Putte reached his limit. His eyes glowed with white light, and white flames erupted in his hand, shifting form until a holy sword burning with white fire appeared in his grasp.

"Blasphemer, die!!" Putte roared. Instantly, the holy sword pierced the masked person's body. Flames flared, burning within their internal organs. The masked person's eyes rolled back, and after two weak struggles, all life left them.

"Hmph, hmph..." Putte took a few breaths to calm his furious emotions. He picked up the papers that had flown from the ground, forcefully suppressing the urge to destroy them. These were evidence. Reckless killing was forbidden within the Holy City; it was a rule. Of course, if the opponent was a heretical cultist, it was fine. And these papers were the proof that the person was a cultist. Otherwise, his own suspicion would be very high.

Out of the corner of his eye, Putte suddenly turned. The masked person he had just impaled had actually stood up again. He had clearly felt that person completely lifeless moments ago.

The masked person waved at him. If not for the torn hole in their chest and the papers in his hand, Putte would have almost believed that what had just happened was merely an illusion. Before he could react, the masked person vanished from the spot the next moment, leaving no trace. A gust of wind blew by, making the papers in Putte's hand flutter.

Putte's face turned ashen. *Whoosh!* White flames ignited in his hand, and the papers turned to ash, scattering into the air. Now that the masked person had vanished, these papers would only put him in a dangerous situation. How could he explain this to the Pope? It would be impossible to explain clearly. Putte didn't want to die; he still wanted to dedicate his body to the Lord.

Meanwhile, in a quiet alleyway, a figure suddenly appeared. Wearing a mask, they looked around. Seeing no one, they removed the mask, revealing a handsome face. It was Zhou Tian.

"That strike was really clumsy," he grimaced and rubbed his chest. He still felt as if his internal organs were on fire. Perhaps it was because the other party's cultivation was relatively weak and not precise at all, which resulted in him surviving for a while after being pierced and experiencing considerable pain.

In this Holy City, if he wanted to court death, he could only provoke them by insulting their worshipped Lord. Otherwise, these people wouldn't strike with such heavy hands. Zhou Tian didn't possess any heretical aura, so he had no way to feign it. As their paths diverged, there was no shame in using such methods. Zhou Tian was fundamentally at odds with them.

He quickly concealed the hole in his robe, which he had bought for one white crystal coin.

Zhou Tian walked back to his inn. Today's objective was complete. He would find Musu again after his resurrection count refreshed. He still needed Musu to inquire about Zhang Yi's suppression location; Zhou Tian himself had no way of finding it. In the God-Abandoned Land, Zhou Tian could only rely on his Undying System to keep track of time. Once his resurrection count refreshed, a day had passed.
