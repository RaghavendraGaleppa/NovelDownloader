# Chapter 109: The Day of Rising Fame!

Guyue Peak.

This was a towering, majestic mountain that seemed to scrape the heavens. Yet it had long been shrouded in thick mist, hidden within the vast wetlands of Jiuchuan, invisible even to disciples of the Dao Academy—as if it existed outside this realm.

But today, the mist had dispersed, revealing the peak's true form. Its contours were picturesque, grand and rugged, with ancient trees reaching toward the sky. Golden rocks shimmered brilliantly, while a vast lake at its summit stretched like an ocean, its azure waves surging endlessly. It was as though all the wonders of heaven and earth had converged upon this single peak.

At the summit, amidst drifting clouds, stood a hall of green jade. Jade seats lined its interior, and the lingering melodies of silk and bamboo instruments filled the air, transforming the place into a scene straight out of an immortal's paradise.

"Whoosh!"

"Whoosh!"

Streaks of light descended from all corners of the Dao Academy, each taking their seat according to their affiliated cultivation island. A quick count revealed dozens of figures, many bearing signs of exhaustion from long journeys. Yet as they gazed upon the peak's mystical scenery, anticipation flickered in their eyes.

However, some wore solemn expressions as they observed the confident, unrestrained disciples at the front of the hall.

The front of the jade hall was divided into twelve columns. Excluding the side column, each held one or two figures—men and women alike—all exuding extraordinary presence and unshakable confidence.

The Seven Veins of the Dao Academy: Tiangang, Qingyan, Yingyue, Biluo, Wuxiang, Ruyi, and Yuhu. These seven represented the academy's most formidable factions, its very core, nurturing only the most exceptional talents. They stood in stark contrast to the disciples of the Hidden Dragon Court.

Beyond these seven peaks were the Five Great Clans: Feng, Su, Zhou, Si, and Bian. The relationship between the Seven Veins and the Five Clans was deeply entangled—interwoven yet oppositional, forming a complex web of alliances and rivalries.

Together, these two factions were known as the Master-Disciple and Aristocratic lineages, wielding the true authority of the Dao Academy, backed by the support of Golden Core cultivators.

Apart from them stood the Commoner lineage—disciples of the Hidden Dragon Court. These were neither from aristocratic families nor under the direct tutelage of masters. Left to fend for themselves within the academy, their rise depended entirely on their own fortune and opportunities.

Unless one could forge ties with a Golden Core cultivator, they remained part of the commoner class. Only by achieving Golden Core could one truly break through these social barriers.

Yet attaining Golden Core was an arduous path, which explained the enduring stability of the academy's hierarchy.

Still, the commoner disciples were numerous, and sheer numbers sometimes yielded miracles. Today, the Hidden Dragon Court's Qi Refinement ninth-layer disciples had gathered in full force, their numbers nearly matching those of the Seven Veins and aristocratic families.

Yet despite their presence, the three factions remained silent, forming a tense triangular standoff.

As time passed, the streaks of light entering the jade hall dwindled until nearly all promising Foundation Establishment candidates had arrived.

At this moment, two final streaks of light arrived belatedly.

The first was an exquisitely beautiful woman adorned with tinkling jade ornaments, her skin as pale as snow. A gentle smile graced her lips, yet her eyes occasionally flashed with crimson light, as if she had consumed some mystical fruit, hinting at a hidden, unyielding dominance.

Her appearance drew many gazes.

Bian Chuyao—the favored daughter of the Bian Clan!

Golden Core cultivators lived for a thousand years, and their descendants multiplied endlessly. Even excluding mortals incapable of cultivation, their numbers were vast, each typically residing on their own islands with numerous attendants and guards.

Yet among them, only one or two were truly cherished as the clan's heirs.

For the Bian Clan in this generation, that honor belonged to Bian Chuyao.

Despite being only at Qi Refinement, she had been granted the Yuanyun Valley—a third-grade spiritual island—as her personal cultivation estate, a privilege that left countless cultivators green with envy.

Thus, her arrival naturally attracted widespread attention.

The young man accompanying her also piqued curiosity. But before anyone could discern their relationship, the two separated. Bian Chuyao swiftly took her place at the Bian Clan's seat at the front of the hall, while the young man descended to the commoner section at the rear.

A commoner disciple?

Eyebrows rose among the Seven Veins and aristocratic disciples at the front.

Bian Chuyao, though outwardly approachable, was known for her pride. For her to openly arrive with a commoner disciple, disregarding potential gossip, was highly unusual.

Instantly, speculation about Gu Yuan's identity spread.

Through hushed spiritual exchanges, his background gradually came to light: a disciple from a remote minor sect who had fortuitously earned entry into the Dao Academy through Swordfox Elder's bounty. Without a master or marital ties to any aristocratic family, he appeared utterly unremarkable—save for his striking looks.

Wait… he had advanced from Qi Refinement fourth-layer to the peak of ninth-layer in just five years? And had even grasped the method for Foundation Establishment?

Suddenly, countless eyes turned toward Gu Yuan.

Even the most distinguished figures at the front cast sidelong glances.

Yet Gu Yuan remained as steady as a mountain, sitting in silence, unperturbed by the scrutiny.

But inwardly, he knew: if his plans succeeded, today would mark the end of his obscurity within the Dao Academy.

Today was the day his name would rise and his fame spread!

---

"Dong!"

"Dong!"

"Dong!"

As the jade seats filled, a white jade bell chimed three times, its rich tones washing over the hall like a spring breeze. All conversation ceased.

Then, upon a green jade cushion at the front of the hall, an elderly man in white robes appeared. His hair was white as crane feathers, his face youthful, and his eyes sharp and bright. Yet there was something peculiar about his aura—golden light flickered intermittently through his hair, eyes, and skin, like dazzling bolts of lightning.

Gu Yuan glanced up briefly before lowering his gaze, not daring to look too long.

He recognized this as a sign of someone at the absolute peak of Foundation Establishment, having grasped a sliver of Golden Core essence—just one step away from achieving true Golden Core and a millennium of life!

Though no Golden Core cultivators were present, the academy had sent such a figure to oversee the event, underscoring its importance.

"Disciples, greetings!" The elder's voice was deep but not overbearing. Surveying the hall filled with promising talents, a smile touched his lips.

The disciples returned the greeting in unison.

"Do not be nervous. I am the master of Guyue Peak, entrusted by the Dao Academy's decree to preside over today's Flowing Cloud Banquet. You may address me as Elder Huo."

"Greetings, Elder Huo!" the disciples chorused with a bow.

Pleased by their vibrant energy, Elder Huo's smile deepened, as if reminiscing about his own youth.

"According to academy regulations, today's banquet will feature spiritual fruits and delicacies, and I shall impart wisdom to address your cultivation queries."

"Yet I suspect none of you have come merely for these trifles."

"The path of cultivation is one of contention. The academy's resources are finite, reserved only for the most driven and gifted. Thus, today will bring joy to some and sorrow to others. Such is the nature of our path—the academy cannot guide every disciple to the pinnacle of the Great Dao."

"If any among you should fail today, will there be grievances?" Elder Huo's voice rang out as he scanned the assembly.

"The Great Dao belongs to the bold! This disciple harbors no grievances!" came the unified reply, their confidence soaring like a rising tide.

None present had come expecting defeat.

"Excellent!"

"Then let it be decided through contest. Who shall step forward to claim the first wisp of spiritual essence?"

With a sweep of his sleeve, Elder Huo released a golden strand of spiritual energy. It swirled in the air like mist or cloud, glowing like a radiant sunset—a prize beyond compare.
