# Chapter 66: Water Jade Yin Body  

When a person is free and unrestrained, their body and mind relaxed, they often enjoy galloping freely across fertile fields, indulging in passion without reservation.  

Wang Chan was no exception—he even stood up to ride harder.  

Two hours later...  

Ripples danced across the water at the edge of the river cave, swaying the aquatic plants as a school of golden carp swam in.  

Wang Chan, now fully dressed, withdrew his divine sense from his storage pouch and sealed it with a **[Thunder Seal Curse]**, a faint trace of satisfaction in his expression.  

The items in his storage pouch were valuable—even disregarding the rest, the mid-grade heavy artifact **[Small Flat Mountain Seal]** and the mid-grade blood armor alone were worth a fortune. Additionally, there were two low-grade artifacts.  

Though he had suffered significant losses in successive battles, these items could somewhat compensate for them.  

Remembering that he still had a few bottles of spirit wine that greatly replenished primal yang energy, Wang Chan quickly took one out and gulped it down.  

With such nourishment, he no longer had to worry about prolonged exertion leading to exhaustion.  

He poured the last sip of the spirit wine into the water, thinking that sharing joy was better than enjoying it alone. The golden carp thrashed and fought over it, and soon, the drunken school swam away.  

By now, the earthen prison talisman's barrier in the cave had dissipated, leaving behind a mix of lingering blood and the thick scent of indulgence—an unpleasant combination.  

Wang Chan casually activated a low-grade purification talisman, summoning an intangible wind that cleansed the area. Only then did he take a deep breath.  

His gaze swept over the scene. Fellow Daoist Su, lost in pleasure, lay limp on the jade bed like a puddle of mud. Perhaps drunk, she occasionally twitched. Concerned that she might have overexerted herself, Wang Chan took out silver needles, intending to give her a few pricks.  

But suddenly, the silver needles turned black. The tenderness on Wang Chan’s face instantly vanished, replaced by icy indifference.  

Originally, he had thought of enjoying a fleeting encounter with this woman. If he could extract information about He Changkong, great. If not, they could part amicably.  

Unexpectedly, He Changkong had pursued him with sinister methods.  

Thus, during Wang Chan’s battle with He Changkong, Su Jue had witnessed his techniques—both the white and black needles.  

Under normal circumstances, given their brief affair, Wang Chan might have spared her for old times’ sake.  

After all, Qu Lian and Ning Jingming also knew about these two techniques.  

Moreover, as time passed, these methods could no longer be considered true trump cards.  

There was no need to be excessively ruthless.  

However, Su Jue had seen him kill He Changkong—one of the thirty-six leaders of the Black Eagle Gang.  

Furthermore, she had overheard things she shouldn’t have, such as the name Bai Shaofeng.  

As the saying goes, the human heart is hidden behind layers of flesh—Wang Chan could not trust her.  

Even if she now adored him and considered his interests in everything, circumstances changed, and so did people’s hearts.  

His foundation was still weak, and any unnecessary risks had to be eliminated.  

Unfortunately, he had no blood contracts on hand, nor did he know any spells or divine abilities to place restrictions within another’s body. Otherwise, there might have been room for negotiation.  

As for oaths sworn upon the Dao heart...  

Wang Chan hadn’t understood them well before.  

But after reading many jade books and ancient texts over the past few months, he had gained some insight.  

The most basic requirement for such an oath was that it had to be voluntary and sincere.  

If forced, even if the person reluctantly swore, the oath would be invalid. Moreover, the oath only formed a vague connection with the one who swore it—outsiders had no way to verify it.  

Thus, such oaths were best made jointly by two or more parties.  

Once sworn, each could sense whether the other’s oath had taken effect. But if even one party was insincere or unwilling, the joint oath would fail.  

Most importantly, the world was unpredictable, and the path of cultivation was fraught with variables. If one carelessly swore a Dao heart oath and later failed to uphold it, regret would come too late.  

Therefore, unless absolutely necessary, no one would willingly bind themselves with such oaths.  

Especially high-level cultivators, who avoided them like the plague, fearing they might hinder their Dao paths.  

Above all, for many Qi Refining cultivators who saw no hope of reaching Foundation Establishment, Dao heart oaths were meaningless.  

Now, he had no choice but to be ruthless.  

Just then, the unconscious Su Jue let out a soft moan. Her watery, dazed eyes slowly opened. Seeing Wang Chan standing nearby, tall and indifferent, she trembled and pleaded pitifully:  

"Fellow Daoist Wang, please spare me in consideration of how I served you wholeheartedly."  

With that, she quickly sat up in a seductive pose, accentuating her alluring figure, and patted her storage pouch. She retrieved a golden scroll and slowly unrolled it before Wang Chan.  

"This is a second-grade **Golden Arrow Curse Contract**. I am willing to follow Fellow Daoist Wang’s commands and sign it."  

Wang Chan scanned it with his divine sense—it was indeed a second-grade contract.  

Once Su Jue signed, violating his orders would result in golden arrows piercing her heart, killing her.  

Moreover, a second-grade contract was unbreakable, even by Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

As for Nascent Soul cultivators... well, Wang Chan wasn’t that important.  

After a long silence, Wang Chan inspected the Golden Arrow Curse Contract thoroughly before glancing at Su Jue and saying nothing more.  

This woman had likely been awake for some time, waiting to gauge his reaction.  

Perhaps her earlier enthusiasm had been a prelude to this moment.  

Seeing Wang Chan’s silence and the slight softening of his icy expression, Su Jue understood that his silence was tacit approval. She immediately signed the contract, verified it for Wang Chan, and sealed it with her essence blood and divine sense imprint.  

Soon, a thick golden arrow illusion sank into her body and vanished.  

Wang Chan then stored the contract in his storage pouch and smiled warmly. "Fellow Daoist Su, you’ve worked hard."  

Seeing how Wang Chan had been murderous one moment and affectionate the next, Su Jue inwardly remarked on his two-faced nature—kind in appearance, ruthless at heart.  

But then she thought, if not for this very ruthlessness, how could the man who had conquered her have defeated He Changkong, the nightmare of her past?  

Only the strong could defeat the strong.  

"Fellow Daoist Wang flatters me. Thanks to you, I’ve come to understand the joys of womanhood and escaped my tormentor, gaining freedom at last."  

Su Jue responded gently before peeling off her second torn apricot-yellow robe. She summoned a wave of water to cleanse herself, then dressed in a fresh robe and began grooming herself.  

Wang Chan’s eyes lit up at her skillful water-attribute low-grade spell.  

No wonder Fellow Daoist Su had been so effortlessly smooth—her mastery of water-attribute techniques was exceptional.  

Soon, Su Jue transformed from a wanton seductress into a poised and elegant woman. Though she wore no makeup, the glow from Wang Chan’s attentions left her complexion radiant.  

Seeing Wang Chan lost in thought but showing no lingering attachment, she sighed inwardly and stepped forward to bow.  

"I will take the airship to White Mountain City at the hour of the Monkey. Though we part now, our paths may cross again. Farewell, Fellow Daoist Wang."  

With that, she took out a low-grade water-traveling talisman, ready to leave.  

"Wait, Fellow Daoist Su." Wang Chan patted his storage pouch and retrieved five mid-grade talismans—two earthen prison talismans, one golden armor talisman, and two earth-traveling talismans—handing them to her.  

"I have little else to offer, but these five mid-grade talismans may aid you."  

Though their combined value rivaled that of a decent low-grade artifact, and their relationship had been transactional,  

First, he had taken her virginity, and the pure Yin essence had helped him cultivate several strands of spiritual power—equivalent to far more than a low-grade artifact in pill value.  

Second, she had been tactful and skillful, making their interactions pleasant.  

Third, fleeting as their affair had been, it was still a bond. A parting gift might sow goodwill for future encounters.  

Su Jue stared blankly at the five mid-grade talismans before tears suddenly welled up and fell.  

She had thought herself fortunate just to leave unharmed, never expecting gifts—let alone such generous ones.  

The earthen prison talismans alone were formidable, as she had witnessed earlier.  

And the golden armor talisman was something even spirit coins couldn’t buy.  

It seemed this man, though ruthless, had a human side when his interests weren’t threatened.  

After all, He Changkong was dead, and she was of no further use to him.  

As for her body—while passable—with his strength, a single mid-grade talisman and a beckoning finger would summon similar women without hesitation.  

Having followed He Changkong for years, she had seen the fickleness of human nature.  

Useless things were lucky not to be kicked aside, let alone cared for.  

Most importantly, her journey to White Mountain City was uncertain, and this man was as fierce and powerful as a savage beast.  

As a weak woman, only by attaching herself to a strong man could she hope to advance further on the Dao path.  

Resolved, Su Jue bit her red lips and spoke softly, tears in her eyes:  

"I possess the **Water Jade Yin Body**, which will fully awaken in about ten years. I will remain chaste in White Mountain City. If Fellow Daoist Wang ever visits and does not disdain my humble self, I would gladly serve as your concubine..."  

With that, she activated a spell, as if lifting a seal. A refreshing, watery spiritual energy emanated from her body.  

At the same time, she gazed at Wang Chan with hopeful eyes.
