# Chapter 16: The Crazy Bubble

With Zhao Xuhe's guarantee, Lu Yang successfully borrowed 2,000 contribution points from his backing organization, the "Three Rivers Association," and immediately invested all of it into Substitute Death Puppets.

Meanwhile, in his own cave dwelling, Zhao Xuhe paced excitedly.

"The news is actually true!"

Upon receiving the message from his master, he was instantly thrilled. "The Sect's 'Mass Grave of Ten Thousand' in Jiangnan was indeed captured by the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion."

"The one who took action was the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion's Third Elder, the peerless sword cultivator known as 'True Lord Demon Slayer'."

"It's impossible to reclaim it in such a short time."

"With the fall of the Mass Grave, a short-term price increase for Substitute Death Puppets is inevitable. This is a golden opportunity for us to speculate and hoard!"

"I'm going to get rich!"

As a steward disciple of the Merit Hall in the Prime Saint Sect, Zhao Xuhe naturally didn't lack connections or background. Nor did he lack foresight or greed. Therefore, as soon as he confirmed Lu Yang's information was true, he immediately started gathering funds, then poured all his cash into heavily buying Substitute Death Puppets.

And events unfolded exactly as he had predicted.

As the news of the Jiangnan Mass Grave incident spread, more and more people who "noticed the business opportunity" began to sweep the market, buying Substitute Death Puppets at high prices.

Like all speculative bubbles, those who entered first made a significant amount of money.

However, as the event progressed, people discovered that the price of Substitute Death Puppets showed no signs of decreasing; they bought high, and sold even higher.

Making money suddenly became easy.

Simply buying and selling could effortlessly earn contribution points that previously required completing several, or even dozens, of sect missions.

Consequently, more people succumbed to the madness.

An increasing number of individuals began to pour their life savings into the market, hoping to profit. And indeed, they did, further stimulating the market.

Even cautious individuals, upon realizing that their usually disdained fellow disciples were merely buying items, waiting a few days, and then selling them for more money than they themselves earned, naturally felt unbalanced. So, they too, quite justifiably, joined the frenzy.

In this wave, the price of Substitute Death Puppets soared relentlessly.

From an initial 200 contribution points, it climbed all the way to 300 contribution points. A fifty percent increase drove countless speculators even crazier.

After all, its price hadn't stopped; it was still rising.

If it rose today, it would surely rise tomorrow. If it rose tomorrow, what reason would it have not to continue rising the day after? Not buying now was a loss!

Thus, more and more people joined the rush.

300, 400, 500... Finally, when the price surged to 500 contribution points, people's rationality somewhat returned, feeling it was probably enough.

"Time to sell!"

Zhao Xuhe was the first to grasp this subtle turning point, secretly beginning to unload his previously hoarded Substitute Death Puppets in batches, preparing to cash out and exit the market.

At the same time, the price of the entire Substitute Death Puppet market began to fall.

After all, Zhao Xuhe wasn't the only intelligent person in the world; others also keenly perceived the downward trend and began gradually selling off their goods.

If things had continued this way, the price would have completely plummeted in a few days and returned to normal.

However, just as this wave was about to subside, a piece of news suddenly spread overnight throughout the entire Prime Saint Sect from its high echelons.

"The Sect is preparing to counterattack!"

"The fall of the Jiangnan Mass Grave has angered a True Lord within the sect, who has decided to personally intervene, mobilizing disciples from the sect for a counter-offensive, to clash with the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion!"

"A great war is imminent!"

During wartime, all materials beneficial to the war effort increase in price.

And how important would Substitute Death Puppets, a life-saving item in critical moments, be in the bloody and brutal upcoming battle between righteous and demonic forces?

It was no different from a second life!

Without a doubt, on the very night this news spread, the price of Substitute Death Puppets, which had already begun to fall, experienced a second surge!

Not only did it instantly return to its peak of 500 contribution points, but it continued to climb!

By the next morning, 500 contribution points had become 1,000 contribution points, an astonishing five-fold increase compared to the original price of 200 contribution points!

"Hahahahaha!"

In the Scripture Pavilion, Wang Bairong stood on his precious rocking chair, excitedly gesticulating, his old face flushed with excited blood and fervor.

"Rise! Keep rising!"

"No, I need to buy more. Selling so little now won't earn much. I need to hoard more... then I'll have enough contribution points for a cave dwelling!"

At this moment, the entire Prime Saint Sect witnessed a carnival for its ordinary disciples.

These ordinary disciples lacked foresight, connections, and information channels, so when others were secretly selling, they were still buying.

And now, they had struck it rich.

Countless ordinary disciples saw their net worth double overnight, earning even more money than the total assets of some senior disciples with backgrounds and backing.

For a time, countless fantastical stories spread throughout the Prime Saint Sect.

For example, a destitute young man, publicly jilted by his fiancée, angrily broke off the engagement after his net worth doubled, leaving behind the phrase, "Never look down on a young man in his poverty."

Or, a young girl, forced to live under others' roofs after her father's death and mother's remarriage, who previously endured daily beatings from her stepfather and couldn't even keep her father's inheritance, now saw her net worth double, immediately buying a high-grade cave dwelling in full.

Do you have a dream? Do you want to realize your dream?

Come buy Substitute Death Puppets!

This all-encompassing madness reached its peak on a certain day when a disciple at the perfection of Qi Condensation suddenly broke through, successfully establishing their Foundation.

Because that disciple, who successfully established their Foundation, publicly admitted that the reason for their breakthrough was entirely due to earning enough contribution points by trading Substitute Death Puppets, which then allowed them to fully purchase a Foundation Establishment Pill. Thus, they wanted to thank the Substitute Death Puppets, claiming that without them, they could not have defied fate.

It was absolute pandemonium.

1,000, 2,000, 3,000... The price of Substitute Death Puppets surged forward, leaving all others behind. And as the prices soared, some rejoiced, while others grieved.

Those who rejoiced included Lu Yang.

He was not greedy and decisively chose to sell when the price soared to 2,000.

After all, buying 10 at the original price of 200 contribution points and selling them at 2,000 meant a tenfold profit, bringing in 20,000 contribution points!

Those who grieved included Zhao Xuhe.

When he saw the price rebound, he was so regretful his guts turned green, especially after seeing Wang Bairong, whom he used to look down upon and even intended to swindle.

As far as he knew, Wang Bairong, this mediocre fellow who had been muddling along for decades, with one foot almost in the grave, had hoarded more than 20 Substitute Death Puppets, all bought at high prices during this period. When he was secretly selling earlier, he had privately mocked Wang Bairong as a "leek" waiting to be harvested.

But now, that guy was about to earn 100,000 contribution points!

If it were just that he himself hadn't earned, then it would be fine.

But when Zhao Xuhe saw Wang Bairong earning so many contribution points, grinning from ear to ear every day, that feeling was even more unbearable than his own losses!

And after seeing the price of Substitute Death Puppets continue to rise relentlessly, Zhao Xuhe deliberated for an entire night.

Finally, he re-entered the market.

The contribution points he had earned from his previous exit were now thrown back into the Substitute Death Puppet market.

Initially, he remained cautious, not investing all his contribution points, but seeing the price continuously rise, he felt he was losing a little with every increase.

"Opportunity knocks but once; I already missed it once, how can I miss it a second time?"

"It will still rise. Buying now is better than buying later..."

Many shared Zhao Xuhe's thoughts.

And when this batch of early cash-outs re-entered the market, it further stimulated the rise of Substitute Death Puppets and strengthened people's confidence.
