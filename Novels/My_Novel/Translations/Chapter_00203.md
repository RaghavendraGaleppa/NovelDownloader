Chapter 203: The Divine Catcher Seeks an Audience, a Great Trend is About to Rise

Inside the courtyard, in the side residence.

The water flowed, warm and soothing to the body. Li Xian lay floating in the water, eyes closed in sensation.

Over six hundred strands of Heaven and Earth Essence remained within him, condensed and undispersed, circulating continuously. Li Xian practiced martial arts to accelerate its digestion. Martial artists compared their bodies to the universe to endure in this world. The Heaven and Earth Essence was the foundation for shaping this universe.

His spine was like a divine mountain, standing tall between heaven and earth.

However, Li Xian’s realm was still low. The universe within his body was chaotic and vague, with a long road ahead. The Food Essence realm strived for transformation from the mundane. The concept of "Body as the Universe" was too distant and illusory. To be practical, a Food Essence martial artist drank the essence of heaven and earth to strengthen and transform their roots, thereby increasing their lifespan.

"If I were lazy and lax, I might not be able to digest these six hundred strands in a year. If I practice diligently, refine my martial path, and seek strong opponents to spar with, consuming two or three strands a day, it would still take half a year."

"If I want to go faster, I heard from Madam that I need to experience life-and-death peril. Only by stimulating my potential between life and death can my digestion speed increase significantly."

Li Xian touched the 'Life Hair' at the back of his head; it was growing longer, and his lifespan was increasing. Madam had told him that his Life Hair was already two inches long, giving him a lifespan of over one hundred and fifty years.

"Ordinary mortals have a lifespan of one hundred years. Food Essence martial artists live to one hundred and fifty. If I continue to consume essence treasures, digest the essence in my body, and nourish myself until my whole body is like the universe, my lifespan can extend even further."

Li Xian closed his eyes, savoring the technique intent of the Golden Scale Art.

Anyone who consumes the 'Human Yellow' essence treasure is considered to have "started the谱 (record)." After that, they can compile a food record, eating and cultivating a unique treasure technique.

He sensed the golden fish swimming and frolicking, its whole body shimmering with golden light.

The technique intent contained in a single scale or half a tail is limited. But after being strengthened by consumption, there is quite a bit. Then, touching upon the [Savor] trait, he slowly savored the charm within, imitating the outline of the technique path, and weaving the food record list.

"The Human Yellow essence treasure has a singular technique intent. Even if I swallow the Golden Scale alone, it is difficult to form a technique. It requires the blending of several Human Yellow essence treasures' technique intents to naturally form a technique."

"The [Golden Light Soup] Madam mentioned requires Golden Scale, Yellow Nine Ginseng, Morning Yellow Dew... I will note down this food record. If there is a chance in the future, I might really be able to touch upon it."

The red mole between his eyebrows flashed.

[Food Essence]
[Proficiency: 68/100]
[You digested Human Yellow · Golden Scale, Food Essence realm proficiency +1]
[You savored the technique intent, Food Essence realm proficiency +1]
[Proficiency: 70/100]

Rivers merging into the sea, a hundred days on a pole, yet another step forward. Li Xian’s flesh emitted a multicolored haze; with every transformation, there is manifestation; with every transformation, there is progress.

The Double Pupils were revealed, deep and mysterious.

The many wonders of the Reborn Phase became even more concentrated.

Li Xian thought to himself: "Some powerful martial arts can only show their clues by martial artists who have undergone rebirth. It seems... because only the body of a Food Essence martial artist can contain so many wonders. Unfortunately, I cannot access such martial arts for the time being."

Time flew to mid-December.

[Technique: Silkworm Cloak]
[Proficiency: 31/3000 (Great Completion)]

Madam was diligent in her seclusion, and Li Xian was always summoned. The method of wrapping the Silkworm Cloak improved day by day, and unknowingly, it had actually reached Great Completion.

A few hours before every seclusion, the two would play around for a bit. Madam would feign resistance but actually enjoy it.

The Silkworm Cloak Jade Shattering Art finally broke through, and Madam’s strength took a big step forward, becoming even more formidable. Her appearance was flawless and even more captivating.

On the day of the breakthrough, Madam was extremely delighted. The guards, servants, and maids in the manor all received rewards. Li Xian was rewarded with several hundred taels, and the two famous restaurants in Qingning County and Huangyu County were given to Li Xian to manage.

Madam Wen thought: "The Silkworm Cloak Jade Shattering Art has already broken through.只需再稳固一二, I can head to the Southern Frontier to seek the One-Heart Gu. I haven't taught him profound martial arts yet precisely because I am waiting for this treasure to be obtained. My sect's martial arts cannot be leaked. Even Xiang Shu, who is loyal to the bone, can barely glimpse a fraction. He must enter my sect, becoming one with me, before I am willing to teach him. And he is so young; waiting a few more years to accumulate a bit is by no means a bad thing."

She secretly planned the trip to the Southern Frontier. She ordered Uncle Xiang to prepare the necessary items, arrange the itinerary, and smooth over relations. Uncle Xiang hesitated to speak, thinking silently: "Madam is indeed impatient. The One-Heart Gu is not cheap. It seems that boy is truly the young master chosen by Madam."

He became even more respectful towards Li Xian.

Li Xian sensed it slightly, but how could he know of the undercurrents surging? Thus, he calmed his mind and practiced martial arts diligently.

"Madam’s strange art has advanced a step further, her strength is greater. I should strive to catch up even more. Although I do not have profound strange arts, I can practice the martial arts I have learned to the extreme!"

[Boundless Leg] stepped into Great Completion. Although his strength increased not as much as Madam's, he didn't need to bind himself in a cocoon, and what he gained was more solid.

On this day.

Madam Wen stabilized the Silkworm Cloak Jade Shattering Art and went into seclusion again.

Because the strange art broke through, the method of wrapping the Silkworm Cloak had many differences, becoming more严密 (strict/tight). The silkworm ropes weaving around were complicated and complex, not inferior to a set of martial arts. She couldn't help but feel deeply resentful:

"This strange art is powerful, yes, but it really troubles me too much. The deeper you cultivate, the more you cocoon yourself. At the previous layer, my hands and feet were difficult to move, but my Qi circulation was unimpeded. This layer... according to this Silkworm Cloak method, it strengthens the blockage at my Spirit Platform, Xuanji, and Shenque acupoints. These are several crucial acupoints when I circulate my internal Qi."

"According to this method, with the Silkworm Cloak on my body, my Qi circulation is difficult and sluggish. If a strong opponent attacks, I will definitely react too late. If I advance another layer, wouldn't I truly be as helpless as a bound chicken? Truly at the mercy of others. By then, wouldn't Li Xian..."

Thinking of a certain point, her expression turned abnormal.

Li Xian didn't know the key points, only feeling that the Silkworm Cloak was complex and tedious, taking a lot of time. Wrapped on his body, his hands, feet, wrists, and acupoints all over his body were restricted; it must be very uncomfortable.

Li Xian asked: "Madam, shall we start?" Madam Wen said calmly: "Naturally." She was naturally suspicious and would never reveal a word of the weakness of her technique. Even if Li Xian were to be implanted with the One-Heart Gu in the future, it would be difficult for him to know this secret.

It was her nature, unrelated to love.

The Silkworm Cloak was complex, and it was already night by the time it was wrapped. Madam needed to stabilize her strange art and could not afford to play around at all. So, as soon as it was done, she drove Li Xian away. She ordered him to come back in three days to help her release the bindings.

The starlight was bright tonight.

The moon, however, was waning.

Li Xian savored the technique intent and digested the essence in his body. The night passed slowly. The next day, before dawn, Ding Hu came over and said: "Master Li, someone is looking for Madam outside."

Li Xian asked: "Who is it?"

"The visitor claims to be Madam's friend and is waiting outside the manor. Should we see them or not? Please inform Madam and let her decide." Ding Hu said respectfully.

Li Xian thought that Madam couldn't move, how could she meet anyone? But a guest waiting outside, whether they have good intentions or bad, is unknown. He needed to check personally.

He walked to the outside of the manor and saw the visitor wearing cloth clothes, looking travel-worn. His temples were fluttering, and he was middle-aged but very handsome.

Li Xian thought: "Madam has many enemies. For someone to come looking now, whether friend or foe, it is difficult to judge." He asked: "Senior, what business do you have with Madam?"

The middle-aged man raised his eyes and swept his gaze over, his目光 sharp. He said: "Are you the Evil Lieutenant Li Xian?"

"You know me, Senior?" Li Xian answered calmly.

The middle-aged man said: "I suppose I do. I heard a thing or two about you on the way here. It seems the rumors are not false. You and Wen Caishang are indeed close."

Li Xian asked: "Oh?"

The middle-aged man said: "Although your clothes are simple, your temperament is not ordinary. A red mole between your eyebrows, a face with unusual features, and a handsome appearance. This is easy to recognize. When I came to Qiong Tian Mansion, I passed through the Prefecture City. I heard a thing or two about you. The families in the Prefecture City intended to cover up certain deeds."

"I originally had no relation to you, so why would I inquire about your deeds? But I have a癖好 (hobby): the more others try to cover up, the more I want to find out clearly."

"Besides, the surnamed families in the Prefecture City have dirty hands. It was very easy to investigate. Upon investigation, it became crystal clear. After all, at the Tower of Talents Banquet, there were many onlookers. No matter how much the Prefecture City families intended to cover up, what could they do?"

"The rumors say you and your Madam are close. I didn't believe it at first, but seeing you now, you have 'Xu Ran Xiang' lingering on you. This scent comes from your Madam. It is strongest on your chest and abdomen, showing that you and your Madam have been hugging and holding each other, very intimate."

The middle-aged man挑眉 (raised his eyebrows) and smiled, his expression teasing.

Li Xian was open and aboveboard. He cupped his hands and said: "Senior Li Bohou, truly worthy of being the Divine Catcher. Impressive, I admire you."

"Oh?" The middle-aged man said: "You say I am Li Bohou? How did you deduce that?"

"Aiya, Father, what deduction can he make? He naturally heard your great name long ago and has seen your portrait," a woman on horseback said as she rode up, charming and moving, fresh and lively. This woman had met Li Xian once before; she was "Li Haitang."

Li Bohou said: "Not necessarily. Young brother, explain it in detail."

Li Xian said: "Senior is famous, truly如雷贯耳 (thunderous reputation). As for how I knew your identity, it is actually extremely simple. I once had a meeting with your daughter and knew she was your daughter."

"Seeing that you and your daughter resemble each other in the eyes and brows. Just now, your speech was逻辑 (logical) clear and your thinking meticulous. It matches the传闻 (rumor) of the Divine Detective very well, so I boldly guessed."

"Now seeing your daughter appear, it confirms it even more. Since you are both friends of Madam, it is freezing cold outside, please come in and sit quickly."

Li Bohou laughed in surprise: "You are quite impressive. Haitang, get off your horse. How is it proper to look down from high up?"

Li Haitang leaped down from her horse. Her gaze was suspicious as she looked Li Xian up and down.

As they entered the gate.

Li Haitang couldn't help but ask: "Hey, when did I meet you before?"

Li Bohou scolded: "Haitang! Don't be rude!" Then he smiled and said: "Young brother, my daughter is spoiled by me. Please don't mind."

Li Xian thought to himself: "I saw that long ago." He said: "Miss Haitang might not remember me. At this time last year, you came to the manor once to capture the evil person Tan Zhong Xian. I was among the guards at the time."

"Ah?" Li Haitang had long since thrown this matter to the back of her mind. Recalling it carefully, she suddenly said: "Ah! You were that guard?"

Some faint impressions gradually overlapped.

Li Xian said: "It seems Miss Haitang still remembers me. I am truly honored."

"This... it's only been a year, how have you changed so much?" Li Haitang asked in surprise. Her beautiful eyes looked him up and down, full of curiosity.

Li Xian brushed it off casually. Li Bohou observed keenly, seeing that Li Xian had no affection for his daughter, but his daughter was very curious about him.

Li Xian led the way in front. Turning a corner in the corridor, he guided them into the guest hall. He boiled tea and served it to them one by one.

Li Haitang took a small sip, her eyes flashing as she said: "Hey, tell me about your experiences this year?"

Li Xian said: "By the way, Miss Haitang, was that Tan Zhong Xian captured?"

Li Haitang said irritably: "That thief doesn't know where he ran off to." Then she asked curiously: "Let's talk about you instead. Have you entered the Food Essence realm? What manifestation did you reveal?"

"Ahem, Haitang, don't be rude!" Li Bohou interrupted. He cupped his hands and said: "Young brother Li, please introduce us to your Madam. Just say it concerns the Dragon Appreciation Banquet, and it is closely related to Madam herself."
