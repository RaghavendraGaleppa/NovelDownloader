# Chapter 2: Killing the Master

‘You have gained some insight into mining, and your mining proficiency has increased.’

“You had a flash of inspiration, slightly adjusted your swing angle, and immediately felt the pickaxe become more comfortable to wield. Your mining proficiency has increased.”

“……”

As he continued to mine, proficiency level-up notifications popped up in his vision, keeping him motivated.

After reaching the入门 (entry-level) stage in mining, proficiency needed to reach five hundred to level up again. At this rate, he could achieve minor success in just ten days to half a month.

Half an hour later, after gathering the required amount of ore, Xu Yunfan began slowly transporting the ore from this mine tunnel to the main tunnel. This labor had left him completely exhausted.

He then submitted the ore to the supervisor located below the main tunnel.

The extremely burly supervisor held a wine cup in his hand and glanced indifferently at the ore Xu Yunfan had brought over.

“Too many impurities,” the supervisor said lazily. He casually grabbed two flatbreads from the table and threw them onto the ground.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained unchanged. He glanced at the supervisor’s indifferent face, picked up the hard-as-stone flatbreads, and silently refilled his water bag.

Just yesterday, someone had complained about the supervisor casually throwing food and was whipped. That night, he died from severe injuries.

After obtaining the flatbreads and water, Xu Yunfan let out a sigh of relief. He lowered his head to avoid eye contact and quickly left.

If he continued to starve, he wouldn’t even have the strength to swing his pickaxe, and would only wait for death.

In the mines, one could choose to be lazy, but then there would be no food, and one would starve to death.

While eating, Xu Yunfan scanned the entire main tunnel. The ore here was scattered and sparse. Along the main tunnel, there were branch tunnels extending in all directions, up, down, left, and right.

It was hard to believe this was actually an ore mining site.

After breathing in the fresh air flowing down from the upper ventilation shafts in the main tunnel for a while, just as he was about to leave, a figure stood before him.

“Do you know who I am?” a man’s voice rang out.

Xu Yunfan looked up. The face before him was covered in black mine dust, but under the torchlight, two eyeballs were barely visible.

“Who are you?”

The man was taken aback, then reached up to wipe his face, revealing a face full of ferocious features. He looked at Xu Yunfan with unfriendly eyes.

Jiang Yu, a descendant of a criminal family and also the original body’s master—the *former* master.

Seeing Jiang Yu, some memories involuntarily surfaced from the depths of Xu Yunfan’s mind.

Jiang Yu used to beat, scold, and humiliate the original body at will, even going so far as to mock and insult the original body’s deceased parents.

Influenced by the original body’s memories, Xu Yunfan felt a surge of anger rise within him for no reason.

Xu Yunfan took a light breath and glanced back at the supervisor’s room not far away, from which the sounds of drinking and shouting could still be heard.

“I didn’t eat enough.”

“You can continue mining to exchange for food and water…”

“What nonsense are you talking about!”

Jiang Yu snorted and shoved Xu Yunfan, who was caught off guard, to the ground. He snatched the food from Xu Yunfan’s hand and looked at him coldly.

“All of this, give it to me. You are just a servant. You must remember, it was my Jiang family who bought you in. Even here, you were born my servant, and you shall die working to fetch food for me.”

He leaned forward slightly, looking at Xu Yunfan, who remained silent.

“Tomorrow, you must get me at least one portion of food and water.”

Jiang Yu straightened up and looked at the pickaxe hanging at Xu Yunfan’s waist. “If it weren’t for the Mine Supervisor’s office distributing the labor, I would have had you mining for me long ago. Why would it be like this?”

He looked up at Xu Yunfan and said coldly, “Did you hear me?”

Xu Yunfan remained silent for a moment, then nodded slightly.

“I understand.”

Hearing Xu Yunfan’s words, Jiang Yu showed a hint of satisfaction on his face and nodded slightly. “If Zhang Li had been like you, I wouldn’t have beaten him to death.”

Zhang Li was beaten to death by this bastard!

Xu Yunfan’s heart tightened, and the determination he had secretly made became even stronger.

He watched as Jiang Yu quickly disappeared into a branch tunnel, vanishing in an instant.

Xu Yunfan, who had scrambled up unsteadily, stared fixedly at Jiang Yu’s back as he disappeared into the darkness.

Without the flatbreads and water he had exchanged for, he wouldn’t last a month; he would likely pass out from hunger tonight.

Yet, even after falling to such a state, people still stepped on others to survive.

After a moment of silence, he glanced back at the supervisor’s room guarding the mine exit. The faint aroma of braised meat and wine coming from inside made his stomach rumble loudly.

Xu Yunfan pressed his lips tightly together. He couldn’t attract the supervisor’s attention.

He tightened his grip on the pickaxe in his hand and followed Jiang Yu into the mine.

Jiang Yu and several others were standing or sitting around, looking at Xu Yunfan standing at the entrance of the tunnel.

“Oh, isn’t this Brother Jiang’s servant? I remember when Brother Jiang was educating his servant, it left a deep impression on me,” the speaker turned to look at Jiang Yu, a teasing look on his face.

“What’s this, feeling nostalgic today? You’re skipping a meal just to bring him here? Looking at your soft skin, Brother Jiang, you aren’t... indiscriminate, are you? Why don’t you bend over and give it a try? I heard from Huo Ziren that playing with that pretty little pageboy was quite enjoyable.”

A burst of laughter erupted from the five men. In this foul-smelling, sunless mine, it was a rare source of amusement.

The speaker was Cui Ye. Xu Yunfan remembered that back in Yujing, this man was especially cruel to his servants, particularly good-looking maids. If he took a liking to one, she would be carried out of his room as a corpse covered in wounds within three days.

Inside the tunnel, only a single torch插在 the wall, casting a faint light that seemed as if it could be swallowed by the darkness at any moment.

Xu Yunfan stood quietly by the side of the tunnel. Under the flickering torchlight, his face appeared indistinct, the shadows on his cheeks looking like a phantom.

He pressed his lips tightly, frowned, and ignored the others’ words. With his eyes slightly lowered, he stood before Jiang Yu.

“Give me back the food.”

Jiang Yu raised his eyebrows. Being spoken to so rudely by his former servant made him furious.

He leaned forward slightly, a smile on his face but his eyes icy cold.

“The food? There is none. If you want it...”

He pointed to a corner.

“There are our excrements over there. You...”

Before he could finish his sentence, Jiang Yu’s eyes widened in shock. He saw the man who had been looking down raise his eyes and stare fixedly at him.

Immediately after, he saw Xu Yunfan’s body undulate like a wave. The pickaxe in his hand rose and fell with incredible speed, and the sharp point plunged into Jiang Yu’s neck. It was a force that shouldn't have been possible for this frail-looking body.

Just like mining, the entire movement was fluid and continuous, without the slightest pause—a dig, a pull, and a sweep!

A large chunk of flesh and blood was gouged from Jiang Yu’s neck by Xu Yunfan’s pickaxe. Scalding blood sprayed out instantly.

Jiang Yu covered his neck, which was gushing blood nonstop, and looked at Xu Yunfan without blinking. With a hint of confusion, he collapsed heavily to the ground, lifeless.
