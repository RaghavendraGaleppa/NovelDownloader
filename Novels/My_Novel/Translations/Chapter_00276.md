Chapter 276: Dao Xuan Jade Maiden

Bian Qiaoqiao jumped into the lake to escape. The moment she hit the water, countless lake fish swarmed to bite her. She cried out in despair, "My life is over!" Bound by vines, her limbs were immobilized. Surrounded by the school of fish, she had no means to resist.

In the chaos, she suddenly felt the vines loosen slightly. The vines were woven from the roots and stems of flowers. The Red Fish inhabiting the Dongran Lake had a miscellaneous diet, eating plants, insects, and even rotting meat. Gnawing on the flower vines was simply part of their nature.

She rubbed her wrists, channeling her Internal Qi to shake them loose, and the flower vines gradually fell apart.

Secretly, she practiced the Dao Xuan Mountain's "Nine Heavens Walking Cloud Art." Her toes touched the water, allowing her to swim swiftly through the water. The Red Fish chased and bit, but they didn't hurt her skin; they only bit the vines entangling her.

She didn't know the reason behind this.

Her hands gradually broke free, and her shoulders and elbows moved freely again. She rotated her shoulders, overjoyed. Having been bound for months, regaining freedom and breaking the shackles made her arms feel stiff.

"These flower thieves bound me for months, making me gradually get used to it. Now that my hands are free, I feel quite unaccustomed."

She moved her qi and blood, circulating them through her arms until they returned to normal without obstruction. This was an action even an infant could do, yet it was once a dream she longed for. She immediately swayed left and right, exercising her limbs to the fullest.

During her time in the ship's prison, her hands were bound, leaving her helpless against back itches, forehead sweat, or drooling. Now, splashing water and playing with fish, she felt relaxed and at ease, a sense of smoothness filling her heart, making her spirit clear and refreshed.

Because she had drunk the "Three Realms Blood Soup," the condition of "clear rising and turbid sinking" was slightly alleviated. However, her fear of water remained, and she would slowly sink while submerged. The Dongran Lake was vast, like a sea or an abyss. If she fell to the bottom, even if she could breathe underwater, she would be trapped forever in the endless darkness. She would eventually go mad from stupidity or die of hunger and confinement... or be devoured by the secrets at the bottom of the lake.

After swimming for several miles, the Red Fish attacks were quite troublesome. She lightly patted her chest, secretly playing the "Sound of All Things," which was a score from Dao Xuan Mountain.

The Sect Master of Dao Xuan Mountain once listened to the sounds of all things and composed this immortal melody. After decades of improvement, it was now complete.

For those in the second realm of martial arts, it is inevitable to have a restless heart. Playing the immortal melody allows one to comprehend the heavens and earth, gain insight into nature, and blend with all things in the world. It even has the profound effect of blending emotions into the scene and blending one's body into all things.

Its wonders are infinite.

She felt as if she had merged into the heavens and earth, like a fish, like lake water, like aquatic plants. The Red Fish searched for their prey in confusion.

Taking this opportunity, she swung her arms with all her might, swimming several miles without being swallowed by the fish school. After escaping the pursuit of the fish school, Bian Qiaoqiao encountered another problem: although the Three Realms Blood Soup could alleviate the weakness of "clear rising and turbid sinking," a second-realm martial artist would still gradually sink when trapped in water. After untying the ropes, escaping, and swimming several miles, her body was gradually sinking.

At this moment, she was about three meters below the surface. She used her "swimming technique" and martial arts skills, but she continued to sink.

Just when she was at a loss, she suddenly saw a fishing boat drifting overhead. She was ecstatic. Seeing the fishing boat casting a net to catch fish, she swam over and grabbed the net.

The fisherman in the boat felt the net sink, guessing they had caught a big one, and hurriedly pulled it in. Amidst the splashing water, they caught a beauty instead.

Bian Qiaoqiao grabbed the edge of the boat and climbed aboard. She felt her whole body relax. Lying in the fishing boat, she looked up at the bright moon, feeling extremely joyful.

The fisherman was bewildered. Bian Qiaoqiao smiled sweetly, cupped her hands in thanks, and explained the truth. After hearing this, the fisherman cursed the flower thieves for their shamelessness and advised her to hide and escape quickly.

The fishing boat needed space to store the catch, so it wasn't cramped. Bian Qiaoqiao hid in the cabin. Her hands were covered with marks from the ropes, crisscrossing. Her legs were still bound, with flower vines entangling her knees, ankles, and many other vital points.

She felt for the knots and began to untie them. The binding technique of the Flower Cage Gate was extremely intricate. It took her several hours to finally free her feet.

Bian Qiaoqiao massaged her legs to relax her muscles. Supporting herself against the cabin wall, she slowly stood up. Her feet were extremely numb. She stumbled a few steps before gradually feeling some relief.

The fishing boat drifted slowly, and the lake waves were calm. Regaining her freedom, the vast scenery was infinitely beautiful.

Bian Qiaoqiao rotated her ankles and lightly hopped. Recalling the tragic situation in the ship's prison, her desperate escape from death, and the sudden turn of fortune, she couldn't help but feel extremely happy.

"I thought my life would be bleak and hopeless, bullied by others, reduced to that... I didn't expect I could still... Ah! Although I've escaped, Sister Liu Li is..."

Bian Qiaoqiao's eyes reddened, and her joy dissipated. It wasn't hard to predict Nan Gong Liu Li's fate. The two sisters were captured together. One escaped to the sky, while the other was trapped in the mire.

Such a difference in fate.

Bian Qiaoqiao looked at the vast lake area, the clear waves stretching far and wide. She wanted to grab the oars and dive back into the flower boat to try and rescue her. The fisherman hurriedly said, "Martial Lady, oh! You can't wander around Dongran Lake!"

Bian Qiaoqiao asked, "Why not?"

The fisherman said, "The Dongran Lake is vast. If you go deep into the lake, you'll get confused about directions. Won't you get lost? And there are countless water bandits hidden inside. If you wander around recklessly, even immortals couldn't save you."

"If you insist on going, please get off the boat. I can't help you with this."

Although Bian Qiaoqiao was from a famous sect, she was new to the Jianghu. Having been captured and suffered, she was already traumatized. Although she wanted to rescue Nan Gong Liu Li, she had just escaped from a desperate situation. The thought of being trapped again was truly terrifying.

She calmed down and said softly, "I'll remember this place. I'll go back and ask Sister Zhao for help, then rescue Sister Liu Li. My mighty Dao Xuan Mountain, how could we fail to wipe out this small water sect?"

"If I insist on going back now and get captured again, then... then we would both have no hope!"

Suppressing her agitation, she helped row the oars, striving to get out of the lake as quickly as possible. The fishing boat passed through a dense patch of reeds and aquatic plants, and the shore gradually came into view.

Bian Qiaoqiao's face showed a smile, her joy hard to hide. She leaped up, her body light and graceful. Even though she was nearly thirty meters away, she landed on the shore first. The warm sunlight shone on her, making her whole body warm, completely different from the darkness of the prison cell.

Her feet touched solid ground. She suddenly felt dizzy and swayed to one side. It turned out that after being suspended for nearly a month, she had gradually adapted to the swaying in the water. Now that her feet were on solid ground, stable in all directions, it felt strange.

It was now morning.

She walked several miles away from the lake and found a secluded spot to light a bonfire. Fearing that passersby might see her, she moved some weeds to block the view. She took off her wet clothes and dried them by the fire. She took off her shoes and boots, pouring out the lake water and sweat.

She felt her feet instantly refreshed. The prison cell had been extremely hot and stuffy. She had long wanted to take off her boots and rest. Finally, her wish was fulfilled. Her mood was buoyant, and her fair toes wiggled. Once her clothes were completely dry, she put them back on.

When she was first captured, her "Soft Wind Sword" was taken away, and she had no weapons. Bian Qiaoqiao frowned and pondered. Having learned of the dangers of the Jianghu, she decided to travel light and cover her tracks. She would head straight for Dao Xuan Mountain.

Bian Qiaoqiao looked at the Dongran Lake area and said firmly, "Once I get Sister Zhao, humph! I'll kill all you thieves!"

"And that Hua Wu Cuo, he was the most enthusiastic in chasing me back then. He saw my pathetic state, that vile scoundrel, he deserves to die, die, die!"

She brought her fingers together, forming a sword finger, and pointed several times into the empty air. Invisible Internal Qi shot out fiercely, piercing several fallen leaves.

She used her lightness technique and quickly moved away.

She couldn't help but think for a moment: "I wonder how Sister Liu Li is doing now." Imagining Nan Gong Liu Li suspended in mid-air, her dress disheveled, her hairpins askew, one of her embroidered shoes lost, in utter embarrassment, her pretty face couldn't help but flush slightly.

"I will definitely save you from this sea of suffering."

The ship swayed, and Nan Gong Liu Li let out two angry grunts. Her nose itched, and she sneezed. Dizzily, she thought: "Could it be that Sister Bian has escaped and is thinking of me?"

She lowered her eyes to look at her immobilized body and said with a bitter smile, "Your Sister Liu Li has been captured, my hands and feet are tied, I'm so pathetic. Don't you laugh at me when you think of me like this."

Seeing the darkness, she felt extremely lonely.

On the deck of the flower boat, Li Xian gazed at the lake surface. The aquatic plants were several meters high, as if they had entered an ancient, secret land.

Li Xian diligently practiced the "Flying Snake Hand." Heaven rewards the diligent, and with his good comprehension, his proficiency was accumulating day by day, gradually approaching perfection.

[Proficiency +2]
[Proficiency +2]

Li Xian, for the time being, had no access to profound martial arts, so he diligently accumulated basic martial arts. His moves returned to simplicity, possessing a natural and innate quality.

He reviewed his martial arts path and formulated his own school of martial arts. The Iron Copper Body, the Guarding Body Sound, the Gang Thunder Finger, the Playing Sun Immortal Sound... using them in conjunction could enhance martial arts effects, forming a school of its own.

The Vomiting Blood Canon and the Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword resonated with each other, allowing him to spit blood fire and vomit blood cocoons.

The Five Organs Avoiding Turbidities and Meeting Yang Meridian, although it had little killing power, was the foundation of the Vomiting Blood Canon and the Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword. It nurtured the five organs, nourished blood and strengthened qi, and was an essential skill for building a strong physique.

He thought to himself: "If I were to acquire more martial arts, how should I choose and build my own school?"

The Breeze Leg and the Vast Leg... could be superimposed, making the body as light as mist. Combined with the "Seven Star Step," it became even more ethereal and hard to trace. It was also a good combination of martial arts.

Li Xian guarded the prison cell and talked with Nan Gong Liu Li every day. He often asked about the cultivation of the子弟 of the family. Nan Gong Liu Li, to relieve her boredom, would usually talk about it.

From this... Li Xian learned that the noble families, various branches, and talented sons and daughters attached great importance to the selection of martial arts.

Because practicing martial arts required time, energy, and financial resources. The family branches were complex, and there were many descendants of the same generation. They competed fiercely with each other. For young members to stand out, time and resources were especially precious.

If their talent was similar, it depended on the understanding and combination of martial arts. If the combination of martial arts was excellent, they could achieve twice the result with half the effort, which was truly powerful.

Li Xian was erudite and eager to learn, and he never refused any martial arts. But he couldn't help but wonder: if he had the chance to choose martial arts, which ones should he choose first to most effectively enhance his strength?

At noon.

The flower boat sailed out of the misty area, and the scenery suddenly changed completely. Vigorous ancient trees broke through the water surface and shot straight into the sky.

There were giant trees hundreds of feet high and wide, supporting the water surface and forming a waterfall spectacle. This was the "Tree Waterfall," a magnificent and strange sight, difficult to explain by common sense.

The scorching sun hung high, and a rainbow appeared.

Ye Cheng shouted loudly. The Flower Cage Gate disciples picked fruits from the tree trunks along the way. There were green, red, blue, and green ones... with wonderful colors and tastes.

Cooking fish soup, the taste was extremely delicious. The scenery here was beautiful, and the resources were abundant, like a fairyland, with no worries. Everyone set up tables on the deck and ate there.

Li Xian had always been free and easy. Having come to this place, he no longer worried about how to escape. Since he was here, he would be at ease. Holding a bowl of delicious fish soup, he jumped onto the sail and looked into the distance, savoring the delicious soup.

[You consumed the Five Fruit Fish Soup, your Consumption skill proficiency +2]
[Skill: Consumption]
[Proficiency: 2/10000 Perfect]
[Description: You consume myriad things, tasting bitterness and spiciness. Beneficial effects are increased by 80%. Harmful effects are reduced by 50%. You have comprehended the "Scent Seeking" trait and the "Appreciation" trait.]

Consumption is simple and easy, yet its use is vast and strange. The "Scent Seeking" trait can find "fragrant treasures" in the world. Anything that enters the mouth can be remembered, and you can subconsciously seek it out. The "Appreciation" trait allows you to smell the essence of all things, thus appreciating the meaning they contain.

The "Appreciation" trait does not require consumption. But it requires a rich foundation of knowledge to appreciate its essence and be able to explain it eloquently.

The skill "Consumption," from simplicity to complexity, from shallow to profound. As the saying goes, "Beauty is a feast for the eyes." The infinite beauty of all things in the world... are they not all rare delicacies?

Li Xian appreciated the fish soup. All kinds of deliciousness bloomed on his tongue. What he tasted and appreciated was even more delicate: the heat, the ingredients, the quality of the fish... he sensed it subconsciously. It was incredibly rich.

The "Appreciation" trait seems useless. But it is extremely conducive to accumulating knowledge and enriching experience. The later it gets, the more important it becomes.

His belly was warm and his strength increased. Li Xian ate and drank his fill, feeling extremely happy. He moved his internal filth and trained his body internally. Suddenly, he thought of Nan Gong Liu Li, who was still waiting to be fed.

He took the soup box and went back to the lower level. Nan Gong Liu Li looked over at the sound, sighed softly, and opened her mouth to eat the fish. Li Xian talked about the lake scenery and chatted about miscellaneous matters.

After everything was done, he lay on the coarse mat and rested. Life on the boat was really nothing more to say.

For the next few days, it was the same. Seeing that she was suffering from being suspended, Li Xian would inform Elder Ye Cheng to loosen her suspension slightly.

Nan Gong Liu Li was very grateful. She opened her mouth to speak, wanting to ask Li Xian to massage her muscles and bones, but she couldn't bring herself to say it.

Gradually, it was late summer.

The climate was hot and dry. Nan Gong Liu Li was sweating profusely from the heat, unable to wash, her whole body sticky. Her face was flushed with shame. Even a celestial maiden would have fallen to the mortal world after suffering such an ordeal. Her delicate fragrance mixed with the smell of sweat. Every time Li Xian fed her, she was so embarrassed she couldn't speak, feeling uncomfortable all over. Fortunately, she was as beautiful as a delicate flower, only adding a touch of charm, making her even more enchanting.

On this day, the sky was as clear as washed. An island appeared in view. The Flower Cage Gate disciples were extremely excited, waving and shouting, expressing their joy.

Li Xian looked far into the distance and saw a dock set up on the island. The flower boat was heading towards the dock, and the outline of the island gradually became clear, covering a large area.

Since the flower boat entered the Dongran Lake, it had been sailing for more than ten days, always going around in circles. The waters outside the water sect for dozens of miles involved terrain, feng shui, and layout... involving many miscellaneous arts of strange formations.

The Ferry Messenger was proficient in this art. Therefore, only under his steering could they enter the water sect.

The flower boat docked, and the anchor sank to the bottom. The shore was planted with strange and bright flowers. A ship's ladder was lowered from the deck.

Ye Cheng went ashore, and several Flower Cage Gate elders gathered around. They talked happily and laughed heartily.

Li Xian returned to the lower level, feeling the ship shake, knowing it had docked. Nan Gong Liu Li looked at Li Xian with terror in her eyes, seeking help. Her fate had irreversibly arrived here.

Li Xian shrugged. In such a situation, he could only go with the flow. He waited for a moment, hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs.

Four black-clad women appeared and walked straight towards them. The four women were tall and quite beautiful. They glanced at Li Xian, then carefully examined Nan Gong Liu Li.

Their eyes were scrutinizing.

One woman said, "Unlock the lock."

Nan Gong Liu Li was full of terror, her whole body tense. When the cell door was unlocked, the four women entered the cell and surrounded Nan Gong Liu Li.

Nan Gong Liu Li had her mouth blocked by a "hemp walnut," so she could only whimper in alarm. Tears welled up in her eyes.

The four women gently stroked with their hands. The suspended rope immediately loosened. Nan Gong Liu Li cried out in alarm and fell straight down. The four women reached out together, grabbing her shoulders, knees... the four corners of her body.

The leading woman smiled and said, "Good girl, you've suffered, it must have been very difficult."

The four women exerted force, tossing Nan Gong Liu Li high into the air. Nan Gong Liu Li cried out in alarm, flying a meter high. She twisted her body in the air but could do nothing.

When she fell straight down, she was caught by the four women again. They did this several times in a row, and Nan Gong Liu Li was dizzy and disoriented, too overwhelmed to resist.

The four women chatted, "I heard this girl comes from a big family, is proficient in zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting, and her martial arts cultivation is quite strong." "Alright, what's the use of talking about the past? Won't she need it in the future?" "That's right, from now on, all that has nothing to do with her." "She's lucky, I wonder which genius she'll be attached to." "I think that Ding Ze Lin is quite handsome."

"This girl is very beautiful. If she pleases a handsome hero, she'll have good days ahead."

"Yes, I hope she'll settle down and behave herself."

Nan Gong Liu Li's knees were bent, and her hands and feet were connected. Unable to move and being manipulated, she was already frustrated. Hearing the four women's conversation, although there was no intention of insulting or humiliating her, she felt even more humiliated.

The four women tossed her several times. Nan Gong Liu Li felt hopeless and slightly adapted. Suddenly, the four women's movements changed. They lifted her up and spun her quickly. Their steps were synchronized and fast, one became two, two became three...

They turned into countless afterimages.

Li Xian was secretly surprised: "These four women are very powerful, their footwork is light and agile, their martial arts attainments are not shallow! I must observe carefully."

He watched silently. After the four women turned several circles, Nan Gong Liu Li was already dazed, unable to distinguish east from west.

The four women suddenly extended their hands together. Their fingers were nimble. Every time they struck, they targeted acupoints. They continued to chat: "This girl looks dignified and gentle, hehe, but actually she's very flirtatious." "Yes, after being suspended for so many days, how can she still look like she's enjoying it? I wonder what she dreamed about yesterday." "I said why she's so spirited, it turns out she likes this."

Nan Gong Liu Li was furious upon hearing this. She clenched her silver teeth, and her Internal Qi rebounded. The four women laughed sweetly, "This girl has been found out, and she's embarrassed." "Hehe, we four sisters have seen countless girls. Whether you like it or hate it, can't we tell?"

Nan Gong Liu Li's Internal Qi was actually dissipated by the four women one by one. Resistance was useless. These four women were also women, and they knew exactly what Nan Gong Liu Li feared. Their fingers tapped several times, making Nan Gong Liu Li both painful and numb.

She was too ashamed to cry out in pain.

She said dejectedly, "Falling into the hands of these people, I... I really have no hope."

The four women added, "You little slut, you're still enjoying it." Nan Gong Liu Li was extremely ashamed and angry, and powerless to argue.

The four women acupointed Nan Gong Liu Li completely. They helped her circulate her qi and blood, which was actually beneficial. The four women exchanged glances, their techniques suddenly changed, and they began to untie the ropes.

Nan Gong Liu Li rejoiced, "Good opportunity!" The moment the ropes were completely untied, she immediately raised her palm to strike one of the women's faces.

The four women moved swiftly and struck simultaneously. They dissolved her move, and in an instant, they subdued Nan Gong Liu Li again. Nan Gong Liu Li struggled with all her might, but in this situation, she was truly unable to put up a fight.

One woman said, "Take her away, treat her well. Teach her the rules. Don't worry, you're a big prize, no man has touched you during this time."

"But... I'm afraid you'll be the one begging for a man to touch you."

Nan Gong Liu Li said coldly, "You're wallowing in degradation,呸! How could I, Nan Gong Liu Li, be spoken of by you like that."

The four women giggled and said, "You just hold on. Let's see how long you can pretend. Girls like you, we've seen plenty."

"Before, no matter how noble your birth or how good your cultivation, once you're here, we don't care about that."

Nan Gong Liu Li clenched her silver teeth and turned her gaze away. She caught Li Xian watching the whole time and glared at him fiercely, thinking: "You little flower thief, we've been through hardship together. They... they said such things about me, and you didn't say a word for me. They have four mouths, I only have one, of course I'm at a disadvantage."

She was so angry her face turned red. Then she thought: "They... they are too much, how could they say such things about me! Saying I'm enjoying it."

But she could no longer resist and was taken away by the four women. From a dark secret passage, they went straight into a building.

Li Xian frowned, watching Nan Gong Liu Li go far away. He thought: "Although Nan Gong Liu Li has been taken away, her life is safe, and she won't be humiliated. Since we've arrived at the water sect, it's time to see this secret place."

He walked to the deck and saw many disciples waiting there. The ship's ladder was narrow, only allowing two people to pass at a time. Those who were impatient jumped from the deck into the lake and swam to the shore.

Qiao Sanyan said, "Brother Wu Cuo, we've arrived at the water sect." Li Xian asked, "Brother Qiao, have you been here before?"

Qiao Sanyan said, "Hehe... I came once before."

On the shore. Li Xian's feet touched solid ground. After twists and turns, he had arrived at this place. Qiao Sanyan said, "Brother Hua, you performed well all the way on the ship. Elder Ye praised you quite a bit and specifically instructed me to show you around."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Then I thank Brother Qiao."

Qiao Sanyan said, "It's a small matter. Besides, I haven't been back for a long time, and I want to wander around myself."

Leaving the dock, they walked a few miles along a small path. Flowers flanked the path on both sides, very娇艳. Peach trees were planted in rows.

This was a chaotic flower maze. It could trap people in the chaotic flower thicket, especially effective on women. There were people to meet them in the maze. After passing through the maze, they saw a small town.

Li Xian was surprised: "Are there so many Flower Cage Gate disciples that they can form a town?"

Qiao Sanyan laughed and said, "Brother Hua, your thoughts are similar to mine. When I first came to this town, I was also very surprised."

"Actually, the residents of this small town are not our Flower Cage Gate members."

Li Xian was very surprised. If they weren't members, how could they live long-term in the sect's important place? Qiao Sanyan said, "Our Flower Cage Gate disciples travel all over, far and wide. Sometimes the island is empty. This island is very large. If it were left empty, wouldn't it be a pity?"

"Besides, the Dongran Lake is vast. Occasionally, fishermen or tourists... happen to drift nearby. Gradually, a small town evolved, maintaining the island's operations and making the island vibrant."

Li Xian said solemnly, "Won't this leak the location of the secret place?"

Qiao Sanyan said, "Even if they go out, they will have a hard time finding this place again. And once they set foot on the island, they will never be able to leave again in their lifetime."

As they talked, they had already entered the small town. It was densely populated and very lively. The small town brewed wine from flowers and collected honey from bees, creating a unique kind of peace and tranquility.

Li Xian suddenly felt: "Who would think that the notorious Flower Cage Gate's water sect is actually a paradise like this. The people here don't care about the world and live and work in peace. They are quite happy."

Qiao Sanyan said, "After generations of evolution, there are seven such small towns. Actually... these small town residents have deep interests with the Flower Cage Gate."

"Look over there."

In the distant mountains, a bronze tripod stood tall.

Qiao Sanyan said, "To cook refined food, a large amount of water is needed. These small town residents do not need to pay silver taxes. But they need to pay a [Dew Tax]."

Li Xian asked curiously, "Dew Tax?"

Qiao Sanyan said, "We use 'Flower and Grass Crystal Dew' to cook refined food. This kind of water is excellent and耐煮耐煮 (耐煮耐煮 means耐煮耐煮,耐煮耐煮 means耐煮耐煮,耐煮耐煮 means耐煮耐煮,耐煮耐煮 means耐煮耐煮,耐煮耐煮 means耐煮耐煮,耐煮耐煮 means耐煮耐煮,耐煮耐煮 means耐煮耐煮,耐煮耐煮 means耐煮耐煮,耐煮耐煮 means耐煮耐煮,耐煮耐煮 means耐煮耐煮,耐煮耐煮
