Chapter 721: Patience is Plentiful When Doing Evil

Fear, numbness, resignation, and a deep-seated unwillingness.

Xu Yunfan was indifferent to it all.

Han Shi was a born traitor. Given the slightest opportunity, he would absolutely strike.

Most of Xu Yunfan's mind was immersed in the deduction of the final activation scheme for the two great arrays, their interlocking and connection.

Deep within the Samsara Sea of Bitterness, above the massive blood wave vortex eight hundred miles outside the Bone Island perimeter.

Xu Yunfan's consciousness, through the strong control link of the Attribute Panel, quietly watched the area perfectly covered by the Yinming Cloud Qi.

Han Shi's figure lurked within, his aura completely blending with the eternal gray and decaying clouds above the Netherworld, becoming one.

Just moments ago, through Han Shi's hands, the two killing arrays—which had cost Xu Yunfan a great deal of effort to deduce, refine, and ultimately complete the nesting—were finally connected.

The composite array, the Nine Nether Mystic Evil Slaying Immortal Thunder Array, which was commanded by the total outline of the Divine Skies Purple Mansion Destruction Heavenly Gang True Thunder Method and integrated the Earthly Evil Abyss Yin Thunder, Nine Nether Mystic Yin Evil Thunder, and Yellow Spring Soul-Calling Thunder, as well as the inner layer, the Myriad Calamities Yin Evil Extermination Sword Array, which specialized in containing the endless turbid evil dead energy and killing karma of the Sea of Bitterness as its source, had finally completed the final connection and deduction.

At this moment, the scene in the center of Bone Island was clearly reflected in Xu Yunfan's divine sense.

That thousand-zhang skeletal dragon, once the overlord of the Sea of Bitterness with a ferocious aura that shook the heavens, was now coiled under that gnarled strange tree after a fierce battle with the White-Haired True Lord, its state pitiful to the extreme.

Huge tearing wounds covered its massive skeletal body, with many places exposing stark white bone stubs that flickered with a dim and ominous light.

The aura it emitted was weak and listless, far from the imposing and fierce might of a Golden Core level creature. Even the instinct to maintain its own existence seemed to be teetering on the verge of collapse, giving a strong feeling of being burned out and at the end of its rope.

This scene was too abnormal.

A Golden Core level Sea of Bitterness overlord born with a Dao Fruit, how could it be so severely injured in such a short time and not recover for so long?

This was most likely using the grievously injured dragon and the Dao Fruit right beside it as a fatal bait to lure those who coveted it.

"Hmph,想 to lure a snake out of its hole?"

Xu Yunfan sneered in his heart, but his divine sense became even more focused.

Although he had already laid down a double killing array, he would not easily step into the core area.

The center of a trap is often the most dangerous place.

After confirming through Han Shi's investigation that there were no obvious ambushes or the figure of the White-Haired True Lord around the dragon, at least for now, Xu Yunfan was certain the other party would not be in the vicinity.

Xu Yunfan's mind moved slightly, giving an order to Han Shi.

"Operate the Nine Nether Mystic Evil Slaying Immortal Thunder Array, lock the target on the dragon, open the Mystic Yin Absorption Evil, and slowly extract the Yin evil dead energy within a hundred miles of its surroundings. Do not cause any other changes.

Control the intensity, only absorb, do not attack."

Han Shi naturally dared not refuse, and followed the hand seals transmitted by Xu Yunfan, executing the command step by step.

Han Shi, lurking within the Yinming Cloud Qi, silently changed his finger techniques, stirring the array flag hubs already arranged at specific nodes on the perimeter of Bone Island.

Hum...

An extremely obscure fluctuation, almost impossible to perceive, spread from the core array disc of the Nine Nether Mystic Evil Slaying Immortal Thunder Array.

Like invisible tentacles, it quietly probed into the space of Bone Island and its surrounding hundred miles.

The array flags and array discs arranged in the crevices of the blood sea reefs, within the huge skeletons, and deep in the decaying clouds began to operate silently.

The first to be stirred were the Earthly Evil Abyss Thunder array flags connected to the Yin evil turbid energy accumulated for billions of years in the depths of the Sea of Bitterness. They were like roots growing in filth, frantically and secretly absorbing the purest Yin evil origin.

Then, the array disc hub carved with Nine Nether Ghost Face talismans lit up slightly, and an invisible force pulled the ubiquitous Nine Nether Mystic Yin energy of the Sea of Bitterness, forming a thin but continuously expanding vacuum zone around the dragon.

Those pale as bone, able to stir the resentment of the lost souls, Yellow Spring Soul-Calling Yin Thunder array flags, then extracted the pure dead energy and the faint energy dissipated by the lost souls lingering in the air, strand by strand.

The entire operation process, under the precise command of the Divine Skies Purple Mansion Destruction Heavenly Gang True Thunder Method, was done without a sound, without stirring the slightest energy ripple, without causing any spatial fluctuation, and without touching any possible warning restrictions.

All the Yin evil, dead energy, and resentment energy were quietly devoured, transformed, and stored by the nested thunder array core, without leaving even a trace of stray spiritual energy.

This area, originally cold and dead due to the Netherworld environment, became even more desolate under the deliberate extraction of the array.

It was as if the air had been pumped into a vacuum. The rich, unresolvable, Sea of Bitterness特有的 cold and dead feeling visibly thinned out around the dragon.

Although this change was extremely subtle, and would be almost unnoticeable unless carefully investigated by a Golden Core True Lord's divine sense, it was indeed happening.

Xu Yunfan's divine sense, through the feedback from the Attribute Panel, naturally could sense that the energy density in this area was slowly and continuously decreasing.

He understood in his heart that this dragon was not a true Golden Core True Lord, but merely a companion beast evolved from the Great Yin Dragon Dao Fruit. Its foundation and the maintenance of its existence largely depended on the nourishment of the endless Yin evil dead energy in the Sea of Bitterness environment.

Now, Xu Yunfan's action was like cutting off the firewood from under the pot, quietly severing the most important source for it to heal its injuries and replenish its power.

Xu Yunfan handled the degree of this extraction with extreme precision.

The outer layer of the confusing array connected to karma, forming a certain level of epistemic barrier, making this dragon unable to react, like a frog in slowly heated water.

It would not immediately cause a strong backlash from the dragon or expose itself, yet it could effectively slow down its recovery speed, keeping it in a weak state that would not immediately collapse.

After all, a dying dragon was far less valuable than a living bait that could be consumed continuously.

"The recovery of its injuries has been delayed..."

Xu Yunfan's divine sense captured the fact that the tiny energy light at the edges of those huge wounds on the dragon's body, which were originally moving slowly, seemed to have become even more stagnant and dim.

In its blood flame dim eye sockets, there seemed to be a flash of imperceptible fatigue and...

Its massive skeletal body moved slightly, as if instinctively sensing the discomfort in the environment, yet unable to find the specific source.

"Very well, the karma secret technique has been successfully牵动."

Xu Yunfan breathed a sigh of relief in his heart. The Dongming Erosion Heaven Talisman was truly useful. The effect it displayed at the Perfection level could make even a Golden Core cultivator fall for it if they were not careful.

Xu Yunfan naturally would not activate the killing array to capture this dragon at this moment.

The Dao Fruit was right before his eyes, within easy reach, but the greatest threat was not this severely injured beast.

That White-Haired True Lord, who was proficient in the art of life and death samsara, about whom even the Universal Salvation True Lord spoke vaguely, and who was suspected to be a traitor of the Primordial Origin Sect, was the real hidden danger.

Who knows if the other party is lurking in a spatial rift nearby, or hiding in the depths of the blood sea or within the bones using some secret art to reverse life and death, or even possibly clinging to the dragon's body.
