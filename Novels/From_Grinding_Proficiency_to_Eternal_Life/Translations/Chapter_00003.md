# Chapter 3: Power Through Both Arms

The few former playboys beside him had never witnessed such a bloody scene. They immediately recoiled in panic. Just as one of them was about to scream, Xu Yunfan raised his iron pick. Under the dim torchlight, the blood splattered on his face made him look like a ferocious ghost.

"Scream again, and I'll kill you too!"

Cui Ye hurriedly covered his mouth, looking at Xu Yunfan in terror. The remaining three or four people quickly fled the mine shaft as if escaping.

Smelling the foul stench in the air, Xu Yunfan frowned, suppressed the discomfort in his heart, and quickly bent down to take the food and two bags of clean water from Jiang Yu's body.

He had to find a place to bury this guy. The overseers patrolled irregularly. If it were discovered that Jiang Yu was murdered, they would naturally question him. If Cui Ye then reported him, he would be in a very passive position.

As for whether Cui Ye and the others would actively report to the overseers.

Xu Yunfan wasn't worried at all. If these descendants of criminals wanted to report to the overseers, they had to be prepared to die.

Descendants of criminals, exiled here, death was inevitable, just a matter of time.

The mine shaft had its own set of rules. The overseers could question you, but you couldn't actively question the overseers.

Those who came down here were basically the most heinous criminals. How could they be allowed to speak? The Mine Supervision Bureau had its own operating mechanism.

Most of those who could enter the shaft were high-ranking officials. If they made a few promises to those overseers, it would naturally stir things up.

How could the Mine Supervision Bureau allow that?

He licked his lips, took a large gulp from his waterskin, and quickly calmed his mind. He dragged Jiang Yu and walked towards the adjacent mine shafts.

It was a good while before the few who had fled in a panic, not knowing how far, came to their senses. One of them was panting heavily, his eyes bloodshot and full of gloom.

"That guy, what gives him the right? With that scrawny body of his, we could take him!"

The remaining few also gradually came back to their senses, feeling both ashamed and angry.

Xu Yunfan's body looked even frailer than theirs, yet they were momentarily intimidated by the ruthlessness of his pickaxe strike and didn't dare to step forward.

"I'm going to f*cking kill him."

Cui Ye cursed angrily and immediately raised his iron pick to go again, but was pulled back by the person next to him.

"Wait, we need to plan this carefully. If he fights back desperately and we get injured, we won't live long."

The living environment in the mine shaft was extremely harsh. Once you had a wound, it was almost impossible to heal; it would just keep festering.

Hoping for those overseers to save you? They might just whip you to death on the spot.

"Why don't we go tell the overseer? That slave overstepped his bounds and killed his own master. It's utterly lawless, a great calamity!"

Someone said resentfully.

One of them sneered and sat down on the ground with a thud.

"We are descendants of criminals. You want to go tell the overseer?"

Hearing this, the person could only give up resentfully.

Cui Ye's gaze was cold, his fingers gripping the iron pick tightly.

"There are four of us. Can we really not beat one?"

He turned his head to look at the others.

"I'll take the lead. Are you still afraid?"

Publicly humiliated by Xu Yunfan like this, he was unwilling to let it go. Just thinking of Xu Yunfan's appearance, besides the fear that welled up, there was also immense resentment.

"Let's go, let's go. I won't be satisfied until I drink his blood and eat his flesh!"

Hearing this, the others no longer hesitated. They all gripped their iron picks tightly and headed back the way they came.

Dragging Jiang Yu's body into the deepest part of the deserted mine shaft, Xu Yunfan took a breath. He ate half a piece of饼 (bǐng, flatbread) with some water, restoring some of his strength.

He picked up the iron pick again and, without any hesitation, began to swing it. With one strike, a huge gap was chiseled into the ore on the ground. At the same time, the force of the collision rebounded, sending the pickaxe flying high. His waist and abdomen tightened slightly, his shoulders and arms trembled imperceptibly.

The iron pick划出 (huà chū,划出) an arc in the air and landed heavily on the iron ore beneath his feet.

Using the momentum allowed him to achieve maximum efficiency with minimal physical effort.

In less than the time it took to boil a cup of tea, he had dug a small pit.

Xu Yunfan stopped, feeling a bit pleasantly surprised. Every time he swung the pickaxe,借助 (jiè zhù, relying on) the recoil, he could借力 (jiè lì, borrow force) quite a bit, even feeling a bit relaxed.

Just the入门 (rù mén, entry-level) of mining was this powerful. He wondered what level he could reach if he continued to advance with 500 proficiency.

After burying Jiang Yu's body so that no trace remained, Xu Yunfan was about to leave when his steps suddenly halted. He turned his head to look at the side, where a pair of eyes was watching him from the darkness.

These eyes...

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred, and he walked closer.

When he saw the sharply defined face clearly in the dim light, Xu Yunfan's expression changed slightly.

"Prince Yan?!"

The Great Zhou royal family, Prince Yan, Li Haomiao.

The original owner's memory held memories of this Prince Yan, Li Haomiao. The last time he saw him was at the Jiang residence, attending a banquet hosted by Jiang Yu's father, Grand Councilor Jiang, Prime Minister Jiang.

The number one martial arts genius of the Great Zhou royal family, a true disciple of the Dao Sect, a talent for governing the country, erudite and knowledgeable, benevolent and charitable...

At the time, he was a collection of various titles. He was tall and straight, like a towering pine tree. His sword-like brows and star-like eyes exuded an innate heroic spirit. Every gesture and movement radiated a charm that was impossible to ignore. He was handsome to perfection.

Especially his eyes, which were extremely clear, making them unforgettable at a glance.

Now, this Prince Yan had lost three of his limbs, leaving only his left arm intact, but a scar ran from his wrist to his elbow, as if his tendons had been severed.

His face was also disfigured by three terrifying scars carved by a small knife.

If not for those eyes, Xu Yunfan wouldn't have recognized him.

He sighed, "I didn't expect Prince Yan to be in this mine shaft too. The Empress Dowager is truly ruthless."

Although he didn't know exactly what happened in the Imperial Capital back then, for this Prince Yan to fall to this state, it was undoubtedly the work of the Empress Dowager. Otherwise, how could a royal relative be almost turned into a human stick and thrown into the mine shaft to fend for himself?

However, Xu Yunfan guessed that since the Great Zhou Empress Dowager ascended the throne, she naturally had to clean up the court and support her own factions. Otherwise, how could she, as a woman, secure the throne?

As a legitimate descendant of the Li family, Li Haomiao was naturally within the scope of the cleanup. He heard the charge was colluding with the neighboring Great Qian Dynasty, intending to treason, and his legs and one arm were amputated.

"That wicked woman..."

Li Haomiao's eyes moved slightly. Leaning against the wall, he glanced at the spot where Jiang Yu was buried, then shifted his gaze to Xu Yunfan.

"Power through both arms, waist and horse like waves. Every strike of the pick is accurate, fast, and powerful. Your foundation is good."

With that, Li Haomiao raised his chin slightly, his cracked lips moving.

"Son of the Minister of the Left, Jiang Ming. What happened to him?"

"Oh, he was too tired from mining just now and wanted to find a place to rest. Unexpectedly, he slipped and his neck hit a sharp piece of ore. He's dead. I'm here to collect his body."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's unchanged expression, the corner of Li Haomiao's mouth twitched. He then looked at the half-exposed饼 in Xu Yunfan's arms.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan silently pushed the饼 deeper into his chest, hiding it.

"..."

The mine shaft fell silent for a moment. Xu Yunfan had a slightly embarrassed smile on his face.

"Prince Yan, if there's nothing else, I'll be going first."
