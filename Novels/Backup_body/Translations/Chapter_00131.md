# Chapter 131: The Trail of Bai Xiao the Venerable! The Truly Kind and Righteous Gang!

The carriage came to a halt by the roadside.

Li Zhengjing lifted the curtain and stepped inside.

The young man who had just woken up looked around in confusion.

The cramped carriage was packed with bizarre creatures.

There was a strange tree that could speak, currently shouting loudly. 

A small insect perched on the tree, its eyes dazed, antennae twitching slightly as it chirped, "Flip! Flip!"

Hanging from the tree was a broken jade fragment, from which an old man's voice emerged: "Woke up just in time."

Nearby sat an old man clutching half a length of intestines. When he turned his head, his golden eyes, fanged mouth, and clawed left hand came into view. 

Upon closer inspection, his legs were actually eagle talons!

In another corner, a seemingly normal little girl was fast asleep, her belly swollen, with a pair of dragon horns on her head!

A peculiar bird with golden feathers and green crest approached, its back lined with bony spikes, and spoke: "Don't make me resort to torture—spill the truth!"

The tiny carriage was packed with such extraordinary beings.

Only the young man who had just entered seemed ordinary in comparison.

Upon waking to this sight, the youth felt his mouth go dry, his eyes filled with fear.

Then the strange bird tilted its head and said, "Master, this kid's stubborn—he won't talk."

The tree waved its roots. "Since he won’t cooperate, let’s start with the torture!"

The young man shivered. "Torture? But you haven’t even asked me anything yet!"

The wall-perching bird paused, looking around. "Did I not ask earlier?"

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its roots. "You did! You said if he didn’t talk, we’d torture him. But he’s still refusing—let’s bring out the heavy tools!"

"What... what do you want to know?" the young man stammered, his face pale. "I’ll tell you what I can..."

Li Zhengjing smiled, taking out the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron and handing it over. "Do you recognize this?"

The youth nodded quickly. "I do."

Li Zhengjing pointed at the inscriptions inside. "Then do you understand these words?"

The young man shook his head. "No."

The wall-perching bird immediately squawked, "See! He’s being stubborn—won’t confess! Tree, bring out the torture tools I prepared earlier."

The Five Elements Creation Tree hesitated. "All of them?"

"All of them!" the bird declared.

The tree replied, "The carriage is too small. Your tools are huge—we’d need at least five carriages to fit them all."

The bird puffed up proudly, turning to Li Zhengjing. "Master, you see? My reputation for learning isn’t for nothing!"

Li Zhengjing studied the youth. "You really don’t know?"

Instead of answering, the young man reached for the cauldron, shouting, "That’s mine!"

Li Zhengjing pulled it back. "Torture it is, then."

The youth froze, realizing he had fallen into a den of monsters.

"Kid, if we hadn’t saved you, grass would already be growing on your grave," the bird sneered.

"Bad luck! If he’d stayed in the sea, fish would’ve eaten him—no grave to speak of," the tree retorted.

"We saved your life—now even your life is ours," Yuan Zhengfeng chimed in. "And you’re worried about a little cauldron?"

"Actually, my master says we should never exploit kindness for gain," the bird said, pulling out a long needle.

"But not demanding repayment is our virtue," the tree added. "If you don’t repay, that’s your fault."

"Just tell us what these words mean, and we’ll let you go—consider your life a free gift," Yuan Zhengfeng sighed. "Think about it—if we weren’t kind, you’d be dead, and the cauldron would already be ours..."

The youth trembled under their combined pressure, nearly in tears.

The bird shook its head admiringly. "What a tough guy—even now, he won’t talk..."

"Wait..." 

Ghost Valley Lingguan put away the half-length of intestines and leaned in. "This kid doesn’t seem right..."

The youth shrank back in terror at the grotesque face looming over him.

"Don’t be scared. We’re decent folk, not bandits," Ghost Valley Lingguan said, adjusting an eye that had nearly fallen out. "We’re famously kind-hearted in Zhongzhou—why else would we have saved you?"

"But... none of you look human?" the youth blurted out, then realized his mistake.

He had meant to say they didn’t look like good people—but it came out as "not human," which was even worse.

He braced for torture, but the monstrous old man with the dragon claws simply asked, "What’s your name?"

"Hao Jian."

"Where are you from?"

"The sea."

"Who’s your master?"

"Uh..."

Hao Jian scratched his head. "I don’t know."

The bird flared up. "Master, Uncle, see how dishonest he is? Let me use my tools—they’re itching for action!"

"He’s not lying," Ghost Valley Lingguan sighed. "His soul is still scattered—it’ll take a few more days to recover."

At this, all eyes turned to the little dragon girl, who sat innocently rubbing her belly.

"When you fought that squid underwater, did you hit the cauldron too?"

"Mo lie ya xi!" the girl denied, waving her hands.

"Really didn’t?" Ghost Valley Lingguan pressed.

The girl hesitated—clearly unsure.

"Her fists can strike directly at the soul and magic. She must have hit the cauldron," Ghost Valley Lingguan said to Li Zhengjing. "This boy’s only at the Qi Refining stage—his soul couldn’t withstand her blows. If not for the cauldron protecting him, he’d be a vegetable."

Li Zhengjing frowned. "But he remembers some things."

"His soul is scrambled, not shattered. He’s just confused—not brain-dead. A few more days, and he’ll recover."

Li Zhengjing checked the golden pages of fate. He had the cauldron, but the text indicated he would obtain the "Taiyi Sword Refining Art." Without deciphering the inscriptions, how could he acquire it?

More importantly, Li Zhengjing suspected Hao Jian might not even know the secret.

If Hao Jian had learned these words before, even in his current state, he should still recognize them.

"How long until he recovers?"

"Not too long—ten days, maybe two weeks," Ghost Valley Lingguan said. "Once I teach the bird and the tree a method to help, it might only take six or seven days."

"Fine. A few more days won’t hurt."

Li Zhengjing shot a glare at the dragon girl.

She pouted, eyes reddening.

Seizing the moment, Li Zhengjing barked, "Next time, you’re getting hung up and beaten!"

The girl huffed, crossed her arms, and turned away.

Disappointed, Li Zhengjing waved dismissively and left the carriage to resume driving.

The youth, watching the only seemingly normal person depart, grew even more terrified.

"What’re you scared of?" the bird snapped, annoyed it couldn’t use its tools. "My uncle already said—we’re decent folk, kind-hearted, renowned far and wide! You acting like this makes us seem like vicious monsters. If word got out, it’d ruin our reputation as a proper gang—no, a proper team!"

Hao Jian looked around. None of them looked decent—or even human. His face paled further.

The Broken Wave Gu, finding this amusing, gathered poison in its head, making it glow green.

The Five Elements Creation Tree panicked. "Second Brother, he’s an idiot. Don’t copy him—listen to Dad, be good..."

Meanwhile, outside the carriage.

Just as Li Zhengjing was about to set off, he noticed a convoy approaching, heading toward Hongshan Town.

"You there—blind or what?" a middle-aged rider at the front shouted. "Parking your carriage right in the middle of the road—move aside!"

Li Zhengjing glanced back. He had stopped abruptly upon hearing the youth had woken, leaving the carriage blocking the way. 

He tugged the reins, pulling to the side.

The middle-aged man seemed relieved and didn’t press further.

But then a richly dressed youth, about fifteen or sixteen, rode forward arrogantly.

"You blind fool, daring to block our path—you looking to die?" he sneered.

Li Zhengjing studied him. *At his age, reaching the peak of external martial arts—even among immortal sects’ outer disciples, he’d stand out. No wonder he’s so arrogant.*

When Li Zhengjing didn’t respond, the youth grew angrier, raising his whip.

The middle-aged man quickly interjected, "Young Master, he’s just a passerby—let him be."

The youth scoffed and lashed out—aiming straight for Li Zhengjing’s eyes.

"Blind fools don’t need eyes!" he spat. "No one disrespects me! You lowly—AHH!"

Before he could finish, the whip shattered mid-air.

The seemingly ordinary young man’s eyes gleamed gold.

A flash of light—and the youth screamed, falling from his horse, clutching his bleeding face. "I’m blind! I’m blind!"

"Stop yelling. Bandage it, or you’ll bleed out," Li Zhengjing said, dismounting and patting his shoulder. "Since you misjudged, you don’t need those eyes anymore."

"Save the Young Master!" 

The convoy surged forward, weapons drawn.

Li Zhengjing waved a hand—horses and men toppled like dominos.

He strode to the rear carriage, lifted the curtain, and stepped inside.

A plainly dressed man sat inside, tense.

Li Zhengjing sat beside him. "A former Prefect, reduced to traveling with trash?"

"You know me?" The man looked startled, tucking away the token he’d been about to produce.

"I recognize the Jiangshang Prefecture seal. My bird’s had its eye on it for a while."

"I’m fleeing Zhongzhou, returning to the Great Flame Kingdom in the Southern Wastes," the ex-Prefect sighed. "This old seal’s useless now. Take it as payment for my life."

"Deal." Li Zhengjing pocketed the seal. "Had you spoken up earlier, I might’ve spared that brat."

"You should’ve killed him outright," the ex-Prefect said. "Born into wealth, gifted but cruel—he’s notorious. I’m using his family’s influence to escape, but his arrogance was grating. Your intervention was... convenient."

"So he tried to blind me to prove his power?" Li Zhengjing chuckled. "Who’s his family?"

"His father is the Prefect of Linyuan—a disciple of Grand Tutor Lin Fuxuan. Since you and Lin have history... care to kill the Prefect when you’re free?"

"Too busy lately." Li Zhengjing waved it off. "You chose this route deliberately. Don’t tell me it’s a coincidence."

"Rumor says you obtained the complete divine body of the Valley River Dragon God. The Flame King returned the Zhaoxuan Divine Mirror—that debt..."

"That mirror was mine. If he hadn’t returned it, I’d have stormed the Great Flame Kingdom. Did he think he could barter with my own property?" Li Zhengjing snorted. "Forget about the dragon god’s body. But I do have the Southern Domain Goddess’s remains. Interested?"

"The Southern Domain Goddess?" The ex-Prefect pondered. "A complete divine body would suffice. What’s your price?"

"The White Luan Divine Bird," the ex-Prefect said. "Once the guardian of Feather Transformation Sect, it fled to the Southern Wastes and fell into our hands."

"Oh?" Li Zhengjing’s brow arched.

"We didn’t know your connection to it, but... after hearing of your exploits, it tried to escape. You know it, don’t you?"

"Deal." Li Zhengjing nodded. "Deliver Bai Xiao the Venerable to Mount Yangguan, and the goddess’s statue is yours."

"Better if I take it back immediately. One of our immortals is nearing the end—time is short."

"Then hurry. Make sure Bai Xiao arrives safely."

Li Zhengjing patted his shoulder and exited, walking past the cowering convoy.

The young master of Linyuan was still screaming threats—until Li Zhengjing casually pushed him.

The boy collapsed, lifeless.

The middle-aged man didn’t dare breathe.

Li Zhengjing boarded his carriage and drove off, leaving the stunned convoy behind.

Inside the other carriage, the ex-Prefect exhaled shakily, his palm slick with sweat.

He had feigned calm, but facing the youth who had once stood against the Flame God-King had terrified him.

The Flame King hadn’t come personally because he feared Li Zhengjing—recovered from his injuries, armed with treasures and allies, while the Flame King was still wounded.

The ex-Prefect was expendable—a pawn sent to test the waters.

"At least the Zhengjing Immortal isn’t bloodthirsty," he thought.

Meanwhile, in Li Zhengjing’s carriage.

Hao Jian had just witnessed the only normal-looking member of this "righteous gang" kill a stranger without hesitation.

"The most normal-looking one here is the most ruthless. And the ones who look like monsters claim to be kind and righteous?" 

Hao Jian shuddered. *Do they have the wrong definition of 'kind'?*
