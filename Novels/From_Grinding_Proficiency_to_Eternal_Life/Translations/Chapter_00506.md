# Chapter 506: Eating is Not an Option

The moment the words were spoken, it was clear: without Wukong, nothing could be done. Without the True Martial Scripture for Subduing Demons, nothing could be done.

Pusa Jingtu would definitely do everything in its power to protect them.

This was precisely why Pusa Jingtu had once invited the World Honored One Tathagata, Amitabha's Incarnation, to remain in the mortal realm. If not for the intervention of Patriarch Pure Yang, and considering that the World Honored One Tathagata was wary of the Dao Lord of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, Xu Yunfan would have been doomed.

Now, that True Lord from the Primordial Origin Sect had blatantly exposed the fruit tree, clearly as a fishing tactic to see if Pusa Jingtu would take the bait.

This was an undisguised, open scheme.

Given the nature of Pusa Jingtu, they naturally would not take the bait easily.

But Wukong was different. The remaining Wujing and Wuneng were also different.

The "Monkey of the Mind" and the "Horse of the Intent"—such is their nature.

Logically and emotionally, Xu Yunfan naturally wanted to add fuel to the fire for Pusa Jingtu.

The Daoist boy, Qingfeng, looked at Sanzang with a half-smile.

"Master Sanzang, why don't you try one? Our True Lord has said that as long as Master Sanzang desires it, we will naturally serve it to you."

Sanzang placed his palms together, his face showing neither joy nor sorrow, a hint of compassion and rejection in his eyes.

He bowed slightly to the Daoist boy Qingfeng, his voice gentle yet incredibly firm. "Amitabha, good, good. Daoist boy, your kindness is appreciated. However, what my group seeks is the Pure Land within the heart, not the dust outside the body.

"This celestial peach was born from the world's evil energy. Though it is a miraculous creation, it is ultimately not a pure object of our Buddhist sect.

"Craving external objects easily gives rise to inner demons and deviates from our original intention of seeking the true scriptures.

"Moreover, such a heavenly treasure, cultivated with such immense blood and evil energy..."

Sanzang's gaze seemed to pierce through the translucent peel, seeing certain hidden scenes. He frowned, his tone growing heavier. "Extreme evil gives rise to brightness. Though it has become a spiritual fruit, its very origin is likely entangled with boundless bloodshed and resentment that has yet to be dispersed.

"It cannot be redeemed without a great Bodhisattva's vow, nor refined without the wrathful fire of a Wisdom King.

"My disciples and I have not cultivated deeply enough to dare rashly accept such karma.

"This celestial peach, this humble monk absolutely cannot accept."

Standing to one side, Xu Yunfan watched Sanzang silently, a trace of mockery in his heart.

This Sanzang, his heart desires it, but his mouth rejects it.

It truly fits the style of Pusa Jingtu.

"Uh... this..."

The smugness on Qingfeng's face froze. He clearly hadn't expected the other party to so readily refuse such a great opportunity.

Beside him, Wuneng and Wuneng were already drooling.

The essence of Heavenly and Earthly Evil.

There was no need to painstakingly collect and refine it. Eating the celestial peach would grant it to them.

It was a great fortune beyond even their wildest dreams.

The two of them were of demonic origin. What good things had they ever eaten in their daily lives? To cultivate even a wisp of Heavenly or Earthly Evil energy, they had to go through countless hardships, and most of the time, they couldn't find a single strand.

How could they compare to now, with such a multitude of Heavenly Evil energy condensed into fruits right before their eyes?

How could their hearts not be entangled? How could they not gaze with longing?

"Master! O Buddha, your cultivation in the佛法 is profound, your Dao Heart is firm, you are naturally immune to all poisons.

"But the glutton in my belly... oh no, the glutton god... can't stand this temptation!" Zhu Wuneng rubbed his hands, his big belly bulging, his small eyes shining as he stared at the peaches. "They say a great fortune is right before us. If we miss this village, there won't be another inn.

"You see, the Daoist boy means well. If we don't accept, wouldn't that be disrespecting the True Lord? This old pig has thick skin and coarse flesh, I can help you share some of the karma!"

Sha Wujing, though usually silent, couldn't help but grip his crescent moon rake, his voice muffled. "Master, the celestial peach... is indeed a great opportunity."

Wukong, or rather Xu Yunfan, naturally wanted to add fuel to the fire, but since Wuneng and Wujing had already spoken, he remained calm and unmoving, just waiting to pick the peaches.

Sanzang simply closed his eyes and shook his head firmly. "External objects confuse the mind, the source of calamity. No, no."

He paused, then added, "Wujing, Wuneng, you must not harbor improper thoughts."

Hearing Sanzang's words, Wuneng and Wujing couldn't help but deflate, suppressing the restlessness in their hearts.

Being demons, how could they have ever tasted such a celestial delicacy? They were used to eating coarse food and bran in their daily lives, so their hearts naturally yearned for it.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan also spoke, his voice carrying a hint of arrogant teasing. "Master, your precepts are strict, and you do not eat these evil fruits.

"But I and my fellow disciples haven't皈依 so thoroughly.

"We have protected you across mountains and rivers, slept in the open, slain demons and subdued monsters. Even without功劳, we have苦劳. Seeing such good things today, it's only right and proper to let our junior brothers satisfy their cravings, isn't it?"

He looked at the two Daoist boys and grinned. "Little Daoist boys, you see, my master's share can be given to us, his less capable disciples. How about it?"

He cleverly turned Sanzang's refusal into a stepping stone: "If the master doesn't want it, the disciples can have it."

Sanzang's expression changed slightly. He subconsciously glanced at Wukong, only to see him scratching his head and ears, extremely impatient.

He sighed inwardly. After all, it was the nature of a monkey. This innate Dao embryo had first been tricked and touched by that monster king in the Eastern Wasteland. Later, to allow Wukong to quickly form combat power, several Bodhisattvas in Pusa Jingtu had deduced the "Great Power and Virtue Wisdom King Battle Buddha Sutra." It did not掺杂 Buddhist teachings; it required day and night worship of the World Honored Tathagata, practicing the Pure Heart Bodhi, and chanting sutras to achieve success.

This battle technique, to allow Wukong to achieve quick success, did not require any of that; one could simply cultivate it. It followed the path of form-refining and ascension.

The Daoist boys Qingfeng and Mingyue looked at each other, hesitated for a moment, and thought that the Sect Master hadn't said it could only be given to Sanzang alone. So they nodded and said, "In that case... it is acceptable. Please wait a moment, everyone."

Xu Yunfan turned to Sanzang with a mischievous smile. "Master, please don't blame me. This Heavenly and Earthly Evil is also what we disciples need. If we can swallow it, our strength and cultivation will naturally increase. Won't that make the journey to retrieve the scriptures easier?

"Think about it, Master and disciples, we have traveled a arduous path for over a decade, covering only tens of thousands of miles. If we don't increase our strength, who knows how many more years it will take to obtain the true scriptures."

Sanzang's eyes were half-closed. He had already come to a conclusion. That Pudu True Lord had placed this Daoist temple right in his path, making it clear that he couldn't leave without leaving something behind.

The position of the Self-King Buddha, in the Taihua Ruins World, is also a top-tier supreme position. The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Primordial Demon Sect would not sit idly by.

No one wanted the other two sects to add another Great True Lord.

"Good, good."

Sanzang said, then fell silent.

Xu Yunfan, who had descended into Wukong's body, couldn't help but feel a little surprised upon seeing this. He truly hadn't expected Sanzang to not even flare up over this.

The hook had been cast, and there was no need for further action. Xu Yunfan temporarily released his control of the avatar, Wukong.

The avatar Wukong just scratched his head. Under the attribute panel, he didn't detect any abnormalities, assuming he was just unable to move because he saw the peaches condensed from Heavenly and Earthly Evil.

At this time, Qingfeng and Mingyue used their movement techniques, lightly leaping onto the peach tree. They carefully picked four celestial peaches and placed them before the master and his three disciples.

Sanzang's share was taken by Wukong on his behalf.

Once the fruit was picked from the tree, the strange fragrance became even more overwhelming.

Wuneng couldn't wait to grab one, but was stopped by Wukong's gaze.
