Chapter 536: Trouble Right After Seclusion

Silver patterns spread upwards, intertwining to form wisps of pure, cold, and lofty energy that emitted a brilliant starlight. This was the form of the Xuanqiong Qingqi, the pure vital energy of the heavens, which nourished the洞天 (Dongtian) space, keeping it suspended and untainted by impurities.

The True Scripture of the Nine Heavens' Xuanqiong of the Divine Thunder emphasized the intertwining of the energy of the Divine Thunder and the Xuanqiong.

Other silver patterns spread downwards, settling and transforming into a thick, potent, yang-dominant, and刚 (Gang) force—a liquid torrent containing both destruction and birth. This was the form of the Primordial Thunder Qi, which constructed the framework of the洞天 and carried the origin of thunder.

Following this, countless fine thunder patterns gathered in the center, outlining a more complex and variable structure.

*Boom! Rumble!*

With the endless energy generated from thin air by the Attribute Panel and the Seed's frenzied devouring, the rice-grain-sized Seed rapidly expanded and constructed within Yunfan Xu's consciousness. Under the guidance of the silver thunder patterns, the space within it expanded rapidly, pushing apart the chaotic void that had formed after his Dao Foundation was shattered.

Yunfan Xu's body trembled violently. The fine beads of blood on his skin's surface were instantly vaporized by the scorching heat radiating from his body. An unprecedentedly powerful aura, accompanied by the pure Dao Rhyme of the Divine Thunder, surged from within him, piercing through the entire secluded abode.

Xuanqiong Qingqi also permeated the area, exuding endless vitality.

If Yunfan Xu hadn't提前 laid down multiple restrictions and used a formation to conceal everything based on the spiritual脉 (Mai) of the Divine Thunder Peak itself, this perfect Dao Rhyme aura—unique to the achievement of a Dongtian雏形 (Chuxing, proto-Dongtian) through the *True Scripture of the Nine Heavens' Xuanqiong of the Divine Thunder*—would have certainly drawn the attention of the sect's powerful experts.

Yunfan Xu naturally did not want others to know about his breakthrough. Many Foundation Establishment True Masters within the Primal Origin Sect had impure intentions, and considering his age, he was a complete newcomer. If he didn't keep some trump cards, he would likely suffer losses when facing those veteran Foundation Establishment True Masters. At the very least, playing the pig to eat the tiger is a timeless strategy.

Once the surging Primordial Root Qi of the Divine Thunder and the Xuanqiong Qingqi within him were completely stabilized, the Dongtian雏形 had already come to a steady rest in his Dantian, the Sea of Qi.

He looked inward at his Dantian. The brand-new world that had been formed after his Dao Foundation shattered and burst open had finally stabilized. Although it was still primarily a hazy chaos, with the Primordial Thunder Qi transforming into a muddy torrent in a thunder池 (Chi) and the Xuanqiong Qingqi turning into starlight and clear energy surging and clashing against each other, and with countless primitive lightning talismans flickering in and out of existence in between, and the edges of the space still slowly蠕动 (Rudong, writhing) and devouring the continuously supplied and nurtured magical power to fill itself... a framework, which could be said to be flawless, had already been constructed with perfect clarity.

Although he was still at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, with the Dongtian雏形, reaching the late stage was just around the corner. The next step was simply to continuously fill it with magical power, nurture the Dongtian, and then completely stabilize the Dongtian雏形 to support it. By using the Dongtian aura he had refined to attract the favor of the Dao Fruit of the Nine Heavens' Xuanqiong of the Divine Thunder, the Jade Clarity, the Nine Palaces, and the Myriad Transformations of Immortality. That would be the moment of becoming a Golden Core True Lord.

Yunfan Xu felt the Dongtian雏形 within him. Every time a vast amount of magical power was poured into it, what was sprayed out was even more refined magical power.

At the same time, his gaze fell upon the Attribute Panel. If he were to cultivate the *True Scripture of the Nine Heavens' Xuanqiong of the Divine Thunder* to perfection and break through the shackles to seek the Golden Core in an instant, would it be an irreversible and unbreakable process under the牵引 (Qianyin, guidance) of the Attribute Panel? This was debatable.

Yunfan Xu did not dare to gamble. The people of the Taihua Lingxu World were too treacherous; he needed to prepare for both scenarios.

At the foot of the Divine Thunder Peak, in the twenty-plus years he had spent in seclusion after arranging his affairs, time had flown by. A marketplace, which had prospered by relying on the Divine Thunder Peak's reputation for artifact refining, had already taken considerable scale. The streets paved with bluestone slabs were lined with rows upon rows of pavilions, with banners fluttering in the wind. The air was filled with a faint scent of spiritual energy, medicinal herbs, and the strange smell of molten metal mixed with cinnabar from paper talismans.

Thanks to the many exquisite artifact refining techniques recorded in the *Eight Sceneries of the Profound Capital, Forging the Heavens and Creating Transformations* that Yunfan Xu had provided back then, many Divine Thunder Peak disciples had taken out loans to exchange for basic artifact refining techniques to gain a skill. Over the past twenty-plus years, the number of disciples studying artifact refining had grown day by day.

In the marketplace, shops selling various types of artifacts occupied nearly half the space. On stalls or in shops, various lower and middle-grade artifacts shimmered with spiritual light, dazzling the eyes. When a high-grade artifact appeared, although it was expensive, it would also trigger a scramble. Flying swords with chilling light, magical shields with flowing talismans, warm protective jade pendants... Occasionally, from deep within one or two of the largest shops, one could sense one or two obscure and powerful spiritual pressures far surpassing that of artifacts.

True artifact-grade items! Although most had their spiritual light内敛 (Neilian, concealed), their grade seemed unremarkable, and many were flawed or of average power, in the eyes of the 99.9% of Qi Condensation cultivators, they were still rare treasures, causing many to linger.

Having just emerged from seclusion, Yunfan Xu, who had formed a Dongtian雏形, naturally wanted to relax. He suppressed the powerful aura of his completed Dongtian雏形 and also used a secret technique to conceal his bone age and true cultivation level. At this moment, in the eyes of others, he was just an ordinary-looking youth wearing the attire of a regular disciple, with average cultivation at only the mid-stage of Qi Condensation, a face that would be lost in a crowd.

Yunfan Xu wasn't刻意 (Keyi, deliberately) trying to be so low-key; it was just that after being浸淫 (Jinyin, steeped) in the murky waters of the Primal Origin Sect for so long, he deeply understood the importance of "not showing off one's wealth" and "always keeping a trump card up one's sleeve." Playing the pig to eat the tiger had long been刻入本能 (Ke Ru Ben Neng, etched into his instincts).

To be honest, almost all the Foundation Establishment True Masters in the Primal Origin Sect were old foxes. Those True Masters who liked to show off and make a grand spectacle had long since entered the Samsara Sea of Bitterness, unable to escape for eternity. Moreover, he truly wanted to see what his Divine Thunder Peak, under his jurisdiction, had developed into over these twenty-plus years. Viewing it from the perspective of a bottom-level disciple would undoubtedly be more authentic. He naturally wanted to see what it had become under the leadership of his master, Bi Yuan, and the others.

Yunfan Xu wandered aimlessly, observing the bustling marketplace and the lively haggling of the disciples. Many people argued themselves red in the face but still didn't动手 (Dongshou, make a move). Yunfan Xu glanced at the patrolling Divine Thunder Peak law enforcement disciples on the street, mostly led by late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators and composed of mid-stage Qi Condensation members. Plus, under the influence of the formation on the Divine Thunder Peak, clouds gathered all year round, and the thunder within had almost turned into a sea of thunder, allowing late-stage Qi Condensation disciples of the Divine Thunder Peak to also cast Divine Thunder techniques and引雷 (Yin Lei, summon thunder) to御敌 (Yudi, repel enemies). This naturally made many people wary. It was only natural to have the home-field advantage.

Yunfan Xu's gaze swept over the various artifacts with rough refining techniques but diverse forms. He couldn't help but curl his lips. The essence of the *Eight Sceneries of the Profound Capital, Forging the Heavens and Creating Transformations* had ultimately been歪曲 (Waiqu, twisted) by the disciples. He had no intention of giving a lecture. If they wanted him to personally correct them, it would naturally require an immense amount of Contribution Points.
