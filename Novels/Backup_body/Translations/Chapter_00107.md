# Chapter 107: Li Zhengjing: I Want to Enter the National Treasury!

The atmosphere within the cave was heavy and tense.

Twenty-four golden dragons supported the cave, preventing its collapse.

The flames gradually died down, leaving behind ruins and scattered limbs everywhere.

The Grand State Preceptor of Great Zhou had a grave expression as he looked at Li Zhengjing before him.

What he was demanding was one of the most powerful treasures in the current world—a single Dragon Pillar from the imperial palace, yet it contained the essence of twenty-five golden dragons!

With the Imperial Seal lost, obtaining this artifact might stabilize the nation's fortunes and prolong the Great Zhou's survival.

This concerned the entire Central Continent, involving countless lives and millions of common people.

"There is no other way!" 

The Grand State Preceptor spoke solemnly, "I understand that for any cultivator in this world, such a powerful treasure would never be surrendered lightly. But you saved the lives of all the cultivators trapped in this cave. I believe you are not a heartless person. Had the Imperial Seal remained intact, I would have allowed you to take the Dragon Pillar without hesitation. But now that the Imperial Seal is shattered, if you refuse to leave the Dragon Pillar behind, you must kill me first..."

Wiping the blood from his lips, he bowed deeply.

At that moment, Yuan Zhengfeng's voice trembled slightly in Li Zhengjing's mind.

"Young friend Zhengjing, some memories seem to be surfacing in my soul."

"What?" Li Zhengjing thought, "This is a serious moment—don't disrupt my thoughts..."

"These memories are related to the Imperial Seal. They seem to be remnants from the Netherworld's Lord Yama," Yuan Zhengfeng whispered. "It appears you might not have to part with your treasure after all."

"..."

Li Zhengjing fell silent.

After a long pause, the Grand State Preceptor, seeing that Li Zhengjing had yet to respond, took a deep breath.

But before he could speak, Li Zhengjing suddenly said, "If the Imperial Seal were to be restored, but without the blessing of the Creditor, would it still function?"

"There would be some impact, but the foundation of the Imperial Seal forged by the Great Ancestor Emperor does not lie in that blessing."

The Grand State Preceptor shook his head slightly. "The material of the Imperial Seal is unique—an ancient divine artifact. There is nothing left in this world that can repair it..."

Before he could finish, he saw Li Zhengjing extend his hands.

In one palm lay a fragment of the Imperial Seal. In the other, a segment of a dragon's horn.

"So the so-called 'ancient divine artifact' is just a dragon's horn?"

Li Zhengjing said coolly.

The Grand State Preceptor's expression shifted as he stared at the objects in Li Zhengjing's hands, his breath catching for a moment.

Li Zhengjing retrieved all the fragments of the Imperial Seal, along with the dragon's horn, and wrapped them in his spiritual energy before presenting them to the Grand State Preceptor.

"If this were merely your selfish ploy to seize my Dragon Pillar, I would have buried you here today!"

Li Zhengjing said calmly. "But to stabilize the nation's fortunes, suppress the ambitions of powerful figures, and prevent the suffering of countless common people—that is indeed admirable."

He continued, "Today, I gift you this dragon's horn. I hope you can use the forging method left by the Great Ancestor Emperor to reforge the Imperial Seal and restore peace to the land. If you fail to stabilize the realm..."

"I will take my own life!"

The Grand State Preceptor immediately collected the fragments and looked at Li Zhengjing. "What do you want in return?"

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin. "I want access to all the Great Zhou Dynasty's secret archives—every record involving hidden knowledge. Additionally... I want to enter the national treasury!"

The Grand State Preceptor did not respond immediately, glancing instead at the wooden box on Li Zhengjing's back.

Li Zhengjing said indifferently, "I won't bring the wooden box inside. I'll enter the treasury alone and take nothing out. But all the spirit stones and rare treasures within must be at my disposal!"

The Grand State Preceptor nodded slightly. "You may enter for one day. Within that day, how many elixirs you consume, how many spirit stones you refine, and how many rare treasures you absorb—that will depend entirely on your own capabilities."

Suppressing his excitement, Li Zhengjing thought to himself, "This is perfect! The wealth of an entire nation's treasury should be enough to fully reveal the method to alter my fate!"

He had already unlocked over two hundred acupoints and was not far from completing the full cycle of three hundred and sixty-five. Even the Human Immortal realm was within reach.

But for him, the greatest obstacle to becoming a Human Immortal was not the breakthrough in cultivation—it was the Great Void Sword Qi of Infinite Transformation he had cultivated!

Currently, he appeared to be a Human Immortal, but the spiritual energy he wielded came from Yuan Zhengfeng.

If he were to break through to the Human Immortal realm himself, he would surely die!

He had tried before—his two thousand or so spirit stones were far from enough to reveal the complete method to alter his fate.

Though he was puzzled as to why the Great Void Sword Qi of Infinite Transformation required so much spiritual energy, he no longer needed to dwell on it. Now, he finally had enough spirit stones!

"Since you've already left the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, why not—"

The Grand State Preceptor began to speak, but Li Zhengjing waved him off.

"I have no intention of becoming emperor."

"I wasn't suggesting that."

"Then it's even more impossible. As the esteemed True Immortal Zhengjing, am I to take orders from an emperor?"

"Fine..." The Grand State Preceptor sighed. "But I have one more request. This time, you saved over a thousand cultivators. In their eyes, your reputation now surpasses even the immortal sects and Buddhist monasteries—even the imperial court itself!"

"You want me to persuade them not to hold a grudge against the Great Zhou Dynasty?" Li Zhengjing shook his head. "They nearly lost their lives here. It's only natural for them to feel resentment."

"This was the Crown Prince's doing!" the Grand State Preceptor said. "The late emperor has passed, and the Crown Prince faked his death to usurp the throne. The next emperor will be chosen by me. If he proves unfit to rule, I will replace him!"

"Who have you chosen?" Li Zhengjing suddenly asked.

"The Third Prince."

The Grand State Preceptor waved his hand, and a figure was pulled toward them by his spiritual energy—the Third Prince himself.

Pointing at the prince, he said, "In the struggle among the princes, the Third Prince emerged victorious, proving his capability. Though he may not match the Crown Prince, he is the most outstanding among the princes. What do you think?"

"Excellent! Truly outstanding!"

Li Zhengjing drew his blade and cleaved the prince in two, saying calmly, "But I don't like him."

The Third Prince's severed body trembled, his eyes still frozen in disbelief, his joy from moments ago now forever stagnant.

The Grand State Preceptor's gaze turned cold, his teeth clenched, but he said nothing.

"He might have been a wise ruler, but he wanted to trade my elder brother's head for the throne. I don't like that."

Sheathing his blade, Li Zhengjing said, "Choose another wise ruler. Make sure it's one who wouldn't dare lay a finger on the Li family. Otherwise... today I beheaded a Crown Prince and a prince. Tomorrow, it could be the emperor himself!"

After a long silence, the Grand State Preceptor finally said, "I can swear an oath. As long as I live, the Jian'an Marquis's household will remain unharmed."

Li Zhengjing frowned slightly. "You'll need to be more specific. What if you promote my father to a prince and my elder brother to a general tomorrow, only to manipulate them later?"

The Grand State Preceptor replied calmly, "Understood. After the new emperor ascends, your family will be properly enfeoffed."

With that, Li Zhengjing turned and walked out of the cave.

Standing high above the capital, he looked down upon the city.

"Fellow Daoists! The Crown Prince was treacherous, faking his death to plot usurpation, committing patricide and regicide. He has been executed by my hand!"

"From this day forth, I will assist the Grand State Preceptor in selecting a new emperor to restore order to the land!"

"May the new emperor prove wise and bring peace to the realm!"

"Should the new emperor prove unworthy, I will strike off his head as I did the Crown Prince's today!"

"All of you came here to serve the imperial court, only to suffer this calamity and narrowly escape death. It is only natural to bear resentment. But with a new emperor soon to ascend, this is a time of opportunity—a chance for you to rise swiftly. Whether you choose to continue serving the court is your decision alone. I will not persuade you either way."

His voice echoed across the capital, shocking all who heard it.

Those he had saved earlier bowed deeply in gratitude.

"We thank the True Immortal Zhengjing for saving our lives!"

Their voices roared like a tidal wave, sweeping through the city.

With a single step, Li Zhengjing returned home, paying no further heed to the affairs of the court.

Upon his return, his parents and elder brother greeted him with worry.

"You killed the Crown Prince?"

"And the Third Prince," Li Zhengjing said, smiling at his elder brother. "Consider it vengeance for you."

"How could you—" The Marquis of Jian'an looked conflicted. "Should we flee the capital with the entire family?"

"No need. The Grand State Preceptor will handle everything," Li Zhengjing said with a smile. "After the new emperor ascends, you, Father, will be the Prince of Jian'an."

"What?" Lady Jia was stunned. "You killed the Crown Prince, and your father gets promoted?"

"Naturally," Li Zhengjing said, turning serious. "Father, you need not worry about the future. As long as I remain alive, no one will dare move against the Li family. A family that has produced a Human Immortal is not one any force would dare provoke lightly. Even the Venomous King Xin Xuan once wreaked havoc. If a Human Immortal were to rampage unchecked, even the Great Zhou court would be hard-pressed to stop them."

For the next two days, Li Zhengjing paid no attention to the political upheavals in Great Zhou.

When the dragon girl awoke and felt the stump of her severed horn, she burst into tears. Fortunately, Li Zhengjing had prepared for this, sealing the room and providing a basin to catch her tears.

Having been away from home for so long, Li Zhengjing reunited with his family in the Marquis of Jian'an's residence, his heart filled with joy. The tension and urgency that had weighed on him for so long finally eased.

But then came troubling news from the outside world.

Rumors of the Southern Wasteland Creditor's appearance were false.

However, within the Central Continent, the Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing the World had slain the former head of the Ancient Moon Peak and stormed the capital to seize an opportunity.

This news sent shockwaves through the land.

The position of Creditor could be usurped!

Kill the Creditor, and you could become the new Creditor, seizing their opportunities with ease?

Discussions ran rampant, overshadowing even the news of True Immortal Zhengjing's display of Human Immortal power in the capital.

Had the former Creditor, after storming the Luofu Immortal Sect, been severely injured, allowing the Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities to slay him?

And now that the new Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities had defeated the former Creditor but had yet to refine the opportunity harvested from Great Zhou, was he still in a weakened state?

Was this the perfect time to slay the Creditor and take his place?

The world was in turmoil. But when Li Zhengjing heard the news, he retrieved the ancient mirror left by the Ancient Moon Peak's former head. Sure enough, a message awaited him: "All is well."

If the former head of Ancient Moon Peak was still alive, did that mean the current Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities had always been the Creditor?

Or had the former head faked his death, passing the hot potato of the Creditor's token to the Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities of the Crossing the World Golden Ship?

But no further messages came through the mirror.

The former head of Ancient Moon Peak seemed to have devoted all his energy to his final scheme, unwilling to spare any attention for other matters.

Then, on the third day, another piece of news arrived.

The current Grand State Preceptor of the Great Xuan Dynasty, Lin Fuxuan, had heard of the upheaval in the capital—the emperor's death, the Crown Prince's execution—and sought to enter the city to investigate and act against the new emperor. But he had been repelled by the current Grand State Preceptor of Great Zhou.

And what had repelled Lin Fuxuan? None other than the fully restored Imperial Seal.

"He's already reforged the Imperial Seal," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "But the speed is astonishing. By all logic, it should have taken at least three months..."

"Yet he did it in three days," Li Zhengjing mused. "Clearly, there are things in the capital we have yet to uncover—things not under the imperial family's control, but the Grand State Preceptor's."

"More importantly," Yuan Zhengfeng added, "the Great Zhou's founding emperor left behind divine artifacts that require specific methods to wield—methods passed down only through the imperial bloodline. The Imperial Seal is the sole exception..."

"The Imperial Seal requires imperial blood to wield," the wall-clinging bird interjected. "I read that in a book. I've been studying diligently lately."

"But this time, the Grand State Preceptor wielded the Imperial Seal to repel the Great Xuan State Preceptor," Li Zhengjing murmured. "It's no longer exclusive to the emperor?"

"Honestly, I've been wondering—was today's outcome unexpected for the Grand State Preceptor, or did everything proceed exactly as he planned?"

Yuan Zhengfeng whispered, "Logically, the capital is now extremely vulnerable. Great Zhou's strength has been severely depleted, and many of its powerful figures have perished. But... the current situation feels even more unsettling than when we first arrived."

"No matter. As long as he can stabilize the realm, it doesn't matter who holds the divine artifacts."

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page in his mind and sighed in relief. "At noon today, I'll enter the national treasury. In a few days, I'll leave the capital."

Meanwhile, in the imperial palace.

The Grand State Preceptor had selected a new emperor—the Sixth Prince.

To Li Zhengjing's surprise, the Grand State Preceptor did not keep the Imperial Seal for himself. Instead, he taught the Sixth Prince how to wield it.

News of the capital's turmoil spread, stirring unrest across Great Zhou.

Though the regional deities harbored rebellious thoughts, none had yet acted.

But officials, military commanders, and nobles in their fiefdoms were already making moves.

The great immortal sects and Buddhist monasteries consolidated their control over their territories, further eroding imperial authority.

Even minor sects sought to emulate the great sects, turning the lands around their domains into autonomous regions free from government interference.

"The realm stands on the brink of chaos. Only the Imperial Seal can suppress these ambitions."

The Grand State Preceptor declared, "But this is a new Imperial Seal. It lacks the accumulated fortunes of Great Zhou and cannot yet suppress the officials, generals, and deities across the land. Your Majesty must master its use swiftly. I have ordered all regional authorities to bring their official seals, military tallies, and divine tokens to the capital immediately, to contribute their fortunes to the new Imperial Seal!"

His tone turned icy as he continued, "Those who defy this order will face the Divine Seal General's army!"

At that moment, a voice came from outside.

"Grand State Preceptor, Li Zhengjing has arrived."

The young Daoist's voice was filled with respect—a stark contrast to his earlier tone when speaking of Li Zhengjing.

"Take him to the national treasury."

The Grand State Preceptor replied calmly.

"Yes!"

The young Daoist departed.

The Grand State Preceptor turned his gaze toward the treasury, his expression unreadable.

The Sixth Prince, however, looked uneasy. "The treasury holds vast wealth—the foundation of our nation."

"The foundation of a nation lies in its people."

The Grand State Preceptor's voice was firm. "He promised to enter alone, without using any treasures to take items, nor removing anything. Presumably, he seeks only a single rare treasure—likely having heard it lies within the treasury. Let him search."

His expression remained calm as he added, "Besides, even as a Human Immortal, how much can one man consume in a single day? A few bottles of high-grade elixirs? A handful of rare treasures? How many spirit stones can he refine in that time?"

The Sixth Prince nodded in agreement.

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing stepped into the treasury alone.

Ignoring the rare treasures, he headed straight for the spirit stone vault.

The Great Zhou Dynasty's spirit stone reserves, accumulated since the founding emperor's reign, were vast. Though monthly allocations were made to civil and military officials—even Human Immortals—as rewards or stipends, the wealth of a nation gathered over centuries was staggering.

Before him, mountains of spirit stones glittered, their spiritual energy dense beyond measure.

Li Zhengjing's mouth went dry at the sight.

With a wave of his hand, he released his spiritual energy to refine a spirit stone. When the energy returned to him, it had thickened slightly.

"Still too slow."

With that thought, he plunged into the mountain of spirit stones.

He grabbed them and stuffed them into his mouth!

Had this been food, his stomach would have burst in moments.

But these were spirit stones!

For any other Human Immortal, consuming spirit stones would not allow instant refinement.

But for Li Zhengjing, the moment a spirit stone entered his body, the golden page refined it instantly, feeding the energy back to him and boosting his cultivation!

Yet this time, his goal was not to increase his power. He halted the cultivation of the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, allowing the spiritual energy to accumulate.

"Still not enough!"

"What is the origin of this Great Void Sword Qi of Infinite Transformation?"

"Why does the method to alter my fate—caused by it—require so many spirit stones?"

"I must have consumed ten thousand by now."

"Still far from enough?"

No longer dwelling on it, Li Zhengjing focused entirely on devouring spirit stones.

He grabbed and swallowed them, each one dissolving into energy within him.

He lost track of time, emptying one mountain of stones before moving to the next.

His head spun from the sheer volume, but finally, the golden page flickered, revealing new content.

"Enough?"

Overjoyed, Li Zhengjing concentrated, directing his gaze toward the "Destiny" section on the golden page.
