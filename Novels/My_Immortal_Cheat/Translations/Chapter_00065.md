**Chapter 65: The Void Star Realm**

Zhou Tian returned to the Prince of Qin's Residence and stretched lazily. With the Elite Tournament over, there seemed to be no major events coming up soon, so he could finally get to properly relax in bed like a salted fish.

"Aren't those Big Brother's and Second Brother's mounts?"

Zhou Tian dismounted his carriage and saw the Crimson Flame Dragon Steed and Green-Eyed Golden-Eyed Lion parked nearby. They were extraordinarily majestic—these were the mounts of his two elder brothers.

His two brothers were truly elusive, rarely seen. Since returning home, Zhou Tian hadn't seen them much.

"Where are Big Brother and Second Brother?"

Zhou Tian asked a purple-clad servant standing nearby. It had been a long time since he'd seen Zhou Yu and Zhou Ying. As they were family, Zhou Tian figured he'd go find his two brothers to shoot the breeze.

The servant was feeding glistening green immortal herbs to the exotic beasts that pulled the carriages. Hearing his young master's question, he respectfully replied, "Reporting, Young Master, the Eldest Young Master and Second Young Master should be in the living room right now."

"The living room?"

Zhou Tian nodded. Perfect, no need to visit them separately; he saved himself some walking—a total win.

When he entered the living room, Zhou Yu and Zhou Ying were discussing something. Seeing him come in, they stopped their conversation.

"Isn't this our renowned Prince of Qin's Heir?" Zhou Yu, dressed in a white robe, handsome and graceful, laughed heartily. Although they had been busy formulating invasion plans, they were still aware of the recent events concerning Zhou Tian.

"Now, when people mention the Prince of Qin's Heir, they only think of you. No one remembers us two outdated protagonists anymore!" Zhou Ying chimed in, his smile as warm as a spring breeze.

"I'm just a fox borrowing the tiger's might to show off, that's all..." Zhou Tian self-deprecatingly chuckled upon hearing his two brothers' playful jabs.

"Why did you suddenly think of looking for us two old men? Didn't you go accompany your fiancée?" Zhou Ying asked curiously. The two of them had been busy with matters of war and thus didn't know that Tian Ling had temporarily left.

"Tian Ling returned to her sect..." Zhou Tian said with a sigh.

"Haotian Sect?" Zhou Yu frowned. He didn't have much goodwill towards this sect, which harbored ill intentions towards Tian Qin.

"Mm..." Zhou Tian nodded. He could see Zhou Yu's displeasure, but there was nothing to be done. Who could blame them when the Haotian Sect Leader had a screw loose? No one would have a good impression of a traitor.

"Big Brother, Second Brother, what have you two been busy with lately?" Zhou Tian changed the subject, not wanting to dwell on the Haotian Sect.

"Us?" Zhou Yu and Zhou Ying exchanged a glance. Zhou Tian didn't know how they communicated with their eyes, but then Zhou Yu spoke, "It's nothing major. A few days ago, a new world was discovered in the Void Star Realm. These past two days, we've been formulating plans for that world. Since this world is quite powerful, and different information is collected daily, the plans need constant revision..."

"A new world?" Zhou Tian's spirits immediately lifted. That day, he had heard Zhou Yu mention their continuous conquests of new worlds in the void, but he never had the chance to delve deeper. Now was the perfect opportunity to inquire.

"Can you tell me about this new world?" Zhou Tian asked.

Zhou Ying glanced at Zhou Yu, who paused for a moment before replying, "It's fine to tell you... you'll find out sooner or later anyway."

"The Void Star Realm is a boundless space; at least, we haven't explored its limits. Within it are many worlds. These worlds are difficult to find through ordinary means because the distance between them isn't merely spatial. Sometimes, it even involves temporal distance."

"This time, we found a new world through incredibly vast world fluctuations. Only when something happens within a world that is significant enough to alter its developmental trajectory will it cause such intense world fluctuations."

"This world is extremely powerful, no less than any of the Ancient Nine Provinces. However, it is currently undergoing a [Great Calamity], which makes it a rare opportunity. Calamity Qi affects the world's will, weakening their home-ground advantage to the lowest point, so it is truly a rare chance."

Zhou Yu paused for a moment, then continued, "There are some deeper things that are hard to understand without direct contact. After the Eight Provinces Grand Competition, your generation will more or less begin to interact with these matters. It's starting in a few days, so don't be anxious."

"A few days?" Zhou Tian was listening carefully to Zhou Yu's explanation when he suddenly heard the last sentence. He couldn't help but be stunned. Weren't there still several months left? How had it suddenly become a matter of days?

"You don't know?" Zhou Yu looked at Zhou Tian strangely, then seemed to recall something. "Oh... right... I just got the news yesterday; His Majesty probably hasn't announced it yet..."

Seeing Zhou Tian's bewildered expression, Zhou Yu continued to explain, "The time for the 'Heavenly Mechanism' to appear has suddenly been brought forward, and it has begun unstable fluctuations. The period is within the next two years, so your time has also been moved up... It's still unclear exactly how much earlier. At the slowest, it'll be in about a month; at the fastest, it'll begin within a week!"

"Really?" Zhou Tian's heart swelled with joy. Heaven was finally starting to favor him, the protagonist! He could finally go out and rack up deaths! Being stuck in the Imperial Capital had stifled him; he couldn't even die when he wanted to.

"The news is true, but you must be careful. The Eight Provinces Grand Competition is not child's play, and the Ninth Province is not the Imperial Capital. It's a place where dragons and snakes are mixed, extremely dangerous!" Zhou Yu warned when he saw the joy on Zhou Tian's face.

"Mm, I know what I'm doing." Zhou Tian replied. Dangerous? The more dangerous, the better. If it's not dangerous, what would I even go there for?

"I still don't understand what's going on with your divine ability. Your body clearly still can't hold spiritual energy. Otherwise, I could have given you a few items for self-defense." Zhou Ying sighed, speaking with a hint of meaning. This was a mystery that perplexed many: Zhou Tian's body was clearly blocked in all apertures, utterly incapable of containing spiritual energy, so how could he use such an inconceivable divine ability?

"Hehe..." Zhou Tian gave a polite chuckle and didn't elaborate further.

"Alright, alright, stop lounging around here. The Ninth Province has a special location; you can't teleport directly there. It'll take a few days of travel, so your good days are numbered." Zhou Ying said impatiently, seeing Zhou Tian hold back. "If you're not going to say, I don't want to know anyway."

"Hehe... Then this little brother will take his leave now..." Zhou Tian rubbed his head and smiled.

"Hurry up and go..." Zhou Ying waved his hand, and Zhou Yu also nodded. Zhou Tian then turned and left.

He planned to thoroughly examine the information on the Ninth Province to identify dangerous areas, so he could properly venture into them when the time came.
