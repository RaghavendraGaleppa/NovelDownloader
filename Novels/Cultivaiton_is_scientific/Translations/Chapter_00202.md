# Chapter 202: Taking a Disciple

Tianmu Peak was bustling with excitement today—Elder Su was taking on a formal disciple, his fifth in total.

Early in the morning, Li Shiming was summoned to the Gathering Immortals Pavilion on Tianmu Peak to stand outside and receive guests alongside Xu Chuan. The other two senior brothers and senior sister had sent word that they would return today, so only the two juniors stood guard at the pavilion's entrance.

"Uncle Wu, you've arrived! Master is inside brewing spirit tea, waiting for you!" Several figures descended before the pavilion. Xu Chuan stepped forward quickly, pulling Li Shiming along as they both bowed. Xu Chuan smiled as he spoke.

"Xu Chuan, always the smooth talker. That spirit tea your master is brewing was taken from my stash!" Elder Wu chuckled, giving Xu Chuan a light pat before turning his scrutinizing gaze toward Li Shiming, curiosity evident in his eyes.

It was no surprise—Elder Su was notoriously strict in selecting disciples. Among the many Golden Core cultivators, Elder Su had relatively few disciples. Many of his old friends had tried to recommend their juniors, only to be rejected.

"Senior brothers, this is my junior brother Li Shiming. Please look out for him in the future!" Xu Chuan had already begun introducing Li Shiming to the disciples accompanying Elder Wu.

Li Shiming understood the importance of connections. Those invited today were likely Elder Su's closest friends, forming a natural alliance within the sect.

Five Golden Core elders arrived in succession, elevating the ceremony to an exceptionally high level. Each time one arrived, Xu Chuan meticulously introduced Li Shiming, ensuring he became acquainted with both the elders and their disciples.

"Uncle Ma!" Just as Li Shiming thought no more guests would come, Xu Chuan stepped forward with utmost respect, bowing deeply.

Li Shiming saw a youthful-looking cultivator with an overwhelming Golden Core aura—another elder.

"Xu Chuan, how did you get injured so badly?" Uncle Ma tossed a bottle of pills toward Xu Chuan while scrutinizing him.

"Thank you, Uncle Ma!" Xu Chuan replied brightly, then explained with a smile, "I had a fierce battle with a four-clawed flood dragon in the Hundred Thousand Mountains."

"You must have used up quite a few of Xiao Su's life-saving treasures. Stay put after returning and recover properly," Uncle Ma said with a wave of his hand before turning his gaze to Li Shiming.

He already knew why Elder Su had chosen Li Shiming—the most crucial reason being that Li Shiming had single-handedly retrieved the third-grade spirit herb, Muyang Three-Leaf Grass, for Elder Su.

"Your fire spiritual power seems unusual. Come visit me sometime to learn alchemy," Uncle Ma remarked after sensing something peculiar.

"Quick, thank Uncle Ma!" Xu Chuan urged, nudging Li Shiming as if afraid Uncle Ma might change his mind.

"Thank you, Uncle Ma!" Li Shiming bowed gratefully.

Internally, he was unsettled. The so-called "unusual fire spiritual power" likely referred to the flickering flame within him. Clearly, Uncle Ma had noticed something but chose not to elaborate. Li Shiming resolved to visit him soon—if nothing else, he might learn more about the mysterious flame residing in his spiritual lake.

Uncle Ma patted Xu Chuan lightly before entering the pavilion.

Just as Xu Chuan was about to lead Li Shiming inside, three flying boats approached.

"It's Senior Sister and the others!" Xu Chuan exclaimed, waving excitedly.

The boats landed, and three figures disembarked, stowing their vessels away.

The leader was a striking woman—towering at over seven feet tall, with proportions to match her height. Standing before her, most male cultivators would feel dwarfed. Her aura was nearly identical to that of the Crimson Sun Bear—Li Shiming deduced she was at the half-step Golden Core stage, the strongest among Foundation Establishment cultivators.

"I'm your senior sister, Ye Jingxian. You must be Junior Brother Li, Master's new disciple?" Ye Jingxian pushed Xu Chuan aside and enveloped Li Shiming in a crushing embrace.

The hug was humiliating—despite Li Shiming's own height of six-foot-three, he felt like a child in her arms. The sight was so awkward that the other three senior brothers averted their eyes.

"Junior Brother Li, thank you. Without you, Master would have suffered greatly!" Ye Jingxian said earnestly, thumping his back. 

The four disciples had exhausted all avenues searching for the Muyang Three-Leaf Grass. Third-grade spirit herbs were rare—unless transplanted by a sect, they were fiercely guarded by powerful cultivators or spirit beasts.

Ye Jingxian and the others had spent countless favors and effort to no avail. Then came the news that their master's new disciple had retrieved the herb, curing Elder Su's injury.

"From now on, if anyone in the Shu Mountain Sect bullies you, tell me. I'll handle them—even Golden Core elders won't be off-limits once I break through!" Ye Jingxian declared boldly.

"Senior Sister, could you let go first?" Li Shiming struggled to reply.

"Oh, right!" Ye Jingxian released him with a laugh.

"Little Xu, are all the guests here?" she asked, turning to Xu Chuan.

"All accounted for," Xu Chuan replied weakly, his dignity thoroughly crushed by the nickname.

"Let's head in!" Ye Jingxian waved.

"Wait, Senior Sister! We haven't even introduced ourselves to Junior Brother!" a burly, bearded man protested.

"Right—this is your Second Senior Brother, Wan Zheng. Weak, goes down in one punch. This is Third Senior Brother, Lu Shi, can't even take half a punch. Since you're a body cultivator, let's spar sometime!" Ye Jingxian's introductions were brutally succinct.

She had noticed Li Shiming's exceptional physique during the hug—even Lu Shi couldn't compare. Grateful for saving their master and impressed by his talent, Ye Jingxian took an immediate liking to him.

Inside, the atmosphere was lively. The Golden Core elders chatted amiably while their disciples mingled nearby.

"Everyone, you've met Li Shiming. Today, I formally take him as my disciple. Bear witness, fellow Daoists!" Elder Su announced, gesturing toward Li Shiming.

"Old Su, I'm not convinced. Aside from retrieving the herb, what makes him worthy?" Elder Wang challenged bluntly.

As close friends, they spoke freely. Senior Sister Ye Jingxian explained via voice transmission—Elder Wang had once recommended a junior, only to be rejected for "lack of talent." Seeing a mere triple-spiritual-rooted Li Shiming accepted naturally rankled.

"Old Wang, you just want to test him. Li Shiming, demonstrate your skills—use your best technique!" Elder Su instructed.

He had planned this regardless, wanting his friends to recognize Li Shiming's potential, which would aid his future in the sect.

"Yes, Master, Elders." Stepping forward at Ye Jingxian's push, Li Shiming bowed.

For his strongest display, he chose the Nine Palaces Sword Array. With a thought, nine flying swords shot out, weaving like dragons as sword intent surged. Even among mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators, few could withstand this assault.

"Such sword intent! Old Zhao, is this kid a sword cultivator?" Elder Wu asked Elder Zhao, the only sword cultivator present.

"Not quite, but his sword intent is exceptional for his level. Pity he's with Old Su," Elder Zhao sighed.

"Old Zhao, he's not a sword cultivator!" Elder Su retorted, though inwardly surprised—he hadn't detected Li Shiming's sword intent during their earlier interactions.

Li Shiming wasn't done. The nine swords embedded into the ground, forming an array that conjured lightning. Simultaneously, he cast Thunderstrike—a spell he'd refined to a one-second cast time, the limit for his current realm.

The combination of the lightning-infused array and instant Thunderstrike created a deadly trap—enemies would be struck before realizing they were under attack.

The elders, seasoned veterans, immediately grasped the lethality.

"Li Shiming, are you proficient in formations?" Elder Qian, an intermediate formation master himself, asked curiously.

The complexity of the instant array stumped even him. Mentally placing himself inside, he concluded only late-Foundation Establishment power could break free—mid-stage cultivators would be helpless.

"I'm an advanced formation master," Li Shiming admitted.

Elder Su's eye twitched—another undisclosed skill. He made a mental note to reprimand the intelligence gatherers later.

"Old Su, a sword-intent-wielding thunder cultivator who's also an advanced formation master? I fear you'll ruin him. Let me teach him the sword path!" Elder Zhao interjected.

To him, using nine swords and formations was a distraction—true sword cultivators focused on a single blade, shattering all techniques with one strike.

"Old Zhao, I told you—he's not a sword cultivator. He aspires to be a spellcaster!" Elder Su clarified.

"What a waste," Elder Zhao lamented. In all his years, he'd never seen a Foundation Establishment beginner with such innate sword intent.

As the demonstration concluded, the elders—except Zhao—praised Li Shiming lavishly, congratulating Elder Su on acquiring such a talented disciple. Their prepared gifts grew more generous—exceptional talent deserved exceptional treatment.

As for the triple spiritual roots? With Elder Su's resources and Li Shiming's talents, his future was undoubtedly bright.
