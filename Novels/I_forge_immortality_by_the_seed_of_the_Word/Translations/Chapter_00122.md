# Chapter 120: The Vermilion Radiance Grand Grotto-Heaven

**Qingxiao Profound Bright Heaven**  
At the infinite heights.  

An immeasurable sea of spiritual light gathered, where the supreme principles of heaven and earth manifested as tangible entities, condensing into divine runes of law—appearing and vanishing intermittently.  

It was profoundly mysterious and divine.  

Nine majestic and boundless great suns hovered silently within the sea of spiritual light, casting down countless divine rays.  

Suddenly.  

The silence was broken.  

"Primordial True Intent! This child is suited to cultivate in my Vermilion Radiance Grand Grotto-Heaven. What say you, fellow Daoists?"  

A vast and majestic Dao voice, carrying a hint of domineering authority, slowly emanated from one of the great suns.  

It was enough to momentarily freeze the boundless sea of spiritual light.  

The moment the voice faded.  

The other eight great suns also erupted with terrifying fluctuations of Dao laws, as if opposing the earlier proclamation.  

Countless Daos and principles intertwined and clashed.  

Instantly, the endless sea of spiritual light surged with towering waves.  

An immeasurable amount of time passed.  

"Agreed!"  

"Agreed!"  

Eight equally majestic Dao voices rang out one after another, tinged with a trace of resignation.  

---  

The sky was dim, tinged with a bloody hue.  

Beneath this crimson sky lay an endless expanse of black, turbid, and turbulent seawater. Towering waves, carrying overwhelming demonic howls, surged endlessly.  

Even more peculiar.  

Within this ink-black, murky sea, countless pale faces of varying appearances and expressions floated and sank.  

Greed, lust, envy, resentment...  

Every deepest desire and grudge of living beings seemed to converge here.  

This was the **Sea of Sinful Desires**!  

At this moment.  

At the heart of the Sea of Sinful Desires.  

Billions of demons of all shapes and sizes continuously emerged from the turbid waters. After letting out eerie howls—some greedy, some hateful, some vengeful—they charged straight toward a handsome man clad in azure immortal robes.  

The demons converged into an endless black torrent, their aura overwhelming, as if intent on drowning and tearing apart everything in their path.  

Among them.  

There were demons as weak as Qi Refiners, and demons as strong as Immortals.  

Yet.  

Faced with such a terrifying sight.  

The handsome man merely revealed a faint, amused smile.  

"Haha, come, come! Fellow Daoists, let me show you the effectiveness of this new dog leash I've devised!"  

His gentle voice effortlessly drowned out the howls of billions of demons.  

As if strolling through a garden.  

The man walked across the water, leisurely advancing toward the black tide of demons.  

At the same time.  

A three-foot-long bronze chain appeared in his hand, seemingly plain and unadorned.  

With a casual flick of his wrist.  

The bronze chain erupted with divine light!  

Clang—  

Accompanied by the terrifying sound of metal grinding and clashing!  

The bronze chain abruptly began to extend forward, crossing hundreds of thousands of miles in an instant. Simultaneously, the end of the chain rapidly split apart.  

One became two, two became four...  

In the blink of an eye.  

The bronze chain had divided into millions of branches, each firmly binding a demon, forming a massive net spanning tens of thousands of miles.  

The bronze chain slowly tightened.  

The wails of the demons resounded through the heavens.  

Just as he was about to retract the chain.  

A brilliant radiance suddenly appeared in the sky.  

In the next moment, this radiance arrived before the man, transforming into a unique Dao seal that landed in his palm.  

His movements abruptly halted.  

After a long pause.  

"A new junior brother? From the Dragon Lake Dao Academy of the Scarlet Crow Tribe in the lower realm's Jun Tian Domain? I'm to bring him into the Vermilion Radiance Grand Grotto-Heaven now?"  

"Master really enjoys giving me extra work."  

"Ah well, I suppose I'll go meet him. This junior brother sounds interesting."  

"As for these things—let them all become Dao soldiers."  

The white-robed man couldn't help but raise his head, gazing at the seemingly endless horde of demons before him.  

In an instant.  

A colossal phantom rapidly expanded beneath his feet, enveloping all demons within a radius of millions of miles in the blink of an eye.  

A terrifying Dao domain, seemingly forged entirely of bronze, slowly descended.  

Boundless azure light crisscrossed.  

Dreadful Dao intent and laws began to spread.  

The black seawater, tainted with countless desires, began to solidify, gradually turning bronze.  

At the same time.  

The billions of demons trapped within this bronze Dao domain began to wail in agony. Their bodies swiftly transformed into bronze, becoming one bronze Dao soldier after another.  

Time flowed quietly.  

The wails gradually faded.  

In the distance.  

A ten-thousand-foot-tall, half-human, half-bull demon cautiously peeked above the water. After just one glance, it recoiled in terror, diving back into the sea and frantically plunging downward as if its life depended on it.  

**Primordial Beginning Realm! Bronze Dao Domain!**  

These signature techniques.  

Instantly revealed the identity of the man before it.  

The Thirteenth True Disciple of the **Supreme Unity Infinite Dao Sect**!  

Rumor had it that this man had an extreme fondness for "enlightening" demons and monsters, transforming them into bronze Dao soldiers. Not a single demon or monster that encountered him escaped his grasp.  

"This demonic fiend—why has he come to the Sea of Sinful Desires? No, no, I can't stay here any longer. I must flee immediately!"  

The half-human, half-bull demon was utterly terrified, its courage shattered.  

---  

**Within the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven**  
The Tenth Void Heaven.  

A translucent jade talisman flashed before Zhang Jing's eyes.  

**[Primordial Beginning Realm · Level 1 (1/1,000,000)]**  

Skill Trait: Dao Fusion Creation (Immortal)  

The moment he saw this.  

Zhang Jing's vision darkened.  

After checking several times to confirm he hadn't misread.  

A complex expression involuntarily appeared on his face.  

The good news was that the Primordial Beginning Realm skill wasn't like the Polar Light Magnetic Sea—it could be cultivated.  

The bad news was that the experience requirement was absurdly high.  

"I'll find time later to see how much experience a single Grain of Time River Gold Sand can contribute to this skill," Zhang Jing thought to himself.  

If the experience gain wasn't too abysmal.  

He might still have the confidence to use Time River Gold Sand to level it up.  

Otherwise, he'd have to set it aside for now.  

And prioritize upgrading other skills into Dao Seeds first.  

Next.  

Zhang Jing turned his attention to the skill trait of Primordial Beginning Realm—**Dao Fusion Creation**.  

Connecting with the jade talisman through his mind.  

A stream of information suddenly surfaced in his thoughts.  

Before long.  

A glimmer of understanding flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes, followed by a disappointed shake of his head.  

**Dao Fusion Creation** meant that within the Dao domain he manifested, he could freely fuse Dao principles and laws to create new entities—including but not limited to Dao soldiers, magic treasures, and even divine servants—without worrying about the domain collapsing.  

Zhang Jing wasn't sure how powerful this trait was.  

But the only thing he knew was.  

It was utterly useless to him right now.  

Coming back to his senses.  

Zhang Jing once again looked at the luminous white pearl before him.  

A sudden doubt arose in his heart.  

Why was the Primordial Beginning Realm inheritance connected to the **Pure Essence Absorption Contemplation Art**?  

He recalled the vast spiritual light that appeared during the inception of the world when he first comprehended the inheritance.  

Could it be that this spiritual light was somehow related to the Pure Essence Spiritual Light contemplated in the Pure Essence Absorption Contemplation Art?  

The key was—the Dao Academy had several other foundational contemplation arts!  

Could it be—  

Zhang Jing's gaze deepened.  

Was this another test?  

After all, based on his current experience, reaching perfection in foundational cultivation techniques required not only机缘 (opportunities) and天赋 (talent) but also—  

**Unfathomable perseverance!**  

In other words—  

The so-called **Heart Toward the Dao**.
