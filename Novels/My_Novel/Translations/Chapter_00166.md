# Chapter 166: Bullying the Weak? The Madam Helps Me

Li Xian’s killing intent was pure, his vow to take the man’s head unwavering. His blade descended with unmatched ferocity. Yet, a sudden anomaly occurred. As the blade slashed down, shattering stone and tile, kicking up a cloud of dust and leaving a scene of devastation, no blood was spilled.

Cao Kai had been saved. In the blink of an eye, he was hanging high on a tavern by the street. He was still unconscious, a pathetic sight. All the pride of a Cao family heir was gone; his lower trousers were soaked, reeking of filth.

Li Xian reacted swiftly, immediately shooting three flying darts.

A *whoosh* was heard. From an unknown direction, a stone flew out, knocking down one dart first, then using the rebound to deflect the other two. The skill was nothing short of divine. Seeing this, Li Xian knew he faced another powerful enemy. Killing Cao Kai would not be easy now.

“Eighth Elder!”

Cao Nuwu kowtowed frantically. The other Cao soldiers followed suit, dropping their weapons and kowtowing respectfully. Before the crowd, an old man had already appeared.

He had white hair, a stooping figure, a square face, and narrow eyes, exuding an imposing aura without anger. Leaning on a dragon-carved jade staff, his mere presence suppressed all directions.

This was Cao Yuan, the Eighth Elder of the Cao family.

It was indeed a coincidence.

The trouble in Qingning County had fallen on Cao Kai’s shoulders. Cao Kai had been nurtured by the clan since childhood; dealing with local riffraff should have been extremely easy. The family would never dispatch an elder to escort him; that would be like using a butcher’s knife to kill a chicken, a waste of the clan’s resources.

Cao Kai was not a prodigy of the clan either. What merit or ability did he have to receive such honor?

Thus… this Cao elder was truly just passing by by chance. He had other matters to attend to, needing to head southeast to participate in an event. But he happened to pass through Qingning County and witnessed the scene of the day.

Since they belonged to the same Cao family, he simply took a hand to save him.

Cao Yuan nodded lightly, looking at Li Xian. Seeing the young man’s handsome features and his martial arts that had already reached their peak at such a young age, he thought to himself: Although Cao Kai is useless, one thing he said was correct—this youth could be taken as a slave.

He said, “Are you willing to be my servant?”

Cao Nuwu stepped forward and whispered a reminder, “Eighth Elder, this man… this man opposed the Cao family, killed Cao Yun, nearly killed Cao Kai, and cost us dozens of Cao soldiers. How can we grant him such grace?”

Cao Yuan frowned slightly upon hearing this, then relaxed again, saying calmly, “Is what he said true?”

Li Xian slowly reached for his long sword, knowing this enemy was formidable. He could only fight to the death to survive. He thought to himself: *My internal energy is only left with five zhang. If we fight, I must immediately use the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword. I’ll use words to stall for time to recover my strength.*

Despite facing a great enemy, he forced himself to be calm and said, “What if it is true?”

“The young are arrogant. Mistakes can be corrected. Turning back is the shore,” Cao Yuan said indifferently. “Since that is the case, you shall be my servant. Wear the Thorn Armor for ten years to atone for your sins.”

The Cao family’s “Thorn Armor” was used to punish rebellious and vicious criminals. Its exterior was smooth and round, solid and difficult to break, capable of blocking blades and spears. Its interior was full of fine, dense thorns. Once worn, the thorns would pierce the flesh, turning it into a bloody mess, making it impossible to remove.

Moreover, the thorns were laced with a poison that caused unbearable itching. Without the Cao family’s secret antidote, one would be tormented by itch and pain, with nowhere to scratch. It could drive one to madness and despair.

Cao Yuan did not ask for Li Xian’s opinion. Instead, he asked Cao Nuwu, “Is there a Thorn Armor here?”

Cao Nuwu replied, “Yes… there is.” A Cao family soldier stepped forward and undid his clothes, revealing an inner armor.

Cao Yuan said, “From now on, you no longer need to wear this armor. Take it off.”

That soldier looked as if he had received a great pardon. He kowtowed heavily十几 times, his head bleeding and tears streaming down his face, full of gratitude. Then he took off his upper clothes.

The Thorn Armor covered his chest, abdomen, and back, clinging tightly to his skin. Four other Cao soldiers, upon receiving the order, each stepped forward and stood to the east, south, west, and north of the soldier.

They had eight hands in total, each reaching for one of the eight hidden clasps on the armor.

They exchanged a glance, counted silently to three, and then simultaneously undid the eight hidden clasps. The mechanism of the Thorn Armor was released, and it could finally be taken off. As the armor was pulled away by even a fraction, the soldier let out a series of agonizing wails, truly miserable.

Blood splattered all over the ground.

It turned out that the thorns of the Thorn Armor were both thin and long, dense and tough.

They were deeply embedded in the flesh, like roots that had taken hold. Now, as they were forcibly removed, the thorns pulled at the skin and flesh, just like when pulling up weeds, the roots inevitably carry soil with them.

At this moment, the thorns carried flesh and blood! Taking off the armor was actually skinning!

The soldier, having removed the Thorn Armor, was a bloody figure, his appearance terrifyingly horrific. The skin and flesh on his chest and abdomen had been torn away by the fine thorns. His ribs, fascia, and even lungs were directly visible.

But while this Thorn Armor was cruel, it was also extremely exquisite. It avoided the fascia, bones, and vital organs. Although this soldier’s injuries looked severe, and his internal organs were visible, as long as the bleeding was stopped, he could still live.

The scene horrified everyone.

“Good, very good,” Cao Yuan said to Li Xian. “Come before me, kneel, and put on this armor. From then on, be my servant, serve me for ten years. After washing away your sins, you may change your surname to Cao and be named Slave Three.”

Li Xian looked on coldly. Relying on his perfected Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword, his dual pupils, and fighting with all his might, he might not be able to hold his own. He also had the life-saving Yang Qi and the Azure Water Pearl on him, and they were near a lake… Li Xian analyzed calmly, having already calculated his route and options.

Just then, he suddenly laughed, as if it wasn’t necessary, and said, “Old bastard, do you think you’re very powerful?”

Cao Yuan remained calm and composed. “You have just entered the Food Essence realm and have not left this barren land. You are like a frog in a well looking at the sky. The day you reach the second realm of martial arts, leave this poor county, and if you have a sliver of luck to stand firm in a prefecture city, you will then know the vastness of my might, the breadth of heaven and earth, and how precious today’s opportunity is.”

Li Xian laughed. “Then I’ll ask boldly, this esteemed elder, with your immense power, how do you compare to Madam Zhejian?”

He took a step back, positioning himself directly behind the Madam.

Just moments before, the Madam had transmitted her voice via Qi. Hearing her voice, Li Xian knew Cao Yuan was in for trouble.

Cao Yuan’s pupils constricted. He stared intently, as if seeing a ghost. Only now did he sense the presence of Madam Wen. Previously, he had relied on his profound cultivation, his presence as stable as Mount Tai, suppressing all directions.

With a calm expression, he had decided the life and death of others. But now, his calm face finally changed. He was even flustered.

Madam Wen walked forward slowly. Her beauty was unparalleled, her expression cold. “When you look at me, is it a frog in a well looking at the sky, or a mayfly seeing the blue sky?”

Cao Yuan took half a step back, gripping his staff tightly. Sweat beaded on his forehead; his composure was gone. Madam Wen’s white robes fluttered, her long skirt trailing on the ground, not stained by a speck of dust. She circled Li Xian, her fingers tracing his neck.

She did not even glance at Cao Yuan. “Li Xian,” she asked, “how do you wish to handle this?”

Li Xian said respectfully, “I dare not speak rashly.”

“I insist you speak rashly,” Madam Wen said, casting a cold glance at Cao Yuan. “This man just bullied you. Tell me… how do you want to vent your anger? Kill him with one sword, or sever his limbs?”

“You vile woman, you are far too arrogant!” Cao Yuan could not endure such humiliation. He thought to himself that this woman moved like a phantom, likely mastering profound lightness skills; he might not be her match. But he was not so weak that he would be like a fish on a chopping block, waiting to be carved up.

Madam Wen sneered. She flipped her sleeve and drew her sword. The flexible sword shot out like a white snake. It extended on its own, wrapping around Cao Yuan’s neck in an instant. Cao Yuan was terrified. His many martial arts had no chance to be displayed. Blood flowed from his neck, pierced by the blade.

Madam Wen applied a little force, and she could sever his neck. The difference in their strength was truly like a mayfly seeing the blue sky.

“Li Xian, how to deal with him, you decide,” Madam Wen said softly.

Li Xian swallowed a mouthful of saliva, thinking: *I summoned the estate guards to fight in the city. I planned to finish quickly and then apologize to the Madam. I didn’t expect to run into that old man Cao Yuan. Given the Madam’s temperament, her current gentle voice means she will definitely blame me. I’m in for a hard time.*

After a moment of thought, he said, “I will listen to you, Madam.”

“In this matter, I want to listen to you,” Madam Wen said.

“Then… then kill him?” Li Xian asked.

“Not enough,” Madam Wen said. “Killing him like this is too easy.”

“How about… severing his hands and feet, and sending someone to deliver him back to the Cao estate? What do you think?” Li Xian said.

“Good!” The moment the word left his lips, Cao Yuan’s eyes filled with terror. A “no” escaped his throat, wanting to beg. But blood had already splattered everywhere, and his limbs were severed. No one saw Madam Wen make her move.

Cao Yuan wanted to wail in pain, but he had no voice. His throat had been gouged out, and he could no longer speak. Cao Kai, who had just woken up, saw the esteemed elder in such a miserable state and was so frightened he fainted again.

Madam Wen said, “Help him put on the Thorn Armor. Carve words on his face… Carve: ‘A great gift from Li Xian, accepted by the Cao family.’”

Cao Yuan’s eyes were filled with horror. He prided himself on being ruthless, manipulating power with an iron heart. But compared to Madam Wen, he was far inferior. Madam Wen was light and effortless, yet she truly made one’s blood run cold, as if falling into an ice cave.

Li Xian thought to himself: *Cao Yuan has a high status and extremely strong strength. Yet the Madam manipulates him easily. In ruthlessness, Cao Yuan is no match; in strength, he is even less so. The Madam orders me to humiliate the Cao family elder like this; it is to make me and the Cao family irreconcilable.*

He had no choice but to obey. He took the Thorn Armor and pulled open Cao Yuan’s upper clothes. He put the armor on the man’s body. Cao Yuan made “uh” “uh” sounds, muffled and agonizing.

Soon, the Thorn Armor was on. Li Xian retreated to the Madam’s side. Madam Wen nodded and said softly to the Cao soldiers, “You all may take him back to the Cao estate.”

Cao Nuwu nodded numbly, looking somewhat dazed. In the midst of this absurdity… he seemed to be charmed by this snake-like woman, his thoughts complicated. Li Xian said, “Madam, I still want to kill one person.” Madam Wen asked, “Who?”

“Cao Kai,” Li Xian said.

“A蝼蚁 (lóuyǐ - ant-like creature), decide for yourself,” Madam Wen waved her sleeve and turned to leave. After a few steps, she had vanished. Her melodious voice drifted from elsewhere: “Return to the estate tonight.”

Cao Kai woke up again at this moment and saw Li Xian approaching with a blade to kill him. He begged for mercy with all his might, but he could not escape the fate of beheading. He was chopped down with one blade, his blood splattering the tavern.

After this incident, how dared the Cao soldiers and county guards continue to fight? They纷纷 (fēnfēn - one after another) threw down their weapons, waiting to be dealt with.

Li Xian, following the Madam’s will, did not trouble the Cao soldiers and county guards further, allowing them to take Cao Yuan back to the Cao estate.

The Cao soldiers did not dare to stay. They requisitioned a carriage, placed Cao Yuan inside, and rushed back to the prefecture city overnight.

Thus, the events of the day came to a temporary end. The Three Halls and Two Sects scattered in panic, sitting uneasily, deeply afraid that Li Xian would settle accounts later.

Luo Xia walked over, frowning. “Who was that woman just now?”

“My Madam,” Li Xian said respectfully, afraid the Madam might still be listening.

“She is very dangerous, several times more so than the Cao family,” Luo Xia warned. “Staying by her side is not a long-term plan. Take care of yourself.”

Li Xian gave a bitter smile. He was naturally aware of this. If it were about intentions, Li Xian would never be grateful to the Madam. But if it were about actions, his entanglement with her was deep. What happened today was indeed a life-saving grace. A debt of gratitude must be repaid; Li Xian would not evade it.

He did not want to talk deeply, so he changed the subject. Today’s fierce battle, from the East City Gate to the county office, covered about ten miles. There were several rounds of fighting, with more injuries than deaths.

Li Xian tallied the casualties and tried to find ways to compensate and reward them. But his finances were tight; he was truly penniless. An idea struck him, and he wrote several letters, handing them to the Three Halls and Two Sects respectively.

He told them to provide money for the抚恤 (fǔxù - pension/compensation). If their attitude was sincere, he would let bygones be bygones. The Three Halls and Two Sects, being fence-sitters, were naturally willing.

The order in Qingning County gradually recovered.

The evil county magistrate was executed, and the various yamen runners were rescued from prison. Hearing of the fates of Cao Kai and Cao Yuan, they all felt a great weight lifted from their chests, immensely satisfied.

Evening arrived.

The setting sun was like blood. Qingning County regained its liveliness. Li Xian took off his armor and went door to door to apologize, showing full sincerity. It was as if the fighting of the day had never happened.

“Luo Xia,” Li Xian mounted his horse to leave the city and return to the estate. Luo Xia saw him off, arriving outside the city gate.

Luo Xia asked, “What is it?”

Li Xian said, “After today, I will need to stay at the estate more often. I’m afraid I will have little time to attend to matters at the Wushe Hall. Would you be interested in taking the position of Deputy Wushe? The monthly salary… is one tael of silver.”

“Only one tael of silver?” Luo Xia asked with a smile.

“I’m really broke. If I make it big in the future, I’ll consider raising it,” Li Xian laughed.

“Alright,” Luo Xia nodded.
