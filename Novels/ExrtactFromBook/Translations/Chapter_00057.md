# Chapter 57: Master and Disciple  

The divine thunder descending from the heavens contained immense magical power—a calamity that would strike fear into both mortals and gods alike!  

Yet the middle-aged man remained completely unaffected by the lightning.  

His **[Thunder Control]** divine ability was unleashed at full power!  

His body transformed into that of a ravenous beast, devouring the falling thunder in a single gulp—absorbing all of its power into himself!  

This cultivator could actually alter celestial phenomena and use them to restore his own magical energy!  

By now, the underground cavern had been completely exposed.  

Above, the sky was shrouded in dark clouds, with thunder and rain raging in unison.  

The cultivator forcefully raised his upper body from the tortoise shell, stretching his arms toward the heavens in exhilaration!  

His voice rose in a long, impassioned cry, shifting from hoarse to clear and resonant—as if proclaiming his yearning for freedom!  

A second bolt of lightning pierced the void, striking directly at the cultivator.  

The crackling energy surged across the tortoise shell before being wholly devoured by him.  

Then came the third, fourth, fifth—  

The lightning strikes grew faster and more relentless, their flickering radiance weaving into a blinding river of thunder between heaven and earth!  

Bathed in this torrent of lightning, the cultivator let out cry after cry of triumph.  

With each strike, his aura grew stronger, tempered by the storm.  

Finally, even the tortoise shell that had bound him could no longer withstand the endless barrage.  

With a crisp shattering sound, the shell split apart.  

The cultivator was free at last!  

He soared upward along the river of lightning, vanishing into the thunderclouds above.  

The roiling clouds began to churn violently, converging toward a single focal point—as if something extraordinary was being birthed within.  

Han Yue remained huddled in a small corner of the cavern, having witnessed everything unfold before him.  

His horizons had been broadened in an instant, and his spirit surged with newfound ambition.  

The middle-aged cultivator’s aura had grown so powerful that, in Han Yue’s perception, it even surpassed that of Tu Sheng—the sword cultivator who had once battled the giant tortoise here!  

This third-rank grand mage’s mastery over thunder left Han Yue utterly awestruck.  

His curiosity about the man’s origins deepened.  

Then, another deafening boom resounded across the heavens.  

The thunderclouds abruptly dispersed, vanishing without a trace.  

The once stormy sky was now clear and bright, the sunlight breaking through as if the tempest had never been.  

As the winds and rain stilled, Han Yue couldn’t help but fly out from the cavern.  

---  

The middle-aged cultivator had fully recovered from his injuries.  

Now clad in a violet robe woven from lightning, he hovered in the sky.  

Spotting Han Yue, he flashed toward him in a streak of electricity and spoke:  

**"I am Li Changle of the Divine Thunder Palace, trapped here for over three hundred years! My escape today is owed to your assistance, young man!"**  

Li Changle was deeply grateful for Han Yue’s help.  

**"At present, I possess nothing of value to repay this life-saving favor."**  

**"However, I see that you’ve cultivated the *Body-Nourishing Thunder* as your foundation, yet lack further inheritance methods."**  

**"This technique is the introductory cultivation method of my Divine Thunder Palace. For you to obtain it in these foreign lands is rare enough—to have mastered it to such a degree is even more remarkable. You are clearly fated to join our sect!"**  

**"Would you be willing to become my disciple? I guarantee you a true disciple position once you form your Golden Core!"**  

**"If you decline, simply state your request, and I shall fulfill it without fail!"**  

Han Yue was momentarily speechless.  

This was truly a case of **"seeking something far and wide, only to find it effortlessly within reach."**  

The path to the Dao he had longed for was now laid before him—completely unanticipated!  

There was no hesitation in Han Yue’s heart.  

Li Changle’s offer was everything he had ever dreamed of—a top-tier fifth-rank sect’s inheritance, a true disciple position, and a cultivation path perfectly aligned with his current foundation.  

**"This humble one is Han Yue. I have long yearned for the Great Dao of immortality but lacked a true master."**  

**"If Master Li does not find me unworthy, I would be honored to become your disciple!"**  

Li Changle nodded in approval.  

**"Given the urgency, I shall bestow upon you a Daoist name first. Formal initiation rites can wait until we return to the sect."**  

**"The Divine Thunder Palace’s generational sequence is: *Xuan, Zhi, Yi, Wu, Shang, Tian, Yuan, Miao, Li, Sheng*."**  

**"I belong to the *Tian* generation, the youngest of my peers, with the Daoist name *Tianyun* (Heavenly Fortune)."**  

**"As my first disciple, I grant you the name *Shi* (Beginning)."**  

**"Henceforth, you shall be known as *Yuanshi* (Primordial Beginning)."**  

Han Yue nearly choked upon hearing this. The name sounded far too imposing—even ominous! He couldn’t help but protest:  

**"Master… could we choose something else?"**  

**"You dislike it? Then how about *Yuanchu* (Primordial Dawn)?"**  

**"Yuanchu is perfect!"**  

And so, Han Yue officially became a disciple, receiving the Daoist name **"Yuanchu"**—his first true affiliation in the **Jade Void Realm**.  

**"To achieve two great perfections of *Body-Nourishing Thunder* in these foreign lands with only the basic manual is a testament to your extraordinary talent—comparable even to mine!"**  

**"I attained seven great perfections in *Body-Nourishing Thunder*, formed a first-grade Golden Core, and awakened two supreme divine abilities. I hope you can surpass my achievements!"**  

Han Yue nodded solemnly.  

He was currently striving for his third great perfection in *Body-Nourishing Thunder* and knew full well how exponentially difficult the cultivation became with each step.  

For Daoist Tianyun (Li Changle) to have achieved seven was nothing short of astounding.  

Li Changle continued:  

**"The Divine Thunder Palace possesses seven major lineages of longevity cultivation, three of which are supreme thunder methods."**  

**"However, these techniques can only be transmitted within the sect."**  

**"Upon our return, you may choose the one that best suits you."**  

**"For now, I shall impart three secret manuals from my sect—each invaluable to your current cultivation."**  

**"Study them carefully and cultivate diligently!"**  

With a wave of his hand, Li Changle sent a wisp of violet light shooting straight into the spot between Han Yue’s eyebrows—his **Muddy Pellet Palace**.  

Han Yue sensed no hostility from the light and allowed it to enter.  

As the light merged with him, three manuals appeared vividly in his mind.  

The techniques of elite sects were so profound that Han Yue couldn’t wait to return and learn more.  

This country bumpkin had no idea that **void-transmission of techniques** required unfathomable mastery—only supreme experts would use such a method for their true disciples!  

Han Yue scanned the three manuals with his divine sense, absorbing their contents.  

The first was **"Entwined Thunder Robe"**, a secret method of the Divine Thunder Palace for refining thread armor.  

Cultivators must wear thread armor to practice it, weaving magical runes into the fabric to enhance its defensive power over time.  

At its peak, the armor could be refined into a protective divine ability—**[Entwined Thunder Robe]**, the sect’s foremost defensive art, practiced by all disciples.  

The second was **"Thunder Nourishes the Soul"**, an unparalleled method for first-rank thunder cultivators to temper their divine soul and refine their spiritual sense using thunder energy.  

Mastering this technique could greatly strengthen one’s divine sense, and at higher levels, even grant a divine sense-related innate ability upon breakthrough!
