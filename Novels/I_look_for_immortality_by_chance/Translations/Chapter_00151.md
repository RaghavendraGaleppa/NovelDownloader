**Chapter 151: Slaying the Demon, Seizing the Core—A New Home!**  

"How is this possible?!"  

The white-robed youth's face twisted in shock and disbelief as he saw the figure seated cross-legged before him.  

As a rare and unique creature of the sea, his escape techniques were unparalleled, especially in the vast ocean. He had repeatedly checked for pursuers during his flight, yet this man had somehow arrived at his lair before him.  

Fear gripped his heart, extinguishing any remaining will to fight. In a flash, he transformed back into his true form—a pale, worm-like creature—and lunged toward the sea, intending to vanish beneath the waves.  

But at that moment, a terrifying spiritual force surged toward him like a roaring dragon, striking directly at his consciousness.  

"Go!"  

The white worm wasted no time. It spat out a small jade bell, which emitted rippling waves of light to block the spiritual assault.  

**Boom!**  

Yet, unbeknownst to the worm, a delicate jade pagoda had silently appeared behind the young man. From within it, the spirit of a golden-eyed, emerald-haired ape emerged.  

Though the ape's cultivation had once been at the early Earth Demon stage, its current spirit form was far weaker, barely maintaining the threshold of Earth Demon strength. Still, its eyes burned with an intense, radiant light.  

Suddenly, the ape's eyes snapped open, unleashing a blazing mental assault that joined the three-eyed thunder dragon's attack, both converging on the white worm's mind.  

**Hummm!**  

The jade bell trembled violently, struggling to withstand the dual assault.  

The three-eyed thunder dragon's spiritual force alone had already pushed the bell to its limits. When the golden-eyed ape's fiery gaze struck, it became the final straw.  

With a mournful chime, the jade bell dimmed and fell to the ground.  

"Ahhh!"  

Spiritual attacks were swift as lightning. Without the bell's protection, the white worm let out a blood-curdling scream. Its eyes bled, and its mind felt as if it were being torn apart by dragons. The agony was so overwhelming that it froze momentarily, unable to think.  

**Clang!**  

In that brief moment, eighteen sword rays slashed toward a jade-like segment of the worm's armored body.  

**Clang! Clang! Clang!**  

The worm's natural defenses were formidable, its carapace incredibly tough. Even eighteen sword strikes failed to pierce it instantly.  

But the sword rays were relentless, surging like an endless tide. Within two breaths, the armor cracked and shattered.  

"No!"  

The worm regained a sliver of consciousness, its eyes filled with terror. Its demon core flared with thunderous light, and its six remaining legs glowed with sharp, cutting energy.  

But then—  

**Rustle!**  

A vine-like shadow, covered in ancient and mysterious runes, materialized and coiled around the worm. It exuded an aura capable of binding even dragons and sealing the heavens.  

The moment the worm's demon core stirred, its entire body stiffened, immobilized.  

The eighteen sword rays descended once more.  

**Crack!**  

The armor finally gave way, and the sword lights plunged into the worm's body like a storm of blades.  

**Thud!**  

The light in the worm's eyes vanished as its lifeless body crashed to the ground.  

**Whoosh!**  

The sword energy swirled, lifting a round, thunder-flickering object—the demon core—into Gu Yuan's palm.  

From the moment he had seen this core, Gu Yuan had resolved to take it.  

As for right or wrong? There was no need to debate it.  

Had the white worm asked for permission before attacking Suyin Island?  

When the Qingfeng Dao Sect had conquered the Scarlet Moon Valley, had they bothered to list the crimes of the Golden-Eyed Ape Clan?  

In this world of survival and struggle, morality was irrelevant.  

"Congratulations, Great King! You have slain the demon and claimed Thunderwood Island as your own!"  

"All hail the Great King!"  

As the battle ended, a group of small demons emerged from the island's surroundings, led by an elderly, black-skinned turtle demon with a hunched shell.  

The turtle demon bowed obsequiously, leading the others in prostration before Gu Yuan, their voices filled with reverence.  

Gu Yuan remained silent, storing the demon core and the worm's corpse before coldly observing the lesser demons.  

After the white worm had fled Suyin Island, Gu Yuan had secretly followed it using the *Biyou Sky-Stepping Seal*.  

He had initially planned to ambush the creature mid-journey, but noticing that the worm kept circling before heading toward this island, he had held back.  

Instead, he had waited until the worm was nearly at its destination before using the seal to arrive first, lying in wait.  

His goal was not just the demon core—he also wanted the worm's territory.  

Having been unexpectedly transported to the Western Sea, he needed a foothold.  

Suyin Island, ruled by seductive demonesses who drained men of their vitality, was no place to stay.  

This was the perfect opportunity—kill the demon, seize the island, and gain a new base.  

But these lesser demons...  

"Great King, I have served three island masters here, generation after generation. I swear absolute loyalty! You need only focus on your cultivation—leave the gathering of spirit fruits, spirit springs, and Thunderwood to us!"  

Seeing the coldness in Gu Yuan's eyes, the turtle demon kowtowed frantically, pleading for mercy.  

"You've served three island masters?" Gu Yuan frowned.  

"Great King, the Ten Thousand Isles Sea is a chaotic place, filled with rogue cultivators and strange beasts. Islands change hands frequently. This Thunderwood Island was once ruled by a sea ox demon before the white worm took it. We served the ox, then the worm, and now we serve you! We will toil like oxen and horses for you!"  

The turtle demon and the other demons continued to beg, their words painting a picture of a land where power shifted constantly.  

Gu Yuan was taken aback. He hadn't expected such a volatile environment, where island lords came and went, and the lesser demons simply adapted.  

Truly, the soldiers were permanent, the lords temporary.  

"You're over a hundred years old and have served three masters. Do you know much about the Ten Thousand Isles Sea?"  

"Great King, my cultivation is shallow, and my knowledge is limited. But I have gathered resources for previous masters and know a little about the nearby islands. If you seek greater insight, you might visit Flying Fish Island, eight hundred miles away. There's a market there—the white worm often went after seclusion. With your strength, you could surely obtain what you need."  

The turtle demon spoke carefully, head still bowed.  

"Very well. Serve diligently."  

Gu Yuan nodded, then flicked his finger. A sharp sword light shot into the turtle demon's abdomen.  

"Work hard, or you will die."  

With that, Gu Yuan turned and strode toward the white worm's former cave abode.
