# Chapter 21: Lord Dragonfly, Save Me!

A gentle breeze stirred the strands of hair on his forehead.  

Dou Changsheng stood calmly on the muddy path, the Heroic Sword cradled in his arms.  

This was a scene he had encountered not long ago—only now, the roles were reversed.  

Before long, three figures came rushing forward.  

The trio appeared disheveled, covered in dust and looking utterly exhausted.  

Dous Changsheng’s eyes instinctively narrowed as he studied them, for their appearances struck a familiar chord.  

The one at the forefront wore a black robe, his body gaunt and skeletal, as if only a thin layer of skin clung to his bones. His dry, lifeless hair framed a sunken face with hollowed-out eyes and sunken cheeks, giving him the visage of a living skeleton.  

Dou Changsheng immediately recognized him from these distinctive features.  

The other two figures were no less remarkable. One was a towering, burly man clad in a purple robe that fluttered dramatically in the wind, exuding an imposing aura. In his hands, he gripped a broadsword—its blade thick and heavy, stretching six feet in length, with a hilt wide enough for both hands.  

The last was a man in blue, his face adorned with a thick beard, three long strands of which swayed with the breeze. His hands hung naturally at his sides, revealing black silk gloves that shimmered faintly under the sunlight—crafted from some kind of metallic thread, impervious to water, fire, and blades.  

Though the three appeared battered, their striking presence marked them as anything but ordinary.  

Each was a seasoned Xiantian martial artist, having long since crossed the threshold of the innate realm.  

As Dou Changsheng took note of their approach, the trio also spotted him.  

From a distance, the sight of a young man standing in their path, sword in hand, made their expressions darken—this was clearly no friendly encounter.  

The black-robed, skeletal man quickened his pace, unwrapping a bundle from his back and tossing it to the blue-clad middle-aged man. His face was grim, his entire body exuding an aura of death, like a corpse given voice.  

"Scram!" he spat, the word dripping with icy disdain.  

As he spoke, his black robes suddenly billowed outward as if filled with an invisible gale, a torrent of Xiantian inner energy surging forth like a raging river. The energy extended three inches from his body, manifesting as a swirling, fiery aura that radiated overwhelming power.  

The sheer spectacle was terrifying.  

Even his companions—the purple-robed giant and the blue-clad man—couldn’t hide their shock and fear.  

While any Xiantian martial artist could project their inner energy outward, maintaining it as a blazing aura required an immense reserve of power.  

The black-robed man’s display suggested his inner energy reserves were at least ten times greater than theirs.  

More inner energy meant greater strength—a simple, undeniable truth.  

The sheer force of his presence was enough to momentarily stun even Dou Changsheng, who had come prepared.  

His own inner energy reserves were only slightly greater—but that was only because he had consumed the Millennium Earth Pearl. The black-robed man, on the other hand, had achieved this through sheer cultivation.  

Dou Changsheng had once dismissed the man’s future potential, but that was because he had been comparing him to the elites of the Human Ranking—true prodigies of their era.  

The Human Ranking wasn’t limited to a single nation; it encompassed geniuses from across the world.  

With only 108 spots contested among the four great nations, the steppes, and countless smaller states, competition was fierce. Every name on that list represented a talent found once in ten thousand.  

The Great Jin was a major power, yet even it could claim only a dozen or so names on the ranking.  

For the black-robed man to have once ascended the Human Ranking as a Xiantian martial artist—even if his position wasn’t particularly high—was a testament to his extraordinary combat prowess.  

He must have had other hidden advantages.  

Dou Changsheng didn’t delude himself into thinking he could match that level yet.  

*Truly impressive.*  

With that thought, Dou Changsheng took a step forward.  

The Heroic Sword left its sheath in a flash, its blade cutting through the air like a shooting star—a streak of brilliance akin to a rainbow piercing the sun.  

Xiantian inner energy surged forth like an erupting river, bursting from the sword’s tip and extending the blade’s reach from three feet to a full zhang in an instant.  

This was the second stance of the Fearless Sword Art—a Xiantian-level technique.  

Its radiance was dazzling, its power overwhelming.  

The black-robed man, brimming with arrogance, unleashed his full inner energy in response, shaping it into the form of a ferocious beast—claws bared, jaws roaring.  

But the moment the sword’s radiance met the beast, it tore through it effortlessly, obliterating the construct as if it were nothing.  

The black-robed man’s inner energy crumbled like snow under the scorching sun, offering no resistance.  

*"Quantity without quality is meaningless. A focused strike can shatter even the grandest facade."*  

The words of the future Dou Changsheng echoed in his mind as he executed the technique.  

Just as predicted, the black-robed man’s obsession with sheer volume had left his inner energy weak and unstable.  

The *Three Origins Return to Qi Art* was a supreme technique, producing inner energy of far superior quality. Combined with Dou Changsheng’s own formidable reserves, the black-robed man stood no chance.  

The sword’s radiance pierced straight through his chest, obliterating his organs and evaporating his blood before he even had time to react.  

His eyes widened in confusion—then his lifeless body collapsed.  

With a flick of his wrist, Dou Changsheng twirled the Heroic Sword in a graceful flourish, the motion smooth and effortless.  

Had he not mastered the fundamentals of swordsmanship, such a display would have been impossible—or at least far clumsier.  

The Heroic Sword truly lived up to its name as a divine weapon—not only did it reduce inner energy consumption, but it also amplified the technique’s power. Had he used an ordinary, rusted blade, the sword’s radiance would have barely reached seven or eight feet, let alone a full zhang.  

His gaze shifted to the purple-robed giant.  

As Dou Changsheng took a step forward, the man instinctively tightened his grip on his broadsword and barked out an order:  

"Run!"  

"I’ll hold him off!"  

"Take the military pay back to Chen Family Fort!"  

"Tell the True Master… I did my best."  

Having spoken, the giant seemed to expel all traces of fear from his heart.  

He could die here—but his wife and child would be rewarded.  

As a rogue cultivator, he had suffered enough hardship in life. His son would not endure the same fate.  

The blue-clad man didn’t hesitate. He bolted.  

Dou Changsheng didn’t even spare him a glance—he wasn’t alone in this fight.  

As soon as the blue-clad man moved, Zhao Manren emerged from hiding, intercepting him.  

Despair flashed across the blue-clad man’s face. If that monstrous youth had an ally, there was no way he could escape.  

But then, his despair gave way to sudden hope.  

"Lord Dragonfly!" he cried out.  

"Save me!"
