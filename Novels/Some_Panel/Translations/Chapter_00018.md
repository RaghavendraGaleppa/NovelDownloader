**Chapter 18: Is This the Scent of Pills?**

Yang Ji walked along the cave inwards and soon saw two stone doors. As soon as he pushed them open, a wave of heat assailed him. The air inside had become distorted under the high temperature, and visible red heat waves pulsed. It was a sealed stone chamber, only about the size of a single room. The source of the high temperature was a cluster of red flames in the center of the stone chamber, as large as a millstone, rising half a zhang high, burning fiercely without a trace of black smoke; the flames were exceptionally pure.

Yang Ji looked over: [Earth Core Fire, containing a trace of spiritual energy.]

Spiritual energy! Yang Ji's eyes lit up. Although it wasn't a spiritual fire, this trace of spiritual energy was far stronger than flames produced by low-level fire elemental spells.

"In that case, let's begin refining." Yang Ji swept his storage bag, and a palm-sized, ancient-looking pill cauldron appeared in his hand. As soon as he channeled spiritual power into it, it swiftly grew to half a zhang tall and descended with a thud onto the Earth Fire, drawing it completely into the cauldron.

[You begin pill refining; cauldron preheating initiated.]

Upon seeing this message, Yang Ji felt excited, instantly confident. As expected, pill refining, like cultivation, also displayed information. The first step was preheating the cauldron. Once the entire cauldron was heated up, he could begin refining. Pill refining was a task requiring patience. While waiting, Yang Ji took out a thin pill formula and began studying it. The Spirit Splendor Pill formula recorded the required weight for each spiritual herb, the order of insertion, the heat control needed to refine them, and so on. Only with the correct proportion of each spiritual herb could a pill be formed. Heat control was crucial for refining spiritual herbs; too much or too little heat would not work, it needed to be just right.

Yang Ji studied for a while. An incense stick's worth of time passed quickly. According to the formula, after preheating the cauldron for an incense stick's worth of time, he could begin refining. Yang Ji put away the formula, then tapped the cauldron lid, revealing a small opening, and swiftly dropped in a stalk of Spirit Splendor Grass.

[Sizzle~! A burnt smell emerged. The Spirit Splendor Grass was destroyed. Temperature too high. Cauldron preheating failed.]

"Hmm? Temperature too high? Wasn't it an incense stick's worth of time?" Yang Ji's mind raced, and he instantly thought of a possibility. "Could it be due to the different flames used? Did the person who wrote this formula not use Earth Fire?"

He stared at the inside of the cauldron: [Temperature high, 300℃.]

It seemed 300℃ wouldn't work. He would try again to find the suitable temperature. Yang Ji was not discouraged and prepared to try again.

Outside the stone chamber, Huoyuan, who was peeking through a crack, smelled a burnt odor and instantly felt a surge of secret delight, thinking: "I thought he had some great ability, but he failed even at preheating the cauldron. Heh heh, he's probably just imitating blindly. How could pill refining be so easy? The pill formula only gives a rough guide. The countless small details in actual practice mean that a slight error will ruin the ingredients. This young lad thinks he can become an alchemist just by recognizing a few spiritual herbs? You still have much to learn."

Huoyuan's small eyes gleamed with pride. With his hands behind his back, he returned outside the cave with an arrogant expression. Clearly, he felt the young man inside the stone chamber was no longer worth his attention.

Inside the stone chamber, Yang Ji continued to try.

[Cauldron temperature 250℃. Sizzle~! Spirit Splendor Grass destroyed. Cauldron preheating failed. Temperature too high.]

[Cauldron temperature 200℃. Spirit Splendor Grass slowly begins to melt. Cauldron preheating successful. Optimal temperature.]

"So, the optimal preheating temperature for refining Spirit Splendor Pills is 200℃. Rather than 'preheating the cauldron', it's more accurate to say the temperature required to melt the first stalk of Spirit Splendor Grass is 200℃." Yang Ji's heart swelled with joy. After destroying two spiritual herbs, he had finally taken the first step and even made preliminary improvements to the pill formula in his mind.

Immediately after, he controlled the flames through a hidden mechanism at the bottom of the cauldron, maintaining the temperature steadily at 200℃. Because a glance would clearly display [200℃], if the temperature was even slightly too high or too low, he could promptly make fine adjustments to the flames via the hidden mechanism. With the temperature held constant, the Spirit Splendor Grass slowly melted, ensuring its medicinal efficacy wouldn't evaporate.

After it had completely melted, Yang Ji tapped the cauldron lid and placed another spiritual herb inside. As soon as it was placed, information instantly displayed: [Green Leaf Grass is melting rapidly, 2% of medicinal efficacy evaporated.] Yang Ji saw this and quickly lowered the cauldron fire. Only when it stabilized at 180℃ did the melting of the Green Leaf Grass become stable and gentle. Yang Ji then further improved the pill formula, noting down the melting point of Green Leaf Grass.

The Spirit Splendor Pill was merely a low-grade spiritual pill, not overly complex to refine. It didn't require two-by-two or three-by-three fusions to form new medicinal liquids. It was a simple process of melting all the spiritual herbs one by one, then mixing them according to specific ratios for a fusion reaction, and finally solidifying them into pills. After refining two spiritual herbs, Yang Ji understood. The so-called heat control for refining medicinal ingredients simply meant finding their optimal melting points.

He now directly looked at the remaining five spiritual herbs: [Cloud Vine Grass, melting point 160℃. Flowing Cloud Flower, melting point 155℃. Purple Leaf Vine, melting point 100℃.] With all the melting points clear in his mind, Yang Ji began to melt them one by one.

In the end, he obtained seven pools of medicinal liquid. Yang Ji began to leave a certain proportion as recorded in the pill formula. However, these seven pools of medicinal liquid simply refused to merge. Yang Ji was puzzled. He focused his gaze: [Medicinal liquid proportions incorrect, unable to fuse. Cloud Vine Grass medicinal liquid proportion too low.]

"Medicinal liquid proportion too low? But he clearly followed the formula's instructions..." Suddenly, he slapped his forehead, realizing something. "That's right! The Cloud Vine Grass recorded in the formula was fifty years old, but the one he refined was forty-nine years old. Although only a year's difference, the medicinal efficacy contained within was completely different. If he fused them strictly according to the formula's proportions, it absolutely wouldn't work. Even fruits on the same tree varied in sweetness and sourness, and even spiritual herbs of the same year could have vastly different medicinal efficacies due to various growth factors. No wonder they say pill refining is difficult.

"The first difficulty was refining. If not for the Golden Finger's assistance, allowing him to instantly see the cauldron's temperature and the spiritual herbs' melting points, how could he so easily control the flames during refining? Without the Golden Finger's help, if the year of the spiritual herbs being refined differed even slightly from what was recorded in the formula, then the prescribed 'heat control' in the formula would be useless. If one refined strictly according to the formula's heat control, the fire would either be too strong or too weak, requiring constant fine-tuning. No wonder they say pill refining takes three to five days; presumably, all that time is spent on adjustments.

"The second difficulty was the proportion of medicinal liquids. Although the pill formula was a combination of experiences gained from countless refining attempts, each spiritual herb contained different medicinal efficacy. If one rigidly followed what was recorded in the formula, it absolutely wouldn't work. Similarly, this also required constant attempts at fine-tuning the proportions, which was also time-consuming. And who knew how many spiritual herbs would be lost in the process."

After this refining attempt, Yang Ji felt a sudden enlightenment. The pill formula was just a general guide; it seemed practical operation required flexibility.

At this moment, he prepared to melt more Cloud Vine Grass and put it into the cauldron, but just then, the information display changed: [Due to incorrect proportions, the seven medicinal liquids began to react unfavorably. Their medicinal properties changed, and the liquids were destroyed.] With a "boom," white smoke actually billowed from inside the cauldron, and all the medicinal liquids instantly ignited. Seeing this, Yang Ji shook his head, sighing at the waste. These were over two hundred spirit stones, just ruined like that.

However, he quickly regained his composure. After cleaning the cauldron, he began refining again. With the first attempt under his belt, the second time was much faster. The process flowed smoothly. In the time it took an incense stick to burn, all seven spiritual herbs were completely melted.

At this moment, he discarded the formula and directly looked at the medicinal liquids: [Optimal fusion ratio: Spirit Splendor Grass 100%, followed by precise ratios for Cloud Vine Grass, Green Cloud Grass, and Purple Leaf Vine.]

Seeing this, Yang Ji internally exclaimed, "Good heavens!" It was precise down to ten-thousandths. If not for a Nascent Soul True Monarch acting, where would such powerful divine sense come from to divide the proportions so meticulously? Even though Yang Ji had his Golden Finger to see the ratio data in real-time, he still had to carefully remove the excess medicinal liquids; otherwise, how could it be so precise? This whole operation also consumed a significant amount of his mental energy. No wonder they said pill refining required powerful soul perception; he finally understood.

Although the process was complex, the result was very satisfying. The seven medicinal liquids had fused into a completely new pool of green medicinal liquid, and a reaction had begun. The next step was nourishing. Once the medicinal liquid reacted to a sufficiently viscous state, it could be divided into ten equal parts. The final step was pill formation. He channeled spiritual power into the cauldron, causing the divided pill embryos to slowly rotate along the cauldron, only then could he obtain smooth, round, and high-quality pills.

Time slowly passed. After the ten pills inside were fully formed, Yang Ji tapped the cauldron.

Boom!

A faint boom spread, and a rich pill aroma immediately surged from within. The moment he opened the cauldron, Huoyuan's ears perked up outside the cave, and he exclaimed in surprise: "This... this seems to be the sound of pill aura rushing out of the cauldron?"

Immediately after, a waft of pill aroma entered his nostrils, and his eyes instantly widened in disbelief. He said, incredulous: "This is the scent of pills? He succeeded?"
