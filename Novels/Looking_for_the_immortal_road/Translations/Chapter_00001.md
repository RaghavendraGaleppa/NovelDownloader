# Chapter One: Five Roots

The Nanhua Mountain Range stretched over two thousand li, with countless perilous peaks and rugged cliffs where venomous snakes and fierce beasts frequently roamed. Perpetually shrouded in mist that obscured all sense of direction, only the outermost foothills occasionally housed woodcutters or hunters—the deeper reaches remained untouched by human footprints.

Deep within the heart of Nanhua, several towering peaks nearly a thousand zhang high encircled a vast valley. This valley remained perpetually veiled in an impenetrable fog so dense that visibility vanished beyond two or three zhang.

Once, a few bold villagers had attempted to explore the strange mist together. But after venturing a mere dozen zhang into the fog, they lost all sense of direction. After hours of futile wandering, they would finally stumble out—only to find themselves back where they started. After repeated failures, they abandoned their curiosity about the mysterious valley and warned their families and neighbors never to set foot there.

One day, a handsome young man clad in flowing white robes sprinted toward the valley, cradling a newborn infant in his arms. Though his speed suggested a desperate flight, his expression remained relaxed, as if he were merely strolling through a garden.

Soon, the white-robed youth arrived before the great valley and halted at the edge of the dense fog. From his robes, he produced a crimson jade the size of a soybean, whispered a few words to it, and then flicked it into the mist. The jade streaked like a red comet into the fog and vanished.

After roughly the time it took half an incense stick to burn, a fierce wind howled from the depths of the valley, rushing toward the youth before dissipating into scattered points of white light before his eyes.

The youth showed no surprise at this phenomenon. Holding the infant close, he strode along a path that the wind had carved through the fog—a passage about a zhang wide—and swiftly advanced into the valley.

Moments later, the roiling fog closed behind him, sealing the temporary passage and restoring the valley to its usual appearance.

After walking two to three hundred zhang along the path, the fog abruptly vanished. In its place stood an intricate network of countless pavilions and crisscrossing pathways, where a few men and women dressed similarly to the youth occasionally passed by. Hidden within the mist-shrouded valley lay an entire secret town.

"Eh? Isn’t that Brother Jian Han? Back from your mission already?" A dark-faced man of similar age spotted the youth carrying the infant and exclaimed in astonishment. "Whose child is that? Don’t tell me you secretly fathered one outside!"

"Bah! If I wanted a child, I’d have one openly—why sneak around?" the white-robed youth retorted. "I found this baby on the road back. No idea whose it is."

"Found it? Why bring a mortal child into the clan?" The dark-faced man frowned skeptically.

"This little one has spiritual roots—check for yourself if you don’t believe me. Since the clan is recruiting new disciples anyway, I figured I’d bring him along. Strange thing, though—I found him naked on a desolate hillside, not crying or fussing. Searched the area for miles and found no trace of anyone else. Since he had spiritual roots and I couldn’t just leave him there, I brought him back."

The dark-faced man skeptically pressed his fingers to the sleeping infant’s slender wrist. After a moment, he murmured, "Hmm, he does have spiritual roots, but they seem... mixed. Probably not high-quality."

"Pah! As if you’re some Foundation Establishment expert who can assess spiritual roots! Enough chatter—I need to report to Elder Three and decide what to do with this child." With a dismissive wave, the white-robed youth strode toward an elegant three-story pavilion.

Three years later, in the same hidden valley town, a toddling three-year-old boy stood beside a plump, kindly woman in her thirties or forties, chatting softly.

"Auntie Yun, Uncle Jian Han found me?" The boy tugged at the seated woman’s sleeve, his childish voice surprisingly articulate for his age.

"That’s right. He’s the one who named you Wugen," the woman replied gently, stroking the boy’s hair.

Born and raised in the valley but lacking spiritual roots herself, she was one of the few ordinary mortals in the town. For the past seven or eight years, her duty had been caring for infants and toddlers until they turned five, after which others would take them away for training. Accustomed to the noise of children, she had grown skilled at handling them. Today, while the twenty-odd children napped, she seized the rare quiet moment to rest—only for Wugen, the most well-behaved of them all, to pester her with questions.

"Auntie Yun, why am I called Wugen? I’ve heard people talk about ‘Five Spiritual Roots.’ What does that mean?" The boy’s face brimmed with curiosity.

Resigned to skipping her nap, the woman lifted him onto her lap. "Auntie doesn’t know much. They say spiritual roots are born with you. Only those who have them can cultivate immortal techniques. Those without, like me, remain mortals. You’re lucky, Wugen—you’ll start learning the immortal arts when you turn five. Auntie will just keep working all her life." She sighed faintly at the end.

"But what are Five Spiritual Roots? You said that’s why I’m called Wugen, right?" The boy fired off questions relentlessly.

"Uncle Jian Han said your spiritual roots are of the Five Elements—not the best, apparently. That’s why he named you Wugen. As for what it truly means, you’ll understand when you’re older." The woman remained patient, falling back on the timeless adult evasion when pressed.

"Auntie Yun, what’s cultivating immortal arts?" Another difficult question.

"Auntie doesn’t know much about that either. With spiritual roots, you can learn immortal techniques, live a long life without illness, and master incredible powers! When Wugen grows up, you’ll be just as amazing!" Her tone carried unmistakable envy—she had exhausted her limited knowledge in those few sentences.

"Oh. Then where are we now?" The boy abruptly changed topics, sensing her uncertainty.

"We’re in the Jian Family’s home, in the Nanhua Mountain Range." The woman relaxed slightly, relieved by the simpler question.

"Where’s the Nanhua Mountain Range?"

"In the southern part of the Golden Flame Kingdom," she replied, pinching his chubby cheek.

"And where’s the Golden Flame Kingdom?" The boy pressed on with childlike persistence.

"The Golden Flame Kingdom is on the Tianyuan Continent. Auntie’s heard the continent is enormous—even a kingdom this big is just a tiny part of it." She answered patiently, though a flicker of regret crossed her mind. If he asked what a kingdom or continent was, how would she explain?

Fortunately, the boy surprised her with an entirely different question: "Auntie Yun, do you know of a country called the Great Tang?"
