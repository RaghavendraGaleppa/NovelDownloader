# Chapter 35: Encounter with a Demonic Cultivator  

The taste of the food was barely tolerable, but Qin Chong forced himself to eat quite a bit despite the discomfort to his taste buds.  

After the meal, he was led to a small, separate hut. Though it appeared crude, it had been kept clean and tidy by Ren Feng's parents.  

By midnight, Qin Chong could still sense Ren Feng pacing restlessly in the courtyard.  

How could he not understand the young boy's thoughts?  

Though Ren Feng was only twelve or thirteen, he seemed mature for his age and quite thoughtful.  

"Ren Feng, come in," Qin Chong called out.  

The moment the boy stepped inside, he dropped to his knees with a thud.  

"Please, Senior, teach me your skills."  

Qin Chong had anticipated this.  

Given his current level of cultivation, he couldn't determine whether the boy possessed spiritual roots. This made the decision difficult, but faced with such a scene, he couldn't help but hesitate.  

"Do you know how to read?"  

Ren Feng scratched his head sheepishly. "There's a Mr. Wu in the village. I learned a few words from him, but not many."  

After a brief pause, Qin Chong took out a copy of the *Greenwood Art* cultivation technique.  

"I'll give you this manual. But you must first learn all the words in it and understand their meaning before attempting to cultivate. Otherwise, the consequences could be severe. Remember this well."  

"Thank you, Senior! Thank you!"  

"Go now. Whether you succeed will depend on your own fortune."  

Qin Chong had chosen the *Greenwood Art* primarily because it was a relatively simple beginner's technique, complete with diagrams of the body's meridians and acupoints.  

Moreover, even if a mortal lacked spiritual roots, practicing a wood-attribute technique like this could still strengthen the body and prolong life.  

Ren Feng clutched the manual excitedly and hurried back to his room to study it, his young face alight with anticipation.  

Youth knew no sorrow!  

No matter how harsh life was, as long as passion burned within, nothing else seemed to matter.  

Under the cover of night, Qin Chong quietly left the village and continued along his planned route.  

The Cangwu Mountains stretched nearly a thousand miles, but their spiritual veins had long been depleted, leaving the entire range devoid of spiritual energy. As a result, no immortal sects or cultivation families had settled there.  

Along the mountain's edges, small villages had gradually sprung up. The mortals who lived there had either fled war or sought new lands to survive, slowly migrating to this remote area.  

Compared to the other side of the mountains, the Pingchuan region was more hospitable to mortals, with its mild climate and abundant rainfall.  

Thus, Qin Chong's journey northward along the Cangwu Mountains proceeded smoothly, and he soon reached the border of the Song Kingdom. From there, he could skirt the mountains and head south, returning to Pingyang City before long.  

Along the way, he pondered how to explain his unauthorized departure from the mining area, especially since he still carried a considerable amount of spirit stones from the mine. Without a proper justification, he would likely face trouble.  

One night, as Qin Chong meditated in a secluded spot, he was abruptly awakened by an unusual surge of magical energy.  

Accompanying the disturbance were eerie, agonized wails that sent chills down his spine.  

*Damn it!*  

During the day, he had noticed a small mountain village not far away.  

*Could the villagers be in danger? But what’s with this sinister magical energy?*  

After a moment’s hesitation, he decided to investigate.  

What he witnessed upon arrival would haunt him for the rest of his life.  

The wails came from the villagers, who were now engulfed in swirling black mist. Shadowy specters emerged from the darkness, devouring the helpless mortals one by one.  

Worse still, Qin Chong could faintly see the souls of the slain being drawn into a black banner.  

Hovering in the air nearby was a figure clad in black robes, his face obscured by a hood.  

Only his eerie, cackling laughter echoed through the night.  

*A demonic cultivator!*  

*What is a demonic cultivator doing here?*  

To Qin Chong’s knowledge, neither the Song Kingdom nor the Han Kingdom harbored any demonic sects or clans.  

Watching over a hundred defenseless mortals being slaughtered so cruelly, Qin Chong’s vision turned red with fury. His blood boiled, and without thinking, he acted.  

The demonic cultivator appeared to be at the ninth level of Qi Refining, but Qin Chong no longer cared.  

**Boom!**  

With a thunderous crash, Qin Chong unleashed the *Four Symbols Rotating Spear* and launched a fierce assault.  

Yet the demonic cultivator barely acknowledged the attack.  

As the strike neared, the man flicked his sleeve and summoned a defensive artifact, effortlessly blocking Qin Chong’s assault.  

"Keh keh keh… A mere seventh-level Qi Refining brat dares to interfere with this venerable one’s business?"  

"Disgraceful!" Qin Chong roared. "As a cultivator, you slaughter mortals without mercy? You deserve death!"  

His rage burned uncontrollably, clouding his judgment.  

"Tsk tsk tsk… How righteous. Unfortunately, I despise people like you the most. Since you’re so eager to die for these ants, I’ll let you join them!"  

Even as he fended off Qin Chong’s attacks, the demonic cultivator continued harvesting souls unabated.  

"You vile fiend! You’ll pay for this!"  

In both his lives, Qin Chong had never felt such overwhelming hatred. A storm of emotions drove him to this reckless act.  

The black circular shield the demonic cultivator wielded was a high-grade artifact, effortlessly deflecting Qin Chong’s strongest blows.  

Undeterred, Qin Chong maneuvered the *Four Symbols Rotating Spear* in a wide arc and struck again.  

"Fool! Once I finish refining these ants, I’ll add your soul to my *Soul-Devouring Banner*!"  

Qin Chong pushed the spear to its limits, yet the shield remained unshaken. Meanwhile, the villagers were nearly all gone.  

Realizing this, Qin Chong abruptly changed tactics—he redirected his attack toward the *Soul-Devouring Banner* itself.  

The sudden shift caught the demonic cultivator off guard.  

"You dare?!" he bellowed. "I’ll flay your soul alive!"  

The strike proved effective. Though the banner wasn’t destroyed, it was sent flying dozens of feet away, its dark aura dimming significantly.  

The demonic cultivator flashed to the banner’s side and channeled waves of demonic energy into it, stabilizing its power.  

Qin Chong struck again, but this time, with the demonic cultivator reinforcing it, the banner held firm. Still, the man’s expression darkened with fury.  

"Since you’re in such a hurry to die, I’ll oblige!"  

With a snarl, the demonic cultivator counterattacked. Thick tendrils of black miasma surged toward Qin Chong, threatening to engulf him. The *Four Symbols Rotating Spear* faltered under the oppressive force.
