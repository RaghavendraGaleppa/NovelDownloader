# Chapter 11: Li Feiyu

The disciples hidden in the trees quickly reloaded their crossbows. The remnants of the Wolfpack Gang, who hadn't managed to rush into the forest, left behind several more corpses.

Before Han Zhen could give chase orders, Li Feiyu took the lead, drawing his long saber and leaping out from behind the hidden rocks.

Seeing this, the other inner disciples didn't hesitate. They immediately cast Han Zhen's previous orders aside, preparing to pursue and kill. Disciples from the Seven Absolutes Hall were guaranteed to start as Protectors at minimum; these Hundred Forging Hall disciples could only advance by accumulating merits.

Wu Yan had initially just wanted to watch the show, but upon noticing Zhang Xiuer's eagerness, he began thinking about how to impress her later.

"Everyone, come back!"

Unexpectedly, Han Zhen roared, stopping the pursuit.

Most inner disciples halted, but Li Feiyu stubbornly ignored Han Zhen's command. He needed merits. Ever since consuming the Marrow-Extracting Pellet, he had no retreat. Within his limited time, Li Feiyu wanted to strive for the highest possible status and glory. Only then would there be a chance for him to be with Miss Zhang Xiuer, even if it meant severely overdrawing his life for just a few days of joy.

Han Zhen was unaware of Li Feiyu's thoughts. He snatched a hand crossbow and aimed it at the disobedient inner disciple. Han Zhen aimed at the large tree in front of him, preparing to give a warning. If the command was defied again, Han Zhen would no longer hold back. Sometimes, a liability of a teammate was more detrimental to the team than an enemy. Physical dissuasion was more practical than words. If his warning wasn't heeded, then it was simply the individual choosing to honor nature's course.

At this moment, Wu Yan seized the opportunity. He stepped forward, pressed down on Han Zhen's hand, and advised, "Junior Brother Han, there's no need to point weapons at a fellow disciple."

Wu Yan then looked at the unwilling and hesitant junior brothers, raising his voice slightly: "Junior Brothers, you all came down the mountain with the intention of gaining merits. If Junior Brother Han is afraid of taking responsibility, why not let me, your Senior Brother, lead the team?"

Wu Yan believed he stood on the side of righteousness, and with two sentences, he pushed Han Zhen to oppose the majority. He thought Han Zhen would be put in an awkward position, but to his surprise, Han Zhen immediately agreed to his suggestion.

"Alright," Han Zhen said, gripping his eyebrow-level staff and pointing it at Wu Yan. "If you can take one move from me, then I won't mind listening to your commands during this expedition."

The surging True Qi made the disciples near Han Zhen gasp in alarm. This kind of oppressive feeling had only been felt from a few Hall Masters. Han Zhen had been looking for an opportunity to assert his authority, to make these people obedient and not cause trouble for him. He hadn't expected this kid, Wu Yan, to deliver himself right to his doorstep.

Wu Yan, targeted by Han Zhen's imposing aura, instantly flushed red. He knew he absolutely could not withstand that one strike. He had merely intended to embarrass Han Zhen in front of Zhang Xiuer; gaining command would naturally be even better, making it easier to sideline Han Zhen. He hadn't expected Han Zhen to be utterly unafraid of offending people, completely unreasonable. Wu Yan knew Han Zhen would definitely not hold back on this strike. It was better to concede than to get injured and lose face. So, he said nothing, just snorted coldly, and retreated to the side. Han Zhen's "just as I thought" expression made Wu Yan's face alternate between red and pale.

Looking at the inner disciple who had gone deep into the pursuit and was almost out of sight, Han Zhen drew an armor-piercing arrow from his back. To twice defy orders with such guts, if he could evade this strike, then letting him pursue further wouldn't be out of the question.

"Senior Brother Han, no!" Zhang Xiuer cried out softly.

Han Zhen paid her no mind, flinging the armor-piercing arrow at Li Feiyu. The moment it left his hand, the armor-piercing arrow spun, tearing through the air with a hissing sound.

Li Feiyu, who had disregarded Han Zhen's command, heard the sound of air being ripped apart behind him. He was instantly horrified and enraged. Without time to think, Li Feiyu immediately rolled forcefully towards a tree on his right, trying to evade the fatal strike.

The next second, an explosive sound came from the direction he had been chasing. The armor-piercing arrow whistled past Li Feiyu's side, penetrated the thick, arm-span tree trunk ahead, and pinned a panicked Wolfpack Gang disciple to the tree. Simultaneously, Li Feiyu felt a searing pain on his cheek; wood splinters from the tree trunk had grazed his cheek just below his right ear.

Li Feiyu's heart pounded. If he had made the wrong choice just now, he would have been dead or crippled. As a fellow disciple, Han Zhen, from the Seven Absolutes Hall, had utterly disregarded their fellowship and aimed to kill him!

After a few more breaths, the fleeing Wolfpack Gang disciples had long disappeared. That last strike seemed to have been just a warning, with no further action. Li Feiyu cautiously peered out from behind the tree, then looked at the weapon that had pinned the Wolfpack Gang disciple.

On the small path in the forest, as per Han Zhen's instructions, the corpses of the Wolfpack Gang disciples were pushed into the woods on either side of the road. After tonight, they would likely be completely devoured by wild beasts.

The disciple who had disobeyed orders and gone deep into the forest finally emerged. He held the blood-stained armor-piercing arrow that Han Zhen had thrown. Han Zhen looked at the armor-piercing arrow for a few seconds in silence. A simple throw had ended a life. But perhaps lacking a sense of reality, Han Zhen's heart remained very calm.

Li Feiyu held his long saber. He threw the armor-piercing arrow, embedding it in the ground in front of Han Zhen. Blood seeped from his face, but his expression was cold, and there was little fear in his eyes.

"What's your name?"

"Li Feiyu."

Han Zhen was only momentarily stunned upon hearing the name. He knew Li Feiyu was in his team, but he hadn't cared specifically who it was. Li Feiyu had no spiritual root; his martial arts were merely sustained by consuming pills and overdrawing his potential, which was of no help to Han Zhen. Moreover, Han Zhen disliked people with extreme views like Li Feiyu from the bottom of his heart – those who only cared about their own pleasure in life, leaving the aftermath to flood the heavens after their death.

"You have disobeyed orders multiple times. According to sect rules, I can cripple your martial arts cultivation." Han Zhen looked at the defiant Li Feiyu. Perhaps letting him leave the jianghu was a better outcome.

"Senior Brother Han, please show mercy." Unexpectedly, Zhang Xiuer stood between the two of them. This woman pleading for Li Feiyu was completely unforeseen by Han Zhen. Could this be a fated marriage?

Zhang Xiuer had only recently vaguely heard the name Li Feiyu. His performance in the registered disciple test had attracted the attention of many high-ranking figures, but his innate talent and aptitude were truly ordinary. To reach such a level, he must have put in unimaginable effort. It would be a great pity for his lifetime's worth of martial arts to be crippled over such a matter. Zhang Xiuer felt a pang of unwillingness.

Li Feiyu looked at Zhang Xiuer's figure, and the fire in his heart burned even more intensely. In the end, he still needed her to humble herself to plead for him.

"What, you're not convinced?"

"I wouldn't dare!" Li Feiyu's eyelids trembled slightly as he gritted his teeth and replied. He was fighting an intense battle within himself, ultimately choosing to suppress his hatred deep in his heart. Compared to having his dignity trampled, Li Feiyu did not want to see Zhang Xiuer put in a difficult position even more. Li Feiyu clenched his fists. One day, he would surely trample Han Zhen under his feet.

Seeing Li Feiyu yield, Zhang Xiuer, who was blocking Han Zhen, also breathed a sigh of relief. She truly understood Senior Brother Han's temperament this time. If not for her intervention, he would have truly crippled Li Feiyu just now.
