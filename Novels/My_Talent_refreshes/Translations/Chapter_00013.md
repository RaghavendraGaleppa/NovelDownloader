# Chapter 13: Talent Refreshed Again  

By the time Chu Ning finished harvesting all the rice and carried it back to Cao Dongxin's courtyard, it was nearly dark.  

After preparing dinner and efficiently completing the remaining chores, Chu Ning took a quick bath and returned to his room.  

Over the past two months, Chu Ning had grown accustomed to Cao Dongxin's constant nitpicking and had mastered the precise timing for all tasks. He performed his duties swiftly and flawlessly, leaving no room for criticism.  

Seeing Chu Ning's impeccable compliance, Cao Dongxin didn't push his luck too far. Thus, Chu Ning usually had ample time for cultivation in the evenings.  

Sitting cross-legged on his bed, Chu Ning adjusted his breathing and began practicing the *Evergreen Wood Scripture*.  

Without the aid of the *Spring Wood Technique* to enhance spiritual plants, his progress was slower. However, having reached the third level of Qi Refining, his absorption of spiritual energy was noticeably faster than before.  

As the technique circulated, wisps of wood-attribute spiritual energy—invisible to the naked eye—seeped into his body and gathered in his dantian.  

Inside his dantian, three rings of spiritual power were now clearly formed. The bottom two rings were solid and stable, while the top one was nearing completion.  

With each influx of spiritual energy, the top ring grew more condensed.  

Then, at a certain moment, the ring could no longer absorb any more energy—it seemed ready to expand upward.  

Chu Ning's mind jolted, pulling him out of his meditative state.  

**Third Level of Qi Refining—Perfection!**  

Without the fourth-level cultivation method, he couldn't break through further, which left him slightly disappointed.  

He could sense that there was no bottleneck—if he had the fourth-level technique, he could advance in one go.  

*"I heard that once you qualify for independent field cultivation and reach the second level of Qi Refining, the sect provides the complete version of the *Evergreen Wood Scripture* for future use."*  

This thought eased his mind.  

The assessment was in six days. By then, obtaining the full scripture wouldn't be an issue.  

Suddenly remembering something, Chu Ning focused inward, delving into his consciousness. A moment later, his face lit up with joy.  

**[Evergreen Wood Scripture (Yellow Tier, Low Grade), First Level (300/300)]**  

**[Talent Refreshed! New Talent Acquired: *Talisman Source Physique*]**  

1. **Greatly enhances comprehension and cultivation aptitude for talisman arts.**  
2. **Increases success rate and quality of talisman crafting.**  

His talent had refreshed again!  

Chu Ning's eyes gleamed with excitement as he examined his new ability.  

---  

Among the many arts of cultivation, the four most prominent were formations, artifact forging, alchemy, and talismans. Mastering any one of these could secure a cultivator's standing in the immortal realm.  

Clearly, his newly acquired *Talisman Source Physique* was tailored for talisman crafting.  

This meant that with minimal effort, he could develop a valuable skill—one that would ensure his survival in the cultivation world.  

*"What about my previous talent?"*  

A crucial question surfaced in his mind. He checked again and sighed in relief.  

**[Nine-Yin Body Forging Art (100/100)]**  
**[Evergreen Wood Scripture (Yellow Tier, Low Grade), First Level (300/300)]**  
**[Talents: *Yin-Wood Physique*, *Talisman Source Physique*]**  

The display in his mind had updated, confirming that his original *Yin-Wood Physique* remained intact.  

*"My cultivation talent is still here, and now I have the potential to master talisman crafting. The path to immortality is wide open!"*  

---  

The next morning, Chu Ning rose early as usual.  

While he couldn’t reveal his full potential, displaying a reasonable level of progress was acceptable.  

Reaching the second level of Qi Refining in nearly three months wasn’t unreasonable—after all, the first three levels were foundational.  

Some prodigies even reached the second level in just a month.  

Chu Ning’s "three-month" progress was perfectly plausible.  

However, what seemed reasonable to him was nothing short of shocking to Cao Dongxin.  

*"You… You’ve reached the second level?"*  

Cao Dongxin stared at Chu Ning as if he’d seen a ghost.  

While it wasn’t unheard of for a pseudo-spiritual root cultivator to reach the second level in three months, it was still rare.  

The fact that Chu Ning had achieved this meant the sect would undoubtedly grant him independent field rights—possibly even a high-quality plot in the lower-tier fields.  

Even within the lowest-grade fields, there were distinctions—upper, middle, and lower grades.  

This realization drained all the satisfaction Cao Dongxin had felt the previous day.  

A grim thought struck him:  

Once the assessment period ended, even if Chu Ning’s cultivation was still below his own, the sect might value him more highly.  

---  

This realization soured Cao Dongxin’s mood.  

His attitude shifted subtly.  

After breakfast, instead of leaving immediately, he stayed behind to clean his own dishes.  

When Chu Ning moved to wash them, Cao Dongxin stopped him with a wave of his hand, casting a *Cleansing Technique* to tidy the bowls instantly.  

Chu Ning understood the reason for this sudden change but said nothing.  

Instead, it deepened his understanding of the cultivation world:  

**Strength was everything.**  

Merely showing slightly better aptitude than the average pseudo-spiritual root disciple had forced Cao Dongxin to reassess his stance.  

To survive in this world, one had to cultivate discreetly—but occasionally, a measured display of talent was necessary.  

---  

In the fields, Cao Dongxin no longer micromanaged Chu Ning’s work.  

Chu Ning chose a plot himself and began harvesting with the *Blade Edge Technique*.  

This was excellent practice—since he couldn’t advance further in cultivation, refining his spells was the next best thing.  

Using his Qi to cast spells and then recovering through meditation would purify his spiritual power further.  

Besides, wasn’t it natural for his *Blade Edge Technique* to improve after a breakthrough?  

Of course, Chu Ning remained cautious, controlling his output to match a second-level Qi Refining cultivator.  

His technique was still inferior to Cao Dongxin’s, so the latter didn’t suspect anything.  

With both of them working efficiently, the remaining fields were harvested swiftly, allowing them to finish early.  

As they carried the rice back, Shang Zhaoxiang and Qiu Shunyi—still laboring in the opposite field—stared in surprise.  

Since when did Cao Dongxin willingly carry rice himself?  

And how had they finished so quickly?  

Shang Zhaoxiang, working near the path, couldn’t resist calling out:  

*"Old Cao, how’d you finish harvesting so fast this time?"*  

His gaze then landed on Chu Ning, and his eyes widened.  

*"Huh? Chu Ning, you’ve reached the second level?"*  

Hearing this, Qiu Shunyi—midway through casting a *Blade Edge Technique*—jerked his head up in shock.  

Distracted, his spell veered off-course, flying straight toward Chu Ning on the path.  

Neither Shang Zhaoxiang nor Cao Dongxin made a move to intercept it.  

Only after the blade was already in motion did Qiu Shunyi shout belatedly:  

*"Look out!"*
