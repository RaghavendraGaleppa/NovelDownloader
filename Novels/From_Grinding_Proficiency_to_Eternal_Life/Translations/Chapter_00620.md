# Chapter 620: All Three Sword Intents Unleashed

A pristine white jade hand, unnaturally large, suddenly appeared. Its five fingers were splayed wide, perfectly sized to cover the back of Xu Yunfan's head.

It was mere inches from his skull. The shadow of death descended in an instant.

Xu Yunfan jolted awake. The dozen or so warning formations he had laid out dissolved into nothingness without a sound, like popping bubbles.

A Golden Core's power was simply on another level.

Qingyuan True Lord had indeed left a trump card, or perhaps he was simply a beast in human form. To think a Golden Core cultivator would resort to a sneak attack, and one who cultivated a kingly path at that.

Just as the white jade hand was about to penetrate the three-foot radius around Xu Yunfan, a cold voice exploded from the deepest void, carrying an absolute will capable of shattering all calamities.

"Second Sword, Calamity's Annihilation!"

The second and final Golden Core sword intent within Xu Yunfan's body erupted violently.

This Calamity's Annihilation sword intent was neither dazzlingly brilliant nor overwhelmingly loud. Instead, it was a profoundly gloomy, greyish light that contained a pure destructive will—a will to obliterate all calamities and sweep away countless obstacles.

There was no earth-shattering explosion, only a tearing sensation that made one's soul tremble, as if one's very essence was being erased.

The white jade hand, which had been right before him, suddenly turned ethereal, like a reflection cast into the void, and instantly shattered and dissipated.

Three hundred miles away, Qingyuan True Lord, who was in the process of gathering the scattered spiritual energy of the Celestial Palace, let out a pained, incredulous roar. He looked down to see his own wrist, severed cleanly by that sword intent.

His hand had been cut off at the wrist.

"XU YUNFAN!!!"

This roar was filled with a bone-deep hatred and fury that far surpassed his anger from being wounded by the First Sword.

The consecutive eruptions of two Pure Yang sword intents from Xu Yunfan were like resounding slaps across the face of this True Lord from the Primordial Origin Sect.

Especially this final Second Sword, Calamity's Annihilation—it not only thwarted his sneak attack but also seemed to carve the words "utterly incompetent" onto his face. How could he, a Golden Core, fail to handle a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator after resorting to a sneak attack? It was the greatest joke in the world. How could he ever show his face again if this got out?

Xu Yunfan felt the immense pressure that had nearly solidified his soul suddenly lighten. His repressed heart began to pound violently.

He suppressed his churning Qi and the tearing pain, whipping his head around to meet Qingyuan True Lord's eyes, which were blazing with seemingly tangible fury.

The hem of the True Lord's originally magnificent Daoist robe was now torn in several deep gashes by the lingering sword qi. The protective barrier of Celestial Palace's pure energy, which had been completely dissipated by the First Sword, Piercing Delusion, could now only barely cling to his body, barely concealing the wounds carved into his physical form by the sword intents.

The violent tremors of the pocket dimension made Qingyuan True Lord's aura extremely unstable, and the aura of a superior immortal was completely gone.

It seemed... that was all there was to a Golden Core?

Qingyuan True Lord stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan, the killing intent in his eyes almost forming ice daggers that would run the Foundation Establishment ant through and through.

"Xu Yunfan, you are good! Very good!"

Each word was squeezed out from between his gritted teeth. "I will remember what happened today! I will make you suffer a fate worse than death!"

He paused, then a deep sense of astonishment washed over him.

"You were able to detect my sneak attack?"

He had never imagined that his sneak attack would be discovered by Xu Yunfan. The difference between a Golden Core and a Foundation Establishment was like that between heaven and mud. Strictly speaking, a Golden Core was a true immortal, while a Foundation Establishment was no more than a mortal without the strength to truss a chicken. The gap was simply too vast to be described.

Yet, Xu Yunfan had used all sorts of trump cards to stubbornly cling to life until now.

The corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth hooked into an almost imperceptible, Nike-like smirk, which tugged at his internal injuries, but his eyes were terrifyingly bright.

He swallowed, his voice slightly hoarse. It wasn't loud, but it clearly reached Qingyuan True Lord's ears.

"Please calm your anger, True Lord. This disciple is merely returning like for like. We are all from the Primordial Origin Sect; aren't you the most clear on what kind of character everyone here has?"

After all, the Primordial Origin Sect was called the Primordial Demon Sect for a reason—it was earned through deeds.

When Qingyuan True Lord had left, Xu Yunfan had naturally set up nearly a hundred interlocking formations around the area. He had over a dozen formation discs on his person, ready to be activated at any moment, all to guard against this very situation. After all, the people of this Taihua Spirit Ruins World were truly devoid of martial honor. They loved nothing more than bullying newcomers in the beginner's village.

Upon hearing this, Qingyuan True Lord's ancient, dignified face twitched, and then an even deeper fury surged forth. To think a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator would dare to mock him to his face, and he couldn't even retort. The abyss in his eyes froze solid.

Xu Yunfan showed no hesitation or doubt at this moment.

"One way, no return. To the death, no cease. Third Sword, No Return!" Xu Yunfan recited silently in his heart.

This sword was a gift from the Pure Yang Ancestor.

The instant his spiritual will stirred, the dormant sword seal deep within his Purple Mansion erupted with a chilling light. The sword intent rose from his marrow sea. There was no magnificent sword rainbow, only a single, fine, white-gold line that tore through the void.

Its form was as condensed as an ice spear piercing the Nine Hells. Where its trajectory passed, space silently collapsed, and light, dust, and even stray spiritual energy were all devoured, transforming into a channel of absolute, void-like annihilation.

This was the No Return sword intent, refined by Lu Chunyang at the mid Golden Core stage. It severed the cycle of life and death and cut off all retreats of the ten thousand methods.

The sword intent rose from Xu Yunfan's body, carrying an infinite sense of desperation and the will of "ten deaths, no life," solely for the purpose of killing the enemy. The sword light contained a posture of perishing together with the heavens, making one's blood run cold.

Lu Chunyang was, after all, the foremost sword cultivator of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect who had reached the mid Golden Core stage. Even just a trace of the Dao's resonance imprinted within his sword intent, when amplified by the great array, was enough to make a Golden Core like Qingyuan True Lord feel the chilling touch of impending death.

Before the sword light even arrived, Qingyuan True Lord felt the foundation of his pocket dimension tremble violently. He knew well of this sword. When the Pure Yang Ancestor had used this sword to pierce through the Dharma body of the Primordial Origin Sect's Lord of the Nine Celestial Heavens, it was with this very sword intent that it bored through the pocket dimension and annihilated the soul, leading to his complete demise.

How could he not be terrified?

Qingyuan True Lord's expression changed drastically. He truly hadn't expected the Pure Yang True Lord to be so shameless, to have actually left Xu Yunfan with three full sword intents!

"Hah!"

Qingyuan True Lord dared not hold back any longer, frantically circulating the *True Method of the Celestial Pure Qi of Heaven and Earth*. In an instant, a projection of his pocket dimension appeared. The phantom of the Qingyuan Celestial Palace was forcibly manifested behind him. Then, the pure qi of the Celestial Palace surged forth like a burst dam, its grand and kingly Dao image carrying the might to suppress all realms as it met the certain-kill sword.

*BOOM!*

It was like the collision of two worlds. The sword light and the magnificent pure qi clashed violently, unleashing a sound so immense it could tear one's eardrums apart. The storm of wild energy instantly vaporized the seawater for dozens of miles in every direction, creating a colossal, empty pit.

The pure qi of the Celestial Palace frantically swirled and manifested, only to shatter just as quickly. The majestic image凝聚ed by Qingyuan True Lord trembled with a mournful cry.

Though the No Return sword light's power was drastically weakened after being blocked by layers of pure qi, its true essence of "no return, only destruction" still violently pierced into the Celestial Palace pocket dimension, which was already reeling and trembling from the earlier Piercing Delusion sword intent.

*Ugh!*

Qingyuan True Lord's face turned deathly pale. He violently spat out a large mouthful of pale golden blood, containing his very essence. The pocket dimension projection behind him shook violently, flickering in and out of existence as if it might shatter and return to its main body at any moment. His own aura plummeted by a massive margin.
