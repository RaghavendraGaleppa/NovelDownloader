# Chapter 40: Asking the Young Mistress for a Person

Today, Yang Can would be descending the mountain.

He was awakened in the morning by the cheerful chirping of birds.

Even before he opened his eyes, he could hear the birdsong rising and falling outside the window.

After all, he was in the mountains, and it was the season of spring; the very air was filled with the fragrance of fresh grass.

Once he left, it would be like going into battle; there was sure to be a great fight ahead. Thinking of this, Yang Can couldn't help but feel invigorated.

He arched his back on the couch, spread his arms wide, and a series of cracking sounds echoed through his joints.

Then, with a movement like a sparrow hawk flipping over, he sat up.

Soon, Yang Can was dressed and left the bedroom.

Pan Xiaowan had just woken up as well, still lazily lounging on the couch.

The thought that Yang Can was leaving today filled her heart with a sense of grievance.

That little rascal was truly detestable.

Yet, somehow, that only made him more charming.

She liked this Yang Can; from the very first moment she saw him, she liked him from the bottom of her heart.

Moreover, she was acting as a spy in the Yu family. This was a matter where, if exposed, her life would be forfeit.

Living under the heavy pressure of not knowing if she would survive the day, when she liked someone, she wanted to possess him.

Thus, her motive for approaching this young Yang advisor was pure, without any utilitarian thoughts.

It was simply because she liked him.

But that little rascal...

Thinking of this, Mistress Xiaowan bit her lip, her almond-shaped eyes becoming misty again, like fog rising from a lotus pond.

When Yang Can walked out of the main hall, Wangcai was not in the courtyard.

This kid, because his master was not strict, would go off to play with Laixi whenever he had the chance. Yang Can couldn't be bothered to manage him.

Yang Can didn't have much to交代 (explain) anyway. Not seeing Wangcai, he went straight to the inner residence.

In the inner residence, Suo Chanzhi was eating breakfast.

A bowl of millet porridge with red dates and lotus seeds.

Millet, also known as yellow rice, is easy to digest and nourishes the stomach when cooked into porridge, making it most suitable for pregnant women.

A plate of steamed buns filled with羊肉 (mutton) and water chestnuts; the fresh scent of water chestnuts neutralizes the mutton's gamey flavor, making it very palatable.

Paired with appetizing pickled cucumbers and tofu with scallions and sesame oil...

It was evident that although she was pregnant, the Young Mistress was not suffering from morning sickness and had a good appetite.

Suo Chanzhi received Yang Can while eating her breakfast.

They had already agreed that he would descend the mountain for an inspection, so there was no need for further discussion.

However, as he was about to take his leave, Yang Can said, "By the way, I noticed that the messenger girl Qiaoshe is very clever, quick-witted, and hardworking. I would like to ask the Young Mistress for her."

Suo Chanzhi immediately put down her food and glanced at Yang Can.

Yang Can explained, "My courtyard is short of someone for sweeping and chores. Head Steward Li gave me a boy, so he is now short-handed. Since Steward Li's wife, Pan, is a woman after all, it is inconvenient to have only a young boy serving her. I would like to ask for Qiaoshe to give to Pan."

The sharp light in Suo Chanzhi's eyes softened, but she still curled her lip slightly. "You are quite the gallant, caring for the fairer sex."

It wasn't a big deal for Yang Can to ask for a maid to serve Steward Li's wife. However, he specifically asked for Qiaoshe, whom he had demoted to a messenger girl, which was clearly to rescue the girl from her suffering.

That was why Suo Chanzhi said that.

But he wasn't asking for the girl for himself, which made Suo Chanzhi feel somewhat better. Besides, there were plenty of maids and matrons serving in her own room, so she couldn't show her jealousy too obviously.

Therefore, she just gave a vague, sarcastic remark and said, "Fine, a little maid isn't worth me holding onto her. I'll give you this favor."

Yang Can smiled slightly. "Then I shall take my leave."

He looked around but didn't see Qingmei, so he said, "Please urge Qingmei to hurry, Young Mistress. I will wait for her in the outer residence."

Yang Can bowed deeply to Suo Chanzhi. "I take my leave."

Under the flower corridor, Qiaoshe, dressed in a blue gown with a plain cloth tied around her head, was struggling to carry a bucket of water.

This bucket was very large; usually, two maids would carry it with a pole in the inner residence.

Now, it was given to her alone. She took two steps and had to stop, her face flushed red, and her fingers marked with red lines from the strain, yet no one came to help.

The so-called messenger girl was essentially a charwoman; anyone in the inner residence could order her around.

"Qiaoshe!"

Qiaoshe was just massaging her aching hands when she heard the call. She looked up and her eyes lit up immediately. "Steward Yang!"

Yang Can waved his hand. "Put the bucket down and come with me. From today on, you don't belong to the inner residence anymore."

"Ah?"

Qiaoshe was both shocked and delighted, unable to react for a moment.

After saying this, Yang Can continued walking outward.

Qiaoshe stood dumbfounded for a moment, then happily threw the bucket to the ground and ran after him.

Yang Can wasn't walking fast, but he was tall with long legs, so Qiaoshe had to quicken her pace to keep up right behind him.

Qiaoshe hadn't expected that Steward Yang, who had promised to get her over, would actually fulfill it so early in the morning.

The Young Mistress had intended to make an example of her; how could she have agreed to Steward Yang so easily?

No wonder Steward Yang dared to challenge the Suo family; he was truly formidable.

In the morning, the manor was at its busiest.

Many maids and matrons were in the courtyard at this time.

They watched as Steward Yang walked leisurely in the lead.

Qiaoshe followed closely behind, occasionally taking two quick steps to catch up, her small chest puffed up high.

A bunch of snobs. Did you think I'd never have my day?

This girl has someone to protect her now, hmph!

The little girl looked around, her face beaming with spirit.

Steward Li and four guards were already waiting with horses outside the front gate.

Not long after, Qingmei arrived with eight more guards.

Today, Qingmei wore a narrow-sleeved short robe with a turned-down collar and front closure, a leather belt around her waist, and small boots on her feet. She looked clean and capable, her heroic bearing standing out.

However, although she had changed into men's clothing, her red lips, white teeth, and painted eyebrows made it clear she was a woman. Of course, she hadn't intended to disguise herself; wearing men's clothing was just for convenience on the trip.

When Qingmei saw Yang Can, she raised an eyebrow and curled the corner of her mouth into a "Nike" swoosh.

She seemed quite proud of this outfit.

"Everyone is here? Shall we set off then?"

As he spoke, Yang Can placed his hand on the saddle, vaulted into the air, and mounted the horse with great elegance.

He showed off a bit as well.

Outside the front gate, the stewards of the outer residence stood there, bowing with their hands clasped, just as they had when seeing off Head Steward Li.

Madam Pan also stood in the crowd, with the newly appointed personal maid, Qiaoshe, standing behind her.

Pan Xiaowan, in front of so many people, naturally wouldn't show a trace of reluctance. Disguise was to her like a chameleon's color-changing ability; it had become an instinct.

Qiaoshe stood behind Pan Xiaowan, but her gaze was filled with grievance.

She hadn't expected Steward Yang to give her to Madam Pan.

Heavens, did she spend last night building up the psychological resolve to serve Steward Yang well in the future?

In the end, all that preparation was for nothing.

Unbeknownst to her, Pan Xiaowan was even more resentful than she was.

*I wanted to give myself to you, but you wouldn't take it.*

*And now you're giving me a girl. Are you showing off that you're a gentleman who remains chaste even in temptation?*

*Why do I suddenly feel like I don't have such a big chance of winning him over anymore...*

The last time the world was unified, the ancestors of the Yu family were entrusted by the imperial command to guard the Hetao region.

When the empire, that colossal entity, collapsed, the Central Plains fell into a century-long period of chaos.

But the remote regions on all sides were lucky enough to escape this disaster.

However, in this process, the feudal governors, once freed from the control of the central empire, gradually evolved into various warlords.

The Yu faction was formed this way.

Therefore, although the Yu family was not the strongest among the Eight Factions of Longshang, it possessed the most arable land.

And the other factions would not sit by and watch someone occupy this land and grow strong enough to threaten them.

Thus, the Yu faction has survived to this day without having suffered a fatal blow.

Yu Huanhu这次交还长房的田庄共有六个，共计五万余亩土地。

This time, Yu Huanhu returned six manors to the main branch, totaling over fifty thousand mu of land.

Even so, it wouldn't be enough to break the second branch of Yu Huanhu, but it was still a vast tract of land.

Fifty thousand mu of land were divided into six manors, each managing nearly ten thousand mu of good farmland.

Attached to these lands were free citizens, private troops, tenant farmers, as well as artisans and merchants; each manor had no less than three to four thousand people.

The scale of such a so-called manor was equivalent to that of a large town or a small county.

Because villages at this time generally consisted of only forty or fifty households, around two hundred people.

Therefore, although Feng'an Manor was a manor, it would be most appropriate to call it Feng'an Town or Feng'an County.

And the manor lord of Feng'an Manor was actually equivalent to a "hundred-li lord" of a Central Plains dynasty, comparable to a county magistrate.

Even more so, because the population here had very little mobility, the manor lord's power was even greater than that of a county magistrate in the Central Plains.

Feng'an Manor was a fortified town named after its manor.

Surrounding it were five or six villages, guarding it in the center.

The entire manor was like a small city; the outer city was still rather simple, with the so-called city walls being just an earthen rampart.

But the center of the small city, that is, Manor Lord Zhang Yunyi's manor, had high, thick walls and even a "moat."

Once Zhang Yunyi went to Phoenix Mountain Manor, he was just a rustic country landlord in front of those stewards.

But here, he was the "King."

Zhang Yunyi controlled over ten thousand mu of good farmland, possessed a fortified castle, and had thousands of subjects under his command.

Within a hundred li radius, military defense, agricultural production, and administrative governance were all decided by his word alone.

He was the supreme heaven of Feng'an Manor!

The life and death, and the future of the people here, could all be decided by him with a single word.

But today, the people of Feng'an Manor discovered that the "Heavenly Lord" in their hearts was actually dressed in brand-new brocade robes, leading his many subordinates, waiting early at the east end of the manor.

Behind Zhang Yunyi were the many stewards of Feng'an Manor.

Accountants, manor heads, field supervisors, granary overseers, canal chiefs, artisan chiefs, millstone chiefs, private troop captains, tenant chiefs, household chiefs...

All aspects of administration, from taxes and census to rites, military, justice, and engineering, had their respective stewards here.

To call it a manor was truly like calling it a small county town.

These stewards were all dressed in brand-new clothes like Zhang Yunyi, standing at the east end of the village with beaming faces, as if they were about to welcome a new bride.

The common people were all wondering, who was coming?
