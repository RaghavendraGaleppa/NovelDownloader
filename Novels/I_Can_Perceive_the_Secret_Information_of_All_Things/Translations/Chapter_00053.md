# Chapter 53: Actually, This Is My First Time Treating Someone

After inviting the man into the main hall, Xiao Ji lit a brazier to warm Lin Musheng.

At first, they simply exchanged introductions and then fell into silence.

Lin Musheng was forcibly suppressing the poison in his body, pretending to be normal, afraid that the Taoist priest might kill him if his condition was discovered. As a fugitive, he was always more cautious than others and tended to prepare for the worst.

The flames in the brazier flickered to life. Xiao Ji channeled a wisp of spiritual energy from his palm, making the fire burn more vigorously before going to prepare tea.

Lin Musheng watched the Taoist priest's back. Though the man spoke little, his demeanor was composed and generous, his expression kind and amiable, making one unconsciously lower their guard. At least the priest didn’t pry or attempt to learn about his background.

Such a person must be someone who lived with detachment, devoted to quiet cultivation—someone without much cunning. It was reassuring.

[Lin Musheng, a fifth-level Qi Refining swordsman, descendant of the Lin Family Fort in Pangu County… currently poisoned…]

[The ruby on the scabbard of his magic sword was gifted by his third uncle when he was twelve. The gem is problematic, a trap set by his third uncle in advance. No matter where Lin Musheng flees, he will eventually be found…]

At twelve, Lin Musheng had received his first true magic sword. This third uncle from the Lin Family Fort had laid his plans long ago.

"Your poison is about to reach your heart. Aren’t you going to suppress it with spiritual energy?" Xiao Ji added another piece of wood to the brazier, clapping his hands to brush off the dust and wood shavings.

Lin Musheng: "..."

He was surprised. He didn’t know how the priest had discerned his poisoning, as he thought his current composed appearance was convincing enough.

Ignoring the midnight stranger’s expression, Xiao Ji continued, "The poison has already eroded your organs. Your meridians are blocked. If you don’t use spiritual energy to flush it out soon, you’ll die. My Yuanshen Temple won’t be responsible for burying you."

With the priest speaking so bluntly, pretending to be healthy was pointless. Lin Musheng immediately sat cross-legged and began gathering spiritual energy in his dantian.

At this moment, Xiao Ji calculated the time and then pointed to Lin Musheng’s sword. "Nice sword. May I take a look?"

Trusting someone meant trusting them completely. Moreover, the priest seemed extraordinary—he had detected his poisoning at a glance. If the priest wanted to kill him, there were many ways to do so. There was no need to invite him into the hall for warmth or say so much…

Without a word, Lin Musheng handed over the sword.

"Beautiful gem. A pity." Xiao Ji stroked the blade, then effortlessly pried the ruby from the scabbard.

In the next moment, he crushed it.

"You—" Lin Musheng, who had been about to channel his spiritual energy, was stunned to see the priest destroy the precious gem on his scabbard.

"My apologies for acting without your permission," Xiao Ji said, returning the sword. "That ruby contained a minor spell—a tracking charm. Whoever gave it to you must have been worried you’d get lost and marked your sword… Seems they care deeply about you."

The implication was clear. Only then did Lin Musheng recall this seemingly insignificant detail from many years ago, when his third uncle had gifted him the precious gem upon receiving his first magic sword. He hadn’t expected his uncle’s ulterior motives to run so deep, not even sparing such a small detail.

This priest was truly remarkable.

He had heard before that many cultivation masters didn’t necessarily reside in spiritual mountains—some hid among ordinary folk.

Lin Musheng let go of his guard completely and began flushing out the poison with his spiritual energy in front of the priest he had just met.

The spiritual energy surged repeatedly through his organs until he finally coughed up a mouthful of thick, black blood.

The blood landed in a basin—one Xiao Ji had prepared in advance, catching it at just the right moment.

"The poison is out. Your life is saved, but your meridians were overstrained by the spiritual energy and are severely damaged. Some are even misaligned. They need treatment, or your cultivation path ends here." Xiao Ji gazed at the flickering flames in the brazier, lost in thought.

Lin Musheng was well aware of his condition—his body was his own, after all. Yet it was only through the priest’s words that he realized the extent of his meridian damage. But what was the point now? Surviving was already a miracle. No one knew what he had endured after fleeing the Lin Family Fort.

"Still, it’s not too bad," Xiao Ji continued. "I can help you."

"I’m in your debt, Priest." Lin Musheng cupped his hands in gratitude.

Xiao Ji began manipulating the man’s meridians from a distance, sending threads of watery light into his body.

"This is the first time I’ve been injured this badly. To be honest, it hurts, and I’m a little nervous." Lin Musheng felt as though sharp daggers, not spiritual energy, were piercing his body. The pain was excruciating.

Seeing his unease, Xiao Ji reassured him, "Don’t worry. Actually, this is my first time treating someone."

Lin Musheng: "..."

After a while, his meridians were realigned, his energy channels much smoother, and spiritual energy slowly began regenerating in his dantian. Lin Musheng felt exhausted—and hungry. "Priest, do you have any food?"

This was the first time in his life he had ever uttered such words. The young master of the Lin Family Fort, who should have been its future lord, was now reduced to begging for a meal.

Xiao Ji brought him a bowl of plain yangchun noodles.

As Lin Musheng ate halfway through, Xiao Ji’s eyebrow twitched imperceptibly.

He had discovered an even more important secret.

[Lin Musheng carries in his robes a fragment of one of the Nine Treasures—a piece of the Four-Stringed Pipa, also known as the Coiling Dragon Head.]

Had a fragment of the Four-Stringed Pipa come to him of its own accord?

"The pace at which these fragments are appearing is too fast," Xiao Ji mused, finding it highly unusual—especially since one had now come to him directly. "Could it be that these ancient artifact fragments resonate with each other, drawn together by some unseen force?"

For now, that seemed the only explanation.

If true, then even if he never left Willow Town, the fragments would eventually find their way to him—though how many years that might take was uncertain.

It was best if they came. If not, he would seek them out.

Right now, a fragment was right before him, hidden on the body of this fifth-level Qi Refining swordsman. He could take it effortlessly.

But the man was just a fugitive noble.

This complicated things.

"If only this kid were an ingrate, playing out the farmer and the snake scenario," Xiao Ji lamented inwardly. "Then I’d have an excuse to kill him."

But Lin Musheng was a man who repaid kindness.

"Priest, this noodle is delicious," Lin Musheng said between mouthfuls, a smile appearing on his face. "It’s the best thing I’ve ever eaten."

It had been so long since he’d had a proper hot meal. Even the simplest noodles tasted like a delicacy.

It had also been a long time since he had smiled—or felt so at ease.

"Now that you’ve eaten your fill," Xiao Ji gritted his teeth and said, "let’s settle the bill."
