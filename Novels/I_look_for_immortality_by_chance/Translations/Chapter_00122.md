# Chapter 122: Reusing the Four Spirit Jade Pillars!

The vast expanse of the Nine Rivers Great Marsh stretched endlessly, its waters shimmering under the sun. Countless islands dotted the landscape like stars, enveloped in a mist of spiritual energy, forming the grand domain of the Azure Peak Dao Academy.

In the northern reaches of the marsh, where the waters churned with turbulent currents, a crimson island blazed with radiant light. 

Mists hovered around the island, lending it an air of mystique. Yet upon closer inspection, the so-called "radiance" was revealed to be countless tongues of flame. Fire surged from the rocky crevices of the island like a thousand fiery serpents, licking at every inch of the land.

The island was barren, save for a solitary cave at its center and a few fire-resistant "Flame Spirit Trees." The rest was nothing but desolation.

"Truly a scrap of land..." 

At that moment, a streak of light descended from the sky, landing on the island. A young man in flowing robes surveyed the scene and sighed at the sight of the "Blazing Fury" before him.

"Boom!"

As if sensing his disdain, flames erupted from the fissures, forming a roiling sea of fire that surged toward him.

The young man remained motionless, but the waters of the marsh responded, spiraling upward to form a towering curtain that suppressed the inferno.

Upon reaching Foundation Establishment, each foundation granted innate abilities akin to divine arts, serving as a cultivator's natural advantage. Gu Yuan's Cangming Foundation bestowed him with mastery over water, allowing him to summon Xuanming Heavy Water effortlessly. Even without employing any seals, his foundation alone enabled him to command the waters within a hundred-zhang radius—a truly wondrous ability.

"Whoosh!"

The waters cascaded from the sky like a gentle rain, dispelling the island's oppressive heat. Gu Yuan then walked the length of the island, inspecting every corner.

After a while, he shook his head and returned to the cave at the center.

The island was no more than a thousand zhang in size—tiny and rugged, its rocky cliffs permeated with fire-qi from years of erosion. Barren and lifeless, it was practically a dead land.

Yet, its spiritual veins were rich, denser than those of the Qian Yuan Cave. Moreover, the island's spiritual energy was concentrated solely for Gu Yuan's cultivation, unlike the Qian Yuan Cave, which had to sustain multiple disciples on Golden Yuan Island.

Most importantly, the entire island was enveloped in a formation. Without Gu Yuan's permission, no one could enter, making it far more secluded than Qian Yuan Cave—befitting a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"Stone Cliff Cave?"

At the entrance of the cave, three bold characters were inscribed—"Stone Cliff Cave"—though their origin remained unknown.

"After all, it's just a temporary dwelling..."

Gu Yuan disliked the name, but since this was only a temporary residence, he saw no need to change it.

"Hum!"

Golden light flickered as the stone door slid open, revealing the interior.

The walls were fiery red, illuminated by a radiant pearl embedded in the ceiling, casting daylight-like brilliance that left no shadow untouched. The cave was sparsely furnished—only a single green meditation mat lay at its center, surrounded by dense, mist-like spiritual energy.

Gu Yuan couldn't help but shake his head. 

Though he wasn't particular about his cultivation environment, the crude simplicity of this place still disappointed him. Clearly, it was designed solely for meditation, lacking even basic amenities like a kitchen or bathing area—let alone accommodations for dual cultivation.

Not even a jade bed was present.

But there was no point in dwelling on it. Cultivation was his priority. Once he reaped the rewards of the Scarlet Moon Great Marsh, luxuries like jade halls and silken robes would be within easy reach.

Seated cross-legged on the meditation mat, Gu Yuan began his first cultivation session since reaching Foundation Establishment.

Half a day later, he opened his eyes, deep in thought.

"At this rate, how long will it take to make any progress?"

Despite hours of meditation, he felt only a slight refreshment in spirit—his actual mana reserves had barely increased.

If a Qi Refinement cultivator's mana was a pond, then a Foundation Establishment cultivator's was a surging river. The spiritual energy absorbed through meditation was like a light drizzle, barely enough to sustain the river's needs.

"Foundation Establishment has extended my lifespan, strengthened my physique, and granted me agelessness and resilience to mortal weapons—but my innate talent hasn't improved much."

"Originally, I had a Five-Aperture Body, already slower than most. Now, with my triple-path Foundation Establishment, my mana has expanded, but the difficulty of cultivation has also increased. In effect, my progress has regressed to that of a Two- or Three-Aperture Body..."

Observing his stagnant mana, Gu Yuan couldn't help but laugh bitterly.

At this rate, he doubted he could even reach the peak of Foundation Establishment before his lifespan ran out.

"I thought reaching Foundation Establishment and gaining three hundred years of life would give me breathing room. But it seems the road ahead is still long and arduous."

---

"Fortunately, I still have other means..."

With a sigh, Gu Yuan retrieved the Stone Flask from his palm.

The flask shimmered faintly as it absorbed something—tiny wisps of mist coalescing within.

He had never forgotten his greatest asset.

Without the Stone Flask, he wouldn't be where he was today.

Thus, when faced with slow cultivation progress, his first thought was the Stone Liquid.

"Though the last three chances were wasted, it'll take time to accumulate more..."

Sighing again, he stored the flask away.

The Stone Liquid couldn't be stockpiled. Each time it condensed, it had to be used promptly—otherwise, it would dissipate and begin accumulating anew.

Previously, Gu Yuan had used it monthly, ensuring no opportunity was wasted. But for the past three months, he had focused solely on consolidating his foundation, not daring to divert his attention—even if it meant letting three chances go unused.

The next Stone Liquid would likely take another half-month to form.

And that time couldn't be wasted either.

With a flick of his wrist, Gu Yuan produced an exquisite jade pillar adorned with two intricate, luminous patterns that seemed almost alive.

The Four Spirit Jade Pillars!

His first major opportunity within the Dao Academy!

This treasure not only aided cultivators in breaking through the Spiritual Awareness barrier but also offered immense benefits to divine sense after Foundation Establishment—a rare and invaluable artifact.

Previously, without a foundation or his own spiritual island, Gu Yuan had refrained from using it.

But now, with his foundation complete and a second-tier spiritual island beneath his feet, it was time to deploy this treasure once more!
