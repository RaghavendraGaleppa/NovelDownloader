# Chapter Nine: The Beast Control Ring  

Despite Qin Chong's warning, Zhao Yin remained unresponsive.  

With a dull *thud*, the giant tree shook violently. Though Qin Chong had braced himself, the sudden movement still caught him off guard. Had he not gripped the branches tightly, he might have fallen.  

Zhao Yin, however, wasn’t so lucky—he plummeted downward. Qin Chong barely had time to react, let alone save him.  

What baffled Qin Chong even more was that the old man remained in a meditative posture as he fell. This was absurd—even while cultivating, a cultivator should always maintain some awareness of their surroundings.  

Below, the Scarletflame Tiger lifted its massive head, watching Zhao Yin’s descent with what almost seemed like amusement. It bared its fangs, ready to welcome its next meal.  

Seeing the man about to be devoured right beneath him, Qin Chong couldn’t stand idle. He leaped down, intending to attack the tiger while trying to save Zhao Yin.  

But then, the impossible happened.  

As Qin Chong descended a few zhang, Zhao Yin suddenly opened his eyes and flicked his wrist, summoning an object—a ring-shaped artifact. Under the infusion of his magic power, it rapidly expanded to half a zhang in size.  

Simultaneously, Zhao Yin halted his fall just a few zhang above the tiger’s maw, now standing atop a flying sword.  

Qin Chong’s attention was entirely on the ring. The aura it emitted was not only powerful but also distinct from ordinary magical artifacts. Instantly, he recognized it—  

A Beast Control Ring!  

So, the old man had been scheming to tame this Scarletflame Tiger all along.  

Truly, the older the fox, the wiser the trick.  

The sudden turn of events stunned the tiger. The aura of the Beast Control Ring filled it with an inexplicable dread, but it was too late.  

The ring clamped tightly around the tiger’s neck, fusing to its flesh. As Zhao Yin chanted an incantation, the beast collapsed to the ground, thrashing helplessly before finally going limp.  

With the situation completely reversed, Qin Chong saw no need to intervene further. He steadied himself on the branch where Zhao Yin had previously been.  

After a brief struggle, the Scarletflame Tiger lay motionless. With a wave of his hand, Zhao Yin stored the subdued beast inside a spirit beast pouch.  

Qin Chong couldn’t help but marvel inwardly. This Zhao Yin was no ordinary cultivator—spirit beast pouches were rare treasures, something most Qi Refining cultivators could only dream of possessing.  

---  

Generally, only disciples from beast-taming sects or prominent clans had the privilege of owning spirit beast pouches during the Qi Refining stage. For rogue cultivators or those from minor families, such items were practically unheard of.  

"You wretched beast, you’re finally tamed," Zhao Yin gloated, patting the pouch with satisfaction.  

Qin Chong descended from the tree and cupped his hands in congratulations. "Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Zhao. With such a powerful spirit beast, your strength has greatly increased."  

Zhao Yin sighed, his earlier smugness fading. "This beast cost me considerable effort. If not for your timely assistance, Fellow Daoist Qin, I might have failed at the last moment."  

"Oh? So I played a part in this?"  

"Naturally. To subdue a beast of similar cultivation using a Beast Control Ring, one must exhaust it while conserving enough magic power to activate the ring. Without that brief respite you provided, I wouldn’t have succeeded."  

"I see. I’ve learned something new today."  

Qin Chong had read about this in ancient texts but feigned ignorance out of politeness.  

"Fellow Daoist Qin, I owe you a great debt. I shall repay you handsomely in the future."  

Qin Chong frowned. This sounded like an empty promise—"in the future" might as well mean never.  

"Fellow Daoist Zhao, do you happen to have any spare Beast Control Rings?"  

The question caught Zhao Yin off guard.  

"Beast Control Rings are incredibly valuable. It took me years of saving to afford this one. Why do you ask?"  

"Watching you tame that Scarletflame Tiger filled me with envy, so I thought I’d inquire."  

"These rings are rare. Even with the funds, they’re hard to come by."  

"I see. Then, do you have any other treasures on you?"  

Zhao Yin’s expression darkened. "What are you implying? Do you intend to rob me? At the fifth layer of Qi Refining, you’re no match for me."  

"Of course not. But since our paths may not cross again, it’s best to settle any debts now."  

"Debts? What debts?"  

Zhao Yin knew exactly what Qin Chong meant but played dumb.  

"Fellow Daoist Zhao, you just promised to repay me. Have you forgotten so quickly?"  

---  

Damn this cunning brat!  

"Ah, my apologies—I was distracted. What kind of treasure did you have in mind?"  

"My demands are modest. Spirit stones, materials, cultivation techniques, magical artifacts, or pills—I’m not picky. It’s up to you."  

Qin Chong wasn’t taking unnecessary risks. With Zhao Yin’s magic power depleted, he still had bargaining power. In any other situation, he might have ended up the loser.  

Zhao Yin’s brow furrowed. If he didn’t offer something, this brat wouldn’t let it go. How dare he try to extort me?  

"Let me think… Most of my spirit herbs were handed over to the Canglong Valley. But I do have a concealment technique. Considering our fateful encounter, I’ll gift it to you as a token of friendship."  

He produced a jade slip and handed it to Qin Chong.  

Qin Chong accepted it without inspecting it immediately. "Many thanks, Fellow Daoist Zhao."  

Gift? The old miser. Qin Chong seethed inwardly but dared not voice his displeasure.  

"Then I’ll take my leave."  

"Wait, Fellow Daoist Zhao."  

Zhao Yin, already turning to leave, stiffened. His expression turned icy. "Fellow Daoist Qin, know your limits. Push too far, and you’ll regret it."  

"A misunderstanding! I merely wished to propose another transaction."  

"Transaction?"  

"Since we’ve met by chance, we likely have items the other might need. Why not trade? We might both benefit."  

Zhao Yin’s eyes gleamed briefly before turning dismissive.  

Hah! What could a mere fifth-layer Qi Refining cultivator possibly offer? Still, a trade wouldn’t hurt—if unsatisfied, he could always refuse.  

"Not a bad idea. Let’s give it a try."  

"Excellent. We’ll each present some materials and exchange those of equal value. Any discrepancies can be settled with spirit stones or additional items."  

"Agreed!"
