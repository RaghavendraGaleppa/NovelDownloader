# Chapter 94: Visitor from Beyond Heaven

"Master, you truly possess the potential of a deity! I'll go scout out the enemy for you!" Yuque chirped, full of vigor and excitement. In its view, the Outsiders had already been dealt with; a mere golden-armored guard was hardly worth mentioning!

In the night sky, the black-clad woman's mount panicked. Its master had been killed by the opponent in an incredibly short time, terrifying it into wanting to flee immediately. Qin Ming drew his bow like a full moon. An iron arrow shot from the string with a *thwack*, piercing through the raptor in the night mist, trailing a spray of blood, heavily wounding it.

"If you don't want to die, land immediately," Qin Ming commanded from the back of the Red Eagle, his robes fluttering in the wind, forcing the exotic bird to the ground.

"Master, the situation is a bit grim. That golden-armored guard's mount is actually a Bat-Bird," Yuque reported back, quickly relaying the information.

"Are Bat-Birds special?" Qin Ming asked.

"Bat-Birds have some of the keenest senses of smell in the mountains. They are rare and often used to track enemies," Yuque explained quickly. It asked anxiously, "Surely no one tampered with you, right? I observed that golden-armored guard; he was very composed, as if certain he could track you down."

Qin Ming sniffed himself; there was no unusual smell.

"Bat-Birds can detect all sorts of scents, far beyond what other creatures can smell," Yuque said, clearly wary of this peculiar species.

"So, I've been hit? Human hearts are truly unfathomable," Qin Ming frowned. He suspected someone had tampered with him when he encountered acquaintances back in Silver Vine Town. The culprit didn't necessarily have to be Zheng Maoze, as it could have been done without physical contact.

"Has he arrived?" Qin Ming asked.

"He landed at the edge of the desert and didn't immediately enter," Yuque informed him.

"He's keeping his distance from the black-clad woman, likely to avoid any misunderstanding." Qin Ming had long anticipated this; he knew the guard wasn't the woman's follower. Otherwise, how could a golden-armored guard slowly trail behind, watching an Outsider personally take action? He should have gone first.

"Since a Bat-Bird is tracking us, there's no escaping. We'll fight to the end. Quick, set up the trap!" Qin Ming had no intention of fleeing.

On the black-clad woman's body, besides a charred small shield and a chopstick-length black spear, there was some day-gold, but no other high-value items.

"Flap your wings and erase some of the battle traces here, quickly!" Qin Ming ordered the Red Eagle. He then looked at Yuque and said, "Grab the woman's shoe and follow behind me, leaving some footprints in the sand."

"Master, you're making things difficult for a bird," Yuque said, flapping its wings.

"You're a mutated creature, isn't this easy for you? You must be quick. Although he's keeping his distance from the black-clad woman, he won't wait much longer," Qin Ming urged.

Qin Ming carried the woman's corpse and dashed into the dark night mist. His killing of the black-clad woman hadn't triggered any dangerous or terrifying phenomena in the desert. He suspected it might align with certain rituals of the Esoteric Cult, effectively offering a tribute indirectly. According to rumors, if one had offered blood sacrifices to other deities, it was easy to run into trouble in the desert.

"Wait for me over there!" Qin Ming commanded the black-clad woman's wounded raptor not to move.

He took off his outer coat, buried it in the yellow sand, and disguised the scene. Qin Ming used a piece of the black-clad woman's sleeve to vigorously wipe his neck, hands, and other areas, wondering if it would remove any peculiar scent. Afterwards, he "scrubbed" himself with yellow sand.

"Why hasn't he come in yet?" He waited for a moment, but the golden-armored guard was slow to enter.

After slaying the black-clad woman, Qin Ming was brimming with fighting spirit. In the past, many had told him how powerful Outsiders were and that they should not be easily provoked, which indeed had put some pressure on him. Furthermore, the young man who could transform into mist last time had also made him wary. If his Mutton-fat Jade Iron Blade hadn't happened to counter the opponent's "mist body" at the time, he would truly have been in danger.

But today, the so-called distinction between immortals and mortals seemed exaggerated to him. After repeatedly merging with Heavenly Aura power, he could now harm such people. Of course, Qin Ming dared not underestimate the Beyond-Realm, as it was indeed terrifying. After all, practitioners could already wield the power of consciousness in their very first realm.

"'Heart Purity': discarding distracting thoughts, making one's mind empty, tranquil, and pure, thereby approaching the Dao, awakening the light of the soul, and giving birth to the power of consciousness. The concept is truly profound," Qin Ming couldn't help but sigh. This didn't mean Outsiders neglected their physical bodies. In their later cultivation, they would imbue their forms with extraordinary power, leaving no obvious weaknesses. Most terrifyingly, their path was very mature, allowing them to advance swiftly.

In contrast, the Newborn path only progressed quickly in its first realm, becoming difficult after reaching the Outer Saint domain. Heart Purity was aligned with Newborn. Normally, after repeatedly awakening the light of the soul in the Heart Purity realm, one could suppress most Heavenly Aura power. Sometimes, those who underwent multiple Newborn transformations would feel despair. Their Heavenly Aura power would clearly be immense, yet they couldn't affect Outsiders in the Heart Purity realm who had awakened their consciousness power multiple times. It was as if they were naturally countered. In the end, it was widely believed that Newborn couldn't contend with Heart Purity. This was practically becoming common knowledge!

"'Heaven-Propping Force' and 'Tathagata Force' should be able to shake experts from the Beyond-Realm, but these legendary Heavenly Aura powers are likely extremely difficult to cultivate and are not disseminated externally."

After his memory recovered, Qin Ming already knew many things. The so-called 'eating the mist and drinking the dew' didn't refer to consuming daily mists, but rare substances from top-tier fiery springs, nor drinking night vapors and dew, but the mysterious "Heavenly Essence" from the depths of the night sky. Those capable of 'eating the mist and drinking the dew' were already truly formidable figures in the Beyond-Realm. People like the black-clad woman, who were in the Heart Purity realm, still ate grains. The Newborn path was more widely spread, mainly because its barrier to entry was low. Ordinary people who wanted to advance could only rely on physical mutation.

Qin Ming stopped pondering the path of the Beyond-Realm and stood ready for battle.

"Master, I've sacrificed too much for you this time; you can't fail!" Yuque muttered to itself, its voice trembling.

"After all this time, has he still not dealt with him?" The golden-armored guard grew impatient and urged the Bat-Bird forward. It flapped its leathery wings, slowly entering the desert. On the yellow sand, there were messy footprints and a few lingering bloodstains, pointing into the depths of the night mist. The Bat-Bird possessed bat-like leathery wings, a bird's body, a tiger-leopard-like beast head, and a long, thick, pig-like snout, giving it exceptionally keen olfaction. It followed the scent, flying low, silently approaching its target.

"Hmm, could she have already succeeded, killing him and burying him underground?" The golden-armored guard frowned. This was because the Bat-Bird indicated to him that there was a strong scent of the target beneath the yellow sand ahead.

"After she killed her opponent, why would she bury him? Something's wrong!" The golden-armored man held his gleaming greatsword, his expression turning cold. The Bat-Bird signaled to him that there was still a strong scent ahead.

"Sigh, burying clothes under the yellow sand truly was useless," Qin Ming's voice drifted from the distant night mist.

"You are truly extraordinary, a Newborn against Heart Purity, yet you actually killed an Outsider." The man on the Bat-Bird, his golden armor resplendent, his eyes like lightning, spoke. He could vaguely see that in the mist-shrouded distance, the Red Eagle seemed heavily wounded, lying across the ground.

"She's not dead; she's already escaped." From behind the several-meter-long Red Eagle came Qin Ming's heavy breathing, as if he were badly wounded.

"You don't need to hide it; she's definitely dead!" the golden-armored guard said coldly, as the Bat-Bird carried him slowly forward.

Just then, he suddenly felt something was wrong, as if an immense danger was descending. Heavenly Aura rapidly erupted throughout his body, gushing out from his surface. "Ah..." he roared, finally realizing where the danger came from. It wasn't the front, which he had been focused on, but from the night sky! A meteorite was falling! Who could withstand this? The rapidly approaching heavy object made his hair stand on end! The sudden change left him little time to dodge. Who could possibly anticipate such an unexpected situation?

It must be said that his instinctive intuition was incredibly strong. Any other person would surely have been crushed into a pulp by the falling meteorite, but he managed to avoid the vital points at the critical moment. With a *thud*, his Heavenly Aura was pierced, one arm became a bloody mess, and his greatsword fell to the ground. At the same time, his Bat-Bird was smashed through by the falling meteorite. It didn't possess such a strong physique and was killed instantly, plummeting from low altitude into the desert.

The golden-armored guard clearly saw the meteorite: it was hammer-shaped! More precisely, it was a giant hammer, hurled down from high in the sky. He was furious, completely enraged. He had actually been plotted against.

"You silly bird, run! I told you to play dead, not actually die!" Yuque's loud cry came from ahead. It flapped its wings quickly and fled immediately. A short while ago, Qin Ming had instructed it to imitate his voice to deceive the golden-armored guard. The Red Eagle also shook its body and shot up into the night sky with a *whoosh*.

Under the night sky, Qin Ming stood on the back of the black-clad woman's raptor, which he had heavily wounded earlier, his eyes shining like stars. His archery was truly exceptional, not just empty talk, which also led to his profound skill in throwing. A short while ago, when he swung the great hammer down, he himself had a feeling he could hit the target.

The golden-armored guard was beyond furious. The battle hadn't even truly begun, and one of his arms was already crippled, smashed to a pulp. The intense pain coupled with the feeling of humiliation made his rage soar, his Heavenly Aura surged, and his entire body glowed blindingly.

Qin Ming ordered the black raptor to descend slightly and shot arrow after arrow downwards! His pupils contracted, as the iron arrows were blocked by the opponent's Heavenly Aura and did not pierce his body. This was an expert whose Heavenly Aura could be initially projected outwards. The dazzling light could extend about half a *chi* (approx. 15-20cm) from his body, blocking the iron arrows, even tearing off some fletchings.

Qin Ming was startled. To deal with him, they had actually dispatched an expert who had initially stepped into the Outer Saint realm! However, it was no big deal. He had taken down the opponent's flying mount, and the initiative was now in his hands. Qin Ming continued to draw his bow and shoot arrows, aiming to exhaust the opponent's powerful Heavenly Aura. Perhaps he could even take down an Outer Saint in the end!

The golden-armored guard had never felt so humiliated and frustrated. This kind of battle was too agonizing. A meteorite inexplicably fell from the sky, heavily injuring him, and now he was being treated as a living target!

Qin Ming quickly expended the contents of four quivers, with only one quiver remaining, but now he suddenly began to shake violently. "Land quickly!"

His original strategy for dealing with the situation was perfect, but now an unexpected problem had arisen. Man proposes, God disposes. This black raptor had been shot through by him, sustaining significant injuries, and when he threw the great hammer, the immense force and his feet planted on its body had nearly "sent it off" (killed it). Now, it struggled to fly in the air, wobbling erratically as it descended towards the ground.

"Red Eagle!" Qin Ming shouted. However, the Red Eagle and Yuque had run as far as they could earlier; distant water couldn't quench immediate thirst.

"Haha..." The golden-armored man, feeling utterly humiliated and frustrated, laughed loudly. He picked up his greatsword from the ground with his left hand, and after pinpointing the area where the raptor was about to fall, he strode over.

"Is this... not enough to just throw the great hammer, so he's throwing himself down too?" Yuque was dumbfounded as it approached. The Red Eagle also arrived, but it was too late.

Qin Ming's earlier composure and faint smile vanished. He wouldn't necessarily fall to his death; although the black raptor beneath his feet was descending, it wasn't a direct plummet but a glide. However, the greater danger was that he was about to face an Outer Saint head-on!
