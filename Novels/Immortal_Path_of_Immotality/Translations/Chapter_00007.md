# Chapter 7: Departure  

In the blink of an eye, mid-July arrived, and the coming-of-age ceremony for the younger generation of the Lin family commenced.  

The square was packed to the brim, every corner occupied by crowds. The entire Lin family—both the main and branch lineages, inner and outer courtyards—numbered nearly a thousand people.  

Amidst the clamor, over a hundred young men and women stood in orderly rows at the center of the square. These were the youths of the Lin family, both from the inner and outer courtyards, who had just turned sixteen.  

The first row had only one person—Lin Fan!  

After being accepted into the main lineage, Lin Fan had caused quite a stir in the inner courtyard due to his unrivaled strength. Those who had initially refused to acknowledge him had all been beaten into submission. Now, he stood alone at the forefront, drawing the attention of the entire crowd.  

The second row consisted of a dozen or so youths who had reached the Huanqi Stage of the Postnatal Realm. Lin Shan was among them.  

His cultivation as a Postnatal martial artist was no longer a secret, and there was no need to hide it. Being too weak would invite bullying, so displaying some potential was not a bad thing.  

The remaining rows were filled with disciples who had yet to become Postnatal martial artists.  

The sky was clear, the air crisp, and the wind gentle. On the high platform, the clan elders spoke in measured tones, their speeches impassioned and stirring.  

Amidst their fervent oratory, they first reminisced about the ancestors before looking toward the future. The elders' profound internal energy amplified their voices, making their speeches thunderous. The high-ranking members on the surrounding platforms nodded frequently, smiling in approval.  

The invited guests praised the Lin family one after another, remarking on how the older generation's prestige remained undiminished while the younger generation continued to produce outstanding talents.  

The scene was one of harmonious celebration.  

The young protagonists of the ceremony below the stage all appeared enthusiastic on the surface, but each harbored their own thoughts.  

The main lineage disciples had nothing to worry about. After the ceremony, their lives would continue as usual, unchanged from before.  

The branch lineage disciples, however, were anxious about their futures. Leaving the Lin family estate meant they would no longer receive their monthly allowances or medicinal pills. For those like Lin Shan, who had reached the Postnatal Realm, the Gathering Qi Pills were still useful but no longer essential.  

For those who had yet to become martial artists, without substantial financial support for their cultivation, they would miss their prime years. Even if they eventually reached the Postnatal Realm, they would likely remain stuck at the Huanqi Stage for life.  

Still, the Lin family was a major clan in Qinghe County, and in this world, one advantage was that jobs were "assigned." At the very least, after leaving, they could work in various Lin family businesses and avoid starvation—a fate far better than that of most commoners.  

Those with connections in the family would naturally secure better positions. Those like Lin Shan, who had no relatives to rely on, could only resign themselves to fate.  

...  

The ceremony didn't conclude until dusk. Watching the elders on the platform wipe their mouths, still unsatisfied after their lengthy speeches, Lin Shan couldn't help but marvel at their endurance and vocal prowess.  

Afterward, the outer courtyard disciples filed into the External Affairs Hall, lining up to receive their post-ceremony assignments.  

---  

The External Affairs Hall was packed with nearly a hundred people. Lin Shan noticed that the person in charge was none other than the very same Steward Lin who had been responsible for investigating the incident involving *Spring River Ducks Painting* that night.  

Behind Steward Lin stood a group of clerks—some reading from ledgers, others registering names, and a few even massaging his shoulders.  

"Lin Shu, accountant at the Lin Family Restaurant in the southern district."  

"Lin Shu, weaver at the Lin Family Textile Workshop in the northern district."  

"Lin Fei, butcher at the Lin Family Butcher Shop in the eastern district."  

...  

Steward Lin assigned roles one by one to the young men stepping forward, determining the course of their lives after leaving the estate.  

When it was the turn of the chubby youth in front of Lin Shan, he discreetly slipped a small pouch into Steward Lin's hand. A fleeting smile crossed the steward's face.  

"Lin Yan, patrol guard at the brothel in the western district!"  

The chubby youth thanked him and left, overjoyed, while gasps of astonishment rose around him.  

"A patrol guard at a brothel? Wouldn't he be surrounded by temptation every day?"  

"He could listen to music for free too!"  

"Who knows, he might even get some free favors!"  

"If he spends enough time with one of the girls, they might even elope!"  

...  

At sixteen, these youths were at the age of wild fantasies, and many were practically drooling with envy.  

Lin Shan curled his lip. As a transmigrator who had lived two lives, he had seen it all. As the saying went, "With no women in your heart, your swordplay ascends to divinity."  

Women would only slow down his cultivation!  

Stepping forward, Lin Shan also discreetly slipped a small pouch of silver into Steward Lin's hand. The steward tucked it into his sleeve, weighed it, and frowned.  

Lin Shan's heart sank. *Did I give too little? That was twenty taels of silver—almost my entire savings from the past ten years.*  

Seated in his rocking chair, Steward Lin frowned slightly as he calculated in his mind.  

*This kid has no background—his parents and relatives are all dead. These twenty taels are probably everything he has, but it's still far too little!*  

*Still, he's reached the Huanqi Stage at such a young age. He might even have a chance to reach the Lianzang Stage in the future. After gaining experience outside, he could very well return and secure a steward position. No point in offending him.*  

Having worked in the outer courtyard for so many years, Steward Lin had a sharp and far-sighted eye. He knew whom he could push around and whom he shouldn't provoke.  

He had once assumed Lin Fan had no backing and tried to skim some silver from him. But after learning Lin Fan had been adopted by an elder, Steward Lin had knelt before him the very next day, slapping his own face in apology. The sheer audacity of the act had left Lin Fan speechless.  

This time, Steward Lin didn't deliberate for long. Scanning the ledger, he picked one of the remaining lucrative positions.  

"Lin Shan, escort for the Lin Family Escort Agency in the southern district!"  

Ignoring the astonished gazes around him, Lin Shan bowed respectfully, relieved.  

"Thank you, Steward."  

He then collected his assignment token and strode out of the External Affairs Hall. Behind him, Steward Lin's voice continued unhurriedly.  

"Lin Miao, apprentice at the northern district pharmacy."  

"Lin Yu, guard at the fishpond outside the city."  

...  

The escort job was a mixed bag, depending on the person.  

Encountering bandits and ruffians during escort missions was commonplace. A little bloodshed was to be expected, and the occasional death was hardly surprising.  

For those who preferred to laze around and avoid danger, it was hardly an ideal position.  

But for young men with strength, eager to earn money and gain experience, it was an excellent opportunity.  

Moreover, Steward Lin had been unusually generous this time, directly assigning him the title of "escort."  

Most people started as laborers or caravan hands in the agency, only being promoted to full-fledged escorts after successfully completing several missions and earning recognition in the field.  

Lin Shan was quite satisfied. His twenty taels hadn't gone to waste—this was far better than being assigned to some mundane job, stuck in the city for the rest of his life.  

Only by traveling far and wide, broadening his horizons, could he grow and perhaps stumble upon traces of ancient essence elsewhere.  

Lin Shan had considered simply leaving the Lin family to wander the martial world, but the problem was his lack of funds. He couldn't very well beg his way across the land.  

Moreover, as a transmigrator, he had never engaged in life-or-death combat in this world. The thought of venturing out alone made him uneasy. What if he was immediately cut down by some bandit king outside the city? That would be game over!  

The escort agency was the perfect stepping stone—a chance to learn the ropes under experienced mentors.  

Without delay, he gathered his bedding and belongings, left the Lin estate, and headed for the Lin Family Escort Agency in the southern district.  

After completing the formalities, he moved in that very night. Thanks to his escort status, he was allotted a small courtyard—a significant upgrade from his previous living conditions in the Lin family.
