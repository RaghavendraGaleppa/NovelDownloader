# Chapter 242: Hitting the Jackpot with the Real Deal (1/2)

Participating in the poetry gathering required a one-tael silver entry fee. Once the money was paid, a servant would bring ink and brush. After the guest finished writing, the poem would be sent upstairs to the Zhuangyuan Tower for scholars to evaluate.

If a poem was selected, it would be posted for display.

The Zhuangyuan Tower’s standards were notoriously high. Although many people participated, only three or four poems would ultimately be displayed.

Since it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, the topic was obvious without needing to guess:

‘The Moon.’

“Bring me the brush!”

Wu Chushu puffed his chest out, almost popping his buttons. With an air of grandeur, he confidently pulled out his silver.

He had prepared thoroughly for today!

Xiao Wu considered himself quite talented, even though he hadn't written anything new recently.

But his Master, Elder Zeng, was a man of culture!

One only needed to see how Elder Zeng never let go of his books to know that.

This poem was something he had plagiarized from his Master. When the Master wrote it, the scholars had showered it with praise, exclaiming that such a poem could only be heard in the heavens and was rarely found in the mortal world!

This was Xiao Wu's confidence!

“Do you have wine?”

“Sir, you only paid one tael. The wine at our Zhuangyuan Tower starts at three taels a pot...”

“I’ll pay extra!”

So, Wu Chushu gulped down the wine. Once his face was flushed red, and after ‘brewing’ his inspiration for a while, he finally let his brush dance like a flying dragon.

Looking at his wild and uninhibited demeanor, one would think this was the work of a poetry immortal.

“I heard Elder Zeng has a reputation for literary talent and is even called the Poetry Madman.”

“Luckily, there is more than one prize. Otherwise, I’m afraid I might not have been able to get one.”

Li Mo stepped forward and took the brush handed over by the servant, smiling shyly.

After all, this was plagiarism.

Since he stole the poem, he didn't dare make a big fuss. He would be secretly happy enough just to win a prize using the talent of the ancients.

“Every profession has its specialists. Young Hero Li cannot be an expert in everything.”

Wu Chushu had enjoyed his moment as a wild poet, and a smile returned to his face.

Bai Jinghong and Cao Mu exchanged a glance, seeing the silence in each other's eyes.

Xiao Wu actually seemed to believe that Elder Zeng had genuine literary talent...

Had he forgotten that he killed six bandits and was hyped up as having wiped out the entire stronghold?

At this moment.

Li Mo also put down his brush and returned to his spot.

“What did you write?”

Ying Bing saw the servant carrying two sheets of paper into the Zhuangyuan Tower and couldn't help but be curious.

He often spouted strange terms and catchy rhymes, but she had never seen him display any literary talent.

“Don't worry, bringing back a prize is no problem.”

Li Mo winked.

Ying Bing vaguely remembered.

When they were young, Uncle Li had hired a tutor for Li Mo.

The tutor only lasted three days before returning Li Mo, saying he couldn't teach this kid.

The private school teacher had left with a black eye painted with ink and a face covered in tally marks...

“.......I’ve used this red string for a long time; I’m quite used to it.”

......

Inside the Zhuangyuan Tower.

Famous scholars and literati of the city had gathered here, circulating the poems sent from below, evaluating and discussing them.

Sitting in the seat of honor was actually Elder Zeng.

It had to be said, Elder Zeng had an excellent appearance. Dressed in a scholar's robe and sitting there, he truly possessed the imposing presence of a master.

He was reading a book wrapped in a blue cover. Strangely, the book seemed quite large.

“Brother Zeng, what do you think of this one?”

“Passable.”

“And this one?”

“Fits the theme.”

Elder Zeng put the book away, tucking it into his chest, his expression indifferent.

Suddenly, someone exclaimed:

“How could there be a poem of this level?”

“Has a masterpiece appeared?”

“Tsk, if Teacher Song looks like that, it must be a work of profound talent.”

The crowd gathered around.

However, after Teacher Song’s surprise, he looked displeased:

“This poem is incoherent. It has no regard for tonal patterns or parallelism, and the imagery is completely off.”

“Sending up something of this level is just wasting silver!”

“Hiss...”

The crowd looked at the poem, their expressions quite interesting.

“Hmm?” Elder Zeng walked over, and suddenly the skin on his face twitched, and black lines appeared on his forehead.

Wasn't this his ‘masterpiece’!

Just then, someone asked him:

---

“Brother Zeng, what’s your take on this?”

“As a neutral party, to be honest... at least the courage is commendable, and the yearning for poetry is worth affirming...” Elder Zeng clenched his fist inside his sleeve.

The scholars looked at each other.

With Elder Zeng's aggressive nature, he shouldn't be giving such a mild evaluation...

Suddenly, they noticed the signature in the corner:

“Wu Chushu.”

So that’s how it was.

“Hahaha, if the poem isn't stinking, then it's actually quite good.”

“Courage is commendable, courage is commendable!”

“I think although it isn't enough to be displayed publicly, a prize should still be given to encourage him slightly.”

Looking at Elder Zeng's Sword City Elder token, the scholars suddenly stopped looking down on each other.

“We should first look for a poem worthy of representing the literary spirit of the Zhuangyuan Tower.”

“If we really can't find one, we’ll have to pool our collective wisdom.”

Elder Zeng smiled kindly while recalling the sect rules, thinking about how to punish Wu Chushu.

Forget it, no need for excuses. Just punish him for entering the door with his left foot first.

Suddenly.

Another exclamation came from the side.

“Wait! This one!”

Teacher Song’s face showed surprise again, his expression incredibly complex.

“What is it?”

“Let Brother Zeng see.”

The scholar next to him was startled. When he leaned over to look, his expression froze instantly.

Elder Zeng frowned, thinking they had no scholarly decorum.

But the moment he took the paper, his expression turned to stone.

After seeing the signature in the corner, his body began to tremble slightly.

He rushed to the side of the building, looking down.

“Hehe... It really is them...”

“Good, hitting the jackpot with the real deal, hehehe...”

Elder Zeng giggled foolishly.

The others thought Brother Zeng was truly a man of passion, becoming so intoxicated upon seeing a good poem.

“Quick, get this mounted for display!”

“I’ll write it myself! Find a large piece of paper... forget it, just use the cloud brocade!”

Although Elder Zeng lacked poetic talent, his calligraphy was excellent.

......

In front of the Zhuangyuan Tower.

The servant brought a green jade hairpin and handed it to Wu Chushu.

Wu Chushu raised his chin and casually handed the hairpin to Miss She beside him.

“Big Brother Wu is the best.” Miss She sounded like she had a cold, her voice nasal.

In front of everyone, Miss She gave Wu Chushu a kiss on the cheek, smacking it.

“Haha.”

Wu Chushu was so pleased he almost lost his cool, scholarly demeanor. His mouth was harder to suppress than an AK-47.

It was unknown if he would still be able to smile after returning to Sword City.

Ying Bing’s eyes moved slightly.

She saw the pig run away, and her peripheral vision inevitably fell on Li Mo’s face.

“This shouldn't be.”

Li Mo rubbed his chin.

Could the aesthetics of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands be different from his previous life?

At this moment, the servant who had left earlier returned, carrying an exquisite rosewood box.

“Sir, your prize.”

“It’s different from Wu Chushu’s...”

Li Mo opened it and found a lotus-shaped hairpin inside. However, the material was translucent, clear jade, which was obviously much more valuable.

“Congratulations, sir! You’ve won the top prize!”

*Whoosh—*

High-quality cloud brocade rolled down from the Zhuangyuan Tower like a wave, displaying a beautiful piece of calligraphy.

*“Before the bright moon tower, the bright moon night, still the moonlight like silver.*

*Bright, bright moon is my past life. Turning back, I smile, cold for a thousand springs.*

*Shining through the great thousand, clear as water, it has also shone through fine dust.*

*Do not exchange the round appearance for a frown. In the human world, the third and fifth nights, the person in the mirror is missed.”*

The girl’s voice recited it in a daze.

Her beautiful eyelashes trembled slightly. Her gaze, after reminiscing, became complex, and then cleared up like the moon emerging from behind layers of clouds.

......

PS: The poem is "Linjiang Xian," written by Chen Zengshou in the late Qing and modern era.

Everyone don't worry about Bing Duozi and Xiao Li being separated for too long. As is well known, there are many demons in the Southern Frontier, and Xiao Li has accepted the inheritance of the Seventy-Two Transformations...

Please support me with power stones, this is very important for a little author, mwah!
