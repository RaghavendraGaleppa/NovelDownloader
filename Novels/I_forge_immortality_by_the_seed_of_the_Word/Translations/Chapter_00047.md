# Chapter 47: Behind the Demons

Senior Brother Ding led the others in dismantling the materials from the demon tiger's body.

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing, standing to the side, seemed to recall something. His hand suddenly held a damp storage pouch—the very one he had just retrieved from the demon tiger's mouth.

His spiritual sense easily penetrated the pouch.

A gray, misty space appeared in Zhang Jing's perception. At its center sat a blood-red millstone. The moment his spiritual sense touched it, an overwhelming stench of blood surged into his mind, accompanied by the agonized wails of countless souls.

Zhang Jing's expression changed instantly. He swiftly withdrew his spiritual sense, and all the strange sensations gradually faded.

What in the world was that?!

He glanced around to ensure no one had noticed his reaction, then cautiously sent his spiritual sense back into the storage pouch. This time, he deliberately avoided the red millstone, exploring the surrounding area instead.

Aside from the eerie millstone, the pouch contained only four other items: two jade slips and two small white jade bottles.

The jade slips recorded two cultivation methods. One was the familiar but treacherous [Green Sparrow Qi Absorption Technique], while the other was the [Lord of Yin Mountain's Disaster-Warding Soldier Command Technique].

"Lord of Yin Mountain's Disaster-Warding Soldier Command Technique... Could this be related to those ghostly minions?" Zhang Jing mused silently.

At first, upon discovering this technique, he had considered learning it. With the help of his jade talisman's skill panel, he might have been able to command ghost soldiers just like the black tiger demon—though in his hands, they would be called Dao soldiers instead.

But the moment he spotted the [Green Sparrow Qi Absorption Technique] alongside it, he immediately abandoned the idea. The presence of these two techniques together made him suspect that the [Lord of Yin Mountain's Disaster-Warding Soldier Command Technique] was also a trap—and not just any ordinary trap at that.

As for the two jade bottles:

One contained a crimson liquid reeking of blood. Just a single glance at it made Zhang Jing feel his own blood qi begin to boil uncontrollably.

The other held an unknown transparent liquid that seemed capable of significantly enhancing one's spiritual sense and mental power.

After completing his inspection, Zhang Jing withdrew his spiritual sense from the pouch, a thoughtful frown creasing his brow.

He couldn't help but recall Senior Brother Liu's earlier warning.

It seemed that practitioners of these techniques could rapidly advance their cultivation as long as they had sufficient resources. However, once they reached the tenth level of Qi Refining, their essence, qi, and spirit would condense into a White Bone Trinity Elixir, ripe for harvesting.

Bizarre cultivation methods paired with resources...

Wait a minute—this sounds like farming!

The realization struck Zhang Jing like lightning.

He glanced at the corpse on the ground. Through this tiger demon, he seemed to glimpse an invisible hand looming over the entire Langya Prefecture.

A shiver of horror ran through him.

Zhang Jing forced himself to stop dwelling on it. If his suspicions were correct, this tiger demon couldn't possibly be the only one, and the Dao Academy must have already noticed something.

If the sky fell, the senior brothers from the inner academy, the pavilion masters, and the academy heads would be there to handle it. He, Zhang Jing, was merely a minor Qi Refining cultivator in the early stages. At most, he could report this matter after reaching Langya Prefecture.

As for the mysterious liquids in those jade bottles—he wouldn't dare use them now, no matter what. Who knew what might be lurking inside?

Time passed slowly.

By the time Zhang Jing and his four companions emerged from the underground palace, daylight had broken. Yet the county town of Yinshan had transformed completely. The lively scenes from the previous day now seemed like an illusion, replaced by boundless desolation and a sky-piercing aura of resentment.

Above them, dried human skins fluttered in the wind like butterflies, their expressions twisted in agony. Zhang Jing's sharp eyes noticed two particularly fresh-looking skins—still stained with blood—that resembled the county magistrate and his advisor from yesterday.

Sensing the heavy atmosphere among the group, Senior Brother Ding sighed solemnly:

"This is the true nature of demons—ruthless and vicious. Never let your guard down."

"Let's move on."

"Yes, Senior Brother."

Just then, Senior Sister Tong approached Zhang Jing, her face slightly flushed with embarrassment.

"Um, Junior Brother... do you still have any spare talismans? I accidentally used two in the underground palace and don't have any defensive ones left. If you have extras... could you sell me a couple?"

"Senior Sister, you should have said so earlier!" Zhang Jing replied with a smile, producing two Star-Guiding Talismans. "Here you go—I'll give them to you at cost price."

"No, I'll pay the market rate. I'll transfer the Dao merits to you after the mission," Senior Sister Tong insisted stubbornly.

After some back-and-forth, she finally agreed to purchase the two premium-quality Star-Guiding Talismans from him at 80% of the market price. Zhang Jing made a small profit, while she obtained two high-quality talismans at a discount—a win-win situation.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, could I buy some talismans from you too?" Senior Brother Xia chimed in.

"I'd like some as well," Senior Brother Zhou added.

"Haha, if Junior Brother Zhang has enough to spare, I wouldn't mind purchasing some too," Senior Brother Ding's voice joined in.

"Of course, plenty to go around," Zhang Jing replied cheerfully.

After all, if there was one thing he had in abundance, it was talismans. Even selling them at an 80% discount still netted him over five times the profit!

Three days later, before a pair of battered city gates:

"Junior Brother Zhang, this is your first mission dealing with demons. How come you remained so composed throughout?" Senior Brother Ding asked curiously during a casual conversation.

Behind him, Senior Sister Tong perked up her ears, equally interested in the answer.

"Senior Brother, perhaps it's because I came thoroughly prepared, so I wasn't particularly afraid of these demons," Zhang Jing answered with a smile.

Hearing this, both Senior Brother Ding and Senior Sister Tong's expressions froze simultaneously.

Thoroughly prepared, indeed!

They couldn't help but recall the stacks upon stacks of talismans packed into their junior brother's storage space, an overwhelming wave of envy rising uncontrollably in their hearts.

Here they were, fellow disciples of the same Dao Academy, yet the difference between him and them was staggering.

"Ah..." The two sighed in unison.

At that moment, Senior Brothers Zhou and Xia emerged quietly from a corner of the city, approaching the group with light steps.

They first glanced at Senior Brother Ding, then turned their attention to Zhang Jing.

"Senior Brother Ding, Junior Brother Zhang—we've figured out the situation inside," they announced.

"Oh? Please elaborate," Senior Brother Ding said eagerly, his face lighting up.

"Here's what we found," they began.

"It seems a group of demons infiltrated the city some time ago. First, they burned down the granaries and major grain stores. Then, they secretly colluded with local noble families, using them to exchange human flesh for grain among the populace. The common folk have been reduced to husbands selling wives, wives selling children, neighbors selling neighbors—it's utterly horrific."

"These demons operated with extreme secrecy, but we've located their hideout. Their leader appears to be a pig demon at roughly the mid-stage of Qi Refining."

"Those vile creatures!" Senior Brother Ding spat angrily. "Now that we've found them, let's exterminate them immediately."

Then, as if remembering something, he turned to Zhang Jing and asked, "Junior Brother, do you have any other suggestions?"

"I agree with Senior Brother's plan."

"Good. Let's move out."

With that, five figures sprang into action, heading straight for the city gates. Senior Brother Ding took the lead, with Zhang Jing following closely behind, while the other three naturally fell into step behind them.
