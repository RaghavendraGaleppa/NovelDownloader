Chapter 75: A Leisurely Half-Day, the Immortal in the Jar Remains

The eleventh month had already passed half.

Today, the weather had warmed, and it was the day to collect one's monthly stipend.

A long queue stretched in front of the accounting office. Li Xian had been invited by his roommates—Bao Yongkang, Jia Jie, and Kong Sun—to join them.

The three naturally had the intention of "draping themselves in a tiger's skin." Being able to speak to a Grade B Guardian was an extremely glorious thing. For martial artists to compete in strength and ferocity was the norm. Bullying the weak with one's strength was even more common.

The law of the jungle dictates that the weak naturally gravitate toward the strong. This is the way of survival and is not shameful.

Li Xian understood the three men's thoughts and didn't mind giving them a casual helping hand.

An hour later, they reached the front of the line, crossed the threshold, and entered the accounting office.

"Grade B Guardian, Li Xian."

"Your total monthly stipend is six hundred and twenty copper coins, plus one Tiger Red Pill."

Accountant Xiang, the uncle who managed the accounts, glanced up. He recognized Li Xian and had a deep impression of him. Before Li Xian could even speak, he had already handed over a cloth bag containing the coins and the pill.

"Thank you, Uncle Xiang." Li Xian weighed the bag. Having more money coming in made an extremely extremely.

"Master Li, please go ahead."

His fellow Grade C Guardians fawned over him as always.

"Today we patrol the Eastern Village. Follow me."

"Keep your eyes peeled."

Li Xian led the way along the eastern path, patrolling the winding mountain roads. When hungry, he ate flatbread and drank water. If that wasn't enough, he ate some more dried bear meat.

Today, the winds were calm.

The road was not difficult to walk.

"Master Li, could you give me a piece of your dried meat to try?"

One guardian had eaten his flatbread but was still terribly hungry. Seeing Li Xian casually chewing on dried meat, he finally couldn't hold back and gathered his courage to ask.

"Here." Li Xian opened his meat pouch.

The meat of bears, tigers, and deer had all been cut into strips and cured into jerky. Over this period, he had eaten most of it. Only ten strips of tiger jerky and three strips of bear jerky remained. As for the deer meat, it had been gone long ago.

Eating "deer meat" provided the least increase to his [Consumption] proficiency. But deer meat had the best taste, with a milky fragrance that, combined with the smoky flavor, made it a fine snack. In contrast, tiger meat was extremely tough and chewy, making it hard on the jaw, while bear meat had a foul, fishy smell and was far from delicious. He still had many of these two types of jerky left.

"Deliciousness and nutritional effect cannot coexist."

Li Xian was truly tired of the taste, so he simply distributed the excess jerky to the other guardians. The patrolling guardians, who were used to enduring hunger, treated it as a treasure and chewed it with relish.

"Master Li is so generous!"

"Master Li is mighty!"

The crowd praised him endlessly.

"Finish eating and continue the patrol. Let's get there and back early."

Li Xian gave the order.

They arrived at the "Eastern Village," an area where the Mistress owned over a thousand mu of farmland. But here, there were also fields belonging to the county's influential families, like the Lin and Huang families, which were adjacent to the Mistress's land.

The guardians' patrol was mainly to check if the Lin and Huang families were secretly encroaching on the land.

"G-great master..."

While patrolling the fields, they suddenly saw an old man trembling as he approached them.

"Hey, who are you calling 'great master'? You should call him 'great-great-grand...'" A Grade C guardian was about to scold him.

Li Xian raised his hand slightly, and the guardian immediately fell silent, quietly taking a step back.

"Old man, if you have something to say, go ahead," Li Xian asked.

"Ah! Great-great-grandmaster." The old man was flattered. His knees went weak, and he was about to kneel and kowtow.

Li Xian raised his palm slightly, and the scabbard of his knife met the old man's knees. His internal energy flowed, holding the old man up. The old man tried to kneel but couldn't.

"Old man, you're quite old. Calling me 'great master' again is something I can't accept. Just call me 'Grade B'," Li Xian said with a smile.

"G-grade B?" the old man试探性地 called out. Seeing Li Xian's kind expression, he grew a little bolder. "Grade B great master, this... this matter, I must ask you to report to the Mistress."

"Oh?" Li Xian asked, "What is it? Take your time and explain it clearly."

"It's like this, recently..." the old man said fearfully, "Our village is haunted. Several people have disappeared one after another, without a trace."

"At first, we thought it was a tiger, leopard, or wolf, so we set traps, but we didn't catch anything. Instead, more people went missing. Oh my, you see, the ones who disappeared were all young adults, children, and women. But us old bones, we're fine."

"What are we to do? We old bones, by the time spring comes next year, we won't be able to work even if we want to. Please, tell the Mistress and think of a way!"

Li Xian frowned. "Is there such a thing?"

"It's absolutely true," the old man nodded.

After some discussion, Li Xian went to see the scene for himself. The village really was missing many people, but there were no clues. He could only give up for now and promised to report back to the manor.

Having patrolled this far, Li Xian gave the order to return to the manor. The old man, fearing Li Xian wouldn't take it to heart, specifically sent a basket of eggs.

Li Xian refused and went straight back.

On the way, pondering the strange affair, he couldn't help but feel a chill in his heart.

"Could it be... that the Immortal in the Jar is still in Qingning County?"

The feeling was incredibly strong.
