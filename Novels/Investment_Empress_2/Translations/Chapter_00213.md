# Chapter 213: Tenfold Bounty, Ice Cube in a Swimsuit?

That night, inside the World Seed.

Above the pitch-black firmament of the World Seed, an additional star had appeared. If one stared intently, they would see it moving at an imperceptible speed, following the exact trajectory of the *Zhou Tian Xing Dou Xuan Dan Jing*.

After the number of Xuan Dan increased, the area of the World Seed grew once more.

It was now roughly the size of a plaza.

"If I were to transform all three hundred and sixty-five Xuan Dan into stars..."

"The size of this minor world would be terrifyingly large."

Li Mo, draped in the Illusory Light Silk, gazed up at the starry sky, his mind wandering.

If he were to project the World Seed outward at that point, he couldn't even imagine how vast the domain would be.

"The Inner Scene is still a bit far off..."

Li Mo retracted his momentary flight of fancy.

He then walked to the side and picked up the Panjie Meteorite Hammer. Inside the World Seed, he didn't need to worry about lacking power and could attempt the move with peace of mind.

He gripped the hammer tightly, bathing in the moonlight, the first stance of the *Heaven Overturning, Earth Shaking, Human Dao Killing Hammer* flowing through his mind.

He adjusted his state to its peak before finally opening his eyes.

He raised the hammer eighty percent, and the light of the Great Yin flared brilliantly.

He brought the hammer down eighty percent, and the Great Sun rose, sun and moon sharing the sky simultaneously.

The Sword Pill and the recently condensed Eight Treasures Devouring Gold Xuan Dan also lit up, seemingly wanting to tear the firmament asunder.

This divine technique was originally not something that could be used merely by observing the divine, nor was it for the Inner Scene.

At least, it required the Outer Scene.

And not just any Outer Scene, for few Fifth Realm cultivators could manifest their Outer Scene while simultaneously drawing down the stars from the sky.

Li Mo was only able to take this shortcut because he possessed his own minor world.

*Whoosh—*

The hammer had not yet fully descended when the overwhelming force in mid-air became unsustainable, shattering with a loud bang.

"I'm still lacking in skill."

Fortunately, he was inside the World Seed; otherwise, this single move would have left him severely injured.

And his True Yuan would have hit rock bottom.

Indeed, he needed at least seven stars.

Suddenly.

A fluctuation transmitted, and Princess Jiang entered.

"Master... what are you... doing?"

Jiang Chulong had never seen such a heaven-shattering scene, startling her until her pinkish ears stood straight up.

"It's nothing, just some small fry who trespassed into this尊's cave dwelling," the尊 said, clasping his hands behind his back and turning around calmly.

"Master is so amazing... what kind of... small fry was it?"

Jiang Chulong looked toward the direction where the chaotic energy churned, as if searching for something.

Those who could find their Master's cave dwelling must be quite formidable, after all.

They might have left some things behind...

"No need to look. I didn't hold back just now."

"Along with their personal belongings, they were all turned to dust," the尊's voice remained as calm as an ancient well.

He didn't dwell on the topic but asked instead, "Why were you late today?"

"It's just that... on the roadside... I picked up a person... and a lid..."

Princess Jiang, late for the first time, was extremely nervous, her fingers twisting together in a knot.

She stammered in explanation.

She didn't know.

The expression under the尊's mask grew increasingly strange.

So, the lid that Master Xue and Junior Brother Xiao Bao had been searching for for so long ended up hitting the head of the escaping Xu Yi?

What a coincidence.

What an unlucky old fellow...

With luck this terrible, looking at it from another angle, one might wonder if it's actually good luck...

As expected of a genius assassin from the Drizzle Building who made it onto the潜龙榜; even with his Dantian sealed and tied up like a mummy, he still managed to slip out.

Today, he didn't need to teach Princess Jiang a lesson.

She needed to condense a Xuan Dan similar to a Sword Pill.

Thus, the teaching process became much simpler.

The scene inside the World Seed switched to a擂台, with many straw men added below the stage, each holding various weapons.

A careful student would notice that the aura of these straw men was somewhat similar to the opponents Li Mo had encountered during the Martial Dao Summit.

"Today... am I still fighting... straw men?"

"Mm, the strength of the straw men will get stronger and stronger~"

...

Midnight.

While Princess Jiang was fighting the straw men inside the World Seed on her own, Li Mo went to the woodshed to check on Xu Yi.

"Was he hit on the forehead or the back of his head?"

"Why is he bleeding from both?"

"The clothes on his back are also torn..."

Little Li couldn't figure it out.

Could it be that he was mistaken for a thief stealing the furnace lid by Master Xiao Bao and Elder Xue, and beaten up again?

Seeing the investment feedback, he still bandaged the man's head with gauze, sprinkled some golden sore medicine on it, and wrapped him up like a mummy.

"Should I wake him up?"

Little Li fell silent for a moment, then shook his head.

Originally, his mind wasn't quite right, and now he's suffered such a heavy injury; with a split personality and a concussion, he'd just wake up drooling and babbling anyway.

It's more convenient to just use the Eye of Destiny directly.

So.

Eye of Destiny, activate!

Instantly, Xu Yi's recent encounters and information floated before his eyes.

Li Mo: "..."

It was... hard to comment on.

He said he didn't intend to betray me... or rather, he didn't intend to betray money, so why did he sneak out?

To be fair, Xu Yi could be considered as helping him.

So why did he sneak out?

"Probably a professional habit..."

"If Xu Yi doesn't go back to report, the Drizzle Building will increase the bounty on me..."

Li Mo felt a bit of a headache.

A tenfold bounty.

He wondered if any Outer Realm experts would make a move?

Right at this moment.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Xu Yi' and helping him bandage his wounds.】

【Investment Feedback: Cool Summer Black Temptation.】

Li Mo: "What the hell is this?"

【Cool Summer Black Temptation】:

"A bikini swimsuit, made of Black Cloud Silk. Those who have worn it praise it highly. Size adapts automatically."

"..."

How can this guy's feedback be so unseemly?

Li Mo shook his head.

He walked up the stairs, preparing to go to the top floor to find the Ice Cube. Today's dual cultivation session hadn't been completed yet.

"A bikini swimsuit, what use is this thing?"

"There's no beach here or anything, who is it for to wear?"

As Li Mo was feeling speechless, he reached the rooftop.

On the rooftop, the night breeze blew in from the lake, making the girl's dress cling to her body, outlining her slender and exquisite figure. The fluttering hem of her skirt in the wind made her look even more like an ice lotus, blooming yet still in bud.

Before he could walk over.

A system notification sounded in Li Mo's ear.

【Ding.】

【Cool Summer Black Temptation has found a suitable template.】

【Customizing size according to the template.】

Li Mo: "???"

He swore, he wasn't thinking anything inappropriate just now.

Any normal person would have some wild thoughts in this situation, right?

System, you're ambushing me!

If the System could speak, it would surely sneer:

"Oh ho ho, *this* counts as an ambush?"

Because, the next moment.

An unforgettable scene appeared in Li Mo's mind.

It was the presentation stage after the swimsuit was customized.

As is well known, a presentation requires a model.

It was the swimsuit-clad Ice Cube.

So Li Mo's eyes froze, suddenly feeling an intense itch in his nose...

"Hm?"

Sensing the movement behind her, Ying Bing turned around.

Seeing a trail of warm red flowing from the少年's nose, her delicate brows furrowed:

"You got beaten up?"
