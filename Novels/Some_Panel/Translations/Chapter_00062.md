# Chapter Sixty-Two: Suppression

"Jian Yuan, kid, you're finally back."

As Jian Yuanzi and the others landed, a sinister voice echoed from the opposite side. Yang Ji looked over and saw six figures opposite him. The one speaking was the old woman standing at the very front. She was hunched, her skin sallow, her face crisscrossed with wrinkles like ravines. Her eyes were cloudy, half-closed, and held a cold, eerie glint.

This person dared to call Jian Yuanzi "kid," so it was obvious she was Granny Tianshang, the Evergreen Sect's oldest Nascent Soul True Monarch. Yang Ji saw "[Death Countdown: 5 Years]" floating above her head and knew that her lifespan of over a thousand years was almost at its end. She wasn't like Luo Xiong; Luo Xiong's bone structure was ruined, and his body was aging, but his soul was still young, his lifespan intact, allowing him to seize a new body and cultivate anew. However, Granny Tianshang would die even if she tried to seize a new body, because her physical body and soul were already too decrepit. If her soul couldn't break through to another level, she would die even if given an immortal body to seize. The physical body is a boat, and the soul is the person inside. If the soul grows old, even the best boat will be nothing but a soulless husk.

"Granny Tianshang," Jian Yuanzi said calmly, "I have brought my disciple. I hope you can grant him a fair fight, a cultivation level match against your disciples and grand-disciples."

"Grant him a cultivation level match?" Granny Tianshang narrowed her eyes and stared at Yang Ji, her gaze sharp, as if wanting to see through him, scrutinizing him up and down. "Your disciple is very young, but at this age, he's only at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment, so his bone structure probably isn't great either. I thought you'd brought someone impressive, but you brought such an unremarkable kid? Does your Canglan Sect have no one left besides Longxiao, that boy?"

Granny Tianshang chuckled coldly. She wasn't tall, and her hunched posture made her appear even smaller and frailer. However, she was still a Nascent Soul True Monarch; with her hands clasped behind her back, her eyes glinting coldly, her presence was quite imposing.

Hearing her sharp words, Jian Yuanzi simply smiled, "You said I could only bring my own disciple. I wouldn't dare break the agreement."

"Hmph! Wouldn't dare?" Granny Tianshang snorted coldly, not believing his nonsense. She looked at Yang Ji twice, then cautiously asked, "How do you prove he's your disciple?"

Jian Yuanzi glanced at Yang Ji, signaling him.

Yang Ji smiled faintly, and the sharpness in his palm burst forth. The surrounding air swiftly transformed into numerous tiny flying swords, whistling back and forth.

"Is this a strand of Severing Fire Sword Intent?" Granny Tianshang's eyes narrowed, instantly recognizing the sword intent.

"The Severing Fire Sword Dao is one of the Eight Guizang Swords. With Granny Tianshang's keen eyesight, I'm sure you can tell at a glance that this cannot be faked," Jian Yuanzi said with a faint smile.

"Hmph! Then I'll agree to your cultivation level match, lest you say I'm afraid of you." Granny Tianshang snorted, then cast a sideways glance behind her. Behind her stood five people: one Nascent Soul True Monarch, one Golden Core True Man, and three peak Foundation Establishment cultivators. From their stance, they were clearly well-prepared. To win this competition, she had likely summoned the most outstanding disciples and grand-disciples from her lineage.

"Who will fight?" she asked coldly.

"I will!"

A muffled thunder-like roar resounded, and a massive figure suddenly leaped out from behind Granny Tianshang, landing with a "bang" in the central area. The ground trembled, and dust instantly flew. This was a burly giant, nearly three meters tall, with thick eyebrows, a broad forehead, a prominent jaw, and tiger-like cheeks. His entire body was covered in blood-red patterns, his arm muscles bulged, and he held a terrifying great axe.

"A barbarian?" Li Changxiao exclaimed in surprise.

"This is my grand-disciple, Man Kui. He's human, but he grew up drinking beast blood, causing his body to mutate into the somewhat rare Beast Berserker Physique," Granny Tianshang said with narrowed eyes and a smile, apparently very satisfied with her grand-disciple.

"Beast Berserker Physique? This guy should be able to activate some kind of beast power within his body, erupting with strength far beyond an ordinary peak Foundation Establishment cultivator. Junior Brother, you need to be careful," Li Changxiao whispered a reminder.

Yang Ji nodded, already seeing most of the giant's information: `[Peak Foundation Establishment]`, `[Beast Berserker Physique: Can activate beast blood within the body, erupting with formidable strength more than three times his own.]`

"Mountain Shattering Style!"

Man Kui didn't speak much, leaping up and directly making his move. A green axe-light surged from the heavy axe, carrying unparalleled power, and chopped down with a roar. This axe strike was incredibly oppressive, tearing through the air and unleashing violent qi currents.

"Junior Brother Man Kui opened with his trump card technique; he clearly wants to end this quickly," said the Golden Core True Man behind Granny Tianshang.

"The Evergreen Sect's top-tier technique, Five Heaven-Shaking Styles! This first move, 'Mountain Shattering Style,' unleashed by this guy, is several times more powerful than when used by an ordinary person," Li Changxiao said in surprise.

Facing this axe strike, Yang Ji's expression remained unchanged. He didn't dodge. With a lift of his hand, a flying sword, shimmering with spiritual light, was already in his grasp.

"Junior Brother Man Kui excels in strength, and the Five Heaven-Shaking Styles he cultivates are even more ferocious and dominant. This person, not knowing the immensity of heaven and earth, actually wants to clash head-on. It seems he'll lose in just one move."

"Senior Brother Man Kui is exceptionally gifted, with natural immense strength. With this axe strike, the qi pressure overwhelms all directions, making one feel trapped in a quagmire. This person won't even be able to escape. It seems those two Heavenly Spirit Fruits are ours."

The people behind Granny Tianshang murmured among themselves, a hint of a smile appearing on their faces.

Li Changxiao and Jian Yuanzi, witnessing this scene, remained completely unperturbed, watching with calm composure.

As the great axe drew near, Yang Ji's eyes flickered upwards. A sharp aura diffused from within his body, and at the same time, the flying sword in his hand moved abruptly, flashing upwards like lightning, instantly unleashing the Shocking Sword Dao. This sword strike carried the force of a myriad of thunderbolts, imbued with a strong three-part sword intent, and met Man Kui's heavy axe.

The reason Yang Ji didn't dodge was that he wanted to use this split-second moment to unleash the Shocking Sword Dao to defend, training his ability to react in critical situations. Clearly, the Shocking Sword Dao was suitable for such a scenario because this sword technique was a single move, executed in an instant, making it ideal for counterattacking in a crisis.

*Boom!*

The heavy axe and the flying sword crashed together in an instant. The green axe-light and sharp sword qi exploded like a storm, spirals of visible energy blasting in all directions.

Just as those behind Granny Tianshang thought the battle was decided, Yang Ji's faint voice echoed in their ears. "Your strength is indeed quite immense!"

Everyone looked and saw Yang Ji's body being forced back one step by a massive force. He planted his back foot, instantly steadying himself. At the same time, a huge force was channeled away through his back foot, causing the bluestone ground where he stood to instantly crack extensively. In contrast, Man Kui was sent flying by a single sword strike, landing with "thud-thud-thud" sounds as he stumbled back several steps before awkwardly stabilizing himself. Everyone looked at the ground and found that with every step he retreated, he left an inch-deep footprint on the bluestone.

Instantly, the victor was clear.
