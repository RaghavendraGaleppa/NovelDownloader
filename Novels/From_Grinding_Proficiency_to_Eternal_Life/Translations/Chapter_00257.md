# Chapter 257: The Depths

Su Zhenhe’s expression shifted slightly. He stepped forward for a closer look, his expression easing a fraction. "There are no senior brothers from my Xuanzhen Sect here."

Xu Yunfan raised his chin, a playful curl touching his lips as he pointed toward the shadows around the corner. "Brother Su, you are mistaken. Look over there."

Su Zhenhe followed his gaze, and his expression shook violently. Before the mottled wall at the corner of the corridor, a skeleton clad in the tattered Daoist robes of the Xuanzhen Sect sat bolt upright. Its distinct joints gripped a broken green-ridged sword. Though the blade was snapped, the hilt clearly bore the unique "Blue Mountain Cloud Pattern" of the Xuanzhen Sect.

The skeleton’s head was lowered, as if it had been gazing at the sword mark in its final moments. A jade hairpin, fallen from a disheveled topknot, lay on the ground; the characters "Xuan Zhen" on its head had long been eroded by time and were barely discernible.

"This... how could this be..."

Su Zhenhe’s throat bobbed, his face turning deathly pale in an instant.

He stumbled forward, his trembling fingers tracing the darkly embroidered star patterns on the remnants of the robe. This was the "Purple Sky Star Emblem," which only the sect leader of the Xuanzhen Sect throughout the generations was permitted to wear.

A vicious, slanting crack ran through the skeleton's chest bones, faintly retaining burn marks, exactly matching the injuries caused by the "Nine曜 Burning Heaven Qi" recorded in the sect's classics.

"It seems that two thousand years ago, your sect's senior did not 'enter the palace without anyone knowing.'"

Xu Yunfan gently stroked the restless scale leaves of his dragon scale armor, his gaze fixed on a bronze token half-hidden between the skeleton's finger joints, his eyes flashing slightly.

Although the Xuanzhen Sect suffered a fatal attack from the Nine曜 Sect's Nine曜 Burning Heaven Qi, it seemed they had obtained what they wanted.

"However, this Daoist Master seems to have left behind something interesting."

Xu Yunfan said, unable to help but look up at Zhou Tianyan’s group, who had already disappeared around the corner in the blink of an eye.

These people had a clear objective and didn't linger at all over the skeleton in the corridor.

Xu Yunfan wasn't in a rush. Although the White Jade Palace currently looked inexplicably dilapidated, it was better to be cautious. There was no need to rush to the front.

Taking advantage of Su Zhenhe’s hesitation and uncertainty, Xu Yunfan stepped forward first and snatched the token from the skeleton's hand.

Su Zhenhe, standing by, secretly cursed internally but dared not make any sudden moves. He simply looked on eagerly and said, "Brother Xu, this token is definitely a keepsake left by my Xuanzhen Sect. Why don't you let me take a look?"

Xu Yunfan’s hand stiffened slightly but returned to normal in an instant. He looked up at Su Zhenhe with a meaningful, half-smiling expression.

"I will keep this for now. I will return it to you once we leave the秘境 (Secret Realm)."

Su Zhenhe opened his mouth but said nothing more. He nodded and changed the subject. "Brother Xu, it looks like we need to speed up. If Zhou Tianyan and the others get there first, we might be at a disadvantage."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly without speaking, his mind occupied by the two complex characters on the token.

Su Zhenhe was just talking off the top of his head; this token definitely didn't belong to the Xuanzhen Sect. The characters were similar to those on the lintel of the White Jade Palace gate.

Although he didn't know what they meant, still...

Xu Yunfan looked back at the corridor above. The sword and saber marks on the jade walls were still conspicuous. The experts from various sects must have been locked in a desperate battle back then.

Seeing that Xu Yunfan wasn't moving immediately, Su Zhenhe had grown used to it. He crouched down to pay respects to the skeleton, then examined it carefully, and his expression changed drastically.

"It's... the third-generation sect leader of the Xuanzhen Sect, 'Daoist Master Qingyue'!"

This Daoist Master Qingyue originally possessed strength that overshadowed the world, his martial power terrifying enough to suppress all heroes.

"The records state that Daoist Master Qingyue once served as the Abbot of Xuanzhen Temple. He entered the Ninth Realm of Qi Condensation before the age of forty, and finally, at the age of fifty, the 'Knowing Fate' year, he broke through the Heaven and Earth Pass to reach the Land Immortal Realm. It was said he had ascended in glory, yet who would have thought he died here in the White Jade Palace..."

Su Zhenhe’s expression was complex.

Xu Yunfan said, "It seems two thousand years ago, this sect leader obtained a key item from the chaotic battle, but ultimately couldn't walk out alive."

Although this Daoist Master Qingyue had snatched the token from the top experts of various sects, he was struck by the dying counterattack of a Supreme Elder from the Nine耀 Sect. The Nine耀 Burning Heaven Qi blasted into his body, leaving him on the verge of death.

That was why he moved alone to the corner to sit cross-legged and wait for death.

This Daoist Master Qingyue was indeed arrogant, disdaining to die together with the experts of other sects; he had to find a separate spot even in death.

Two thousand years ago, this White Jade Palace was likely filled with dangers, making it impossible even for a supreme grandmaster of the Ninth Realm of Qi Condensation to advance an inch. But now, after two thousand years, who could live forever?

The White Jade Palace is ultimately an inanimate object. After so many years, whatever strange and eerie things existed have long since perished with time.

"It's about time. Let's go check it out first."

Xu Yunfan tossed down a sentence and then followed the traces left by Zhou Tianyan and the others, passing through a dark corridor and stepping into the depths of the White Jade Palace.

Su Zhenhe naturally didn't dare to be negligent upon seeing this. With such a powerhouse leading the way, he certainly wouldn't let the opportunity slip.

Sometimes, by carefully staying on the sidelines and letting the two sides weaken each other, one can naturally sit back and reap the benefits.

Su Zhenhe’s eyes flashed. He specialized in the "Coiling Dragon Technique" of the Xuanzhen Sect and naturally had a strategic mind.

As Xu Yunfan stepped into the great hall deep within the White Jade Palace, a wave of decay rushed at him. The light inside the hall was dim, and the high ceiling was suspended, but it was already covered with cracks like spider webs, as if it could collapse at any moment.

The jade pillars carved with coiling dragons around were broken and toppled; the once-exquisite reliefs had been eroded by time and blurred, leaving only the ferocious dragon heads, their empty eye sockets staring at the intruders.

The jade tiles on the ground were shattered, and strange black mist seeped from the cracks, as if some decaying power was slowly reviving.

On both sides of the hall, the shattered bronze lamps had long been extinguished, the lamp oil dried up into black scabs, and the air was filled with a mixture of decay and metallic rust.

Xu Yunfan’s gaze swept around, then focused on the end of the hall.

At the very end of this dilapidated hall, a high platform stood tall, carved entirely from flawless white jade. It was surprisingly untouched by the passage of time, still emitting a soft, moist luster, standing in stark contrast to the surrounding hall.

And atop the high platform sat a man in a meditative posture. His face was like jade, his features as fine as a painting, as if he were merely sleeping.

He wore a plain white robe, and a faint halo of clarity surrounded him, contrasting sharply with the decay of the hall.

The man's skin was like jade, his lips as red as cinnabar, and his long hair was like ink, falling over his shoulders. A green jade hairpin among his hair shimmered with spiritual light, making him look like a banished immortal, untainted by the mortal world.

He's alive?!

Xu Yunfan’s heart shook violently, only to realize immediately that the man had no breath at all, and the blood and energy in his body were silent and dried up.

Xu Yunfan’s gaze sharpened, and he was secretly shocked: "This person... looks just like a living person?"

Even if the martial path were perfected, with every realm entering perfection, refining the body to be flawless and pure, like a body of glazed glass, entering the profound...

But after hundreds of years, he would still be like that Daoist Master Qingyue, reduced to a mere skeleton. A light poke with a finger would shatter the bone.
