# Chapter 446: There Are Always Shortcuts to Wealth

Xu Yunfan stood suspended in mid-air, his robes snapping violently in the fierce gale.

Black lightning still writhed like a living creature along the edge of the True Martial Sword, casting the area within a hundred zhang in flickering light and shadow.

His spiritual sense spread out like a net, clearly detecting over a dozen concealed auras on the periphery of True Martial Peak. The Foundation Establishment experts hiding within the clouds barely had time to suppress their shock; the ripples of their spiritual fluctuations were already trembling through the air.

"Three swords..."

A hundred miles away, on a cliff on the east side of a suspended peak, a white-bearded old man watched the small mirror in his hand crack with a crisp *snap*. He grimaced in heartache. Although this mirror wasn't a defensive treasure, it could peer across ten thousand miles. Yet, Xu Yunfan had sensed it and shattered it with the sword intent condensed from the Ten Thousand Chariots Transformation Sword.

He had been using the "Penetrating Mystery Mirror" secret technique to watch the battle, and the searing pain from that "Karma Severing" sword light still lingered in his Sea of Consciousness.

The old man's expression was grave. He admitted that if he had faced Xu Yunfan's sword head-on, he might have ended up no better than Li Baichuan.

Li Baichuan hadn't even had time to unfold his Blood Fiend Foundation before being cut down by three swords.

It was simply terrifying.

"Is this truly someone who just entered Foundation Establishment?"

His combat prowess was almost comparable to the sword cultivators of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect who are obsessed with the sword... No, perhaps it was even slightly superior.

In the clouds to the west, two cultivators standing on a bone flying boat exchanged a glance. The Taoist on the left silently put away the Shadow Pearl he was using to record the scene. His right hand unconsciously stroked the jade token at his waist—a device meant to transmit messages to his accomplices, hoping to snatch something from Xu Yunfan. It had already been crushed into dust.

They saw it clearly. When Li Baichuan unleashed the Hundred Soul Banner, Xu Yunfan's sword momentum twisted with perfect control and suddenly surged by thirty percent. This clearly showed he had anticipated the opponent's desperate counterattack.

The True Martial Subduing Demon Sword Art had reached a state of perfection. Every sword strike resonated with the rhythm of heaven and earth, the sword momentum drawing upon the spiritual energy of the four directions, faintly revealing the profound mystery of "The Dao follows nature."

Such mastery in swordsmanship clearly touched the threshold of the "True Meaning of the Sword Dao."

The Dao that those fanatical sword cultivators of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect spent their entire lives pursuing.

The extreme, obsessive sword maniacs might not be able to comprehend the true essence of the Sword Dao even after a hundred years, yet Xu Yunfan displayed it effortlessly with a mere lift of his hand.

"What a Divine Martial Foundation. What a True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra."

In the pine forest on the southern foothills, the Seven Emotion Threads in the fingertips of a woman in a purple robe snapped one by one.

She had planned to pick up the pieces after both sides were exhausted, but now she completely hid her figure within a water pavilion. The surrounding array formations operated silently, erasing her aura and concealing her karmic connections.

The most shocked was the gray-robed array master hiding within the earth veins.

The array disc in his hand showed that when Xu Yunfan's third sword fell, the earth energy of the entire True Martial Peak was stirred. Every step of his seemingly casual footwork landed precisely on the eye of the "Nine Nether Evil Attraction Array" that the array master had painstakingly arranged.

Right now, the three main array flags in his chest were self-igniting. The scorching pain searing his chest flesh made him sweat profusely, yet he dared not move a muscle.

If his aura fluctuated even slightly, Xu Yunfan would detect him instantly. Perhaps the very next moment, a sword would come flying over.

Suddenly, a cold snort echoed from the depths of the clouds, and the over dozen probing spiritual senses retreated like a receding tide. A few who were too slow had their spiritual senses swept by the Northern Polar Demon-Subduing Qi that Xu Yunfan deliberately released, instantly feeling as if struck by lightning.

Everyone then realized that the True Martial Shadow surrounding the young man was not merely for defense; it had turned the water spiritual qi within ten miles into an extension of his perception. Their supposedly secret窥探 had long been used by the other party as live targets for establishing dominance.

The mountain wind swept over, carrying the scent of scorched earth. Xu Yunfan finally slowly descended his sword light.

He deliberately used the tip of the True Martial Sword to lift Li Baichuan's tattered storage bag.

The Primordial Origin Sect naturally forbade infighting among fellow disciples, but Li Baichuan came to deliver himself to death; no one could argue against that, no matter where they went.

This action caused the few auras that had not yet fled far to suddenly freeze. One of them even lost control and crashed into a snow pine on a distant mountain peak.

It seemed there would be peace for a while.

Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath. A wisp of spiritual power condensed at his fingertips as he gently tapped the scorched black storage bag.

With a *hiss* of burning, the blood fiend restrictions remaining at the mouth of the bag melted away like snow facing a blazing sun.

The spiritual imprint on the bag had already vanished with Li Baichuan's death.

The moment his spiritual sense entered, his eyebrows raised slightly. This seemingly ordinary storage bag actually contained a three-zhang square dimensional space.

In a demonic sect giant like the Primordial Origin Sect, disciples always followed the convention of "Wealth follows the dead; upon death, the Dao vanishes."

Every cultivator carried their life's accumulation with them. This was not only due to the survival法则 of mutual deception among demonic cultivators—where even the strictest restrictions on a cave dwelling couldn't withstand the schemes of fellow sect members—but also stemmed from the paranoia deeply rooted in the demonic path: they would rather perish with all their wealth than let opportunities benefit others.

If one dies, everything ends. But if one's treasures were dug up by others while still alive, that would be even more agonizing than death.

Xu Yunfan's fingertips brushed over the drying blood on the storage bag. He suddenly remembered the cold joke Master Baiyue once told: "In our Primordial Origin Sect, the most dangerous thing is never the missions, but the storage bags of fellow disciples."

This seemingly jesting remark now appeared exceptionally real and piercing under the illumination of the blood fiend crystals scattered all over the ground.

The first to roll out were seven Blood Marrow Crystals, each exuding an eerie dark red luster. Xu Yunfan lifted one with his sword tip; under the sunlight, he could see the liquid blood fiend flowing inside. "Good material for refining Thunder Pearls..."

He recalled the "Heavenly Craft Thunder Register" he had seen in the Primordial Origin Sect's library. It recorded that crystals tainted with blood fiend, after being tempered by Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil qi with spiritual power, could become effective tools to suppress evil spirits.

Next, a jade box caught his attention.

As the lid was opened, three pitch-black "Nine Nether Spirit Orchids" lay quietly on Cold Jade Marrow. The dew condensed at the stamens was actually rare True Yin Primordial Water.

Xu Yunfan's breath hitched slightly. This was the main ingredient for refining the Foundation Establishment breakthrough pill, "Xuanming Pill." Even in the sect's Contribution Hall, it required five thousand contribution points to exchange for just one stalk.

What surprised him most was the roll of dark golden beast hide.

Unfurling it, the words "Xuandu Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Script" appeared, causing his heart to tremble. After reading it carefully, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a surge of wild joy.

This was an extremely high-grade artifact refining method!

Although the "Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven" recorded within was extremely profound, the techniques in the latter half regarding "Spiritual Material Purification" and "Artifact Rune Inscription" were truly exquisite.

This method was based on the "Eight Sceneries Twenty-Four True Forms" theory from the *True Declarations*. It stated that artifact refiners should contemplate the Eight Sceneries Holy Land of Xuandu—such as the Great Void White Moon and the Jade Mountain Terrace—and draw the Eight Sceneries True Forms into the artifact.

Artifacts are not merely forms of gold and iron, but "Crevices of Creation." Refining artifacts is refining the pivot of Yin and Yang in heaven and earth... Artifacts are the dregs of the Dao; when refined to the extreme, even dregs can turn into sweet dew.

The Dao of artifact refining described in the scroll truly broadened Xu Yunfan's vision.

He carefully read the passages describing the nesting technique, pondering whether to use this method to refine his previous Mountain Shaking Sea Pressing Hammer and Piercing Cloud Bow. If he could find some materials to go with it, even if it couldn't become a Dharma Treasure, it would definitely be a top-grade Magic Artifact.
