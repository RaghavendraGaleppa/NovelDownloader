# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass  
Chapter 116: Message Across a Thousand Miles  

The few alchemists available were either eccentric recluses who spent their days obsessively refining pills while ignoring worldly affairs, or they charged exorbitant fees—hundreds of spirit stones per batch, with some even demanding thousands.  

Most Foundation Establishment cultivators couldn’t afford such steep prices, let alone someone as insignificant as Ma Tianxiong.  

Had he not encountered Lin Xuan, his trip to the Spirit Medicine Mountain would have ended in bitter disappointment.  

*Fine, I’ll help him this once—consider it repayment for past kindness.*  

With that thought, Lin Xuan poured the ingredients into the cauldron and began the refinement process.  

Two hours later, a loud *boom* echoed through the chamber.  

Lifting the lid, Lin Xuan sighed at the sight of the blackened, ruined pills inside. His alchemical talent truly was lacking.  

However, his expression quickly returned to normal. He clenched the failed pills in his hand and began channeling the power of his Star Sea.  

---  

The next day, Ma Tianxiong arrived outside the cave abode, his heart filled with nervous anticipation.  

Though he knew Lin Xuan was the esteemed disciple of the Spirit Medicine Mountain’s sect master and thus unlikely to be unskilled in alchemy, the saying "care breeds anxiety" held true. The Martial Cultivation Pill was simply too important to him.  

The wait was agonizing, but after less than an hour, the stone door swung open, and Lin Xuan stepped out.  

"Senior..."  

Seeing the man’s anxious expression, Lin Xuan smiled faintly. He understood the desperation of a cultivator on the verge of a breakthrough. With a flick of his sleeve, a small jade vial flew toward Ma Tianxiong.  

Overcome with excitement, Ma Tianxiong hastily uncorked the bottle. Inside lay several pill-sized pellets, their color and fragrance identical to what the elders had described—genuine Martial Cultivation Pills.  

With these, he could eliminate the hidden dangers in his cultivation and finally grasp the hope of reaching Foundation Establishment.  

Overjoyed, Ma Tianxiong bowed deeply, his gratitude overflowing. "Words cannot express my thanks, Senior. I have no way to repay your kindness, but please accept these spirit stones as a token of my appreciation—payment for your alchemical efforts."  

As he spoke, he produced a storage pouch and poured out a small mountain of spirit stones.  

Lin Xuan swept them with his spiritual sense—nearly two hundred stones in total.  

He was slightly surprised. Who would have guessed this unassuming Ma Tianxiong from Drifting Cloud Valley had such wealth?  

But Lin Xuan didn’t take them.  

First, he had no shortage of spirit stones. While this sum might be substantial to others, his recent windfall from selling Marrow-Cleansing Pills at the Sea Dragon Pavilion made it insignificant. Since he had intended to repay a past favor, the Martial Cultivation Pills were a gift.  

Second, he had another favor to ask, making it even less appropriate to accept payment.  

"There’s no need for formalities, Fellow Daoist," Lin Xuan said, withdrawing his gaze from the stones. "We both hail from Yanzhou. Consider this my way of returning a kindness."  

"How could I possibly accept that?" Ma Tianxiong shook his head vigorously. "You’ve already done me a great service by refining these pills. I can’t let you work for nothing!"  

"Think nothing of it." Lin Xuan retrieved a pink talisman from his sleeve. "An old acquaintance of mine is close to the Cloud-Soaring Fairy of your sect. When you return to Drifting Cloud Valley, deliver this message talisman to Lady Qin. That will be repayment enough."  

Ma Tianxiong was no fool. Seeing Lin Xuan’s expression, he guessed at the underlying meaning but didn’t pry. He accepted the talisman solemnly. "Rest assured, Senior. I will fulfill your request without fail."  

Lin Xuan nodded. He trusted Ma Tianxiong’s character—unlike most scheming, opportunistic cultivators, this man was straightforward and honest.  

As for whether Ma Tianxiong might eavesdrop on the talisman’s contents, Lin Xuan had no concerns. Ever cautious, he had taken precautions. This message talisman was crafted with a unique technique that required one of two conditions to open:  

Either the recipient cultivated the *Nine Heavens Profound Art*—a technique known only to Qin Yan and himself—or they had to be at least two major realms above the creator.  

Since Lin Xuan was at the early Foundation Establishment stage, only a Nascent Soul elder could forcibly break the seal.  

The odds of Ma Tianxiong knowing such a figure were slim, and even if he did, Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn’t stoop to such pettiness.  

After seeing Ma Tianxiong off, Lin Xuan returned to his cave abode and sat cross-legged, attempting to meditate. But his mind was restless, haunted by the image of a graceful figure.  

He stood up abruptly.  

Distraction was the bane of cultivation—a single misstep could lead to qi deviation. It seemed his mental fortitude still needed work. Ever since hearing about Qin Yan from Ma Tianxiong, thoughts of the ethereal beauty had lingered in his mind.  

Lin Xuan took several deep breaths, forcing the distracting thoughts to settle.  

This wouldn’t do. While it was natural to admire beauty, his priority now was strengthening his power. He couldn’t afford to let anything divert his focus from cultivation.  

A determined glint flashed in Lin Xuan’s eyes as he resumed his meditation.  

---  

Several days later, Elder Tongyu announced his decision to name Lin Xuan as the next sect master of Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

The sect was thrown into an uproar. Lin Xuan had been a disciple for less than a year—how could such a promotion be justified?  

But Elder Tongyu’s mind was made up.  

To quell dissent, he had Lin Xuan demonstrate his alchemical skills, proving the decision was based on merit, not favoritism.  

The "demonstration" was essentially a repeat of the entrance test—Lin Xuan entered the alchemy chamber alone, with no observers. Refining pills required absolute concentration, and distractions were forbidden.  

With no one watching, Lin Xuan freely employed his Star Sea purification technique.  

Over the past few days, he had realized that becoming the heir apparent would grant him easier access to failed pills, so he no longer resisted the appointment.  

He had also devised a plan for the test.  

Out of five sets of Marrow-Cleansing Pill ingredients, he purified only one—yielding a single high-grade pill with a mere 20% success rate.  

High-grade pills were legendary even in the cultivation world. Not even Elder Tongyu could reliably produce them.  

Yet Lin Xuan had succeeded.  

Though luck played a role, none could deny that luck was also a form of strength.  

The opposition fell silent. With Elder Tongyu and several elders backing Lin Xuan, dissenters dared not voice further objections.  

Such a prodigy would surely elevate the sect’s alchemical prowess to new heights.  

Though a minority still grumbled, the leadership’s unanimous decision left them powerless.  

As the heir apparent, Lin Xuan’s authority grew daily.  

Apart from a few elders, most disciples now treated him with deference. Even in a sect where alchemy took precedence over hierarchy, no one dared underestimate the future leader.  

The time was ripe.  

That day, Lin Xuan visited the Failed Pill Repository.  

Unlike Drifting Cloud Valley’s disorganized storage, Spirit Medicine Mountain’s failed pills were meticulously cataloged.  

Before him stood an elegant three-story pavilion, its wooden structure reinforced with fireproof and waterproof spells.  

Powerful restrictions surrounded the building. Though it appeared only ten meters away, attempting to walk there would lead to endless circling—an advanced illusion array had warped the space itself.  

Lin Xuan produced a jade token and channeled spiritual power into it. With a single swipe, the formation parted effortlessly. As the future sect master, he had access to all restricted areas.  

Inside, a few disciples were busy with their tasks under the supervision of a middle-aged cultivator.  

Spotting Lin Xuan, the man blinked in surprise before hurrying over with a smile. "Ah, Senior Brother Lin! To what do we owe this honor?"  

Though he addressed Lin Xuan as "senior brother" out of courtesy, his demeanor was as deferential as if greeting an elder.  

For one, Lin Xuan had reached Foundation Establishment—a full realm above his own Qi Refinement cultivation.  

For another, as the heir apparent, their statuses were worlds apart.  

Lin Xuan nodded. "No need for formalities. May I know your name?"  

"Junior is Jin Tao, a disciple of Elder Zhao, currently assigned to manage the Failed Pill Repository. How may I assist you, Senior Brother?"  

"I require a batch of failed Foundation Establishment pills. Would that be possible?"  

"Foundation Establishment failed pills?" Jin Tao hesitated. While he could freely dispose of Marrow-Cleansing failed pills—true waste—Foundation Establishment failed pills still had some value. Each was meticulously recorded, and even he, as the manager, couldn’t secretly pocket them.  

"I’m conducting alchemical research and need them for experimentation," Lin Xuan explained.  

Jin Tao wavered. "Well..."
