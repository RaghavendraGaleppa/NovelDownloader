# Chapter 498: The Divine Monkey Is Born

The moment claws touched stone, the entire mountain peak fell into a sudden, profound silence.

Deep within the primordial yellow stone, the violently pulsing "swastika" Buddhist rune and the black water Xuanwu Dao rhythm luminance simultaneously erupted with blinding light.

The sudden flash startled the troop of apes into shrieking, scrambling to flee in all directions.

The motion of Sanzang's raised hand froze in mid-air, a flicker of astonishment crossing his eyes, which then transformed into the clarity of one who understands cause and effect.

He turned his gaze toward the depths of the Eastern Wasteland, where a sky-obscuring妖氛 (demon aura), mixed with the breath of endless primordial wilderness, surged toward the heavens. Slowly, a smile of profound Zen meaning spread across his face as he softly chanted a Buddhist mantra: "Good! The rise and fall of karma have their own fixed numbers. This is the will of Heaven, and also your destiny!"

It seemed the Demon Kings of the Eastern Wasteland were getting restless and unwilling to maintain their dignity.

Since they did not wish to keep their dignity, then he would help them lose it.

Sanzang's thoughts raced like lightning, his eyes lowering.

Before his words had fully faded...

"BOOM!!!"

The primordial yellow stone shattered in response.

Debris shot through the sky, as the dense Primordial Yellow Qi, dark golden Buddhist light, and black water Xuanwu Dao rhythm frantically intertwined and collapsed.

At the core, a scarlet shadow broke out of the stone shell like a meteor, carrying the overwhelming aura of a life origin embryo and the bold spirit of a newborn calf. It fiercely pierced through the smoke and dust of the shattered rock, landing firmly upon the mountain stone.

The dust gradually cleared.

Revealing a miraculous ape, standing about the height of a man, its entire body as red as flame.

It bore none of the foul stench of ordinary beasts. Its fine, dense fur reflected a warm, reddish-gold luster under the sunlight, and between its bones and muscles, a fierce and domineering true meaning of martial arts surged like a hidden current in a vast ocean.

The ape opened its eyes for the first time. Its pupils were as clear as red crystal, reflecting the vast blue sky above and the thousands of miles of the Eastern Wasteland below. Novelty, confusion, and exploration intertwined within its gaze.

Subconsciously, it moved its limbs. The stretching of its bones and muscles actually brought forth a low, rumbling sound like thunder from tigers and leopards. The immense power contained within caused the surrounding air to distort.

Its gaze wandered, finally settling on the moon-white figure before it.

The fierce winds atop the peak whipped Sanzang's tattered monk's robe, making it snap and flutter.

At this moment, he was a mortal flesh body, looking haggard, with unhealed bloodstains still on his feet.

However, his standing posture was like a solitary peak or a bedrock, his brows and eyes bearing the endless compassion that had weathered ten thousand tribulations without eroding. His gaze was clear and bright, seeing through the illusions of the world.

Though he possessed not a single fluctuation of Buddhist power, the clean solemnity and perfect wisdom emanating from the depths of his soul were like mountains and oceans—vast and boundless.

His dignified appearance formed naturally, and his awe-inspiring aura penetrated to the bone.

The moment the scarlet ape met those eyes, all the restlessness and beastly instincts in its heart strangely quieted down. A feeling of affection and awe, originating from its bloodline and the imprint of the stone fetus, arose spontaneously. It was as if a wandering son had finally seen his kind father, or a weary bird returning to the nest of the Buddha.

Sanzang clasped his hands together, his voice like a morning bell, thick and peaceful yet carrying the compassion to save the world: "The stone fetus opened because of the karma destined for you. You and I share the bond of master and disciple. I now wish to impart to you the supreme and wondrous Dharma, grant you the divine power to protect the Dao, subdue evil, promote good, and cleanse the demon aura. Are you willing to bow to me as your master and follow me in seeking the path of the ultimate truth and ultimate goodness?"

His voice was not loud, yet it contained the true meaning of the Lion's Roar of Buddhism, each word striking directly at the soul.

The scarlet ape's body trembled slightly. An incomparably intense resonance and sense of belonging surged in its heart without reason. The Buddhist spiritual light within the imprint of its stone fetus origin was completely ignited.

There was no need for hesitation, nor the ability to speak yet. It had already obeyed the call deep in its bloodline. With the most devout posture, it knelt on both knees before the blood-stained moon-white monk's robe and gave Sanzang three solid "thud! thud! thud!" kowtows.

The hard rock left marks on its forehead, but it did not damage its sincerity in the slightest.

It tried its best to raise its head, looking at Sanzang with its red crystal-like eyes. Though it could not speak, the will to adore, respect, and follow was already clearly visible.

"Good! Good disciple!"

A deeper smile appeared on Sanzang's face, revealing relief within his compassion.

Though this ape was a man-made Primordial Being, it possessed a天生道体 (Heaven-given Dao Body) and was extraordinarily exceptional.

He reached out and gently stroked the red fur on the ape's crown. It felt warm and tough to the touch.

This stroke was both to connect hearts and to establish their relationship.

"Since you have entered my sect, you should be given a proper name. You are the creation of a stone fetus, seizing the essence of Heaven and Earth, born to respond to the tribulations of the Eastern Wasteland. Only by understanding the void can one see the true nature of Bodhi. From now on, you shall be called 'Wukong' (Aware of Emptiness)."

"Wukong..."

The ape murmured the name repeatedly. It was as if this name was a thunderclap that split its chaotic mind, or a sweet dew that nourished its soul.

An indescribable sense of clarity and transparency rose from the depths of its soul. The confusion in its red crystal eyes vanished, replaced by unprecedented sobriety and firmness.

It kowtowed again. This time, it spoke. Though its voice was raspy and immature, every word was clear and filled with true intent: "Master! Disciple Wukong thanks Master for the name!"

Sanzang nodded, then opened his withered, thin palm.

A glimmer of light burst from his palm. It was not activated by magic power, but by a thought triggering a storage treasure.

Two ancient and unadorned objects appeared conspicuously.

One was a long staff.

The staff was neither gold nor wood. Its entire body flowed with a deep sea-like dark blue luster. The staff itself was naturally inscribed with the dark patterns of a Xuanwu coiling snake. The turtle shell was thick and heavy, the snake body fierce and vicious, and the sound of flowing water seemed to echo faintly around it.

The moment this staff appeared, the air around it instantly became thick and heavy, concealing the power of a thousand mountains and ten thousand seas.

It was precisely the divine weapon refined from the Dao rhythm of the "True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra" that had locked the true body of Wukong's stone fetus.

The架海紫金棍 (Sea-Piercing Purple Gold Rod)!

The second was a set of battle armor.

The main body of the armor was dark gold, woven from countless fine, scale-like Sanskrit mantras of the Six Syllables. The light was restrained, and its appearance was solemn and dignified.

The breastplates on the chest and back were a clear and round "swastika" golden seal, slowly rotating, emitting boundless light and indestructible defensive Buddhist power.

The armor was not cold metal, but rather warm and smooth like jade, as if cast from the boundless vows of the Pure Land of the Buddhist Kingdom. It was the Six-Syllable Golden Chainmail!

"These two treasures, one is called 'Jiahai' (Piercing the Sea), bearing the true meaning of True Martiality suppressing the sea and Xuanwu defending the pole. It can split rivers and sever seas, possessing great momentum and weight. The other is called 'Suozi' (Chain Mail), containing the Great Bright Mantra of the Six Syllables of Buddhism. It protects the body and the heart, and all evil spirits will flee!"

Sanzang said solemnly: "I grant them to you, hoping that you will use them to guard the Dao and protect your original heart!"

Wukong was overjoyed. As he took the weapon and the armor, he felt a surging stream of heat transmit from the Sea-Piercing Purple Gold Rod and the Six-Syllable Golden Chainmail into his body, instantly resonating perfectly with the Buddhist intent in his chest and the Xuanwu Dao rhythm in his bones and muscles.

It was as if these items had belonged to him since birth.

In his wild joy, he reached out and grasped the Purple Gold Rod. The dark blue light shone brilliantly, and as he swung it, the roar of a Xuanwu could be heard faintly.

The Golden Armor covered his entire body, the dark golden Sanskrit characters flowing, further setting him off like a Dharma protector Vajra descending to the mortal world.

"Thank you, Master, thank you, Master!"

Wukong's excitement was beyond words. The way he said "Master" became even more sincere and respectful.

"Based on your natural endowments, born from a stone fetus, intertwined with Buddhism and Demonism, with the True Martial Dao Bone hidden within, ordinary Buddhist Dharma does not suit your nature."

After Wukong put away the treasures, Sanzang spoke again. The light of wisdom in his eyes was like a torch, as if seeing through the origin of his body. "Today, I shall teach you a supreme battle Dharma that suits your origin: The Battle Dharma of the Great Virtuous Bright King and the Tathagata!"
