# Chapter 417: Blessed Land

Once the True Wu Demon Subjugation ritual begins, it cannot be interrupted. If a Foundation Establishment cultivator were to protect the path, it would indeed reduce many variables. Moreover, the other party has explicitly stated that only those below the Qi Condensation stage are needed. This is a win-win situation...

However, joining his faction means inevitably getting involved in the internal power struggles of the Primordial Origin Sect...

But right now, the most important thing is to successfully establish my foundation. As for future matters, there may still be room for maneuver.

Having weighed these thoughts, Xu Yunfan showed no hesitation and said straightforwardly, "Alright, please give me your instructions, Senior."

Chu Chengnan was stunned, clearly not expecting him to agree so readily. He then chuckled helplessly. "You're quite direct."

Xu Yunfan had already weighed the pros and cons in the blink of an eye. With Foundation Establishment imminent, every second was precious, allowing no room for hesitation.

Furthermore, facing the direct pressure of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, with his current cultivation, if he dared to utter a single word of refusal, he would likely be obliterated body and soul in an instant.

Chu Chengnan nodded, a hint of appreciation flashing in his eyes. "Go on. I will handle everything. After you complete the demon subjugation and渡 (crossing), temporarily restrain your restless mind. The more demons you subjugate with the True Wu method, the thicker your foundation will become. Once you slay the fated person, I will appear and take you to the Blessed Land to compete."

"Thank you, Senior!"

Xu Yunfan said no more. His Martial Dao Heavenly Eye suddenly opened and closed, and a golden light flared like a torch in his pupils, instantly piercing through the void.

In the vision of the Heavenly Eye, seven streams of demonic energy rose into the sky like smoke signals in the night, corresponding to the five poisons of the heart demon: greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance, and doubt.

"Found you."

As the ritual commenced, the True Wu Demon Subjugation had its own karmic牵引 (pull), pointing them out one by one.

He tapped his toes on the ice surface, his figure turning into a pitch-black streak of lightning that tore through the sky.

The energy of the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiends surged through his meridians like thunder, mixed with true essence. Every step he took left behind Dao patterns of intertwined turtle and snake in the void.

The abandoned ancient temple had nowhere to hide under the gaze of the Martial Dao Heavenly Eye. Sticky, tangible black greed qi entangled the debris. A withered, old monk sat cross-legged before the Buddha statue, a stench of rotting flesh seeping from his cassock.

"Benefactor..."

The old monk revealed a mouthful of black teeth as he grinned. "Are you willing..."

"Enough noise!"

Xu Yunfan's right palm chopped down like a blade. Before the pitch-black sword formed by the True Wu Heavenly Gang could touch him, the temple's beams and pillars collapsed with a rumble.

The old monk's body swelled rapidly, three heads simultaneously spewing poisonous mist, and six arms waved, summoning邪器 (evil artifacts) like a purple-gold alms bowl and skull prayer beads.

"To claim the heavens'功劳 (merit) and possess the aura of a face-demon, how dare you call yourself a Buddha?"

After saying this coldly, Xu Yunfan's expression became slightly peculiar. He had joined a demonic sect now, so he didn't really have the face to speak such grandiose words.

The Turtle and Snake Dharma Form manifested behind Xu Yunfan. The玄龟 (Black Tortoise) opened its mouth and spewed the Northern Polar Demon-Subduing Qi, instantly freezing the poisonous mist filling the sky. The冥蛇 (Dark Snake) swept its long tail, shattering all the evil artifacts.

Finally, the Martial Dao Dharma Form rose, with a turtle and snake coiling around its body, like a millstone of heaven and earth grinding the demonic statue into dust.

In the blood-colored forest, the fur of the crimson-eyed giant wolf flowed with magma-like rage. The moment Xu Yunfan appeared, an ancient tree three zhang thick was torn to pieces by the wolf's claws.

"Die!"

Facing the pouncing maw, Xu Yunfan neither dodged nor evaded, his right fist wrapped in the Earthly Fiend of Demon Subjugation and struck out.

The instant his fist touched the wolf's mouth, the暗金 (dark golden)煞气 (fiendish energy) erupted like a volcano, penetrating from the giant wolf's mouth to the back of its neck.

The妖躯 (demonic body) had not yet hit the ground when it was burned to ashes from the inside by the Earthly Fiend's fire.

Xu Yunfan did not stop his steps. After killing it with a single punch, he fled without looking back.

Three thousand miles away, a lake was boiling as if cooked. A pitch-black strange fish leaped out, bringing with it a foul, stinking wave.

The fish's gills opened and closed, uttering human words: "Longevity..."

Xu Yunfan's sword finger lightly划 (drew), and the vast true essence in his body transformed into seventy-two chains that interwove into a net. Each chain was branded with Big Dipper star patterns, dismembering the strange fish while purifying its twisted obsession.

Before the fish blood could splatter, it was evaporated into青烟 (green smoke) by the starlight and dissipated.

Outside the Cold Crow Pass, Xu Yunfan stood atop a bluestone. After the Xuanwu Demon-Subduing Seal suppressed the myriad resentful spirits, the Turtle and Snake Dharma Form around his body suddenly became three-tenths more solid.

He closed his eyes and looked inward, feeling the demon-subduing seal in his Dantian swallowing and spitting out the refined pure fiendish energy. Every resentful spirit that was delivered transformed into a wisp of profound Dao rhyme, flowing along his meridians and merging into his Qi Sea.

The body of Golden Marrow and Jade Bones evolved again, with star patterns faintly appearing beneath his skin. When Xu Yunfan clenched his fist, what溢出 (overflowed) from between his fingers was no longer pure power, but the Gang Qi that directly drew upon the周天星辉 (starlight of the celestial cycle).

Relying solely on this physical body, without depending on true essence, Xu Yunfan was confident he could explode and kill a Qi Condensation peak cultivator.

On an unnamed mountain peak in the Northern Wastes, a cultivator in brocade robes stood with his hands behind his back. The words "Wei Chen" (Fine Dust) embroidered with golden threads on his Dao robe shone brightly.

He looked down at Xu Yunfan, his expression somewhat strange.

He was a cultivator of the Primordial Origin Sect's Wei Chen Peak, at the peak of Qi Condensation.

Xu Yunfan's expression was also a bit strange. He looked around and asked, "Senior Brother, why are you here in the Northern Wastes instead of staying in the Primordial Origin Sect to cultivate diligently and seek to establish your Dao Foundation?"

Upon hearing this, the brocade-robed cultivator was slightly stunned, as if suddenly realizing something.

"There is a Foundation Establishment opportunity here, so I naturally wanted to try my luck... That's right, I am already at the peak of Qi Condensation, my nature is perfectly complete, and I have cultivated a strand of Gang and Fiendish energy. Why did I come here to seek a Foundation Establishment opportunity..."

The brocade-robed cultivator's face suddenly filled with panic.

"I've been set up!?"

He suddenly looked at Xu Yunfan, his eyes instantly turning blood-red.

"Only by killing you can I break..."

The cultivator's Adam's apple suddenly caved in; Xu Yunfan's right hand had already clamped his throat.

The Northern Polar Demon-Subduing Qi灌入 (poured in) along his meridians. The cultivator's acupoints exploded one after another, and the flesh and blood that splattered like fireworks froze into ice crystals before they could hit the ground.

Looking at the mangled corpse in his hand, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh. The True Wu Way, with every movement of hands and feet, contained the power of heaven and earth and infinite killing intent. It was far simpler than the cultivators who needed hand seals,口诀 (incantations), or even footwork matching the Dipper Gang to cast their spells.

To kill a peak Qi Condensation cultivator was like killing a chicken.

Under the heavens, he was the number one person below Foundation Establishment.

With every demon slain, Xu Yunfan felt the fusion of the True Wu Heavenly Gang and the Demon-Subduing Earthly Fiend within him deepen by a fraction. The Xuanwu Demon-Subduing Seal in his Dantian became increasingly solid, and the starlight flowing between the turtle shell patterns faintly revealed the trajectory of the周天星斗 (celestial bodies).

Next, all that remained was to subdue the "heart monkey and mind horse" (restless thoughts), to introspect the myriad aspects, and then he could ascend the platform to forge his Dao and become a true cultivator.

"I will now guide you into the Blessed Land. If you can complete your Foundation Establishment within the Blessed Land, there are immense benefits. But you must remember, you must come out to refine your Dao Foundation. Otherwise, if you damage the Blessed Land, you will have to pay the debt with your Essence, Qi, and Spirit, the Three Treasures."

Chu Chengnan's voice suddenly sounded in Xu Yunfan's ear. The tone was flat, but it made Xu Yunfan feel a chill.

Before Xu Yunfan could react, he felt a vast and mighty force suddenly bear down on him. His entire body was plucked into the air like a paper kite with a broken string.

In an instant, the heavens and earth spun, and space-time seemed to be crushed and reorganized by an invisible hand. His consciousness floated in the chaos, with the sound of howling Gang wind and the weeping of ten thousand ghosts in his ears.

By the time his five senses returned, the scene before him was completely different.

(To everyone, I apologize, I have been contemplating these past two days, I will try to post three chapters tomorrow.)
