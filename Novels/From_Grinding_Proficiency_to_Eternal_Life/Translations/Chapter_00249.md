# Chapter 249: The Bald Woman

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained calm, showing no intention of responding. That so-called halo behind his head was merely a spiritual phenomenon manifested through his cultivation of the Calm Mind Spirit Cultivation. Only those who had cultivated the Lin Character Mantra and possessed sharp spiritual perception could vaguely sense it.

Seeing that the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer had little effect, Xu Yunfan simply tossed it aside and formed the Lin Character Seal.

"Lin."

The dragon scale armor on Xu Yunfan’s body sensed the rapid transformation of his muscles and bones. The scales fluttered and emitted a trembling hum.

The blood energy within him surged like erupting magma, releasing strength and force far beyond the norm in an instant. He gripped the Blazing Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel and closed in.

This disciple of the Mituo Temple possessed bizarre abilities and was in peak condition; Xu Yunfan had to give it his all.

In the next moment, his Qi force erupted fully.

The ultimate move of the Nine Profound Arrogant Dragon Cudgel, "Arrogant Dragon Without Regret," transformed into a red meteor that crashed into the halo. Suddenly, Xu Yunfan felt a slight刺痛 (stinging pain) in his Triple Burner meridians. The trace of sword energy left by Pei Yan, stimulated by the Buddha’s light, began to flow slowly, causing his body to go slightly numb.

However, for just an instant, while in the Lin State, he quickly controlled his muscles, squeezed his meridians, and burst forth with Qi force, firmly trapping that strand of sword energy so it couldn't move.

In the Lin State, such an action was completed in an instant. But this instant was spotted by Jingming.

Jingming seized this fleeting opening. Her jade-like fingers formed the Fearless Seal and pressed toward Xu Yunfan’s Heavenly Spirit. The Buddha’s Lion’s Roar shook the mountain rocks, causing them to crumble and fall. "Suppress!"

Blood trickled from Xu Yunfan’s seven orifices, yet his expression remained unchanged even in this near-death moment. Or rather, in the Lin State, facing the terror of life and death, he was as calm as the clouds and the wind.

Although this female monk before him was not in the Blood Transformation Realm, for some unknown reason, she had used a secret technique to forcefully boost her strength to near that level. Relying on various secret martial arts and that Eight Treasure Bodhi Pearl, she was actually able to fight him back and forth for a moment.

The dragon scale armor scales suddenly inverted, stabbing into his flesh. Pure Yang blood energy mixed with the Flood Dragon Evil Qi contained within the dragon scale armor soared into the sky.

He actually used the turmoil of the sword energy seed to forcibly blend the Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength and the Triple Burner Sword Nurturing Technique.

The scarlet Qi wave tore apart the Buddha light curtain. The surface of the Blazing Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel appeared a distorted shadow of a dragon.

"Your Buddha light... can it suppress me?"

Xu Yunfan’s eyes were like torches. The syllables he uttered carried no emotion, as if it were just a plain polite remark.

As he spoke, the muscles on his right arm swelled like they were being blown up with air. The Blazing Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel swept in from the left.

Jingming’s pupils contracted sharply. The Buddha phantom behind her formed the Subduing Demon Seal and pressed down, but the shockwave generated by the collision directly shattered three golden lotus flowers protecting her body.

The female monk’s plain white monk robes were torn in several places by the Qi force, revealing the golden silk soft armor underneath, which was flowing with Sanskrit characters.

Another divine weapon and precious armor?

Even Xu Yunfan, who was in a state close to the Great Dao Forgetfulness, couldn't help but flash a trace of surprise in his eyes upon seeing this.

These sects were truly wealthy. A disciple walking the world actually possessed such a precious armor and divine weapon.

The two figures crossed thirteen times in the air. The sound of metal colliding turned into visible ring-shaped shockwaves.

Jingming suddenly bit the tip of her tongue, spraying out Qi force along with her blood energy, influenced by the Eight Treasure Bodhi Pearl.

The entire valley’s terrain shook violently. Eight golden chains shot out from the ground, binding Xu Yunfan’s limbs. "Great Might Heavenly Dragon, Seal the Demon!"

Xu Yunfan’s neck veins bulged. The phenomenon of Golden Muscle Jade Bone from the Steel Forged Body finally manifested completely.

Golden dragon scale patterns appeared on his skin's surface. His bones emitted a grating friction sound.

He let the chains tighten until the dragon scale armor scales creaked, then suddenly opened his mouth and let out a beast-like roar.

The demonic impurities accumulated in his body from eating demonic beasts for two months turned into black and red smoke at this moment, shattering the Buddhist seal into pieces.

"Impossible..."

Jingming stumbled back half a step. The halo behind her head showed fine cracks.

Xu Yunfan seized this fleeting opportunity. His feet pushed off the ground, breaking through the sound barrier.

Under the extreme stimulation of the Red Flood Dragon Strength, the tip of the Blazing Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel ignited with a dark blue flame.

Jingming hastily summoned her prayer bead artifact, but it didn't even last half a breath before exploding into a cloud of golden powder under the cudgel’s edge.

The female monk finally revealed a look of panic. Her hands formed the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, wanting to escape.

However, Xu Yunfan’s Thunderfire Qilin Hammer struck her back first. The Sanskrit characters on the surface of the golden silk soft armor flickered like a candle in the wind.

The blood sprayed by Jingming congealed into a blood lotus in mid-air, only to be ground into a blood mist by the subsequent gust of wind from the cudgel.

"Can your Buddha save you?"

Xu Yunfan appeared like a ghost on the trajectory of Jingming’s fall, his dragon-scale-covered right hand gripping her throat.

The heavy cudgel was placed against the female monk’s smooth forehead. The heat of the cudgel body sizzled the skin.

Jingming tried to circulate her Buddhist heart method, but found that her blood energy had been sealed by the evil Qi emitted by the Blazing Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel.

Xu Yunfan raised his knee and slammed it heavily into Jingming’s Dantian. Listening to the suppressed groan of pain from the other party, his expression remained unchanged. He struck the other party several more times in succession, shaking apart the blood energy and force within her body until they were difficult to gather before stopping.

He tore off the female monk’s waist sash and tied her hands behind her back. He pulled out the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer beside him and used the armor-piercing cone at the end of the hammer handle to strike heavily upon Jingming’s graceful body. His movements were rough but precise, locking her seven major acupoints and cutting off the flow of her Qi force.

Under such intense pain, even with Jingming’s firm mentality and flawless Buddha heart, she still twisted her face in agony.

When the blood-stained Thunderfire Qilin Hammer gently patted Jingming’s cheek, this always solemn and dignified Buddhist prodigy finally trembled violently.

Xu Yunfan quickly exited the Lin State and let out a long breath. He blinked his eyes, slowly guiding his emotions, no longer sinking into that stone-like state of mind.

The woman in white who appeared in his dreams, relying on the remains of the Ultimate Dao, seemed to be right.

If the Lin Character Mantra was used too much, he might eventually become completely emotionless.

If that happened, how should he resolve it?

"Do you know why I spared your life?"

Xu Yunfan, his mind filled with thoughts, dragged Jingming by the collar toward the ground fire fissure, scraping a deep groove in the ground. "I want you to watch with your own eyes... how the art of salvation that your Buddhism is best at is smashed to pieces by my fists."

Of course, that was just what he said. Naturally, Xu Yunfan wanted to extract the Mituo Temple’s guarding ultimate arts, the Mituo Golden Body Sutra and the Meridian Cleansing Body Technique, from her mouth.

These two divine arts: one is the pinnacle of Buddhist body forging, and the other is unique in marrow cleansing, both being unrivaled in the world.

The female monk struggled to form a seal, but Xu Yunfan grabbed her shiny, bright head and pressed it against the scorching rock wall.

The smell of burnt flesh from the rock wall mixed with the scent of blood entered her nose. Jingming’s shiny head, under the high temperature, welled up with fine blood beads. She wanted to struggle, but Xu Yunfan’s five fingers扣着 (clutched) her skull and ground it into the stone crevice.

She let out half a Buddhist chant from her throat, but it turned into a broken breath because her jaw was pressed by the Blazing Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel.

Looking at Xu Yunfan’s gaze, which held not a shred of hesitation, Jingming finally understood that the other party truly did not care about the Mituo Temple behind her.
