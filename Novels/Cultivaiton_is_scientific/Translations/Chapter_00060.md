# Chapter 60: Tracking

Two nights later, another rogue cultivator was killed.

The death was equally silent and unnoticed, despite the closest cultivator being less than five hundred meters away at the time. The victim was drained of all blood, just like the previous cases.

Another day passed, and new reports emerged. Among the rogue cultivators who had fled the city in fear, two had gone missing. These two had been working for the Zhang family and wouldn't have disappeared without claiming their promised rewards. The next day, their blood-drained bodies were found in their cave dwellings outside the city.

This sent waves of terror through the rogue cultivator community. They began gathering around the four major cultivation families for protection. Meanwhile, Gu Jia increased the bounty for the task from five hundred spirit stones to a thousand.

For several days, Li Shiming dared not cultivate, fearing the spiritual energy fluctuations from his Spirit Gathering Plate might attract the killer's attention. Though he didn't live in the northeastern district of Zhongdu, there was no guarantee the killer was only active there. He minimized his sleep to just two hours during the day, staying awake all night with his monitoring goggles on, watching the surveillance feeds.

On this particular night, as usual, Li Shiming launched his drone. The unmanned aircraft ascended to three hundred meters in the dark sky, rendered invisible by a 'Vanishing Talisman' he had attached—a discovery from his study of the 'Vanishing Technique'. He found that the technique could be applied not just to people but to objects as well, with the same duration regardless of target.

"Interesting!" he murmured as he spotted a figure on the infrared feed. Unlike the usual red heat signatures of humans, this one appeared deep blue—indicating an extremely low temperature. Given it was still summer with warm nights, such a cold signature stood out starkly. Only one creature fit this description: a corpse puppet.

Li Shiming felt no joy at the discovery; he had no desire to confront such a dangerous cultivator. Fortunately, the cold figure wasn't heading toward him but moving swiftly in another direction.

The figure moved in an odd, straight-line fashion. Switching the drone to night vision, Li Shiming could barely make out a dark shadow leaping between rooftops, scaling even the tallest buildings with ease. Its speed was such that without the aerial view, tracking it from the ground would have been impossible.

After a moment's hesitation, prioritizing his safety, Li Shiming left his courtyard. He maintained a considerable distance, relying on the drone to keep tabs on the shadow. As the figure approached the city wall, the thermal feed showed the blue silhouette merging with a red one before disappearing, leaving only the red signature moving away.

The rapid movement of both figures worked to the drone's advantage, allowing tracking before its battery depleted. The red signature eventually settled in a civilian house. Memorizing the location, Li Shiming positioned himself on the roof of a three-story wooden building a kilometer away. He retrieved the drone, replaced its battery, and relaunched it before observing the house through a monocular telescope.

The house appeared empty except for the single heat signature. Through the telescope, he saw the silhouette in the lit window before the light was extinguished, suggesting the person had gone to sleep. It was ironic—the terror of Zhongdu's rogue cultivators was living inconspicuously as a commoner in the city.

The building Li Shiming occupied was the famous Yue Lai Inn. He took out a 'Hundred-Mile Message Talisman', detailing his findings and his location, instructing Gu Jia to approach stealthily. After sending the talisman, he stowed his equipment.

Half a cup of tea later, Li Shiming sensed someone nearby. Turning, he saw Gu Jia and another man standing beside him, startling him—a rare feeling for a cultivator.

"Junior Li, are you certain you've found the corpse puppet master?" Gu Jia asked gravely, his expression serious yet tinged with concern that Li Shiming might be mistaken.

"I saw a figure pass near my residence and followed it. It merged with another figure before returning to that house," Li Shiming explained, pointing to the distant dwelling.

"You've got nerve for a second-level Qi Refining cultivator, tracking alone," the other man remarked coolly. Though Li Shiming couldn't sense any spiritual energy from him, an intimidating aura made him tread carefully.

"Esteemed Daoist, Brother Gu has helped me greatly. Since the corpse puppet master has caused him trouble, I felt obliged to assist when I had the chance," Li Shiming replied earnestly, puzzled by their delay in acting.

"Junior Li, mind your address—this is Elder Uncle," Gu Jia whispered urgently.

Li Shiming froze. 'Elder Uncle' implied a Foundation Establishment cultivator—Gu Jia's senior in their sect.

"Greetings, Elder. Please forgive my impropriety," Li Shiming said respectfully, not daring to claim kinship as he wasn't yet a disciple of Tianhai Sect.

"Not bad. Though I don't know your spiritual roots, reaching the peak of second-level Qi Refining at your age bodes well for sect entry," the Foundation Establishment cultivator said amiably. He had come specifically for the corpse puppet master and was pleased with Li Shiming's timely report and Gu Jia's recommendation.
