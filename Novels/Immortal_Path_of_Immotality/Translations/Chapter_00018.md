# Chapter 18: Black Lotus Envoy

Returning to his courtyard, Lin Shan eagerly opened the materials about the Yelang Ancient Tomb. The information provided by Nightingale was indeed detailed.

The records described how the Yelang Kingdom had been annihilated overnight by an unknown force a thousand years ago, with blood flowing for miles and not a blade of grass growing. Except for Yelang people living abroad, all natives were slaughtered. Later, the Yelang people returned to their homeland and built the ancient tomb, and the Yelang Kingdom gradually disappeared into the river of history.

A month ago, three waves of unknown forces had entered the tomb. The first wave consisted of ordinary people, the second included martial artists of the Houtian realm, and the third was even led by a first-class expert. Yet all three waves had perished—not a single person escaped.

At this point, Lin Shan couldn't help but gasp. Even a first-class expert had died inside! When he'd heard the account from Boss Wu's underling, he'd assumed the zombies in the tomb were like those in movies from his previous life—mutated by some man-made virus, highly infectious, something ordinary people couldn't handle but martial artists could easily defeat. But now, the records clearly stated that even first-class experts hadn't made it out alive. This truly frightened him.

The Nightingale's materials went further. As an ancient assassin organization, their intelligence personnel suspected that corpse transformation had occurred in the tomb and had specially prepared some records about such phenomena for their assassins:

"Seven hundred years ago, an earthquake struck Longnan. Green-haired corpses appeared in the mountains and were beaten to death by villagers with shovels."

"Five hundred years ago, floods in Weinan led to the emergence of water corpses in the Yellow River. Fishermen's nets were torn apart by them, but they were eventually restrained with iron nets and beaten to death with sticks."

"Two hundred and eighty years ago, a three-year drought in Jingxi caused the earth to crack, revealing drought corpses that killed dozens of villagers. Local heroes were powerless against them until an innate realm expert was invited to slay them."

"One hundred and twenty years ago, an ancient tomb in Zangke cracked open, releasing dozens of bronze-skinned iron corpses. The Southern Barbarian King had to mobilize hundreds of thousands of troops to suppress them, with over half the army perishing."

After reading this, Lin Shan frowned, his heart pounding. Some ordinary zombies could be easily killed by villagers, while the more formidable ones had bronze skin and iron bones, impervious to weapons, requiring massive armies to suppress—and even then with heavy casualties.

As he learned more, he realized that the zombies from a century ago in Zangke County had escaped from an ancient tomb, and now zombies had appeared in the Yelang Ancient Tomb. Both were tomb-dwelling corpses.

Could they be the same damn thing?

The more Lin Shan thought about it, the more he felt there might be a connection. Otherwise, why would a first-class expert vanish without even making a splash?

Stay calm!

Lin Shan forced himself to remain composed while silently reminding himself: "I'm just going into the tomb's secret passage to pick up some burial items dropped by tomb robbers. I'll grab whatever I find along the way and leave immediately. I won't venture deep into the chambers or provoke the ancient corpses. That way, I can complete the Nightingale's mission and might even gain some ancient aura."

"And once I obtain ancient aura, my strength and wealth will increase, bringing me closer to the golden bell."

"Once I get the golden bell, my ancient aura will skyrocket, propelling me to new heights."

A peculiar light shone in Lin Shan's eyes as he calculated the risks. The more he thought about it, the more he believed this venture wasn't entirely hopeless. With caution, there was still a chance of success.

Fortune favors the bold—let's do it!

"No time to waste. I'll set off immediately."

...

Three days later, Lin Shan arrived at Taoyuan Village, three hundred miles outside Zangke City. Before him stretched the endless mountains of Yelang.

Taoyuan Village nestled at the foot of Mount Yelang, surrounded by water—a picture of an earthly paradise.

While it was still daylight, Lin Shan entered the village. The blue stone-paved street was lined with cottages, complete with a blacksmith's shop and an herbal medicine hall. Farmers were returning from the fields, and smoke curled from chimneys as households prepared dinner.

Lin Shan went door to door asking for lodging but was repeatedly turned away. The reason? After the ancient tomb was discovered on Mount Yelang, waves of tomb robbers had passed through the village. The superstitious villagers blamed these outsiders for disturbing the mountain deities by digging up the tomb, leading to the subsequent punishment of the robbers. Thus, they were unwilling to take him in.

Left with no choice, Lin Shan resorted to his ancestral trump card—the "power of money."

The next household happily welcomed him inside.

This trick never failed—it worked in every world.

It's not that I betrayed my principles—he just offered too much!

...

Night fell. After dinner, Lin Shan stood in the rural courtyard, counting the stars. By chance, he noticed a small room beside the yard housing a black lotus Buddha statue.

He immediately recalled what the vendor in the antique market had told him—Taoyuan Village had many black lotus Buddha statues.

Entering the room, he found it small and simple, containing only a meditation cushion, an altar, the Buddha statue, and candles. The incense seemed to have long ceased burning.

Lin Shan reached out to touch the one-foot-tall statue. As expected, there was no ancient aura. The vendor's collected statues had none either—likely all fakes.

Just as he turned around, the homeowner passed by. Lin Shan quickly stopped him and asked, "Elder, what is this statue in your house?" He pointed at the black lotus Buddha.

"Oh, that's the Sacred Guardian Statue of the Black Lotus Sect. Most villagers worship him. I'm just a casual believer, so I keep it around for fun."

Lin Shan: "..."

Since when were village elders so open-minded? Maybe this old man was the only odd one out, and he just happened to run into him?

But since it concerned ancient aura, Lin Shan shamelessly pressed further: "Does every household in the village have this statue? How long have they been worshiping it?"

Old Man Liu answered casually, "Almost every household has one. It's been that way for a few hundred years."

Lin Shan's heart stirred. That meant some families might have century-old black lotus statues passed down through generations.

"But every twenty years, a Black Lotus Envoy descends from Mount Yelang. They take away the statues we worship and give each household a new one. We're all used to it now."

What the hell?!

Lin Shan trembled with rage. Someone had beaten him to it?

Damn Black Lotus Envoy! I swear eternal enmity with you!

Old Man Liu watched the twitching young man in confusion, shook his head, and returned to his room.

"Black Lotus Sect... Black Lotus Envoy..."

Lin Shan's gaze turned profound as he looked toward distant Mount Yelang. Another potential lead on ancient aura—it seemed he had no choice but to go.

...

The third watch of the night. The moon was bright, the stars sparse.

Fully armed, Lin Shan carried a ring-pommeled sword on his back, a newly purchased dagger at his waist, and concealed arrows in his sleeves. His pack contained a fire starter, sulfur, grappling hooks, and a gourd of black dog's blood.

In his hand was a cage holding a rooster he'd just bought from the village. 

The tomb's passages were perilous, so a live decoy was necessary. The rooster, bound tightly with its beak wrapped in cloth, shivered in the cage.

Lin Shan had spent nearly all his savings for this all-or-nothing venture.

"Hope everything goes smoothly..."

...

Under the cover of dusk, Lin Shan entered Mount Yelang.

The mountain path was rugged, but the Nightingale's materials included a map. The Yelang Ancient Tomb was located halfway up the mountain's backside.

Carefully avoiding animal droppings, Lin Shan followed the map and crossed the mountain without incident.

By the fifth watch, the forest was alive with eerie sounds—wolves howling, ghosts wailing.

Armed to the teeth, Lin Shan remained unfazed. From the mountain peak, he identified his target location and made his way to the mountainside, stopping before a cave entrance.

...

"This is the damn tunnel dug by Boss Wu's five underlings?"

Lin Shan stared at the cave, which was easily twice a man's height. If not for the map's markings, he'd have thought it was the den of some beast!

No wonder they managed to haul out that giant Buddha statue and golden bell. Such talent—what a shame they couldn't be of use to him now.

Sighing, Lin Shan took a deep breath, lit his fire starter, and blew on it gently.

Then he stepped slowly into the cave.
