# Chapter 102: Pondering the "Wondrous Art of Karmic Fire Red Lotus," and the Question of Dishes Made with Celestial Fluid

At the same time.

Inside the hotpot restaurant under the bright moonlight.

"You... are about to break through again?"

Li Mo quietly opened his eyes.

The circulation of two-colored internal energy cast a peculiar luster over the girl's jade-like face, making her cold and enchanting aura surprisingly harmonious at this moment.

In fact, over the past couple of days, he had already sensed it—the Ice Cube's internal energy was becoming more condensed by the day.

He just didn't expect the day to come so soon.

Ying Bing opened her eyes, looking at him silently.

"......" Ying Bing.

"......" Li Mo.

The two fell silent.

The chill grew increasingly piercing.

In Li Mo's perception.

His internal energy could no longer achieve balance with Ying Bing's.

Because the Ice Cube had already begun to condense her energy into liquid.

"Focus on your breakthrough."

First floor.

Zuoqiu Yang and Xiao Qin were both startled by the commotion from upstairs.

"She..."

"Yes, she's condensing her liquid."

Li Mo nodded.

"This..." Zuoqiu Yang opened his mouth, at a loss for words.

She was only sixteen.

Xiao Qin felt a bitter taste rise from the root of his tongue.

He had only just stabilized his internal energy in the Qi Condensation realm and hadn't even touched the threshold of the Jade Liquid realm yet.

This was with the guidance of a master and the consumption of many pills to enhance his internal energy.

What about Senior Sister Ying Bing?

He hadn't even seen her practice much...

"Disciple, the gap between people is sometimes greater than the gap between people and dogs."

"The gap between you and the prodigies of the Central Continent is the same as the gap between those prodigies and her."

The Thousand Forms Martial Venerate seemed to have just snapped out of his daze, sighing with emotion.

Xiao Qin was speechless for a moment, then turned his head after a pause:

"Brother Li... you..."

"I'm also at the peak of Qi Condensation."

Li Mo smiled.

When dual-cultivating, the internal energies must be able to balance; they cannot be too far apart.

So he had been deliberately controlling his progress to accumulate investment.

Xiao Qin: "....."

Old Xiao felt a bit depressed.

When they first met, Junior Brother Li had just opened his meridians, and now he had already surpassed him.

The Thousand Forms Martial Venerate consoled him in a deep voice:

"When your master first entered the martial path, I was no match for those prodigies of the Central Continent."

"If you reach the Observation realm and can reach the pinnacle of the 'Thousand Forms诀', you might be able to catch up to them."

"Hmm!"

Xiao Qin shook the frost from his eyebrows, his gaze once again becoming firm.

He knew that the Thousand Forms诀 his master spoke of was a divine skill.

Every divine skill possesses the power to seize the creations of heaven and earth.

*Hum—*

At that moment, a familiar domain descended.

Confining the surging cold tide within the hotpot restaurant.

It was Shang Wu.

With her intervention, Zuoqiu Yang and Xiao Qin finally felt a bit better.

The commotion of the breakthrough was thus contained without leaking out.

"The ingredients in the kitchen are saved."

Zuoqiu Yang sighed in relief.

Xiao Qin looked towards the east, fell silent for a moment, and said, "Tomorrow, we probably won't need to open for business."

Li Mo also nodded.

Zuoqiu Yang was taken aback.

Following the direction of Li Mo's finger, he saw a firework explode in the city, forming a pattern—the signature "Hall Front Swallow" of the Drizzle Pavilion.

The Trial of Nihility had ended.

Tomorrow, they would head to the Lingjiang Dock as agreed.

To kill Smiling Maitreya.

Ying Bing's breakthrough undoubtedly added another layer of assurance to their plan for a swift kill.

The three discussed the specific plan before returning to rest and make their final preparations.

---

"It seems I can't go back to my room to sleep tonight."

Li Mo shook his head and sat down on the floor.

His consciousness sank.

In his Dantian, it was now filled with red internal energy, the destructive aura reaching a critical point.

He tried to condense his internal energy into liquid, just as Ying Bing had done.

A quarter of an hour later.

*Boom—*

Li Mo's face flushed, and he sucked in a sharp breath.

It exploded.

Just now.

The condensed internal energy erupted during the compression process and diffused once more.

His internal energy, imbued with the purest intent of destruction, could not be condensed into liquid.

Little Li fell into deep thought.

Ying Bing's constitution was completely different from his; the path she took to condense her internal energy might not be suitable for him.

Undoubtedly, the martial art above that divine skill was extraordinary.

Yet, since obtaining it, he knew very little about it, only using it in the most superficial way.

This shouldn't be.

[20 years of martial arts insight infusion successful.]

Having saved up for a long time, Little Li was now wealthy and could infuse generously.

[You recalled the scene the lotus petal led you into, you pondered the origin of this martial art, and you finally realized that if not for dual-cultivating with Ying Bing, you wouldn't even have been able to achieve perfection in Qi Condensation.]

[20 years passed in a flash.]

[However, that spark of insight wasn't clear, only allowing you to vaguely know the name of the martial art.]

[Wondrous Art of Karmic Fire Red Lotus]

.....

".....Huh?"

"Twenty years for just that?"

Li Mo was somewhat speechless. His talent in mental techniques wasn't considered foolish, at least much better than in swordsmanship.

Yet, twenty years of time, poured into this martial art, only resulted in knowing its name.

It could only mean that the Wondrous Art of Karmic Fire Red Lotus was too vast and profound.

Giving up halfway was not an option.

Martial arts insights flowed in like water.

[In the 36th year, you finally understood that within that spark of insight lay the principle that extremes must reverse. If it did not contain life, how could the Karmic Fire Red Lotus be born?]

[In the 80th year, you exhausted your efforts, attempting to use extreme destruction to spawn that thread of life.]

[In the 200th year, you finally succeeded; the lotus seed showed signs of sprouting.]

[In the 365th year, your Wondrous Art of Karmic Fire Red Lotus reached the入门 (Initial Proficiency) stage.]

Initial Proficiency.

Li Mo's martial arts insights were now only a pitifully small portion left, barely a hundred years, which finally allowed him to入门 (enter the door) of this martial art.

This could no longer be called a 'martial art.'

It was completely a celestial technique.

Using extreme destruction to give birth to life, to spawn the Karmic Fire Red Lotus.

"I wonder what it will be like when it reaches the Transformation realm, or even the Perfection realm."

Little Li felt a bit of anticipation when thinking about it.

But reason told him he couldn't continue this deduction. The remaining martial arts insights, if poured in further, wouldn't even make a splash.

Silently closing his eyes, he began to refine the lotus seeds within his thirty-six main meridians.

The wondrous scenery of Harmony between Man and Nature once again appeared around him.

In the room, Xiao Qin couldn't help but open his eyes and look outside.

The Thousand Forms Martial Venerate sighed, saying something to him. Xiao Qin took a deep breath and practiced even more diligently.

Upstairs.

The fluctuation of the breakthrough's aura slowly dissipated.

Ying Bing seemed to have changed, yet perhaps not, still possessing that ice-skin and jade-bone.

She walked to the window, and the sight of the少年 (young man) practicing appeared in her eyes.

The words that surfaced in her heart were exactly what the Thousand Forms Martial Venerate had said.

Someday, when Li Mo enters the Inner Scene, he will be very strong.

Those who can achieve Harmony between Man and Nature are all outstanding figures within the Inner Scene.

Of course, this also depends on his accumulation in the Observation realm.

As for herself, she walked a path that supplemented by observing the forms of various birds, primarily observing the Great Yin (Moon).

This was a path that the elders of the Clear Abyss Sect, and even上官聞蒼 (Shangguan Wencang), had not anticipated.

Using the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix Soul to gather the Great Yin Moon Phoenix Spirit.

Of course, this was not a path that could be completed before the next ranking list.

To reclaim the top spot on the ranking list, she could only lead in cultivation level first.

With the stage reward of Celestial Fluid, this should be achievable.

Three bottles... should be more than enough?

"Is there any dish that can be made with Celestial Fluid..."
