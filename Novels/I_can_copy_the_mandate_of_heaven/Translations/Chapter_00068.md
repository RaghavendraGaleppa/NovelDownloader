# Chapter 68: Sincerity

The night was bitterly cold, and the darkness seemed to seep into one's bones. Li Zhiming, clad in a long, black robe, strolled back to the grand hall, where he found Xi Jia already waiting for him. The young lady had grown tall and slender over the years, no longer the petite girl she once was. Li Zhiming, on the other hand, had grown into a tall and handsome young man, although not as muscular as the martial practitioners.

Xi Jia, despite her own growth spurt, still didn't quite match Li Zhiming's height. Her slender bones now framed a more refined and elegant appearance.

"Xi Jia, what brings you here?" Li Zhiming asked.

"Tomorrow is your coming-of-age ceremony, young master. I thought you shouldn't be so hasty. I've prepared a bath for you, and I'll wash your hair as well," Xi Jia replied.

Li Zhiming agreed, and Xi Jia busied herself preparing the bath. The warm chamber was filled with the misty vapor rising from the wooden tub, and the air was thick with the scent of fragrant soap.

As Li Zhiming entered the warm chamber, he felt a bit shy, but he tried to composed himself. "Xi Jia, you can leave now," he said, his hand on the collar of his robe.

However, Xi Jia stood firm, her expression serious. "I'm your servant, young master. It's my duty to attend to you. I won't leave."

Li Zhiming hesitated, but eventually, he began to undress, and Xi Jia assisted him. As he stepped into the tub, he didn't notice the subtle smile on Xi Jia's face or the hint of affection in her eyes.

Xi Jia carefully washed Li Zhiming's hair and body, and he eventually relaxed, even dozing off in the tub. Xi Jia monitored the water temperature, adding hot water as needed.

After the bath, Xi Jia helped Li Zhiming dry off and dressed him in a new, elegant outfit. "This is the attire the sect leader sent over. You'll need to look your best for the coming-of-age ceremony tomorrow," she explained.

The outfit was exquisite, made from fine silk, and it fit Li Zhiming perfectly. As he gazed into the large, full-body copper mirror, he was taken aback by his own reflection. He looked dashing, with a strong jawline and piercing features.

As he admired himself, Xi Jia approached him from behind, her arms wrapping around his waist. "You're truly handsome, young master. You'll need to take care of us sisters in the future," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Li Zhiming felt a surge of emotions as he turned to face Xi Jia. Her face was flushed, and her eyes shone with affection. For a moment, they locked gazes, the tension between them palpable.

In that instant, Li Zhiming understood the intentions behind Meng Wei's decision to send the Jiang sisters to his side. He felt a flutter in his chest as he gazed at Xi Jia, her skin as white as snow, her lips inviting.

The tranquility of the valley, the companionship of the four of them, it was a life that was hard to resist. Li Zhiming's thoughts drifted to the future, and he felt a sense of contentment.

As he turned to face Xi Jia, she became flustered, her eyes darting away. "I-I'll go now..." she stuttered, before hastily retreating from the warm chamber.

Li Zhiming watched her go, his voice soft as he called out, "Be careful."

As Xi Jia disappeared from view, Li Zhiming was left standing alone in the warm chamber, his emotions in turmoil. The night air was filled with the chirping of cicadas, and the vast expanse of the world seemed to stretch out before him, full of possibilities.

In that moment, Li Zhiming felt a sense of uncertainty, as if the fate that lay ahead of him was still unfolding. The tranquility of the valley, the affection of the Jiang sisters, it was a life that was both captivating and unsettling.
