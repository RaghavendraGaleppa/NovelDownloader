# Chapter 17: Yin-Fire Thunder

“Next!” Lu Xu said in a deep voice.

“Can’t tell you’re such a kind-hearted fellow cultivator!” The old woman sneered, continuing her introduction.

What followed truly broadened Lu Xu’s horizons. There were secret artifacts that required sacrificing one’s closest kin to activate, and venomous insects that needed to be fed with one’s own essence blood for years. All sorts of heretical and demonic path magical artifacts emerged one after another, each more horrifying than the last.

These items shared a common characteristic: immense power. Lu Xu finally understood why Wei State and its surrounding nations strictly prohibited demonic sects and forces, always launching full-scale extermination campaigns upon discovery.

“What’s in here?” Lu Xu asked, pointing to a jade box.

The old woman cackled, opening the jade box to reveal a walnut-sized object, dark green all over. The item lay quietly in the box, but the moment Lu Xu saw it, he immediately felt an intense sense of danger.

“This is Yin-Fire Thunder!”

“Bury the remains of a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator in an area rich in Yin energy. Ten years later, ghost fire will condense on their bones. Collect this ghost fire and refine it with special techniques, and you can create this Yin-Fire Thunder!”

“This thunder possesses immense power; even a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator will suffer heavy injuries if they’re not careful!”

Finally hearing about something somewhat normal, Lu Xu felt a sense of relief and asked in a deep voice, “How many spirit stones?”

“Three hundred spirit stones per piece!” The old woman let out a strange laugh, extending three fingers.

“That expensive?”

“Expensive, you say? Refining one of these thunders requires at least nine late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator corpses!”

“Besides, I only have one here, and it just arrived not long ago. If you think it’s expensive now, you might not be able to buy it next time you come!”

Lu Xu was already tempted, but he still put on a hesitant expression. Seeing this, the old woman struck while the iron was hot and added a few more persuasive words. Lu Xu deliberated for a long time, eventually feigning being convinced by her, stamping his foot as he said, “I’ll take this Yin-Fire Thunder!”

Walking along the market street, Lu Xu recalled the eerie atmosphere in that small shop and couldn’t help but sigh at the endless devious methods of these demonic cultivators. All sorts of unconventional techniques emerged one after another; some utterly vile magical artifacts could even allow an early-stage Qi Condensation cultivator to injure a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator. It was rumored that the demonic path also offered various plundering methods to rapidly increase cultivation, providing opportunities for advancement even to those with poor aptitudes.

“Sounds wonderful, but is there really no cost?” Lu Xu sighed inwardly. He kept his distance from such paths. Taking a dangerous shortcut inevitably came with a price; otherwise, everyone would follow it.

Lu Xu possessed the Azure Stone Stele; this was his clear, broad path. With such a road available, he would never choose a treacherous single-plank bridge. Regardless, with this Yin-Fire Thunder, his safety was immediately greatly assured. It was a trump card that would surely produce unexpected results at critical moments.

“I only wish to cultivate steadily and safely, and preferably for no one to bother me, otherwise…”

Time slowly flowed. Since Lu Xu broke through to the third level of Qi Condensation, another three years passed in the blink of an eye. After such a long time, the ripples caused by He Qing’s death among the low-level cultivators gradually subsided. Since then, no more poor and weak cultivators like him had been killed by rogue cultivators. Thus, everyone in the market city finally relaxed.

“Sure enough, that was an accident. Rogue cultivators don’t care for people like us!”

“No need to be constantly on edge anymore. These past three years of high tension every day made life difficult!”

Such sentiments spread among the low-level cultivators, and everyone gradually resumed their normal lives. Lu Xu’s side was also peaceful; he didn’t encounter any danger. The Yin-Fire Thunder he purchased hadn’t even been used.

“It seems the Mo family’s patrol team is quite effective in deterring rogue cultivators!” Lu Xu thought, looking at the vast green fields before him. This place was peaceful and serene, completely unaffected by the notorious rogue cultivators who had caused so much uproar in the city.

“I’ll be able to break through to the fourth level of Qi Condensation soon. I hope things can remain this stable!” Lu Xu wished.

However, it wasn’t long before an event shattered his peaceful life.

“Little Lu, in three days, our Mo family will gather some young cultivators from the market city. You and that kid Han should come too!”

“Steward Mo, this is…” Lu Xu looked astonished.

“It’s just a gathering, and it’ll be a good thing for you all!” Steward Mo, the fat man, smiled mysteriously and ambiguously, patted Lu Xu’s shoulder, and left.

Lu Xu was utterly bewildered. After pondering for a while, he decided to ask Old Xu about it.

“A gathering? It’s no big deal, the Mo family holds one every ten years!” Old Xu’s expression was normal, unconcerned.

“What does the Mo family want to do?” Lu Xu asked, full of doubt. He didn’t believe the Mo family would gather young cultivators for no reason; there must be some purpose.

Old Xu chuckled, “As for a purpose, there certainly is. The Mo family is going to do something that certain fellows are quite interested in!”

“Something certain fellows are interested in?” Lu Xu fell into thought.

Old Xu then reminded him, “The Mo family gathers young men no older than thirty-five, with spiritual root grades of at least lower-superior. Many Mo family women will also be present then!”

With that hint, Lu Xu started to understand. “Is this a matchmaking event?”

“Heh!” Old Xu let out a meaningful snicker, “Mainly, the Mo family wants to find live-in sons-in-law. They want to use this method to win over as many talented individuals as possible for their own family!”

“That’s a very clever approach!” Lu Xu commented. In terms of spiritual roots, there was a common rule in the cultivation world: the higher the spiritual root grade and cultivation level, the better the children’s aptitude tended to be. By taking in people with good spiritual root aptitudes through marriage, the Mo family would inevitably create a cumulative effect over time. The aptitude of Mo family disciples would improve with each generation.

“The Mo family has always been clever in this regard!” Old Xu said, nodding meaningfully. Lu Xu felt that Old Xu had more to say, but when he asked a couple of questions, the other party refused to elaborate.

So he recalled his early days in Green Lake Market City. His middle-lower grade spiritual root was considered decent, and at that time, the Mo family’s Immortal Envoy had advised him to join the Mo family as a live-in son-in-law. This person had described various benefits of being a Mo family live-in son-in-law. However, at that time, Lu Xu hadn’t yet experienced the hardships of low-level cultivators and had no concept of the conditions offered by the Mo family. So, he politely declined.

Of course, he had another reason for refusing. Thanks to the pervasive anti-fraud campaigns in his previous life, Lu Xu had always been wary of things that were advertised as overly wonderful. He didn’t believe in such good fortunes falling from the sky, so he didn’t dare to agree.

After some thought, Lu Xu still tried to subtly inquire from Old Xu: “Old Xu, over the years, the Mo family must have recruited quite a few live-in sons-in-law, right?”

“Of course. The Mo family has over a hundred live-in sons-in-law!” Old Xu nodded.

“Among them, how many have entered the late-stage Qi Condensation?” Lu Xu asked again.

Hearing this, Old Xu gave him a deep look, then chuckled, “None. Not a single one!”
