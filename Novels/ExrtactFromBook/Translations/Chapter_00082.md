# Chapter 82: Shangxi Summons Thunder

Beyond the "Sword Light Division," among the thirty-six supreme divine abilities, several others would greatly benefit Han Yue. He only needed to wait until his advancement to the second rank before immediately finding a way to exchange and diligently cultivate them until they were recorded in the "Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws."

However, the "Examination of Divine Abilities" repeatedly emphasized that cultivators should focus on their foundational cultivation and not become overly enamored with the power of divine abilities, neglecting the practice of their inherited great methods. The divine ability talismans formed by supreme divine abilities were condensations of a cultivator's mana, will, and insights into the Great Dao. They served as crucial supports for advancing to the third rank through refining qi into spirit.

According to research by the True Person Chuanzong, mastering three or more supreme divine abilities at the Golden Core realm was sufficient to advance to the third rank, while five Great Dao divine ability talismans ensured a perfect advancement. There was no need to greedily pursue more, wasting excessive time at the second rank to cultivate multiple supreme divine abilities.

Han Yue carefully examined his progress in the "Nourishing Spirit Thunder Method." After three years of cultivation, this foundational method had shown significant improvement. With much of his focus shifted to practicing divine abilities and studying texts, Han Yue could condense one nourishing thunder rune approximately every ten days. Over these three years, his "Nourishing Spirit Thunder Method" had reached the second great perfection with an additional one hundred and forty nourishing thunder runes. Though still far from the third great perfection, his mana continued to grow steadily.

The "Nourishing Soul Banner" within Han Yue's sea of consciousness regulated his mana flow and strengthened his spirit. After three years of refinement, the banner formed by the nourishing thunder runes had become increasingly intricate, almost as if it had a physical form. Meanwhile, Han Yue's sea of consciousness and divine sense continued to grow steadily under the banner's enhancement, fostering a calm and stable Dao heart.

Five days had passed since the three-year deadline Han Yue had agreed upon with Li Changle. He believed he had met his master's requirements—his divine abilities had all been mastered to an initial level, and he had thoroughly studied various texts, greatly expanding his knowledge. According to True Person Chuanzong, Han Yue was now fully prepared in terms of divine abilities and knowledge for refining essence into qi. All that remained was to accumulate mana, nourish his essence, and seek the elusive opportunity to form his Golden Core.

With the primordial qi supplied by the "Heavenly Origin Treasure Emperor Lotus" and the abundant primordial qi within the Shenxiao Palace sect, Han Yue lacked no source of energy. However, the speed at which he condensed nourishing thunder runes had reached a bottleneck. Without resorting to other special methods, he could no longer accelerate his mana accumulation.

Han Yue simply waited for Li Changle to emerge from seclusion to see what method his master had prepared for him. Just as he was deep in cultivation, a faint dragon's roar penetrated the cave's door and reached his ears. He immediately ceased his practice and stepped onto the platform outside his cave.

The dragon's roar was delicate yet prolonged, resembling a song, wind and rain, or the passage of time. Though faint, it carried an undeniable power. Han Yue quickly recognized it as originating from the true form of True Person Chuanzong atop Feilai Peak—one of the methods the True Person used to summon disciples.

Following the sound, Han Yue hurried toward the dragon's head. Before long, he spotted Wang Mumu riding his eagle, also taking flight. From Canglang Peak opposite, dozens of streaks of light soared into the sky. All Shenxiao Palace disciples, summoned by the True Person, gathered at the Dragon Head Plaza on Feilai Peak.

This was Han Yue's first time meeting his fellow disciples in person. Looking around, he saw men and women of all ages, each distinguished in appearance and bearing. True Persons Chuanzong, Shangxi, and Li Changle stood at the forefront, awaiting the disciples' arrival.

Once everyone had assembled, Shangxi spoke first:  
"Disciples, hear me. My achievements within the Jade Sky Realm are now complete. Soon, I shall venture beyond the void to follow the path of our Shenxiao Palace ancestors. Today, before True Person Chuanzong and all disciples, I declare that Tianyun of the Tian generation, profound in the Dao and virtuous in conduct, shall succeed me as sect master, inheriting the legacy of Shenxiao Palace."

The gathering had been called for the transfer of leadership. Yet, Shenxiao Palace handled this momentous occasion with startling simplicity—no ceremony, no fanfare, no guests. Nevertheless, none present, including Han Yue, voiced any objection, as if this were the natural way of things.

Chuanzong then added:  
"Today, we gather for three purposes. First, to witness the succession of our sect master. Second, to celebrate True Person Shangxi's liberation from worldly bonds and return to the void. Third, before his departure, True Person Shangxi will perform one final demonstration of the Dao. All disciples must observe carefully."

Yuanzhen, the most advanced among the disciples, led the assembly in bowing three times to Shangxi, expressing gratitude for his service as sect master and wishing him success on his journey beyond the void. Shangxi accepted graciously, gazing at the disciples he had personally brought into the sect with deep emotion.

For those present, this farewell marked an eternal parting—they would never meet again in this lifetime. Yet, after a millennium of existence, Shangxi had long grown accustomed to life's separations. Each disciple had their own destiny; their future growth now rested in Tianyun's hands.

With that, Shangxi rose into the air, unleashing his unrestrained fourth-rank mana. Instantly, the majesty of a Longevity True Person was fully revealed, stirring a tempest of power as vast as the abyss. The disciples on the plaza were tossed like straw in a gale, unable to remain standing. Only Tianyun and Yuanzhen, with their third-rank cultivation, could barely withstand the force.

Han Yue activated his Thread Armor to its limits, summoning a massive "Primordial Great Hand Seal" to anchor himself. Even so, he was blown to the plaza's edge, barely managing to steady himself against a wall. Without employing any divine ability, Shangxi's mere presence allowed the disciples to truly comprehend the might of a Longevity True Person.

In the sky, Shangxi spoke again, his voice infused with immense power and profound Dao resonance, imprinting upon every disciple's mind:  
"For my disciples, I demonstrate: Thunder, too, is the Dao of Life!"

As his words faded, infinite lightning was summoned from the void. Rivers of thunder intertwined across the clear sky, each composed of fourth-rank mana—bearing destruction, terror, and boundlessness. The tempest spanned ten thousand miles, shaking the heavens. When the lightning reached its zenith, Shangxi raised his hand and brought it crashing down upon a corner of Dragon Head Plaza.

The strike left every disciple's mind blank, their vision seared white.
