**Chapter 112: I'm Going to Kill Them All**

Rumbling!

Amidst a series of thunderous explosions echoing across the sky, a streak of light sped through the air, with dozens of similar streaks hot on its heels.

Within the fleeing light ahead, a black-robed, grim-faced young man gritted his teeth, constantly urging on a spirit treasure in his hand. This treasure, named the "Void-Piercing Sky-Shuttling Dark Weave," could multiply his escape light's speed several times over and even allowed for short-distance void travel.

This person was none other than Qin Tianhe, a True Disciple of the Sacred Sect!

However, Qin Tianhe's current state was utterly wretched. If not for the "Void-Piercing Sky-Shuttling Dark Weave" in his hand, he would likely be nothing but dust by now.

Behind him, a group of Buddhist cultivators gave chase.

"These shameless bald donkeys, they definitely cheated!" Qin Tianhe cursed incessantly as he ran, clearly sensing something amiss. The Buddhist cultivators' assembly speed and tracking precision were simply too abnormal. No matter how he concealed his aura, these Buddhist cultivators could always find him with pinpoint accuracy.

Of course, he had tried to turn around and counterattack, but the group of Buddhist cultivators pursuing him were clearly not pushovers. They were all proficient in combined attack techniques. Though the leader was not as strong as him, they were only slightly weaker. In such a situation, fighting alone was impossible. So, Qin Tianhe could only curse at his pursuers while accelerating his escape.

"Benefactor, your karmic destiny has arrived." Behind Qin Tianhe, a Buddhist cultivator pressed his palms together, his voice booming like thunder: "My Dragon Subduing Temple is in need of followers. You could become a protector of my temple."

"The Demonic Sect uses humans as resources, commits countless evils, disregards merits, disrespects karma, and is rife with sin – it is not a place for pure cultivation... Benefactor, if you could abandon darkness for light, join the Pure Land, and thenceforth convert to the righteous path, listening to the World Honored One's supreme profound dharma, wouldn't that be far better? Why suffer in that Demonic Gate?"

"...Amitabha!"

In an instant, over a dozen Buddhist cultivators echoed in unison. Amidst the rolling thunderous sounds, even scriptures were intertwined, causing Qin Tianhe's head to throb with pain, as if something was drilling into his sea of consciousness.

"They want to convert me!?" Qin Tianhe's face turned ashen. He roused his true qi, suppressing the Buddhist chants in his ears while accelerating his flight further into the distance.

Seeing this, the leading Buddhist cultivator immediately frowned. At the same time, another Buddhist cultivator stepped forward, whispering, "Senior Brother Guangming, this person is extremely skilled at escaping. He doesn't seem easy to capture."

Guangming shook his head: "Junior Brother, you may not know, but Master's Dragon Subduing Temple is in need of followers. Otherwise, we wouldn't have been sent to participate in this Path Contention Battle. The purpose is to seize this opportunity to convert as many outsiders as possible to fill the Dragon Subduing Temple. Otherwise, how can we improve?"

"This person's methods are extraordinary; he is clearly a True Disciple of the Demonic Gate."

"Therefore, the harder he is to catch, the more we must capture him! On the battlefield of righteousness and evil, even if we truly capture a Sacred Sect True Disciple, the Bodhisattva will protect us."

"Continue, chase him!" Guangming was the leader of this group of Buddhist cultivators. Since he had spoken, the others naturally dared not voice any objections and immediately pursued Qin Tianhe.

Similar events were unfolding across various parts of the Boundary Heaven. However, Sacred Sect disciples varied in strength. Strong ones were True Disciples like Qin Tianhe, while weaker ones were only in the late Qi Condensation stage. Thus, their outcomes also varied. Some fiercely counterattacked and killed their pursuers. Some, after being besieged, fought to exhaustion and died. Some, seeing no escape, directly self-detonated, perishing with their enemies.

However, no matter the outcome, the Sacred Sect had their positions locked down in advance, were ambushed, and fought outnumbered. Their losses were ultimately significantly greater than those of the Dao Court and the Pure Land.

On a stretch of wilderness, sword light shimmered brightly.

Clang—!

As a magic sword descended, the void rippled open, and then a tall, spirited woman emerged, holding a severed head in her hand.

"Fairy Miaozhen, truly living up to her reputation!" Below, Wang Jinting, from the Dao Court, clapped his hands and laughed: "This Demonic Gate True Disciple's magic power was not bad. If not for the Fairy's intervention, he might have been difficult to capture."

"Mere devils, not worth a single blow," the tall woman said coldly: "My divine abilities are now perfected, and I seek to form my Foundation. I am about to challenge all under heaven with my sword. For these devils to become sacrifices for my sword is a death well-deserved."

Outside the Boundary Heaven, three True Monarchs sat in a circle, their Dharma Bodies towering to the sky, their gazes cast downwards. All changes within the Boundary Heaven could not escape their divine eyes.

Just then, one of the Dharma Bodies suddenly burst into laughter: "Qingcheng, it seems we've taken the lead this time!"

"Amitabha..." Another Dharma Body chanted a Buddhist name. Though he said no more, his meaning was self-evident, clearly believing that his side already held the advantage.

One must know that they had come prepared this time. Not only were the two fruit-status treasures they prepared highly targeted, creating a situation where a smaller force could overwhelm a larger one through ambushes and encirclements, but they also specifically invited a True Disciple from the Sword Pavilion to join as an external aid, filling the gap in high-end combat power. It could be said they had put in considerable effort.

Naturally, the results were very satisfying to them. What a wonderful start!

However, facing the mockery of the two True Monarchs from the Dao Court and the Pure Land, True Monarch Qingcheng Feixue, who hailed from the Sacred Sect, remained incredibly calm, seemingly entirely unconcerned by the disadvantage. Seeing her demeanor, the two True Monarchs instead frowned.

*Could there be a problem?*

The Demonic Gate's actions were ruthless and cunning; both Jiangdong and Jiangxi had experienced this deeply. True Monarch Qingcheng Feixue's calmness was truly unsettling.

*'But no matter what, this time it's a joint effort of three parties to collectively suppress the Demonic Dao.'*

*'The advantage is mine!'*

Inside the Boundary Heaven, a fierce look gradually appeared on Qin Tianhe's face. He had been running for a full half-hour, and his true qi was quickly running low. However, behind him, Guangming and his group of Buddhist cultivators still pursued relentlessly. The escape lights of over a dozen people had even merged into a dazzling golden dragon shape. He recognized it; that was a divine ability of the Eightfold Buddhist Masses of the Pure Land of Profound Joy, likely belonging to the [Dragonkin]—not an ordinary technique among Buddhist cultivators.

What made Qin Tianhe even more despairing was that he had vaguely guessed Guangming's intention.

"These bald donkeys... are using me as bait!" Qin Tianhe gritted his teeth. In truth, Guangming and the others could have caught up and killed him long ago, yet they had consistently reeled him in, maintaining a posture of pursuit. Were they trying to see if anyone would come to save him?

Thinking of this, Qin Tianhe suddenly felt like laughing. What did these bald donkeys take the Sacred Sect for? A group of great philanthropists who cared for their comrades and sacrificed themselves for others? Rather than hoping for someone to rescue him, it was more realistic to hope he could actively find a few Sacred Sect disciples to use as human shields. In fact, Qin Tianhe had already planned to do just that.

As the saying goes, 'better a dead comrade than a dead me'. As a Sacred Sect disciple, on major issues like 'my death or someone else's death', they always distinguished very clearly—

However, just then, a whistling sound suddenly echoed from the sky.

"What... is that?"

"It seems to be another devil from Jiangbei!"

Guangming and Qin Tianhe looked up almost simultaneously, expressions of joy on their faces. The former was happy because there was a new prey; the latter, because there was now a scapegoat.

Boom!

The next second, a streak of escape light descended from the sky like a fiery meteoric lightning bolt, emitting thunderous roars wherever it passed, only to abruptly split apart upon landing. Immediately after, Lu Yang strode out from within, his body wreathed in sword rainbows piercing the sky, drawing in spiritual tides from all directions.

The moment Qin Tianhe saw him, he instantly froze in place.

With such imposing momentum, Guangming's heart also subtly trembled. He didn't rush forward but stopped, saying in a deep voice, "Benefactor, may I ask where you hail from—"

Swish—!

The sword pellet roared, flashing past in an instant!

Lu Yang couldn't be bothered to answer. He raised his sword and struck. The Buddhist cultivator standing at the very front immediately circulated his cultivation art, conjuring a sturdy golden body. This was a common tactic for the Pure Land during group battles: first, a Buddhist cultivator who had cultivated a golden body and possessed numerous life-saving methods would stand at the forefront. Then, other Buddhist cultivators would unleash their divine abilities from behind, supplemented by formation enchantments, much like a mobile fortress, capable of both offense and defense.

Therefore, when Lu Yang made his move, the group of Buddhist cultivators immediately responded as usual.

"I'll hold him, you all—" The Buddhist cultivator who had stepped forward to confront Lu Yang had his voice cut off in his throat before he could finish speaking, and then his vision spun wildly.

"...Huh?"

His golden body had been refined over several decades; generally speaking, even a high-grade magic treasure couldn't easily pierce it. Yet now, it seemed as flimsy as paper.

A single sword strike decapitated him!

Lu Yang's expression was calm. He didn't know that the Pure Land and the Dao Court had already allied, nor did he know that the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion had sent an acquaintance as an external aid to participate in this battle.

With the True Monarchs above, he only knew one thing: he was going to start a massacre!

The force of his sword swings, the height of his raised hand, the precision of his spells, the speed of his pursuit—only by going all out could he show the Sacred Sect True Monarchs his resolve!
