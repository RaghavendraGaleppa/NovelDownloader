# Chapter 22: The Talisman Master Friend  

Three months later, at Wei Qian's residence.  

After swallowing the last Huangya Pill and refining its medicinal power, Wei Qian finally opened his eyes and let out a self-deprecating chuckle.  

"I overestimated myself."  

His spiritual energy was now at its peak, with only a thin barrier separating him from the fifth level of Qi Refinement. Yet, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't break through the bottleneck.  

"If I had upper-grade spiritual roots, the efficiency of refining medicinal power from pills would be several times higher, and breaking through wouldn't be difficult."  

With this thought, Wei Qian shook his head and dismissed the idea of using the [Wishing Dragon Pearl] to further enhance his spiritual root aptitude.  

Upgrading from mid-grade to upper-grade spiritual roots would require ten thousand days of accumulated wish power—over twenty-seven years.  

Given such a long timeframe, even with his current mid-grade spiritual roots, he could easily reach the late stages of Qi Refinement. Wei Qian had already decided that he would only consider improving his spiritual roots after breaking through to Foundation Establishment, when his lifespan would exceed two hundred years.  

"So, what I need now is more pills."  

But as the saying goes, even heroes can be stumped by a lack of money.  

Wei Qian was currently very short on spirit stones.  

Should he sell the high-grade spear artifact he possessed? Or perhaps the last spiritual herb stored in the jade box?  

"No, that won’t work either. There’s no local market here. If I were to sell it at a trade fair, it would draw too much attention."  

Who knew if there were rogue cultivators lurking in such gatherings, ready to target him for flaunting his wealth?  

Not all rogue cultivators were like that nine-foot-tall brute who foolishly revealed himself. The truly dangerous ones were experts in ambush—striking once and fleeing immediately if unsuccessful.  

Could he exploit the spiritual peach grove under his management?  

Wei Qian considered it for only a moment before dismissing the suicidal idea.  

While Li Wanqing had entrusted him with overseeing the peach grove, there was still one person he couldn’t bypass—Old Man Fu!  

"Right now is a critical time. The Li Immortal Clan is bound to make a significant sacrifice to secure a Foundation Establishment Pill."  

If he were caught embezzling resources at such a time, he’d likely be executed as an example.  

"Is there any other way to earn spirit stones quickly?" Wei Qian pondered for a long time but came up empty-handed.  

"If only I knew how to refine pills, forge artifacts, or craft talismans."  

Among the Hundred Arts of Cultivation, though all were supposedly equal, some were clearly more lucrative than others. Pill refining, artifact forging, talisman crafting, and formation mastery stood at the top, highly sought after by cultivators and the most profitable skills.  

But obtaining such knowledge came at a steep price.  

One of the miscellaneous books Wei Qian had read recounted a minor incident:  

One year, a first-grade high-tier alchemist’s notes from the Alchemy Cauldron Xiao Clan surfaced at an auction in neighboring Linzhou, selling for an astronomical price of eight thousand spirit stones!  

Of course, part of that was due to the prestige of the Xiao Clan’s name. Even without that factor, the notes would still be worth at least five thousand spirit stones.  

"Guess I’ll have to find another way." Wei Qian sighed inwardly.  

Three days passed quietly, and Wei Qian still hadn’t come up with a viable method to earn spirit stones. Feeling somewhat disheartened, he received a message from Bai Fugui, requesting a meeting at the foot of the mountain.  

"That’s right. Maybe he has some good suggestions." With this thought, Wei Qian wasted no time and headed down the mountain to meet Bai Fugui.  

At an inn in the mortal town near Mist Ridge Mountain:  

"What? You want me to go rescue your talisman master friend?"  

Wei Qian had expected Bai Fugui to ask for a favor, but not this.  

His first instinct was to refuse.  

"I’m just a tenant farmer for the Li Clan, with meager strength. You’d better find someone else."  

Seeing Wei Qian’s refusal, Bai Fugui forced a bitter smile. "Actually, I first wanted to ask Li Guchen, but he recommended you instead."  

"That friend of mine once saved my life. I can’t just abandon him."  

Bai Fugui took out a storage pouch and tossed it to Wei Qian.  

Wei Qian channeled his spiritual energy into it and immediately counted the contents—a full one thousand low-grade spirit stones!  

"Did you empty your entire savings for this?" Wei Qian was shocked, but at the same time, he felt a flicker of respect for Bai Fugui.  

As friends went, Bai Fugui had gone above and beyond.  

Compared to mortals, cultivators were generally more ruthless and self-interested. Bai Fugui’s actions would be considered extraordinary even among ordinary people.  

"That friend once saved my life. I have to repay him," Bai Fugui explained.  

Wei Qian didn’t immediately agree. Instead, he asked, "First, tell me what kind of trouble your friend is in. Be detailed."  

Seeing Wei Qian’s hesitation, Bai Fugui brightened and quickly recounted the situation.  

His friend, Lu Ping, was a rogue cultivator and a talisman master.  

Though young, Lu Ping was highly skilled in talisman crafting and had a strong reputation among local rogue cultivators.  

A group of three rogue cultivator brothers had heard of Lu Ping’s fame and kidnapped him, intending to force him to craft talismans for them.  

"What are the cultivation levels of these three brothers?" Wei Qian asked.  

"The eldest is at the sixth level of Qi Refinement, the second is at the fifth level. The third’s exact level is unclear, but he’s also in the mid-stages of Qi Refinement." Bai Fugui had clearly done his research and answered smoothly.  

Wei Qian thought for a moment. "Give me until tomorrow. I’ll give you my answer then."  

"Alright." Bai Fugui looked disappointed but agreed.  

The next day, at dawn, Wei Qian immersed his consciousness into his spiritual sea and stood before the [Wishing Dragon Pearl], wishing for a safe rescue of Lu Ping.  

The dragon pearl indicated it would take four days.  

"Four days… That’s acceptable."  

That same day, Wei Qian informed Bai Fugui that he would take on the task—but only if he received half the payment upfront and was given four more days.  

Bai Fugui’s expression darkened.  

"The longer we wait, the more dangerous it becomes for Lu Ping."  

"Are they planning to flee the area?"  

That would complicate things. If the group took Lu Ping thousands of miles away, would Wei Qian have to chase after them?  

"No, they won’t flee. They’ve built a stronghold at Blackwind Ridge and won’t leave easily. I’m just… worried something might happen to Lu Ping in the meantime." Bai Fugui hesitated.  

Wei Qian sensed there was more Bai Fugui wasn’t saying and frowned. "Is there something else you’re not telling me?"  

"If you’re hiding crucial details, then I’m afraid I can’t help you."  

"Wait, wait!" Bai Fugui, desperate to secure Wei Qian’s help despite his reservations, finally relented.  

"Can you keep this confidential?"  

Wei Qian stared at him coldly.  

A moment later, Bai Fugui lowered his voice and revealed something that made Wei Qian’s expression change drastically!
