# Chapter 29: The Gentleman's Sword, Dou Changsheng!

**[Northern Storm (Part 2):** Since rescuing the Black Eagle Venerable, Fire Cloud True Master has come to regard you as a thorn in his side. Along your journey, assassination attempts have been relentless.]

**[The Battle of Ten-Mile Slope:** The enemy wore white robes with long flowing hair, as beautiful as a demon yet ethereal as an immortal. You recognized him—Chen Weiquan, the martial artist who triumphed in the Clear Spring Tournament at Three Sun Mountain three years prior. A scion of the capital's aristocracy, he was hailed as one of the Capital's Ten Elite.]

**[With the protection of the Green Sun Spring guarding his heart meridian and mastery of the Seven Injuries Fist, he stepped onto the Human Ranking. Over three years, he rose from beyond the top 100 to break into the top 80, earning the moniker "Steel Fist."]**

**[Fire Cloud True Master returned with renewed vigor, his ranks now filled with countless elites, far surpassing his former self. But you were no longer the same person you once were.]**

**[Heavenly flowers bloomed, and his fist technique shook the heavens—truly befitting an elite of the Human Ranking. He withstood nine of your sword strikes.]**

**[The Night Raid at the Mountain God Temple:** Purple Sun Taoist, esteemed as one of the Three Peaks of the Three Sun Sect and master of Purple Sun Peak, had long since pledged allegiance to Prime Minister Chen Qingyao. Under Fire Cloud True Master's orders, this elder—a peak Xiantian expert who had condensed the Three Flowers of Heaven, Earth, and Man, reaching the Xiantian Profound Realm—personally launched a surprise attack against you, a mere junior.]**

**[Truly a venerable elder! With nearly a century of cultivation, his Three Flowers manifested, and his Xiantian True Qi blanketed the sky. The Three Sun Sect's ultimate technique, "Purple Sun Rises in the East, Illuminating the Mortal World," left you in awe. Purple Sun Taoist's True Qi was vast and exceptionally pure, his techniques refined—a true powerhouse.]**

**[Having only just completed the Five Qi Converging to the Origin and giving birth to Xiantian True Qi, you felt the pressure mounting. You unleashed your self-created Five Qi Seal, and an endless torrent of Xiantian True Qi surged forth. A month's worth of accumulated True Qi accompanied your sword strike.]**

**[A ten-zhang-long sword beam, infused with the power of the White Tiger—Purple Sun Taoist fell.]**

**[Ten Days of Diligent Cultivation, Reward: Five Qi Seal (Upgraded Version)!]**

**[Completed!]**

Dou Changsheng glanced at the mission once more and realized that Future Dou Changsheng had once again succeeded in showing off. 

This Future Dou Changsheng was either on his way to flaunting his prowess or already in the middle of doing so. His life was smooth sailing, devoid of any real turbulence. 

If this were a play or a comic, it would undoubtedly flop—who would care about such an uneventful tale? But in reality, this was the kind of life everyone yearned for. Who wouldn't want a lifetime where every danger was averted and every calamity turned into fortune?

With a sigh, Dou Changsheng began to claim his reward. 

Though Future Dou Changsheng's luck was peerless, he was also a man of relentless cultivation. 

A lengthy scripture of over 3,000 characters repeatedly surfaced in Dou Changsheng's mind. He meticulously deciphered it word by word and finally understood why Purple Sun Taoist had met his demise. 

This **"Five Qi Seal"** was a technique Future Dou Changsheng had created based on the **Millennium Earth Pearl**. 

After consuming the Millennium Earth Pearl, even without cultivation, one's Xiantian Inner Qi would grow stronger with each passing day. And if one trained diligently, the rate of growth would be even faster. However, Xiantian Inner Qi couldn't increase indefinitely—much of it would dissipate over time. 

It was like a bottle that could only hold so much water. Even if one expanded their meridians and enlarged their dantian, turning a palm-sized bottle into a basin, the process took time. Every day, a significant amount of Xiantian Inner Qi would be lost. 

Dou Changsheng had personally experienced this—the daily capacity for Xiantian Inner Qi was far below its rate of generation. 

Thus, the **Five Qi Seal** was born. 

This technique used the five viscera (heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys) as its foundation, creating unique acupoints or inner qi spaces capable of storing vast amounts of Xiantian Inner Qi. 

This way, the Inner Qi that would otherwise dissipate could be preserved. 

Once the body reached its limit, the stored Inner Qi could be unleashed during battle. 

The principle was simple, but executing it was anything but. 

Dou Changsheng knew this required extensive study of countless martial arts texts, mastery of numerous techniques, and no small amount of luck. 

Regardless of how Future Dou Changsheng had accomplished it, his **Five Qi Seal** was undoubtedly an immensely practical secret art. 

After consuming the Millennium Earth Pearl, one's Xiantian Inner Qi was already renowned for its vastness. With the **Five Qi Seal** storing additional reserves, how could Purple Sun Taoist—a mere Three Flowers Gatherer at the Xiantian Profound Realm, not even a Divine Transformation Grandmaster—possibly survive? 

That single sword strike was nearly unstoppable below the Grandmaster level. 

Of course, this was a burst-state technique, not a sustained one. Once the stored Inner Qi was exhausted, the user would revert to their original state. 

Future Dou Changsheng was truly inscrutable. 

This wasn't even his limit—with his near-invincible luck, who knew how many hidden cards he still held? 

Reading the mission description, Dou Changsheng half-expected Future Dou Changsheng to quip: 

*"Little Yunzi brought this upon himself."* 

**Heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys!** 

Five glowing points appeared in these locations. 

In the depths of his consciousness, Dou Changsheng seemed to see these five organs materialize. 

As the **Five Qi Seal** activated, the surging Xiantian Inner Qi in his body began flowing into the newly opened Five Qi Cavities. 

In the blink of an eye, all the Inner Qi in his body had been drained. 

Yet, not a single one of the Five Qi Cavities was fully filled. 

The Millennium Earth Pearl in his dantian trembled faintly, and the Inner Qi within began swirling like a vortex, continuously churning out vast quantities of Xiantian Inner Qi. 

The Five Qi Cavities devoured everything like black holes, endlessly absorbing. 

Dou Changsheng allowed them to consume the Inner Qi—his current goal was to fill the **Five Qi Seal**, creating another trump card. 

Once all five cavities were opened and the Inner Qi released in a single surge, who could withstand such overwhelming power? 

Future Dou Changsheng had slain Purple Sun Taoist—a realm above him—with just one sword strike. 

Such magnificence! 

Even reading about it filled one with awe. 

After a night of rigorous cultivation, Dou Changsheng resumed his journey the next day. 

Cultivate, travel. 

This was his daily routine. 

By the time he reached Three Sun Mountain, the Five Qi Cavities were finally filled. 

Each cavity held five times his current capacity of Xiantian Inner Qi. 

Dou Changsheng realized that the **Five Qi Seal's** fivefold amplification wasn't fixed—it scaled with his own Inner Qi limits. 

As he grew stronger, so too would the **Five Qi Seal**. This was the terrifying aspect of the upgraded version. The standard version must have had a fixed capacity. 

His predecessor had planted the tree; now he enjoyed the shade. 

Three Sun Mountain was a renowned peak, and at its base, a bustling town had formed. 

Upon entering, Dou Changsheng immediately noticed the abundance of martial artists—swords and sabers hung at nearly every waist. 

No sooner had Dou Changsheng seated himself in a tavern and placed the **Hero's Sword** on the table than a man in a light blue robe approached and bowed. 

"Are you the **Gentleman's Sword**, Dou Changsheng?" 

"Young Hero Dou!"
