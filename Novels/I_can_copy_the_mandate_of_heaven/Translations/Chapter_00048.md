## Chapter 48: Perhaps Three Years

The atmosphere in the room suddenly became awkward, and Zhong Jun's tone turned apologetic. She felt a flush rise to her pale cheeks, and her eyes dropped, unable to meet the gaze of her companions. She had been holding one of the sisters' arms just moments before, but now she felt embarrassed, realizing that one of them, Xie Jia, was actually the daughter of the River Magistrate of Wang County, a very high-ranking official.

The other sister, Jiang Yun, was the daughter of the Prefect of Jiang. Zhong Jun couldn't help but feel intimidated, never expecting to be in such a situation with them. The three of them were now in the same boat, and their emotions were complex, filled with fear and uncertainty.

Jiang Yun noticed Zhong Jun's unease and quickly offered words of comfort. "Let's not dwell on the past. From now on, we're sisters, and we should look out for each other. We can call each other by our names or just 'sister.' We'll find a way to escape from here someday."

However, when Jiang Yun said this, Zhong Jun and Xie Jia suddenly burst into tears. "Sister, where can we escape to?" Xie Jia sobbed. "The Qiuxian Gate has many strong martial artists, and they watch us closely. Even if we try to escape, they'll catch us within half a cup of tea. What can we do even if we do escape?"

The two sisters' words left Jiang Yun feeling hopeless. She realized that they had already given up on escaping and were resigned to their fate. Jiang Yun tried to comfort them, but deep down, she knew they were right.

As they began to clean the room, Jiang Yun couldn't help but think about their situation. They had to be careful and make a good impression on their master, but she also knew that their future was uncertain. If their master turned out to be cruel, their lives would be miserable.

Jiang Yun's thoughts turned dark as she considered the possibility of being trapped in this place forever. She recalled the words of the High Incense Master, who had told them to be chaste and obedient for at least three years. If they could endure that long, they might have a chance to escape or find a way to secure their futures.

As she looked at Zhong Jun and Xie Jia, who were busy cleaning and seemed to have accepted their fate, Jiang Yun felt a pang of sadness. She knew that she had to be strong for them and find a way to survive in this difficult situation.

The three of them worked in silence, their movements slow and labored. Jiang Yun couldn't shake off the feeling that their lives were about to change forever, and not for the better. But for now, they had to focus on the present and make the best of their situation. At least they had each other, and Jiang Yun was determined to protect and care for her new sisters.

As they worked, Jiang Yun pushed aside her dark thoughts and focused on the task at hand. They had to clean the room, and they had to do it well. The master might not be kind, but they had to try to please him, at least for now. And so, they worked, their movements slow and deliberate, as they tried to come to terms with their new reality.
