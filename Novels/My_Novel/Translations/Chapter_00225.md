# Chapter 225: The Madam Possessed by a Worm, Her Internal Qi Completely Depleted

The four men—Tiger, Deer, Python, and Hound—had barely escaped with their lives. They gathered in the woods, gasping for breath, their souls still trembling with fear.

Tiger said, "Fourteen years ago, I couldn't defeat her Gentle Breeze Continuous Sword. I spent day and night thinking of a way to break her technique. Who would have thought... fourteen years later, with the four of us attacking together, we still couldn't withstand that swordplay."

"That sword technique is clearly just a basic form. But in that woman's hands, it evolves into something infinite. A single sword stroke hides ten thousand changes. I have many formidable martial arts, but I found no opportunity to use any of them. The sword intent was continuous like sand, dragging one into its midst, making it impossible to break free," Python said, his heart still filled with terror.

Every time he fought against Wen Caishang, he felt an overwhelming sense of defeat.

"Damn it!" Hound said. "Back then, the four of us were considered prodigies of our regions. Why do we become so useless when facing this Wen Caishang?"

The four men sealed their acupoints to slow their bleeding and suppress their injuries. However, the lingering Continuous Qi force on their wounds made healing difficult, leaving them drenched in blood.

Suddenly, Hound began to convulse, his face slack. He hurriedly circulated his internal energy, moving it through his meridians to suppress the anomaly. The Gentle Breeze Continuous Sword contained a faint, sinister wind that invaded the body, causing chills and fever, leading to a severe illness.

Deer said, "If Wen Caishang weren't so formidable, how could she have made us infatuated with her back then? Seeing her again today, though we have a deep grudge, I must say... her charm is even greater than before!"

The other three欲言又止 (wanted to speak but held back), falling into silence. Tiger cursed, "Damn it! The Sword Rain Pavilion bunch of bastards said Wen Caishang was severely injured, her strength less than a tenth. It's all bullshit rumors!"

"Not necessarily," Deer said, his arms gone, his sleeves empty. "Wen Caishang is indeed injured. If she weren't, with her temperament, wouldn't she have hunted us down and killed us? Besides, what was her temperament like over a decade ago? For her to be so restrained now, she must have her reasons!"

Everyone found this reasonable. Wen Caishang from over a decade ago was a tyrant of the Jianghu, ruthless in her methods. The four of them had experienced this firsthand.

But the four had misunderstood Wen Caishang. She had cultivated in seclusion, using the Silkworm Clothes Jade-Mending Art to seal her acupoints and body, tempering her temperament. She was no longer as flamboyant as before, but her ruthlessness remained; she simply held back.

Tiger said, "The four of us attacked, yet we couldn't touch her in the slightest. If this gets out, it will surely damage our reputation."

Python said, "How about this? We'll announce to the outside world that we injured Wen Caishang, making her injuries even worse."

Hound said, "Exactly. First, spread the news about Wen Caishang, then publicize our battle achievements."

The four immediately agreed.

On the mountain path.

Li Xian saw that Wen Caishang was growing weaker day by day, as if on the verge of collapse. Feeling worried, he asked, "Madam, what should we do now?"

Wen Caishang pondered, "Avoiding them only makes them search for us more frequently. Since we failed to kill those four thieves, let's do the opposite."

Li Xian said, "Does the Madam wish to travel openly and aboveboard?"

"You're clever and understand my intentions," Wen Caishang nodded, saying casually, "The more critical the moment, the calmer one must be. If I travel openly and leak my whereabouts, they will surely send people to find me. After I kill a few more groups, there will gradually be fewer of them."

"If I intentionally avoid them, they will spread rumors that I am gravely injured. Then people will always come to harass me. It's烦不胜烦 (too annoying to bear), one or two times, then more."

"Hmph, even if I, Wen Caishang, am truly injured, would they dare to bully me?"

Li Xian suggested choosing a large city and checking in openly with Wen Caishang. The city was already full of spies. Not half an hour after they settled in, powerful experts surrounded them.

Wen Caishang, dressed in white as snow, sat quietly in the main hall. Sipping clear tea, she looked indifferently at the newcomers and said, "Good, very good, another batch."

That night.

The inn was filled with corpses. Wen Caishang's clothes were not stained with blood. Taking lives was like picking something from her pocket—extremely elegant. The innkeeper was so frightened he fainted, and the waiter hid under the counter.

Wen Caishang stood gracefully with her hands clasped before her abdomen, her long sleeves hanging down. She said calmly, "Xiao Xian, help me upstairs."

Her white skirt fluttered as she took delicate steps. She walked past the corpses and slept peacefully in a superior room.

The next day.

"Demoness, come out and die!"

The corpses in the hall still held some warmth, but outside, disciples of the Yellow Sand Gate and the Infinite Blade Sect had surrounded the place, forming battle formations.

Wen Caishang walked down the stairs slowly, dignified and noble, completely at odds with the corpses on the ground. She said softly, "Good morning, everyone. You've disturbed my sleep, how very rude."

She smiled and asked, "Xiao Xian, should these people be killed?" Her eyes flashed with a sharp light.

Li Xian thought, "If I tell you not to kill, would you listen?" He said, "Naturally, they should be killed."

Wen Caishang laughed, "My little husband says they should be killed, then I shall kill them all." She waved her sleeve, shooting the wooden chopsticks from the table.

With a few whistling sounds, the encircling men's eyes were pierced, the chopsticks stuck in their eyeballs. The formations of the Yellow Sand Gate and Infinite Blade Sect were not weak, and with their numerical advantage, they should have been difficult to deal with. But their leaders were extremely foolish. Once they suffered a setback, they were terrified, unable to凝聚 their formation, becoming like a heap of scattered sand.

How could they not be at Wen Caishang's mercy?

Sword shadows flashed frequently in the hall. After a few breaths...

Li Xian supported Wen Caishang's right hand as they walked slowly out of the inn. Wen Caishang suddenly stopped and said, "Xiao Xian, you forgot to pay the bill."

Li Xian said, "Yes," and ran back into the hall. He woke the innkeeper and stuffed a tael of silver into his hand. The innkeeper, dazed, was gradually woken by the pungent smell of blood. Seeing dozens of corpses on the ground, he was so frightened his eyes went dark, and he fainted again.

Li Xian used the remaining money to buy a decent carriage. They traveled on the main road, unafraid of ambushes. It was truly chaotic; several groups of men were all beheaded by her sword.

She didn't care about the shockwaves in the Sword Alliance; her heart was calm. After several days like this, the intensity of the ambushes along the road began to weaken.

Inside the carriage. Wen Caishang sat cross-legged, practicing her internal breathing. Though she had intimidated many heroes, her injuries had worsened. This was within her expectations; she remained calm and composed, still in control.

That day...

Inside a stone pavilion on a mountain.

After several days of travel and killing enemies, both Wen Caishang and Li Xian felt exhausted. Seeing a roadside stone pavilion with beautiful scenery around, Wen Caishang wanted to stop and rest.

After the carriage stopped, Li Xian checked the terrain and saw a stream a few miles away. He twisted open a waterskin, drew his Sinking River Sword, and played with the stream water. Suddenly, with an upward flick, a line of water leaped up and accurately fell into the waterskin.

Wen Caishang sat in the pavilion, inspecting her body. The injury to her internal organs was still there. She used her internal energy to recuperate; every time there was a sign of recovery, an enemy would disturb her, forcing her to use her Qi to fight. This反复 (repetition) made her injuries go deeper.

She thought, "If it weren't for these trivial matters, and I had prepared medicinal herbs to cultivate in peace, I would have recovered by now."

As she was lost in thought, she suddenly frowned and said softly, "Who is hiding there? Come out."

In the distant mountain path, an old man in green robes appeared in view. He cupped his hands and laughed, "Madam Wen, I didn't expect us to be so fated, to meet in this wilderness."

This man was a member of the Dragon-Riding Ship.

He carried a simple backpack, leaned on a wooden cane, and had sweat beads on his forehead. He looked like he had been traveling a long way.

Wen Caishang smiled, "Old sir, where are you going?" The old man in green said, "Hahaha, I traveled thousands of miles to attend the Dragon Appreciation Grand Banquet. Now that the banquet is over, I'm naturally going home."

Wen Caishang said, "Caishang is also going home. I see you are dressed for a long journey, wearing simple clothes. I imagine you are a man of noble character, frugal and self-disciplined. But even if you are frugal, it wouldn't be inappropriate to take a carriage. Why go through the hardship of walking?"

The old man in green said, "It's not about frugality. It's just that I have loved the beauty of the world since I was a child. Riding in a carriage is more convenient, but I might miss many scenery spots. Besides, I am old, not like Madam Wen, who is young. To be able to see more magnificent sights of the world is the best thing."

"Sir has such elegance," Wen Caishang smiled. "Please sit, sir."

The old man in green laughed heartily, "Hahaha, I am fated with the Madam. Since the Madam invites me, I shall not decline." He sat down boldly and cupped his hands with a smile, "To be able to share a table with the Madam is a great fortune."

Wen Caishang said, "Please forgive Caishang for being ignorant. I haven't asked for your name yet."

The old man in green said, "It's just that this old man thinks my name is obscure and my reputation is low, not easy to mention, for fear of being laughed at. This old man is called Ma Zhongguang, a man from the Southern Frontier."

Speaking of this, Ma Zhongguang asked, "If this old man remembers correctly, Madam Wen has always had a young man by her side, inseparable, seemingly named Li Xian. Where is he now?"

Wen Caishang frowned slightly, but a smile remained on her face. "Xiao Xian, Master Ma wants to see you. Why don't you come over and offer tea? Wouldn't that be losing etiquette?"

Li Xian ran back from the stream, recognizing Ma Zhongguang. This man was silent and rarely showed his face on the Dragon-Riding Ship. When others asked him questions, he only responded with a 'Hmm'. The only time he spoke to others was when they decided who would stay until the end during the forty thousand miles, settling it with a palm strike against the Madam.

Li Xian said, "Master Ma, what a coincidence, to meet you here."

Ma Zhongguang said, "Haha, it's a coincidence but not really. You are heading south, and I am heading south. Although the roads are different, if we all go in the same direction, there's a chance we'll meet, isn't there?"

Wen Caishang said, "Xiao Xian, I have tea here. Brew some for Master Ma!"

Li Xian took the tea and ran back to the carriage, fetching a small copper teapot. The teapot was exquisite, the size of a palm, with fine patterns. He poured in water, lit a charcoal fire, boiled the water until it沸腾 (boiled), then sprinkled in the tea leaves.

Soon, a refreshing fragrance filled the air. Wen Caishang took the teapot, poured a cup of tea, and handed it to Li Xian, saying, "Offer it to Master Ma." Li Xian held the cup with both hands and offered it forward.

Ma Zhongguang looked at the tea and hesitated for a long time. Wen Caishang smiled, "What, Master Ma is worried that Caishang will poison you?"

Wen Caishang poured another cup and drank it while it was hot, smiling as she looked at Ma Zhongguang. Ma Zhongguang laughed, "Hahaha, Madam Wen's tea is expensive. This old man is a crude fellow, so I won't drink it. To avoid wasting the Madam's kindness."

Wen Caishang said with regret, "Caishang thought I had met a kindred spirit. Now it seems, it's ultimately no different from a withered bone."

Ma Zhongguang said, "Madam Wen, what do you mean?" His whole body tightened. He wanted to create distance, but he felt his whole body go weak and numb. A toxin had already spread throughout his body.

Wen Caishang smiled, "You, you. You came looking for me specially. What for?"

"You!" Ma Zhongguang was extremely angry. "You didn't even know my purpose, and you resorted to such a vicious hand?" He tried to use his martial arts and Gu techniques to解 this great poison, but all his resistance was useless.

Wen Caishang said softly, "Anyway, it can't be anything good. Killing you or skinning you, you wouldn't be wronged."

"Don't struggle. You are from the Southern Frontier, so you must have Gu techniques to rely on. But this poison of mine, you absolutely cannot解."

"Xiao Bai, show yourself."

Then a white silkworm crawled out from Ma Zhongguang's body. Wen Caishang reached out and took it, gently teasing the white silkworm.

This was the "Ancestor Silkworm." The key item for the Silkworm Clothes Jade-Mending Art.

Wen Caishang's "Silkworm Silk" fabric, and the mulberry gardens and silkworm estates under her command, were all related to this silkworm; they were cultivated from it. That's why the silkworm silk was tough and popular, unique in the world.

This was one of her trump cards.

Since her old injuries had not healed, she was unwilling to fight fiercely. Sensing Ma Zhongguang approaching, she had already arranged for the Ancestor Silkworm to attach itself to him and bite him, injecting a strange poison.

"Vicious woman! You vicious woman!" Ma Zhongguang's face turned blue and purple; the Gu worms in his body had all died.

Wen Caishang, full of charm, said, "You followed me. For what? Speak quickly."

"If I speak, will you解 the poison for me?" Ma Zhongguang had no fighting power left.

Wen Caishang smiled without speaking. Ma Zhongguang said, "I... I know you are scheming to obtain Earth Essence. This trip... is to discuss with you, to exchange for Earth Essence. I have no hostile intent, Madam... spare... spare my life."

Wen Caishang narrowed her eyes slightly: "How did you know I was scheming for Earth Essence?"

"Th... That's because..." Ma Zhongguang took a Gu worm from his ear and said, "This is a Dragon Gu. It needs the heart blood of a dragon beast to transform. I helped the dragon go through its water tribulation to get the old dragon's heart blood."

"But when I asked for the blood in front of the old dragon's pool, the old dragon前辈 said the heart blood had already been given to someone else. Although he didn't say who, I guessed it was you. At the time, I found it strange. The flood dragon succeeded in its water tribulation, and heavenly blessings descended, turning its scales into dragon slough. The uses of heart blood are far inferior."

"Thinking of an ancient text, there is a method to steal Earth Essence, vaguely related to the flood dragon's water tribulation. So I had related guesses... Madam, spare my life."

"This old man was greedy and insatiable. Please spare me."

Wen Caishang's lips curled up: "So that's how it is. You are quite clever." She sipped her tea, observing Ma Zhongguang's struggle with great interest.

"Vicious woman!" Ma Zhongguang's vision darkened, knowing there was no hope. His breath was about to cease. His last words were: "You... you... will regret it. You... did you think I dared to come to you... with no means at all? Look... look at your Qi Lake, hahaha..."

With that, he shattered his own heart meridian, and his breath ceased.

Wen Caishang frowned, suddenly feeling her internal Qi was diminishing. She focused her mind and looked inward. Unknowingly, a Gu worm had attached itself to her Qi Lake.

It was sucking her internal Qi, and the speed was getting faster and faster.

"When? When did this happen? From the moment this Ma Zhongguang appeared, I was on guard, wary of his Gu techniques. When did it happen? My internal Qi is getting less and less. What should I do? Strong enemies are all around. My injuries are already severe, and I need internal Qi to suppress them and nourish my body. If this Gu worm keeps sucking my Qi, I... I... am truly in extreme danger!"

Wen Caishang immediately grabbed Ma Zhongguang's pulse; he was already dead. Her Qi volume plummeted, her strength instantly reduced. Her delicate body trembled slightly. For the first time, her charming face showed a great loss of composure.

(The end of the month is approaching, please give me some monthly tickets.)
