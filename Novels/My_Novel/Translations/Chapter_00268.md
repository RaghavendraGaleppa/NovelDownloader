Chapter 268: The Mistress Is Domineering, Tracking Her Lover Across Miles. How Dare You Take the Little Master’s Life?

Wen Caishang controlled silkworms to trace silk threads, healing her injuries while chasing her lover. The Silkworm Garment Jade-Crossing Art displayed its miraculous effects, proving incredibly potent. She had prepared ample silver coins, and a strange horse capable of chasing the moon pulled the fragrant jade treasure carriage. The speed was astonishing, but because Li Xian was already far away and she only knew his general direction, much time was wasted.

Inside the carriage, a jade table stood horizontally, and fragrant curtains hung down. Her silkworm-silk dress clung to her skin, soft and gauzy, as if trying to conceal yet revealing everything. It was enchanting and seductive. Her long hair was coiled up, fixed with a silver hairpin, with two strands of sideburns hanging slightly down. She supported her head with her left hand, her fair toes slightly raised. Though her heart was filled with rage, her face no longer showed it. Her seductive eyes were half-closed as she practiced the Silkworm Garment Emerald Jade Art internally.

"That bastard left me. He actually made it impossible for me to practice that marvelous technique for a while. Autumn Moon is dead, and there is no one else by my side."

She suddenly opened her eyes. The Silkworm Garment Jade-Crossing Art was indeed a peerless technique of the current era, but its drawback was obvious: as one progressed, it urgently required two people to practice together. One would wear the silkworm garment, while the other would cultivate the energy contained within it.

She thought erratically: "If I catch him, how should I deal with him? Cut off his legs? Although this is helpless, it seems there is no better way. Alas, if his legs are broken, he will lose some of his heroic spirit. But it is best to keep him by my side."

She suddenly recalled their past intimacy. The painted boat drifting on the river, the sights and sounds along the way, the calligraphy and paintings... she couldn't help but feel infatuated and sweet... The joy of that time made her soul drift away.

The years of the past were wasted like this. The beauty of today was like visiting a fairy palace, making her linger and forget to return. Originally, relying on her beauty, once she had tasted the flavor, she could have acted willfully and found other men to play and have fun with. She只需 nodded, and men in the world, even if they knew it meant death or losing a leg, would surely seek it without hesitation.

But she had always demanded "perfection."

Her lover must have looks, talent, and affection... all three were indispensable. There were indeed people with outstanding looks. There were also those with outstanding talent. But affection was extremely difficult to find. Looking around the world, it was hard to find another person who could make Wen Caishang grow affection for them. Her temperament was such that she valued profit over emotion. Her relationship with Li Xian was purely a coincidence, a trick of fate.

In this case, no matter how good-looking others were or how talented they were, it had nothing to do with her. To experience that feeling again, she had to catch Li Xian completely and trap him by her side.

Wen Caishang said: "After all, he is my Li Lang. Even if I cut off his legs, I would feel heartache. Forget it... I will learn a set of martial arts and seal the major acupoints in his feet. That way, he won't be able to use his legs."

"I don't even blink when I break people's limbs or take their lives. But I just don't want to hurt you, yet you left me. Hmph, you don't know what's good for you."

With a mix of resentment and anger, it was as if Li Xian were right beside her, and she was complaining to him with a grievance.

She suddenly raised her hand and waved it lightly. The carriage immediately stopped. She lifted the curtain and got off, feeling a slight sourness in her heart. In the past, at times like this, Li Xian would have moved a jade stool and reached out to help her down. Her lightness skill was superb; she could climb steep cliffs and precipices, so she didn't need help. But this attentive care was very much to her liking.

Wen Caishang was always extremely contradictory. She preferred to lack something than to have something of poor quality. Therefore, despite the many guards in the manor and countless suitors, she didn't even glance at them. She even forbade others from pursuing her. She alone was served by Li Xian for two years, with meticulous care, which subtly permeated her heart.

There was the intensity of a storm, and the gentleness of a continuous spring rain. Li Xian had escaped, but the threads of affection had not diminished in the slightest. Instead, recalling the past, she felt extremely uncomfortable, and both hatred and love increased.

She was dressed exquisitely, with none of her former embarrassment. Her nobility was indescribable. The pearls on her hairpin lightly touched each other, making a "clack-clack" sound. Her sleeves were wide, with extremely exquisite patterns. As she lightly swept her sleeve, the soil in front of her turned over.

This was a dense forest.

There were no traces in the forest. The soil turned over, revealing a wooden box. Her palm contained a suction force, and the box "puffed" as it leaped from the ground and landed in her hand.

Wen Caishang lightly blew away the soil. The box had a hidden clasp; it was Li Xian's thing. She opened the clasp, and inside was a set of silkworm garments and a set of rope tools.

They were folded neatly and arranged properly. Wen Caishang gently stroked them, her expression alternating between tenderness and anger. "This kid is indeed smart. He guessed that my ability to find people comes from silkworm silk. I never told him about this, but he saw me setting up a silkworm silk array, and the silkworm silk has a mysterious attraction... He must have guessed it from that."

"That's why he took precautions in advance, hiding all the silkworm silk items in the box and burying them well."

"Li Lang, oh Li Lang... you make me so contradictory. If you weren't so smart, I could easily find you. But then I wouldn't love you so much."

"You kid... after all, you have some conscience. You folded these clothes and ropes carefully, and they are perfectly intact. I imagine you also cherish our past intimacy. You didn't throw them away randomly."

She put the box away, and her anger subsided slightly. She boarded the carriage and continued the chase. She sneered: "You know to take off your clothes and hide the ropes, but it's hard for you to imagine that I had already wrapped silkworm silk around your hair."

In a small earthen house in Heshi Village.

Every night, Wen Caishang would wrap silkworm silk around her hair. It was just a pastime for her; how could she know it would come in handy? The Ancestor Silkworm lay in her palm, sensing the silkworm silk mysteriously.

The silkworm silk sold by the Silkworm Garment Pavilion, when traced to its source, all came from this "Ancestor Silkworm." The countless white silkworms in the Mulberry Garden were all descendants of the Ancestor Silkworm. Wen Caishang's tracking technique was to spread the silkworm silk and then sense and track it.

Wen Caishang's miscellaneous knowledge was both extensive and refined. Combined with the Ancestor Silkworm's sensing and her own intelligence, she gradually analyzed and observed, making it naturally difficult for her enemies to escape. Once Wen Caishang decided to kill, no one could escape.

The carriage sped along.

The distance grew closer.

One day, they arrived at "Embroidery City." Wen Caishang remembered it vividly. Although she had never been to this city, she had traveled down the river with Li Xian and glimpsed the city's lights from afar.

That day, they whispered sweet words to each other, intimately close. The scenery along the way remained unforgettable. Every time she thought of it, she found it hard to part, wishing to immerse herself in it and never come out. She rode into the city, and the strange, handsome horse and the luxurious treasure carriage immediately drew attention.

The various surnames in the city noticed, and they couldn't help but speculate privately. Wen Caishang naturally paid no attention, but through her sensing, she knew Li Xian had stayed here for a long time.

"He fled from the north to the south, being more familiar with the route. So this time, he chose to return along the route. That's smart... I am indeed not as familiar with the routes in this area as he is."

Passing through a bustling market, she suddenly saw a red list hanging, which read: "Lust Demon Hua Manlou"...

Behind it were some fabricated crimes. Luo Feiyan had indeed suffered greatly, but the red list naturally didn't mention it, for fear of damaging her reputation.

Wen Caishang glanced at the portrait, frowned slightly, and then smiled. She knew that "Hua Manlou" was Li Xian. The text described Li Xian as committing all kinds of evil, including rape and looting. She knew it must be a lie. Li Xian was indeed full of bad ideas; he had tormented her terribly, and he was definitely not an honest man. But she knew that he was fundamentally kind and humble, and he held a bottom line.

Ordinary women were not worthy of making him lustful enough to commit rape and looting. She wanted to find out the reason, but suddenly noticed an old man in black amidst the crowd. A casual glance told her that this person was quite formidable. She thought: "This man has been staring at the portrait, his eyes full of hatred. Could he have a grudge against Li Lang? This red list, without thinking, must have some trick behind it."

"Hmph! My Li Lang, how dare you hold a grudge against him? You have some nerve."

She closed the carriage curtain and calmed her mind. The treasure carriage remained parked on the street, unmoving.

The old man in black was named "Black-Faced尊王" (Black-Faced Venerable King). He was a figure from the Blood Pool Meat Forest and the master of the Black-Faced Bat King.

It turned out... the Black-Faced Bat King had coincidentally obtained the "Yellow Nine Ginseng." He had no corresponding recipe for the time being and felt it was useless. So he wrote a letter to his master, intending to present it to him in exchange for benefits.

But just after sending the letter, he was besieged repeatedly. He was trapped in a wild mountain forest, unable to communicate, and eventually died. The Black-Faced尊王 received the letter and was overjoyed, sending back several letters, but received no reply.

Unable to hold back, he came in person. He saw the red list record: "The Black-Faced Bat King has been executed."

Knowing his disciple was dead, he felt immense grief. He knew that the matter of killing the Black-Faced Bat King was related to the Luo family. The Yellow Nine Ginseng was likely in the hands of the Luo family.

So he prepared a coffin and visited the Luo family, intending to make a big scene. The Luo family naturally resisted, and several clan elders joined forces to deal with him. Although they could hold him back, they couldn't capture him.

After a long, fierce battle, the Black-Faced尊王 laughed: "The Luo family killed my disciple, this matter is not over. If you don't give me an explanation, let's see who dies!"

He leaped and escaped far away. His lightness skill was superb, and no one in the Luo family could catch up. The Luo family's "Embroidered Dream Gauze Step" was extremely nimble and elegant, but speed was not its strong point, so they were truly helpless.

After that, the Black-Faced尊王 visited and harassed them several times. The Luo family grew murderous and set up an array to ambush him. It did have a strange effect, almost trapping the Black-Faced尊王.

At a critical moment, the Black-Faced尊王 used "Technique Dao: Merging with the Earth," combined with "Earth-Walking Dragon and Snake Step"... to resolve the danger. The Luo family's array was useless, and they couldn't keep him.

The Black-Faced尊王 became even more brazen, harassing them several times. He even intended to capture Luo family disciples, drain their blood, and throw them into the courtyard.

The Luo family was utterly helpless and extremely angry, but they were unwilling to fight the Black-Faced尊王 again. So they invited him to negotiate, explaining the situation. They told the Black-Faced尊王 that the one who killed the Black-Faced Bat King was definitely not from the Luo family.

It was a rogue cultivator named "Hua Manlou."

The Luo family was also searching for him. The Black-Faced尊王 couldn't fully believe it, so he went to investigate alone. The Luo family had lost a precious treasure and had provoked a powerful expert for nothing. They felt extremely aggrieved, and they knew that this matter would not be settled with words.

The Black-Faced尊王 was not to be trifled with, but the Luo family was not afraid of him. So the clan discussed it and found the corpse of the Black-Faced Bat King. Then they sought out the Black-Faced尊王 to analyze the situation on the spot.

Luo Xiangxiang deduced the location where the Black-Faced Bat King's body was hidden from Luo Feiyan's words.

The Luo family dug secretly. They transported the body back to the outer courtyard and set up a shed to store it. They released a signal, inviting the Black-Faced尊王 to negotiate.

At this moment...

The Black-Faced尊王 accepted the invitation and was preparing to go to the Luo family. But he ran into Wen Caishang. They met mysteriously, and according to the timing, it was just right.

The Black-Faced尊王 was already sixty to seventy percent convinced. He was about to go to the appointment. Wen Caishang lifted the carriage curtain and watched him leave, thinking: "This concerns Li Lang, I will follow him."

She drove the carriage and slowly followed. She saw the Black-Faced尊王 arrive at the Luo family's mansion, where two clan elders personally welcomed him.

The Black-Faced尊王 brushed his sleeves and snorted: "Hmph, what else is there to say between us? The enmity of killing a disciple is irreconcilable. Let our martial arts do the talking!"

The Luo clan elder 'Luo Hanting' cupped his hands and smiled: "Venerable King, please calm your anger. There is a misunderstanding in this matter. Please come in."

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "Hmph, no matter what tricks you play, you can't keep me. I want to see what other strange things you want to do!"

The group entered the Luo residence.

They saw an open space where a shed was set up. Standing around it were the Luo family head "Luo Mantang," the Luo clan elder "Luo Xiangxiang," the Luo clan elder "Luo San," and the Luo family's golden daughter "Luo Feiyan"...

There were about four or five people.

Luo Mantang said: "Brother Venerable!" Then he said: "This is your disciple's corpse, please take a look."

The Black-Faced尊王 was stunned. He carefully lifted the curtain. He saw the corpse of the Black-Faced Bat King was decayed, with black water flowing out, unbearable to look at, and the stench was overpowering.

Although it was difficult to see the appearance, it was definitely the Black-Faced Bat King. Because the "Three Blood Training Classics" involved drinking the blood of others, leading to mixed blood quality. The Black-Faced Bat King cultivated blood and stored poison.

After death, the blood poison corroded the bones, flesh, and skin. Thus, the decay was faster, and black water flowed out!

The Black-Faced尊王 was extremely grieved. He wailed loudly, tears streaming down his face. Luo Mantang said: "Brother Venerable, please restrain your grief!"

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "Good! My disciple's corpse is here. You still dare to quibble, saying it wasn't your Luo family's doing!"

"I must avenge my disciple and retrieve the treasure for him! We will not rest until one of us is dead!"

The Luo clan elders secretly formed an array, moving their feet lightly to set up the formation. Luo Mantang waved his hand and said: "Wait. Brother Venerable, don't be impatient. The corpse is here, but it wasn't done by the Luo family. We invited you here to present the facts, explain the truth, clear up the misunderstanding, discuss cooperation, and seek mutual benefit."

Luo Mantang looked middle-aged, but he was actually over a hundred years old. His speech was measured, with the air of a great master. He said: "Brother Venerable is a smart man and also a martial arts expert."

"Now that the corpse is here, we can deduce from the traces on the corpse how your disciple died and who the enemy is."

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "Hmph!"

Luo Mantang gestured. Luo Hanting and Luo San moved the corpse into the sunlight. Under the sun's照射, many injuries became visible.

They saw its flesh was sticky and pierced by silk threads. This was a technique of the Luo family. The Black-Faced尊王 had experienced it and immediately recognized it: "You still dare to quibble. I see this technique should be from a woman. Have her come to accept her death quickly."

Everyone's martial arts were exquisite. They observed the technique and deduced the person who executed it. Luo Mantang had already seen the Black-Faced Bat King's corpse and prepared his words in advance. He said:

"To be honest, our Luo family disciples did fight with your disciple. They used our family's martial arts to injure him, but they were unable to kill him."

Everyone looked at the details again. The Black-Faced尊王 secretly nodded, seeing that the Black-Faced Bat King had used "Transforming Canopy Art," "Bone Probing Art"... and many other techniques to deal with this move.

Although he was injured, he had counterattacked and subdued that woman. The Black-Faced尊王 thought: "The woman who injured my disciple has a deep cultivation and profound skill. Even in the Luo family, it would be hard to find such a person. Was it her?"

Without changing his expression, he glanced at Luo Feiyan.

Luo Mantang said: "Your disciple's fatal injuries are in these two places." He pointed to several sword marks. After being burned by the sun, the injuries were charred black.

Although the Black-Faced尊王's martial arts were strong, he couldn't completely restore the scene at the time. Moreover, the Black-Faced Bat King's corpse was decayed, and the flesh, muscles, and internal organs... were all corroded by the poisoned blood.

Luo Mantang's martial arts skill was not inferior to the Black-Faced尊王's, but his lightness skill was not as good, so he couldn't keep him. Since he had dug up the corpse, he had pondered his words and fabricated a more reasonable battle scenario.

As he explained this point by point, the Black-Faced尊王 was already eighty percent convinced. Even so, although the Luo family hadn't directly killed the Black-Faced Bat King, they were still a great enemy. But the Black-Faced尊王 had made trouble several times; avenging his disciple was one reason, and coveting the treasure was another.

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "Hmph! If you hadn't coveted my disciple's treasure and injured him, how could such a petty thief have killed my disciple?! You still need to give an explanation for this matter. Otherwise, this is not over."

Luo Xiangxiang said: "It was clearly your disciple who killed our Luo family clansmen first. He stole the treasure, and we ordered a search. What's wrong with that!"

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "Is that so? I received a letter that said you coveted my disciple's treasure and failed to snatch it, so you became angry with shame."

"Turning black and white upside down!" Luo San said angrily.

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "Same to you!" Luo Mantang said: "Brother Venerable, don't get angry. Our Luo family is also at fault in this matter. That's why we invited you here to discuss settling it."

Luo Mantang continued: "What do you want? Please tell me." The Black-Faced尊王 said: "Simple... hand over that woman from your Luo family. I will burn her alive to offer sacrifices to my poor disciple."

Luo Xiangxiang said: "Dream on!" Luo Feiyan frowned tightly.

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "You won't hand her over? Then I'll take her myself!" He had been secretly gathering Qi for a long time. Suddenly, he attacked ferociously, his hands grabbing towards Luo Feiyan.

He had long guessed that several of the Black-Faced Bat King's injuries were inflicted by Luo Feiyan. Luo Mantang stepped sideways and protected Luo Feiyan. His palms were like stroking light gauze, and colorful silk protected them completely.

The Black-Faced尊王 couldn't break through. He turned and retreated, sneering: "You can protect her for a moment, but can you protect her for a lifetime? If you have the ability, bring this girl along when you sleep with your wife. Hahaha."

Luo Feiyan's face turned ashen, and she was about to curse. Luo Mantang said: "Brother Venerable, please see if this is acceptable."

"Hua Manlou is a villain who commits rape and looting, doing evil continuously. Whether he took advantage of an opportunity or used insidious schemes, your disciple was ultimately killed by him. Our Luo family is also searching for clues about him, seeking justice for the innocent and speaking for the weak."

"If we continue to waste time here, we will inevitably give the villain a chance. Let him escape further and further."

"If Brother Venerable insists, the treasure is yours. If I also insist, the treasure is our Luo family's. How about this... the ownership of the treasure, we will split it equally."

"Our Luo family has been searching for that Hua Manlou for some time, and we have some clues in this situation.不妨同仇敌忾, jointly hunt that villain. Our Luo family's financial and material resources are widespread, and we have indeed found some clues about him. We can share them with Brother Venerable... In this way, this matter can be considered settled."

The Black-Faced尊王 and Luo Mantang knew each other's intentions clearly. The Black-Faced尊王 used his disciple's death as a pretext to seize the treasure. Luo Mantang, on the one hand, was unwilling to waste time, on the other hand, the Black-Faced尊王 already knew about the Yellow Nine Ginseng, and it was irreversible. Thirdly, he was unwilling to give Li Xian an advantage.

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "Good!"

The Luo family members all breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that the family head was adept at maneuvering, had a strategic mind, and looked at the big picture. This way of handling it was truly excellent. The Luo family's luck was just a little poor.

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "This kid's martial arts are without sect or school. Although the quality is not bad, I imagine he has no strong backing. If we join forces to capture him, it will be as easy as turning over our hand. Then we will share the treasure, and our enmity will be dissolved. This will be a grand and beautiful event."

The grief for his disciple was instantly gone. Luo Mantang smiled: "Very good, very good." He instructed Luo Xiangxiang to share the clues they had obtained with the Black-Faced尊王.

Luo Feiyan had mixed feelings. Although she resented Li Xian's insidiousness, seeing the Black-Faced尊王 take action personally, she thought he would find it hard to escape the fate of becoming a dried corpse, and she actually felt sad for him.

The two sides shook hands and made peace, as if their previous enmity was gone. Luo San cursed: "A mere rogue cultivator dares to covet the treasure. Hmph... he doesn't know the immensity of heaven and earth."

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "If we find this kid, I need to burn him as a sacrifice."

They all expressed disgust for Li Xian. Suddenly at this moment, they heard a strange sound, like someone sighing. Everyone followed the sound and looked, suddenly feeling a chill run through their bodies, shocked and speechless.

Behind Luo Mantang stood a woman in white. She had a beautiful face and a peerless appearance. She stood quietly and gracefully; it was Wen Caishang. Everyone had been talking heatedly just now about how to deal with Li Xian, and Wen Caishang had been listening by the side.

She didn't hide her presence at all and had been standing behind Luo Mantang. Only at this moment, when Wen Caishang sighed, did everyone realize someone was there. Looking back at the journey... memories flashed back one by one. Only then did they discover that this woman had actually been behind them the whole time.

Such martial arts were world-shocking!

Wen Caishang had experienced this rise and fall. Although the Silkworm Garment Jade-Crossing Art was regressing, her strength and foundation were only deeper, not shallower. She had gathered the key ingredients for the "Precious Treasure Technique Dao," and her depth was immeasurable.

Luo Mantang was terrified and almost stumbled forward. He quickly composed himself and said: "This... this... this..." He was so shocked that he felt as if he were hanging on a thorn, and his tongue was tied.

Wen Caishang said: "My little master has caused you so much trouble, I am truly sorry." She said softly.

"Little master?" The Black-Faced尊王 was confused.

Wen Caishang said: "That is the Hua Manlou you spoke of."

Everyone was horrified. Luo Mantang hesitated to speak, not thinking that a mere rogue cultivator could have such a beautiful master? His mind was in chaos.

Wen Caishang said: "This Venerable Brother, you said my disciple killed your disciple?"

The Black-Faced尊王's scalp went numb. He had used this as a pretext to harass the Luo family. At this moment, he didn't dare to nod. He thought: "This woman suddenly appeared; she must have some silent movement technique. I have Technique: Merging with the Earth. Combined with my martial arts, I should be able to protect myself. Why should I lose my spirit?"

He mustered his courage and replied: "Yes! Are you his master? Then this matter needs to..." But his底气 was insufficient.

The Luo Mantang group all thought that this Black-Faced尊王 was really a person who bullied the weak and feared the strong. The Luo family was not weak, but being harassed by him was indeed very annoying.

Wen Caishang said: "My disciple's mistake, I should bear it." The Black-Faced尊王 felt a bit relieved and said: "How do you plan to bear it?"

Wen Caishang said: "My disciple killed your disciple. I will kill your disciple's master. This is how I bear it."

"My little master is very disobedient; I will discipline him more in time. But if my little master wants to kill your disciple, it can only be blamed on your disciple's bad luck. If his death can make my little master smile, I would be willing."

Everyone present changed color. They all felt that this woman spoke softly and gently, but was extremely domineering and protective of her lover. The lives of others were treated as if they were nothing.

The Black-Faced尊王 sneered: "What a big口气, I won't keep you company!" He turned and fled. His body lay flat on the ground, moving like a snake.

His speed was astonishing, but very strange, as if he had the strange ability to burrow into the ground. Wen Caishang targeted a spot and raised her palm to suck. With a "rumble," the Black-Faced尊王 was pulled out of the ground, his face full of shock.

The Black-Faced尊王 said: "Again!" He continued to burrow and escape. Wen Caishang's delicate hand flipped, and she executed a suction palm from a distance. The Black-Faced尊王 was pulled out again.

No matter how he tried to escape, he couldn't escape the palm of her hand. The Luo family members had fought the Black-Faced尊王 several times and felt that this move was unsolvable. Now seeing Wen Caishang easily resolve it, they felt it was incredible.

Wen Caishang said: "My little master only killed your disciple, yet you hold such a grudge. Please go die." Her palm force surged, and the energy penetrated the ground, shattering his heart, spleen, and head. She killed him on the spot.

The Black-Faced尊王's many techniques were unable to be used before he was killed. The gap in strength was not something that could be described by "realms." It was purely a difference in martial arts understanding and personal means. Compared to other things, the difference in realms was actually smaller.

Wen Caishang raised her eyes and looked at them.

Luo Mantang said hurriedly: "Senior, the matter of Hua Manlou must be a mistake by our subordinates. The Luo family will definitely give you an explanation."

Wen Caishang said: "Did he commit rape and looting?"

Luo San said: "Naturally... naturally not." Wen Caishang said: "Bring me the clues." The Poisonous Hunger Insect had one foot and one head left. Her strength had not fully recovered, and after killing the Black-Faced尊王, her murderous intent subsided.

Luo Mantang presented the clues. Wen Caishang also requested extremely detailed maps of the surrounding cities.

She deduced for half a day: "To catch Li Xian, I need to anticipate his movements. Always following behind him, I would be no different from Su Qiuwu and the others."

She anticipated that Li Xian might pass through the Prosperous Scenery City, and immediately took the strange horse and set off overnight.

Guided by the Ancestor Silkworm again.

She arrived at a vermilion door and gently knocked on it.
