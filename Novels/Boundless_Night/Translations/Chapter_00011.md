**Chapter 11: Degradation**

Feng Yi'an was tall, with a beard bristling like steel needles and bright, piercing eyes. His voice was forceful, giving the impression of an upright, straightforward man. However, once Qin Ming learned the truth, he found Feng Yi'an utterly repulsive.

"We are truly sorry for what happened this time. We will kill that Blood Bear as soon as possible to make amends for our oversight," Feng Yi'an said with an expression of profound sincerity.

Old Man Liu sighed, urging them to properly guard the mountain forest and prevent mutated creatures from causing further trouble. Despite his advanced age, he was extremely angry. They had killed people and then came to apologize—who were they trying to impress? This fake sincerity, presented in person, was no different from sprinkling salt on the wounds of the bereaved. It showed they had no regard for them and feared no violent reactions.

"Alas, it's mainly because some of our brothers are injured, and we were short-handed during patrol, which led to this unexpected incident," Feng Yi'an explained. He brought up the old matter again, asking Xu Yueping to plant the Black Moon medicine as soon as possible, as the Patrollers needed it for healing so they could better guard the mountain.

Xu Yueping was seething with anger, but he had to suppress it.

Feng Yi'an said, "We will depart immediately. We won't leave the mountains until the Blood Bear is slain. Brother Xu, please trouble yourself to console the families of the deceased and injured on our behalf."

Qin Ming found such a hypocritical facade utterly hideous. Xu Yueping subtly brushed his arm, then stood up to see the Patrollers off. Evidently, he feared that Qin Ming, with his youthful impetuousness, might do something rash. Qin Ming knew that even if he could kill a few Patrollers now, it would only invite bloody retaliation, as there were other members and even other teams. If anything happened to these men here, the entire Twin Tree Village would be implicated. Naturally, he wouldn't say or do anything reckless. He stood up and joined Xu Yueping and Yang Yongqing in seeing them off.

Once the men disappeared into the dim wilderness, Yang Yongqing fumed, "I feel so stifled!"

"Can we report this to the higher-ups?" Qin Ming asked.

"What fault can you pick out? According to the rules, we should provide four to eight Black Moon plants. The Patrollers only asked for the minimum of four this time. You say the seeds are mutated, but how can we prove it right now? They look exactly the same. We only suspected it based on last year's poor harvest from the fire-fields, combined with the personalities and usual actions of Feng Yi'an and his group. We inferred they successfully cultivated mutated seeds this time."

Old Man Liu continued, "There's also a very important reason: how could they dare to act this way if they hadn't already smoothed things over with the right connections?"

Xu Yueping added, "The connections left behind by a highly respected Patroller are enough for their descendants to squander for ten years."

In the end, Feng Yi'an and his group's feigned sincerity in visiting was merely to press Xu Yueping to continue planting the medicine. They didn't directly threaten them; they were very polite and gentle. But in this situation, their words and actions were more egregious than outright intimidation.

Qin Ming exhaled a breath of turbid air and declared, "They are going too far!"

He then asked, "Is the Black Moon medicine very important?"

Xu Yueping nodded solemnly. "After mutation, its value is extremely high. Long-term consumption offers a slight chance for people to experience a Second Rebirth."

Old Man Liu said, "As Patrollers, who spend years traversing the deep mountains and likely encountering high-level beings, who wouldn't want to advance further? Just like me, an old man, I also wish to revive once more! Second Rebirth can extend lifespan and restore some youthful vigor. Who wouldn't desire that?" He spoke of the reasons and motivations behind the degradation of some Patrollers, then added, "But people must have a bottom line. How can they be fit to be Patrollers when they act like this? They are even more harmful than mountain monsters!"

"Second Rebirth..." Qin Ming mused, lost in thought.

Xu Yueping patted his shoulder. "You definitely can. According to local records, the fastest of those with a 'Golden Foundation' among the Reborn experienced their Second Rebirth in less than two months."

The villagers who went into the mountains today were all stained with blood. Several were severely injured, and it was uncertain if they would survive. Crying could be heard from many households.

Xu Yueping went door-to-door to visit, helping with treatment, suppressing his anger, his chest rising and falling heavily. The middle-aged man, Wang Qinglin, lay on the *kang*, still unconscious. Despite being a Reborn, his injuries were more severe than anyone else's. After Old Man Liu reset his bones and wiped the blood from his hands, he said, "Broken bones pierced his internal organs. If it weren't for the vigorous life force of people like us, this would be a fatal injury."

Qin Ming observed carefully, still believing that someone had acted while wearing a Blood Bear's hide. Every household was filled with sorrow. Some children quietly wiped away tears. The sense of accomplishment and joy from the adults' hunting spoils over the past two days had vanished. Some villagers had also encountered mutated Snow Apes, with horrifying lacerations on their bodies.

"Two years ago, the Patrollers seemed to have raised one," Yang Yongqing whispered. Xu Yueping's face was grim, while Old Man Liu sighed repeatedly.

Qin Ming walked back home, feeling a blockage in his heart, wanting to do something. The only good news was that Lu Ze had woken up. Given his physical condition, he shouldn't suffer any lasting complications. Qin Ming didn't tell him the hidden truth, fearing he might become too agitated and hinder his recovery.

"Brother Lu, how many people are in a Patroller team?" Qin Ming asked, also wanting to understand the strength of their members.

"Between eight and twelve," Lu Ze informed him. The team guarding their area currently had nine members, with only the leader being a Second Reborn—and very strong. Fu Entao was the leader's name; he rarely appeared in public. Lu Ze sighed, "For many, striving with all their might, reaching the finish line, is solely for the sake of obtaining a First Rebirth. As for a Second Rebirth, they dare not even dream of it; it's an insurmountable boundary."

Qin Ming said, "It seems that leader can completely suppress the other members."

Lu Ze nodded. "During First Rebirth, physical strength improves significantly. Second Rebirth, however, doubles that improvement based on the initial boost."

"In our area, a First Reborn's limit is lifting five hundred *jin*. How was that leader, Fu, back then?" Qin Ming probed for information.

Lu Ze recalled carefully. "Back then, Fu Entao was still some way off the ceiling." He looked at Qin Ming. "You underwent Rebirth during the golden age, and coupled with your foundation that breaks limits, your Second Rebirth is destined to be very powerful."

Qin Ming now had a clear idea. In terms of physical prowess alone, even after his Second Rebirth, Fu Entao was still not as strong as Qin Ming was after his First Rebirth. He stood up to leave, telling Lu Ze to rest easy and not worry about anything else, as he was there.

***

He returned to his own courtyard and began practicing some combat techniques. Living a livelihood in the dangerous mountains, he naturally knew many such methods. Even before Rebirth, he could cleave a green brick with his bare hand. Now, he was naturally even more formidable. With a sweeping whip-kick, he snapped a tree stump the thickness of a thigh with a loud *bang*. When he employed his "wild techniques," practiced for years, his spirit became highly concentrated. Ripples like fragmented gold appeared in his flesh and blood, and a slight bump from his body caused the tree stump to disintegrate.

After dinner, Qin Ming went to Xu Yueping's home.

"Uncle Xu, are you still brooding?"

"They're going too far," Xu Yueping said, feeling a painful blockage in his heart.

"Quickly, persuade your uncle. He hasn't even eaten dinner," Xu Yueping's wife said, a worried look on her face.

"Auntie, leave it to me," Qin Ming said, entering the house and sitting down. After his combat practice at home, he was now calm and composed. He began discussing with Xu Yueping what they should do next.

"You want me to agree to them?" Xu Yueping suddenly looked up. He was very angry, his face slightly cold. "Do you know the consequences? Next year, the fire-fields will suffer severe crop failures, leading to famine!"

"Uncle, please listen to me first," Qin Ming quickly interjected, genuinely afraid of angering him further.

"Speak!"

"It's still early for early spring. What harm is there in agreeing to them for now? If something unexpected happens in the meantime, like if they all die during their mountain-sweeping operation; or if heaven itself can't stand them and they're wiped out by mountain monsters tonight; or if the mountain's magnetic field fluctuates violently and the Patrollers all go insane..."

Seeing him seriously cursing them, Xu Yueping stared at him with a strange look in his eyes. According to Qin Ming, if something were to happen to those men and the higher-ups came to investigate, they might suspect anyone who had conflicts with the Patrollers. Without clearing their names beforehand, they might end up in a lot of trouble.

Xu Yueping was displeased. "How could any of those 'what-ifs' happen? You're overthinking it."

Qin Ming's expression turned serious. "Uncle Xu, my point is, let's agree for now and wait for unforeseen circumstances." He explained that the seeds could first be thrown into the fire spring, then retrieved after the Patrollers left. Or, afterward, they could be coated with a special transparent mineral glue found in the mountains to separate them from the fire spring. Qin Ming added, "Currently, every household is short on food. We must first ensure the villagers can hunt safely in the mountains."

Xu Yueping sighed, acknowledging that Qin Ming had a point. If they couldn't survive the present difficulties, what was the use of talking about next year's famine? "What do we do after this period of delay?" He still had a headache. Feng Yi'an and his group were ruthless; they would surely exact terrible revenge afterward.

Qin Ming's gaze was firm. "Uncle, in a while, I might also undergo Second Rebirth. Then we can talk to them."

"They should have someone backing them," Xu Yueping said, rubbing his temples. Suddenly, as if remembering something, he asked, "Little Qin, after your First Rebirth, can your arms, when exerting full strength, reach the limit of six hundred *jin*?"

"Yes."

Xu Yueping abruptly stood up. "That achievement would be outstanding even in the distant Scarlet Cloud City." A smile slowly spread across his face. "Tomorrow, come with me to Silvervine Town."

Qin Ming felt uncomfortable under his gaze. "Uncle Xu, let's first solve our current predicament."

"Feng Yi'an told me that if we change our minds, we can find him in town. Besides, when we go to Silvervine Town, perhaps a good marriage awaits you."

"Huh?" Qin Ming was astonished.

Xu Yueping explained that a mysterious old noble had moved from afar and was living in seclusion in the town, and he had a very beautiful daughter of marriageable age. Qin Ming immediately shook his head. "Uncle Xu, let's not bring humiliation upon ourselves."

In the past, Xu Yueping wouldn't have dared to visit, but the other party had put out word that they wouldn't consider family background for a son-in-law, only the person themselves. Qin Ming's Golden Foundation was astonishingly deep, marking him as exceptionally gifted even in that distant, bright city. This gave Xu Yueping confidence. He whispered, "If this marriage can be arranged, the threat from the Patrollers could be resolved." Qin Ming objected, but Xu Yueping forcefully pulled him along and drank with him for the entire evening.

The next day, before the night fog had fully dissipated, Xu Yueping came to find Qin Ming to set off.

"Uncle Xu, isn't it a bit too early?"

"I know you might still have some reluctance right now. It's fine; once we're there, you won't need to go in immediately. I'll go to the old noble's home first to gauge the situation." Xu Yueping felt that if it succeeded, it would be for the best, and if not, it wouldn't have much impact. Trying their luck there was better than doing nothing at all.

In the early morning, the sky was still very dim. On both sides of the road stretched dense, oppressive forests, and the cries of wild beasts and strange birds could be heard intermittently from afar. Qin Ming and Xu Yueping trudged through the deep snow, heading towards Silvervine Town, over ten *li* away.

Halfway there, they abruptly stopped. A brilliant red light suddenly burst forth from the distant mountain forest, piercing through the night fog and illuminating the vicinity. Large numbers of "Crimson Butterflies" appeared, dancing gracefully, staining the night sky red. They were everywhere, flying in all directions.
