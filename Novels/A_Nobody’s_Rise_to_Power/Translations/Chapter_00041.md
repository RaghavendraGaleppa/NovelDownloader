# Chapter 41: The King of Feng'an

The people of Feng'an Village lived on this land.

Most of them had never traveled more than ten miles from their homes.

Living in such isolation, their horizons were extremely limited.

Therefore, to them, the Lord of Feng'an was "Heaven."

"Heaven" was sitting in a pearwood armchair, with someone holding a sunshade behind him.

Lord Zhang held a cup of tea in his hand, taking a sip from time to time to moisten his throat.

The weather in late March and early April in Longshang was naturally not comparable to that of Jiangnan.

In Jiangnan, the flowers were already blazing like fire by February, but here, the vegetation had only just begun to sprout green.

Sitting here, the gentle spring breeze blowing, it wasn't uncomfortable, though the sunlight was a bit intense.

The village head, Lai Gulu, cautiously approached Zhang Yunyi and whispered, "Lord Zhang, we originally followed the Second Master. Now that our estate has been transferred to the Main Branch, will they treat us like their own sons? The fact that the Second Steward of the Main Branch is here for an inspection suggests his intentions may not be good."

Zhang Yunyi smiled faintly. "And so?"

Lai Gulu grew anxious. "Lord Zhang, he's clearly here to crack down on us!"

Zhang Yunyi wasn't the least bit flustered. He had greased the palms of everyone from top to bottom. What could Yang Can, a little clerk with no backing, possibly do?

However, the things he did—bowing and scraping, currying favor—were naturally not something he could share with these subordinates who looked up to him as their heaven.

"Pah!" Lord Zhang casually spat out a piece of tea leaf. "Why panic? A new emperor brings new courtiers. Isn't that inevitable?"

Lai Gulu hesitated. "But, Lord Zhang, does that mean we should just sit here and wait for death?"

Seeing that the others were also looking at him with wide, anxious eyes, Zhang Yunyi didn't want to make them too panicked, lest they lose their composure.

After a moment of thought, he said, "We are in the middle of the spring plowing season. If this Second Steward pushes too hard, what will be the result? Forget about what will happen to our Feng'an Village, the other five major estates are all watching. Will any of them be able to focus on spring plowing then? If all six major estates have a poor harvest this autumn..."

Zhang Yunyi raised his eyelids to glance at Lai Gulu, then swept his gaze calmly over the other stewards. His demeanor was indescribably composed.

"What does the Clan Head want? Submission, obedience, and the assurance that these assets will change hands smoothly. What does our young mistress want? A bountiful harvest, the capital to secure her footing in the Main Branch. As long as we satisfy the higher-ups on these two points, what do you have to worry about?"

Although Zhang Yunyi only hinted at the core of the matter, Lai Gulu and the others suddenly saw the light.

That's right. The thousands of acres of land were in our hands.

This is our bargaining chip; this is the source of our confidence.

If this Steward Yang pushes too hard, we just need to make a few subtle moves, and these thousands of acres of land will have a poor harvest.

If we get ruthless enough, it wouldn't be impossible to make sure not a single grain is reaped.

By then, we would certainly be finished, but with such a huge loss, how would the Main Branch make up for it?

Once thousands of acres of land have a poor harvest, thousands of mouths on this land are waiting to be fed. Can the Main Branch bear that responsibility?

More importantly, if something like this happens right after the estate has been handed over to the Main Branch, the Second Master would have ample reason to challenge the Clan Head.

And this is just talking about the Feng'an estate alone. If the first estate to be inspected is treated so harshly, what would the other estates and pastures think? If all the other estates ran into trouble...

Thinking of this, the faces of the stewards all broke into relaxed smiles.

Zhang Yunyi handed his teacup to the side, and a young servant in blue immediately stepped forward to take it with both hands, then stepped back.

Zhang Yunyi leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, and said slowly, "However, this is ultimately a strategy of mutual destruction. We don't want to see it, and the Main Branch certainly doesn't want to see it either. So, don't overthink it. For this new Second Steward, we just need to maintain sufficient courtesy."

The field supervisors, granary overseers, canal chiefs, and mill masters all voiced their agreement.

The Lord was their heaven. Since the Lord was so calm, they were at ease.

Finally, at the end of the vast, flat fertile plain, a dozen or so fine horses appeared.

The moment Zhang Yunyi saw them, he immediately rose from his seat. The sunshade holder, the tea server, and the chair bearer immediately took all their gear and withdrew.

Zhang Yunyi stepped forward to meet them on the main road. It hadn't rained the past two days, so the ground was a bit dry.

In the distance, the group of riders was galloping fast. Their hooves kicked up a light trail of dust on the road.

"Zhang Yunyi, the Lord of Feng'an Village, along with all the stewards of the village, greets the Second Steward of the Main Branch, greets Master Li, and greets Miss Qingmei. You three have had a long journey."

Zhang Yunyi not only recognized Accountant Li, but he had also already paid his respects and recognized Yang Can and Qingmei.

However, hearing the order of his address, Qingmei felt a little uncomfortable. When did Master Li get placed before this young lady? I am the Deputy Second Steward...呸! I am the Second Steward, internal and external, external and internal, okay?

Yang Can leaped from his horse, his feet barely touching the dust, his movements extremely agile.

"Hahaha, Lord Zhang, we meet again."

Yang Can stepped forward with a smile, his face beaming. "It is the middle of the spring plowing season. I hope my unannounced visit isn't disturbing the estate's farm work."

"Not at all, not at all. The weather in Longshang isn't like that in the Central Plains. Although it's already April, it's not yet the time for sowing in Longshang."

Zhang Yunyi was also all smiles. "Except for the few hundred acres of winter wheat that have just turned green, the rest of the fields are just being plowed. What little delay could there be?"

As he spoke, Zhang Yunyi stepped forward and took Yang Can's arm, turning to face the estate's stewards.

"Since our estate was transferred from the Second Master to the Main Branch, the Main Branch has yet to send a single person down. The people working below are all uneasy. Now that you, Steward Yang, are here, we have a backbone to rely on. Everyone is more than happy."

"Yes, yes!" the group of estate stewards echoed in unison. Yang Can smiled, but he naturally didn't take it seriously.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, Zhang Yunyi introduced the key personnel from both sides.

Yang Can said to Zhang Yunyi, "I'll trouble you, Lord Zhang, and all of you. I think we can dismount and walk into the village together."

Zhang Yunyi naturally had no objection, and the group proceeded toward the village.

As soon as they entered the village, Yang Can began to observe carefully.

Although this village in Longshang was not as prosperous as those in the Central Plains, as an important estate of the Yu family, it still appeared quite substantial.

The village's scattered houses of varying heights included large brick houses and thatched earthen huts interspersed among them.

From the villagers' clothing, some were dressed decently, while others wore worn-out clothes, but there were very few who looked emaciated.

The northwest was a harsh, cold land, and life was more difficult than in the Central Plains. Those who could survive in such an environment naturally wouldn't be too sickly or weak. Such people had long been eliminated by nature.

Therefore, the villagers, especially the young and strong, mostly had fierce appearances. Some were tall and burly, others lean and tough.

These were all excellent laborers. If you put a knife in their hands, they would also be excellent soldiers.

However, when they saw the humblely smiling Zhang Yunyi, their faces filled with awe. They obediently stepped back to the roadside and bowed slightly, only daring to raise their heads after Yang Can's group had passed.

Just like Cheng Dakuan, the "Leopard's Head," with his fierce martial arts, he was enough to be a famous swordsman in Longshang, and a local hero in the Central Plains. Yet, he was willing to serve the Yu family. When he made a mistake, he would be fearful; when punished, he would have no thought of rebellion.

Just like a wolf pack to its alpha. However, the alpha of this estate did not rely on his own strong physique, but on the power and wealth he controlled.

Yang Can looked around the village casually and asked, "Lord Zhang, how many people are there in our Feng'an Village?"

Zhang Yunyi had already done his homework in advance, so he answered without hesitation.

"Steward Yang, our Feng'an Village has 9,400 acres of land, with a total of 273 farming households. The agricultural population is 1,478 people. There are also 121 households of blacksmiths, weavers, and brewers, with a population of 530. These small shops and workshops serve both internal and external needs. In the village, there are also 218 servants. Adding in my family and the families of the many stewards, the entire village has a total of 2,331 people."

Yang Can's eyes flashed. He then asked, "If there were a war, how many private troops could Feng'an Village dispatch?"

Private troops were a combination of farming and soldiering. They could be mobilized for combat during wartime, received military training during the agricultural off-season, but still engaged in agricultural production in their daily lives.

Zhang Yunyi said proudly, "To be honest with you, Steward Yang, Longshang has a fierce and martial populace. Men, women, old and young, all can be soldiers. If we are only talking about private troops, my Feng'an Village has a standing force of 300. If necessary, we can muster 400."

Lai Gulu added, "Steward Yang, the 300 men our Lord mentioned are all capable of matching the elite soldiers of the Central Plains' northern and southern dynasties."

Yang Can couldn't help but nod slightly upon hearing this.

A large estate could mobilize three to four hundred private troops at any time; that was no small number. The talk of hundreds of thousands or even millions of troops was an exaggeration found in storybooks.

When the Western Jin Dynasty conquered Wu, the total number of water and land combat troops at the front was less than 100,000. During the Battle of Fei River in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, the total mobilized force was also less than 100,000. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period, a small state like the Western Liang had a peak total of only 20,000 combat troops.

The Yu family, if they were to mobilize all their private troops, could rival that small state of Western Liang.

The most important thing was that the people of Longshang, due to the harsh environment, had a风气 of practicing martial arts. The villagers often went hunting, and the estate would regularly organize collective hunts to kill wild boars that destroyed crops and wolf packs that harmed people.

Therefore, the quality of their individual soldiers could be said to be extremely high. In this way, even if their numbers were a bit smaller, this force could not be underestimated.

The two great empires of the Central Plains were indeed in a standoff and had no time to look elsewhere. However, they had never attempted to conquer the Eight Clans of Longshang, probably because they knew this was not an easy bone to chew.

The group continued forward and gradually reached the center of the village.

A massive wubao, or fortified manor, stood prominently here.

Feng'an Village, Feng'an Fort. This was a square wubao built with rammed earth and bricked walls. The walls were a full two zhang high, with watchtowers at the four corners, and a "moat" on the outside.

They had diverted water from the Long River, which flowed around the fort before continuing into the distance.

This was the upper reaches of the Long River. The water source was not affected by the Loess Plateau, so the water quality was extremely clear and a deep blue.

Yang Can was stunned. This was completely different from the villages and landlords' estates he had imagined.

This... was practically a castle
