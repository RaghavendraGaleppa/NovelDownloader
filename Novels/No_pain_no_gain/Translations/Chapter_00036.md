# Chapter 36: Han Li's Stirred Emotions  

Watching the mournful expression on Daoist Qingwen's face, Han Zhen sneered inwardly.  

"What a pity then. We'll take our leave now, Fellow Daoist Qingwen."  

Everyone had their own fate, and Han Zhen certainly wouldn't waste words warning these people about Qingwen's dubious nature. Not only would there be no benefit, but he might also provoke the so-called small group to turn against him.  

After Han Zhen left with Han Li, the others began chattering about the Luo couple's affairs, and some were curious about Han Zhen. After all, a cultivator at the eleventh level of Qi Refining was considered a formidable expert in their eyes, especially one so young.  

"This humble Daoist has invited Fellow Daoist Han to join us several times. Even on the day the Luo couple met their demise, Fellow Daoist Han ignored my invitation..."  

After hearing this, several people expressed dissatisfaction with Han Zhen's aloofness and arrogance. They were all rogue cultivators—what was there to put on airs about?  

But when Daoist Qingwen mentioned that two years ago, Han Zhen had only been at the eighth level of Qi Refining, they immediately fell silent.  

This meant he was practically halfway into the ranks of the Seven Great Sects. He indeed had the right to look down on ordinary rogue cultivators.  

Of course, Han Zhen was unaware that after he left with Han Li, Qingwen would slander him like this, making it seem as though he bore no responsibility for the Luo couple's deaths even if he hadn't been present.  

Meanwhile, Han Li seemed to have undergone some changes. Not only did he remain as cautious as ever, but he also appeared more composed and mature.  

Had something happened between him and the Three Beauties of the Mo Manor after the cold poison was no longer a threat?  

Han Zhen decided to interrogate Han Li later.  

Han Li followed behind Han Zhen, pondering their brief exchange.  

He sensed something amiss, but with too little information, he couldn't pinpoint the key issue. However, he could tell that Han Zhen's attitude toward Daoist Qingwen was cold, even hostile.  

So Han Li memorized the appearances of Qingwen and the others, resolving to stay far away from them, especially that Daoist Qingwen.  

As they walked through the square's winding paths, Han Li looked around curiously.  

Though he maintained the same calm and composed demeanor as Han Zhen, the truth was he had nothing to trade. He had come to the Tai Nan Gathering purely to broaden his horizons.  

Many items on the stalls caught his eye—even something as simple as stacks of blank talisman paper was something he desperately needed.  

But compared to these, he was even more eager to learn about the common knowledge and rules of the cultivation world.  

If not for Han Zhen paving the way ahead, he might have agreed to join that Daoist's group earlier.  

---  

Rather than engaging in empty pleasantries with strangers, Han Li naturally chose to ask Han Zhen directly.  

Finally, after passing through the market area of the square, Han Zhen led Han Li to the pavilion he had rented.  

During the Tai Nan Gathering, pavilion rentals had skyrocketed due to high demand, but Han Zhen was no longer the frugal man who had to pinch every spirit stone two years ago.  

"This talisman is the key to the pavilion. Give it a try," Han Zhen said, handing the talisman to Han Li.  

The talisman only granted entry and exit privileges and couldn't control the formation enveloping the pavilion.  

Just as Han Zhen had done before, Han Li curiously poked at the cyan light barrier before pressing the talisman against it.  

With all his belongings safely stored in his storage pouch, Han Zhen confidently gave Han Li a tour of the pavilion, explaining the functions of each area before they returned to the reception room on the first floor.  

"This is no longer of use to me," Han Zhen said as soon as they sat down, placing a thin book on the table.  

Han Li stared blankly at the cover, which read *Evergreen Art*, then flipped through it—it contained all thirteen layers of the complete technique.  

"This... it's too valuable, isn't it?" Han Li had seen stalls selling spells and talisman techniques during his walk, with prices starting at ten spirit stones.  

On their way to the pavilion, Han Li had asked what spirit stones were—yet he didn't even have half a stone to his name.  

"Actually, the foundational cultivation techniques we once desperately sought are the cheapest things in the cultivation world."  

Han Zhen took out a white porcelain bottle, which Han Li recognized instantly—it was the same kind he used to store Golden Marrow Pills and Yellow Dragon Pills.  

"*Evergreen Art* can be exchanged for just two of these pills."  

Han Li now understood why Han Zhen had urged him in his letter to prepare more pills that could enhance spiritual power. A single pill was worth one spirit stone!  

Thinking about how he had been consuming pills like candy to boost his cultivation, Han Li couldn't help but feel a pang of regret—how many spirit stones had he wasted?  

"How is everything at home and the Seven Mysteries Sect?" Han Zhen asked as he brewed a pot of spirit tea.  

"When I left, my younger sister had just gotten married..."  

Han Li then mentioned the matter Han Zhen was most concerned about—his third uncle's lineage.  

He briefly recounted his third uncle's situation before he left home. Though the medical texts left by Doctor Mo didn't contain any relevant prescriptions, they had found one in Jiayuan City. Combined with the effects of century-old spirit herbs, his third uncle should have had children by now.  

As for the Seven Mysteries Sect, a few months after Han Zhen's departure, it was said that the upper echelons of the Wild Wolf Gang had provoked an immortal and were completely wiped out.  

At this point, Han Li glanced at Han Zhen, knowing full well this was his doing.  

After the Seven Mysteries Sect absorbed the Wild Wolf Gang's territory, they showed no intention of further expansion.  

Finally, Han Li came to the matter Han Zhen was most curious about—the Mo family.  

Suddenly, Han Li became evasive, deliberately glossing over his interactions with the Mo family's young ladies.  

After a brief silence, he abruptly asked, "Brother Zhen, is there any way to quickly determine if someone has spiritual roots?"  

"Which young lady of the Mo Manor is it?" Han Zhen countered.  

He secretly speculated—it must still be Mo Fengwu!  

Han Li gave Han Zhen a puzzled look before explaining it was just a friend he had met at the Mo Manor.  

Studying Han Li's expression, Han Zhen noticed none of the flushed excitement he had shown after reading Doctor Mo's will.  

Tsk tsk, it seemed exposure to beauties had indeed matured him.  

Seeing Han Li's tight-lipped demeanor, Han Zhen didn't press further and instead explained how to detect spiritual roots in mortals.  

"It's simple—just channel your spiritual power into their body."  

Starting from the basics of cultivation realms and spiritual roots, Han Li was astonished to learn that Core Formation cultivators could live for centuries.  

After explaining the Tai Nan Gathering and the Ascension Assembly, Han Zhen took out a storage pouch and tossed it to Han Li, also teaching him how to use it.  

When Han Li probed the pouch with his spiritual sense, he was stunned to find two hundred low-grade spirit stones and several talismans inside.  

"Brother Zhen, these are too valuable!" Han Li hesitated, unsure whether to accept.  

From what he had seen at the stalls, rogue cultivators would argue fiercely over a single spirit stone.  

"Don't overthink it. Compared to how quickly I earn spirit stones, this is nothing to me," Han Zhen said confidently.  

Of course, this gesture had its purpose.  

Han Li stopped refusing—these were precisely what he needed most right now.  

"I'll repay you with spirit herbs in the future," he thought to himself.  

After asking a few more questions, Han Li could no longer suppress his eagerness to purchase the items he had eyed earlier.  

Now that he had these two hundred spirit stones, plus the pills and herbs he carried, he no longer felt the restraint he had upon first arriving at Tai Nan Valley.  

Truly, wealth emboldened the poor.
