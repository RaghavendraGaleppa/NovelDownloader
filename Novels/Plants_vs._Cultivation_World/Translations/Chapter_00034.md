# Chapter 34: The Spirit Planter Inheritance  

Through Zhao Qiancheng's explanation, Gu Mo gained a general understanding of the Spirit Planter profession. If spirit farmers were ordinary agricultural workers, then Spirit Planters were akin to expert professors at agricultural research institutes. The former were responsible for cultivation and production, while the latter researched higher-yielding crops.  

Additionally, Spirit Planters also studied and cultivated various exotic spirit plants. This was particularly important for Gu Mo. If he could become a Spirit Planter, he wouldn’t have to worry about his Peashooter attracting undue attention. After all, it was perfectly normal for a Spirit Planter to develop novel spirit plants.  

Even the Sunflower could be easily explained away under the guise of a Spirit Planter, as long as the effects of Sun Essence weren’t exposed.  

With this in mind, Gu Mo looked at Zhao Qiancheng with eager anticipation. The fact that the latter had suddenly brought up the Spirit Planter profession suggested there was more to come.  

"I have an opportunity here that could allow you to become a Spirit Planter. Consider it a reward for your record-breaking yield," Zhao Qiancheng said with a smile. Rewards that didn’t involve actual money or resources were the easiest to give away.  

"Thank you, Steward Zhao!"  

Overjoyed by Zhao Qiancheng’s affirmation, Gu Mo expressed his gratitude.  

"I’m only giving you the opportunity. Whether you can actually become a Spirit Planter depends on your own efforts," Zhao Qiancheng waved his hand dismissively. While Spirit Planters weren’t as renowned as alchemists, artifact forgers, formation masters, or talisman experts, the difficulty of mastering the profession was no less. Without sufficient talent, breaking into the field was extremely challenging.  

At present, the entire Qinglu Sect had only two first-tier Spirit Planters. The main reason for their scarcity and low cultivation level was that the sect lacked a proper inheritance system for Spirit Planters.  

For the four major professions—alchemy, artifact forging, formations, and talismans—the Qinglu Sect had complete inheritances up to the fourth tier. Other professions, such as beast taming and puppetry, had up to third-tier inheritances. Only the Spirit Planter path was missing.  

To address this, the sect master had leveraged his connections to invite a wandering third-tier Spirit Planter to become an honorary elder of the Qinglu Sect. This ended the sect’s history of lacking Spirit Planters and enabled self-sufficiency in spirit seeds.  

However, as an honorary elder, the Spirit Planter was not a permanent member of the sect and would eventually leave. To mitigate this, the Qinglu Sect had paid a considerable price to secure his agreement to impart some of his knowledge.  

The reward Zhao Qiancheng was offering Gu Mo was an opportunity to attend the third-tier Spirit Planter’s lectures. However, this opportunity wasn’t exclusive.  

The elder only taught the lessons—how many attended or how much they learned was entirely up to them. Thus, this opportunity wasn’t particularly rare. Inner sect disciples and outer sect disciples from the Spirit Planting Hall could all receive it.  

---  

As the superior profession to spirit farming, the Spirit Planting Hall had secured more spots and opportunities than other peaks. History had also proven that spirit farmers had a higher chance of becoming Spirit Planters.  

Over the years, two individuals had successfully become official Spirit Planters, both from the Spirit Planting Hall. Though the number was small, it was still a result that satisfied the Qinglu Sect—at least the seeds of Spirit Planters had been sown. And in the future, more might emerge.  

Though Gu Mo had obtained the qualification to attend the elder’s lectures, there was no fixed schedule for when they would be held.  

After all, the elder was not just a third-tier Spirit Planter but also a Golden Core cultivator. For cultivators of this level, even a minor retreat could last years.  

For them, cultivation was the top priority, and teaching had to take a backseat. However, based on what Gu Mo had learned from Mai Yunfa, the elder was expected to emerge from seclusion within the next few years, after which the lectures would commence.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, you’re quite lucky. You only need to wait a few years for the lectures, whereas I’ve been waiting for many years already," Mai Yunfa said with a sigh as he piloted his flying sword.  

Mai Yunfa had obtained the qualification to attend the lectures long ago, but the elder had been in seclusion since his last teaching session, forcing him to wait until now.  

"Senior Brother Mai, with all these years of refinement, you might have an even smoother path to becoming a Spirit Planter," Gu Mo said with a smile.  

"You’re right!"  

Mai Yunfa nodded in agreement. The deeper one’s expertise in spirit farming, the higher the chances of becoming a Spirit Planter—this was something the elder had personally stated.  

Thus, Mai Yunfa hadn’t been idle during his wait. He had worked diligently on his spirit farming skills and was confident he could become a full-fledged Spirit Planter.  

"We’re here!"  

As they spoke, Mai Yunfa descended with his flying sword. However, their landing spot wasn’t near Gu Mo’s spirit fields outside the valley but rather the outer disciple district—where Gu Mo had stayed before joining the Spirit Planting Hall.  

The reason for coming here was another task assigned by Zhao Qiancheng. A new batch of outer disciples was about to choose their respective peaks, and Gu Mo, as the Spirit Planting Hall’s poster boy, was naturally called upon to help recruit.  

Thus, Gu Mo had accompanied Mai Yunfa to attract more outer disciples and develop the spirit fields outside the valley.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, the recruitment task is in your hands now," Mai Yunfa said as they arrived at the Personnel Hall, delegating the responsibility to Gu Mo.  

On the way, Gu Mo had suggested that Mai Yunfa take the initiative in recruitment. Unlike the alchemy, artifact forging, formation, and talisman peaks—which could afford to wait for disciples to come to them—the Spirit Planting Hall lacked that luxury.  

Gu Mo’s suggestion had been accepted, but Mai Yunfa, as an outer sect disciple, found it beneath him to actively recruit.  

"Understood!"  

Gu Mo nodded and left the Personnel Hall. As an outer disciple, he had no qualms about approaching others. He was well aware that Steward Zhao had given him so many benefits precisely to attract more disciples to the Spirit Planting Hall.  

If the recruitment efforts failed, the benefits he received in the future might dwindle.  

"Junior Brother, care to learn about the Spirit Planting Hall?" Gu Mo stopped a disciple about to enter the Personnel Hall and began his pitch.  

"Sorry, I’m planning to join the Alchemy Peak!" The newly promoted Qi Refining disciple was startled by the sudden approach.  

"If you join the Spirit Planting Hall now, you’ll receive outer sect disciple treatment. Wouldn’t you like to consider it?" Gu Mo smiled warmly.  

"Are you… Senior Brother Gu Mo?" The disciple suddenly looked at Gu Mo in surprise.  

Now it was Gu Mo’s turn to be stunned. But he quickly realized why—the Spirit Planting Hall had long since spread his story among the outer disciples. Many newcomers already knew about Gu Mo joining the hall and receiving outer sect treatment.  

"That’s right!"  

Gu Mo nodded.  

"It really is Senior Brother Gu Mo!" As soon as he confirmed it, nearby outer disciples swarmed over, clamoring to ask if he had truly received outer sect treatment.
