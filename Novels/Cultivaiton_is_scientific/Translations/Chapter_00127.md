# Chapter 127: Starlight  

The black sea stretched endlessly as Li Shimin flew close to the water's surface. The Spirit Turtle Shield emitted a faint glow, enveloping his entire body and allowing him to move forward at full speed without worry.  

Beside him, the main soul of the "Soul Control and Division Technique" had grown nearly three times larger than before. Upon closer inspection, it now had the contours of a body and head, with faint traces of facial features visible on the head.  

This was the result of the main soul devouring the remnants of the Foundation Establishment cultivator's soul left at the explosion site. Previously, Li Shimin had been frustrated by the main soul's weakness, but now he no longer needed to worry about it.  

As he flew, he received the results of IBMz15's analysis of the island's formation.  

The Holy Ice Sect's outpost, located dangerously close to the Heavenly Sea Sect's territory, had employed a meticulously crafted formation that incorporated many of the sect's key techniques. This greatly expanded IBMz15's knowledge of formations. After a brief period of study, IBMz15 had successfully replicated the island's formation.  

The ability to replicate the formation was partly due to IBMz15's formidable computational power and partly because Li Shimin had entered the cave dwelling and used his spiritual sense to collect sufficient data for analysis.  

As Li Shimin absorbed the new formation knowledge transmitted by IBMz15, he unwittingly entered a state of enlightenment.  

His knowledge of formations primarily came from the inheritance given by Yin Shilan, which provided the most comprehensive systematic foundation. Their subsequent exchanges had also benefited him greatly, as Yin Shilan's questions often touched upon key aspects of the Heavenly Sea Sect's formations. Though restricted by sect rules, the insights she shared still allowed Li Shimin to glimpse the essence of the sect's formations.  

Another source of his knowledge was the Cloud Merchant Guild, which provided a vast but disorganized collection of formation fragments. Despite their lack of structure, these fragments contributed to his unique understanding of formations.  

With the addition of the Holy Ice Sect's formation knowledge from IBMz15, the most critical gaps in his system were filled.  

In his mind, a dazzling expanse of starlight began to form.  

Each point of light represented a fragment of his knowledge. Though the starlight's range was limited, it formed a self-contained celestial sphere. Every piece of his formation knowledge shimmered within, bringing unprecedented clarity to his thoughts.  

He finally understood why formations could be so complex. The most powerful formation masters had no assistance like IBMz15—they relied solely on their own calculations and analysis to create formations as intricate as sect-protecting grand arrays.  

Now, this starlight provided the answer. All his formation knowledge had fused seamlessly within it. As long as a problem fell within the scope of his starlight, he could effortlessly substitute experience for calculation and arrive at the solution directly.  

In this state of enlightenment, he didn't need to consult IBMz15. He felt that for any formation he had studied, he could now understand every node's data without assistance.  

If he wished, he could analyze every detail of a formation through experience alone.  

His consciousness wandered freely through his starlight. Each time he touched a point of light, new insights emerged, as if he had become one with the starlight itself.  

The starlight was him, and he was the starlight.  

Time passed indeterminably until exhaustion pulled him from his enlightenment.  

When he opened his eyes, his gaze shimmered with the illusory glow of starlight.  

"Eagle Beak Island!" he murmured, realizing he had returned to the island's vicinity under the cover of night. His subconscious had guided him back while he was immersed in enlightenment.  

He longed to see Yin Shilan immediately and ask her about the starlight in his mind. But given the late hour, he would have to wait until noon the next day to contact her via his identity jade slip.  

He entered the underground space through the submerged passage.  

He had grown increasingly fond of staying underground. The cave dwelling above was merely a facade—even if the Holy Ice Sect came searching, they would only find an empty cave after breaking through the small mountain-protecting formation.  

With surveillance set up in the underground space, he could detect intruders early and prepare accordingly.  

"If two tons couldn't kill a Golden Core cultivator, then twenty tons. If twenty tons won't work, then two hundred tons!" he muttered to himself, reflecting on the recent operation.  

Truthfully, he had been terrified. He had buried two tons of solid explosives beneath the cave dwelling, and at the moment of detonation, Elder Bai and the Foundation Establishment cultivator had been standing directly above them.  

They had endured the full force of the explosion—perhaps even more, given the confined space and the formation's amplification effect.  

The more constrained the explosion, the greater its destructive power.  

Yet Elder Bai had still escaped, albeit in a disheveled state. Given the resilience of Golden Core cultivators, Li Shimin doubted the injuries were severe.  

"Let's see what's in the storage pouch," he muttered, pushing aside thoughts of the unimaginable power of Golden Core cultivators. He retrieved the pitch-black storage pouch.  

When he channeled spiritual energy into it, there was no response.  

"Broken?" he wondered, realizing it was a likely possibility. The two-ton explosion should have reduced it to ashes—its survival was sheer luck.  

Still unwilling to give up, he switched to spiritual sense. This time, it worked effortlessly.  

The storage pouch had a capacity of about fifty cubic meters, but its contents were fewer than expected.  

A longsword, a shield, a small bell, a wooden flying boat, over five thousand low-grade spirit stones, around five hundred mid-grade spirit stones, and a few medicine bottles.  

There were no jade slips or miscellaneous items. The owner had evidently been fastidious, keeping everything neatly arranged with no unnecessary clutter.  

Li Shimin picked up the longsword. As a novice sword cultivator who practiced the "Sword Control Art," he was particularly interested in blades.  

"This isn't a magic artifact—could it be a spirit artifact?" he mused, sensing something unusual.  

Having studied enchantments, he was well-versed in magic artifacts. This sword's material, spiritual energy fluctuations, and enchantments all surpassed the realm of ordinary artifacts.  

Spirit artifacts were advanced versions of magic artifacts, usable only by Foundation Establishment cultivators and activated by spiritual sense.  

Another interpretation was that spirit artifacts possessed a form of sentience, resonating with a cultivator's spiritual sense to unleash greater power.  

Yet Li Shimin sensed no sentience in the sword, despite having spiritual sense himself.  

The few Foundation Establishment cultivators he had encountered hadn't used spirit artifacts, suggesting they were rare even among their ranks.  

The deceased, Kuai Yun, had been Elder Bai's personal disciple. Though not treated as well as the elder's own son, Kuai Yun still enjoyed privileges beyond most Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

This was why so many sought to become disciples of Golden Core elders—even casual rewards from them were treasures ordinary cultivators could only dream of.  

Li Shimin had no way to determine the spirit artifact's grade, as such knowledge was beyond the scope of a Qi Refining cultivator.  

Nor could he openly inquire about it—possessing such a treasure would invite trouble.  

He attempted to channel a sliver of spiritual energy into the sword, only to stop immediately. The energy vanished without a trace, like a pebble dropped into the ocean.  

Using spirit artifacts would have to wait until he reached Foundation Establishment.  

His enthusiasm waned. Foundation Establishment was still a distant goal—he hadn't even reached late-stage Qi Refining yet.  

Storing the sword, he examined the shield—another spirit artifact. The small bell was also a defensive spirit artifact.  

This puzzled him. Why hadn't the Foundation Establishment cultivator used either artifact during the explosion?  

He doubted the cultivator had more artifacts. The current haul was already astonishing.  

Defensive artifacts could have mitigated the damage—why wouldn't they be used in a life-threatening situation?  

Unbeknownst to Li Shimin, Kuai Yun had refrained because he trusted Elder Bai to protect him.  

Indeed, Elder Bai had blocked the first wave of the explosion, sacrificing his magic treasure and sustaining injuries.  

Mistakenly believing another Golden Core cultivator was lying in ambush, Elder Bai fled using a blood escape technique, leaving Kuai Yun to face the remaining blast.  

The poor disciple perished without even activating his defenses.  

Next, Li Shimin inspected the wooden flying boat—the only item he could currently use.  

Flying boats were unique artifacts, most of which didn't require the user's spiritual energy, relying instead on spirit stones or other energy sources.  

Long-distance travel demanded that cultivators remain at peak condition, ready to face threats. Thus, flying boats were designed to conserve energy, only drawing on the user's power when extra speed was needed.  

This boat was a single-person model.  

"Finally, something usable!" he chuckled, then paused mid-laugh as a grim realization struck him.  

The Foundation Establishment cultivator had been with Elder Bai during the attack. If the Holy Ice Sect discovered he possessed this boat, what would the consequences be?  

Though already on their radar, the severity of their attention would escalate dramatically.  

Previously, they might have sent assassins. But if linked to Elder Bai's injuries, would a Golden Core elder personally intervene?  

Could the Heavenly Sea Sect protect a mere mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator from a Golden Core's wrath?  

"What a mess," he grumbled, stuffing everything back into the storage pouch in frustration.  

He didn't bother with the medicine bottles—their labels bore names he didn't recognize, likely pills meant for Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

While the pills wouldn't expose him, consuming them as a Qi Refining cultivator would be suicidal.  

The only usable items were the spirit stones. He set those aside and stored the pouch in his server room as additional storage.  

He now understood why the pouch hadn't responded to spiritual energy—it was likely a spirit artifact itself, requiring spiritual sense to open.  

Though the Foundation Establishment cultivator's spoils were unusable, the two Holy Ice Sect late-stage Qi Refining cultivators' belongings were fair game.  

From intercepted messages, Elder Bai and the Foundation Establishment cultivator had assumed the two were sent to assassinate him. Thus, their possessions in his hands wouldn't raise suspicions.  

As for retaliation, as long as it didn't involve Golden Core or Foundation Establishment cultivators, he could handle it.  

Li Shimin retrieved the two storage pouches. These responded normally to spiritual energy.  

Their contents were sparse—two high-grade water-attribute ice swords (useless to him without water spiritual roots), two matching ice shields, and about two thousand low-grade spirit stones.  

But the crystalline jade flying boat made the effort worthwhile.  

Its surface bore the Holy Ice Sect's emblem, indicating it was sect property rather than personal belongings.  

This was standard—even the Heavenly Sea Sect loaned flying boats for distant missions after assessing risks.  

The two late-stage Qi Refining cultivators had been on a mission for Elder Bai, so obtaining a sect boat was no issue.  

The jade boat radiated a chilling aura.  

This time, Li Shimin didn't hesitate. He began refining it using the "Dragon Painting Art."  

Though his Raven Sparrow Wings aided flight, a boat was far more convenient. He had long dreamed of sailing the sea of clouds like Yin Shilan.  

And sharing tea with her aboard such a vessel would be a delight.  

Refining the jade boat proved effortless—sect boats were designed for easy assimilation.
