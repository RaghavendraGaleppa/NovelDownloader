# Chapter 300: The "Appearance" in "Appearance, Aroma, and Taste" — Instructor Li Mo Takes the Stage!

Under the night sky, Qingmu City’s streets were not exactly bustling, but they were brightly lit, filled with people dressed in all sorts of unique styles. It lacked the dazzling splendor of Yunzhou’s nightscape, but it offered a distinct flavor of the southern frontier.

According to Zhong Zhenyue, twenty years ago, Qingmu City was nothing but a desolate wasteland. Under Uncle Qu’s governance, it had become a place of peace and prosperity where people lived and worked in contentment, with doors left unlocked at night. Many of the brothers who had come from Nanguan City had even found their homes and put down roots here.

"Boss, are you making sugar paintings again today?"

Passing by the sugar painting stall from yesterday, the sturdy little vendor’s grandson immediately recognized their "King of Kids."

"Want one?"

Li Mo turned to ask.

As soon as he spoke, he felt the delicate hand in his palm tighten slightly, her fingers curling inward.

"We had some yesterday," Ying Bing shook her head.

"We can make one different from yesterday. They say a dish needs to satisfy the eyes, nose, and mouth. The 'appearance' is very important. Changing the shape gives you a completely new experience."

"What do you mean?" Zhong Ling asked curiously.

She had heard that to capture a person's heart, you must first capture their stomach. Just look at Li Mo and Ying Bing. If Li Mo’s cooking wasn’t so delicious, would the famous Cold Fairy wait at the camp entrance for him to come home?

To be honest, she had been quite surprised at the time. One glance at Ying Bing told her the title "Cold Fairy" was well-deserved. She truly seemed like a fairy detached from the mortal world, untouchable and aloof.

*The wife-supporting fighting spirit*... Although she had promised not to call him that in front of Li Mo...

At this moment, the vibe between the two of them...

There are no wrong nicknames, only wrong names!

Li Mo smiled. This was right up his alley.

"The same food, with different appearances, can make one’s appetite soar or make it impossible to swallow. Let me give you an example."

Li Mo asked the vendor for a small spoonful of syrup and poured it onto the table, gently stirring it with a bamboo stick.

"Do you think this looks delicious?"

Little Li pointed at the syrup on the table, which had been twisted into a few loops, resembling the shape of excrement.

"Ugh..."

Zhong Zhenyue’s subconscious dry heave was answer enough.

"..."

Zhong Ling thought to herself that this "wife-supporting fighting spirit" really had great artistic skills. He certainly knew what "looks unappetizing" meant.

Ying Bing tilted her head slightly.

"That is a negative example," Li Mo smiled. "So, what is the positive example?"

"Let me think."

Li Mo re-melted the syrup with his scorching true energy, his gaze lowering slightly. This was actually a subconscious movement when he was thinking.

But of all the times, the pair of jade-like long legs, with a circle of white socks peeking out from the short boots, happened to enter his field of vision.

Does everyone have experiences like this? Daydreaming during class, only to look at your notes and find they are filled with random thoughts from your mind. Or daydreaming during an exam, only to find the name of your crush written in a fill-in-the-blank answer...

Little Li was currently in that exact situation.

"Brother Li, is this what you meant by... something that looks delicious?"

"This seems to be..."

Zhong Ling and Zhong Zhenyue exchanged glances, seeing the suspicion in each other's eyes.

Ying Bing’s peripheral vision swept over him.

*Mr. Righteous...*

"Behold, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step! Doesn't this have a wonderful meaning?"

Li Mo grabbed the lump of sugar and threw it into his mouth.

"But weren't we talking about 'appearance'? Doesn't this piece of sugar look..."

"Sugar? What sugar?"

Li Mo looked dead serious, as if he had just experienced a moment of clarity after amnesia:

"Oh, right, where were we? We were talking about the appearance, aroma, and taste of cooking. How about we have barbecue today? That would best prove my theory."

"..."

Seeing his cheeks puffed out, the glistening substance on his lips still not wiped away, and him still talking eloquently, Ying Bing’s expression remained blank. She gently pulled her hand out of his grasp, took off her jade hairpin, and let down her tied-up black hair.

Letting her hair down could cover her ears and neck.

Zhong Zhenyue looked confused, while Zhong Ling began to doubt Little Li’s culinary skills.

Not long after, they arrived at the restaurant.

The owner of Jiawei Restaurant was once a squad leader under the King of the South. He recognized Zhong Zhenyue. As soon as Zhong Zhenyue arrived, the one-armed owner hurried over to greet him.

The two chatted, filled with many emotions.

The Ice Cube got off the carriage and went straight to her room alone, her steps seeming somewhat... hurried?

Li Mo didn't know what had come over her all of a sudden.

"I'll call you for dinner later."

"...Mm."

Li Mo saw her pause for a couple of seconds before nodding gently, as if she were lost in thought. He couldn't help but speculate a little.

The Ice Cube was probably contemplating some profound martial art, which was why she was distracted? It was somewhat similar to his own situation just now.

After saying a few words to the owner, Li Mo slipped into the kitchen. It was past dinner time, and the kitchen was empty.

Li Mo was using Chixiao to cut vegetables when a familiar figure slipped into the kitchen. She looked hesitant, as if she wanted to say something but held back.

It was Zhong Ling.

"Hero Li."

"Haha, do you want to learn how to cook?" Li Mo twirled his sword, cutting a precious ingredient similar to a green pepper into threads as thin as hair.

Zhong Ling shook her head.

"No, I wanted to ask... about Zhenyue in Yunzhou and that Demon圣女 (Holy Maiden). What... exactly happened?"

"Ah..."

The freshly cut pepper threads scattered onto the cutting board.

Li Mo wondered if Zhong Ling had a habit of flipping tables.

"Did Zhenyue not tell you?"

"He told me a bit. He just said that the vixen bewitched him at the time, and it was you who woke him up. He said you would explain it better, but he glossed over the details."

Li Mo said seriously:

"I actually think Young Master Zhong might not be glossing over the details. It might just be that I left a particularly deep impression on him."

At the time, he saw Zhong Zhenyue looking for the latrine everywhere after 'escaping death.'

"How was he bewitched? What right does that vixen have to..."

Zhong Ling gritted her teeth.

She had quietly accompanied Zhenyue for so long, but that vixen? She only met him a few times, and she made Zhenyue's heart flutter.

If his heart hadn't fluttered, how could he have been deceived!

Li Mo thought for a moment and asked, "Miss Zhong, do you know what Young Master Zhong likes?"

"He likes the strong."

"?"

"So I worked hard to become strong. He never beat me when we were kids. What's wrong with that?"

"..."

Li Mo’s mouth twitched. He thought to himself that given their current situation, it wasn't entirely Old Zhong's fault.

He wasn't exactly a dating expert either. But for Zhong Ling and Zhong Zhenyue, he actually found himself feeling like a relationship instructor.

It was as if he saw the version of himself from childhood who used to pull the Ice Cube's hair.

Perhaps it was because of this.

Li Mo actually started thinking seriously:

"I'm stronger than Brother Zhong too. There are plenty of people in the world stronger than him. His feelings are more like admiration and longing, a desire to become strong himself."

"So back then... how did that vixen do it?"

"Let me think..."

Little Li fell into deep thought.

From his own experience, it seemed that the more of a "steel straight man" one is, the more they fall for the "green tea" type. She brings you breakfast, ties your shoelaces, lets you copy her homework, but all that is beaten by a big-waved beauty saying, 'Big bro, you there?'

"That vixen probably did it like this..."

Instructor Li Mo takes the stage!

Hmm.

A relationship instructor who has never eaten pork but has seen pigs run in his past life...

"Doing it like this... will it really work?"

...

PS: My head is feeling heavy and dizzy today, probably because I have a cold. I request to post two chapters, please approve.
I'm not in good condition, and I'm sure the audience doesn't want to see boring content posted. Mwah.
