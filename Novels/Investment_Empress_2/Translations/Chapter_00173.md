# Chapter 173: The Walking Envoy of the Yan Tian Sect and the Opening of the Martial Summit (Part 1/2)

The noisy street suddenly fell silent.

Bai Jinghong, a genius on the Hidden Dragon List and a true disciple of the Heng Yun Sword City, could even refuse to bow when meeting a prince or marquis.

Yet here he was, kneeling on the street without a moment's hesitation.

Could it be the City Lord of Sword City who had arrived?

Everyone turned around, only to see two girls and a young man standing there.

The young man stood tall and straight, his handsome face radiating a gentle and relaxed aura. Beside him, one girl wore ill-fitting clothes with a cloth strip covering her eyes, her delicate face full of spiritual charm.

The other girl had a cold, noble temperament, like a snow-capped mountain's ice lotus. Her every movement carried an indescribable sense of dignity.

"Who are they?"

"They seem much younger than Young Master Bai."

"Could that girl have an extraordinary background, making Bai Jinghong kneel upon seeing her?"

"She seems even more breathtakingly beautiful than the fairies on the Hundred Flowers Beauty List..."

...

As is well known, those who walk the Jianghu are primarily interested in three things: divine weapons, martial arts, and beautiful women.

The Ice Cube's aura was too overbearing, successfully diverting the attention of the crowd from Li Mo.

Bai Jinghong knelt there, and after a moment of confusion, he felt a wave of embarrassment.

It was a conditioned reflex, damn it.

Now it was awkward to get up, but also awkward to continue kneeling...

"Xiao Bai, you were just saying yesterday that your sword bone was unyielding and you wanted to test your sword against the heroes of the world. How is it that the moment you step out the door, you're kneeling?"

Behind him, the green-clothed swordsman surnamed Wu raised the corner of his mouth, a teasing smile on his face.

"Is this woman very strong?"

The other swordsman surnamed Cao narrowed his eyes, filled with fighting spirit.

"I'm not kneeling to her!"

"Oh? I thought you were overwhelmed by her supreme sword intent and couldn't help but bow."

As swordsmen of the Observation Deity Realm, they were naturally very sensitive to sword intent.

Joking aside, both the swordsman surnamed Wu and the one surnamed Cao were true disciples of the Heng Yun Sword City. They naturally sensed that there was a kind of intimidating aura about Ying Bing.

"Her sword intent is indeed formidable, but... forget it, you guys wouldn't understand!" Bai Jinghong shook his head.

He couldn't help but recall the figure from the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, wielding a hammer like a god or demon, smashing through the entire secret realm with a single strike...

He was smiling, and he was walking towards him!

"It was just a small effort to save you, Brother Bai."

"I told you that Brother Bai is a sentimental person, but there's no need to kneel as soon as we meet."

Li Mo saw Bai Jinghong's窘迫 (embarrassment) and stepped forward to help him up.

"Cough, that's right, I'm just someone who values relationships."

"Brother Li is right," Bai Jinghong stood up and said sheepishly.

"By the way, I have a letter to give to Brother Bai."

"It concerns the safety of Yunzhou, so please take it seriously. It's best to hand it over to your sect's elders."

Li Mo took a letter from his怀里 (bosom), which contained information about the Drizzle Tower.

The Drizzle Tower's scheme was不小 (not small).

With a stroke of his pen, he might be able to change the fate of many people.

He would do such a thing even if there were no investment feedback; it wasn't just for the reward.

"Rest assured, Brother Li!" Bai Jinghong郑重ly (solemnly) took it.

However, the two, Cao and Wu, frowned.

The Qing Yuan Sect was considered decent in Ziyang Prefecture, but to the Heng Yun Sword City, it was a small sect.

After Li Mo and the Qing Yuan Sect disciples bowed and left, True Disciple Wu frowned and spoke:

"Xiao Bai, your actions just now have tarnished the reputation of our superior sect."

True Disciple Cao also nodded:

"The sect has put in a lot of effort to build our reputation."

A person's name is like a tree's shadow.

---

The more威严 (prestigious) a sect is, the stronger its control over the region.

Besides the older generation of experts within the sect, the reputation of the new generation of geniuses is also very important. This represents the sect's future and is the face of the sect.

To build their reputation, the three of them had分别 (respectively) done many things to eliminate evil and uphold justice, and they had even hired storytellers to spread their tales 24/7.

Only then did they earn the reputation of the "Three Heroes of Heng Yun."

"You guys know nothing," Bai Jinghong sneered.

Damn it, didn't you see that my Brother Li was about to pull out his hammer?

He turned and went to deliver the letter.

.....

Yunzhou City was now聚满了 (gathered) with heroes. Every day, countless young heroes who wanted to make a name for themselves left behind their own stories.

Storytellers had become an industry at the风口 (forefront).

But today, the most explosive news was none other than Bai Jinghong's kneeling.

Some said it was to thank a benefactor, others said it was due to old leg cramps. The more plausible theory was that the three were true geniuses from a hidden sect.

Many people began to inquire about the identities of those three young men and women.

And at this opportune moment, a picture book titled "The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me" suddenly appeared out of nowhere!

The appearances of the characters couldn't be said to resemble Li Mo and Ying Bing; they were said to be exactly the same.

It was unclear whose brilliant business idea this was...

.....

Heng Yun Sword City.

The Mansion of the Outer Affairs Elder.

A thin, elderly man was drinking tea, his brow furrowed with displeasure.

Bai Jinghong and the other two were also in the hall.

"Elder Zeng, I have something to show you..."

"Other matters can wait."

Elder Zeng said sternly:

"Why did you do something so disgraceful to our sect's reputation in public today?"

"I..."

"I don't want to hear your explanation."

Elder Zeng coldly cut him off. From his impeccably neat and luxurious robes, it was clear he was someone who valued his reputation highly.

"Wu Chushu, Cao Mu, Bai Jinghong."

"During the Sword Testing Conference, the three of you must challenge those disciples from the Qing Yuan Sect."

Wu Chushu and Cao Mu both accepted with full confidence.

Bai Jinghong's mouth was filled with bitterness as he hurriedly said:

"Then I... will challenge the little girl with the cloth strip..."

"The little girl with the cloth strip?"

At this moment, a puzzled female voice came from the门口 (doorway). A plump...

Elder Zeng quickly stood up and bowed, his face filled with respect.

"Walking Envoy, why have you come?"

Stepping through the door was a pair of jade-like bare feet. Golden bells on her ankles chimed softly, and a jade disk hung from her waist.

Her appearance was serene, but her eyes were as deep and obscure as a dark pool, as if filled with countless intersecting lines.

The Walking Envoy of the Yan Tian Sect.

Her gaze fell on Bai Jinghong:

"The Qing Yuan disciples you just mentioned, what are their characteristics?"

.........

As the day of the Martial Summit drew nearer, Yunzhou City became even more bustling.

Shen Yunfei, Xu Zhiqing, and the others all felt the pressure, spending their days verifying martial arts and practicing diligently.

Li Mo spent his days with the Ice Cube and his nights with Princess Jiang.

In his spare time, he practiced Observation Deity.

The eastern sky began to lighten.

Li Mo sheathed his sword and stood still.

Having consumed a great deal of martial arts insight, his "Solitary Nine Swords" had reached the threshold of initial proficiency.

The result of his final deduction was:

[Solitary Nine Swords, to defeat all heroes. You know you can no longer practice behind closed doors. It is time to point your sword at the heroes of the world, using their swords as a whetstone to forge the world-shocking sharpness in your heart!]
