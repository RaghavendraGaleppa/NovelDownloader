# Chapter 48: Countermeasures  

Elder Hao felt an inexplicable familiarity with Li Shiming. After some time, he realized this sensation stemmed from the cultivator who had purchased talisman paper from him before.  

Though Li Shiming's height and build differed entirely from that cultivator's, the world of cultivation held countless methods to alter one's appearance. The suspicion led Elder Hao to devise this test.  

If Li Shiming was indeed that cultivator, then he was a true novice—someone who had bought the secret manual without any ulterior motives or schemes.  

No cultivator could master a spell from a manual devoid of true intent in such a short time, not even the simplest "Light Body Technique."  

Elder Hao dismissed his initial suspicion, concluding that the previous cultivator must have been a powerful expert in disguise.  

"Fellow Daoist Li, your execution of the 'Light Body Technique' is quite impressive—clearly, you've had some fortuitous encounters. It seems my advice would be unnecessary!" he said with a smile.  

Yet Li Shiming noticed the subtle shift in Elder Hao's expression, particularly the flicker of surprise when he demonstrated the technique.  

The "Light Body Technique" was far from complex, so Elder Hao's reaction could only mean his thoughts had been elsewhere.  

Recalling the faint hostility Elder Hao had shown upon their first meeting, combined with the earlier test, Li Shiming grew uneasy.  

Even after the gathering concluded, Elder Hao remained a thorn in his mind. Despite the elder's seemingly genuine demeanor afterward, Li Shiming couldn't shake his apprehension.  

Elder Hao was a sixth-layer Qi Refining cultivator—according to Gu Jia, the strongest among the loose cultivators near Zhongdu.  

As the patriarch of the Hao family, he commanded four other Qi Refining cultivators.  

Even if it weren't Elder Hao himself, any member of the Hao family could effortlessly overpower Li Shiming.  

Though Li Shiming had killed two Hao family members—one at the third layer and another at the fourth—those victories had relied on ambush tactics and maintaining distance.  

If a cultivator were to assassinate him, he couldn't guarantee whether his IBMz15 could detect their approach through his five senses. The methods of cultivators were far beyond those of mortal martial artists.  

Lost in thought, he returned home. The gathering hadn't been entirely fruitless, however.  

A cultivator eager to curry favor with him had provided a map detailing the distribution of forces around Zhongdu, including the exact locations of various factions.  

Marked on it were the territories of the five cultivation families and the residences of several mid-stage Qi Refining experts.  

Such maps circulated among cultivators precisely to avoid these powerful factions.
