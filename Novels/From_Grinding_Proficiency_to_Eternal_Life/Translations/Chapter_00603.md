# Chapter 603: Universal Salvation True Monarch

It seemed this Senior Brother Lu understood that he needed time to digest and enhance his strength.

He redirected his attention to the smooth crystalline bead carrying the power of the Supreme Yin Mysterious Mirror Dao Fruit, his gaze sharpening.

His closed-door cultivation and artifact refinement were complete. Stabilizing his realm and condensing his own Immortal Golden Nature to achieve Foundation Establishment Perfection could not be delayed any longer.

However, the method of condensation still required careful consideration.

After some thought, Xu Yunfan decided to rest for another month before leaving seclusion to find Lu Chuan. As a Great Perfected Master at Foundation Establishment Perfection, the other party should have experience in this matter.

Although the attribute panel allowed him to advance step by step without bottlenecks, some directions still required his own control.

The Immortal Golden Nature condensed at Foundation Establishment Perfection not only contained one's essence, qi, and spirit, but also carried one's own will.

That is to say, conceptual imagery.

The Myriad Swords Sect called it Sword Intent.

The Bodhi Pure Land called it Great Vow.

At this very moment, in the distant depths of the shattered Heavenly Realm's remnants, where its essence was being frantically plundered...

A figure clad in dark ceremonial robes, with ancient and majestic features, surrounded by immeasurable Universal Salvation Immortal Light and an aura of nirvanic majesty, sat cross-legged upon a golden dao platform floating amidst the void turbulence.

His vast aura formed a powerful confrontation with the collapsing Heavenly Realm's Heavenly Dao. This was the Primordial Origin Sect's Golden Core True Monarch.

Universal Salvation True Monarch.

At this moment, he formed hand seals, his dao realm projection covering a section of void as he devoured this realm's final spiritual opportunities and dao charm.

Originally, everything had proceeded smoothly. He had already seized the majority of the essence from the Heavenly Emperor's Sun Dao Fruit, and the Nirvana Dao Fruit of the Western Buddha's Tathagata had been secretly divided between himself and the True Monarch of the Myriad Swords Sect. The Bodhi Pure Land had arrived late and could only scavenge for scraps, which naturally left them quite frustrated.

Seeing the Bodhi Pure Land suffer a setback brought great joy to Universal Salvation True Monarch's heart.

However, when his divine sense once again swept through the core essence of this shattered realm, his deep eyes that seemed to contain the waves of eternity suddenly flashed with a trace of suspicion that was extremely difficult to detect.

"Hmm?"

A low, muffled exclamation echoed like thunder through the ruins of the shattered heavenly palace.

"The Heavenly Emperor of this realm achieved the Sun Dao Fruit that governed this world and illuminated eternity. This follows the principle of yin-yang rotation. With the Heavenly Realm's Heavenly Dao intact, even if shattered to this extent, there should be a corresponding Supreme Yin Dao Fruit to maintain the foundational essence, preventing such rapid complete collapse..."

The reason he had been lingering in this realm was to wait for the Heavenly Dao's power to weaken enough that it could no longer hide, allowing the hidden dao fruit to manifest.

But now the entire Heavenly Realm was on the verge of complete destruction, yet the Supreme Yin Dao Fruit still hadn't appeared.

This was rather strange.

His powerful divine sense spread like an invisible net, once again penetrating every corner of the Heavenly Realm, repeatedly scanning and deducing causality.

Yet the core of the Supreme Yin Great Dao that should have been clearly present, along with the corresponding treasure that manifested the dao fruit, had completely vanished as if evaporated, leaving only the faintest traces that had been disturbed.

The more he deduced, the more he felt as if he were falling into a fog, with heavenly secrets chaotic and difficult to distinguish truth from falsehood.

Although there were clues, they seemed to have been carefully arranged and then covered by another layer of similar fluctuations, creating heavy interference.

After all, this realm's Heavenly Dao naturally wouldn't allow an external demon to deduce this realm's heavenly secrets.

This was the Heavenly Realm's Heavenly Dao's last line of defense—even in death, it wouldn't let anyone strip it completely bare.

Universal Salvation True Monarch slightly furrowed his brows, contemplation flashing in his eyes.

"Is this realm's Heavenly Dao struggling in its death throes, still desperately hiding this dao fruit, or perhaps..."

His gaze suddenly sharpened like a physical substance, piercing through endless space-time to look upon the remnant will of the plundered realm's Heavenly Dao. A cold, mocking smile curved his lips.

"Hmph, petty tricks. Do you think such concealment will prevent this seat from finding it?"

He was already eighty to ninety percent certain in his heart.

The Heavenly Realm's Supreme Yin Dao Fruit had definitely not been made to disappear or be annihilated by the Heavenly Realm's Heavenly Dao. Although the birth of a dao fruit followed the principles of heaven and earth as a derivative of the Heavenly Dao, it also possessed a certain degree of independence.

It couldn't be easily destroyed.

It must have been seized by someone who took advantage of the opportunity and taken away from this realm.

To accomplish such a feat, deceiving heaven and crossing the sea, succeeding at the critical moment when the Heavenly Realm was collapsing and True Monarch dao realms were covering everything, then using the natural fluctuations of the realm's collapse to conceal the traces...

This definitely required the full cooperation of the realm's own will.

Otherwise, a mere Foundation Establishment Perfected Master who hadn't even been found would have absolutely no possibility of success.

Universal Salvation True Monarch estimated that there were still remnants of this Heavenly Realm who had escaped through some spatial rift to the Grand Hua Spirit Ruins Realm, or perhaps it was on some bold and lucky Foundation Establishment cultivator.

As for suspecting Xu Yunfan, who had been at the edge of the battlefield at the time with causal secret arts and the Star Soul Banner concealing him, but only had mid Foundation Establishment cultivation...

Universal Salvation True Monarch naturally ran through all the Foundation Establishment auras present on the battlefield at the time, which included several from the Primordial Origin Sect.

What Xu Yunfan had displayed was merely mid-to-late Foundation Establishment mana fluctuations. What means could he possibly have to seize a dao fruit under the eyes of three True Monarchs?

This defied all reason and was an infinitesimal possibility.

The greater possibility was still some hidden expert among the Heavenly Realm's remnants, or perhaps it was truly the final struggle and concealment of this realm's dying Heavenly Dao.

Though confident in his assessment, some things still needed to be done.

"Once matters here are concluded, I will carefully investigate all Foundation Establishment cultivators who entered and left this realm."

Having determined that the Supreme Yin Dao Fruit was no longer in this realm, Universal Salvation True Monarch withdrew his gaze, his eyes indifferent as if seeing through all falsehoods.

In his eyes, so-called Foundation Establishment cultivators were merely existences slightly more resilient than Qi Refining materials.

Finding them and stripping away the dao fruit would be as easy as turning his hand.

His fingers moved slightly as an invisible buddhist seal quietly disappeared into the void, like setting up a silent hunting net.

After emerging from seclusion, Xu Yunfan briefly handled matters at Divine Sky Peak, gathered with Bi Yuan and a few others, then immediately went to find Lu Chuan. He arrived at Lu Chuan's Purple Chen Peak and met him in the quiet room at the peak.

"Senior Brother Lu, I apologize for making you wait."

Xu Yunfan bowed respectfully to the blue-robed daoist sitting before the tea table.

"Your junior brother was in closed-door cultivation stabilizing the opportunities gained from the Heavenly Realm. I never expected that three years would pass in a single session. I failed to come promptly to pay my respects and receive your teachings. This is truly discourteous, and I beg for Senior Brother's forgiveness."

Lu Chuan set down his teacup, his face showing his usual warm and approachable smile as he waved his hand, his voice steady.

"Junior Brother Xu, you speak too seriously. In the path of cultivation, closed-door cultivation and contemplation are normal matters.

You established the merit of first ascent in the Heavenly Realm, and the opportunities you gained are extraordinary. Naturally, you needed time to digest and stabilize them, building a solid foundation as the proper path.

The True Monarch's decree also instructed you to come find me only after your cultivation was complete. There's no need for apologies about waiting. That you could cultivate in seclusion for three years shows your dao heart is steady and you prioritize your foundation. As your senior brother, I can only feel pleased."

He paused briefly, his dignified and righteous smile unchanged, though a subtle light flashed in his eyes. His tone remained peaceful but carried additional weight.

"Moreover, the True Monarch has already given clear instructions about this. That you could have such opportunities and devote yourself to digesting them is exactly what he hoped to see. Your timing in coming here is perfect."
