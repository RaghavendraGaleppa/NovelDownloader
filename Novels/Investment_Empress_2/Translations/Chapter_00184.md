# Chapter 184: One Hammer? The Big Problem with the Ice Cube

On the lakeside, a multi-storied boat drifted gently.

"Young Master, come play~"

"You have a great capacity for alcohol, Sir."

The sounds of soliciting and vulgar flattery rose and fell in waves. A heavily made-up madam sat at a table, greedily counting gold and silver items.

"You're making so much money with this painted boat, have you forgotten your own identity?"

Suddenly, a woman's voice came from behind. The madam hastily stood up.

Turning her head, she saw an additional enchanting and seductive figure on the bed.

"Holy Maiden."

"You... are you injured?"

"Hm?"

Yin Mianmian narrowed her eyes.

In an instant, the gold and silver on the table vanished without a trace.

The madam's pupils contracted. As an Inner Scene expert, she couldn't even see how those treasures had been taken.

The one who could take her money so silently could also take her life just as easily.

"Have those几位 despicable men arrived?"

"They are the Raincoat Guest, the Twin Lotuses, and the Blood Gourd."

The madam reported honestly.

Yin Mianmian remained silent for a moment: "Tell them to come see me tomorrow."

"Yes."

After the madam left.

Yin Mianmian slowly stood up and swept her hand across the table.

The silver appeared again, as if it had never left. She scooped up a handful of gold pearls, then let them clatter back down.

"Divine Skill...?"

As the Holy Maiden of the Drizzle Building, ranked sixth on the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List).

Even those ranked above her probably wouldn't say they could defeat her with certainty within the same realm.

She had never suffered a loss when fighting someone of the same level.

But today...

What if Ying Bing was at the Third窍 of Divine Observation?

Recalling that chillingly cold Divine Intent, and that Sword Intent resembling divine punishment.

She could only recall the part of her Divine Intent she had left in Hengyun Sword City. This contract was completely finished.

And that少年.

"Northwest Hammer King, I didn't expect we would meet like this."

Candlelight danced in Yin Mianmian's eyes, a smile playing on her lips:

"Betraying the Drizzle Building means facing the wrath of heaven and earth..."

***

Under the night sky, the prosperous Yunzhou City was bathed in moonlight.

After the battle, Meihau Pavilion had become a ruin.

"What just happened?"

"It seems there were assassins from the Drizzle Building hidden in Meihau Pavilion."

"I saw Young Hero Li make his move just now. With just one sword, he slew eight Drizzle Building assassins."

"Eight? Eighty! I was right there!"

...

The entire street was cordoned off by the law enforcement disciples of Hengyun Sword City. The onlookers couldn't get in, so they could only speculate wildly in layers of crowds.

By the time Elder Zeng arrived.

The rumors about Young Hero Li had already escalated from killing eight assassins to killing eight hundred.

"Eight hundred?"

Elder Zeng paused his steps.

Eighty assassins from the Drizzle Building at the Divine Observation realm could easily slaughter an Inner Scene expert.

Wu Chushu remained silent for a moment and said:

"It's eight hundred now, but in a few days, it will probably become eighty thousand."

"Usually, when we hype up our disciples, we don't exaggerate this much."

"I didn't exaggerate. The sect originally claimed I killed six bandits."

"..."

The master and disciple walked past the rubble and saw the scene inside the ruined Meihau Pavilion.

Zhong Zhenyue sat there, looking as if he was questioning his life.

"It's good that the Little Marquis is safe."

Elder Zeng let out a sigh of relief and asked:

"What exactly happened here?"

Zhong Zhenyue snapped out of his daze and sighed bitterly, recounting everything that had happened.

Elder Zeng's brow furrowed deeper and deeper.

***

The Holy Maiden of the Drizzle Building had actually come to Yunzhou City and infiltrated Zhong Zhenyue's side?

"It's good that the Little Marquis is safe."

"That witch is extremely skilled at manipulating people's hearts. To break free from her control shows you are a hero with a firm will. Few geniuses can escape from her grasp."

"It wasn't because my will was firm."

"Oh?" Elder Zeng was confused.

Zhong Zhenyue's expression was complex as he recalled the scene just moments ago:

"It was Li Mo's one hammer..."

Before he could finish.

"Cough, cough!"

A cough sounded as Li Mo walked out, a friendly smile on his face:

"One hammer what?"

"Uh... Brother Li's swordsmanship is superb, so he was able to 'One Hammer Decides the Sound' (a figure of speech)! Severing my delusions!"

Zhong Zhenyue's eyes quickly cleared up.

Seeing this, Elder Zeng felt it was strange.

He had heard that the Little Marquis was fierce in battle, possessing the courage his father, the King of the South, had in his youth. On the arena today, his spear was like a dragon, undefeated.

Why did he look so... obedient... when looking at that Li kid?

Moreover.

The Drizzle Building's Holy Maiden is known as the Demoness, ranked sixth on the Hidden Dragon List.

Li Mo could actually "One Hammer Decides the Sound"?

Sensing the疑惑 in Elder Zeng's eyes, Li Mo smiled and said:

"Actually, the one who repelled the Holy Maiden of the Drizzle Building wasn't me, but Ying Bing."

"It was her..."

Elder Zeng narrowed his eyes, his peripheral vision sweeping over a nearby spot where traces of a Divine Intent clash still lingered.

For an Outer Scene expert, these traces could almost还原 (restore/reconstruct) everything.

He couldn't help but be slightly startled.

This little girl was much, much stronger than what she had shown on the arena!

He truly wondered what earth-shattering martial arts she would comprehend after observing the sword marks.

He retracted his thoughts and inquired about the details of today's events.

***

Night grew deeper.

In the courtyard.

Early autumn made the moon seem cool.

Under the moonlight, one person was still practicing swordplay. Her sword light seemed to merge with the clear moonlight, as if fighting an invisible opponent.

She was reviewing the battle just now.

A moment later.

The young girl stopped her movements, standing alone with her sword on her back, letting the wind blow through her black hair.

Observing the moon couldn't calm her heart.

"If my Sword Heart were clear, Yin Mianmian wouldn't have just been lightly injured."

"If my Sword Heart were clear, I could use the Hengyun Sword Mark to supplement the 'Divine Sky Heart Sword'. Then, when the system ranks me again, I would have confidence..."

"But why is it that I am always a hair's breadth away from perfection in the first three stances?"

Ying Bing frowned slightly, her eyes showing a hint of confusion.

The sword technique was definitely not the problem.

Then, the problem could only lie with her.

There were no longer any flaws in her moves.

"Is it my state of mind?"

The Divine Sky Heart Sword emphasizes replacing the heart of heaven with one's own heart.

Heaven is heartless, treating all things as straw dogs.

She had once been so close to the true Great Dao. Under heaven, surely no one was more suited to this sword technique than her.

Why was it that her heart could not truly be detached from the world, leaving all sounds silent?

*Slam—*

Not far away, the window of a certain room opened.

Young Hero Li, who had just finished practicing his arts, poked his head out. Seeing the young girl in the courtyard, he was slightly stunned:

"Ice Cube, you aren't sleeping again?"

"Take a break occasionally. Sharpening the axe won't delay chopping wood... Do you want a late-night snack? Soul-grilled skewers?"

The boy's smiling words were carried by the wind.

"..."

Ying Bing was suddenly stunned.

She seemed to have found the problem with her state of mind.

But... she didn't know how to deal with it even more?
