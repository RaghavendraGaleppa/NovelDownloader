# Chapter 162: Seventh Space

"Take us to Space Node Seven."

The Saint Demon put away the purple-gold card in his hand and said to the creature.

The creature lowered its head slightly, mumbling in affirmation. The vertical pupil on its forehead lit up, and the circles of patterns within it spun rapidly. A beam of light shot out, causing ripples in the void, and a spatial channel was opened, leading to an equally unknown place.

"Space Nodes 1 through 10 were the first ones opened by the major superpowers of the Star Realm when they initially made contact. They have now developed into extremely prosperous areas." The Saint Demon explained to Zhou Tian, leading him into the spatial channel.

Inside the spatial channel, colors were brilliant, and strange scenes appeared from time to time.

"What in the world is this Firmament-reaching Company?" Zhou Tian asked. He finally recalled the familiar feeling from the purple-gold card on the Saint Demon's person. It was clearly a fantasy version of a business card, and coupled with the name "Firmament-reaching Company," it gave him a sense of temporal disorientation.

"The Firmament-reaching Company is one of the superpowers in the Star Realm. At least half of the existing space nodes in the Star Realm belong to this force, and they even participated in the design of the spatial array foundations for the top ten space nodes." The Saint Demon explained that their "primary business is spatial services. I am a member of theirs. After paying a price, they will guide me wherever I need to go, even to some forbidden zones in the Star Realm."

This spatial channel was extremely long, the Saint Demon explained, also taking the opportunity to educate Zhou Tian on some common knowledge.

"Then, what level is our Nine Provinces at in the Star Realm?" Zhou Tian asked curiously; this was an unavoidable question.

"Every powerful force has its own space node. The Nine Provinces occupies Space Node Eighteen. What level do you think that is?"

"Eighteen? I thought it would at least be in the top ten." Zhou Tian was somewhat surprised. In his view, the Nine Provinces' strength was already formidable, yet it hadn't even made it into the top ten.

"The Nine Provinces is quite special. Although it appears as one entity, it's actually a conglomeration of nine forces. Furthermore, a world forcefully integrated like the Nine Provinces is much, much weaker than naturally formed worlds, which is why it only ranks eighteenth. However, its actual strength is much greater, to the point that even the top ten forces wouldn't dare to treat it lightly," the Saint Demon explained, narrowing his eyes slightly and murmuring, "We've arrived."

Zhou Tian was slightly startled. He felt a brief blur in his mind as he emerged from the spatial channel, and immediately, a cacophony of sounds flooded his ears.

This was a vast plaza with nine colossal teleportation gates, each hundreds of feet tall, made of some precious material, gleaming with an obsidian-like luster. Silver patterns pulsed with energy.

Creatures constantly moved in and out. "People" wasn't quite accurate; there were all sorts of beings. Humans were only a fraction of them: elephant-headed people with golden wings, upright tiger-headed, dragon-clawed creatures, and even floating flood dragons.

Besides the nine massive teleportation gates, there were countless smaller, scattered ones, and Zhou Tian and the Saint Demon had emerged from one of them.

The scene in the distance gave him an even stranger sense of familiarity: skyscrapers stood shoulder to shoulder, a colossal city filled with various towering buildings. From afar, he could see carriages soaring through the air.

This seemed out of place—vehicles of a divine-demon civilization entering a modern metropolis.

In mid-air, the appearance of various flying vehicles created a stark contrast. Spaceships streaked across the night sky, while fierce beasts pulled carriages, landing on the tops of certain skyscrapers.

Zhou Tian was somewhat dazed. In just a moment, he saw several small flying saucers landing on the rooftop of a grand building, and also carriages pulled by Nine-headed Phoenixes and five-colored dragon-horses descending there.

What kind of place was this? It had both technology and divine-demons coexisting in one location, leaving him speechless. It just felt odd to him.

Just then, a purple-gold war chariot roared past. Around the chariot, phantoms of true dragons, phoenixes, and Qilins floated, formed by flowing light, guarding the four directions and making the chariot appear robust and sacred, like an emperor on inspection tour.

Zhou Tian looked up. Even the mounts pulling the chariot were extraordinary: eight pure-blooded dragon-horses, partly covered in dragon scales. One of them had even transformed, resembling the most sacred Qilin.

This purple-gold chariot seemed to be picking someone up near the teleportation gates, hovering above Zhou Tian and the Saint Demon. A young girl poked her head out.

"Look, someone down there is staring at us like an idiot." The girl chuckled, her white clothes like snow, as she gazed down. Her sweet face and beautiful features were unmasked by her voice, which clearly reached Zhou Tian's ears.

Are they talking about me? Zhou Tian paused slightly and called out, "Are you talking about me?"

"See? He's even asking us. He must be from some small world recently discovered by the Firmament-reaching Company. There have been so many people like him lately." Another girl poked her head out, smiling like a flower.

"Just a frog in a well. Why bother with him?" A cold male voice emanated from within the chariot. There was a man inside, but he hadn't shown his face.

"Yes, Young Master," the two girls replied, retreating back into the chariot.

"..." Zhou Tian was speechless. He turned to the Saint Demon beside him and said, "Hey, little brother, someone's looking down on your big brother. Aren't you going to do something about it?"

The Saint Demon glanced at Zhou Tian, a clear warning in his eyes, but still, with a wave of his hand, a nine-tailed phoenix appeared in mid-air, letting out a long cry that dominated a large area. Its feathers were brilliant, and runes shimmered faintly.

It pulled a glazed golden chariot, extremely luxurious.

The few dragon-horses in the void struggled to stand steady and tumbled down.

The Saint Demon's aura fully unleashed, the aura of a Heavenly King raged. He led Zhou Tian into their chariot, while Zhou Tian stuck his head out, straining his neck to yell, "Little brother, look! There are some country bumpkins down there staring at us like idiots!"

"Shut up!"

The crowd below stiffened, as if an incredibly powerful figure had arrived, one for whom even a Heavenly King-level individual could only be a 'little brother'.

The faces of the people inside the purple-gold chariot turned even more ashen. Heavenly Venerates were already the top combatants of any force, rarely appearing. Dao Lords and Heavenly Kings were already considered powerful combatants in the Star Realm. They never expected one to appear in this teleportation plaza. Usually, such grand figures had dedicated spatial channels and rarely appeared through public teleportation gates.

Zhou Tian triumphantly pulled his head back into the chariot, meeting the Saint Demon's gaze with a smile. "Senior, it was just a joke. Don't be so serious."

The Saint Demon frowned, not bothering with him further. The chariot rumbled, heading towards the city.

Along both sides of the street, skyscrapers stood densely packed, many of them shimmering with metallic luster, made of special materials, towering into the clouds, incredibly vast.

The Saint Demon headed towards the tallest building ahead. It was made of peculiar material, exuding a special glow, as if countless crimson-gold symbols fluttered, weaving the words "Firmament-reaching Hotel" in the void.
