Chapter 288: The First Thread of True Qi!

The moment its foot stepped down, the roiling mist in the Sea of Consciousness scattered like waves crashing against a reef. Another step, and it was already seated atop the nine-petaled golden lotus at the center of the Sea of Consciousness.

The chaotic thoughts that had entangled him like venomous snakes shattered under the gaze of his divine self, dissolving into specks of starlight that sank into the abyss of his Sea of Consciousness.

Xu Yunfan’s breathing gradually synchronized with his divine self.

By the time the eastern sky began to pale, the phantom of his divine self had condensed into a statue of solidified glaze. A faint golden ‘Lin’ character rune surfaced between Xu Yunfan’s eyebrows before vanishing beneath his skin in a flash.

Twenty days of this ceaseless cycle passed. Xu Yunfan’s skin gradually took on a jade-like luster, and the sword energy within his Triple Burner meridians grew so dense it seemed on the verge of bursting.

Then, one night, he felt a sudden urge. The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Whip flew into his hand on its own, and he began to practice the Eight Wastelands Dragonfall Whip Method. Finally, amidst this lonely and relentless cultivation, he took the lead in reaching Minor Completion.

Over these twenty days, the Muscle and Marrow Cleansing Art had made tremendous progress.

Piled high with resources from the Dao Sect, Xu Yunfan’s daily proficiency in cultivation could steadily climb to twenty-eight or twenty-nine points. During moments when his blood boiled and his bones resonated in ecstasy, it could even break through the thirty-point barrier.

Now, on his attribute panel, the proficiency of the Muscle and Marrow Cleansing Art had broken through the 500 mark, reaching 597 points. It was rapidly approaching the 1000 required for Great Completion.

It was a pity that while reaching Great Completion was easy, achieving Perfection required several times the effort for a mere chance.

This was why martial artists found it increasingly difficult to break through as they progressed. Unless one was a true martial genius, it was impossible to touch the extreme of each realm and thus have the foundation to break through.

Most importantly, at this moment, the Pure Yang One Qi Art within Xu Yunfan’s body had finally reached the Perfection realm!

The originally boiling, molten-gold-like Pure Yang internal energy had now collapsed and condensed at a strange convergence point deep within his flesh and blood, transforming into a thread of True Qi as fine as a silken strand, yet as brilliant as the rising sun.

True Qi!

No wonder the Dao Sect placed such importance on this art. Though it was merely a martial art practiced in the Outer Three Unifications realm, it formed the foundation of the entire Dao Sect’s martial arts.

This thread of True Qi was fine, yet it weighed a thousand jun!

As the True Qi traveled through his flesh and blood, the acupoints along the way resonated spontaneously, emitting a clear, bell-like chime.

Compared to the vast, river-and-sea-like Pure Yang internal energy of the past, this thread of True Qi was like a dormant scarlet dragon. It appeared slender, yet it concealed the power to collapse mountains and sever peaks.

However, although Xu Yunfan’s True Qi had condensed into a thread, it was still bound by his physical body.

Whenever he attempted to guide the True Qi into his meridians, the violent force would rage through them like a scorching fire in the ocean, causing the walls of his meridians to instantly crack like a spiderweb. The pain was like ten thousand ants gnawing at his marrow.

He had to immediately retract the True Qi, a trace of scarlet already seeping from the corner of his mouth.

Even the Minor Completed Sword Cultivation Art of the Triple Burner could only rely on his internal organs as a base, allowing the sword energy to cautiously wander within the Triple Burner meridians.

If these sword qi attempted to invade major meridians like the Hand Taiyong Lung Meridian or the Foot Yangming Stomach Meridian, it would immediately cause a chain reaction of vibrations. It was like striking a glazed cup with a heavy whip; a little more force would shatter his meridians.

Flesh, blood, and tendons were the main pathways for True Qi circulation, which was somewhat different from Xu Yunfan’s initial expectation of True Qi flowing through meridians.

This also indirectly created the extremely formidable physiques of the martial artists of this world. The martial arts cultivation of this realm had already pushed human potential to an incredible level.

Even Bi Sheng, with his seemingly bamboo-like emaciated body, could, once he activated the Twelve Techniques of the Golden Gate and Jade Lock, cause his blood and energy to surge like a volcano, transforming him into a burly, muscle-knotted giant in the blink of an eye.

The Dao Sect called them Colossi, while the Maitreya Sect called them Arhats.

The meaning was essentially the same.

Suppressing the thoughts in his heart, he gazed at the Crimson Essence Blood-Activating Pills floating in the green jade medicinal vat, feeling a sense of emotion.

"The foundation of a top sect is truly incomparable to that of the Heavenly Work Cave..."

If any of these precious pills were placed outside, it would be enough to trigger a scramble among small sects.

The Nine-Reversal Jade Liquid Soup could cleanse marrow impurities, the Thunder Tribulation Bone-Forging Pill could use the lingering qi of the heavens to temper jade-like bones, not to mention how the two girls, Qingluan and Chishao, used the Nine-Reversal Palace-Pushing Hands to guide the medicinal power for him, clearing even the blockages in the meridians and flesh.

In contrast, in the past, even with the assistance of a ginseng baby, a day of bitter cultivation would yield at most seven or eight points of proficiency in a martial art.

Although ginseng qi could supplement vitality, it was ultimately biased towards nourishment. For the overbearing cultivation of the Marrow Cleansing realm, which required breaking before establishing, it was like a drop in the bucket.

Even the legendary thousand-year-old ginseng king, if swallowed强行 without regard for the balance of yin and yang, would instead cause blood and energy to flow in reverse. How could it compare to now, where various precious pills were combined like monarch, minister, assistant, and envoy, regulating the medicinal properties as precisely as a fine mechanism, with every bit of medicinal power precisely targeting a cultivation bottleneck.

Xu Yunfan’s name swept through the thirty-six peaks of the Dao Sect like a wildfire.

The news that Sect Leader Bi Yuan had made an exception to accept him as the second-rank true disciple of the Patriarch lineage of the Profound Heaven Pavilion was already shocking enough. What shook the various peaks even more was that this new true disciple had retained his lineage from the Heavenly Work Cave, and his daily consumption of precious pills was comparable to the daily expenditure of an entire peak.

When the various peak powers secretly investigated, they only saw a courtyard shrouded in the roars of dragons and whips. The sound of the Eight Wastelands Dragonfall Whip Method breaking the air had not yet ceased at the Yinshi hour (3-5 a.m.), and at the Zishi hour (11 p.m.-1 a.m.), the muffled sound of energy like a flowing river could be heard.

Above the courtyard walls, the purple qi steaming from the Nine-Reversal Jade Liquid Soup lingered for a long time, even causing the spiritual cranes passing by to bristle their feathers under the influence of the medicinal power.

"That martial maniac’s martial arts seem to have improved again!"

Outside the courtyard, on a sword peak three hundred zhang away from Qingwei Mountain, a Daoist in a purple robe甩了甩 his sleeve. Hearing the movements resembling a dragon’s roar from within the courtyard, he couldn’t help but tremble slightly, spilling three feet of spiritual tea from his cup. His expression was incredibly complex.

"The hundred-forged steel stele sent by the Steel Peak is脆得像冻豆腐 in his courtyard!"

A female cultivator from the Green Luan Peak beside him lightly tapped the stone table, her face filled with a hint of shock.

"Yesterday, when I delivered the medicine, I saw him chewing those Crimson Fire Blood Essence Pills like candy... That was my entire month’s allowance!"

Before her voice faded, a disciple in black robes who suddenly rushed in silenced the entire pavilion.

"整整 twenty days and nights!"

His Adam’s apple bobbed as he gestured. "The night-patrolling Daoist boys can testify. The movements in his courtyard have been continuous! The courtyard has been plowed several times!"

A dead silence fell over the pavilion.

One must know that even martial artists who specialized in body tempering would suffer mental and physical exhaustion after ten days without sleep. Yet this Xu Yunfan seemed like a没事人一样, practicing with increasing ferocity.

"No wonder the Sect Leader accepted him... he’s a complete freak!"

Chu Cangming, who had been silent in the corner, suddenly narrowed his eyes.

The movement of his knuckles lightly tapping the teacup came to an abrupt halt. The reflection of the Qingwei Mountain courtyard in the cup was shattered into ripples. The courtyard, shrouded in the roars of dragons and whips, was now emanating a sense of pressure that was familiar to him.

"Boom!"

A muffled sound from the distant mountain signaled the completion of the ninth form, "Dragonfall." Chu Cangming’s black Daoist robe stirred without any wind.

His body, which had reached the Marrow Cleansing realm of the "Seven Techniques Opening the Heavenly Gate" stage, spontaneously tensed its muscles at this moment, his spine straightening joint by joint as if struck by a sword finger.
