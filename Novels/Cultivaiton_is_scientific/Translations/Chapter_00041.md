# Chapter 41: Gains

Protected by 'starlite', Li Shiming felt a tingling sensation on his scalp.

Having decided to create 'white phosphorus bombs' and 'thermite bombs' for self-defense—especially against cultivators—he had crafted them to the maximum destructive capacity possible with his current means.

His reasoning was clear: if the explosive range couldn't cover the distance a cultivator could escape, what use would such self-defense weapons be?

But another problem arose. With such immense power, he lacked the strength to throw the thermite bomb beyond its own blast radius. In other words, once detonated, he would likely be caught in the explosion himself.

Thus, he needed a way to survive the flames of the thermite bomb. After searching through the large server IBMz15, he found the most feasible solution.

'Starlite' was a fireproof material developed by a man named Maurice Ward. Although the original formula was lost after the inventor's death, later researchers managed to recreate a similar material using common household items: starch, baking soda, and glue. Mixed together, they formed the new 'starlite' fireproof material.

As for its effectiveness, Li Shiming had already tested it in the server room space.

Lying flat on the ground like a dumpling filling, Li Shiming wore a gas mask over his face. He counted the seconds in his mind while listening to the sounds outside.

Fifteen seconds after the explosion, he peeled off the 'starlite' covering his body. The surface of the material had turned completely black, but it had protected him well—he hadn't suffered a single burn.

However, the scorching air, thin oxygen, and toxic smoke made the area unsafe. The effect of his 'Primary Lightness Talisman' hadn't worn off yet. After collecting the 'starlite' material from the ground, he dashed toward the two corpses.

His gaze fell on the storage pouches at their waists. Surprisingly, both cultivators had them. Though slightly charred, the pouches remained intact, seemingly protected by some defensive mechanism.

He recalled the first storage pouch he had obtained—it had survived the nitroglycerin explosion unscathed. Now wasn't the time to ponder this. He quickly stashed the two pouches. As for the rest of the items on the corpses, they had all been severely damaged in the fire.

Li Shiming pushed off with his feet and sprinted down the mountain.

The explosion and flames had alerted the cultivators in the market. Some rushed toward the blast site, while others changed direction and left the market.

Among them were the cultivators who had ambushed Li Shiming. They were horrified, knowing exactly who had been lying in wait in that direction. They also knew those ambushers couldn't have caused such a commotion—not because a fourth-level Qi Refining cultivator was incapable, but because even if they could, they wouldn't.

The ambushers relied on the market for survival. If the market were deemed unsafe, fewer cultivators would dare to visit. With fewer visitors, those living nearby wouldn't be able to sell their goods. Even a successful robbery wouldn't compensate for such losses.

Li Shiming ran at full speed. Only when he saw the northern gate of Zhongdu did he finally feel at ease.

His appearance was too conspicuous, so before entering the city, he changed his clothes—though he kept his disguise. After circling through the city and emerging from an alley, he had transformed back into Li Shiming the scholar, clad in flowing Confucian robes, bearing no resemblance to the burly cultivator from before.

To anyone who saw him, there was no connection between the two identities—different height, build, and face. At least to low-level cultivators, they appeared entirely distinct.

Back home, Li Shiming stared at the two storage pouches before him, a wry smile on his face.

This brush with danger had truly opened his eyes to the ruthlessness of the cultivation world. He decided not to visit the market again—at least not until he joined the Tianhai Sect.

Picking up one of the pouches, he channeled spiritual energy into it and sensed its contents: a low-grade longsword artifact with a small 'Hao' character engraved on the hilt.

"Is this from that Hao?" Li Shiming thought of the first stall in the market, run by an elderly cultivator. The sign at the stall had borne the same character 'Hao'—an uncommon surname. He doubted this was a coincidence.

Such a marked artifact couldn't be sold unless he traveled far from this region.

Next was a thick stack of talismans, far more than he had expected. Upon examining them, he noticed they were all made from bluish-yellow talisman paper—distinctive enough for him to recognize immediately.

This was the same paper sold by the old Hao. These talismans must have been produced by Hao's faction.

Fifty-plus 'Primary Lightness Talismans', over thirty 'Primary Fireball Talismans', thirty-some 'Primary Frost Talismans', fifteen 'Primary Earth Armor Talismans', and two 'Intermediate Fireball Talismans'.

This was the first time Li Shiming had seen so many talismans in one place. He realized that if he had fought this cultivator with his own meager collection, he wouldn't have stood a chance.

The pouch also contained over 120 spirit stones, along with some clothes, gold, silver, and other mundane items.

Having only recently begun cultivating, Li Shiming already possessed over a hundred spirit stones. The fact that this cultivator had only 120 suggested they were quite poor.

He opened the second pouch. The first thing he saw was another low-grade longsword artifact, identical in style and bearing the same 'Hao' mark.

"I'll have to visit Brother Gu sometime and ask about the factions in this area," Li Shiming muttered to himself.

This pouch held fewer talismans, but their quality was higher: five 'Intermediate Fireball Talismans', one 'Intermediate Earth Armor Talisman', and over forty primary-grade talismans.

Li Shiming paid special attention to the 'Intermediate Earth Armor Talisman'—a defensive talisman capable of blocking attacks.

There were also 350 spirit stones, a pile of talisman ink materials, twelve stacks of bluish-yellow talisman paper, and a spirit-infused talisman brush.

The brush exuded far more spiritual energy than the 'Red Hare' brush he had purchased. Though not quite a mid-grade artifact, it was among the best of low-grade ones.

Finally, the pouch contained a cultivation journal. It seemed many cultivators enjoyed keeping such notes—this was the second one he had obtained from just three storage pouches.
