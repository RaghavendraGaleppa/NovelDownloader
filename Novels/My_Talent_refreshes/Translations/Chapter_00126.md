# Chapter 126: The Array Formation Site

Holding the long spear, a chill spread through him. It was hard to believe this spear had just unleashed such a blazing attack.

"Fire Phoenix Feather Spear, top-tier magic tool."

Chu Ning recalled the information Shang Rui had mentioned about this magic tool, and his heart couldn't help but burn with excitement. He currently didn't possess a single top-tier magic tool. While the dark small knife was only useful in critical moments, having a usable top-tier magic tool would greatly increase his deterrent power. Thinking back to how Shang Rui had unleashed a sky full of flames, forcing Chu Ning to use all his defensive measures, he immediately picked up the magic tool and infused it with magic power to test it.

The next moment, Chu Ning's gaze froze. His expression turned a little unsightly.

"This magic tool is actually a special fire-attributed magic tool. I can't activate it with my wood-attributed magic power?" Chu Ning, unwilling to give up, gathered his magic power once more and tried to infuse it into the long spear. After a long while, Chu Ning had no choice but to reluctantly give up, letting out a long sigh. It was a considerable regret for Chu Ning to finally obtain a top-tier magic tool only to find he couldn't use it. He reluctantly glanced at the magic tool one last time before finally putting it into his storage bag. Since he couldn't use it, it held no immediate value for him.

Chu Ning rummaged through Shang Rui's body again, finding nothing but a storage bag. He then directly used a few Fireball spells to reduce the opponent to ash.

"I didn't play with fire with you, but letting you turn to ash in fire in the end, I suppose that's fair." Chu Ning silently murmured before immediately returning to the previous cave. His battle with Shang Rui had not only exhausted all his defensive measures but also consumed most of his magic power. Naturally, he couldn't venture outside easily at this moment.

Inside the cave, he first placed a mid-grade defensive talisman into his sleeve, ensuring it could be activated at any time. Then, Chu Ning took out ten small pieces of Earth Spirit Crystal from his storage bag and re-added them to the Earth Spirit Bracelet on his wrist. Only then did Chu Ning take out a few Energy Recovery Pills and consume them, beginning to restore his magic power. He circulated the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art for several cycles, feeling his magic power fully recovered.

He then got up and opened Shang Rui's storage bag.

"Eh? So many medicinal herbs?" As Chu Ning opened the opponent's storage bag, the first thing he saw was numerous jade boxes. When he opened them one by one, he found most contained wood-attributed or fire-attributed spirit herbs. These spirit herbs all appeared to be of considerable age. There were even quite a few more than the spirit herbs Chu Ning had collected on his journey. Thinking about how the other party had just mentioned being close to Foundation Establishment, Chu Ning wasn't too surprised to find so many spirit herbs in Shang Rui's storage bag. He just wondered if Shang Rui had collected them within the sect or found them in this Spirit Domain.

Besides the numerous spirit herbs, what surprised Chu Ning was that the storage bag also contained more than twenty mid-grade spirit stones. There were also some pills of decent quality. Chu Ning roughly looked through them and found some things he could use immediately. There were two or three kinds of pills he didn't recognize. Additionally, Chu Ning found a jade slip inside, which contained some pill recipes. However, Chu Ning had never dabbled in alchemy, so he only glanced at it roughly before putting it away.

"Although that top-tier magic tool is unusable, these items are still quite valuable." Chu Ning sorted the usable and unusable items into his different storage bags before leaving the cave with Ling Xiaobai.

After spending considerable time exiting the mountain hollow, the man and beast continued towards the direction of the array formation site. Along the way, Chu Ning became increasingly cautious. There were even two instances where Ling Xiaobai communicated to Chu Ning about spirit herbs that his puppet bird and divine sense couldn't detect, and he chose to give up on them. However, as they drew closer to the array formation site, the spiritual energy grew denser, and Chu Ning was able to obtain some spirit herbs and plants every now and then. At this point, it was not difficult for Chu Ning to understand why almost all disciples in the sect were exceptionally enthusiastic about participating in the secret mission to enter the Spirit Domain.

Putting everything else aside, just the opportunities for these spirit herbs and plants alone might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance for most Qi Condensation stage cultivators. For Chu Ning, although he had gained much, he still felt a touch of regret.

In a relatively secluded small cave, Chu Ning watched as the sky outside fully brightened before slowly ending his cultivation. Then, he habitually checked his cultivation proficiency.

[Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Third Layer (1041/2100)]
[Nine Transformations Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Unbreaking Sinews (678/1500)]
[Divine Sense Refinement Art, Second Layer (12/2000)]

Twenty days had passed since entering the Spirit Domain. During these twenty days, Chu Ning traveled during the day, but still maintained a relatively sufficient cultivation time at night. Of course, since his cultivation time was not as long as it was in Yanji Square before, the speed of improvement was naturally not as fast.

For body tempering, Chu Ning had enough Golden Orchid Fruits in his storage bag. Eating one per day could increase his progress by 2 points. Any more was not feasible, as he didn't have that much extra time for cultivation. For Qi cultivation, there was no Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art to assist, and Chu Ning also had to spend some time each day restoring his magic power, so naturally, it didn't increase as quickly as it did outside. However, the spiritual energy density in this Spirit Domain was very high, allowing for fast magic power recovery. In addition, Chu Ning basically consumed one Spirit Yuan Pill every one or two days, and the Golden Orchid Fruits were also continuous, so he could still ensure a proficiency increase of about 3 to 4 points daily.

Among these, the Divine Sense Refinement Art was undoubtedly the most affected. After entering the second layer of the Divine Sense Refinement Art, the cultivation difficulty had already increased. Furthermore, Chu Ning no longer had the assistance of Black Night Iron Soulwood, and in this Spirit Domain, to maintain his divine sense for unexpected situations, he wouldn't intentionally consume his divine sense by crafting talismans. Therefore, the progress of the entire Divine Sense Refinement Art was very slow, only increasing by 10 points in twenty days in the Spirit Domain.

"There are so many spirit herbs and plants in this Spirit Domain, and I've encountered one or two types for body tempering, so why have I not seen any spirit herbs that aid divine sense?" Chu Ning sighed softly. Then he sent a message to Ling Xiaobai, "Xiaobai, you can't sense spirit herbs related to divine sense, can you?"

"What are spirit herbs related to divine sense?" Hearing Ling Xiaobai's question, Chu Ning's eyes widened. "You really can't sense them?" At this moment, Chu Ning vaguely thought of a possibility and asked Ling Xiaobai: "Can you only sense spirit herbs and plants with dense spiritual energy?"

Ling Xiaobai nodded, and Chu Ning let out a light sigh. No wonder. Whether it was spirit herbs for Qi cultivation or body tempering, they were primarily guided by spiritual energy; the better the spirit herb, the denser its spiritual energy. However, this was not necessarily true for spirit plants and herbs related to divine sense. For example, with the Black Night Iron Soulwood, if Chu Ning hadn't cultivated divine sense, he wouldn't have been able to sense the wood essence within it at all. If there were similar spirit plants, this situation would likely arise. Ling Xiaobai couldn't distinguish them based solely on the density of spiritual energy; it was more important to judge through divine sense.

"So, I might have actually missed such treasures along the way?" Chu Ning murmured to himself, then shook his head. Not necessarily. It was possible there genuinely weren't any such treasures, as heaven and earth treasures that could strengthen divine sense were truly rare.

After a sigh, Chu Ning quickly got up and exited the small cave. He took out the directional guidance needle and looked at it, then started walking in the indicated direction. It took him a while to realize that this directional guidance needle not only indicated direction but also roughly indicated distance. For example, when Chu Ning first entered the Spirit Domain, the red pointer on the guidance needle was very long. Now, the pointer was less than a third of its original length. This meant Chu Ning had covered more than two-thirds of the journey.

"I need to speed up a bit." He certainly wasn't foolish enough to wait until the month was over to actually test whether the guidance needle would fail. Chu Ning thought this to himself, quickening his pace. At the same time, his puppet bird continued to be released daily for reconnaissance. As he drew closer to the array formation site, Chu Ning encountered more and more people each day. He largely maintained his previous strategy of avoiding them if possible. Occasionally, if one or two lone cultivators simply couldn't be avoided, he would just not travel with them.

After another three days of travel, Chu Ning found a place to rest briefly, his gaze on the length of the guidance needle, calculating his distance. "If I walk normally, I should reach it in at most four more days. Coming from the outermost Blue Moon Cave, my speed isn't slow." Chu Ning thought silently to himself, while his puppet bird circled around him, scouting and standing guard.

At this moment, his expression shifted slightly, his gaze inadvertently sweeping towards the east. Simultaneously, he urged the puppet bird to fly eastward. Unfortunately, the puppet bird could only see a hundred zhang, while the sound Chu Ning had just heard was at least three to four hundred zhang away.

Since the puppet bird couldn't see the specific movements, Chu Ning simply got up, intending to leave before the people there got close. However, just as he was about to move, he paused slightly. The sound reaching his ears actually felt vaguely familiar. Chu Ning, therefore, did not recall the puppet bird and continued to observe.

After a few breaths, a figure frantically rushed towards his side. "It's him?" Chu Ning was slightly surprised to see this figure. It was Shang Zhaoxiang. When his gaze shifted backward, he saw a spider-like demonic beast in hot pursuit.

Chu Ning, who had originally intended to leave, flew towards the east with wind manipulation upon seeing this.

"Senior Brother, save me!" At this moment, Shang Zhaoxiang also saw Chu Ning. When he realized Chu Ning was a Qi Condensation seventh-layer cultivator, he was overjoyed and cried out.

"A first-tier mid-grade demonic beast." Chu Ning identified the beast's level with a single glance. He casually took out a hook-shaped mid-grade magic tool from his storage bag. This was something he had obtained near the Blue Moon Cave when he first entered the Spirit Domain. The skinny disciple had been killed and had his treasure seized by his fellow sect members, but this item had ended up with Chu Ning.

As magic power was infused, a golden light shot out from the hook, striking the spider directly. It immediately brought the spider to a halt. Chu Ning then waved his hand, and several Geng Metal Sword Qi shot out from his talisman ring, instantly riddling the spider demonic beast with holes.

Seeing this scene, Shang Zhaoxiang, who had stopped, immediately beamed with joy and praised, "Senior Brother's Golden-attributed spell is truly exquisite! This mid-grade Golden-attributed magic tool can't even compare to Senior Brother's sword qi." Shang Zhaoxiang, as before, said things people liked to hear. This habit of making connections amused Chu Ning.

At this moment, because he was using a shape-shifting spell, Shang Zhaoxiang naturally didn't recognize him. Not just Shang Zhaoxiang, but anyone he had met after entering the Spirit Domain wouldn't recognize him. With the appearance of a middle-aged man, and now using golden-attributed magic tools and spells, he looked exactly like a disciple specializing in golden-attributed spells who had just been recruited for this mission. Of course, it wasn't too abrupt. Among the outer sect disciples, many cultivated a single-attribute cultivation method but also cultivated spells of different attributes due to having other spiritual roots.

Chu Ning looked at Shang Zhaoxiang's somewhat disheveled appearance and asked with a hint of doubt, "Junior Brother, why did you provoke this demonic beast? You're only at Qi Condensation sixth layer; you should have avoided it when you encountered it."

"Sigh, don't even mention it!" Shang Zhaoxiang sighed and shook his head, saying, "Along the way, I avoided even the slightest dangerous places, and since my teleportation point wasn't far, I arrived here safely. I just inadvertently discovered a few withered spirit flower stalks whose receptacles were almost open, meaning the seeds were old enough to collect. Thinking these flowers might be relatively rare spirit plants, and there were no demonic beasts nearby, I picked them all. Who knew that as I continued forward, I accidentally passed by this demonic beast's cave, was discovered, and it chased me all the way."

As he spoke, Shang Zhaoxiang looked at the spider demon beast's corpse with lingering fear and said, "If it weren't for Senior Brother's timely intervention, I probably would have lost my life so close to the array formation site." Chu Ning nodded after listening. "Indeed, it's so close to the array formation site, yet the demonic beasts here aren't high-level. Losing your life here would be too much of a loss."

"Couldn't agree more." Shang Zhaoxiang said, then added with a puzzled look, "It's strange, though. The spiritual energy gets denser closer to the array formation site, but spirit plants and herbs seem to be scarcer. Even the demonic beasts seem to be lower level. I encountered two first-tier low-grade demonic beasts earlier."

Chu Ning had actually noticed this before. He thought for a moment and said, "Perhaps it's because people are more concentrated closer to the array formation site, so they've all been cleared out by other Senior Brothers." Shang Zhaoxiang nodded in agreement, "That's very likely."

As he spoke, Shang Zhaoxiang took out a flower receptacle that subtly revealed seeds from his storage bag and handed it to Chu Ning. "Senior Brother, do you recognize what kind of flower these seeds are from?" Chu Ning took it, looked at the gray-green receptacle, then at the subtly exposed black seeds, and carefully examined them. Then he shook his head and said, "I haven't seen this kind before. I really don't know what spirit plant it is."

As he spoke, Chu Ning habitually extended his divine sense into the flower's interior, wanting to get a clear look. The next moment, Chu Ning's expression changed, and he asked Shang Zhaoxiang, "Where did you pick this flower? Is there any more in that place?"

"Just on a cliff face not far from here," Shang Zhaoxiang casually pointed, then continued, "There was only this much, and all of it had already withered." Saying this, Shang Zhaoxiang saw Chu Ning's seemingly interested expression and immediately took out five more identical flower receptacles from his storage bag. He then handed them all to Chu Ning. "Senior Brother, if you're interested in these flowers, you can have these flower receptacles. I don't recognize them and have no use for them anyway."

Chu Ning stared blankly at Shang Zhaoxiang. "You're not considering if these flowers might be valuable spirit herbs?" "Haha, it's not that easy. How could a few random flower receptacles I picked up be rare spirit herbs?" Shang Zhaoxiang shook his head and said with much emotion, "Besides, even if it really is something good, it can't be more important than my life. Senior Brother saved my life; it's only right that I offer some compensation." Saying this, Shang Zhaoxiang pushed the flower receptacles forward again. "And there are no spiritual energy fluctuations on this spirit plant, so it's probably not anything good. I'm just saying that for my own peace of mind."

Seeing Shang Zhaoxiang say this, Chu Ning pondered for a moment, then reached out and took all the flower receptacles. As he put them into his storage bag, Chu Ning also took out two jade boxes from his own storage bag. "These flower receptacles look interesting, and I can't tell what they are, so I'm interested in taking them out to study. As for saving you, it was just a matter of convenience. Consider these two spirit plants an exchange with you."

Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, Shang Zhaoxiang naturally politely refused. However, after Chu Ning repeated his offer twice, subtly showing a hint of displeasure, Shang Zhaoxiang finally accepted the two jade boxes. When he opened the jade boxes and saw two spirit grasses of decent quality, he naturally offered another string of thanks.

After completing the exchange, Chu Ning refused Shang Zhaoxiang's suggestion to travel together. He claimed he had other companions to find and left directly. Then he changed direction and walked for another day. After finding an uninhabited spot, Chu Ning dispelled his shape-shifting spell, returning to his original appearance.

This place was already very close to the array formation site, and he was encountering more and more people. Further on, it would be inconvenient for Chu Ning to change his appearance again. As for entering the array formation site, Chu Ning naturally had to appear in his original form. After all, this was his true identity, and who knew if the sect would conduct any checks later.

Furthermore, even if there were no checks, Chu Ning would have to leave this place eventually. If he hadn't shown his face at the array formation site, and then suddenly appeared later, it would be even harder to explain.

After returning to his original appearance, Chu Ning no longer avoided people as much. After walking for another day like this, he caught up with a small group of over twenty people and continued together. And in this group, Shang Zhaoxiang was indeed present. Seeing Chu Ning, Shang Zhaoxiang was also surprised and delighted, and very warmly stepped forward to greet him. When he heard that Chu Ning's teleportation distance wasn't far and he hadn't encountered much danger along the way, Shang Zhaoxiang clicked his tongue in wonder, envying Chu Ning's good fortune.

The two chatted as they walked, and finally, after another day of travel, on the afternoon of the second day, the group arrived at the direction indicated by the guidance needle. The Array Formation Site.
