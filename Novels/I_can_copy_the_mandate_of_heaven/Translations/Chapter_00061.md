Chapter 61: Initial Maturity

As the early spring sun shone into the study, the air still carried a hint of chill, but the warmth was palpable. Li Zhiming sipped the bitter silver-needle tea his master had left behind, savoring the flavor as it trickled down his throat.

"Jiang Yun, can you read?" Li Zhiming asked, his eyes fixed on the young woman.

Jiang Yun's eyes dropped slightly, her expression hinting at a mix of emotions. As the daughter of a prefect, it would be a scandal if she couldn't read. In reality, Jiang Yun had begun her education at a young age under her father's guidance and had shown remarkable intelligence. By the age of eight, she had already read through the Four Books and Five Classics, and by twelve, she was known as a talented young woman in the county, able to compose poems with ease.

"I can read a little, sir," Jiang Yun replied, her voice soft.

Li Zhiming nodded, a sweet smile on his face. "Then let's start with the 'Medicine Song'."

Under Li Zhiming's guidance, Jiang Yun learned quickly. Within ten days, she had memorized the entire "Medicine Song", a feat that would have taken an ordinary person a month to accomplish. Li Zhiming was impressed, and his praise was evident in his evaluation: "Not bad."

As the days passed, Li Zhiming continued to teach Jiang Yun medicine, while also researching the "Ma Fei Powder". The valley received wounded martial artists from various peaks, and Li Zhiming treated them with meticulous care, earning a reputation as a "Little Divine Doctor". His fame spread throughout the Seven Mystic Gates and beyond, attracting people from far and wide to seek his medical expertise.

Unbeknownst to others, Li Zhiming's own progress was rapid. As he treated the wounded, he absorbed their martial arts techniques, and his knowledge grew exponentially. Within a year, he had mastered over 323 martial arts techniques, including 40 supreme arts. His body, nourished by the positive energy, had undergone significant changes, and he now stood tall, with a robust physique and a handsome appearance.

At thirteen, Li Zhiming was already taller than most adults, standing at over six feet. His youthful energy was palpable, and his demeanor was that of a confident young man. He wore a simple green robe, cinched at the waist with a jade pendant, and carried a long sword. Though not yet capped, his presence was imposing.

As he strolled out of the study, bathed in sunlight, Li Zhiming thought to himself that it was time to visit the library. He needed to broaden his knowledge to avoid being at a disadvantage when dealing with others.

"Young master," Jiang Yun said, curtsying as she approached Li Zhiming. Her face flushed as she caught his eye, and she quickly looked away.

Li Zhiming smiled, noticing Jiang Yun's changed appearance. She had matured significantly over the past year, and her beauty was now more pronounced. "Jiang Yun, how are the wounded martial artists doing?" he asked, his hands clasped behind his back.

Jiang Yun replied, her voice barely above a whisper, "They are recovering well, young master."

Li Zhiming nodded, his mind elsewhere. As he walked away, he suddenly stopped and sniffed the air. "Jiang Yun, you smell nice. What's that fragrance?"

Jiang Yun's face turned bright red, and she smiled, her voice laced with subtle meaning, "You'll find out soon enough, young master."

Li Zhiming, oblivious to Jiang Yun's embarrassment, continued on his way, shouting "Let's go!" as he disappeared into the valley. His voice, now changing due to puberty, was awkward and rough, like a leaky bellows.
