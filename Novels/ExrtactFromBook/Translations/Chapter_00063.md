# Chapter 63: Clear Ridge

Under the tremendous bombardment of magical power, the [Mao Hour Gold] and [Yin Hour Silver] gradually began to melt!

The two gaseous forms of these low-grade metals, tempered by the lightning-infused mana, could no longer maintain their integrity. Their material substance gradually dissipated, releasing extreme heat.

They acted like two catalysts, encasing the [Mao Hour Gold] and [Yin Hour Silver], inducing transformative changes in their properties.

Slowly, these two third-tier treasures—known for their incredibly stable and unyielding nature—began to melt and deform!

The lightning bombardment continued relentlessly for over half a day!

From dawn till dusk!

Now, the full moon hung high in the sky.

With the thunderclouds dispersed, the Thunder Dragon became a massive source of light in the heavens!

Its radiance illuminated the long night!

After prolonged tempering by the lightning-infused mana, the [Mao Hour Gold] and [Yin Hour Silver] had liquefied, merging into a single pool of pale golden metallic fluid.

These two third-tier treasures shared similar origins—both were crystalline ores formed from condensed earth-vein energies deep underground.

During tectonic shifts that triggered earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other cataclysms, these deeply buried crystalline ores could be thrust high into the sky.

When exposed to the void, if the crystalline ores merged with the primordial energy of the sun, they became [Mao Hour Gold]. If they merged with the primordial energy of the moon, they became [Yin Hour Silver].

These two materials possessed highly compatible physical foundations but diametrically opposed mana attributes.

Now, under the relentless bombardment of lightning, Li Changyue masterfully fused them together. The resulting amalgam retained the unyielding physical properties of third-tier treasures while harmonizing the opposing forces of sun and moon, adding an even more profound mystique!

Li Changyue, the Heavenly Fortune Daoist of the Divine Firmament Palace, had been the undisputed top expert beneath the Longevity realm three hundred years ago!

Though suppressed for three centuries by a Great Sage of the demon race, his divine abilities and mana remained as formidable as ever.

Now, assisting his disciple in forging a Dao-bearing artifact was as effortless as slaughtering chickens or butchering cattle.

Once the materials were fully refined, Li Changyue flicked his right hand repeatedly in the air, channeling mana to inscribe an extremely intricate rune in the void. With a gentle tap, the rune flew into the suspended liquid metal.

This was none other than the Divine Firmament Palace's secret technique—the [Upper Cave True Thunder Shattering Rune]!

As the rune merged with the liquid metal, the fluid immediately began churning violently.

Without waiting for the metal to solidify, Li Changyue inscribed yet another equally complex mana rune.

The Divine Firmament Palace's secret technique—the [Nine Heavens Dao-Tempering Guardian Rune]!

The Heavenly Fortune Daoist effortlessly inscribed these two supreme runes and infused them into the molten metal.

Under Li Changyue's control, the Thunder Dragon unleashed its boundless mana!

The liquid metal, tempered by this overwhelming power, gradually condensed, its properties ascending further!

The sheer magnitude of mana erupting in the sky sent tremors through Han Yue and the golden eagle below, leaving them trembling in awe.

Suddenly, Li Changyue's voice boomed from above:

"Yuanchu, strike with all your might!"

Han Yue, sensing the moment, raised his right hand like a blade and unleashed his most powerful technique—[Thoughtless Slash]!

The massive blade light struck the suspended liquid metal with full force, completely merging into it.

Through the mana connection, the liquid metal surged toward Han Yue along the path of the [Thoughtless Slash]!

Han Yue didn't evade. Closing his eyes, he steadied his mind, waiting for the liquid metal to reach him.

The metal, carrying boundless lightning-infused mana, crashed into Han Yue's body and instantly merged into his dantian.

A deafening roar erupted in Han Yue's ears, as if the heavens themselves had shattered!

He felt instantly deafened, the world around him plunged into utter silence, indescribable and absolute.

A brilliant white light erupted from his dantian, surging upward, shaking his consciousness and blinding his vision.

Han Yue's five senses were completely severed!

He felt utterly isolated from the world, cut off from all existence.

Within his dantian, immeasurable light and immeasurable power gestated, grew, and spread—radiating from within to without, illuminating the cosmos!

For a time, Han Yue sank into the deepest state of seclusion.

Of course, all of this was merely Han Yue's own perception and imagination.

From Li Changyue's perspective, the highly refined artifact embryo entered Han Yue's body, and he immediately collapsed onto the golden eagle's back, falling into a deep trance.

This was the process of the Dao-bearing artifact taking root within him—everything was proceeding as Li Changyue had foreseen.

No longer concerned with Han Yue, Li Changyue turned his attention back to the Thunder Dragon.

He spoke to it:

"Three hundred years of roaming the outer domain have nourished your spirit well!"

"It was my fault for holding you back. Without these three centuries wasted, you would have already awakened your own consciousness and ascended to the fourth tier!"

Li Changyue beckoned, and the Thunder Dragon—despite its infinite mana—obediently flew toward him.

As it drew closer, the colossal creature shrank rapidly.

By the time it reached Li Changyue, the Thunder Dragon had transformed into a jade-like chain.

The chain, interlocking link by link, was covered in ancient, mysterious runes!

This highly sentient Thunder Dragon was not a living creature at all!

In truth, the Thunder Dragon was Li Changyue's Dao-bearing artifact—one of the lineage artifacts known as the [Upper Cave True Thunder Shattering Dragon Subduing Chain].

Li Changyue named this chain [Clear Ridge]. Forged when he first reached the second tier, this third-tier artifact had grown alongside him over centuries.

After hundreds of years of refinement, [Clear Ridge] had developed its own spirit, standing just one step away from evolving into a fourth-tier treasure.

Three hundred years ago, Li Changyue had been remotely suppressed by the Great Sage of the demon race—[Profound Tortoise Xuanli].

Realizing escape was impossible, he exiled [Clear Ridge] into the outer domain's clouds to preserve its spirit.

For three centuries, Li Changyue remained trapped within the tortoise shell, unable to break free.

Yet his Dao-bearing artifact roamed freely among the outer domain's clouds, herding lightning and devouring mana, living without a care!

Upon his escape, Li Changyue immediately sought out his artifact.

It was only with [Clear Ridge]'s immense power that he could so effortlessly forge Han Yue's Dao-bearing artifact.

Now, with [Clear Ridge] back in his grasp, the three centuries' worth of accumulated mana surged into Li Changyue's body. As their energies intertwined, both man and artifact grew visibly stronger.

The long separation had not dulled their bond in the slightest.

With [Clear Ridge] returned, all its enhancements to divine abilities and mana were restored—Li Changyue's combat prowess was fully recovered.

In fact, after three centuries of refinement, [Clear Ridge]'s power surpassed its former heights!

Li Changyue ran his fingers along the chain's length, sensing that his artifact had been tempered to the absolute peak of the third tier—as if it had truly gained life!

If Li Changyue were to break through the Longevity barrier and achieve his Primordial Spirit now, this chain would undoubtedly ascend to the next tier immediately.
