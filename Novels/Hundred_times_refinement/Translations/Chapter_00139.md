## Chapter 89: Bi Xue Ring

The zombie's claw flashed with green light as it swiped at Lin Xuan, dispersing the firebird technique with a mere swipe. Witnessing this, Lin Xuan reached into his robe and retrieved a black flag from his storage jade bracelet.

The surrounding yin energy grew thicker, and Lin Xuan decided to counter the ghostly creature with the Hundred Souls Banner. Infusing his spiritual energy into the banner, a black fog erupted, carrying with it the souls of those who had met a tragic end.

Though mostly comprised of ordinary souls, their malevolent energy was on par with that of the ferocious ghost before them. "Unite!" Lin Xuan chanted, pointing the banner forward. The souls coalesced into a three-meter-tall crimson skull, which lunged at the zombie.

The skull opened its maw, unleashing two beams of malevolent energy. The zombie roared, uprooting a massive tree and hurling it at the skull. The two entities clashed, their battle shrouded in a swirling fog, with the sound of mournful wails filling the air.

Lin Xuan turned his attention back to the ferocious ghost, assessing it once more. He hesitated for a moment before waving the Hundred Souls Banner again, summoning the remaining souls within.

These souls, with their disheveled hair and claw-like fingers, were terrifying in appearance, exuding a potent aura of resentment. However, their cultivation was no match for the ferocious ghost, a being composed of cultivator and beast souls. Engaging it in combat would be suicidal, but Lin Xuan had no other choice; he needed to buy time.

"Go!" Lin Xuan commanded, and the souls, though ferocious, obeyed the Hundred Souls Banner's control, charging towards the ferocious ghost with ear-piercing shrieks.

The ferocious ghost's eyes flashed with anger as it unleashed a beam of crimson light, annihilating the leading souls. Yet, the remaining souls, devoid of fear, continued their relentless assault.

Meanwhile, the crimson skull and the zombie remained locked in a fierce battle. Lin Xuan took the opportunity to retrieve the Bi Xue Ring from his robe, a superior-grade spiritual tool he had obtained from Zhang Yu.

The Bi Xue Ring was renowned in the Floating Cloud Valley, and as a cultivator in the Spiritual Fluid phase, possessing such a tool was a rare occurrence. Lin Xuan had been hesitant to use it, as its true potential was yet to be fully unleashed, and its previous refinement by Zhang Yu limited its power.

However, faced with the current predicament, Lin Xuan had no choice but to employ the Bi Xue Ring. After using the remaining souls to distract the ferocious ghost, he began to activate the ring. To ensure his safety, he also used a mid-grade defensive talisman, creating a layered defense around himself.

The ferocious ghost, having achieved a level of intelligence rivaling that of humans, sensed Lin Xuan's preparation of a powerful technique. Its face twisted in anger, and it attempted to charge towards him, but the remaining souls hindered its progress.

The ghost transformed into a crimson net, descending from the sky to ensnare the souls. Though the souls resisted, a smaller, detached entity – the ghost's external manifestation – emerged, spewing a mouthful of essence blood that incinerated the trapped souls.

With the souls eliminated, the crimson net reformed into the ferocious ghost, which merged with its external manifestation. The ghost then turned its attention back to Lin Xuan, its eyes fixed on him with an unblinking stare.

However, it was too late. Lin Xuan, having gained sufficient time, opened his eyes and tossed the Bi Xue Ring into the air. The ring expanded, changing its form until it was as large as a necklace.

"Divide!" Lin Xuan shouted, imparting a technique into the ring. The Bi Xue Ring split into multiple duplicates, eventually forming sixteen identical rings. The ferocious ghost, sensing the unfolding events, turned to flee towards two nearby spiritual grasses.

Lin Xuan sneered, "You think to destroy what you cannot have?" The ghost's actions were predictable, driven by its fixation on spiritual herbs, a trait inherent to its composition of cultivator and beast souls who had perished while vying for such resources.
