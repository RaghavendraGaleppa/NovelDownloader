# Chapter 41: Passing a Snowy Day, Boiling Refined Food Again

Matters had temporarily come to an end.

Li Xian returned to his residence, sat cross-legged on the bed, and recalled Pang Long's words.

"The first realm of Food Essence is elusive and without trace. Today, seeing Madam Wen make her move was truly an eye-opener."

"Such a demon was killed with just a flick of her finger. I have caught a glimpse... of a battle that transforms one's very being."

"These things are still too far from me. Circulating Qi through the Heavenly Cycle is my current goal!"

He immediately settled his mind.

He调动 the Qi within his Dantian, condensing it into threads that wound through the various acupoints, slowly extending through his meridians.

Li Xian had learned three martial arts in total: the Great Completion "Four Directions Fist," the Small Completion incomplete "Raging Bull Fist," and the Entry-level "Breeze Step."

Internal Qi originates from martial arts.

It gathers within the Dantian.

This type of internal Qi will be consumed, but as long as one eats and rests, it will naturally recover to its peak, like an endless stream of vitality.

Condensing Qi into threads, it roams within the body.

When the Qi passed through eighty-one acupoints, the Dantian was already completely empty. The internal Qi was used up, and he could not operate the major acupoints of the Heavenly Cycle, naturally failing to achieve "Circulating Qi through the Heavenly Cycle."

"It seems I am still very far from Circulating Qi through the Heavenly Cycle."

"But as long as I persist, this level is still within reach!"

Li Xian had a goal, and his eyes shone brightly.

He wished to get out of bed immediately to practice martial arts, but the residence was cramped; with four beds placed, there was no extra space.

Having survived a near-death experience today, he was indeed tired, so he had to rest for a day and closed his eyes to sleep.

The next day.

Around the hour of Chen (7-9 AM), Li Xian woke up naturally.

[Skill: Sleep]
[Proficiency: 278/500 Entry]
[Description: You are gradually mastering the knack of sleep, able to ignore surrounding noisy sounds and sleep until dawn. During sleep, energy, blood, and various bodily energies will be slowly repaired.]

He opened the window a crack.

Wind mixed with snow rushed in, and the temperature immediately dropped significantly.

"Who is it! Opening a window in this weather, did your brain get kicked by a donkey..." Bao Yongkang, who shared the room, was hit by a gust of cold air head-on.

He was instantly startled, his sleepiness completely gone, and in his annoyance, he subconsciously wanted to curse. But seeing it was Li Xian, he immediately stopped his words, gave an awkward smile, pulled up his covers, and continued to sleep.

Although it was a heavy snowstorm, Li Xian was unwilling to waste time and was always thinking about practicing martial arts.

The residence was small, only able to accommodate four people to rest. There was simply no extra space for Li Xian to spread out his fists and legs.

Moreover, it would disturb Sun Kong, Bao Yongkang, and Jia Jie's rest; Li Xian was not so overbearing in his actions.

So he had a sudden idea and looked outside the house.

"Who says you can't practice martial arts on a heavy snow day?"

He tied a rope about two zhang long around his waist, the other end tied to the door, and ventured alone into the wind and snow.

Braving the fierce wind and heavy snow, he began to practice martial arts.

[The world is cold, but your heart is like fire. Your situation is difficult, but your will is strong. You practiced the Four Directions Fist bitterly in the cold wind, Proficiency +9]
[First knowing the vast world, even more motivating ten thousand strands of strength. You refined the Breeze Step intensely in the sudden snow, Proficiency +11]

He trained tirelessly like this.

Sun Kong, Jia Jie, and Bao Yongkang could only secretly call him a freak, a beast. In such weather, he still had to practice martial arts.

"He deserves to stand out. Master Li is truly Master Li."

Sun Kong wanted to imitate him, but as soon as he took a step, he was so cold his whole body trembled.

Forget about practicing martial arts or boxing; walking two steps was difficult.

Li Xian's eyelashes were frosted over, his skin cracked from the cold, but his expression was exceptionally determined.

Practicing boxing in the snow was indeed very difficult to adapt to. The world was bitterly cold, and even the operation of internal Qi seemed to have a hidden obstacle.

His movements were stiff and not agile.

For others, this way of practicing martial arts was actually like pulling up seedlings to help them grow, eager for quick success.

Like the "Breeze Step."

This leg technique trains the word "lightness," like a breeze brushing the willow. The movements don't necessarily have to be fast, but they must be smooth.

And when kicking in the wind and snow, the joints and limbs are stiff, and it is impossible to be smooth no matter what.

Doing so would have the opposite effect.

Even causing regression the more he practiced.

But Li Xian was different. The "Heaven's Way Rewards Diligence" destiny meant that for every bit of effort he put in, there was a corresponding reward.

As long as the method was correct, martial arts would only improve and never regress in the slightest.

"In such weather, isn't this just the time..."

"for me to overtake others?!"

Li Xian suddenly thought of this, feeling that although the world was cold, it contained infinite hope. He had a large amount of time each day to focus on practicing martial arts.

With no one to disturb him, his progress was naturally rapid.

[Four Directions Fist] could increase by [260] Proficiency per day, [Breeze Step] could increase by [190] Proficiency per day.

"Master Li, please sit, please sit, warm yourself up."

Sun Kong and the other two were completely convinced. Every time Li Xian returned to the room, the three of them immediately gave up the warmest spot.

Anyone with discerning eyes could see it.

If such a person did not die, he would definitely climb higher; they had to curry favor quickly.

"It's fine, you don't need to accommodate me."

Li Xian waved his hand, very casual.

After warming himself, he continued to go out and practice. When he couldn't stand the cold anymore, he would return to the room to warm himself by the fire.

He repeated this cycle.

Four days later, the wind and snow showed signs of abating, and Li Xian secretly lamented it was a pity.

[Four Directions Fist]
[Proficiency: 1591/5000 Great Completion]
[Description: You practiced boxing in the wind and snow, using the principles of the Four Directions Fist to comprehend the lost skill 'Hearing the Wind to Discern Position,' which complements the trait 'Hearing in All Directions.' The intent of the fist is vigorous and introverted, gradually approaching perfection.]

[Breeze Step]
[Proficiency: 419/1000 Proficient]
[Description: The leg strikes with a breeze, foot strength grows.]

Over these past few days, his martial arts had made good progress.

This harvest made Li Xian quite delighted. But if there was anything bad to say, it was that the food was too simple. Unable to go out these past few days, he had to make do with dry rations mixed with hot water.

For a martial artist, training relies on eating; "eating" comes first.

Unable to eat meat to supplement the body's blood and Qi would affect the progress of martial arts.

At noon that day.

The wind and snow finally stopped. The guards all walked out of their residences, heaving a long sigh of relief.

The long-absent sun shone on the earth. The snow in front of the door was piled up to a height of several zhang. Li Xian had been standing on the snowdrift to practice these past few days.

"Ah! Finally out!"

Bao Yongkang shouted loudly.

Li Xian walked into the sunlight, enjoying the temperature on his skin. A faint warmth rose, an indescribable comfort.

"Although the snowy days allowed me to practice martial arts freely... after all, it's better to have the sun."

Li Xian stretched, the bones and joints of his whole body cracking. It seemed as if an immense strength was hidden within his body.

Suddenly, he heard the sound of a gong coming from afar.

This was Luo Fang summoning the laborers again. This heavy snowstorm had caused thick snow and ice to accumulate inside and outside the manor.

The laborers were in for a busy time. For the next few days, they would likely only do one thing: shovel the ice and snow.

Pang Long, as soon as the wind and snow stopped, walked over enthusiastically, a smile on his face as he approached the crowd.

"Everyone, perk up. Li Xian, pick a few guards and quickly follow me to a place," Pang Long said cheerfully.

"Commander Pang, what is the matter?" Li Xian asked.

"It's good news! Hahaha," Pang Long put his arm around Li Xian's shoulder and laughed, "The Madam is going to open the cauldron again to boil [Refined Food]!"

"The Madam eats the meat, and we get to drink the soup."

"There happens to be a huge pile of snow in the manor, so we can make use of it!"

Speaking of this, Pang Long whispered to Li Xian, "Based on the Madam's temperament, since you contributed to this refined food, you might get a larger share!"
