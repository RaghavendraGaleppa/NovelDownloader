# Chapter 163: The Little Princess Jiang, and the Dugu Nine Swords!

"What's wrong?"

Li Mo was puzzled.

When Jiang Chulong raised her little face, he saw her white pupils clouded with tears.

She was crying?

Did she suddenly remember something unhappy?

But the corners of her slightly pale lips were raised, and that arc seemed more dazzling than the sunlight itself.

She stood there timidly, like a small white flower just blooming, welcoming the first drop of dew.

Little Li wanted to paint, but it seemed a bit inappropriate...

"I... I'm... happy..."

Jiang Chulong frantically wiped away her tears.

"You like it, then."

Li Mo sighed in relief and smiled. "If you like it, give it a try."

"Okay!"

Jiang Chulong nodded vigorously.

The peach blossom branch resonated softly in her hand, as if delighted to have found a new master.

There was no sword light, no sword energy.

She practiced simply like this, starting from the very beginning, going through what she had learned这段时间, starting from the most basic mid-grade sword art, and moving forward step by step.

Every now and then, she would timidly look back, glancing at Brother Li.

"I haven't seen you for a while, and Chulong has become so impressive."

"If you go to the Martial Dao Summit, you'll definitely surprise the swordsmen of Hengyun Sword City."

Li Mo applauded enthusiastically, as if he were seeing Jiang Chulong practice for the first time.

Who is the Primordial Heavenly尊? I don't really know him.

"Brother Li, are you... going on a... long trip?" Jiang Chulong asked, stunned. Even while she was distracted, she was still flawlessly executing a high-grade sword art.

"That's right."

"It's a pity you're only at the Internal Qi Realm. Most of the martial artists going there should be at the Divine Observation Realm."

"If you could pass the Sword Trial, you could go with me." Li Mo remembered that Hengyun Sword City didn't stop ordinary martial artists from participating.

It's just that for the vast majority of people, it would be a wasted trip.

Even the Clear Abyss Sect only sends the strongest disciples from each peak; it's meaningless for others to go.

"Go... with Brother Li?"

Jiang Chulong's pupils trembled slightly. She bit her lip and gripped the peach blossom branch tighter.

"Since we're on the beach, how can we not have these..."

As Li Mo spoke, he produced two bottles of cola and a few popsicles.

He had just popped open a cola to take a drink when he noticed the Chixiao sword hanging at his waist trembling slightly.

It seemed unable to contain its excitement, wanting to fly off to some place...

Li Mo was stunned and looked up.

Not far away.

It was clearly a beach, but in a daze, he saw a peach blossom forest growing wildly in the void, becoming exquisitely beautiful in an instant.

Her figure seemed to overlap with a certain silhouette in the unseen realm.

It was the swordsman who once plucked a peach blossom branch and turned it into a famous artifact.

The will lingering in that famous artifact actually manifested because of Jiang Chulong.

The swordsman in the green robe stood there, a faint worry between his brows. Upon seeing Jiang Chulong and Li Mo, he actually nodded slightly, then seemed to let go of his regrets.

A clear light shone brilliantly.

At the same time, a notification sounded in Li Mo's ears.

【Congratulations, Host. Your investment in Jiang Chulong's 'Peach Blossom Branch of the Jade Sword' helped her comprehend the Spring Breeze Sword Intent, elevating the 'Wild Grass Sword Sutra' to a high-grade martial art.】

【You have an investment feedback reward to claim.】

Li Mo stared blankly, not even looking at the reward.

Wait a minute...

My little Princess Jiang!

A famous artifact can be used to comprehend a Sword Intent?

Is there no justice? Is there no law?!

He originally thought that after reaching the Divine Observation Realm, he could achieve microscopic control over any martial art and technique, and his talent for swordsmanship should have improved a bit.

But he simply couldn't understand how Jiang Chulong had done it.

Even the Ice Cube wouldn't be able to do that, right?

Soon, the Sword Intent dissipated.

---

Jiang Chulong hugged the peach blossom branch, lowered her head, and asked nervously:

"Brother Li, is this... enough to go... with you?"

Li Mo: "..."

It could work, technically.

If you don't consider how many swordsmen in Hengyun Sword City would have their Dao hearts shattered.

"Ahem, yes," Li Mo said.

Jiang Chulong giggled, feeling a bit embarrassed from the praise:

"Chulong will... definitely not... embarrass Brother Li..."

"I completely believe you," said a certain Little Li who had spent several hundred years of martial dao insights without yet comprehending a Sword Intent.

Embarrass?

If it weren't for my thick skin, I'd be looking for a place to hide right now!

The word 'believe' hit her like a blow.

Jiang Chulong felt her head go dizzy, completely different from the feeling of comprehending the sword.

She was twisting the corner of her clothes, not knowing what to say, when...

"Here."

A popsicle was handed to her.

"I made it myself, try it," Li Mo said, sitting down on a lounge chair.

Jiang Chulong took a bite and shivered from the cold, closing her eyes.

It was sweet, but so cold...

She didn't dare to bite anymore, only daring to lick it gently like a little cat.

And so.

The two sat by the beach, feeling the slightly salty sea breeze, the heat blocked by the parasol, and the delicious popsicles and cola.

Jiang Chulong felt incredibly happy.

She felt this was the happiest day of her life. If this were a dream, she hoped she would never wake up...

"Brother Li... is so amazing."

"You can even... make... things like this."

"Unlike me... who... can't do anything..."

"....."

Li Mo fell silent for a moment, then suddenly said with a serious face:

"Chulong, promise me one thing."

"I promise!"

"But I haven't said what it is yet."

"What... what is it?"

Looking at the pure and innocent Little Princess Jiang blinking her eyes, Li Mo cleared his throat:

"If your swordsmanship becomes better than mine in the future, you still have to let me pat your head."

Hmm, who knows when 'in the future' will be.

.....

After spending a night in the World Seed.

Having promised Little Princess Jiang to come down the mountain to pick him up, Li Mo returned to the Autumn Water Pavilion.

"Right, I still haven't claimed the feedback reward."

"I wonder what it is..."

Li Mo finally had the time to check the system's records.

【Investment Feedback: 'Dugu Nine Swords'】

【'Dugu Nine Swords': Created by the Sword Demon Dugu Qiubai, its general principles are derived from the 'I Ching', encompassing all phenomena in the world. This martial art has no fixed rank; it will advance with your martial dao attainments, eventually reaching the level of 'Skill Approaching the Dao'.】

"!!"

Li Mo instantly became wide awake.

Even those who haven't read the novel know about this!

It can be said to be as thunderous as the name implies.

Moreover, the path of 'Skill Approaching the Dao' is one he has been walking on, but he was just groping his way forward.

This martial art points directly to the root of that path, undoubtedly serving as a guiding light for his sword dao!

"Claim it, claim it."

Little Li excitedly rubbed his hands together.

Similarly, there was no physical book for the sword art.

When he claimed it, the contents of the martial art flooded into his mind in a continuous stream.
