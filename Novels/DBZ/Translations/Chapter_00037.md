# Chapter 37: The Sky Above the Zhao Kingdom

In a relatively open area within a forest, Wei Qian sat cross-legged and decisively retrieved a high-grade Qi Restoration Pill from his storage bag, popping it into his mouth.

As soon as the pill entered his stomach, streams of pure medicinal energy flowed into his dantian, replenishing his spiritual power.

Heaven be praised—the two Wang Family cultivators chasing him had likely never even seen a high-grade Qi Restoration Pill in their lives, let alone had the luxury of consuming one.

"I've run three hundred li in one go. Those two must have nearly exhausted their recovery pills by now," Wei Qian thought to himself.

Indeed, all his previous actions had been part of a deliberate strategy.

Thirty percent of it was to exhaust his pursuers—their stamina, energy, and spiritual power. The remaining seventy percent was to put as much distance as possible between himself and those Foundation Establishment experts!

After all, the method he was about to employ was far too shocking.

If the two Li Family members saw it, they might not react strongly. But if the Wang Family cultivators witnessed it—especially their patriarch, Wang Fengri, who was as sinister as a viper and as ruthless as a wolf—it would spell disaster.

Wei Qian had no desire to draw the attention of such a venomous old snake.

Of course, it was only a matter of time before he did. But Wei Qian hoped to delay that moment for as long as possible—preferably until after he reached Foundation Establishment. By then, he was confident he could find refuge anywhere within Yunzhou.

After all, by that time, he would undoubtedly have reached the level of a second-rank alchemist.

"With my alchemical talent, I could even become an elder in the Ten Thousand Stars Sect," Wei Qian thought with some pride.

But for now, the most pressing matter was cutting off the two claws the Wang Family had extended toward him!

Once he fully refined the medicinal energy, Wei Qian exhaled deeply and stood up.

A hundred zhang ahead of him, the two Wang Family cultivators landed at the same time.

"Keep running! Why don't you run anymore?" Wang Thirteen taunted.

Wang Nine, however, wore a much graver expression, no longer looking down on Wei Qian as he had initially.

He fixed his gaze on Wei Qian and said coldly, "You're a body cultivator, aren't you?"

"At your age, achieving this level of cultivation in both body and qi is quite impressive."

"You don't seem to be from the Li Family. Are you one of their retainers? The Li Family is already on the verge of collapse. Why not switch to a more promising master?"

While feigning persuasion, Wang Nine subtly signaled Wang Thirteen with his eyes, preparing to execute a joint attack technique.

After rambling for a while, he finally heard Wei Qian respond with a single sentence:

---

"You talk too much."

Hmm? Wang Nine raised an eyebrow, but before he could react, a streak of black light shot straight toward his face.

He had anticipated this. With a flick of his finger, a shield artifact materialized in front of him.

Clang! The black light was deflected by the shield and sent flying backward.

"A mid-grade artifact—Iron Tortoise Shield!" Wang Nine laughed. "Are you so destitute that you can't even afford a proper artifact?"

Wei Qian smirked. "Then I'll have to hope your storage bag has enough valuables to help me out."

With a faint curl of his lips, Wei Qian uttered three words: "Fall. Fall. Fall."

In the next moment, Wang Nine, who had been standing firm moments ago, suddenly swayed before collapsing face-first onto the ground.

"Brother Nine!" Wang Thirteen cried out in alarm.

He turned to Wei Qian, his eyes burning with hatred. "Damn you! How did you ambush Brother Nine?"

He pulled out a talisman, ready to activate it, but a blinding flash of white light erupted before him. A cold voice echoed in his ears: "Like this."

Instinctively, he raised his arm to block, but his reaction was slowed by his earlier exhaustion.

He gritted his teeth and intercepted the attack with his bare hand.

"A needle artifact? It must be poisoned!" Wang Thirteen immediately deduced. He reached into his storage bag for an antidote pill—a top-grade first-rank pill from the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City.

Even the venom of a second-rank spirit beast could be neutralized by it.

But the moment Wei Qian's attack struck, he knew it was already too late.

"What kind of poison... How is this possible?" Younger and more resilient than Wang Nine, he managed to utter a final sentence before collapsing like his companion.

Wei Qian chuckled. "The power of a hundred-day wish isn't something you can break."

The potency of this poison was enough to kill an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator instantly. Wei Qian estimated that only a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator with a second-rank mid-grade antidote could suppress it—and even then, survival wasn't guaranteed.

"The fight ended too smoothly. No twists at all," Wei Qian mused to himself.

Then he laughed. "After all my preparations, if there were still surprises, that would truly defy reason."

Thrilling, life-and-death battles weren't his style. Watching them was fine—experiencing them firsthand was not.

---

Wei Qian preferred the path of the "Ten-Mile Slope Sword God"—quietly cultivating, steadily advancing, and then crushing his enemies with overwhelming power. That was true satisfaction!

With a flick of his fingers, two fireballs the size of heads erupted, engulfing the two corpses in roaring flames.

When the flames subsided, only two storage bags remained.

Wei Qian collected them, then approached the flying boat artifact and stowed it away as well.

Without pausing to inspect his spoils, he immediately set off again.

Three hundred li wasn't safe enough—he needed to go farther.

Two days later, in a mortal town fifty li from Mist Ridge Mountain.

Wei Qian sat by the window on the top floor of a tavern, gazing at the mist-shrouded mountain in the distance.

"From what I've observed these past few days, Mist Ridge Mountain seems unusually calm."

If the two Li Family Foundation Establishment cultivators had been defeated, the mountain wouldn't be this tranquil. At the very least, the protective formation would be operating nonstop.

A cultivation family without a Foundation Establishment patriarch would attract countless covetous eyes.

"I made a wish to the Dragon Pearl, asking for safety upon returning to Mist Ridge Mountain. The Pearl granted five days of protection—meaning the danger isn't severe."

"But why?"

Wang Fengri was ruthless and had even enlisted another Foundation Establishment ally. From any angle, the Wang Family shouldn't lose.

As he pondered, Wei Qian suddenly felt an overwhelming pressure sweep over him.

He instinctively dropped low, pressing himself against the table.

"A Golden Core—no, close but not quite. A Core Formation cultivator just passed overhead!" He raised his head sharply, staring toward Mist Ridge Mountain.

A massive flying boat was slowly descending onto the mountain.

The banner it bore was unmistakable—it belonged to the Ten Thousand Stars Sect, the sky above the Zhao Kingdom's cultivation world!
