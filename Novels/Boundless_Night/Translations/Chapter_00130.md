# Chapter 130: Migratory Birds from Afar

Chasing Light City, an ancient metropolis, bore the mottled marks of time. Within its walls lay a Level 4 Fire Spring, which, with human control, could illuminate the entire city as bright as day once dusk fell.

"Uncle Meng, it's really lively over there. A lot of people are placing bets; many bookmakers have opened up." Qin Ming stopped, quite eager.

He now possessed a modest fortune. His deceased opponents, such as Wang Nianzhu, Qi Huai'en, and Ge Qianxun, had generously bequeathed their Day Gold to him upon their deaths.

"Gambling is a very bad habit; you must break it," Meng Xinghai said sternly.

Qin Ming explained, "I'm about to embark on a distant journey for my studies. I want to buy a courtyard in a suitable major city to facilitate my cultivation."

Meng Xinghai said, "In truly influential major cities, you can see four-tusked white elephants on the streets and Azure Luan passing through the sky. They are places of abundant resources and exceptional talents. The housing prices in such places are far higher than you imagine; the little Day Gold you have isn't even enough to buy half a room, let alone a house with a courtyard."

Qin Ming realized he was still quite poor.

After being lectured, he thought it over and decided that placing bets wouldn't be very significant. Most of his Day Gold was stored at the City Lord's Mansion; he didn't carry much with him.

Behind them, Li Qingyun smiled, transmitting his voice discreetly, "Are these bookmakers reliable?"

"With your profound cultivation, are you afraid they'd renege? I'm certainly not," Meng Xinghai replied.

No one understood Qin Ming's true capabilities better than them. Why wouldn't they participate in a sure-win situation? The two exchanged a smile.

As for the young man in front, he only had twenty-odd pieces of Day Gold in total; why bother getting involved? Such a gambling habit shouldn't be indulged; he needed to be disciplined.

Qin Ming stopped and said, "Uncle Meng, we're losing out big time! Look over there, Chasing Light City is selling tickets, otherwise, you can't watch the battle. The prices are ridiculously high!"

He finally understood why he could hear people hotly discussing it on the streets, with even passersby talking about the combat between the two cities. Clearly, someone was fanning the flames, deliberately hyping it up.

Meng Xinghai remained calm. "It's fine," he said. "A portion of these revenues belongs to our Crimson Cloud City."

Qin Ming was lost in thought. A single combat, yet business opportunities were everywhere!

The martial arts arena in Chasing Light City was vast, its ground paved with the hardest black-gold stone.

It featured high platforms and VIP rooms, with astonishingly high seat prices, yet tickets had long been sold out.

After entering, Qin Ming scanned his surroundings. In the regular viewing area, those in front had seats, while those further back could only stand. The crowd was a dense mass, completely filling the space.

"Recently, people outside have been saying that our Chasing Light City's 'number one' is just a 'candlelight' in name, and would be utterly crushed by other cities, unable to contend with a bright moon. Ugh, it really doesn't sit well with me."

"Yeah, they can only contend with Crimson Cloud City. I guess it's like a Crouching Dragon meeting a fledgling Phoenix; let's see if there are any surprises."

Qin Ming stood there expressionless. His opponent hadn't even entered the arena, yet this group of spectators had already "made their move," their words quite venomous.

From the VIP seating, he saw a black-clad woman, slender and elegant, like an immortal lotus rooted in the mundane world. As she sat there quietly, she exuded an ethereal, otherworldly charm.

Although she had altered her appearance, Qin Ming could still guess that she was likely Li Qingyue.

The secret scripture brought from the depths of the Night Mist World normally required outsiders to travel to the Outer Lands if they wished to view it at a cost.

Li Qingyue now possessed an object close to immortal, which significantly elevated her status, surpassing other core disciples. If she wished to read it, she could now keep it by her side.

It so happened that the Outer Lands Pure Land had arranged an opportunity for her to bathe in a spirit pond rich with immortal aura, to enhance her physique. She was passing through this place, bringing the book to meet an old friend.

Qin Ming also wanted to use this opportunity to transmit the two scriptures he had obtained from the near-immortal object and the metallic remnant papers to her.

***

Chasing Light City's "number one" entered the martial arts arena. He was half a head taller than average, with a robust and powerful physique, well-defined features, and bright eyes that seemed to flow with a faint fiery glow.

"Huh, it's not Jiang Hong. Who is this? I haven't seen him before."

Many people showed surprise. They had originally thought it would be the city's so-called genius, Jiang Hong. But it turned out the "number one" designated by the City Lord wasn't him?

"I am Chen Yuan." The entering youth announced his name. There was a heroic spirit about his eyes and brows. Clad in crimson-gold armor, his entire demeanor was extraordinary.

Some people outside the arena immediately understood. This was a "migratory bird" of the Grand Examination period, a top-tier talent who had temporarily "migrated" from another city. To secure the title of "number one," he had chosen to come to a city with fewer competitors.

Immediately, many people's eyes lit up. This made it quite interesting; this person could very well be a "number two" or "number three" from some major city.

Clearly, Chen Yuan, the "migratory bird" of the Grand Examination period, was definitely a cut above the local Jiang Hong in strength!

"You truly enjoy treading on the edge of the red line." Meng Xinghai's expression was displeased as he looked at the somewhat ethereal-looking middle-aged man beside him.

Qi Daoming smiled. "He's not an Anomaly; just a 'migratory bird' from the Eighth Rebirth, a small skirmish. Our two cities' combat will have shared profits, so it's a win-win."

Meng Xinghai glanced at him. "He can step into the Outer Saint realm at any time; his Heavenly Light is already overflowing."

Qi Daoming laughed, "Brother Meng, you're so concerned, don't tell me you placed a heavy bet on the outcome? In that case, I'd be very much looking forward to it."

Meng Xinghai said, "You'd best prepare your 'Fallen Fruits.' I heard this year's quality is excellent, each one crystal clear and transparent, flowing with five-colored divine light."

The mysterious ancient tree rooted in the Heavenly Light Pool, whose tender branches and buds newly grown in early spring, would be extremely precious five-colored spirit branches if taken outside.

The fruits it bears, needless to say, are astonishingly valuable!

Currently, the old tree rooted in the Heavenly Light Pool has just bloomed and borne fruit, far from mature, and not yet in season for harvesting.

Although the branches were densely covered with fruits, constantly impacted by the Heavenly Light, most couldn't hold on and would fall prematurely. This is the origin of the "Fallen Fruits."

After the two youths in the arena announced their names, they immediately began to fight, without any unnecessary words.

The two moved like lightning, colliding swiftly and then separating.

Qin Ming had even slain some Outer Saints, so he naturally had no fear of the youth before him. However, he was holding back. If he were to immediately defeat Chen Yuan, an Eighth Rebirth cultivator, it would likely "startle the snake by beating the grass," making some members of the Cui family even more agitated.

A faint golden glow flowed over his body; this was the Golden Light Shield he had cultivated.

According to Qin Ming's spiritual resonance with that ancient book, there was once a woman who cultivated her Golden Light to be thicker than city walls, standing within it with an aura of invincibility against all techniques.

Chen Yuan was actually very strong, an Eighth Rebirth cultivator with over six thousand jin of strength. At the same time, Heavenly Light overflowed from his body, carrying a faint fiery glow.

He charged forward, his footsteps cracking the solid black-gold stone ground, which was comparable to hardened iron. The amplification of several thousand jin of strength made him appear like a colossal beast.

His Heavenly Light energy was like a fiery glow, subtly emanating from his body, making his hair strands appear crystal clear and shimmering with a fiery red luster.

With a boom, he unleashed a punch, and astonishingly, lightning and fire light manifested in the air, creating a breathtaking sight.

Qin Ming's expression was serious. This Chen Yuan's strength was indeed formidable. If he were to truly advance to the Outer Saint realm, he would be a cut above many of those Qin Ming had slain on Mount Luofu.

Just as Meng Xinghai had said, true geniuses disdained serving as Golden Armored Guards. Of course, a few exceptions were invited to assist in battles.

"A rare lightning-fire cultivation method, combined with Eighth Rebirth cultivation—he indeed deserves to be a city's number one." This was Qin Ming's assessment of him.

With a bang, he reached out and seized the fist radiating with lightning and fire.

Instantly, a muffled thunder-like sound seemed to echo in the void.

The golden light on Qin Ming's hand was incredibly dense. For him to have cultivated the Golden Light Shield technique to such a degree at the Rebirth stage was truly rare.

Chen Yuan's lightning-fire energy could actually be faintly discharged, but it couldn't penetrate that layer of golden light.

The black-gold stone ground beneath his feet developed many cracks, then shattered, as lightning and fire Heavenly Light surged forth from under his feet.

"He blocked the lightning-fire energy? Is he cultivating a body-protection technique? On the surface, it doesn't seem like the method from the silk scroll, but it's hard to say what's truly inside."

"His strength is excessive!"

At this moment, in a VIP room, Cui He and Cui Shuining were conversing, closely observing Qin Ming's performance.

Both of them looked serious, unanimously agreeing that after Qin Ming embarked on the Rebirth Path, his performance was definitely on par with an Anomaly, perhaps even stronger.

This made their feelings complicated. Cui Chongxuan, whom their family had meticulously cultivated, was currently only transforming towards becoming an Anomaly, relying on the Six Imperial Heart Scripture.

Qin Ming and Chen Yuan exchanged blows rapidly. Qin Ming's golden Heavenly Light energy-infused palm and Chen Yuan's lightning-fire-infused fist continuously collided, creating deafening impacts that made the large martial arts arena seem to tremble slightly.

Li Qingyue smiled. She knew Qin Ming was holding back; otherwise, what suspense would there be?

However, the surrounding spectators were all in an uproar, for this was the kind of performance expected of a "number one" from a major city.

It was one thing for the "migratory bird" who came for the Grand Examination to be powerful, but the youth from Crimson Cloud City was surprisingly formidable as well, capable of matching him blow for blow.

In the martial arts arena, Chen Yuan's lightning-fire Heavenly Light energy on his fists grew even more astonishing, emitting rumbling thunderous sounds.

However, Qin Ming's Golden Light Shield had been cultivated to a higher level. With his left fist and right palm, both radiating brilliant golden light, he met the blows head-on, completely capable of withstanding them.

Suddenly, his expression slightly changed as he noticed fluctuations of conscious spiritual light from Chen Yuan's glabella.

Is this someone cultivating two paths simultaneously? Qin Ming realized that Qi Daoming had indeed found a formidable individual, intending to defeat Meng Xinghai's Crimson Cloud City.

He didn't want to continue clashing. Suddenly accelerating, with a bang, he pushed aside his opponent's fist print with one palm, while his other hand, clenched into a fist, rapidly struck his opponent's body.

Evidently, Chen Yuan's conscious spiritual light was still far from Pure Yang, conflicting with his lightning-fire Heavenly Light energy and thus unable to burst forth simultaneously. While he was subtly changing his attack method, he "accidentally" took the hit, being struck by two consecutive punches, sending him flying horizontally.

"So intense, so spectacular!"

"This battle should be on the front page of the Nightly News!" someone shouted.

The spectators all clenched their fists, immensely excited.

Those in the know, however, were speechless, feeling that this was a battle that should have ended long ago.

Qin Ming paid no attention to the surrounding cheers and left the arena directly.

Meng Xinghai smiled, "A good harvest today. Hmm, Qi Daoming, your expression seems a bit stiff. You didn't place a huge bet, did you? A small gamble brings pleasure, but don't be too greedy."

"My child..." Outside the martial arts arena, an old man chuckled, his face full of benevolence, and waved at Qin Ming.

Qin Ming's hair stood on end. That was the Cui family's Fifth Grand-Uncle. The old fellow who had induced him to cultivate the silk scroll back then had actually come in person. This was an incredibly dangerous moment.

Black mist permeated the area as a figure silently approached the Cui family's Fifth Grand-Uncle. Li Qingyun appeared, draped an arm around Old Man Cui's neck, and said, "Old brother, long time no see. Come on, let's go have a couple of drinks."

"I..." The Cui family's Fifth Grand-Uncle was startled, astonished that someone had gotten so close without him noticing. His body tensed, unable to move with his neck held, he was actually escorted away.

Not far away, Cui He and Cui Shuining were horrified. That was the Cui family's Fifth Grand-Uncle, whose strength was terrifying, yet he was carried off under someone's armpit, unable to struggle.

Goosebumps rose on both of them; they were genuinely frightened and turned to leave.

"Here, I've brought the complete scripture out for you."

In a quiet room, Li Qingyue smiled, radiant and beautiful like morning clouds breaking through mist. Her dark hair shimmered with a translucent luster, and a faint immortal mist wreathed her body.

The book was not thin. Qin Ming had only flipped through a dozen pages before realizing he had previously underestimated it. It contained specific methods on how to improve oneself.

"And this..." Li Qingyue placed some metal blocks on the table. "The Hegemon's Spear was too conspicuous, so I dismantled it and extracted the jade-iron from within."

She then added, "As for those 'unusual metals' similar in material to the Eight Trigrams Furnace, I only managed to obtain two pieces."

Qin Ming looked at her and smiled. "I also have a gift for you."
