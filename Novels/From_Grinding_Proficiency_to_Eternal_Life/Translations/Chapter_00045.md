# Chapter 45: Muscle Tempering Perfection

Although it possesses techniques for maneuvering in close quarters, it pales in comparison to long-distance running and straight-line bursts of speed.

Recalling the 800-mile barren river and icy plains, the Leg-Traveling Technique was indeed the most suitable martial art for such harsh environments.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh with emotion. Every time Li Haomiao imparted a technique, it was done with careful consideration, and every single martial art had its unique purpose.

"You earnestly practiced the Leg-Traveling Technique and discovered a trick you had never noticed before. You found that by applying force this way, your speed increased by a fraction. Leg-Traveling Technique proficiency has increased."

"You carefully contemplated the cultivation essentials of the Leg-Traveling Technique. Reviewing the old to understand the new, you perceived a bottleneck you had previously overlooked. You suddenly saw the light, and your force application became increasingly smooth and effortless. Leg-Traveling Technique proficiency has increased."

"..."

"Your Leg-Traveling Technique proficiency is full. Promotion successful."

"Your Leg-Traveling Technique has reached Great Perfection."

With each round of practice, Xu Yunfan felt a marvelous change occurring within his body.

When the proficiency of the Leg-Traveling Technique continuously climbed, and the interface prompted him that it had reached Great Perfection, scenes of cultivation in the mountains suddenly flooded his mind.

It was a dense mountain forest, with ancient trees towering into the sky and mist winding through the branches.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath of the moist air in the mountain forest, which carried the fragrance of grass and trees. His legs slightly bent, his knees flexing to the perfect angle, like an arrow about to leave the string, poised to strike.

In an instant, the muscles in his legs ignited like gunpowder, erupting with astonishing power.

Every muscle fiber contracted at high speed, like taut steel cables, transmitting an endless stream of power to his calves.

His calf muscles acted like a precision power unit, the immense force transmitted from above and pushed from below propelling his body forward at high speed.

When applying force, he could clearly feel the rapid flow of blood within his muscles.

His footfalls were light and swift; the moment his toes touched the ground, he sprang up again, like a dragonfly skimming the water.

The span and rhythm of every step were grasped with pinpoint accuracy. The buffering of his leg upon landing and the transition to the next application of force were seamless, his movements flowing like water.

In the high-speed run, Xu Yunfan's breathing and the exertion of his legs were perfectly coordinated.

His breathing was steady and deep, his breath flowing through his body in rhythm with his steps.

As he moved through the mountain forest, his gaze remained focused and sharp, constantly observing his surroundings.

While sprinting, he was not slowed in the slightest by the obstacles of the forest's vegetation. Instead, he skillfully utilized the gaps between trees, leveraging the changes in airflow caused by the trees to adjust his speed and direction, actually growing even faster.

When encountering obstacles ahead, he could predict them in advance, tilting his body slightly to pass by with the smallest angle. The entire process was smooth and natural, without the slightest pause.

With day after day of cultivation and year after year of running, one day suddenly arrived.

Just as he was running at full speed, immersed in this ultimate experience of power and speed, he suddenly felt as if he had merged with everything around him.

The sound of the wind in the forest, the rustling of leaves, and the chirping of birds all became part of his body's rhythm.

He suddenly realized that the force application and operation of the Leg-Traveling Technique lay not only in the strength and speed of his legs but also in the high coordination of all parts of his body, as well as the harmonious coexistence with the surrounding environment.

In an instant, a stream of heat surged from the soles of his feet and rapidly spread throughout his body.

The strength in his legs seemed to undergo a qualitative leap; his muscle contractions became more powerful, and his speed reached a new level.

His figure became even more indistinct in the mountain forest, as if he had transformed into a gust of wind, howling past.

The Leg-Traveling Technique, Great Perfection!

At the same time, as Xu Yunfan digested the cultivation memories in his mind, several warm currents appeared out of thin air within his body, constantly flowing through his four limbs and all his bones. His legs were the focus, with over half of the warm currents flowing continuously through them.

The muscles in his legs began to undergo obvious changes.

The originally robust muscles became even more compact. Every muscle fiber was constantly reorganizing and strengthening, as if forged from steel.

The contours of the muscles became clearer, the lines smoother, and they were filled with explosive power.

The major tendons in his legs also grew continuously thicker, becoming incredibly tough and resilient, like thick ropes connecting his bones and muscles.

Every time he applied force, he could feel the transmission of that immense power through the tendons, causing a buzzing sound.

And the skin on his legs became even tougher, like a layer of hard armor capable of withstanding external impacts. The color of his skin turned slightly red, as if the vigorous blood and Qi were about to pierce through the skin.

Under the sunlight, the surface of his bright red legs seemed to be covered with a faint halo, exuding a vibrant vitality.

The Leg-Traveling Technique, a muscle tempering and lightness skill, had reached Great Perfection.

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes and exhaled a visible white arrow of breath from his throat. It was so powerful that it actually caused the snow in front of him to roll upward. The major tendons in his legs emitted a buzzing sound, like a taut bowstring.

The Achilles tendon, which had been bulging from exertion, had now retracted to its normal state. But when he flicked his fingers, it actually produced a crisp sound similar to the clashing of metal.

This was the manifestation of the tendons being tempered to Great Perfection, the transformation of silk into steel.

With a thought, he took a step and shot out more than a dozen meters. He lightly leaped over the courtyard and landed in the Clear Water River.

His toes were as flexible as hands, constantly stirring the water, allowing him to stabilize his entire body on the surface of the river from just his ankles.

Treading on Water!

Xu Yunfan was immensely excited. He had never imagined that relying solely on body movements, he could stand on water without sinking, remaining immersed for three minutes without falling.

After remaining silent for about three minutes, Xu Yunfan felt his legs had reached their limit. He stopped moving and fell into the water.

Although the attribute panel provided a large amount of skill related to his cultivation of the Leg-Traveling Technique after it advanced to Great Perfection, the changes to his body in reality occurred within just a few breaths.

The rapid increase in his physical constitution gave him a surging sense of power, as if he could pull down a mountain.

This was a sense of unreality caused by the rapid surge in his strength. It would only need a moment to digest, and this surging state would subside.

Xu Yunfan washed away the fine sweat that had seeped out from his skin due to the rapid strengthening and transformation of his constitution, while observing the changes on the attribute panel.

'Leg-Traveling Technique 0/5000 (Great Perfection)

Special Effects: Scaling Walls and Roofs, Running Like a Fierce Horse, Treading on Water, Agile Ape Leaping, Iron Feet and Copper Ankles, Tendons Like Silk'

The physical enhancements brought by the special effects after the Leg-Traveling Technique reached Great Perfection were incredibly strong!

Xu Yunfan felt his body was lighter than ever before. It seemed that with a light tap of his toes, he could easily leap onto a roof, or wade through water with his ankles bare.

Muscle tempering lightness skills are considered extremely rare.

Although the name "Leg-Traveling Technique" is rather common, the enhancement it provides is simply unimaginable.
