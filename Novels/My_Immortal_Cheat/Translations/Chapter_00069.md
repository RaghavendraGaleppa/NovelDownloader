# Chapter 69: The Bustling City

The surrounding runes dispersed, revealing the scene before them: an ancient bronze hall. Like the entire colossal city, it exuded an ancient and profound aura, very simple, without excessive decoration, only four dragon-coiled bronze pillars supporting the grand hall.

In the center of the bronze hall stood a person clad in azure-gold battle armor. Even their head was concealed, with only a pair of eyes visible through the armor. Their pupils were like beast eyes, their green light intimidating and imbued with a demonic quality.

Upon seeing them being guided here, the person stepped forward, their battle armor clanking.

"Marquis Wen has gone to attend the Heavengate Council, so I have been tasked with receiving you," the azure-armored general said as he approached, his voice muffled.

The Marquis Wen he spoke of was the leader of the Tianqin Sect's garrison stationed here.

"Understood. Please lead us to our resting place," Zhou Yan replied, his figure tall and slender, possessing an indefinable temperament. As the Second Prince, he held the highest status among the group.

The azure-armored general said nothing, turning to lead the way, and the others followed.

Stepping out of the grand hall, Zhou Tian noticed that nearly all the surrounding palaces resembled the building behind them. However, most of these palaces were vacant. Perhaps in ancient times, this place was bustling with people, but now it seemed somewhat deserted.

Following the azure-armored general, they weaved through the palace complex, turning left and right, for about half an hour before finally reaching their designated lodging.

It was a mansion-hall. Two guards stood at its entrance, their bodies encased in obsidian-like armor, holding silver spears, their vital energy surging.

Upon seeing the azure-armored general approach, they did not salute, standing like two metallic statues.

"This is your residence. I shall take my leave now. Marquis Wen will arrive later," the azure-armored general said from the doorway, showing no intention of entering. After Zhou Yan nodded, he turned and departed.

The group entered the mansion-hall.

"It's surprisingly crude..." Zhou Zui remarked, looking at the two rows of rooms.

"These palaces were originally built for warfare; why would they expend so much effort on decoration?" Zhou Yan explained.

Afterward, everyone chose their rooms. Zhou Yan and the others then told Zhou Tian and the rest not to wander off casually, while they themselves mysteriously departed to an unknown destination.

The room's decor was still very simple, consisting only of a bed and a table.

Barely two minutes after Zhou Tian sat on the bed, a knock sounded, and then Zhou Zui carefully pushed the door open.

"Zhou Tian, come on, let's go out and explore together."

Zhou Tian lay on the bed. Although it was made of wood, lying on it wasn't uncomfortable at all; instead, it felt quite refreshing and invigorating.

Hearing Zhou Zui, Zhou Tian turned over and said, "No thanks. Go find someone else; I want to sleep!"

"You've come to this magnificent city, and you don't want to explore?" Zhou Zui asked.

"You're definitely going to look for a brothel again, and you can't even truly partake. What's the point? Just stay put, Mr. Virgin." Zhou Tian saw through him clearly; as someone with a girlfriend, he wouldn't go to such places of ill repute.

"You..." Zhou Zui choked for a moment. After a pause, his eyes darted around, and he spoke, "Don't you want to know where to take your Tian Ling when she arrives in a few days?"

"..." Zhou Tian climbed out of bed, straightened his clothes, and seriously told Zhou Zui, "Let's go, quickly."

Zhou Zui gave him an exasperated look, a typical case of a man forgetting his brothers once he had a woman.

Signaling Zhou Tian to be quiet, Zhou Zui cautiously opened the door, carefully checking for any movement in the other rooms, then waved Zhou Tian to hurry out.

"Why are you so sneaky?" Zhou Tian asked once they were out of the mansion-hall. Was it really necessary to act like thieves just to go for a stroll?

"We can't let Liu Yan know, otherwise..." Zhou Zui explained in a low voice. Although he didn't finish his sentence, Zhou Tian understood. With Liu Yan around, they couldn't go anywhere.

Just now, when they were drawn in by the pillar of light and passed over this palace complex, Zhou Zui had already memorized all the routes.

Following him through twists and turns, they exited the palace complex. Perhaps there was a sound-dampening formation within the complex, which explained why they couldn't hear any noise even when near a bustling market. But now, as they emerged from the palace complex, the cries of vendors assailed their ears.

"Fiery Red Fruit Skewers, Lightning Crystal Fruit, sweet and crispy!"

"Thousand-year Medicinal Ginseng Buns, thin skin, generous filling!"

"Am I on a giant city in the void, or in the Imperial Capital?" Zhou Zui was utterly dumbfounded.

Upon inquiry, they learned that the food being sold was indeed extraordinary. They were genuinely medicinal ginseng buns, thousand-year fiery red fruits, thunder bird grilled wings, and so on—not false advertising.

This surprised Zhou Tian and Zhou Zui even further. Even in a true Imperial Capital, such items might not be readily available for sale.

On the wide streets, people came and went. All those who could reach this place were extraordinary cultivators, some even riding divine steeds.

Nearly every mount was an ancient exotic species, swallowing clouds and spitting mist, their scales shimmering brilliantly, like dragons emerging from an abyss, like phoenixes singing across the nine heavens.

The two walked along the streets of Heavengate. Although both came from prominent families, they felt like country bumpkins here, finding everything remarkably novel.

"Specialties from the Land of the Forsaken Gods! Come and take a look!"

Suddenly, a hawker's cry drew Zhou Tian and Zhou Zui's attention. Zhou Zui turned his head and asked, "Want to take a look?"

"Sure."

The two reached a consensus.

Approaching the stall, they saw a burly middle-aged man hawking, shirtless, revealing a bronze physique. Beside him lay a gray wolf.

The gray wolf was covered in scarlet scales like a fiery haze, gleaming with precious light. The mane on its neck and back was as lustrous as silk, a foot long, flickering like flames—it was incredibly majestic.

This powerful cultivator, who should have been galloping through the void, now wore a wide smile, hawking like a common street vendor.

On the ground, laid out on a green beast hide, were several translucent, rhomboid crystals. They appeared machine-cut, with perfectly regular facets, emitting a hazy, colorful glow, exquisitely beautiful.

"Just Saint-level divine cores, not worth much..." An individual nearby, clearly a seasoned Heavengate veteran, casually examined the items.

"Brother, now hold on..." The stall owner wasn't bothered; this person was clearly trying to haggle.

The two stood nearby, eavesdropping, and learned a lot. Finally, both parties agreed on a satisfactory price. The veteran pocketed all the divine cores, and the large stall owner, elated with his earnings, departed.

"Come on, follow him," Zhou Zui said in a low voice, watching the direction the burly man had left.

"What are you doing? Robbing him?" Zhou Tian asked curiously.

"How could I?" Zhou Zui gave him a speechless look. This burly man could sell Saint-level divine cores, meaning he was at least of that rank. Robbing him? Wasn't that courting death?

"Someone like him, after selling off what he hunted, will definitely go to entertain himself next. And where do men go for entertainment, you ask..." Zhou Zui analyzed quite seriously for Zhou Tian.
