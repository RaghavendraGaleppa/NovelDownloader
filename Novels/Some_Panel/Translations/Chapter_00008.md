# Chapter 8: Profound Fortune

After traversing the previous sea region, the large ship returned to its predetermined course. Emerging from the dark skies and once again seeing the blue sky and vast ocean, everyone's suppressed spirits were greatly relieved. The journey thereafter was smooth and uneventful.

Following his recent experiences, Yang Ji had clearly become the most sought-after person on the ship. Jin Dafu, now quite generous, set out chairs and brought out spirit wine and spirit fruits, entertaining Yang Ji and the others. The cultivators also opened up, gathering on the deck to chat. Their conversations revolved around Yang Ji's bizarre experiences, inquiring how he had sensed the arrival of the natural disasters and what omens he had received.

However, Yang Ji had simply made it all up. Naturally, he wouldn't elaborate, merely hinting that it was pure coincidence, not an ability he had cultivated. Instead, he recounted the hardships he suffered in his childhood, hoping to make them pity him and believe he was incapable of foreseeing much danger. Yet, the others didn't see it that way; they only felt his experiences were legendary and expressed great admiration. Though he hadn't sensed minor disasters and suffered some hardships, he had saved his life during major calamities—this was surely his destiny. As the others spun increasingly fantastical tales, growing more convinced of his special nature, Yang Ji subtly changed the subject, turning the conversation to their own sea expeditions.

Everyone was happy to share interesting anecdotes and experiences from their adventures with Yang Ji. For instance, where to typically find submerged stones, how to search for them, what they looked like, and how to determine their grade. They spoke of which sea areas spirit herbs usually grew in and what made those areas unique. They detailed precautions for hunting demonic beasts, as well as their habits and weaknesses. They explained how to preserve one's life when encountering a stronger demonic beast, how to avoid provoking high-level demonic beasts, and how to self-rescue when trapped in perilous terrain.

Listening to their talk, Yang Ji also came to understand the arduousness of a cultivator's sea expedition—cultivation was truly earned with their lives. These experiences were mostly their personal accounts, some gained at the cost of life itself. Yang Ji kept a small mental notebook, diligently recording every word they spoke. Through this conversation, Yang Ji gained immensely. It truly exemplified the saying, "What is learned on paper is superficial; one must practice to truly understand." He presumed that when he himself went to sea, he would gain even deeper insights. Books only provided general information; the knowledge required for genuine sea exploration was vast.

As they chatted, the sky gradually darkened. Night had fallen. Chen De and the other cultivators returned to their cabins to rest. However, after the incident with the extreme purple sky lightning, Yang Ji dared not enter the cabin and remained on the deck.

He simultaneously circulated his cultivation method to absorb spiritual energy and kept a vigilant eye on the sea, guarding against any unexpected natural disaster. Jin Dafu also remained on the deck, still shaken by fear, accompanying Yang Ji. Above, the full moon hung like a disc, and countless stars sparkled freely. Endless soft moonlight poured down, illuminating the distant sea surface, where the constantly folding waves reflected the light. Although it was night, the sky and sea remained relatively bright.

One cultivated, one drank. Yang Ji and Jin Dafu sat in silence. Suddenly, a soft gasp escaped Yang Ji's lips.

"Brother Yang, what's wrong? Did you sense another great terror?" Jin Dafu, still preoccupied with the previous incident, immediately tensed and asked. Inside the cabin, Chen De, who was meditating, also heard the conversation outside with his profound cultivation. He abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze subtly shifting outwards.

"No, no!" Yang Ji shook his head. He hadn't seen any great terror; instead, he had discovered a great surprise. Information suddenly appeared on the sea surface ahead:

【Ahead on the sea, a Level 3 Horned Dragon Lobster, currently absorbing moonlight essence, suddenly caught sight of the large ship bearing down on it. Startled, it dove deep into the ocean.】

A Level 3 Horned Dragon Lobster! Seeing this notification, Yang Ji's heart stirred. His hand instinctively pressed against his sword, wanting to dive down and slay it with a single strike. The meat of a Level 3 Horned Dragon Lobster was tender and delicious, a treasure reserved for great figures, and could fetch the value of a Level 6 demonic beast, easily several thousand spirit stones. Yang Ji almost drooled, wanting to plunge into the seabed and capture it.

But under the watchful eyes of everyone, how could he dare? Wouldn't that expose his "golden finger"? He couldn't very well say his eyelid was twitching again, could he? Although the horned dragon lobster tempted him, and despite its immense value, Yang Ji maintained his self-control. As he watched the distant sea area, he could only sigh with regret. What a pity. He had senselessly missed such a valuable demonic beast. One must understand that some cultivators might search the vast ocean for months without finding a single demonic beast. Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator like Chen De couldn't guarantee finding a demonic beast within five days, relying instead on baiting pills to slowly locate them.

The path of cultivation emphasizes two things: aptitude and profound fortune. If aptitude is lacking, one must rely on fortune; if both are absent, one might as well give up. Yang Ji's fortune was indeed profound. As night fell, those nocturnal demonic beasts gradually began to emerge, leaving their caves in search of food.

As the large ship continued its voyage, Yang Ji saw two more demonic beasts that ordinary cultivators would find difficult to locate. There was a Level 10 Demonic Beast, the [Black-Striped Shark]. This creature radiated malevolence, brimming with killing intent as it stared at the massive ship, almost ready to attack. Yang Ji, merely by reading the few words of the display, could feel the intense pressure it exerted. A Level 10 demonic beast was equivalent to a great master at the tenth level of Qi Condensation. In the ocean, human cultivators generally found it difficult to defeat demonic beasts of the same level. If Yang Ji were to encounter such a behemoth in the sea, he would surely die. The ocean, while full of opportunities, was also rife with danger.

Aside from the Level 10 demonic beast he had seen earlier, what was even more vexing and made Yang Ji's heart itch was a Level 4 [Suction-Cup Squid] that was clinging to the bottom of the ship, hitching a ride all the way. He truly wanted to dive down and strike it with his sword. A Level 4 demonic beast was worth about six hundred spirit stones. These precious spirit stones were right beneath the ship, making him itch with unbearable desire.

However, Yang Ji managed to restrain himself. He resisted this temptation. Because he had gradually grown numb to it. As the large ship continued its journey, he saw more and more demonic beasts. There was a Level 4 [Exploding Fish], a Level 2 [Water Droplet Fish], a Level 9 [Longevity Turtle], a Level 10 [Ten-Whiskered Catfish], a Level 7 [Eight-Eyed Eel], and a Level 2 [Ghost-Faced Fish].

By dawn, when the large ship reached Tian Shui Island, a total of thirteen demonic beasts had been spotted. What seemed like opportunities often hid great perils; if one failed to slay a demonic beast and was instead devoured, there would only be eternal regret. Although demonic beasts were valuable, Yang Ji remained clear-headed. He had indeed seen many demonic beasts along the way, but to his disappointment, he hadn't discovered any ores, spirit veins, or spirit herbs. Occasionally, there was a message displaying a submerged stone, but it was only low-grade, not worth many spirit stones.

The next day was spent resting on Tian Shui Island. Yang Ji, as was his custom, wandered around the island. With a thousand spirit stones in his possession, he frequented various scattered stalls, hoping to unearth a treasure. Unfortunately, every cultivator there was shrewd; their valuable items had long been appraised by major shops. Dissatisfied with the prices, and given the rarity of their items, they brought them to individual stalls, hoping to encounter a generous and easily duped buyer. Yang Ji walked around for a while and had to return disappointed.

The next day, he returned to Nanfeng Island with the ship; the journey back was also smooth. Upon their return, Jin Dafu, as if fearing Yang Ji would run off, immediately arranged for a property for him in the city. Yang Ji was delighted. Since he had already agreed to the position of Ship Guardian, he gladly accepted.

Now, he gazed at the three wooden houses before him, nestled within a quiet courtyard. There was grass, stone paths, green plants, and fresh flowers—everything one could wish for. It was more than spacious enough for one person, and situated on the outskirts of Nanfeng City, backed by green mountains, it was tranquil and pleasant, making it convenient for practicing spells. Yang Ji was very satisfied; he had finally settled down here.
