Chapter 178: Body Radiating Divine Light, Spine Like a Divine Mountain

The night passed without a word.

The next morning, young sparrows chirped early. It was autumn outside but spring within. The climate was pleasant, and the scenery beautiful.

Li Xian rose at the辰时 (Chen hour, 7-9 AM). He pushed open the window. Seeing the scenery of the inner courtyard, his heart relaxed. A red flower hung down into the room,娇艳欲滴 (charming and dripping with beauty).

Although the room was not large, behind a screen lay a pool of hot water. It was connected to the earth's crust and groundwater, flowing constantly throughout the year, warm and suitable.

Li Xian jumped into the pool, soaking in the clear water.

The fatigue from last night vanished completely.

The water was clear and moist, light as gauze and silk, as if it had no weight at all. Li Xian submerged himself in the pool, playing freely in all directions. It felt like swimming through heaven and earth, floating in the air, an indescribable sense of freedom.

Li Xian sighed: "This level of martial artist really knows how to enjoy life. It makes sense; living for a long time, one naturally needs to enjoy it."

Next to the hot pool stood a jade platform, on which lay a piece of white jade, the size of a palm. A gentle touch made the white jade secrete fragrant dew. Used for washing, it could keep the body fragrant for a whole day, free from dirt and grime.

This jade was called "Deep Dew Jade," obtained from the deep sea. It was extremely expensive and deeply loved by women. It belonged to the category of "vulgar trinkets."

Li Xian washed himself roughly and dressed. As usual, he helped Madam Wen braid her long hair, put on her ornaments, inserted a silver hairpin, and hung earrings... all sorts of things.

Madam Wen asked: "Did you rest well last night?"

"Very well," Li Xian said.

"Last time I said I would help you forge your bones and shape your spine. It was not empty talk," Madam Wen said. "Starting today, I will forge your bones and muscles for you, and erect the great mountain of your spine."

Half an hour later, everything was prepared.

A large vat stood in the inner courtyard, dark and profound, carved with patterns of herbs. Madam Wen said: "This is the Divine Farmer's Medicinal Vat, a rare treasure that enhances the potency of medicines."

On the table were arranged various medicines: Dragon Sinew, Dragon Bone, Pure Dew... many great medicines, unheard of and unseen.

Five Dragon Sinews, Five Dragon Bones, plus many herbs, beast blood, ginseng, strange plants... using Dragon Roar Charcoal, boiled over a high fire for an hour, one obtains a Nine-Nine Eighty-One Bone and Sinew Forging Soup.

Madam Wen said: "Apply the Dew Body Cream, then jump in."

Li Xian undressed completely and applied the Dew Body Cream. Entering the scalding medicinal soup, he initially felt scorching heat, but gradually it turned cool. The medicinal effects entered his body, and a dull pain throbbed between his bones and sinews.

Madam Wen said: "This is the Nine-Nine Eighty-One Bone and Sinew Forging Soup. One pot of this soup costs more than a thousand taels of silver. Remember, it will be charged to your account."

Li Xian felt he benefited immensely; silver is easy to earn, but the path to such opportunities is hard to find. He thanked Madam Wen.

Madam Wen smiled and said: "Do you know why I asked you to rest early last night?"

Li Xian said: "I do not."

Madam Wen walked around the medicinal vat, observing the heat, and said softly: "The Nine-Nine Eighty-One Bone and Sinew Forging Soup is meant to nourish and temper the bones and sinews, repair deficiencies, and restore the body to its proper state. People are born with deficiencies; cultivation is about striving forward, looking ahead. But few know that one should also look down, to repair deficiencies and losses."

"Advancement in martial realms does not make up for losses. It is like a disabled person; as they age, the disability does not improve. But their physique will still become stronger."

"Even if the body becomes stronger, covering up the deficiency, making it seem no different from a whole person, objectively speaking, the deficiency still exists. And it becomes harder to detect and harder to repair."

"For the mortal clay vessel, it is difficult to digest. Repairing losses and filling deficiencies, at your current stage, is just right. It is not good to be too early or too late, but you are still late; you started martial arts too late."

"This Bone and Sinew Forging Soup, taking the number nine-nine, is to complete the deficiency and achieve perfection. But the effect of one dose is ultimately limited. Therefore, you need to soak in it ninety-nine times."

"The money for this, you can calculate yourself."

Li Xian's expression changed; nearly ten thousand taels of silver, how could he repay it? He smiled wryly and said: "Madam, so much silver, I truly cannot repay it."

Madam Wen smiled lightly and said: "Since you cannot repay the silver, it is no matter. I have other ways for you to repay me slowly. You, just soak peacefully; you need not think of other things."

This continued for several days. The medicinal soup was changed dozens of times. Li Xian only felt he was being reborn, his bones becoming incredibly dense, and vitality bursting forth from his flesh and skin.

When the medicinal soup was changed, Li Xian's physique, flesh, skin, and bones felt as if they were being carefully carved. The "Perfect Physique" became even more profound, resembling a precious body.

Martial artists need nourishment, training, and soaking; none can be omitted. Li Xian had practiced martial arts for a year, and only today did he taste the sweetness of "soaking."

"Good, excellent!" Madam Wen gently caressed this body, indescribable joy in her heart, her beautiful eyes rippling. She only waited for his Yang essence to be full so they could enjoy copulation to their hearts' content.

"After returning from the Prefecture City, I will take him to the Southern Frontier once. I will plant a Heart Gu; I must ensure he can never part from me for eternity."

"I want both his true heart and his false intentions. He owes me, and will spend his life repaying it. Very good, very good."

Madam Wen's thoughts shifted suddenly, her eyes shimmering.

"Xiao Xian, you have already forged your bones and sinews forty-two times. From now on, while continuing to forge your bones and sinews, you can begin shaping your spine!" Madam Wen said.

"I will follow the Madam's instructions," Li Xian bowed and said.

Madam Wen said: "This method of shaping the spine is my great secret. You just need to enjoy the benefits, no need to ask questions. If you truly wish to know, when the time is ripe in the future, I will tell you."

Not long after.

Another large vat was erected in the inner courtyard. The vat was red-black, and its fragrance filled the air. The body of the vat was painted with patterns of mountains, flowers, grass, and beasts. Opening the lid made one's scalp tingle.

Inside were all rare poisons: snakes, centipedes, spiders, snow silkworms... densely packed, numbering in the thousands. Li Xian had hunted in the mountains and roamed the waters, encountering many poisonous snakes and insects. He could name hundreds of types of poisonous snakes and bugs and describe their characteristics. But the creatures in the vat had various shapes, and he could not name a single one.

They were all strange species.

Li Xian thought: "It is strange; snakes, bugs, and spiders should be fishy and foul. Why is it that here, they are so fragrant?" He observed curiously but could not see the reason.

Madam Wen had cultivated them for a long time; although they were highly toxic, they all emitted a清香 (light fragrance).

"Get in," Madam Wen said.

She saw Li Xian holding the edge of the vat, ready to jump in immediately. She was delighted again and pulled him back, saying: "I forgot, put this fragrant jade in your mouth before going in to sit. Otherwise, the many creatures in the vat, with just a small bite, could take your life."

Li Xian said: "Alright!" and put the fragrant jade in his mouth. His whole body cooled; the treasure took effect, and he was no longer afraid of poison. After sitting down, countless creatures swarmed to bite him, injecting toxins.

Thousands of strange poisons entered his body simultaneously. Any one of them could kill a person. But strangely, because of the mutual restraint and generation among the thousand poisons, their toxicity mixed and surprisingly became non-lethal.

These many creatures, carefully cultivated, possessed medicinal properties precisely within their poison. The toxins spread throughout his body, and the medicinal effects also spread throughout his body.

Next, it was necessary to remove the toxicity while retaining the medicinal properties.

Being bitten by ten thousand poisons was excruciating. Li Xian endured forcefully, his brow furrowed, cold sweat on his forehead, but he did not lose face. Madam Wen raised an eyebrow, thinking: "What a fine young man, to endure such pain." She admired him greatly.

The many toxins spread throughout his body, then gradually adhered to his spine, as if coated in a layer of black lacquer. His spine was eroded by poison, his whole body went numb and weak, yet the medicinal effect nourished him, and warmth spread through his body.

Destruction, recovery.

This repeated again and again...

Several more days passed.

Li Xian did not sleep or rest, unaware of the alternation of day and night, oblivious to the changing seasons. He did not even notice the gradual freezing of the weather.

Every day at the辰时 (Chen hour), he endured the biting of ten thousand poisons. Then, enduring the toxins, he used the "Nine-Nine Eighty-One Bone and Sinew Forging Method" to consolidate his bones and sinews. Late at night at the子时 (Zi hour, 11 PM - 1 AM), he used a special method to remove the toxins from his spine.

Then he continued forging his bones and sinews.

Forging bones and sinews, erecting the great mountain of the spine. These two advanced together. There was bitterness within joy, and endurance within pleasure. But the progress was gratifying; deficiencies were filled, losses were repaired, and his strength doubled. His Qi Lake surged, flowing into the Dan Tian, expanding by several more feet.

Several more days passed.

The eighty-one sessions of forging bones and sinews were all completed. The method of shaping the spine was nearing its end.

Madam Wen reminded: "This next step... is extremely painful. If you cannot bear it, end it immediately."

The method of shaping the spine must be accompanied by intense pain. At this stage, the spine shaping was already complete. Li Xian's spine was like a mountain, with an imposing aura. Madam Wen was already satisfied, but seeing that Li Xian still had strength left, she wanted to add one more level.

To try... whether it could truly be, a spine like a Divine Mountain, standing tall and upright, connecting heaven and earth!

If it could truly be so, such a man is rare!

Li Xian said: "Madam, please proceed!"

"Good, good," Madam Wen said, slightly excited. She applied the clan method to complete the final step.

The creatures in the poison vat were stranger, more toxic, and rarer. They destroyed bones and severed meridians, with unstoppable force. The "spine like a mountain" that Li Xian had erected was dug away by the toxins. The trees in the mountain were chopped down, the birds driven away, the beasts slaughtered—a scene of desolation.

Madam Wen frowned slightly. She had gone through this stage herself. She had also shaped a spine like a Divine Mountain, but her situation was different; she had cleverly passed it, but now there was no clever way to take.

She said: "At this step, you must use your will and spirit to force out the poison. Try to recall the situation when the Yellow Dragon Army pressed down, how you shot that arrow of will and spirit."

"If it does not work, then give up. Although you will be severely injured, after some rest, you can still recover."

Saying this, she felt disappointed. Her thoughts were complex; she would not allow Li Xian to surpass her. But she also hoped that Li Xian's potential was not inferior to her own.

Li Xian's spine hurt unbearably, but his will and spirit surged suddenly. He said: "Madam..."

"Are you giving up?" Madam Wen shook her head. But Li Xian said: "Madam, please bring me my bow and arrow."

"You..." Madam Wen was stunned. She brought her own bow. Li Xian nocked an arrow, his will and spirit soaring to the heavens. This arrow was like a rainbow, shooting towards the high sky.

The poison in his spine receded by half.

Madam Wen's gaze was strange. "Good arrow!" Li Xian's will and spirit were like a flood, his long hair flying. He endured the hardship, slowly piling up the Divine Mountain.

"This child... such sharp will and spirit," Madam Wen said with a strange light in her eyes. "Such heroic bearing, such will and spirit, future elegance. Good, excellent. I must get the Heart Gu quickly."

Early October.

Great success was achieved. Li Xian's body radiated five-colored auspicious light, his will and spirit soaring to the heavens, standing tall and upright. He had shaped his spine to be like a mountain, his physique perfect.

The red mole on his forehead glowed with a faint red light.

His sideburns fluttered lightly.

This imposing aura and appearance, looking throughout the Yu Nan Dao, is extremely rare.

Madam Wen had personally cultivated him, the joy within is even harder to describe. She walked over gracefully, pinched his flesh, hugged and embraced him, and asked: "How do you feel?"

"Very good," Li Xian said. "But I can't quite describe it."

"Feel it carefully," Madam Wen said softly. "I forged your bones and sinews, shaped your spine. It took me so much time. Rest for two hours. Then we will practice swordplay."

"Good," Li Xian pulled Madam Wen close, his actions intimate and natural. He thought to himself: "Has the Madam developed true feelings? I will never be blindly loyal, nor do I wish to be ungrateful. As for the future... forget it, I won't think about it for now."

That night...

The two of them practiced swords together, sword shadows flickering frequently. The first layer of swordplay: the Yang sword is fierce and swift, the Yin sword is soft and slow. The second layer: the Yang sword gradually slows and softens, while the Yin sword becomes insidious and dangerous.

When practicing the "Lip Spear and Tongue Sword" move, the two could actually converse with their swords. No need to speak, no need to transmit Qi. This sword move is incredibly mystical!

Day and night alternated. The sky gradually brightened.

Li Xian had shaped his spine to be like a mountain, supporting a series of strange connections. He was in the prime of youth, full of spirit and ambition. Although his swordplay was relatively weak, his elegance was already remarkable. Madam Wen had been famous for a long time, but when she was young, she had never seen such an elegant youth. Moreover, the silent influence of the "Immortal Couple Sword" truly touched her true feelings.

This feeling was no coincidence. She was skilled at calculation. Precisely because she was skilled at calculation, she controlled Li Xian everywhere, controlling his desires and thoughts. Making Li Xian pose no threat. In this situation, she believed everything was under her control, and naturally, she let her feelings and thoughts run wild.

Opening the floodgates, how could she control herself?

The next day, noon.

[Your two swords combined, proficiency of "Setting Sun and Fading Blood Sword" +398]

[Food Essence realm, proficiency +1]

Madam Wen had sweat on her forehead; her sword Dao had advanced. She sheathed her sword into her sleeve, her face slightly red, and said: "Tonight, you will assist me in my closed-door cultivation."
