# Chapter 9: Time to "Break Through"!

Chu Ning had this speculation in his mind, but his face showed no unusual expression. He silently watched as Cao Dongxin performed the Verdant Spring Technique on this section of spirit rice once more before moving on to areas he hadn't treated yesterday.

"Guard here and don't let birds or insects eat the spirit rice!" With these words, Cao Dongxin left again on his own.

After waiting a short while until Cao Dongxin was gone, Chu Ning's mind became active. He decided to test his earlier speculation first. He found a more distant field that Cao Dongxin hadn't treated with the Verdant Spring Technique. Sitting cross-legged nearby, he calmed his mind and began practicing the Evergreen Wood Technique.

The progress was normal, similar to yesterday afternoon, without the accelerated sensation he'd experienced yesterday morning. So Chu Ning moved to the last spot where Cao Dongxin had just performed the Verdant Spring Technique. Since it bordered an untreated area, any slight anomaly would at most make Cao Dongxin think he'd misremembered, just like today.

After some thought, Chu Ning didn't start practicing immediately. Instead, he performed the Verdant Spring Technique on the adjacent untreated field. Compared to yesterday, he felt noticeably more relaxed and skilled. This time, the technique covered ten stalks of red spirit rice, and he still had some energy left. So he performed it again, this time covering eight stalks with slightly diminished energy.

Sensing the spiritual energy fluctuations from these eighteen stalks of red spirit rice, Chu Ning stepped back and sat down to formally practice the Evergreen Wood Technique. As soon as he activated the technique, he immediately felt a completely different concentration and speed of spiritual energy. The natural spiritual energy of heaven and earth combined with that from the red spirit rice formed a purer, stronger energy that surged into his body. The cultivation speed of the Evergreen Wood Technique was now more than twice as fast as before!

"These red spirit rice stalks treated with the Verdant Spring Technique can indeed accelerate my cultivation speed!" Chu Ning rejoiced inwardly, then quickly calmed his mind to continue practicing.

After a little over an hour:

[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Grade Low Tier), First Layer (7/300)]

Last night after practice, the proficiency was 5; now it was 7—an increase of 2 points! Chu Ning quickly calculated in his mind. "If the first layer of the Evergreen Wood Technique corresponds to the early Qi Refining stage (levels 1-3), then reaching 100 should mean completing the first level of Qi Refining."

"Tomorrow, I'll be able to increase my proficiency to 10—just three days total! Doesn't that mean I could reach the peak of Qi Refining's first level, or even break through to the second level, in at most a month?" Chu Ning didn't know the cultivation speeds of outer and inner sect disciples, but he was certain that among the menial disciples, his progress was astonishing. After all, Cao Dongxin had spent decades here and was only at the peak of Qi Refining's fifth level, unable to break through to the sixth.

"I wonder if there's a bottleneck between the early and middle stages of Qi Refining." The thought made Chu Ning chuckle at himself. He'd only been cultivating for three days and was already thinking about future breakthroughs—he was getting ahead of himself! He needed to stay low-key and cautious.

Realizing this, Chu Ning grew more serious. His earlier thoughts had been too hasty. If he exploited Cao Dongxin's Verdant Spring Technique every day, given how the man treated him, he wouldn't feel guilty. But if he did it too often, Cao Dongxin would surely become suspicious. In fact, if tomorrow Cao Dongxin noticed that a previously treated area wasn't growing as well as others, he might start doubting.

Chu Ning glanced at the red spirit rice stalks. Yesterday, he'd left in a hurry and hadn't noticed, but now he could clearly see that the eighteen stalks he'd treated and the forty Cao Dongxin had treated had lost the spiritual aura they'd had after the technique was applied. However, they weren't any worse off than untreated stalks—just no additional benefits.

An idea struck Chu Ning. "If I perform the Verdant Spring Technique on these stalks again, wouldn't that prevent detection?" 

Acting on the thought, he—now fully replenished after cultivation and with improved proficiency in the Evergreen Wood Technique—performed the Verdant Spring Technique again. This time, he covered fourteen stalks. Another round covered fourteen more. With a bit of energy left, he managed six more in a third attempt. "That's thirty-four stalks total!" Satisfied, he nodded. He could handle the remaining six in the afternoon.

Though his dantian was now empty of spiritual energy, Chu Ning wasn't worried. He could recover it through meditation, or even naturally over time. 

At this point, he realized he might have found a cultivation shortcut. He could first perform the Verdant Spring Technique on the plants, then cultivate, and after improving, perform the technique again. This way, the plants would grow better, and his cultivation would accelerate. 

He wasn't sure if this effect applied to everyone or was unique to his special Yin Wood Spirit Body. However, he suspected it was the latter—if everyone could benefit this way, the method would already be widely known. 

Currently, his Verdant Spring Technique's coverage wasn't enough to fully support his cultivation. Naturally, he'd need to rely on Cao Dongxin for that. Given how the man treated him, Chu Ning felt no guilt about using him as labor. Still, he needed to confirm whether his actions would go unnoticed.

That afternoon, Chu Ning performed the technique on the remaining stalks. He also avoided cultivating near treated areas, waiting to see if Cao Dongxin would notice anything.

The next morning, Cao Dongxin arrived at the fields after breakfast as usual. His first action was to inspect the growth of the rice stalks he'd previously treated—even more carefully than the day before. Seemingly satisfied, he nodded. Chu Ning sighed in relief, glad he'd been cautious enough to reapply the technique to the depleted stalks. If he hadn't, Cao Dongxin might have grown suspicious again.

From this, Chu Ning confirmed that his cultivation method wouldn't be detected—at least not by Cao Dongxin. 

Over the next few days, Chu Ning repeated the process. Through practice, he gradually identified patterns. For instance, the best time to cultivate wasn't immediately after performing the technique, but about half an hour later. He also figured out the optimal range for borrowing spiritual energy from the rice stalks, allowing him to choose better cultivation spots.

Fourteen days after joining the Qingxi Sect, Chu Ning was returning from the fields when his neighbor, Qiu Shunyi, called out to him. 

Approaching, Chu Ning saw the man's delighted expression. "Chu Ning, tomorrow’s the day for the group lecture at the Technique Hall. How’s your progress with the Evergreen Wood Technique?"

Seeing Qiu Shunyi's expression, Chu Ning guessed he'd made some progress and smiled. "Shunyi, it seems you're close to mastering it?"

Qiu Shunyi grinned even wider but waved modestly. "Oh, 'mastering' is far off, but I’ve become quite skilled at sensing spiritual energy these past two days. I’m just a step away from Qi Refining entering the body—officially reaching the first level. I think I might achieve it tonight." He then asked, "What about you? When do you think you’ll reach Qi Refining entering the body?"

"I’m also just a step away—not sure when it’ll happen," Chu Ning replied, instinctively checking his proficiency:

[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Grade Low Tier), First Layer (61/300)]

At the same time, he pondered when would be the right time to "break through" Qi Refining entering the body. Previously, to avoid revealing his rapid progress, he'd been using his Yin Wood Spirit Body's innate ability to conceal his aura. But now, it seemed the time was right—it was time to "break through"!
