# Chapter 132

"I still need to cultivate diligently and strive to improve myself," Qin Ming murmured, looking in the direction where Li Qingyue had disappeared.

The Outer Lands were far vaster than he had imagined, encompassing realms such as Pure Land, Immortal Land, Yang Land, and Blighted Land. The contention over near-immortal items involved various Outer Lands orthodoxies, all belonging to the Pure Land lineage.

The departure of an old acquaintance left Qin Ming somewhat lost in thought.

At this moment, Qi Daoming stood motionless, just like him. However, their moods were completely different. City Lord Qi felt as if the sky was falling; several betting pools outside the arena were connected to him, and they had just crashed!

"Who placed such massive bets? Two formidable figures made their move at the last moment, betting on Qin Ming's victory. I had no idea anyone was playing for such high stakes," he muttered to himself.

Qi Daoming gritted his teeth. "Pay what? You all pack up the money and run! One of those 'evil dragons' must be Meng Xinghai. This time, let's just overturn the table and screw him over completely!"

A partner, face contorted in a grimace, said, "City Lord, where can we run to? That's a direct descendant of the Meng family, incredibly powerful. If he catches us, we'll..."

Qi Daoming whispered, "Go deep into the mountains shrouded in night mist first. Keep going until you reach the higher-level beings, and lay low there."

Then, he fell silent, because black mist billowed, and an old man with a childlike face and hair like a crane's appeared. Most crucially, he had *another* old man tucked under his armpit.

"Young man, are you trying to cheat me out of my day-gold?" Li Qingyun asked with an unfriendly expression.

Qi Daoming could barely believe his eyes. He didn't know who the questioning old man was, but he instantly recognized Fifth Master Cui of the Cui family – and he was being held like *that*? He was naturally gifted, valued by the Li family, and even became their son-in-law, so he naturally knew some of the direct descendants of rival aristocratic families. His scalp tingled instantly. Never mind the main person, even that Old Cui Five tucked under his armpit could pose a threat to him.

Qi Daoming didn't dare hesitate, immediately saying, "Senior, you jest. Not a single piece of the day-gold you won will be missing!"

Li Qingyun nodded. "Good, you're a sensible young man. Business requires integrity. Don't cause any trouble; it would interfere with me drinking with my old brother."

Fifth Master Cui's state of mind was about to collapse, just like Qi Daoming's betting pool. "Is this how one drinks?" he desperately wanted to spit, "Bah!"

The black mist swirled, and Li Qingyun, carrying Old Cui Five, vanished instantly.

In a tavern in Zhuguang City, Cui He and Cui Shuning looked grim. Someone from a reclusive family was actually backing Qin Ming; this was very bad. While they were indeed a thousand-year-old aristocratic family, they were unwilling to confront such a behemoth lurking in the mist. Reclusive families didn't have large populations, but they were all masters, making various factions quite wary. It was mainly because their true depths were incredibly hard to ascertain. When they were weak, they had almost no presence. When they were at their peak, they could devastate thousand-year-old aristocratic families. Unless absolutely necessary, no one wanted to openly clash with a reclusive family.

Qin Ming pondered. Just one Outer Lands Pure Land had so many formidable figures.

In an instant, many thoughts came to him. When the "produce" from the special node in Black-White Mountain matured, a young woman in green robes snatched the greatest fortune. From the "leftover scraps" she discarded, Qin Ming obtained a mysterious liquid that allowed him to resonate with items imbued with the crystallised efforts of predecessors. Clearly, that young woman in green was also an Outer Lands inhabitant.

"Could she be from the Outer Lands' Immortal Land? I don't think she's from the Yang Land."

Qin Ming knew her background must be extraordinary; her mount was actually a Golden Roc! Furthermore, her strength was quite extraordinary; she actually dared to snatch food from the tiger's mouth at Black-White Mountain, and succeeded. The seemingly ordinary "leftover scraps" Qin Ming obtained had caused abnormal changes in his spiritual perception. He wondered what benefits the dazzling "main ingredient" in the green-robed woman's hand had given her. Although he believed his "leftover scraps" might be a Heavenly Treasure that concealed its own brilliance, he couldn't deny the extraordinary nature of the "main ingredient" in the green-robed woman's hand, which might be priceless.

As he thought about these things, Qin Ming naturally recalled that a white-robed girl was also with the green-robed woman. Although the white-robed girl bore no ill will, she had once laughed at his simplicity, saying that when he stood atop the mountain peak, there might be a faint possibility he could gaze upon them from afar, pointing out the vast gap between them, as if separated by endless mountains and seas.

Qin Ming couldn't help but sigh; the Outer Lands were truly filled with talented individuals. And this was just what he had seen on the surface; this path was truly unfathomable. Most importantly, realms like Immortal Land, Yang Land, and Blighted Land had not yet clearly emerged.

"Everyone's left, and you're still spacing out?" Meng Xinghai walked over, chuckling. This time, he had made a huge profit.

"I hope Qingyue fares well. The competition on her side is very fierce," Qin Ming said.

"It's the same everywhere," Meng Xinghai replied.

Qin Ming nodded. "The Night Mist World is vast and boundless, filled with experts like trees in a forest. Some orthodoxies I know, having just barely surfaced, already feel unfathomably deep. And there are paths I haven't even touched upon yet, such as the Esoteric Sects and higher beings."

Under the night mist, Chixia City was in sight, and they soon returned.

In the City Lord's residence, Meng Xinghai was counting large sums of day-gold notes, a wide smile on his face. Qin Ming tilted his head, watching. Old Meng hadn't let him place bets, yet now he himself was radiating the aura of day-gold from head to toe.

"Uncle Meng, when's the next match?" Qin Ming asked, his eyes gleaming with eagerness. He planned to bring all his day-gold next time.

"Here, take a look at your haul this time," Meng Xinghai said, handing him a small, palm-sized pouch.

When Qin Ming opened it, a five-colored radiance immediately burst forth, dazzling him so much he could barely keep his eyes open. Inside were fruits the size of fingernails, some a vibrant, luscious green, some red like blood diamonds, and others pure white like jade. They were similar in size and shape, but differed in color.

These were the fallen fruits, small in size because it was early spring and they hadn't grown much yet.

Qin Ming said, "If fruits that fell prematurely are already like this, then the fully ripened five-colored fruits... are truly unimaginable."

Meng Xinghai chuckled and informed him, "The ripe fruits can be as big as a fist, and a tree full of them can illuminate heaven and earth with their five-colored divine radiance."

Qin Ming could only marvel; the fingernail-sized fallen fruits were simply incomparable.

Meng Xinghai said, "I haven't eaten them either. Those fruits are produced in small quantities and have incredibly potent medicinal effects, so they never circulate."

Qin Ming chuckled, "If I ever get the chance in the future, I'll present Uncle Meng with a few ripe five-colored fruits."

Meng Xinghai also smiled. "Then you'll have to work hard. If an Ancestor-level figure were to personally visit that place, the five-colored fruits would be served as ordinary fruit."

The fallen fruits contained rich Heavenly Light. Qin Ming planned to consume them after his seventh rebirth, which would perfectly augment the Heavenly Light within his body and help him integrate various combat techniques. However, it had only been a few days since his sixth rebirth on Mount Luofu, and even his physique, which surpassed that of an anomaly, was nearing its limit. Others, undergoing five rebirths a year, had already reached their peak; crossing the red line would cause severe bodily issues. Qin Ming felt that if he rested for more than half a month, he might be able to undergo another rebirth. Mainly, his foundation was too profound!

The local edition of the Night Report published the news of Qin Ming's victory over Chen Yuan, lavishing praise on his remarkable and extraordinary performance. As for the true main edition of the Night Report, the version distributed to many major cities, it didn't mention this duel at all. This was because Zhuguang City and Chixia City were relatively remote, their status not high enough, so no one really cared about a duel between two teenagers in such places. Of course, a few members of aristocratic families were exceptions; they knew Qin Ming's past, so they paid a little attention, but only regarded it as a topic of conversation after meals. After all, the fake Cui Chonghe had already faded out of their circle.

Undoubtedly, the duels between the "Number Ones" of various cities had a significant impact, and many people were currently paying close attention and discussing them heatedly. Therefore, the Night Report continued to follow up, often dedicating large sections of its main edition to coverage. The prodigies appearing in influential major cities became the hot topics they pursued, and new ones frequently "emerged," with some exceptionally talented youths gradually becoming well-known.

"Ling Yu of Liuguang City has astonished the four regions, truly living up to his reputation as having the demeanor of a young Grandmaster. He has already defeated several formidable figures who were currently in the limelight." Moreover, according to reports, Ling Yu was very humble, saying there were even more powerful individuals than him, like a blazing sun about to break through the black mist.

Qin Ming didn't stop either, and began racking up his own battle records, because the ancestral grounds of some major sects and special higher academies were already selecting top-tier prodigies. In the next two days, Qin Ming fought four consecutive matches, and each time he would bet on himself beforehand. However, Meng Xinghai's massive earnings in Zhuguang City, which nearly bankrupted Qi Daoming, had 'ruined' his reputation, and many people were now wary of those from Chixia City. Furthermore, they had already seen that Qin Ming's strength was indeed terrifying! So, betting on him to win offered extremely low odds, with almost no profit to be made.

By then, Qin Ming had achieved five consecutive victories in total, making him quite famous locally. However, he still couldn't make it onto the main edition of the Night Report, which was reserved exclusively for prodigies from major cities. During this period, a young anomaly appeared in Jinrui City, a piece of news that spread throughout the various cities under the night mist, with the Night Report continuously following up on it.

"Finally, an anomaly has appeared," Qin Ming murmured as he also read the Night Report.

Among the "Number Ones" from various regions, this was the first time an anomaly had appeared and been confirmed, causing a huge sensation. Although people believed that Ling Yu of Liuguang City, who had the demeanor of a young Grandmaster, was also an anomaly, he himself had never responded to such claims.

In the next two days, Qin Ming visited three more locations, bringing his winning streak to eight consecutive victories. After returning this time, he took a short rest and had a small gathering in Chixia City with Xu Sheng, Wu Zheng, and Sister Fenfang, Zhou Lin.

"Quick, look! A giant white peacock is descending from the sky!"

Xu Sheng, who used to be an itinerant merchant, had excellent eyesight. From his window seat, he was the first to spot a strange bird circling down from the clouds in the night sky. Immediately after, a five-colored spiritual bird also pierced through the clouds, descending towards the city. Then, a large green bird appeared, circling as it approached Chixia City. These were extraordinary flying mounts, and young faces could be seen on each of the strange birds.

People quickly realized that these individuals were not simple; they hailed from Shenzhao Academy, Five Elements Palace, and Wenxin Academy, respectively.

"Are you here in Chixia City to select disciples?" Yu Que flew over, showing no shyness, and enthusiastically greeted the group.

"We are passing through here for supplies. We're heading to a major city soon; we heard a young anomaly appeared there," someone replied. Clearly, the three factions, having met on their journey, were competing with each other, all eager to recruit that anomaly.

"We have a young expert here with an eight-match winning streak, don't miss out!" Yu Que informed them.

"Then let him register himself."

Yu Que asked, "Can he become one of your core disciples?"

"In this region, even a forty-eight-match winning streak isn't enough," came the reply.

Undoubtedly, all three factions appeared rather indifferent, not particularly concerned with battle records from remote areas. Soon after, they departed in a hurry.

A few days later, Qin Ming's battle record had reached fifteen consecutive victories. Finally, the main edition of the Night Report briefly mentioned him, though still without his name. The gist was that several youths with impressive battle records had appeared in remote cities like Chixia and Jinxi, with some already achieving winning streaks of over a dozen matches.

Meng Xinghai told Qin Ming, "Start preparing. I guess Cui He can't sit still anymore. They don't want you to enter a prestigious grand sect's ancestral ground, so they're probably looking for someone to challenge you." He smiled slightly. "Since they already know you're an anomaly, I'll provoke Cui He a bit. Tell them you want to enter the ancestral ground of the Six Imperial Lineage. Hmm, they'll probably be very worried you'll snatch Cui Chongxuan's core disciple spot."

Meng Xinghai felt it was time to make appropriate arrangements, thereby prompting Cui He to bring out the "Scripture of Verdant Wood."
