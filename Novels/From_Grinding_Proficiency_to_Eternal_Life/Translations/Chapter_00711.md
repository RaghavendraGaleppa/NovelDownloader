# Chapter 711: Gains and Losses

Xu Yunfan swept his sleeve, the purple-gold thunder patterns hidden within it faintly visible.

Purple-gold lightning flowed silently between the hall's pillars, like solidified liquid lightning, illuminating the main Divine Skies Hall with a brilliance as bright as day.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged atop the cloud platform at the heart of the hall. His aura was as deep and stable as an abyss, save for the ten-foot-long Star Spirit Banner in his hand, which trembled slightly, emitting a faint, almost inaudible hum.

The originally profound and vast star map on the banner was now covered in fine cracks. Especially at the center, where the molten golden sun formed by the Blazing Sun Dao Fruit intersected with the purple-gold thunder star formed by the Divine Skies Dao Fruit, spiderweb-like cracks were particularly glaring, even spreading onto the resilient banner pole.

Xu Yunfan's fingertips brushed over these cracks. Purple-gold Divine Skies magic power, like the finest silk threads, carefully infused the banner, attempting to mend the damage.

With each infusion of magic power, fine sparks of electricity would flash at the edges of the cracks with a faint "sizzling" sound, but the speed of the repair was exceptionally slow.

A faint frown creased his brow, and a barely perceptible pang of heartache flashed through his eyes.

"Forcefully reviving a spiritual treasure in a desperate place like the Samsara Sea of Bitterness, and then infusing it with the two supreme yang and rigid forces of Blazing Sun Burning Heaven Fire and Divine Skies Destruction Thunder through cross-realm power... it has ultimately damaged its foundation."

Xu Yunfan felt somewhat helpless.

The pure yang fire of the Blazing Sun Dao Fruit was wild and fierce, while the destruction thunder of the Divine Skies Dao Fruit was overbearing and violent. Although both belong to the yang attribute, their properties were not perfectly compatible. Their sudden collision and explosion within the confined space of the Star Spirit Banner produced a backlash force far exceeding expectations, almost tearing apart the core structure of this life-bound spiritual treasure.

He closed his eyes, his divine sense sinking deep into the Star Spirit Banner. The data stream of the attribute panel silently scrolled across his vision.

> [Star Banner · Life-bound Spiritual Treasure]
> Status: Moderately Damaged (Thunderfire Backlash)

The materials required for repair were all rare treasures. While the Primordial Qi of Metal and the Core of a Ten-Thousand-Year Lightning-Struck Wood could be sought through the foundations of the Primordial Origin Sect or his own accumulation, it would take considerable time.

His divine sense flowed, precisely extracting and magnifying fragments of memory from the depths of the Sea of Bitterness.

The bone island, the churning blood sea, the coiled skeletal dragon...

The final image fixed upon the Qiu Dragon's head, as large as a mountain.

At the end of the gnarled branches on its head, a fist-sized, strange fruit shaped like a coiled dragon hung suspended.

The cool light emanating from that Dao Fruit seemed capable of freezing the soul. Its core characteristics were instantly and clearly outlined in Xu Yunfan's perception and the deductions of his attribute panel.

This Dao Fruit was born from the Eye of Return at the depths of the Samsara Sea of Bitterness, condensed and refined over ten thousand years from the accumulated supreme yin death energy and the origin of the returning dead.

Its chilling aura was not the cold of ordinary ice and snow, but the ultimate coldness that pointed directly to the stillness of life and the return of all things to nothingness. It naturally formed a powerful suppression against all yang-attribute magic power and life force.

In the environment of the Sea of Bitterness, it was like a pin stabilizing the sea, capable of suppressing the wild blood waves and bone-corroding yin winds.

But supreme yin was not the end.

Deep within the core of this extreme cold that froze all things, Xu Yunfan clearly perceived a trace of extremely faint, yet incredibly tenacious, gentle life force.

Like a seed hidden beneath the frozen soil of winter, it contained the profound principle of "yin extreme gives birth to yang."

This trace of life force was for transformation and nurturing, capable of perfectly harmonizing wild and destructive energy to achieve a dynamic balance.

This was the very reason he viewed it as the final cornerstone for constructing his Minor Heavenly Cycle.

The thunder of the Divine Skies Dao Fruit destroys all methods, supreme yang and rigid, wild and peerless.

The light and flame of the Blazing Sun Dao Fruit burn the heavens and boil the seas, pure yang and tyrannical.

Both are extreme in yang, and a solitary yang does not grow; they urgently require the power of supreme yin to harmonize the dragon and tiger.

The supreme yin power of the Grand Yin Dark Qiu Dao Fruit was precisely like the most exquisite buffer and catalyst. With its characteristic of "yin extreme gives birth to yang," it would not only fail to weaken the might of the thunder and fire but would also harmonize the Divine Skies Thunder.

Using the gentle yin force to permeate the violent yang thunder would make it both rigid and gentle, containing a hint of generative intent within its destruction, making its power more internalized, condensed, and enduring.

Furthermore, it would catalyze the Blazing Sun True Fire. Under the suppression and stimulation of the supreme yin force, the pure yang fire, like hot iron thrown into ice water, would instead erupt with purer and more violent heat, and its fire nature would tend towards stability and controllability.

Thus, a Minor Heavenly Cycle would be formed.

The supreme yin gives birth to and nourishes the Divine Skies, the Divine Skies promotes the Blazing Sun, and after the Blazing Sun reaches a certain critical point, the principle of "yang extreme gives birth to yin" it contains can, in turn, nourish and balance the Grand Yin.

A ceaseless, mutually reinforcing Minor Heavenly Cycle energy loop was thus preliminarily constructed.

The early stage of the Golden Core realm focuses on stabilizing the Golden Core and comprehending the Dao principles.

The core symbol of advancing to the mid-stage is to transform the nascent form of the Golden Core's cave heaven within the Dantian from illusory to real, raising it to the realm of the high-hanging Great Void, allowing it to independently draw upon the chaotic power of the void to nourish oneself.

Three Dao Fruits with mutually generating attributes forming a stable Minor Heavenly Cycle would provide an incredibly vast and balanced origin power, serving as the fuel and framework for raising the cave heaven.

Once successful, Xu Yunfan would immediately cross the threshold, becoming a mid-stage Golden Core great cultivator on par with Universal True Lord and Pure Yang True Lord, truly establishing himself as a heavyweight figure within the Primordial Origin Sect and even the Taihua Spirit Void World.

"The Grand Yin Dark Qiu is truly worthy of its reputation."

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, a flash of purple-gold thunderlight disappearing from the depths of his pupils, tinged with a hint of heat.

Although this journey cost him the Wukong clone and damaged the Star Spirit Banner, being able to so clearly locate and perceive the characteristics of the Grand Yin Dao Fruit, confirming its perfect compatibility with his own path of cultivation... the price was worth it!

The Wukong clone self-destructed in the Sea of Bitterness. Although its true spirit was protected by the core of the Star Spirit Banner, it would require a long period of nurturing to be reassembled and restored.

For now, the situation in the Sea of Bitterness did not require urgent action. Xu Yunfan was confident that the White-Haired True Lord could not take down the Qiu Dragon, but Xu Yunfan needed another powerful helper.

His gaze fell deep into the Star Spirit Banner, where a true spirit, condensed like a tangible dark-gold sword light, was imprisoned.

It was the only remaining true spirit of his clone, Han Shi, after the self-detonation of the Cangming Dao Fruit.

Within it, the Ten Thousand Chariots' Anger-Killing Sword Intent, having been tempered by life and death, had become even purer and more桀骜 (unrestrained), filled with immense hatred and fury towards Xu Yunfan, the original body.

"Han Shi, it's time for you to 'see the light of day' again."

Xu Yunfan muttered to himself, sweeping his sleeve with a sudden force.

*Clatter!*

The rare spiritual materials accumulated over the years by Xu Yunfan, piled up at the side of the hall, flew up radiantly, suspending in mid-air. Three core items among them shone brilliantly.

**Ten-Thousand-Year Sword Marrow Jade.**
This jade was as white and lustrous as jade marrow in its entirety, yet it contained a peerless, sharp primordial sword qi. It was a supreme treasure for forging a cultivator's primordial sword foundation, a treasure every Foundation Establishment sword cultivator dreamed of.
This item would serve as the bones for the new body. It was obtained from the Pure Yang True Lord.

**Another item was the North Ocean Cold Iron.**
Taken from the ten-thousand-year-old profound iron of the extremely north's bitter cold lands, refined through countless eons by the Nine Nether cold煞 (evil spirits), its coldness was latent and its hardness indestructible. It could also temper the sword intent, making it purer and more condensed, removing impurities.
This could be turned into the flesh, tendons, and meridians of the new body.
