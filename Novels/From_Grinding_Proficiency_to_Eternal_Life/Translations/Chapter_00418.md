# Chapter 418: Suspended Mountain

Xu Yunfan's vision suddenly opened up before him.

Before him hung a towering, dark-green mountain upside down above a sea of clouds. Its surface was covered in naturally formed silver patterns, resembling talismans carved by the heavens themselves.

Seven frozen waterfalls cascaded from the mountain's peak, only to be shredded into misty spiritual energy by the violent winds in mid-air, enveloping the entire mountain in a halo of rainbow light.

At the mountain's waist, a winding staircase of white marble, like a coiling snake, led toward a long-collapsed complex of palaces and pavilions.

Gilded dragon patterns could still be seen on the broken beams and pillars, and half a stone stele jutted out from the scorched earth, the characters "Great Void" barely discernible.

What truly shook Xu Yunfan to his core were the three boundless auras at the mountain's base, like celestial abysses descending from the heavens, enveloping the entire Suspended Mountain in an invisible pressure.

The first aura was like the rising sun—majestic and blazing, illuminating the clouds for ten thousand miles.

Within its scorching light, nine golden suns seemed to rise and fall, each containing the terrifying power to incinerate mountains and boil seas. Wherever its light passed, the void twisted, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was burned into crimson streams of fire.

Just the aura that had leaked out had already melted winding lava gullies into the mountain rock, as if an ancient golden crow had swept across the mortal world.

The second aura was like an ancient Buddha plucking a flower—seemingly gentle yet weighing ten thousand jun (a unit of weight). Countless golden Sanskrit characters manifested and vanished within the void. Each character that fell would carve a "卍" character imprint a hundred zhang deep into the sky.

Even more terrifying were the floating shadows of Brahmin flowers. When their seemingly delicate petals fell, they crushed the entire cliff below into rubble, revealing the rock core inside, which had been soaked in Buddhist light and transformed into a琉璃-like state.

The most astonishing was the third, ethereal pure qi. It seemed thin and misty, yet contained infinite mysteries.

As it flowed, it manifested the shadows of thousands of immortal palaces. In each palace sat a Daoist clad in starry robes and feathered garments, some playing the zither, some playing Go, some observing the stars, and some refining pills.

Wherever this pure qi passed, the rocks would spontaneously reorganize into exquisite jade platforms, withered wood would miraculously turn into碧玉 jade branches, and even the howling violent winds would condense into melodious immortal music.

Even more wondrous were the white crane shadows that occasionally flew through the pure qi. Each time they flapped their wings, they left behind profound Dao patterns in the void, organizing the chaotic spiritual energy around them into orderly lines.

At the intersection of the three auras, the space continuously evolved and reorganized, sometimes turning into a furnace with flames burning the sky, sometimes becoming a pure land filled with Buddhist chanting, and at other times evolving into an immortal paradise dotted with stars like a chessboard.

The three forces were clashing, at odds with each other, yet mutually wary. They had not yet made a move, forming a strange equilibrium.

"Golden Core!"

Xu Yunfan's mind trembled violently, his pupils shrinking to pinpricks.

"Golden Core True Lord!!"

He nearly held his breath. The True Martial Heavenly Gang and Subduing Demonic Earthly Evil within his body circulated on their own at this moment, just barely allowing his stagnant blood and energy to slowly regain flow.

The power of a Golden Core True Lord in this world had far exceeded the boundaries of his understanding. It was a realm beyond human reach, a manifestation of the Heavenly Dao itself!

The Nine Golden Suns of the Pure Yang True Lord that could burn the sky and boil the sea, the Brahmin Flower Shadows of the Wonderful Virtue Bodhisattva that could suppress all laws, the Immortal Palace Pure Qi of the Qingyuan True Lord that could evolve the entire cosmos...

At the clash of the three auras, the spiritual energy was in chaos, water and fire collapsed, and the power to split heaven and earth ran rampant. It was simply inconceivable.

How could this be so different from the descriptions of Golden Core cultivators in the novels of his previous life?

The Golden Core in this world was already comparable to the True Immortals described in the web novels of his past life. In some lower-level web novels, this would be the cultivation of a Heavenly Immortal.

Just as Xu Yunfan was calming his complex emotions, a voice sounded in his spiritual sense.

"The Blessed Land of Suspended Mountain..."

It was the voice of Chu Chengnan. "The Great Void Sword Sect failed in their collective ascension back then, and their mountain gate fell into the void. Now that it has appeared, it has landed right on the border of the three factions. The True Lords of our Primordial Sect, the Bodhi Pure Land, and the Myriad Chariot Sword Sect are fighting for the mountain seal that controls the Suspended Mountain."

He paused. "You saw the three auras, right? The Pure Yang True Lord of the Myriad Chariot Sword Sect, the Wonderful Virtue Bodhisattva of the Bodhi Pure Land, and our Sage Sect's Qingyuan True Lord have each left their mark. Now, Golden Core True Lords find it difficult to make a move, and Foundation Establishment True Masters cannot enter. Only Qi Condensation disciples can be sent in to retrieve the mountain seal. If you can obtain it, it will be a great contribution."

As soon as he finished speaking, the clouds suddenly shattered. Three colossal phantoms, which reached to the sky and the earth, stood tall in the void like pillars supporting the heavens.

To the east, a figure bore a gilded sword case on its back, with nine golden suns revolving around it. Its scorching light evaporated the sea of clouds for a hundred miles. It was none other than the Pure Yang True Lord of the Myriad Chariot Sword Sect.

His phantom was so tall it seemed to support the sky. Each rotation of the golden suns burned twisted coronal patterns into the void, as if nine miniature suns were guarding this sword Dao sovereign.

To the west, a Bhikkhuni stood atop a thousand-petaled lotus platform. Seven layers of Buddhist light behind her head solidified into a corporeal golden body phantom.

The phantom stood over a thousand zhang tall. In its palm, it held a Seven-Treasure Glazed Pagoda from which hung countless strings of prayer beads. Each bead reflected the three thousand Brahmin worlds. It was undoubtedly the Wonderful Virtue Bodhisattva of the Bodhi Pure Land.

And in the northern sky, the phantom of the Qingyuan True Lord was the most mystical.

His form was half-real, half-illusion. The pure qi around him transformed into thousands of ethereal immortal palaces, with wind chimes made of stars hanging from the eaves of each palace.

In his hand, he held a Mountain and River Cauldron. The Earthly Evil Pure Qi that gushed from it caused even the collapsed cliffs to rise and return to their original positions, displaying the unpredictable power to invert the universe.

The mere presence of the three phantoms made the entire Suspended Mountain groan under the spiritual pressure, unable to bear the strain. The residual patterns of the mountain protection array, which had survived since ancient times, were now crumbling and vanishing at a visible speed.

Seeing that the residual patterns of the Suspended Mountain's protective array had been completely nullified by the auras of the three True Lords, the Hundred Peaks True Master whispered, "Go in. Do as you see fit. Just retrieve the mountain seal."

Xu Yunfan understood. He immediately stepped into the air, his form turning into a green rainbow that shot straight toward the Suspended Mountain.

As he flew across the void, his eyes flickered. He saw dozens of black streaks of light shooting through the sky like meteors from the sea of clouds beneath the Qingyuan True Lord's phantom.

Disciples of the Primordial Sect.

It seemed the Primordial Sect wasn't putting all its eggs in one basket, or perhaps he, Xu Yunfan, only represented the faction of the Hundred Peaks True Master.

Although those Primordial Sect Qi Condensation disciples had not yet reached Foundation Establishment, each of them had a solid aura like mercury, with various colored auras swirling around them. There was a gloomy youth驾驭 a white bone flying boat, an enchanting woman standing on a blood lotus, and even seven black-robed cultivators traveling in formation, their combined aura forming a ferocious demonic phantom in the void.

"Blood Fiend Peak, Hundred Desires Peak, Seven Killings Peak..."

Chu Chengnan's spiritual sense transmitted a cold laugh. "It seems each branch has sent out their most treasured Qi Condensation talents."

Before his voice faded, a piercing golden light suddenly erupted from the west. Eighteen barefoot monks on golden lotus platforms tore through the air and arrived.

The skull prayer beads around their necks clattered with each step, and with every step, they left a "卍" character Buddhist seal on the sea of clouds.

They were the "Angry-Eyed Vajras," the extremely famous subordinates of the Wonderful Virtue Bodhisattva in the Bodhi Pure Land.

"Those bald donkeys are so impatient. You can never go anywhere without them."

A sharp aura suddenly pierced Xu Yunfan's glabella, causing his vertical eye there to slightly open and close.
