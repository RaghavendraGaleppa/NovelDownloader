# Chapter 373: The Demon Approaches, I Shall Borrow Your Qi

“Crack!”

The three thousand six hundred blood threads snapped simultaneously, crushed by an invisible giant vise.

The old woman’s right arm, still gripping the sword, twisted grotesquely. Blisters of blood bulged beneath her skin as the uncontrolled Ten Thousand Calamities Sword Qi devoured her from within.

Xu Yunfan raised his left hand, two fingers together like a sword, and pointed lightly from a distance.

“Pfft!”

A bloody hole exploded in the center of the old woman’s forehead. However, no blood sprayed out; instead, the Blood River True Qi she had painstakingly cultivated for a lifetime surged out like a breached dam. It transformed into a torrent of crimson-gold light and poured into Xu Yunfan’s palm.

Her withered body fell like a rag doll. Before it even hit the ground, her skin visibly withered and turned ashen. Finally, she landed on the blue stone steps with a dull thud, reduced to a skeleton wrapped in a sword robe.

Silence fell over the mountain gate, heavy as a tomb.

The white-browed old man’s hand trembled as he held his sword. The寒魄 (Cold Soul) Sword Intent, having lost control due to his shock, caused the frost on the scabbard to crumble away with a rustling sound.

The Sword Pavilion disciples watching from afar fared even worse; some collapsed to their knees, soiling their pants with foul-smelling fluids.

Xu Yunfan lowered his gaze to his palm, where a wisp of crimson-gold sword qi flowed between his fingers. “The sword intent is acceptable, but the people are lacking,” he remarked, his tone as flat as if critiquing a dish that didn't suit his taste.

Ten Thousand Calamities Sword Qi—though it sounded impressive, with the Dust of Annihilation Heart Sutra, the Hundred Meridians Ghostly Art, and the perspective gained from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect’s Ten Thousand Chariots Transforming Sword Way, this sword qi was merely “acceptable.” It was enough to stand above the rest in the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining, but in the Land Immortal realm, it was insignificant.

“Second Sister!”

The white-browed sword elder’s eyes split wide with rage, and the ancient sword finally left its sheath.

Before the sword light arrived, the ten miles of sea of clouds froze into a curtain of ice. A hundred-zhang-long ice dragon roared out from the sword’s edge, its dragon head biting down a Cold Soul Sword Intent capable of freezing one’s blood.

Simultaneously, the Sword Sage slammed his iron staff into the ground. The seven Sword Purity crystals, which had reawakened due to the return of spiritual energy, exploded, transforming into seven rivers of sword qi like galaxies, converging from all directions to kill.

This was the killing move of the *Empty冥 Sword Canon*—“Seven Stars Falling on the World.” Each strand of sword qi contained the power of the earth’s metal veins; even a Ninth Realm Body Cultivator would have their flesh and bones stripped away.

Xu Yunfan finally moved.

He stomped his left foot forward, and the entire mountain peak trembled violently. A piercing golden light erupted from his spine, like a great dragon raising its head. The Ten Extreme True Qi, rising step by step, condensed outside his body into nine crimson pythons.

The pythons’ scales and claws flew wildly, each scale flowing with magma-like, scorching true patterns. As they coiled, they burned the air within a ten-zhang radius into distorted waves.

This was the Crimson Python Coiling Mountain Strength from the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method, evolved using his Ten Extreme True Qi. Standing on a high vantage point and condensing such vast true qi naturally allowed him to manifest nine true qi pythons.

The white-browed old man’s eyes twitched violently.

“True Qi Manifestation?!”

Moreover, the terrifyingly vast true qi made him feel like a lone leaf boat facing the stormy waves of a raging sea.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained calm. He pushed his right palm forward, and the nine crimson pythons twisted together into a torrent of crimson-gold.

Wherever his palm edge passed, the blue stones on the ground silently vanished, and even space seemed to depress, causing a slight distortion in vision.

The protective sword qi of the two remaining elders tore apart like thin paper. The Cold Soul Ice Dragon of the white-browed sword elder vaporized into mist the moment it touched the pythons, and the Seven Stars Sword Qi of the staff-wielding Sword Sage emitted a wail of shattering metal within the torrent.

The aftermath of the palm force swept over the mountain gate. The entire Sword Pavilion archway cracked with a “crack,” leaving a scorched-black palm mark spanning a hundred zhang. The edges of the mark slowly flowed with molten gold liquid.

The moment the ice dragon collided with the pythons, it shattered like glass. The Cold Soul Sword Purity was swallowed by a python, and the seven rivers of starlight sword qi disintegrated upon touching the black robe, transforming into pure golden energy that poured into Xu Yunfan’s dantian.

“The sword is also lacking, and the people are even more so,” Xu Yunfan点评道 (commented), his words piercing their hearts. At the same time, his right hand formed a sword shape with two fingers and lightly划 (slashed) through the void.

“Rip!”

The white-browed sword elder’s right arm, still holding the sword, was severed at the shoulder. There was no blood at the wound, only a golden scar burned by the Ten Extreme True Qi.

The two remaining elders finally realized the gap in power.

The Sword Sage said coldly, “Form the Two Elements Sword Formation!”

He sighed inwardly. If Elder He Yi hadn’t died, they could have used the Three Talents Sword Formation, intertwining their three sword intents to resist Xu Yunfan.

The white-browed old man frowned deeply, knowing it would be hard to end this peacefully today. Xu Yunfan had already achieved the Land Immortal realm. Since their several major sects had chosen the wrong side, they naturally had to face retribution.

“Xu Yunfan, what will it take for you to let this go?” the white-browed old man asked solemnly.

Hearing this, the Sword Sage’s usually indifferent expression showed a hint of surprise for the first time. “Senior Brother, you…”

“We have people behind us…”

The Sword Sage scanned the disciples behind him, his open mouth trembling a few times before closing, remaining silent.

Xu Yunfan said calmly, “A cause sown yesterday, a reaped today. Now that I have entered the Land Immortal realm, I naturally must come to the Sword Pavilion to claim some things.”

As Xu Yunfan’s words fell, a dead silence enveloped the Sword Pavilion’s mountain gate.

The disciples standing guard with swords had their pupils contract, their hands trembling uncontrollably as they gripped their swords.

Although they had just witnessed Xu Yunfan killing Ninth Realm experts like chickens, pressing the entire Sword Pavilion alone, and even suppressing the extremely fierce He Yi Lin with a backhand move, absorbing her thick true qi completely, the moment the words “Land Immortal realm” were spoken from his own mouth, the invisible pressure still crushed everyone’s hope like the sky falling.

“Land… Immortal?” a young disciple muttered, his voice dry as if sanded.

His sword clattered to the ground, but no one mocked him, for the faces of the surrounding fellow disciples were equally pale as paper.

The elders on the pavilions were even more ashen-faced.

When Sword Master Tian Xuan had ambushed Xu Yunfan yesterday, they had still thought this man was merely a somewhat strong peak Ninth Realm expert. Even if he could win, he would have to pay a price.

But now…

“No wonder… no wonder he wasn’t afraid to face the three Supreme Elders of our Sword Pavilion…” a white-bearded elder’s Adam’s apple bobbed, his back soaked in cold sweat.

He had cultivated the martial path for nearly a hundred years and prided himself on seeing the heroes of the world, but at this moment, he didn’t even have the courage to look Xu Yunfan in the eye. Those eyes, flowing with a golden luster, had transcended the realm of mortals!

The mountain wind swept past, carrying the lingering scent of blood.

The white-browed elder asked, “What do you want?”

Xu Yunfan acted as if he didn’t notice the shock of the crowd. He simply looked up towards the depths of the Sword Pavilion and said calmly, “Nothing else. Since the demons are approaching, I must stand for all living beings and borrow your true qi…”

These words were like a death knell, crashing heavily in the heart of every Sword Pavilion disciple.

“Borrow true qi”—He Yi Lin was still a dried corpse before their very eyes.

“High-sounding words!” the white-browed elder sneered, no longer harboring any illusions. He moved his fingers slightly, and the Sword Sage understood, stepping forward.

The two stood back to back, using their essence blood as a catalyst. Ancient array patterns suddenly lit up beneath the mountain gate of the Sword Pavilion.

Xu Yunfan looked somewhat surprised. “It seems the Sword Pavilion does have some heritage, managing to revive a formation from thousands of years ago.”

The spiritual energy in this world was extremely thin; activating an original ancient array was quite a drain on resources.
