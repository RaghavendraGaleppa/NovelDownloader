## Chapter 12: The Mysterious M.D.

As Li Zhiming opened his eyes, he sprang up from the bed, only to find that his friend, Daniu, was still fast asleep, drooling on his chin. Li Zhiming playfully pinched Daniu's waist, causing him to wake up with a start.

"What's going on?" Daniu rubbed his eyes, and his massive body sat up on the bed.

Hearing the commotion outside, Han Li, who was trying to blend into the crowd, quietly got dressed and followed Li Zhiming out of the room. They merged into the crowd, trying not to draw attention to themselves.

Outside, a tall and slender young man stood with his hands behind his back, surveying the disheveled group of children. Li Zhiming spotted Han Li and stuck close to him, just like a hermit crab searching for shells.

The group consisted of over 150 children, more than they had seen before. These children were a mix of those dressed in fine clothes and those in simple, rustic attire. Li Zhiming noticed that Li Zhi, who was usually distant, stood behind the well-dressed children.

The tall young man shouted, "Stop moving!" and began to inspect each child, one by one, seemingly searching for something. When it was Li Zhiming's turn, he felt the young man's cold, hard hands probing his bones, causing him to wince in pain.

Daniu was caught and began to cry, but after being slapped, he became quiet.

As the inspection continued, the number of children dwindled, and only 20 remained. Han Li was still among them, along with Li Zhiming and other children who seemed similar, slightly scrawny and weak.

The remaining children were led to a bamboo forest, where the so-called Qixuanmen assessment was said to begin. The steep bamboo forest loomed before them, its leaves sharp as knives, just as the other children had described.

The tall young man did not announce their fate immediately. Instead, he waited, and after a while, several people arrived, dressed in fine attire, and conversed with him. Then, he asked, "Who among you can read?"

The children looked at each other, and most of them shook their heads, as they were mostly from peasant families and did not know how to read. A small, clean-looking child stepped forward, "I... I know a little."

The young man nodded and had the child taken away. He asked several more questions, seeking children with specific skills, and eventually, five children were led away. Only 15 children remained.

The young man asked one final question, "Who among you knows something about medicinal herbs?" 

Li Zhiming glanced at Han Li, who remained silent. Li Zhiming decided to take a chance and stepped forward, "I do!"

Han Li, not wanting to be left behind, also stepped forward, "I do too!"

The young man nodded and led them away, saying, "You will follow M.D. , and the rest of you will take the assessment later. Those who fail will be sent to the foot of the mountain to practice farming."

As they walked, Li Zhiming and Han Li followed closely behind, passing by the bamboo forest and entering a winding path. After a while, they arrived at a valley, where a middle-aged man with silver hair and an air of elegance stood.

The young man turned to Li Zhiming and Han Li, "You two are lucky to follow M.D. . You must serve him well, just like you would your parents."

Li Zhiming and Han Li nodded eagerly, and the young man left. They followed M.D. , a man with a gaunt face and sunken skin, into the valley.

The valley was filled with medicinal fields, and a well-maintained house stood in the center. M.D. sat on a chair, sipping tea, as Li Zhiming and Han Li approached.

M.D. examined them and ordered Li Zhiming to put down the small animal he was holding. He then brought out an old table with various dried herbs.

"Listen carefully," M.D. said. "I will name a herb, and you tell me its properties."

The test began, and Li Zhiming identified the first herb, Danggui, correctly. M.D. nodded, and Li Zhiming continued to answer his questions, identifying a second herb, Houpo.

As the test progressed, Li Zhiming felt the questions becoming increasingly difficult. He glanced at Han Li, who seemed uncertain, and hoped he could keep up.
