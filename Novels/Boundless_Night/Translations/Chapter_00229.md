# Chapter 229: Returning as an Outer Saint

Under the black mist, the old man's body lay split in two, bleeding profusely. His spiritual consciousness was also cleaved into two fragments, which then burst into flames.

"Young man, I was wrong! Quickly, put it out!"

The old man's spiritual consciousness writhed and howled. He regretted it; having escaped the vengeful spirits, why had he involved himself in this?

His mind trembled. What formidable Heavenly Radiance energy was this? How could it be even more potent than the legendary Tathagata Force and Heaven-Supporting Force, burning like the great sun?

He couldn't extinguish it on his own.

"Mercy! I'll pay any price!" High-realm cultivators weren't necessarily tough; the old man cowered completely.

If he had a body, he would have surely knelt. He howled miserably, his remaining spiritual consciousness struggling to escape.

Qin Ming punched out, like a great sun appearing in the sky, and the old man's wails abruptly ceased.

"Only a few units of Day Gold," Qin Ming said, disappointed, then turned and left.

In a place like this, he didn't need to handle the aftermath; ghosts would spontaneously come to "serve," enthusiastically and thoroughly.

Qin Ming carried the ghost and took a detour, successfully exiting the Yin Earth.

"Brother Ming, are you alright?" Little Wu was startled, seeing Qin Ming return in ragged clothes, covered in blood, looking so disheveled.

"I'm fine, I wasn't injured." After washing up and changing into clean clothes, Qin Ming recounted his experiences from the journey.

Little Wu listened attentively, feeling indignant throughout. The old geezer from the Great Yu Dynasty was utterly shameless, but thankfully, he "cooled off" quickly.

At the same time, he became intrigued. High risk also meant high reward. He and Brother Ming couldn't even afford tuition at the Mountain River Academy recently, but now Brother Ming had acquired thousands of units of Day Gold?

His tone firm, he said, "Brother Ming, I want to go temper myself too."

"The Yin Earth is reviving, and ghosts are rampant, but some people are more dangerous than vengeful spirits," Qin Ming warned seriously, though he didn't forcefully stop him.

Because Little Wu had broken through to the Second Realm instantly last time, it was as if he had deliberately revealed his true nature, confirming he had something unusual and trump cards.

In the following days, Little Wu left early and returned late, joining some prominent organizations.

Finally, he was quite pleased, having earned several sums of Day Gold.

"Brother Ming, your method is good," Little Wu said. During the two most critical moments, he was covered in sweat, carrying a ghost while stealthily moving.

Of course, when recalling the events, he was quite angry.

During this time, some people tried to double-cross him, and some organizations wanted to secretly exhaust him and reclaim the Day Gold. In just a few days, he witnessed the wickedness of human hearts, which was often more harmful than ghosts.

These past few days, Qin Ming learned that the people from the Great Yu Dynasty had succeeded. The outside world was spreading rumors that they had brought out an extraordinary exotic treasure and a rare medicinal herb.

A group of old ghosts even broke their vows for this, bursting out of the Yin Earth, leading to exceptionally fierce battles.

However, that group of ghosts had only recently revived and couldn't venture far from areas dense with Yin energy. In the end, they were severely defeated and even pierced through.

For the next few days, Qin Ming and Little Wu rested, no longer exploring the Kunling territory.

During this period, Qin Ming didn't deliberately cultivate intensely or try to break through. He was waiting to naturally step into the Outer Saint realm.

The two were quite relaxed, exploring all over Qionghua City, even having the leisure to enjoy the night scenery in the evenings.

The Qionghua River flowed through the city.

In the evening, various pleasure boats dotted the wide river, brightly lit. After their intense explorations and life-and-death battles, the two also experienced this slow-paced nightlife.

Little Wu stood on a large boat, facing the night breeze, holding a wine cup. He said, "Who would have thought that while we were venturing into dangerous, mist-shrouded lands, fighting bloody battles, this Qionghua River would be filled with pleasure boats, fragrant wine, melodious zither music, and captivating courtesans and dancers? How colorful and vibrant!"

He was somewhat reluctant to leave, feeling that this was the comfortable life they deserved.

Watching the singing and dancing, he added, "It's a pity, Brother Ming, that our outing is still missing something. If we had two fairy maidens with us, wouldn't a night excursion with candles be splendid?"

Qin Ming ignored him, gazing into the distance, towards the direction of the Great Yu Imperial Capital.

Someone from the Cui family said his grandfather had gone to the Great Yu Capital, and he suspected it was a lie. Yet, he couldn't help but gaze in that direction; he missed his grandfather.

Back then, grandfather and grandson had depended on each other, living a life of wandering poverty. More than a decade had passed; was his grandfather still alive in this world?

Now he had the ability and hoped to take care of his grandfather, but he couldn't find the old man.

His experiences in the Cui family were like a dream. He was treated as an outcast, forbidden to step into that circle again, and repeatedly targeted.

For some reason, Qin Ming felt a pang of sadness. He had never seen his parents since birth, his dearest grandfather had left him in his early childhood, and he had lived someone else's life for over a decade, only to end up with nothing.

From childhood to adulthood, he had many friends, but once his identity became clear, and he was no longer a legitimate son of the Cui family, few of his old friends remained.

"Brother Ming, I'm talking to you. Why are you spacing out?" Little Wu called out to him.

"Hmm, I was thinking about some people and events from the past," Qin Ming nodded.

Little Wu said, "Brother Ming, don't keep anything bottled up inside. We're brothers. You know my past, so tell me about your unpleasant experiences."

Qin Ming chuckled wryly. His brief immersion in the past had made his heavy heart apparent to his brother beside him.

He exhaled a turbid breath, having already cut off those unpleasant thoughts, but still briefly recounted his past experiences to Little Wu.

"Damn, Brother Ming, you're pretty tragic too, to have such a life. But I guess we're birds of a feather. I only have a grandmother left, and whether she's still alive is debatable; she's probably just a wisp of residual consciousness, unable to let go of me."

This time, it was Little Wu's turn to sigh. His earlier romantic notions had completely vanished. The Fourth Desolate Land had been breached, and none of his clan members remained; only he was left.

If he wanted revenge, the difficulty would be akin to ascending to heaven.

Little Wu spoke, "After hearing about your past, Brother Ming, I feel that the Cui family missed out on you and moved to oppose you. If they knew about your current achievements, they might try to destroy you. And the Li family will also eliminate you. Brother Ming, your situation is indeed not good, no wonder your cultivation speed is so fast, yet you still feel it's not enough."

"As for myself, everything's fine, I've gotten used to it. My only worry is my grandfather." Qin Ming felt he wasn't strong enough because he couldn't simply walk up to the Cui family's door and ask for clarity.

On the shimmering river, pleasure boats glided slowly, zither music was pleasant to the ear, singing voices were moving, and much laughter accompanied them, yet the two young men were both lost in thought.

Suddenly, Qin Ming emitted dazzling light, accompanied by a shower of golden radiance. His flesh seemed to burn, as if he was about to ascend amidst resplendent clouds.

He had, astonishingly, naturally broken through to the Outer Saint realm in this very situation.

Qin Ming controlled himself, no longer letting golden mist erupt. He immediately spent a considerable sum to rent a quiet room on the pleasure boat, where he entered seclusion on the spot to comprehend his changes.

Little Wu personally guarded him, standing watch solemnly.

Aside from the somewhat large commotion and overly dazzling light, Qin Ming's breakthrough had no other disturbances; everything happened naturally.

Fortunately, cultivators were numerous in the Night Mist World, and the quiet rooms on pleasure boats were specifically prepared for seclusion, with copper walls providing excellent isolation.

At this moment, Qin Ming was practically like a true sun. The Heavenly Radiance energy burned, completely engulfing him, giving him a resemblance to the patriarch who soared across the sky like a great sun.

Undoubtedly, his strength was soaring. With the breakthrough to a major realm, his physical constitution and Heavenly Radiance energy underwent a complete transformation, and his combat power significantly elevated!

This was no less than a comprehensive Nirvana!

Bathed in light, Qin Ming genuinely felt the changes within himself. His instincts and intuition became even sharper, his physical body exceptionally tough, and his Heavenly Radiance like a sharpened divine blade.

At this moment, he felt he had grasped his own destiny.

Only by continually strengthening himself and rapidly improving could he have this feeling.

In the past, there were many enemies he had to bypass, actively avoiding them. But now, Qin Ming was certain that if he encountered some of those people head-on again, he could deal with them.

Just like Li Qingxu, if the other party hadn't had a new breakthrough recently, even if Qin Ming had just become an Outer Saint, he would no longer fear him!

Around Qin Ming's body, golden threads interwove, and jade light emerged. He seemed to be clad in a mysterious armor, which was a manifestation of certain characteristics of the Silk Scroll Sutra's true meaning.

He was dumbfounded. He had always said he mastered eight wondrous arts in the First Realm. How could he have forgotten this main sutra? He had missed one.

If he added it, that would be nine true sutras.

In fact, the Silk Scroll Sutra's true meaning far surpassed wondrous arts, secret manuals, and the like!

When Qin Ming advanced to the Outer Saint realm, mysterious symbols appeared on his golden-threaded jade robe. Although somewhat blurry, they were indeed gradually materializing.

This was the materialization of the Silk Scroll's true meaning!

Beyond it, the Five Elements Light Wheel rotated, accompanied by the illumination of three-colored divine radiance. There was the Fire Shuttle floating, the Wu Ji Seal manifesting, the Golden Cicada dormant, the Dragon Snake Scissors suspended... these were the eight wondrous arts resonating and guarding his path.

Further out, divine rings formed from other Heavenly Radiance energies Qin Ming had mastered layered densely, protecting him at the center.

Little Wu felt that if those deities and near-immortal beings were to revert to their youth, to their nascent forms, they probably wouldn't be in a state as impressive as Brother Ming's current one.

Qin Ming felt utterly at ease. In the past, he had forcefully unleashed Heavenly Radiance, needing to exert full effort each time, which, though achievable, was quite strenuous.

Now, the Heavenly Radiance flowed naturally, overflowing far beyond his body. This was the true essence of the Second Realm — the outward manifestation of Heavenly Radiance.

In fact, many on the New Life Path had abandoned the title of "Outer Saint" because they themselves felt unworthy. Facing cultivators from other paths, whom could they truly call a saint? They referred to the Second Realm as "Outward Manifestation" instead.

Qin Ming stood up, reining in the Heavenly Radiance, and all the miraculous phenomena disappeared with it.

He felt his own power and didn't find anything inappropriate about the title "Outer Saint."

Little Wu said, "Brother Ming, you're out of seclusion? Your current state shocks me. If the Second Realm is also measured by your standards, I feel there will be mountain-like pressure."

Qin Ming smiled. He felt as if he had undergone a complete metamorphosis, his cultivation dramatically increasing. After all, he had broken through a major realm; this was a natural change.

However, he quickly calmed down, thinking of the various drawbacks of the New Life Path, and Meng Xinghai's lament from before.

After reaching the Second Realm, for those on the New Life Path, each small step forward, even for geniuses, often took over ten years!

The mere thought of this scene was terrifying. Normally, an Outer Saint wanting to enter the Third Realm—the Spirit Field—would probably become an old man by then.

This was indeed the case; there were no young experts on the New Life Path!

Qin Ming's conviction was firm. He said, "I am an Outer Saint now. From this point forward, the path will be exceedingly difficult. I must break destiny and change my original trajectory."

He didn't want to waste half his life only to enter the Spirit Field Realm in his old age.

That would be truly pathetic.

That night, Qin Ming and Little Wu drank heartily, celebrating the incredibly important step he had taken on the New Life Path.

The two decided to leave Great Yu and set off for the border region between Great Rui and Great Gan, from where they would advance into Kunling.

Because recently, people from the Immortal Path and the Esoteric Sect had been there, occasionally unearthing strange scriptures.

Especially, there had been continuous reports of turmoil from that area. Qin Ming heard that many Esoteric Sect disciples were trapped in ruins, and immediately thought of his old friend Ning Siqi.

"Is he there?" He was genuinely worried.

In the past, when Qin Ming ceased to be a Cui family descendant and became an outcast, many people were eager to distance themselves from him. Only Ning Siqi had offered timely help, traveling thousands of miles to deliver the "Fire Severance Sutra" to him, which was also the first wondrous art he obtained.

The next day, Qin Ming and Little Wu boarded a flying ship, heading towards the borderland between the two great dynasties.

This time, Qin Ming would return as an Outer Saint, to meet his adversaries and see his old acquaintances.
