# Chapter 213: Thousand Jun Shakes Mountain Hammer Technique Reaches Minor Accomplishment

He was terrified. As he retreated violently, he shattered seven floor tiles, yet he saw Xu Yunfan following like a shadow. The third strike, the "Star Pointing Style," was already thrusting toward his brow.

At the critical moment of life and death, the True Blood General bit the tip of his tongue and spat a blood arrow.

The protective vital energy, fueled by burning his life essence blood, condensed into a wolf's head, but it crumbled the instant the tip of the mace touched it.

As the gilded mace pierced through his skull, the nine dragon patterns on it simultaneously burst with blazing light, burning the dissipating True Blood aura from his body into green smoke.

"Only three strikes."

Sensing the rapidly depleting strength within his body, Xu Yunfan flicked his wrist to shake off the bloodstains on the mace. The gilded mace suddenly let out a deafening dragon's roar.

The divine weapon had a spirit. As if feeling unsatisfied, it actually guided him autonomously to execute the fourth form, the "River Overturning Style."

The mace shadow transformed into a hundred-zhang wave of fire, sweeping the General's still-standing残躯 (remains) into the air.

The true terror of the Nine Profound Dragon-Subduing Mace Technique was only now revealed.

The fifth strike, the "Earth Splitting Style," smashed the remains into the rock strata, and six pillars of magma erupted in response.

The sixth strike...

The seventh strike...

When the eighth strike, the "Sunfall Style," descended from the heavens, the observing Black Armor Army fell to their knees in droves.

They watched helplessly as their commander's remains vaporized beneath the mace's edge. The burning gilded mace seemed to牵引 (pull) the meteors from beyond the heavens; with every shake, it was like flowing magma, illuminating the battlefield as bright as day.

"The ninth strike."

Xu Yunfan stepped on the molten rock beneath his feet, and the nine dragon patterns on the gilded mace suddenly flew out of it.

"Return to Origin."

The sharp edge of the nine dragons merging into one pierced through the clouds.

The main peak of the Divine Weapon Ridge, already halved, was pierced through by this mace light, leaving a massive hole. The final traces of the True Blood General's existence, along with the elite troops of the Great Qian and the experts of the Luo Net within the entire Divine Weapon Valley, were all annihilated in the scorching flames that burned the sky.

The disciples of the Divine Weapon Ridge who witnessed this scene were all silent, their expressions blank.

Even Zhan Yan gaped, his jaw nearly dislocating from the shock.

He had never imagined that the玄钢机匣 (mystic steel mechanism box) Xu Yunfan had been carrying on his back would actually contain a divine weapon.

"This is... the art of hiding mechanisms and storing qi!"

Zhan Yan understood immediately. Xu Yunfan had actually practiced the Heaven's Artisan Forging Technique deeper than he had, secretly developing the method to hide mechanisms and store qi.

As Xu Yunfan put the mace back into the mechanism box, the nine dragon patterns dimmed once more.

The Lin (Seal) state also quickly faded. Having used it for so long, he had far exceeded his previous limits. Cracks of deep purple bloodstains covered his body, and the soreness between his muscles and tendons made him feel somewhat unwell. Moreover, the Red Serpent Mountain-Crushing Vital Energy...

*'You have successfully killed a powerful enemy. Your proficiency in the Thousand Jun Shakes Mountain Hammer Technique has increased significantly.'*

*'Your Thousand Jun Shakes Mountain Hammer Technique has reached Minor Accomplishment.'*

*'Thousand Jun Shakes Mountain Hammer Technique, 0/1000 (Minor Accomplishment)'*

As this message appeared in his vision, a massive surge of warm currents erupted within his body, rapidly strengthening his physique. The originally broken left arm began to heal rapidly, and the bones, skin, and flesh of his body began to undergo drastic changes.

Explosive sounds like frying beans erupted from the fracture in his left arm.

The shattered ulna was wrapped by a golden-red substance and reorganized. The surface of the new bone took on the luster of gold and jade, and when the joints turned, they actually brought forth the sound of wind and thunder.

The Hundred Tempering Mystic Steel Body pulsed continuously. The skin took on the cold light of陨铁 (meteoric iron). What seeped out from the pores was no longer sweat, but as if fine golden sparks were being ejected from them.

Xu Yunfan's spine let out the sound of a bowstring snapping. The twenty-four vertebrae of his spinal column pushed the Red Serpent Mountain-Crushing Vital Energy up one by one. The originally tangled muscles transformed into streamlined dragon patterns. When the muscle bundles stretched, the unique spiral patterns of the Red Serpent Mountain-Crushing Vital Energy faintly appeared.

*Chichi!*

With a series of grating sounds of silk tearing from within his body, Xu Yunfan's stature grew several inches taller. The muscles of his body relaxed, swelled, and then relaxed again. As the muscles and tendons continuously contracted, they became as solid as forged steel. His originally massive figure of over two meters was forcibly condensed to around 1.89 meters.

The memories surging in his mind were like a river bursting its banks. The eighteen styles of the Thousand Jun Shakes Mountain Hammer Technique were deconstructed and reorganized in an instant.

When Xu Yunfan closed his eyes, he could clearly see the hammer techniques he had accumulated. Now, they all awakened as muscle memory. There was no longer any gap between the hammer handle and his palm, nor any delay between the hammer head and his mind. The eighteen paths of the hammer technique had completely merged into his body, becoming instinct.

The hidden injuries of the Hundred Tempering Mystic Steel Body were all healed in this nirvana.

The toughened skin took on the cold gleam of a falling star. The faint golden patterns at the intersections of the thirty-six major acupoints connected end to end. Even the Huiyin and Yongquan acupoints, which he used to deliberately conceal, were now seamlessly integrated.

The seven vital points Zhan Yan had probed with bone-piercing nails now wandered不定 (unpredictably) around his body with his breath.

The dragon's roar of the Red Serpent Mountain-Crushing Vital Energy erupted from deep within his marrow.

The Red Serpent phantom that originally resided in his Dantian had grown horns, tumbling through his flesh and blood as his vital energy and blood surged.

Xu Yunfan lightly flicked a finger, and his strength burst forth. A crisp sound was easily produced in the air, and the deep purple bloodstains on his body quickly vanished.

He stepped across the vitrified battlefield. The residual heat of the gilded mace蒸成 (evaporated) the bloodstains into red mist.

"..."

In the pool of blood, Zhan Yan struggled to prop up half of his body.

The heat waves rising from the scorched earth distorted his vision. Zhan Yan leaned his body against an iron mound formed by broken halberds. His gray-white, thick beard was stained with blood.

The old man, who had spent his life worrying about the legacy of the Divine Weapon Ridge, let out a wheezing sound from his chest cavity. Every laugh shook loose rust like falling snow.

"Good! Good!"

The laughter suddenly turned into a cough. Dark red clots of blood砸在 (struck) the vitrified ground, mixed with fragments of light like ice shards.

The old man's turbid eyes suddenly became as clear as lightning. His fingers, like withered branches, dug fiercely into the ground.

"The divine weapon hasn't认主 (recognized a master)... cough, cough... You brat are quite厉害 (capable). I don't know what method you used to temporarily control it..."

He had naturally seen that the divine weapon mace in Xu Yunfan's hand had not recognized him as its master, but was being controlled by Xu Yunfan through some unknown method.

"Master, don't speak for now."

When Xu Yunfan knelt on one knee before Zhan Yan, the molten glass at the soles of his boots made a cracking sound.

He then saw his master's injuries clearly. The bulging, knotted muscles should have been like a dried-up riverbed, cracked, with bizarre white edges on every wound.

This was it. The blood had run dry, and the flesh and blood were no longer ruddy.

Zhan Yan was almost at the end of his rope.

Looking at Xu Yunfan's anxious and somewhat at-a-loss expression.

"Save your strength." Zhan Yan suddenly raised his hand with his last bit of strength to push his disciple away. His body flipped, and his back slammed heavily against a broken wall.

His broken body made a creaking sound as if it could no longer bear the load, but he didn't care in the slightest. Instead, the corner of his mouth pulled into a satisfied arc: "This old man has finally taught a promising disciple. I can finally give an account to the ancestors."

"..."

Although he knew this old man had a fierce temper, he never expected it to be this fierce.

Xu Yunfan glanced around. Confirming that the disciples of the Divine Weapon Ridge were in the distance, he pushed the mechanism box at his waist to his chest. With a flick of his finger, he opened a small hole in the mystic steel box and tapped it a few times with his finger.

The Ginseng Spirit couldn't stand the tapping. Its head 'swished' out, chattering and cursing at Xu Yunfan.
