**Chapter 38: The Ice Block Adored by Stars, Li Mo: "I Really Don't Envy It At All."**

At this moment, Qingyuan Sect undoubtedly became the most dazzling presence in Purple Sun Prefecture, its vibrant glow almost eclipsing the moonlight in the sky.

In a quaint room in Purple Sun City, an elder in luxurious robes had his feet resting in the laps of two young maidservants, warming himself. He suddenly noticed the color of the window screen change.

He slowly rose and asked, "Why is there such a dazzling glow outside?"

"Reporting, Prefect, it originates from the direction of Qingyuan Sect."

"Qingyuan..." The elder pondered for a moment, his expression shifting several times. "Send a letter, inviting Elder Yinhua of Precious Beast Peak to visit the manor."

"Yes..." The butler agreed, then hesitated, looking as if he had more to say.

"Hmm? Speak if you have something on your mind."

"Princess Chulong... she's gone." The butler finished, sweat pouring down his face, not daring to look at his master, the Prefect of Purple Sun Prefecture.

After a long while, a faint voice finally came, "Dig three feet deep, you must find her."

"Yes."

On Emerald Snail Lake, a ship as massive as a mountain lay across the waters, hardly smaller than the surrounding islands. Black banners fluttered in the wind, emblazoned with the bold characters: "Scarlet Whale."

The Scarlet Whale Gang, one of the three sects of Purple Sun Prefecture, was outwardly the weakest among them. However, its members comprised a mix of all walks of life, a veritable den of dragons and fish, boasting a membership of a hundred thousand. Covertly, countless martial arts factions maintained clandestine ties with them.

A burly, bearded man, the chieftain of the Scarlet Whale Gang and an Outer Scenery Realm expert, stood at the bow of the ship, hands clasped behind his back, gazing into the distance.

"Did Qingyuan Sect unearth a rare treasure, or has some sort of inheritance been activated?"

"Chieftain, I believe it's the latter," a pale, beardless youth behind him remarked.

For some reason, the bearded chieftain, despite being the leader of the Scarlet Whale Gang, did not refute or question the youth's words.

"Qingyuan Sect has a long history; to still have an inheritance manifest now... such an inheritance must be extraordinary. Only a chosen prodigy would be qualified to receive it, perhaps someone with the potential for the Hidden Dragon List?" the burly chieftain mused in a deep voice. He had always wanted the Scarlet Whale Gang to ascend to a higher level under his leadership, to usurp Qingyuan Sect's position as the foremost power. It was a very real possibility; Shangguan Wencang, after all, was already old.

"With me here, what if one or two prodigies appear in this small Purple Sun Prefecture? Could they possibly surpass me?" The youth, clad in red robes, licked his lips.

"You speak wisely, senior," the Scarlet Whale Gang chieftain said, the worry in his eyes vanishing.

In the Northern Dark Region, atop an impossibly towering peak, stood a hundred-story giant pagoda, seemingly able to touch the sky. This was Yantian Sect. The renowned Hidden Dragon, Heaven, Earth, and Man lists that shook the world all originated from here.

On the stargazing platform at the top of the pagoda, an old woman with a full head of white hair had been gazing upward for an unknown duration. Suddenly, her eyelids twitched, and her ancient voice murmured, "The Nine Heavens were misaligned, the Grand Yin Star flourished, yet why is there chaos once more?"

She took a jade disk from her bosom. Upon it, countless jade pieces, each the size of a fingernail, slowly slid. As she activated it, the pieces moved faster and faster. Abruptly, they jammed, and the entire jade disk dimmed. Along with it, the old woman's face grew pale.

"Cough, cough, cough..."

"Master, what's wrong?"

"Flicker... Flicker..."

"Are you referring to the 'Flicker disturbance' recorded by the founder?"

The old woman sighed deeply, her pallid face somehow looking even older. The bright-eyed maiden pursed her lips, her heart in turmoil. Yantian Sect was known to perceive the Heavenly Mandate, observe the rise and fall of myriad generations, and even subtly influence them, including the founding of Great Yu and the ascension of Emperor Wu. The "Flicker disturbance" represented one thing: Yantian Sect would soon be unable to perceive the Heavenly Secrets.

"Master, the Crown Prince seeks an audience," another disciple announced.

"Tell him this old woman will not help him find Princess Chulong, and cannot find her."

At Qingyuan Sect, with such a momentous event occurring, the sect trials were naturally terminated early. Primarily, throughout the entire Qingyuan Mountain Range, wherever the glow shone, all exotic beasts, regardless of strength, scrambled to escape or lay trembling on the ground. Continuing the sect trials would have been utterly meaningless.

On Moon-Gazing Cliff, the thin old man walked to the edge of the precipice. Shangguan Wencang was still wearing his simple, faded hemp robes, looking more like an old farmer from a neighboring village than a sect master.

"Sect Master."
