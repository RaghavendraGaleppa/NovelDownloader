# Chapter 57: Torment

Chen Fei shook the blood off his sword and entered the back hall. Several people lay sprawled there, including the two who had just tracked Chen Fei and reported to the Shallow Water Gang.

There were quite a few skilled fighters here, four of them in the Bone Forging realm. There were several such establishments in Xingfen City, and deploying a few Bone Forging realm cultivators in one was considered a considerable move. However, against Chen Fei's ambush, the four's combat strength appeared somewhat mediocre. Having integrated so many cultivation techniques, Chen Fei was now far stronger than lone cultivators of the same realm.

After a quick search for silver, Chen Fei began looking for information on the Shallow Water Gang. He didn't quite trust the intelligence he had just purchased; the shopkeeper didn't look like a trustworthy person. Chen Fei searched the back hall and found several shelves of documents in one room. Following the categorization, Chen Fei quickly found the information related to the Shallow Water Gang.

Chen Fei had initially intended to leave immediately but paused, taking all the documents he deemed necessary. Summoning the cabinet from his spatial grid, Chen Fei tucked the thick stack of papers inside before finally leaving the location.

"There's actually a Marrow Cleansing realm martial artist; the first version of the information didn't mention this!" After quickly reading through the Shallow Water Gang's information, Chen Fei's brows furrowed slightly. Although this Marrow Cleansing realm martial artist was old and had suffered a severe injury years ago, which led to a decline in his combat power now, he was still in the Marrow Cleansing realm, fundamentally different from the Bone Forging realm.

Stepping out of a market, Chen Fei looked up at the direction of Shallow Water Gang leader Xu Zaichuan's mansion, pondered for a moment, then strode forward.

"Speak," Xu Zaichuan said, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"I don't know that alchemist either," Chi Defeng said, looking at Xu Zaichuan with terror, his voice hushed. "Each time, he came to me for transactions, entrusting me to sell his pills. After selling them each day, he'd give me a small fee for my troubles."

The smile slowly vanished from Xu Zaichuan's face. He walked step by step towards Chi Defeng, suddenly drawing a long sword and plunging it into Chi Defeng's thigh.

"Ah!" Chi Defeng shrieked, utterly unable to dodge.

"You think I'm easy to fool, do you? Then keep lying; let's see how far you can stretch the truth!" Xu Zaichuan forcefully twisted the long sword embedded in Chi Defeng's thigh. In mere moments, Chi Defeng's thigh was a bloody mess.

"Hiss..." Chi Defeng was in too much pain to scream, only gasping sounds escaped him.

"I'm telling the truth, you can go investigate," Chi Defeng's weak voice emerged, his face terribly pale.

"Did you find out who he had deep contact with before?" Xu Zaichuan turned to his subordinate.

"That old fox is extremely cautious. Every time we tailed his people, we were shaken off. We never found out where he lives or who he's contacted."

Realizing that pretense was useless, Chi Defeng burst into laughter instead. Xu Zaichuan's eyes narrowed, and he roared in furious anger, "Torture him! I want to see him begging on his knees to die!"

"Yes!" The Shallow Water Gang members chorused in agreement, grabbing Chi Defeng's fingers and reaching for them with pliers.

"Whoosh!" An arrow suddenly shot forth, embedding itself in the body of that Shallow Water Gang member. The immense force of the arrow sent him crashing directly to the ground, and the pliers in his hand dropped with a sharp clatter.

Everyone was startled, then two more arrows flew in, piercing the hearts of two other men, killing them instantly.

"Enemy attack!" At this, everyone reacted, scrambling to find cover from the arrows. Some in the corners hugged the walls, trying to rush out and kill the attacker.

"Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh..." Arrows whistled continuously. Those who tried to peek out were immediately pinned through the forehead by arrows. And those who hadn't found cover yet also found an arrow embedded in their bodies.

The remaining Shallow Water Gang members hurled hidden weapons towards the direction of the bow and arrow, and some who were skilled archers themselves also shot back. But immediately, all these counterattacking individuals found new holes in their bodies. For those hit by arrows with great force, the arrowheads passed straight through them.
