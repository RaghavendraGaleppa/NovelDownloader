# Chapter 10: Blue Starry Sea

As a Foundation Establishment expert, Zhang Yu's wealth was indeed substantial. Lin Xuan found a trove of treasures in the storage belt, including over twenty low-grade spirit stones—a veritable fortune for someone like him.

There were also more than a dozen talismans, among which two mid-grade ones particularly delighted Lin Xuan: the offensive Fire Dragon Technique and the defensive Water Spirit Shield. Additionally, he discovered several medicinal pills and a top-grade spiritual artifact.

Holding the white jade ring in his hand, even the normally composed Lin Xuan couldn't hide his excitement. After all, even the Foundation Establishment uncles and elders in the sect mostly possessed only high-grade spiritual artifacts—top-grade ones were rare treasures that couldn't be sought out by mere effort.

With the treasures from Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu, Lin Xuan's wealth now surpassed that of any Foundation Establishment expert in the valley. Moreover, in Zhang Yu's storage belt, he found another item—a close-fitting undershirt woven from some unknown material, incredibly resilient and clearly a defensive treasure, which Lin Xuan promptly wore.

After organizing his gains, Lin Xuan sat cross-legged to examine his physical condition. While the storage belt and bracelet were valuable, the seashell in the sandalwood box was the true treasure. Though Lin Xuan didn't yet know its purpose, Zhou Yan's willingness to kill her own master to keep it spoke volumes about its worth.

The events of the previous day remained vivid in his mind—the blue light points from the seashell merging into his body before the shell itself crumbled to dust. Clearly, these blue lights held the key to unraveling the mystery.

Lin Xuan methodically pieced together his thoughts. He preferred to plan before acting, even when solving mysteries—there was no room for haphazard guessing. First, he concluded that the blue lights weren't harmful; rather, they must be beneficial, given how highly they were valued. With this in mind, he began his research calmly.

Finding no visible changes, Lin Xuan employed his inner vision technique to inspect his dantian and meridians. While his spiritual energy flowed normally, his dantian revealed something unexpected—scattered blue light points, beautiful as stars in the night sky, slowly rotating like a celestial sea.

It mirrored what he'd seen inside the seashell, except now these lights resided within him.

The discovery was surprising yet logical. Lin Xuan remained composed, focusing his spiritual sense to observe. Each blue point twinkled like a star, but after prolonged observation, nothing changed—his body remained unaffected.

Visual inspection alone yielded no answers. Hesitating briefly, Lin Xuan gathered the faint spiritual energy in his dantian—about the size of a needle—and cautiously touched one of the blue lights. He had prepared for various outcomes, but the result defied expectations—the spiritual needle passed through effortlessly, eliciting no reaction.

Undeterred by the failed attempt, Lin Xuan remained patient. He knew uncovering the lights' purpose would take time—a fact he'd already accepted. Unlike impulsive youths, he possessed remarkable maturity for his age.

After resting and eating his first meal since noon the previous day (higher-level cultivators could sustain themselves on spiritual energy alone, but Lin Xuan wasn't at that stage yet), he resumed his research. Despite hours of effort from dawn till dusk, progress remained elusive.

That night, lying in bed, Lin Xuan reviewed the day's experiments. Clearly, deciphering the blue lights' secrets would require more time.

In the following days, Lin Xuan maintained his routine cultivation while secretly investigating the lights. He monitored his body for any changes, but found none—no pain, no anomalies, and his cultivation speed remained as sluggish as ever. Though his methods yielded no results, he remained convinced of the lights' value—he simply hadn't found the right approach. There was no rush; he could afford to study them slowly.

Meanwhile, Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu's disappearance sent shockwaves through Piaoyun Valley. Zhou Yan had ranked among the top three Qi Refinement disciples, poised for Foundation Establishment within years. Her vanishing naturally drew attention. As for Zhang Yu—a mid-Foundation Establishment elder—his disappearance shook the entire sect, as Piaoyun Valley was small, and such experts were few.

Under the personal oversight of Sect Leader Yunhe Zhenren, numerous Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment disciples were dispatched to search for the pair.

Observing the sect's reaction, Lin Xuan felt relieved rather than worried. While appearing unaffected, he had been monitoring the situation closely. The sect leader's concern was solely for Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu's fate—there was no mention of the seashell treasure.

This, coupled with Zhou Yan's willingness to kill her master to steal it, suggested their actions were independent, not sanctioned by the sect. Lin Xuan concluded that as long as Piaoyun Valley didn't pursue the seashell's whereabouts, he was safe. Even if the bodies were discovered, no one would connect the deaths of two powerful cultivators to a low-tier disciple without spiritual roots.

He was secure.
