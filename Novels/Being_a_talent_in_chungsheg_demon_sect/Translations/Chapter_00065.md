## Investigating the Changes of Heaven and Man, Startling Realization!

At the same time as Ji Xiongying's 'fortunate encounter', Lu Yang had already arrived in the most prosperous and martial artist-dense area of Tianjing City.

This was the Haoran Academy.

This institution, which possessed a volume of Heavenly Scripture and pioneered the Fourth Step of Martial Dao, had now subtly surpassed both Daoism and Buddhism, becoming the sacred land of martial arts. However, strangely, ever since the Fourth Step of Martial Dao was established and its methods widely disseminated, the Dean of Haoran Academy, the 'Saint-Heart Scholar' Wang Boyuan, had gradually receded from public view, living an increasingly reclusive life. By now, even the academy's high-ranking officials rarely saw him.

"What a wonderful place with excellent Feng Shui," Lu Yang mused. To avoid attracting attention, Lu Yang had dispersed his form, turning into an invisible wisp of Qi, observing the Haoran Academy with great interest. In his view, this academy was a truly blessed land, teeming with exceptional individuals and spiritual energy. Throughout Tianjing City, only this place overflowed with spiritual energy. Even an ordinary person, if they studied here for several years, would develop a measure of spiritual wisdom and cleverness.

What was even more remarkable was that this was not a natural phenomenon, but a man-made one. The academy's overall layout, the location of each classroom, the arrangement of flowers, birds, fish, insects, and various other landscapes – all elevated the mundane Feng Shui arts to a higher level, subtly forming the rudiments of a Spirit Gathering Array! Just from this, Lu Yang knew that the 'Saint-Heart Scholar' was absolutely extraordinary.

With this thought, Lu Yang took a step and appeared directly in a study deep within the academy, ready to meet this renowned local figure. Then, to his surprise, he saw the scene inside the study. The person within was not the handsome scholar he had imagined, holding a feather fan and wearing a silk scarf, but a disheveled man with messy hair, constantly drinking.

*Is this the 'Saint-Heart Scholar'?*

Just then, the slovenly man suddenly looked up, his eyes hazy with drink, towards Lu Yang's location. "I didn't expect to have such a distinguished guest arrive."

"..."

With a thought, Lu Yang re-materialized, transforming from an invisible wisp of Qi into a tangible body. He cupped his hands in a salute to the slovenly man. "Lu Yang greets Daoist Friend Wang."

"Boyuan greets the esteemed guest." The slovenly man returned the salute, then patted his sleeves and stood up, exclaiming, "Your Excellency's abilities are extraordinary. Your previous battle with the Martial King Changkong left me utterly astounded, making me believe several times that an immortal deity had descended. May I ask what brings Your Excellency to seek me out?"

"I wish to discuss the Way of Heaven and Man with you, Daoist Friend." Lu Yang got straight to the point. "The Fourth Step of Martial Dao, 'Investigating the Changes of Heaven and Man,' although I have some insight, I have yet to grasp the key points. I implore Daoist Friend to enlighten me."

Wang Boyuan blinked upon hearing this. "With Your Excellency's capabilities, are you also interested in martial arts?"

"The stones from other mountains can be used to polish jade," Lu Yang said calmly. "Are you willing to teach me, Daoist Friend?"

Upon hearing this, Wang Boyuan burst into laughter. "A guest is a guest, let alone an esteemed one. If Your Excellency wishes to learn, I, Wang, will naturally tell you everything I know and hide nothing!" He continued, "However, the Way of Heaven and Man is diverse, created by martial artists based on their understanding of Heaven and Earth and themselves. Therefore, I cannot describe it in detail to Your Excellency; I can only briefly explain my personal method. If Your Excellency has any doubts, you may seek out other Heaven-Men."

With that, the two sat opposite each other.

"The Fourth Step of Martial Dao, I, Wang, call it 'Investigating the Changes of Heaven and Man'. As the name implies, it is to leverage the power of oneself to sway Heaven and Earth, and for humans to peer into Heavenly Secrets!" Wang Boyuan explained. "My 'Fate-Gazing Art' is precisely this, and it encompasses the Changes of the Three Powers."

"The Three Powers are Heaven, Earth, and Man. First, one gazes upon man to understand physiognomy; then, one gazes upon the earth to understand Feng Shui; finally, one gazes upon Heaven to understand Heaven's Mandate! These three are intertwined!" Wang Boyuan elaborated. "By observing man, one understands the earth; by observing the earth, one understands Heaven; by observing Heaven, one understands destiny... At my stage, I can know the changes in the world without stepping outside. I can observe changes in national destiny, where disasters might occur, where civil unrest might arise, where officials are inactive, or where those who receive stipends compete with the common people for profit. I can foresee most of these." He concluded, "Although there are still omissions, seven or eight out of ten predictions are accurate."

To Lu Yang's surprise, Wang Boyuan truly held nothing back, revealing the entirety of his 'Fate-Gazing Art', whose changes even involved causality! Of course, this was not truly divining causality. Strictly speaking, what Wang Boyuan did was merely 'guess', thus he couldn't deduce details, only grasp general outlines and know certain specific events. Nevertheless, it was astonishing enough!

*How did he do it?*

Facing Lu Yang's confusion, Wang Boyuan shook his head. "To be honest, I simply had a moment of unexpected enlightenment one day; there was no trickery involved."

"I see." Lu Yang nodded. The two exchanged insights for several more hours before Lu Yang finally rose to take his leave, intending to visit other Heaven-Men.

Meanwhile, within the Wei family mansion.

The Old Ancestor of the Yun family opened his Dharma Eye, silently observing the entire conversation between Lu Yang and Wang Boyuan. Afterward, he retracted his gaze, without the slightest ripple of emotion.

"That demon, truly ignorant." He had no interest in Wang Boyuan's insights, for no one knew better than him that Wang Boyuan's enlightenment was precisely due to him having stirred causality to make it happen! In any case, it wasn't something that could truly comprehend causality, merely a "guessing method" for mortals. The Old Ancestor of the Yun family didn't care at all, a cold sneer forming in his heart. *Discussing the Dao with the various Heaven-Men, does he want to take another fifth step based on my foundation, and pull Martial Dao back onto the right track?*

*Simply wishful thinking!* After all, he had stirred causality to allow Wang Boyuan to create the Fourth Step of Martial Dao, elevating martial arts' limit to the Great Perfection of Qi Refinement. This was already the absolute peak. Because anything beyond that was Foundation Establishment! And how could Lu Yang possibly create a Foundation Establishment method? Thus, in the Old Ancestor of the Yun family's view, Lu Yang's actions were utterly meaningless and futile.

According to the Old Ancestor of the Yun family's calculations, the current Way of Heaven and Man had already disrupted Lu Yang's 'Saint's Robbery' cultivation. To break this deadlock, the only way was to first kill all Heaven-Men and then eradicate the Way of Heaven and Man. And what he had to do was kill Lu Yang's avatar, forcing his true body to act personally. In this way, Lu Yang would fall into the trap.

From this perspective, Wang Boyuan was merely a chess piece for the Old Ancestor of the Yun family. And naturally, the Old Ancestor of the Yun family had no interest in a chess piece. As for the astonishment in Lu Yang's eyes, it was not worth mentioning in the Old Ancestor of the Yun family's eyes. Including Lu Yang himself, although the Old Ancestor of the Yun family treated him with seriousness, a hint of disdain always lingered in his heart.

Because ultimately, they were just a group of mortals.

"With the 'Heaven-Peering Instrument' bestowed by the Sect Master, even a Foundation Establishment True Person wouldn't detect my presence. What kind of splash can mere mortals make?"

Leaving Haoran Academy, Lu Yang once again transformed into an invisible wisp of Qi, walking through the streets and alleys of Tianjing City, carefully contemplating the recent exchange with Wang Boyuan.

*"The Three Powers Fate-Gazing Art..."*

Thousands of miles away, Lu Yang's true body opened his eyes. A halo of light shone brightly behind his head, and the Grand Micro Treasure Talisman circulated, silently deducing the various changes in Tianjing City. The feedback from causality indicated: everything was normal.

*"Tianjing City will be very stable for the next thirty years. There are no changes in causality. This is normal, after all, two Martial Dao Heaven-Men are guarding it..."*

Suddenly, Lu Yang changed his approach. Instead of directly deducing the overall causality of Tianjing City from a "macro" perspective, he adopted Wang Boyuan's 'Fate-Gazing Art' approach. He began by observing the people of Tianjing City, deducing individual causality, and then, based on the Changes of the Three Powers, inversely deducing the causality of Heaven and Earth. The reason for this was simply to verify the 'Fate-Gazing Art'.

However, the very next second, Lu Yang froze.

*"The breakfast stall on East Street, Wang Erniu's family of three. Using the Grand Micro Treasure Talisman, supplemented by the Fate-Gazing Art, they should have many descendants, yet there is a major calamity of sudden violent death..."*

*"Chen Qing, a constable from the Six-Fan Gate... has a major calamity of sudden violent death."*

*"Li Chengrong: calamity of sudden violent death."*

*"Liu Xinshang: calamity of sudden violent death."*

Calamity! Calamity! Calamity!

Everyone, almost every single person Lu Yang saw in Tianjing City, seemed destined to face a calamity of sudden violent death. Yet, when magnified to the entire city, there was no change at all!

How was this possible? If the entire city's population truly faced a calamity of sudden violent death, Tianjing City would have long been shrouded in dark clouds. With his personality, he would absolutely not have approached it...

*...No!*

In an instant, Lu Yang's pupils contracted sharply! From the subtle, one can know the evident; from man, one can calculate Heaven. One person might be miscalculated, but if ten, a thousand, or ten thousand people were all like this, then Heaven itself was wrong!

*"The Heavenly Secrets and causality are being obscured—damn it, a Foundation Establishment True Person in this secret realm is trying to harm me!?"*
