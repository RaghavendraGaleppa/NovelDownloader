# Chapter 80: Listening Gloom

Gazing at the lifelike red wax idol, Lu Yang's interest grew. In his previous life, he had spent a full decade studying the souls of Foundation Establishment Masters. It was precisely because of this that he could discern it.

“May I ask which senior is before me?” Lu Yang cupped his hands and looked directly at the idol. In his eyes, a wisp of a Foundation Establishment soul was clearly hidden within the red wax sculpture!

However, the idol did not respond. It merely continued as before, stating, “Offend my sect’s doctrine, and ten thousand deaths cannot atone!”

As its voice fell, it took a step forward, vanishing in an instant. The distance between it and Lu Yang was traversed in that single step, and with fingers clasped, it brought its fist down!

Seeing this, Lu Yang neither dodged nor evaded, similarly throwing out a punch.

Witnessing this scene, the black-robed Daoist instantly rejoiced. This ancestral idol was no ordinary item. It was a treasure for self-protection and Dao-guarding, obtainable only by those of high standing within the Listening Gloom Sect, such as himself. Normally, carrying it could greatly slow down the speed at which one was devoured by wights. When necessary, one could also summon the ancestral true spirit, just like now, to suppress an enemy. Though it appeared to be merely a red wax body, a single punch from it was enough to cleave mountains and shatter rocks, utterly beyond the resistance of a mortal body. Thus, in his view, Lu Yang was seeking his own demise.

Boom!

The next second, a massive explosion erupted between Lu Yang and the idol. Surging waves of Qi swept in all directions, and then Lu Yang's body instantly disintegrated.

Whoosh—!

Clouds rose and fell, Qi dispersed and gathered. Rolling white smoke surged and boiled, rapidly pulling away from the idol before quickly re-coalescing into Lu Yang's form.

“What in the world was that!?” The black-robed Daoist was dumbfounded, clearly shaken by Lu Yang's unpredictable ability to gather and disperse. His gaze towards Lu Yang became even more wary.

On the other side, Lu Yang was full of admiration. “What a remarkable idol.” Even as he admired it, he concluded in his heart: this so-called Listening Gloom Sect was, in all likelihood, the remnant work of a reincarnated Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Witch Ghost Path!

“I knew it. A centipede dies but never stiffens. Since the Witch Ghost Path wasn't completely wiped out, it must have left behind some powerful hidden moves. Although, from what I saw in my previous life, these hidden moves probably failed. But for me, it's still a formidable entity…”

While Lu Yang pondered, the idol had already attacked again. Again, it threw a punch, and Lu Yang responded with his own, but he was still steadily pushed back, forced to disintegrate once more and reform his body far away.

“Not a match…” Lu Yang sighed. This Primordial Qi Incarnation of his specialized in martial arts, yet its physical body was inferior to the idol's. With its greatest advantage gone, victory was naturally difficult.

“…However, if you can call for backup, why can't I?”

The next second, Lu Yang abruptly formed a hand seal.

Crack!

Behind Lu Yang's head, a rift opened. Resplendent golden light surged forth from within, ultimately transforming into a massive hand, heavy as a mountain, which reached out! Outside the secret realm, Lu Yang's true body had made its move!

The golden light hand spread its five fingers. In its palm was a blood-red formation array, which it slapped downwards, instantly engulfing the idol within the array.

“Blood-Washing Heavenly River Sword Formation, activate!” As Lu Yang chanted the incantation, a chilling blood rain immediately poured within the formation. Each drop of blood rain seemed like a sharp sword beam, slashing down towards the idol.

“Insolent junior!” The idol stood firm and imposing, with myriad ghosts roaring around it, showing no fear. The wisp of Foundation Establishment soul within it also regained clarity, immediately sending a telepathic message: “A mere seventh-grade formation cannot faze this venerable one.”

“To which sect and path do you belong, disciple? If you can rescue this venerable one, I shall richly reward you. If you are willing, come to the Listening Gloom Sect’s main headquarters to meet me…”

“Senior seems to have misunderstood.” Outside the secret realm, Lu Yang’s true body gave a cold smile. “This formation isn’t meant to deal with Senior; it’s merely to temporarily trap you, to prevent you from escaping.”

“…What?”

The next second, outside the formation, Lu Yang’s true body’s ‘Saint Visage’ technique roared into action. The golden light hand gripped the grand array, and the Saint Marauder's Authority was pushed to its extreme. Then, with a forceful clap, like erasing a line of text from a book with an eraser, everything within its palm was instantly wiped away.

When the golden light hand unfurled once more, the idol had already been crushed into dust. Only a residual glimmer remained, which Lu Yang’s Primordial Qi Incarnation seized. It was none other than the divine ability light of [Xuanming Prefect Suppressing Gloom Position].

As for Lu Yang’s true body, he simply severed one of his arms. After all, this hand had already extended into the secret realm, and with the Golden Core sword Qi present, it couldn't be withdrawn. Keeping it would be a waste, and in any case, it could grow back.

Immediately after, Lu Yang controlled his avatar to put away the [Xuanming Prefect Suppressing Gloom Position]. After examining it carefully for a moment, he sighed with some regret: “It’s still incomplete—at most one percent. That’s right, this idol clearly looks mass-produced; it couldn’t possibly have too powerful a divine ability attached.”

As Lu Yang sighed, the black-robed Daoist beside him went mad. He stared blankly at the idol crushed to dust by Lu Yang. It was a long while before he snapped back to reality, his eyes instantly turning blood-red as he looked at Lu Yang: “You dare to destroy my sect’s ancestral idol?”

Lu Yang raised an eyebrow at that. “So that was the Listening Gloom Ancestor… A Foundation Establishment cultivator can really live that long? Successive reincarnations, clinging to life for over a thousand years?”

The black-robed Daoist completely ignored Lu Yang’s words. The Listening Gloom Sect was deeply rooted in the secret realm, revered by all. Now that the ancestral idol was destroyed, it was as if his faith had been defiled. He instantly lost all reason: “You destroyed the ancestral idol! My sect will never rest until you pay!”

Before he had finished speaking, he roared and lunged towards Lu Yang.

Seeing this, Lu Yang gave a cold smile. “Given the situation, it’s I who will not rest until *you* pay!” With that, he flicked his sleeve, and his Primordial True Qi transformed into a large hand, seizing the black-robed Daoist. Then, with a smack against the ground, it crushed both the man and the ghost into dust.

However, Lu Yang did not leave immediately afterward. Instead, he waited patiently for a moment. Soon, the Yin Qi in the area re-converged, and a brand new black-robed wight emerged. It was precisely the wight ‘Hu Mingluo’ that he had just crushed!

Lu Yang observed the entire process of the wight's revival, clicking his tongue in wonder: “So it’s true. This is why the Witch Ghost Path has managed to cling to life until now…”

Wights are unkillable! The Witch Ghost Secret Realm was deeply rooted, almost bound to the earth veins beneath Skull Mountain, forming a seamless internal and external whole, thereby creating a sealed circulatory system. After wights die, they transform into Yin Qi and merge into the earth veins. Then, the Yin Qi in the earth veins re-coalesces into wights, entering the secret realm, thereby achieving a form of immortality in an alternative sense. To break this, one must either uproot the secret realm along with the Skull Mountain earth veins, or make the secret realm actively emerge.

The latter was True Person Yinshan’s method, simply because no one would attempt the former. It wasn't that it couldn't be done, but that no one would do it. Uprooting earth veins was an action that severely damaged one's merit, directly affecting future reincarnations. One must understand, even Golden Core True Monarchs are not truly immortal. When their lifespan ends, they too must reincarnate and cultivate anew. And if one commits too many actions that deplete merit, they are bound to encounter more tribulations in their next life.

“That’s why this Golden Core sword Qi remained in the secret realm, choosing to slowly boil the frog rather than flipping the table directly.”

“From this perspective, my act of collecting ghosts is actually ill-advised. It will gradually cause the Yin Qi in the Skull Mountain earth veins to be drained…”

“…But, what does it matter?”

Lu Yang reached out and seized the newly revived black-robed wight, tossing it into his Myriad Spirit Banner, completely disregarding whether it would affect the Skull Mountain earth veins.

Merit? If it’s gone, it’s gone. If this life is a low point, then there’s room for progress in the next, right?
