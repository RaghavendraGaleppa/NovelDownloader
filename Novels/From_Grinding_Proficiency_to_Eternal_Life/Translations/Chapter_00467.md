# Chapter 467: Where in the World Can One Find Opportunities? It’s All a Trap!

An invisible web of fate had long since bound him tightly.

If he were to rashly attempt to rebel upon catching a glimpse of the truth, or to deviate from the carefully orchestrated "growth" trajectory set for him—for instance, by giving up the search for the next Heavenly or Terrestrial Essence, or trying to flee the Divine Martial Realm—then what awaited him would certainly not be freedom. Instead, it would be a thunderous "correction."

The outcome would inevitably be the scattering of his soul and the destruction of his body, or something even worse: the stripping away of all his will to resist, becoming a mindless puppet that continues down the preset path until the moment of harvest.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan lowered his eyebrows and eyes even further, suppressing the turbulent waves of shock, unwillingness, and anger within them, transforming them into a bottomless, cold abyss.

Impulsiveness was useless, and despair was merely courting death.

He slowly and forcefully clenched his fist, his fingernails digging into his palm, bringing a sharp, stinging pain that cleared his mind.

How could he break this deadlock?

Xu Yunfan lowered his eyelids, the turbulent emotions in his eyes quickly calming down.

"Lin."

Xu Yunfan’s lips and teeth moved slightly, uttering a silent mantra.

In an instant, the vital energy around his body stagnated for a moment before returning to normal. It was the first time he had used the Lin character mantra since entering the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm, and he was finally forced to use it now.

As the Lin character mantra activated, his spiritual sense instantly rose to the "Lin state," his thoughts becoming as clear and transparent as ice crystals. In this emotionless state of the Great Dao, he began to analyze the current predicament with reasoning that transcended conventional logic.

After a long while, Xu Yunfan raised his head, his eyebrows twitching slightly.

Repeatedly deducing his own trajectory in the state of the Great Dao, he finally made a discovery.

Although he was a transmigrator, he was ultimately a being born of the Divine Martial Realm.

The Heavenly Dao of this realm possesses its own consciousness; how could it be willing to be arbitrarily plucked by a True Lord from the outside world?

While within the Divine Martial Realm, this small world might seem like a tiny place in the eyes of a True Lord, it is still an independently operating realm.

The will of the Heavenly Dao would instinctively obscure his causal energy, just as a mother protects her fetus.

Although such concealment might be as fragile as paper before a True Lord, it nonetheless tore open a sliver of light in this desperate situation.

His eyes flashed with a sharp light. In this seemingly unsolvable predicament, he had finally deduced a thread of opportunity.

He had entered the Divine Martial Realm, and the True Lord was watching. The True Lord could only see the general picture and wouldn't be able to attend to every minor action.

Xu Yunfan quickly exited the Lin state, his eyes flickering with excitement.

He could only seek, and he had to be the first to seek!

The current situation was like dancing on the tip of a blade; one wrong step would lead to the abyss.

The only path was to 'grow' faster and more solidly within this cage, on the 'track' designated by the other party!

Absorb all the power that can be absorbed, master all the trump cards that can be mastered.

Only when the 'nourishment' is deep enough might there be a sliver of a gap, a possibility of accumulating enough power to sever the threads of fate and leap out of this cage just before the final 'harvest' arrives!

For now... he had to stay calm.

His only trump card at the moment was the Lin character mantra.

Aside from Yu Congling, whom he had taken into the Ten Thousand Soul Banner, everyone else who knew about it had basically been beaten to death by him.

Furthermore, with the protection of the Divine Martial Realm's Heavenly Lord, the True Lord could only see a vague picture.

The Lin character mantra is a supreme secret technique of the Wansheng Sword Sect. It practices the Way of the Great Dao and Forgetfulness of Emotion. With the seven emotions and six desires all gone, one can naturally draw close to the operation of the Heavenly Dao's laws, and thus find a path to survival.

The Heavenly Dao has forty-nine paths, and it always leaves one out.

The top priority right now was to improve his cultivation.

"These damn bastards..."

Xu Yunfan, feeling slightly more at ease, couldn't help but mutter a curse.

The Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm seems vast and boundless, with infinite opportunities. One might stumble upon a predecessor's cave and obtain a celestial opportunity just by walking.

But in reality, it's bait laid by others.

I wonder why the Baiyue True Lord rushed to the far north, insisting on confronting Li Qingling just to save me.

I've taken the bait.

Damn that True Lord!

After cursing internally, Xu Yunfan immediately lowered his eyebrows and eyes, quickly restraining his mind.

Existences like Golden Core True Lords have long surpassed the shackles of the mortal world; their spiritual sense can imprint upon the heart of the heavens.

Whenever a True Lord's name is mentioned, no matter how far apart, ripples will appear on their heart-mirror.

As the saying goes, "Words follow the law, thoughts move the heavenly secrets." Such beings who can reach the heavens are most taboo about being secretly thought of by others.

It's only slightly more permissible to do so within the Divine Martial Realm.

To advance to the mid Foundation Establishment stage now, he must find another pure and powerful "Heavenly or Terrestrial Essence," refine it, and merge it into his Dao Foundation. This will cause his true energy to undergo a qualitative change, give rise to stronger Dao techniques and divine abilities, and expand the limit of his soul's capacity.

The cultivation method that suits him, *True武 Subduing Demons Scripture*, has its own supreme origin in the Heavenly and Terrestrial Essences it requires.

According to the *True Scripture*, it naturally seeks to emulate the Dao lineage of the ancient True Martial Great Emperor who governed the stars of the entire universe.

The True Martial Great Emperor resided in the North Pole, commanded the Big Dipper constellation, suppressed all demons, and was in charge of both killing and protecting.

The foundation of his Dao techniques points directly to the origin of the Nine Heavens' stars.

The Thirty-six Heavenly Essences correspond to the image of the Nine Stars of the Big Dipper!

The Big Dipper's seven stars shine brightly in the world, with the two hidden assistant stars by their side, collectively known as the Nine Stars. They are the pivot of the heavens, operating the entire universe, and hold the great authority over life, death, and seizure.

The Seventy-two Terrestrial Essences originate from the combination and resonance of the Twenty-eight Lunar Mansions and the stars of the Big Dipper!

The Twenty-eight Lunar Mansions are distributed in the four directions, maintaining the balance of time and space through their cyclical movement. The stars of the Big Dipper, like wings, claws, and teeth, are scattered and distributed. Their energy is mixed and ever-changing, governing the changes of yin and yang, and the growth and decline of all things.

Xu Yunfan naturally understood how rare the Heavenly and Terrestrial Essences that fit the *True武 Subduing Demons Scripture* are; they are not on the same level as those of the Five Elements.

The aura compatible with True Martial's Big Dipper must be as magnificent as the scorching sun, wielding the power of life and death, supremely yang and supremely strong, shattering evil and revealing righteousness.

The best aura, on the other hand, should be as deep and profound as a valley, governing the transformation of yin and yang, containing yang within yin, and hiding strength within softness, harmonizing all things.

These two types of aura complement each other, are in opposition yet unity, and together form the crucial foundation of the "North Pole Suppressing Demon Aura" in the True Martial Subduing Demons lineage!

This is the most fundamental and highest-level cultivation path pointed to by the *True武 Subduing Demons Scripture*.

After cultivating the North Pole Suppressing Demon Aura, reaching the peak of Foundation Establishment will be in sight, and at that time, he will be able to obtain another great divine ability.

With five great divine abilities, he will naturally have the foundation to refine the innate golden nature.

Returning to the present, within this Divine Martial Realm, he must choose an aura that can be harvested and fused here, that is most compatible with himself, and that can provide greater assistance in his future "escape" plan.

The first thing Xu Yunfan thought of, naturally, was the most top-tier, most compatible with the *True Scripture*, and the domineering aura that corresponds to the破军 (Pojun) malevolent star among the Nine Heavens' stars.

North Dipper Pojun Aura.

This aura contains an unparalleled sharpness and the meaning of destruction. It governs killing and has a mighty power. Once integrated with his existing True Martial aura, it would undoubtedly increase his offensive capabilities several times over, allowing him to carry the momentum of stellar destruction with every move.

The Pojun star is the seventh star of the Big Dipper. Its energy is fierce and sharp. For someone in his situation who needs powerful combat strength, it is extremely tempting.
