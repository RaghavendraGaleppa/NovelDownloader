# Chapter 262: Explosive Slaughter

The clear voice of the woman in white reached Xu Yunfan’s ears as he watched the spectacle from afar. “Restrain him, otherwise, once he possesses you, you will fall into the endless abyss, never to be reincarnated.”

Xu Yunfan understood the gravity of the situation. If not for the remains of Yu Congling from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, he would have already been in grave danger.

In an instant, a cold light flashed in his eyes, and he hesitated no longer.

The dragon-scale armor plates around Xu Yunfan flared open, with crimson patterns flowing like magma across the surface, emitting a low dragon’s roar. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace in his right hand hummed and trembled, the tongues of red fire wrapped around its body growing three feet longer.

As he formed the Hand Seal of Lin (Stand), his vital energy and blood surged like a raging tide. He instantly entered the ‘Lin State,’ where his five senses’ acuity skyrocketed, and the flow of internal force within his body doubled! His hidden potential was rapidly squeezed, ignited, and unleashed by the Lin Seal at an unimaginable speed.

*Boom!*

The ground beneath his feet exploded into a spiderweb of cracks, and his figure shot toward the youth of the Primordial Demon Sect like a cannonball.

The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace, carrying the momentum of wind and thunder, executed the move “Proud Dragon Repents” and smashed straight toward the youth’s crown!

The youth sneered, flicking nine black seals from his sleeve. The seals were carved with soul-eroding demonic patterns and formed the “Nine Nether Soul-Locking Array” in mid-air, forcibly blocking the mace’s momentum.

“Pathetic martial arts, how dare you try to stop my Primordial Secret Method?!”

The youth laughed lightly, his expression full of disdain.

He formed a hand seal with his fingertips, and the black seals suddenly exploded, transforming into nine chains of sinister demonic energy that lashed toward Xu Yunfan’s limbs. Before the chains even arrived, the Yin-cold, bone-eroding aura already made the meridians in Xu Yunfan’s body ache with cold.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained unchanged. He naturally understood the immense threat this move posed. However, he had a different judgment in his heart: it wasn’t that he couldn’t dodge, nor did it seem that taking the hit head-on would be fatal.

Beneath the Lin Seal, which granted him a思维 speed beyond imagination, he quickly assessed the situation. Although the opponent was very likely a legendary Daoist cultivator, the gap in their realms wasn’t absurdly large. The previous misfortune was merely due to the suddenness caused by the difference in cultivation systems. If he were in the Lin State, with his blood and energy surging like waves and his force exploding forth, he might just be able to pull off a miracle through sheer power.

The strength of these two individuals didn't exceed the limits of martial arts too much. Perhaps the Ninth Realm of Martial Arts belonged to the same tier as the cultivators he had encountered. It was just a disadvantage caused by the combat systems.

However, this method of possession was truly marvelous.

At the critical moment, the woman in white, Yu Congling, pointed her sword finger toward the sky and shouted clearly, “Heavenly Sword Decree·Soul Severing!”

The white bone altar trembled violently, and nine blood pillars shot up into the sky, transforming into nine giant blood-colored swords suspended above the firmament. As she changed her sword seal, the giant swords fell like meteors, severing all the demonic chains!

The youth’s face changed drastically. He hastily summoned a bronze ancient shield carved with skulls. Rolling black mist gushed from the shield’s surface, barely managing to block the blood-colored sword light.

Yu Congling’s gaze finally showed a slight change.

“A Soul Artifact? You have quite the luck. No wonder you’ve been hiding in this realm, unwilling to leave even if it meant falling into a two-thousand-year slumber.”

At this point, Yu Congling revealed a rare sneer. “Jiang Xu, are you afraid your master will snatch it? Your Primordial Demon Sect is heartless. If others found out, you would likely die the very next day.”

“The Primordial Sect! It is the Primordial Sect!”

Jiang Xu corrected Yu Congling’s wording, his eyes narrowing slightly. “You sword-wielding madmen, how could you possibly think of such things?”

“My master cast a divination back then, saying that my karma lies within this realm. To refine my form and ascend, to walk the path of longevity, I must do what others cannot.”

“Refine your form and ascend?” Jiang Xu laughed. “You sure are ambitious.”

*Now!*

Xu Yunfan’s gaze turned almost tangible. Seizing the moment the youth was distracted, the dragon-scale armor plates clanged as they all stood erect, and blinding golden light burst forth from the gaps between the scales.

Under the full force of the Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength, the Golden Muscle Jade Bone manifestation appeared! His muscles swelled like coiling dragons, his skin took on a metallic sheen, and he actually charged through the residual demonic energy to reach the youth’s side. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace changed from a slash to a thrust, its tip condensing a speck of red light aimed directly at the youth’s chest!

*Splurt!*

The mace tip pierced through the bronze shield. The youth hastily dodged to the side, but his left shoulder was still pierced through.

Yu Congling said calmly, “This shield fixes the soul and spirit but cannot defend against the path of physical refinement. Jiang Xu, didn’t you know that?”

Jiang Xu roared in fury, but what spurted from his wound wasn’t blood, but a dense mass of black bugs! The bugs grew instantly in the wind, transforming into thumb-sized “Heart-Eating Demon Leeches” that crawled along the mace toward Xu Yunfan’s arm.

“Heart-Eating Gu?!”

Yu Congling’s pupils constricted. She hastily drew her sword finger, and a snow-bright sword light slashed down the bugs. The bugs burst, their fluids splashing onto the ground with a sizzling corrosive sound.

Xu Yunfan took the opportunity to retreat hastily, but he saw that the youth’s wound had already healed as if nothing had happened. The demonic energy around him grew even more intense, and a phantom of a three-headed, six-armed demon god appeared behind him.

*Primordial Manifestation·Asura!*

The demon god’s six arms held a blade, sword, halberd, whip, hammer, and mirror respectively. The moment the mirror shone upon Xu Yunfan, he felt his soul crushed by a thousand-ton weight, and his movements slowed by half a beat.

The youth seized the opportunity to close in, his demonic blade slashing horizontally toward Xu Yunfan’s neck!

*Clang!*

Sparks flew from the dragon-scale armor’s neck guard. Xu Yunfan was sent flying more than ten zhang by the tremendous force, his throat sweet as he spat out a mouthful of blood.

The youth was about to pursue his attack, but Yu Congling had already drawn a talisman in mid-air. Countless white bone arms rose from the blood sea, tightly gripping the demon god’s legs. She bit the tip of her finger and used her blood as ink to write an ancient sword seal in the void.

“Heavenly Sword, Execute the Demon!”

Spiritual energy from heaven and earth gathered frantically, transforming into a hundred-zhang-long crystalline sword shadow, its blade entwined with purple lightning as fine as hair. This was the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s sect-suppressing ultimate technique, specifically designed to sever souls and spirits. Every disciple of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, besides their护身 flying swords, also cultivated a life-bound flying sword—one that slays the spirit, not the body!

Fear finally appeared on the youth’s face. He bit off the tip of his tongue and spat out a mouthful of essence blood. As the blood mist exploded, the youth’s figure blurred, intending to escape from this sea of consciousness. If he could get out, he could still make other plans. If he stayed here, he would most likely be trapped to death.

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate for a moment. This sea of consciousness was his home ground, allowing him to manifest many phenomena. He spread his fingers and clenched his fist, and as his force burst forth, the dragon-scale plates fluttered. Golden threads emerged from the gaps, glowing with golden light.

The golden light formed a net that enveloped the blood mist, forcibly interrupting the youth’s escape technique.

The youth stumbled back into view. Before he could even steady himself, Xu Yunfan was already behind him like a ghost. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace was wrapped in blood-colored sword energy—he had secretly operated the Three Foci Sword Nurturing Technique he had stolen from Pei Yan!

The mace tip rotated like a drill for a thrust. The youth’s护体 demonic energy shattered like paper. The moment the mace tip pierced into his back heart, Xu Yunfan let out a furious roar, and his entire body’s blood and energy poured into the mace. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace actually transformed into a fire dragon, bursting out from the youth’s chest!

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow.

*Is this really a Daoist cultivator?*

*So fragile?*

“Ahhhhh!”

The youth’s soul was torn and burned by the fire dragon, letting out a piercing scream.

Yu Congling’s sword finger guided the execution sword shadow, which slashed down from the air and completely shattered his spirit!

*You have successfully killed a Daoist cultivator. Your proficiency in the Three Foci Sword Nurturing Technique has greatly increased.*

*Your Three Foci Sword Nurturing Technique has reached Small Completion.*

*Your Three Foci Sword Nurturing Technique has entered Great Completion.*

*Your Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Technique has been initiated.*

*...*

After instantly killing Jiang Xu, the attribute panel in Xu Yunfan’s vision flashed with notifications almost simultaneously. The Three Foci Sword Nurturing Technique advanced three realms in a row, reaching Great Completion, and even instantly triggered the initiation of the Void Clearing Sword Cleansing Technique.

He raised his head to look at the Heavenly Sword Pavilion’s Yu Congling, who was staring right at him.
