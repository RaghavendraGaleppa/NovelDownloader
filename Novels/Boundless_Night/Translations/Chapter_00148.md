**Chapter 148: The Harvest Season**

"Three elder brothers, you've been observing for quite some time, you must have assessed his strength. Can we make our move now?" The Fire Kylin Lion spoke, its body riddled with multiple fractures, looking incredibly pathetic.

The three experts were cautious, only willing to act after confirming their opponent's condition. If the situation proved insurmountable, they would simply retreat from the back mountain.

The Fire Kylin Lion had paid a hefty price for this, engaging in a fierce battle with the human youth, allowing its allies to observe and study him.

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming cooperated perfectly, a wisp of lightning appearing around his body, followed by three quick shivers.

In the pitch-black night sky, silver serpents of lightning danced wildly, and torrential rain poured down, filling the mountain with an aura of grim determination.

The three experts slowly approached, exuding a palpable sense of oppression!

"Where is the mystic medicine?" The human man asked, his voice hoarse, wearing a bronze mask, and carrying a heavy sword on his back.

As he spoke, he inadvertently glanced at the Fire Kylin Lion.

The great lion was startled, thinking to itself, *Why are you looking at me?*

Then, it suddenly realized, almost losing its temper!

But a drum also beat in its heart, *Surely, our boss isn't planning to treat *me* as the mystic medicine, right?*

"Third Brother, go fetch the mystic blood from my quiet chamber!" The Black Roc commanded. It had invited five helpers in total, but only three had appeared, and they were late.

The old donkey rushed into a distant building and soon returned with a flawless, pure crystal containing a liquid that glowed with an intense dark light, appearing quite extraordinary.

"Alright!" The three-meter-tall large hedgehog nodded. It walked upright on its short stubby legs, its body covered in silvery sharp quills.

The Black Roc's heart bled. This was a portion of mystic blood it had exchanged with an elder of its clan, exhausting its entire fortune!

Earlier, it had never intended to offer this medicine, hoping to swiftly deal with the human youth itself. But now, the worst-case scenario had unfolded!

"Sigh, if only it were Golden-Winged Roc blood, that would be truly marvelous." A two-meter-long exotic bird spoke. Its crest feathers were yellow, like flickering golden flames, its back crimson, its belly purple, and its tail feathers, three meters long, flowed with a brilliant azure glow, making it stunningly beautiful. This was the Brocade Bird.

The Black Roc was extremely displeased. *Am I not a Roc just because I'm black?* It seemed... yes, there was indeed quite a difference.

Qin Ming looked at the colorful Brocade Bird. It possessed significant spiritual essence and likely had mystic blood of its own!

"This young man is quite good, with an almost immortal aura. Don't kill him," the large hedgehog suggested.

The other old demons were puzzled and all looked at it.

Qin Ming was also surprised, thinking this hedgehog had a rather broad perspective.

The large hedgehog continued, "A youth this ethereal and refined would be most suitable to help me wash my back and brush my silver quills every day after he's crippled."

The old demons immediately understood. The large hedgehog wanted to keep him alive to adorn its "facade."

Qin Ming, for his part, felt it was necessary to pull out its silver quills one by one and "scrub its back" with his mutton-fat jade iron blade!

The masked man spoke, "Everyone, he only recently absorbed a portion of silver mystic blood. If we refine him quickly, we might still extract some of its medicinal properties."

Qin Ming's gaze turned cold. Sometimes, fellow humans were far more terrifying than demons. This man was truly detestable.

The Brocade Bird nodded and said, "Later, I'll sample a bit of his heart blood to see how much medicinal essence remains."

"Please, three elder brothers, finish this quickly!" The Fire Kylin Lion urged, eager to see that terrifyingly fast-growing youth slain immediately.

The Black Roc also nodded, "Three elder brothers, you've stumbled upon an easy mark. This fiend, like me, was struck by lightning and doesn't have much fighting strength left."

"Attack!"

It was the masked human again. He drew the heavy sword from his back and was the first to charge forward.

The Brocade Bird soared into the night sky like a phoenix dancing among the heavens, hovering aloft and radiating four-colored iridescent light, possessing the distinct aura of a divine bird.

The silver large hedgehog produced a silver bow carved with cloud patterns. Despite its short limbs, it was surprisingly an archer!

In an instant, its small arms swelled and elongated, allowing it to draw the bowstring. It plucked one of its own silver quills and used it as an arrow.

Boom!

The arrow shot forth with the force of wind and thunder, carrying a dazzling silver light, like a burning meteor with a long tail, instantly vaporizing the rain curtain.

The large hedgehog was truly a master archer among unusual beings!

Qin Ming's heart skipped a beat. He quickly tilted his head, and the silver arrow whizzed past his ear, rustling his hair, accompanied by an exceptionally hot blast of air.

Behind him, a building constructed of black-gold stone instantly exploded, utterly destroyed by that single arrow.

The masked man took a step, already before Qin Ming, his heavy sword descending like a bolt of lightning, unleashing a captivating sword glow.

Qin Ming didn't conjure his blade; he wasn't proficient enough yet, and he sensed that his opponent's Heavenly Radiance Force was formidable.

Blade light, like a long rainbow tearing through the sky, collided with the heavy sword, sparks flying everywhere. In a single breath, their blade and sword clashed dozens of times in the dark rain.

The man's Heavenly Radiance Force was indeed very special: powerful, fierce, and accompanied by a scorching blast of air, far beyond what ordinary Outer Saints could achieve!

He could directly clash blades and swords with Qin Ming, confronting him head-on.

Of course, this was also largely due to his profound cultivation. After all, he was an Outer Saint who had been in this realm for many years.

The man's heavy sword developed a chip; its hardness was inferior to mutton-fat jade iron. But he felt no pain, for as long as he killed this youth, he could acquire an even better jade-iron sword.

In the sky, iridescent light shone in all directions as the Brocade Bird flapped its wings, its aura potent, emitting a high-pitched cry. Then, four massive beams of golden, crimson, blue, and purple light shot out, covering the sky and earth.

The masked man quickly retreated, almost furious. This fierce bird was attacking indiscriminately!

The four-colored light slammed into the mountain peak, the ground cracking open, rocks tumbling. A large amount of dust that had just risen was immediately doused by the heavy rain.

"Watch it!" The man yelled at the sky, his sword held ready.

"Next time!" the Brocade Bird replied.

The large hedgehog launched its assault, firing a volley of arrows, silver streaks tearing through the night sky, completely locking down Qin Ming's escape routes and forcing him to constantly swing his blade to deflect them.

In mid-air, the Brocade Bird unleashed iridescent light like a torrent, with beams of golden, crimson, cyan, and purple light interweaving and falling like a waterfall.

The masked man seized his chance, and soon after, attacked again!

In an instant, the heavy sword in his hand raged like flowing fire, as if trying to ignite the night sky, its brilliant sword light continuously tearing through the rain curtain, truly terrifying.

All three experts cautiously watched the silver blade in Qin Ming's hand, fearing he would call down lightning again.

Whenever they saw him raise his blade, the three beings would rapidly retreat, giving him no opportunity, hoping to see him strike himself with lightning.

Primarily, Qin Ming's cultivation realm wasn't high enough. Even with today's extreme weather, he couldn't instantly summon lightning.

Green mist surged before Qin Ming, forming a Verdant Wood Shield. Although it was repeatedly shattered by the dazzling silver light beams, it still managed to alter the trajectories of the arrows.

Close to him, the masked man's heavy sword continuously sliced through the void, stirring up raging flames, his offensive growing increasingly fierce.

Under these circumstances, Qin Ming kept his gaze fixed on the mid-air, pondering how to effectively inflict damage on the Brocade Bird.

If the winged exotic bird were to spread its wings and fly away, he truly wouldn't be able to stop it.

Subsequently, he feigned exhaustion, retreating continuously while parrying the heavy sword. And when facing the large hedgehog's arrows, he encountered danger multiple times, almost being struck.

Only against the attacks from the sky did he appear unconcerned, actively charging towards them each time, enduring the four-colored iridescent light to evade the heavy sword and the large hedgehog's arrows.

"Brocade Bird, are you holding back?" the large hedgehog complained.

The masked man also glanced at the mid-air.

The inherently proud Brocade Bird felt insulted. This human youth feared the other two, treating its attacks as a "safe haven"? Unacceptable!

It descended, becoming even more ferocious, continuously unleashing four-colored light. Its body seemed to ignite, and its high-pitched bird cry shook the entire area.

Qin Ming fought and retreated, then leaped onto a building, and then suddenly shot into the night sky, charging towards the Brocade Bird.

After his mutton-fat jade iron blade touched its feathers, he instantly changed his force technique to the Adhesive Force, pulling on its tail feathers, dragging it downwards.

Terrifying arrows shot forth, making Qin Ming a living target in mid-air. However, he remained unafraid. He unleashed his Golden Silkworm Force, wisps of golden light dancing around his body, as if distorting space, changing the direction of all the incoming arrows.

This scene made the large hedgehog suck in a breath of night mist.

The Brocade Bird was enraged, its cry shaking the heavens. Like a phoenix emerging, incinerating the darkness, it flapped its wings towards the high sky, four of its tail feathers ripped off, leaving behind a trail of blood.

Qin Ming regretted not being able to capture it.

After landing, he sliced off the blood-stained tail feathers, keeping only a small, clean, and vibrant portion, which he tucked into his hair, intentionally to further enrage the Brocade Bird.

"So weak," he said, looking up at the night sky and shaking his head.

The masked man attacked, the flames on his heavy sword illuminating the mountain.

The large hedgehog saw Qin Ming change his force technique, golden threads appearing around his body. It also turned ruthless, pulling out several especially thick and long silver quills, which now bore faint patterns.

The Brocade Bird also went berserk. After continuously unleashing a dense barrage of iridescent light, it suddenly dove towards the ground.

Its beak, half a meter long, was like a sharp sword, radiating four-colored light. All of its demonic qi and Heavenly Radiance Force converged there, like a Celestial Being from Beyond, diving down from high altitude.

This was its strongest attack, rarely displayed. If unleashed, it was certain to "cleave" and kill its opponent, never having failed before.

In the distance, the Black Roc's pupils contracted. Even it felt a chill; it couldn't block that attack even at its peak!

Before the Brocade Bird struck, it intentionally unleashed a sky full of iridescent light to conceal its true form, hiding behind it and following closely.

Qin Ming sensed something, aware of the danger, and caught a glimpse of the Brocade Bird's faint silhouette.

Instead of fear, he felt delight. His Heavenly Radiance Force suddenly intensified, becoming different. His four mystic arts and twenty-seven types of Heavenly Radiance Force merged into one!

The Brocade Bird's "Celestial Flight Attack" had always been infallible, slaying countless opponents since its debut.

Moreover, it was a surprise attack. It appeared from behind the iridescent light, its beak dazzling, stabbing towards the human youth's crown.

In its mind, once the "Immortal Sword" was unleashed, the battle should be over!

However, as it drew closer, it discovered that the youth's aura had completely changed. His entire being surged with vigorous power, instantly becoming incomparably sacred, as if standing within a blazing sun. All around him, Heavenly Radiance Force surged, dazzling beyond compare.

Qin Ming grabbed its beak with his bare hand. The strongest Heavenly Radiance Force, now merged into one, vibrated, and with a *crack*, he broke its long beak.

"Ah..." The Brocade Bird shrieked tragically.

Caught by its opponent, it felt a scorching heat like being burned by a blazing sun. Then, the youth struck it with two palms, breaking its wings. After that, it felt intense pain in its legs, which were now fractured.

Qin Ming felt relieved and threw it to the ground.

He stood as if within a golden sun, his Heavenly Radiance Force surging, illuminating all directions. He used his bare hands to confront the masked man who was swinging his sword at him.

It must be said, the man was indeed very strong, clashing with Qin Ming's merged Heavenly Radiance Force multiple times.

With a *snap*, his heavy sword was caught by Qin Ming, then exploded with dazzling light as it was broken.

The man tried to retreat, but Qin Ming blocked him. Amidst the collision of fists and feet, he was sent flying, spitting blood uncontrollably.

The large hedgehog wanted to flee, deeply horrified. This human youth's strength far exceeded its expectations.

"Everyone, if we try to escape separately, we will all die! Right now, our only choice is to fight with everything we've got!" The Black Roc roared.

"He's right!" The masked human man struggled to his feet and charged forward with bare hands.

The Black Roc and the Fire Kylin Lion also dragged their injured bodies forward, fighting without regard for cost.

Even the severely wounded Brocade Bird opened its broken beak, spitting out four-colored iridescent light, joining the fray.

"Alright, let's go all out! Everyone, get clear first!" the large hedgehog shouted.

Its entire body glowed with surging silver light, as if a divine furnace had opened its lid, emitting terrifying radiance.

All its silver quills vibrated simultaneously, then, as it adjusted its direction, they shot out continuously, densely packed, finally detaching from its body and flying towards the human youth, sealing the sky and locking the earth. Arrows were everywhere.

Qin Ming stood still. Heavenly Radiance Force illuminated all around him, and twenty-seven layers of divine rings seemed to envelop his body, layer upon layer, making him appear incomparably sacred.

The dense silver arrows flew in but were blocked by the twenty-seven divine rings, and then utterly pulverized. Large swathes of silver quills exploded outside Qin Ming's body.

The old demons' scalps tingled. That human youth seemed to stand in a brilliant golden pure land, ethereal and refined, yet overwhelmingly powerful.

Qin Ming used his strongest Heavenly Radiance Force to shatter all the silver quills, then strode forward, beginning to display his thunderous methods even as he remained aloof.

The old demons were unwilling to wait for death and charged forward together.

In this area, Heavenly Radiance Force intertwined, iridescent light surged, and sword qi crisscrossed. However, no matter how desperately they fought, it was useless; the tide had turned.

Blood splattered as the old demons were all sent flying, their bodies pierced through, demon blood everywhere. They lay on the ground, unable to fight any longer.

Only the old donkey had not participated in the battle, but it was trembling with fear, not daring to make a move.

Qin Ming stood as if in a dazzling pure land, a smile on his face. The harvest season had arrived. With three types of mystic blood in hand, his foundation and strength would advance even further.
