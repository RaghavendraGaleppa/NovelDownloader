# Chapter 13: Weng Sanqi

"Jiang Li, I really don't want to become a monk. Maybe we should go to Hundred Refinements Mountain instead."

"At least there, magic artifacts and spiritual pills would be much easier to obtain than elsewhere. It would greatly benefit our cultivation."

As Yan Hong said, Hundred Refinements Mountain indeed exported many mid-to-low grade magic artifacts every year. For someone like Yan Hong who enjoyed commerce, having access to first-hand resources was indeed very tempting.

However, when Jiang Li looked at the list of Hundred Refinements Mountain's high-ranking members, he frowned.

Sect Leader Situ Fengzhu, Second Elder Situ Tingxin, Artifact Refining Elder Situ Baige, External Affairs Elder Situ Etong...

First Elder Ma Liuqi, Third Elder Ma Lichou, Alchemy Elder Ma Minglou, Herbal Medicine Elder Ma Changgu...

The register recorded many high-ranking elders with various titles and positions, but without exception, they all shared one of these two surnames.

It was worth noting that Hundred Refinements Mountain had existed for over five hundred years, yet in all that time, not a single disciple with a different surname had managed to rise to prominence.

Unless they had some strange rule requiring name changes upon promotion, it was clear how difficult it would be to advance and gain benefits in such a family-run sect. Even the indestructible Calabash Brothers couldn't withstand the torment of unfair treatment—Jiang Li had no interest in wasting his youth in such a sect.

After Jiang Li's explanation, Yan Hong broke out in a cold sweat. He didn't want to work hard his entire life only to have his achievements benefit the sect's "royal relatives."

In such sects, while the treatment might seem good on the surface, if they ever conflicted with members of those two families, fairness would be nothing but a joke.

"It seems we don't have many choices left."

After analyzing the pros and cons of each sect while walking around the venue, the two finally arrived at the entrance of the Scripture Storage Valley's courtyard.

Compared to the other three top-tier sects, Scripture Storage Valley's advantages weren't particularly outstanding, and it even had several significant flaws.

For example, it had been established too recently, lacking deep-rooted traditions. 

Being formed by a coalition of rogue cultivators, its leadership was too diverse. While factionalism wasn't as entrenched as in Hundred Refinements Sect, it certainly existed.

Rumors said that among the rogue cultivators who had joined, some were demonic cultivators, and disciples occasionally died under mysterious circumstances.

In terms of specialization, since its founders were rogue cultivators, their skills were unsystematic—broad but shallow.

Whether it was artifact refining, alchemy, or talisman crafting, they dabbled in everything but excelled at nothing. Compared to the other three sects of the same tier, Scripture Storage Valley seemed rather mediocre.

Nevertheless, Jiang Li and Yan Hong ultimately chose Scripture Storage Valley.

First, in terms of scale, Scripture Storage Valley was indeed part of the Great Heavy Mountain cultivation world's first tier, and it had reached this level in just two hundred years. 

In the cultivation world, two hundred years might not even span a single generation's rise and fall. This meant the sect had great potential—with their generation's efforts, it could surpass the other three sects in the future.

For ambitious young people like them, such a vibrant sect was worth dedicating their lives to.

Well... alright.

That wasn't the main reason.

The real reason was that the Compassionate Voyage Temple's primary cultivation techniques were metal and earth attributes, while Hundred Refinements Mountain's were fire attributes.

The Five Elements Peak of Shu Mountain had all five elements, but they weren't interested in Jiang Li and Yan Hong.

Jiang Li had dual yin-wood spiritual roots, and Yan Hong had a water spiritual root, so they didn't really have a choice. Only Scripture Storage Valley, with its rumored vast collection of scriptures, could provide them with the most suitable cultivation techniques.

Entering Scripture Storage Valley's courtyard, they found it much emptier now. Others hadn't deliberated as much as they had and had already chosen their sects. 

Cultivators worked efficiently, and disciple registration and contract signing didn't take long.

Inside, they saw twenty carved long tables, behind which stood not people but twenty wooden puppets dressed in robes, their expressions eerily lifelike.

"Hehehe... more newcomers."

The previously motionless puppets suddenly came to life, their joints creaking as they moved. Each moved differently, and some even opened their mouths to speak.

A few subordinates behind Jiang Li and Yan Hong turned to flee in fright, but the two quickly stopped them with well-placed kicks.

They then bowed toward the puppets and apologized.

"Apologies, Elder."

Their followers, belatedly realizing their mistake, quickly followed suit.

"Haha, no worries, no worries. You're not the first disciples to be startled."

One puppet with a laughing expression waved its hand, its movements almost indistinguishable from a real person's.

"Let me introduce myself. I am the Scripture Storage Valley's Odd Arts Hall Elder. You may call me Weng Sanqi."

Another puppet with a stern expression began speaking.

"Elder Weng Sanqi!"

They bowed again, though with twenty puppets moving around, they weren't sure which direction to face.

"You're here to join Scripture Storage Valley, correct?"

The puppets beckoned them closer.

"Scripture Storage Valley is one of the Great Heavy Mountain's finest sects. According to sect rules, after joining, you may freely choose a basic cultivation technique to study."

"Each week, sect elders will hold public lectures. Resources will be distributed monthly to aid your cultivation... Additionally, you can exchange spirit stones and sect contribution points for techniques, spells, pills, magic artifacts..."

As the wooden puppets chattered, Jiang Li noticed that most basic benefits were similar across sects. 

However, Weng Sanqi repeatedly emphasized the freedom to choose techniques and spells, clearly confident in the sect's library.

"I understand, Elder Weng Sanqi. May I ask what our responsibilities will be after joining?"

Jiang Li knew that rights came with obligations. High-level cultivators could live for centuries—their willingness to pass down knowledge was far less than that of mortals who lived mere decades.

Even if they did pass down knowledge, it wouldn't be to disciples with their level of spiritual roots.

"Joining the sect is free. In your first year, you'll only need to focus on cultivation—no mandatory tasks."

"However, after one year, all outer sect disciples must begin accepting sect missions. Of course, missions vary in difficulty. Even if your strength is lacking, you can take on laborious tasks. Rest assured."

Here, Scripture Storage Valley's history as a rogue cultivator alliance showed—it seemed somewhat stingy in early investment. 

Other sects typically gave new disciples two to three years before assigning missions. One year might not even be enough for those with inferior spiritual roots to take their first step in cultivation.

Jiang Li and Yan Hong exchanged glances before the former spoke.

"Elder Weng Sanqi, we wish to join Scripture Storage Valley!"

The puppets all looked at him.

"Already gathering followers before even joining? You're quite impressive. That will serve you well in the outer sect."

"Don't just stand there. Come fill out your information and sign the contracts."

With twenty-one people and twenty puppets, there was no need to queue. They picked up two sheets of paper and began writing.

This cultivation world placed great importance on karma and fate, so they were particularly thorough in recording disciples' backgrounds.

Where do you live? What's your name? How many family members do you have? What do they do? Are you married? Any children? Have you killed anyone? Started any fires? Were the victims male or female? Were the fires big or small?

If Jiang Li's memory were better, he might have been asked to list eighteen generations of his family tree...

In any case, Jiang Li filled in what he could and marked "none" for the rest. After carefully reviewing the sect contract's terms, he signed his name.

"Oh? Dual spiritual roots? Not bad, not bad. You've made the right choice joining Scripture Storage Valley."

Jiang Li looked puzzled—was there some significance to this?

"Please enlighten me, Elder."

After submitting his spiritual root token, Jiang Li entered the courtyard's inner area and finally met the elder who had been controlling the puppets—Weng Sanqi.

"Hehe, boy, do you know the difference between dual and single spiritual roots?"

Weng Sanqi was rather short, even compared to their thirteen- or fourteen-year-old group. His hair was streaked with gray, but his face was ruddy and showed no signs of age. He held a large wine jar, taking frequent sips as he spoke.

Instead of answering directly, he posed this question.

"Disciples with dual spiritual roots can easily master two types of elemental spells, giving them more versatility and combat strength."

After learning about his spiritual roots, Jiang Li had inquired about this but only received fragmented information. He could only share what he knew.

"Correct, but incomplete. Dual-element spells can adapt to more situations, giving an advantage in combat."

"But remember—wood-attribute techniques only enhance wood-attribute cultivation, and yin-attribute techniques only enhance yin-attribute cultivation."

"If you cultivate both simultaneously, your progress will inevitably slow, making you far inferior to single-attribute cultivators. That's why many dual-spiritual-root cultivators abandon one and focus solely on the other."

Jiang Li thought it over—that made sense. But since Weng Sanqi brought it up, there must be a solution. Settling his nerves, he waited for the elder to continue.

"Please teach me, Elder!"
