Chapter 106: Covering Retreat

"Mingye!?" Anduin roared, flames surging, his voice filled with disbelief.

Zhou Tian raised an eyebrow. Mingye? Anduin knew this guy?

"Anduin, return to my Lord. My Lord will purify the evil bloodline within you!" Mingye spoke, her voice seeming to come from beyond the heavens, ethereal and sacred. Her wings behind her trembled slightly, unleashing streams of holy light.

"Evil bloodline?" Anduin seemed to be provoked, his enormous body trembling incessantly, radiating ring after ring of fire.

Mingye gently waved a hand, and endless radiance spread forth. Wherever the fiery glow reached, the flames were extinguished.

"Who exactly are you? What is your relationship with the Holy Church Pope? Was it you or the Holy Church Pope back then?!" Anduin demanded, his voice like rolling thunder, deafening, due to his immense size.

Zhou Tian's eyes lit up. There was a story here, he mused.

Mingye's eyes were exceptionally clear. Hearing Anduin's words, she remained silent. She wasn't foolish enough to answer every question.

"Rage of Burning Heaven!" Anduin seemed furious at her demeanor. The half-spearhead embedded in his forehead glowed with intense crimson light, and profound, mysterious runes constantly emerged.

Anduin's ancient demon god body, which he had transformed into, expanded further. The patterns on his body shone brightly, and waves of fiery storms erupted, each hundreds of meters high, covering a vast area and cracking the ground.

Zhou Tian continuously dodged, moving away from the area. It would be quite a joke if he got killed by his ally.

The fiery storms were area-of-effect skills, causing immense destruction to Celer City.

Mingye's brows furrowed slightly. The light of the entire world dimmed. She spread her hands, and holy light diffused from her, as if she had become the sun of this entire world.

A humanoid void figure, composed purely of light, appeared behind her. All physical details were blurred, save for a pair of enormous, lifelike wings. Every feather, every pattern on them, was clearly visible.

The sacred wings vibrated, and the world seemed to be enveloped in light, a vast expanse of white. All the fiery tornadoes were extinguished.

When the light receded, Anduin's colossal body was covered in wounds. Through the injuries, one could see that deep within his body, there was not flesh and blood, but streams of fiery orange magma flowing down. The giant gasped for breath, feeling his condition was extremely poor.

His own divine blood was scarce, and his ability to activate it to transform into the Lord of Ashes' form was entirely dependent on the divine power of the Spear of Ashes. Now, he was struggling to maintain it.

He turned to look at the congregants battling relentlessly with the Holy Church. Mingye's appearance had truly caught him off guard. His imprisonment in the Holy Church's Inquisition had countless ties to Mingye, and the power Mingye displayed was no less than his current state.

Gritting his teeth, Anduin roared, his body bursting into intense flames once more, and the wounds on his physique healed.

The Spear of Ashes' tip above his head shone brightly. Streaks of bloody light floated from Anduin's head into the spearhead, which trembled ceaselessly. Anduin's transformed demon god body gradually shrank, all its energy being drawn back.

The Spear of Ashes re-formed its shaft using energy, and thin streams of blood containing golden matter connected from Anduin's body to the Spear of Ashes.

A phantom of the Lord of Ashes appeared behind the Spear of Ashes, its enormous body nearly obscuring the entirety of Celer City.

The Lord of Ashes gripped the Spear of Ashes, just as it had in ancient times when it traversed the divine realm. Its body gradually solidified, its eyes ancient and profound.

"I shall eventually return!" A string of ancient words emanated from the Lord of Ashes' mouth. Although unintelligible, the meaning clearly appeared in everyone's mind.

Everyone was stunned, including Anduin himself, for he had merely sacrificed his divine blood to activate the remnant divine power in the artifact, summoning a projection of the Lord of Ashes. What the Lord of Ashes' phantom had just said was completely unexpected. His eyes flickered, as if contemplating something.

After uttering those words, the Lord of Ashes' phantom's eyes became hollow and vacant again, as if what had just happened was merely an illusion.

The Spear of Ashes thrust forward, firmly locking onto Mingye. This was a strike from the Lord of Ashes, and even as a phantom, it was not to be underestimated. Where the spear's tip passed, space shattered, and the crimson light seemed to tear the heavens.

Mingye's expression grew solemn, whether because of the Lord of Ashes' words or this attack. Light emanated from the church ceiling. The frescoes inscribed upon it seemed to come alive, flying off the walls one by one and circling around Mingye.

As soon as the Spear of Ashes thrust out, Anduin flashed beside Zhou Tian.

"Go, hurry and leave here! The Holy Church has far more hidden cards than I imagined. I sacrificed my divine blood to cast a forbidden art, drawing upon the residual divine power within the divine artifact to summon a projection of the Lord of Ashes. This can hold them off for a moment." Anduin's face was extremely pale, his eye sockets sunken, as if all energy had been completely drained from him.

Zhou Tian glanced at Mingye in the air. At this moment, she was surrounded by countless sacred beings. Although the Spear of Ashes destroyed countless holy lights, it also encountered resistance, as if it had fallen into a swamp, advancing very slowly.

"You go help my friends, I'll help your people!" Zhou Tian said. His main goal was still to rescue Zhang Yi and Musu. Continuing here had no further meaning.

Zhang Yi and Musu were also aware of the current situation. They had been fighting and retreating, gradually approaching the Ash Cultists. Although the Holy Church's experts were concentrated there, the Ash Cultists were also numerous. It was better than fighting alone.

Musu was covered in wounds, while Zhang Yi was in better shape, but still quite battered.

Zhou Tian pointed his finger, and a gigantic holy hammer appeared, smashing towards the team that had been pursuing the two. This was an attack from the Holy Church Pope that he had just stored.

Boom! The earth trembled and quaked. A large number of knights were crushed to death, and cracks appeared in the ground, blocking the path. After all, this was the Holy Church Pope's attack; even weakened by 80%, it was not something they could withstand.

Anduin flashed to their side, helping them break through, while Zhou Tian had already appeared at the battleground between the Ash Cultists and the Holy Church members.

This was something he and Anduin had discussed. Anduin was now extremely weakened due to sacrificing his divine blood, and without the boost from the Spear of Ashes, his strength wasn't too great.

"Hey, big guy, come here!" Zhou Tian pointed at Bol and shouted. Currently, Bol's strength should be the strongest; he was fighting two Ash Bishops alone and still held the upper hand.

Bol's expression darkened, but he didn't respond, merely dealing with the two in front of him.

Zhou Tian directly flashed into the battlefield, enduring Bol's slash with his physical body. He then vertically chopped with his palm, deflecting Bol's attack back at him.

Bol parried with his sword, retreating several meters. His sword hummed incessantly.

"Go help your God Son!" Zhou Tian said, looking back.

The two bishops exchanged glances, nodded, and headed towards Anduin.

Bol tried to pursue, but Zhou Tian flashed to block his path. He didn't know Zhou Tian's abilities, so he didn't dare to act rashly.

Zhou Tian was happy with this. He just needed to hold Bol back for now. He only had 13 stored attacks left. If Bol got serious, it would only be a matter of seconds, and then things would get tricky.

With Zhou Tian joining, the situation instantly improved. Saman led the Ash Cultists against the remaining enemies, while the two bishops helped Anduin break through.

Mingye, trapped by the Spear of Ashes, couldn't make any rash moves either. She felt somewhat anxious. If she hadn't received a divine decree not long ago to attack those who fell from the sky, using up many of her trump cards, today wouldn't have been so difficult.

With the help of the two bishops, Anduin, Zhang Yi, and Musu quickly retreated.

"You all go first! I'll cover your retreat!" Seeing everyone gathered, Zhou Tian waved his hand grandly, speaking with a heroic spirit.

This was no time for emotional lingering. Everyone hesitated not, and rushed out towards Celer City.

"Get out of the way!" Bol raged, holy light dazzling, sword energy surging, fiercely sharp. Zhou Tian caught it with his hand, then turned and threw it back into the enemy ranks, causing them a good deal of trouble.
