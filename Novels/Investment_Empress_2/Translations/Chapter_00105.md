# Chapter 105: The Golden Crow Contemplation Diagram, Capable of Manifesting the Scene of Nine Suns in the Sky

Li Mo’s currently most powerful move was calling for help.

The Judge and the Earthly Evil Assassin did not die peacefully.

Shang Wu was currently very angry.

She already had a temper when waking up, and she had just been dreaming of falling into a golden mountain when she was woken up.

*Thud—*

The Judge stiffly turned his head, only to see the tall, palace-robed woman behind him looking down at him. In her almond-shaped eyes, red flames tinged with white flickered and died.

He smelled the charred scent coming from his own body. He found it difficult to breathe, his mouth dry and parched.

“Good Hero, actually, I am...”

“Heh...”

Shang Wu curled her lips.

“Who gives a damn who you are.”

*Bam—*

With a single punch, the Judge visibly shrank by half a head, his skull smashed into his chest.

Seeing the situation turn bad, the black-robed man unleashed thousands of resentful spirits, resembling the opening of hell, while his own figure rapidly retreated.

The surging black tide had not yet touched the palace-robed woman before it was evaporated into nothingness.

“Hmph, trying to flee?!”

Shang Wu glanced at the fainted little children and leaped into the air.

A light of flames mixed with white aura radiated from her surroundings. Behind her appeared a lotus flower made of glazed glass. Although the lotus had not yet bloomed, it carried a purifying aura that cleansed all filth in the world, like a new sun dispelling darkness.

The great sun turned into a meteor, illuminating the boundless night.

As she threw a punch.

The lotus petals swayed gently, and a pleasant female voice echoed from within.

It was actually Shang Wu’s voice, yet incredibly peaceful and pure, reverberating among the layers of clouds:

“The phoenix sings, on that high ridge. The parasol tree grows, facing the morning sun.”

The firelight flared brightly, and the layers of clouds shone with brilliance.

Wherever Shang Wu passed, the resentful spirits were burned of their blackness, leaving behind only the purest spiritual essence, returning to heaven and earth.

Zuoqiu Yang swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

This woman spent her days drunk, loitering around the hotpot shop.

Was she this fierce when she出手 (made a move)?

Anyone who wasn't blind could see that the woman beat that Earthly Evil Assassin as easily as an adult beating a child.

“Boy,” the voice of the Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign suddenly sounded in Xiao Qin’s heart.

“Huh? What is it, Teacher?”

“What is your Shijie’s surname again?”

“Surname Shang, like the Shang Dynasty.”

“Surname Shang... Nanning Li Fire... but she is clearly only this age...”

The Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign’s voice carried contemplation and confusion, leaving Xiao Qin completely baffled.

*Pa!*

Suddenly, the firelight completely burned away the black tide.

That jade-like pink fist struck the black-robed man, instantly setting him ablaze and exploding him into a rain of fire.

No matter how bad the bad guy is, the fireworks look just as beautiful when they explode. — Li Mo.

He shaded his eyes with his hand, watching the fireworks explode.

Hmm.

The Master is only ever reliable in one aspect: fighting...

Jiang Chulong had just barely recovered her wits.

She didn't know what had happened.

She only knew that a bad guy suddenly appeared to capture her, Aunt Mei suddenly appeared to protect her.

Then Big Brother Li arrived, and he called over a fierce big sister...

She should be safe now, right?

“Aunt Mei, are... are you okay?”

Seeing the beautiful middle-aged woman standing unsteadily, Jiang Chulong quickly supported her.

The woman called Aunt Mei was currently very weak in breath.

She shook her head slightly, trying to put on a calm smile.

“I am fine.”

As she spoke, her eyes fell on the ring Jiang Chulong was wearing on her hand, then looked at the young man not far away. Her gaze was filled with confusion and deep thought.

Their eyes happened to meet.

Hmm, Student Li Mo happened to be looking at her, and he even used the Eyes of Destiny.

[Name: Mei Yun]
[Age: 39]
[Bone Constitution: Shocking Sword Body.]
---
[Realm: Inner Scene Ninth Heaven.]
[Fate: Blue]
[Evaluation: Originally one of the Four Sword Servants of the Heavenly Sword Manor’s Mystic Maiden. Originally at the Outer Scene Realm. Left the sect after self-destructing the Heavenly Sword Manor’s ultimate technique.]
[Recent Events: Escaped from the Patrol Sky Guards, returned to Ziyang Prefecture City, secretly guarding the Master’s only bloodline. Currently injured, Inner Scene almost exhausted.]

This was the person he sensed protecting Jiang Chulong last time.

At the time, he was a bit puzzled why an Inner Scene expert would be detectable by him.

It turned out she was injured.

“Senior, your injuries are still quite severe.”

“You should find this useful.”

He flipped his hand, and a bottle of pills appeared in his palm. Even through the jade bottle, one could feel the rich vitality inside.

Five Elements Purple Spirit Pill.

“Thank you.”

The beautiful middle-aged woman fell silent for a moment, her eyes flashing, and finally took the medicine.

“Chulong has been troubling you these past few days. The Heavenly Sword Manor will surely repay you in the future.”

“You are too kind. I simply get along well with Chulong.”

Li Mo nodded slightly.

[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Mei Yun', helping her recover from her injuries.]
[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Jiang Chulong', preventing her from being abducted by the Drizzle Building.]
[There are two investment feedback rewards. Would you like to claim them now?]

You see, fate has arrived.

“No.”

Li Mo silently recited in his heart. Now was not the time to check the rewards.

Because不知何时 (who knows when), there were already many figures in the sky, all of whom had powerful auras. Among them were a few familiar faces, such as several elders of the Clear Abyss Sect, and others were Inner Scene experts from other sects.

They were obviously attracted by the commotion of Shang Wu’s attack.

“I don’t need to worry about the matters here anymore.”

Li Mo finally sighed in relief and took a pill to restore his physical strength.

In an instant.

The figures in the sky all landed in the small courtyard.

It was a bit crowded...

“That Earthly Evil Assassin from the Drizzle Building died too cleanly.”

“Elder Shang Wu, you beat him so badly that not even ash remained. Why didn't you show some restraint?”

“Now we can’t even capture a tongue to interrogate.”

“That’s how I do things. If you aren’t convinced, don’t call me down the mountain in the future.”

The atmosphere among the elders of the Clear Abyss Sect was as familiar as ever...

The two Inner Scene experts from the Burning Forest Manor and the Red Whale Gang twitched at the corners of their mouths, unable to get a word in for a moment.

The middle-aged man in a scholar’s robe from the Burning Forest Manor stepped forward, frowning as he stared at the headless corpse of the Judge.

He stepped on the other party's chest, and the head was squeezed out.

“This is... Prefect of Ziyang?”

The elders of the Clear Abyss Sect stopped their argument and stepped forward one after another.

Qian Bufan and the others exchanged glances, seeing the solemnity in each other's eyes.

The Prefect of Ziyang was actually a member of the Drizzle Building. He hid it too deep.

But having hidden himself so painstakingly for so long, why did he personally make a move today?

What exactly was it for?

The Inner Scene experts turned their gazes toward Mei Yun.

For a moment, the scene was somewhat quiet.

“Uh.”

Li Mo spoke up, breaking the silence.

“Your disciple is not talented, but I have opened a hotpot shop. Would you like the Elders to discuss this while eating?”

Everyone: “.......”

........

Back at the hotpot shop.

Li Mo didn't bother with how the elders handled the aftermath of this matter and returned to his room.

Lying on the bed, his heart moved.

“Claim.”

[Claim successful.]
[Reward 1: Green Wood Vitality Liquid.]
[Reward 2: Golden Crow Solar Transformation Contemplation Diagram.]

[Green Wood Vitality Liquid]: “One drop can revive the dead, regrow flesh and bone, make stone bloom, and contains vigorous vitality.”
[Golden Crow Solar Transformation Contemplation Diagram]: “It depicts the scene of the True Spirit Golden Crow soaring, containing infinite mysteries. By using this to contemplate the divine, one can manifest the scene of nine suns in the sky!”
