Chapter 198: Unleashing True Power

For martial artists who have achieved perfection in two of the three disciplines—sinew, bone, and skin—upon breaking through to the Muscle Refining Realm, the power they unleash is truly astonishing. The top sects have already set a standard for this.

They can suppress those of the same realm and even fight against Blood Transformation Realm experts without being defeated.

Naturally, Xu Yunfan did not reveal that he had perfected all three disciplines. Only his master knew. Even when he went to the Xuanzhen Sect, he deliberately concealed his strength and held back significantly during his sparring with Su Zhenhe.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but say, "Your master isn't dead yet. The message from the Giant Eagle Team yesterday said that Fu Jin has already entered the borders of Qingzhou. However, due to the obstruction of the Great Qian army, he has been lingering in Eagle Sorrow Gorge with a group of wandering martial artists."

Speaking of this, Xu Yunfan found it somewhat amusing. A man in his fifties or sixties was actually running around with those wandering heroes, constantly looking for opportunities to ambush the Great Qian's transport teams on the Qingzhou highways.

Fu Li nodded repeatedly, wiping his face, his expression excited. "I will immediately inform all the departments of your breakthrough."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and called out to stop Fu Li.

"Keep this to yourself. Don't tell anyone. Just keep everything as it is."

Fu Li was puzzled, but since Xu Yunfan had said so, he must have his own plans. Fu Li agreed immediately and simply went to the Heavenly Craft Department to ask the engineering brothers to come and repair the courtyard.

*Pure Yang One Qi Art: 0/5000 (Great Achievement)*
*Special Effects: Pure Yang Internal Qi Stage 3, Qi Armor Stage 3, Recovery Stage 5, Endless Vitality*

Glancing at the status panel, the state of the Pure Yang One Qi Art in the Skills section was most eye-catching. The last special effect, "Endless Vitality," stood out.

At this moment, the Pure Yang Internal Qi was born from his flesh and blood, yet it continuously merged into the Red Serpent Mountain Crushing Strength, constantly strengthening it.

Although the Pure Yang Internal Qi was born from blood essence, as long as his blood essence was abundant, this consumption was completely manageable.

This Pure Yang One Qi Art was like applying a continuous buff to his cultivation.

It was no wonder that in the current Great Zhou, among the External Three Unions realm techniques, the Dao Sect ranked first. Just this heaven-defying special effect alone could suppress all opponents without equal.

Moreover, this technique seemed capable of advancing further to the Perfection realm.

Xu Yunfan's eyes shone brightly.

"Li Haomiao, I really have to thank you!"

On a mountain peak in the Dao Sect, Li Haomiao, who was slowly practicing his swordplay, suddenly sneezed.

He rubbed his nose, feeling somewhat inexplicable.

"Why did I suddenly sneeze?"

Xu Yunfan did not hesitate at all. He really wanted to test just how powerful he had become, so he naturally needed to go to the back mountain of the Heavenly Craft Cave to find an uninhabited place to test the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Method.

It was too restrictive to practice the hammer method in the courtyard; he had to hold back his strength.

The moment Xu Yunfan stepped into the mountain valley, the hidden force under his feet exploded, sending up waves of earth three zhang high.

When the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was swung round, the sonic boom startled the cold crows in the entire valley. The instant the hammer head struck the giant rock by the stream, the nearly four-hundred-jin Thunderfire Qilin Hammer actually sank the rock half a foot. The gravel bursting from the cracks was turned into fine powder by the Red Serpent Qi energy entwining the hammer handle while still in the air.

Seeing this scene, Xu Yunfan felt a stir, somewhat puzzled. When he had encountered the Incense Fire Cult and fought with Bao Yan before, the opponent's Qi energy was astonishing, but it wasn't as terrifying as his current level.

It was completely beyond the norm for a martial artist.

When the eighteen styles of the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Method were fully displayed, the muscles and sinews trained by the Blacksteel Tempered Body undulated like waves, constantly channeling the rebounding force into the Red Serpent Mountain Crushing Strength activated within his body.

One move, "Splitting the River and Dividing the Sea," couldn't be retracted in time. The hammer wind swept past, snapping a century-old cypress tree, thick enough for ten people to encircle, in half.

What was even more terrifying was that every time the hammer head touched the ground, the rock layers of the valley churned as if alive. Visible ring-shaped shockwaves exploded layer by layer.

By the time the final hammer move was retracted, the stream had already changed its course, flowing chaotically in all directions.

When Xu Yunfan lifted the heavy hammer, the mountain terrain within a hundred zhang had been completely altered.

Xu Yunfan stroked the hammer shaft and sighed inwardly. The eighteen styles of hammer method he had just executed with酣畅淋淋 (thorough enjoyment) had actually consumed thirty percent of the Golden Jade Blood Qi he had nurtured within his flesh and blood.

The loss was quite significant.

Although the Pure Yang Internal Qi was endless, constantly generating internal energy from his blood to replenish the Red Serpent Mountain Crushing Strength, if he were to exert his full power, the consumption would likely be too severe to balance.

*You continuously executed the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Method, mastering all eighteen styles perfectly. Proficiency in the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Method has increased.*

Xu Yunfan glanced at the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Method on the status panel. He had accumulated nearly sixty points of proficiency while still in the External Three Unions realm. Now that he had stepped into the Muscle Refining Realm, his progress was naturally rapid.

It wouldn't be long before he reached the Great Achievement stage.

In less than a year, he had crossed four realms and stepped into the Muscle Refining Realm.

If he said this out loud, anyone would find it world-shattering and simply inhuman.

Now, he finally had some self-preservation strength in the martial world.

Xu Yunfan exhaled a breath. Just as he was about to test the隔空劲力 (empty force) of the Red Serpent Mountain Crushing Strength, his eyes moved slightly. He glanced at the sky, arched the sole of his foot, and shot away, skimming the ground.

A few breaths later, a巡游弟子 (patrolling disciple) of the Giant Eagle Team from the Heavenly Craft Cave flew over from afar. He circled above the valley for a long while before finally leaving.

Naturally, a hill that was originally beautiful needed to be reported now that it looked completely different.

However, it would likely just be a case of "no head or tail," resulting in some vigilance before being dropped.

Returning to the courtyard, Xu Yunfan looked at the completely renovated courtyard, the smile that had just appeared on his face freezing instantly.

He stepped forward and looked at the brand-new炽火钢桩 (Blazing Fire Steel Piles). A white piece of paper was pasted on top.

On it was drawn a mocking gesture typical of the Great Zhou, signed by the Heavenly Craft Cave's first disciple, Wan Shan.

Xu Yunfan was speechless. It seemed that because he had repeatedly asked the Heavenly Craft Department to make repairs, Wan Shan had come specifically today to cause a fuss. Finding Xu Yunfan absent, he could only express his dissatisfaction this way.

After all, when the Heavenly Craft Fortress was relocated, Xu Yunfan had saved the day many times using his Heavenly Craft forging skills. Even Mo Han of the Mechanism Hall had changed his view of him and wanted to snatch him away from Zhan Yan.

Naturally, many disciples in the Heavenly Craft Department respected him. Every time Xu Yunfan issued a task, many disciples would put down their work and rush over.

This had caused the progress of many research projects to slow down.

That night, after cultivating the Lin Seal, Xu Yunfan glanced at the status panel.

Very good. Today, upon entering the Muscle Refining Realm, his cultivation of the Lin Seal had also increased by two points.

He threw the sweat-soaked linen cloth into the copper basin. The steam rising from the Golden Jade Blood Qi had not yet dissipated, and the sound of the night watchman's clapper had already passed the third watch.

After washing up, Xu Yunfan prepared to lie down. He glanced at the vest woven from the Extreme Dao Remnant, preparing to have a great battle of three hundred rounds in his sleep to see exactly what level his strength had reached.

Suddenly, a frantic knocking came from outside the courtyard gate.

Xu Yunfan sat up in the quilt, unable to help but exhale a breath, frowning as he rubbed his temples.

Coming in the middle of the night with such frantic knocking—could it be good news?

Putting on his外套 (outer coat), Xu Yunfan walked up and opened the courtyard gate. The moment his black outer robe swept over the stone steps, Fu Li's knocking rhythm suddenly became flustered. Xu Yunfan saw Fu Li's somewhat embarrassed face.
