# Chapter 67: The Greater Picture

Zhou Qing had mastered the Five Organs Thunder Resonance technique. When activated, the thunderous vibrations permeated his internal organs—tiger's roar, deer's cry, bear's growl, crane's call, and monkey's screech—the five thunder resonances cycled continuously, creating an endless, self-renewing rhythm.

The combination of these five resonances formed the "Hei" sound that governed the five organs through the triple energizers, which was actually a crucial element in cultivating Palm Thunder.

Through this thunder resonance tempering his organs, his internal strength gradually increased, benefiting his muscles and bones.

The development of his physique noticeably accelerated.

In truth, he already possessed the strength of a bear and tiger, yet his bones and muscles still hadn't fully matured—something that would be unimaginable for any other martial artist below the Xiantian realm.

This clearly showed how much the Five Organs Thunder Resonance had enhanced his potential.

For practitioners like Zhang Jingxiu, such an opportunity to elevate their potential only came after breaking through to the Xiantian realm. Yet Zhou Qing had achieved it before even reaching Xiantian.

"My Five Organs Thunder Resonance now cycles endlessly. Previously, with just the Tiger's Roar Resonance, I could help Zhi Jing heal his kidney injuries. Now that I've mastered all five resonances, I wonder how much more effective it would be?" Zhou Qing pondered.

Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song had each consumed about one-sixth of the red python's flesh before reaching their limits, unable to digest any more.

The python's flesh also contained spiritual energy—far denser than what was present in Zhou Qing's courtyard.

But the two men couldn't absorb any further. Their bodies were like old, worn-out wooden barrels that could only hold so much water.

"Their limitations stem from aging. Elder Zhang's One Qi Rising Sun Talisman Codex is clearly superior to Elder Brother Fu Song's Great Mountain True Form Talisman Codex in maintaining the 'barrel.' But since my Five Organs Thunder Resonance can repair organs, perhaps it could help them as well?"

"Are you suggesting using the Five Organs Thunder Resonance to strengthen our foundation once more?" Zhang Jingxiu mused after hearing Zhou Qing's unconventional idea.

"Since we're preparing to face the heavenly thunder, there's no harm in trying. I'll go first," the old Daoist quickly decided.

He knew Fu Song's cultivation and realm were inferior to his. If anything went wrong, Fu Song's chances of enduring the heavenly thunder would be even slimmer.

Moreover, the One Qi Rising Sun Talisman Codex excelled at body nourishment. Despite being older than Fu Song, Zhang Jingxiu was in much better condition—so much so that after consuming the python flesh, he could rival Fu Shan's state when the latter faced the heavenly thunder.

"Rest assured, Elder Brother, I'm confident," Zhou Qing said.

He still had three seventh-grade Blood Qi Pills left. If anything went wrong, he could use them to compensate.

Of course, before Zhang Jingxiu faced the heavenly thunder, Zhou Qing planned to give him one of these pills—a way to make up for not sharing the python's inner core.

And if the inner core could eventually be refined into elixirs, Zhou Qing intended to distribute portions to both Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song.

Such small matters didn't need to be voiced aloud.

Among friends, help was given where needed.

Fu Song also understood Zhang Jingxiu's righteousness in volunteering first, knowing that when his turn came, the benefits would be even greater.

Their urgency in facing the heavenly thunder stemmed largely from concerns about their declining vitality and aging.

Delaying further would only erode their determination.

At critical junctures in cultivation, bold and decisive action was necessary to break through barriers.

The difficulty of achieving the Xiantian realm lay in many factors, but none more important than one's willpower—which was why Fu Shan had staked everything on his attempt.

In the end, he had mostly succeeded.

Moreover, Fu Shan's current state—his mind as pure as an infant's, free of distractions—allowed his progress after reaching Xiantian to surpass even his pre-Xiantian speed.

The five thunder resonances—tiger's roar, deer's cry, bear's growl, crane's call, and monkey's screech—cycled endlessly within the alchemy chamber of Qingfu Temple, distantly harmonizing with the thunderous sounds emitted by the mad old Daoist.

This was a natural resonance.

Rather than causing destruction, the two complemented each other.

Under the influence of the thunder resonances, Zhang Jingxiu's breathing grew even more prolonged. His heartbeat slowed further, yet each pulse now efficiently circulated his blood and qi throughout his body, reaching even the tips of his hair.

His internal organs were meticulously permeated and nourished.

Though the One Qi Rising Sun Talisman Codex excelled at body cultivation, even the Taihe Sect's Organ-Tempering Thunder Resonance had areas it couldn't fully penetrate.

Now, with Zhou Qing's mastery of the Five Organs Thunder Resonance supplementing from the outside, though it couldn't match Zhou Qing's own internal strengthening, it still provided Zhang Jingxiu with significant repairs.

For three consecutive days, Zhou Qing didn't stop.

This was a tremendous test of his mental and physical endurance.

With his medical expertise and microscopic perception, he could clearly sense that if this cleansing process were interrupted, a second attempt would yield no further benefits.

The Five Organs Thunder Resonance had already stimulated some of Zhang Jingxiu's latent potential—once released, there would be nothing left to tap into during subsequent attempts.

"The human body is truly profound. Even at this age, there's still potential to uncover," Zhou Qing marveled.

For the next four days, Zhang Jingxiu consumed only water, as if in a legendary state of fasting.

"Old Zhang, your hair has actually darkened a bit," Fu Song remarked in surprise upon seeing Zhang Jingxiu emerge from seclusion.

Zhang Jingxiu nodded at Fu Song, then bowed solemnly to Zhou Qing.

Zhou Qing didn't evade the gesture. Instead, he smilingly handed Zhang Jingxiu a seventh-grade Blood Qi Pill. "With this, Elder Brother should be able to break through to the Xiantian realm after the spring thunder."

The Martial Virtue Department was akin to the imperial secret police, and as the Southern Sky Commander, Gu Fan essentially oversaw surveillance of local affairs in the region as the emperor's enforcer.

"Please, have a seat."

Zhou Qing brewed a pot of tea and poured a cup for Gu Fan.

After taking a sip, Gu Fan set down his cup. "Now that we've had tea, let's discuss business. Scholar Zhou, you must be aware that the assassins used martial arts from the Golden Light Temple. I've long heard that this so-called Buddhist sanctuary is actually a den of vice. I urge you to consider the greater picture—step forward as a witness against the temple, assist me in eradicating this den of evil, confiscate its assets, and restore clarity to Jiangzhou's skies. Moreover, my investigations show you have prior grievances with the Golden Light Temple. I trust you'll cooperate, yes?"

Zhou Qing listened as Gu Fan meticulously laid out his plan to recruit Zhou Qing into his scheme to destroy the Golden Light Temple.

Connecting the dots, Zhou Qing thought: New Year's, slaughtering pigs?

"If Commander Gu already has evidence, why do you need my involvement?"

"I need you to step forward as the accuser—for the greater picture."

Zhou Qing understood Gu Fan's intent perfectly: this was a ploy to drive a tiger to fight a wolf, forcing Zhou Qing into a deadly clash with the Golden Light Temple.

"Is this your idea, Commander Gu? Or does it come from Grand Secretary Shang? Or perhaps his third son?" Zhou Qing suddenly asked.

Gu Fan's expression shifted. "What do you mean by that?"

"Let me make this clear—I am no one's pawn," Zhou Qing stated.

"Scholar Zhou, do you understand what 'the greater picture' means? I represent His Majesty's will here. This year's tax revenue from Southern Sky is still short by one million strings of cash. Do you intend to make up the difference yourself?"

Zhou Qing knew that even destroying the Golden Light Temple wouldn't cover the deficit. Gu Fan's eyes weren't just on the temple—they were also on Zhou Qing after his inevitable bloody conflict with them.

Having just obtained the temple's millennium-old lingzhi mushroom, turning around to testify would force the Golden Light Temple into a fight to the death.

"Where have the Eighteen Tribes of the grasslands advanced to?" Zhou Qing suddenly asked.

Gu Fan's face paled. "How do you know about that?"

"This winter is bitterly cold. If they don't breach the passes, they won't survive. And with the northern provinces plagued by disasters and turmoil, the situation there must already be collapsing. With such dire matters at hand, how could His Majesty spare attention for Jiangzhou? I see now—Commander Gu has personal motives. You're a traitor."

In an instant, Zhou Qing realized the truth: chaos was truly coming.

With such a harsh winter, peace in the north was impossible. This was why men like Gu Fan were so desperate to amass wealth.

Once the capital fell into crisis and imperial authority wavered, figures like Gu Fan would lose their backing. They were scrambling to secure resources for their own survival—undoubtedly with encouragement from the third son of Grand Secretary Shang, whom Zhou Qing had previously offended.

Gu Fan slammed his palm on the stone table, cracking it. "Zhou Qing! Don't think I don't know what you've done in Jiangzhou. The crimes you've committed could see your scholarly rank revoked and land you in prison. If not for the greater picture, do you think I'd be so accommodating?"

Zhou Qing had pieced it together: the northern provinces were already in ruins. Combined with this winter's extreme cold, invasion by the grassland tribes was inevitable.

The absence of war reports from the north only confirmed how dire the situation was—someone was suppressing the news.

He could challenge the Golden Light Temple anytime, but not under coercion into a mutually destructive conflict.

"Brother Zhou, don't act rashly! Consider the greater picture!" The Jiangzhou garrison commander, still intimidated by Gu Fan's authority as Southern Sky Commander, feared Zhou Qing might provoke a confrontation.

Zhou Qing smiled.

"I am considering the greater picture."

The garrison commander sighed in relief.

Gu Fan smirked victoriously—his plan to drive the tiger against the wolf was working. Next, he'd ally with the Sea Sand Gang to devour this young tiger of Jiangzhou.

Zhou Qing paused, then continued: "But I've decided that from today onward, I will be Jiangzhou's greater picture."

Having crossed into this world nearly five years ago and now on the verge of reaching Xiantian, did he not have the right to rule this mere prefecture?

Gu Fan only heard a tiger's roar before his mind went blank. Vital points across his body were struck in rapid succession, leaving him unable to resist.

Zhou Qing drew Gu Fan's saber and pointed it at the garrison commander.

"Commander, you have two choices: either you and Commander Gu had a falling out in my courtyard and killed each other, or you kill him now. Which will it be?"

After a brief hesitation, the garrison commander drew his blade and plunged it into Gu Fan's heart. "Brother Zhou, his men are still outside."

"They won't escape," Zhou Qing said calmly.

With his Shadowless Steps at full power and acute sensory perception, he soon cornered the fleeing subordinate in an alley.

Before Zhou Qing could speak, the man bit down on a poison capsule and died instantly.

Zhou Qing examined the body to determine the martial arts style, then carried it back to inspect the other two assassins' corpses.

In a private room at a tavern:

"Was that assassination attempt targeting me?" Miss Lin asked, shaken.

The three assassins were clearly elite, trained killers skilled with powerful bows. Without Zhou Qing, she likely wouldn't have survived.

"Targeting me," Zhou Qing said, then added, "Even if they were after you, the ultimate target was still me."

"Any clues to their origin?"

"Golden Light Temple martial arts, but likely not sent by the temple. Deliver these three bodies to them and ask—do they want to settle this publicly or privately?"

Though the Golden Light Temple didn't know the full details of the Taihu Lake martial gathering, they clearly understood Zhou Qing's faction included multiple extraordinarily powerful fighters.

Since then, they'd avoided conflict entirely, maintaining a low profile.

Zhou Qing doubted the temple would be foolish enough to send assassins trained in their own techniques. This was clearly a third party's attempt to provoke conflict and profit from the aftermath.

"What's the difference between public and private settlement?"

"Public means I file a complaint with the governor's office, demanding an explanation. Private means they hand over whoever orchestrated this within three days."

Zhou Qing's Treatise on Plagues, revised after returning to Jiangzhou and endorsed by Provincial Administration Commissioner Li Qingzhi, had significantly boosted his scholarly reputation.

If news broke linking his assassination attempt to the Golden Light Temple, it would damage the prospects of the temple's martial arts instructor serving under Song He.

The temple couldn't afford that outcome.

This was an overt, undeniable strategy.

"Then they'll surely choose private settlement," Miss Lin thought but didn't voice, simply resolving to execute Zhou Qing's plan faithfully.

Golden Light Temple:

"Elder Brother, this Zhou brat goes too far! He's just a provincial scholar—how dare he act so arrogantly!" Discipline Hall Chief Zhihai gripped his vajra pestle like an angry guardian deity.

A master of Gang Jin energy, his Vajra Pestle technique was peerless.

Abbot Zhiwen spoke slowly: "Junior Brother, did these three study at our temple?"

Zhihai shook his head. "I know all our lay disciples. These three are unfamiliar."

Zhiwen examined the bodies. "Vajra Finger, Vajra Leg, Vajra Palm—all secret techniques we teach lay disciples. Their skill shows they received authentic transmission."

"We've also submitted these techniques to the court," Zhihai said.

"If Scholar Zhou takes this to the governor, who do you think His Excellency will believe sent the assassins—the court or us?"

Zhihai choked before forcing out, "Us, of course."

"Exactly. So we settle privately."

"How? We don't know who did this!"

Zhiwen remained calm. "The temple still has that millennium-old lingzhi mushroom gifted by the Sea Sand Gang. Such a treasure should suffice as compensation."

"But what about Elder Brother Zhitong? How do we account for him?" Zhihai gnashed his teeth. Zhitong had returned as an empty shell and died shortly after. Zhihai knew Zhou Qing's faction was responsible but lacked proof.

He refused to believe mere lake bandits could have killed Zhitong's group—not with the Black List's Fierce Tiger Daoist present
