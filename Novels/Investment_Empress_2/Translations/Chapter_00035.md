# Chapter 35: Embrace in the Abyss (Part 1)

“Jumping down into the ten-thousand-zhang abyss...”

“They didn’t hesitate in the slightest...”

Yin Huacheng’s mind went blank, his pupils shrinking to pinpricks.

He had seen the ugly faces of many people facing death.

But he had never seen anyone charge towards their own demise without a moment's hesitation.

The Qingyuan below was unfathomably deep, and it was suffused with an incredibly potent pressure. Once they fell, their Qi and blood, internal energy, and even their inner and outer worlds would be suppressed.

Even a Sect Master with the strength of the Outer Scene realm would likely not dare to enter it without preparation.

Two warriors at the Qi and Blood Realm would face a death with no chance of survival.

“Madmen!”

“You two are even madder than me!”

Yin Huacheng punched the ground, a thick wave of regret rising in his heart.

The reason he had dodged that sword strike earlier was precisely because he feared getting injured!

If he were injured, he might reveal a flaw.

But that would still be better than losing out in his attempt to get the upper hand!

This meant that not only had he failed to obtain top-tier cultivation materials, but he had also committed the grave crime of attempting to murder a true disciple!

“The elders will be here soon.”

Yin Huacheng forcefully suppressed the turbulent emotions within him.

He quickly took off his black clothes and threw them, along with the iron mask, into the Qingyuan abyss. Then, he changed into the attire of a true disciple.

After finishing all this, he prepared to send a message to the elders.

However, before he could make a move—

*BOOM!—*

A fiery meteor crashed into the ground just thirty feet from the cliff's edge. The impact sent dust and smoke flying, rocks and sand scattering, creating the illusion that the entire Wangyue Cliff had shaken three times.

The dust settled.

A woman’s fiery red palace gown fluttered wildly, her black hair dancing as if tracing the shape of the wind.

“Where is my disciple?”

Her voice was devoid of its usual drunkenness, sounding almost unfamiliar.

*Gulp—*

Yin Huacheng’s throat was parched by the scorching heat, and not a single word of the excuses he had prepared could escape his lips.

“I... I just arrived as well.”

“Shang Wu, let's talk this through calmly.”

The other elders also landed on the peak.

“Let's figure out what happened first.”

Yin Huaxuan gave his son a deep look.

Feeling a bit more confident, Yin Huacheng spoke up: “Wangyue Cliff is within the area I am responsible for. As soon as I heard the signal arrow, I rushed over immediately.”

“But by the time I arrived, Wangyue Cliff was already empty.”

As his words fell, everyone’s expressions turned grim.

There was only one path to the top of Wangyue Cliff.

They hadn't seen Li Mo or Ying Bing on their way up, nor were they at the summit. This could only mean...

Everyone’s gazes turned to the Qingyuan abyss, their hearts sinking to the bottom.

“This longsword is Ying Bing’s.”

“She must have encountered an enemy she couldn't handle, forcing her to unleash a desperate strike.”

Xue Jing’s expression was unsightly as he walked out with a longsword in hand. The sword was covered in frost, still radiating a chilling aura.

“Those two little ones are no ordinary Qi and Blood Realm cultivators. Even if they联手, they might not defeat an Inner Energy expert, but they should have been able to hold on until we arrived.”

“Did a God-Viewing Realm expert attack them?”

Qian Bufan had barely finished speaking when everyone realized that the true purpose of the demonic cultist behind Wang Hu was actually the two true disciples.

*THUD!—*

Suddenly, Yin Huacheng spat out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying backward.

Just as he was about to crash into a tree, an invisible force dissipated the impact, causing him to spin several times before stumbling to his feet.

Yin Huaxuan supported his son, frowning. “Shang Wu, no one wants this to happen.”

“There are casualties every year during the trials. It's inevitable to be overwhelmed when overseeing such a large area. Does that mean everyone should be held accountable by the stewards?”

A flash of fire flickered in Shang Wu’s narrowed eyes.

She didn't make another move, but said coldly, “You had better not let me find out you have anything to do with this.”

Yin Huacheng looked as if he faced a great enemy, his face turning deathly pale in an instant.

“Shang Wu!”

Yin Huaxuan roared in anger, “I understand how you feel, but you can't go around making baseless accusations!”

Shang Wu ignored his fury completely.

---

“Alright, now is not the time for internal conflict.”

Qian Bufan asked, “Yin Hua, what news do you have from the birds you control?”

“Wangyue Cliff is too close to the Qingyuan abyss, so the birds cannot get near.”

“I will search the surrounding area. If I find any suspicious individuals, I will notify you all immediately.”

Yin Huaxuan nodded.

Xue Jing let out a heavy breath. “Searching for the demonist is secondary. Our top priority is to confirm whether Li Mo and Ying Bing are alive or dead!”

“If they are still alive, how do we rescue them?”

Silence.

Upon hearing this, the elders all fell silent.

They knew nothing about the situation below the Qingyuan abyss.

There were almost no records of this place within the sect.

Many powerful experts of the Qingyuan Sect had suspected that there were miraculous treasures below, which was why the abyss was filled with such a persistent, oppressive pressure.

Many had tried to explore it, but they either vanished without a trace or turned back halfway.

Jumping down from here, one would likely never be seen again, alive or dead...

Suddenly.

*Ting, ting—*

A sound rang out twice?

Shang Wu’s almond-shaped eyes flashed with a strange light as she quickly raised her wrist.

It was the Heart-to-Heart Bell!

Li Mo was still alive!

“Stop her!”

“Shang Wu, don't be so hasty to jump down!”

“They're alive. Let's discuss a plan; we can definitely find a way to rescue them.”

Shang Wu was about to recklessly jump down to save them.

The elders quickly stopped her.

The scene became extremely chaotic for a moment.

Only Yin Huacheng and his father, Yin Huaxuan, showed a hint of astonishment on their faces, almost in unison.

Yin Huacheng was just about to say something when he was glared back into silence by his father’s dark expression.

“Get back to the Rare Beast Peak!”

“...Yes.”

.......

“Master must know I'm still alive now.”

Li Mo thought to himself as he tightly gripped the Heart-to-Heart Bell.

After floating in the clouds and mist for so long, one’s sense of time and space begins to fade.

What is certain is that they have fallen very deep.

The oppressive pressure is also growing heavier. Li Mo can barely perceive anything around him, as if everything has vanished with the howling cold wind.

Only the coolness of the small hand in his palm gives him a sliver of reality.

Li Mo looked vaguely at the owner of the small hand.

In her slightly narrowed eyes, there was still the same calm and pure expression as always.

It was as if she had a plan, or perhaps she simply did not fear death.

“If it weren't for the daughter of destiny, one would surely die from such a height.”

“Probably not even left with ashes...”

“It's so high. Even if there is some protective item below, one might still be knocked out or injured.”

That unknown legacy site would be impossible to explore without Ying Bing.

If it were so easy to find, it wouldn't still exist.

So...

The ice lump cannot be harmed.

Thinking of this, Li Mo inexplicably pulled her closer.

A soft jade entered his embrace.

A gentle and powerful heartbeat was transmitted from her soft body.

Ying Bing: “?”

She didn't struggle, just looked at the boy in confusion as he slowly turned his back downwards.

He was preparing to use himself as a cushion for her?

Even with a heart as calm as still water, she couldn't help but feel a touch of absurdity, a mix of wanting to laugh and cry.

How could it possibly help if you cushioned the fall at such a height? They would likely both be smashed to pieces.

She had never been this close to a member of the opposite sex.

In her previous life, no man dared to come within three meters of her.

Ying Bing gently bit her lower lip.

If she struggled, it might change their falling trajectory...

In the end, she did not push the boy away.
