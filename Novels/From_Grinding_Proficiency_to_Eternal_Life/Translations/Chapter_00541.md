# Chapter 541: Senior Sister, You Are an Expert in Dual Cultivation; I Must Seek Your Guidance

The nascent form of a Divine Thunder Grotto!

It was completely different from the fragile "sprout" sensation typical of a Core Formation mid-stage cultivator's first condensation.

The moment Xu Yunfan's "seed" appeared, a heavy, ancient, terrifying pressure—as if the heavens were collapsing and eternal calamities were descending—arrogantly and brutally crushed down upon Liu Yunhua.

This pressure was not a physical weight but a force acting on a higher level, a transgression of the Dao Foundation.

Space twisted intensely within a foot of Xu Yunfan's body, collapsing inward.

The ambient spiritual energy in the air was instantly sucked dry, transforming into an absolute "vacuum" that acted as a restraint.

The domineering destructive will of thunder perfectly merged with this newly born restrictive force, transforming into invisible shackles.

Liu Yunhua felt as if she weren't facing a fellow cultivator of the same level, but directly confronting an ancient divine mountain that was collapsing, a mountain condensed from infinite thunder.

The air around her became as rigid as amber cast from ten-thousand-year-old glacial ice.

Liu Yunhua was horrified. The spiritual power she had rapidly circulated within her body, preparing to burst forth for escape or counterattack, slammed against an unbreakable dam. It instantly became sluggish, and there were even signs of it collapsing and rebelling against her.

Her proud Core Formation mid-stage spiritual power, when faced with the pure aura of law emanating from the other's nascent Grotto, was as fragile as a candle flame in a gale. It was ruthlessly suppressed within her body, making it incredibly difficult to even调动 a single wisp.

"A Grotto?! No! How could there be a nascent Grotto of this degree at the mid-stage?! And one so condensed and vast?!"

Liu Yunhua let out a silent scream in her heart. Her peerlessly beautiful face twisted instantly from extreme shock and the suffocating suppression of power, turning deathly pale.

To be fair, she had painstakingly stepped into Core Formation mid-stage and began to cultivate her nascent Grotto. Even after two lifetimes of reincarnation, she had only barely touched the threshold.

Now, he was telling her that the nascent Grotto condensing at the mid-stage belonged to Xu Yunfan.

It wasn't as if she hadn't seen the world.

The nascent Grottos condensing within the bodies of many late-stage Core Formation True Lords were likely inferior to Xu Yunfan's.

It was comparable to the nascent Grotto of a perfected Core Formation, a Grand True Lord level!

She wanted to question him, but her throat could only produce a weak, "Heh, heh" sound.

She wanted to summon her life-saving magic treasure or secret art, but her spiritual sense and thoughts seemed to be frozen as well. Her connection with her own magic treasures and spiritual power was brutally severed by a more superior force.

She could even clearly feel that her Hundred Desires spiritual power, cultivated through years of bitter cultivation, was letting out groans of unbearable strain under the aura of this nascent Grotto woven from thunder and the heavens. It was melting away as quickly as snow water.

Yang energy overcomes extreme Yin. This is the natural order.

Run!

I must run!

Only this thought remained in Liu Yunhua's mind.

Her eyes erupted with a crazed desire to survive. Her spiritual sense frantically urged her body, attempting to forcibly burn her vital essence to施展 a Blood Escape secret technique.

However, to her despair, no matter how desperately she tried, she couldn't budge the spiritual power in her body by even a fraction.

"Want to run? It's too late."

Xu Yunfan's cold, emotionless voice seemed to come from the nine heavens, yet also sounded directly within her soul.

There are gaps even among Core Formation mid-stage cultivators.

Sometimes, the gap between people is greater than the gap between a person and a pig.

He extended a hand, fingers spread, and pressed it toward Liu Yunhua from a distance.

To avoid drawing the attention of others, this palm strike had no light effects, no earth-shattering booms.

The entire process of suppression didn't even reveal a single wisp of excess spiritual power aura, which was enough to show the terrifying degree of Xu Yunfan's current control over his own术法 and spiritual power.

Even Liu Yunhua, an old-time Core Formation True Lord, found it inconceivable. Under Xu Yunfan's control, she felt as if she had turned into an insect trapped in amber.

Unable to escape.

The crazed light in her eyes instantly froze. The vital blood she had just stirred up throughout her body was like it had been slammed back by an invisible wall. The power was locked tightly within her, unable to detonate.

Xu Yunfan's palm seemed to press down casually, but it felt like an extension of the will of the entire nascent Grotto, carrying the crushing force of an entire world.

*Thud!*

Liu Yunhua, the enchanting, mid-stage Core Formation True Lord from the Hundred Desires Peak who intended to practice the art of sexual cultivation on others, didn't even have the chance to struggle. As if all her bones had been抽出, or as if she had been狠狠地 pressed into the ground by the invisible heavens, her knees went weak, and she fell straight to her knees.

Her knees hit the hard rock and dirt with a muffled thud.

The spiritual power in her body was completely locked down, her meridians feeling as if they had been灌满 with lead.

The heavy pressure of the Grotto made it so she couldn't even lift a finger, forced to maintain her kneeling posture. Her face was like golden paper, her eyes vacant, filled with an incomprehensible, immense terror.

Her proud, seductive charm had been completely crushed.

In front of her, Pu Yu, who had also been immobilized, wore an expression of pure terror. Xu Yunfan's palm strike hadn't avoided her. Although she wasn't the main target, just a brush of its edge made her clearly feel the helplessness and fear of an ant facing a natural disaster.

Xu Yunfan slowly withdrew his hand, the faint tremor from just having activated his nascent Grotto still lingering on his fingertips.

The natural and open smile on his face had long since vanished, replaced by deep calm and a hint of imperceptible coldness.

Though this was his outward appearance, Xu Yunfan let out a sigh of relief in his heart.

Fortunately, the posturing was a success.

Generally speaking, after a Core Formation cultivator condenses a nascent Grotto, they treasure it immensely, afraid of any external interference and not daring to reveal it in the slightest. At most, they might引动 the Grotto to empower themselves.

After all, if there is even the slightest damage to the Grotto, the cost of repair is unimaginably high.

How could it be like Xu Yunfan, who, relying on the fact that his nascent Grotto, condensed by the Attribute Panel, was several times harder than divine iron, threw it out to crush people.

If others saw this, they would surely spit at Xu Yunfan for squandering such a treasure.

He walked up to the kneeling Liu Yunhua and looked down at her.

However, Xu Yunfan also knew in his heart that this method could only suppress those weaker than him. If he were to encounter a master of the same level, it would be best to keep this nascent Grotto tucked away.

Liu Yunhua tried hard to lift her head, wanting to see this nascent Grotto that completely exceeded her understanding, but the terrifying pressure prevented her from gathering the strength to even lift her head. She could only feel humiliated by that cold gaze falling upon her back, a gaze that made no attempt to hide its intent, gradually moving downward.

Her neck, her chest, her lower body...

Liu Yunhua was just about to force out a seductive smile when Xu Yunfan spoke slowly.

"Now," Xu Yunfan said calmly. His voice wasn't loud, but it clearly reached the ears of Liu Yunhua and Liu Hanyan. "We can have a good, calm chat. Let's talk about this 'Sinking Star' ancient sword, the story behind it, and..."

He paused slightly, his tone taking on a hint of mockery.

"...the so-called 'opportunity' you wanted to obtain from me. Senior Sister, it seems the roles of the Cauldron and the cultivator are about to be swapped."

Xu Yunfan's tone shifted, his gaze falling back on Liu Yunhua, a hint of amusement in his eyes.

"Senior Sister, you are an expert in the Great Dao of Dual Cultivation. Coincidentally, Junior Brother also has some meager insights into how to peel away and purify the brand of a Cauldron. Why don't we take this opportunity to have an in-depth and candid exchange?"
