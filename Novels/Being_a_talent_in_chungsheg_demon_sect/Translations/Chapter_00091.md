# Chapter 91: Sword Qi Slashes Bu Tian!

Outside the Witch Ghost Secret Realm, above Skeleton Mountain.

The void split open, and Peak Master Bu Tian and Daoist Hong Yun stepped out one after another. Their Foundation Establishment gazes swept down, instantly covering the entire Skeleton Mountain.

In an instant, the previously cloudless sky became overcast with dark clouds, and streaks of lightning snaked through them like silver serpents, illuminating half the sky. Even an unintentional sweep of a Foundation Establishment True Person's divine sense struck fear into the hearts of the loose cultivators and demon ghosts in the mountains.

"This is the place," Peak Master Bu Tian said. Although his divine sense exploration yielded nothing, he couldn't help but smile. The fact that his divine sense couldn't immediately pinpoint the target meant something: it indicated that the opponent's hiding place was very high-grade!

"Who knew there would be an unexpected gain, a secret realm?" Thinking of such a tremendous harvest, Peak Master Bu Tian couldn't help but let out a soft hum. The next second, he began to divine with his fingers, wanting to see what kind of secret realm it was. However, he only calculated it to be an unremarkable, unknown minor secret realm.

"Never mind, I'll know once I go in." Peak Master Bu Tian was very confident. As the master of one of the Saint Sect's four peaks, his cultivation was already at the mid-stage Foundation Establishment, only a step away from the late stage. "Looking at the world, aside from the remnants of a True Monarch, who can kill me?"

Thinking this, Peak Master Bu Tian immediately cast a spell, a "Sky-Net Earth-Search Art," and quickly locked onto the entrance of the Witch Ghost Secret Realm.

"Found it!" Peak Master Bu Tian smiled chillingly, then took a step and walked towards the secret realm.

However, on the other side, Daoist Hong Yun, seeing this, not only showed no urgency but even revealed a strange expression: "This secret realm... something feels off!" Bearing the name 'Hong Yun' (Auspicious Luck), he naturally excelled in the Dao of Fortune. The moment he intended to follow Peak Master Bu Tian into the secret realm, he suddenly felt a jolt, a heart-pounding sensation. Only then did he decisively halt his steps. After all, with his current cultivation, what could possibly give him such a sense of danger?

"This is getting interesting..." Thinking this, Daoist Hong Yun suddenly gave a cold smile, watching Peak Master Bu Tian enter the secret realm with keen interest, a hint of schadenfreude in his eyes.

The next second—

"Rumble!!!"

A deafening roar erupted from within the secret realm, followed by a spiritual light that shot into the sky, rousing the 800-li Skeleton Mountain's earth veins and revealing its true form. Due to Peak Master Bu Tian's forceful intrusion, the Witch Ghost Secret Realm could no longer remain hidden and was completely exposed. Simultaneously, what was also revealed to the world was a world-shaking sword qi, located at the very top of the secret realm, hanging high in the sky like the Milky Way, resembling inverted mountains and seas, grand and unparalleled!

Beneath the sword qi was Peak Master Bu Tian, fleeing for his life.

"Shameless junior! Cunning villain! I—" Peak Master Bu Tian cursed continuously as he fled, his previous composure completely gone, replaced only by the anger and anxiety brought on by having his defenses broken. It was a Golden Core sword qi! Peak Master Bu Tian had never imagined that within the secret realm, which he had initially regarded as something within his grasp, there was actually a sword qi left behind by a Golden Core True Monarch! This was like finding a shark mixed into a fishpond!

"Lu Yang... Who exactly are you!?" Because the karma of the Witch Ghost Secret Realm was concealed by a divine talisman, Lu Yang himself lost his protection, and as a result, Peak Master Bu Tian naturally calculated his details clearly. However, even with the clear calculation, Peak Master Bu Tian dared not believe it. Because according to his divination, Lu Yang had been cultivating for less than a year, yet he had not only reached the perfection of Qi Refinement but also cultivated the Saint Sect's secret transmission, the 'Saint's Steal'. Not to mention, besides that, there were also the Saint Sect's great divine abilities like the 'Yin Transformation Corpse Release True Method,' 'Sever Thought to See Self Heavenly Silkworm Secret,' etc., all standard for true disciples... But in reality? Lu Yang had only just entered the sect! How could Peak Master Bu Tian believe this? It must be fake; his karma must have been obscured again! He even suspected that Lu Yang was the reincarnation of a certain True Person of the Saint Sect.

"No, such insidious and vicious conduct, without a doubt, he must be the reincarnation of a True Person of my Saint Sect..." Peak Master Bu Tian's thoughts raced, but the sword qi above his head forced him to quickly cast aside these distracting thoughts, fleeing through the air, trying to evade the sword qi's lock. However, all was futile. The next second, Peak Master Bu Tian abruptly stopped, his face grim, for further escape was useless; the sword qi had already locked onto his karma!

A clear voice descended from the heavens: "Demonic path, be punished!"

Before the words fully fell, the sword qi slashed! Peak Master Bu Tian was utterly unable to resist. However, a jade token at his waist activated on its own, flying to stand directly in front of him, blocking the sword qi. In an instant, even the movement of heaven and earth seemed to slow. The sword qi reflected a handsome young man in a Daoist robe, while from the jade token walked out a grim-faced middle-aged man. Their gazes met, and invisible, immense powers clashed wildly at a higher plane.

"Crack." After a shattering sound, the jade token shattered. The corresponding sword qi was also reduced by ninety-nine percent, leaving only a faint wisp that penetrated the jade token's obstruction and landed on Peak Master Bu Tian's body. Yet, even so, Peak Master Bu Tian still could not withstand it and exploded with a bang!

Amidst the scattered flesh and blood, only a robust soul of Peak Master Bu Tian remained, his eyes filled with towering fury as he looked towards the Witch Ghost Secret Realm.

Inside the secret realm, Lu Yang sighed helplessly at the sight. "As expected, I didn't kill him..." Just as he had anticipated, Peak Master Bu Tian indeed possessed a Golden Core-level life-saving item, which had indeed saved his life at a crucial moment.

"Fortunately, my side has also succeeded." Under the Golden Core sword qi, Peak Master Bu Tian's physical body was shattered, leaving only a soul, equivalent to suffering severe injury. Daoist Hong Yun, not far away, remained an impartial observer. And utilizing the last bit of time gained by the Golden Core sword qi, Lu Yang successfully completed the final step of the [Yama Hall]. At this moment, the Myriad Spirits Banner swayed, and the 800-li Skeleton Mountain immediately responded. The magnificent [Yama Hall] rose from the ground, and the Dharma Protector Goddess Su Nü was bathed entirely in divine light.

"Master..." After Su Nü gracefully landed beside Lu Yang, she bowed respectfully, showing no intention of resistance despite her own achievements. In fact, her beautiful eyes held a hint of fear when she looked at Lu Yang. Because Lu Yang had personally refined her with his spiritual consciousness, Su Nü, transformed into a Dharma Protector Goddess, was also affected, which included her understanding of Lu Yang's nature. In her opinion, her master could be perfectly described by four words: Meticulous as a needle! One absolutely must not offend him!

Seeing Su Nü's reverence, Lu Yang nodded in satisfaction: "Come in." As his words fell, Su Nü immediately assented softly and obediently entered Lu Yang's Dantian, offering her entire self to him without reservation.

The next second, Lu Yang's aura surged! As his eyes opened and closed, a dazzling divine ability light, bright as the rising sun in the sky, shone forth, within which six talismans, resembling dragon seals and phoenix scripts, shimmered brilliantly: [Profound Netherworld Underworld Lord]. Immediately after, the 800-li Skeleton Mountain's earth veins stirred violently, and an invisible bolstering power descended, causing three more talismans to appear out of thin air before the six existing ones. Their name was: Yama Heaven.

[Yama Heaven Profound Netherworld Underworld Lord]!

At this moment, Lu Yang felt warm currents surging throughout his body. Su Nü was like a handful of sweet dew, poured onto his Dantian. With such a Foundation Establishment Dharma Protector Goddess, although he hadn't reached Foundation Establishment himself, he could prematurely enjoy the bolstering and benefits that the Foundation Establishment realm provided to his own foundation. So much so that, in his perception, even the transformation progress of the [Corpse Release Immortal] had shortened from decades to mere months! Cultivating a great divine ability against one's realm with a Foundation Establishment-level status naturally led to rapid progress!

While Lu Yang's heart was filled with the ease and joy of great success at this moment, on the other side, Peak Master Bu Tian's mood was not so good.

"How is this possible..." He stared blankly at the surging aura of Lu Yang, hardly daring to believe his eyes: "An Attendant Heavenly Official of Jiangdong? No! Similar, yet not quite..."

Before he could figure it out, he saw Lu Yang glance sideways at him. In an instant, Peak Master Bu Tian felt a chill permeate his entire body. He was now only a soul, his cultivation greatly damaged, and fighting a Foundation Establishment cultivator again could lead to disaster!

"...Run!" Peak Master Bu Tian's decision was undeniably decisive. His soul immediately transformed into a stream of light, retreating, and he even cast out several clones to confuse his pursuer.

However, seeing this, Lu Yang merely formed a hand seal. He lightly joined his palms, with his index and pinky fingers bent into the palm... The next second, black light surged behind Lu Yang, projecting a gloomy, dense world. Within it were tens of thousands of witch ghosts, holding aloft a towering hall, roaring incessantly. There were also Impermanence delivering souls, ghost messengers hooking souls, judges bestowing rewards and punishments, and roaming gods patrolling the sky. Eight righteous gods, with green faces and fangs, fierce in demeanor yet solemn in appearance, each holding golden shackles, silver chains, wailing sticks, and books of life and death, clustered before the majestic hall. And atop the main hall, Lu Yang laughed heartily: "Senior has come a long way, why the rush to leave?"

The next second, the [Yama Hall] opened and closed.

"Why not step into my urn, and allow me to fulfill my host's duty!" As his words fell, Peak Master Bu Tian didn't even have time to dodge. He only felt his vision go dark, and when he regained his senses, he was already imprisoned within the [Yama Hall]!
