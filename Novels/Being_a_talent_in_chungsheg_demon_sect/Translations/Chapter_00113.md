# Chapter 113: Noob Village Fishing

As soon as the Buddhist cultivator, who had forged a Golden Body, collapsed at the front of the line, Guangming, positioned at the very back, instantly reacted.

"'Should I attain Buddhahood, if beings in my realm do not all possess true golden forms, I shall not achieve supreme enlightenment.'"

This was the "Great Golden Body True Form Incantation," one of the forty-eight great incantations from the *Great Vehicle Fundamental Sutra of True Enlightenment*, and also Guangming's primary cultivation spell.

As Guangming's voice resonated, a golden radiance emanated from all Buddhist cultivators in its path, as if they had all received the Golden Body's blessing. These Golden Bodies then interlinked, conjuring a golden canopy that slowly unfurled in all directions!

This was a protective Great Incantation.

Under the incantation's blessing, even those who hadn't cultivated the Golden Body technique could temporarily gain the power of a Golden Body. Furthermore, the more people present, the greater the power of the blessing.

However, in an instant, a loud bang echoed.

Boom!

Under Guangming's stunned gaze, the incantation's radiant light, which he had just fully unleashed, lasted less than a second before being effortlessly shattered by a sword light.

In a blink of an eye, another Buddhist cultivator's head was severed from their body.

"'This is impossible... A Foundation Establishment True Lord!?'"

Guangming's pupils constricted. His "Great Golden Body True Form Incantation" also possessed a certain rank. Logically, even a Great Divine Ability shouldn't have been able to breach it so easily.

He had clearly seen Lu Yang's Blood Yang Sword Pellet; it was, at best, a high-grade magical treasure, not even considered top-tier among them, let alone comparable to a Spirit Treasure. A sword pellet of such material, theoretically, should have been utterly incapable of shattering his protective Great Incantation.

Unless the opponent's rank was far superior to his own!

"'I also have days like this, huh...'"

As sword light spread, Lu Yang let out a contented breath. After all the high-level battles he'd fought, he had finally stumbled upon a fish pond game today.

Guangming's guess was precise.

Lu Yang hadn't even used any divine abilities or spells. After all, with his current high rank, nearing Foundation Establishment, even a casual breath could pierce Guangming.

"'Absolutely no challenge.'"

"'But... I love no challenge! Isn't the point of painstakingly cultivating to a high realm to easily crush the weak? Fishing in the novice village is my absolute favorite!'"

The next second, a vajra pestle slammed down.

Lu Yang's brows subtly arched. He neither dodged nor evaded, calmly watching the vajra pestle smash squarely between his brows, yet it failed to even graze his skin.

The disparity in rank was as vast as heaven itself. In a cultivator's duel, unequal ranks were akin to someone at the foot of a mountain attempting to attack someone at the peak—utterly impossible. Thus, even a vajra pestle capable of cleaving mountains and shattering rocks was, to Lu Yang, nothing more than a gentle breeze.

It couldn't even hinder his movements.

In a flash, Lu Yang once again transformed into sword light, stirring up a forceful wave of air, and slashed down towards another Buddhist cultivator, immediately taking another head.

However, just then, Guangming's eyes lit up.

Immediately after, a jade bottle appeared in his hand. He hurled it towards Lu Yang, and the bottle exploded in mid-air, instantly unleashing swirling crimson flames that spread rapidly.

Wherever the crimson flames passed, an abyss seemed to open, frantically devouring the surrounding spiritual energy. Several Buddhist cultivators who stood close to Lu Yang were merely grazed by the fire, and before they could even scream, they dissolved into wisps of green smoke in the blazing inferno, utterly annihilated without a trace of their bones!

Guangming, as if fleeing from vipers and scorpions, rapidly retreated after unleashing the crimson flames.

This was because the fire was called "Six Harmonies Dust-Cleansing Flame." It consumed spiritual energy as fuel; as long as spiritual energy remained, it was inextinguishable. When it landed on a cultivator, it clung like a gangrenous sore.

More importantly, its rank was high enough.

This was because it was bestowed by his own master, the "Subduing Dragon Arhat," and derived from the Heavenly Stellar **Blazing Dragon**—a Foundation Establishment-grade item. Dealing with Qi Refining cultivators was naturally effortless!

"'This person is still far too arrogant...'"

Guangming watched helplessly as the crimson flames filled the sky, engulfing Lu Yang's figure. His previously tense emotions immediately eased, and he let out a long breath.

"'What a pity, once he's burned to ashes, he can't be brought into the [Subduing Dragon Temple] anymore...'"

However, the very next second, he froze.

His eyes were wide with disbelief, for in the midst of the vast crimson flames, Lu Yang stood calmly, only his eyes, glowing red under the firelight, visible.

"'...No good!'"

Before Guangming's words even finished—

RUMBLE!

The crimson flames abruptly expanded amidst an explosion, directly engulfing the surrounding Buddhist cultivators. And within the flames, a figure was freely reaping lives!

The so-called "Six Harmonies Dust-Cleansing Flame," while not causing Lu Yang significant harm, could at least be described as utterly useless.

After all, Lu Yang had witnessed even the true **Blazing Dragon** in his previous life. How could a mere fragmented flame possibly harm him?

Lu Yang casually performed a Corpse Release method, shed his form and vanished, effortlessly escaping all the fiery qi. Immediately after, he once again transformed into sword light, turned around to detonate the "Six Harmonies Dust-Cleansing Flame," and then, using the momentum of the fire, began a frenzied slaughter, heads flying into the sky with streaks of blood.

Such a sight struck fear into the hearts of the Buddhist cultivators present.

Guangming felt a chill in his heart. It was a joke; this was undoubtedly a direct disciple of a True Monarch from a Holy Sect. How could such a great devil be someone he could contend with?

Yet, at this moment, he was exceptionally calm.

Don't flee!

The opponent clearly excelled in sword escape techniques; fleeing would only make him a target. Besides, he knew his own escape techniques were poor; if he truly tried to flee, he would certainly be the last one.

Wouldn't that be certain death?

Thus, after a flash of thought, Guangming took action. He suddenly roared, "'Everyone, don't panic! Behold my methods!'"

His voice was full of vigor and confidence, as if everything was still under his control. Coupled with the fact that Guangming was already their leader and possessed considerable prestige, he immediately became the backbone of the Buddhist cultivators present. Their formation, which had been on the verge of collapsing, stabilized once more.

However, Guangming knew this was only temporary.

They listened to him because they hoped he could deal with the devil before them.

Once they discovered he was merely pretending and truly couldn't contend with this great devil, they would ultimately retreat. It was impossible for them to genuinely follow his orders to their deaths.

SWISH—!

Sword light flashed, and another Buddhist cultivator's head flew into the sky.

The remaining Buddhist cultivators huddled together, each desperately circulating their magic power to raise protective Buddha light, while looking expectantly at Guangming.

You said to behold your methods, didn't you?

What are you still waiting for? Save us!

The next second, Lu Yang appeared above everyone. He suddenly sneered, then closed his five fingers, and a mass of dark clouds instantly materialized in his palm.

"'Gathering together, it saves me the trouble of killing you one by one.'"

As his voice fell, Lu Yang circulated his magic power, tossing the dark cloud from his hand into the air. In a flash, it enveloped everything around, plunging the world into sudden gloom.

Immediately after, fierce winds raged, and rolling dark clouds surged, revealing countless Yin spirits. They clashed and ground against each other, eventually transforming into streaks of golden-snake-like thunderbolts that flickered and streaked. Finally, with a downward flick of Lu Yang's palm, they slammed down with the might of a thousand thunderbolts!

Nine Heavens All-Tally Secret Demonic Yin Thunder!

This divine ability required no skill; it was purely about Lu Yang leveraging his superior rank and stronger magic power, overwhelming others with sheer numerical force!

The next second, thunderbolts descended like a cascading waterfall from the sky.

How could the Buddhist cultivators below endure such a violent bombardment? Their Buddha light and Golden Bodies lasted only for a few breaths before shattering inch by inch under the countless thunderbolts.

Only a full fifteen minutes later did Lu Yang withdraw his divine ability.

Looking down, where were there any Buddhist cultivators left? All that met the eye was a scorched earth, riddled with deep craters, almost unrecognizable from its previous state.
