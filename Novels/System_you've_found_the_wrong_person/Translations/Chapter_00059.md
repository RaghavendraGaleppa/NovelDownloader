# Chapter 59: My Sister Taizhen—Are You Scared?  

Daliang City was no longer an option.  

Originally, Dou Changsheng's journey north would have taken him through Daliang City. But after encountering Jin Wuming on the official road, Dou Changsheng immediately realized that the city was likely a dragon's den and tiger's lair for him—who knew how many dangers lurked there?  

Hadn't it been obvious? Jin Wuming hadn't even entertained the thought of taking a swing at him.  

Because Jin Wuming had also sensed that this chance encounter was somewhat... off.  

After Jin Wuming left, Dou Changsheng decisively turned around and abandoned the road, vanishing into the dense forest.  

Leaning against a towering tree, Dou Changsheng's expression darkened. The feeling of being watched was truly unbearable.  

Was it Chen Qingyao?  

Or was something amiss in Liang territory?  

Suddenly, Dou Changsheng regretted his decision. If he had chosen to head west to Qin, crossing the river into Southern Chen—despite the longer journey—he could have avoided the troubles of Northern Jin.  

But that thought was quickly extinguished.  

Southern Chen was a den of demons and monsters. With the Qingyang Secret Art and the Rebirth Mystic Water in his possession, he would still be a prime target.  

That was the most frustrating part.  

The major factions all knew better.  

But the world was dominated by mid- and low-tier cultivators.  

Ordinary Divine Marvel masters, lacking the qualifications to obtain such treasures, would inevitably turn to him for them.  

Wang Chongguang was a perfect example.  

His trip to Three Yang Mountain had been a waste. The gains were pitiful compared to the risks.  

Given time, the power of the Millennium Earth Pearl would allow him to naturally achieve the Five Qi Converging to Origin. He didn’t even need the Qingyang Spring.  

After a brief bout of hindsight-fueled grumbling, Dou Changsheng decided to travel by night and hide by day.  

Before mastering sword flight, this would have been dangerous—remote mountains and dense forests were rife with peril. But now, soaring high above, he could avoid ninety-nine percent of the trouble.  

Time passed slowly. As dusk settled, Dou Changsheng chewed on some dry rations and took a sip of water. The Heroic Sword unsheathed itself, hovering before him before lowering horizontally.  

Dou Changsheng stepped onto the blade.  

The sword remained motionless, as if bearing no weight.  

In the next moment, it soared into the sky.  

A gentle force emanated from the blade, forming a protective barrier that shielded Dou Changsheng from the biting night winds. His robes remained undisturbed, as though he existed in a separate world.  

The Heroic Sword cut through the air, carving out a sanctuary. Though sword flight was merely a mobility technique—not a combat art—its utility was undeniable.  

Dou Changsheng had already grasped its usage and recognized that this was merely an auxiliary skill to a greater sword control technique.  

His innate qi flowed like water, continuously depleting and replenishing in his dantian. The constant cycling of energy allowed him to sense his reserves gradually increasing—this, too, was a form of cultivation.  

High above, beyond the sight of ordinary folk, Dou Changsheng traveled north. He had no idea how far he had gone when he decided to descend for a brief rest.  

The reason was simple: despite mastering flight, his knowledge of navigation was lacking.  

When Wang Tianhe had escorted him, locating the capital had been effortless. Now, he was utterly lost.  

As he descended, Dou Changsheng scanned the surroundings for signs of human habitation. Asking for directions was the quickest solution.  

He had expected the night to make the search difficult, forcing him to wait until dawn. But soon, he spotted the glow of firelight.  

Dou Changsheng observed cautiously. A lone campfire in the wilderness would have been too risky to approach—recent events had left him skittish, and he needed time to steady his nerves.  

But this was a village.  

A massive bonfire blazed at its outskirts, surrounded by villagers in coarse linen clothes. They sang folk songs in an unfamiliar dialect, their voices carrying a peculiar cadence.  

Dou Changsheng relaxed slightly. It must have been a local festival.  

Still, he remained cautious. Approaching at night would be too conspicuous. He waited until dawn, watching as the villagers dispersed to their homes. After a while longer, he strode forward, posing as a passing traveler.  

Just outside the village, an elderly woman carrying a shoulder pole paused, her piercing gaze locking onto him.  

Her face was deeply lined, her silver hair dull and brittle. Her cloudy eyes seemed barely able to focus, and her hands bore the marks of age—dark spots that spoke of encroaching mortality.  

"Young man," she rasped, her voice hoarse as if unused for years—or perhaps damaged by some past injury. "This isn't a place for you."  

"Leave. Now."  

Dou Changsheng didn't argue. "You're right, elder."  

Something was off. A woman of her age shouldn't have been able to carry that load so effortlessly.  

Where there was abnormality, there was danger.  

He had barely taken a step when a jovial voice called out, "A guest is a guest!"  

"How can we let you leave empty-handed? You must take some local specialties with you!"  

A hunched, bald old man with a broad forehead and a dry, wiry frame shuffled forward, leaning on a cane. His smile was warm.  

"We haven't had visitors in ages. If I recall correctly, the last one was Madam Du's daughter-in-law."  

The old woman nodded. "The village chief is right. I was the most recent arrival."  

The chief squinted, straining to make out Dou Changsheng's features before sighing. "Ah, age is cruel. I can barely see your face, young man."  

"Back in the day, I could perceive changes from ten thousand miles away as clearly as the lines on my palm."  

*Damn it.*  

*This old bastard is testing me!*  

Dou Changsheng cursed inwardly. His luck had only just stabilized—was he back to being a walking disaster?  

Had Future Dou's near-lethal encounter with Fire Cloud True Person drained all his fortune?  

With a forced smile, he replied, "That's wonderful!"  

"To be honest, elder, my younger sister Taizhen loves local delicacies."  

"She told me that when traveling, one often meets kind elders like yourself."  

"And that I must remember their names—so she can repay their kindness."  

"Might I ask your esteemed name?"
