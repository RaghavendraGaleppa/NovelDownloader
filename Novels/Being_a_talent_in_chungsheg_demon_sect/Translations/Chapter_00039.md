Chapter 39: Enemy Attack

"Lu Yuanchun! Scoundrel!"

Seeing a gap torn open in the market's grand formation, Immortal Fairy Feixia's eyes were bloodshot. Yet, she immediately made a move completely opposite to Lu Yuanchun's.

"Junior Brother, let's join forces!"

Her escape light flashed, and Immortal Fairy Feixia directly landed in the market. She then turned and resolutely guarded the formation's opening: "We absolutely cannot let the Divine Martial Sect rush into the market..."

Upon hearing this, Lu Yang glanced at Immortal Fairy Feixia, feeling somewhat changed in his opinion of her. After all, judging by her appearance — crimson lips stained with blood, wilting aura — she had clearly suffered significant injuries. If she had fled with Lu Yuanchun, she might have had a chance to escape with her life, yet she chose to remain within the market.

*Could she be an inside agent?*

Adhering to the belief that "there are no good people in the Demonic Sect," Lu Yang immediately suspected Immortal Fairy Feixia. The latter also noticed his wary gaze.

"There's no escape!" Immortal Fairy Feixia sighed helplessly, having guessed Lu Yang's thoughts. She whispered, "The Divine Martial Sect has been plotting this for a long time. Fleeing would only lead to a dead end. Only by staying and holding out for reinforcements is there a glimmer of hope!"

Lu Yang still had doubts upon hearing this: "Senior Sister understands this principle, so how could Senior Brother Lu not know? If that's the case, why did he choose to flee?"

"Because the treasure jade is with him!" At this, Immortal Fairy Feixia became furious: "The Divine Martial Sect used that Profound Female Grand Yin Treasure Jade as bait and set up an ambush. Yet Lu Yuanchun, coveting the treasure jade, forcibly seized it. Not only did he implicate us all in falling into the trap, he also disregarded Senior Brother Chen's life and death, abandoning us to flee by himself!"

"So, he fled to escape punishment?" Lu Yang suddenly understood. Clearly, Lu Yuanchun knew his actions were disreputable. If he had stayed in the market, Immortal Fairy Feixia would sooner or later settle scores with him. That's why he chose such an extreme method. Given this, it was only natural that Immortal Fairy Feixia didn't follow Lu Yuanchun in his escape. If she had, it was unlikely she wouldn't have been silenced by him.

"Demons, today is your day of reckoning!"

Glorious qi and blood illuminated the sky, like fiery clouds rolling across the heavens. Finally, a burly man clad in armor and wielding weapons appeared, his leader's expression fierce and cruel.

"It's 'Divine Fist' Wu Zhichong!" Immortal Fairy Feixia's pretty face turned serious. She whispered, "This person is already at the ninth level of Qi Condensation, just one step away from Great Perfection. Junior Brother, be extremely careful. Senior Brother Chen was struck by one of his punches, and that's why his Dharma body collapsed and he died..."

Before Immortal Fairy Feixia finished speaking, the brawny man named Wu Zhichong had already soared forth on his escape light, his arm raised above his head, pulled back like a drawn bow.

"Die!"

The next second, a punch was thrown! A deafening roar instantly echoed in all directions. The square punch print thrust directly forward. In that instant, Lu Yang felt as if a mountain was pressing down on him!

*Boom!*

At the crucial moment, Immortal Fairy Feixia stepped forward, her cloud sleeves fluttering. Clusters of light clouds, wreathed in pure qi, spewed forth, intercepting Wu Zhichong's punch. In an instant, the colorful mist and smoke exploded outwards, finally blocking Wu Zhichong outside the market. However, the colorful mist also lost most of its spiritual light as a result.

Seeing this, a hint of pain flashed in Immortal Fairy Feixia's eyes. This colorful mist and smoke was one of her Dharma treasures, named "Sunset Cloud Smoke Net." It was the result of her painstaking refinement over many years, but it had suffered repeated damage this time.

At the same time, another escape light descended from the sky. After revealing his form, it was none other than Lu Yuanchun, who had just fled. His face was extremely pale at the moment, and astonishingly, a cultivator was following behind him.

"'Mountain-Moving Daoist' Duanmu Yuan..." Immortal Fairy Feixia's brows furrowed. She recognized the person intercepting Lu Yuanchun: another late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator from the Divine Martial Sect, whose strength was in no way inferior to hers.

"Lu Yuanchun, if you want to live, come back! Let's join forces!" Immortal Fairy Feixia spoke in a low voice. Although the Divine Martial Sect was formidable, in her opinion, they still had three late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators on their side, so it wasn't a lost cause. Even if Lu Yang was just an ordinary disciple with no special divine abilities, he could still handle early and mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators without issue. As long as she and Lu Yuanchun could hold off Wu Zhichong and the Mountain-Moving Daoist, allowing Lu Yang to free up his hands to deal with other Divine Martial Sect disciples, there might still be a chance to defend the market!

"...Fine! Then let's fight to the death and buy me some time!"

As his words fell, Lu Yuanchun took a deep breath. He actually burned his essence blood directly, and clusters of bloody light burst forth from his crown. His aura instantly surged several times over. Seeing this scene, Immortal Fairy Feixia finally breathed a sigh of relief.

*After all, this person is a disciple of the Patching Heaven Peak Lord, a Foundation Establishment cultivator's direct lineage. Perhaps he has some powerful techniques. With my assistance, we should be able to hold the market...*

Thinking this, Immortal Fairy Feixia no longer held back. She once again activated her "Sunset Cloud Smoke Net," attempting to buy time.

"Stop him!" Although Wu Zhichong didn't know Lu Yuanchun's divine ability, he couldn't allow him to fully unleash it. He immediately soared on an escape light, charging towards Lu Yuanchun.

Seeing this, Immortal Fairy Feixia, while forcing her True Qi and using all her might to block Duanmu Yuan, the Mountain-Moving Daoist and another late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator from the Divine Martial Sect, simultaneously called out loudly to Lu Yang beside her: "Junior Brother Lu, quickly take action! As long as we stop Wu Zhichong, we still have a chance to turn the tables..."

"Lu Yang? Just an ordinary disciple... What use is it even if he broke through to late-stage Qi Condensation?" Lu Yuanchun glanced at Lu Yang, sneering inwardly. In his eyes, Lu Yang was merely an unknown nobody, a minor character who had only broken through to the late stage by sheer luck, incomparable to a Foundation Establishment disciple like himself. Thinking this, his conviction grew stronger.

Immortal Fairy Feixia believed they still had a chance, but Lu Yuanchun didn't think so. In his opinion, Immortal Fairy Feixia had clearly overlooked a decisive factor. That was the corpse tide! Even if they could truly block the Divine Martial Sect members, as long as the formation's opening remained, when the corpse tide arrived, they would still be completely wiped out!

Therefore, the next second, Lu Yuanchun made his move.

"Behold my divine might!" As his words fell, Immortal Fairy Feixia's spirits immediately lifted. She watched as blood light coalesced around Lu Yuanchun, manifesting a magnificent, fierce demon shadow. She didn't expect Lu Yuanchun to directly kill Wu Zhichong; as long as he severely wounded him, there would be hope...

"Blood Shadow Heaven Escape Great Art!"

The demon shadow flickered, and Lu Yuanchun's figure instantly vanished, transforming into a streak of bloody light that appeared hundreds of meters away, speeding towards the outside of Skeleton Mountain. For a moment, Immortal Fairy Feixia was utterly dumbfounded. She had clearly underestimated Lu Yuanchun's shamelessness, never imagining that he was only feigning cooperation with her, and in reality, using her as a human shield.

However, at this moment, the sky outside Skeleton Mountain suddenly darkened.

"Trying to leave? You'd better stay!" With a cold chuckle, the bloody escape light that Lu Yuanchun had transformed into was actually severed mid-flight, forced to return to Skeleton Mountain. Lu Yuanchun's terrified cry emanated from within: "Great Perfection Qi Condensation?!"

The blood escape he had unleashed by burning most of his essence blood could absolutely not be stopped by anyone at late-stage Qi Condensation. The only ones who could stop it were those at Great Perfection Qi Condensation!

"Heaven wants me dead..." Lu Yuanchun was filled with unwillingness. He had finally managed to seize the Profound Female Grand Yin Treasure Jade. As long as he escaped with his life, he was sure to gain the attention of the Patching Heaven Peak Lord. Especially now that Zhao Xuhe had been abandoned by the Patching Heaven Peak Lord, this was his chance! Yet now, everything had come to naught.

Just then, Lu Yang's voice suddenly reached Lu Yuanchun's ears: "Senior Brother Lu, return to the market first..."

"At this point, what good would it do?" Lu Yuanchun was utterly disheartened, not even having the interest to respond to Lu Yang. After all, in his opinion, at this moment, the only difference between Lu Yang and himself was who died sooner or later...

The next second, the previously silent Lu Yang suddenly took a step forward, his large sleeves fluttering. His ten fingers flickered rapidly, and in an instant, he conjured dozens of formation runes that landed around the market. They broke through the Divine Martial Sect's miniature formations that were fixing the grand formation's opening, and then, with a sudden motion, he manipulated the grand formation to close.

*Boom!*

In an instant, countless dense formation runes emerged, forming a light barrier that enveloped the market inside and out. The grand formation had actually re-sealed itself, returning to its complete state!

"...Huh?" Seeing this, Lu Yuanchun's eyes instantly widened. Then, with a jolt, he quickly manipulated his blood light to fly back, shouting loudly, "Brother Lu, save me!!!"
