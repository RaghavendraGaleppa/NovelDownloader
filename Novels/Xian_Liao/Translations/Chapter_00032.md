# Chapter 32: Metal and Water

After speaking with Miss Lin for a while, Zhou Qing noticed the sky darkening, so she took her leave. Her visit had lasted only half an hour.

After seeing them off, Zhou Qing carefully removed the congratulatory paper first, stored it properly, and then opened the box. Inside, lined with satin, lay a wild ginseng with five leaves.

Ginseng typically comes in seven forms: three-flower, palm, two-stem, lantern, four-leaf, five-leaf, and six-leaf. Seven-leaf and above are considered legendary, bordering on mythical. Six-leaf wild ginseng is already an extremely rare treasure, usually reserved as tribute for the imperial court—not a matter of price, but simply unavailable on the market.

Five-leaf ginseng, second only to six-leaf, is the best one can find in the market. While not as potent as six-leaf, it far surpasses ordinary ginseng in efficacy.

On this Mid-Autumn Festival, his birthday, Miss Lin had gifted him a five-leaf ginseng. Likely considering his upcoming provincial examinations, ginseng not only nourishes but also revitalizes the mind. A cup of ginseng tea brewed from its tendrils could instantly refresh him during study fatigue—far better than the old methods of tying one's hair to the roof or stabbing one's thigh to stay awake.

In his previous life, Zhou Qing couldn't say for sure whether ginseng lived up to its legendary restorative claims. But in this life, practicing martial arts and cultivating his body, he could genuinely feel the benefits of rare medicinal herbs.

A five-leaf ginseng, even consumed directly, would undoubtedly greatly aid his martial training.

Lately, his progress in Tiger-Crane Fist had slowed significantly, still not reaching the "proficient" level. Moreover, the Blood Qi Powder and Black Chicken Pills, combined with ordinary meat, could no longer keep up with the demands of his training.

Though persistence and frequent meals would eventually push Tiger-Crane Fist to "proficient," he couldn't be sure how long it would take. Pessimistically, it might not even reach that level before the special provincial examinations.

Zhou Qing focused on Tiger-Crane Fist alongside his studies to enhance his strength. He knew that if the Zhang family or the Fierce Tiger Gang intended to act against him, the journey from Jiangzhou to Changzhou would be their best opportunity.

However, he wasn't just relying on self-improvement and hidden cards. He also planned to ask Fushan to escort him to Changzhou. If Fushan refused to leave the mountain, he'd turn to Zhishan and others. Still, self-reliance was paramount—no matter what others did, one's own strength was the foundation.

As for the eight-legged essays required for the provincial exams, his current memory and familiarity with classical texts and commentaries gave him strong confidence in passing. Unless the examiners deliberately failed him, securing the rank of provincial graduate was highly likely.

---

Eight-legged essays were challenging only to those who didn't know how—once mastered, they became straightforward. For someone like Zhou Qing, trained in classical Chinese, producing above-average essays wasn't difficult. If lucky enough to encounter a topic he'd studied before, the examiners would have no reason to fail him.

Thus, in the coming months, his study plan focused on reviewing and reinforcing existing knowledge. The real challenge wasn't the exam itself but ensuring smooth participation.

In this world, Zhou Qing was alone. Even on the Mid-Autumn Festival—his birthday—it was just another ordinary day. Nonetheless, he paid solemn respects to his parents' memorial tablets and sang a birthday song for the original owner of this body.

After these rituals, Zhou Qing pondered how to use the five-leaf ginseng Miss Lin had given him. Both the Black Chicken Pills and Blood Qi Powder used ginseng as a primary ingredient.

He decided to first use a few ginseng tendrils to prepare Blood Qi Powder. With other materials ready, he only needed to replace the ordinary ginseng powder with the five-leaf ginseng powder.

Grinding herbs was second nature to Zhou Qing now.

As he finished the new Blood Qi Powder, a thought struck him.

His attention shifted to the "Health Master" panel. Behind the entry for "Basic Alchemy (Rudimentary)," three faintly glowing characters appeared: "Blood Qi Pill."

"Blood Qi Pill?"

Zhou Qing recalled the fusion of Tiger Play and Crane Form. It seemed the Blood Qi Pill was an advanced version of Blood Qi Powder. Perhaps his recent efforts in refining Five-Fragrance Pills, Black Chicken Pills, and Blood Qi Powder had accumulated enough experience to trigger this alchemical inspiration.

With a thought, the characters for "Blood Qi Pill" solidified.

Simultaneously, a flood of memories filled his mind—countless attempts to merge the pharmacology of Black Chicken Pills and the Rejuvenation Talisman Manual with Blood Qi Powder, culminating in a new nourishing and blood-replenishing pill: the Blood Qi Pill.

Years of effort had borne fruit. The recipe and refining process for the Blood Qi Pill became part of his memory.

Sweat dripped heavily, as if all those years of toil had condensed into this moment. He felt slightly weakened, similar to when Tiger Play and Crane Form merged, though less severe this time.

After replenishing fluids and energy, Zhou Qing checked the Health Master panel:

Five Animals Exercise (Rudimentary): Tiger Play (Proficient), Deer Play (Proficient), Bear Play (Rudimentary), Bird Play (Rudimentary), Ape Play (Rudimentary).

Martial Skills: Tiger-Crane Fist (Beginner); Finger Flick Divine Skill (Transcendent); Breeze Talisman Manual (Proficient).

Special Skills: Rejuvenation Talisman Manual (Beginner).

Basic Alchemy (Rudimentary): Blood Qi Pill.

Literary Courage (Elementary).

Remaining Lifespan: 39 years.

Over the past month, focusing on Tiger-Crane Fist without breaking through to "proficient" left his lifespan unchanged at 40 years. Acquiring the Blood Qi Pill's complete knowledge had cost him another year. Combined with the six years lost during the Tiger-Crane Fist fusion, he'd lost seven years total.

However, advancing Crane Form from beginner to proficient had added seven years. Given the vastly greater difficulty of mastering Tiger-Crane Fist, the lifespan increase upon success should exceed seven years.

After all, lifespan reduction stemmed from consuming vitality, depleting the body's reserves.

The Blood Qi Pill was essentially a refined version of Black Chicken Pills and Blood Qi Powder, incorporating elements from the Rejuvenation Talisman Manual's pharmacology, with adjustments in sequence and technique.

All necessary ingredients were at hand.

Zhou Qing entered his makeshift alchemy room and, guided by his newfound expertise, began refining Blood Qi Pills using ordinary ginseng.

First attempt: failure.
Second attempt: failure.
Third attempt: still failure...

Unfazed, Zhou Qing had expected this—only five-leaf ginseng could produce true Blood Qi Pills. His goal was to replicate the steps from his memories, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical skill.

By dawn, after repeated attempts, he'd mastered every step flawlessly. Using a small portion of five-leaf ginseng, he successfully refined three genuine Blood Qi Pills.

The pills emitted a unique fragrance that even attracted the rooster, Wangri, who instinctively craved them. Zhou Qing tossed it some failed pills made from ordinary ginseng, which it ate without its usual enthusiasm—clearly not as appealing.

Without Zhou Qing's permission, the rooster wouldn't dare touch the Tiger King's treasures. In the Tiger King's courtyard, it even relieved itself only in designated spots.

Though eager to test the Blood Qi Pills immediately, Zhou Qing decided to rest first and replenish his energy.

---

Dawn broke, and Jiangzhou grew colder after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Opening his door, Zhou Qing exhaled visible breath, his mind sharpened by the chill. As usual, he began his morning reading, his voice filling the quiet courtyard with an unassailable dignity.

The mulberry tree's leaves swayed in rhythm with his recitation. Wangri crowed from the corner, harmonizing with his reading, creating an atmosphere of serene isolation.

"Roosters crow and dogs bark, yet neighbors grow old without visiting."

Tranquil. Natural.

After stretching and breakfast, Zhou Qing took a Blood Qi Pill. Heat surged through his body, igniting an urge to train.

Without hesitation, he began practicing Tiger-Crane Fist, each movement flowing smoothly.

Half a month passed.

With the Blood Qi Pills' aid, Tiger-Crane Fist advanced rapidly from beginner to proficient. His remaining lifespan increased from 39 to 46 years.

"Indeed, the greater the difficulty, the greater the reward in vitality."

He also noticed something else: after Tiger-Crane Fist's breakthrough, the heat energy from training and the Crane Qi in his dantian grew restless, showing signs of mutual attraction.

Originally, he'd wondered why the two energies hadn't merged after mastering Tiger-Crane Fist. Now he understood—beginner level wasn't enough. Only at proficient did fusion become possible.

Thus, merging the two energies was part of Tiger-Crane Fist's cultivation process. Complete fusion would signify true mastery.

The mysterious heat energy in his dantian felt thick and moist, while the Crane Qi was light and sharp. Though drawn together, their fusion felt unstable.

Was it really that simple?

Zhou Qing decided to visit Qingfu Temple again and consult Fushan. Besides, it had been a while—Hu Butcher's leg injury should have improved.

---

At Qingfu Temple, Hu Butcher could already walk, though not yet smoothly. His recovery was faster than expected.

Fushan had taught him a "Sweeping Leaves Leg Technique," tailored for those with impaired mobility, to help restore his legs' functionality.

"Ah, junior brother, you..." Fushan, seeing Zhou Qing after so long, sensed something different about him. His vitality seemed unchanged, yet there was an indescribable transformation.

"Let's test it." Fushan grinned, grabbing Zhou Qing's arm.

Zhou Qing retreated lightly, their movements fluid and precise. Fushan's hand, shaped like a crane's beak, barely grazed Zhou Qing's sleeve.

"You win, senior brother," Zhou Qing conceded.

Though not using full strength, Zhou Qing felt Fushan controlled the exchange effortlessly—not through sheer power but something deeper.

Fushan, however, was stunned. Zhou Qing's Crane Form now bore traces of their... senior brother's mastery. How had he progressed so far in such short time?

A fleeting thought crossed Fushan's mind, but he dismissed it. Zhou Qing was born for scholarship, destined for the imperial court. How could he abandon that path to pursue Fushan's unrealistic dreams?

Even if one could cultivate within officialdom, reaching the innate realm required unwavering dedication—something incompatible with worldly ambitions. And even with total commitment, success wasn't guaranteed.

Alchemy wasn't a field where effort guaranteed results. Most attempts ended in vain.

Collecting himself, Fushan said, "Junior brother, I'm not young anymore. In a few years, I might not beat you. What brings you here?"

Zhou Qing asked about merging the internal energies from Tiger Play and Crane Form.

Fushan explained, "Your Tiger Play nurtures vitality, while Crane Qi, though from the Rejuvenation Talisman Manual, is sharp and aggressive. I haven't practiced either, so I can't say how to merge them. Moreover, merging might not improve their effects unless fully integrated. Even with your talent, that would take at least five, maybe ten years—a waste of time. But if you insist, consider the Five Elements. Crane Qi belongs to Metal; your Tiger Play strengthens the kidneys, which govern Water. Metal generates Water—that might work."

Zhou Qing's understanding deepened. The key to merging the two energies lay in Metal generating Water.

He pressed Fushan for more on the Five Elements' interactions, but Fushan only knew basics from Fushan's teachings. The real expert was Fushan himself.

Disappointed but grateful, Zhou Qing descended the mountain, preparing to advance Tiger-Crane Fist to proficient. He sensed a qualitative leap awaited upon success.

Onward, ever onward!
