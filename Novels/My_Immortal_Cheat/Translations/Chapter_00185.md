# Chapter 185: All Arrive

As the Abyss Grave Dao Lord retracted his weapon, the Four Dragons of Heavenly Evolution also withdrew their four large banners. As the runes surrounding them dispersed, four identical faces were revealed, wearing identical ancient golden armor, even their hair ornaments were the same.

"Damn, they're really something," Zhou Tian exclaimed again upon seeing this scene.

The atmosphere was extremely strange. The Master of the Abyss Grave was seething with unvented anger, feeling incredibly stifled. He wanted to lash out but couldn't find a reason. A moment later, he turned his gaze to the Sacred Devil and spoke, "Fellow Daoist, how about you and I join forces to clear this place? So many people here are quite an eyesore."

He had noticed the Sacred Devil's presence from the beginning, but didn't know that the Sacred Devil had only just broken through to Dao Lord here. He merely assumed he was a fellow Dao Lord-level expert who had entered with him. Some people's expressions changed, and they watched the Sacred Devil's reaction with extreme tension. If two Dao Lords joined forces, they might truly be unable to resist.

"An eyesore to you, perhaps, but not to me," the Sacred Devil said indifferently, rejecting the Abyss Grave Dao Lord's proposal. This was a very dangerous idea. Some less confident individuals had already left when the Abyss Grave Dao Lord descended. Now, those remaining were all quite confident in themselves. One or two might be manageable, but with so many people combined, plus the renowned Four Dragons of Heavenly Evolution, it would be a thorny situation.

The Abyss Grave Dao Lord's face instantly turned extremely ugly, becoming ashen. "May I ask where Fellow Daoist hails from? Should time permit in the future, I will certainly pay a visit!"

A threat, this was an overt threat. The Abyss Grave Dao Lord was clearly using the Abyss Grave behind him to pressure the Sacred Devil, to force him to act. Moreover, he wasn't afraid of the Sacred Devil refusing to speak. At the Dao Lord level, it was impossible not to leave any trace in the Star Realm. Even if the Sacred Devil didn't say, he could still find out.

"Hahahaha…" Zhou Tian laughed, a very unrestrained laugh, his gaze fixed on the Abyss Grave Dao Lord. "Little brother, tell him where we're from."

The Abyss Grave Dao Lord frowned tightly, shifting his attention to Zhou Tian. He had long noticed Zhou Tian by the Sacred Devil's side but hadn't paid him much mind, simply assuming he was the Sacred Devil's disciple or someone similar. However, upon hearing Zhou Tian's address to the Sacred Devil, he realized it wasn't that simple.

The Sacred Devil also smiled and said, "My elder brother told me to tell you that we… are from Kyushu!" After the lotus seed merged his two personalities, the Sacred Devil's character had changed significantly. If one were to find an accurate word to describe it, he had become much naughtier.

The Abyss Grave Dao Lord was stunned. Could there be such a coincidence? Even people from the other top twenty powers would have to give him some face, but it just had to be someone from Kyushu. Anyone in the Star Realm who was even slightly well-informed knew that the Abyss Grave was planning to move against Kyushu. Since this was a Dao Lord from Kyushu, naturally, no face needed to be given.

At the same time, he also became somewhat wary of Zhou Tian. Because Zhou Tian was shrouded by the Sacred Devil, no one present could see through him. The "elder brother, little brother" remark was clearly a joke to anyone with discerning eyes and shouldn't be taken seriously. However, to be treated this way by a Dao Lord, Zhou Tian was definitely not simple.

Just then, "Hahahaha…" A loud, unrestrained laugh rang out. The Abyss Grave Dao Lord abruptly turned his head to see who was so audacious. It was the Golden Ape, wielding a brass short staff, its mouth wide open, emitting peals of laughter.

"Presumptuous!" The Abyss Grave Dao Lord was just fretting over a lack of reason to act. He immediately made his move. The void roared, and the black stone tablet reappeared, smashing down directly towards the Golden Ape.

The Golden Ape's reaction speed was not slow either. He plucked a single strand of purple-gold hair from behind his head. It was distinctly different from the color of his regular fur, with the Qi of the Grand Dao flowing through it. He gently blew on the purple-gold hair. Boom! In an instant, the purple-gold strand emitted light, and a massive purple-gold giant ape appeared behind him, its blood and qi surging, like an ancient god or demon, golden flames burning in its eyes. It held a long golden staff, interwoven with red patterns, incredibly thick, exuding monstrous might.

The purple-gold giant ape raised the golden-red staff in its hand and fiercely smashed it towards the black stone tablet. Clouds in all directions exploded. The sky itself cracked, and the void became dim and colorless, all shaken by this single strike. The entire world wailed and trembled slightly, as if being suppressed.

Boom!

The black stone tablet actually shattered, transforming into streaks of light and vanishing. This was not the physical entity, but merely a projection of the true tablet. The Abyss Grave Dao Lord's eyes were chilling, fixed intently on the Golden Ape. The Golden Ape, without delay, plucked a few more strands of hair from behind its head, all purple-gold, and held them in its hand.

The Abyss Grave Dao Lord was so frustrated he almost vomited blood. He felt as if he had been cursed, wondering why his luck was so terrible. However, he didn't continue his attack, unwilling to expend too much cost dealing with this purple-gold giant ape, fearing others might seize the opportunity.

The purple-gold giant ape let out a sigh of relief, put away the hair in its hand, and simultaneously cursed itself vehemently in its heart. Why hadn't it held back? It had simply laughed involuntarily upon hearing that the Sacred Devil was from Kyushu, due to such a coincidental matter, and had consequently lost a protective item given to it by an elder. It felt a pang of heartache. All those purple-gold hairs it had just shown were fake; only one was real. That strand of hair was not easy to refine, requiring the consumption of origin blood, so there weren't destined to be many of them.

The atmosphere once again returned to a strange state. Everyone present felt a surge of satisfaction seeing the Abyss Grave Dao Lord thwarted. Just moments ago, he had descended forcefully, looking down on everyone, declaring he would clear the area. Everyone present had a suppressed indignation in their hearts, and now seeing him suffer a setback, they couldn't help but feel relieved.

A golden palm floated in the void, already half-opened, allowing one to directly see the contents within: multicolored substances bobbing and sinking. Although trapped by golden runic chains extending from the golden palm, the Dao fluctuations were even more intense, creating astonishing phenomena. Vaguely, a grand world was even projected, drawing everyone's gaze.

Just then, a roaring sound came from the north; a powerful expert had torn through space and arrived.

"Everyone has arrived," the Sacred Devil said with deep eyes. He had already sensed an aura even more restrained yet grander than that of the Abyss Grave Dao Lord.

"Someone from Border Prison?" Zhou Tian asked.

"Precisely."

The roaring sound still lingered in the sky, but the person had already appeared in the field. This individual had a youthful appearance, black hair, and an enigmatic symbol on his forehead from which terrifying power seeped out. He wore white robes and held a dark, black chain, creating a stark contrast.

The Border Prison Dao Lord let out a soft "Oh?" and feigned surprise as he said, "Oh? Yuan Chi, aren't you the one who dislikes associating with lower life forms the most? Why haven't you cleared the area?" His expression was exaggerated, as if immensely surprised.

"Huang Qi, don't be so sarcastic. Or perhaps you'd like to try clearing it yourself?" the Abyss Grave Dao Lord said with a gloomy expression, clearly indicating that the two knew each other.
