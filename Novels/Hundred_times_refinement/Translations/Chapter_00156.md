# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 104: Foundation Establishment (Seeking Votes)  

Lin Xuan was ecstatic inwardly, but outwardly, he maintained a calm demeanor as he explained the benefits of submitting to him as her master to the little yin soul.  

"Condensing a physical form and achieving immortality through cultivation." Lin Yue'er was deeply moved by these words. Besides, she had no other choice at the moment, so she agreed joyfully.  

Lin Xuan pricked his finger and let a drop of blood fall, infusing it into Lin Yue'er's soul through a Daoist technique, completing the master-servant ritual. Even if she were to transcend tribulations and become a ghost immortal in the future, she would still be bound to obey him.  

Next, Lin Xuan took out a blank jade slip and copied a ghost cultivation technique into it. This technique was something he had stumbled upon by chance. Although it was only an introductory method, it would suffice for Lin Yue'er for now. Once he successfully established his foundation, he would help her find a better technique later.  

With matters settled, Lin Xuan turned his focus to breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage.  

He selected a quiet room abundant in spiritual energy and began his cultivation. Lin Xuan consumed a top-grade Marrow Cleansing Pill and sat in meditation to refine his qi.  

Legendary pills were indeed different. Previously, even high-grade pills had almost lost their effectiveness for him, but as soon as the top-grade pill entered his system, he felt a cool, refreshing energy flowing through him. Not daring to waste a moment, Lin Xuan began circulating his qi through the grand celestial cycle.  

After fully refining the pill's energy, Lin Xuan felt his stagnant cultivation progress improve slightly.  

He hadn't succeeded in establishing his foundation yet, but he wasn't disheartened. This was expected. Throughout the history of the cultivation world spanning tens of thousands of years, no ordinary person had ever reached the Foundation Establishment stage. Although he possessed heaven-defying top-grade pills, his path was bound to be arduous.  

He continued cultivating.  

---  

Time passed day by day, and before he knew it, over three months had gone by.  

With a creak, the door that had remained shut for nearly a hundred days finally opened, and Lin Xuan stepped out.  

"Young Master!"  

A sweet voice reached his ears. Lin Xuan turned to see the little yin soul floating toward him. Compared to before, Lin Yue'er's form had become more distinct, and she no longer feared sunlight. It seemed her ghost cultivation had made significant progress over these hundred days.  

"Did you succeed in establishing your foundation?"  

Lin Xuan nodded. The difficulties of cultivating without a spiritual root were truly unimaginable to outsiders. If it were Qin Yan, even a mid-grade pill would have been enough for her to establish her foundation effortlessly. But for him, he had nearly exhausted an entire furnace of heaven-defying top-grade pills before barely succeeding.  

The hardships he had endured were too painful to recall. Shaking off those thoughts, Lin Xuan clenched his fist lightly, feeling the surging spiritual power within. His suffering hadn't been in vain—he was now a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

"Young Master, what's wrong? Aren't you happy?"  

Lin Yue'er was sharp-witted and immediately noticed the shadow over Lin Xuan's mood. Of course, this was also because they were bound by a master-servant contract, so Lin Xuan didn't bother hiding his emotions from her.  

"It's nothing."  

Lin Xuan shook his head. He was troubled by the challenges of future cultivation. While reaching the Foundation Establishment stage was certainly a good thing, he had realized that without a spiritual root, progressing further would be even harder.  

Drawing from past experience, Lin Xuan knew that sheer effort wouldn't be enough. For an ordinary person to cultivate, a steady supply of pills was essential—otherwise, progress would be impossible.  

Although he still had a few top-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills left and thousands of discarded pills in his storage ring, the pills required for each cultivation stage were different. Even top-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills would no longer aid his cultivation now.  

For the Foundation Establishment stage, two types of pills were needed: Foundation Establishment Pills and Body-Tempering Pills.  

The Foundation Establishment Pill functioned similarly to the Marrow Cleansing Pill for Qi Refinement cultivators, while the Body-Tempering Pill, as its name suggested, strengthened the body, expanded meridians, and allowed the cultivator to store more spiritual energy—acting as a supplementary aid.  

It was important not to underestimate this stage. Although Foundation Establishment was a higher realm, it was still part of laying the groundwork for the long path of immortal cultivation.  

Rumors suggested that consuming more Body-Tempering Pills could increase one's chances of reaching the Core Formation stage. Of course, that was merely a legend, and for Lin Xuan, it held little relevance—Core Formation was still far too distant for someone who had just established his foundation.  

Though Lin Xuan lacked a spiritual root, his ambitions were vast. He wouldn't be content with just Foundation Establishment—he aimed to push toward even higher realms of cultivation.  

Now that he had a cultivation method—the profound *Nine Heavens Mystic Art*—what he lacked were the pills to complement his training.  

Unlike other cultivators, Lin Xuan possessed the ability to purify pills. All he needed were discarded pills to refine miraculous elixirs.  

But where could he find discarded pills now?  

Back when he was the overseer of the Piaoyun Valley's discarded pill repository, sourcing them hadn't been an issue. But now, as a rogue cultivator without a sect, he had no such access.  

Would he have to join another sect?  

Lin Xuan pondered. Compared to Yanzhou, Youzhou's cultivation standards were higher, but most practitioners were still at the Qi Refinement stage. With his Foundation Establishment cultivation, joining a sect wouldn't be difficult—in fact, he would likely be warmly welcomed.  

But after careful consideration, Lin Xuan deemed this the worst possible option.  

First, he didn't want to be bound by sect rules again. Second, the sect he joined might not even have discarded Foundation Establishment pills. The reason was simple: in the cultivation world, Marrow Cleansing Pills were the lowest-grade pills, and their ingredients were relatively easy to obtain, which was why sects mass-produced and distributed them to disciples.  

Foundation Establishment Pills, however, were different. Despite being just one tier higher, their ingredients were far more precious. Not even Piaoyun Valley—let alone larger sects—would refine them in bulk to distribute as benefits.  

Foundation Establishment cultivators had to seek out their own ingredients, then either refine the pills themselves or pay alchemists in spirit stones to do it for them.  

In other words, while sects might have discarded Marrow Cleansing Pills, they wouldn't have discarded Foundation Establishment Pills.  

And even if they did, Lin Xuan applying to manage a discarded pill repository as a Foundation Establishment cultivator would raise eyebrows. Other cultivators weren't fools—they'd quickly suspect something was amiss. Lin Xuan wasn't about to invite trouble so blatantly.  

"Yue'er, let's go."  

Though he faced challenges in his future cultivation, Lin Xuan was confident he'd find a solution. The little yin soul transformed into a streak of white light and flew into his sleeve.  

With a flicker of his figure, Lin Xuan left the estate, riding his artifact into the distance. A more thrilling and dazzling cultivation world awaited him.
