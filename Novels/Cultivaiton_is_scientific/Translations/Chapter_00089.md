# Chapter 89: Daily Routine  

Spiritual Farmer Li Shiming's day unfolded in a familiar rhythm.  

At dawn, he would arrive at the spirit fields and channel his spiritual energy to cast the *Spring Breeze Transforms Rain* technique. Only after truly beginning to tend the fields did he realize the shortcomings of his current technique.  

First was the coverage issue. Normally, his *Spring Breeze Transforms Rain* could only cover about 100 square meters at a time across five acres of spirit fields. To tend to all five acres, he needed to cast the technique a staggering 34 times.  

This was when the hardships of being a Spiritual Farmer truly became apparent. As a Qi Refinement third-layer cultivator, just casting the technique 34 times consumed half of his spiritual energy. Fortunately, he had broken through to the third layer—had he remained at the second layer, he would have barely managed two acres before exhausting his energy completely every day.  

Second was efficiency. The effectiveness of *Spring Breeze Transforms Rain* in the spirit fields paled in comparison to its performance in the soilless cultivation of his machine room. A significant portion of the spiritual rain would seep into the soil beneath the fields rather than being absorbed by the spirit rice.  

Using IBMz15's data analysis, he was now researching how to optimize the technique—adjusting the volume of spiritual rain to meet the rice's needs while expanding its coverage. The goal was to find the perfect balance between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising growth.  

But this was still in the data collection phase, and progress would take time.  

After casting *Spring Breeze Transforms Rain*, his work in the fields wasn’t done yet.  

Next came *Metal Essence Needle*, a technique that sent a fine golden needle darting through the fields to eliminate any spiritual pests. Since the soil had been thoroughly cleansed during initial preparation, infestations were rare.  

Few pests could breach the island’s defensive formation, and most were native to the soil itself. Still, daily checks were necessary. A small number of pests might not cause much damage in a day or two, but over time, they could hinder the spirit rice’s growth.  

Though he didn’t rely on the fields for cultivation resources, Li Shiming took his role as a Spiritual Farmer seriously—it was his foundation for survival within the sect.  

By the time he finished tending the fields, two hours had passed.  

Next, he turned his attention to the Spirit Talisman Bamboo. His *Spring Breeze Transforms Rain* technique had worked wonders—the bamboo had adapted well to the spirit soil. Transplanting was harsh on spiritual plants, so to speed up recovery, he also nourished the bamboo with a specially formulated nutrient solution.  

With this, his duties as a Spiritual Farmer were complete for the day.  

Now, it was time for Swordsman Li Shiming’s training.  

*Sword Control Art* lived up to its reputation as the most expensive combat technique—it was a method honed purely for killing.  

With his fully refined *Blazing Flame Sword* in hand, he could still exert some control over it even when it left his grip, thanks to their deep spiritual connection. *Sword Control Art* amplified this connection, turning it into a precise and deadly skill.  

In the technique’s terminology, a fully refined sword was called a *Bound Weapon*. But full refinement wasn’t the end—it was only the beginning. Through practice, his bond with the *Blazing Flame Sword* would deepen further.  

If not for his current limitations—Qi Refinement third-layer cultivation, the incomplete refinement of his *Azure Kite Wooden Sword*, and the lack of a suitable metal-attribute sword—he wouldn’t have settled for the *Blazing Flame Sword*. Still, among his lower-grade sword artifacts, it was the best available.  

As for mid-grade swords, the ones from the Hao family—former rogue cultivators—were barely worth mentioning. Aside from slightly better materials, he had no interest in using them.  

What he didn’t know was that the *Blazing Flame Sword*’s superior quality came from its origins—it was an heirloom of the Shi family, crafted as a refined masterpiece for future generations.  

The sword shot from his hand in a flash, its blade a streak of light dancing around him under the guidance of *Sword Control Art*.  

For a moment, he felt like Elder Cui wielding his sword—though that was just his imagination. Still, *Sword Control Art* was the strongest swordsmanship technique for Qi Refinement cultivators in the sect, and practicing it had already given him the bearing of a true swordsman.  

Aside from a quick lunch of spirit rice, he spent the next four hours entirely on sword practice.  

IBMz15 constantly analyzed his movements, pointing out flaws and accelerating his progress.  

By dinnertime, Li Shiming returned to his cave abode, slipping through a hidden passage into an underground space.  

From the spirit spring, he caught two small fish and used the spring water to make a pot of fish soup. Paired with spirit rice, it was a satisfying meal.  

Lately, he had noticed that the spirit spring teemed with fish—the ones surfacing in the pond were just a fraction of their numbers. No matter how many he caught, their population never seemed to dwindle.  

But after discovering their true value, he no longer treated them as mere food.  

---  

After dinner, he immediately began practicing *Vajra Armor Divine Art*.  

Since consuming the spirit fish, his progress in the technique had skyrocketed, and his recovery period had shortened by a full day. Now, as long as he ate the fish before training, he could practice *Vajra Armor Divine Art* daily.  

According to IBMz15’s calculations, two spirit fish per session was the optimal amount—any more was wasteful, any less diminished the effects.  

He didn’t know how quickly the fish reproduced, nor whether overharvesting would drive them to extinction, so moderation was key.  

As the power of *Vajra Armor Divine Art* coursed through his body, he could already feel its effects—mundane blades no longer posed a threat. And this was just the beginning.  

Once he mastered the first layer, he would be able to withstand attacks from early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, even if they wielded lower-grade artifacts.  

This was his immediate goal. Without breaking through to the fourth layer of Qi Refinement, *Vajra Armor Divine Art* would plateau at the peak of the first layer.  

The spirit fish had become a perfect substitute for the medicinal herbs typically required by the technique. Not only were they more effective for recovery, but they also enhanced physical strength—something he could feel with every bite.  

Even an ordinary cultivator who didn’t practice body-refining techniques could strengthen their physique several times beyond their peers just by consuming these fish.
