# Chapter 34: First Arrival at Lingyun Sect

Lin Xuan gazed up at the precipitous Tianzhu Peak. According to Li Hai, the mountain gate of Lingyun Sect stood at its summit. While ordinary people couldn't possibly ascend, it posed no challenge for Lin Xuan.

Circulating his true essence, Lin Xuan activated the Wind Riding Technique, traversing cliffs and steep ridges as if walking on level ground, effortlessly making his way toward the mountaintop.

Though immortal techniques were miraculous, scaling five thousand meters still required time. Along the way, Lin Xuan spotted several figures flashing by—undoubtedly fellow cultivators attending the treasure exchange. He deliberately avoided them rather than striking up conversations. His purpose here was to acquire techniques, not expand his social circle. Engaging with strangers, especially those with formidable power and ill intentions, would only invite trouble. Better to avoid unnecessary complications.

After about half an hour, Lin Xuan reached the summit, only to find it shrouded in thick mist that obscured his vision. He smiled faintly. Despite being merely a Spirit Movement stage cultivator, he immediately recognized this as a rudimentary illusion array designed to disorient.

Strictly speaking, this array couldn't even be considered a proper restriction—it was too crude and basic. Even a first-stage Spirit Movement cultivator could nullify its effects by channeling spiritual energy to their eyes. Its primary purpose was to deter mortals. Though Tianzhu Peak was treacherous, mortal martial artists with proper tools might still ascend, hence this simple array to distinguish cultivators from ordinary folk.

Lin Xuan, now at mid-stage Spirit Movement, was naturally unaffected. Channeling spiritual energy from his dantian through his meridians to his eyes, the illusory mist dissipated, revealing a simple teleportation array.

"Simple" because this array could only transport users over short distances. However, it had the advantage of requiring minimal energy—no spirit stones were needed, just an infusion of spiritual power at the array's core.

Stepping onto the array, Lin Xuan extended his hand and channeled his spiritual energy. The intricate patterns around the array lit up, and the surroundings blurred into a white haze. When the phenomenon faded, Lin Xuan found himself in a new location—a spacious mountain hollow adorned with lush grass and blooming flowers, a scene of serene beauty.

"Fellow Daoist, are you here for the treasure exchange?" a voice called out.

Turning, Lin Xuan saw a young attendant dressed in Lingyun Sect robes. The young man's expression was bleak, his demeanor listless—understandable, given that he and his sect were being forced to disband and abandon their cultivation, reduced from lofty immortals to mere mortals. Though it was the only way to survive, the bitterness remained.

Putting on a brave face, the young cultivator handed Lin Xuan a jade slip. Seeing that every arriving cultivator received one, Lin Xuan accepted it without comment.

Finding a secluded spot beneath a large tree, Lin Xuan channeled his spiritual sense into the jade slip. Rows of text and images flooded his mind—details about the treasure exchange and its protocols, not cultivation techniques. His heart leaped when he confirmed that several intermediate techniques, including the Spirit Control Art, were available, though the descriptions were vague. Concealing his excitement, he withdrew his spiritual sense and pocketed the jade slip.

Following the instructions, Lin Xuan headed toward a cluster of buildings in the eastern part of the hollow. These small pavilions, once guest quarters for Lingyun Sect, now served as lodgings for visiting cultivators. Registration was mandatory for participation in the exchange.

"Name and sect?" asked the elderly registrar.

"Zhao Gang, rogue cultivator," Lin Xuan replied without hesitation, determined to conceal his true identity. The old man didn't bother verifying; instead, he channeled a faint white light from his fingertips, etching "Zhao Gang" on the front of an identity token and "Rogue" on the reverse.

"Here's your token for the duration of the event. Keep it safe."

The simple display revealed the old man's Foundation Establishment stage cultivation—impressive, yet his eyes were equally lifeless. Once the exchange concluded, he too would have to abandon his cultivation and return to mortality.

Lin Xuan marveled at the thought. A single Foundation Establishment cultivator was formidable, yet Lingyun Sect had over a dozen—and they were still being forced to disband. How powerful must a Core Formation cultivator be? Though his own sect leader at Piaoyun Valley was at that stage, Lin Xuan had only glimpsed him from afar during his initiation. Core Formation experts like Yunhe Zhenren spent most of their time in seclusion, and even when they emerged, lowly disciples like Lin Xuan had no chance to interact with them.

Suppressing his thoughts, Lin Xuan accepted the token and inspected his assigned room. It wasn't luxurious but was spacious and comfortable, with a privacy barrier that could only be deactivated using the identity token—allowing cultivators to rest and train without worry.

After surveying the room, Lin Xuan sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, not to cultivate but to recover his energy. Though his journey hadn't been rushed, continuous use of the Wind Riding Technique had drained him. An hour of meditation restored his spiritual energy, after which he retired to bed. The treasure exchange was still some time away; resting early would ensure he was at his peak when it began.
