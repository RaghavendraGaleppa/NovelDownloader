# Chapter 56: Master of Thunder

Han Yue decided to pour all the accumulated [Nectar] he had gathered during this period into the desiccated corpse's mouth—exactly thirty-five drops in total.  

These droplets of [Nectar] replenished a vast amount of life essence into the corpse. With this infusion of vitality, the withered body seemed to soak in water, gradually swelling slightly. Faint traces of flesh appeared beneath its skin, and its facial features slowly took on a more defined shape.  

At last, the corpse began to resemble something alive!  

After feeding it all the [Nectar], Han Yue paused to observe the corpse's reaction.  

Before long, the corpse suddenly opened its eyes—eyes that were strikingly clear, sharp, and full of life, completely unlike those of a deathly husk. They stared intently at Han Yue, brimming with urgency, longing, and impatience, as if questioning why he had stopped supplying the [Nectar].  

Since he had already begun aiding the corpse, Han Yue decided to see it through. He quietly began refining more [Nectar], feeding each drop directly into the corpse's mouth.  

The underground cavern was vast, filled with eerie gusts of wind. Only a faint beam of light trickled in from a small opening above. Under this dim glow, Han Yue continued his painstaking work, drop by drop.  

Upon seeing the renewed supply, the corpse closed its eyes again, slowly absorbing the nourishment. Its body gradually filled out, revealing the visage of a middle-aged man with refined features.  

The corpse—now no longer truly a corpse—had clearly been sealed here for countless years, its life essence drained to the brink. Han Yue remained patient, feeding it steadily. With the boundless vitality provided by the [Heavenly Origin Treasure Lotus], he only needed to invest time.  

Finally, after infusing over a thousand drops of [Nectar], the corpse opened its eyes once more.  

By now, it could no longer be called a corpse. It had regained the basic form of a human, though still gaunt.  

The emaciated man suddenly spoke. His newly restored vocal cords were rough and untrained, producing a strange, halting voice.  

"Which peak of the Divine Thunder Palace do you hail from? Your cultivation of the *Great Freedom Thunder Transformation Secret Scripture* is passable!"  

To Han Yue's surprise, the man had mistaken him for a disciple of the Divine Thunder Palace—a supreme sect located in the northern Lu Province of the Inner Realm, with a history stretching back over a hundred thousand years. It was a fifth-tier sect that had once produced a Celestial Realm grandmaster!  

Han Yue's mind raced as he replied, "Senior, I am not a disciple of the Divine Thunder Palace. The technique I cultivate is not the scripture you mentioned, but rather a chance-acquired body-refinement method called *Nourishing Thunder*."  

The middle-aged man gave him a surprised glance before speaking again.  

"*Nourishing Thunder* contains no method to form a Golden Core. How did you break through to the second rank and attain this treasure medicine's divine ability?"  

"Senior, I have not received any grand inheritance, nor have I formed a Golden Core. I’ve only just completed the third major cycle of *Nourishing Thunder* cultivation. The [Nectar] ability you mentioned was something I gained through another fortuitous encounter."  

The man stared at Han Yue for what felt like an eternity before finally speaking again.  

"I still need five hundred more drops of [Nectar]. I must trouble you further, young man."  

With that, he closed his eyes once more.  

Han Yue obediently resumed refining [Nectar]. This was the first time he had ever revealed his true cultivation level and techniques to an outsider—a secret most cultivators would guard jealously.  

But the mention of the Divine Thunder Palace, coupled with the man's ability to resonate with the thunder-based energy of *Nourishing Thunder*, had spurred Han Yue to take the gamble.  

This middle-aged cultivator had been sealed here with such elaborate measures for who knew how many centuries, yet he had not only survived but was now clawing his way back from the brink. He had to be at least a third-rank Divine Realm expert from the Divine Thunder Palace!  

Han Yue immediately recognized the potential opportunity. He continued assisting the man's recovery, confident that his investment of time and resources would not be in vain.  

As time passed, the man's life essence grew increasingly abundant. His body recovered swiftly, his muscles regaining definition.  

Finally, after Han Yue had refined the requested five hundred drops, the man waved for him to stop. Having absorbed nearly two thousand drops of [Nectar], his body had now recovered to a significant degree, no longer teetering on the edge of death.  

By Han Yue's estimate, he had spent over twenty days in this underground cavern aiding the man.  

The middle-aged man spoke again.  

"Young man, if you would, strike my chest with a bolt of your thunder-based energy, then retreat to a safe distance."  

Han Yue complied. With a flick of his golden blade, he sent a crackling arc of lightning into the man's chest before swiftly retreating to a corner of the cavern.  

The moment Han Yue's thunder energy entered the man's body, it was as if a dormant machine had been reconnected to its power source.  

Electric currents surged through the man's meridians, his body crackling with arcs of lightning. His long-deprived form drank in the energy greedily.  

Hidden within his heart was the man's life source—a sea of energy, the condensed essence of his cultivation. It was the foundation of his spiritual root, the infantile manifestation of his soul.  

After all this time, his core had been drained to the verge of collapse. Only a few divine seeds, cradled in the remnants of his spiritual infant, still flickered with faint energy.  

Among them, one seed—absorbing the thunder energy Han Yue had delivered—awakened from its slumber.  

The supreme divine ability: **[Master of Thunder]**—the authority to command lightning's might, unrivaled in destruction!  

For the first time in ages, the man began to wield the divine art he had once mastered.  

Han Yue felt an overwhelming killing intent rise within the cavern. The thunder energy in his own body stirred restlessly, as if yearning to break free.  

Meanwhile, outside the cavern—unseen by Han Yue—clouds began gathering in the sky, converging above the entrance.  

Soon, thick storm clouds blotted out the sun, casting the land into darkness. The oppressive weight of the gathering storm loomed like an impending siege.  

Vast amounts of primal energy surged into the clouds, condensing into a terrifying force. Flickers of eerie light danced within the storm.  

After a moment of gestation, the first thread of lightning was born.  

From this spark, primal energy transformed en masse into thunder. The heavens roared with the fury of the storm.  

Then—  

A colossal bolt of lightning split the sky, crashing down with earth-shattering force.  

The devastating energy tore through the cavern's ceiling, exposing the underground chamber to the open air before striking the middle-aged man squarely.  

Bathed in the lightning's radiance, his hair and beard bristled with energy.  

He stood like a god of thunder reborn.
