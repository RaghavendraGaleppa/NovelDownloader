# Chapter 21: The Ironthread Demon Worm  

Ning Jingming put away the flying boat, and the two of them tidied their appearances at the foot of the mountain. After ensuring they looked presentable, they began their ascent up the mountain path.  

For Wang Chan, this was his first time traveling so far to practice medicine, and he couldn’t help feeling a little excited.  

Initially, he had assumed Ning Jingming was simply taking him along to broaden his horizons and introduce him to fellow cultivators. Wang Chan had planned to keep a low profile, focusing mainly on networking while letting Ning Jingming take the lead.  

However, during their journey, Ning Jingming revealed that the resident of Qingzhu Mountain, Fellow Daoist Qu, had specifically requested Wang Chan’s presence. The situation was similar to the time they had treated Zhao Shanhe’s injuries—except this time, the patient wasn’t human but a mid-grade spirit beast:  

The Miaokong Crane.  

The Miaokong Crane was no ordinary creature. With its mid-tier bloodline, high intelligence, and striking appearance—its entire body a vibrant azure—it was renowned among avian spirit beasts for its speed. Even if an ordinary cultivator could afford to raise one, finding such a rare beast would be nearly impossible.  

As for the crane’s owner, a mid-stage Qi Refining loose cultivator, she was also a physician—an exceedingly rare one specializing in spiritual injuries. Her rank, however, shocked Wang Chan:  

A high-grade physician!  

A high-grade physician skilled in treating spiritual injuries!  

Not a single such figure could be found in the entire Black River Market. With such abilities, she would be highly respected even in White Mountain City. After all, few truly understood the intricacies of the soul.  

Logically, a loose cultivator of her caliber could easily gain residency in White Mountain City after a simple registration, with no need to linger in the wilderness. However, like Zhao Shanhe, she had recently arrived from the northern Blackwater City, and her background remained unclear. Thus, she had to undergo additional scrutiny before being allowed entry—which explained why she was still residing on Qingzhu Mountain.  

From a distance, Cave Abode No. 27 stood halfway up the mountain, where a woman in a water-blue daoist robe waited quietly by the entrance. The afternoon sunlight cast a warm glow over her, creating an almost serene and picturesque scene.  

Wang Chan and Ning Jingming paused at the sight.  

Wang Chan remained composed—though the woman was undeniably beautiful with an extraordinary aura, he was no less refined himself and felt little awkwardness.  

Ning Jingming, however, was another story. He adjusted his robes once more, cleared his throat softly, and seemed tense all over.  

"Are you Fellow Daoist Ning and Fellow Daoist Wang? This humble one is Qu Lian. Greetings."  

Her arched brows and oval face framed a graceful figure beneath the water-blue robe, undoubtedly on par with Madam Cheng’s allure. Yet, Wang Chan felt not the slightest trace of improper thoughts.  

As they drew closer, he noticed her clear, limpid eyes and pure, jade-like demeanor. Her polite bow and gentle smile radiated warmth, instantly putting them at ease.  

*What kind of life has this woman led? What kind of loose cultivator could cultivate such refined manners?*  

Wang Chan found it puzzling.  

Soon, Qu Lian invited them inside.  

Tea was served.  

Conversation flowed.  

Within the time it took an incense stick to burn, the three of them grew familiar, as if they were old friends reuniting after years apart.  

Only then did Qu Lian broach the topic of treatment.  

With a light clap of her hands, a ripple of spiritual energy emanated from the backyard.  

Moments later, a listless azure crane emerged—walking, not flying, its movements sluggish.  

In size, it resembled an ordinary white goose, but its aura was profound, tainted by an unsettling, sinister presence.  

*This is the Miaokong Crane?*  

*It’s so small—can it even be ridden?*  

Wang Chan nearly laughed at his own ignorance. *Perhaps this crane can alter its size at will.*  

Upon seeing strangers, the crane flinched, tucking its wings and pressing close to Qu Lian’s side, letting out a pitiful chirp.  

"Little Miao grew up with me. Though a spirit beast, she is like a sister to me. Recently, while foraging, she encountered an Ironthread Demon Worm on the verge of advancing to mid-grade. The worm latched onto her, embedding itself in her flesh like an unshakable parasite," Qu Lian explained softly, stroking the crane’s head.  

"Having heard of Fellow Daoist Ning’s [Righteous Sun Spell] and Fellow Daoist Wang’s [Five Needles Sealing Art], which are said to counter this demon worm, I took the liberty of inviting you. For your trouble, I’ve prepared a hundred spirit coins, which I shall present to you shortly."  

Ning Jingming and Wang Chan nodded slowly.  

House calls naturally commanded higher fees than in-clinic visits.  

For them, this was a rare, lucrative job—a hundred spirit coins was no small sum.  

But the Ironthread Demon Worm was no pushover.  

As its name suggested, the worm’s body was tough, flexible, and thread-like. It lurked in water, blending seamlessly into its surroundings before ambushing prey.  

Its unique physiology allowed it to strike with terrifying speed and force, piercing defenses and burrowing into flesh, where it would reside until it had consumed its host entirely.  

If attacked, the worm would writhe violently within its host, wreaking havoc—making it a nightmare to deal with.  

Most Ironthread Worms were unranked, and those nearing mid-grade were exceptionally rare.  

This would be their first encounter with one.  

Compared to the low-grade [Bone-Corroding Yin Wind] technique, the Ironthread Worm was a demonic beast—far harder to subdue. Five needles might not suffice; seven would likely be needed.  

"Fellow Daoist Qu, while Fellow Daoist Ning’s [Righteous Sun Spell] is mid-grade and thus more than capable, my [Revitalizing Needles] are only low-grade. Even with all five needles deployed, I may not fully suppress the worm," Wang Chan cautioned.  

"Fellow Daoist Wang underestimates himself," Qu Lian replied warmly. "Your [Revitalizing Needles] not only restore vitality but also possess sealing properties—their mysteries run deep. I’m certain you have more to offer."  

"You flatter me," Wang Chan said with a faint salute. The woman’s words were polished and diplomatic, but pretty phrases wouldn’t solve the problem.  

"I understand this will be a painstaking process, likely requiring significant energy," Qu Lian added, observing their expressions. "Thus, I’ve also prepared two low-grade Qi Restoration Talismans with fifteen layers of inscription."  

A standard low-grade Qi Restoration Talisman cost three spirit coins, with each additional layer adding another coin. Two such talismans amounted to thirty-six coins.  

"You’re too kind," Ning Jingming interjected. "We’ll do our utmost."  

An agreement was swiftly reached.  

Qu Lian first calmed the crane, then Wang Chan used his [Revitalizing Cloud Technique] to assess its qi and blood, pinpointing the worm’s location.  

To ensure success—and for the sake of the hundred coins and talismans—Wang Chan decided to employ the [Seven Needles Sealing Art] outright.  

With his black and white needles as backup, he could even resort to the [Nine Needles Sealing Art] if necessary.  

With a flick of his sleeve, seven silver needles shot forth, piercing the crane’s abdomen under his spiritual guidance.  

Withered-yellow sealing patterns spread like a net…  

Qu Lian, who had remained composed until now, blinked rapidly at the sight of the patterns, a flicker of delight crossing her face.  

Half an hour later…  

As golden light faded, a needle-sized hole appeared on the crane’s belly, and the black Ironthread Demon Worm slithered out.  

Qu Lian, prepared, summoned a crimson gourd that spewed black flames, incinerating the worm instantly.  

Meanwhile, Ning Jingming and Wang Chan, drained, gulped down spirit-restoring elixirs and began meditating.  

After an incense stick’s worth of time, they recovered slightly and performed a final checkup on the crane, concluding the procedure.  

The three reconvened for tea.  

True to her word, Qu Lian produced a jade box containing a hundred spirit coins, along with two pale-green Qi Restoration Talismans, their fifteen-layered inscriptions shimmering with potent energy.  

Ning Jingming took one talisman and fifty coins, then slid the remaining items to Wang Chan.  

When efforts were evenly split, Ning Jingming always divided rewards equally. His fairness toward capable partners was something Wang Chan greatly appreciated.  

Wang Chan stored the coins and jade box in his pouch, tucking the talisman into his sleeve.  

A single afternoon’s work had earned him sixty-eight spirit coins—equivalent to a year’s income in the past. The contrast left him sighing inwardly.  

While such opportunities were rare, the difference from his previous struggles for a single coin was stark.  

However, Qu Lian seemed preoccupied, and the tea session grew quiet.  

Noticing this, Ning Jingming exchanged a glance with Wang Chan and rose to take his leave.  

But Qu Lian suddenly looked up, her expression solemn.  

"As the saying goes, ‘one shouldn’t trouble two masters.’ I have another request for your assistance."  

"Speak freely," Ning Jingming said cautiously, sensing trouble but unwilling to leave abruptly after accepting her payment.  

Qu Lian retrieved a blood oath contract. "This matter is of great importance. If you’re willing to hear me out, please sign this first. Should we fail to reach an agreement afterward, you may take the payment and leave without obligation."  

She then placed another hundred spirit coins on the table—an advance.
