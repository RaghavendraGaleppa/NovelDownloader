# Chapter 578: A Close-Range Punch is Enough

Under these three layers of protection, Xu Yunfan was confident that as long as he wasn't specifically targeted by a True Lord, he should be able to move freely within the Heavenly Court.

*Hum!*

His figure flickered slightly in place, transforming into an afterimage that almost completely merged with the chaotic energies and ruins of the shattered Heavenly Court.

He moved at incredible speed, ignoring the collapsed palace ruins along the way and the burning immortal trees and spiritual roots in the distance. These had been caught in the aftermath of the True Lord's Dao Fruit power and were essentially worthless now.

He charged straight toward the direction where the spiritual energy fluctuations were most concentrated and pure.

Passing through a plaza covered in sword marks and scorched spell traces, Xu Yunfan even ran into a few Core Formation disciples from the Primordial Origin Sect, their eyes red as they fought a small group of surviving celestial soldiers. Sword qi and spell light crisscrossed, and the smell of blood was pungent.

These demonic sect disciples were truly bold, daring to venture so deep.

Xu Yunfan acted as if he hadn't heard a thing, like an invisible gust of wind instantly sweeping past the battlefield and rushing toward the massive palace complex in the rear. Even among the ruins, its majestic outline was hard to miss.

There, the spiritual energy was as thick as substance, even overpowering the lingering killing intent from the battlefield.

"Refining Hall!"

As he got closer, a whiff of medicinal fragrance reached his nose, and Xu Yunfan's heart stirred.

Looking closer, though the massive hall was also severely damaged—with large sections of glazed tiles shattered and a few vermilion dragon pillars toppled—its main structure was still relatively intact. The giant white jade gates at the front, carved with celestial bodies, auspicious beasts, and spirit mushrooms, had been blasted open, revealing a glimpse of the forest-like giant cauldrons deep inside, along with rising, dense medicinal qi mixed with a burnt smell and strange herbal fragrances.

His figure flashed, and he directly slipped into the hall through the gap.

The interior space was extremely vast, far exceeding its external appearance. Over a thousand dragon pillars supported the towering dome, but the celestial map painted on it had been damaged by the flames of war and was now dim. In the hall, thousands of cauldrons of varying sizes and materials were arranged according to some profound formation. Most of the fires had gone out, but a few cauldrons still glowed red, radiating scorching heat.

The warm jade tiles covering the ground were shattered everywhere, and in some places, strange-colored medicinal liquids had pooled. The air was filled with an overwhelming mix of medicinal fragrance, burnt smells, blood, and many other unidentifiable strange scents. Clearly, this place had also experienced intense fighting and looting not long ago.

Scattered on the ground were broken jade bottles, overturned shelves holding spiritual herbs and materials, and even a few bodies in alchemist robes. Their auras were faint, on the verge of death; they were clearly non-combatants. Xu Yunfan glanced at them and paid them no further attention.

Distant sounds of sporadic fighting could still be heard—fellow sect members or enemies who had rushed in first were still fighting over the spoils.

Xu Yunfan's gaze was sharp as lightning, and his spiritual sense swept through the area instantly. He locked onto several areas where spiritual light still flickered or the defenses were relatively intact.

One area near the back wall consisted of dozens of frost jade shelves carved with complex runes, on which lay scattered jade boxes and cases that hadn't been completely looted. There was a protective array here, and there wasn't time to break it, but for Xu Yunfan, formations were about understanding the principles of heaven and earth—a single insight grasps all. This was simply a boon for him.

He had arrived just in time.

In the center of the hall stood a purple-gold, ten-zhang-tall tripod with three legs. Although its temperature was extremely high, its mouth was shrouded in seven-colored clouds, and a strange fragrance continuously wafted from it. There was also a corner where a powerful formation had been forcibly broken, revealing a treasure niche embedded in the wall. The contents seemed to have been hastily taken, but a few items emitting formidable spiritual pressure were left behind: a yellow-skinned gourd, a green jade pot, and a fist-sized, seven-colored crystal that continuously changed shape.

These were all good things—natural treasures condensed within a world. The rank of this Heavenly Court's world was far superior to the Divine Martial World. It could孕育道果 (give birth to Dao Fruits), and even had True Lords who had proven the Dao. The natural treasures born here were extremely beneficial to Xu Yunfan.

*Swish, swish, swish!*

Xu Yunfan's movement technique reached its extreme, turning into afterimages. Ignoring the corners where fighting still raged, he charged straight for his targets. With a wave of his large hand, powerful magic power formed a suction force. The jade cases, jade bottles, the yellow-skinned gourd, the green jade pot, the seven-colored crystal, and several other scattered magic tool fragments or spiritual materials at his target locations were all swept up by an invisible giant hand and flew into his Sleeve Universe.

Just as he reached out to grab the purple-gold cauldron in the center of the hall...

*Swish!*

An extremely condensed sword light, carrying the sharpness to pierce through the void, shot out suddenly from behind a giant dragon pillar in the hall. The sword light was as thin as a hair, its color like autumn water or a cold pool, aiming straight for Xu Yunfan's back. Its speed was far faster than the sound of its approach.

The sword intent was chilling, instantly locking down the space in the narrow hall. An aura of heavenly calamity and absolute destruction rushed toward him, making the air seem to freeze.

The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect!

A Foundation Establishment sword cultivator who had refined the Chariot Throne Sword Seat.

Xu Yunfan's heart tightened, but he wasn't flustered. The sword light was fast, but not so fast that he couldn't react. Moreover, he hadn't let his guard down for a moment.

The environment here was cramped, with various cauldrons and spiritual materials creating obstacles.施展 spells was easy to affect oneself or attract greater attention. The opponent's attack was ruthless and precise, timed perfectly to strike when Xu Yunfan's mind was slightly divided as he collected the heavy treasures.

Xu Yunfan immediately activated his magic power, circulating the Profound Vault of the Nine Heavens' Divine Thunder Immortal Indestructible Scripture. This scripture was a direct lineage protective and combat method of the Jade Clear Dao lineage of the Primordial Origin Sect, truly a supreme combat method for battle and slaughter.

Cultivating this scripture was extremely demanding; it required drawing upon the nine layers of celestial thunderfire to temper the five viscera and six bowels, and channeling the heavenly metal killing qi of the universe to forge the bones, meridians, and marrow, ultimately tempering the physical body to a state of clarity and flawlessness, like divine iron forged by heaven.

Furthermore, it refined the skin to be like golden crystals, forged the bones to be like divine jade, transformed the viscera into thunder pools, and infused the blood with starflame.

With a raise of his hand, he could shatter divine thunder; with a thought from his brow, he could split mountains and peaks.

In such close quarters, this body, refined to the extreme and approaching the神通 of physical form, was the most terrifying weapon. It far surpassed the Daoist methods he usually used to defeat enemies.

The sword intent of the Chariot Throne Sword Seat had just risen, intending to lock onto him for a kill.

Xu Yunfan moved.

No hand seals or incantations, no magic power to activate a powerful spell.

He simply stomped his foot heavily on the warm jade floorboard.

*Crack!*

The sturdy warm jade floorboard exploded into powder under his foot like tofu.

In his original spot, his figure had already blurred. It wasn't teleportation, but the eruption of pure, unimaginable physical power. His speed broke past the limit of the naked eye, forcibly crashing through the layer of sword intent lock that carried the will of heavenly calamity and destruction.

The tip of the sword was pointing at his back.

But Xu Yunfan's body had vanished from its original location and appeared before the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect cultivator who had just emerged from behind the pillar.

The distance between the two, under the spiritual sense and speed of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, was even smaller than a hair in the eyes of a mortal.

"Huh?!"

The sword cultivator's pupils contracted sharply. He never expected the opponent to break his famous Chariot Throne Sword Intent lock in such a way, and to engage in such fierce close-quarters combat.

The blue cloud-patterned sword robe he wore instantly swelled, and his protective sword aura activated instinctively.
