# Chapter 220: Three Zhang of Self

Xu Yunfan raised his arm, looking at the dragon scale armor extending from his wrist. As he slightly tensed and relaxed his muscles, the scales swayed in response.

*Incredibly powerful!*

Although the "Lin" character incantation had suppressed most of the artifact's spirituality and diminished its might, it allowed him to control the armor freely, unlike the passive nature of the Golden Mace. Most importantly, every movement he made brought him immense strength amplification.

Faster. Stronger.

Xu Yunfan tapped his chest plate with a bent finger. The dark scales suddenly flared with dark golden patterns, like a sleeping flood dragon turning over under the moonlight. As he stretched his arms, countless inverted scales opened and closed simultaneously, producing a sound like a guzheng snapping its strings. The spirit of the Red Flood Dragon still whimpered deep within the scales, but it was firmly suppressed by the mental will formed by the Lin character incantation.

Xu Yunfan suddenly spun and threw a punch. A sonic boom exploded in the afterimage, and a visible shockwave blasted a large area of magma from the lava pool ahead. As he retracted his stance, his elbow guard scraped against a cave pillar. Five feet of thick Xuan Gang rock slid down diagonally like hot metal cutting through fat. Before the stone dust at the fracture could even rise, it was burned into green smoke by the murderous aura steaming off the armor.

Xu Yunfan understood immediately. The dragon scale armor no longer possessed any will to resist.

He immediately turned and donned the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer and the two Xuan Steel mechanism boxes. With a slight movement of his mind, the muscles on his back rippled slightly. The scales of the dragon armor expanded, extending by several inches to firmly lock into the slots of the mechanism boxes. He pulled at them slightly, but they didn't budge.

*Interesting. There must be many hidden wonders within this dragon scale armor.*

To Xu Yunfan, this Eighth Rank Divine Weapon had almost transcended the very concept of a divine weapon.

Zhan Yan walked up to Xu Yunfan with a look of amazement, wanting to touch it but hesitating.

Xu Yunfan smiled. "It's fine, Master. Go ahead and touch it. Just be careful of the scale blades."

Hearing this, Zhan Yan no longer held back. His rough fingers slowly brushed over the armor. Just a light touch left several scratches on his palms. He kept stroking the patterns of the dragon scale armor on Xu Yunfan's body, tears welling in his eyes.

"The Divine Weapon Ridge... we have finally brought out the final inheritance. Master, your disciple has fulfilled your lifelong wish."

Looking at Zhan Yan's expression of having no regrets in this life, Xu Yunfan knew that his master's heart had finally settled.

He couldn't help but sigh inwardly. After wasting away fifty or sixty years, Zhan Yan was now nearly ninety. Thirty years later, he had finally set down the heavy stone in his heart.

"Yunfan, you are excellent, truly excellent!"

"You two made me search quite thoroughly..."

The voice cut off abruptly. Qin Lie and Chu Mo, who had crashed through the red mist, appeared, along with the young master of the Daqian Yuwen family, Yuwen Chengji, whose white robes were purer than snow.

Seeing Zhan Yan running his hands over Xu Yunfan with an excited, lifelong-regret-free expression, Qin Lie's lips moved several times, but he remained silent and tightly shut his mouth. Beside him, Chu Mo's throat bobbed a few times. He suddenly recalled how, when he had first entered the Divine Weapon Ridge as a youth, Zhan Yan had forcefully insisted on scrubbing his back.

Chu Mo's gloomy expression twisted further, his hair standing on end as nameless rage boiled up.

"Zhan, you old dog! So this is your preference. No wonder you were so enthusiastic toward me back then."

Zhan Yan was stunned for a moment before reacting. He pulled his hand back as if electrocuted, then flew into a rage, the joy of meeting an old friend completely suppressed.

"Chu! Back when you were training and got whipped bloody by the Master, I kindly scrubbed your back and applied medicine for you. And this is how you see me?!"

His hair and beard bristled like an angry lion. Seeing the two men charging in with murderous intent, and the grim-faced Yuwen Chengji, Zhan Yan understood immediately. The two had defected. Lu Cheng and the others outside the Divine Weapon Ridge were likely dead.

"Where is Junior Brother Lu?"

Qin Lie raised his Yanling blade without a word.

Chu Mo sneered repeatedly, gripping his nine-section whip so tightly his knuckles turned white. He stared intently at the dragon scale armor on Xu Yunfan. He was first stunned, then his eyes grew brighter and brighter, an uncontrollable greed nearly bursting from his gaze.

Yuwen Chengji also stared fixedly at the dragon scale armor on Xu Yunfan. His eyes darted about, his expression first one of wild joy, then followed by a hint of anger.

"You dare wear this precious armor?"

How could he not see that the armor was a Divine Weapon. Divine weapons in the world are mostly weapons; precious armor is incredibly rare, worth three weapon-class divine weapons.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow and slightly lifted his chin, making a throat-cutting gesture without a word.

Yuwen Chengji's expression was filled with undisguised killing intent and impatience.

"Seize the precious armor! Seize it!!"

"Lin."

Without the slightest hesitation, Xu Yunfan formed the Lin character seal with one hand.

The moment the seal was formed, the chaotic emotions in his mind quickly calmed. His own emotions were completely flat, his eyes like a stagnant pool, reflecting Qin Lie and Chu Mo like a clear mirror. The turbulent waves of distracting thoughts in his sea of consciousness seemed to be suppressed by his revived Self-God sitting in the center.

Both Qin Lie and Chu Mo were Bone Marrow Cleansing Grandmasters. Although Xu Yunfan now possessed the dragon scale armor and the Lin character incantation had reached minor completion, he was still only at the Muscle Refining realm.

Crossing two major realms to fight, he had to go all out to stand a chance.

The Hyper-Sense state quietly expanded once more. Within a radius of three Zhang, every movement was clear to him.

Xu Yunfan touched the Golden Mace, then the next moment grabbed the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in reverse grip.

In this state, he wanted to test things out. The Golden Mace was not under his control and consumed too much Qi and blood. With the dragon scale armor, he had enough time to switch weapons.

His right heel ground the obsidian beneath his feet into dust. The bronze hue unique to the Xuan Steel Hundred-Forge Body spiraled from his lower back up to his shoulder blades. He shot forward like a cannonball, arriving in an instant.

Just as Qin Lie's Yanling blade was about to strike his face, three inches away, Xu Yunfan's fingers suddenly tapped the end of the hammer handle. The seven-foot Thunderfire Qilin Hammer rose like a venomous dragon, its head precisely jamming into the third blood groove of the Yanling blade.

*Clang!*

Sparks flew as the blade scraped against the hammer face. Qin Lie's pupils constricted. The vibration from the blade had yet to reach his tiger's mouth when Xu Yunfan's left knee was already thrusting toward his lower abdomen. This knee strike contained the spiral force amplified by the dragon scale armor; as the scales opened and closed, the fabric of his pants was burned to ash by the heat radiating from the armor.

*Terrifying strength. And that spiral force... I can't dissolve it at all. I have to take it with my body!*

Qin Lie retreated violently three steps, leaving three-inch-deep magma footprints with each step. His face flushed red, and veins bulged on his forehead.
