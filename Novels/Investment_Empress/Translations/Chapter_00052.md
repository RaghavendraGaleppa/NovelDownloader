Chapter 52: Murong Xiao: "This doesn't feel right."

Lǐ Mò swept his gaze over the purple-robed elder before slightly bowing. "Your junior greets the master of the Murong household."

Murong Hai stroked his beard and smiled. "Please, take a seat."

The surrounding guests began to whisper among themselves. "This must be the Xuanbing Chixiao."

"It seems that with the arrival of Qingyuan Sect's representatives, there will be two more Sword Immortals."

The purple-robed elder chuckled, not displaying any airs of a mansion master.

The Great Yu Dynasty was, of course, the overlord of the world. However, in reality, apart from the Central Divine Continent, the rest of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands were governed by various sects. It was somewhat similar to the feudal system of the previous era. The Great Yu was like the Zhou Dynasty, while the sects were akin to the vassal states, each ruling over their own territories.

Lǐ Mò had read historical records and knew that this was not how it was in the past. It was truly "all land under heaven belongs to the king." Later, the Martial Emperor of the Yu Dynasty rose to power, promising to share governance with the sects after achieving success, and garnered numerous responses, ultimately changing the fate of the world.

However, nominally, the sect masters were still on an equal footing with the masters of the households. Lǐ Mò did not neglect his manners.

After some small talk, as the afternoon approached, the mansion hosted a banquet.

The tables were filled with an assortment of delicacies, including dishes made from flying, walking, and swimming creatures. Each person was accompanied by a beautiful servant girl.

"Xiao, while I'm watching, don't slack off in Qingyuan Sect," Murong Hai said as he pulled his grandson closer, sensing something unusual. "This doesn't seem to be the cultivation method from the Shenbing Peak."

Murong Xiao smiled awkwardly. "Brother Lǐ gave it to me, but I haven't even started learning it yet."

The grandfather-grandson duo exchanged a glance, the former looking somewhat hesitant and the latter seeking reassurance with a hint of embarrassment.

Lǐ Mò smiled and didn't mind. "It's fine to show it to your grandfather. It's not like borrowing from a library; there's no need to worry about it being leaked."

Murong Xiao then handed over the scripture.

As Murong Hai, his eyes narrowed, and the light in his eyes grew brighter as he read. "The Golden Bell Shield..."

He was also a martial practitioner at the Observing God Realm and immediately recognized that this was a Buddhist-inclined body-tempering cultivation method. Not only could it temper the body, but it could also eliminate distracting thoughts and purify the mind. It was perfect for Xiao.

In fact, he had been searching for similar martial arts, but to no avail. The Golden Bell Shield was precious, even among top-notch martial arts.

"Lǐ Xiaoyou, this cultivation method is precious, and one shouldn't transmit it lightly..."

"I've interacted with Murong brother quite a bit, and the Golden Bell Shield suits him perfectly," Lǐ Mò said, understanding Murong Hai's hesitation. "It's also a way to find a successor for this martial art; otherwise, it might be lost forever."

Lǐ Mò saw that Murong Hai was hesitant because sects, big or small, guarded their martial arts closely and prohibited external transmission. Stealing martial arts and getting caught could result in severe consequences, including being killed or having one's martial arts crippled.

The old man was worried about the origins of the martial art.

Upon hearing Lǐ Mò's explanation, Murong Hai's brow finally relaxed. He hadn't heard of any major sect renowned for this particular top-notch martial art. However, he was certain that Lǐ Mò had a deep understanding of Xiao, including his bloodline.

"Lǐ Zhenchuan's blessings are not shallow; perhaps he encountered a high-ranking expert's inheritance?" Murong Hai asked after a long silence.

"Something like that," Lǐ Mò replied with a slight nod.

"The great恩 of transmission, the Murong household will remember it," Murong Hai said with a warm smile. "Since Lǐ Xiaoyou has come to Ziyang Mansion City, please stay for a few more days, and let us fulfill our duties as hosts."

He then looked at his grandson. "Xiao, from now on, treat Lǐ Xiaoyou as your elder brother, understood?"

He didn't know who was older between the two, but it didn't matter. The person before him, Lǐ Zhenchuan, not only had great talent but also knew how to conduct himself; he would not remain ordinary in the future. Such a person would likely become a high-ranking member of Qingyuan Sect, possibly even the sect master. Even without the transmission, it was worth building a good relationship.

Murong Xiao nodded vigorously.

"Do I need your reminder, Grandfather?"

"You and Xiao went down the mountain; you must be here to execute a sect mission, right?" Murong Hai asked.

"Yes, Grandfather. I need to find ten stalks of Shengxue grass, and Brother Lǐ is here to capture the culprit Cui Peng," Murong Xiao replied.

"Cui Peng..." Murong Hai stroked his beard, lost in thought.

The purple-robed elder seemed to have some impression of this person. "He was once a disciple of the Golden Sun Blade Sect but later defected and became a bandit. After fleeing to Ziyang Mansion, he killed some yamen runners, so the matter was reported to Qingyuan Sect."

As the mansion master, he was only responsible for the common people. Matters concerning martial practitioners were handled by Qingyuan Sect.

"I'll send people to inquire about it," Murong Hai said.

"If Lǐ Zhenchuan needs any help, please don't hesitate to ask," he added.

For him, capturing an internal breath realm bandit was not a significant task.

Lǐ Mò didn't stand on ceremony. "I actually have one more thing, but it's a personal matter."

"Go ahead and say it," Murong Hai encouraged.

"I have a family rule that requires me to perform charitable deeds once a year. I was wondering if I could borrow some manpower to set up a charity hall in the city to distribute porridge and rice..."

Lǐ Mò's intention was to help Bing Tuozzi find people. The best way to do this was to distribute food, as Bing Tuozzi said that the person they were looking for was likely living in poverty. Once they heard about the charity, they would probably come. Then, Lǐ Mò could sit there with his Heavenly Mandate Divine Eye, waiting for the other party to come to him.

Moreover, this would be a great opportunity to invest in good deeds.

Although there might not be significant gains, "even a leg of a mosquito is meat."

"Lǐ Xiaoyou, having such a kind heart is truly commendable," Murong Hai said, slapping the table. "Bring more wine; I want to drink with Lǐ Xiaoyou!"

The atmosphere at the banquet became increasingly harmonious and lively.

"Lǐ Xiaoyou, I toast you!"

"Cheers!"

"Lǐ Xiandi, another cup!"

"I'm with you!"

"Lǐ Laodi, you're quite the drinker!"

"Older brother, you're flattering me."

Watching the old and young duo drinking and chatting enthusiastically, Murong Xiao was perplexed. "This doesn't feel right."

As the mansion master excused himself and walked out, he glanced at Lǐ Mò with a narrowed gaze. The inheritance that caused the rosy glow wasn't on him...
