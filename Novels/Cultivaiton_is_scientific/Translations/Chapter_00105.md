# Chapter 105: Law Enforcement  

Most tasks for junior formation masters were requests from Qi Refining disciples—some needed their cave dwellings' defensive formations strengthened, others required custom formations, and some were fellow junior formation masters seeking solutions to complex formation problems.  

The Qi Refining disciples who could issue such tasks were all powerful late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators within the sect, with ample spirit stones and merit points.  

Li Shiming noticed that most rewards were in spirit stones, with very few tasks offering merit points.  

It was unclear whether merit-based tasks were prioritized or if Qi Refining disciples were simply reluctant to offer merit points as rewards.  

However, all formation-related problems posted by fellow junior formation masters were exclusively rewarded with merit points.  

Additionally, there was a long-term sect task—maintaining the sect's grand formation—that also paid merit points, offering as much as 500 per month.  

To put it in perspective, a junior spirit farmer could toil for an entire year and earn less than 300 merit points, while a junior formation master could earn 500 merit points for just one month's work—and this was a recurring task.  

If a junior formation master was willing, they could easily accumulate a substantial amount of merit points by repeatedly taking this task.  

Li Shiming almost began fantasizing about amassing a fortune in merit points and freely selecting treasures from the Scripture Pavilion.  

But his dreams were quickly shattered when he saw the exchange list available to junior formation masters.  

Every piece of formation knowledge and material within the sect required merit points to acquire. Given the exorbitant costs, he suspected the sect deliberately inflated the merit rewards for formation masters—otherwise, no one could afford these resources.  

Junior formation masters indeed earned a lot, but they also spent a lot.  

Unless one had no intention of advancing further, it was possible to hoard merit points. However, once a formation master reached the intermediate level, their ability to earn merit points would increase, and their status within the sect would rise.  

What formation master could resist such temptation? Who would willingly ignore vast troves of formation knowledge and materials instead of studying and experimenting with them?  

Just as Li Shiming was considering which task to take first to earn some merit points, his defensive formation was triggered.  

He moved to the activation point and saw five late-stage Qi Refining disciples in law enforcement robes standing outside on a flying boat.  

"May I ask what business you have here, Senior Brothers?" Li Shiming asked, inwardly startled. Law enforcement officers reported directly to the sect leader and were part of the Central Peak's disciplinary apparatus.  

Normally, law enforcement officers were responsible for apprehending sect law violators and rarely interacted with ordinary disciples.  

"Open the island's defensive formation. We need to conduct an inspection," the lead law enforcement officer said sternly.  

---  

"Sect law dictates that a disciple's cave dwelling is private property and cannot be violated!" Li Shiming did not deactivate the formation despite their status. Instead, he responded firmly.  

His time as a newcomer hadn't been wasted—he knew the sect's laws inside out.  

Even law enforcement officers had no right to enter his cave dwelling without an official sect order.  

A cultivator's cave dwelling was their most sacred space.  

"This is an order from the sect leader. Are you refusing to comply?" The law enforcement officer's expression turned icy as he produced a command token.  

Li Shiming narrowed his eyes. The officer had deliberately withheld the token earlier—clearly, this man had malicious intentions.  

Without another word, he deactivated the defensive formation.  

Resisting an officer with a command token was unwise. If a conflict arose, he would be at a disadvantage.  

"Hmph!" The lead officer snorted as he stepped off the flying boat, passing by Li Shiming with a cold glare.  

Another officer followed, while the remaining three stayed aboard the vessel.  

They were experienced enforcers. If Li Shiming truly posed a threat and somehow managed to eliminate two late-stage Qi Refining officers in an instant, the three on the boat could immediately report back to the sect.  

"Our search is for your own good. A peak Qi Refining disciple from the Holy Ice Sect has gone missing. If he's hiding here and we find him, you might even receive a reward," the second officer explained, seemingly more reasonable.  

Li Shiming didn't buy it. He had witnessed the commotion earlier—Elder Quan's imposing presence suggested something far more serious.  

The mention of the Holy Ice Sect clarified Baili Jinyan's origins, and the foreign elder was likely from that sect.  

However, he didn't know the relationship between that elder and Baili Jinyan. The Holy Ice Sect was presumably far from the Heavenly Sea Sect—why would an elder travel such a distance for a mere Qi Refining disciple?  

The lead officer immediately noticed the Rune Bamboo upon entering Eagle Beak Island.  

He clearly recognized it, his eyes flashing with greed.  

The Rune Bamboo was still in its growth phase. Once fully matured, it would form a small bamboo grove.  

Even disregarding its other uses, the bamboo leaves alone could generate over 500 spirit stones per month.  

For any Qi Refining cultivator, 500 spirit stones a month was a substantial income.  

If one didn't want to manage it personally, hiring a junior spirit farmer for a small fee would allow them to sit back and collect the profits.  

As he pondered this, his gaze shifted to the spirit fields.  

"When did these fields get upgraded to high-grade low-tier?" he wondered, startled.  

His records showed that Eagle Beak Island had been leased to Li Shiming, a newcomer who had only recently joined the sect.  

Because Li Shiming was a junior spirit farmer, he qualified for a cave dwelling with spirit fields.  

The records indicated that the island's five acres of fields were low-grade low-tier—this couldn't be wrong.  

In other words, Li Shiming had upgraded the fields after leasing them.  

The lead officer's greed flared again. High-grade low-tier fields could produce nearly double the yield of low-grade low-tier fields for spirit rice.  

According to the records, leasing Eagle Beak Island would allow someone to secure a cave dwelling with high-grade low-tier fields and Rune Bamboo for the price of low-grade fields.  

Of course, the first step was dealing with Li Shiming.  

A measly fourth-layer Qi Refining cultivator like him could be handled in countless ways.  

But the cunning officer had no intention of framing Li Shiming outright. Instead, he planned to share part of the profits to curry favor with his superior.  

Li Shiming sensed the malice radiating from the lead officer and found it strange. How could someone with such a petty temperament become a law enforcement officer?  

All he had done was refuse immediate entry—was that enough to provoke such hostility?  

"Li Shiming, when did you break through to the fourth layer of Qi Refining? Why didn't you report it to the sect?" the lead officer demanded, turning to face him.  

Records showed Li Shiming had only recently reached the third layer. With his triple spiritual root aptitude, it was impossible for him to advance so quickly without extraordinary circumstances.  

This discrepancy could be exploited.  

"I just broke through to the fourth layer. Moreover, I've never seen any sect law requiring disciples to report their Qi Refining progress," Li Shiming replied calmly.  

It was clear the officer was deliberately provoking him.  

Though this enforcement team consisted of five late-stage Qi Refining disciples, they were only 200 li from the sect's nine peaks. He wasn't worried about them attacking him without cause.  

A day earlier, he might have been intimidated. But now, as a junior formation master—a rare and valued profession within the sect—he was no longer someone to be trifled with.  

At the very least, any action against him would require justification, lest the Formation Peak take issue.  

In truth, if Li Shiming revealed his status as a junior formation master now, the officers wouldn't dare target him.  

But his new status had only just been registered, and the Formation Peak's records needed time to sync with the sect's grand formation.  

According to the officers' information, Li Shiming was still just a junior spirit farmer.  

The lead officer glared coldly, as if trying to intimidate Li Shiming, but he remained unfazed.  

With a disdainful snort, the officer gestured to his subordinate and stepped aside to retrieve his identity jade slip.  

---  

At the Central Peak's Law Enforcement Hall, Xu Peiran leisurely sipped spirit tea.  

Many Foundation Establishment cultivators disdained power, fearing that administrative duties would hinder their cultivation.  

But Xu Peiran was different. Since joining the Law Enforcement Hall, he had exploited every opportunity to amass wealth.  

Even if he wasted a decade in the hall, the resources he gathered would allow him to attempt a breakthrough to mid-Foundation Establishment. He might even surpass his peers.  

"Elder Xu, there's a newcomer whose cave dwelling has Rune Bamboo. Once it matures, it could generate at least 500 spirit stones per month," Xu Peiran received a message from Han Tianlei, one of his subordinates.  

Xu Peiran was well aware of his subordinates' schemes—he had been a Qi Refining cultivator himself and understood the struggle for resources.  

But Han Tianlei had one redeeming quality: he didn't hoard benefits and always shared with his superior.  

"Han Tianlei, what's your plan?" Xu Peiran replied.  

"The kid just broke through to the fourth layer. We can assign him a suicide mission, and I'll take over the cave dwelling to present to you," Han Tianlei explained his scheme.  

Xu Peiran, ever the fox, pulled out his identity jade slip and checked Li Shiming's records.  

A newcomer from Great Xia with no backing, some minor luck in cultivation that allowed him—a triple spiritual root—to stand out among the survivors of the recent attack.  

In previous recruitment cycles, Li Shiming wouldn't have been noteworthy.  

Precisely because of this, the current batch of newcomers hadn't attracted much attention from the nine peaks—not a single one had been taken in by a Foundation Establishment elder.  

"I'll grant you the authority. Handle it cleanly," Xu Peiran ordered sternly before adding, "You'll keep half the profits."  

He knew better than to monopolize gains. Doing so would ruin his reputation and deter future subordinates from aligning with him.  

Besides, Han Tianlei would handle the cave dwelling—a dignified Foundation Establishment elder and Law Enforcement Hall officer couldn't dirty his hands personally.  

Meanwhile, Han Tianlei smirked triumphantly.  

By offering half the Rune Bamboo profits and omitting the spirit fields, he ensured Xu Peiran—who wouldn't care about spirit rice income—wouldn't suspect anything.  

Though high-grade low-tier fields yielded less than Rune Bamboo, the profits were still substantial for a Qi Refining cultivator.  

Han Tianlei would keep half the bamboo profits plus all the field income—effectively the lion's share.  

Even though he was doing all the work while Xu Peiran merely provided authority, Han Tianlei knew he needed his superior's backing to thrive in the Law Enforcement Hall.  

"Li Shiming, due to your failure to report your advancement to mid-Qi Refining, Hall Officer Xu has issued a mandatory mission for you. Here is the order," Han Tianlei declared coldly.  

Knowing Li Shiming was well-versed in sect laws, he had ensured everything was by the book, using Xu Peiran's authority to issue the compulsory task.  

Li Shiming's identity jade slip received the order. Frowning, he found it highly unreasonable.  

Even after advancing to mid-Qi Refining, a cultivator needed time to stabilize their realm—combat prowess didn't emerge instantly but required gradual refinement.  

Yet Hall Officer Xu had forcibly assigned him a dangerous mission. Why? He couldn't fathom the reasoning.  

It wasn't his fault—he didn't realize the immense value of Rune Bamboo. He had planted it for personal use, not profit.  

As a self-sufficient talisman maker, the bamboo provided his paper, eliminating the need for external purchases.  

In terms of value, his spirit tea tree far surpassed the bamboo.  

What Li Shiming didn't consider was that the Hao Clan had thrived among rogue cultivators precisely because of their Rune Bamboo.  

The clan supported seven cultivators and trained the next generation solely on bamboo profits—proof of its worth to Qi Refining cultivators.  

Since entering the cultivation world, Li Shiming had never truly lacked spirit stones—at least by ordinary Qi Refining standards.  

Of course, he still felt poor when eyeing luxury items like flying boats, which exceeded his current means.  

He still had nearly 2,000 spirit stones on hand, and Baili Jinyan's storage bracelet—yet to be opened—would surely contain more.  

His need for spirit stones was sporadic, so he hadn't bothered exploiting the bamboo's full potential.  

"I'll pack up and head out shortly," Li Shiming reluctantly accepted the mission, glancing around his cave dwelling.  

"What is there to pack? Leave immediately, or I'll arrest you for obstructing justice and take you to Hall Officer Xu!" Han Tianlei snapped, refusing to give him any time.
