# Chapter 12: The Blue Family and the Azure Crane

The stars shifted across the sky as the moon faded and the sun emerged.  

The melodious tolling of a bell broke the night's tranquility within the Qingfeng Dao Academy. Streaks of light cut across the sky as cultivators shuttled endlessly between the islands, marking the beginning of another day of cultivation.  

The vast marshland where Qingfeng Dao Academy was located was known as the Nine Rivers Marsh—boundless and nearly as expansive as the sea. The islands surrounding Qingfeng Mountain were too numerous to count.  

Most of these islands lay outside the academy's grand protective formation, serving as settlements for affiliated noble families and commoners. The true core islands, though not numerous, were scattered densely, numbering several dozen in total.  

Among them, the Hidden Dragon Pavilion oversaw three islands: White Egret Island, Azure Light Island, and Golden Origin Island.  

These three islands were classified into different tiers based on their spiritual energy density. White Egret Island had the weakest spiritual energy and was typically used by cultivators below the fifth level of Qi Refining. Azure Light Island was slightly better, reserved for those above the fifth level.  

As for Golden Origin Island, it boasted the richest spiritual energy and was usually inhabited by disciples at the ninth level of Qi Refining or those from noble families with the backing of senior mentors.  

Yet today, the least spiritually dense White Egret Island was the most lively.  

Early in the morning, over a dozen disciples arrived in haste, riding various magical artifacts and gathering atop a mountain peak, startling a flock of egrets into flight.  

These disciples were not particularly strong, mostly hovering around the fourth level of Qi Refining, with four green leaves embroidered on the cuffs of their robes. However, their expressions carried a sense of boldness and unrestraint, as if they were particularly fond of "gambling."  

"Senior Brother Yang, you came too? Isn't the spiritual energy on Azure Light Island better than here? Why bother joining this commotion?"  

Among the crowd, a scar-faced disciple at the fourth level of Qi Refining curiously asked the only fifth-level senior brother standing at the center.  

Senior Brother Yang was tall but gaunt, as if malnourished, his face pale. Yet his smile carried a roguish charm.  

"Haha, no need for pretenses among fellow disciples. The three caves on this mountain once belonged to the Three Heroes of the Tang Sect fifteen years ago. Rumor has it they left behind a soul cultivation technique and a vial of 'Celestial Silver Water'—both quite valuable. Isn't that why everyone's here today?"  

Seeing Senior Brother Yang speak so bluntly, the other disciples fell silent. After a moment, the scar-faced junior brother forced a bitter smile.  

"Senior Brother Yang, you’ve already broken through to the fifth level and mastered soul perception. The 'Celestial Silver Water' is useless to you. Why compete with us juniors?"  

"Besides, isn't it against the rules for a fifth-level cultivator to reside on White Egret Island?"  

Emboldened by the crowd behind him, the scar-faced junior dared to challenge the senior brother.  

Senior Brother Yang merely sneered. "Against etiquette, perhaps, but not against the academy's laws. The rules never explicitly forbid fifth-level cultivators from staying on White Egret Island."  

At this, the juniors cursed inwardly.  

*This shameless bastard! Can't compete with the senior brothers above the fifth level, so he comes to snatch resources from us juniors?*  

But there was no defense against sheer shamelessness.  

Seeing Senior Brother Yang's obstinacy, the juniors could only concede. "Then we wish you good luck!"  

Only one of the three caves contained the legacy, and each person could choose only one. There was still a chance for the others.  

Yet unease gnawed at them.  

*Could Senior Brother Yang be the first claimant?*  

Most gathered here were commoners without mentors, drawn by rumors of the "Celestial Silver Water" that could aid in breaking through to the fifth level.  

But the allocation of caves was decided by the Personnel Hall.  

Though the academy's rules stated that two spirit stones were enough to inherit a cave—provided no one else contested it—priority was given on a first-come, first-served basis.  

And "first-come, first-served" left much room for manipulation.  

For over ten days, the Personnel Hall had refused to accept applications, fueling suspicions.  

*Could someone with connections have already secured a cave?*  

*Is the Personnel Hall waiting for the "first applicant" to appear?*  

*And is that first applicant Senior Brother Yang?*  

Yet even Senior Brother Yang was uncertain.  

Two days prior, he had brought twenty spirit stones to apply but was denied entry to the Personnel Hall.  

This left him both curious and resentful, prompting him to arrive early today.  

*Even if I'm not the first, if luck favors me and the first claimant picks the wrong cave while I get the right one, the technique and the Celestial Silver Water would be worth over forty spirit stones. Not a bad deal.*  

Just then, a deep, rolling thunder echoed from beyond White Egret Island.  

A majestic, winged steed clad in lightning galloped through the sky.  

Seated atop it was a silver-haired youth in armor, his features strikingly handsome, with faintly blue eyes that gave him an exotic air.  

His cultivation, however, was only at the fourth level of Qi Refining.  

Ahead of him, on a silver skiff, Qiu Mingshan frowned as if troubled by something.  

"Elder Qiu is here! Who's that youth beside him?"  

"A thunder-steed, silver hair, blue eyes—he must be from the Blue Family of Ten Thousand Thunder Island!"  

"A noble scion?"  

"Indeed, and from a major lineage at that. The Blue Family was once one of the seven great clans of our academy. Though they've declined, I heard a Blue disciple joined one of the seven major sects years ago and is now at the late Foundation Establishment stage."  

As the disciples whispered, they pieced together the newcomer's identity.  

*Could he be Elder Qiu's chosen first claimant?*  

Senior Brother Yang studied the silver-haired youth with suspicion.  

*Even if the Blue Family has declined, a starved camel is still bigger than a horse. If I happen to pick the cave with the technique and the Celestial Silver Water, wouldn’t that incur their wrath?*  

*Wait—the Blue Family may have fallen, but they still have Foundation Establishment elders. Why would they bother with a mere fourth-level Qi Refining resource? The spiritual energy here isn’t even as good as on Ten Thousand Thunder Island!*  

*Unless... there’s something else hidden in these caves?*  

His heart raced at the thought.  

*If I claim the right cave, the opportunity could be mine! Even if I can’t keep it, trading it to the Blue Family would surely bring immense rewards!*  

Lost in his fantasies, he barely noticed Elder Qiu’s troubled expression as the elder turned to the youth.  

"Junior Brother, are you certain the 'Azure Crane Spirit Water' is in one of these caves?"
