# Chapter 117: My Master is Merciful, Offering You Three Choices!

Gao Xuan, also known as Third Master Gao, was a practitioner at the True Qi realm, not even at its peak. Yet, this man became the sole survivor of the Tianxing Cave Heaven? Moreover, even the Grand Elder of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, a being at the Human Immortal level, couldn't subdue this aging True Qi realm practitioner, Gao Xuan, and was instead repelled by him?

"What kind of opportunity did Gao Xuan obtain within the Tianxing Cave Heaven that allowed him, at the True Qi realm, to repel a Human Immortal?" Yuan Zhengfeng was equally astonished. He had once been a Human Immortal himself, also from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect! Li Zhengjing was the only person he had seen who could defeat a Human Immortal while still at the True Qi realm. But that was because Li Zhengjing possessed the "Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison Suppression Technique," enabling him to mobilize his Human Immortal-level power. So, how did Gao Xuan become the sole survivor of the Tianxing Cave Heaven? What kind of opportunity allowed him, a mere mortal, to repel a transcendent Human Immortal?

"..."

Everyone was stunned by this news.

The descent of the Tianxing was no longer a secret, but what it signified remained unknown. Currently, various factions only knew that the site of the Tianxing's descent had formed a cave heaven, but what lay inside was still a mystery. For this reason, the Great Zhou Dynasty had dispatched personnel to explore the Tianxing Cave Heaven nearest to the Central Province in the south.

"Even deities fell within it, yet this Third Master Gao escaped?" Li Zhengjing stroked his chin, pondering. "Why is he hunting down descendants of the Gao family and absorbing their bloodline?"

"About that, we don't know," the Great Zhou commander said quietly. "Since emerging from the Tianxing Cave Heaven, Third Master Gao's abilities have skyrocketed. The capital wants to know what exactly happened inside the Tianxing Cave Heaven..."

Li Zhengjing said lightly, "And also what kind of opportunity allowed a True Qi realm practitioner to repel a Human Immortal?"

The Zhou commander didn't respond, his expression unchanged.

At this moment, Li Zhengjing's gaze swept over the crowd. Everyone looked uneasy, their thoughts in turmoil.

"Members of the Gao family will stay here," Li Zhengjing said. "The rest of you may leave."

The Zhou commander's expression shifted. "This is the capital's—"

Before he could finish, Li Zhengjing said indifferently, "Report back to the capital that I am holding these Gao family members. If anyone disagrees, they can come find me here!"

"Whether it's the State Preceptor, the Divine Generals, the Founding Princes, or the court's righteous deities—if anyone wants to take these Gao family members from me, Li Zhengjing, they must come to Hongshan Town first!" He waved his hand. "Is that clear enough?"

The Zhou commander's face darkened, a mix of emotions rising in his heart. He was furious because the other party didn't take him seriously at all, not even the Human Immortals and deities in the Great Zhou court. He was also envious—how had this youth, whom he hadn't even considered worth noticing a few months ago, now risen so high as to look down on him? He even felt a sense of injustice—why had the heavens bestowed such extraordinary talent on an unknown like Li Zhengjing, granting him such formidable power?

"As the Immortal Venerable commands!" The Zhou commander finally bowed and turned to leave.

The Blood Sword Practitioner and the peak True Qi elder each gave Li Zhengjing a deep look, committing this legendary figure to memory before departing.

The atmosphere in the courtyard grew heavy. The Gao family members were uneasy. They now knew that the young man before them was the youngest Human Immortal in the world—a prodigy who had cultivated for only a short time, slain numerous evil path experts, escaped unscathed from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's territory after being framed, and saved over a thousand practitioners in the capital, his name spreading far and wide.

The Great Zhou court had sought to capture them, but now they were in the hands of Immortal Venerable Zhengjing. How would he deal with them?

Their eyes were filled with fear, their hearts unsettled.

Shi Yuan bowed, about to speak, when Li Zhengjing chuckled.

"If I hadn't been here, would you still have risked your life to protect the Gao family members?"

"..." Shi Yuan's face paled. He lowered his head and said softly, "Without the Immortal Venerable's presence, this junior likely wouldn't have dared."

The Wall-Climbing Bird laughed mockingly. "Birdy here has read a lot. I know your tricks. You wanted to show my master your heroic, life-risking loyalty to win his favor and gain guidance in your cultivation, didn't you?"

Shi Yuan's face twisted in panic at having his thoughts exposed.

"Whatever your intentions, you at least intended to shelter the Gao family members. That's commendable enough." Li Zhengjing smiled. "I can't expect you to throw away your future for a friendship with Gao Xuan that lasted only a few days. Besides, it seems Gao Xuan now wants to devour his own descendants."

The Gao family members turned pale, disbelief written across their faces. Shi Yuan sighed, unable to reconcile the friendly man who had entrusted his descendants to him with the one who now sought to harm them.

"Stay by my side for now. If Gao Xuan comes, I'll protect you." Li Zhengjing then turned to Shi Yuan. "You've been hospitable during our stay at the Shi residence. But remember—don't try to play games with me in the future."

Shi Yuan immediately knelt and kowtowed. "This junior will never dare to be so presumptuous again!" Relieved that Li Zhengjing wasn't angry, he let out a breath.

The Gao family members and the Shi family servants felt as if they were dreaming. Shi Yuan, who had gained the inheritance of a Human Immortal and built his reputation as the "Mountain-Suppressing Fist King," was known for his arrogance and pride throughout the southeastern region. Yet now, he knelt before a youth even younger than himself, begging for forgiveness.

"Rise."

"Yes..." Shi Yuan stood, his eyes filled with awe. Returning from the capital, he had realized how vast the world was and how many talents existed beyond his imagination. Immortal Venerable Zhengjing, though of similar age, far surpassed even his late master—a figure he could never hope to match.

"Wall-Climber!" Li Zhengjing beckoned.

The white bird landed on his hand, rubbing its dragon-horned head against his arm affectionately.

The Five Elements Creation Tree seethed inwardly. *Where did this bird learn this? It's already eight years old, yet it's acting like a spoiled child. Shameless!*

Li Zhengjing remained expressionless. "That commander earlier didn't speak fully. He must be hiding something. We won't get answers here. Follow him discreetly and find out what you can."

The Wall-Climbing Bird chirped in acknowledgment.

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its roots. "Master, let me go too!" Afraid of losing favor, the tree didn't want the bird to monopolize their master's tasks.

"No need!" the bird retorted. "Birdy can handle this alone!"

"Nonsense!" the tree shot back. "My second child is already a month old—old enough to learn how to serve our master! Shouldn't I teach it?"

"Flip! Flip!" The Wave-Severing Gu waved its antennae, imitating its father.

"Fine, go together. Watch each other's backs." Li Zhengjing relented.

The Five Elements Creation Tree scurried over on its myriad roots, looking eager. The onlookers stared in disbelief as the bird and tree vaulted over the wall.

"Not you!" Li Zhengjing pointed at the dragon girl, who had been about to follow. He then instructed Shi Yuan to prepare sweet soup. At the mention of treats, the girl sat down obediently, licking her lips.

With the bird and tree gone, Li Zhengjing turned his attention to the Gao family members.

"Little friend Zhengjing, test their blood," Yuan Zhengfeng's voice sounded in his ear, grave. "I suspect their danger doesn't stem from sharing Gao Xuan's bloodline, but from the peculiar nature of the Lin Yuan Gao family's blood itself."

"You mean Gao Xuan isn't hunting them because they share his lineage, but because the Gao family's blood is special?" Li Zhengjing mused.

"Possibly. Test the blood first. It's a pity Ghost Valley Lingguan isn't here—he's the expert in this field."

"No matter. We can contact him anytime with the Three Realms Conch." Li Zhengjing called the Shi family steward over. "Fetch some vials."

Meanwhile, the Zhou commander and his group had left the Shi residence in silence. Only after exiting Hongshan Town did the elder sigh.

"To think he's only seventeen, cultivating for just a year—unbelievable. Even centuries-old monsters might not inspire such awe."

"The prodigy who defected from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, yet had his bounty revoked because they couldn't bear to lose him?" The Blood Sword Practitioner's expression was complex. He had heard of Li Zhengjing's battles against Human Immortals and deities in the capital, surpassing even the Young Master of Kunlun among the younger generation.

"Li Zhengjing possesses Human Immortal combat power and twenty-five golden dragons, placing him among the stronger Human Immortals. But he can't single-handedly oppose the entire Great Zhou Dynasty!" the elder muttered. "Why fear him?"

"He may not rival the dynasty alone, but he's formidable enough to give them pause. Rumor has it he slew the Raging Monk."

The Raging Monk, a wanted criminal of Great Zhou, had cultivated an Arhat's Golden Body, rivaling a Human Immortal. Despite being hunted for over two hundred years, he had evaded capture—until Li Zhengjing killed him. If Li Zhengjing turned against Great Zhou, his potential for chaos would be a nightmare for the court.

Though Great Zhou had deep reserves of power, its vast territory couldn't be fully guarded. A rogue Li Zhengjing would spell disaster. Worse, the Grand Mystic Dynasty's State Preceptor, Lin Fuxuan, had approached him. They couldn't afford to drive him into the arms of the Grand Mystic remnants.

"With creditors emerging, the new emperor ascending, and the imperial seal and dragon pillars destroyed, the realm teeters on chaos. The descent of the Tianxing only adds to the turmoil." The Zhou commander glanced back at Hongshan Town, feeling as if he'd narrowly escaped death—or perhaps it was all a dream. The youth who had once been beneath his notice now stood above the mortal world. How had this happened in just a few months?

Had it taken decades, he might have accepted it. But this meteoric rise was unbearable. Meanwhile, he was stuck at the True Qi realm, doomed to mediocrity. The contrast was crushing.

"If I reached the Human Immortal realm, the court would support me fully—even the State Preceptor would submit. I could become an immortal emperor like the Founding Emperor!" The Zhou commander sighed, waving dismissively. Normally, he'd have silenced the Blood Sword Practitioner to save face. But today, his spirit was broken.

He led his men toward Jiangshang Prefecture to meet its governor and the three southeastern deities. After leaving Hongshan Town, he halted his troops and recorded his report for the capital.

Within two hours, a message arrived. He motioned for his men to wait while he read it.

"At noon today, Gao Xuan slaughtered over three hundred of his own clan. Two righteous deities jointly attacked him but were severely injured."

"Divine General Fang Yin leads thirty thousand troops toward Jiangshang Prefecture."

"Delay Gao Xuan until Fang Yin arrives. With the three southeastern deities, capture him."

"His ability to repel Human Immortals at the True Qi realm must stem from his Tianxing Cave Heaven opportunity. Secure it for the court."

"Preliminary analysis suggests his survival is linked to his maternal bloodline. Investigate the Lin Yuan Gao family's maternal lineage immediately."

The Zhou commander frowned. "Maternal bloodline?" Suddenly, he stiffened, sensing something amiss. He looked up—a golden-feathered, green-horned bird hid in the clouds, watching him. A branch snaked toward him, snatching the message.

His face darkened as he turned to see the same tree from Shi Yuan's courtyard.

"So it's not the paternal line—it's the maternal?" the Wall-Climbing Bird mused.

"Birdy, should we check the Gao family's records?" the tree asked.

"Report to Master first," the bird said.

The Zhou commander's hand hovered over his sword, torn between drawing it or not.

"Go ahead, draw it," the tree taunted. "Otherwise, beating you up would feel unfair. Give us an excuse."

"Tree's right. This guy's mouth is foul. Last time, he incited Lu Huaiyuan against our master. I've had enough of him!" The bird landed on the tree, eyes pitying. "My master teaches us to be merciful. Birdy respects that, so here are your choices: get roasted by me, or have Tree sew your mouth shut!"

The tree waved a branch. "Let's be extra merciful—give him a third option."

The bird gasped. "You want to train your second child?"

The Zhou commander's face twisted in rage. He drew his sword. "You go too far!"
