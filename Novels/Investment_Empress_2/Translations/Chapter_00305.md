# Chapter 305: Ice Statue Selecting Troops, the More the Merrier?

In the end, the two switched to Go. This was mainly because expressing military formations with Gomoku was too abstract for Zhong Ling.

Zhong Ling had considerable talent in military deployment, which was somewhat reflected in her Go skills.

But when she sat opposite Ying Bing and saw those slender, fair fingers—like ivory under the moonlight—gently place a black stone, she couldn't help but feel a shock in her heart.

"Miss Ying, do you already understand military formations? I feel like it's even harder to deal with you than with Uncle Qu."

"I suppose I do."

"'Suppose'?"

"I just learned it from you."

Ying Bing placed a stone, casually trapping Zhong Ling's large dragon.

Zhong Ling looked at her with a blank expression.

Looking back, when this Frost Fairy was commanding the military formation, she had indeed been staring intently at her. Zhong Ling had thought Ying Bing had long since been exposed to this art.

She didn't expect it to be a case of learning on the spot and applying it immediately.

"Why did you learn this?"

"......"

Ying Bing's fingers paused. Her gaze drifted faintly toward the bottom of the training grounds as she said softly, "Focus on the game."

"Oh."

Zhong Ling's expression grew increasingly complex.

Although Ying Bing told her to focus on the game, Ying Bing herself kept glancing down from time to time. Sometimes she looked at Li Mo, and other times she looked at the military formation commanded by Qu Sheng.

She suspected that Ying Bing had also seen flaws in Uncle Qu's military might.

Zhong Ling was receiving guidance here.

The command of Zhong Zhenyue's military formation was handed over to Qu Sheng.

In the hands of this Grand Commander guarding the front lines of Qingmu City, these hundred men were closely linked, sharing information and connecting their momentum.

Under his command, the effect of this drill improved even further.

"No wonder the pressure has increased so much," said Little Li, who was in the form of a Zhuyan, as he took a moment to glance over and noticed the commander had changed to Qu Sheng.

"My hands are itching to try, Young Hero Li, please don't mind," Qu Sheng's voice came.

"I couldn't ask for more!" Li Mo was delighted rather than alarmed.

The stronger the commander, the better the effect of the investment, meaning he would receive better investment feedback. Moreover, it would allow him to temper himself to a higher level.

He wondered if he could integrate the last True Spirit of Wuzhiqi into his transformation today. He was also quite curious about how much military force he could accommodate.

He had already agreed with Zhong Zhenyue to first evolve the relatively rampant Disaster Beasts of the Southern Frontier, handle the formal matters, and then try it out.

"Brothers, so this is what a pure-blood Zhuyan looks like. Its bloodline power can actually drive Blood煞 (Blood Fiendish Energy), which can strengthen itself and also be used to devour others."

"If we hadn't seen it, we would have been caught off guard and suffered a great loss!"

"It's not just Zhuyan. Qiongqi, Nine-Headed Bird—are they not all like this?"

"We've broadened our horizons today. We must remember this well. If we encounter these Disaster Beasts in the future, it might just save our lives."

Exclamations of astonishment occasionally echoed around the training grounds.

No one would be frivol about such matters. It is often said that grain and grass should go before the troops, but on the battlefield, there is something more vital than food: information.

Many astonishing battle examples in history, when investigated, are fundamentally due to these two words.

Li Mo was now displaying everything about the Disaster Beasts directly before their eyes, more vividly than any record.

The notification sounds in his ear also rang out one after another.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in the soldiers of the Qingmu Camp, helping them understand Zhuyan.】
【You have an investment reward to claim.】
【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in the soldiers of the Qingmu Camp, helping them understand the Great Wind (Da Feng).】
【You have an investment reward to claim.】
...

As the drill progressed, the focus of everyone's astonishment shifted from the various Disaster Beasts to Li Mo himself.

"Have you noticed? Young Hero Li doesn't seem to show any signs of exhaustion or depletion of True Origin."

"Holy crap, I wouldn't have noticed if you hadn't said it."

"Young Hero Li is fighting a military formation alone, and he's almost worn the formation down."

"Just how strong must his Soul and Physique be?"

"No wonder the Grand Commander said Young Hero Li has the potential to become a God-General of the current era..."

"How much military force can he accommodate now? Does he already possess the capability of a Great General?"

The generals on the platform grew more alarmed the longer they watched.

They had known Commander Qu was a man of his word, but they never expected this evaluation not to be mere polite flattery.

The scenes of the王爷 (Prince) being valiant and unmatched in the army back in the day probably didn't have as much impact on them as Young Hero Li.

It was not excessive to say such a person could become a God-General in the future.

"Stop!"

Qu Sheng put down his command flag. Listening to the discussions of the generals, he let out a long breath. He was naturally curious as well.

He stopped not because Li Mo was done for.

It was because Zhong Zhenyue, having sustained the military force against Li Mo for so long, had reached the limit of his Soul and physical strength and could not continue.

"Let me rest for a bit."

"Alright, we'll continue later."

"Ah? Brother Li, why don't you try accommodating the military force first? We can continue the drill tomorrow."

Zhong Zhenyue waved his hand with a bitter smile.

Others probably didn't know, but there was something even more terrifying.

Brother Li is even scarier when he's not transforming into a Disaster Beast, because he can pull out a hammer...

"Alright, Old Zhong, get some good rest."

Li Mo tossed him a sixth-pattern Dan medicine for recuperation with some regret. He hadn't薅 (plucked/harvested) enough feedback yet.

He also didn't get to integrate the last True Spirit of Wuzhiqi.

Actually, the timing was perfect right now...

"Young Hero Li, how does it feel within the military formation?"

Qu Sheng personally greeted him on the command platform, not even having shaken off the fine snow on his cloak.

"I want more."

"Hahaha, wanting more is a good thing. Why not take this opportunity to try how much military force you can accommodate? Do you have any expectations in mind?"

"More... um, probably more than Zhong Zhenyue."

Li Mo had wanted to borrow the "the more the merrier" from a certain God of War.

But he felt it wasn't quite suitable for him to say it, as he wasn't a commander leading thousands of troops.

"Can we do it right now?"

Qu Sheng's gaze drifted faintly toward the Go game not far away. "Originally, it wouldn't be possible. The Nexus and the commander need time to build tacit understanding."

"Huh?"

Li Mo didn't understand the implication in his words.

However, following his gaze, he saw a distance away.

Ying Bing, dressed in a feathered robe and long skirt, sat amidst the wind and snow. Her cold, clear appearance added a finishing touch to the scenery of the first snow.

She placed stones on the board with an air of calm composure and strategic command.

And opposite her.

Zhong Ling's eyes were wide and vacant, her mouth agape. White breath continuously billowed from the top of her head and her mouth.

As if she had lost her soul?

"Earlier, Zhong Ling asked Ying Bing how many troops she could command."

Qu Sheng lowered his eyelids slightly, his hand trembling a bit.

"What did she say?"

"The more the merrier."

"......"

Little Li's虎軀 (tiger body—idiom for a mighty figure) shuddered, as if struck by lightning, and he instinctively leaned back in a tactical retreat.

Qu Sheng chuckled dryly.

It seemed the tacit understanding between this pair of young men and women was indeed beyond doubt.

...

PS: There's more, but it will be a bit later. The little failure author is a bit feverish.
Asking for some support in advance, hehe~
