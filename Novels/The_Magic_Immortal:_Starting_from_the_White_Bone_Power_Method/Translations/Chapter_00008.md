# Chapter 8: I'd Rather Die Than Become a Demonic Cultivator  

Returning to his room, Wang Chan took a quick hot bath. By then, it was already night, and the darkness here was particularly thick.  

The outside was eerily quiet, with only the rustling of leaves in the courtyard carried by the night wind and the professional laughter of the voluptuous female cultivator from Cave No. 48, who worked as a courtesan, drifting from afar.  

Lying on the bed that felt both familiar and strange, Wang Chan was exhausted but couldn’t sleep. The events of the day replayed in his mind—fear, unease, worry… and a faint glimmer of joy from his gains.  

"I’m still too weak," he muttered under his breath.  

Giving up on sleep, he got out of bed, shut the doors and windows tightly, and extinguished the spirit lamp, plunging the room into pitch-black darkness.  

His eyes gleamed like a thief’s as he quietly lifted the bed board and slipped into the hidden dugout beneath. He had hastily excavated this small space on his first night here, overwhelmed by panic. It was cramped—he had to hunch over and curl up inside. If he tried to squeeze a woman in with him, there wouldn’t even be room to move.  

He knew full well that if real danger came, this pitiful dugout, devoid of any concealment arrays, would be useless. But at least it was an enclosed space, offering some semblance of security.  

Gently patting his storage pouch, he retrieved the pink jade bag. When he opened it, the pile of spirit coins inside emitted a mesmerizing white glow, forcing him to squint slightly.  

A faint smile crept onto his face, and the negative emotions weighing on his heart vanished in an instant.  

As expected, all negative emotions ultimately stemmed from a lack of money.  

One hundred and three spirit coins! Given his current situation, it would take him at least two years of frugal living to save up this much. Not bad—a small windfall.  

But his smile quickly faded as he sobered up. This sum was just the beginning.  

With a clinking sound, he poured the coins onto the ground.  

A strange, somewhat familiar yet indescribable odor wafted from them. He touched one—it was damp and sticky. Flicking it with his finger, the coin stretched into a thin, elastic strand…  

An old advertisement about "flicking away crow’s feet" flashed through his mind, and his expression twisted in disgust.  

These coins were filthy.  

He didn’t even want to imagine what Madame Cheng had done with them!  

The scent, more pungent than a fox’s musk, was overwhelming. His first instinct was to throw them all away.  

But these were hard-earned coins—losing even one would feel like losing a part of himself.  

"Could these coins be… tainted?"  

The thought sent a chill down his spine.  

Madame Cheng had drained that demonic cultivator Li Yuan dry right before his eyes—a sight too horrifying to forget. What if she had used these coins in some unspeakable cultivation method?  

Though the coins appeared fine on the surface, what if something was wrong inside?  

Reluctantly, like a pervert, he picked one up, sniffed it, rubbed it between his fingers, scrutinized it, and even pried open a seam to probe it with his spiritual sense…  

After a quarter of an hour, he confirmed that none of the coins were contaminated.  

"Demonic cultivators… they’re all a bunch of sickos," Wang Chan muttered under his breath.  

Annoyed, he stuffed the coins back into the jade bag and tied it tightly.  

He couldn’t possibly use these coins without washing them first.  

Unfortunately, the lingering traces of that foul energy required careful cleansing to avoid damaging the coins.  

"Disgusting woman…"  

Grumbling, he stowed the jade bag away, then hesitated before solemnly retrieving the pale golden bone.  

Glancing around nervously, he accidentally bumped his head against the dugout’s ceiling. Wincing, he rubbed the sore spot and focused his spiritual sense into the bone.  

"*Bone Devouring Strength Art*… *Ghost Devouring Nether Passage Art*…"  

Just the names alone reeked of sinister energy—bones, ghosts, all things eerie. It didn’t take a genius to realize these were demonic cultivation techniques.  

Demonic or not, what mattered was that one was a low-grade technique, while the other was a rare mid-grade one. These weren’t the worthless, unranked manuals flooding the market. If he had the right connections, selling them could make him a fortune.  

But that was just wishful thinking.  

If he dared to sell them, he’d more likely end up dead—either robbed or "purified" by righteous cultivators.  

Considering his low-grade spiritual root, which disqualified him from practicing mid-grade techniques, Wang Chan reluctantly turned his attention to the *Bone Devouring Strength Art*.  

Low-grade techniques could only form a low-grade foundation, while mid-grade ones could forge a mid-grade foundation—there was no comparison.  

But he had no choice.  

To his dismay, after barely skimming the *Bone Devouring Strength Art*’s introduction, Wang Chan withdrew his spiritual sense, drenched in cold sweat. His face twisted as if constipated.  

Due to his background, he had been practicing the unranked orthodox technique *Mystic Turtle Breathing Method*. It seemed mediocre, even trashy at first glance.  

But in truth, orthodox techniques—especially ranked ones—were stable, balanced, and built a solid foundation. Once mastered, they could harmonize with the cultivator, awakening innate talents that not only aided cultivation but also granted unique abilities.  

Moreover, the higher the technique’s grade and the cultivator’s talent, the stronger the innate ability.  

In contrast, demonic techniques were often sinister, bizarre, and domineering, treating all things in heaven and earth as resources to be exploited. They emphasized rapid advancement, indulgence, and unhindered desires.  

Previously, due to his humble origins and the suppression of demonic knowledge by orthodox sects and noble clans, he hadn’t fully grasped what "exploiting all things" truly meant.  

Now he understood.  

Demonic cultivators often had to refine materials like monster bones, ghostly energy, demon blood, or exotic species—depending on their technique’s requirements—to fuse with their spiritual roots before they could truly begin cultivating.  

These materials were treasures harvested from demons, ghosts, and monsters, and not just any creature possessed them. They were rare and valuable.  

For example, the *Bone Devouring Strength Art* required fusing with a monster bone to officially begin cultivation and become a demonic cultivator.  

Successfully merging with a monster bone could enhance one’s cultivation aptitude. While it couldn’t upgrade the spiritual root’s grade, it could amplify cultivation efficiency.  

Most importantly, there was a chance to awaken a supernatural ability from the bone itself!  

The higher the grade of the monster bone, the stronger the ability and the greater the enhancement.  

For instance, fusing with a supreme-grade monster bone could awaken a supreme or high-grade ability.  

This was why, in the cultivation world, demonic cultivators often surpassed their orthodox counterparts in combat prowess at the same level—especially in the lower realms.  

After all, orthodox cultivators needed time to refine their techniques and reach a certain level before awakening innate abilities, while demonic cultivators had a chance to gain abilities right from the start.  

Moreover, with the same spiritual root, demonic cultivators progressed far faster than those from the other three paths.  

Given his inferior spiritual root, cultivating a demonic technique would indeed accelerate his progress.  

But the problem was, merging with a monster bone without guidance was akin to a suicide mission!  

And once he fused with a bone, he’d be locked onto the demonic path forever, with no chance to switch to another cultivation method.  

Additionally, due to their nature, demonic techniques often led to backlash, mental corruption, and frequent risk of qi deviation.  

Without proper safeguards, demonic cultivators often became twisted—paranoid, violent, and extreme, like Madame Cheng.  

Wang Chan had no desire to become a lunatic.  

Moreover, the Cloudmist Kingdom was orthodox territory. Being a demonic cultivator here was incredibly risky. He might be taking a peaceful dump in the bushes when a group of righteous cultivators suddenly jumped out, bombarding him with artifacts, spells, and divine abilities in the name of "eradicating evil."
