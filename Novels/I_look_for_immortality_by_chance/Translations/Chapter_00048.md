# Chapter 48: Disposing of Loot and Moon Bamboo Market  

Amidst the chatter of the disciples, time passed swiftly.  

In the blink of an eye, four days had gone by.  

The Dragon Tusk Treasure Ship no longer waited for those who had yet to return. The attendants and outer disciples beat the great drum, activating the ship's formations as they steered it back to the sect.  

Soon, the treasure ship returned to the Dao Academy.  

The disciples then dispersed, each returning to their own caves on beams of light.  

The Shell Field expedition had been but a "small test" for the academy, yet for many disciples, it had been a trial of life and death.  

Some had broken through realms and returned with bountiful gains, while others had perished, their fates unknown.  

A rough tally showed that dozens of disciples had died in the Shell Field.  

Yet the academy showed no concern, as if it were of little consequence.  

As some disciples in the academy put it, "If there are grudges or enmities, it's better to settle them at lower realms. Otherwise, when cultivation advances, old scores will be settled, causing unnecessary turmoil in the academy. Besides, if one lacks the skill, they lack destiny—why make a fuss over it?"  

This reasoning might not be entirely sound, but the deaths of dozens of Qi Refinement disciples truly caused no ripples in the academy.  

Even the demise of a few scions from noble clans only led to brief mourning before their families simply sent new disciples to replace them.  

Gu Yuan also returned to his cave.  

Gazing at the familiar surroundings and the shimmering formation patterns within, he finally let out a sigh of relief.  

After bathing and cleansing himself, he headed to the Spirit Food Hall for a hearty meal before finally sitting cross-legged in his meditation chamber to take stock of his gains from this expedition.  

"The greatest rewards from this Shell Field trip are undoubtedly the Shell King, the Star Spirit, and the Seed Body Seal."  

"I've already consumed the Shell King, breaking through to the sixth layer of Qi Refinement. Now, what remains is refining the Star Spirit and crafting the Seed Body Seal."  

Gu Yuan looked at the miniature "elephant" and the jade-green slip before him, a faint smile on his lips.  

The Star Spirit was a being of boundless potential and immense power. Just from Lan Tianlu's display, it was clear this was no ordinary entity.  

Though the Seed Body Seal wasn't a true Body Seal, once successfully crafted, it could double his cultivation speed, allowing him to close the gap between himself and the Seven-Apertured disciples.  

Moreover, the Seed Body Seal could also produce a "Law Seal," further augmenting his strength.  

By mastering these two treasures, Gu Yuan's power would undoubtedly soar.  

"To bind the Star Spirit, one must possess the 'Soul Contract Art.' Only through this method can the Star Spirit be controlled as effortlessly as one's own limbs, its power summoned with a mere thought."  

"Yet Lan Tianlu's storage pouch contained no such art. It seems he only temporarily bound the Star Spirit using a beast-taming contract. Otherwise, during our battle, he wouldn't have needed to touch the spirit beast pouch—a mere thought would have sufficed to channel the Star Spirit's power."  

The Star Spirit was a mystical entity, and only the Soul Contract Art could forge a bond between one's soul and the spirit, making them one. Without it, the Star Spirit would forever remain an external tool.  

But this art was exceedingly rare and exorbitantly priced. Gu Yuan had assumed Lan Tianlu, as the Star Spirit's owner, would possess it. Yet now, it seemed he had overestimated the man.  

Lan Tianlu was poor!  

Without the backing of the Lan Clan, he had no means to obtain the Soul Contract Art.  

Thus, Gu Yuan had to rely on himself.  

"With my current means, there are only two ways to obtain the Soul Contract Art. The first is to seek it from the academy—entering the Transmission Hall."  

"However, techniques are not lightly bestowed. Even as a disciple, one must either expend contribution points or present a Golden Core token to gain entry."  

"The second method is to purchase it in the market. The world is vast—somewhere, a cultivator must have it."  

Gu Yuan pondered these options briefly.  

But there wasn't much to deliberate.  

He had a storage pouch full of loot to offload, and crafting the Seed Body Seal required purchasing rare spiritual materials and exotic species. A trip to the market was unavoidable.  

As for contribution points, those required completing tasks in the "Fate Hall," a time-consuming and laborious process with no guarantee of success.  

Having made up his mind, Gu Yuan fed the Star Spirit a "Cold Honey Jujube" to soothe it before storing it in his spirit beast pouch. He then mounted his Cloud-Treading Shuttle and headed north.  

---  

Gu Yuan did not go to the market in Silver Moon Bay, nor did he visit the Heavenly Star Black Market.  

What kind of fool would sell loot from killing a fellow disciple in their own sect's market?  

Even in the Heavenly Star Black Market, where faces were concealed, the styles of magical artifacts remained recognizable. A discerning eye could easily spot them.  

Fortunately, the academy's seniors had long since identified a better place for disposing of illicit gains—one that catered to such needs.  

After leaving the sect, Gu Yuan rode his Jade Dragon Shuttle at breakneck speed for several hours before finally landing on a secluded island.  

The island was vast, with a mountain at its center. Within the mountain lay a basin where flowers bloomed in abundance, forests swayed like an emerald sea, and waterfalls cascaded down cliffs. Pavilions dotted the cliffsides, and the air was thick with spiritual energy. Occasionally, cranes took flight, painting a scene of serene beauty.  

This was the largest market near the Dao Academy—the Moon Bamboo Market.  

Established by a Golden Core cultivator known as the Moon Bamboo Sage, this market served as a trading hub for the Green Peak Dao Academy, the Nine Rivers Water Tribes, the Sunset Glow Sect, and other nearby factions. Over time, it had grown increasingly prosperous.  

Not only did Qi Refinement cultivators frequent it, but even Foundation Establishment experts occasionally visited.  

Since it was founded by a Golden Core Sage, few dared to cause trouble. Moreover, its proximity to the Green Peak Dao Academy made it a favored destination for disciples before and after expeditions.  

The market offered a far greater variety of goods than the Heavenly Star Black Market, and its atmosphere was livelier.  

Within the secluded bamboo towers, female cultivators skilled in seduction techniques—each more alluring than the last—stood ready to fulfill any desire.  

(For the record, male companions were also available.)  

Female cultivators visiting the market could indulge to their heart's content as well.  

In this world of cultivation, there was no gender divide—spirit stones were all that mattered!  

Even demonic beings were welcome to partake in the pleasures.  

Gu Yuan, however, had no interest in such distractions.  

Though this world, governed by the Heavenly Court, lacked demonic sects, those who practiced seduction arts were seldom virtuous.  

Gu Yuan couldn't bring himself to indulge in fleeting pleasures.  

If he ever wished to sate his desires, he could purchase a Shell Maiden or a Mermaid—spirit women with long lifespans but low cultivation, renowned for their beauty and loyalty. They made ideal attendants or concubines.  

Many noble clans favored such companions.  

If he found one to his liking, Gu Yuan wouldn't hesitate to acquire one or two for his cave—to tend to chores, warm his bed, and serve him.  

But as for those who practiced seduction arts? No, thank you.  

With these thoughts in mind, Gu Yuan arrived at the market.  

A verdant barrier, resembling a colossal bamboo shadow, enveloped the entire basin. Only a narrow path led in and out.  

Flanking the path stood two towering emerald bamboos.  

As Gu Yuan approached, a faint human face emerged from one of the bamboos and called out:  

"Moon Bamboo Market—entry fee is six spirit stones! No credit!"  

Six spirit stones?  

Gu Yuan frowned. This was even pricier than the Heavenly Star Black Market.  

Observing the bustling crowd within the bamboo-shadowed market, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly.  

"Truly, running a platform is the most profitable business."  

After paying the fee, Gu Yuan stepped through the barrier and into the market.  

The moment he entered, a fragrant breeze greeted him.
