# Chapter 14: Inside Information  

"This organization dares to assassinate county officials? And no one does anything about it?"  

Faced with the extensive mission list, Lin Shan barely had time to marvel before noticing the twenty or so black-clad figures who had arrived with him heading up to the second floor. He quickly followed the group.  

The second floor's layout was similar to the first, except there were two queues in front of the counters. Lin Shan joined one of them. Observing the others, he saw each person handing over their identity tokens to the registrar, seemingly settling their mission rewards.  

When it was his turn, Lin Shan presented his token. The registrar was a young woman in her twenties with a black mole on the tip of her nose—pleasant enough to look at.  

"Xin Twenty-One, completed the collective mission of intercepting official silver. Individual contribution: 15 points. Collective contribution: 5 points."  

"Total contribution: 20 points. Token balance: 50 points."  

The mole-faced woman tossed the token back to him before he could fully process the information.  

"Next!"  

...  

"Intercepting official silver? So those dozen or so carts of escort goods were actually government silver? Damn, that must have been hundreds of thousands of taels!"  

Lin Shan was inwardly stunned. In the face of such enormous profits, the authorities had conspired with powerful families to set up the operation, sacrificing Chief Escort Wang as collateral damage.  

But then again, as a mere assassin involved in such a high-profile case, he only received 20 contribution points. Wasn’t that too little?  

And how could that dead fatty’s legacy only be worth 30 points? He was a seasoned assassin who had caught the attention of Protector Jiang!  

Years of being a killer, and this was all he had?  

Lin Shan conveniently forgot that he was a latecomer to the profession. In the silver interception mission, he had merely been part of the fleeing party, contributing nothing substantial. Getting any reward at all was already a stroke of luck.  

After wandering around the second floor, he noticed most assassins left after settling their missions, while a few ascended to the third floor. After a moment’s hesitation, he followed them.  

At the entrance to the third floor stood a large sign:  

**Exchange Hall.**  

Lin Shan immediately understood. The layout was similar to the floors below, but the back wall behind the counter displayed a densely packed exchange list:  

- *"Precious Yellow Scripture" (Innate cultivation method) — 1,000 points.*  
- *"Mayfly’s Glimpse of Heaven" (Innate cultivation method) — 1,000 points.*  
- *"Savage Force" (Houtian martial art) — 500 points.*  
- *"Titan’s Palm" (Houtian martial art) — 300 points.*  
- *"Mammoth Technique" (Houtian cultivation method) — 200 points.*  

Lin Shan’s eyes glazed over at the sheer variety. Even innate cultivation methods were available for exchange. He couldn’t help but admire Nightingale’s magnanimity—other clans and sects guarded such methods as closely held secrets, reserving them only for core disciples.  

But in Nightingale, it didn’t matter if you were a newcomer or a veteran. Contribution points ruled supreme!  

However, upon closer consideration, Lin Shan sobered up. Intercepting hundreds of thousands of taels of government silver, mobilizing over twenty assassins—such a massive operation only yielded 20 points. To accumulate enough for an innate cultivation method, he’d need to complete fifty such missions!  

Lin Shan shook his head. Being an assassin meant dancing on the edge of a blade with every mission. One misstep, and it was game over—just like his predecessor, the short, fat man. Who could guarantee they’d survive fifty high-stakes missions involving first-rate experts?  

His gaze drifted down to the Houtian martial art *Titan’s Palm*. Recalling his battle alongside Master Pu against the fat assassin, Lin Shan surmised that the man had likely spent all his savings on this external martial art, leaving him broke.  

"Three hundred points! What a waste!"  

Lin Shan lamented inwardly, cursing the fat man for squandering what should have been his inheritance.  

"I’ve got 50 points now. What can I even get?"  

Scouring the list, he finally found a few items under fifty points in a corner—bruise ointments, wound salves, and some weapons.  

A steel blade alone cost 20 points!  

Lin Shan suddenly remembered Scarface clinging to his chipped blade during their fight, unwilling to discard it.  

"So, after one mission, Scarface could only afford a new blade?"  

The exploitative face of capitalism! Poor wage-slave Scarface!  

As Lin Shan stroked his chin, a realization struck him. "Damn it, I forgot about Scarface!"  

He hurried back to the staircase and scanned the first and second floors. The halls were still brightly lit, but with every assassin masked and hooded, distinguishing one from another was impossible.  

After all, assassins had real identities outside their work. Shed the black outfit, and they were upstanding citizens!  

What? An assassin? Who, me?  

Lin Shan grimaced. His oversight had turned the tables—Scarface had gone from being a known threat to an unseen one.  

Originally, he had planned to exploit Scarface’s ignorance of his innate secret technique, using *Severing Palm* to eliminate the problem. Now, he’d have to play it by ear.  

Fine. For now, he’d let it slide.  

...  

Noticing that the "Tranquil Abode" had more than three floors, Lin Shan decided to try his luck and head to the fourth.  

But before his foot could touch the first step, an aged voice spoke beside him.  

"Go up there unprepared, and you’ll die. The fourth floor is Protector Jiang’s resting place. Without my guidance, stepping foot there is certain death."  

Lin Shan froze mid-step and turned to see an elderly man with a white beard sitting calmly by the exchange counter, smiling at him over a cup of tea.  

Lin Shan hurried over and bowed. "Thank you for the warning, elder. May I ask your esteemed name?"  

"You must be new, lacking even this basic knowledge," the old man chuckled, stroking his beard.  

"I’m Manager Jiang, in charge of the third floor. Most just call me Old Jiang."  

Lin Shan clasped his hands respectfully, inwardly noting that the old man seemed approachable. Since he’d already pegged Lin Shan as a newcomer, this was a perfect opportunity to gather information.  

"My family hails from Guangnan Prefecture. I’m new here and unfamiliar with Nightingale’s rules. I’d be grateful for your guidance, elder."  

Assassins feared nothing more than exposing their real identities. While his background as a Qinghe Prefecture escort might be known to Protector Jiang and the twenty-some assassins from the silver mission, once he kept his face hidden for a few days, no one would recognize him—unless someone linked him through the fat man’s token number.  

But the only one who likely knew all the token numbers was Protector Jiang, who wouldn’t bother with small fry like him.  

Still, caution was paramount. A single misstep could spell disaster in the jianghu.  

Manager Jiang didn’t seem to care whether Lin Shan’s story was true. He sipped his tea and smiled without a word.  

Lin Shan caught the hint and promptly produced ten taels of silver.  

"Now that’s a teachable lad!"  

Pocketing the money, Manager Jiang became more forthcoming. Under his leisurely narration, Lin Shan gradually gained a clearer understanding of Nightingale.  

Most martial sects rose and fell within a century, but Nightingale had endured for eight hundred years.  

The reason was simple: the organization operated like a gu vessel—the strong rose, the weak fell. Every generation of leadership comprised individuals of exceptional skill and intellect. Combined with their "recognize the token, not the person" tradition, they never faced a shortage of talent, earning widespread renown in the jianghu.  

Nearly every martial artist knew of Nightingale’s "token over identity" policy and held it in high esteem.  

The "Tranquil Abode" in Zangke Prefecture was just one of Nightingale’s branches in the Great Song’s southwest. Similar branches existed in over a dozen other locations.  

The headquarters was said to be in the imperial capital—Bianliang.  

The Zangke branch’s leader was naturally an innate expert, but he was often absent, traveling the world. Thus, affairs were managed by Protector Jiang, a half-step innate expert.  

Nightingale’s rules for assassins weren’t overly strict. Beyond the basics—like not disclosing headquarters or employer details—members only needed to complete three missions a year.  

Of course, Manager Jiang hinted that with the right "donations" to him, even this requirement could be… adjusted.  

Finally, out of gratitude for the ten taels, Manager Jiang advised Lin Shan to spend his contribution points on hidden weapons for self-defense.  

Thus, Lin Shan emptied his token’s 50 points on a wrist-mounted dart launcher and left the "Tranquil Abode" under Manager Jiang’s amused gaze.  

Outside, dawn was just breaking. The morning breeze cleared Lin Shan’s head as he stood on the steps, staring at his token and the dart launcher.  

Well. Now he was broke again.
