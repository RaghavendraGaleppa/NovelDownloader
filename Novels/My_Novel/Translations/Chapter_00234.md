Chapter 234: The Pure Yang Body, Life and Death Together

Li Xian helped Wen Caishang sit up properly. She sat cross-legged with her hands resting on her knees, her posture dignified and extremely graceful. Her long hair, meticulously braided and adorned with silver ornaments and hairpins, hung down to her waist. Despite the intense battles she had endured, her hairstyle remained impeccable, though sweat had dampened the strands near her scalp, clinging to her skin and adding a touch of urgency and weariness to her appearance.

Li Xian unrolled a map before them, his expression grave. "I entered the city early this morning to buy this map. There's only one county town nearby, and it's even inferior to Qingning County."

"The maps in the bookstores were crude and useless, a complete waste of several taels of silver. It pained me to no end," he said, though he happened to cross paths with a disciple from the Sword Rain Pavilion. I secretly tailed him and seized the opportunity to steal this map. Take a look, my lady."

Hearing him say it "pained him to no end," Wen Caishang rolled her eyes at him, thinking, *I've never seen you pained over me.* She lowered her gaze to the map and immediately furrowed her brows.

"It seems you've already figured it out," Li Xian said. "The Sword Rain Pavilion is advancing step by step, with many eyes in the surroundings. It's highly likely they've deduced we're hiding in the mountains and are gradually tightening the noose."

"I saw members of the Sword Rain Pavilion in the city this morning. As time passes, their security will only become stricter!"

"That must be Su Qiuwu," Wen Caishang replied. "That man is narrow-minded. He appears gentle on the surface but is actually insidious and cunning. Among the Sword Rain Pavilion, he is the most difficult to deal with."

She spoke frankly: "If I weren't injured, I wouldn't fear this encirclement in the slightest. But my injuries are severe, and I have no strength to turn the tide. How can you possibly handle them alone?"

Li Xian pondered thoughtfully, examining the map from left to right. "Heaven never seals off all paths. Just when the willow trees seem to block the view, another village appears by the river. With our combined wisdom, we might just find a way to survive."

Meeting Li Xian's deep, determined eyes, Wen Caishang's heart stirred. She smiled. "That's true... You've risen from a mere errand boy to where you are today precisely because of this indomitable spirit. Very well, let's join forces and take on the heroes of the world."

Li Xian pulled Wen Caishang closer, and they sat together on the ground to study the terrain on the map. Wen Caishang was quite knowledgeable about the Yellow Sand Sect, the Sword Rain Pavilion, and the Taixin Sect, and she was well-versed in geomancy and various other disciplines. She assisted him from the side.

Li Xian was sharp and resourceful, his clever ideas flowing continuously. He simulated the layout of the various sects, voicing his thoughts as they came to him. Wen Caishang felt immense admiration for his insights, finding them highly reasonable.

The more they simulated the situation, the more urgent the局势 (situation) felt. Li Xian, with his open-minded nature, appropriately used humor to lighten the mood. Wen Caishang was both annoyed and amused; being teased by him made her feel as if all her former dignity had vanished.

After two hours, they had marked the map with red, black, and brown dots, representing the various sects and their encirclement strategy against the Disorderly Fragrance Mountain.

Wen Caishang said gravely, "Li Xian, you are truly remarkable. Your deductions are almost spot-on, in fact... you might be even more thorough than Su Qiuwu's plans. The Yellow Sand Sect, the Sword Rain Pavilion, and the Taixin Sect are not a single entity. They have no binding interests and cannot truly unite as one."

"If you were the one leading the encirclement against me, I would be in serious trouble."

The dots on the map, occupying high ground and combining with the natural terrain, formed a seemingly impregnable formation. Wen Caishang analyzed it carefully and was filled with admiration.

Li Xian laughed. "I don't need to send troops to encircle you; I've already caught you, my lady." They played around for a bit, and Wen Caishang said helplessly, "This boy has no sense of propriety." After a moment, they returned to the main topic.

With such a tight encirclement, how could they break free?

Li Xian contemplated strategies for breaking out. He considered the mountainous terrain and imagined various scenarios. No matter where they tried to break through, they would be met with attacks from all sides, making escape extremely difficult.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang simulated various escape routes, but none were viable. Wen Caishang said, "Your own layout is too airtight; even you would find it hard to break through. Our last hope is that their layout isn't as perfect as yours, that there is a flaw somewhere."

The map was like a sand table. Li Xian put himself in their shoes, simulating how he would coordinate, deploy, and kill if he were Su Qiuwu, the Taixin heroes, or Zhao Zhiyuan, leaving no room for error. The encirclement was already formed, and with each passing day, the perimeter shrank, making escape even harder.

Returning to their own situation, facing such a dilemma, how could they escape? It seemed like a battle of wits and courage against Su Qiuwu and the Taixin heroes, but in reality, he was struggling with himself.

If he could break through, they would be safe. But it was no simple task. After pondering for a long time, Li Xian's mind was elsewhere. He picked up the jade pendant from Wen Caishang's waist and gently stroked it. A cool sensation spread through his hand, very comforting.

Wen Caishang was sitting in Li Xian's lap as they studied the map together. She smelled his fresh, clean scent and felt a sense of peace.

The sky gradually darkened. A slanted moon illuminated the cave, and stars began to twinkle.

Li Xian suddenly froze. He took out half a roasted chicken and some side dishes from his robe and smiled. "I was so lost in thought I forgot to eat all day. I bought this特意 (specifically) when I went into the city."

He used his palm force to blow the dust from the ground and spread out the oil paper. Suddenly, Li Xian paused, a brilliant idea flashing through his mind. He smiled faintly and opened all the packages of food.

"It's a shame it's already cold," Li Xian said.

Wen Caishang was already feeling hungry. Li Xian, wanting to show off his skills, drew his Sinking River Sword. A flash of Yang-grade sword energy shot out, lingering in the air and radiating a gentle warmth. He reheated the chicken and side dishes. The aroma drifted out, tantalizing their appetites.

Wen Caishang raised an eyebrow. "A cheap trick. You're just showing off." Li Xian tore off a chicken leg to feed Wen Caishang. She felt a flicker of joy in her heart and opened her mouth to bite it. But Li Xian pulled it back and took a bite himself first.

"You!" Wen Caishang was furious.

"Good lady," Li Xian said, "tomorrow we'll have a fierce battle at the very least. I need to replenish my strength."

"You little bastard," Wen Caishang said. "How many people have wanted to feed me a chicken leg, and I've ignored them all. The one time I finally want one, you refuse."

The world is full of ironies. Yet, Wen Caishang wasn't annoyed; she was a little angry instead. Li Xian tore the chicken apart and fed it to Wen Caishang. They both ended up with oily mouths.

A beauty in distress, her red lips glistening with oil. After they had eaten and drunk their fill, Li Xian and Wen Caishang sat outside the cave, watching the stars and the moon as a cool breeze blew.

In the distance, clusters of green willows and lush flowers created a beautiful scenery. Li Xian sighed, "What a pity we have no wine to drink heartily." Wen Caishang asked, "Aren't you afraid?"

"I am afraid, and yet I am not," Li Xian said cheerfully. The evening wind blew, his hair gently swaying, and he looked exceptionally spirited between his brows and eyes.

Wen Caishang said, "Your bearing... it's... very nice." Her pretty face flushed slightly. She had evaluated Li Xian many times before, and had said similar things before.

In the past, she was evaluating an object in her hand, so she was naturally poised and confident. Now, as a woman evaluating a man, she was naturally shy.

The crescent moon was incomplete, and the scenery was pleasant.

Li Xian took out the map, pointed to a spot, and said, "Caishang, what kind of flowers do you think are planted in this sea of flowers?"

"These are wild flowers, called 'Fangwu Flowers.' They are in full bloom right now. They grow in clusters, covering the mountains and fields, quite grand," Wen Caishang replied.

Li Xian smiled. "Have you ever seen them?"

"I only know of them from books; I haven't seen them in person," Wen Caishang shook her head. Li Xian asked, "And according to the books, are they beautiful?"

"Beautiful flowers, I've seen them all," Wen Caishang said. "But the Fangwu Flowers have a unique spectacle. When they bloom en masse, colorful mist shrouds the flower fields, making it incredibly gorgeous."

"Many tourists, wanting to see this wonder, seek out the places where Fangwu Flowers grow. There were poets in the Great Yu Dynasty who wrote verses about it."

Li Xian asked, "I suspect the so-called colorful mist is actually scattered pollen. Because pollen is light, it floats with the wind. That's why Fangwu Flowers always grow in large patches."

"You're clever," Wen Caishang said. "This pollen is actually a type of medicinal herb. But it's not scarce, and there are many substitutes. So no one covets it."

Li Xian suddenly laughed. "Caishang, tomorrow we don't know if we'll live or die, or if we'll die without living. If it's suitable, shall we go and see that sea of flowers?"

Hearing Li Xian call her "Caishang," Wen Caishang felt a slight displeasure. She thought, *This green boy just entered the world, and he dares to call me that? He doesn't know that everyone who called me that in the past was run through by my sword.* But her heart felt a strange, sweet sensation. The two already had an emotional foundation, and their time together was gradually deepening it.

She also saw that in the face of life and death, Li Xian could be so carefree, so unrestrained, and so calm. She had seen many heroes, many with unparalleled courage. But Li Xian's unique blend of elegance and freedom was one of a kind. Her current state of mind and situation were unique in her entire life, a feeling that could never be replicated.

She said in a charming voice, "You little rascal, you're quite romantic. They are hunting us down, and you treat it like a game?"

Her heart was in turmoil, and she said softly, "But... if you are truly set on this, I can only accompany you."

Li Xian smiled. "My lady, please rest. I've already devised a plan. We will surely be safe tomorrow."

"Alright," Wen Caishang said. Li Xian carried Wen Caishang into the cave, removed her white robe, and, just like the previous day, performed the blood-pushing massage.

When everything was done, Li Xian practiced his martial arts outside the cave. He drew his Sinking River Sword, and the first and second layers of the Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword were displayed without reservation. The heat waves were scorching, sword light swirled, and sword energy crisscrossed...

He went through all of his martial arts once. Strange phenomena appeared around him one after another. When he finally stopped to rest, various strange sights still lingered in the air.

> [In peril but with a steadfast will. Proficiency in various sect martial arts +300]

> [You have digested the essence treasure within your body. Food Essence Proficiency +1]

> [Food Essence]

> [Proficiency: 99/100]

Li Xian's heart was as hard as iron and stone, honing his swordsmanship and light-footwork. This was not last-minute cramming, but a consistent and unshakable dedication.

> [Proficiency +1]

> [Proficiency +1]

> [Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword · First Layer]

> [Description: You have practiced your sword forms, filling them with pure Yang energy. With Yang energy of the highest purity, you have comprehended the 'Pure Yang Body' trait and the 'Heartfire' trait. Your strength, internal energy, and healing abilities... have all increased. You have condensed a great life-saving Yang Qi.]

The Qi Lake surged, and internal energy grew continuously, instantly reaching "sixty-two zhang." His internal energy was abundant, and his physical strength was also greatly enhanced. Li Xian felt as if he had infinite energy and wanted to release it immediately.

But thinking of the fierce battle tomorrow, he forcefully suppressed it. There would be a time to use it.

Li Xian thought, "Pure Yang Body trait? High-level martial arts are truly formidable. Each martial art is like an infinite treasure trove. By slowly excavating and refining the techniques, it can not only be used for combat but also for nurturing the body and breaking through bottlenecks. One can even acquire incredibly powerful traits, like a divine aura!"

"The Pure Yang Body... it has a way to resist the cold, a way to avoid poison, and endless stamina. It seems to have a peculiar attraction to women? The Heartfire trait... I just feel a fire蓄积 (accumulating) in my heart, making my blood boil. How can I utilize this trait?"

Li Xian pondered on his own.

It was rumored that in the martial world power "Cold Valley," there was a palm technique that was extremely powerful. However, when used, it would freeze one's own blood. It was a mutual destruction technique.

If Li Xian were to learn it, he could use the "Heartfire" trait to counteract the deadly side effect. His strength would increase tremendously.

Martial arts schools of thought are born this way. The more powerful the martial art, the more wondrous its effects. What is a constraint to one is an antidote to another. By combining and mastering them, one can achieve results beyond expectation.
