## Chapter 88: Malevolent Ghosts and Corpse

Xiang Wu's eyes flashed with unwillingness as he cursed through gritted teeth, but he still fled with his escaping light. Although he was cruel and evil, he was only a cultivator at the early stage of Qi Foundation, and he couldn't withstand the palm lightning from a cultivator at the Nascent Soul stage.

Seeing that Xiang Wu was about to escape, Qin Yan gestured with her hand, and a hand seal flew into the blue light. Suddenly, the blue light began to boil like hot oil being splashed with water.

With a hissing sound, a thick electric snake shot towards Xiang Wu.

In the escaping light, Xiang Wu looked back and was frightened by the electric snake's might. He hastily activated his hand seal to increase the speed of his escaping light.

Qin Yan's lips curled up slightly. She had taken out the life-preserving treasure given by her master, and she wouldn't let this evil person escape. She formed another hand seal, directing the electric snake to intercept Xiang Wu.

The electric snake struck Xiang Wu's spiritual energy shield, which shattered like a bubble. Xiang Wu was instantly obliterated in a flash of blue light.

Qin Yan let out a sigh of relief, a hint of regret on her face. She had spent a lot of effort to refine the palm lightning into a blue pearl, and her master, Yunhe, had only refined three of them, giving one to each of his three disciples as a life-preserving treasure. Now, one was gone.

However, her regret was short-lived, and Qin Yan quickly regained her composure. She beckoned, taking Xiang Wu's storage bag and spiritual treasures, and swallowed a medicinal pill to treat her injuries. Then, she fled with her escaping light.

Meanwhile, Qingling Zhen's hand-held Buddhist prayer beads exploded, releasing a strand of dark energy. The prayer beads contained the spiritual consciousness of the 108 experts who had reached the Qi Foundation stage in the Fire Spirit Gate. If one of them died, the corresponding bead would explode, regardless of the distance.

Xiang Wu had met with disaster.

"Senior Brother!" The other cultivators at the Qi Foundation stage beside Qingling Zhen looked on with grave expressions.

"You stay here," Qingling Zhen said. "The one who killed Xiang Wu must be a powerful cultivator. If we don't eliminate them, it might ruin our plans."

With that, Qingling Zhen fled with his escaping light. Unlike the Floating Cloud Valley, the master of the Fire Spirit Gate was not the most powerful cultivator, but he was still at the late stage of Qi Foundation. Now, he was personally handling the matter.

Soon, Qingling Zhen arrived at the scene of the battle between Xiang Wu and Qin Yan. He examined the corpse on the ground and was shocked. The palm lightning was from a Nascent Soul stage cultivator. Could it be the master of the Floating Cloud Valley?

After a thorough examination of the battle's traces, Qingling Zhen sneered and pulled out a talisman. He threw it into the air, and it transformed into a small beast with a rabbit's head and a mouse's body, with wings on its back. The beast sniffed the ground, flew towards the southeast, and Qingling Zhen followed with his escaping light.

...

Lin Xuan held a talisman in each hand, watching the monster before him with caution.

The malevolent ghosts guarding the spiritual herb, though numerous, were not particularly powerful. Under Lin Xuan's onslaught with various treasures, they retreated. Lin Xuan was overjoyed, preparing to finish them off and collect the herb.

However, a sudden change occurred. The wind picked up, and the remaining ghostly cultivators merged with the beast's soul, transforming into the monster before him.

The ghostly creature stood three meters tall, with eyes like copper bells and a head as large as a斗. It was shrouded in a bloody mist, emitting an intense aura of malevolence.

Although they hadn't clashed, Lin Xuan knew from the creature's aura that it was not to be underestimated. He immediately activated his flying sword, a high-quality spiritual treasure.

At the same time, he raised his right hand, and numerous ice needles formed in his palm.

Lin Xuan then released another talisman, but this time, he allowed the ice needles to absorb its magical energy.

The ice needles turned a glinting gold.

"Go!" Lin Xuan sent the ice needles, now imbued with the power to dispel evil, towards the ghostly creature. The creature let out a deafening roar, and the bloody mist surrounding it coalesced into a shield. The ice needles were blocked outside.

The spell was ineffective, and Lin Xuan's brow furrowed. Without hesitation, he released the flying sword, which was a high-quality spiritual treasure. The sword was not something the ghostly creature could easily deflect.

The malevolent ghost, aware of the sword's might, opened its mouth and released a black, fork-like treasure.

"A ghostly treasure!" Lin Xuan's expression turned grim. The ghostly creature's cultivation was far more profound than he had anticipated. Ghostly treasures were formed from a malevolent ghost's Yin energy over hundreds of years, possessing abilities akin to spiritual treasures.

The flying sword and the ghostly treasure clashed, their movements swift and unpredictable, making it difficult to determine which would prevail.

Before Lin Xuan could react further, the malevolent ghost performed another dark technique. It bit off one of its own hands, a move that stunned Lin Xuan. He didn't believe the ghost was stupid enough to mutilate itself and became even more cautious.

The severed hand fell to the ground, and the malevolent ghost spat a mouthful of blood mist onto it. The hand glowed red, and soon, a figure emerged from the mist - a corpse covered in green fur.

"Corpse transformation!" Lin Xuan had read about this technique in an ancient text. Only malevolent ghosts who had reached a certain level of cultivation could perform it, using their own flesh and blood to create a corpse. The higher the ghost's cultivation, the more powerful the corpse.

The corpse before him, covered in green fur, was likely over a century old.

Legend had it that such corpses were as hard as steel, possessed immense strength, and were formidable opponents.

Lin Xuan pulled out a talisman, infused it with his spiritual energy, and a fiery bird was formed. It flew towards the ghostly creature...

For now, he would test the creature's strength.
