# Chapter 372: The Settlement Begins

Half an hour later, at the entrance to the Sword Pavilion on the Jiangnan Road.

A figure stepped through the roiling sea of clouds, arriving through the air. Black robes billaged, his stature imposing. Within his garments, faint glimpses of dark golden armor scales could be seen slowly expanding and contracting with his breath. The newcomer was none other than Xu Yunfan.

He stood with his hands behind his back on the green stone steps before the Sword Pavilion's entrance. The Ten Extremities True Qi was retracted within him like an abyss; only the faint golden luster shimmering along his spine revealed the pressure of a Land Immortal.

The mountain wind suddenly died, and even the birds flew past in panic.

Xu Yunfan looked up at the empty gate, the corner of his mouth curling. The Ten Extremities True Qi around his body, like an abyss or a vast sea, ceased all restraint.

In an instant, a vast pressure that surpassed the Nine Realms erupted violently. The terrifying aura unique to the Land Immortal realm swept out like a furious tide, enveloping the entire Sword Pavilion in the blink of an eye.

The green stone steps at the entrance cracked and splintered; the millennium-old pines on either side snapped with a *crack*.

The Sword Pavilion disciples inside felt as if struck by lightning. Those with low cultivation levels knelt directly to the ground, bleeding from their seven orifices. Even the elders felt their internal Qi and blood roiling and stagnating, as if grasped by an invisible giant hand at their throats.

"The Jiangnan Road Sword Pavilion—this is all the spirit you possess?"

Xu Yunfan let out a light laugh, his voice like the clashing of metal and iron, echoing through the entire mountain range and making the Sword Pavilion's plaque vibrate with a *zheng zheng* sound.

The clouds atop the mountain peak were suddenly torn apart. Three streaks of sword light, like rainbows piercing the sun, landed before the gate in an instant.

The three newcomers were: one thin and dry as bamboo, with white eyebrows drooping to his cheekbones, wearing a dark sword robe and carrying an ancient sword without a scabbard. The blade was transparent as ice, with frosty mist condensing beneath his feet. His aura was like the extreme north's biting wind; wherever he passed, the stone steps were covered in ice. His "Cold Soul Sword Intent" at the peak of the Ninth Realm had reached the realm of transformation.

Beside the old man was an old woman with white hair and red eyes. Her crimson dress was adorned with sword-shaped golden bells, and she held a scarlet soft sword. When the sword was drawn, the bell sounds confused the mind, and the sword energy was like a viper's tongue. Xu Yunfan could see clearly that this scarlet soft sword was an Eighth Rank divine weapon; the sword energy it exuded made the hairs on his skin stand on end, and the leaking sword energy was specifically designed to break protective auras.

She was surrounded by a sweet, fishy scent of blood, clearly having cultivated an evil sword-nourishing technique, adept at using an opponent's essence blood to feed her sword. Xu Yunfan merely glanced at the old woman. With her cold and sharp appearance, she was definitely the type of "Annihilation Master" character.

However, his attention was mostly on the scarlet soft sword in her hand.

The other old man, with a face devoid of joy or sorrow, had blue scales on his face and leaned on a black iron dragon-headed cane. The head of the cane was inlaid with seven sword soul crystals. Although he held no physical sword, sword energy naturally generated with his every move. He cultivated the "Void冥 Sword Canon," which is extremely difficult to master in the Sword Pavilion—the philosophy of "no sword is better than having a sword." His aura was elusive, like hidden thunder in the clouds.

"Xu Yunfan, you slaughtered the Imperial Capital and still dare to challenge my Sword Pavilion?"

The white-browed sword elder asked coldly. Before his ancient sword was even drawn, the ground split open with a ten-zhang-long ice fissure along with his voice.

"Where are the people of my Sword Pavilion?"

"The people of your Sword Pavilion?"

Xu Yunfan said calmly, "You'll have to go ask them yourselves."

He swept his gaze over the three, the corner of his lips rising. "Three old fossils, you are indeed stronger than that bunch of trash."

"Why waste words with him? No matter how strong he is, how much stronger can he be? To dare speak so arrogantly, coming alone to my Sword Pavilion!"

The old woman flew into a rage. The soft sword in her hand snapped straight, and the sword bells rang out like the wailing of ten thousand ghosts. "Arrogant!"

She struck first. The soft sword transformed into a thousand red threads, each containing bone-corroding poison, wrapping toward Xu Yunfan's throat in an overwhelming net.

Xu Yunfan neither avoided nor dodged, allowing the red threads to touch his body.

The old woman was about to sneer when she saw the moment the red threads touched the black robe, the Ten Extremities True纹 (patterns) appeared on the garment. The poisonous sword was like mud entering the sea, being swallowed up completely.

That slash was executed, but it was like mud entering the sea; it failed to harm Xu Yunfan in the slightest.

The old woman's mind shook violently, her turbid pupils contracting sharply. This move of hers, "Blood River Silk Thread," was a trump card killing technique. When the sword was drawn, a thousand scarlet sword energies interwove into a net, specifically designed to break protective auras. Even a body-refining grandmaster at the peak of the Ninth Realm would be torn to pieces.

But at this moment, those poisonous sword energies, capable of corroding bone and melting metal, were completely devoured by the flowing Ten Extremities True纹 the instant they touched Xu Yunfan's robe, without even causing a ripple.

"This..."

Her withered palms trembled unconsciously, and the golden bells on the sword hilt shattered one by another.

Since reaching the Ninth Realm, this was the first time she felt a bone-piercing chill. It wasn't fear, but the instinctive shivering of prey facing a natural enemy.

Without hesitation, without probing, the old woman's hunched body suddenly straightened, and the blood energy around her erupted like a volcano.

She directly burned her life essence blood. Her crimson hair stood on end, and her wrinkled face twisted into that of a malevolent ghost within the blood flame.

Xu Yunfan's eyes lit up slightly.

This was the stance of a life-and-death struggle, the most desperate posture of Sword Pavilion warriors when facing a hopeless situation.

"Secret Martial Art, Shared Calamity!"

"Sister He, don't act recklessly!"

The white-browed elder beside her couldn't help but cry out in alarm. This Elder He had a fierce temperament. Since her full-power strike had achieved nothing, she naturally wouldn't hold back any longer.

The old woman acted as if she hadn't heard, her entire body's sword energy rising like a mountain torrent.

The sword tip hadn't even moved, yet the entire gate was already shrouded in a sweet, fishy blood mist.

The green stones on the ground were corroded with a *sizzling* sound. The Sword Pavilion disciples watching from a distance had blood flowing from their mouths and noses; they were injured in their internal organs by the leaking sword energy from afar.

This sword strike had already exceeded the Ninth Realm, faintly touching the threshold of the Land Immortal.

This sword strike was the old woman burning her own Qi and blood, using the Secret Art method to forcefully boost her spirit and energy to its absolute peak.

"Coming in hot. Much better to look at than those good-for-nothings in the Imperial Capital."

Xu Yunfan finally raised his eyes. His pupils, shimmering with a golden hue, reflected that blood-red rainbow piercing through heaven and earth.

His tone was flat, as if commenting on a wooden sword swung by a child.

The sword energy the old woman had accumulated around her finally moved, like a mountain torrent suddenly bursting forth.

That scarlet soft sword was stretched taut in the blood flame, and the blade itself disintegrated, transforming into three thousand six hundred crimson threads. Each one was entangled with the "Myriad Calamity Sword Energy" she had forcibly generated by burning her life essence blood.

Before the sword energy was unleashed, the air before the gate was already distorted like boiling water, and even the light was dyed red.

"Myriad Calamity! Kill!"

Her hunched body leaned back like a catapult, then shot forward. The three thousand six hundred blood threads spread out with her figure, resembling a crimson net that covered the sky and sun.

Wherever the sword energy threads passed, whether it was hard mountain rocks or earth and wood, they were corroded into fine black cracks!

Xu Yunfan, however, didn't even move his feet.

His right palm lifted casually, five fingers spreading like a blooming lotus. The Ten Extremities True纹 in his palm interwove into a vortex shape.

The moment the blood-thread net collided with the palm patterns, the sword energy capable of corroding the void and melting metal was like snow falling into a great furnace, completely devoured by that black hole-like pattern.

The old woman's ferocious face suddenly froze. She found her connection to the sword energy being brutally severed.

That wasn't blocking; it was plunder!

"You..."

She squeezed out half a roar from her throat, only to see Xu Yunfan flip his wrist and grab.
