# Chapter 19: First Hunt  

The next day, Qin Ziling didn't go to the martial arts school.  

Under normal circumstances, since Yin Ranyue—who was like family to him—was to be taken to the Xu Family Fort that day, it wouldn't make sense for him, as her young master, to carry on as usual and head to the city for martial arts training first thing in the morning. The most natural course of action was to stay home.  

Of course, even if Qin Ziling had gone to the martial arts school, given his status and limited abilities, the Xu Family Fort wouldn’t have suspected him in the slightest.  

Still, out of caution, Qin Ziling remained at home.  

Throughout the morning, Yin Ranyue and Cui Shi were visibly distressed, their faces etched with worry and fear. Cui Shi, in particular, couldn’t hold back her tears, shedding them in secret from time to time.  

At noon, a middle-aged peasant woman rushed into the Qin household, her face alight with excitement.  

"Sister Cui! Sister Cui! Wonderful news! Ranyue doesn’t have to go to the Xu Family Fort anymore!" the woman exclaimed as soon as she entered.  

Cui Shi, who had been winding silk thread, and Yin Ranyue both froze at the words. Cui Shi grabbed the woman’s hand, her expression a mix of tension and disbelief. "Dog’s mother, what did you say?"  

"I said Ranyue doesn’t have to go to the Xu Family Fort!"  

"Why not?" This time, both Cui Shi and Yin Ranyue heard her clearly, their eyes widening in shock.  

"I just heard the news—that Seventh Young Master Xu died last night! Cao Zhengbin and his son are rushing to the Xu Family Fort in a panic! Who knows? Maybe he drank too much or ate something spoiled at their place. Otherwise, how could a perfectly healthy person just drop dead like that?" the woman replied.  

"Dead?" Cui Shi and Yin Ranyue were dumbfounded. Never in their wildest dreams had they imagined such an outcome.  

"But it’s a good thing he’s dead! Now Ranyue won’t have to suffer at the hands of that lecherous scoundrel!" the woman added in a hushed voice.  

"Hahaha! Yes, yes!" Cui Shi suddenly burst into laughter, then took the woman’s hand and said, "Dog’s mother, thank you so much! Wait here a moment."  

With that, she hurried inside and returned with four or five eggs, pressing them into the woman’s hands. "Take these back for Dog to eat. The boy’s growing—he shouldn’t go hungry."  

"Oh, this is too much!" the woman protested.  

"It’s the least I can do. You’ve brought us such wonderful news," Cui Shi insisted.  

"Well, if you insist, I won’t refuse," the woman replied with a grateful smile before happily taking the eggs and leaving.  

As she watched the woman walk away, Cui Shi wiped tears of joy from her eyes and turned to Qin Ziling. "Son, you were right! That wicked man really got what he deserved—divine retribution!"  

Though Cui Shi spoke without thinking, Yin Ranyue, recalling Qin Ziling’s late-night excursion the previous evening, glanced at him thoughtfully.

"Mother, Ranyue, now that you can finally relax, I’ll head to the martial arts school," Qin Ziling said.  

...  

After leaving Anhe Village, Qin Ziling didn’t go to the city’s martial arts school. Instead, he wandered near a mountain range about ten li away from the village.  

For Qin Ziling, what he lacked most now wasn’t rigorous training but nourishing meat and medicinal herbs to replenish his qi and blood.  

Given the Qin family’s impoverished state, he couldn’t afford such supplements, so he had no choice but to hunt in the mountains.  

This mountain range was called Xisheng Mountain, a branch of the larger Wuyang Mountain range. Though merely a branch, it was still tall, dense with forests, and riddled with steep cliffs, jagged rocks, and teeming with poisonous insects and wild beasts.  

Only seasoned hunters dared venture into Xisheng Mountain, making it a place rarely visited by ordinary folk.  

Now, Qin Ziling was using the daylight hours to scout the area and familiarize himself with the terrain, preparing for a nighttime hunt.  

Hunting at night was undeniably perilous, but Qin Ziling had two advantages: his bronze corpse guardian and his soul-divination technique.  

The bronze corpse couldn’t be exposed to daylight, and when his soul left his body, his physical form was equally vulnerable. If discovered, the consequences could be dire—even fatal.  

Thus, while the most experienced hunters ventured into the mountains by day, Qin Ziling, a novice martial disciple with no hunting experience, had no choice but to hunt at night.  

He spent the day scouting the mountain’s outskirts and surrounding areas, identifying several suitable hiding spots for his physical body before heading home as the sun set.  

With little entertainment in rural life, villagers typically went to bed soon after nightfall.  

Once Qin Ziling estimated his family and neighbors were asleep, he donned black martial attire, armed himself with a hemp sack and a woodcutting knife, and quietly set off for Xisheng Mountain.  

Under the cover of darkness, the mountain was eerily silent, broken only by the occasional hoot of an owl that sent chills down one’s spine.  

Standing at the mountain’s base, Qin Ziling gazed up at the towering, shadowy peaks where the trees swayed like dancing demons. Gritting his teeth, he summoned the Bronze Corpse of the Arm-Swinging Ape and cautiously entered the mountain.  

Insects and snakes seemed to sense the bronze corpse’s ominous presence. Qin Ziling’s sharp eyes spotted several creatures slithering or scurrying away long before they drew near, sparing him much trouble.  

Otherwise, with the mountain teeming with venomous creatures at night, even his heightened senses wouldn’t have kept him from constant anxiety.  

With the bronze corpse leading the way, Qin Ziling soon reached a small cave he had scouted earlier.  

The cave was just large enough for one or two people. Qin Ziling had already examined it during the day—the back was solid rock with no hidden exits, ensuring no creatures could ambush him from behind as long as the bronze corpse guarded the entrance.  

Several large boulders and twisted pine trees obscured the cave’s entrance, providing cover for the bronze corpse.  

Though it was unlikely anyone would be wandering Xisheng Mountain at night, Qin Ziling, ever cautious, believed it was better to keep the bronze corpse concealed than exposed.  

Once inside the cave and confirming it was free of insects or snakes, Qin Ziling ordered the bronze corpse to stand guard at the entrance while he sat cross-legged, entering a meditative state to perform soul-divination.  

Soon, his soul leaped out, drifting from the cave into the night.  

While darkness hindered human movement, the soul’s vision was unaffected—it saw as clearly as in daylight. In fact, the soul found sunlight’s yang energy uncomfortable.  

Qin Ziling’s soul floated slowly within a two- or three-li radius of his hidden body, searching for prey.  

Before long, he spotted a plump pheasant.  

At first, he felt a surge of excitement, but it was quickly followed by hesitation. Finally, he let out a resigned chuckle.  

"A pheasant it is, then. Let’s take it!"  

With his mind made up, his soul pounced on the bird.  

The moment the soul touched it, the pheasant shuddered violently, stretched its neck, and glanced around, its eyes suddenly gleaming with an eerie intelligence.  

Soon, the pheasant seemed to recognize a direction and began striding briskly toward Qin Ziling’s hidden cave.  

Upon entering, the bird shuddered again, then immediately sensed danger and turned to flee.  

But before it could escape, the bronze corpse struck it dead with the flat of the woodcutting knife.
