# Chapter 131: Shared Solitude in the Quiet Room

In the quiet room, on the green sandalwood tea table, the tea cups were as white as snow, and a clear fragrance slowly rose, permeating the space between the two of them.

Li Qingyue looked at him, her bright eyes clear, a smile blossoming on her face as she asked, "You didn't happen to bring me a jar of fine wine, did you?"

Qin Ming, with his dark hair and piercing eyes, thought back to their old days and couldn't help but smile, shaking his head. "This gift isn't wine, but it might truly make you slightly tipsy."

"Oh, what is it then?" Li Qingyue asked in surprise, quite curious.

This quiet, elegant room held exquisite tea sets, as well as a desk with brushes, ink, paper, and inkstone. Qin Ming retrieved some paper, preparing to write the two incredibly mysterious scriptures.

Li Qingyue also rose, standing tall and graceful, and approached the desk, personally helping him grind the ink. Her spiritual consciousness was like a golden sun shining through a sea of mist, her instincts incredibly sharp. She vaguely sensed that something was happening that would influence her future.

The aroma of tea, mixed with the faint scent of ink, slowly flowed through the quiet room. After sitting down, Qin Ming quickly began to write, his spirit, qi, and essence highly concentrated, immensely serious, not wanting even a single flaw to appear in the characters. He was restoring the scriptures, making them identical to what he had seen, perfectly displaying their divine charm. After resonating with them mentally, the meanings of the scriptures would have no deviation or flaw. He even added the comments from that terrifying senior, as well as the words spoken when teaching disciples.

Li Qingyue watched his focused expression, noticing that as he wrote, the brush and ink actually emitted a faint glow. This was a manifestation of his spiritual wisdom being poured into it, indicating his complete immersion, allowing the characters on the paper to acquire spiritual vitality. Subsequently, his entire being began to glow faintly, as if resonating with the scriptures on the paper.

A grave expression appeared on Li Qingyue's fair face, as white as mutton-fat jade. She took out a crystalline and transparent nine-colored small seal, placing it in the room to prevent the faint light from spreading outwards. She approached and observed carefully. For a moment, her spiritual consciousness also fluctuated in resonance. Li Qingyue knew this was an invaluable scripture, and it was deeply connected to her.

Was this the gift Qin Ming was giving her? Li Qingyue, for once, displayed an expression unbefitting her usual ethereal composure, her small mouth slightly agape, utterly astonished, revealing a look of disbelief.

Qin Ming was utterly focused. Only when he finished the last stroke of the first scripture did he finally let out a sigh of relief. Immediately, he sensed that Li Qingyue was right beside him, reading intently, her entire being glowing, immersed in this scripture related to the Eight Trigrams Furnace. He did not disturb her, sitting quietly.

Then, he began to flip through the scripture Li Qingyue had brought. Soon, he became engrossed, naturally resonating with it mentally. Qin Ming realized that the old monsters from beyond the mortal realm were very cautious; this was not the original text. He saw images from the past: someone copying the scripture. This volume was identical to the original and should have been one or two hundred years old. Many people had read this book, but most had been stumped, leaving behind mostly negative emotions, which held no reference value. Qin Ming resonated with those people's emotions solely to memorize the content of the book. He continuously turned the pages, and before he knew it, he had reached the last page, having memorized everything. He closed the book, thinking he could call it the "Fate-Altering Scripture."

When Qin Ming looked up, he found Li Qingyue looking at him.

"I've memorized it all," he said, returning the book.

"That fast?" Li Qingyue asked in surprise.

"Yes," Qin Ming nodded.

By this time, Li Qingyue had also read through all the ink-scented papers on the desk, firmly memorizing their content. Her beautiful eyes sparkled with pleasant surprise, unexpected joy, and emotion. She said, "I won't say 'thank you'; that would be too formal." She knew that with this scripture, the near-immortal object truly belonged to her! At the same time, she didn't ask how Qin Ming obtained this incantation regarding the Six Ding Divine Flame. She understood that everyone had their own secrets, and she herself was no exception.

Qin Ming said, "Earlier at the Luofu Immortal Mountain ruins, I didn't dare transmit it to you, fearing that some omnipotent old senior might sense it, and even more, fearing they might possess you."

"I know," Li Qingyue nodded. She gently pressed her fair forehead with her hand and said, "I have already inscribed it into the core region of my spiritual consciousness. If anyone covets it, even if they succeed in possessing me, they will gain nothing; it will dissipate along with me..."

Qin Ming immediately stopped her, saying, "Don't speak such inauspicious words. I'm still waiting for you to reach near-immortal status, and then truly seek the truth!"

Li Qingyue nodded. Her pure white slender hand touched the stack of scripture papers on the desk, and immediately a faint flame appeared, rapidly turning the papers into ash. "Although I really want to keep your manuscript, for safety, it's better not to leave any traces. In the future, you can give me another copy."

"Probably two copies," Qin Ming said with a smile. As he spoke, he picked up the brush again and began to write. This time, it was the text and patterns from the metallic remnant paper, a scripture that couldn't be touched before reaching the third major realm. As he focused, his spiritual consciousness, which maintained balance, and his divine wisdom once again overflowed, filling his brush tip and imbuing the characters with essence, qi, and spirit. Li Qingyue helped him grind the ink while following along, silently reciting.

It wasn't until Qin Ming had finished writing and completely set down his brush that she was once again deeply immersed. Her dark hair cascaded down the side of her ivory-white, delicate face, and unknowingly, the ends of her hair brushed against Qin Ming, a faint clear fragrance wafting. Her entire being was ethereal and detached, as if the spiritual essence from the papers was being absorbed by her. As she finished reading, all the characters and patterns gradually lost their luster.

Li Qingyue turned her head, her hair brushing Qin Ming's face. Coming back to herself, her flowing immortal charm seemed to temporarily vanish, unable to conceal her joy and excitement. She said, "The unshakable mountain blocking my path has been removed; this is the fundamental method I've been desperately searching for." Clearly, this was the content from the "One-Page True Transmission"! In the past, Luofu Immortal Mountain was a crucial foundation for the Pure Land beyond the mortal realm. The sect-guarding scriptures there naturally had an unimaginably profound origin.

"As long as it's useful to you," Qin Ming said with a smile, then reminded her that she absolutely could not practice this fundamental method before reaching the third realm, or something bad would happen.

"I know," Li Qingyue nodded. She seemed to have genuinely let out a sigh of relief, and her brows even shone with a more radiant glow.

"You seemed to have a touch of melancholy earlier?" Qin Ming asked.

"You noticed," Li Qingyue nodded, not hiding anything. She explained that while the struggle among the core disciples had ended, as a near-immortal seed strongly nurtured by the Pure Land beyond the mortal realm, the competitive pressure was even greater. "Our lineage was at Luofu Immortal Mountain early on. A thousand years ago, the attempt to elevate the blessed land into a grotto-heaven failed, and too many accidents occurred, resulting in the loss of the fundamental method." In the past, although an "immortal seed" from Luofu Mountain had escaped and learned the scripture on the metallic remnant paper, he had quickly departed afterwards and never returned. Some said he feared being targeted by old seniors and worried about his safety, choosing to live in anonymity. Others said he might have been captured by old seniors from other orthodoxies on that very day.

Li Qingyue's lineage had also learned a fundamental method, but it was flawed. If she reached the third major realm and still hadn't completed it, she would need to consider other scriptures. The Pure Land beyond the mortal realm naturally possessed several other sect-guarding scriptures, with unimaginably profound foundations, but obtaining them without paying a price was unrealistic. Either she would have to wait several years for multiple old seniors to reach an agreement, or she would have to make significant contributions to the Pure Land to immediately exchange for them. For her, time was incredibly precious; even a year's delay would affect future competition, as several near-immortal seeds in the Pure Land had extremely prestigious backgrounds. They were competing for future dominance of the Pure Land beyond the mortal realm; whoever won would be the future decision-maker.

Some senior near-immortal seeds, backed by their clan's ancestors, held a natural advantage and extended an olive branch to her, hinting that if she allied with them, she could obtain sect-guarding level scriptures sooner. In fact, more than one party had made such excessive demands on her. After Li Qingyue refused, it became even more difficult for her to obtain the strongest-grade scriptures, requiring further delay. Competition was everywhere; even the path beyond the mortal realm was divided into several major systems. "We are considered the Pure Land lineage of the lands beyond the mortal realm. There are also Immortal Land, Yang Land, Blight Land, and so on."

Qin Ming soon realized that the young man whose physical body could turn into mist, whom he had killed on Black and White Mountain, should be from the Yang Land beyond the mortal realm. Although it was called Yang Land, it actually had a strong Yin aura. Their physical bodies and spiritual consciousness merged into one, leaning towards Yin characteristics. They believed in the ancient legend of Yin gods traveling and finally transforming into pure Yang.

"Don't compromise yourself," Qin Ming said, looking at her. Unfortunately, he was still relatively weak and couldn't help much. Perhaps only a Patriarch of a sect could freely ascend to the lands beyond the mortal realm; he was still too far from that.

Li Qingyue hummed and nodded. "Once one compromises oneself, the path to near-immortality is already cut off. Given my previous situation, there was actually nothing to fear; at worst, I would be one of the future core high-level figures of the Pure Land beyond the mortal realm. But now, of course, I must contend for the position with the most authority." Her body radiated an ethereal immortal charm, flowing with brilliant light. She was filled with boundless confidence; now that she had the strongest scripture, she no longer needed to be distracted.

"I should go now," Li Qingyue said. She took out two pieces of "Exotic Gold." One emanated a purple mist, and the other was as white and lustrous as jade. She placed them in his hands. She explained, "If refined into weapons, they can penetrate divine wisdom, Heavenly Light energy, and spiritual consciousness. To block them, one would need powerful means."

Qin Ming only took one piece, saying, "One is enough. I'll research it; you can take the other one." Li Qingyue didn't act coy and accepted one piece. Although she possessed a near-immortal object, she absolutely dared not bring it out, or something would surely go wrong.

She stood up, looked at Qin Ming, and smiled. Finally, she stepped forward and gave him a light hug. "I hope that one day, you will illuminate the night sky with Heavenly Light!" Undoubtedly, only the most powerful Patriarchs throughout history could truly achieve that step. This was the most beautiful blessing for Qin Ming, who was walking a new path.

Qin Ming knew that once she left, she would likely make rapid progress, immediately pushing for higher realms and treading the strongest immortal path in her heart. He probably wouldn't see her for a long time. He also gently hugged Li Qingyue in return, watching her depart.

"Near-immortal, not yet an immortal, still a person of the mortal world," Qin Ming called out with a smile. "If you're tired, if you're weary, you can come find me for a drink."

Though already far away, Li Qingyue still heard him. She paused, looked back, and nodded with a faint smile. Finally, accompanied by an elder, her figure faded and completely disappeared.
