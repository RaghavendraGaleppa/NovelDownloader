# Chapter 118: The Art of Divine Crafting

Hong Baichuan cursed Yin Hong in his heart, wishing him a terrible death, but on his face, he wore a beaming smile. "Brother Yin, it's quite alright. With Yunfan's talent, it's only natural that he would attract the attention of the martial world. From now on, this kind of thing will probably happen quite often."

Yin Hong laughed heartily, cupped his fist in salute without saying another word, and turned to follow the guiding disciple of the Heavenly Work Cave toward the armory to select a weapon.

Zhan Yan was deeply gratified by Xu Yunfan's immediate and decisive refusal. He reached out and patted Xu Yunfan's shoulder.

"Good lad, I really didn't misjudge you."

Xu Yunfan grinned. "Rest assured, Master, you can put your mind at ease."

That was a joke. With his Attribute Panel by his side, why would he go to the Nine曜 Sect?

The more top-tier a sect, the greater the competitive pressure within it, which would be exhausting. It couldn't compare to the ease of the Heavenly Work Cave.

Here, his seniors cared for him, and his fellow disciples were friendly. As for the relations with other departments, although they were somewhat lacking, after today, they would likely be keeping their tails tucked between their legs.

Hong Baichuan's laughter was like a great bell. Suddenly, his palm pressed down on a bronze tripod above the training ground.

The hundred-beast forging patterns carved on the tripod body trembled and hummed with the force of his palm, the overflowing energy making the disciples' robes flutter violently, causing some to squint.

"Yunfan, once you achieve the Outer Three Unifications, you may come to me to cultivate the Heavenly Work Vein-Forging Method."

Before the words had fully faded, his five fingers suddenly exerted force, and the three-inch-thick copper blank at the tripod's ear was actually crushed, leaving five finger marks. "This method can temper the internal organs as if forging black iron. It is unique among the Eight Sects of Cangzhou!"

Hearing this, Zhan Yan's expression changed, and he urged Xu Yunfan, "Hurry and thank the Sect Master. This method can be cultivated up to the Organ Refining Realm. Among the Eight Sects of Cangzhou, only our Heavenly Work Cave has a thousand years of heritage. It is truly unique."

Naturally, Xu Yunfan expressed his thanks with delight. More skills are never a burden, and one can never have too many supreme arts and secret techniques.

His Adam's apple bobbed, and he immediately cupped his fist and bowed, the knuckles striking his chest with a clang. "Thank you, Sect Master, for your cultivation!"

A smile spread across Hong Baichuan's face as he nodded. "I am going to the armory now. Elder Yin of the Nine曜 Sect is present, so I must go and host the proceedings."

After Hong Baichuan left, Zhan Yan continued, "You've fought two consecutive matches today and must be exhausted. Go and rest first. Tomorrow, I will find you and teach you the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art."

Xu Yunfan naturally agreed readily.

He was now extremely proficient with the heavy hammer and had no interest in those flimsy swords.

Just like Qi Huan, who wielded the Thousand-Layered Wave Sword with lightning speed. With a light flick of his wrist, the sword tip would burst into seven cold stars, and sparks could be generated out of thin air.

But what of it? The moment a heavy hammer fell, the opponent, fearing their sword would snap, had to withdraw their move and change their stance.

He tightened the精 steel box on his back. The friction of the fine steel locks was particularly clear amidst the noise of the Heavenly Work Department disciples cleaning the training ground. Xu Yunfan tightened the seven-inch-thick fine steel box on his back, and the gilded mace inside trembled slightly.

He tapped the lid of the box with his finger, listening to the muffled echo and pondering: "Once I break through to the Inner Unification Realm, perhaps I should use meteoric iron to recast the box body."

He had been at the Heavenly Work Cave for quite some time. Fu Jin had once told him that if a weapon box was made properly, it could even isolate the aura of a divine weapon, preventing it from being revealed.

A truly superior weapon box must make the divine weapon seem like a dormant black snake. It was said that the founder of the Divine Weapon Ridge once carried the Dragon Abyss Sword, a divine weapon, through the Nine Great Sects, and those masters were blind for three whole days.

This technique was naturally something his master Zhan Yan possessed, and his senior brother Fu Jin also knew it, but he was a bit lacking, always leaking a bit of aura when he finished making one.

According to him, his talent was inferior to his master Zhan Yan's, and he had already reached his limit.

This matter, he would have to handle himself.

With the Attribute Panel in hand, it would be a piece of cake.

Of course, his own blacksmithing talent must also be outstanding; otherwise, how could he wield this heavy hammer so well?

What made Xu Yunfan feel most comfortable, however, was that although Zhan Yan and Fu Jin were curious about the iron box he carried all day, they only glanced at it a few times. Seeing that Xu Yunfan didn't mention it, they didn't ask further, merely saying that the Mechanism Hall in the Heavenly Work Cave had better ways to carry it, and that he could go find a disciple from the Mechanism Hall to order a set when he had time.

Glancing at the few proficiency increase prompts that appeared in his vision, Xu Yunfan let out a breath.

That Nine曜 Sect true disciple, Teng Lingchuan, after a whole battle, had only contributed two or three points of proficiency increase.

What a waste!

Seven days later, deep beneath Mount Guniu, at the edge of the Thunderfire Pool in the Thunderfire Cave.

Zhan Yan stood shirtless before an anvil, his knotted muscles rising and falling with his breath like flowing magma.

Before Xu Yunfan even got close, he felt the fishy, sweet scent of dragon blood sand carried by the heatwave.

"The Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art is not in the moves, but in the breathing, the force, the intent. It doesn't emphasize the form. As long as one hammer can fall and channel the force from the entire body without the slightest waste, one has entered the doorway. Cultivating the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer gives one a natural advantage in mastering the Divine Crafting Art."

As he spoke, Zhan Yan raised a wineskin and took a large gulp of cold liquor.

"We who practice hammer arts have a natural advantage in blacksmithing and forging weapons. Since you want to see the Divine Crafting Art, watch closely."

Zhan Yan gripped the meteoric iron forging hammer, the skin of his palms glowing with a red copper luster.

"Inhale like a gushing spring of earthfire, exhale like freezing ice in a cold pool."

The sound of the heavy hammer breaking the wind suddenly arose.

Zhan Yan swung the heavy hammer with a single arm. Just as the hammerhead was about to touch the red-hot iron on the anvil, it suddenly froze.

Xu Yunfan was startled to notice that the blue bricks under Zhan Yan's feet were not cracked in the slightest, but the cold jade bricks around the anvil all sank half an inch in unison. The force was channeled entirely through the ground into the magma pool, causing the magma in the Thunderfire Pool below to churn violently.

"Don't blink!"

The hammer shadows suddenly turned into thirty-six afterimages, each strike precisely hitting the same corner of the red-hot meteoric iron blank.

Those seemingly random landing points actually conformed to the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art that Zhan Yan had taught him last night.

As the sparks flew, dragon scale cloud patterns gradually appeared on the surface of the iron blank.

Zhan Yan's wrist gave a slight shake, and the hammer tip struck the corner of the iron blank three times in a row, producing crisp sounds.

The magma in the Thunderfire Pool shot up a pillar of fire over three meters high in response, illuminating the stalactites hanging from the cave ceiling.

"Look at the direction of these dragon scale patterns."

He flicked his finger against the gradually forming sword spine.

"The Bone-Forging Method of Divine Weapon Ridge emphasizes grand and forceful movements. Thirty years ago, when I was forging a blade at Divine Weapon Ridge, the disciples in charge of managing the fire had to tread the ground barefoot, enduring the pain of burns, to temper their Copper Body Technique. Their force appeared tyrannical and fierce."

As he said this, Zhan Yan suddenly slapped the iron blank sideways with his hammerhead, and the sparks outlined a凹痕 in the shape of the Big Dipper.

"This tyrannical method can stimulate the rigidity of meteoric iron, but it damages three-tenths of its ductility. When forging heavy weapons like spears, broadswords, and heavy hammers, it's fine, but for nimble weapons like swords, it lacks a bit of agility."

Xu Yunfan saw that the凹痕 actually healed itself as the iron blank cooled, and only then did he notice that the end of the hammer handle in Zhan Yan's hand was tied with a cold jade weight unique to the Heavenly Work Cave, which was accelerating the cooling of the meteoric iron blank.

Zhan Yan顺势 spun around and switched hammers, gripping a fine tungsten steel hammer covered in fish-scale patterns. "Now, look at the Heavenly Work Cave's quenching technique."

The hammer tip rained down on the blade like a shower of drops, each strike bringing a clear and resonant tremor. "The Heavenly Work Cave's forging art can be described as carving flowers in a grain of rice. It can use an embroidery needle to carve nine-curve patterns on a sword's body. It's a pity..."
