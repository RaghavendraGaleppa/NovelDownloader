# Chapter 1: A Theft Case Triggered by a Golden Finger  

As the evening sun cast its mellow golden light through the study window, it illuminated the face of a handsome young man.  

The scene should have been peaceful, but upon closer inspection, one could see beads of sweat trickling down the young man's temples. He stood frozen, holding an ancient-looking scroll in his hands, not daring to move an inch.  

"*Spring River and Playful Ducks*—a priceless masterpiece by the legendary painter Liu Beihong from five hundred years ago. The family head has treasured this antique for years, and it's his most beloved possession. What am I supposed to do now?"  

Lin Shan, an outer disciple of the Lin family, had just been assigned to clean the family head’s study for the first time.  

As he carefully dusted the scroll, a transparent interface suddenly appeared before his eyes.  

The background was a mysterious disk divided into eight sections, each marked with symbols of the Eight Trigrams—Qian, Dui, Li, Zhen, Xun, Kan, Gen, and Kun—along with intricate carvings of mountains, birds, fish, and insects. In the center, a prompt appeared:  

**[Spring River and Playful Ducks]**  
**Ancient Essence: 5 points**  
**Absorb?**  

...  

Lin Shan was ecstatic. *After ten years of transmigration, my golden finger has finally arrived!*  

In his previous life, he had been an ordinary office worker, toiling away in a 996 company, sacrificing his youth for his boss’s dreams.  

One stormy night, his boss called him out of bed, demanding he return to the office to revise a proposal. Reluctantly, he stepped out into the thunderstorm—only to be struck by a bolt of lightning that split the sky.  

When he woke up, he found himself in another world, his soul inhabiting the body of a six-year-old boy named Lin Shan.  

This world resembled an ancient feudal society. Lin Shan was born into the Lin family of Qinghe County in the Great Song Dynasty, a mere branch family member. Orphaned at a young age, he was left to fend for himself in the outer courtyard of the Lin estate.  

As the saying went, transmigrators always started with the bare minimum—no parents, no siblings, no property—setting the stage for their eventual rise to power. Lin Shan had been thrilled at first, thinking he had finally escaped the 996 grind and was about to embark on a blessed new life.  

But ten years passed in the blink of an eye.  

No extraordinary talent for cultivation. No divine physique or mystic eyes. No hidden mentor in a ring.  

He barely scraped by in the outer courtyard, performing menial tasks while struggling to cultivate. Now, at sixteen, with adulthood looming and still unable to manifest true qi, he faced expulsion from the family. Without support, skills, or money, he’d likely end up destitute on the streets.  

Yet today, fortune had finally smiled upon him!  

With trembling excitement, Lin Shan examined the transparent panel before him. At the prompt—**Absorb Ancient Essence?**—he solemnly selected **Yes**.  

And then...  

Nothing happened.  

---  

After waiting for what felt like an eternity, Lin Shan was left bewildered. But when he refocused, he noticed something odd—the scroll in his hands suddenly felt lighter, as if something vital had been drained from it.  

The area where his fingers gripped the scroll had sunk slightly, cracks spiderwebbing across its surface, and fine dust began to sift from its edges.  

Then, with a quiet crumble, the priceless masterpiece disintegrated into a pile of dust at his feet.  

Cold sweat drenched Lin Shan’s back.  

The family head was a fanatical collector of antiques and paintings, and *Spring River and Playful Ducks* was his most prized possession. Rumor had it that he admired it every night before bed.  

Now, as an orphaned outer disciple with no connections or backing, if the family discovered he had destroyed it, the consequences would be dire—expulsion at best, crippling at worst.  

What should he do?  

Panicking, Lin Shan racked his brain but couldn’t think of a solution. He could only clean up the evidence and slip out of the study unnoticed, hoping no one would discover the loss anytime soon.  

On his way back to his quarters, he fretted over the incident while also wondering about his golden finger. What exactly was "Ancient Essence," and what could it do?  

---  

After dinner, the outer courtyard square was packed with hundreds of family members, the air thick with tension.  

Lin Shan stood among them, his heart pounding with dread.  

"Word has just arrived—*Spring River and Playful Ducks* has vanished from the family head’s study. Does anyone here know anything about this?"  

The speaker was an elderly man—Steward Lin, the overseer of the outer courtyard. He had been planning to enjoy an evening at the pleasure quarters when he was abruptly summoned to investigate the theft.  

The family head had been enraged when he discovered his beloved painting missing. Since the study had been under guard, suspicion naturally fell on the household staff.  

The square was eerily silent, the weight of the accusation pressing down on everyone.  

Lin Shan’s back was drenched in sweat. He hadn’t expected the family to react so swiftly—barely two hours had passed since he accidentally destroyed the painting.  

Still, since the scroll had turned to dust and he had erased all traces, they would never find it. Without evidence, the matter might just blow over.  

---  

But his hopes were soon dashed.  

"Let me rephrase the question—who entered the family head’s study between dawn and dusk today?"  

Steward Lin’s piercing gaze swept over the crowd, his years of authority lending him an intimidating presence.  

...  

"I went in the morning to water the flowers."  

"I went at noon to replenish paper and ink."  

A young man and woman stepped forward—Lin Fan and Lin Shu, both orphans raised in the outer courtyard like Lin Shan.  

"I went in the evening to dust and clean."  

Lin Shan forced himself to step forward, his heart racing. The task had been assigned to him the previous night, so denying it would only make him look more suspicious.  

Steward Lin questioned the stewards further, confirming that only these three had entered the study that day. He called them forward one by one.  

"Did any of you notice if the painting was still there?"  

All three shook their heads, claiming they had been focused on their tasks and hadn’t paid attention.  

Steward Lin’s expression darkened, though his tone remained coaxing.  

"You all know how valuable that painting is. None of you can afford the consequences. Confess now, and leniency may be granted."  

The three remained silent, too afraid to speak.  

The tension in the air was suffocating, the weight of countless eyes boring into their backs.  

"Search all three of them—thoroughly. And comb through their quarters. Leave no corner unchecked!"  

About half an hour later, the three had been searched inside and out, and their belongings were piled in the courtyard.  

Lin Shan’s possessions were meager—a plain iron sword, bedding, and little else.  

Lin Shu, being a girl, had a few more personal items like clothes and cosmetics.  

But Lin Fan’s pile was different. Alongside everyday items, there was a box of silver notes, a stash of medicinal pills, weapons, and even secret manuals.  

The gathered family members gasped in astonishment—most had never seen so much wealth in their lives.  

*A rich young master slumming it in the outer courtyard?*  

Lin Shan was just as shocked. *Wasn’t he an orphan like me? How did he hide all this?*  

Even Steward Lin was taken aback—his own life’s savings paled in comparison to Lin Fan’s stash.  

...  

"Lin Fan, care to explain where all this came from?" Steward Lin demanded.  

Lin Fan, still dazed, had been hiding his wealth perfectly fine until now. How had he gotten dragged into this mess?  

With a resigned sigh, he cupped his hands and spoke.  

"Steward, these are merely my personal savings. They have nothing to do with the missing painting."  

Steward Lin narrowed his eyes. "Personal savings? You’re a mere outer disciple with a monthly allowance of one string of coins. How did you accumulate so much?"  

Lin Fan hesitated, unable to come up with an explanation.  

The crowd began murmuring, piecing together their own theories.  

One of the stewards voiced the prevailing suspicion: "Could he have sold the painting on the black market or to a pawnshop?"  

Whispers spread like wildfire. *Spring River and Playful Ducks* was a five-hundred-year-old masterpiece—it could fetch a fortune from the right buyer.  

Since the painting hadn’t been found, and the other two suspects were clearly penniless, Lin Fan’s wealth made him the prime suspect.  

Steward Lin nodded slowly. "Indeed, Lin Fan was the first to enter the study this morning. He had ample time to dispose of the painting."  

The crowd’s suspicion quickly solidified into accusation.  

...  

Meanwhile, the actual culprit, Lin Shan, stood to the side, utterly bewildered.  

*Is someone else taking the fall for me?*  

He knew the truth—his golden finger had absorbed something called "Ancient Essence" from the painting, causing it to crumble to dust. He had no idea what "Ancient Essence" did, but now, by sheer luck, someone else was being blamed for his mistake.  

A small part of him felt guilty, but the relief of escaping punishment was undeniable.  

Before he could dwell on it, however, Lin Fan suddenly straightened his posture, his entire demeanor shifting.  

With a sigh, he muttered, "I suppose the time for hiding is over."  

The crowd fell silent as Lin Fan’s presence transformed. His back straightened like a drawn sword, his eyes gleaming with confidence. His robes fluttered despite the absence of wind, and a faint, enigmatic smile played on his lips.  

In a clear, resonant voice, he began his tale.  

"At the age of fourteen, I wandered into the mountains and fell off a cliff. By sheer luck, I landed on a pine tree jutting from the rockface. After surviving the fall, I discovered a hidden cave—the final resting place of a peerless master, who left behind his legacy for me to inherit..."
