# Chapter 703: Calamity Arises

This unprecedented humiliation gnawed at his Dao Heart day and night.

The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect emphasizes the cultivation of sword intent and focuses primarily on tempering the mind and spirit. Now that his spirit was obstructed, how could he speak of advancing further?

Xu Yunfan had already become his Heart Demon.

If he did not kill him, this flaw would remain in his heart.

Now, he actually sensed that the other party’s soul had left his body and dared to forcefully intrude into the Cycle Sea of Suffering, such a deadly place.

“Hiding in the Divine Thunder Mountain for thirty years, and the moment his soul leaves his body, he enters this land of death... Hmph, is he simply too young and eager to obtain the Taiyin Dark Dragon Dao Fruit that is born alongside the Sea of Suffering?”

Tong Xuan Zhenjun’s thoughts raced, instantly deducing Xu Yunfan’s purpose.

His cold laughter echoed between the icy peaks.

“Good, truly seeking his own death. The Cycle Sea of Suffering is the land of return for all dead beings; the living are forbidden to walk there. Even if a Zhenjun’s soul enters, it is like walking on thin ice. With the slightest carelessness, it will be eternal damnation.

Xu Yunfan, since you dare to set foot in this place, do not blame this Monarch for sending you on your final journey!”

How could he miss such a heaven-sent opportunity?

If he killed Xu Yunfan, his path to the Dao would be smooth and unobstructed.

He knew well the dangers of the Cycle Sea of Suffering.

It was the final destination for all living beings in the Taihua Lingxu World. Blood waves corrode bones, Yin winds erode the soul, and the chaotic flow of time and space twists and displaces everything.

For a soul to leave the body and enter was no different from cutting off one’s own foundation, placing oneself in an unprecedentedly dangerous situation.

However, for cultivators of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, this place held special advantages.

The path of the Sword Cultivator prioritizes willpower above all. The soul and will are condensed like iron, with sword intent as the core. When resisting the ubiquitous Yin winds and dead energy that erode the soul in the Sea of Suffering, they naturally possess far greater resilience than cultivators of other schools.

Moreover, when sword intent blooms, it becomes even more transparent and sharp.

A clash of minds is far more fatal than a clash of bodies.

With this thought, he hesitated no longer.

Sword cultivators seek clarity of thought. Xu Yunfan had been an obstruction in his heart for decades. If his cultivation had not regressed, it was already due to his solid foundation.

He immediately stood up, walked out of his cave dwelling, and made a slight bow toward a certain location within the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

“Please lend me the Severing Karma Sword!”

Tong Xuan Zhenjun shouted in a low voice, his divine sense like a sword, looking inward at his own body.

In the distance, though its form was unseen, only its shadow, the Severing Karma Sword rippled with a trace of obscure fluctuation, coming over.

In an instant, within the Dantian cave-heaven, a Xuan Shu Sword Soul Golden Core—formed from an extreme cold will and the sharpness that cuts through all things—suddenly burst with brilliance.

Without hesitation, he drew upon a trace of the true meaning of his origin sword soul, connecting with the fluctuation rippling from the Severing Karma Sword. It transformed into a Severing Karma Sword Intent that was formless and intangible, yet exuded an aura of severing all causality and destiny.

Then, with fierce determination, he slashed it down upon his own soul projection.

“Sizzle!”

A sharp sound perceptible only to the soul.

The moment the Severing Karma Sword fell, Tong Xuan Zhenjun let out a muffled groan. His originally condensed, substance-like Golden Core soul instantly dimmed by three points, and his aura plummeted sharply.

This was the secret technique created by the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect to enter the Cycle Sea of Suffering.

Self-inflicted severance.

At the cost of sacrificing a portion of his origin, he severed his overly strong karmic connections to the present world, greatly weakening his presence and the aura of the living. He cloaked his soul in a disguise of the dead to evade the Sea of Suffering’s most severe backlash against powerful living souls.

Only in this way could the soul of a Golden Core Zhenjun relatively safely step into that land of the dead.

The price was heavy. Unless driven by deep hatred or a heaven-defying opportunity, no one was willing to take such a risk.

Only a Golden Core Zhenjun could endure it. If anyone else were to take a slash from the Severing Karma Sword, they would likely be reincarnated three times into pigs and dogs on the spot.

The light of the Severing Karma Sword faded. Tong Xuan Zhenjun’s aura dropped to near the critical point of the Foundation Establishment realm, but the core Xuan Shu Sword Soul true meaning became even more condensed and pure, like cold steel tempered a thousand times. The Golden Core magic power within became like a pool of still water, sinking into tranquility.

He hesitated no longer. His soul, now disguised by the Severing Karma Sword, shot out of his body. It transformed into a condensed stream of cold sword soul light that almost merged with the grey background. Following the faint fluctuation left behind by Xu Yunfan, it pierced fiercely through the void, its target the Cycle Sea of Suffering.

Above the Pure Yang Peak of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

Cloud seas churned, and sword intent shone brilliantly like the sun hanging in the sky.

On the cloud platform at the peak, Lu Chunyang, dressed in a simple cyan robe, casually placed a white stone on a void chessboard.

He presided over the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and was a top powerhouse at the mid-stage of Golden Core. His Pure Yang Sword Intent pierced through the entire Southern Continent. The flow of qi inside and outside the sect could not escape his sword-sharp perception.

The moment Tong Xuan Zhenjun drew upon the Severing Karma Sword to sever his origin and his soul left his body to charge straight into the Cycle Sea of Suffering, it was like a stone thrown into a calm lake, clearly reflected in Lu Chunyang’s perception.

The finger holding the chess piece paused slightly. His deep, starry eyes lifted, his gaze seeming to penetrate layers of space to fall upon the stream of sword soul vanishing into the void at the peak of Tianji Peak.

Lu Chunyang’s face showed no ripples, as calm as an ancient well.

He already saw through the actions of Tong Xuan Zhenjun, a true disciple of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

The other party’s hatred for Xu Yunfan stemmed from the failure of the interception in the Boundary Sea, which cost him face. A deeper layer was his rejection and wariness of Xu Yunfan’s origin from the Primordial Origin Sect, yet sharing the same world and sect affinity as himself.

Tong Xuan and his like had always viewed him, an outsider, as a thorn in their side.

He could become the Sect Leader only because of the situation at the time.

He retracted his gaze, looking back at the chessboard as if he had only just startled a bothersome mosquito. He murmured softly, his voice so light only he could hear it.

“Truly seeking death.”

What kind of deadly place is the Cycle Sea of Suffering?

For Xu Yunfan to dare enter with his soul, he must have something to rely on or a backup plan; how could he be unprepared?

Even if Tong Xuan went with the advantage of a condensed sword soul, he would hardly escape the fate of being used as a pawn or even a sacrifice.

Once a sword cultivator’s mind is clouded by calamity qi, even a Golden Core can fall.

Lu Chunyang knew this clearly, but he had no intention of stopping it.

He was happy to see the infighting within the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

The fewer true disciples like Tong Xuan and Tianguang, who viewed him as a bumpkin, the more truly he could control this sword named the Ten Thousand Chariots.

An unknown dark place in the Taihua Lingxu World.

This place was neither mountain nor water; the space was twisted and unstable, as if it were separate from the Taihua Lingxu World, or like a dark fold attached to it.

Dense, near-substantial shadows flowed here, devouring all light and perception.

A middle-aged cultivator, dressed in a luxurious purple-gold Daoist robe with a handsome but pathologically pale and demonic face, sat quietly in the core of the shadows.

The qi around him was extremely obscure, like a rock merging into the darkness. If not for the faint Golden Core might, it would be almost impossible to detect his existence.

Suddenly, his deep eyes, which seemed capable of sucking in souls, snapped open.

Two points of gloomy light ignited in the darkness, carrying uncontrollable ecstasy and greed.

“Soul left the body, entered the Cycle Sea of Suffering... It’s him, Xu Yunfan!”

The voice of the White-Haired Zhenjun was deep and hoarse, yet unable to hide his delight.

He had waited for this moment for far too long, almost believing he would have to reincarnate again. If he could not advance to the mid-stage of Golden Core in this life, he might never be able to reach the Golden Core realm in the next.
