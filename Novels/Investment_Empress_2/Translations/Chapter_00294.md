# Chapter 294: Is the Ice Cube Doing It on Purpose or Not?

The private room of the young marquis of the Prince of the South was not particularly luxurious. There were no pastries on the table, only two bowls of steaming wide noodles.

One bowl for him, and one for the square-faced middle-aged man sitting opposite him.

"Good, good. It seems my training these past few months has been quite effective."

Zhong Zhenyue’s appetite increased as he saw his own name, and he loudly shouted for the shopkeeper to bring two more bowls.

"The Prince will surely see this and be very pleased," the square-faced middle-aged man said. The smile tugged at the scars on his face, not making him look ferocious, but rather experienced and ruthless.

"Father has never praised me before."

Recalling his father, the Prince of the South’s, serious expression, Zhong Zhenyue shook his head vigorously like a rattle-drum.

His father had only praised three young heroes on the Hidden Dragon List.

One was Xie Xuan, the Sword Leader of Tianshan, and the other two... naturally were the pair of young men and women who had just entered the list but ranked near the top.

Zhong Zhenyue couldn't help but regard the two of them as targets to catch up to.

"I wonder what achievements Li Mo and Ying Bing have had recently."

Zhong Zhenyue flipped directly to the second page of the Hidden Dragon List.

Nothing?

He slurped a mouthful of noodles and flipped further back. Still nothing.

"No way..."

Zhong Zhenyue muttered to himself and flipped the booklet to the first page.

"Young Master?!"

The square-faced middle-aged general saw his young master choke on a mouthful of spicy noodles and quickly passed him some water.

"Tenth... Eleventh?"

Zhong Zhenyue stared blankly at the ranking, his eyes vacant.

"Killing a Level 6 Disaster Beast at the Observation Realm, and with a numerical disadvantage? How did those two manage that?" The square-faced middle-aged man's eyes were filled with astonishment.

Having been in the military for a long time, he knew how terrifying Disaster Beasts were. Even with his Outer Scenery Realm strength, he couldn't guarantee he could kill two Level 6 Disaster Beasts simultaneously.

Disaster Beasts are cunning; they will flee if the situation looks bad.

But that wasn't the reason he fell into deep thought.

"Deep into the Southern Frontier? And they went to the Suspended Temple?"

"No wonder... no wonder..."

"Uncle Qu, what do you mean 'no wonder'?" Zhong Zhenyue took a deep breath, composed himself, and asked.

"Young Master, do you remember the recent military reports?" Qu Sheng intentionally guided Zhong Zhenyue to think.

"I remember..."

Zhong Zhenyue pondered and thought aloud:

"Recently, the Disaster Beasts in the western part of the Southern Frontier have become increasingly rampant. Along with this, many human tribes in the Southern Frontier have signs of migration..."

"The Disaster Beast tribe, the Roar Clan, has clashed with the Giant Whale Clan."

"The Great Demon of the Mingjiao Clan fought the Disaster Beast Great Demon Nine-Headed Bird in the Black Water Marsh..."

As he recalled, Zhong Zhenyue suddenly realized that the territory of the demon tribes in the Southern Frontier had become a complete mess recently.

Demons and Disaster Beasts are fighting each other? Although the two sides dislike each other, they generally don't interfere with one another.

For them to suddenly fight so fiercely, there must be a reason.

"Many Disaster Beasts have left their territories and entered the demons' domains," Qu Sheng said softly.

Zhong Zhenyue pondered and muttered:

"I heard that a pair of young man and woman have killed several Disaster Beasts that turned into Witch Spirits in the various tribal strongholds of the Southern Frontier."

He took out a portable map and sketched on it. After a moment, he reached a conclusion.

"Li Mo and Ying Bing obtained the so-called Divine Jade at the Suspended Temple, so the Disaster Beasts are chasing them? But they were blocked by the demons?"

"They need to return to Nanguan City, and they will pass through..."

Qu Sheng's eyes showed a satisfied expression.

Before Zhong Zhenyue could recover, a waiter happened to bring two bowls of noodles up at that moment, letting him hear an extremely familiar voice.

"Waiter, do you have any superior rooms?"

Li Mo led Ying Bing to the counter of the Jiawei Restaurant.

"Of course," the waiter said, lowering his head to wipe the table.

He was just about to ask if it was one room or two when he froze.

The young man was holding a sugar-painted doll in his hand, which seemed to be the image of a woman...嗯, it was obvious it was the person beside him.

The Ice Cube couldn't eat sugar through the veil, so she lifted the light gauze slightly. Half of her jade-like face was revealed, and her lips, stained with sugar juice, were glossy and moist, breathtakingly beautiful.

"Ice Cube, what flavor am I?"

"Finished."

Ying Bing's bamboo stick was empty.

Li Mo looked at her lips, which were slightly parted like broken jade. Acting on an uncontrollable impulse, he extended his thumb and wiped away the sugar juice for her.

Ying Bing was slightly stunned, then lightly licked the corner of her lips.

Li Mo: "!"

Is the Ice Cube doing it on purpose or not?

He had already managed to resist the urge to lick his own finger.

"... "

The waiter's silence was deafening. After holding back for a long time, he turned around and shouted:

---

"One superior room!"

"Wait!"

Zhong Zhenyue's shout came from upstairs.

...

A moment later.

In the private room.

"Brother Zhong, why aren't you eating the noodles you ordered?"

Li Mo didn't expect that just after learning Zhong Zhenyue had come to Qingmu City, the two of them would meet again.

Last time was at Nanguan, where the other party gave him a token.

"I... I suddenly feel very full."

Zhong Zhenyue touched his chin, not knowing where this sudden feeling of fullness came from.

If he could find the reason, the difficulty of raising military grain would drop like a stone.

"Oh, okay. Then I'll help you eat them."

"Thank you."

Li Mo licked his fingers, picked up his chopsticks, and said:

"Brother Zhong, you were doing just fine at Nanguan. Why did you come to Qingmu City?"

"......"

Zhong Zhenyue was speechless for a moment. After holding back for a long time, he said:

"I'm just... taking a stroll."

How could he say he came here to train and catch up to you two?

"This is Qu Sheng, Uncle Qu. He is also the garrison commander of Qingmu City," Zhong Zhenyue introduced the square-faced middle-aged man who had been watching the two of them.

"I have long heard of the names of you two young geniuses," Qu Sheng said with a slight nod.

Zhong Zhenyue couldn't help but admit defeat and sighed:

"Brother Li, you were actually able to go deep into the demon tribes of the Southern Frontier to hone yourself. From the start, in terms of determination and courage, I have already lost to you."

"Hone myself?"

Li Mo shook his head and pointed at the Ice Cube beside him. "I went to find her."

Ying Bing spoke coldly and clearly: "To pick stars for him."

This was her usual demeanor.

It was just that she couldn't maintain her usual demeanor when it came to a certain person.

Zhong Zhenyue: "......"

Qu Sheng: "......"

It was just... suddenly very awkward.

"Are the two of you planning to return to Nanguan all the way?" Qu Sheng suddenly asked.

"That's right."

Qu Sheng was silent for a moment and said, "Then I suggest the two of you stay in Qingmu City for a period of time. This place is, after all, a large human city and can avoid the danger of Disaster Beasts."

These two little fellows have already shown their sharp edges. As a future powerhouse like this, he naturally wanted to make friends with them.

"Hmm..."

Li Mo thought it over slightly.

He did need a quiet environment to perfect the Seventy-Two Transformations and comprehend the Somersault Cloud.

Sharpening the axe doesn't delay the chopping.

Moreover, just now when he looked at those little children, he couldn't help but think of Lu Fuying, and there was a promise to the little girl that he hadn't fulfilled yet.

He looked at Ying Bing, and the young girl gave a slight nod.

"Then many thanks, Commander Qu."

After Li Mo finished thanking him, he felt a bit embarrassed. "Ah, I have another matter I'd like to ask Commander Qu for help with."

"Please, speak freely."

"When I passed through Baoping Town, I promised to help a family deliver a letter. I wonder if there is a soldier named Lu Yi in your army that you could help me find?"

Qu Sheng's eyes showed surprise, and after a long while, he looked somewhat gratified.

He agreed to the matter and promised to help look into it.

Zhong Zhenyue took a deep breath and invited with a burning gaze:

"Coincidentally, I also need to find someone. Why don't you come with me to the military camp, Brother Li?"

He still remembered how Li Mo had guided many people back in Yunchzhou.

And the young girl beside him, her mastery of martial arts was even more unfathomable.

He wanted to use the military formation to feel just how big the gap was between him and Li Mo.

"The soldiers are crude, especially in the military, where they speak without restraint. I'm afraid they might easily offend Young Hero Li," Qu Sheng said with a frown.

The soldiers are all rough men.

Young Hero Li looks as elegant as jade and a gentleman, easily mistaken for a weak scholar or a young master from a noble family with no martial ability.

"We'll persuade them with virtue," Li Mo said with an unconcerned smile.
