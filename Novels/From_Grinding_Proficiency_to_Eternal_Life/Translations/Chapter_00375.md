# Chapter 375: The Five Great Sects of the World

The spiritual energy of the entire Tianzhu Peak’s earth veins was brutally torn apart. Under the terrifying pressure, the mountain let out a groan of unbearable strain. Countless ancient pines, palace halls, and stone steps turned to dust even before the hammer strike descended!

*Boom!!!*

The hammer force struck the ground like a collapsing heaven pillar.

Centered around the Sword Sect’s gate, the earth veins within a radius of ten miles shattered inch by inch. The mountain collapsed like tofu, and countless Sword Sect disciples were ground into a mist of blood by the violent true qi before they could even scream.

The elders watching from afar were terrified out of their wits. They desperately activated their protective sword qi, but the shockwaves still made their seven orifices bleed. Those with slightly weaker cultivation exploded on the spot!

When the dust settled, the entire Sword Sect mountain range had completely collapsed. Only a solitary Scripture Pavilion stood at the edge of the ruins—Xu Yunfan had intentionally protected it with his true qi.

He retracted his hammer and stood tall, his gaze sweeping over the few surviving Sword Sect disciples scattered in the ruins—only a handful remained. He said indifferently, "From today on, this place belongs to my Dao Sect."

"..."

His gaze fell on the crimson soft sword left behind by the old woman He Yilin. With a wave of his hand, the sword was drawn into his grasp.

"Yousi..."

Looking at the two characters engraved on the crimson blade, the sword trembled slightly like a living creature, emitting a faint, unwilling hum.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained calm. The pressure of a Land Immortal Realm expert erupted, and the Ten Extremes True Qi spread from his fingertips to the hilt. The sword spirit immediately acted as if struck by lightning, its self-condensed crimson sword light dissipating inch by inch.

"A mere eighth grade, and you dare to defy me?"

He clenched his five fingers, and the soft sword obediently coiled around his waist like a red snake. The violent blood patterns on the sword spine now flowed gently, turning the blade into a玄铁 (titanium-iron) belt that fastened tightly against his dragon scale armor.

The aftermath of the Sword Sect’s destruction had yet to settle, but Xu Yunfan’s figure had already pierced through the void, arriving directly at the "Minor Mount Sumeru," where the Maitreya Temple was located.

This mountain was known as "The First Pure Land of the Buddhist Zen Sect." The golden summit at the peak was bathed in Buddhist light, and the temple housed the舍利 (sarira) of历代高僧 (past generations of eminent monks). It also had the temple-guarding divine weapon, the "Great Sun Tathagata Seal," to suppress its fortune.

However, when Xu Yunfan’s Ten Extremes True Qi poured down like a reversed Milky Way, all compassion became illusory.

Without a word, he raised his hand and unleashed a move from the Eight荒 Dragon Fall Hammer Technique: "Heaven’s Collapse." The Mountain-Shaking Sea-Subduing Hammer, carrying the phantom of a crimson-gold flood dragon, smashed toward the temple gate.

Before the hammer force even arrived, the罡 wind (sword qi) had already torn apart large sections of the buildings. The thousand copper Buddhas inside the temple cracked simultaneously, and the bell and drum towers collapsed with a rumble.

The abbot, Cihang, attempted to block it with the "Vajra Demon-Subduing Ring," but the hammer force shattered his divine weapon, and his true qi was sucked away, turning him into a dried corpse.

In just three breaths, the earth veins of the entire Minor Mount Sumeru were drained. The mountain collapsed from the summit downward, sinking the Scripture Pavilion, Arhat Hall, and Sarira Pagoda into the abyss.

The surviving elders formed the "Ten Thousand Buddhas Paying Homage" formation, intending to fight to the death. Xu Yunfan sneered, and his Ten Extremes True Qi transformed into a gaping Taotie mouth, devouring the vitality of the hundred martial monks in the formation.

Abbot Kuchan ignited his lifespan to activate the "Great Sun Tathagata Seal." The Buddhist light burned like the scorching sun, but Xu Yunfan’s spine blazed with golden light. His Ten Extremes True Qi roared like a furious tidal wave, and with a backhanded slap, the Buddhist seal shattered on the spot.

Kuchan’s essence and blood were drained, turning him into a dried corpse.

In the end, the millennium-old foundation of the Maitreya Temple became ruins. Only half a broken stele inscribed with the words "Amitabha" remained, soaked in blood mist.

At dawn the next day, Xu Yunfan set foot on the "Xuanzhen Mountain" in Qingzhou.

This mountain was shrouded in mist year-round. The Xuanzhen Sect was famous throughout the world for its Dragon and Tiger True Qi, practicing the path of yin and yang to harmonize Dragon and Tiger. The elders of the sect all cultivated the "Dragon and Tiger Dan Qi."

However, as soon as Xu Yunfan arrived at the foot of the mountain, he劈开 (cleaved open) the protective sea of clouds with a single sword strike. The lingering sword qi cut the "Ascending Heaven Ladder" on the mountainside in half.

The three great elders of the Xuanzhen Sect jointly offered the "Black Tortoise Treasure Armor." The armor drew upon the earth veins to form a hundred-zhang Black Tortoise phantom, but Xu Yunfan shattered the tortoise shell with a single hammer strike. The rebounding force震碎 (shattered) the Three Pure Ones Hall at the summit, reducing the ancestral jade statue inside to dust.

The Grand Elder roared, "Xu Yunfan! How dare you insult the Ancestor of the Dao?!"

Xu Yunfan sneered in response, "You lot stole from the people under the guise of incense offerings. Do you even deserve to speak of the Dao? You should have foreseen this day when you chose your side earlier."

Before his words faded, the Ten Extremes True Qi swept through like a mad tide, and the Black Tortoise Treasure Armor disintegrated inch by inch.

The Second Elder drew upon his refined Dragon and Tiger True Qi to manifest a martial arts avatar—the Heavenly Teacher Subduing Demon Form. As soon as the form manifested, thunderclouds pressed down from above.

Xu Yunfan neither avoided nor dodged, allowing the avatar to descend upon him. He then反手 (backhandedly) refined it for his own use. After absorbing the Second Elder’s true qi, he pointed a finger, and the Second Elder’s head exploded.

The remaining disciples, led by an elder, formed a sword formation.

Xu Yunfan’s expression turned icy. His gaze swept over them, pausing imperceptibly on禹静珊 (Yu Jingshan) below.

Yu Jingshan stood at the edge of the sword formation, inconspicuous. Her青丝 (black hair) fluttered violently in the raging qi.

At this moment, her expression was resolute, her brows sharp as blades. The three-foot green锋 (sword) in her hand vibrated incessantly.

Her robes were torn in several places by the fierce wind, revealing the muscular, dragon-like red筋肉 (muscles) beneath—a sign that she had cultivated the "Xuanzhen Bone Forging Art" to the great success stage of "Golden Marrow Mercury Slurry."

With a clear cry, her vital energy and blood exploded like a furnace. The qi of the three hundred disciples in the sword formation汇聚 (converged) at the tip of the elder’s sword,凝出 (condensing) a phantom "Heavenly Sword" over ten zhang long in mid-air. Wherever the sword edge pointed, even the mountain mist was割开 (cut) by the sharp sword intent, creating a wave of clouds.

Xu Yunfan’s gaze lingered for a moment on her tightly clenched knuckles. The tiger’s mouth of her palm had already split open with blood trails due to the extreme eruption of her vital energy.

But that fleeting, vague sense of恍惚 (daze) in his heart vanished in an instant. He反手 (backhandedly) drew the Blood River Yousi Sword from his waist.

The moment the crimson sword edge left its sheath, it erupted with a刺目 (dazzling) blood light under the infusion of the Ten Extremes True Qi. The sword body trembled like a starving beast.

"The first move of Pure Yang Three Forms: Sea of Flames."

He uttered the final two words softly, yet it sounded like a fire god’s decree.

Violent Pure Yang sword qi surged from the sword edge, and the scorching golden flames instantly swallowed the entire sword formation.

The so-called Heavenly Sword phantom that could manifest Dragon and Tiger, upon contact with the sword qi, melted like snow meeting boiling water, dissipating inch by inch.

Inside the sword formation, Yu Jingshan’s pupils contracted sharply, her eyes filled with terror. Before she could make any move, she saw the golden fire waves roaring over her vision...

Where the sword qi passed, a golden line simultaneously appeared at the waists of the three hundred Xuanzhen disciples.

The next moment, a blood waterfall surged into the sky, turning into red mist under the Pure Yang True Fire before it could even hit the ground.

The mountain rocks vitrified in the high temperature, and the stream water boiled and炸裂 (exploded). Even the "Xuanzhen Precepts" stele engraved on the main peak’s cliff for six hundred years melted into magma under the wash of the fire waves, flowing down the stone steps into dazzling golden-red streams.

When Xu Yunfan sheathed his sword, the entire main peak had turned into scorched earth.

Only the elder’s half-broken sword remained插 (planted) in the ground, the hilt still burning with焦痕 (scorch marks).

Xu Yunfan glanced at it and turned to leave without hesitation.

Stepping through the void, he shot toward the direction of the Nine Luminaries Sect.

The Nine Luminaries Sect occupied the Nine Luminaries Mountain in Yanbei Dao. The sect was founded on the "Nine Luminaries Swallowing Qi Art." Its disciples all possessed robust vital energy and blood. Relying solely on their physical bodies, they far exceeded martial artists of the same realm.
