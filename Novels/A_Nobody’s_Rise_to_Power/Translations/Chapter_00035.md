# Chapter 35: Silver Tongue

After discussing matters with Li Youcai, Yang Can went to pay his respects to the Clan Head.

Generally, unless a matter was of utmost urgency, there was no need to report directly to the Clan Head; approval from the head of the branch was sufficient.

Even for critical matters, it was the branch head who reported to the Clan Head. A steward could not skip levels to report directly.

Unless one was an external steward like Yi She, who held power equivalent to a regional governor and possessed a different status altogether.

However, the main branch of the Yu family was currently in a special situation. The master of the main branch had passed away, and the status of the mistress was not yet settled.

By first paying his respects to Yu Xinglong, Yang Can was demonstrating his attitude and stance.

At that moment, Yu Xinglong was tutoring his son.

Raising an heir in a powerful family was no easy task, requiring decades of persistent cultivation.

A successor to a great clan first had to study various academic classics to shape his fundamental moral and value systems.

After that, he had to learn the classics of governance to master strategy, learn how to manage regions, and possess the art of commanding people.

He also had to learn poetry and literature, which were essential for showcasing his talent in social settings.

Simultaneously, he had to study etiquette and family rules, cultivating a mind of filial piety and brotherly respect, and inheriting the family traditions.

Upon reaching adulthood, he had to engage in administrative practice, learning from the elders through their words and actions to be tempered.

Yu Chengye had previously been in the stage of "administrative practice."

Now that Yu Xinglong had established his younger son, Yu Chenglin, as his heir, and knowing that his own health was frail and not indicative of a long life, he felt an urgent need to teach his son by example.

He now made time every day to inquire about his son's studies and, in the process, imparted some strategies for managing the world.

Yu Chenglin was still too young to understand such profound matters.

Yu Chenglin could only resort to force-feeding education, making his son memorize things whether he understood them or not.

Hearing that Yang Can requested an audience, Yu Xinglong felt slightly surprised.

Seeing his son wearing a pained expression as he tried to memorize the principles he had been taught, Yu Xinglong smiled helplessly and waved his hand. "You may return for now."

Yu Chenglin felt as if he had received a great pardon. He quickly took his leave from his father and left the study.

Only then did Yu Xinglong call for someone to bring Yang Can in.

Upon seeing Yu Xinglong, Yang Can reported that the accounts had been sorted out and that he planned to inspect several manors.

Yu Xinglong looked at the ledger with the special markings and asked in surprise, "So quickly? How many accountants did you use?"

Yang Can said, "Your subject sorted them out personally. Regarding ledgers, your subject does have some knowledge."

Yu Xinglong raised an eyebrow. The entire family's accounts were summarized with him; how could he not understand ledgers?

To have these ledgers sorted out so clearly in such a short time, it was far more than just "having some knowledge."

Yu Xinglong pondered for a moment and said, "You wish to go on an inspection. That is well. Inspection is necessary, but making a grand spectacle of it would be inappropriate."

Yang Can bowed slightly and said, "The Clan Head is right. Your subject has discussed this with Steward Li. Your subject will handle the matter with discretion."

Yu Xinglong smiled. "Mm. Many things cannot be accomplished in one go. I hope these manors and pastures can be taken over smoothly and steadily."

Yu Xinglong did not dare to hope for a great harvest this year immediately after taking them back. As long as it was not much worse than before, that would be enough to explain to the entire clan.

"Yes, your subject will remember the Clan Head's teachings."

"Mm. Have you consulted the Young Mistress yet?"

"After reporting to the Clan Head, your subject will go to consult the Young Mistress."

Yu Xinglong was even more satisfied upon hearing this. This man truly knew his place.

In that case, he could rest assured and let him go on the inspection. He needed to make the managers of those manors and pastures clear who their new master was.

Yu Xinglong smiled and said, "In the future, you should still report to the Young Mistress first. Although you had some unpleasantness with the Suo family in the past, the Suo family's daughter is now the daughter-in-law of the Yu family. She is now the mistress of the main branch. You should still maintain the respect she deserves."

Yang Can bowed and said, "Yes, your subject will strictly follow the Clan Head's instructions."

Yu Xinglong stroked his beard and smiled, nodding. "Go ahead."

Suo Chanzhi's personnel restructuring of the inner residence continued.

Relying on Qingmei and the few matrons brought from her maiden family, the people of the "Late Young Master Faction" in the inner residence were continuously being marginalized.

Since the news of her pregnancy spread, the Young Mistress's prestige and authority had risen again, making her purge more forceful.

Some opportunists had already shown intentions of leaning toward the Young Mistress, but Suo Chanzhi did not particularly want to accept them.

She still had to face new challenges in nine months and did not want to keep people she could not absolutely trust by her side.

However, such matters could not be completed in just a day or two. She still had nine months, so there was no need to rush.

"Young Mistress, Steward Yang Can requests an audience."

Qiaoshe walked quickly into the flower hall to report to Suo Chanzhi, who was about to put a piece of preserved fruit into her mouth.

"Let him in," Suo Chanzhi said, glancing at Qiaoshe. This girl was also one of the people she planned to clean up.

Qiaoshe was originally a servant girl in the Clan Head Madam's courtyard and had been sent by the Madam to her son's side.

Now, she was clearly the eyes and ears of the Madam watching her daughter-in-law.

Qiaoshe responded crisply and walked out.

She wore a narrow-sleeved, short jacket in lotus root color, a moon-white skirt tied at the waist, and a light green silk ribbon around her waist, giving her a neat and playful look.

Soon, Yang Can was led into the flower hall. The originally languidly reclining Suo Chanzhi was now sitting gracefully.

She wore a jade-colored, large-sleeved robe with dark green entwined branch patterns. Apart from a pair of bright white pearls on her earlobes, she had no other adornments.

Upon seeing Yang Can, Suo Chanzhi asked calmly, "Steward Yang, is there a reason for your visit?"

Yang Can bowed and said, "Young Mistress, the accounts for the manors and pastures taken over by the main branch have been sorted out. I wish to go down and conduct a field inspection."

Suo Chanzhi was a bit puzzled. Wasn't it said that I am responsible for controlling the inner residence while you control the outer residence? Why are you going to inspect manors?

Although she did not understand his intention, Suo Chanzhi knew that Yang Can must have his reasons for doing this.

Forget it, I will agree first and have Qingmei ask for the details later to tell me.

"That is well. However, the Yu family makes its living from farming, and this is a critical time for spring plowing. If one season is missed, a whole year is lost. You must be cautious in all your actions on this trip."

"Your subject will remember it in his heart."

Suo Chanzhi shifted to a more comfortable sitting position. A young lady from a great family, her every move was exceptionally elegant.

"How long do you expect this inspection trip to take?"

"Your subject plans to inspect only three manors. I believe a month will be sufficient."

Suo Chanzhi nodded slightly. "Qingmei has been by my side since she was a child. She understands the methods for managing tenant farmers, collecting rents, and supervising workshops and laborers. She is also quite skilled in calculation. Let her accompany you as an assistant."

Yang Can was about to agree when he suddenly noticed Qiaoshe standing to the side, listening intently.

This girl was not Suo Chanzhi's dowry maid. Thinking of this, Yang Can's expression immediately turned unsightly.

"Young Mistress, do you not trust your subject?"

Suo Chanzhi smiled faintly. "Steward Yang, why do you say that?"

Yang Can said in a deep voice, "Young Mistress, your subject was personally appointed as the Second Steward of the main branch by the Clan Head! Originally, if Young Mistress appointed a Second Steward who only served within the inner residence, your subject would say nothing. But inspecting the territories is an external matter..."

Suo Chanzhi secretly praised him. This fellow's reaction is so quick, and he acts so convincingly.

Suo Chanzhi's face turned cold. "So what if my father-in-law appointed you? Does this mistress not have the authority to manage the main branch, whether internally or externally?"

Yang Can said, "Your subject did not say that. Your subject only... That girl Qingmei, a little丫头 who hasn't even grown her hair out yet, what can she do by following your subject to inspect the territories?"

"What did you say... that this maid is useless?"

Qingmei happened to be walking into the flower hall. Upon hearing this, without thinking, she instinctively wanted to retort.

But after taking the bait, she realized this topic was a bit hard to handle.

Most importantly, Yang Can's words had unfortunately hit the mark, making the young girl feel both ashamed and angry.

Qingmei's little face flushed red as she forcefully changed the subject, afraid that Yang Can would laugh at her. So she unleashed a torrent of words, not giving Yang Can any time to think.

"Steward Yang, you're not old, but your face is as big as a millstone! You talk so clearly about the inner and outer residence. But in the outer residence, this young lady hasn't seen you accomplish anything. You're just a flashy but useless ornament. The Young Mistress sending me to inspect the manors with you is to give you face. What, are you afraid? Afraid that I'll expose your greasy, fake accounts?"

Yang Can smiled and said, "This Steward is going to inspect the manors to handle farm matters. To see if the manor heads are diligent, to check if there are errors in the accounts. Then we punish those who should be punished and reward those who should be rewarded. This is not like taking a little girl on a stroll in the garden!"

"If you want to take this young lady on a stroll in the garden, that's only if this young lady is willing! Stop being so full of yourself. As for the things you mentioned, if Steward Yang can do them, this young lady can do them just the same."

Qiaoshe chimed in with a smile, "Sister Qingmei, Steward Yang is right. The manors are full of troublesome matters. Are the manor heads diligent? How are the tenant farmers and retainers managed? Are there any bullies causing trouble? Are there any who abuse their authority? And there are miscellaneous matters in the manors: livestock, farm tools, storehouses, everything needs to be checked. You have to account for things like thin horses, sick oxen, and rusty plows. It's not easy. Steward Yang means well. Sister Qingmei, you'd be better off staying at the manor to save yourself the trouble."

Suo Chanzhi gave her a cold glance, then turned to Yang Can, her tone also a bit unpleasant.

"What? Does this Young Mistress, who manages the main branch, not have the authority to give orders?"

Yang Can said, "The Young Mistress's orders, your subject naturally dares not disobey. But if any trouble is caused by Miss Qingmei, your subject will not take the blame for others."

Suo Chanzhi and Yang Can were singing a duet, but little Qingmei was getting a bit carried away by the argument.

She put her hands on her slim waist and said defiantly, "This young lady has served the Young Mistress for many years and has never made a mistake. How long have you served the Young Mistress to dare speak so wildly? This young lady will definitely do better than you when I go."

Suo Chanzhi's heart skipped a beat, and she immediately glanced sideways at Qingmei.

The little girl was glaring angrily at Yang Can, her apricot eyes wide open as if she wanted to spit fire.

Suo Chanzhi's heart relaxed. It turned out she had spoken without thinking. That's fine then.
