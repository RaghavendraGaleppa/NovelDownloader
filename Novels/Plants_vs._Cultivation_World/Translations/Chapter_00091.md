# Chapter 91: The Koi's Transformation

The true disciple assessment commenced under the watchful eyes of everyone in the Qinglu Sect. However, as a closed-door examination, only the sect leader and peak masters were permitted to observe—ordinary disciples had no such privilege. 

The assessment covered extensive content, involving many secrets of each participant, making it inappropriate for public viewing. The sect designed these rigorous tests for a simple reason: true disciples represented the core of the sect, future Golden Core seeds, potential candidates for sect leader and peak masters—individuals who would shape Qinglu Sect's destiny. Given their importance, the evaluation couldn't be simple. 

Only the most outstanding inner disciples could qualify as true disciples. 

Though the assessment details remained confidential, the rankings of participating inner disciples were updated daily for the sect to track. Currently, the top-ranked was He Shaogang, the newest inner disciple. 

Despite not having the highest cultivation level, He Shaogang excelled in potential and foundation—key metrics for the assessment. His ability to surpass inner disciples at the peak of Qi Refinement or even Foundation Establishment spoke volumes about his talent. 

Following He Shaogang were familiar names—long-standing top performers among inner disciples. However, another newcomer soon appeared, directly claiming the sixth spot: Yuan Niya, who had also joined the sect only a few years prior. 

"Not bad, ranking sixth," Gu Mo mused, slightly surprised. Considering Yuan Niya had undergone his perfected Cleansing Technique, her foundation was six times stronger than her peers. That she only ranked sixth highlighted the depth of talent among Qinglu Sect's inner disciples. 

Scanning further down, Gu Mo spotted another familiar name at ninth place—Ye Yuqi. Due to the earlier incident involving Chu Feifei, Gu Mo had learned about Ye Yuqi from Yuan Niya, who had mentioned his usual fifth-place ranking among inner disciples. His drop to ninth was concerning—one more slip, and he might miss the true disciple selection entirely. 

Qinglu Sect only had nine true disciple slots, awarded to the top nine in the comprehensive ranking. Naturally, every inner disciple fought fiercely for these positions. However, the current rankings were preliminary—subsequent assessments and the second-stage trials would reshuffle the order. 

Still, the current standings held significant reference value.

Ye Yuqi glanced at the latest rankings and snorted before walking away. He had anticipated this outcome. While other inner disciples spent resources to strengthen their foundations, he had funneled all his assets into hiring an assassination organization. 

His target? Yuan Niya. 

The reason was simple: only with Yuan Niya dead could he secure Chu Feifei. The unique fragrance emanating from Chu Feifei was crucial to his Dao path. Yuan Niya's interference was tantamount to severing his future—an unforgivable offense. 

Of course, Ye Yuqi wouldn't act personally. Getting caught would at least result in expulsion, if not execution by the Enforcement Hall. Fortunately, he had stumbled upon an assassination group's hideout in the market and decided to test his luck. 

To his surprise, the organization accepted the contract—a rare move, given the risks of targeting an inner disciple of a major sect like Qinglu. The signed contract carried severe penalties for non-compliance, but Ye Yuqi had paid a steep price, nearly bankrupting himself. 

Yet, he deemed it worthwhile. Yuan Niya's death would grant him access to Chu Feifei, whose fragrance could elevate his nasal divine ability, securing his position as the undisputed top inner disciple. 

As for the risks, Ye Yuqi believed his precautions were sufficient. Surely, a minor conflict with Yuan Niya wouldn’t immediately implicate him if something happened to her. Besides, for the sake of his Dao path, some risks were acceptable.

After reviewing the rankings, Gu Mo returned to his cottage. The true disciple assessment would last at least half a year, given its extensive and confidential nature. 

For Gu Mo, this was good news—it gave him more time to prepare. Six months were enough to significantly boost his combat capabilities. 

"It's about to transform!" 

Gu Mo crouched by the paddy field as a golden koi swam over eagerly, begging for food. Lifting it from the water, he noted that only a few red scales remained on its belly. After years of feeding it solar essence, the koi was finally on the verge of metamorphosis. 

This koi, nurtured by Gu Mo's solar essence, held great promise. Unlike ordinary red or white koi, this golden variant was exceptionally rare. 

"Here’s something special for you." 

Gu Mo produced a second-grade solar essence to aid the koi's transformation. The koi's mouth gaped excitedly, and Gu Mo fed it the essence. 

Instantly, the koi thrashed as if scalded by lava, darting through the water with such speed that its fins and tail left afterimages—no, not afterimages, but actual growth. Its fins and tail elongated into flowing, phoenix-like appendages. 

With its resplendent golden tail, the koi glided through the water like an aquatic immortal. Suddenly, it leaped—not back into the water, but into the air, swimming through the ambient spiritual energy as if it were water. 

Simultaneously, the surrounding spiritual energy coalesced into dark clouds. The koi flicked its tail and soared into the clouds, weaving among them like a golden dragon summoning rain. 

Gu Mo watched in awe as a downpour of spiritual rain began. 

"This is... the Minor Cloud Rain Technique, and at the perfected level!" 

For a newly ascended spirit beast to immediately master a perfected-level technique was extraordinary. Most spirit beasts only awakened basic innate techniques, while those with noble bloodlines might achieve proficient-level techniques. A perfected-level technique at birth was exceedingly rare. 

"Could it really have dragon lineage?" Gu Mo wondered, recalling the vendor's claims when he bought the koi. 

More likely, the solar essence had unlocked latent potential in the koi's bloodline. Regardless, its prowess was undeniable. 

With a perfected Minor Cloud Rain Technique—surpassing even Gu Mo's proficient-level mastery—the koi could now manage the spirit fields in his absence. This was perfect timing, as Gu Mo would soon accompany Yuan Niya on her true disciple trials. 

Waving to the koi frolicking in the clouds, Gu Mo watched as it circled him playfully. He stroked its smooth scales and produced a spirit beast contract from the Beast Taming Peak. 

Previously, the koi had been a pseudo-spirit beast, ineligible for a formal contract. Now, as a true spirit beast, it could bond with Gu Mo. 

Pricking his finger, Gu Mo signed the contract with a drop of blood. The parchment burned, transforming into a streak of light that entered the koi. 

The koi offered no resistance, and the contract was sealed. Through it, Gu Mo sensed the koi's joy and could vaguely interpret its emotions. 

"From now on, your name is Xiao Li." 

The koi—now Xiao Li—seemed delighted with its new name.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, this fish is gorgeous!" 

Yuan Niya and Chu Feifei stared in awe at Xiao Li, now summoning rain over the fields. 

"It's my spirit beast. Don’t even think about taking it," Gu Mo said firmly. With its perfected rain technique, Xiao Li was an invaluable assistant. 

"Hmph, I don’t want it anyway. What use is a fish in battle?" Yuan Niya scoffed. As a fire-aligned cultivator, she preferred combat-oriented spirit beasts. 

"Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be busy with the assessment?" Gu Mo asked. 

"The assessments aren’t daily. We go when it’s our turn," Yuan Niya explained. 

With the lengthy evaluation process, disciples had ample downtime, which Yuan Niya used to train with Gu Mo and Chu Feifei. 

Over the next six months, the trio frequently gathered for extended cultivation sessions—sometimes lasting days—with Yuan Niya's master's permission. 

Their progress was remarkable: Yuan Niya neared the sixth layer of Qi Refinement, her ranking climbing to fifth. With a breakthrough, she could rise further. 

Gu Mo, too, felt his soul condensing, on the verge of manifesting divine sense—a hallmark of Foundation Establishment. 

Chu Feifei's breakthrough to mid-Qi Refinement had triggered a surge of her fragrant aura, accelerating both Gu Mo and Yuan Niya's progress. 

Though Gu Mo's cultivation only advanced from early to peak sixth-layer Qi Refinement, his bottleneck would soon break. Meanwhile, he invested his daily solar essence into upgrading his plants. 

As he surveyed his accumulated botanical arsenal, a sudden ripple erupted from his brow. 

In an instant, his awareness expanded, encompassing everything within hundreds of meters. 

"This is... divine sense!" 

After a stunned pause, joy flooded Gu Mo's eyes.
