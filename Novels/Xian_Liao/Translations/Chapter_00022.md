# Chapter 22: First Kill

Dingtai Restaurant.

"Scholar Zhou, this is Young Master Zhang from the Zhang family." Miss Lin was still dressed in male attire, but today she wasn't the host—she was merely accompanying.

When Zhou Qing arrived, Miss Lin personally came downstairs to greet him and briefly explained the background of this Young Master Zhang.

Old Master Zhang was a former provincial graduate who had served as a county magistrate before retiring to a life of seclusion, building a meditation hall where he rarely received visitors. All family affairs were managed by this Young Master Zhang.

Young Master Zhang had earned his xiucai degree two years prior, making him Zhou Qing's senior in scholarly terms. Moreover, Young Master Zhang's grandfather—though deceased—had been a metropolitan graduate, and the examiner who had ranked Zhou Qing first in the prefectural exams, Examiner Lu, had been his student.

With three generations of scholarly achievement, the Zhang family was truly a house of letters. Considering Old Master Zhang's status as a former magistrate and provincial graduate, their deep-rooted connections in Jiangzhou City were formidable.

When Examiner Lu had visited Hu Village to assess local education, the Zhang family hadn't sent anyone to accompany him—partly because of their existing relationship which made such gestures unnecessary, and partly because the Zhangs were so entrenched in Jiangzhou that minor officials often relied on their influence to implement policies.

With Old Master Zhang withdrawn from worldly affairs, Young Master Zhang naturally became the family's public representative.

Additionally, Miss Lin revealed a crucial piece of information: Young Master Zhang had a preference for male companionship.

Zhou Qing knew that such preferences among ancient scholars were even more common than in later eras. Nonetheless, the knowledge made his skin crawl—an instinctive revulsion.

At the banquet, Zhou Qing deliberately took the seat farthest from Young Master Zhang.

Miss Lin, now aware of the situation, felt no such need for distance.

The table soon filled with elegant dishes: freshly caught shad from the river, cherries, bamboo shoots... mostly light vegetarian fare, accompanied by orange wine from Anping Workshop.

Young Master Zhang pointed at a bowl of shrimp ball soup made with bird's nest: "This soup isn't suitable for Scholar Zhou during his mourning period. Have it remade."

Zhou Qing responded, "No need, Young Master Zhang. Although I'm in mourning, I don't abstain from meat."

Mourning customs distinguished between strict and ordinary observance. Strict observance required living by the grave in a hut, abstaining from work and meat to cultivate a reputation for filial piety—valuable for scholarly circles.

Ordinary observance simply prohibited marriage, official appointments, and entertainment venues for twenty-seven months, with no other restrictions.

Young Master Zhang frowned. "As a scholar, don't you aspire to be both loyal and filial?"

Zhou Qing replied, "I regard this body as my parents' legacy. Weak and still growing, I must cherish it to comfort their spirits. Damaging my health for reputation would only distress them."

Impressed, Young Master Zhang said, "So young yet so wise—no wonder you ranked first. No need for formalities; call me Brother Zhang."

Among xiucai, such familiarity was common. Zhou Qing's continued use of "Young Master Zhang" maintained deliberate distance.

Miss Lin kept the conversation flowing. After the meal came desserts: lard dumplings, duck shaomai, goose fat pastries, soft cakes... served with Maojian tea brewed with rainwater. Young Master Zhang ate only a few bamboo shoots, cherries, one cake, and tea—clearly ordering the rest for his guests.

Finally, Young Master Zhang said, "Scholar Zhou, your Five-Spice Pills have worked wonders—the women no longer smell. Leave business matters to Miss Lin; she'll report to my house monthly. As for you, move into my residence tomorrow. We can study together."

Polite throughout, his final words showed no regard for Miss Lin's dignity and presumed to decide for Zhou Qing.

Miss Lin's male disguise was an open secret, yet no one had ever openly challenged it—until now.

As she paled, about to speak, Zhou Qing interjected, "I may be crude, but I understand business enough—or have friends who do. As for residing with you, I'm too accustomed to freedom for such constraints. I must decline."

Young Master Zhang's expression cooled. "You don't understand this world's dangers. I was helping you. Since you refuse, farewell."

After he left, Miss Lin said, "That was rash. I should have refused him. The Zhangs aren't to be crossed lightly."

Zhou Qing asked, "How would you have refused?"

"By conceding more profit. If it came from your share, I'd compensate you. Your future is too bright for such obstacles."

Zhou Qing understood strategic retreats. But as both scholar and martial artist, he knew that while one shouldn't seek trouble, neither should one fear it—lest backbone be lost forever.

Besides, however arrogant, would Young Master Zhang actually have him killed? As this year's top xiucai favored by Examiner Lu, Zhou Qing had status. Accepting Zhang's offer would brand him forever as a dependent.

Jiangzhou produced few provincial graduates—Old Master Zhang being the recent exception. Another graduate would inevitably encroach on Zhang interests—an outcome they'd resist, especially since Zhou Qing's grassroots support from teaching in Hu Village made him a genuine threat.

Zhang's tactics—intimidation through etiquette, attempted control via "filial piety"—were transparent. Offending Zhou Qing carried little risk; Examiner Lu's connection to the late Zhang patriarch would constrain any retaliation.

Families like the Lins invested in talents like Zhou Qing; established gentry like the Zhangs sought to co-opt them preemptively. Better still if he never succeeded, preserving their unique status.

Zhou Qing saw clearly: yielding invited further pressure. Without resistance, compromise was mere weakness.

He told Miss Lin, "Don't worry for me—but I appreciate your kindness."

She replied, "He wouldn't dare harm you, but be cautious. Rumor says an special exam may come next year—you should try. As a provincial graduate..."

Zhou Qing interrupted, "Next year? If so, I'll attempt it. Only success can ensure peace."

They drank to his future success before parting. Concerned, Miss Lin sent him home in a carriage with her maid Chunxiang.

On his return journey, Young Master Zhang's servant suggested teaching Zhou Qing a lesson.

"Unacceptable—he's a scholar," Zhang replied. "But tell that monk from Golden Light Temple who seeks employment: Zhou keeps a large rooster. Have him slaughter it and place the head by Zhou's pillow."

"A fright will soften the boy," the servant agreed.

Back home under scorching sun, Zhou Qing found Chunxiang pressing a cloth bundle into his hands before leaving. Inside was a hand crossbow with bolts—undoubtedly from Miss Lin, despite the risk.

Touched, Zhou Qing stored it carefully. Less convenient than his Finger Projectile technique, it was deadlier when prepared.

The sweltering day made even shade unbearable. Zhou Qing trained through sweat-drenched Five Animal Exercises, bolstered by Black Chicken Pills. After supplementary honey and combat drills, exhaustion brought early sleep.

At midnight, frantic squawking woke him. Someone was in the yard.

Through faint moonlight, he saw a bald figure clutching his rooster Angri. Estimating twenty paces, Zhou Qing fired three iron pellets at the head with Finger Projectile technique before leaping through the window.

Tiger Seizes Heart—his mastered technique—landed brutally. Three more punches to the dazed skull left it pulped. Only then did Zhou Qing check: dead.

His first kill left him momentarily blank—no nausea, just void. Then left shoulder pain flared where fingers had nearly crushed bone.

The dead monk's furious glare didn't faze Zhou Qing. Alive, he'd been dangerous; dead, harmless. Searching the body by flame, he confirmed his suspicion: this was Zhang's doing.
