Chapter 129: Twin Phases in One Body! The Double Pupil Manifests

Li Xian looked at the table full of delicacies and felt a craving for good food. He asked for a bowl of hot, fragrant rice and picked up a piece of roast goose meat. The crispy, charred skin paired with the tender white goose meat. The moment it entered his mouth, the delicious flavor exploded on his taste buds—it was truly exquisite.

This goose was a "Thousand-Step Goose." Fed on refined white rice and made to walk a thousand steps daily to exercise its entire body, only such a goose, when roasted, could be considered a delicacy of the mortal world. A single roast goose cost three taels of silver. When you thought about it, that was equivalent to the value of many lives. However, in the prefecture city, such a dish wouldn't even make it to the table.

"Brother Li, please, speak." Lin Guolong tilted his head and opened his mouth. A woman, dressed in revealing and alluring attire, held a jade pot and poured fine wine into his mouth. The nectar-like wine drew an arc through the air. Lin Guolong took a satisfying gulp, smacked his lips, and then planted a kiss on the woman's face. Drinking fine wine, eating fine food, and enjoying fine beauty all at once—it was truly enviable.

Li Xian put down his chopsticks and said seriously, "County Magistrate Lin, have you heard anything about the rebel army recently?"

"Who!?" Lin Guolong was so startled that he shuddered and fell to the floor. He scrambled up in a panic. "Brother Li, what are you saying? What rebel army? You... you... you must be joking with me." Lin Guolong sat back down, but his previous indulgent mood was gone.

Li Xian said, "To be honest, a few days ago, my wife and I went out and encountered a Yellow Dragon Army. They captured a large city, looting and burning, committing all kinds of atrocities."

"Brother Li, that's terrifying to hear. Can we not talk about it? Come on, drink, let's drink," Lin Guolong forced a smile.

Seeing this, Li Xian felt even more compelled to continue. "On the way back, we also saw traces of the Yellow Dragon Army, but their route doesn't pass through here."

Upon hearing this, Lin Guolong let out a huge sigh of relief and smiled again. "Our Qingning County is blessed by heaven with outstanding talent and geography. These kinds of rebellious traitors won't come here."

"I wouldn't be so sure," Li Xian said.

"Huh?" Lin Guolong tensed up again.

Li Xian calculated in his heart: *If the Yellow Dragon Army really attacks, Qingning County will be plunged into misery. Although this Lin Guolong helped me, he's the type who would run away with his tail between his legs at the first sign of danger. If he could lead the people to defend the city, the Yellow Dragon Army might not be able to break through. I'm deliberately scaring him to force him to defend the county. If the Yellow Dragon Army doesn't come, that would be even better. Offending one man is better than a massacre.*

With this in mind, Li Xian said, "In my opinion, the Yellow Dragon Army's target is precisely Qingning County."

"Ouch..." Lin Guolong's legs went weak. "Brother Li, this... this isn't something you should just say!"

Li Xian was making it all up without any basis. "County Magistrate Lin, even my wife says I'm an honest man. Why would I lie to you? In my view, the Yellow Dragon Army is extremely cunning. They're taking a huge detour right now. In reality, they're planning to encircle us from behind, cutting off Qingning County's supply routes. They'll split their forces into three, surround the city to lure reinforcements, and then... well, you get the idea.总之，青宁县危矣！" (In short, Qingning County is in grave danger!)

Lin Guolong hadn't even managed to snatch any good fortune or destiny. His belly was big, but he lacked real knowledge. Furthermore, news had recently come down from above, ordering vigilance in city defense, as imperial troops were on their way.

Lin Guolong said, "Brother Li, I can't stay for more. I'm going back to my family to take shelter."

"County Magistrate Lin, if you leave, aren't you afraid of the court's blame?"

"Life is more important. Besides, court matters can be handled with money. But these rebels are no joke; they're like stars of slaughter descended to the mortal world," Lin Guolong said.

Li Xian was speechless. He felt the court was so corrupt it deserved to collapse. But he also knew that the Yellow Dragon Army, while flying the banner of rebellion, was actually just looting and raping. Such an army would never win the people's hearts or achieve any great cause. Between the two, it was still better to help Lin Guolong.

Li Xian sneered, "County Magistrate Lin, I'm afraid it's too late."

"Why? Why is it too late?" Lin Guolong asked.

Li Xian said, "The Yellow Dragon Army is surely already lying in ambush on the main roads."

"How do you know?" Lin Guolong asked suspiciously.

Li Xian said, "It's not that I know, but my wife knows. My wife is knowledgeable and can see the bigger picture." He was completely fabricating this. But having his wife as a source made Lin Guolong genuinely fearful. He then thought it over: from ancient times to now, a county magistrate who flees would be considered a sinner for all eternity. Even if his family protected him, he would be despised by all. And from then on, he would never again enjoy such a comfortable life.

Lin Guolong calmed down and asked, "Brother Li, in your opinion, how should we handle this?"

Li Xian smiled. "It's actually extremely simple. The Yellow Dragon Army is just a mob; why fear them? The reason Xiang'e City suffered a great defeat was entirely because its county magistrate was a coward who fled in a panic. Since ancient times, attacking a city is difficult, but defending one is easy. Gather the county's troops, mobilize the people, give them some basic training, guard the city gates tightly, and store up grain. What is there to be afraid of? They'll leave on their own eventually. You, the County Magistrate, will have protected the peace of this region. Isn't a promotion right before your eyes? From then on, you'll rise steadily and climb higher."

Li Xian's persuasive words had their intended effect.

"Good!" Lin Guolong, although lacking in destiny, wasn't completely stupid. Li Xian's words, though possibly deceptive, made perfect sense. The more he thought about it, the more he realized it was true. He even started to worry that the Yellow Dragon Army might not come. "I'll go make the arrangements right away. Brother Li, feel free to enjoy the rest of these things." He strode off with large steps.

Li Xian, of course, didn't waste the opportunity. He opened his stomach wide and devoured all the delicious food.

***

The Madam had four alchemy pavilions, each used for different seasons. It was currently summer. The Summer Alchemy Pavilion was located to the west, a seven-story building. It had failed in alchemy last year, causing a cauldron explosion. The alchemy fire leaked out and burned the pavilion to ashes. Later, they bought wood again, called craftsmen, and redesigned and rebuilt the structure.

There were three alchemy cauldrons in the Summer Alchemy Pavilion: the "Heavenly Cauldron," the "Earthly Cauldron," and the "Human Cauldron." The Heavenly Cauldron was at the top of the pavilion, the Earthly Cauldron in the middle, and the Human Cauldron at the bottom.

The Madam was very particular about starting the cauldrons for alchemy. It required burning charcoal, which was more complex than cooking fine food. Different types of charcoal had to be constantly added to change the nature of the fire. One had to constantly monitor the changes in the cauldron.

At this moment...

In the Human Cauldron on the first floor at the bottom of the pavilion, the charcoal fire was burning vigorously. Because the alchemy room was sealed, the heat accumulated. The Madam wore only a "Glacial Thread Silk Gown." This gown was made of a special material that emitted a faint coolness all year round, as if draped in a layer of ice shavings. It was translucent all over, not hiding her figure at all, and her entire form was on full display.

The Madam had her long hair tied up and was slowly observing the cauldron. With every step she took, she left a wet footprint. It was just too hot here. Alchemy... was no easy task, with all sorts of strange and complex methods. Martial artists couldn't produce fire from their own bodies. Even if some martial arts could turn internal energy into fire, it was difficult to meet the demands of alchemy. Therefore, charcoal was still necessary. And with the fire piling up, it was bound to be extremely hot. The martial artist had to observe the changes in the medicinal properties without a moment's pause, adding charcoal, venting fire, blocking fire, adding medicinal herbs... Most of the time, they had to stay by the cauldron without a break.

Madam Wen exhaled a breath of turbid air and touched the thin silk gown on her body. This item was now useless, so she took it all off. "This alchemy session, so far the medicinal properties have been stable. There's a high probability of success. The heat is accumulating here, so why not open the Earthly Cauldron and refine some leftover miscellaneous pills?"

With this thought, Madam Wen went upstairs along the ladder. She opened the mechanism inside the pavilion, channeling the excess heat from the Human Cauldron to the Earthly Cauldron. She threw in the corresponding medicinal herbs. The reason the alchemy pavilion was built as a multi-story structure was for this purpose. The three cauldrons—heaven, earth, and man—were all on the same straight line. After starting the Human Cauldron, if the fire was strong enough, one could then start the Earthly and Heavenly Cauldrons, saving charcoal and time. Most of the miscellaneous pills in the Idle Alchemy Pavilion were refined this way. Madam Wen Cai almost never expended any extra effort. Whether the pills were successful or not, she just put them all in the Idle Alchemy Pavilion.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]
[Soaring Cloud Hand]
[Proficiency: 102/5000, Great Perfection]
[Description: Five fingers are nimble. Throwing, shooting, and casting are all unstoppable. You have practiced the Soaring Cloud Hand diligently and grasped the 'Exquisite Hand' trait. You have glimpsed the initial scenery of the martial path...]

***

In the Commandery Office, the Madam had been in seclusion for twenty-four days. Li Xian, invited by the County Magistrate, went to observe the county. He saw that Qingning County was being managed quite well. If this trend continued, as long as Lin Guolong didn't falter, they might not actually have to fear the Yellow Dragon Army.

Li Xian bought some fine wine and delicacies in the county and returned to the residence to enjoy them alone. Aside from his diligent martial arts practice, he occasionally indulged in such pleasures. The feeling was truly indescribable.

After eating and drinking his fill, he began to practice [Soaring Cloud Hand] and successfully entered the Great Perfection stage. A scene unfolded before his eyes. The Soaring Cloud Hand, which excelled at throwing and shooting, was actually created by a common street thief. He was an expert at snatching things, stealing chickens and dogs—extremely skilled.

The initial scenery of the martial path ended. Li Xian also calmed his mind, reflecting on his recent gains and losses, looking back on his path, and self-examining to strive for better.

Li Xian started from pulling weeds. He first grasped the [Tenacious] trait, then悟得 (understood) [Treading on Snow] and [Riding the Wind] from running. He cultivated [Hearing in All Directions] and [Four Directions Fist Force] from the Four Directions Fist, and then practiced the [Secret of Lightness] from the Clear Breeze Leg...

Now, he had added another one. The [Exquisite Hand] trait... that is, nimble fingers. It provided a significant boost in weaving clothes, making wood carvings, crafting bows and arrows, studying mortise and tenon joinery, and other aspects.

Every bit of effort had its reward! His many martial arts and abilities were becoming more and more complete.

Li Xian reviewed his own state, and his heart was filled with fulfillment. In less than a year, two basic martial arts and one superior martial art had been cultivated to their peak. The Great Luo Blade and Soaring Cloud Hand had been cultivated to Great Perfection.

[Setting Sun Fading Blood Sword]
[Proficiency: 3098/6000, Small Perfection]

This superior sword technique, though incomplete, was already Li Xian's trump card. When used with all his strength, even the [Emerald Green Palm] was far inferior.

[Innate Cleansing Fetus Diagram]
[Proficiency: 80/81]

He was just one step away from having a pure, translucent fetus body. Li Xian took out the secret box from his chest and opened the hidden latch. There were only a few pieces of essence treasure meat left in the box.

"Even with the secret box, it's hard to preserve this essence treasure meat for too long. Every time I open the box, some of its essence must escape. The later it gets, the more obvious it becomes." Li Xian sighed. As he continued to eat and drink, the effectiveness of the essence treasure in the secret box was visibly declining.

But today... no matter what, he would be able to wash his fetus body until it was translucent.

The final diagram of the Innate Cleansing Fetus Diagram: the Cleansing Intent.

Li Xian supported himself on the ground with his hands, standing upside down. After his body was taut, he supported himself on the ground with one hand and formed a seal with the other. In this manner, he swallowed the essence treasure. The essence of heaven and earth dissipated within his body, and the last wisp of fetal filth drifted out of his body.

The heavens do not disappoint those who strive. Today, at this very moment, he had finally achieved perfection, shedding his muddy fetus body and washing himself clean.

缕缕白烟 (Wisps of white smoke) drifted from Li Xian's palm. The first sign of the Food Essence Realm... the "Palm of Heavenly Mechanism" had appeared.

But at this moment, Li Xian had no time to feel joy about this. Because his eyes were itching, and when he opened them again...

His pupils had split into two. It was the [Double Pupil Phase].

Twin Phases in One Body!!
