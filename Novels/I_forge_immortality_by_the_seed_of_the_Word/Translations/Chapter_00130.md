# Chapter 128: Zhang Nianjing and Zhang Fan

The night was deep, yet the Zhang residence remained brightly lit.  

Especially in one of the inner courtyard halls, the light shone as bright as day. A crowd of servants and attendants had gathered nearby, and even those who had already retired for the night had risen from their beds and hurried over, their eyes brimming with curiosity as they gazed at the illuminated hall.  

Though they could neither hear nor see anything inside, it did nothing to dampen their excitement.  

Just moments ago, many among them had witnessed a young man clad in violet immortal robes descending from the sky and landing in the courtyard. Shortly after, the master and mistress of the house had rushed out to greet him with visible excitement.  

It was clear—this was the legendary immortal of the Zhang family, their young master Zhang Jing, who had returned!  

Inside the hall, Zhang Jing's parents stood before him, their eyes reddened with emotion.  

In his arms, Zhang Jing cradled two young children, his face softened by a gentle smile.  

On his left was his little brother, squirming restlessly and babbling incoherently. On his right, his little sister sat quietly, her tiny head tilted upward as her large, dark eyes studied him intently, as if trying to figure out who this person was.  

"Father, Mother, what are their names? How old are they?" Zhang Jing's warm voice broke the silence in the room.  

"The older one is Zhang Nianjing, and the younger is Zhang Fan. Your mother named them. They're one year and one month old," Zhang's father answered with a smile.  

"Zhang Nianjing... Zhang Fan..."  

Zhang Jing repeated the names silently, a trace of guilt flickering in his eyes. The meaning behind his mother's choice of names was unmistakable, and he understood it all too well.  

Yet—  

A sigh escaped him, so faint it was nearly imperceptible.  

His parents' hopes for him were something he couldn't fulfill. At least, not now.  

His gaze returned to the two children in his arms, their personalities so different, and his expression softened once more.  

At least they would be here to keep his parents company. With them by his parents' side, he could pursue the path of immortality with peace of mind.  

"Jing'er, stay a few more days this time," Zhang's mother pleaded, her eyes filled with hope as she waited for his answer.  

Before Zhang Jing could respond, his father spoke up, "Wife, don't make things difficult for Jing'er. He's an immortal now—cultivation must come first. How could he have time to—"  

His words trailed off, the rest of the sentence lodged in his throat. He turned to Zhang Jing, his own eyes mirroring the same hope.  

Meeting their gazes, Zhang Jing realized with a pang that in just two and a half years, his parents had aged noticeably.  

Memories of their years together flashed through his mind—his father scolding him for misbehavior, his mother shielding him without hesitation.  

His original plan to leave the next day wavered.  

A bright smile spread across his face as he answered firmly, "Alright, I'll stay a few more days."  

Five days passed in the blink of an eye.  

Throughout those days, Zhang's parents wore smiles that rarely faded, and the entire household brimmed with joy.  

Evening approached, the twilight deepening.  

Zhang Jing reclined leisurely in a bamboo chair, holding the quiet Zhang Nianjing in his arms. The two of them gazed at the golden sunset in comfortable silence.  

Suddenly, Zhang Nianjing shifted in his embrace, nestling closer against his chest. Her dark eyes flickered toward him briefly before returning to the sunset.  

After five days of constant companionship, the little girl had grown accustomed to Zhang Jing's presence. For some reason, she particularly loved being held by him—even more than by their mother.  

Before long, a frantic voice shattered the peaceful moment.  

"Oh dear, Young Master, you mustn't run anymore! It's time for dinner!"  

Zhang Jing frowned slightly and cleared his throat.  

At the sound, Zhang Fan—who had been charging around like a wild boar—froze in place. He cast a fearful glance at his elder brother, his expression one of utter helplessness.  

Clearly, the mischievous child had already been disciplined.  

A maid quickly caught up to Zhang Fan and scooped him into her arms before approaching Zhang Jing gratefully.  

"Thank you, Young Master Zhang Jing."  

"It's nothing. Go ahead," Zhang Jing replied with a gentle smile.  

"Then this servant will take her leave."  

As the maid turned away, excitement flashed across her face.  

Over the past few days, everyone had been saying that despite being a lofty immortal, Young Master Zhang Jing carried himself without the slightest arrogance. He was gentle and kind, and his voice was pleasant to listen to.  

She hadn't quite believed it at first—after all, how could an immortal be so approachable?  

But now she knew—Young Master Zhang Jing truly was different!  

Night fell, the world hushed in silence.  

Zhang Jing rose and pushed open the door soundlessly.  

A ripple of spiritual energy pulsed faintly as he ascended into the air, hovering directly above his parents' room. Next to it was the chamber where Zhang Nianjing and Zhang Fan slept.  

His gaze pierced through the tiles and beams, settling upon his slumbering parents.  

With a thought, his divine sense stirred, and the Dao Intent within him unfurled.  

The sparse spiritual energy of heaven and earth within dozens of miles began to gather, coalescing before him into a dense mass.  

In the next instant, his Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud manifested behind him, its five-colored radiance swirling as a pure white glow enveloped the concentrated spiritual energy.  

In moments, most of the energy dissipated, leaving behind only the most refined essence.  

Under Zhang Jing's control, this purified spiritual energy seeped gently into his parents and the two children...  

Elsewhere, sensing the shift in spiritual energy, the scholarly Master Liu of Yong'an Academy and Ji Xianming of the Ji household both snapped their eyes open.  

They turned toward the Zhang residence, their expressions a mix of shock and fear.  

To manipulate spiritual energy across dozens of miles so effortlessly—was this the terrifying power of an inner court disciple from the Dao Academy?  

As time passed, Zhang's parents underwent a remarkable transformation.  

Their slightly aged faces regained their vitality, the silver at their temples receding as if they had shed a decade of years.  

In the neighboring room, the two children showed no visible changes—only that they slept even more soundly.  

Dispersing the remaining spiritual energy, Zhang Jing produced four small, crystalline jade pendants. With a flick of his wrist, they transformed into four streaks of profound light.  

The pendants settled around the necks of his parents and siblings, each imbued with a trace of his Moonlight Dragon Serpent Dao Intent and a sliver of his divine sense.  

Should danger arise, the Dao Intent would activate.  

Nothing below the Foundation Establishment realm would survive its power.  

As for those above—those who hadn't established a superior Dao Foundation—their fate would depend on luck.  

With good fortune, they might endure the Dao Intent's erosion.  

Without it, they would perish instantly.  

"Each pendant can activate the Dao Intent three times. That should be enough to protect them for now."  

With those final words, Zhang Jing vanished into the vast night sky.
