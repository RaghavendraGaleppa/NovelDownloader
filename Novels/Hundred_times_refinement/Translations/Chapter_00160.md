# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 108: Robbing the Robber  

"What are you waiting for? Do you want me to make the first move?" Black clouds churned as an overwhelming spiritual pressure emanated from within, enveloping the three cultivators before it.  

Under the oppressive aura of a Foundation Establishment expert, a bead of sweat rolled down Zhang Tao's forehead. Yet, after exchanging glances with his two companions, they chose not to submit.  

All three were at the peak of the Qi Refining stage. If they fought with everything they had, victory wasn't completely out of reach. They couldn't bear to simply hand over the spirit stones and treasures they had painstakingly accumulated.  

Unlike other cultivators who might act selfishly, these three had grown up together—though not brothers by blood, their bond was even stronger. They would advance and retreat as one.  

*Crackle...*  

Black lightning flickered within the dark clouds. The demonic cultivator's patience had reached its limit. Sensing the impending attack, Zhang Tao gritted his teeth and struck first!  

Channeling his spiritual energy, he summoned a dagger-like spiritual artifact.  

"Seeking death!"  

A cold laugh echoed from the clouds as countless thin bolts of lightning converged into a thick, arm-sized bolt that came crashing down.  

*Thunderfall Technique*—a high-level spell renowned for its devastating power!  

Just as the lightning was about to strike Zhang Tao, a yellow umbrella suddenly flew out from beside him—a defensive artifact wielded by a jovial-looking yet formidable fat cultivator.  

At the same time, Zhang Tao's other companion also made his move. His artifact was a golden brick, which expanded to the size of a house after being infused with spiritual energy.  

Two attacked while one defended—the three peak Qi Refining cultivators coordinated seamlessly.  

The dark clouds roared in fury, streaks of bloody light flickering amidst the swirling black mist.  

*Boom!*  

The demonic cultivator finally summoned his own artifact—a massive sword over three meters long.  

In an instant, the sky was filled with dazzling lights of various colors...  

The weaker cultivators, seeing an opportunity, immediately tried to flee. But before they could take more than a few steps, a bolt of lightning pierced through the first unlucky soul who dared to run. A sinister voice echoed from above:  

"Anyone who tries to escape will be killed without mercy."  

Perhaps intimidated by the ruthless display, or perhaps unwilling to be the next target, the remaining low-level cultivators hesitated—then stopped in their tracks.  

A cold smile played at the corners of Lin Xuan's lips as he glanced upward. The battle had already turned one-sided. Though Zhang Tao and his companions fought in perfect sync, their inferior artifacts and lack of experience quickly put them at a disadvantage. Now, they were barely holding on.  

The demonic cultivator wasn't going for the kill—instead, he was toying with them like a cat with mice. Blood splattered in the air as the three sustained wound after wound, none fatal but enough to terrify the onlookers.  

The message was clear: *Make an example of a few to intimidate the rest.*  

Yet, as Lin Xuan observed the demonic cultivator's arrogant demeanor, a strange glint flashed in his eyes.  

After a moment of contemplation, he summoned his flying sword and joined the fray.  

The demonic cultivator was momentarily surprised that anyone else would dare to intervene. But after a brief glance, he dismissed Lin Xuan—just a brat at the mid-stage of Qi Refining, recklessly bold.  

Though the young man wielded a decent flying sword—a high-grade spiritual artifact—his cultivation was too weak to unleash its full power.  

*Trash.*  

The demonic cultivator paid Lin Xuan no further mind, merely diverting a wisp of black mist from the clouds to entangle with his sword.  

Lin Xuan's expression remained solemn, but deep in his eyes lurked a trace of mockery. *The Scarlet Vine Grass elixir truly is miraculous. Concealing my cultivation like this makes for the perfect ambush.*  

With the demonic cultivator's attention fixed on Zhang Tao and his companions, Lin Xuan's flying sword closed in—less than ten meters away. A murderous aura flashed across his face.  

*Boom!*  

A surge of powerful spiritual energy erupted from his body. With a swift hand seal, he pointed at his artifact and uttered, "*Manifest!*"  

The flying sword blazed with light, twisting and transforming into the shape of a dragon, its claws bared as it lunged forward.  

The demonic cultivator's face paled in shock. There was no time to dodge—he could only hastily erect a defensive barrier around himself. But a mere spiritual shield was no match for Lin Xuan's full-powered strike.  

A sickening *crunch* echoed as the dragon's claws tore through the shield like paper, then clamped down on the demonic cultivator's throat.  

With a flick of his hand, Lin Xuan recalled the dragon—along with the demonic cultivator's storage pouch.  

The sudden turn of events left everyone dumbstruck, their gazes filled with awe as they stared at Lin Xuan.  

This unassuming young man was actually a Foundation Establishment expert!  

He had killed the demonic cultivator in a single move. Yet, none of the Qi Refining cultivators dared to celebrate—they had no idea how Lin Xuan would deal with them.  

Those who had once competed with Lin Xuan for the discarded pills were especially terrified, their backs drenched in cold sweat as they recalled their earlier behavior.  

Lin Xuan swept his gaze over the crowd. Most lowered their heads, not daring to meet his eyes. With a faint shake of his head, he said nothing and flew away on a beam of light.  

It was only several minutes after his departure that the cultivators snapped out of their daze.  

Relief washed over them—they had survived. Without delay, they gathered their belongings and scattered.  

Soon, the once-bustling market was deserted, leaving only a few lifeless bodies behind.  

Lin Xuan hadn't gone far. After circling the area, he quietly returned. With his cultivation, none of the low-level cultivators still present could detect him.  

This treasure-hunting gathering had been quite fruitful for Lin Xuan—he had acquired a hundred discarded Foundation Establishment pills, along with the demonic cultivator's storage pouch.  

In the end, he had chosen to intervene—not out of any heroic impulse, but because he saw an opportunity for profit.  

Lin Xuan wasn't a saint, but neither was he a villain. He wouldn't actively kill and rob others. But if a chance for easy gains presented itself—especially one with minimal risk—he was more than happy to rob the robber.  

Upon inspecting the demonic cultivator's storage pouch, he found it far richer than expected. Initially, he had wondered if the man was simply desperate, but the opposite was true.  

Inside were over a thousand spirit stones of various attributes, a stack of talismans, several pills, and a powerful artifact—the massive sword.  

By Foundation Establishment standards, this man had been quite wealthy.  

Most cultivators of the same level would be content with a hundred or so spirit stones. Of course, Lin Xuan was an exception—his previous sale of Marrow-Cleansing Pills had earned him a considerable fortune.  

But no one would ever complain about having too many spirit stones. As his cultivation progressed, his expenditures would only grow.
