Chapter 91: A Chance Encounter with a Beauty

Lin Xuan focused his gaze on the corpse beside him. After absorbing the yin soul, the Hundred Souls Banner's blood-red skeleton, conjured from it, had increased in potency. The corpse, now weakened, attempted to flee.

Lin Xuan snorted, pointing his finger, and the still-burning Primordial Fire flew towards the corpse, engulfing it. The corpse let out a pained cry as Lin Xuan waved the Hundred Souls Banner, unleashing a more intense attack with the blood-red skeleton.

In no time, the century-old corpse was obliterated, its soul dispersed.

As the black fog dissipated, a jet-black pearl remained suspended in the air.

Lin Xuan pondered for a moment before retrieving a jade bottle from his bosom. He opened the bottle, releasing a yellow light that enveloped the pearl, drawing it inside.

Just as demonic beasts have their demonic cores, powerful corpses like this one would form a corpse pearl within their bodies. The corpse pearl was a highly toxic substance, often used by practitioners of the Ghost Dao to refine spiritual artifacts. Although Lin Xuan didn't practice the Ghost Dao, the corpse pearl was still a valuable treasure, so he stored it away for the time being.

Having eliminated the guardian of the spiritual herbs, Lin Xuan didn't linger. He plucked the Silver Moon Flower and the Firefly Grass, then fled the scene.

Meanwhile, at a certain location within the Xi Yue Gorge, an unassuming cliff face was emitting an astonishing amount of spiritual energy. Several Fire Spirit Sect disciples, clad in their sect's attire, stood nearby, their expressions grave.

"Why hasn't the Sect Master returned yet?" one of them asked.

"Rest assured, with the Sect Master's cultivation, unless faced with a Nascent Soul expert, who could escape their grasp? We have no need to worry," another replied.

"But the treasure is about to emerge. Without the Sect Master present..."

The leading elder pondered, then instructed, "Let's set up an array formation around the area to prevent the spiritual energy from leaking out. We'll also dispatch Foundation Establishment disciples to stand guard, ensuring that no unwanted visitors stumble upon us and ruin everything."

The orders were carried out, and the Fire Spirit Sect's elite disciples dispersed, transforming into streaks of light as they took up their positions.

After harvesting the spiritual herbs, Lin Xuan felt elated, hastening towards the exit of the Xi Yue Gorge. The teleportation array within the gorge was unidirectional, meaning that while entering required teleportation, exiting was unimpeded.

Although the Fire Spirit Sect would likely have disciples guarding the exit, their primary concern was preventing outsiders from entering. Lin Xuan planned to catch them off guard by bursting out from within, creating chaos and making his escape.

As he pondered this plan, Lin Xuan deemed it feasible and put it into action.

About half an hour into his flight, the surrounding spiritual energy suddenly began to fluctuate wildly without warning. Lin Xuan was taken aback, halting his flight. A blue beam of light was hurtling towards him from a distance.

The opponent's cultivation was formidable!

Could it be a Fire Spirit Sect cultivator?

Without time to think, Lin Xuan retrieved his flying sword, preparing for a confrontation...

The flying sword clashed with the opponent's spiritual artifact, and Lin Xuan felt a surge of blood and energy in his chest as they passed each other.

In that instant, Lin Xuan got a clear look at his opponent.

The person was an exquisite, seventeen- or eighteen-year-old maiden, with skin as pale as jade and lips as red as cherry blossoms. She was none other than Qin Yan, a fellow sect member and the Cloud Fairy, who had entered the valley around the same time as Lin Xuan.

Lin Xuan's expression turned worried. He hadn't used the Heavenly Demon Disguise Technique, so his true appearance had been seen by Qin Yan. Moreover, Qin Yan's frantic state indicated that she was fleeing from a great danger. Lin Xuan was concerned that he might be dragged into her troubles.

While other men might feel an urge to protect the beauty, Lin Xuan was more cautious. One shouldn't attempt something beyond their capabilities. Protecting a beauty wasn't wrong, but risking one's life for it was not worth it.

Lin Xuan was confident in his abilities, but Qin Yan was a renowned genius, the closed-door disciple of the Sect Master, Yun He. Some elders even believed that she would effortlessly reach the Foundation Establishment stage, or even the coveted Nascent Soul stage.

Lin Xuan, despite having the aid of alchemical pills, didn't dare claim that his cultivation surpassed hers.

From Qin Yan's speed and panicked expression, it was clear that she was fleeing for her life. The person she was escaping from must be a formidable cultivator, likely someone at the Foundation Establishment stage.

Using the Soul Searching Technique, Lin Xuan had gleaned information from the Fire Spirit Sect disciple's memories, learning about the upheaval within the Xi Yue Gorge and the reason behind the Fire Spirit Sect's actions - a precious treasure was about to emerge.

While others might be tempted by the treasure, Lin Xuan knew his limits. He understood that attempting to snatch the treasure from the hands of over a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators and hundreds of elite disciples would be suicidal. Only a Nascent Soul cultivator would have the audacity to make such a move.

Lin Xuan decided that his priority was to return to the sect, refine the Extreme Grade Marrow Cleansing Pill, and then attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage.

After his encounter with Qin Yan, Lin Xuan couldn't help but feel unlucky. Qin Yan, too, was frustrated. She had just managed to eliminate a shameless Foundation Establishment cultivator using her sect master's taught Palm Thunder technique, only to be confronted by another person.

Upon seeing that the person was Lin Xuan, Qin Yan was taken aback. She had never expected to run into a fellow sect member in such a situation.

Lin Xuan, having obtained the spiritual herbs, flew away, unaware of the events that would soon unfold. Qin Yan, on the other hand, was horrified to see that the person chasing her was none other than the Fire Spirit Sect's Sect Master, Qing Ling. Although Qing Ling wasn't the sect's top expert, his cultivation had reached the late Foundation Establishment stage, making him a formidable opponent for Qin Yan, who was still at the Spiritual Foundation stage.
