# Chapter 138: Five Elements Domain

Mortal Realm, Jiang Prefecture, Qingfu Palace back mountain.

Zhou Qing's body pulsed with five-colored lightning, and the true essence of the Five Elements evolved within it. True Lord Jingyang's cultivation insights detailed the process of opening a Core Formation Domain. However, most Core Formation cultivators typically opened single-attribute domains, with only a select few capable of possessing two or more attributes. According to True Lord Jingyang's insights, the strongest domains were those touching upon innate Grand Daos, such as Yin-Yang or Five Elements.

Having cultivated the Five Viscera Lightning, Zhou Qing's power far surpassed that of a normal peak Foundation Establishment cultivator. With his accumulated power, he was ready to attempt opening a Core Formation Domain. Successfully opening a domain was akin to forming the rudimentary form of a small world within his Dao Furnace, allowing him to better comprehend divine abilities and aid the Dao Furnace in further breakthroughs.

As the Five Elements power circulated within the five-colored lightning, chasing each other, a ball of void energy was born, beginning to merge into Zhou Qing's Dao Furnace. The arduous journey of cultivating the Five Viscera Lightning transformed into the joy of a bountiful harvest at this moment. Everything unfolded naturally, as if preordained.

If it continued to develop and grow stronger, it would move closer to becoming a real world. The Taiyi Primordial Chaos Divine Light began with the Wood Element, as it was the origin of all growth.

People from Hu Village indeed seemed more likely to possess good cultivation aptitudes. After all, Zhou Qing and Yuan Mingyue had supported each other all along the way, so many things went unsaid. With Zhou Qing's care, Yuan Mingyue could be spared from such worries. Zhou Qing, on the other hand, could touch upon innate Grand Daos like the Grand Dao of Yi (Changes) and the Grand Dao of Tai Chi.

The Five Elements Domain primarily had two characteristics: an inner heaven/world (内天地) and a domain (领域). Zhou Qing speculated that the Mortal Realm itself might be a small world evolved from the inner heaven of a powerful cultivator.

Currently, across history, the Dao Court had forty-nine individuals who had cultivated into the innate realm by receiving the Heaven-Connecting Thunder. With the aid of resources, these individuals would most likely be able to break through to the Furnace Realm in the future. Zhou Qing's newly opened inner heaven could also be seen as a seed of a small world.

Moreover, cultivation wasn't just about aptitude. The legendary figures recorded in ancient texts who managed to cultivate beyond the Core Formation stage undoubtedly possessed immense fortuitous encounters. He observed the 'Nourishing Life Master'.

Even if he spoke, the Great Mulberry Tree always implicitly agreed. And someone like Ancestor Tianxuan could be considered a ninety-nine percent score.

Why not 'leech off elders/resources' if one could? It was actually a good thing that the Great Mulberry Tree's vital essence was absorbed by him. He was also setting an example for the Great Mulberry Tree. Yuan Mingyue could also relax and try to break through to Foundation Establishment.

However, for the Great Mulberry Tree, this absorption was beneficial. The stronger its life force, the more likely it was to attract heavenly lightning prematurely. Zhou Qing's guidance was undoubtedly helping Yuan Mingyue break through this barrier; if she feared the unknown, then he would help her make it known.

Of course, True Lord Jingyang's Yin-Yang Treasure Vase could also cultivate the Grand Dao of Life and Death, the Innate Grand Dao of Tai Chu, and the like. Zhou Qing's body was now brimming with vitality, having integrated the vital essence from the Great Mulberry Tree. Through the Wood Element, the Fire Element was elucidated, filling his entire body with abundant Yang qi.

It was roughly a ratio of one to one hundred. However, while Zhou Qing's space could hold living beings, his physical body could not enter it; only his spirit could manifest there, and it was currently empty. What's more, some people received a perfect score simply because there was no other option.

The inner heaven, however, was unique to the paths of Zhou Qing and True Lord Jingyang. True Lord Jingyang's path was the Yin-Yang Two Poles, while Zhou Qing's was the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams. The expansion of the inner heaven's space also led to the expansion of the domain.

Yuan Mingyue's breakthrough process especially required Zhou Qing's protection, for if she were to accidentally trigger the Xuanming Qi, it would undoubtedly be a cataclysm for her. While Immortal Physiques also undergo transformations during cultivation, their aptitude gains are actually less significant than those of ordinary cultivators.

Of course, a one-zhang space in his inner heaven was enough for Zhou Qing to store many important items. It was fortunate that such personal space was rare even among Core Formation cultivators; otherwise, he wouldn't have gained so many benefits from looting corpses before. It was about refining one's body as a furnace and then nurturing the seed of a small world. This was an experience that many Core Formation cultivators lacked, and it was also the most unique aspect of the Dao Furnace system.

Immortal Physiques were generally based on the Five Elements, with the addition of special attributes like lightning and wind. After cultivating continuously for many years, his mind had been under constant tension, becoming somewhat numb; he needed to relax.

What one had that others didn't was truly what mattered!

Every type of Immortal Physique had astonishing cultivation speed, with no bottleneck at the Foundation Establishment stage. With his current knowledge, he was not much inferior to Core Formation cultivators. However, Core Formation did have a bottleneck, but the success rate for those with Immortal Physiques was much higher than for ordinary cultivators.

The Great Mulberry Tree had withered considerably due to assisting Zhou Qing's cultivation. Zhou Qing proactively used his Eye of Dispelling Delusions to observe his disciple's Essence, Qi, and Spirit, pointing out her deficiencies. This meant that his disciple received more accurate and detailed feedback.

The advantages of an Immortal Physique would diminish in higher stages of cultivation, because the more powerful a cultivator became, the more their physical body would also undergo transformation during cultivation. However, while everyone understood this principle, it was actually very difficult to achieve in practice.

But Zhou Qing differed from these people in that he clearly knew where every bit of his effort yielded results, always filled with hope and fighting spirit. This was also Zhou Qing's process of relaxation. Among their group of four from the market, the remaining Qiu family brothers had repeatedly failed their attempts at Foundation Establishment.

One must know that an arrogant dragon regrets, and fullness cannot last long. In the films he watched in his previous life, many tree demons and spirits attracted calamity because they were insatiable, absorbing too much Yang qi. He also could not become the creator within it.

To continue expanding the space within his inner heaven, Zhou Qing could currently only rely on breakthroughs in his cultivation realm. True Lord Jingyang's cultivation insights vaguely mentioned other methods, but without detailed descriptions. This was akin to saying that the gap between a prefect and a grand secretary was not merely due to innate wisdom and acquired diligence.

The essence of the two paths corresponded respectively to innate Grand Daos like the Grand Dao of Yin-Yang and the Grand Dao of Five Elements. As for him? He was probably similar to True Lord Jingyang. Between the man and the tree, there was an unspoken understanding, something ordinary mortals could not comprehend.

Zhou Qing would probably give True Lord Jingyang a perfect score for his aptitude. Zhou Qing said, "No need to flatter your master, Mingyue. You've been stuck at Qi Condensation ninth layer for some years now. You can start trying to break through to Foundation Establishment."

Feng Xiu and Fang Longyuan had also successively broken through to the Furnace Realm. Many people failed to break through to Foundation Establishment because they were too nervous, which could lead to an imbalance in their Essence, Qi, and Spirit during the process.

With the Five Elements Domain successfully opened, Zhou Qing returned to the medicine garden, next to the Great Mulberry Tree, and began to focus on cultivating the Taiyi Primordial Chaos Divine Light. However, Yin-Yang and Five Elements were the most suitable paths for True Lord Jingyang and Zhou Qing, respectively.

"The mechanism of creation must not be without birth, nor without control. Without birth, development has no origin; without control, it becomes arrogant and harmful... The flow of the Five Elements ultimately relies on 'mutual generation, mutual overcoming, mutual restriction, and mutual transformation' as its key."

It was important to know that the higher one's cultivation, the harder it was to increase one's lifespan. Zhou Qing truthfully told her about these drawbacks, but Yuan Mingyue felt that it was quite good this way. Seasons passed.

His lifespan had increased from four hundred years to four hundred thirty years. But for Zhou Qing, it was different. The waters of cultivation were too deep for the Great Mulberry Tree to grasp, but Zhou Qing could grasp them! Moreover, Zhou Qing's progress in Essence, Qi, and Spirit had been particularly clear throughout his journey.

As for normal Qi cultivators, there were over a hundred at Qi Condensation fifth layer and above, with more than twenty being original disciples of Qingfu Palace, meaning they were from Hu Village. Under Zhou Qing's careful guidance, Yuan Mingyue corrected her deficiencies one by one. This was like him doing exams in his previous life; going from failing to passing was easy, but going from passing to ninety points, and from ninety points to a hundred points, the difficulty was incomparable. This point was beyond doubt for Zhou Qing. Anyway, such scoring was meaningless to him; he wanted to climb the highest mountains and see the most beautiful scenery. Even becoming an immortal wouldn't be enough.

To cultivate to that extent, even beyond the Nascent Soul stage, there would still be an immense gap. One would likely need to become an immortal to open a small world as vast as the Mortal Realm. The biggest feature that distinguishes an inner heaven from a storage space is its ability to house living creatures.

For example, a cultivator whose lifespan reached three hundred years before Core Formation might only have a lifespan slightly over five hundred years after Core Formation. However, an ordinary peak Foundation Establishment cultivator with a lifespan of around two hundred and fifty years would also reach about five hundred years after Core Formation. For cultivators, overcoming the fear of the unknown is essential.

Moreover, when different domains erupt simultaneously, they can offset and suppress each other. But as long as Zhou Qing's realm was far stronger than his disciple's, this issue could be resolved. Their failure to establish Foundation was, therefore, reasonable.

After all, their family had produced an Immortal Physique like Hu the Blacksmith. While an Immortal Physique could not directly produce another Immortal Physique, families with Immortal Physique bloodlines were more likely to become cultivation families. "Congratulations, Master! You've made another breakthrough on the path to longevity," Yuan Mingyue said joyfully.

For someone like Zhou Qing, whose accumulation of Essence, Qi, and Spirit was exceptionally profound, his lifespan after Core Formation would far exceed five hundred years. But this was also because his foundation itself far surpassed that of a normal cultivator at the corresponding realm. Information about the Five Elements Domain manifested in Zhou Qing's mind. The drawback of this method was that Yuan Mingyue would become more reliant on Zhou Qing's guidance.

Currently, the inner heaven's function only added the ability to store living flesh and blood creatures, compared to a mere storage bag. Cultivation was a journey against the current; for ordinary cultivators, the most terrifying thing was not knowing whether they were truly progressing.

The inner heaven was the core for cultivators like them, who touched upon the innate Grand Daos. Other Core Formation cultivators in True Lord Jingyang's Dao Domain, even if they opened a domain, could only manifest a 'domain' (领域) but not an 'inner heaven' (内天地). Only at the Nascent Soul stage and above could one open a space unique to oneself.

Zhou Qing focused his attention on the 'Nourishing Life Master':
Five Elements Domain: One-zhang inner heaven (rudimentary form), one hundred-zhang domain.

Within the domain, there was an effect of suppressing opponents and enhancing one's own strength. Evidently, he still needed to gradually develop and expand it. The Great Mulberry Tree should understand his painstaking efforts. By then, whether to choose a self-breakthrough or find a suitable demon to 'plant a demon', there would be ample choice.

The surging vital essence from the Great Mulberry Tree merged into Zhou Qing's body. Such a realm was still completely unimaginable to him. True Lord Jingyang cultivated the Yin-Yang Divine Lightning, and Zhou Qing cultivated the Five Viscera Lightning; both utilized the true Qi of thunder to open and nurture their inner heavens.

Great fullness seems empty, great perfection seems imperfect.

In recent years, even Immortal Aunt Luo and Yu Qing had successfully established Foundation. True Lord Jingyang's cultivation insights indicated that most Core Formation cultivators' domains lacked an inner heaven, possessing only the 'domain' (领域) aspect. This had been verified in the Jingyang Dao Domain. Accepting one's mediocrity in cultivation and facing reality could also lead to good outcomes. Striving was for creating good conditions, and she already had good conditions, so there was no need to deliberately struggle. Let nature take its course!
