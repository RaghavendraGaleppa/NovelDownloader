Chapter 142: Appreciating the Moon, Building a Silk Fortune

Inside the inner courtyard, moonlight poured down like ink, casting layers of sword shadows. Li Xian and Wen Caishuang executed the Twin Swords technique in perfect harmony. Their swordsmanship had reached a divine level; every time their blades touched, strands of cool energy flowed into their bodies, bringing boundless benefits from the forms.

The Yang style was fierce and hard; the Yin style was soft and gentle. When executed together, they complemented each other perfectly, aligning with the natural order of heaven and earth. It was intoxicating, making one lose their way.

Madam Wen’s nature was cool and detached, but she was not without desire. Every time their swords merged, it felt like a deep conversation. Seeing Li Xian’s handsome face, her thoughts inevitably shifted. During her recent closed-door training, she had actually found herself thinking of this synchronization. The moment she emerged, she wanted to move her limbs, which was why she had summoned Li Xian to test his progress.

She was greatly surprised. Li Xian had actually reached the Grand Completion stage.

Madam Wen thought to herself, "The Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword is an incomplete technique and difficult to cultivate. The further one goes, the harder it becomes. Going from entry to Grand Completion in a year is already considered fast. I didn't expect him to exceed my expectations. Is he exceptionally suited to this sword art?"

"Li Xian comes from a poor background. To have made such progress is truly rare."

Her eyes filled with even more appreciation.

Her sword moved like a swimming dragon.

They practiced for half an hour before finally feeling satisfied, breaking into a light sweat.

Madam Wen sheathed her sword, her voice clear and beautiful. "I didn't expect you to have quite the talent for this sword art. You have actually reached Grand Completion."

Li Xian pointed his sword tip down and bowed. "Thanks to Madam's guidance. Whenever I hit a bottleneck, your guidance helps me gain greatly, allowing my sword art to advance by leaps and bounds."

"Keep up the good work, do not slack off. Extend your hand," Madam Wen said.

Li Xian didn't understand but sheathed his sword and extended his right hand. A flash of sword light, and a wound appeared on his palm—not too deep, not too shallow, but very painful.

Madam Wen hid her sword in her sleeve, her willow eyebrows slightly raised. She said indifferently, "I taught you the sword forms, but due to the nature of the art, the swordplay lacks killing intent. I cut your palm to make you feel pain. This is to help you remember that the sword is a tool for killing, so you understand the difference. From now on, every time you seek my guidance, I will draw a line on your palm."

Li Xian knew Madam Wen was eccentric and assumed this was nonsense. "Then in the future, I..."

Madam Wen looked at him. Li Xian无奈ly said, "Even so, if I have anything I don't understand, I will still come to Madam for guidance."

Madam Wen nodded, finally satisfied. She thought, "I need to leave you covered in scars so you will remember this deeply and be of use to me."

She did not know that Li Xian already knew the secret of the "Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword," and he always referred to their synchronization as "guidance."

Having poured out her sword intent, Madam Wen said, "Wait here for me," and turned to walk into the residence.

Autumn Moon had already prepared hot water, sprinkled with flower petals that emitted a fresh fragrance. Madam Wen undressed, revealing some strange marks on her body. She tapped the water surface with her toes, and finding the temperature suitable, submerged her entire body into the pool.

"Madam, this bath contains a hundred herbs; their efficacy is just right," Autumn Moon said, holding the discarded clothes to the side.

As a personal maid, whenever Madam Wen finished a medicinal bath, she could use the leftover soup.

"Good," Madam Wen nodded, closing her eyes slightly to relax.

"Madam, Li Xian is still waiting in the courtyard. Is he...?" Autumn Moon asked.

Madam Wen said, "It's fine, let him wait." She gently stirred the water with her hand, the medicinal liquid soaking her skin. The steam rose, making her look like a fairy in the water.

Li Xian waited bitterly in the courtyard for over an hour. The night grew deeper, and he looked around, admiring the flowers, fish, and trees.

Madam Wen had extremely high taste. Every flower, grass, tree, and stone in the courtyard was arranged with great care.

The wound on his palm was just right; it hurt but didn't伤筋动骨. Madam Wen's intention was becoming clearer to Li Xian. He remained清醒 that in the future, if he had the ability, establishing his own门户 would be the best plan.

"Madam must be bathing. I wonder why she wants me to wait," Li Xian thought. Suddenly, he saw the bright moon in the sky, like a round plate. It was the fifteenth of the lunar month, a good time to appreciate the moon.

He saw a maid walking over. By the lake shore, she placed a red wood tea table, smooth as jade. There were jade-green fruit plates and exquisite wine pots...

In no time, the spot for moon viewing was fully arranged.

Madam Wen came out of the bath just in time. Wearing a silk garment that was casual and alluring, with water droplets at the tips of her hair, she sat at the table.

The scenery here was breathtaking.

Goldfish played in the lake, and birds nested in the trees. Drinking and making merry had a unique charm.

"Madam, do you have any other instructions?" Li Xian asked主动ly, having waited a long time as the night deepened.

Madam Wen pointed to the seat beside her. "Sit."

After Li Xian sat down, she said, "The prefectural city sent some fresh 'Water Lychees' today. You probably haven't tasted them. Try two."

Li Xian had already seen the fruit plate on the table. The fruits looked like lychees but were redder, and upon closer inspection, they had a pink luster.

He peeled the skin. The flesh was round, the aroma overflowing, and juice flowed out. Putting it in his mouth, it felt like holding a sweet jade; the taste was indescribably delicious.

"Wasting such a treasure," Madam Wen picked up one with two fingers and said, "Do you know how much silver one of these costs?"

Li Xian naturally didn't know and guessed, "Five hundred copper coins?" Madam Wen smiled and shook her head. "You really need to broaden your horizons."

"Fifteen taels of silver. It's even more expensive than Dragon's Roar Charcoal."

"Does it have some special effect?" Li Xian was secretly astonished.

Madam Wen shook her head. "Rare things are precious. The Water Lychee is delicious, but in terms of value, it isn't worth fifteen taels of silver no matter how you look at it."

"The reason is that this fruit rots three days after being picked from the branch. No matter what method is used, it cannot be preserved. Using ice to cool it, sealing it in a sky-preserving box—nothing works."

"That is why it is incredibly expensive. Precisely because it is expensive, people flock to it, considering the consumption of Water Lychees a matter of prestige."

Li Xian said, "I see. Thank you for your kindness, Madam. If not for you, I'm afraid I wouldn't have tasted such a delicacy in my lifetime."

He thought to himself, "People use high prices to show status, but I don't care for it. Although the Water Lychee is delicious, it's not worth the price."

Madam Wen smiled. "I didn't spend a penny on this plate of Water Lychees. They were all gifts. Tonight, you accompany me in appreciating the moon, and you can eat as many of these fruits as you like."

She wore a hazy gauze dress, graceful and full of charm under the moonlight.

[Skill: Cloud-Touching Eight Styles]
[Proficiency: 258/500 Entry Level]

Madam Wen signaled with her eyes. Understanding, Li Xian sat behind Madam Wen and massaged her shoulders to relieve her fatigue. Madam Wen had gradually grown accustomed to this and asked casually, "How is the situation in the county?"

Li Xian said, "Nothing much yet. It's just that since I became the Martial Commander, the martial arts schools in the county are quite unconvinced."

Madam Wen said indifferently, "You need to handle this matter yourself."

Li Xian naturally knew that the prestigious Sword-Breaking Madam would never lower herself to help him.

"Of course," Li Xian said. "It's just, Madam, I have two clothing shops in the city, but I lack fabric. I was thinking..."

"You want to buy some silk fabric from me?" Madam Wen was extremely sharp.

"Yes," Li Xian said.

Madam Wen pondered for a moment. "My mulberry garden does produce some inferior goods every month. It wouldn't hurt to sell them to you at a cheap price."

Madam Wen did business with the prefectural city. The scraps she left behind were enough to support the clothing shops in the county.

Autumn Moon watched from the side and felt a great sense of crisis. Madam Wen now had physical contact with Li Xian and didn't resist at all. If this continued, and if Madam Wen asked Li Xian to help her cultivate that martial art, where would she stand?

The next day.

Li Xian came out of the inner courtyard. At some point, entering the inner courtyard had meant staying the whole night.

"Commander Li, it's about time for the guards' competition in our manor."

Ding Hu got up early. Because of the guards' competition, it had been postponed for a long time. The specific situation required Li Xian's instructions. So he went to the Commander's courtyard to look for Li Xian. Not finding him, he guessed Li Xian was in the inner courtyard, so he waited under a willow tree outside.

He indeed saw Li Xian. He couldn't help but think, "Commander and Madam, wouldn't it be..." Even with suspicions, he dared not speak of it.

Li Xian said, "The guards' competition... Alright! Why wait for a specific day? Let's do it today."

He handed the details of the matter to Ding Hu to handle.

It wasn't long before the guards gathered in the manor's main courtyard. Each displayed their skills, striving for advancement.

Li Xian personally attended to maintain order. After the competition, some were promoted, some were demoted. There wasn't much to say about it.

Li Xian focused on inspecting Ding Hu.

This man had been a guard for eight years. He was originally an apprentice at an external martial arts school and was recruited into the manor by Commander Pang.

His character was hard to judge.

But he was well-versed in the manor's rules and had prestige among the guards. He was enough to hold his ground.

Li Xian decided to promote him to the rank of "First Head." When Li Xian was away from the manor, Ding Hu would act as commander, managing the guards. He had certain powers regarding the guards' competition and patrol arrangements.

Ding Hu was overjoyed and knelt down excitedly.

折腾了半日。正午时分，李仙吃饱喝足，在食斋楼中偷拿了七张干饼。

偷夫人干粮，养自己的兵。

纵马回到青宁县。

武尉堂。

张侯、王五等人在勤习四方拳。王五天资较好，三日内便可练出内炁。

“弟兄们，吃饭了。”

李仙笑着招呼。将装有干饼的布袋丢在石桌上。

众人扯开布袋，凉水就着干粮，大口吃干净。

“我不在时，可有异样？”李仙问道。

“禀武尉大人，暂无异样。”张侯吃得急，干饼卡在喉管，就着凉水，再猛力捶打胸口，才勉强咽下。

“那就好。”李仙笑道：“慢点吃吧。”

忽听“咚隆”一声传出，堂外的擂鼓被敲响。

李仙眉头一皱，大步出门，见是一位身穿帮派服饰的人物敲鼓。

“果真来了，这县中的三馆两派，就等着我呢。”李仙心中了然，问道：“你是何人，为何敲鼓。”

那人嬉笑道：“回禀大人，我是蛇走派一弟子，您可算来啦，咱们等你好久了。”

李仙问道：“是何事？”

那人嬉笑，站没站像，道：“那可是大事，大大的大事。事情危急，还请大人，随我来罢。”

“这江湖上的纠纷，非得大人您才能解决，谁来都不好使。毕竟咱们县里，就您这一尊大武尉。”

此话藏幸灾乐祸，阴阳怪气。

那人又道：“当然，您若是不敢，也自可别来，咱们都理解。”

李仙上前一步，按住那人肩膀：“闲话少说，还不快快带我过去。”微微用力，那人肩膀“咔嚓”一声，骨头微裂，手臂酸麻。

脸上嬉笑尽无，转而变为惧怕。疼得眼泪直流。

“大…大人，请…请您松手，我…我这就带您过去。”那人惶恐道。

李仙松手。那人如蒙大赫，踉踉跄跄离去，扯开肩膀衣物，见一道黑红手印扎眼。

“走快点。”李仙淡淡道。

“是，是，是，大人，您请。”那人点头哈腰。先前听帮内传闻，这武尉官多有不堪。今日一见，那传闻是真是假，仍不敢确定。

但无论如何，这武尉官非他能惹。真切吃了教训，才摆清楚身份。

“这是怎回事？”

武尉堂拐过一弯，便是“西风街”。此街虽不繁茂，但行人商户自不少。今日却毫无人迹，商铺关门，一片狼藉。

地上还有打砸痕迹。

“大人，这…这和那江湖纠纷有关，械斗被波及。我…我就是为此事，来求您出手帮忙的。”

那蛇走帮弟子，擦了把冷汗，不敢与李仙对视。

After much折腾, at noon, Li Xian ate and drank his fill, then secretly took seven dry pancakes from the Food Zhai Building.

Stealing the Madam's rations to feed his own soldiers.

He rode a horse back to Qingning County.

In the Martial Commander Hall.

Zhang Hou, Wang Wu, and others were diligently practicing the Four Directions Fist. Wang Wu had better talent and could cultivate Inner Qi within three days.

"Brothers, time to eat."

Li Xian called out with a smile, tossing the cloth bag containing the dry pancakes onto the stone table.

The men tore open the bag, ate the dry rations with cold water, and gulped them down.

"Was there anything unusual while I was away?" Li Xian asked.

"Reporting to the Martial Commander, there are no abnormalities for now," Zhang Hou said. He ate too quickly, got a pancake stuck in his throat, drank some cold water, and pounded his chest hard before barely swallowing it.

"That's good," Li Xian smiled. "Eat slowly."

Suddenly, a "thump" was heard. The drum outside the hall was beaten.

Li Xian frowned and strode out. He saw a man wearing gang attire beating the drum.

"They really came. The three schools and two sects in this county have been waiting for me," Li Xian understood immediately. He asked, "Who are you? Why are you beating the drum?"

The man grinned and said, "Reporting to the大人, I am a disciple of the Snake Walk Sect. You've finally arrived. We've been waiting for you for a long time."

Li Xian asked, "What is the matter?"

The man grinned, standing sloppily. "It's a big matter, a huge matter. The situation is critical. Please,大人, come with me."

"The disputes in the Jianghu require you,大人, to resolve. No one else will do. After all, in our county, you are the only great Martial Commander."

These words were filled with schadenfreude and sarcasm.

The man added, "Of course, if you dare not come, you don't have to. We all understand."

Li Xian stepped forward and grabbed the man's shoulder. "Enough nonsense. Hurry up and lead the way." He applied a little force, and a "crack" was heard from the man's shoulder. The bone was slightly cracked, and his arm went numb with soreness.

The grin vanished from the man's face, replaced by fear. Tears of pain streamed down.

"Big... Big大人, please... please let go. I... I'll lead the way right now," the man said in panic.

Li Xian let go. The man looked as if he had been granted a great favor, stumbling away. He tore open his clothes and saw a dark red handprint on his shoulder, glaringly obvious.

"Walk faster," Li Xian said calmly.

"Yes, yes, yes,大人, please," the man said, bowing and scraping. He had heard rumors within the gang that this Martial Commander was quite incompetent. Seeing him today, he wasn't sure if the rumors were true or false.

But no matter what, this Martial Commander was not someone he could provoke. Having truly learned a lesson, he finally understood his place.

"What is going on?"

Turning a corner from the Martial Commander Hall was "West Wind Street." Although this street wasn't bustling, there were usually plenty of pedestrians and merchants. Today, however, there was no sign of life. The shops were closed, and the place was in a mess.

There were signs of smashing and destruction on the ground.

"大人, this... this is related to the Jianghu dispute. We were caught in the crossfire of a gang fight. I... I came to ask for your help because of this matter."

The disciple of the Snake Walk Sect wiped his cold sweat, daring not to meet Li Xian's gaze.
