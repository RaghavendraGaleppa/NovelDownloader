# Chapter 316: Rewarding the Army and Holding a Military Council

“Li Shaoxia, where did you get so many military supplies?”

Qu Sheng could no longer hold back his curiosity.

“Bought them.”

Li墨 maintained the passage to his Minor World while looking somewhat distracted.

Actually, he wasn't distracted.

The system notifications in his ears were too numerous, ringing every second, and not just one at a time. They were giving him a splitting headache.

He couldn't even count them, let alone look at them all.

“B-bought them?”

Commander Qu almost choked on his own saliva.

“Rest assured, Commander, I haven't done anything illegal. These things were all obtained through legitimate means.”

Li墨 paused, then added, “Oh, right. Besides the military supplies, there are a few other things.”

“Some items require careful handling. Be gentle.”

As he spoke—

*Thud!*

The packed earthen ground was covered in dust as a number of complexly inscribed ballistae appeared. Under the lamplight, their cold gleam was terrifying to behold.

Then came crates radiating an explosive aura. It was unclear what was inside.

But Qu Sheng, at the Inner Scene Realm, felt a sharp sense of danger the moment he saw them.

Whatever was inside certainly wasn't a benevolent object.

There were also Thunder Beast hide drums standing three meters tall... and阵 stones carved with formation patterns that exuded the aura of mountains...

“...”

Qu Sheng stared at this pile of strictly prohibited killing instruments and fell into deep thought.

Legitimate means?

What legitimate means could get one their hands on these weapons of war?

Even the ones in the Qingmu Camp weren't this refined!

“Brother Li, what is this?” Huang Donglai’s eyes lit up. He loved these highly destructive ‘external objects’ the most.

“That’s a Rongyuan military crossbow. Even Inner Scene experts wouldn't dare take it head-on. It's even more powerful if fueled by Spirit Crystals, but it breaks after only a few uses.”

“And this?”

“Thunderfire Pellets. Wait! Be careful! These things are prone to exploding. If one goes off, they all go off. It could blow the entire camp to the heavens.”

“*Gasp*... Can I borrow one to study?”

“Just be careful.”

“Hey, you know me, Brother Li.”

Li墨 carefully took out pile after pile of weaponry.

Watching the warehouse gradually fill with grain and strange, heavy military artifacts, Qu Sheng was first shocked, then excited and overjoyed, and finally, he became numb.

There was just too much.

So much that the waves of shock had become a constant tide.

Moreover, Li Shaoxia said this wasn't even everything, just the first batch.

He remained silent for a long time, no longer asking Li墨 where these things came from, nor how he had delivered them.

“Li Shaoxia, why are you doing this?”

Qu Sheng couldn't quite understand this young man.

The value of everything here was immeasurable.

It was enough to found a sect or a clan, enough to squander for a lifetime.

Li墨 could have left. He could have taken his Fairy Han and drifted away without a trace.

Instead, he had returned, taking a huge risk to bring back military supplies and those weapons that defied the heavens.

Qu Sheng had many questions, but he asked none of them.

Not long after, the camp was brightly lit.

Personal guards rode swiftly, spreading the order everywhere:

“By the Commander's order, Li Shaoxia has generously donated to reward the entire army!”

Before the battle began, feeding the soldiers to the full was the best way to boost morale.

Tents were lifted one by one. The soldiers stopped what they were doing, looking with surprise and joy toward the source of the order.

Reward the entire army?

The soldiers hadn't heard those words in a very long time. For a long period in the camp, even the bereavement payments were meager. It was only due to excellent leadership that there had been no mutiny or internal strife.

Many had privately discussed that if things continued this way, the Qingmu Camp wouldn't even be able to maintain its structure.

The name shouted by the guards was like a lamp seen in the pitch-black darkness.

“Thank you, Li Shaoxia!”

The cheers shook the sky.

Meanwhile, the three of them headed for the central command tent.

Listening to the rising and falling cheers, Qu Sheng cupped his fists in a deep bow.

“This bow is on behalf of the soldiers.”

---

“The soldiers of the Qingmu Camp haven't had a full salary in a long time.”

Li墨 didn't modestly refuse.

After a moment of silence, he smiled. “Now, Commander Qu, how much more confident are you in our chances of victory?”

“Somehow, seeing you, I feel... it's a hundred percent!”

As they spoke, the three of them arrived at the central command tent.

The issue of grain and fodder was temporarily resolved. The generals in the tent had been waiting for a long time, discussing the situation based on various military reports.

“We have no worries for now. As long as we hold Qingmu City and wait for the Prince to send reinforcements, we'll be fine.”

“The southern tribes don't outnumber us by much, but they have all sorts of disaster beasts aiding them. Can we hold?”

The defending side, even against several times the enemy, has a huge advantage.

But this time, the enemy's human conscripts were secondary. The hardest to deal with were the disaster beasts revered as 'Witch Spirits.'

Qingmu City had repelled small-scale disaster beast tides many times before.

But this time, the disaster beasts were acting like an army, with clear objectives and strong discipline. It was completely different from before.

“This doesn't seem like a disaster beast tide anymore.”

Listening to the generals' discussion, Li墨 voiced his suspicion. “It feels more like we're fighting a war against another nation.”

“That's not entirely wrong.”

Qu Sheng sat at the head of the table, his tone heavy. “Many of the tribes heading for Qingmu City are remnants of the Great Shang Dynasty. There are also experts from the Demon Summoning Sect participating. And there's a man named Han Zhen. His realm is unknown, but his methods are especially bizarre. The disaster beasts seem to follow his lead.”

“Han Zhen...”

The familiar name was mentioned again. Li墨 looked at everyone present. “He was a Seventh Realm Profound Master. He only survived through secret arts.”

“Seventh Realm?!”

The atmosphere in the tent instantly fell silent. The generals’ faces turned grave. Some opened their mouths but didn't know what to say.

A Seventh Realm expert was practically at the peak of the famous powerhouses in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Even the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands Power Rankings no longer recorded their rankings, because they all now wield a 'Dao.'

A Dao has no concept of strong or weak. Every Profound Master has unfathomable abilities that are impossible to compare.

Sensing the oppressive atmosphere, Li墨 timely smiled. “However, this man was a defeated opponent of me and Ying Bing.”

He was actually feeling uncertain inside.

Because Han Zhen couldn't be judged by the standards of their generation. He wasn't their peer to begin with, but an old monster.

What if Han Zhen found a way to pay a great price and temporarily return to his peak?

No one could say for sure.

But Li墨 didn't want to dampen everyone's morale. One must have the confidence to win before there is a chance of victory.

“Li Shaoxia is right. If he and Fairy Han defeated Han Zhen once, they can do it again!”

“He's just a corpse in a coffin, reanimated!”

“He's not the only one. Helian Wu of the Duoyue Tribe is also a tough opponent.”

The generals encouraged each other and resumed their discussion.

Li墨, on the other hand, silently assessed himself in his heart.

He could now draw upon the power of a military formation. If he combined that with World Power in that state, a single Heaven Overturning Hammer might be too much for even an Outer Scene expert to handle.

He also had the Somersault Cloud, Vajra Body, and Seventy-Two Transformations.

And moreover...

There was one thing he hadn't done yet.

The Monkey King's Path of Enlightenment diagram could already be pushed further.

By then, his strength would increase even more.

Furthermore, as everyone knew...

The gentlemanly Li Mo was a genius.

He might not have memorized military strategy books, but he had a deep understanding of the King of Brawling's Secrets, which contained many ways to defeat a stronger enemy with a weaker force.

War is just a brawl between many people. That makes perfect sense.

He now had many brilliant ideas in his mind, though he didn't know if they would actually work.

“We must win.”

Li墨 clenched his fist.

For other reasons, he had never forgotten why this war had arrived ahead of schedule.

The Jade Phoenix God.

And the Jade Phoenix God had already merged with the Ice Cube.

PS: Even this little hack writer knows the readers want more content with Bing [Ice], but some plotlines have to be pushed forward.

This little hack writer will try his best to keep the plot interesting.

As everyone knows, I was a genius from a young age!

Also, readers don't need to worry that Little Li will become too gloomy. The story will still primarily be lighthearted, just with a touch of gloominess. This little hack writer did it on purpose, hehe.
