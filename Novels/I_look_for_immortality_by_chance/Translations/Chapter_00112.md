# Chapter 112: Entering the Secret Realm, Ambush!

"He actually won!"

"This man's spiritual sense and techniques are formidable. That Su family disciple couldn't even last three rounds against him!"

"Hidden talents among the common folk—who dares say we common disciples are inferior?!"

Gu Yuan's decisive victory reinvigorated the common disciples, who couldn't help but praise him, their eyes alight with renewed hope. Some even stopped watching the remaining qi battles, turning their thoughtful gazes toward Gu Yuan.

The common disciples had their own reasons for eagerly hoping one of their own would secure a spot. Unlike previous years, the winners of this year's Flowing Cloud Banquet would also enter the Ancient Mountain Secret Realm to compete for the remaining twenty strands of spiritual qi. If nothing unexpected happened, these twenty strands could nurture at least a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators—a far greater opportunity than before.

However, aristocratic disciples, bound by family ties, would naturally prioritize their own kin when distributing the qi. Unless their clans had no promising candidates, these resources would never reach outsiders. Similarly, disciples from the seven major sects all had junior disciples they favored—why would they share with outsiders when they could benefit their own factions?

Only common disciples, unburdened by such obligations, might distribute their gains among fellow commoners, forming alliances for mutual benefit. Gu Yuan's victory wasn't just for himself—it represented an additional opportunity for the common disciples. Even if he only secured one extra strand of qi in the secret realm, it meant one more commoner had a chance at Foundation Establishment. No wonder their spirits soared.

Meanwhile, aristocratic and sect disciples also turned their attention to Gu Yuan, their expressions uneasy. A commoner's victory was surprising enough, but such an overwhelming triumph was downright unsettling.

"Junior Sister Bian, who is this Gu Yuan? Is he someone your Bian family groomed? Or is one of your noble daughters betrothed to him?" a young man from the Feng family whispered to Bian Chuyao.

"Brother Gu's talent is extraordinary—even our Bian family might not have been able to nurture such a genius. I did try to recruit him, but... an ordinary noble daughter might not be worthy of him..." Bian Chuyao sighed, not hiding her thoughts from the Feng disciple given their families' close ties.

She had indeed attempted to win Gu Yuan over, but this cunning man had proven difficult. If not for the generous gifts she'd brought, he might not have even agreed to cooperate with her in the secret realm. An ordinary noble daughter, lacking comparable talent, wouldn't even catch his eye. The Bian family had many noble daughters, but when she considered who might truly match Gu Yuan, only one name came to mind...

Shaking her head to dispel the thought, Bian Chuyao's words visibly shocked the Feng disciple. If Gu Yuan hadn't risen through the Bian family's backing, where had his skills come from? Could it be the arrangements of Sword Fox Sage? Many eyes turned toward Jade Pot Peak's empty seating area—the peak had remained unoccupied since the death of Sword Fox Sage's beloved disciple.

The competition continued, with the final top-tier spot ultimately claimed by Feng Anping of the Feng family, who possessed a unique secret art that greatly enhanced the Five Elements True Wheel Diagram. Thus, the seven top-tier spots were finalized: Zhou Jun, Bian Chuyao, Ji Mobai of Heavenly Pillar Peak, Zhuang Kangsheng of Formless Peak, Mo Nanlian of Moon Reflection Peak, Gu Yuan, and Feng Anping.

Three from aristocratic families, three from the seven sects, and one commoner. Even two prominent aristocratic families had failed to secure spots, while three sects also came up empty—an outcome the aristocrats and sects could not tolerate. The competition for the remaining three spots grew even fiercer, with nearly every remaining cultivator taking the stage in desperate bids.

In the end, Xiao Yi of Azure Flame Peak fought through seven opponents to claim one spot, while the young woman Si Rujing of Ruyi Peak triumphed over eight challengers. Even Su Huazheng, previously defeated by Gu Yuan, barely managed to secure the last spot after eight grueling battles.

With all ten spots decided, the presiding elder waved his sleeve, causing the jade screen behind the hall to ripple like water before revealing the mist-shrouded expanse of the secret realm.

Ji Mobai of Heavenly Pillar Peak entered first, alone. Other sect disciples exchanged glances, seemingly reaching silent agreements before entering together. The aristocratic disciples also conferred in hushed tones, with Su Huazheng glaring venomously at Gu Yuan—until Bian Chuyao shook her head and stood beside Gu Yuan instead. Feng Anping hesitated but ultimately joined them, leaving Su Huazheng fuming as he stormed into the secret realm alone.

The moment Gu Yuan stepped through, the world spun violently, as if he'd traversed thousands of miles in an instant, leaving him momentarily disoriented. But the sensation faded as quickly as it came.

The roar of crashing water filled his ears. Before him stretched an enormous waterfall cascading from the sky as if pouring through a hole in the heavens, feeding an endless azure river below. Amid the mist, a strand of white qi darted like a dragon through the torrents, absorbing the essence of heaven and earth—the Tideborn Qi of the Azure Sea, the very spiritual energy needed to forge the Cangming Dao Foundation.

Yet Gu Yuan didn't immediately move to collect it. Instead, he turned to Bian Chuyao. "I heard aristocratic disciples always stick together. Why didn't you join Su Huazheng when he invited you?"

"Do you take me for a fool?" Bian Chuyao rolled her eyes. "I invited you to explore the secret realm together—did you think I'd abandon you after you accepted my gifts?"

Gu Yuan then turned to Feng Anping. "And why did you join us?"

"I trust Junior Sister Bian's judgment," Feng Anping replied calmly, though his curiosity about Gu Yuan was evident. He wanted to see what made this man worthy of Bian Chuyao's loyalty.

But Gu Yuan only shook his head, gazing at the distant sky. "A pity... you've both misjudged me. I'm no prized treasure."

Before Bian Chuyao and Feng Anping could react, six streaks of light descended, surrounding them completely.
