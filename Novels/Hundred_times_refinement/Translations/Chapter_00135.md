Chapter 85: The Blood Demon Beast and the Silver Arrow Fish

Lin Xuan gazed at the black cliff in front of him, taking a deep breath. From the memories of the Fire Spirit Sect disciple, he learned that this cliff was extremely dangerous. However, the exact nature of the danger, whether it was a demonic beast or something else, was unclear. The disciple had only heard it from his seniors and didn't know the specifics.

Lin Xuan felt a bit annoyed, observing the cliff silently. On the surface, it seemed normal, except for the black color of the stones, which resembled ink. However, he wouldn't dismiss the warning, as the places where celestial spiritual grasses grew were often guarded by demonic beasts.

The path of cultivation was fraught with difficulties, and besides one's own cultivation, a cultivator needed to be brave and cautious. Countless cultivators had fallen due to carelessness over the years, and Lin Xuan didn't want to become one of them.

The cliff seemed normal, and below it lay a winding path overgrown with weeds. Lin Xuan's face showed a hint of seriousness, and with a thought, a layer of light green halo enveloped his body, activating his spiritual energy shield. This was not the time to conserve his energy.

Then, he took out two talismans from his pocket, holding one in each hand, ready to face any sudden danger.

With these preparations, Lin Xuan cautiously began to walk along the path, moving slowly and expanding his divine sense as far as possible to detect any danger early.

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan stopped, silent and still. Ahead of him, a broad river suddenly appeared, its waters turbulent and boiling, as if they were on fire. Above the river, a thick, blood-red mist hung in the air.

Several birds flew by, only to crash into the blood-red mist, their cries echoing before their bones fell from the sky, their flesh having been drained.

"Blood Demon Beast!" Lin Xuan's mind flashed with the name. He had read about this beast in the "Cultivation Anecdotes Record": a top-grade demonic beast of the first level, it fed on the flesh and blood of living creatures and could transform its body into mist, making it one of the most troublesome first-level demonic beasts.

If possible, Lin Xuan didn't want to fight it. However, what he saw next made his expression darken further.

A small fish leaped out of the water. Though it was far away, Lin Xuan's divine sense allowed him to see clearly that it was a silver-colored fish, about the length of a finger. At first glance, it seemed ordinary, but upon closer inspection, its eyes protruded, shining with a blood-red light, and its teeth were particularly sharp.

"Silver Arrow Fish!" Lin Xuan gasped. Though its grade was low, a first-level lower-grade demonic beast, they were known for gathering in large groups, often numbering in the tens of thousands, and were fierce and fearless. Even a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage would have to flee upon encountering them.

Standing by the river, Lin Xuan hesitated, unsure of what to do. The path ahead was blocked, and whether he tried to cross the river or fly over it, he would face strong enemies.

Fortunately, Silver Arrow Fish couldn't come ashore, and the Blood Demon Beast was known for being lazy. As long as he didn't move forward, he didn't have to worry about being attacked.

After a moment's hesitation, Lin Xuan's expression changed as he sensed several auras rapidly approaching. Were they disciples from the Fire Spirit Sect?

It wasn't too late to retreat, but Lin Xuan was determined not to give up on his chance at Foundation Establishment. His eyes flashed with a resolute light, and he decided to try a different approach.

From his pocket, he took out a small black banner, only the size of a palm. As soon as it appeared, it emitted a thick, gloomy aura filled with resentment, making one's skin crawl.

"The Hundred Souls Banner!" This was a war trophy Lin Xuan had obtained from Ye Tian, a soul-related demonic tool. Though it wasn't fully refined, it possessed considerable power.

Lin Xuan circulated his spiritual energy, waving the Hundred Souls Banner gently. Instantly, the malevolent energy surged, and ghostly cries echoed around him. Countless black ghostly mists poured out from the banner, enveloping Lin Xuan.

Within the ghostly mist, Lin Xuan's expression was solemn. He muttered incantations, following the demonic cultivation method he had learned, and continued to infuse his spiritual energy into the Hundred Souls Banner.

The ghostly cries became more mournful, and several disheveled, fierce ghosts emerged, their fingers claw-like, their eyes blood-red, and they wailed incessantly.

These were the souls sealed within the Hundred Souls Banner. Lin Xuan directed them to surround him and then carefully controlled the spiritual tool, flying into the blood-red mist above the river.

Coincidentally, an eagle flew by, and the blood mist swirled, condensing into countless red threads that pierced the eagle's body. Soon, its flesh was drained, leaving only bones to fall from the sky. However, the blood mist showed no reaction to Lin Xuan.

It seemed he had gambled correctly. According to the "Cultivation Anecdotes Record," the Blood Demon Beast, though a top-grade demonic beast of the first level, had a weakness: it had no eyes, and its sense of smell was extremely keen. Once it detected prey entering its mist, it would attack immediately.

However, it only fed on living creatures and ignored corpses. Lin Xuan had thought of using this to his advantage, utilizing the Hundred Souls Banner to deceive the Blood Demon Beast by masking his vital energy with ghostly mist and yin souls, making it believe he was not a living being but a ghost.

Though he could fight the demonic beast with his spiritual treasures if needed, conserving his energy in this dangerous place was beneficial. Moreover, Lin Xuan had sensed other people arriving, making it even more crucial not to linger.

With the Hundred Souls Banner, Lin Xuan had successfully deceived the Blood Demon Beast, and now, he had to proceed with caution.
