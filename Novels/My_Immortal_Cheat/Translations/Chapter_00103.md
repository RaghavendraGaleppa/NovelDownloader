# Chapter 103: Transformation

Samman and the two others formed a triangle, chanting strange syllables as runes drifted into the chains. Clattering, the crimson chains vibrated incessantly, detaching from the metal casing. Samman and the two continued their chants, and the patterns engraved on the casing lit up. Strangely, not all patterns illuminated; instead, they lit up according to a special sequence, quickly forming a specific design on the casing's surface.

As if on cue, the casing, which had previously been seamless, split open down the middle, and crimson light seeped out from the crack. The crack widened, and the object within the casing was fully revealed before Zhou Tian.

"Is this... the Ash Spear?" Zhou Tian's face was filled with surprise, deeply shaken by what he saw inside.

"That's right, this is the Ash Spear!" Samman was very pleased with Zhou Tian's expression, a hint of pride in his voice.

Zhou Tian was speechless, staring at the crimson spearhead floating above a circular altar inside the casing. It slowly rotated, its facets crystal clear and exquisitely crafted. In a trance, Zhou Tian seemed to witness an ancient deity wielding a divine spear, each movement capable of shattering the heavens.

*No way… Dude… Just for this broken thing, where does your sense of pride come from? And it's only half a spearhead?!* As the spearhead rotated, Zhou Tian suddenly noticed it was only a half, leaving him utterly speechless.

However, seeing the fanatical gazes of Samman and the others, Zhou Tian decided not to mock the broken spearhead. Obsessed fans could be terrifying.

Samman took out the red silk cloth from his pocket, carefully held it, and walked forward step by step, seemingly about to place it on the altar.

Zhou Tian furrowed his brows slightly. *Now?* All his skills hadn't refreshed, attack seals only had three or four uses left, and resurrection chances were also tied to the Sacred Word, which itself had a seven-day cooldown. To be safe, he didn't want to start now, not for Anduin, but for Zhang Yi and Mu Su.

"Samman, are we starting now?"

"Yes," Samman's eyes were firm. "The Son of God has suffered for a long time; we absolutely cannot let him stay in that place for another moment."

"My people will take about six more hours to arrive. The Holy Church is not an ordinary sect; it's hard to say they don't have deeply hidden trump cards. It's better to wait until my people arrive before acting, which will give us a greater chance of success." Zhou Tian knew that if he simply wanted to delay for time, Samman and the others would never agree, so he fabricated a baseless excuse.

Samman's face showed a flicker of indecision. Zhou Tian struck while the iron was hot and continued, "Just by waiting a bit longer, we'll have a greater chance. I believe even Anduin wouldn't mind waiting a bit longer."

"Alright." Zhou Tian's words became the last straw that broke the camel's back. Samman nodded in agreement; it seemed his status among the three was the highest. As for Zhou Tian's "my people," Samman didn't doubt it. In his mind, it was perfectly normal for someone who could strike a deal with their Son of God and escape from the Holy Church Inquisition to have backing forces.

Zhou Tian was then led by a follower to a resting place, waiting for time to pass. Time passed quickly, with no major incidents. Although he heard from the followers that Holy Church knights had passed by on the surface several times, they had been operating here for a long time and hadn't been discovered.

Soon, six hours had passed. The moment his resurrection chances and skills refreshed, Zhou Tian opened his eyes and said, "Take me to Bishop Samman." The accompanying follower dared not delay, leading Zhou Tian to where the Ash Spear was stored.

Samman and the two others had remained there the entire time. The moment he saw them, Zhou Tian spoke.

"Samman, my people have arrived near Celer City; we can act now."

"Good!" Samman, his face filled with excitement, walked into the casing and placed the blood-stained silk cloth onto the altar beneath the half-spearhead. Instantly, the crimson color faded from the silk, and a drop of blood coalesced – it was precisely the blood Anduin had dripped onto it earlier. The white cloth turned to ash and vanished.

The crimson spearhead gleamed with divine light. The blood drop, tinged with gold, perfectly merged with the spearhead. Zhou Tian wondered if it was an illusion, but he seemed to hear a roar. When he looked again, the crimson spearhead had already vanished from the altar.

Samman shouted, "Quickly, go to Celer City to support the Son of God!" Turning his head, Zhou Tian had vanished from his spot. Samman wasn't too surprised; how could someone who could cooperate with the Son of God be ordinary?

The entire underground became a surging tide of people, each face brimming with excitement, as if they weren't heading into a life-or-death battle, but rather to obtain a great fortuitous encounter.

And the moment the crimson spearhead vanished, inside the Inquisition, within Anduin's cage.

Anduin, who had been sitting cross-legged, suddenly opened his eyes, crimson flames blazing within them. The space before him shattered, and an object shimmering with divine light abruptly appeared—it was precisely the vanished Ash Spear…head.

Even Anduin showed a look of excitement. He reached out and grasped it. The incomplete Ash Spearhead glowed with dazzling crimson light, as if molten lava flowed from it. In an instant, it formed a complete crimson spear shaft, covered in magma-like patterns, appearing entirely undamaged as it settled into Anduin's hand.

Anduin gripped the Ash Spear. Magma-like patterns spread across his entire body. He hunched over, his face flushed, as if in extreme pain.

"Aargh!" With a furious roar, a pair of crimson wings burst forth from his back with a tearing sound. Purple horns grew on his head, his entire body ignited with crimson flames, and his physique doubled in height out of thin air. Crimson magma dripped from his rocky muscles, appearing exactly like the phantom image that had appeared behind him previously.

His exhaled breath transformed into a molten storm. With a gentle wave, the cage that had once troubled him was torn apart like thin paper before the Ash Spear. The other creatures in the cages watched in stunned silence, only Zhang Yi and Mu Su's eyes flickering.

The transformed Anduin walked up to their two cages and ripped the bars apart. Zhang Yi stretched his body, pulled two longswords from the void, and handed one to Mu Su. It seemed the Holy Church people didn't know about portable dimensions; they hadn't sealed his spatial storage at all, only preventing its use within the cage.

"Follow me." A deep, resonant voice emanated from the creature's mouth. Zhang Yi and Mu Su exchanged glances and nodded.

Anduin strode forward, each step leaving a continuously burning footprint on the ground. An energy construct arrived. It had now been purified by the Holy Church and was condensing a Sacred Spear in its hand.

*Pfft!* The Ash Spear pierced through its body, crimson flames engulfing it. In moments, it melted into metallic liquid and flowed away. Anduin's steps didn't falter in the slightest.

Zhang Yi was a little surprised. *What kind of power was this? Just now, Anduin was merely at the Dharma Aspect stage. After obtaining that weapon, he was probably a Saint King, right? How could he wield that weapon without any burden? Was that the power of divine blood?*
