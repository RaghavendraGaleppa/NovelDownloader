# Chapter 36: Concealment Technique

"Senior Brother, I was just about to report to you!"

Upon hearing this, the figure on the right retrieved a jade tablet from the pile, which bore Gu Mo's name. He had been watching this disciple since the latter entered the outer sect. The reason was simple—Gu Mo's reclusive nature made him the perfect target for infiltration.

With a few subtle manipulations, he had poisoned Gu Mo, rendering him unable to cultivate. In his moment of despair, he guided Gu Mo to the "Soul Refining Scripture" he had prepared.

The Soul Refining Scripture was an extremely peculiar cultivation method. It required no spiritual root talent to begin, but the risks were immense. The first step involved refining one's own soul—success meant mastery, while failure resulted in soul annihilation.

From his observations, Gu Mo had succeeded. Using the Soul Refining Scripture, he managed to draw Qi into his body within the required timeframe.

But this was only the beginning. To advance further in the Soul Refining Scripture, one could only improve by devouring and refining living souls. No amount of regular cultivation would yield progress.

Next, he provided the "Corpse Ghost True Interpretation," a body-tempering technique that, like the Soul Refining Scripture, required no spiritual root talent—only the essence and blood of cultivators.

With these two techniques, Gu Mo was completely under his control. The Qinglu Sect would never tolerate a disciple practicing such dark arts. Moreover, the jade tablet wasn't just a meaningless token—it contained a sliver of Gu Mo's soul. If he disobeyed, he could be cursed to death through the tablet.

Thus, the infiltration of an outer sect disciple was complete. Those desperate to grow stronger would inevitably seek souls and essence, whether by attacking fellow disciples or secretly preying on mortals. Though the damage to the Qinglu Sect might seem minor, as the saying went, "A small leak will sink a great ship."

But Gu Mo had surprised him. Previously unremarkable, he had displayed astonishing comprehension after joining the Spirit Plant Hall, mastering a farming spell in three months and achieving perfection in the Cleansing Technique. He had even caught the attention of the hall's overseer—making him the most outstanding among the infiltrated disciples so far.

His exceptional comprehension, combined with the Soul Refining Scripture and Corpse Ghost True Interpretation, was a perfect match. While these techniques didn't require spiritual root talent, comprehension became crucial in later stages. Outer sect disciples with poor spiritual roots usually lacked comprehension as well, limiting their potential to mere cannon fodder. But Gu Mo had the makings of a valuable chess piece.

"He is indeed worth nurturing!"

After hearing the report on Gu Mo, the figure on the left produced a manual and a jade vial. "Give these to the boy."

"Yes!"

The figure on the right accepted them respectfully before both vanished.

"Senior Brother Mai, these are the disciples who wish to join our Spirit Plant Hall!" Gu Mo led a group of over a dozen to the Personnel Hall.

"Thank you for your hard work, Junior Brother Gu Mo!"

Mai Yunfa smoothly yielded his seat to Gu Mo before registering the newcomers. He then borrowed a spirit boat from the Spirit Plant Hall to ferry them over.

"A few more days, and this will be done."

Watching Mai Yunfa depart, Gu Mo exhaled deeply. Over the past few days, he had visited every outer sect disciple, explaining the benefits of joining the Spirit Plant Hall. Only those in seclusion remained, but Qi-Refining stage seclusions rarely lasted more than a few days.

Once he finished, his task would be complete.

Stretching, Gu Mo headed to the resting area behind the Personnel Hall—a space reserved for visiting inner sect disciples. Due to his outstanding performance, the Spirit Plant Hall had arranged one for him, proving he now enjoyed inner sect privileges.

"Hmm?"

Entering the room, Gu Mo's gaze froze as it landed on the table. A familiar sight greeted him—a manual and, for the first time, a jade vial.

"Damn it!"

Gu Mo cursed under his breath. The dark cultivator behind the scenes was still watching him. He was certain the culprit was within the outer sect, but knowing that was useless. Even if he identified them, his current strength made reporting them impossible.

Still, Gu Mo had a solution—he would dump any dark cultivation manuals into the black mist space. As long as he didn't practice them and avoided the outer sect, the schemer couldn't control him.

"Wait..."

As he approached, the words "Concealment Technique" on the manual made his breath hitch. Unless this was a trap, it was exactly what he needed—a method to mask his aura.

After carefully inspecting the manual for traps, Gu Mo used a stick to flip it open. As he suspected, it was indeed an aura-concealing technique, superior to the "Hidden Qi Art" he had considered. While the latter only masked cultivation fluctuations, this technique could suppress all traces of his presence.

"This is incredible!"

After studying the Concealment Technique, Gu Mo couldn't help but marvel at its ingenuity. Drawing on knowledge from his past life, he quickly grasped its principle: cultivators were essentially walking energy sources, and this technique constructed an internal barrier to contain their emissions—both energy and aura.

Realizing this wasn't a dark cultivation method, Gu Mo knew he could safely practice it. This saved him the years and contribution points he would have spent acquiring the Hidden Qi Art.

But why would the dark cultivator send him a legitimate technique? Puzzled, Gu Mo turned to the jade vial—the first non-manual item he had received.

When he cautiously opened it, a wave of bloodlust assaulted his senses, accompanied by a ghastly wail.

Gu Mo's expression darkened. Without hesitation, he tossed the vial into the black mist space, vowing never to touch it again.

He knew what it contained—a cultivator's soul and essence. Had he practiced the Soul Refining Scripture and Corpse Ghost True Interpretation, consuming these would have instantly elevated him to the second layer of Qi Refining.

"Now I understand."

The purpose of the Concealment Technique became clear. Devouring souls and essence would leave karmic traces detectable by specialized methods. Additionally, sudden power surges needed masking to avoid suspicion.

"How thoughtful." Gu Mo's expression turned grave.

There was no doubt—he had been marked by a dark cultivator who intended to groom him as a key asset. Otherwise, why would they part with such precious resources? To dark cultivators, souls and essence were as valuable as cultivation pills.
