# Chapter 29: Vajra Art Elixirs and Spiritual Treasure Package  

Han Li struggled to his feet, his eyes scanning the surroundings warily.  

"Who ambushed me?!" he demanded angrily, clutching his arm where a stone projectile had struck him.  

"Seeing you makes me uncomfortable!" A gloomy, thin-faced man with a hooked nose emerged from behind a large tree.  

"Who are you? I don't recall ever meeting you, let alone offending you. Why attack me out of nowhere?" Han Li's restless heart immediately calmed when he noticed the man's cultivation at the twelfth level of Qi Refinement.  

"Hmph—" The hook-nosed man snorted disdainfully and pointed at the storage pouch at Han Li's waist. "Never offended me?!"  

"I am Ye Long!"  

"That Foundation Establishment Pill you obtained with the Ascension Token—it was supposed to be mine!"  

"You stole my spot with that token!"  

Meanwhile, Lin Yun was busy preparing for his plan to expand his social circle within the Yellow Maple Valley. He was crafting high-tier talismans, and the Chen family, upon hearing the news, quickly used their influence to procure materials for him from various sources.  

The spirit stones they had invested in him were meant to help him advance to an intermediate talisman master, so they not only didn't question his purchases but were also delighted by his progress.  

While Lin Yun was engrossed in his talisman crafting, a system notification suddenly appeared.  

**[Ding! Your friend, Han Tianzun, has sent you a request for help.]**  

Lin Yun paused his brush, muttering in surprise, "A request for help now? Did someone steal his Foundation Establishment Pill? But what does that have to do with me?"  

Just as he shook his head and was about to ignore it, another pop-up appeared.  

**[Help your friend Han Li reclaim the Foundation Establishment Pill that was forcibly taken from him to receive the Tianzun's Gift.]**  

**[Tianzun's Gift: Obtain the Vajra Art Elixirs and Spiritual Treasure Package (Complete Edition, Layers 1 to 7).]**  

**[Treasure Description: Contains all the elixirs and spiritual treasures Han Li used to cultivate the Vajra Art in the Spirit Realm, covering progression from the first layer to Great Perfection.]**  

"Gah!!"  

*Thud!*  

Furious, Lin Yun slammed his brush onto the table. "How dare they bully my sworn brother—though we share neither father nor mother!"  

"Even when beating a dog, one must consider its owner!"  

"To bully my brother is to insult me!"  

"This is intolerable!"  

"Elixirs, wait—no, dear brother, don't be afraid! Your big brother is coming!" Lin Yun shot out of the talisman hall like an arrow.  

Back in the forest, Han Li had received help from a Foundation Establishment elder surnamed Wu. However, the opposing side was backed by a mid-stage Foundation Establishment elder surnamed Ye.  

It turned out that Ye Long was the grandnephew of this Elder Ye.  

"New disciples these days have no respect for their elders," Elder Ye said coldly, hands clasped behind his back. "But Junior Brother Wu, you went too far. This child is my grandnephew."  

"Senior Brother Ye, your grandnephew is excessively violent, aiming to kill with every move. It seems you've neglected his discipline. As his elder, how could I stand by and watch?" Elder Wu retorted without backing down.  

Elder Ye was furious at the sarcasm, but since forcibly taking the Foundation Establishment Pill wasn't something to be proud of—and could damage the sect's reputation—he suppressed his anger.  

"Both of us were young once. How did we reach this level of cultivation? By reasoning?"  

"In the world of cultivation, strength is reason!"  

"This boy's spiritual roots and cultivation are inferior to my grandnephew's. The Foundation Establishment Pill should naturally go to the more capable one."  

"Junior Brother Wu, as someone who has walked this path, surely you understand?" Elder Ye stepped closer, his voice icy.  

"The pill is trivial, but a life is not. This boy entered our sect with an Ascension Token. If he dies here, it would be a severe blow to our reputation!" Wu Feng countered firmly.  

"Senior Brother, I may not meddle in grand affairs, but I will not ignore injustices in small matters!"  

"Junior Brother Wu, you're at a critical stage in breaking through to mid-stage Foundation Establishment. An injury now would ruin your chance!" Elder Ye's eyes flashed as he unleashed his mid-stage Foundation Establishment aura.  

Wu Feng hesitated.  

Neither wanted to escalate the conflict—Wu Feng didn't wish to fight someone a realm above him, and Elder Ye didn't want to antagonize a promising junior who might soon reach his level.  

"Leave this to me. I have a compromise." With that, Elder Ye strode to Han Li and looked down at him disdainfully.  

"Han Li, with your cultivation, carrying such a treasure only invites trouble. Besides, with your talent, even ten Foundation Establishment Pills won't get you to Foundation Establishment. Let me safeguard it for you."  

"What do you say?"  

"Elder Ye, though my talent is lacking, I still strive to improve. I won't trouble you," Han Li said stubbornly, head lowered.  

*Hmph!*  

Elder Ye's patience wore thin. "You have backbone, but no sense!"  

"There's a saying in the mortal world—'A wise man submits to circumstances.'"  

"Why not think long-term?"  

"Fine. I'll trade you spirit stones and medicinal herbs for it."  

"Don't push your luck!"  

The warning was clear. Han Li knew he couldn't keep the pill.  

*It seems I have no choice but to yield for now. People like Brother Lin—who don't bully others despite their strength and instead help—are rare in this world.*  

"Th-thank you, Elder!" Han Li gritted his teeth and handed over the pill.  

Ye Long's eyes gleamed with greed. At the twelfth level of Qi Refinement, he was desperate for the pill to break through.  

After verifying its authenticity, Elder Ye tossed Han Li a storage pouch—filled with worthless items.  

The artifacts weren't even top-grade, just three mid-tier ones, and only three mid-grade spirit stones.  

Though Han Li had never handled a Foundation Establishment Pill before, he knew the trade was grossly unfair. But he dared not protest.  

"I'm refining a batch of Unity Pills and lack some herbs. I'll make up the difference later."  

"You have an audience with the sect leader tomorrow. Rest early."  

Without waiting for a response, Elder Ye turned and left.  

Frustrated, Han Li clenched a handful of dirt before letting it slip through his fingers. *Perhaps this is the sorrow of the weak.*  

Behind him, Ye Long smirked triumphantly.  

*Hmph!*  

"This is no one's fault but my own—I'm simply not strong enough." Han Li glanced at Elder Wu, resentment burning in his heart. But he knew this wasn't the time for confrontation.  

"Survival comes first."  

"One day, I'll make them all pay!"  

Dragging his injured body back to his stone hut, Han Li swallowed a healing pill and began meditating.  

*Buzz—*  

Suddenly, the wards around his hut were triggered.  

Han Li's eyes snapped open in alarm.  

"Who's there? Who would come for me now?"  

*Could it be Elder Ye? Does he still want me dead even after taking the pill?*  

*What do I do? Is this the end for Han Li?*  

*I need to contact Brother Lin!*  

Just as panic set in, a familiar voice called from outside.  

"Little Li, are you resting?"  

"Huh? Brother Lin?" Han Li rose, puzzled. "Why is he here at this hour?"
