# Chapter 432: The Dao Sect's Trump Card

The ancient bronze bell atop Clear Mist Peak rang nine times. The sound waves, infused with Bi Yuan's true qi, reverberated back and forth between the thirty-six peaks.

The old monsters hidden within the blessed caves and paradises opened their turbid eyes one after another. Three Supreme Elders, who were slumbering in cold jade coffins, saw the frost on their coffin lids suddenly shatter. Two gaunt old men meditating beneath waterfalls saw the currents around them instantly reverse and flow upward. Seven other powerful figures, scattered across various hidden and spiritually rich locations—some refining pills, others observing the stars—all stopped what they were doing simultaneously.

The first to appear was an elder in a purple robe who stepped out from a geothermal fire pit, his body entwined with dark red chains.

These were "Seal Vein Chains" forged from thousand-year-old profound iron. Each chain pierced his vital acupoints, forcibly locking in his dissipating vitality. His face was deeply wrinkled, capable of crushing a mosquito to death, and the sparse white hair on his head was barely tied into a Daoist topknot with a jade hairpin. As he walked, the chains clattered, making him look like a zombie crawling out of an ancient tomb.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, secretly marveling. These people had reached the pinnacle of the martial path but were unable to break through due to the shackles of the world. If they could step across the Ninth Realm and achieve the status of a Land Immortal, they might be able to extend their lives by another hundred years.

This Daoist had already lived to the limit of two hundred years.

"宗主敲响九声钟，莫非天魔提前降临？" (The Sect Master has struck the bell nine times; could it be that the Heavenly Demon has descended early?)

The elder's voice was as hoarse as two pieces of sandpaper rubbing together, and his aura was so decayed that he seemed as if he would die at any moment.

Xu Yunfan's Martial Dao Heavenly Eye opened slightly. As divine light circulated, he saw through the secrets of the purple-robed elder's body. Within his withered frame, his vital energy and blood were compressed to the extreme, condensed like a pill, forming a cycle within his flesh and acupoints. Wherever this "Blood Pill" passed, it would release a sliver of vitality to nourish this decaying body, preventing it from completely losing its shell.

This "Blood Pill" was like a dying oil lamp, locking in the last spark of life in an almost sinister manner, forcefully defying heaven to prolong his life until now.

On the martial path, there were indeed many brilliant geniuses who had researched various methods.

Bi Yuan was about to answer.

Just then, a green light shot up from the Sword Tomb on the back mountain.

The newcomer was an old woman of a dwarf-like stature, less than four feet tall, yet she carried a bronze greatsword on her back that was taller than she was. Her face was covered with a spiderweb of green patterns—this was the "Sword Intent" refined into her flesh and blood. As her true qi flowed, it crept to the ends of the blood vessels in her body, causing this phenomenon.

The most bizarre thing was her eyes; they had no pupils, only a pair of whites.

"Senior Uncle Qingming's 'Sword Heart Without Eyes' has actually reached such a realm."

Bi Yuan nodded slightly.

This Supreme Elder, known as the "Sword Maniac" three hundred years ago, had destroyed her own eyes fifty years ago in pursuit of the realm of man-sword unity, refining her Sword Intent into her optic nerves. Although she was "looking" at Xu Yunfan now, she was actually perceiving the world through her Sword Intent.

Suddenly, the ground swelled, and a clay-like old man burrowed out.

He was covered in dry, cracked earth shells, and with every step, fragments fell off. This was the result of cultivating the Dao Sect's Thick Earth Wu Gen True Art. By borrowing the rising spiritual energy of heaven and earth, he had connected himself to the earth's veins, relying on absorbing earth energy to slow his aging.

When he stood still in the morning light, the earth shells on his face crumbled away, revealing the bluish-gray skin underneath, looking very much like an unearthed bronze artifact.

"Cough, cough... My Tortoise Breathing Technique was interrupted. I've lost three years of my life..."

As the earth-shelled elder spoke, a muddy, fishy smell continuously spewed from his nostrils.

Xu Yunfan suppressed his nausea and discovered that the elder's feet had already grown roots into the ground, indicating he had not moved for far too long.

The most terrifying one was the black shadow that walked out from the mural in the Ancestral Hall. It was a shadowy, humanoid form with no physical body, composed entirely of incense and the faith of believers. This was the "Divine Wanderer Avatar" of the previous Sect Master of the Dao Sect. The original body had passed away a hundred years ago, and it was only maintained by the incense offered by believers.

Wherever the black shadow passed, the grass and trees instantly withered, as it was constantly absorbing vitality to maintain its existence.

Xu Yunfan frowned slightly, his gaze sweeping over the black shadow like lightning.

He was no stranger to such forms condensed from incense and faith. The Bright Lord worshipped by the Incense Sect he had encountered before was similar. Under the erosion of the mixed thoughts and faith from countless believers, it had become an existence between life and death. In the end, when he had achieved the Land Immortal realm and casually crushed it, it was already as mindless as a walking corpse.

However, this previous Sect Master of the Dao Sect was completely different.

The faith power surrounding the black shadow was as pure as fresh snow, and his bearing still vaguely carried the grace of a transcendent Daoist. What was even more surprising was that when Xu Yunfan's Foundation Establishment divine sense swept over him, he caught a glimmer of clarity in the other's empty eye sockets.

That was not the madness tainted by incense, but a transparency tempered through a hundred years of vicissitudes.

The Dao Sect was truly a great sect. Only with devout worship could such a pure incense avatar be formed.

As if sensing Xu Yunfan's scrutiny, the black shadow slowly raised its head, the corners of its mouth pulling into a faint, ambiguous smile, and gave Xu Yunfan a solemn nod.

This simple action caused the candles in the hall to sway in unison, casting twelve shadows of varying depths on the blue bricks, reminiscent of the grand occasion when the twelve lineages of the Dao Sect once ruled the world together.

Now, it was even more so.

Great Zhou had already honored the Dao Sect as its state religion.

Twelve Ninth Realm Grandmasters gathered in the Clear Mist Hall, the air filled with a mixture of decay and medicinal scents.

Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath, the corners of his eyes twitching slightly.

The Dao Sect had truly laid out its family assets for him to see.

Looking at these "living fossils," someone had seven useless Soul-Stabilizing Pearls hanging around their neck, someone had Life-Prolonging Silkworm Silk wrapped around their waist, and there was even an elder with three golden needles inserted into his Heavenly灵盖 (Baihui acupoint), the ends of which were still trembling slightly.

What kind of foundation was this? It was clearly a group of old zombies crawling out of their coffins!

"Esteemed Senior Uncles and Elders," Bi Yuan's voice carried a hint of emotion. "This is my disciple, Xu Yunfan. He has already successfully established his foundation in the Upper World. The Taihua Spirit Ruin Realm,想必 (I'm sure) you have all heard of it. You have not lived in vain until now. Once we go there, you will be able to live a new life!"

Twelve pairs of eyes shot toward him simultaneously.

The "clay man" Supreme Elder suddenly had a fit of violent coughing, the earth shell cracking to reveal the blackened organs inside: "Cough, cough... This boy has a dragon and snake entwined... Could it be..."

"The True武 Subduing Demons True Scripture, the method cultivated by the True Lord of Divine Martial back in the day. The continuation of the martial path, or rather, the origin of all the world's martial arts, stems from it."

Xu Yunfan opened his palm. The intertwined turtle and snake Dao patterns materialized in the air.

The snake pattern was like lightning, its锋芒 (sharpness) revealed as it coiled, dominating with fierce and sharp killing intent. The turtle shell was heavy and profound, lying dormant as stable as a mountain, governing defense without flaw. The two auras entangled, the turtle's head biting the snake's tail, the snake's body winding around the turtle's feet. As yin and yang rotated, a Xuanwu Dharma Form condensed in the void.

The turtle's shell carried the heavens and all things, the snake's eyes pierced through the darkness to illuminate the minute. Where the turtle and snake met at the neck, a starlight of blue and green burst forth, a clear external manifestation of the True武 Subduing Demons True Scripture cultivated to perfection.

In an instant, the stale aura of the twelve old monsters was revitalized.
