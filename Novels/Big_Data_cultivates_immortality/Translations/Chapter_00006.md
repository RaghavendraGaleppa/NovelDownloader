# Chapter 6: A Minor Hiccup  

Sister Hong came by for an inspection, said a few casual words, and then left as if nothing had happened.  

But the employees of Hongjie were utterly bewildered: What exactly was the boss implying?  

Without a doubt, Feng Jun had turned the tables in an instant—thanks to Sister Hong’s intervention.  

Yes, coaches held higher priority than regular employees. To protect a coach, the lobby manager could openly show favoritism—that was just how life worked. But when the company’s top boss spoke, she could act as she pleased—that was life too.  

At the end of the day, the one who paid the wages had the final say.  

In fact, Sister Hong’s words were quite reasonable and struck at the heart of the matter—Liu Shuming might be a coach, and the people he harassed might have been temporary customers, but they were still the company’s customers.  

Not only members deserved proper treatment. Without temporary customers, where would the members come from?  

Sister Hong seized this point to warn Coach Liu. No one could say she was wrong—at the very least, her reasoning was far more convincing than Manager Guo’s. Liu Shuming had harmed the company’s core interests.  

But then, Sister Hong’s consolation to Feng Jun was truly baffling—"Your grass planting is quite good"?  

Was it really appropriate for a company’s top boss to overlook a postgraduate’s mistake just for that?  

Wasn’t that a bit too capricious?  

Guo Yueling froze for a moment before giving Feng Jun a meaningful look. "Did you report to Sister Hong?"  

Feng Jun was equally confused. Hearing this, he instinctively sneered, "Whether I reported or not is none of your damn business!"  

Manager Guo’s face turned pale with anger, but she didn’t dare to provoke the young man further. The reason was simple—when Sister Hong pointed out Liu Shuming’s mistake, wasn’t she also reprimanding her, the lobby manager?  

Picking on an unruly employee wasn’t wrong, but ignoring the company’s core interests for that purpose was a grave mistake.  

A lobby manager might be a senior executive, but a single word from the company’s boss could strip her of everything.  

Guo Yueling took a few deep breaths before glaring at Feng Jun resentfully. "Fine, I won’t count yesterday as absenteeism. But today, you were definitely late. Even if Sister Hong speaks up for you, it won’t change that!"  

Though she had been publicly rebuked by the boss and had to retract some of her decisions, she was strictly following company rules regarding Feng Jun’s tardiness today. She wasn’t afraid of the boss finding fault—she was acting in the company’s best interest.  

Still, even as she spoke, her mind raced: What exactly was Feng Jun’s relationship with Sister Hong?  

The idea that Sister Hong fancied him was practically impossible. The club had no shortage of handsome, fit young men. While Feng Jun wasn’t bad-looking, he wasn’t particularly outstanding either.  

Add to that his height of 1.73 meters and slightly chubby build…  

Would the famously cold and proud boss of Hongjie really be interested in someone like him? That was just laughable.  

So, figuring out the connection between this guy and Sister Hong was her real goal.  

If she could pressure him into revealing it, she might even let his tardiness slide this time.  

After all, a lobby manager was just an employee—she had to cater to the boss’s moods.  

But to her frustration, Feng Jun replied leisurely, "Mark me as late, and I’ll be in a bad mood. If I’m in a bad mood, of course, I won’t plant grass well…"  

Plant your damn grass! Guo Yueling nearly exploded with rage.  

She wanted to curse him out, but in the end, she just snorted coldly. "Fine, I’ll count this afternoon as your day off… Since your family isn’t in Zheng Yang, it’s not like you have anywhere to go anyway."  

Feng Jun had originally planned to just take the tardiness strike today. It was only because of her earlier bullying that he had counterattacked. Whether he got the afternoon off or not didn’t matter to him.  

So he didn’t bother making a fuss. With a light humph, he turned and went to exercise on the gym equipment.  

However, he underestimated everyone’s appetite for gossip. Before long, Xiao Li from the front desk sidled up to him and whispered, "Hey, Double Degree, what’s really going on between you and Sister Hong? Why did she protect you today?"  

Feng Jun glanced at her, thought for a moment, and replied, "If I said it’s because my grass planting is quite good… you wouldn’t believe me, right?"  

Xiao Li rolled her eyes. "Duh."  

Feng Jun spread his hands, feigning innocence. "Honestly, I don’t know why Sister Hong is so nice to me… Maybe she just doesn’t like Manager Guo?"  

"You’re supposed to be educated—can’t you even tell the truth?" Xiao Li huffed before turning away, her perky backside swaying as she walked off. "Manager Guo’s cousin is Sister Hong’s best friend!"  

Despite her words, she couldn’t help but wonder: Had Manager Guo been overstepping her authority lately?  

Zhao Hongqi stood nearby, watching everything thoughtfully. After a long pause, he took out his phone, opened QQ Farm, hesitated, then uprooted his nearly ripe ginseng fruit and silently planted grass seeds instead…  

Feng Jun exercised intermittently for two hours before heading back to the showers. Only then did he take a closer look at the stone bracelet mark on his wrist.  

After his second "grass-holding" session, the mark seemed to have faded slightly. But judging by its current color, it should still be strong enough for another attempt.  

Yet Feng Jun was genuinely tired of planting grass. Harvesting it was backbreaking work, and he wasn’t getting any tangible benefits from it.  

Sure, Sister Hong had praised his grass planting, and it had saved his job, but that wasn’t much of a reward. What Feng Jun wanted was cash—a way to monetize his supernatural encounter!  

Using a legendary opportunity to manage a QQ Farm? That was just a waste.  

Besides, the conditions for entering and exiting the farm were too demanding. He couldn’t keep damaging transformers, could he? Even though they were public property, Feng Jun didn’t want to vandalize them lightly.  

A person should still have some principles.  

After his shower, he returned to the dormitory and stared at his phone for a long time before finally deciding: He’d just plant one plot of grass. That way, harvesting wouldn’t be too exhausting.  

But just as he selected the grass seeds and was about to plant them, his vision blurred, and he found himself back in the farm.  

"Damn it!" Feng Jun cursed. "I forgot—I was supposed to use my right hand!"  

Would using his right hand prevent him from entering QQ Farm? Not necessarily. It was just a theory he wanted to test. But in his daze, he’d absentmindedly used his left hand again.  

Either way, since he was already inside, regret was pointless. Feng Jun found a burlap sack on the field’s edge filled with grass seeds.  

He had originally planned to plant just one plot, but after recalling Sister Hong’s praise, he hesitated and ended up sowing all ten plots.  

If the grass matured and he didn’t feel like harvesting it, the boss could steal it if she wanted.  

Planting didn’t take long, and by now, Feng Jun had figured out some tricks for entering and exiting the farm. Once he finished his tasks, he could easily leave by silently willing himself to exit.  

When his consciousness returned to the dormitory, he looked around and suddenly slapped his thigh. "Damn it, I forgot to borrow another phone to record this!"  

He really wanted to know what happened to his physical body and his phone when his consciousness entered the farm.  

He was a meticulous researcher, but after gaining this supernatural ability, his excitement had made him scatterbrained. Not only had he forgotten to use his right hand, but he’d also neglected to borrow a phone.  

Feng Jun was a man of action—once he thought of something, he did it without hesitation. Just like when he’d accompanied his girlfriend to the south to pursue their dreams, he’d left without a second thought.  

So he picked up his phone and called Wang Haifeng—the guy hadn’t shown up for work in two days.  

Unfortunately, Coach Wang’s phone was out of service. After a moment’s thought, Feng Jun called Xiao Li at the front desk.  

As a girl, Xiao Li was wary when he asked to borrow her phone, citing privacy concerns. "If you really want to borrow it, there’s one condition."  

Feng Jun cut straight to the point. "I really don’t know why Sister Hong protected me."  

"Double Degree, you’re really sharp. How’d you get so smart?" Xiao Li had indeed planned to ask that. Unfazed by his refusal, she teased, "Not going with the ‘good grass planting’ excuse anymore?"  

"Give me a break," Feng Jun chuckled. "That was probably just a random excuse Sister Hong used to cover for me."  

Xiao Li snorted dismissively. "She’s the company’s general manager. Does she need a reason to protect an employee?"  

"Huh?" Feng Jun paused, struck by the undeniable logic.  

But something about her reasoning felt off.  

He wasn’t easily swayed. "Anyway, that’s the reason she gave. So, are you lending me the phone or not?"  

Xiao Li hesitated before replying, "Fine, but you have to use it in front of me."  

That wouldn’t work. After a brief silence, Feng Jun countered, "Xiao Li, haven’t I often bought you breakfast without asking for anything in return?"  

Xiao Li frowned. "What could you possibly ask for just for picking up breakfast?"  

"Exactly," Feng Jun raised an eyebrow. "If I’m just borrowing your phone, what could I possibly do to it?"  

Xiao Li hung up without another word, staring at her phone before reluctantly opening the uninstall menu. Her eyes lingered over her banking apps, Alipay, WeChat…  

The next day at 6:30 a.m., Feng Jun got up, pulled his phone from under the bed, and smiled at the 100% battery notification. He swiped the screen open and used his right hand to launch QQ Farm.  

As expected, his consciousness didn’t enter the farm.  

But the next moment, he froze. "What the hell… Who uprooted my grass?"
