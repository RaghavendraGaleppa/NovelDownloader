# Chapter 707: The Dao Fruit?

“Break!”

The fists, carrying the condensed, tangible紫金 (Purple-Gold) Thunder transmitted across the boundary by Xu Yunfan, slammed forward violently.

The target was neither the slashing sword nor the shooting chains, but the sticky blood waves beneath his feet and the solidified reef of resentment beside him.

**BOOM!!!**

The terrifying Purple-Gold Thunder球 (Thunder Sphere) exploded violently at the contact point between the blood waves and the reef.

The supreme Yang and supreme rigid Divine Dawn Thunder collided with the supreme Yin and supreme evil, defiling all living things’ blood wave death aura, erupting in a world-shaking roar.

It was like a large splash of cold water falling into a pot of boiling oil.

The sticky blood waves were torn apart and vaporized by the violent power of thunder and fire, surging up into dozens of丈 (Zhang) high dark red巨浪 (giant waves).

The hard reef of resentment cracked and disintegrated inch by inch in the thunder, turning into powder.

Countless affected浑噩真灵 (muddled true souls) didn't even have time to cry out before they were instantly vaporized.

This move by Xu Yunfan wasn't to attack the enemy, but to create maximum chaos so he could escape from the two Golden Core cultivators.

Now was not the time for a life-and-death battle with them. He hadn't even seen the face of the太阴冥虬道果 (Grand Yin Dark Qiu Dao Fruit) yet. If his分身 (clone),悟空 (Wukong), died here, it would be a huge loss.

Using the supreme Yang Divine Dawn Thunder to ignite the supreme Yin power of the Underworld caused a local area to tremble.

The effect was immediate.

The blood wave area ignited by the thunder instantly formed a huge dark red漩涡 (vortex), emitting a terrifying suction force.

What was even more terrifying was that above the core of the explosion, the gray, hazy sky suddenly turned pitch black.

Countless紫黑 (Purple-Black) thunders, carrying a dense aura of inauspiciousness and destruction, appeared out of thin air, like enraged thunder snakes, frantically striking down.

These thunders were not the Divine Dawn Thunder Xu Yunfan had summoned, but the heavenly punishment lightning generated by the Underworld's own laws after being violently disturbed, targeting the destroyers.

Their target was precisely the source of the explosion, Wukong, and the two powerful auras strong enough to draw the gaze of the laws.

Tong Xuan Zhenjun and White-Haired Zhenjun.

“It worked!”

Inside the Divine Dawn Mountain, Xu Yunfan, who witnessed all this through Wukong's vision, relaxed slightly, a smile appearing in his eyes.

To be honest, no one could have imagined that someone in the Underworld could unleash such a supreme Yang and rigid attack, especially using the Thunder method, the top offensive technique among术法 (术法).

This move truly made this region fall into a continuously exploding pot of oil, turning the world upside down.

The three玄冰巨刃 (Ice Giant Blades) slashed by Tong Xuan Zhenjun were instantly淹没 (submerged) by the violent impact of the blood waves and the falling Purple-Black Thunder.

The Sword Soul emitted a piercing哀鸣 (mournful cry), its light rapidly dimming.

He himself also suffered a strong backlash and lock-on from the Underworld, letting out a muffled groan. His protective Sword Soul spun frantically, resisting the falling Purple-Black Thunder and the pulling force of the vortex below, his figure unsteady and狼狈 (embarrassed).

White-Haired Zhenjun's face changed drastically.

He didn't expect Xu Yunfan to be so decisive and ruthless, daring to directly ignite the power of the极阴 (Extreme Yin) Underworld.

His secret technique of reversing life and death was most afraid of suffering chaotic backlash from such violent heaven and earth origin energy.

The怨魂锁链 (Soul-Resentment Chains) shattered and dissipated inch by inch under the impact of the thunder and blood waves.

The protective light halo of life and death fluctuated violently, struck by several Purple-Black Thunders. Although it barely held, its brilliance was noticeably dimmer, and a trace of solemnity and pain第一次 (appeared for the first time) on his妖异俊美 (demonic and handsome) face.

If it had been the clone Wukong handling the situation, the limitations of his vision would naturally have prevented him from doing this to such an extent.

But who told Xu Yunfan to be able to transmit supreme Yang法力 (mana) through the attribute panel, using it as a foundation to cause such earth-shattering destruction?

Even Wukong couldn't help but suck in a breath of cold air upon seeing this, the anger in his chest subsiding a little.

Xu Yunfan's move was simply too crazy.

“Bastard!”

White-Haired Zhenjun roared, trying to stabilize his figure and lock onto Wukong's figure, who was trying to use the shockwave of the explosion to escape in the chaos.

And Wukong, controlled by Xu Yunfan, at the moment his fists slammed out, used the反作用力 (counterforce) of the explosion to push the石胎 (Stone Embryo) body's toughness to the limit. Like a projectile thrown by a catapult, he硬扛 (hardly bore) part of the explosion's aftermath and scattered Purple-Black Thunders, frantically fleeing into the depths of the gray mist, away from the Underworld direction.

The surface of the Stone Embryo was scorched black by the雷火 (Thunder and Fire), covered in cracks, and the light of玄鉴 (Xuan Jian) was also much dimmer, but his speed was惊人 (astonishingly) fast.

“Where do you think you're going!”

Tong Xuan Zhenjun forcibly scattered several Purple-Black Thunders, disregarding the cost, transforming into a sharp sword light, and急追 (chased urgently) in the direction Wukong was fleeing.

The璇枢剑魄 (Xuanshu Sword Soul) granted him a speed far beyond reason even in the Underworld.

Golden Core entering and exiting the青冥 (Azure Void) was not just something said casually, but done effortlessly.

White-Haired Zhenjun's eyes were阴沉 (gloomy) enough to drip water. Looking at the一片狼藉 (devastated) scene of thunder and blood waves raging, and the direction Tong Xuan had chased off to, he let out a cold snort.

“Run? Having entered this sea, how can you run! Wait for me to first收了 (collect) this backlash power, then I'll play with you properly.”

He didn't rush to chase, but instead结印 (formed seals), the life and death light halo around him flaring up, beginning to try and guide and absorb those violent Purple-Black Thunders and chaotic death aura and resentment, seemingly wanting to convert them into his own power.

Rolling Purple-Black smoke surrounded him, his methods诡异 (bizarre), his cultivation method邪门 (evil),令人胆寒 (making one's blood run cold).

In the depths of the gray mist, Wukong flew rapidly under Xu Yunfan's strong control, his熔金瞳孔 (molten gold pupils) scanning the pursuing Tong Xuan sword light behind him, and the terrifying life and death vortex further away.

The法力 (mana) inside the Stone Embryo burned frantically under Xu Yunfan's will drive.

“Xu Yunfan, this won't do! The Stone Embryo can't hold on much longer, the mana is almost exhausted! That madman behind is chasing too closely!”

Wukong roared in his mind, carrying a hint of instinctual fear.

Although he was arrogant, facing such a desperate situation, he also felt powerless.

A Zhenjun chasing to kill, no Foundation Establishment cultivator would want to face that.

“Just keep going forward, I have plenty of mana.”

Xu Yunfan's voice remained steady,透着 (revealing) a前所未有的 (unprecedented) focus, the Divine Dawn mana continuously transmitting into Wukong's body.

Although he was in a soul state, having first融了 (fused with) the Stone Embryo with Xu Yunfan and being born a divine being, he could naturally withstand Xu Yunfan's Divine Dawn mana. This was also why Xu Yunfan chose Wukong's true soul as the first choice.

On the Divine Dawn Mountain main body, he sat cross-legged on the cloud platform, surrounded by Purple-Gold雷光 (thunder light), but his gaze wasn't looking at the大殿 (Great Hall), but rather what Wukong's perspective was seeing—the rapidly passing scenes of gray darkness and stillness.

He formed hand seals, the Dharma Form moved with him, the right head of the临字态 (Lin Character State) continuously推演 (deducing) and analyzing the Underworld environment data fed back by Wukong, searching for the Grand Yin extreme location.

Wukong naturally knew what Xu Yunfan wanted to do, so he didn't say anything more, just letting Xu Yunfan control his body, constantly changing direction, pursuing the source of the extreme Yin.

Suddenly, Wukong, flying rapidly, suddenly凝固 (froze) his molten gold pupils.

The rolling gray mist ahead had become somewhat thinner. At the end of his vision, the scene became incredibly bizarre and spectacular.

In the center of a relatively calm blood-red sea surface, stood a huge island built of森森 (bleaching) white bones.

The shape of the island was vaguely like a巨龙 (giant dragon) with嶙峋 bones coiled up.

And at the龙首 (dragon head) position, the highest point of the white bone island, a晶莹剔透 (crystal clear), like墨玉 (black jade) carved, twisted怪树 (strange tree) took root.
