# Chapter 155: Projection to the Mortal Realm (Combined)

Dark, crisscrossing spatial rifts slowly reflected in Zhang Jing's stunned eyes.

He swallowed nervously.

And this was just a pseudo-version of the Primordial Immortal Light—its power was absurdly exaggerated.

After all, this was a cave realm created by his master—

Wait!

Only now did Zhang Jing realize what he had just done.

An awkward smile immediately appeared on his face.

With a thought, the grayish pseudo-Primordial Immortal Light dispersed into thirty-six strands of Dao Intent, and the elemental energies preventing spatial healing began to fade.

Deep within the cave realm, inside a bronze palace that stabilized a section of the void, two figures sitting opposite each other suddenly turned their gazes toward one another, their eyes filled with disbelief.

"That was—"

"Primordial Immortal Light that hasn't yet fused with the Taishi Dao Intent? No, no—that thing wasn't Primordial Immortal Light at all. There's never been such a thing. It was purely that little guy forcibly piecing together thirty-six types of Dao Intent to form 'immortal light'!"

"His comprehension and control of Dao Intent has reached such a level!" The bird-faced Dao Body's voice was almost incoherent.

"Not a divine ability, yet surpassing one. This power... could it be stronger than ordinary divine abilities? If an ordinary Golden Core cultivator were struck by that light, they'd likely perish instantly."

Opposite the bird-faced Dao Body, the vine-covered Dao Body remained silent for a moment before suddenly bursting into hearty laughter.

"Excellent, excellent! Hahaha! It seems Zhang Jing's talent in the path of world derivation in the Taishi Primordial Realm surpasses even that of Dao Lord Yuanchen. Once he returns from the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, the main body should be back as well. We can then formally hold the apprenticeship ceremony. What do you think, Dao Brother?"

"Most excellent!" the bird-faced Dao Body agreed.

Then, as if realizing something, he chuckled, "Tsk, we should remind the little guy to visit the Taichu Law Manifestation Secret Realm. This technique should be compiled into a manual—the Dao Repository Secret Realm will have to pay dearly for it. Moreover, every disciple who cultivates this technique in the future must contribute a portion of their fortune to him."

Unexpectedly, the vine-covered Dao Body responded with a strange tone, "The prerequisite for cultivating this technique is mastery of thirty-six perfected Dao Intents. Dao Brother, how many among the Taiyi Dao Sect's Foundation Establishment and Golden Core disciples do you think can achieve that?"

"This..." The bird-faced Dao Body's smile froze abruptly.

Time passed slowly.

In the ancient palace at the center of the immortal island, Zhang Jing, who had been meditating, suddenly opened his eyes.

A trace of unease flashed through his gaze.

For some reason, he had been feeling restless all day, as if he were about to lose something.

This feeling seemed to originate from the depths of his bloodline.

As if realizing something, a complicated expression appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

His gaze lowered, as if trying to pierce through layers of void and celestial realms, through the barriers of wind and thunder, to look down at the mortal realm of Juntian Domain.

To look at Nanli!

"Right, it's been thirty years since I last went into seclusion. Apart from certain special secret realms, time flows the same everywhere in the Xuanyuan Realm. That means... is it Father or Mother?"

Zhang Jing sighed involuntarily.

He stretched out his hand, and a small white jade bottle appeared in his palm, containing twenty-seven drops of Life-Returning Elixir.

"I hope it can help them," Zhang Jing thought with hope.

Not long after, he called out, "Thirty-Eight, I'll be leaving for a while. Take care of the immortal island in my absence."

His voice reached the ears of Deer Thirty-Eight not far outside.

Without waiting for a response, the Chaos Dao Mark between Zhang Jing's eyebrows slowly appeared, instantly connecting to the vast and majestic Radiance Immortal Realm.

In a flash, he found himself in a familiar room.

At his will, a line of text appeared before him:

**[Zhang Jing (Disciple of the Chiming Taihao Cave Realm): 6,740,000 Fortune]**

"Fortunately, during these thirty years of seclusion, aside from purchasing Dao Intent to comprehend, I haven't bought anything else. Otherwise, I might not have had enough fortune to project myself to the mortal realm this time," Zhang Jing thought with relief.

Then, his mind connected to the Radiance Immortal Realm once more.

"Teleport to the Nine Heavens Immortal Gate!"

In the mortal realm, Juntian Domain, Nanli Kingdom.

About two hundred li from the Dragon Lake Dao Academy stood a majestic city spanning eighty li, named Xingluo City.

The city housed nearly all the noble and prominent families of Nanli.

From the imperial family to regional officials' families, and even major immortal cultivation clans—all had estates and businesses in Xingluo City.

Luxurious mansions with vermilion gates, green bricks, and black tiles shimmered under the sun, exuding boundless prosperity.

Early morning, usually the liveliest time of day.

Yet today, Xingluo City was unusually quiet.

A solemn atmosphere quietly spread.

In the distance, streaks of rainbow light and flying rays crossed the sky, swiftly descending upon a sprawling estate at the city's center.

---

In an inn somewhere in the city, a man in white robes stared blankly out the window at the continuous streams of rainbow light, oblivious to the tea spilling from his cup.

Opposite him, a woman in a red dress, exuding a heroic aura, exclaimed excitedly, "Senior Brother, those lights are so beautiful!"

The man immediately snapped out of his daze and covered her mouth in panic. "Junior Sister, those are immortal elders! Don't speak carelessly. If any of them happens to be in a bad mood, we're done for."

The woman struggled free and pouted indignantly. "Senior Brother, you're lying again. How could over three hundred immortal elders have entered that estate in such a short time? Even if you said those were spells, it'd be more believable."

The man couldn't help but feel a flicker of doubt. Yet those rainbow lights were unmistakably from immortal elders!

"Could something major have happened in Xingluo City?" Unease crept into his heart.

He softly called over the inn attendant and asked, "Brother Attendant, may I ask—" He pointed at the streaks of light still crossing the sky outside.

"Shh!" The attendant immediately gestured for silence, then whispered, "You two must have just arrived in Xingluo City today. The matriarch of the Zhang Clan is nearing her end. Those immortal elders have come for her. Many arrived yesterday as well."

"Brother Attendant, is the Zhang matriarch also an immortal elder? Why would she live in a mortal city?" the man asked curiously.

"Madam Zhang isn't an immortal elder—she's a mortal like us. I've even spoken to her before. Ah... what a pity." The attendant shook his head regretfully.

"So many immortal elders, all for a mere mortal—" the woman began incredulously, only to be cut off by the attendant.

"Be careful with your words, guests. Rumor has it the Zhang Clan's eldest young master is a True Immortal residing in the immortal realm. Isn't it natural for these immortal elders to come to pay respects or offer help?"

"True Immortal! The immortal realm!" The man and woman at the table widened their eyes in shock.

---

Meanwhile, the usually quiet Zhang residence was even more hushed today, with faint sobbing sounds audible.

In the courtyard stood dozens of inner academy disciples, led by Liu Lizhi of the Inheritance Pavilion and Yang Bai of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, their divine senses continuously active.

Among them was Ji Bochang, clad in purple robes, inconspicuous amidst the crowd.

At the forefront, Liu Lizhi asked Yang Bai, who had just emerged from a room, "Senior Brother Yang, has the Academy Head seen her? What did he say?"

Yang Bai shook his head silently.

Sighing, Liu Lizhi asked again, "What about the old master? Is he alright?"

In terms of age, most of them were older than Zhang Jing's father. Yet they habitually referred to him as "old master"—partly out of respect for Zhang Fan and Zhang Nianjing, and partly because... well, some things went without saying.

"Old Master is fine. Junior Brother Zhang Fan is with him," Yang Bai replied.

"That's good."

---

In the inner hall, within an elegantly decorated room, Zhang Jing's mother lay motionless on the bed, her silver hair disheveled, her face deeply wrinkled and gaunt. Her life force flickered like a candle in the wind, on the verge of extinguishing at any moment.

Outside the door, the Academy Head helplessly helped a young woman kneeling before him to her feet and sighed, "Nianjing, it's not that I'm unwilling to help, but your mother has reached the end of her natural lifespan. There's nothing I can do. This is heaven's will—it cannot be defied."

"Master, is there really no way? Nianjing can't bear to lose Mother," Zhang Nianjing pleaded, lifting her head to reveal a delicate face bearing some resemblance to Zhang Jing's. Though not stunningly beautiful, she carried an innate grace like an orchid in a secluded valley.

The Academy Head's eyes flickered with complexity. Every time he saw his beloved disciple, he couldn't help but recall her elder brother—Zhang Jing. That terrifyingly prodigious talent in the Dao was something he still couldn't forget even decades later. Though Zhang Nianjing's talent was also considerable, compared to her brother, it was like fireflies to the moon.

In fact, the Academy Head had often wondered if Zhang Jing might be the reincarnation of some immortal deity—otherwise, such talent was simply inexplicable.

"Master~" Zhang Nianjing, her eyes red, tugged at the Academy Head's sleeve.

Snapping out of his thoughts, the Academy Head hesitated before saying, "Perhaps your elder brother has a way, but—"

"Elder brother?" Zhang Nianjing unconsciously repeated the name—familiar yet distant.

She had no memories of this elder brother. Though her mother often said that Zhang Jing had loved holding her as a child, she couldn't recall a single instance. She and her younger brother must have been too young then.

She knew both her name and her brother Zhang Fan's were connected to that elder brother.

Clasping her hands together, Zhang Nianjing prayed sincerely, "Elder Brother, you're an immortal in the heavens. You must be able to hear Nianjing's prayer. Mother is dying—can you save her? Nianjing can't bear to lose her. And... did you know? Even when barely conscious, Mother kept calling your name. Though she said 'Jing'er,' Nianjing knows she wasn't calling for me."

Perhaps her prayer worked.

The sky outside suddenly darkened.

The next moment, a figure enveloped in radiant light appeared not far before Zhang Nianjing. As the light dissipated, Zhang Jing's form was revealed.

Seeing this, the Academy Head nearby rubbed his eyes in disbelief, wondering if he was hallucinating.

After confirming, he exclaimed excitedly, "Zhang Jing?"

"Academy Head, it's been a while," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.

"You—" The Academy Head gestured alternately at the sky, the ground, and then toward Zhang Jing's mother's room, momentarily at a loss for words.

"Academy Head, this body is just a projection. My true self can't descend yet," Zhang Jing explained, anticipating the question.

Meanwhile, Zhang Nianjing stared blankly at the figure before her, her mind empty.

Her master's address confirmed it—this man who had suddenly appeared was the elder brother she'd heard about since childhood.

In that instant, Zhang Nianjing felt as if she'd finally gained a true pillar of support. Tears streamed down her cheeks uncontrollably.

"Elder Brother... can you save Mother?"

Zhang Jing turned toward the voice.

With one glance, he recognized the weeping woman as the little sister who had once loved curling up in his arms, gazing at the stars and sunset with wide, bright eyes.

A gentle smile touched the corners of his eyes.

"Nianjing has grown into a fine lady. Last time I saw you, you were only this big," Zhang Jing said, gesturing with his hands.

"Elder Brother!" Zhang Nianjing's tears turned to bashful indignation as she stomped her foot playfully.

For some reason, though this was her first time meeting Zhang Jing, she felt an instinctive, complete relaxation in his presence.

---

Soon, by his mother's bedside, Zhang Jing extended his left hand. Immortal light coalesced, forming an exquisite white jade bottle.

Taking a deep breath, the bottle's lid vanished silently, and a drop of Life-Returning Elixir—resembling a pearl and shimmering with verdant light—floated out.

Under Zhang Jing's control, the drop merged into his mother's forehead.

Instantly, emerald immortal light enveloped her.

"The Life-Returning Elixir works even on mortals from the incomplete Dao mortal realm!" Zhang Jing thought excitedly, his heart finally at ease.

Several more drops flew from the bottle into his mother's body, causing the emerald light to brighten exponentially.

Behind him stood the Academy Head, various pavilion masters, his white-haired father, Zhang Nianjing, Zhang Fan, and others—all watching silently, not daring to breathe.

Yet as the emerald light around his mother gradually faded, identical looks of astonishment appeared on everyone's faces.
