# Chapter 31: Promotion to Class C, A Great Victory!

The competition was divided into three rounds, corresponding to Class A, B, and C. The competition for Class D guards began first.

"The rules for this competition are simple," Pang Long said. "Whoever wins seven consecutive matches will become a Class C guard!"

Pang Long sat inside a temporary tent. It was snowing heavily outside, a vast expanse of white. Beside him, a stove kept him warm, and a cup of hot tea sat within reach. He looked quite at ease.

After stating the rules, he took a sip of the hot tea. This was "Kung Fu Tea" gifted by the Madam, which helped to soothe the muscles and bones, as well as detoxify and nourish the Qi.

The Madam had said he was already at the "Half-step Essence Consuming" realm, a critical moment. She was very considerate of him, often inquiring about his physical condition and offering guidance.

Before him was a wide, flat ground with a擂台 (arena) set up.

To the right side of the arena stood over forty people, all of whom were Class D guards participating in the competition.

Li Xian was among them.

"Each match will be arranged by me. Those I call, step up to the arena immediately."

"Do any of you have any objections to these rules?"

Pang Long set down his tea cup and swept his gaze over the crowd.

"None," the crowd replied in unison.

"Commander Pang is the most familiar with the strength of every guard. It is indeed most appropriate for him to arrange the opponents."

Based on Li Xian's understanding of Pang Long, with him presiding, there shouldn't be any tricks. After all, one must rely on their own strength. As long as one possesses true ability, everything else is illusory.

"The competition begins. First group, Gao Xiong versus Zhang Wai."

As the voice fell, a shout of "Alright!" was heard. A figure from the crowd leaped onto the stage. The lightness of his body was a sight to behold.

This was Zhang Wai, a guard for three years, proficient in the "Lian Jiang Tui" (Connected River Leg) technique.

The man named Gao Xiong, on the other hand, walked up to the stage. After a simple exchange of salutes, the two began their duel.

Zhang Wai kicked out first, but his ankle was caught by his opponent, who then swung him with force.

He flew out of the arena, sliding several zhangs away, carving a trench in the snow. He couldn't get back up.

"This person is incredibly strong," Li Xian thought, his brow furrowing with a newfound caution.

He then thought, "According to the rules, one needs to win seven consecutive matches. Although there are forty participants, the probability of encountering this person in the fifth, sixth, or seventh match is extremely high!"

He kept this in mind but remained calm.

"Gao Xiong wins!"

Pang Long looked at his list, pondered for a moment, and called out two more names.

One after another, people went up to the arena. The winners stayed, while the losers went to stand outside. After several matches, the number of people had significantly decreased.

It wasn't until the fourth match that Li Xian's name was called. Relying on his Four Directions Fist, he easily secured a victory.

"Good lad, his strength is indeed formidable," Pang Long said, a look of admiration in his eyes.

After the first round, those qualified to compete for the Class C guard position had mostly emerged.

Including Li Xian, there were a total of eight. They were all aware of each other now, sizing one another up and making silent comparisons.

"Li Xian versus Ye Qing!"

After Li Xian had won four consecutive matches, Pang Long called his name again.

This time, his opponent was a veteran guard of seven years, who had mastered seven martial arts techniques. He was one of the formidable opponents Pang Long had mentioned.

"Apologies!"

The two met on the arena, exchanged salutes, and immediately launched a fierce attack.

It was a truly intense battle. Ye Qing had practiced the "Open-Close Palm," "Flying Flower Hand," "Four Directions Fist," and "Coiling Ground Leg," among other techniques. Although he had only reached the level of proficiency, the internal energy accumulated from these multiple arts was quite impressive.

Seeing that Li Xian also knew the Four Directions Fist, he used it first to probe, also with the intention of overpowering him to determine the victor.

"This man is reckless, brave but lacking in finesse," Li Xian assessed internally after a few exchanges.

Ye Qing fought for a few moves with his fist technique, realized he couldn't beat Li Xian in this area, and immediately changed his style, switching to the Open-Close Palm.

This palm technique emphasized wide and forceful movements, and when combined with his internal strength, if he had used it from the start, he could have overwhelmed Li Xian.

But he had started with the Four Directions Fist, fighting Li Xian head-on. This allowed Li Xian to fully grasp his fighting style. By the time he switched techniques, Li Xian was already on guard.

Li Xian's natural fist techniques pressed in, preventing Ye Qing's "Open-Close Palm" from being fully unleashed.

The fight became very frustrating for him. The Open-Close Palm wasn't "open" or "close," its power reduced to less than a tenth. Ye Qing grew agitated. Seeing the palm technique was ineffective, he immediately switched to the "Coiling Ground Leg."

This, however, exposed a flaw. The moment he switched techniques, Li Xian's fists shot out together, kicking up a flurry of snow. In the blink of an eye, the two fists seemed to become four...

Ye Qing hurriedly tried to block, but couldn't tell the real from the fake.

*Bang!*

He was sent flying out of the arena. Li Xian cupped his fists in salute, declaring his victory.

"Ye Qing's internal energy is indeed powerful, but unfortunately, he couldn't bring out his advantages," Li Xian thought.

This battle filled Li Xian with even more confidence. "It seems these veteran guards aren't that rich in combat experience either. Even if my foundation is lacking, I have plenty of room to maneuver."

After this fight, Li Xian had won five matches.

His sixth match was against Gao Xiong. This man was a true powerhouse, much more troublesome than Ye Qing. He was born with immense strength. His movements seemed clumsy, but they were actually very difficult to defend against.

He had mastered three martial arts: one external skill, "Vajra Art," and two grappling techniques, "Dragon Catching Hand" and "Crane Catching Hand." The Vajra Art focused on "external strength," brutalizing the body and strengthening the physique. The "Dragon Catching Hand" and "Crane Catching Hand" were both designed for capturing and restraining.

It was clear his path was to seize the opponent's limbs and then use his immense strength to win. His goal wasn't to defeat the opponent with superior martial arts, but to throw them off the arena.

Li Xian first used his Four Directions Fist to create illusions, making it difficult for Gao Xiong to distinguish real from fake punches. Naturally, it was extremely difficult for him to reach out and grab.

After several attempts, Gao Xiong grew increasingly frustrated.

Then, Li Xian suddenly unleashed the powerful and fierce "Bull Fist."

He fluidly switched between the two fist techniques. Finally, he landed a punch on Gao Xiong's face and secured another victory.

"Impressive!" Pang Long nodded repeatedly.

In these several matches, Li Xian had both advantages and disadvantages, but he did his best to avoid his weaknesses and leverage his strengths. He won cleanly and beautifully.

This might seem simple, but it wasn't.

Pang Long had practiced fist techniques in his youth and knew that fists were fierce and powerful. When a fist was thrown, it relied entirely on one's instinctive reaction to the enemy.

By middle age, his fist technique had advanced further. When throwing a punch, he knew how to hold back and conserve strength, becoming more at ease.

It was only then that he gradually began to incorporate "thought" into his fist techniques. He learned to analyze the pros and cons and how to cleverly achieve victory in battle.

To be able to do this was enough to overcome a stronger opponent with a weaker one.

"This kid... I wasn't wrong about him. He really is very perceptive," Pang Long thought, now certain that one of the three spots would go to Li Xian.

Li Xian's final opponent was far inferior to Ye Qing and Gao Xiong.

He successfully secured the victory.

Pang Long announced, "In this guard competition, the first to be promoted to Class C guard is..."

"Li Xian!"

As his voice fell, all the guards present looked at Li Xian with envy.

"This Li Xian is truly a beast. He's been here for less than a month and has already become a Class C guard. This has never happened before!"

"He already had a foundation in martial arts. His Four Directions Fist is incredibly powerful, so it's not surprising he won."

"A Class C guard... I dream of becoming one."

"To become a Class C guard at such a young age, his future is truly limitless!"

A commotion rose from the crowd.

"Li Xian, since you've won, come inside and sit for a while. Come warm yourself by the fire," Pang Long called out to him.

"Alright."

Li Xian quickly ran into the tent, shook the snow off his body, and let out a soft breath.

From today on, he had taken another step forward, crossed another threshold, and was now a Class C guard!
