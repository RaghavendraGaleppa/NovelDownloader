# Chapter 216: Old Profession

“Lead the way ahead.”
“Yes!”

Chu Mo bowed slightly to acknowledge the order, then straightened up and glanced at Qin Lie, who was standing silently to the side. A hint of mockery crossed his face as he turned and led the White Robed Prince toward the back mountain of the Divine Weapon Ridge.

The White Robed Prince glanced sideways at Qin Lie, who hadn't moved yet, and said indifferently, “Nephew, what is that thing anyway? I will take you back to Great Qian. You can take a new wife and have children again. With the status and position I grant you, you will naturally be able to spread your branches and leaves.”

Qin Lie was silent for a moment before responding in a low voice.
“Yes, thank you, Your Highness!”

Back Mountain of the Divine Weapon Ridge.

In a mountain hollow, there was a patch of sky about thirty zhang in diameter, shaped like a funnel. At the very bottom, a three-zhang-wide gap split open, surrounded by grayish-white mountain rocks jagged like dog's teeth. A thousand years of rainwater had washed the stone edges, giving them a bronze-like green rust color.

Xu Yunfan was still carrying the unconscious Zhan Yan. He took out the silk cloth Lu Cheng had given him from his怀里 and carefully considered it.

Possessing mining skills, the characteristics of "Dragon Seeking and Vein Distinguishing" and "Mine Probing and Land Surveying" allowed the trends of mountains and rivers to be laid out clearly before his eyes. He naturally knew that the funnel-shaped gap below was extremely deep.

The Divine Weapon Ridge had a habit of utilizing magma geothermal fire. Only by using the attributes of earth fire could divine weapons and sharp blades be forged. This secret passage was not just an escape route; it was also a place for casting weapons.

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. Carrying Zhan Yan, he immediately leaped down, falling into the pit and rushing into the gap. This startled dozens of hanging Nightlight Bats, the flapping of the bat swarm's wings echoing with a hollow sound in the hundred-zhang-deep pit walls.

He descended nearly a hundred zhang before finally landing.

The moss at the bottom of the pit emitted a strange blue light, and with every step, it squeezed out a purple-green juice.

The entrance to the cave was like a giant mouth pried open by stalactites. Half of the artificially carved steps were embedded in the natural rock strata. Iron ferns grew in the crevices of the steps, their leaves covered in ash from furnaces of unknown dynasties.

The secret passage was initially so narrow that one had to walk sideways. Xu Yunfan's back scraped against the uneven rock walls, his blue robe stained with dark red stone powder—this was the特有的 red iron ore dust of the Divine Weapon Ridge.

After turning three natural corners, the cave suddenly opened up like the belly of a giant python. The ceiling hung down dozens of stalactites as thick as a person could embrace. Water droplets dripping from the tips of the stones reflected the light under Xu Yunfan's reverse grip on the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. As he exerted his strength to activate it, Thunderfire was born from the hammer head, illuminating the firelight. Under the illumination, these stalactites actually shimmered with a golden-red color like molten iron.

The accumulated water on the ground reached his ankles. As Xu Yunfan waded through the water, he suddenly realized that the bottom was paved with neat blue bricks.

Several blind white fish swam through the cracks in the bricks, their scales reflecting a cold light that illuminated the abrupt chisel marks on the left rock wall.

These were likely the marks left by the craftsmen of the Divine Weapon Ridge a thousand years ago using pickaxes to clear a path, forming a stark contrast with the ripple patterns eroded by water on the right.

The further he went in, the stronger the smell of sulfur became, and the surrounding heat grew more intense. Unconsciously, the ambient temperature reached over fifty degrees Celsius.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. To him, this bit of dry heat was no different from a warm breeze.

Turning a corner of a tunnel, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer suddenly illuminated the path ahead, revealing that it was blocked.

The secret passage ahead had collapsed, blocked tightly by countless huge stones.

He untied his belt to bind the unconscious Zhan Yan, stepped forward to check, and immediately understood that there must be a path behind it.

This collapsed tunnel had likely experienced at least thirty years of time, probably an accident from when the Divine Weapon Ridge was smashed down back then.

Xu Yunfan tapped the rock wall with his fingers, the sound like striking a chime, a dull and loud noise.

His fingertips traced the unique dark red patterns of the red iron ore vein, then suddenly paused. He abruptly inserted his fingers into the gap in the basalt layer.

The Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength surged from his knuckles into the rock. The hard rock layer instantly cracked with spider-web-like fissures. Under the Steel Body of a Hundred Forgings, he didn't need any pickaxe; his fingers were as hard as refined steel.

Rock powder rustled down, his ten fingers flying like a mountain-drilling, armor-piercing beast.

The blue-black basalt turned into coarse sand under his fingers, mixed with sulfur crystals that rustled down.

Suddenly, he touched a section of soft, interlayered soil, long soaked by groundwater until it was as rotten as spoiled cheese.

Xu Yunfan顺势 changed his fingers into a claw, his tiger's mouth gripping the edge of the collapsed stone and exerting force. A hundred-pound boulder was moved behind him as easily as placing a piece on a chessboard.

He advanced almost as easily as a normal person taking three steps. Until the three-hundredth step, he suddenly encountered a water line. When his finger锋 broke through the slippery mudstone, the airflow caused by his palm wind awakened the cave-dwelling blind snakes.

These snow-white creatures shot out from the stone crevices. As their scales brushed against Xu Yunfan's wrist, he反手捏住 their seven-inch points and threw them like darts.

When the snake bodies struck a certain hollow rock plate, the echo revealed a unique hum of the Nine Winding Earth Veins.

"Direction of the Dog Hour (7:15 PM) mark."

Xu Yunfan silently recited the secrets of mining and dragon seeking. The middle finger of his right hand, surging with blood energy, suddenly grew three inches, the knuckle bulging like a Vajra pestle.

This move, "Drilling Earth Dragon," broke through the last half-foot of rock layer. A scorching airflow, carrying sparks, rushed at his face.

He turned his face away to avoid the gushing sulfur smoke. A fire starter illuminated a piece of scorched cloth stuck in the rock crevice. The pattern was clearly the brocade pattern produced by the Thirteen Docks of Cangzhou.

The end of the collapsed zone suddenly opened up. Xu Yunfan flicked his finger to shake off the rock dust from his temples.

Zhan Yan, being dragged behind, suddenly let out a muffled groan. It turned out a piece of angular white quartz had pierced his shoulder blade. The stone surface was stained with specks of verdigris, traces left by the long-term friction of bronze artifacts.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. Zhan Yan's body was trained in hard external skills, so this bit of damage naturally wasn't much. He crushed the quartz and took a sniff. Surprisingly, the powder was mixed with half a tael of fine iron powder, which shone with a cold blue light under the firelight.

Carrying Zhan Yan for dozens more steps, the path ahead suddenly showed signs of artificial repair. The walls on both sides were left with neat pickaxe chisel marks, and the ground was scattered with wooden stakes that had weathered away completely.

Xu Yunfan's boot tip kicked a half-section of a bronze bolt, and his eyebrows couldn't help but raise slightly.

Bellows.

Compared to the bellows developed by the Mechanism Hall and the Heavenly Craft Department in the Heavenly Work Cave, this was far too crude.

Following the tunnel ahead for a winding distance, Xu Yunfan suddenly stopped. His boot sole crushed the quartz fragments on the ground. Under the stimulation of his strength, the hammer head burst forth with a ray of firelight, illuminating twelve forks spreading out like a spider web.

Each tunnel entrance was embedded with different rock layers.

The third one from the left had malachite green spots, and the fifth one was dripping with stalactites formed from congealed red iron ore slurry.

He tapped the central rock pillar with his fingers. The sound waves refracted seven different echoes through the holes.

The sulfur smell suddenly turned fishy at the ninth fork. That was the toxic miasma produced when the earth fire was about to die out.

His fingertips brushed past the wall of the third fork, touching the unique fish-scale chisel marks of the Five Dynasties craftsmen. However, embedded in the gaps were newly fallen fine iron slag, clearly indicating this tunnel was still in use in recent years.

"Kan Water, Li Fire..."

Xu Yunfan bent down and pressed his ear to the ground, hearing three faint sounds of water among the twelve earth veins.

"Take the leftmost one."

Zhan Yan's faint voice sounded at this moment.

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted. He looked down at Zhan Yan with immense surprise and joy.

"Master, you're awake?"

Zhan Yan exhaled a breath, struggling to break free from Xu Yunfan's grasp and barely managing to stand up against the wall.

His expression was somewhat strange.
"I won't die. What did you feed me earlier?"
