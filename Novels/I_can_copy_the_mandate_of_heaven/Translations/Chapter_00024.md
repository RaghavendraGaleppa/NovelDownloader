## Chapter 24: Sealed Lips

"What's wrong, you tell me!" Li Zhiming was on edge, watching Han Li's behavior. He glanced at the entrance of the stone room, though it was a rarely visited place, Li Zhiming couldn't shake off the feeling that their master wouldn't leave the valley now, not with so many severely injured disciples lying around.

Despite his intuition telling him that their master, Mo Daren, was busy and couldn't leave, Li Zhiming still felt a sense of unease. He kept looking at the entrance, his eyes darting back and forth.

Han Li suddenly closed a book and then reopened it to a specific page, carefully reattaching a thin silver thread. "What's going on?" Li Zhiming asked, feeling a bit foolish.

"Nothing," Han Li replied, shaking his head and forcing a smile. "I think we're done here. Let's go."

Li Zhiming was not convinced. "What's going on? You found something, didn't you? Tell me!"

Han Li turned around, and for a moment, Li Zhiming saw a flash of sadness on his face. But then, Han Li's expression changed back to his usual, somewhat goofy look. He carefully put the book back on the shelf, making sure everything looked perfect.

As they left the stone room, Li Zhiming couldn't help but ask, "What did you see? Tell me!"

Han Li remained silent, "Just some nonsensical papers. Don't worry about it."

Li Zhiming wasn't buying it. He knew that their master wouldn't go through such great lengths to hide useless papers. As they walked, Han Li carefully erased their footprints, and Li Zhiming followed, still trying to pry the truth out of him.

Once they were back in the woods, Han Li quickly changed into a new pair of shoes, and Li Zhiming pinned him to the ground. "Tell me, what did you see?" Li Zhiming demanded.

Han Li looked at him with a somber expression, "I told you, there's nothing. Maybe it's just my paranoia, but I think our master's secret might be related to those papers. Let's just forget we saw anything."

Li Zhiming let Han Li up, still feeling uneasy. When they returned to the valley, it was already afternoon, and both of them were on edge. They hesitated at the entrance, neither wanting to go in first.

"Let's do this," Li Zhiming whispered, "If anything happens, make sure to bury me properly."

As they entered the medicinal valley, Li Zhiming was met with a gruesome sight: many injured disciples, some screaming in pain, others calm and bandaged. The air was thick with the smell of blood. Despite having seen this before, Li Zhiming still felt a shiver run down his spine.

Mo Daren, their master, was busy tending to a wounded disciple, covered in blood. He glanced up, saw the two of them standing there, and simply said, "Come help!" before turning back to his work, seemingly unconcerned.
