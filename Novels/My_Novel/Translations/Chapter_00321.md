Chapter 321: The Arrival of Gu Nianjun, a Fit of Jealousy, and the Great Self Beyond the Pinnacle

Beneath the flowers and under the moon, the red candle had long been extinguished. The proficiency of the third layer gradually accumulated. The next morning, the wind and snow faded away. Cold branches and red flowers were draped in snow, while roof tiles and eaves hung with frost. All was silent and serene.

In the spacious chamber, Li Xian practiced his swordplay to his heart's content. The day before, the dual swords had merged, and the first, second, and third layers had all been初步 integrated. However, it had been somewhat hasty. Now, alone in his room, he was even more uninhibited.

All the accumulated emotions, desires, hatred, and grievances were poured into this sword art. He was so engrossed he forgot himself, deaf to the outside world. In a flash, dawn broke.

Although Little Bun was young, she was naturally clever. She handled all the affairs of the Azure Fragrance Pavilion, big and small. Last night, the wind and snow had been heavy, so in the morning, she needed to order people to clear the snow and tidy the courtyard.

Little Bun called over the staff from the "Delicacy Tower" and paid them to clear the snow and organize the courtyard. She warned them, "Before you enter the courtyard, you must plug your ears and lower your heads. Remember, do not look up or wander your eyes. The flowers and plants here possess immense power. You are poor and of lowly status. If you carelessly look at them, at best you will be confused and faint on the spot; at worst, cold wind will enter your body and heat will scorch you, leading to a severe illness. In the worst-case scenario, you will die on the spot."

The staff took cotton balls, plugged their ears, and sealed them with wax. They kept their heads low as they entered the pavilion to clean. They swept the snow from the corridors and trimmed the stray branches and leaves...

Little Bun couldn't help but complain, "As soon as that Young Master Li arrives, the Mistress's Azure Fragrance Pavilion won't be able to hold another woman. In the past, it was the maids who swept the snow and cleared the mud; now it's all these staff. These staff are not as meticulous as the maids. Alas... if they do a sloppy job, it's me who will be punished and scolded."

She was about half a person tall with a bun-like face. Hands on her hips, she scolded the staff for a long time. Seeing that no one paid her any attention, she grew furious. Just as she was about to raise her voice, she suddenly remembered that all the staff had their ears stuffed with cotton and sealed with wax; they couldn't hear her scolding at all.

Feeling utterly bored, she heard the yellow orioles on the roof chirping beautifully, their voices clear and bright. She said, "Little oriole, little oriole, if you were a woman, the Mistress would have driven you away too. If I weren't so young, I probably wouldn't be allowed to stay either."

Her face was full of curiosity. "Last night, I happened to pass by that bedroom. I wonder what they were playing at; they were crying out so joyfully."

She leaned against the wall, teasing the orioles. The staff, with their heads lowered and ears plugged, focused solely on sweeping the snow and clearing the debris. They passed by the side bedroom, completely unaware of the enchanting sounds coming from inside, where a great pleasure was taking place.

At noon, Li Xian held his green sword in the outer hall, practicing his swordplay and savoring its lingering charm. He felt secretly proud and thought, "In terms of knowledge, experience, martial arts, cultivation, and wealth... I am far inferior to the Mistress and need to improve. But there is one area where I far surpass her. In this aspect, she has already been utterly defeated. No matter how powerful or arrogant she is in daily life, in this aspect, she can only beg for mercy. Her formidable martial arts are of no use at all."

The sword wound on his right palm had healed, and the resentment in his heart had slightly dissipated. Li Xian honed his sword path, executing the "Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword" several times, accumulating proficiency bit by bit. He heard [Proficiency +1], [Proficiency +1]... reaping a rich harvest, advancing step by step.

[Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword · First Layer]
[Proficiency: 78652/80000 Pinnacle Mastery]

[Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword · Second Layer]
[Proficiency: 77953/80000 Pinnacle Mastery]

As all his sword arts advanced, Li Xian pondered: "The Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword is indeed a dual-cultivation sword art. When the two swords merge, and intimacy blends with emotion, joy and happiness naturally advance the sword path. It is far superior to practicing alone. If this trend continues, my sword path will advance further. I wonder what the outcome will be."

Li Xian sheathed his sword and stopped practicing. He brought his fingers together, and his body transformed into a golden light that flowed. In an instant, he flashed a distance of two zhang. He walked to a folding screen and executed the Golden Light Art to pass through. Several times in a row, he was blocked by the screen, making it truly difficult to pass through.

Li Xian mused: "Golden Light Art... when executing this technique, my body transforms into countless tiny points of light, possessing form but no substance. I can seep through gaps like water. Let me try again."

He channeled his technique once more. A ball of golden light crashed into the screen, intercepted by the silkworm threads. Hundreds of tiny lights seeped through the gaps between the threads, but most remained outside the screen. Li Xian's form reappeared, once again blocked. He persisted, trying several times in a row.

The micro-lights that passed through the gaps grew denser. Suddenly, in an instant, the majority of the tiny lights seemed to pass through the screen, converging and reforming his body. Li Xian was now on the other side of the screen.

[Technique Path · Golden Light]
[Proficiency: 1/100]
[Description: The body transforms into flowing light, moving freely through obstacles.]

Li Xian executed the Golden Light Art again, intending to pass back the way he came. However, since he had just acquired this precious technique, it was not yet proficient. His previous passage through the screen was purely accidental. This time, he naturally failed. He was not discouraged and practiced until he was completely exhausted.

[Technique Path · Golden Light]
[Proficiency: 2/100]

In this way, several quiet days passed. Wen Cai Chang would "demand her due" each day, and then she and Li Xian would stick together all day long. The affection between the man and the woman was deep, their love passionate and infatuated, free and joyful. They were completely unaware of the changes in the outside world.

Wen Cai Chang had vast experience and was also open and dignified. She was not the least bit shy about this matter. When the mood struck and desire arose, it was only natural to do what they did. These few days of time were blissful and enchanting, a shared moment of beauty between heaven and earth.

At noon this day, Wen Cai Chang and Li Xian were having lunch together. The fine wine and delicious dishes were all extraordinary. The nineteen specialty dishes from the Delicacy Tower had all been eaten and tasted.

Wen Cai Chang's jade-like face was flushed with a rosy hue. She picked up a piece of pastry and fed it to Li Xian. Suddenly, Little Bun walked in with her head lowered, hesitating at the door. Although she made no unusual sound, she had already disturbed Wen Cai Chang's elegant mood.

Wen Cai Chang frowned slightly. She didn't want to get angry, but she was already displeased. She asked calmly, "Little Bun, what is it?"

Little Bun said fearfully, "Mistress, someone is here to see you outside. I don't know if you will see them or not?"

Wen Cai Chang sipped her tea carefully and raised an eyebrow slightly. "Who is it this time? If it's He Wentian, tell him I'm in seclusion and not receiving guests." Little Bun shook her head. "It's not the City Lord He, it's... it's a woman."

Wen Cai Chang's interest was slightly piqued. "A woman?" Little Bun said, "That woman gave her name as Gu Nianjun and said she has something to discuss with you."

Li Xian's heart stirred upon hearing this. "Gu Nianjun? What is this woman doing here? Mistress Wen is no easy person; she is not someone you can simply deal with. If Fu Haoran were here, it would be another matter."

Wen Cai Chang frowned and thought, "Gu Nianjun? If I'm not mistaken, she should be that little girl from the Gu family. She isn't well-known in Qiong Tian City, but she has some fame in the Gu estate. She and I have no prior connection. Why should I see her?"

Suddenly, a thought flashed through her mind. She glanced sideways at Li Xian, vaguely feeling that it was related to him. She thought secretly, "I'm curious, so seeing her won't hurt." She then told Little Bun to lead Gu Nianjun into the estate and wait in the inner hall.

The two of them ate and drank as usual. When they were in the mood, they would practice the sword, then embrace and find pleasure. It wasn't until evening that Wen Cai Chang went to the inner hall to meet Gu Nianjun.

Gu Nianjun was wearing a snow-white fox-fur coat. Her pretty face was fair with a hint of red, her eyebrows and eyes like a painting, her appearance delicate and beautiful. She immediately stood up and bowed, calling out, "Madame Wang!"

Wen Cai Chang nodded slightly and smiled. "Please, sit." Gu Nianjun said, "Thank you, Madame."

Wen Cai Chang got straight to the point. "Madame Wang and Miss Gu have rarely interacted. What matter requires you to come to my door?"

Gu Nianjun heard Wen Cai Chang refer to herself as Madame Wang, knowing she was unwilling to reveal her identity, or perhaps had other plans. But this matter had nothing to do with her, so she didn't dwell on it. She said, "Madame Wang, Nianjun... Nianjun has a matter she wishes to ask you. I have come especially; if I have offended you, please forgive me."

Wen Cai Chang crossed her legs, her posture graceful. Every movement exuded charm. She said, "Oh? What matter? Just say it. Considering the Gu family's face, if I can answer, I will tell you." Her voice was gentle, but it concealed disdain. She thought that if it weren't for the Gu family, you wouldn't even be able to see me.

Gu Nianjun saw that her eyebrows were relaxed and her face was flushed and radiant, looking even more moist and charming than when they met at the Spirit Fox Banquet. She secretly wondered what she used to maintain her skin. Although she heard the contempt in her words, she didn't get angry. She asked cautiously, "Nianjun wishes to ask, that day... that Young Master Zhou, after he received the Morning Yellow Dew and returned with you to the estate to collect it, where... where did he go afterward?"

Wen Cai Chang's eyes flashed with a sharp light; jealousy had already flared up, and her brows were tightly furrowed. Gu Nianjun immediately felt as if a sharp sword had pierced her body, as if she had fallen into an ice cave. Wen Cai Chang asked softly, "Oh? Miss Nianjun is asking about this matter, could it be... that you and that Young Master Zhou are quite familiar?"

Gu Nianjun said, "Familiar..." She felt a sense of loss, not knowing how to answer. She thought to herself, "I wish I were familiar with him, but I don't know how he sees me. What if he views me as a complete stranger?" She felt a pang of sadness.

Gu Nianjun said, "You could say we are familiar." Wen Cai Chang smiled gently and said, "Familiar is familiar, 'you could say' is hardly appropriate. Little Bun, Miss Gu has been waiting for a long time; why is there no hot tea at the table? It's cold and freezing; if we neglect Miss Gu, it would be a breach of etiquette. Quickly brew some tea and bring it over."

Little Bun immediately brewed the tea and brought it over. Gu Nianjun took a small sip, and indeed, her body warmed and her mouth felt moist. She said, "Thank you, Madame."

Wen Cai Chang said dignifiedly, "That young hero is indeed an extraordinary person. Since you are asking about his whereabouts, you must have a deep connection. Please, tell me the details."

Gu Nianjun recounted the events of the fox hunt one by one. She had a proud nature but was reasonable. She told the story truthfully, without a shred of falsehood or exaggeration. In her words, Li Xian was very polite and always kept a distance. Although the two had some connection, there were no romantic matters. Even if there were... it was only because Gu Nianjun had suddenly seen a talented man and admired him on her own.

But Wen Cai Chang's jealousy was extremely strong. Hearing that Li Xian had taught her archery and that they had close contact during the fox hunt on the snowy mountain, she naturally felt resentful. She didn't show it on her face, maintaining a gentle smile.

Wen Cai Chang said, "I see, I understand. So Miss Gu's visit is to find his whereabouts? You think he is still in my pavilion?"

Gu Nianjun thought, "This Wen Cai Chang doesn't have a big reputation, but she is extremely dangerous and not to be underestimated. How could her things be easily obtained? I want to find out his whereabouts, but I'm also worried that he has suffered a great loss at your hands." She smiled and said, "It's not exactly to find his whereabouts. The Five Swords Meeting is imminent. The five major sword sects will gather at the Solution Worry Tower to meet the various prodigies and wandering heroes. This is a rare grand event. Considering our friendship, I wish to meet him."

Wen Cai Chang was taken aback. She had always been sharp, but she had been neglectful lately and didn't know about the changes in the city. She thought, "The Five Swords Alliance has nothing to do with me." She became indifferent again and said, "So that's how it is. This is indeed a rare grand event. But unfortunately... how could that young hero be here with me?"

"He... after receiving the Morning Yellow Dew from someone, he left."

Gu Nianjun was greatly disappointed and asked, "Does Madame know where he went?"

Wen Cai Chang smiled meaningfully. "You care about him so much?" Gu Nianjun realized she had lost her composure and said, "It's just concern between friends."

Wen Cai Chang thought, "You little vixen, your thoughts might fool yourself, but they can't fool me. Li Xian, oh Li Xian... you're really not老实. You haven't been in the city for long, and you've already entangled with the Gu family girl. Although Li Lang is not entirely to blame, it's even more detestable that you would fall for him. Since you've come to my door, you can only blame your own bad luck."

On the surface, she smiled and said, "That young hero is truly fortunate to have a friend like you. If I'm not mistaken, he has already gone north."

Gu Nianjun said, "Ah! Very well, thank you, Madame." She turned and left. Wen Cai Chang watched her leave with a fixed gaze. Once Gu Nianjun was out the door, she let out a cold snort, flicked her sleeve, and immediately went to find Li Xian.

Little Bun wanted to follow, but in three steps, she lost sight of her. Wen Cai Chang, graceful and cold, was already standing by Li Xian's side.

Li Xian sensed something was wrong and asked, "Mistress, what's the matter?" Wen Cai Chang said, "Good Li Lang... I've thought it over and over. You should still gouge out your eyes as soon as possible!"

Li Xian said, "Mistress, you..." Wen Cai Chang said, "You have already painted three paintings for me, and I am very satisfied. There is no need for any more." She flicked her sleeve, and a gouging knife fell to the ground. She walked slowly, circling Li Xian several times. She said, "Li Lang... I'll give you one day. You behave yourself. It's all because you are inherently romantic and love to flirt with women."

She didn't allow Li Xian to say another word. She knew that Li Xian's sweet words were very powerful. If she heard a few more, she would soften and postpone it again. The matter of gouging out his eyes should have been done long ago, but she had postponed it again and again... She cherished their intimacy and couldn't bear to destroy it. She knew Li Xian was cunning and deceptive, but she tolerated and acquiesced to it.

Gu Nianjun's visit had indeed made her extremely jealous. But she had to use this momentum to force the matter of gouging out his eyes. If her anger dissipated, she would inevitably become soft-hearted and hesitant again.

Wen Cai Chang thought: "I need to make him gouge out his eyes for me, not me gouging out his eyes. He is my beloved man; how could I gouge out his eyes?" That's why she never did it herself. Every time she talked about "gouging out eyes," it was always through pleading, threatening, or forcing... but she never did it herself.

Wen Cai Chang formed several hand seals. "Qian," "Kun," "Zhen," "Xun," "Kan," "Li," "Gen," "Dui"... Her palm seals corresponded to the Eight Trigrams. She executed eight consecutive seals without any unusual movement, only feeling the light gradually dimming.

Li Xian's eyesight was extraordinary. He saw silkworm threads flashing in the room, fine and dense yet invisible.

When she finished this technique, she let out a soft "hmph," didn't speak to Li Xian, and turned to leave. The room was left with only Li Xian.

Little Bun arrived late, walking through the plant-lined corridor. She met the Mistress head-on, her face as cold as frost, completely ignoring her. Curious, she拐出 the corridor and looked towards the pavilion where Li Xian lived. She was instantly terrified, her legs going weak. She saw the huge pavilion wrapped in countless white silkworm threads, shaped like a giant silkworm cocoon.

It turned out... the eight "seals" Wen Cai Chang had formed were the "Eight Ultimate Seals" from the "Silkworm Garment Misleading Jade Art," meaning to sever heaven, earth, wind, thunder, marsh, fire, and water... A trapping and killing formation formed by silkworm threads. Once trapped inside, there was no way to deal with it.

She first捏 the "Qian Seal," and the ancestral silkworm beside her spat out silkworm threads. These threads were invisible to the naked eye. The moment she formed the seal, her fingers manipulated the threads, weaving them in the air, creating a complex web that instantly covered the sky, aiming to sever the escape route of light martial arts.

Then she捏 the Qian Seal again, and the threads pierced into the ground, weaving a ground net. This severed the escape route of earth-walking. After that, Zhen, Xun, Kan, Li... each seal targeted one type of escape method. When all eight seals were completed, there would be no way to heaven and no ability to go underground.

Back when they met at the inn, Wen Cai Chang had only tested the waters slightly and hadn't used this technique. It was enough to make Hao Qing She dare not fight back. Using it against Li Xian now was truly using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

Back in the room, everything was as before. Li Xian was well-versed in the Five Elements and knew that all things are interconnected, and feng shui affects each other. At this moment, however, he felt an extreme silence; all connections had been severed. It was as if he had been pulled out of the world, alone in a place with no sky, no earth, no wind, no fire...

The room was not dark. Li Xian tried to light a candle but couldn't get it to ignite in the slightest. When Wen Cai Chang formed the "Li Seal," the cocoon created its own world, where martial arts evolved infinitely. It had severed the fire seed, so fire could not be lit.

Li Xian thought: "What a powerful martial art. To use it against me is truly a waste of great talent. What did Gu Nianjun say to Wen Cai Chang? Why would it make her so angry that she must gouge out my eyes immediately? Gu Nianjun probably didn't mean to harm me. The Mistress wanting to gouge out my eyes isn't something that just started. I have avoided it as much as possible, but this day has finally come. I must face it."

He calmed himself and saw the gouging knife on the ground, its edge sharp. The blade was made of strange iron, and it could cut skin and flesh without pain. Li Xian glanced at it briefly and put it aside. How could he really gouge out his eyes?

Li Xian paced around his room, his brows tightly furrowed. Gradually, he understood the situation. This place was special and诡异, with no wind, no sky, no earth... Li Xian ran and stomped hard, but his steps made no sound. He executed sword moves, pushing them to their limits, but couldn't stir even a slight breeze.

He pushed the door with all his might, but it felt incredibly heavy, as if it had merged into a single whole. Li Xian activated his Heavy Pupils, observing the outside. He saw the pavilion wrapped in a silkworm cocoon. Even with heaven-defying abilities, it would be impossible to escape in the slightest.

Li Xian marveled: "This power is truly terrifying. The Mistress said her power had greatly increased; she probably wasn't lying to me. How could she weave such a large cocoon with a mere gesture?"

"I'm trapped in this cage. How can I escape? That's right... the cocoon is woven from silkworm threads. There must be gaps. If I use the Golden Light Art, can I seep out through the gaps? Just like I passed through the screen."

Li Xian immediately tried. Using his Heavy Pupils, he walked to a relatively thin spot. He executed the Golden Light Art, his body transforming into flowing light, and charged into the cocoon. The golden light seeped into the depths of the cocoon like water. However, since he had just acquired the technique, his control was clumsy.

He only seeped in a tiny bit before being blocked everywhere. Li Xian took two steps back, focused his gaze, and gathered his energy, trying again. Three times in a row, it was of no use. Li Xian's knowledge was somewhat shallow; he had truly underestimated the power of the "Eight Ultimate Seals."

Using the "Golden Light Art" to escape was indeed a feasible and usable strategy. However, it required the Golden Light Art to be extremely proficient and controlled with precision. And it required a good understanding of the "Eight Ultimate Seals." Based on the principles of the Eight Ultimate Seals, one would need to execute the Golden Light Art with precision to escape this cage.

Li Xian's Golden Light Art was not precise, and the Eight Ultimate Seals were even more obscure and complex. Naturally, escape was hopeless. He tried several other methods, all of which failed. Exhausted, he lay on the ground to rest.

His will was firm. Although he felt the difficulty in this situation, he was not in despair. After recovering his strength, he knew that强行 escape was useless. He sat quietly and thought of another plan: "Based on my understanding of the martial path, trying to escape the Mistress's encirclement is truly a pipe dream. Using the Golden Light Art to escape is completely impossible. There's no need to waste any more time on this."

"Right now... how can I resolve this dangerous situation and protect myself? My knowledge and martial path are both weaker than the Mistress's. Even with the Golden Light Art, I can't escape from her fingertips. The gap in strength is too great. I must do my best to leverage my strengths and avoid my weaknesses..."

Li Xian paced and pondered. He saw the "Green Sword" on the rack, held it in his hand, and examined the blade. Suddenly, his eyes lit up: "Compared to the Mistress, I am not without strengths. If it's about pure physical strength, I am much greater than her. When we are intimate in the bedroom, without involving martial arts, the Mistress is actually weaker than me. Besides that, my attainment in the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword is superior to hers."

"Thinking it through, I only have these two areas where I can barely surpass the Mistress. When I and the Mistress merge our swords, and the sword aura envelops us, I can actually handle her moves with ease. But if the Mistress uses other martial arts, I am defeated in an instant."

"If I can always maintain the connection with the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword's sword aura, preventing the Mistress from using other techniques, I can continue to entangle her. But the Mistress is so powerful. Even if my Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword reaches Pinnacle Mastery and surpasses the Mistress, if she wants to break free from the sword aura and decide the victor, it would be as easy as snapping her fingers."

Li Xian mused: "My Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword First and Second Layers are now at Pinnacle Mastery. If I can advance one step further, there might be an opportunity. At that time, when the Mistress comes, I will propose dual-cultivation again. I will use the opportunity to connect our sword auras, making it impossible for her to break free. Then I will look for a chance."

Li Xian's eyes were bright. He ran through the scenario several times in his mind and felt it was feasible. But he needed the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword to advance further. Li Xian no longer奢求 escape. He held the Green Sword and practiced the First and Second Layers of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]

[Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword · First Layer]
[Proficiency: 79563/80000 Pinnacle Mastery]

[Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword · Second Layer]
[Proficiency: 79113/80000 Pinnacle Mastery]

Time was tight, but Li Xian remained calm. He first focused his energy on practicing the first layer of the sword art. Standing against the sun, Three Suns Opening to Prosperity, Setting Sun About to Fade... The many sword moves, after his countless executions, now possessed a unique charm.

It was evening.

When the setting sun was about to fade, his proficiency accumulated to the maximum. Li Xian felt a spiritual insight, an indescribable realization. The sword momentum in his hand suddenly changed. It became more free, more natural, more self. Beyond Pinnacle Mastery, there was a different scenery!

[Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword · First Layer]
[Proficiency: 21/0 Great Self]
[Description: Beyond the pinnacle is the Great Self. No more restraints, no more forms. The martial path is unrestrained, and the sword is also unrestrained.]

Li Xian's mind was completely detached from all things. The situation, crisis, coercion, interests, love... all had nothing to do with him. Although his body was trapped in a cage, his heart was unrestrained, soaring in a realm that others could hardly perceive.

He waved his long sword casually. A simple movement was both ordinary and unpredictable. The style of a grandmaster was not enough to describe it. His eyes were closed, his expression calm, and he danced随意ly. In this cage, there was no sky, no earth, no wind, no fire...

But at this moment, there was "I." Where my body is, that is the Self. If someone were to witness this scene, they would be extremely moved. This sword-dancing posture was even more impressive than a master archer's shot!

A youth dancing with a sword, the heavens and earth also turn their heads, the wind and snow also stop their steps.

Outside the cocoon room, the scorching sun was like fire, purple clouds flowed with color. The market streets were filled with flowing carriages and horses, birds chirped happily. It was as if something extremely joyful had happened somewhere, silently affecting the surroundings, making everything more vibrant and bright. But no one knew the reason.

Wen Cai Chang frowned slightly, feeling a vague sense of异样, but she couldn't put her finger on it.

Li Xian opened his eyes and exhaled a breath of turbid air. He practiced the second layer of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword again. He had already glimpsed the high realm of martial arts and was calm and unhurried. That very night, the second layer of the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword reached the Great Self realm.

He held his sword horizontally and sat quietly, waiting for Wen Cai Chang to arrive.
