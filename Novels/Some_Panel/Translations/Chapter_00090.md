# Chapter 89: Many Great Figures, The Eastern Orthodox Demon Emperor's Successor Must Die

Within the Wuji Pavilion of the Wuji Dao Sect, on the Ninth Heaven, a circle of people was gathered.

Seated on the clouds at the head of the gathering was an individual wreathed in mist, suffused with dense Dao energy. Their form was indistinct and unseen, giving a blurred sense of distance. At first glance, they seemed right before one's eyes, but upon closer inspection, they appeared to be seated in a distant time and space, truly bizarre.

On the clouds to their left sat an elegant and noble beautiful woman, a faint smile gracing her face.

Below the two, in the celestial domain, in the void to the left and right, four individuals sat cross-legged in the air. All of them were veiled by Dao energy, indistinct and impossible to gaze upon directly. The Dao energy on their bodies ebbed and flowed, appearing and disappearing, extremely ethereal and otherworldly, like true immortals.

Besides these six seated individuals, a young man in a purple robe sat on the clouds slightly below them. The youth sat quietly on the clouds, surprisingly without any sense of disharmony, and his aura was no less impressive than that of the six superior individuals. That composed and serene demeanor made all his peers pale in comparison when in his presence. His eyelids opened and closed, his eyes like bright stars, seeming to contain thousands of stars within, as if a single glance could cast someone into reincarnation.

These individuals were some of the high-ranking members of Wuji Dao Sect: Sect Master Wujizi, four Mahayana Elders, and Wang Tianli, one of the Ten Great Dao Children. On the clouds below Wang Tianli, many more people were seated, including Inner Sect Elders and Core Disciples. From the Sect Master down to the Core Disciples, everyone was seated on different layers of heaven, their status evident at a glance.

At this moment, the beautiful woman at the head smiled and said, "My little one is restless wherever he goes. I wonder where he's run off to play now."

Wujizi smiled, then flipped his hand to produce a mirror, saying, "Yang Tong is your and Pure Yangzi's only offspring. He can't get hurt or bruised in my Wuji Dao Sect, otherwise Pure Yangzi will probably fly over from Pure Yang Dao Sect immediately to demand an explanation. If Ziyu is worried about the child's safety, we can just take a look through this mirror."

As he spoke, he tossed it with one hand, and the ancient bronze mirror rapidly expanded in the air. Everyone stared at the enormous mirror appearing in the void. This mirror was a top-grade Dao artifact called "Heaven-Monitoring Mirror." A flash of spiritual light appeared within the mirror, and the next moment, a scene appeared.

But upon seeing the scene within, everyone's expressions couldn't help but change slightly.

"This is the Hellish Refining Ground? I didn't expect my little one to sneak off to the Hellish Refining Ground and be besieged by so many Earth Devils," the beautiful woman said, her delicate brows slightly furrowed.

Staring at the huge Heaven-Monitoring Mirror, a Mahayana Elder suddenly let out a soft exclamation: "Who is that Nascent Soul disciple? He actually slew so many Earth Devils. His Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol somewhat resembles the True Adamant Dharma Idol, but isn't entirely it. When he unleashed it, it completely suppressed that high-grade Earth Devil King's Chiyou Demon Idol, making it afraid to fight head-on. Truly incredible!"

Hearing this, everyone quickly looked towards the Heaven-Monitoring Mirror, where Yang Ji was seen fiercely wielding his Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol, slaughtering devils everywhere.

"His Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol seems to have mutated from the True Adamant Dharma Idol. He can actually create new Dharma Idols. This disciple has quite some good fortune," another Mahayana Elder said.

Upon seeing this scene, on the clouds below, an Inner Sect Elder's pupils contracted, and a murderous glint immediately appeared in his eyes.

"Alright, though this disciple is indeed outstanding, the immediate priority right now is to rescue those disciples and the young child," Wujizi's voice was incomparably clear and magnetic, making listeners feel as if bathed in a spring breeze, naturally developing a favorable impression of him. He looked down and asked, "Who will go?"

"I'll go, my disciples from Cloud Haze Celestial Domain are trapped inside." A core female disciple of exquisite beauty looked at the people in the Heaven-Monitoring Mirror, a hint of urgency flashing in her eyes.

"Junior Sister Long, don't worry. Those Earth Devils have dared to insult our sect's disciples so. They need a good lesson. This senior brother is willing to make a trip to the refining ground and guarantees to safely bring out all junior brothers and sisters along with Junior Brother Yang Tong." Just then, a gentle voice slowly rang out, and everyone felt as if they were bathed in divine radiance, their hearts warm, and a feeling of heartfelt conviction arose within them.

Long Kui heard this, subtly glanced sideways, and said, "Senior Brother Wang, let me go with you!"

Wang Tianli smiled broadly, appearing very dignified, and said, "Junior Sister, just stay seated. I can go alone."

Suddenly, an Inner Sect Elder swept his gaze over the Heaven-Monitoring Mirror, then glanced at Yang Ji, and abruptly said, "Dao Child, let me go with you."

"Alright, Elder Qi, you can come with me." Wang Tianli glanced at him, then nodded. Then he looked at Wujizi and asked, "Does Sect Master have any other instructions?"

"Go quickly and return quickly!" Wujizi replied.

Wang Tianli nodded.

***

Hellish Refining Ground.

A celestial boat rapidly flew horizontally across the sky.

"Senior Sister, we're saved! The sect has come to rescue us." Several female disciples, seeing this scene, wept tears of joy, clearly experiencing intense emotional fluctuations. Although these were Dao Sect disciples with relatively outstanding talents, their mental fortitude still needed refinement. After this experience, they would surely gain much.

Yang Ji, seeing the celestial boat approach from afar, also quietly let out a sigh of relief.

The celestial boat flew above everyone's heads in an instant, and the Earth Devils hovering in the sky were instantly beaten into black mist. Just as those Earth Devils were about to reform, a golden, shining alms bowl, as large as a basketball court, suddenly appeared in the sky. As soon as the alms bowl appeared, it emitted golden light across the sky. The black mist swept by the golden light hissed and crackled, instantly annihilating in mid-air, leaving no trace. The golden alms bowl floated, radiating golden light. No matter how those Earth Devils tried to hide, they would be instantly annihilated.

"Earth Devils, die!"

Hearing this shout, Yang Ji's eyes narrowed slightly. He looked up and saw a square-faced Elder displaying great divine might. He stepped out from the celestial boat, took a few steps in the air, and landed directly on the golden alms bowl. He chanted a spell, his hands forming incantations, and the golden alms bowl immediately radiated a magnificent golden light, like a vast sun, pouring down boundless and grand righteous energy. The screams of the Earth Devils filled the sky, one after another. They didn't even have time to escape before they instantly vanished into the void.

"Dao Artifact, Great Sun Golden Bowl!" The high-grade Earth Devil King fighting Yang Ji was terrified, turned and fled, no longer having any of its previous demeanor.

The Elder's large hand reached out a hundred zhang into the air, gripping fiercely. The Earth Devil King was instantly caught in his hand. He said coldly, "A mere little Earth Devil King dares to be so presumptuous? Truly courting death!"

"A human great cultivator? No!" With one grasp, the Earth Devil King had no resistance whatsoever, being crushed half-dead and held motionless in his hand.

Yang Ji sighed inwardly, "Cultivators of the Body Integration stage are too strong. A high-grade Earth Devil King is like an ant in their hand, its life and death at their mercy."

The Earth Devil King in the Elder's hand let out a shriek. It clearly felt the killing intent in his palm and subconsciously cried out, "Demon Emperor, save me!"

"Demon Emperor? Are you referring to him?" An exceedingly gentle voice suddenly echoed in the void. The surrounding temperature abruptly became warm, making everyone feel cozy and very comfortable. An ethereal figure stepped forth from afar. Unidentifiable Dao charm permeated his surroundings, purple qi surged, golden light flashed, and his temperament was otherworldly, like a true immortal. As his purple robe fluttered, he seemed to merge with the void. One moment he was at the horizon, the next he had appeared right before everyone. He was actually using the great divine ability of Shrinking the Ground into Inches. His handsome face carried a hint of gentleness. His words and demeanor gave a sense of security and reliability, making people subconsciously feel that he was their support. A strange impulse of heartfelt conviction surged from the depths of everyone's hearts. Everyone actually bowed in respectful greeting, "Greetings, Senior Brother Wang!"

"Everyone, you've worked hard!" The newcomer smiled slightly and raised a hand, and everyone rose.

After Yang Ji rose, his heart was greatly shocked. He quietly wiped away the cold sweat from his forehead and exclaimed, "I was actually convinced by his aura and willingly bowed to him. This person is truly terrifying. Senior Brother Wang? With such might, could he be Wang Tianli, one of the Ten Great Dao Children?"

Wang Tianli, a perfect man. Whether it was his temperament or his appearance, there was truly nothing to find fault with. He just stood there quietly, and everyone naturally felt a slight inferiority, not even daring to meet his gaze directly, with a deep respect hidden in their subconscious.

His gaze swept around, Wang Tianli smiled slightly and said, "You successfully resisted the Earth Devils' attack and upheld our sect's prestige and spirit. You deserve merit. On behalf of the sect, I will reward each of you with a healing pill." Wang Tianli waved one hand, and several rays of light appeared around him. With a flick of his finger, a pill wrapped in radiant light landed in front of each person.

"Thank you, Senior Brother, for the reward!" The disciples took the pills and were all greatly astonished: "Great Rejuvenation Pill? It's actually a Great Rejuvenation Pill. I heard that after taking this pill, injuries will almost completely heal, cultivation will greatly increase, and even lifespan can be extended by ten years." Under their shock, everyone was overjoyed and quickly bowed in thanks again: "Many thanks, Senior Brother."

"Heh heh, no need for formalities. This is what you deserve." Wang Tianli had already retracted the phenomena around him. He wore the same purple robe as everyone else, yet it was precisely this that highlighted his extraordinary temperament, making him look vastly different from other disciples, extremely noble.

Turning his head, Wang Tianli smiled and gently stroked the child holding the Sun and Moon Wheel, asking warmly, "Little one, you weren't scared, were you?"

"No, I can still fight," the child grunted twice, refusing to admit defeat.

"How does this person also have the character 'Tong' (童) in his name, just like me?" Inside Yang Ji's sleeve, the Buddha Child had already returned and now frowned.

Yang Ji did not respond to him, but slowly retracted his Dharma Idol.

Wang Tianli smiled at the child, then turned to look at the Earth Devil King held in the Elder's hand, and asked, "Demon Emperor? Are you talking about the Underworld Demon Emperor?" With a single wave of his hand, a ball of white light appeared out of thin air, and within it was an utterly terrified primordial spirit face, clearly having suffered immense horror before being captured.

"Underworld Demon Emperor!" Seeing this scene, the high-grade Earth Devil King's eyes showed despair.

"A mere ant dares to harm my sect's disciples? Truly courting death." Before the Earth Devil King could even shriek, it was crushed to death by the square-faced Elder, turning into a bloody mist that dispersed.

The next moment, he suddenly turned his head, staring fiercely at Yang Ji like a venomous snake. Suddenly, he conjured a colossal hand, striking towards Yang Ji.

"Huh? What?" Yang Ji was greatly alarmed. He quickly unleashed his Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol to resist, but the power disparity was simply too vast. Under this single palm, his Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol fragmented section by section, collapsing.

"This aura, as expected, is that of a Humanoid Weapon. Are you a successor of the Eastern Orthodox Demon Emperor? Damn it! Take him to the Life and Death Arena for judgment." The square-faced Elder's face was filled with murderous intent, and he struck another palm towards Yang Ji.
