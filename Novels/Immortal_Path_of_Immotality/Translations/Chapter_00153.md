# Chapter 152: Can We Cancel the Contract?

The central command hall was deathly silent.

Hundreds of eyes focused intently on the purple tentacle. Among the gathered Golden Core cultivators—each with centuries of experience and vast knowledge—none had ever seen such a sentient appendage sprouting from a human body.

Its slimy surface, sinuous tip, indecipherable pictographic patterns, and the eerie carvings on its skin seemed to possess a consciousness of its own—mysterious, sinister, and terrifying.

"What is this thing?"

The sect leader suddenly felt his hand grow wet, followed by a burning sensation. He immediately slapped the purple tentacle away. Looking at his palm, he saw purple spots rapidly spreading across his skin.

"Screeeech!"

A blood-curdling shriek echoed through the hall. Everyone who heard it felt their scalps tingle as if their souls had been electrocuted, goosebumps rising uncontrollably.

Struck by the sect leader's furious blow, the purple tentacle writhed in pain behind Bear Mountain Sage, its wild thrashing splattering droplets of purplish-black blood that corroded the floor, leaving pockmarks of varying depths.

Hidden among the crowd, Lin Shan's heart pounded violently!

If he wasn't mistaken, this purple tentacle seemed to be the result of his curse?

At the same time, he felt the skull hanging at his waist trembling slightly. He had no idea why it was so agitated—did they know each other?

"Impossible! This is an abyssal horror—they're ancient beings from the previous epoch! How could it appear here?"

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord trembled uncontrollably, gripped by sheer terror as if witnessing the apocalypse itself. His mind reeled with visions of cataclysmic destruction, his sanity teetering on the edge.

"What? You've seen this thing before?"

"No... I once came across an ancient text about abyssal horrors in a ruin from the previous epoch. The descriptions there..."

The demon lord seemed to recall something earth-shattering—countless temples from that bygone era, teeming with billions of sorcerers and shamans traversing the void, commanding the heavens and earth with a mere gesture... only to be ultimately devoured by an all-encompassing darkness of abyssal corruption.

The more he remembered, the harder he shook, urgently sending a mental message to Lin Shan:

"The moment we leave this hall, flee! Run as far as you can!"

"Never get involved with these things—once contaminated..."

"Even immortals would be lucky to escape with their lives!"

...

"Damn!"

Lin Shan shuddered at the dire warning. This thing had such terrifying origins? What kind of monster had his curse actually summoned?

"If I told you—"

"Don't speak! I need to rethink my entire cultivation path!"

"No, I mean if—"

"There are no ifs! Your best option is to leave the Great Song Dynasty immediately and flee to another country."

"Suppose I told you—"

"No suppositions! I've traveled countless worlds and lived for ages—I know more secrets than roads you've walked!"

"What if this thing was my—"

"No what-ifs! Why are you so stubborn? Would I lie to you? Do you even know why the infinite chaos void of the previous epoch collapsed?"

"Just listen—"

"Shut up! When faced with an abyssal entity capable of annihilating civilizations and triggering epochal calamities, there's nowhere to run!"

"I summoned this thing!"

...

The miniature skull fell silent. After all its dramatic talk of "epochal disasters," "world-ending horrors," and "void-shattering chaos," it suddenly had nothing to say.

After a long pause, a hoarse mental message came through:

"Prove it."

"Remember that curse technique I used before? Didn't I summon you from the underworld? That purple tentacle—I cursed Bear Mountain Sage and summoned it too."

"You... you're sure?"

"Absolutely sure! I didn't just summon you two—there was also that middle-aged man in brocade robes. A creepy giant eyeball appeared on his forehead, all sinister and lively..."

"An... anything else?" The demon lord's voice trembled so badly it could barely form words.

"Of course! I once cursed a parasitic insect too—after my curse, it grew all these disgusting, wriggling tentacles like a snail's, soft and tender..."

Lin Shan grew more animated as he spoke, oblivious to the sheer terror in the skull's tone.

"Have you... interacted with these abyssal beings?"

The demon lord asked cautiously.

"Sure! That giant eyeball even greeted me warmly. I showed it some minor spells!"

"Any... closer contact?"

"Yep! That cursed insect? I squashed it underfoot! After it died, its tentacles kept twitching and pointing at the air, like it was sending out some signal—hilarious, right?"

"......"

"Hello? Why so quiet?"

---

"......"

"Hey, you're the one who asked! Why the silent treatment?"

"Grandfather!"

"???"

"Grandfather Lin Shan!"

"What's wrong with you? Lost your mind?"

"You're my blood grandfather! I beg you—release our soul contract! I just want to go home..."

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord finally broke!

If you had connections with the abyssal horrors, you should've said so earlier! Signing a soul contract with me is just dragging me to hell with you! If you want to die, don't take me down too! I'm just a humble underworld laborer working across dimensions—what did I do to deserve this?!

On the verge of tears, the demon lord wallowed in despair. He had nothing left to say, only wishing to curl up in a corner and lick his wounds. His fate was sealed—doomed to be haunted by abyssal corruption, his days numbered...

"But if they're all summoned through curses, why are the others abyssal horrors while you're normal?"

"Have you considered that perhaps everyone else summons normal beings like me, while you're the one summoning horrors?"

They stared at each other, the atmosphere thick with awkwardness as neither could convince the other.

Lin Shan believed the demon lord should examine his own issues instead of blaming him.

The demon lord insisted Lin Shan had no idea how terrifying abyssal entities were and begged not to be dragged into his doom.

Meanwhile, the situation on the other side of the hall had taken a drastic turn.

At some point, Bear Mountain Sage had been sealed inside a luminous sphere. Over a hundred Black Lotus Sect Golden Core cultivators channeled their power into the prison floating mid-air, suppressing both the sage and the abyssal tentacle with overwhelming force.

The hall's perimeter flickered with demonic flames, the oppressive atmosphere weighing heavily on everyone present.

The purple tentacle inside the sphere finally succumbed, its aura plummeting as it was forcibly driven back into Bear Mountain Sage's body. The Golden Core protectors collectively exhaled in relief.

The sect leader, having purged the purple spots from his hand with formidable cultivation, glared darkly at the terrified sage in the sphere. No explanations were needed—the truth would be revealed once he probed the man's soul.

But when he reached for Bear Mountain Sage's head to perform a soul search...

A golden barrier suddenly materialized, repelling the late Golden Core sect leader with such force that he staggered back seven or eight meters before being steadied by three Nascent Soul Dharma Kings.

An aged voice emerged from Bear Mountain Sage:

"Heh, I wonder what transgression my foolish disciple has committed to incur such wrath. This old man offers his apologies on his behalf."
