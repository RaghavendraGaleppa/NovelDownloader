# Chapter 14: First Kill

“Sharp enough!” Qin Ming rose from the whetstone. The rust had faded from the woodcutting knife in his hand, leaving it as smooth as a mirror, like a pool of autumn water.

“People like Feng Yi’an and Shao Chengfeng deserve death, but if good people are caught up in their accidents, that would be a great pity.” He wanted to find out.

In the evening, Old Man Liu was drinking with Xu Yueping. Each only had one cup, and they would take small sips, savoring the taste. That was all there was; the jar of spicy old wine at Xu Yueping’s house was already at the bottom.

“A single roe deer for a human life, truly no humanity at all!” Old Man Liu cursed as he drank. His heart felt heavy, and he couldn't tell the Qian family these things.

What Xu Yueping worried about most was that people like Feng Yi’an and Shao Chengfeng might truly achieve a second rebirth, which would make things even worse.

“Is there not a single good person in the Mountain Patrol Team?” Qin Ming arrived.

Old Man Liu sighed, “If more than half a basket of pears are rotten, it’s hard to save the rest if you don't do something. The Mountain Patrol Team can have up to twelve members when full, but now there are only nine. Those who don't fit in are either ostracized and leave, or they meet with accidents in the mountains.”

“Is there no one who can restrain or deal with them?” Qin Ming asked casually.

Xu Yueping vigorously shook the wine jar to pour out a small amount for him, then pulled him to sit down and drink together.

Old Man Liu thought for a moment and said, “Some of the other patrol teams are not on good terms with them, either because they can't stand their ways or because they compete for spiritual treasures in the mountains. There have been bloody incidents between them.”

Xu Yueping added, “And there’s Qing Sang Village next door. They weren’t forced to plant Black Moon. It seems that ‘Two-Sickness Boy’s’ relative is quite capable.”

At this point, he looked at Qin Ming and said, “Little Qin, you have a solid Golden Foundation. You should make a plan. When early spring arrives, go out and see the world. Don't be trapped here.”

He understood the characters of Feng Yi’an, Shao Chengfeng, and others, fearing that Qin Ming might be harmed by those wolf-like patrollers.

Qin Ming pondered, “A plan? I really want to know where I fled from during the famine back then.”

“Ah, I almost forgot if you hadn't mentioned it. I’ve always thought of you as one of us here.” Xu Yueping didn’t know how to comfort him, so he changed the subject.

He spoke of the brilliance of Crimson Cloud City, how incredibly prosperous and full of talented people it was, and how there might be opportunities to obtain advanced meditation methods, aura arts, and so on.

Old Man Liu also chimed in, “I also support you, Little Qin, in going out. A young man should have vigor and dreams. Otherwise, by my age, your legs will be weak, unable to go anywhere, leaving only regret and a sigh for your twilight years.”

Xu Yueping smiled, “Uncle Liu, I heard you had lofty ambitions back then.”

Old Man Liu wasn’t embarrassed when old stories were brought up. He said, “Who hasn't been young?”

“What were your ambitions back then?” Qin Ming was very interested.

Old Man Liu recalled, “Back when I was young and reckless, it was normal to dare to dream and act. For example, I wanted to rise up and subdue a renowned beast in the mountains, and even more, I wanted to marry the most beautiful girl nearby.”

“What was the outcome?”

“One time, while cooperating with the Mountain Patrol Team, we unexpectedly encountered that renowned beast. It charged past, merely passing through, and nearly wiped us all out. From then on, my vitality was damaged, and the threshold for a second rebirth became completely unreachable. I gave up on that dream, and that young lady was even married off to one of my rivals.”

Qin Ming raised his cup to him. How utterly miserable.

Old Man Liu chuckled, “Later, I just couldn't stand it, so I married that rival’s elder sister, making him call me ‘brother-in-law’ for the rest of his life.”

“Only you, sir!”

Each of the three only had half a cup of wine, yet they drank for an entire night.

After returning home, Qin Ming wiped down the iron-cored bow engraved with monster patterns. Unfortunately, for him now, it was no longer a ‘hard bow’ (strong enough). He would break it if he pulled too hard.

“Barely usable.”

Afterwards, he filled the quiver wrapped in beast hide with iron arrows, and took out spare clothes to put in his pack.

“Tomorrow is the middle of the month.” He gazed at the deep night sky.

That night, he went to bed early, needing to adjust his spirit, energy, and vitality to their peak condition.

He woke up in the latter half of the night. His sleep was sufficient. Although it was still far from dawn, he quietly pushed open the courtyard gate.

In the dead of night, all was silent. The darkness was deep and eerie, and ordinary people could see almost nothing.

After his rebirth, Qin Ming’s physical qualities had improved in all aspects, including his vision. Even in this extreme environment, he could see hazy objects, which didn't impede his travel.

He didn't pass by the Fire Spring; instead, he chose the most secluded small path to bypass it.

Snowflakes had been falling for days, and they were getting heavier.

His black hair, hanging to his shoulders, swayed in the night wind. His slender body was not thin but strong and powerful, and his steps were incredibly firm as he walked towards the great mountain.

The faces of the injured villagers appeared one by one before his eyes, and the scene of Feng Yi’an handing over a roe deer at Uncle Qian’s funeral always lingered in his mind. He could bear it no longer; today, he was going to deal with the Mountain Patrol Team!

Qin Ming entered the mountain steadily and calmly. He had long held this desire in his heart, and now there was no tension or unease, as if he were simply walking on the road home.

In the dense forest, the howls of various creatures rose and fell, and black shadows streaked across the sky. In the dark forest, like an abyss, many malicious eyes appeared—some blood-red, some ghostly green like will-o'-the-wisps, some cold and silvery white—all staring fixedly at him. One could even hear the panting of strange beasts and the sound of raptors tearing through the air, all very close by. The great mountain at deep night was exceptionally dangerous.

Qin Ming suddenly accelerated. This was a physical quality beyond the Golden Foundation. He instantly rushed towards a large strange beast. His woodcutting knife was like a streak of white silk across the air. With a *pffft*, a massive head was chopped off, blood spurted, and the headless, over 600-jin corpse crashed onto the ground.

Suddenly, the vicinity grew quiet. All those green and blood-red eyes in the darkness vanished.

Qin Ming continued his journey, his goal clear, advancing steadily towards the outpost.

A moment later, the headless mountain beast was torn apart and devoured by a group of carnivorous creatures. The sounds of fierce beasts fighting and protecting their food echoed from that spot.

Qin Ming approached his destination, standing on an adjacent peak, observing the outpost with the Fire Spring opposite.

It was still some time before dawn, but people were already active there. A man with curly black hair, nearly two meters tall, was feeding bloody chunks of meat to a fierce golden mastiff.

“Fu Entao!” Qin Ming realized who it was. He had heard of his physical characteristics: naturally curly hair. This strongest squad leader was actually already at the outpost.

Then he saw four more people, including Feng Yi’an and Shao Chengfeng, emerge from the wooden cabin one after another.

“They arrived early,” Qin Ming frowned, guessing they must have arrived yesterday.

He descended the mountain unhurriedly, waiting on the only path leading to the outpost. Four people had not yet arrived, and he decided to eliminate them first.

Snowflakes whitened his black hair. He stood still. Dawn had arrived, the mountain mist gradually dispersed, and the sky was no longer so dark.

For a reborn person, vision becomes much wider. Qin Ming saw a man appear, walking from outside the mountain, draped in a beast-hide cloak.

The face was familiar. When Feng Yi’an humiliated Xu Yueping in Silver Vine Town that day, this person had been by his side.

Qin Ming, standing like an ice sculpture behind a large tree, moved. With a sound like a thunderclap, he instantly reached the man, crashing into his body with a dull thud.

Many bones throughout the man’s body broke on the spot. His eyes bulged. Under extreme pain, he couldn’t even manage to scream because his neck was attacked first, grasped by a slender yet powerful hand.

With a *crunch*, the patroller’s neck was twisted and broken. And because Qin Ming used too much force, after crushing his cervical vertebrae, he almost tore his head off.

The man’s head limply tilted to one side and sagged down, his neck seemingly connected by only a layer of skin. Even in death, his face bore an expression of terror and despair.

Qin Ming carried the man towards the depths of the dense forest. He smelled alcohol and an irritating cosmetic scent on him. No wonder this person’s reaction was slow; he was hungover after a night of revelry. His death was not unjust.

After searching him, he threw the man far away. Taking a deep breath, his emotions fluctuated noticeably. After all, this was his first time killing a human.

Although he had prepared himself mentally long beforehand, he still felt a bit uneasy.

However, he quickly adjusted. He often hunted in the mountains, battling dangerous creatures, so he had seen blood before. His psychological resilience was extremely strong.

“To plant Black Moon at the Fire Spring, you’ve continuously killed villagers. You’re more harmful than the fierce beasts and birds of prey in the mountains. Today, I’ll kill all of you. Eliminating this scourge here is the fulfillment of my heart’s desire!”

Qin Ming calmed down. In his mind, he regarded this group of patrollers as vicious beasts and monsters. He regained his composure and determination.

After a long wait, the second person walked through the wind and snow. In the pre-dawn light, his tall figure was accentuated, giving off a sense of oppression. He wore armor similar to Shao Chengfeng’s.

Qin Ming, covered in snowflakes, slowly drew his woodcutting knife, preparing to test its edge.

As the person approached, a flash of dazzling blade light erupted in the darkness. Qin Ming burst through the snowy ground, moving like lightning, covering ten meters in an instant.

This patroller’s reaction was much stronger than the previous one. Feeling the deadly threat appearing from his side and rear, his hairs stood on end. He quickly moved sideways, then dove to the ground, trying to evade the danger.

As a reborn person with comprehensively enhanced physical qualities, his alertness and adaptability were competent. If he were facing other opponents of the same level, he should have been able to dodge this strike.

However, Qin Ming was originally faster than him, moving like thunder, and had already anticipated his move. The sharp woodcutting knife in his hand slashed through, and with a *pffft*, the man’s head flew off, severed with a single strike!

Blood spurted far and wide in an instant, staining the snow crimson. The headless corpse, maintaining its original forward momentum, tumbled into a snowdrift.

Qin Ming withdrew his knife. This time, he remained calm, with fewer ripples in his heart.

The heavy goose-feather snow didn’t seem to float down but rather to smash down, growing heavier and heavier. The force of the cold wind hitting his face was indeed not light. Qin Ming looked up at the sky and said, “Good snow!”

Only with strong winds and heavy snow could his traces be better covered.

He stood in the wind and snow, like a motionless statue holding a knife. He successively waited for the third and fourth persons. Without any surprise, both patrollers were struck down by him with the force of thunder in the dim mountain forest.

He no longer felt uncomfortable. He could gently smile at Xiao Wenrui, and he could also wield his knife to kill a group of patrollers in the mountains whose harm was fiercer than tigers.

Qin Ming’s steps were firm and unhurried. Alone, he walked steadily towards the Mountain Patrol Team’s outpost.
