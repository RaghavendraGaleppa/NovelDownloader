# Chapter 50: Entering the Island for the Conference, A Beauty's Infatuation

"Is it not possible? Why?" Chief Yuan couldn't help but ask.

"To cultivate immortality as a mortal, one must possess spiritual roots," Wei Qian explained. "But among the countless beings in this world, only one in ten thousand may have them."

In truth, everyone had spiritual roots, but for most people, their spiritual root aptitude was so negligible it might as well not exist.

"So without spiritual roots, one truly cannot cultivate immortality?" Yuan Mei also asked.

How should he answer this?

After a brief moment of contemplation, Wei Qian replied, "This world is vast beyond measure. I dare not claim whether there exist other methods of cultivation that don't require spiritual roots."

His words were tactful, but the underlying message was crystal clear.

In the end, father and daughter bowed respectfully and took their leave.

Half an hour later, the great ship finally arrived at the center of Pingyang Lake.

Wei Qian stepped out and surveyed his surroundings—a thick blanket of white mist stretched before him.

While mortals spoke of this place with superstitious awe, Wei Qian knew it was merely a first-tier 'Mist Formation,' only capable of fooling ordinary people. Any cultivator with decent cultivation or skills could dispel it in the blink of an eye.

Wei Qian retrieved a token from his storage pouch and channeled spiritual energy into it.

Moments later, a passage emerged through the dense, unyielding mist.

He then took out a flying boat artifact and soared into the air.

Standing atop the artifact, he glanced back at the ship. The people aboard watched him with longing eyes.

With a flick of his finger, Wei Qian sent a small white jade vial hurtling toward the ship. Chief Yuan scrambled to catch it in a panic.

"The pills inside are enough to help a mortal martial artist break through to the grandmaster realm," Wei Qian said. "Consider it payment for the journey."

The pills were actually refined from the dregs of his failed alchemy attempts—useless to cultivators but beneficial to mortals.

"Until we meet again, Chief Yuan," Wei Qian said before steering his flying boat forward.

As he ventured deeper, the mist closed behind him, sealing the passage.

The Mist Formation's range wasn't vast, and soon Wei Qian emerged within it, spotting a small island at the lake's center.

A streak of light immediately shot toward him from the island, stopping before him.

"Brother Wei," the figure greeted warmly.

"Ah, Brother Bai. I've kept you waiting—please lead the way," Wei Qian responded courteously.

The man was Bai Fugui's cousin, Bai Fujie.

By now, many cultivators had already gathered on the island, housed in various pavilions.

Bai Fujie, however, didn't pause at these. He led Wei Qian straight to the island's center.

There stood a series of spacious courtyards, far larger than the outer pavilions.

"Those staying here either contributed items to the auction or hold special status," Bai Fujie explained.

Initially, Bai Fugui had only intended to organize a small auction. Yet, to his own surprise, he proved remarkably adept at it, turning the event into a proper affair.

Naturally, besides rogue cultivators, members of cultivation families and sects were also drawn in.

Such guests couldn't be treated like ordinary rogue cultivators relegated to the periphery.

The island's center had fifty courtyards, assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.

Wei Qian had arrived late, so he was assigned the forty-seventh courtyard.

"This place is quite peaceful—excellent," Wei Qian remarked upon settling in, pleased with the tranquility.

He relished the solitude.

However, his peaceful respite lasted less than a day before Bai Fugui himself came knocking.

He sought Wei Qian's help in appraising auction items—specifically, medicinal pills.

Wei Qian didn't immediately agree. "I'm just a novice alchemist. I can't guarantee the accuracy of my appraisals. You'd better find someone more qualified."

"Don't say that!" Bai Fugui protested. "Brother Wei, you're too modest."

"I know you dislike the limelight, but this time, you must help me."

"I've worked hard to organize this auction. The first one must be a resounding success."

"Only then can we sustain it in the long run."

As he pleaded, Bai Fugui sweetened the deal, knowing Wei Qian wouldn't act without incentive.

From his storage pouch, he produced a frost-jade box.

"Inside is that century-old Purple Monkey Flower," he said.

This was one of the three primary ingredients for refining Foundation Establishment Pills. Though its age fell short for alchemical use, it remained a precious item, valued between 150 to 200 spirit stones.

Wei Qian smoothly pocketed the box.

"Since it's your auction, of course I'll support it," he said. "Lead the way!"

At the island's heart stood an opulent palace, centuries old.

The main hall, reserved for the auction, remained sealed for now.

Bai Fugui guided Wei Qian to a side chamber where three individuals awaited.

The first was an elderly scholar in Confucian robes. The second, a burly man with a thick beard, bare-chested and reeking of sulfur.

The third was a middle-aged beauty in a violet palace gown.

Beneath her flowing skirt, glimpses of slender calves and bare, dainty feet swayed subtly, exuding an unconscious allure.

Her entire presence radiated enchantment.

Compared to the other two, Wei Qian's gaze lingered noticeably longer on the beauty.

Hiss!

He bit his tongue sharply, using the pain to clear his mind.

What was that just now? Charm magic?

Wei Qian averted his eyes, refusing to look at her again.

"Bai boy, who is this?" The beauty seemed intrigued by Wei Qian.

A vigorous young man shouldn't have shaken off her charm so swiftly.

With her discerning eye, she sensed Wei Qian brimming with vitality and yang energy—clearly, his resistance wasn't due to any deficiency.

Bai Fugui also avoided looking directly at her as he introduced, "This is the alchemist I invited to appraise medicinal pills."

Turning to Wei Qian, he added, "Brother Wei, this is Fairy Ziluo, the auction's hostess."

This beauty was overseeing the auction?

Tsk. With her at the helm, the event's success was all but guaranteed.

Hearing "alchemist," Fairy Ziluo's eyes sparkled.

Alchemists were always wealthy!

Assessing Wei Qian's appearance—though unremarkable, he carried himself with composed ease, like a steadfast bamboo.

Combined with his alchemist status, he was undoubtedly a prime candidate.

Thus, the beauty began batting her eyelashes at him, but Wei Qian ignored her advances.

Instead, he asked Bai Fugui, "And these two are...?"
