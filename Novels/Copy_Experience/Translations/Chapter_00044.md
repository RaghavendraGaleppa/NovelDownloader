## Chapter 44: Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma

Lu Xu found a secluded spot and took out his spoils of war.

There were two storage bags. One was filled with miscellaneous items, which Lu Xu promptly burned after a quick inspection. The other contained over two hundred spirit stones, three mid-grade magic artifacts, along with some talismans, pills, and cultivation techniques.

"《Notes of the Wushan Rogue Cultivator》?"

An ancient book caught Lu Xu's attention. He opened it and saw that it contained a large amount of information related to raising spirit beasts and spirit insects.

"Hmm, I don't have time to study this in detail now, but the fact that this person found me might be related to these notes!"

After casually flipping through a few pages, Lu Xu found some content about tracking spirit insects. He speculated that the burly man might have used such a method to track him down. What specific means the opponent used was now unknowable to Lu Xu, as the burly man was already dead. Lu Xu didn't even know his identity. The spirit insect itself had long since vanished without a trace in the explosion of the Fire Thunder Orb, so Lu Xu hadn't discovered it.

"I might need to replicate experience later, so I'll have to recharge the Azure Stone Tablet!"

Lu Xu thought for a moment, then took out spirit stones one by one, watching them vanish in his palm.

"Huh, what's this?"

As some of the spirit stones disappeared from his hand, Lu Xu suddenly noticed fine powder accumulating in his palm.

"What is this? These seem to be the spirit stones I got from Gao Tianqiang earlier!"

"This powder..."

Lu Xu's eyes narrowed slightly. He roughly understood what was happening.

"Forget it, that person is dead anyway!"

He recharged the previous batch of two hundred spirit stones he had obtained from Gao Tianqiang. As a result, a very fine powder flaked off all these spirit stones. After some thought, Lu Xu also recharged the previous batches of three hundred spirit stones to the Azure Stone Tablet. These spirit stones behaved normally, with no issues arising.

"It seems only this newly acquired batch of spirit stones had a problem. My previous transactions with Gao Tianqiang were fine. This time, it's likely related to Tan Hu's sudden appearance or his relative!"

"Forget it, I can't continue trading with the Black Robe Society. I need to find an opportunity to get rid of Gao Tianqiang!"

After a period of contemplation, Lu Xu decided to reluctantly sever ties with the Black Robe Society. He had initially thought that with their forces besieged by the alliance of three families in Qinghu Market, they wouldn't be able to dispatch many people. Yet, a late-stage Qi Condensation burly man still appeared.

What if next time a ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivator showed up? He would be utterly powerless. Although such a possibility was extremely small, he had to guard against it. This extremely fast way to earn money had to be abandoned.

After recharging five hundred spirit stones, Lu Xu tidied up his belongings and quickly flew towards Weidu.

Soon after, in an inn in Weidu, Lu Xu entered and, after revealing his identity as a cultivator, was led into an underground secret chamber. Similar to the secret market he had attended last time, this place was arranged with a circle of chairs around an empty central area, where a table was placed.

Quite a few people had already arrived, roughly seventy or eighty. Lu Xu wore a ghost-face mask, concealing his cultivation, and found a corner to wait quietly. People continued to trickle in, and after a quarter of an hour, the last person entered, closing the door to the secret chamber behind him. This person, also wearing a mask, walked directly to the center of the chamber and announced loudly to the crowd:

"Thank you, fellow Daoists, for your attendance. I am Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator, the host of this secret market trade fair!"

"I now declare, this secret market trade fair has begun!"

"First, I will display the item to be traded. Some fellow Daoists might have already heard of it. The first item I am presenting is a Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma!"

"This is the main ingredient for refining Barrier-Breaking Pills. Its value needs no further explanation; alchemists should be well aware of how precious it is!"

As soon as Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator's voice fell, exclamations immediately rose from the crowd. Many had never heard the name Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma, but the fame of the Barrier-Breaking Pill was known to all. Any mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator would have paid attention to this spiritual medicine and yearned for it deeply. Unfortunately, the exorbitant price of six or seven hundred spirit stones for a Barrier-Breaking Pill was simply an unreachable dream for most mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators.

Many cultivators began discussing, and the secret chamber became noisy. However, while these people were very curious about the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma, not many truly wanted to trade for it. The Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma would be useless in their hands.

Lu Xu's gaze did not fall on Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator, but instead he carefully observed the reactions of everyone around him.

"May I ask how many spirit stones are required for this item?" an old and steady voice asked.

Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator shook his head, "The owner of this item wishes to exchange it for another item!"

"What does he want?" the same old voice inquired.

Lu Xu shifted his gaze to the owner of this voice. The person was cloaked entirely in a black robe, making their specific appearance indiscernible. They wore a bamboo hat, with a black veil hanging down from it, obscuring everything.

"A cultivation technique!"

Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator's voice resonated:

"The owner of the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma requires a cultivation technique!"

As soon as his voice fell, the old voice immediately responded, "I have many cultivation techniques here. What attribute does he need?"

"Daoist friend, please don't rush. Not just any cultivation technique will meet the requirements!" Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator chuckled and continued, "This cultivation technique must be one that allows those with poor aptitudes to rapidly increase their cultivation in a short amount of time!"

"This..." Hearing this requirement, the old voice instantly fell silent. He indeed had many cultivation techniques in his possession, but they were all orthodox ones, each slower to cultivate than the last.

"Any fellow Daoist who wishes to obtain the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma and has a suitable cultivation technique can bring it forward to exchange with me. I will be the one to appraise whether the cultivation technique is suitable!" Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator said, looking around.

Not long after his words, the figure who had spoken with the old voice stood up and walked over. He successively took out three or four cultivation techniques from his storage bag, handing them one by one to Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator for inspection. But after reviewing each technique, Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator shook his head.

Finally, he sighed and said, "Daoist friend, unfortunately, none of these four cultivation techniques meet the requirements!"

"Can't it be purchased with spirit stones? Or perhaps with pills? I can provide pills that accelerate cultivation!" the figure said, seemingly unwilling.

Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator shook his head, "The Ganoderma owner only requires a cultivation technique!"

"Daoist friend, perhaps you'd like to look at this cultivation technique of mine!"

As soon as Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator's voice fell, a voice sounded next to him. He turned to look, only to see the person wearing a ghost-face mask, exuding an unfathomable aura. Taking the cultivation technique the other party handed over, Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator opened it and looked for a while, then immediately let out a soft exclamation:

"Yes, Daoist friend, this cultivation technique perfectly meets the Ganoderma owner's requirements!"

After saying this, Mangjiang Rogue Cultivator gave Lu Xu a meaningful look. In his opinion, someone who could produce such a cultivation technique was no simple character.

"Then let's complete the transaction!" Lu Xu reminded him with a smile. The cultivation technique he had taken out was precisely the 《Three Yin Art》 he had obtained from that Black Robe Society rogue cultivator earlier. This cultivation technique had been left in the corner of his storage bag ever since he acquired it; he hadn't expected it to come in handy this time.

The two exchanged their items, and Lu Xu received the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma. As soon as he sat back down in his chair, the owner of the old voice followed him, seemingly unwilling to give up.

"Fellow Daoist, may we conduct a transaction between us?"

"You want the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma?" Lu Xu carefully scrutinized the other party and asked slowly.

"Precisely. Fellow Daoist can name your price. I can offer you two bottles of Qi Nourishing Pills, or one bottle of Qi Gathering Pills!"

"Qi Gathering Pills!" Hearing the name of that pill, Lu Xu's heart stirred. Now he was almost certain that this person was most likely that high-grade alchemist.

"I will not be trading away this Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma!" Lu Xu shook his head, rejecting the other party's proposal.

"Daoist friend, you..."

The person seemed somewhat unwilling, froze for a moment, then snorted coldly and turned to leave. He actually walked straight out of the stone chamber. Seeing this, Lu Xu immediately muttered inwardly:

"Check alchemy experience!"
