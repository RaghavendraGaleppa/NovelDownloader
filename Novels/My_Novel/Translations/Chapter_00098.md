Chapter 98: Tiger and Leopard Appear, Fist Technique Kills the Enemy!

Deep within the dense forest and ravines, thunder echoed as a perilous battle unfolded. Lu Xuefeng crawled rapidly on all fours, his movements carrying the posture of a "Tiger and Leopard."

In a few breaths, he had charged before his enemy. Spinning around, he lashed out with a whip-like kick. This move belonged to no specific martial art; it was purely an expression of pure power and speed.

Li Xian raised his hands to block, then pushed down, diverting seven-tenths of the force. However, the remaining three-tenths still shook him, forcing him back continuously.

Lu Xuefeng pursued relentlessly, attacking with ferocious speed, his攻势 like a torrent of raindrops. While retreating, Li Xian remained calm, his "Four Directions Fist" striking out like the wind, parrying the assault while seeking a chance to counterattack.

Dangerous situations arose one after another, the sounds of their battle shaking the heavens.

The sounds of fists and feet striking rang out incessantly.

Seeing that ordinary punches and kicks were difficult to subdue his opponent, Lu Xuefeng unleashed the "Extreme Iron Palm."

This palm technique consisted of twenty-nine moves, each lethal and ruthless. Now, he struck out overwhelmingly, his momentum incredibly fierce.

Fist met palm.

Li Xian was slightly at a disadvantage, yet he remained composed. His eyes darted back and forth, his mind racing without pause. He knew that relying solely on physical strength, he was no match for his opponent.

But he was not without his advantages.

Li Xian’s internal Qi was more condensed. By infusing his moves with more profound internal Qi, he could hold his ground.

The two tangled for several rounds in the forest.

Li Xian’s gaze was steady, but he couldn't help but think to himself that his opponent was difficult to deal with. In terms of martial arts attainment, this Lu Xuefeng was even inferior to "Peng Fox."

However, his powerful physical body made his strength far exceed Peng Fox's.

Furthermore, as his [Tiger and Leopard Physique] revealed itself, it gradually displayed miraculous effects. It was truly difficult to say who would win and who would lose.

"See how powerful your grandfather's [Tiger and Leopard Physique] is! Just wait to die obediently!" During a lull in the battle, Lu Xuefeng's voice rolled like thunder, attempting to shake Li Xian's spirit.

The rumbling of "Chest Drum Thunder Sound" possessed immense deterrence for ordinary martial artists.

Those with weak courage would easily be frightened out of their wits, becoming timid and afraid to strike, or even dying from sheer terror.

Li Xian’s will was tough; naturally, he was not afraid. But he clearly felt that the influence of the thunder added a bit of stickiness to his fist techniques.

They fought and countered.

Lu Xuefeng suddenly thought: "There is no one here. I might as well use this move to take you down quickly, crushing your muscles, skin, and bones! To vent my hatred."

He struck a palm to force Li Xian back, then immediately curled his fingers into a claw. His whole body blurred, and a tiger's roar erupted from within.

Leaping into the air, his claws descended from the sky, his body resembling a tiger shape, pouncing down to kill.

This was the "Tiger Gate Claw."

It was his greatest trump card, one he had never revealed even in front of the leader, Ma Daozi.

He and Ma Daozi were sworn brothers. Thanks to Ma Daozi's support, he learned martial arts and became a leader of the stronghold.

Ma Daozi was a short-sword wielder, best at sword techniques; his fist and foot skills were average. But the true essence of his sword techniques, he never passed on to anyone.

The second, third, fourth, and fifth leaders all practiced basic martial arts like [Extreme Iron Palm] and [Hard Body Skill].

This [Tiger Gate Claw] was something Lu Xuefeng had bought from the black market, using the capital he accumulated from raiding villages.

It was also a basic claw technique, but when executed by him, it displayed a completely different nature.

Its power increased several times over.

Executing the claw brought with it the sound of a tiger's roar.

When he fought, his blood energy churned. Air currents rose from his shoulders, distorting the light and creating colorful, strange phenomena. The moment he executed the [Tiger Gate Claw], he truly resembled a colorful, massive tiger.

The thunderous sound turned into a tiger's roar.

Several claws struck out, and Li Xian retreated repeatedly. Another claw struck directly; Li Xian rolled to the side, hiding behind a tree.

He watched as the hand claw pierced through the tree trunk, its power terrifying, narrowly missing him.

"This man has revealed a strange phenomenon, resembling a tiger or leopard. His speed is incredibly fast, his strength immense. Combining this claw technique with his own transformation, his power has increased out of thin air."

Li Xian analyzed the battle situation and thought to himself:

"In that case, he has shown his full strength. But this transformed body of his... is just about average."

He immediately planted his feet firmly, no longer retreating, his eyes shining with a sharp light.

Qi sank to his feet, as if taking root. He beckoned Lu Xuefeng with a finger.

Lu Xuefeng executed a move called "Strong Tiger Locks the Neck," a claw strike from bottom to top aimed at the opponent's throat, like a fierce tiger strangling its prey.

This move was fierce, but Li Xian raised his hand to block and deflect, his body vibrating slightly. He skillfully borrowed his opponent's force and flung him into the air.

Lu Xuefeng refused to believe it. He twisted in mid-air, using the momentum of his descent to attack ferociously again. However, he was still blocked and deflected, thrown to another spot.

He felt his own strength silently changing direction.

"Come again," Li Xian said calmly, assuming a fist stance. Seeing Lu Xuefeng hesitate, he took the initiative to close in and attack.

Lu Xuefeng refused to show weakness and swung his claws again. But he felt his fierce strength enter a muddy river. Although it could break trees and smash stones, it simply could not reach Li Xian.

It turned out...

This Lu Xuefeng was indeed powerful, favored by heaven, and possessed the [Tiger and Leopard Physique].

In this world, [Transformed Physiques] are varied and strange. This [Tiger and Leopard Physique] is quite average, or even a rather inferior Transformed Physique.

It grants one the characteristics of a tiger or leopard.

When practicing "Tiger and Leopard" related martial arts, one receives a great boost. The martial art and the physique resonate, thereby revealing a strange phenomenon.

Lu Xuefeng was only half a step into "Consuming Essence." Although he had manifested a strange phenomenon, it was still shrouded by the clay shell, merely showing a hint of its potential.

If he continued to consume [Essence Treasures] and grew a bit more, allowing this [Tiger and Leopard Physique] to be fully revealed, he would be extremely powerful in this county.

But his martial arts attainment was shallow. The [Tiger Gate Claw], which he considered his trump card, was only barely proficient.

When executed, although its power was not bad and far superior to the Extreme Iron Palm, if used against an ordinary person, it could indeed secure victory.

Only, Li Xian’s martial arts attainment was profound, possessing a fist technique that had reached its peak.

In his eyes, Lu Xuefeng had both strengths and weaknesses. Overall, however, he was using his shortcoming to attack his opponent's strength.

Li Xian faced a martial artist with a strange physique for the first time and was intimidated by his speed and strength. But after fighting a few rounds, he saw through the essence of his martial art.

If one ignored the strong power and speed, this mere proficient claw technique—how it threw punches, how it exerted force—was self-evident.

It was fast and fierce enough, but lacked refinement, and had no variations.

Whereas the "Four Directions Fist" was exquisite in that it first threw a killing punch, then, through body movements, changed the direction of the force line, making the fist tip turn instantly.

Thus, it defeated the enemy by surprise.

Lu Xuefeng possessed the [Tiger and Leopard Physique], granting him tiger and leopard characteristics. But he also unconsciously inherited the wild beast's straightforward recklessness.

Coupled with his shallow martial arts attainment, his force lines were simple and direct.

Li Xian, having brought the Four Directions Fist to its peak, possessed unparalleled understanding, and naturally executed his punches with exquisite precision.

He used his fist attacks to force Lu Xuefeng to change his posture, inadvertently causing his opponent to change his own force line...

Naturally, although his moves were fierce, they always knocked Li Xian off to the side.

By this time, Lu Xuefeng’s temperament, punching habits, strength, and martial arts attainment had all been thoroughly understood by Li Xian. He was already utterly defeated.

No matter how furious or violent he became, it was just desperate resistance. Lu Xuefeng gradually showed a look of shock, his confidence fading the more he fought.

At this moment, Li Xian poured his full power into his Qi and threw a punch. It was accompanied by a dozen or so afterimages. With a series of "bang bang bang" sounds, he beat Lu Xuefeng into a retreat.

Lu Xuefeng was terrified in his heart: "This kid is strange. I don't know why I can't beat him. I need my big brother!" He had already developed the intention to retreat and tried to break away to escape.

However, Li Xian was born a hunter; he had hunted tigers and leopards and was best at this. After Lu Xuefeng opened up some distance, Li Xian’s feet generated wind. He swallowed a "Body Recovery Pill" and gave chase.

Although his speed was not as fast as Lu Xuefeng's, he was not so easily甩开.

He supplemented this with bow and arrow...

It wasn't long before Lu Xuefeng was hit by several arrows. At this time, the fast-acting poison on the arrow tips began to take effect.

The final arrow shot out.

It pierced through his neck, killing him on the spot!

"Hah!"

Li Xian exhaled a long, turbid breath. His back was covered in cold sweat. Although he had won this battle, it allowed him to taste the vastness of the martial path. It truly possessed a thousand wonders and ten thousand oddities.

"If this man had continued to use palm techniques to fight me, I don't know how long I would have had to tangle with him."

"He usually likes to bully the weak with his strength. Coupled with his limited vision, he only thinks that when he executes his claw technique, his speed is faster and more ruthless, and he can defeat his enemies quicker. Thus, he views the claw technique as his trump card."

"He doesn't realize that this trump card has a huge flaw. In the eyes of someone with far superior martial arts attainment, the openings are even larger!"

"Martial arts duels are not contests of brute force."

Li Xian benefited greatly.

He had not entered the Jianghu, so he did not know its depths. But he knew that if he did not die a violent death, he would eventually have to enter the Jianghu.

Therefore, in everything, he observed the subtle to know the significant, summarizing the minute experiences and lessons, and enriching his Jianghu experience in advance.

Martial artists fight and kill, staking their lives.

It is no child's play, nor is it simple. It must be a combination of daily accumulation and on-the-spot adaptability.

"If I enter the Jianghu in the future, I must not easily underestimate my opponents."

Li Xian added two more arrows.

He confirmed that Lu Xuefeng had no path to survival, then went to search the body.

He obtained a brocade robe. Although it was stained with blood, the patterns were exquisite; it was made of silk.

He searched further.

He found a book with the words "Tiger Gate Claw" written on the cover. Li Xian thought: "This should be the martial art Lu Xuefeng just executed. I shall accept it with a smile."

He hid the book under his clothes.

He took off his long boots. The man was dying, his body temperature still present. Lu Xuefeng had severe athlete's foot; the smell was so bad Li Xian covered his nose and cursed: "Even in death, you stink me out." He shook the boots upside down three times.

There really was a money note inside.

"Qian's Money Shop?"

Li Xian held the money note, waved it in the wind to disperse the smell, then folded it and put it away.

"Cashing money at the shop... there is always risk. This money note should only be used as a last resort when I urgently need money in the future."

Although Li Xian’s Jianghu experience was shallow, he understood the truth of the world well. Once anything in the world involves the word "money," it inevitably becomes ferocious and terrifying.

And among the three hundred and sixty trades...

The money trade must have the deepest waters.

"Solid silver is still better."

He fished out five taels of broken silver, and Li Xian’s mood lifted greatly. Lu Xuefeng had thought in the morning that if he died, would he end up like the third brother?

One thought became prophecy.

Even more thoroughly. Li Xian didn't even let go of his underwear, taking everything of value. He was truly afraid of poverty.

Finally, he buried the body.

He did it cleanly and efficiently.

Black River Village.

At the southern entrance, deep within the dense forest.

Uncle Fu was directing from the front. The young, strong men of the village held iron tools, practicing the formation of farmers killing bandits.

They trained with fiery enthusiasm.

Inside the wooden house.

Li Xian sat cross-legged on the ground, contemplating his recent gains and losses.

"Since coming to Black River Village, I have been free and unfettered, and my martial arts progress has been extremely fast."

"I first brought the Clear Wind Legs to perfection, then brought the Four Directions Fist to its peak. I have fought life and death battles several times, and each time I won by a narrow margin."

"I was able to defeat Peng Fox because my internal Qi was stronger."

"I was able to defeat Lu Xuefeng because my attainment was deeper."

"But these two... ultimately, they are just leaders of a small stronghold in a remote mountain. Although I defeated them, it is not worth celebrating, nor is it worth being arrogant."

Li Xian jumped onto the eaves.

Lying on the snow blanket, his hands behind his head, he chewed on a piece of dried meat.

The internal Qi consumed in the perilous battle in the forest was slowly recovering as he rested.

The two-zhang-sized Qi Lake gradually filled up.

"Still left are the leader and the second leader. I need to prepare traps in advance and be ready to deal with them. But in my opinion... perhaps there is a better way to solve this."

"So I can live peacefully for a few days."

Li Xian’s eyes flashed.

Blindly fighting and killing is the behavior of a reckless man.

Understanding the situation and observing the subtle to know the significant is the way to walk far.
