# Chapter 84: Fierce and Unyielding Progress

The Cicada Strength Art was truly marvelous. Upon reaching perfection, the trembling of bones during exertion would be like the chirping of a cicada, capable of unleashing continuous waves of new power.

His bones had already been tempered into iron, but under the guidance of the Cicada Strength Art, they had actually improved by several degrees.

With his foundation of perfected Bone Tempering, it wouldn't be long before he mastered the Cicada Strength Art as well.

Suddenly, a cold glint flashed between the shadows of the trees.

A silver needle shot out from the nearby woods. Xu Yunfan’s neck hairs stood on end, yet he allowed the needle to strike his Jade Pillow acupoint.

He had no intention of dodging, letting the silver needle collide directly.

*Clang!*

His muscles merely tensed. With his perfected Copper Body Technique, his skin instantly took on a bronze hue. The fascia beneath his skin churned like waves, shattering the hidden weapon into three pieces with brute force.

In the next instant, amidst the crisp sound of the needle breaking, Xu Yunfan took a step. As he turned, his foot arch shattered the bluestone. The muscular, powerful thighs exploded with terrifying explosive power. His figure shot into the jungle like a tiger unleashed from its cage. The cypress tree, thick enough to be encircled by two men, groaned painfully under the impact of his shoulder.

He crashed through several trees as thick as a man's embrace and reached out a large hand to grab the small figure that was frantically retreating.

In the next moment, a cold light flashed. Xu Yunfan’s eyes narrowed slightly. He tilted his head and his iron-clamp-like手掌 seized Chu Xuan’s wrist bone. The少女 cried out in pain and released her grip. In her palm, a poisoned dagger emitted a faint blue glow.

"A Level Sharp Weapon? Fifth Senior Sister's见面礼 (meeting gift) is getting more and more valuable."

"Wah!"

Tears welled up in her eyes as she tilted her neck back at just the right angle, revealing a fragile arc.

"Junior Brother, you're hurting me."

As she spoke, her nails, stained with henna juice, silently stabbed toward Xu Yunfan’s tiger's mouth. Xu Yunfan didn't move a muscle, merely watching the long, sharp nail descend. It was shattered upon impact, eliciting a shriek from Chu Xuan.

Xu Yunfan’s gaze turned icy cold. He looked down at Chu Xuan, who was pinned firmly to the ground, unable to move. With his perfected Copper Body Technique, he naturally feared no ordinary weapon. But if it were a Level Sharp Weapon wielded by a martial artist of the same realm...

It could easily break his defense. Although his muscles would clamp down on it the next second, who knew if the dagger was poisoned?

Chu Xuan was only a First-Rank Martial Master, so there was no need to worry about that. But...

Meeting Chu Xuan's pitiful gaze, Xu Yunfan curled his lips into a sneer. A cold laugh escaped his nose, and the cracking of bones sounded as his knuckles tightened.

He leaned down, looking at Chu Xuan, whose face was showing a hint of panic, so close before him.

This woman had disturbed his training no less than five times in the past month, making him quite displeasing. Although not fatal, it was truly disgusting.

"Fifth Senior Sister, why does the Master have the surname Chen, while you have the surname Chu?"

"Because she is the Master's adopted daughter."

Ning Wuque's voice came from the side, still as calm and gentle as before, carrying a hint of scholarly air.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes and released Chu Xuan.

Ning Wuque was also a Third-Rank Martial Master. Without drawing his Golden Cudgel, Xu Yunfan wasn't confident he could stop the other party immediately. If he tried to kill him without restraint, it would cause quite a stir.

It wasn't worth it. Drawing the Golden Cudgel, this divine weapon, to kill the other party was even less worth it, as it would cause an even greater commotion.

Watching Chu Xuan quickly scramble up and hide behind Ning Wuque, looking pitiful, Ning Wuque sighed as if comforting a child.

"Second Junior Sister just can't learn to be good, always so mischievous. Please don't take it to heart, Junior Brother."

Ning Wuque适时 smoothed the wrinkles on Chu Xuan's sleeve. The sunlight filtering through the leaves illuminated his pale, scholar-like face.

From his seemingly slender chest came a drum-like heartbeat, the sound of surging blood unique to a Third-Rank Martial Master.

Xu Yunfan slowly straightened up. His Bone Tempering cultivation had brought him to a height of nearly 1.98 meters, allowing him to look down slightly at Ning Wuque.

"Senior Brother, you must keep a close eye on Fifth Senior Sister. If she happens to go to the bathroom at night, or accidentally sprains her ankle, breaks a leg, or an arm while going down the mountain, ending up bedridden for life, that wouldn't be good."

Hearing this, Chu Xuan turned pale. The words were extremely blunt; anyone could understand the threat.

"Senior Brother, look at him!"

Ning Wuque's smile had vanished.

"Junior Brother, should I take these words as a threat?"

Xu Yunfan let out a soft laugh. "How could that be? I was just reminding Senior Sister. The roads are slippery in the dark, so be careful. I still have to train, so I won't delay Senior Brother and Fifth Senior Sister's meeting."

With that, he slowly brushed past Ning Wuque, shoulder to shoulder, and walked out of the woods toward the training ground.

Ning Wuque turned, watching Xu Yunfan's retreating figure, especially the iron box that was always with him, carried on his back. A hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.

This iron box had been replaced with a new one, forged from brand-new refined steel.

Then he looked at Chu Xuan, a hint of helplessness on his face.

"Junior Sister, I know you mean well for me, but it's not good to create friction between us brothers and sisters. If you go to the Master to complain, it will only make me, this Senior Brother, seem irresponsible and negligent."

Chu Xuan pouted. "That big guy isn't our Junior Brother. He came from nowhere, suddenly showing up with Senior Uncle Liu's token to apprentice himself. Who knows where he got it from, or what his purpose is in coming to our Cicada Strength Sect."

She paused and let out a soft snort.

"Maybe he's here to compete with you for the Cicada Strength Art! Aside from Senior Brother, I don't want anyone else to become the Sect Master of the Cicada Strength Sect, especially such a shady character. And yet, he's won Father's favor."

Beside Ning Wuque, Chu Xuan showed a young girl's demeanor. This casual remark made Ning Wuque's eyes turn cold. While Chu Xuan was still talking and didn't notice, his piercing gaze was fixed on her.

"..."

Xu Yunfan crushed the last piece of snake gall, letting the bitter bile splatter between his teeth before swallowing it without changing his expression.

This snake gall could strengthen bones and tendons, a rare natural tonic. It was the bile of a unique, specially bred species in the Cicada Strength Sect—the Thunder Snake Gall—which was extremely effective even for a Third-Rank Martial Master's physique.

For the past month, he had been swallowing one snake gall every day. Such treatment made Second Senior Sister Lin Hanyi so jealous that her eyes turned red; she would stare at him unblinkingly every day she saw him.

The way she looked as if she wanted to devour him alive made him feel a bit creeped out.

The Thunder Snakes had been raised by Lin Hanyi for over a decade. There were only three or four hundred of them. Now, Xu Yunfan had eaten thirty in a single month; her heart was bleeding.

These were the foundation of the sect!

An ordinary disciple would see great improvement in their physique and training efficiency after eating just one.

What's more, even Ning Wuque didn't have such a treatment.

Despite this, Lin Hanyi still executed Chen Tiangang's instructions to the letter, without any deviation.

In the secret chamber behind the Ancestral Hall, the rock walls were inscribed with three hundred and sixty diagrams of energy circulation. At the very depths, a skeleton pierced by iron chains maintained the诡异 (bizarre) pose of a reversed-arch spine.

"Wrong!"

Chen Tiangang's cane suddenly struck his lower back. "Your shoulder blades should vibrate like cicada wings!"

The sound of the steel cane striking and the muffled thuds of flesh continued for half an incense stick's time. When Xu Yunfan finally unleashed the Spiral Strength, it struck a stone tablet before him.
