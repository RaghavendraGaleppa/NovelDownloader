# Chapter 5: Enemies at First Step

**The Fearless Sword Technique** consisted of only one stance.  

"Charge forward, fight to the death without retreating"—this was merely a jest. In truth, there was no specific name for its moves. It was an ordinary innate-level sword technique with just this single stance.  

This stance could be both a basic move and a killing technique.  

Using one sword strike after another made it a standard technique. Three consecutive strikes turned it into a killing move, while five strikes elevated it to an ultimate technique. Beyond that, it would surpass the limits of the Fearless Sword Technique itself, becoming an entirely new sword art.  

However, when Tang He personally demonstrated it, Dou Changsheng suddenly realized that the jesting description wasn’t exaggerated at all.  

The Fearless Sword Technique revolved around one word: **courage**.  

Charge forward and fight—that was all there was to it.  

The greater the bravery, the mightier the technique.  

"Fight to the death without retreating" was simple—if thoughts of retreat arose, it meant fear had taken root, weakening the sword technique’s power.  

Was it suitable for Dou Changsheng?  

**Absolutely perfect.**  

Tang He, as expected of a disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect, had selected this technique specifically for Dou Changsheng. Not only was it compatible with the *Triple Origin Reversion Art*, but it was also simple to learn—just this one stance.  

For seven straight days, Dou Changsheng devoted himself to mastering this stance. He practiced to the point of forgetting food and sleep, pushing himself to the brink of obsession.  

Time was tight, and the mission was critical.  

He had no choice but to go all-in, focusing entirely on strengthening this single skill. The Fearless Sword Technique was the fastest path to power.  

Dou Changsheng cherished this opportunity, training diligently while lamenting that if he had studied this hard in his past life, his college entrance exam scores wouldn’t have been so abysmal.  

Tang He tapped Dou Changsheng’s wrist with a wooden stick, correcting his sword posture. He sighed, "There’s no one else here. Why keep pretending?"  

"Even if you knew nothing about swordsmanship, you should at least have the basics down."  

"There are three or four mistakes in your stance alone."  

"*Sigh*."  

"Still, I have to admit—your acting is impeccable. I can’t detect any trace of prior swordsmanship training."  

Tang He shook his head helplessly. No matter how he looked at it, this young man seemed like a complete novice—utterly clueless about martial arts.  

No, worse than that—he knew **nothing**.  

Most of the past seven days had been spent drilling the fundamentals.  

Of course, the basics of swordplay weren’t difficult to grasp—just a handful of repetitive movements. But building a solid foundation required years of relentless practice.  

Time was a luxury they didn’t have, so Tang He focused solely on teaching this one stance.  

**Thrust.**  

Every day, he corrected Dou Changsheng’s mistakes.  

Then, as dusk fell, he would instruct him in the Fearless Sword Technique.  

As twilight approached once more, it was time for another practice session. Tang He watched as Dou Changsheng swung his rusted sword, a surge of innate qi bursting from its tip.  

Three inches of pure white sword light radiated with an indomitable aura.  

Only then did Tang He feel slightly reassured. If not for this innate qi, he would have genuinely doubted Dou Changsheng’s competence.  

Everything else could be faked—but innate qi was undeniable.  

Especially since Tang He had personally sensed its extraordinary purity, far surpassing ordinary innate qi. This wasn’t something any common innate-level martial art could achieve. Though he had never seen the *Triple Origin Reversion Art* of the Xiangzhou Wang Clan, he was certain this was it.  

He couldn’t help but echo Black Eagle Elder’s earlier sentiment.  

Dou Changsheng had practiced the *Triple Origin Reversion Art* for over a decade—it was deeply ingrained, impossible to change. After all, he had already used it to break through to the innate realm. Abandoning it now was out of the question.  

So he had no choice but to continue with it, while pretending ignorance of all other martial arts.  

Truly, he was devoted to his role.  

This "Dou Changsheng" lived up to his identity as a Wang Clan descendant. Since leaving the clan, he had fully embraced the persona of an outsider who had merely stumbled upon a fragment of the *Triple Origin Reversion Art*.  

Tang He had tested this over the past few days. Calling out "Dou Changsheng" in the middle of the night elicited an immediate response—no hesitation, no delay. That alone spoke volumes.  

Moreover, when questioned about the *Triple Origin Reversion Art*, Dou Changsheng only admitted to learning an unnamed, incomplete technique—never acknowledging the true art. Such meticulous attention to detail was impressive.  

Just as Tang He was about to continue coaching Dou Changsheng, Black Eagle Elder returned after several days’ absence.  

Dou Changsheng sheathed his rusted sword, wiped the sweat from his brow, and stepped forward to greet him.  

Black Eagle Elder wasted no time. "Over the past few days, I’ve had decoys pretend to leave the city. The timing is right—we can depart now."  

He turned to Tang He. "Young Brother Tang, you’ve remained hidden since arriving in Jun County. Since you haven’t been exposed, stay in the shadows and follow the real route with the military payroll."  

Then he addressed Dou Changsheng. "That leaves you, Young Brother Dou. You’ll carry a decoy package openly, drawing the enemy’s attention."  

"The contents are fake. If danger arises, prioritize your life over the package."  

Black Eagle Elder’s plan was straightforward. Since both he and Tang He were compromised, they would split up, each carrying a decoy along separate routes. This would force their pursuers to divide their forces, reducing pressure on all fronts.  

Tang He, still undetected, would secretly guard the real payroll.  

Dou Changsheng had no objections. In fact, he felt relieved. If things turned dire, tearing open the package to reveal its falsity would likely save his life.  

Besides, as a latecomer to the mission, it was only natural he wasn’t entrusted with the real payload. He harbored no resentment—it was simple pragmatism.  

However, given his notorious streak of bad luck, Dou Changsheng had to prepare for the worst.  

"Elder, are you absolutely certain my package is fake?"  

This was a life-or-death question—he needed clarity.  

Black Eagle Elder nodded firmly and tossed the package over. Dou Changsheng caught it and slung it across his back.  

"Why not split into three routes?" he suggested. "Since Brother Tang hasn’t been exposed, he could take the real package stealthily to Sword Gate Pass while we draw attention."  

Black Eagle Elder shook his head. "Impossible. This package may look ordinary, but it’s specially designed to suppress energy signatures. The blood of a Pure Yang Grandmaster burns like magma—impossible to conceal without it."  

"Combined with certain tracking arts, splitting into three routes would make it obvious which one is fake."  

"This was a last-minute plan. We only prepared for two routes upon reaching Jun County."  

Dou Changsheng now understood why Black Eagle Elder had insisted on his involvement—he was replacing the deceased swordsman, maintaining the original strategy.  

Of course, Black Eagle Elder might not be entirely truthful. Dou Changsheng hoped that was the case—it would mean the elder was more capable than he appeared, increasing the mission’s chances of success.  

Once the payroll was delivered, he’d no longer be a target.  

Black Eagle Elder adjusted his own package and said to Tang He, "If things go south, don’t risk yourself to save me. Secure the payroll."  

"My life is insignificant—but the border armies must be appeased. We cannot let the barbarians succeed."  

Tang He replied solemnly, "Rest assured, Elder."  

"Upholding justice and saving lives is the foundation of the Heavenly Sword Sect. If I cower from death, I’d be unworthy of my sect."  

"Let’s move out immediately."  

Black Eagle Elder and Tang He were men of action—within moments, they had vanished.  

Meanwhile, Dou Changsheng found himself sealed inside a wine vat, enduring the pungent fumes in darkness.  

The only sounds were muffled shouts, conversations, and the clatter of hooves outside.  

After what felt like an eternity, someone knocked three times on the vat—the prearranged signal.  

Dou Changsheng burst out, accepted a damp towel handed to him, and scrubbed off the stench. The herbal-infused cloth neutralized the alcohol odor effortlessly.  

After changing into fresh clothes, he glanced at the middle-aged attendant, who remained silent. Without a word, Dou Changsheng concealed the package beneath his robes, mounted a waiting horse, and galloped toward Sword Gate Pass.  

As the horse jolted beneath him, Dou Changsheng pondered the many inconsistencies.  

If the fake package could be easily identified, how had the decoys successfully diverted their pursuers these past few days?  

There were countless other questions, but he refrained from asking. The answer was simple—Black Eagle Elder and Tang He were following a prearranged plan backed by greater forces. They wouldn’t act without reason.  

For now, he’d assume the decoys had bought them some time.  

As he rode, Dou Changsheng’s mind wandered. He checked his system—the dormant **[Good Life System]** had unexpectedly issued a new mission.  

**[Beautiful Memory: Time flows like water—two years pass in a blink. At twenty, you return to the northern lands, recalling your younger self, fearless despite lacking cultivation, standing against the Ironclad Lion King, Xiong. You marvel at how the once-invincible Xiong, whose only weakness was his divine gate, is now someone you could slay with a flick of your wrist. Train for one hour. Reward: Basic Sword Technique—Thrust (Mastery)]**  

**[Status: Completed!]**  

What’s better than seeing a new mission?  

**Finding it already completed.**  

It seemed the future Dou Changsheng, despite hoarding all the good fortune, hadn’t achieved his strength through luck alone—he had worked hard.  

Over the past seven days, with Tang He’s guidance, Dou Changsheng had made little progress.  

His movements were error-prone, and even when corrected, his fundamentals remained shaky, easily disrupted.  

This wasn’t due to lack of talent—just insufficient time.  

A month or two of training would have made a world of difference. After all, every master swordsman had honed their skills through years of relentless practice, enduring harsh winters and scorching summers.  

Now, the system’s reward would compensate for his shortcomings—especially the word "mastery," which held extraordinary weight.  

Basic techniques were easy to learn but difficult to perfect. Achieving mastery was a rare feat.  

Dou Changsheng claimed the reward. Instantly, his body underwent subtle changes as memories of rigorous sword training flooded his mind—countless repetitions of the thrust, each movement precise yet mechanical.  

As the mental backdrop shifted from scorching summers to snowy winters, his movements gained an indescribable fluidity, shedding their rigidity.  

Rain and snow alternated endlessly until the vision shattered.  

Now, Dou Changsheng had fully mastered the basic thrust. Though his other skills remained unchanged, the improvement was immediate. His comprehension of the Fearless Sword Technique deepened—many previously obscure points now made sense.  

He couldn’t help but grumble inwardly—the system was stingy. While his thrust had reached mastery, it provided no insights into other techniques.  

It defied logic. Just as growing taller naturally increased strength and stamina, sword mastery should have broader implications. Yet here, it was strictly limited.  

Seven days hadn’t been enough to grasp the Fearless Sword Technique—until now. The basic thrust shared striking similarities with the technique, differing only in advanced qi manipulation.  

Thus, Dou Changsheng achieved a breakthrough.  

Galloping across the plains, a surge of exhilaration filled him. He felt invincible, as if the world lay at his feet.  

For a fleeting moment, he even entertained the reckless thought of seeking out masters to test his skills.  

His bravado lasted less than a minute before the harsh wind brought him back to reality.  

So much for being cool.  

With a calmer mind, Dou Changsheng no longer feared danger as much. Armed with innate qi and the Fearless Sword Technique, he could hold his own against most innate-level opponents for a few exchanges.  

Against lesser foes, quick victories were feasible.  

He might not last in prolonged battles, but three seconds of dominance?  

**That he could manage.**  

It wasn’t glamorous, but it was a far cry from his former helplessness.  

As he tugged the reins, Dou Changsheng’s gaze fell upon a familiar figure ahead.  

**Wang Xiong.**  

Their paths had crossed again—and this time, his old adversary had grown stronger.  

Now, he was an innate-level warrior!
