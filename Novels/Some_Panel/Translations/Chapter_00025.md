## Chapter 25: The Elder of Canglan Sect

The group agreed to go to the Blazing Fire Sea Region in three days. Taking advantage of this time, Yang Ji purchased some equipment: Ten Thunder Bombs, one thousand spirit stones each, a single one enough to severely injure a tenth-level Qi Refining expert, totaling ten thousand. Ten Blazing Tiger Talismans, drawn using the blood and hide of a Level 10 demonic beast, the Blazing Fire Tiger. Once activated, the talisman would transform into a fierce tiger enveloped in flames, capable of harming a tenth-level Qi Refining expert, lasting for thirty breaths. After thirty breaths, the talisman's energy would be exhausted. Ten talismans, costing ten thousand.

In addition, Yang Ji spent ten thousand spirit stones to buy a dose of "Ice Clarity Fluid." After consumption, its effects would last for one day, allowing him to walk through rolling magma without suffering any burns. His magic artifacts also underwent a significant upgrade. The Water Strider Boat was replaced with a top-grade artifact, possessing eighteen restrictions within, offering higher defense and greater speed, costing ten thousand spirit stones. The Sky-soaring Sword was replaced with the Flowing Light Sword. This flying sword glowed with light, made from Nine-Turn Pig Iron, capable of slicing low-grade artifacts like mud. With this sword, his strength greatly increased. The Flowing Light Sword also cost ten thousand.

All in all, he spent fifty thousand. If the mission succeeded, he would still have to pay Chen De thirty thousand, and the other five people ten thousand each. Such a huge sum, in the past, Yang Ji couldn't have afforded even by selling himself. But after becoming an alchemist, he was making a fortune daily. In the past two years, he had completely cleared out Jin Dafu's spiritual herb warehouse, earning over three hundred thousand spirit stones. Truly a sudden wealth. Excluding the one hundred twenty thousand for purchasing forty sets of Spirit Essence Pill materials, and the fifty thousand already spent as mentioned above, he still had a full one hundred thirty thousand spirit stones on him.

No wonder they say the alchemist profession is profitable; it's indeed true. However, this was also thanks to his superb alchemy skills. If it were other alchemists, their earnings would be greatly reduced, and they definitely wouldn't make this much. Earning a lot also meant spending a lot, but Yang Ji wouldn't use it carelessly, keeping the remaining spirit stones for unforeseen needs. Although Yang Ji and Huoyuan were not planning to descend into the most dangerous areas, they still made thorough preparations for it. With all preparations complete, Yang Ji quietly waited.

Three days passed quickly. On the morning of the third day, Yang Ji, Huoyuan, Xu Xiangsong, and the other five people set out to sea together by boat. As for Chen De, he wasn't with them. After the discussion that day, he had set out to sea alone, saying he would meet them in the Blazing Fire Sea Region three days later. The journey was swift; after a day of rapid travel, the group had arrived before the Blazing Fire Sea Region. Behind them was incredibly cool, while before them was a scorching expanse, truly a duality of ice and fire.

Everyone looked around, and Liu Yongqing said, "Senior Chen hasn't arrived yet. Let's wait." Everyone nodded. With a Foundation Establishment expert not yet present, they certainly didn't dare to proceed. The rogue cultivators all held the belief that it was acceptable not to earn spirit stones, but their lives must be preserved. Such a thought was understandable, and Yang Ji, comprehending, waited with them.

A short while passed, and a large ship finally sped over from the left side of the sea. Standing at the bow of the ship was none other than the refined and gentle-looking Chen De, resembling a secular scholar. Beside him was another person, also a middle-aged man, dressed in a gray robe, around forty years old, with a fair, beardless face, and a faint smile like Chen De's, appearing quite cheerful and kind. Before the group could examine them closely, two streaks of light descended sharply onto the ship's bow, revealing Chen De and the middle-aged man flying together.

Witnessing such imposing power, Yang Ji's heart tightened. A Foundation Establishment expert? He focused his gaze, and information immediately appeared on the middle-aged man: [Golden Core True Monarch, has used a transformation spell to alter his original appearance.] Golden Core True Monarch? Altered his original appearance? For some reason, an ominous feeling arose in Yang Ji's heart.

Immediately, Chen De's smiling introduction was heard: "Everyone, this is Senior Changlin from Seeking Leaf Island. Like me, he is also an early-stage Foundation Establishment expert. For safety's sake, I traveled tens of thousands of miles by ship over the past three days to invite him to join this beast hunting operation. Fortunately, he made it." He then explained with a smile towards Huoyuan, "Oh, and by the way, Fellow Daoist Changlin's participation this time is purely out of friendship and doesn't require any spirit stone payment from Master Huoyuan."

"With Senior Changlin joining us, this operation is bound to be extremely smooth," Xu Xiangsong and the other five beamed with joy, highly deferential, and all cupped their hands in salute to Changlin. With two Foundation Establishment experts participating in this beast hunting operation, it would surely be foolproof. They felt like they were simply picking up spirit stones and were incredibly happy. Similarly, Huoyuan was overjoyed, immediately cupping his hands and smiling, "With Fellow Daoist Changlin joining us, we are sure to return with great gains."

"Fellow Daoist Huo, rest assured, I, Chang, will definitely give my all!" Changlin cupped his hands and smiled meaningfully.

Everyone was delighted, except Yang Ji, who frowned. Why did this person change his appearance, hide his cultivation, and refuse spirit stone payment? What was his intention? Was there such a good thing? Just as he was suspecting, he saw information appear above Changlin's head: [Xiao De, are you saying the demonic beast they are hunting this time might possess beast fire?]

He stood with his hands behind his back, quite imposing, his eyes slightly narrowed as he gazed at the Blazing Fire Sea Region, clearly communicating telepathically with Chen De beside him. Chen De smiled faintly, and information also appeared above his head: [Senior, my guess should be correct. That Huoyuan deliberately concealed things, likely coming for the beast fire. If it were just for the demonic beast's inner core, why would he be so mysterious?]

Changlin chuckled softly: [If that's the case, then all the better. My little nephew has quite a talent for alchemy, becoming a peak alchemist at such a young age. If he had beast fire, he could advance even further.]

[Xiao De, your timely notification was well done. If this truly succeeds, you can come to Canglan Sect and become an external affairs elder.]

Chen De's expression lit up: [My Foundation Establishment method was originally bestowed by senior. It is my honor to do things for senior.]

Changlin nodded with satisfaction: [You have served as a retainer in my Chang family for decades, working diligently without complaint. You deserve all this.]

Chen De smiled, his posture slightly inclined, concealing his due respect: [That is all I should do.]

"This guy actually has designs on the beast fire!" Seeing this, Yang Ji's expression couldn't help but sink. *Chen De!*

Just as his anger flared, Changlin's gaze shifted, suddenly falling upon him, instantly making his expression tense: [This young one has the ability to sense fortune and danger?]

[Yes, Senior, it's him.] Chen De nodded slightly.

[Oh? Then today I shall see what's so miraculous about him!] Changlin smiled meaningfully.

Yang Ji felt like strangling Chen De. Just then, Changlin spoke: "Since everyone is here, let's depart. This young friend's cultivation is the lowest, so you shall lead the way. I will protect you from behind."

"Fellow Daoist Chang, that won't do. He's my medicine boy and needs to stay by my side," Huoyuan said, his expression slightly changing, and then transmitted, "Master, this Changlin seems a bit off."

More than "off," he was greatly off!

Just as Yang Ji was about to speak, he heard Chen De speak pretentiously: "Young Friend Yang's cultivation is too low, so leading the way might be inappropriate. However, with Young Friend's ability to sense fortune and danger, going first is also the most suitable. What do you all think? Young Friend Yang, what do you say?"

"Young Friend, feel free to go down. We will definitely protect you from behind." Xu Xiangsong and the others laughed. They were naturally happy to have someone scout ahead, especially since this person could also sense fortune and danger.

Chen De looked at Changlin, and information appeared above his head: [Senior, I've interacted with this Yang boy. He speaks meticulously and is quite shrewd. I'm worried he won't be willing to go down.]

[Hmph! Unwilling to go down? Then I'll just have to shamelessly throw him down. Anyway, I've already changed my appearance, so I might as well act like a demonic cultivator this once. If Huoyuan also doesn't cooperate, I'll throw him down as well. After all, beast fire is hard to find, and I don't want to return empty-handed.] Changlin's smile didn't reach his eyes.

Yang Ji was just about to transmit a message to Huoyuan, telling him to cancel this operation, but seeing the information above Changlin's head, he was so infuriated he almost vomited blood. *Old scoundrel, can't you find one yourself? You're stealing my fortune!*

Yang Ji was naturally extremely unwilling and even thought about turning hostile on the spot, but after much deliberation, his expression couldn't help but sink slightly. Circumstances were stronger than him. If he miscalculated, the other party might just finish him off instantly. *His strength was still too low.*

Yang Ji sighed inwardly. He was truly in a dilemma at this moment. After pondering for a moment, he could only calmly smile and say: "This junior is indeed a little scared to lead the way, but if I have two Foundation Establishment seniors protecting me from behind, this junior is willing to boldly act as the vanguard scout."

His words were delivered with conviction. Yang Ji truly felt incredibly hypocritical at this moment. His heart was filled with extreme resentment, yet he still had to flatter and smile.

[Heh, this kid is quite sensible. After all, I am an elder of the Canglan Sect. If I truly did something that forced people into a corner, my old face wouldn't be able to handle it.] Changlin looked at Yang Ji with considerable satisfaction.

*Elder of Canglan Sect? Hypocrite, you'll remember this!* Yang Ji smiled and glanced at him, the corner of his eye twitching imperceptibly.
