# Chapter 399: Why is the Ice Cube Secretly Looking at Me?

In a small town thirty miles from the Ke Tree Mountain.

Inside a dark room.

Several black shadows sat around a table, seemingly deep in thought. Amidst the eerie silence, there was a hint of seriousness.

After a long while, a shadow that was clearly female spoke up.

"Why aren't we lighting a lamp?"

"What we're doing cannot see the light."

This was a serious and earnest male voice.

"Besides, it adds to the atmosphere of scheming and intrigue."

"?"

One might say he was sick in the head, yet he showed a surprising amount of professional dedication.

The woman fell silent for a few seconds, dropping the issue. "How goes the task I assigned?"

"Rest assured, I handle things well. I've hired several storytellers from under the bridge to describe in detail the conflict between Li Mo and Ying Bing with the Crown Prince. Any force gathering here will know they have offended His Highness."

Another shadow raised its head as it spoke.

"So... the storyteller who said that the Crown Prince's sword attendant, Dan Hong, was beaten into a wailing, pig-headed mess who lost control of his bowels... was one of your people?"

The woman seemed to take a deep breath, struggling to suppress her rage.

A moment of silence hung in the air.

The situation was incredibly awkward.

Finally, the male voice cleared his throat. "Don't get worked up. This was all done according to your requirements."

"When did I ever say I wanted to be described as another wailing, incontinent pig?"

"Think about it. The more miserable you seem, doesn't that prove how deeply Li Mo and Ying Bing have offended the Crown Prince? The more it will leave them with no place to stand?"

"When the strong who wish to serve the Crown Prince see this, won't they be more willing to step forward and remove this thorn in His Highness's side for him?"

Indeed, the woman in the darkness was Dan Hong.

She let out a cold snort, conceding the point, and moved on. "And if no one makes a move?"

"No problem. I've hired an assassin from the Drizzle Tower. Years ago, he ranked in the top five of the Earthly Fiends. Later, he defected from the Drizzle Tower and joined the Demon Summoning Cult. The Jianghu calls him 'The Indiscriminate Beast, Leaving Neither Chicken nor Dog'."

"Is he reliable?" Dan Hong narrowed her eyes.

"He is a professional. There is no need to worry."

The male shadow chuckled. "He has even successfully assassinated a Fifth Realm Outer Scenery expert before, not to mention a mere Divine Observation cultivator. Once he enters the Ke Tree Mountain, he has a ninety percent chance of making sure those two are buried there."

Only then did Dan Hong relax slightly. She took out a box containing the deposit.

The shadow took the money and vanished from the spot.

Not long after.

Under the bridge by the roadside, figures were scattered about. Three shouts echoed from the street.

A storyteller appeared under the bridge once more. He scanned the passersby with his cross-eyed gaze, then put on his long gown and slapped the table.

"The Cold Fairy is truly peerless in her elegance and beauty. She is the first to rank higher on the Hundred Flowers List than on the Hidden Dragon List."

"She fought two Inner Scenery experts single-handedly! Even the Crown Prince's sword attendant is nothing but a wild chicken compared to her phoenix."

"That battle was magnificent. Esteemed audience, let me tell you all about it in detail."

*Clink, clatter, clank—*

Various tips were thrown onto the stage.

Inside a carriage passing by on the road.

"News has traveled to the Ke Tree Mountain this quickly?"

"Listen to that, the storytelling has some of the old man's flair..."

Li Mo was a bit surprised, but then nodded as if it were only natural.

The Cold Fairy was indeed peerlessly elegant and beautiful. He could attest to that.

After all, the soft, warm, and tender palm was still in his hand—cool to the touch, yet not making him feel cold at all.

"Ice Cube, what are you looking at?"

"A phenomenon."

Ying Bing gazed toward the direction of the Ke Tree Mountain.

This phenomenon was indeed very similar to the Heavenly Phoenix Domain she had taken away in the Imperial Capital in her previous life.

So, the Heavenly Phoenix Domain should have been in the Imperial Capital.

The floating city that existed because of it—the Sacred Treasure for condensing an Inner Scenery Field—had been in the Imperial Capital for many years, becoming a divine intent that many geniuses observed.

For instance, a part of its shadow could be seen in Jiang Yu's divine intent.

So, what was the one in the Ke Tree Mountain?

And what exactly was the Heavenly Phoenix Domain she had obtained in her previous life?

Li Mo followed her gaze and saw a magnificent city in the sky, like a mirage.

Its structure was also very strange, not like a product of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Before long.

The phenomenon slowly faded, transforming into a flock of miraculous birds that vanished into the heavens and earth.

Outside the carriage, waves of exclamations immediately rang out.

"The strange sight is gone. Has the spiritual and malevolent energy of the Ke Tree Mountain finally returned to the heavens and earth?"

"Does this mean we can go in now?"

"A geomancer said this tomb is fraught with great danger and terror. It won't be easy to come out unscathed if you go down."

"Fortune favors the bold!"

For a moment, sword lights shot into the sky, and people spurred their horses to rush toward it.

But in Li Mo's eyes, the scene of the phenomenon slowly fading was a bit familiar.

"Ice Cube, does this have something to do with things like the Jade Phoenix God or the Blood Phoenix Essence?"

"Mm." Ying Bing nodded seriously.

"Good, we must seize it!"

Little Li's eyes lit up, his enthusiasm piqued.

What could be more fragrant than the Ice Cube? (Meaning the investment feedback)

"I'm still not sure..."

"Then we'll go and find out together!"

Li Mo took her hand and stood up. After putting the carriage into his spatial artifact, he enveloped them both in clouds and shot into the sky.

The wind howled past their ears.

Ying Bing gathered her fluttering hair with one hand while looking at the side profile of his face in a daze.

The少年 (young man) had a face full of enthusiasm and drive, just like in a dream when he excitedly wanted to take her, as a child, to play outside.

But...

The thing inside had nothing to do with him.

It was her own desire to find out...

"Ice Cube, why are you secretly looking at me?"

"I'm not."

Hand in hand, they flew into the clouds, heading toward the Ke Tree Mountain.

Their figures were naturally recognized by many. After all, the Ice Cube, upon appearing, was as distinct and outstanding as the bright, cold moon in the night sky, impossible to ignore.

Amidst the exclamations, under the bridge, the cross-eyed storyteller narrowed his eyes and took off his long gown.

...

P.S.: Jiang Yu will not be whitewashed. Wait for the follow-up from the little author. The character settings are set in stone; they just haven't been fully revealed yet.

I've been updating three chapters every day this month without a break, so the little author is a bit tired.

Please give me some support with your power stones, hehe~
