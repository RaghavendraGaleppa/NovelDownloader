# Chapter 4: The Great Aphid

Suppressing his surging emotions, Ding Rui held his breath and focused his mind, channeling more true essence into the spirit rice. He then moved forward, one by one, to the location of that aphid. He couldn't pour a large amount of true essence in all at once, as that would cause immense damage to the inside of the spirit rice stalk.

Soon, a slightly larger block of *Golden Radiance Art* true essence condensed at the aphid's location. Ding Rui took a deep breath, controlling the true essence to strike at the aphid! Aphids were weak pests, not very aggressive. Everything that happened inside the spirit rice was a scene Ding Rui perceived, judged, and imagined based on the sensation of his true essence within the stalk. With his cultivation at the first level of the Qi Condensation stage, he couldn't even perform inner vision, let alone use spiritual sense to probe the situation inside the spirit rice.

Ding Rui tightly closed his eyes, controlling the true essence to strike at the aphid again and again. As time passed, he became more and more skilled, and the shape of that true essence mass also began to change. From an irregular long strip, it gained a head and a tail. The front was sharp like a spearhead, the body was smooth and rounded, shaped like a streamlined small fish, and the tail also ended with a sharp spearhead.

"Host has comprehended a skill. Please choose whether to add the skill to the skill bar and name it!"

Despite his closed eyes, Ding Rui smiled. With a thought, another skill appeared in his mind's skill bar.

[Golden Radiance Spear]

The second stalk of spirit rice, the third, the fourth... Ding Rui's speed was even faster than Old Huang, who had been killing insects for over ten years. However, while he was dealing with the sixth stalk of spirit rice, an unexpected situation arose!

An aphid blocked his way and launched a fierce attack on him!

*Buzz...*

Ding Rui felt a roar echo in his mind and almost fainted. This was a reaction caused by his true essence being hit, and the spiritual sense attached to it being jolted. This was purely because he was unprepared; otherwise, he wouldn't have felt such intense discomfort. The moment his true essence was hit, Ding Rui knew he had encountered a Great Aphid, far stronger than an ordinary one!

Normal aphids posed little threat and mostly fled when attacked. But if an aphid lived for more than three days or possessed exceptional talent, it could evolve into a Great Aphid. Great Aphids were larger in size, had harder exoskeletons, and developed sharp proboscises, allowing them to bite and devour spirit rice more easily. They could also effectively resist a cultivator's attacks! They could even bite onto true essence and grind it into pieces. If one encountered a Great Aphid and had their true essence shattered, not only would that portion of true essence be lost, but the spiritual sense attached to it would also be damaged.

A moment later, he felt that two spears weren't enough, so he used the skill again. Immediately, another Golden Radiance Spear took shape. He now controlled three Golden Radiance Spears, thrusting forward, retreating, thrusting forward, retreating...

At the same time, his mental focus was highly concentrated. If one of the Golden Radiance Spears was about to disperse, he would quickly withdraw it back into his body and simultaneously condense another to replace it. The three long spears darted around inside the spirit rice stalk, and the previously arrogant Great Aphid was immediately disoriented. When it attacked one spear, two others would strike it. With only one proboscis, one mouth could not contend against three spears.

Ding Rui grew braver with each clash, urging the three long spears to force the Great Aphid to retreat again and again. Eventually, it actually began to flee!

Chasing after a fleeing Great Aphid was not very realistic. Even if an ordinary cultivator could defeat a Great Aphid, they might not have a way to pursue and kill it, so they would often have to give up. They would then immediately pull out and discard the entire stalk of spirit rice that housed the Great Aphid. This was to prevent the Great Aphid, after harming one spirit rice stalk, from moving to another through the connecting points between the stalks.
