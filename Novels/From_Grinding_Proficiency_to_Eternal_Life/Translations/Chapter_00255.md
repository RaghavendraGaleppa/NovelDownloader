Chapter 255: White Jade Palace

“Someone is coming,” he said calmly.

Su Zhenhe was startled by the news. He quickly stepped forward to look in the direction of Xu Yunfan’s gaze. Indeed, he saw a group of people rapidly approaching the White Jade Palace from the mountain path in the distance.

They wore dark golden tight-fitting garments embroidered with the pattern of nine rotating suns. As they moved, their aura was condensed and steady, clearly indicating that their cultivation was not to be underestimated.

“The Celestial Treading Steps of the Nine Luminaries Sect!” Su Zhenhe’s eyes trembled slightly in shock.

“Look at the leader. It should be Zhou Tianyan, the chief disciple of the Tianquan Peak of the Nine Luminaries Sect. Brother Xu, aren’t you worried they’ll get there first?”

Xu Yunfan’s lips curled slightly, but he didn’t answer. He just watched quietly, showing no intention of moving to stop them. Instead, he stood calmly with his arms crossed, as if waiting for a good show to unfold.

Seeing Xu Yunfan’s demeanor, Su Zhenhe couldn’t help but ask, “Brother Xu, although the Nine Luminaries Sect doesn’t have the deep heritage of the Sword Pavilion or the Xuanzhen Sect, it is still a top-tier sect in Yanbei Dao. That Zhou Tianyan is a peerless genius of his generation. His ‘Four Symbols Fixed Star Instrument’ technique from the *Nine Luminaries Heavenly Star Sutra* is unparalleled, even surpassing his own master. In the previous secret realm, he once suppressed Pei Yan to the point where he could barely draw his sword. If they enter the palace first, I’m afraid…”

“It’s fine,” Xu Yunfan said in a flat tone, his eyes still fixed on the group. “Let them try first.”

“A White Jade Palace that hasn’t been opened for two thousand years. If it were truly so easy to enter, why would those supreme Grandmasters of the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining, whom you mentioned, have failed to come out?” Xu Yunfan secretly circulated the Pure Yang One Qi Technique in his palm. With the microscopic perception brought by the Marrow Cleansing Realm, he could clearly capture the surging, powerful blood energy among the Nine Luminaries Sect members.

This blood energy far exceeded that of ordinary martial artists at the same realm. This group of people must be the true传 disciples and elites of the Nine Luminaries Sect, the only ones qualified to practice this *Nine Luminaries Swallowing Qi Technique*.

*Nine Luminaries Swallowing Qi Technique!*

Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred slightly, and his eyes shone brightly. This small world secret realm was truly a treasure land; everyone who came here seemed to be bringing him gifts of cultivation techniques.

Su Zhenhe felt a chill in his heart. Xu Yunfan wanted to use the Nine Luminaries Sect members to test the way!

After all, the origin of this White Jade Palace was mysterious, and no one who had entered in the past two thousand years had ever returned. Rushing in recklessly would be unpredictable and dangerous.

Down below, the Nine Luminaries Sect members had already arrived at the palace gates. The leader raised his hand and pressed against the palace doors, seemingly intending to force them open.

However, the moment his palm touched the door leaf, the five ancient characters on the lintel suddenly blazed with piercing golden light, and a vast brilliance erupted with a bang!

“Boom!”

The members of the Nine Luminaries Sect were struck as if by lightning, instantly sent flying by the sword qi. Two of them vomited blood on the spot, their aura withering.

Disappointment flashed in Xu Yunfan’s eyes. “They didn’t even die?”

Xu Yunfan’s eyes flickered. It seemed that although the spiritual energy of heaven and earth still existed within this small world secret realm over these two thousand years, it had ultimately been decreasing day by day. The White Jade Palace was, after all, an inanimate object. Although this place was the center of the small world secret realm, the mountain terrain did not converge, so the spiritual energy simply could not gather.

Two thousand years ago, this naturally wouldn’t have been a problem, but over these two thousand years of spiritual energy dissipation, it had become a fatal flaw. Given two thousand years, even if the White Jade Palace had heaven-defying abilities, it must have been weakened to an unimaginable extent.

Although the Nine Luminaries Sect members were repelled by the sword qi, the cold-faced leader, Zhou Tianyan, showed no panic. He even let out a cold laugh and drew a crimson longsword from behind his back.

The blade was long and narrow like a crescent moon, and the edge seemed to have blood-colored patterns flowing on it. The moment it was unsheathed, it emitted a dragon-like tremor, actually pushing the residual clear light back thirty feet!

“The Nine Burning Sword?” Su Zhenhe’s pupils constricted, and he couldn’t help but exclaim, “The Nine Luminaries Sect actually gave this sect-guarding divine weapon to Zhou Tianyan!”

Xu Yunfan also stared intently at the longsword in Zhou Tianyan’s hand, unable to blink.

He had seen a record of this sword in the *Yanbei Dao Weapon Record*. It was said to have been tempered with earth’s core fire marrow for a hundred years. On the day it was forged, it attracted nine heavens’ thunder and fire, making it a genuine Seventh Rank divine weapon.

He had previously heard Fu Jin boast drunkenly that the Nine Luminaries Sect had forcefully invited the Grandmaster of the Divine Weapon Ridge to go to the Nine Luminaries Sect to temper this sword, consuming the efforts of two generations of大师 capable of forging divine weapons from the Divine Weapon Ridge.

Zhou Tianyan bit the tip of his tongue and spat a mouthful of essence blood onto the sword’s body.

Instantly, the sword patterns lit up with a piercing blood light, and the shadows of nine rotating suns appeared from the blade.

He let out a furious roar, grasped the sword with both hands, and unleashed a full-power strike toward the White Jade Palace’s doors.

*Boom!*

*Crack!*

The moment the sword light collided with the ancient characters on the lintel, it felt as if the entire mountain peak trembled violently. The already half-broken mountain body shook, causing rocks to tumble down, nearly burying the White Jade Palace.

The five characters infused with clear light were actually chopped until their golden light dissipated, while the light emitted from Zhou Tianyan’s blade shattered inch by inch. Amidst the splashing sparks, the blade forcefully wedged three inches into the door gap!

Even the ten-thousand-foot clear light shooting straight into the clouds completely vanished.

“Open!”

Zhou Tianyan’s face was ferocious, the muscles on his arms bulging as the blood patterns on the sword body frantically absorbed the surrounding spiritual energy.

Accompanied by a grating sound of metal twisting, the gap cut open slowly expanded to the width of two fingers. The clear light overflowing from within instantly caused the flesh of the three Nine Luminaries Sect disciples at the very front to dissolve!

Xu Yunfan stared at the longsword that was gradually developing cracks and suddenly let out a sneer. “Using a divine weapon as a sacrifice? Truly ruthless.”

He saw that the blood patterns on the sword body were dimming at a speed visible to the naked eye. It was clear that Zhou Tianyan was willing to destroy this inherited divine weapon to force the door open.

Beside him, Su Zhenhe couldn’t restrain himself and said, “Zhou Tianyan is willing to shatter the divine weapon just to enter. He must know the secrets inside! Brother Xu?!”

As he spoke, Zhou Tianyan had already flashed into the palace, and the surviving Nine Luminaries Sect disciples followed closely behind.

Only the Nine Burning Sword, which was nearly covered in cracks, was left behind.

“What a pity…”

Ignoring Su Zhenhe’s anxiety, Xu Yunfan couldn’t help but sigh. “Its spirituality is completely gone. A divine weapon that once shook Yanbei has ended up in such a state in the end.”

After all, as the most talented individual in the Forging Hall of the Heavenly Work Cave, someone who could casually forge sharp-grade weapons, seeing such a divine weapon wasted and destroyed like this…

“These people are truly detestable.”

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. With a tap of his foot, he shot toward the White Jade Palace like an arrow leaving the string.

Su Zhenhe hurriedly followed.

“Brother Xu, wait! The five characters on the palace lintel are said to be ancient仙 scripts, containing astonishing offensive and killing methods. My Xuanzhen Sect seniors speculated that there might be a specific condition required to enter safely…”

“The few from the Nine Luminaries Sect have already gone in, and you’re still babbling here.”

Su Zhenhe was instantly rendered speechless.

As they spoke, the five ancient characters on the palace lintel suddenly lit up with piercing clear light.

Xu Yunfan instantly felt a vast, sea-like aura pressing against him, forcing him to take a step back. The force he卸下的 under his feet actually carved out a three-inch footprint in the ground.

The *Refined Steel Hundred-Forged Body* activated automatically, and a metallic luster appeared on his skin.

Su Zhenhe’s face turned pale. “Brother Xu, be careful! According to the sect records, the clear light from the White Jade Palace’s lintel grows stronger with resistance! That Zhou Tianyan also relied on the collision of the divine weapon to find a gap and rush in.”
