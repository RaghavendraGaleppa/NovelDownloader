# Chapter 6: Object Manipulation

After a long while, Qin Ziling finally regained his composure. He sat cross-legged once more, forming hand seals.

This time, he quickly stabilized his soul again. Pinpoints of starlight entered the crown of his head, filling him not only with a refreshing clarity but also a growing sense of power.

"According to the 'Indestructible Stellar River Contemplation Art,' the world is like an ocean, the body is a boat crossing it, and the soul is the passenger within. If the soul does not reside within the body, it will drown. But if the soul is strong and resilient, it can leap out of the boat and ride the waves. My soul is growing stronger—could it now leap out of the boat?"

This thought flashed through Qin Ziling's mind, and he recalled the method for soul projection described in the "Indestructible Stellar River Contemplation Art."

He envisioned himself walking onto the deck of a ship and then leaping into the sea.

With this leap, Qin Ziling suddenly felt his entire body lighten, as if he were floating weightlessly above his desk. He could see everything around him, including his own body sitting cross-legged below.

"I can see myself?" Qin Ziling was startled by the eerie sight before realizing his soul had successfully left his body. A wave of joy and disbelief washed over him.

"I've reached the Soul Projection stage!" Overjoyed, he floated down beside his physical form and attempted to flip through a book on the desk.

Though souls are formless and intangible, Qin Ziling didn't pass through the book as expected. Instead, he managed to turn its pages—though the normally light book now felt as heavy as if it were bound with sheets of iron.

"Manipulating physical objects—this is the Object Manipulation stage!" The sight left him as astonished as if he'd seen a ghost in broad daylight.

Li Mo had trained for eighty years to reach the stage beyond Object Manipulation—the Soul Division stage. Though Li Mo had mastered it to the point of effortlessly controlling objects and even imprinting soul seals on corpses to manipulate them remotely, Qin Ziling's achievement was staggering in comparison.

Li Mo's eighty years of painstaking cultivation paled against Qin Ziling's leap from novice to Object Manipulation in mere moments. The difference between them was like night and day.

After calming down, Qin Ziling mused, "The heavens truly favor those who are reborn. Reaching Object Manipulation in my first attempt must be due to my soul merging two complete souls and one fragment—especially since Li Mo was once a Soul Division cultivator. That's the only explanation for skipping straight to this level."

Unable to contain his curiosity, he willed his invisible soul-form not to exit through the open window but to pass directly through the wall. 

A sudden pressure surrounded him, vanishing just as quickly as he emerged in the courtyard.

"Souls really can pass through walls!" Staring at his physical body inside, Qin Ziling felt both stunned and exhilarated.

In his past life, he'd suffered from ALS, robbed of even basic mobility. Though this world was a chaotic, impoverished place, he now possessed freedoms he'd never dared dream of before—soaring through the skies, traversing walls and mountains, moving with the wind.

Buoyed by excitement, his soul hovered half a meter above the ground and rode the breeze toward the city.

Under the moonlit sky, Qin Ziling's spirits rose higher as he flew. Reciting a line of poetry—"I long to ride the wind and return, yet fear the jade towers' chill heights"—he grew curious and soared toward the moon.

But the higher he flew, the more strained he felt. The cold wind threatened to freeze and scatter his soul. At about a thousand meters, he could endure no more and descended, continuing toward the city.

Testing his speed, he found that faster movement made his soul feel breathless and unstable. When he ventured about two kilometers from Anhe Village, he lost all connection to his body. A primal fear gripped him—as if going further would leave him a wandering ghost.

He turned back immediately.

On the return journey, he spotted a group heading toward the Xu Family Fort outside the city. Each radiated a blood-qi aura, especially a tall man on a cloud-leopard steed. To Qin Ziling's sight, the man blazed like a torch in the night, radiating such intense heat that approaching him felt perilous.

The group passed unaware, and Qin Ziling returned home.

"Li Mo's fragmented memories mentioned true soul cultivators, soul-slaying spells, and martial artists whose sheer vitality can repel souls. It seems true. Though I've reached Object Manipulation, it's unearned—more like half a step into the stage. My soul is still weak, limited in speed, altitude, and range. And my body is even weaker; without my soul, it grows frail."

"Soul techniques must be used sparingly, and I must strengthen my body. The body is the boat—only when it's strong can the soul dwell securely and grow." Returning to his body, Qin Ziling felt mentally drained. Soul cultivation, though profound, had many constraints and was exhausting. Prolonged separation from his body weakened it further.

Recalling the armed group and fragmented memories, Qin Ziling resisted the thrill of his new abilities. Instead, he grew cautious, wary of overconfidence.

After this self-admonishment, he focused inward, visualizing himself seated within an endless stellar river, absorbing starlight to fortify his soul. Gradually, fatigue overwhelmed him, and he ceased cultivation to sleep.

The next morning, Qin Ziling awoke refreshed, the previous day's blood loss forgotten. After breakfast, he packed the meal Ying Ranyue had prepared for his martial school and set off for the city.
