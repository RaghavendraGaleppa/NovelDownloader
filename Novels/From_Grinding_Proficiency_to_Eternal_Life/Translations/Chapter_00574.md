# Chapter 574: The Thunderous Desolate Land

The Battle Prodigy's Combat Formula, the Battle Character, operated frantically. The vital essence, blood, and primordial energy within his body instantly boiled and burned, transforming into a torrential and peerless violent magical power that surged and roared along his meridians.

The Northern Dipper Purple Weasel Suppressive Evil True Qi, obtained from the True Martial Subduing Demons Canon, also began to bolster his body, making his magical power even more abundant and allowing him to draw upon the celestial stars for his own use.

The Martial Dao Sky Eye also opened between his eyebrows, fixedly staring at the three of them.

The fatigue from the previous great battle was swept away, replaced by an unstoppable, heaven-shaking, and earth-shattering激昂 war intent.

His aura climbed steadily, reaching the limits of the Foundation Establishment mid-stage in the blink of an eye.

If he had not cultivated the innate golden nature, his magical power, which was already thick and profound, would have far surpassed that of a typical late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Facing the encirclement and assassination of three true Foundation Establishment cultivators, Xu Yunfan did dare not be careless. Aside from not using the Character of Calm, he had essentially exhausted all his methods, excluding the three Golden Core sword qi strokes given to him by the Pure Yang Ancestor.

Simultaneously, within his eyes, purple thunder surged and churned.

His hands joined together before his chest, and his ten fingers flew like phantoms. Each flick and movement pulled at the rampaging thunder primordial energy within the Five Thunders Inverse Yuan Lock Heaven Array.

Mysterious and profound thunder scripts flowed from his fingertips, branding themselves into the void and merging with the Lock Heaven Array patterns.

"Divine霄 Orthodox Method, Purple Mansion Heavenly Gang!"

"Nine Chen Imperial Edict, Destruction and Extermination of Evil!"

A long cry that could pierce gold and crack stone erupted from Xu Yunfan's throat, its sound like a heavenly thunder drum, shaking the space within the array.

As the true word was uttered, the Lock Heaven Array trembled violently.

The nodes of countless array patterns glowed brightly.

*Hum!*

Three hundred and sixty fist-sized, cyan-purple thunder pearls, condensed from pure Heavenly Gang Thunder Evil, suddenly appeared on the array's light screen.

They were like stars embedded in the Thunder Dragon Array Base.

Each thunder pearl was frantically absorbing the primordial energy within the array, emitting a piercing hum and waves of destruction.

Then, at the core of the array's center, between Xu Yunfan's palms, a团 of deep purple thunder light, whose power was difficult to describe, rapidly collapsed and condensed.

It then became as clear and transparent as amethyst, with billions of tiny lightning flashes within. A terrifying core formed, so heavy and solid that it caused the space to twist and collapse.

"Divine霄 Purple Mansion Destruction Heavenly Gang True Thunder Method!"

"Go!"

Xu Yunfan pushed his palms forward violently,打入 the thunder sphere, condensed to its limit and containing the ultimate will of destruction, into the core eye of the array diagram.

*BOOM!!*

A thunderous roar, as if the heavens and earth were being destroyed, exploded within the array.

The core purple thunder sphere erupted.

It transformed into a dazzling thunder pillar, over ten zhang in diameter, connecting the top and bottom of the array diagram.

But this was only the beginning.

The world-shaking purple thunder pillar split instantly, like the branches of a colossal tree, precisely connecting to the three hundred and sixty Heavenly Gang Thunder Evil Pearls on the array's light screen.

*CRACKLE!*

Each Heavenly Gang Thunder Evil Pearl infused with the core purple thunder was like a gunpowder barrel being ignited, swelling violently before shooting out purple thunder snakes as thick as pythons, wreathed in the aura of destruction.

Then, three hundred and sixty thick purple thunder snakes swarmed out, following the trajectories of the周天 celestial stars, intertwining and weaving with each other to form a flawless周天 Destruction Thunder Net that covered the entire Lock Heaven Array space.

As the saying goes, it's fast as lightning. From the moment Xu Yunfan flicked out the array disc to the formation of the thunder net, the entire process was breathtakingly fast.

It was all completed in a flash of lightning.

The dozens of Black Yin Soul-Slaying Spears shot by Zhao Moyang were the first to meet their match, colliding head-on with the thunder net that crashed down.

*SIZZLE!*

Like a hot branding iron plunging into a snowdrift.

The pitch-black Black Yin qi let out a piercing shriek the instant it touched the purple thunder containing the Destruction Heavenly Gang Righteousness, and was quickly dissolved and melted away.

The Black Yin Soul-Slaying Spears, which were enough to corrode the soul and magical power, were incredibly fragile before the majestic, righteous, and all-destroying thunder evil.

In just a single breath, the dozens of Soul-Slaying Spears dissipated into nothingness under the绞杀 of the purple thunder.

"Ugh!"

His innate神通 was forcibly wiped out. Zhao Moyang felt as if he had been struck in the chest by a heavy hammer, his face instantly turning deathly pale as he spat out a mouthful of essence blood.

His eyes were filled with disbelief and horror.

This thunder method was far more overbearing and sharp than he had anticipated.

Leng Yuehua's cyan small sword, as fast as teleportation, had already silently approached within three feet of Xu Yunfan's brow.

But the moment that faint dark green thread entered the range of the thunder net, it was like it had闯入 a sticky, mire-like thunder swamp.

The aura of destruction that filled the thunder light seeped into everything. The insidious and vicious characteristics of this small bamboo sword were completely suppressed.

The sinister and poisonous magical power attached to the sword let out a sizzling哀鸣 and rapidly evaporated and disappeared.

The small sword's speed dropped sharply, its trajectory laid bare.

"Hmph!"

A flash of lightning appeared in Xu Yunfan's eyes as he flicked a finger.

A wisp of purple lightning, as fine as a hair but condensed to the extreme, shot out from his fingertip.

*TING!*

A crisp sound of metal and iron colliding! It struck the middle of the dark green thread with pinpoint accuracy.

The terrifying explosive power contained within that fine purple lightning surged in instantly.

"Ah!"

A short, piercing scream escaped Leng Yuehua. Boundless, intense pain首次 surged into her eyes, which were like frozen dead water.

That small bamboo sword artifact, connected to her mind and spirit, had its spiritual light greatly dimmed by a single strike of the purple lightning. Fine cracks appeared on its surface as it哀鸣ed and flew back.

The backlash to her spiritual sense caused her spiritual sea to ache violently, and the aura around her instantly became chaotic.

Her pride, the small sword she was adept at assassinating with, was so easily and utterly defeated before the opponent's overbearing positive thunder.

Sun Qishan was the most fierce and violent.

Seeing the two of them fail, his heart trembled slightly, but under the operation of his cultivation method, a violent aura surged from his heart, causing his eyes to turn red.

"Don't be so arrogant!"

The blood axe, carrying the power to split mountains, tore through the layers of thunder qi. The scarlet axe aura, like an angry dragon, roared as it chopped down to Xu Yunfan's side.

Under the笼罩 of the thunder net, the giant axe was incredibly heavy, as if it were dragging ten thousand jun of thunder.

Sun Qishan's brute strength was unmatched. The muscles on his arms swelled like steel mountains. The blood patterns on the black giant axe glowed as if dripping blood, frantically squeezing out demonic qi, and actually hacked apart the interwoven purple thunder snakes.

"Give me shatter!"

Sun Qishan roared ferociously, the blood light in his eyes surging, wanting to劈开 Xu Yunfan along with this thunder net.

Just as the giant axe's wind of force was about to touch Xu Yunfan's protective thunder light, Xu Yunfan's gaze was cold. He did not dodge or evade, and his hand seals changed violently!

"Battle and Stars Shift, Thunder Evil Reversal!"

*BOOM!*

The entire Five Thunders Inverse Yuan Lock Heaven Array collapsed inward and rotated violently.

The周天 Destruction Thunder Net, pulled by the core purple thunder pillar, did not clash head-on with the axe aura. Instead, it gathered and reorganized itself like a living creature.

Three hundred and sixty thunder snakes danced wildly and constricted, converging three feet in front of Xu Yunfan to form a thick thunder light shield, over three feet thick and constantly rotating.

The shield's surface was not solid, but a Heavenly Gang Thunder Evil Millstone composed of countless high-speed rotating and compressed-to-the-extreme thunder needles and blades.

A deep purple brand at its center emitted an aura that could destroy all things.

*SHRIEK!*

*CRASH!!*

The scarlet axe aura hacked violently into the Heavenly Gang Thunder Evil Millstone shield.

An ear-piercing, teeth-grinding sound of metal twisting and cutting疯狂响起.

Blood light and purple lightning splashed violently.

That Heavenly Gang Thunder Evil Millstone was like the strongest defensive barrier and the most violent grinder.

The violent axe aura was torn apart layer by layer by the rotating millstone's thunder blades, then shredded.
