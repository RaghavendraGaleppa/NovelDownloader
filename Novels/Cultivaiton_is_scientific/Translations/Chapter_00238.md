# Chapter 238: The Bait  

Li Shiming never expected to be targeted. By his own judgment, he considered himself a pacifist—all combat matters were handled by his doppelganger, Li Yuanba. Though his own combat prowess was formidable, his primary focus remained on alchemy and accumulating cultivation resources.  

His doppelganger wouldn’t arrive quickly, so he decided to meet Yin Shilan first—it had been a long time since they last saw each other.  

With ample time on his hands, he leisurely admired the scenery along the way as he flew.  

Free from the worries of resources, this kind of immortal cultivation life was truly comfortable and carefree.  

Casually retrieving a jade slip, he examined it. This was a map provided by the sect, exchanged for contribution points. Its content was far richer than any ordinary map.  

"There’s a large market ahead—might as well take a look!" Due to his prolonged semi-seclusion for the sake of "Purple Qi from the East," he had hardly left the sect. Now that he was out, he wanted to broaden his horizons.  

Nowadays, he could confidently declare that spirit stones were just numbers to him—he had no real interest in them.  

As a high-level alchemist capable of mass-producing spirit pills, the sheer quantity of high-grade pills in his spatial ring alone could be converted into an astronomical sum of spirit stones.  

Lost in thought, he soon approached the market and descended, landing outside its entrance.  

With a flick of his hand, he cast a spell to open the market’s formation and stepped inside.  

"Whose market is that?" Ji Hongbo, who had been secretly monitoring Li Shiming from afar, asked coldly.  

Ji Hongbo was the son of a Golden Core elder, with a Nascent Soul ancestor as his backer. Normally, he wouldn’t even glance at such a market, let alone pay attention to it.  

"That’s the Hang Clan’s market!" a subordinate beside him promptly replied.  

"The Hang Clan—the same family as Hang Jian, who’s on good terms with my father?" Ji Hongbo mused.  

"Exactly, Senior Hang’s family!" The subordinate didn’t dare address a Golden Core cultivator so casually and bowed in response.  

"Find out if Hang Jian is there," Ji Hongbo ordered with a flickering gaze, waving his hand dismissively.  

Though he spoke of Hang Jian without much respect, a Golden Core cultivator was still someone he had to tread carefully around.  

If Hang Jian were present in the market, Ji Hongbo couldn’t guarantee he could persuade him to help deal with Li Shiming.  

After all, while Hang Jian was friendly with Elder Ji, their relationship wasn’t strong enough for him to risk offending Elder Su by targeting her personal disciple—especially one who was also a true inheritor of the Shu Mountain Sect’s alchemy lineage.  

Such an act would spell certain doom for the Hang Clan.  

---  

"Senior Brother Ji, Senior Hang isn’t in the market. Currently, Hang Yuqing is in charge," the subordinate reported back after a brief investigation.  

"Fortune favors me!" Ji Hongbo laughed heartily.  

---  

Li Shiming entered the market, which was bustling with activity. Aside from the shops lining the streets, many cultivators had set up stalls on the roadside, displaying their acquired spirit materials for sale.  

At a glance, there were at least a thousand cultivators in the market, with Foundation Establishment cultivators making up the majority. This was clearly a market primarily catering to Foundation Establishment resources.  

He couldn’t help but marvel at how only in the Northern Shu cultivation environment could so many Foundation Establishment cultivators emerge.  

Most of these cultivators weren’t from sects—they were the so-called rogue cultivators.  

This could be discerned from subtle details in their appearance. Sect disciples typically bore sect insignias unless deliberately concealed.  

Li Shiming didn’t hide his face either. As he browsed the stalls, he restrained his divine sense into a thin thread to avoid disturbing others, focusing only on the spirit materials for sale.  

Rogue cultivators had their own methods—many rare and peculiar spirit materials could be found here.  

It broadened his horizons, and occasionally, he would purchase some items.  

"Fellow Daoist, these items of mine were just retrieved from an ancient ruin—belonging to a great cultivator!" A wiry Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator, noticing Li Shiming’s generous spending at other stalls, eagerly called out to him.  

Li Shiming swept his divine sense over the items on the stall and shook his head.  

An ancient ruin of a great cultivator? There was no way a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator could explore such a place. Though the spirit materials appeared aged, under divine sense scrutiny, the artificial alterations were glaringly obvious.  

In the cultivation world, "great cultivator" was a term low-level cultivators used to refer to Nascent Soul cultivators. But in truth, only those at the late Nascent Soul stage truly deserved the title.  

Regardless of the definition, such ruins were far beyond the reach of a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

The last time he had explored the ruin of the Six-Fingered Sound Demon, he had nearly lost his life there.  

"Fellow Daoist, I really do have good items! Look at this jade slip—it’s an ancient one!" The wiry cultivator, seeing Li Shiming’s disinterest, quickly changed tactics, producing a jade slip.  

The slip did appear ancient, its style markedly different from contemporary ones.  

Li Shiming scanned it with his divine sense and felt a flicker of curiosity. The slip bore signs of repair—skillfully done, but not enough to evade his divine sense.  

The jade slip had indeed been damaged and was genuinely ancient. However, whether it was still usable was another matter.  

The wiry cultivator held the slip unusually close to Li Shiming, allowing his divine sense to easily penetrate it and examine its contents.  

The contents were fragmented, written in ancient script. Given the damage, it was likely that the text had become garbled.  

But Li Shiming saw more. His divine sense detected traces of a cultivation barrier—evidence that the slip had originally been sealed, requiring a certain cultivation level to access its contents.  

Such barriers were common in the cultivation world, preventing cultivators from forcibly accessing high-level techniques beyond their realm, which could lead to cultivation mishaps.  

"How much?" Li Shiming asked casually.  

"Five hundred spirit stones!" The wiry cultivator’s eyes gleamed with delight as he named an exorbitant price.  

Li Shiming was about to agree—spirit stones meant little to him, and the ancient slip was worth studying.  

"Qi Bao! How dare you swindle people in the Hang Clan’s market?" A furious shout interrupted them. A fair-faced, beardless Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator strode over, glaring at the wiry man.  

"Young Master Hang, I wouldn’t dare!" The wiry man, Qi Bao, paled and immediately kowtowed without explanation.  

"Fellow Daoist, this Qi Bao often employs tricks to deceive unsuspecting cultivators," the fair-faced man, addressed as Young Master Hang, explained with a cupped fist toward Li Shiming.  

Li Shiming felt no gratitude for the interruption. Regardless of the reason, interfering in a private transaction was highly discourteous.  

In the cultivation world, no Foundation Establishment cultivator was a fool. Moreover, Li Shiming wore the unmistakable robes of the Shu Mountain Sect. This Young Master Hang’s sudden appearance was likely an attempt to ingratiate himself.  

"Five hundred spirit stones—the slip is mine," Li Shiming declared, tossing the stones to Qi Bao and taking the jade slip.  

His swift action left no room for Young Master Hang to intervene, stunning the onlookers.  

Qi Bao glanced nervously at the displeased Young Master Hang before slinking away into the crowd.  

"Fellow Daoist, it seems I overstepped. Allow me to make amends," Young Master Hang said, suppressing his irritation and forcing a smile. He gestured to a nearby pavilion. "If you’re looking to purchase anything in the market, the stalls here are hardly worth your time. That’s my family’s shop—we even stock third-grade spirit materials. Let me invite you for tea as an apology."  

---  

Li Shiming sensed something amiss. He hadn’t revealed his identity, and though his reputation was considerable, Young Master Hang hadn’t recognized him.  

A mere Shu Mountain Sect disciple’s status shouldn’t warrant such groveling from the market’s owner.  

"So you’re the market’s proprietor. Which senior is currently overseeing it? I should pay my respects," Li Shiming probed, remaining where he stood.  

In the crowded market, even if the other party had ill intentions, they wouldn’t dare act against him openly.  

His sect affiliation alone was deterrent enough, but even a rogue cultivator targeted without cause would tarnish the market’s reputation—something no market could afford if it wished to retain visitors.  

"My father is away visiting friends. I’m currently in charge," Young Master Hang replied with another inviting gesture.  

"Since the host insists, refusing would be impolite. Lead the way," Li Shiming said coolly.  

Hearing that the market’s guardian was absent—confirmed by Young Master Hang’s demeanor—he grew more curious.  

With his mastery of "Lotus Steps," he was confident in his escape capabilities. Even if a Golden Core cultivator were present, he could ensure his safety.  

What exactly did Young Master Hang want?  

Smiling, Young Master Hang guided Li Shiming toward the pavilion. Without even using his divine sense, Li Shiming could tell the formation here was formidable—designed to restrain Golden Core cultivators.  

Such a formation required third-grade materials and the expertise of a formation master.  

For a mere market to employ such a formation suggested the goods inside were extraordinary.  

Glancing at the beaming Young Master Hang, Li Shiming discreetly extended a strand of divine sense. The man showed no reaction.  

Shaking his head internally, Li Shiming noted the lack of sect training—Young Master Hang couldn’t even detect divine sense probing.  

With that assurance, he freely expanded his divine sense, allowing the IBMz15 in his mental space to analyze the formation’s energy pathways.  

Deliberately slowing his pace, Li Shiming took his time observing the first floor—stocked with artifacts and first-grade materials for Qi Refining cultivators.  

By the time they ascended to the second floor, he had fully grasped the formation’s workings.  

This knowledge bolstered his confidence in handling whatever Young Master Hang had planned. A faint smile played on his lips.  

"The second floor displays spirit tools and second-grade materials. Let me first show you the third floor’s third-grade materials before we return for a closer look here," Young Master Hang offered, gesturing upward.  

The third floor housed the formation’s strongest nodes—normally guarded by his father.  

Luring Li Shiming there was the surest way to trap him.  

Young Master Hang knew the market’s survival in this region depended on connections.  

His father, a Golden Core early-stage cultivator, could maintain the market’s operations but lacked the influence to expand it.  

Having met Ji Hongbo—a true inheritor of the Shu Mountain Sect and the son of a Golden Core elder—Young Master Hang saw an opportunity. Aligning with such a figure would be a tremendous boon for the Hang Clan.  

Ji Hongbo had sent word, asking for cooperation in dealing with a Shu Mountain Sect disciple who had offended him.  

Had Young Master Hang’s father been present, he would have refused. After all, if Ji Hongbo himself had to intervene, the target was no ordinary disciple.  

But blinded by ambition, Young Master Hang had readily agreed after Ji Hongbo’s smooth-talking and promises.  

Upon reaching the third floor, Li Shiming was slightly surprised to find two third-grade spirit materials secured at the formation’s nodes.  

The Hang Clan’s business was evidently thriving if they could afford to sell such items.  

In truth, these materials weren’t just shop inventory—they were the core of the entire market’s formation.  

Though not strictly non-saleable, they wouldn’t be sold unless the price was irresistible to the Hang Clan’s Golden Core elder.  

Li Shiming’s divine sense traced the energy pathways to the materials, and his eyes gleamed with excitement.  

Despite his rising status in the Shu Mountain Sect, as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he had no access to third-grade materials.  

Even with abundant contribution points, the sect restricted such resources to Golden Core cultivators.  

Every third-grade material could enhance a Golden Core cultivator’s strength. Their rarity meant even the Shu Mountain Sect had to allocate them judiciously.  

Thus, despite his wealth of contribution points, Li Shiming couldn’t exchange for third-grade materials.  

Particularly the third-grade Five Elements formation materials he desperately needed. The only one he possessed was a third-grade earth-attribute material, obtained when his doppelganger, Li Yuanba, killed a rogue sect’s true inheritor.  

And now, his divine sense had detected that the two third-grade materials at the formation nodes were precisely the Five Elements formation materials he sought.
