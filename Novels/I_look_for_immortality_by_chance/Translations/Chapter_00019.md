# Chapter 19: Secret Seals and the Celestial Star Black Market  

"Prayer for Rain Seal!"  

"A secret-class magical seal!"  

"This seal connects heaven and earth—one command stirs wind and thunder, another summons torrential rain."  

"It is an essential seal for invoking rain and dispelling drought."  

"Only those who have ingested water-attribute spiritual water and possess water-based spiritual awareness can study it."  

The stall was located at the center of the market, and its owner was a Daoist who appeared to be in his thirties. The sleeves of his cyan robe were embroidered with six emerald-green leaves.  

Gu Yuan had already learned the significance of Qingfeng Dao Academy's robes. Generally, cyan robes were worn by Qi Refinement disciples, and the number of leaves on the sleeves indicated the disciple's cultivation level. The Daoist before him, adorned with six leaves, was clearly a sixth-level Qi Refinement cultivator.  

"Greetings, Senior Brother!"  

Gu Yuan clasped his hands in salute, his demeanor respectful.  

The Daoist opened his eyes, glancing at Gu Yuan. A flash of cyan light flickered in his gaze before he took note of Gu Yuan's robe. A trace of surprise crossed his face.  

Gu Yuan was only at the fourth level of Qi Refinement, yet he wore a mid-grade robe embroidered with five leaves. It seemed he had connections within the academy!  

With this thought, the Daoist's expression softened, and he smiled warmly.  

"Junior Brother, are you interested in this Prayer for Rain Seal?"  

"Excellent choice!"  

"Cloud-summoning and rain-bringing techniques are rare in the Qi Refinement realm. This seal can alter the weather, bringing torrential rain across a ten-mile radius. With this seal, Junior Brother will surely complete the academy's rain-praying missions."  

Cultivators were the pillars of a sect, but mortals were its foundation.  

Every sect's territory sheltered vast populations of mortals as its future seeds. With such numbers and expansive domains, disasters and demonic beasts were inevitable. Thus, the sect issued various missions for disciples to resolve, serving as both training and service.  

Among these, cloud-summoning and rain-bringing to alter weather were common tasks.  

However, such spells were largely limited to weather manipulation and offered little advantage in combat. Most disciples didn't bother studying them, so the market for such seals was small. The Daoist had only set up his stall here on a whim.  

But Gu Yuan's goal wasn't the seal itself—it was the "cultivation conditions" mentioned.  

"Senior Brother, this seal requires the user to have ingested spiritual water. Is there a particular reason for that?"  

As he asked, Gu Yuan took out three spirit stones and placed them on the stall, purchasing the seal.  

The Daoist, already suspecting Gu Yuan had influential backing, was further pleased by his respectful manner. His smile widened as he eagerly explained.  

"Junior Brother must be new to the academy. It's natural you wouldn't know."  

"The fifth level of Qi Refinement—the Spiritual Awareness Barrier—is the first major hurdle in cultivation!"  

"From this point onward, the gap between cultivators truly begins to widen!"  

"Because from this stage, crafting magical seals starts to have specific requirements. While most seals don't impose restrictions on spiritual awareness, some unique seals require special spiritual awareness methods to fuse Dao patterns. Without them, no matter how vast your spiritual awareness, you can't condense the patterns into a seal!"  

"These seals are known as 'secret seals'!"  

"Take this Prayer for Rain Seal, for example. It's crafted using the shed skin of a thirty-year water snake as the main material, supplemented with Thunder-Drawing Grass and Water Origin Flowers. These three Dao patterns must be fused into one to forge the seal. But if you haven't ingested spiritual water, there's no way to merge these three patterns!"  

"Take our academy's exclusive seal, the Golden Radiance Great Sword Seal. It can only be mastered by those who have ingested 'Golden Roar Spiritual Water'."  

"Junior Brother is only at the fourth level of Qi Refinement and hasn't ingested spiritual water yet, right? If you have senior backing, just consume mid-grade or higher spiritual water, and crafting this Prayer for Rain Seal will be effortless!"  

Gu Yuan had gleaned bits of this knowledge from his recent studies, but the details had been unclear. The Daoist's explanation made everything click.  

The value of spiritual water was even greater than he'd imagined—it had this additional layer of significance.  

He had initially assumed that crafting seals relied solely on comprehension. Now, he realized that wasn't entirely true.  

Seal crafting bore similarities to artifact forging—both involved refining materials into a new form.  

But artifact forging emphasized the "refining" process. It required controlling the fire and shaping the artifact before inscribing patterns to complete it. Mastery over materials and spiritual fire was key.  

Seal crafting, however, emphasized "comprehension." One had to immerse their mind in the Dao patterns, perceive the forces of heaven and earth, and then guide the patterns to merge in a specific sequence.  

It demanded insight into the Dao patterns themselves.  

Only by understanding the patterns could one fuse them into a cohesive seal.  

But now, it seemed that not only comprehension was needed—specific "spiritual awareness" was also required.  

Gu Yuan had always thought the Spiritual Awareness Barrier, as the first major hurdle in Qi Refinement, was significant merely because it allowed spiritual awareness to extend beyond the body, granting clarity within a few zhang as if observing lines on one's palm—a minor leap in life's hierarchy.  

But now, he saw this stage was far more crucial than he'd realized.  

"Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother!"  

"Do you have any other secret seals that require water-attribute spiritual awareness?"  

Thinking of his "Spiritual Serpent Heavenly Water," Gu Yuan felt a surge of excitement.  

This unique spiritual awareness method might be the key to enhancing his strength.  

"I do have another water-attribute seal, but it's not a secret seal—just an ordinary one. Anyone with sufficient comprehension can craft it."  

The Daoist flicked his wrist, producing a jade slip inscribed with minuscule characters.  

"Mirror Flower, Water Moon Seal!"  

"Creates a watery doppelganger capable of blocking one attack of equal cultivation level."  

The description left Gu Yuan slightly disappointed.  

This wasn't what he was looking for.  

The Daoist noticed his reaction.  

Perhaps due to Gu Yuan's respectful attitude or his suspected connections, the Daoist pondered for a moment before speaking again.  

"Most stalls in this market only carry common goods. While my Prayer for Rain Seal is a secret seal, its utility is limited to weather manipulation."  

"If you truly wish to find rare treasures, you should visit the 'Celestial Star Black Market' deep within the market. That's where the real treasures are."  

"The 'Celestial Star Black Market' was established by Elder Xuan in his youth. Now that he's reached the Golden Core realm, he no longer cares for such trivial profits, but he still oversees it. The prices there are fair, and no one dares to exploit others."  

"However, the entry fee for the 'Celestial Star Black Market' isn't cheap—five spirit stones just to enter."  

For most cultivators, five spirit stones was a significant sum.  

A typical fourth or fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivator might only save around twenty spirit stones in a year. Spending a fifth of that just to enter was too steep for most.  

But Gu Yuan was no ordinary cultivator.  

Even the slightest favor from a Golden Core elder was enough for him to splurge a little.  

"Thank you for the information, Senior Brother!"  

Realizing the market stalls had nothing more to offer, Gu Yuan bowed respectfully to the Daoist and headed deeper into the market.  

The market wasn't large, and Gu Yuan soon reached its end, where a pavilion stood at the edge of a cliff.  

No guards stood at its entrance—only a pitch-black doorway.  

As Gu Yuan stepped forward, a shimmering barrier materialized, blocking his path.  

On the barrier, a ten-foot-tall golden toad stared at him, its mouth gaping wide.  

Understanding dawned on Gu Yuan. He retrieved five spirit stones from his storage pouch and tossed them into the toad's mouth.  

"Ribbit!"  

The toad croaked joyfully before suddenly snapping its jaws shut—swallowing Gu Yuan whole before he could react.
