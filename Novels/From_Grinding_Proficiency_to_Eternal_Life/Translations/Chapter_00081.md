# Chapter 81: Thunder Accumulation Mountain

The cavalry commander’s fists collided, producing a sound like metal striking metal. He leaped into the air, his fist wind tearing through the air as he aimed directly at Xu Yunfan’s face. The power of this punch was enough to shatter mountains and crack stones!

However, Xu Yunfan neither dodged nor retreated. He gently raised his right hand, lifting the War Drum瓮金 Hammer.

*Clang!*

The collision between fist and hammer produced a deafening sound, like that of a great bell or a ceremonial drum.

The commander’s fist instantly became a bloody mess, the bones within shattering inch by inch. He screamed and retreated, only to see that Xu Yunfan hadn't moved an inch, not even the hem of his clothes disturbed.

Xu Yunfan shook his head in disapproval. Although his strength had increased significantly compared to before, his mind had become much duller.

Riding on his momentum, the War Drum瓮金 Hammer transformed into a crimson stream of light.

Before the hammer head even arrived, the wind it generated kicked up a cloud of dust. The cavalry commander hastily raised his arms to block, but a crisp *crack* rang out as both arms were severed at the elbows.

The hammer’s momentum did not减退; it struck squarely against the commander's chest.

The heavy玄铁 armor shattered as if made of paper. The commander’s chest caved in, and he spat out blood mixed with fragments of his internal organs before crashing heavily to the ground, the light of life rapidly fading from his eyes.

Xu Yunfan’s cold gaze quickly swept over the surrounding cavalry charging at him. With their commander dead, he naturally wouldn't let these men go.

Half an hour later, after chasing down the fleeing soldiers, Xu Yunfan pulled his heavy hammer, deeply embedded in a black-armored elite’s body, free and shook off the flesh clinging to it.

He looked to the side; this squad of thirty elite black-armored soldiers had been completely wiped out by him.

Without hesitation, Xu Yunfan mounted his horse and galloped south.

As the twilight stained the sky blood-red, a dark cloud of iron cavalry crushed the official road. Three hundred heavy-armored war horses trampled over dismembered limbs, while the incense-burning sect’s battle flags, embroidered with golden silk edges, snapped violently in the bloody wind.

On the leading black carriage, a purple-robed old man suddenly raised his hand, and the nine ghost-faced horses pulling the carriage reared up in unison.

"Disciple!"

A hoarse roar shook the crows from the branches.

The坛主 of the Incense-Burning Sect placed his withered, thin hand on the cavalry commander's sunken chest. The residual warmth of the玄铁 heavy armor burned his palm.

The edges of the hammer mark that pierced the chest were extremely smooth; only a heavy weapon with extremely swift and fierce force could cause such a thing.

"Who exactly..."

The purple-robed old man spun around, staring fixedly in the direction Xu Yunfan had departed. There, a winding, fresh horse track stretched far into the distance.

Xu Yunfan’s bay horse stepped over the shattered armor scattered on the ground, its iron hooves clinking crisply against the stones.

This was the third day since leaving Dingbei City. Everything he had seen along the way was ruins and broken walls.

Locust trees lining the official road were hung with ropes, each suspending a bloated corpse swaying gently in the cold wind.

The sound of metal clashing came from the distance, and Xu Yunfan reined in his horse.

He saw twenty-odd riders turning out from behind a distant earth mound. Their black iron armor was stained with minced meat, and bloody hemp sacks hung from their saddles.

The leading standard-bearer held a battle flag with a red background and golden patterns reading "Heavenly Army of Exorcism." The flag surface was painted with a large Buddhist swastika symbol.

The team leader, a百夫长, lifted a female corpse with the tip of his spear.

"This wench was still hiding half a wheat cake."

Sobs came from the sack, with several small legs kicking at the opening.

The cavalry burst into laughter.

Xu Yunfan patted his horse’s neck; the bay horse’s warm muscles were trembling. He untied his leather wineskin and took a swig of strong liquor. The瓮金 Hammer swayed in his hand, causing the air to hum.

Seeing this, the百夫长 waved his spear and laughed loudly, "Hey, you big fellow, come here and accept your death!"

Before the laughter faded, Xu Yunfan had already charged forward.

He squeezed his thighs tight against the horse’s belly, his thigh muscles tensing like bowstrings. The bay horse beneath him felt its master’s发力 and kicked off the ground with all four hooves, shooting out like an arrow released from a bow.

The瓮金 Hammer tore through the air. The team leader hastily raised his spear to block it.

Xu Yunfan’s right arm muscles bulged, veins popping out. The moment the hammer head struck the spear shaft, the百夫长’s grip shattered, and the spear flew from his hands.

Xu Yunfan twisted his waist and abdomen, using the horse's momentum to swing his left hammer in a sweep. Three cavalrymen exploded like overripe persimmons, their flesh and horses shattered together.

The bay horse raised its front hooves, and Xu Yunfan used the momentum to dismount.

His feet touched the ground, his calf muscles contracting like springs, and his body shot out like a cannonball.

As the瓮金 Hammer swung, the muscles on his shoulders and back rolled like waves; every strike drew upon his full body’s strength.

When the last cavalryman was nailed into the ground by the hammer head, the tied sack mouth came loose. A boy with a face full of blood and dirt crawled out.

The child stared blankly at Xu Yunfan, who was casually picking up a long sword to prod the corpses, then suddenly lunged forward to bite at a companion's corpse.

"How far is Thunder Accumulation Mountain?"

Xu Yunfan lifted the boy’s chin with the hammer handle.

The boy let out a beast-like growl from his throat and pointed south with a hand covered in brain matter.

There, a column of wolf smoke rose straight up. Below the smoke column, the tops of a continuous stretch of military tents could be seen.

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, then tossed the boy aside and galloped straight out of the boy's sight.

At noon on the seventh day, Xu Yunfan saw the first heavy armor corpse of a Wuzhou soldier.

This headless corpse knelt by a stream, supporting itself on a陌刀, with seventeen broken arrows stuck in the gaps of its armor.

Half a mile further on, the stream was dyed dark red. Hundreds of light cavalry corpses from the Incense-Burning Sect were piled up like a low wall. It was clear that a detachment of Wuzhou remnants had made a desperate stand here.

Xu Yunfan paused for a moment, then pressed on without stopping, heading south to Wuzhou.

Armor breeds lice, and the people die in droves.
White bones litter the wilderness, and for a thousand miles, there is no crowing of rooster.
Of a hundred lives, barely one survives; thinking of this breaks the heart.

What he saw today was no less than that; Wuzhou had become a purgatory.

By the tenth day, after rushing fifteen hundred miles, Xu Yunfan finally saw living people. Though their faces were sallow and their expressions somewhat numb and worried, they were, at least, living a relatively normal life.

From time to time, he could see Wuzhou scouts in light armor coming and going, looking at the tall horse-riding Xu Yunfan with scrutinizing eyes.

Even a leader came up to question him. Xu Yunfan naturally explained his intention to go to Thunder Accumulation Mountain and took out the token of the天蝉门.

Seeing the token in Xu Yunfan’s hand, the scout captain’s expression of vigilance faded a lot, but suspicion remained. He cupped his hands politely.

"So you are someone from Thunder Accumulation Mountain."

After saying that, he politely let him pass.

Xu Yunfan didn't cause trouble. Just as he nodded and prepared to continue his journey, the scout captain, knowing Xu Yunfan was from Qingzhou, couldn't help but ask.

"How is the situation in the north of Wuzhou?"

Xu Yunfan was silent for a long time before saying, "Whenever the Incense-Burning Sect breaks a city, they slaughter and pillage, taking more than can be counted. Those who are strong are immediately beheaded. Infants are impaled on spears and swung about for amusement. In the counties and towns they passed, the land is scorched and barren. When the spring swallows return, they nest in the trees."

The scouts were trembling with rage. The scout captain’s eyes turned red, and he gnashed his teeth.

"This Incense-Burning Sect! I will drink their blood and eat their flesh!"

After leaving, after replenishing his dry rations at the nearest large city and traveling another three hundred miles, Xu Yunfan finally arrived at the foot of Thunder Accumulation Mountain.

Looking around, Xu Yunfan looked somewhat stunned. He had seen much scorched earth and bloodstains these past few days, and he had rarely seen such a peaceful scene.

At the foot of Thunder Accumulation Mountain, fields crisscrossed.
The green rice paddies stretched out like an emerald carpet, and a gentle breeze stirred the rolling waves of grain.
