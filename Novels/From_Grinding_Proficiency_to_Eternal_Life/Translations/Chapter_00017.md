# Chapter 17: Digging Through Earth Like Mud

Fang Mushan's gaze swept past Xu Yunfan, landing on Li Haomiao slung over his back.

"What happened to this guy?"

"Three of his limbs were broken. I felt pity for him, so I helped out."

Li Haomiao opened his mouth, wanting to curse, but knowing he couldn't speak right now, he simply turned his head away.

Upon hearing this, Fang Mushan's sharp gaze softened considerably. After all, to still help others in such a harsh environment deep within the Ninggu塔 mine, and to have survived until now, he couldn't be considered a bad person no matter what.

He sized up Xu Yunfan: "Your footwork is quite good. You should have reached the minor success stage."

"I've been practicing blindly for a few days, it can't be considered minor success yet."

The physical enhancement brought by the Copper Body Art made him appear no less capable than someone at the minor success stage when using the Leg of the Scouting Flea. However, he knew his own situation well; once the Leg of the Scouting Flea reached minor success, it should be faster and more energy-efficient.

Fang Mushan simply took it as humility and didn't think much of it. With his extraordinary talent, formidable physique, and particularly enduring stamina, he naturally wasn't worried about exhausting himself from a long-distance run.

The four or five people from before were already exhausted and unable to continue, having been left far behind. Now, only Xu Yunfan and Fang Mushan remained.

Hmm, plus one Li Haomiao.

Fang Mushan pondered for a moment and said, "Ninggu塔 has the Great General Killing Array. That Zhang Shuyang is roughly on par with us in strength, so he can't do anything about it. Without any other changes, he shouldn't be able to find us immediately."

He calculated: "After a night of forced marching, we've run at least sixty li. We're still not in a safe range from Ninggu塔. We'll rest for a bit and then need to continue. Are you going to keep following me?"

A martial artist who has achieved major success in the First Refinement has extremely long endurance and can run over a hundred li in a single night. For safety's sake, they naturally couldn't stay long.

Xu Yunfan nodded without hesitation: "If Brother Fang doesn't mind, more people means more strength."

Fang Mushan nodded: "I won't stop to wait for you. If you can keep up, then keep up. If you can't, then you're on your own."

"Thanks!"

Xu Yunfan casually found a leeward spot sheltered from the cold wind and began to rest silently. Meanwhile, in a spot where Fang Mushan couldn't see, he took out a Grain-Dispelling Pill and swallowed it.

Li Haomiao saw this but didn't say anything. He had taken another one two days ago. Without engaging in strenuous exercise, he could minimize his body's energy consumption, and one pill could last him at least ten days.

Xu Yunfan, due to his intense training, basically took one every two or three days.

After half an hour, Fang Mushan got up and set off, moving with the wind, rushing along his way.

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate either, following closely behind.

The two traveled from morning until the setting sun was about to set, covering sixty li before finally stopping. The terrain was rugged, with many cliffs and crevices on the ridges, as well as ice cracks and fissures. To be able to move at this speed was already quite fast.

Fang Mushan, his whole body steaming and his chest heaving violently, turned back to look at Xu Yunfan, who remained expressionless. He was surprised: "I didn't expect your endurance to be this good."

He was panting heavily. Having not eaten for a day and a night, he had reached his limit and urgently needed food.

Xu Yunfan said casually: "My main cultivation is in footwork, especially long-distance charging, so I can keep up."

Fang Mushan understood and casually asked about Xu Yunfan's background. Learning that he was originally a servant of the Jiang family, there was no trace of disdain in his eyes, just a slight nod.

"Since that's the case, let's first find a place to spend the night. It's getting colder and colder. Without a proper shelter from the wind, it'll be hard to survive the night."

Xu Yunfan said: "I have some experience building shelters. You can leave this to me."

Fang Mushan nodded and agreed. At this time, cooperating would save a great deal of time.

The two and a half men found a leeward spot. Fang Mushan said: "Stay here and don't wander. Think of a way to build a shelter and gather some firewood. I'm going hunting."

Xu Yunfan: "..."

Watching Fang Mushan leave without looking back, Xu Yunfan put down Li Haomiao, took out the iron pick from his waist, found a depression, compared it left and right, and then began to dig.

Then, under Li Haomiao's extremely shocked gaze, in just half an hour, Xu Yunfan had dug out a cave in the mixed earth and stone large enough for four people to rest in. He even had time to level the ground and dig out a simple fireplace.

The efficiency was simply monstrous. Every time Xu Yunfan swung his pick, he could dig out a large chunk of earth and stone. There was no stagnation in his movements; each swing was faster than the last, the iron pick almost becoming a blur in his hand.

Li Haomiao only blinked a few times, and Xu Yunfan had already disappeared into the cave.

When Xu Yunfan carried Li Haomiao into the cave, Li Haomiao said in shock: "Are you a mole? You dug such a huge cave in just two cups of tea's time."

Xu Yunfan frowned: "What mole? Can't you say something nice? I thought you were a learned man, full of talent, but I didn't expect you to be so crude."

To have such efficiency, it was naturally one of the effects brought by the "Digging Through Earth Like Mud" trait after reaching minor success in Mining.

Every time Xu Yunfan swung his pick, he instinctively knew where to dig to be more efficient and less strenuous. Otherwise, he wouldn't have shattered the Source Ancient Jade Tablet with a single swing.

He wondered what amazing effects would be brought by Mining upon reaching major success.

Xu Yunfan thought to himself. It seemed that the skill column on his attribute panel wasn't limited to martial arts; many life skills could be practiced, perhaps with unexpected effects.

Like now.

He left the cave to gather some firewood, enough to ensure warmth for the night, then quickly returned to the cave and began digging diagonally downward.

This not only trained his Mining skill, but every time he used his waist and hips, channeling strength into his arms, the special mining movements engaged his entire core muscle group, which was a form of tempering for the Copper Body Art.

'You are inspired, raising the iron pick in your hand like a heavy hammer, smashing down large patches of earth and stone. You feel as if your power efficiency has increased, and your Mining proficiency has risen.'

'You focus your mind and spirit, the Copper Body Art circulating throughout your body, your internal blood and energy rising. The iron pick in your hand seems to have turned into a hammer, swinging with a fierce wind. The transitions between moves become smoother, your internal strength surges, and the Copper Body Art proficiency has increased.'

'...'

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan was instantly filled with motivation. He continuously swung his iron pick, and in a few breaths, he had already entered the deep tunnel.

Li Haomiao next to him, seeing Xu Yunfan start digging again, couldn't help but curse: "Are you addicted to mining? Oh my, I can see it now, you're truly a born servant with a masochistic streak. Look, this hole you're digging, it's so good, in the blink of an eye you're burying yourself in the ground, just marching right in."

Xu Yunfan poked his head out from the hole and said impatiently: "What do you know? The Copper Body Art's smashing and tempering can make the moves come alive and the stances correct."

Glancing at the system notification in his vision, Xu Yunfan felt his heart fill with joy. He couldn't be bothered to pay attention to Li Haomiao's sarcasm. If this continued, he might really be able to bring the Copper Body Art to major success within a month or two.
