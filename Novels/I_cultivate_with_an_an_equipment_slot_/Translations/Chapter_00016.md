# Chapter 16: Fellow Daoist, I'm Buying This Meditation Mat Too (Seeking Follow-Up Reads)

Reaching the second level of Qi Refinement.  

Still within the early stages of Qi Refinement.  

In the vast world of cultivation, he remained an insignificant ant.  

But.  

If that ant was a thirteen-year-old at the second level of Qi Refinement, then he showed considerable potential.  

Add to that a perfected spell and the status of a spirit planter—  

He would become a genius sought after by various factions.  

After breaking through the barrier of the first level of Qi Refinement, Zhang Yan's first thought was to test his equipment expansion.  

With a thought, the Golden Bamboo Sword in his hand vanished.  

In its place, a third equipment slot appeared in his mind.  

"As expected, breaking through to the second level of Qi Refinement unlocked another equipment slot."  

Feeling the presence of the third slot, Zhang Yan couldn't help but smile.  

The more equipment slots he had, the more affixes he could stack, opening up countless possibilities.  

How could he not be thrilled?  

Moreover, aside from gaining an additional slot, his mana had also doubled after reaching the second level of Qi Refinement.  

"Good. With double the mana, I can irrigate more spirit fields."  

He turned his gaze to the cultivated fields in the distance.  

A faint green hue had already begun to emerge—the spirit rice he had planted was sprouting.  

The crops nurtured by his Spirit Rain Technique were growing even more vigorously.  

"I need to keep working hard!"  

Despite his breakthrough, Zhang Yan didn't slack off. Instead, he continued watering the fields.  

These spirit crops were his treasures.  

Aside from the spirit plants in the main fields, he had also sown seeds of Large-Leaf Vine and Half-Spirit Grass in the semi-spirit fields nearby.  

These two plants were exceptionally hardy, requiring little care to thrive.  

As for the more precious herbs in the spirit fields, Zhang Yan used the Wood Essence Technique to accelerate their growth.  

Additionally, thanks to frequent use of the Spirit Rain Technique from his Tranquil Rain Whisk, his mastery of the technique had reached the beginner level.  

A second-level Qi Refinement cultivator with one small achievement-level spell and one beginner-level spell—  

Even if he searched the entire outer sect, or perhaps the entire Qingheng Sect, he doubted he'd find another like himself.  

But to Zhang Yan, this was no big deal.  

At most, it just made watering the spirit plants a bit more convenient.  

...  

"I still need to buy three more meditation mats." Zhang Yan silently made his plans.  

The reason he, with his inferior spiritual roots, could cultivate so quickly boiled down to two factors.  

First, he frequently exhausted his spiritual energy by casting spells.  

Second, his Evergreen Technique had reached the small achievement level.  

To put it simply—  

If a regular cultivator could absorb 20 units of spiritual energy with an unmastered Evergreen Technique, an entry-level version would allow 30 units.  

But at the small achievement level, Zhang Yan could absorb 50 units.  

This gap was what allowed him to progress faster than others.  

Now, however, the jade slip containing the technique had become useless to him.  

Without new equipment, he could only rely on himself.  

This was where the meditation mats came into play.  

Though each mat only provided a slight boost to comprehension, he now had three equipment slots!  

Stacking three mats together would yield a significant cumulative effect.  

With this in mind, he summoned the Golden Bamboo Sword.  

He had never used it before, mainly because his mana reserves were too meager for sustained flight.  

Now, at the second level of Qi Refinement with triple the mana, he could manage short flights.  

More importantly, his current location was remote.  

Traveling to the Enlightenment Peak on foot would take far too long—time he couldn't afford to waste.  

Thus, he chose the Golden Bamboo Sword over the Greenwood Boat for two reasons:  

First, flying on a sword looked cooler.  

Second, though he had never flown before, the Greenwood Boat came with the "Perfect Skyshark Technique," whose effect stated:  

*(With the same flying artifact, you will always be faster than others! Only a seasoned pilot can squeeze every last drop of performance from a flying artifact!)*  

This effect applied to all flying artifacts, so he opted for the Golden Bamboo Sword.  

Equipping the Greenwood Boat and summoning the Golden Bamboo Sword, Zhang Yan shot into the sky like a streak of light.  

Though it was his first time sword-riding, the Greenwood Boat's expertise made it feel natural.  

His spiritual energy pulsed smoothly, allowing the sword to accelerate, brake, and even perform complex maneuvers with ease.  

The mountain winds whipped past his face, filling him with an unparalleled sense of freedom.  

"The only downside is how much mana it consumes," Zhang Yan muttered.  

Of course, this wasn't the sword's fault—it was his.  

His cultivation base was simply too low!  

Soaring through the air, he reached Enlightenment Peak in less than half a ke (7.5 minutes).  

Figuring he might as well stick with what worked, Zhang Yan sought out Mu Sen again.  

Coincidentally, Mu Sen was just about to begin a lecture, so Zhang Yan joined the group.  

Many disciples were still present when he entered.  

"Senior Brother Mu."  

Zhang Yan greeted him respectfully.  

"No need for formalities, Junior Brother Zhang. What can I do for you?" Mu Sen was unusually warm toward him.  

"Well, it's nothing major. I just wanted to buy two more meditation mats," Zhang Yan said calmly.  

"Oh?"  

"More meditation mats?"  

Mu Sen gave him a puzzled look.  

While the mats did slightly enhance comprehension, the effect was minimal. Besides, a person only had one backside—why would Zhang Yan need multiple mats?  

Though confused, Mu Sen agreed.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" Zhang Yan promptly transferred another 20 contribution points.  

He then began selecting the mats.  

To his disappointment, none of them had the Wood Essence Technique at the great achievement level this time—only two at small achievement.  

"Small achievement is fine, I suppose," Zhang Yan sighed.  

Two small achievement mats were still useful, as his main goal was the comprehension boost.  

But soon, he froze.  

One of the small achievement mats was occupied by a bright-eyed, fair-skinned girl.  

If he remembered correctly, she had been sitting on the mat he purchased last time as well...  

Since it was the same person, he knew the drill.  

Zhang Yan walked up to her and said, "Fellow Daoist, I'm buying this mat."  

"You!"  

Ji Yourong's eyes widened in disbelief.  

She hadn't expected this guy to come buy the mat beneath her again. Taking a deep breath, she moved to another mat, silently cursing Zhang Yan as a shameless rogue.  

But after collecting the first mat, Zhang Yan turned to her again and calmly said, "Fellow Daoist, I'm buying this one too..."
