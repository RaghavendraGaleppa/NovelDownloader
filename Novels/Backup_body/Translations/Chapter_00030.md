# Chapter 30: This Blade Splits Mountains, Parts Seas, and Slays Immortals!

Over the past six months, Li Zhengjing had endured relentless suppression from Outer Sect Deacon Chen Youyu. 

Although the other four deacons had not participated in oppressing him, they had also done nothing to stop Chen Youyu. 

This time, the flawed and incomplete version of the "Internal Qi Nourishment Technique" had been the result of all five deacons conspiring together! 

Now, Li Zhengjing knew that someone higher up had orchestrated this scheme. 

But as far as he was concerned, the five deacons who had directly acted against him were the ones he most wanted to kill! 

In the past, before he had cultivated Internal Qi, these five deacons had been figures far beyond his reach—senior disciples who had trained in the Inner Sect for decades. 

Even after he had first achieved Internal Qi, despite his extraordinary talent, he had assumed it would take him at least ten years to match them in strength. 

Yet now, less than twenty days since attaining Internal Qi, he had already slain all five! 

"A half-year of pent-up frustration, released in one glorious moment—this calls for celebration!" 

Li Zhengjing sheathed his blade, adjusted his mask, and leaped back onto the carriage. 

At that moment, the voice of the Ghost Valley Spirit Official came from within. 

"All four of them had higher Internal Qi cultivation than you. Combined, they could have fought against a peak Internal Qi expert." 

"And yet, they still died by my hand," Li Zhengjing replied. 

"Your combat prowess exceeds my expectations," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said. "I knew you could defeat them, but I didn’t expect you to do so with such ease." 

Li Zhengjing glanced at his left arm, now imbued with divine power, and nodded. "Indeed, it was effortless." 

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official then looked at the potted plant, where the Wall-Climbing Bird peeked out. 

"Your Internal Qi cultivation is only at the mid-tier, while this bird’s strength is equivalent to the upper tier—surpassing yours." 

"Your 'Blazing Sun Divine Flame' is derived from this bird’s innate ability." 

"Yet your version is ten times more powerful!" 

"Truly remarkable." 

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official continued, "Your Internal Qi is inherently domineering, and the 'Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi' is incomparably sharp. This has infused your divine flames with sword intent, elevating their power beyond their original limits." 

After a pause, he added, "Rather than calling it the 'Blazing Sun Divine Flame,' it would be more fitting to name it… the 'Blazing Sun Divine Sword.'" 

"What nonsense is this 'Blazing Sun Divine Sword'? How can this fake, inferior technique possibly be stronger than mine?" 

The Wall-Climbing Bird couldn’t hold back. "What kind of eyes do you have? That mystic tortoise you dissected must have been blind!" 

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official glanced at it. "If more enemies come, would you like to take the next fight and prove it?" 

The bird immediately ducked its head back into the soil. 

From beneath the dirt came its muffled voice: 

"That’s not the same!" 

"Ugh—ugh—damn bird, why are you in here again?" 

The Five Elements Creation Tree flailed its roots, wailing in distress before suddenly stiffening and collapsing weakly. 

"I’m dying…" it whimpered. 

"Quiet! More are coming!" 

Li Zhengjing’s voice came from outside the carriage—low, cold, yet brimming with barely restrained excitement. 

"Another familiar face," he muttered. "This should be easy…" 

--- 

At the Spirit Official’s Apothecary in Wanlin County, the Pavilion Master of the Formation Hall sat cross-legged, his hands resting on his abdomen. 

Above his abdomen, two graded spirit stones hovered midair, suspended by the energy emanating from his palms. 

As his qi circulated, the spirit stones gradually dissolved, merging into the energy vortex above his hands. 

By the time the two stones were fully consumed, the energy had grown slightly denser before retracting back into his body through his palms, settling into his dantian. 

"Pavilion Master." 

A middle-aged man with a golden token at his waist entered the shop and bowed. "The Ghost Valley Spirit Official has left Wanlin County." 

Pavilion Master Yan opened his eyes, his expression indifferent. "Has he made his move?" 

The golden-token elder replied, "He has, but…" 

Pavilion Master Yan said calmly, "But he hasn’t been forced to act personally." 

The elder was taken aback. "You already knew?" 

Pavilion Master Yan retrieved a yellowed slip of paper from his robes. "If he had acted, he would have violated his oath, and this contract would have reacted, suppressing him. But it remains unchanged." 

The elder said gravely, "He has a guardian!" 

Pavilion Master Yan looked at him coldly. 

The elder continued in a low voice, "This guardian is incredibly powerful. I sent six waves of attackers—seventeen in total, all at the upper Internal Qi level—and all of them fell." 

After a pause, he added, "These seventeen were all under the command of Elder Chen Zhu of the Ancient Moon Peak’s Inner Sect. They weren’t our people, so their deaths are no loss." 

He lowered his head. "But if we continue the ambush, we’ll have to use our own forces from the Formation Hall. Against this guardian, Internal Qi cultivators are no match. And there are no expendable 'True Qi' experts left in the Wanlin County area." 

"It seems the Ghost Valley Spirit Official was prepared. His guardian must be at the True Qi level." 

Pavilion Master Yan said slowly, "To kill him, we must first eliminate the guardian. Only then can we force him to act, breaking his oath. At that point… with this contract in hand, I can slay him effortlessly." 

He looked at the elder. "As long as someone can kill the guardian, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official will have no choice but to intervene—and then he will surely die." 

"..." 

The elder’s face darkened. 

Was Pavilion Master Yan planning to sacrifice him? 

His heart sank. The first four attackers—recently demoted Outer Sect deacons, all at the upper Internal Qi level—had been reduced to mutilated corpses in mere moments. 

The guardian was terrifyingly strong and ruthlessly efficient—even the remaining halves of the deacons’ bodies had been bisected again. 

He had no desire to face such a monster. 

More importantly, even if he defeated the guardian and forced the Ghost Valley Spirit Official to act, he would undoubtedly die in the process. 

What did it matter if Pavilion Master Yan succeeded afterward? 

"Elder Shi, do you have confidence?" 

"I understand, Senior Brother!" 

Elder Shi bowed solemnly, then turned and left. 

Mounting his spirit beast, his expression grim, he rode off with an air of finality, pursuing the Ghost Valley Spirit Official’s group. 

He rode without pause, soon spotting a carriage in the distance. 

"Halt, villain!" 

He spurred his spirit beast ahead, cutting off the carriage’s path. 

"I know you, masked one, are formidable," he declared, dismounting. "But today, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official will die!" 

He raised his voice. "I shall test the might of your blade! If you cannot strike me down in a single stroke, you are doomed!" 

"..." 

Li Zhengjing’s heart sank. 

"You said no one above the Internal Qi level would appear," he whispered. "This man’s aura is overwhelming—he’s at the True Qi stage." 

Gritting his teeth, he asked, "Can my Blazing Sun Divine Sword handle him?" 

"Even True Qi experts are still flesh and blood," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official replied. "If you land a hit, he’ll be reduced to ashes." 

"And if I miss?" 

"You’ll die." 

"What are my chances of hitting him?" 

"Less than ten percent." 

"That low?" Li Zhengjing’s expression darkened. 

"His movement technique is exceptional—'Phantom Steps of the Wraith.' Among True Qi experts, it’s renowned," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official explained. "Your cultivation is far beneath his. The odds of your Blazing Sun Divine Sword connecting are slim." 

"So I’m doomed?" Li Zhengjing sighed. "Then I won’t bother. If the outcome’s the same, you handle it." 

"No need. You’ll win this fight." 

"Win?" Li Zhengjing was stunned. 

"With my guidance, how could you lose?" The Ghost Valley Spirit Official chuckled. 

"How do I win, then?" 

"Go out and slash him once. One strike is enough." 

"Really?" 

"Really." 

"..." 

Li Zhengjing suspected the Ghost Valley Spirit Official was trying to get him killed to silence him. 

Steadying himself, he checked the golden page’s divination. 

His fortune remained unchanged. 

Relieved, he leaped down and drew his blade. 

Skeptical but trusting the guidance, he advanced. 

"Die!" 

Elder Shi unleashed his True Qi, stirring a violent gust of wind and a storm of dust. 

Li Zhengjing braced himself, trusting the golden page’s prediction, and swung his blade. 

His strike met an invisible barrier. 

Through the swirling dust, Elder Shi’s aged face came into view. 

Li Zhengjing’s blade hovered a foot away, blocked by the elder’s True Qi shield. 

Just as he prepared to unleash the Blazing Sun Divine Sword from his left hand— 

The True Qi barrier suddenly vanished! 

Li Zhengjing’s blade surged forward unimpeded. 

The edge sliced down from the elder’s shoulder, cleaving through his chest and exiting at his ribs. 

Blood sprayed as the elder let out a piercing shriek and was sent flying dozens of feet. 

Amid the dust, his furious voice echoed: 

"What a mighty blade!" 

"As expected of the Ghost Valley Spirit Official’s guardian!" 

"This strike could split mountains, part seas, and slay immortals!" 

"I admit defeat today…" 

His voice faded as he retreated, filled with indignation. 

"Remember this strike! I will repay it in kind!" 

By the time the dust settled, the elder had vanished. 

Li Zhengjing stared at his blade in silence. 

Inside the carriage, the Wall-Climbing Bird poked its head out, awestruck. 

"His blade is even deadlier than the Blazing Sun Divine Sword?" 

"Splitting mountains? Parting seas? Slaying immortals?" 

"Master has been hiding his true power!" 

The bird gasped in amazement. 

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its roots. "I always knew Master was no ordinary man! He’s a master of deception, a celestial reborn, a banished immortal! That’s why I willingly crawled into his sack back then!"
