# Chapter 6: Innate Technique

Lin Shan's calm heart began to race again—just when all hope seemed lost, the answer appeared right before his eyes!

He turned his head guiltily to glance at the shopkeeper, who remained reclined on the rattan chair, feigning sleep as lazily as ever, not having moved an inch all morning.

Returning his attention to the statue, Lin Shan examined it carefully. The base was a nine-petal lotus throne, upon which sat an ancient Buddha of unknown origin. The Buddha's expression was serene, neither joyful nor sorrowful. The craftsmanship appeared crude and rough, full of uneven pits and grooves. The entire statue was pitch-black, seemingly carved from wood.

"What's the origin of this Black Lotus Buddha statue? It looks like a mass-produced, shoddy product... though it does seem genuinely ancient."

He flipped through the ledger and found the appraiser's note: "Material and craftsmanship comparable to ordinary Black Lotus Buddha statues, but estimated to be 800 years old. Value: 20 gold."

Twenty gold was equivalent to 200 taels of silver. But what caught Lin Shan's attention was the appraiser's wording—"comparable to ordinary Black Lotus Buddha statues." 

Had the appraiser seen other statues of this type before? Lin Shan made a mental note to investigate further. This could very well lead him to other sources of ancient essence.

His only concern was what would happen when he absorbed the statue's essence. When he had absorbed the essence from *Spring River and Mandarin Ducks*, the ancient painting had instantly crumbled to dust. What kind of commotion would this Black Lotus Buddha statue cause?

After a brief hesitation, the temptation of obtaining the ancient essence and immediately cultivating an innate technique overcame his doubts.

"Take it! Out of all the antiques in the pawnshop, this is the only one with essence. If I miss this chance, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Whatever the consequences, just do it!"

With a fierce determination burning inside, Lin Shan acted swiftly, following the prompt from the enhancement panel.

"Absorb!"

A faint glimmer passed over the Black Lotus Buddha statue on the ground, though it seemed otherwise unchanged. Meanwhile, the number in the top-right corner of Lin Shan's transparent enhancement panel shifted from "3" to "4."

"Hah—"

Suppressing his excitement, Lin Shan closed the panel and examined the statue again. Only then did he notice the intricate web of fine cracks covering its surface. 

He carefully withdrew his hand, sighing in relief. There was no doubt that the slightest touch would cause the statue to collapse like a sandcastle, turning into a pile of dust.

After his misdeed, Lin Shan stole another glance at the shopkeeper. Confirming he hadn't been noticed, he quietly slipped out of the back room and exited the shop. The streets were nearly empty at midday, with only a few scattered birds braving the scorching sun.

---

Lin Shan dragged a small stool to the shop entrance and sat down, his mind racing with impatience to return home.

Before long, the faint sound of the shopkeeper's snoring drifted from inside.

...

By evening, the sky was painted in hues of red.

The sound of a lock clicking behind him startled Lin Shan from his doze. Turning, he saw the refreshed face of the old shopkeeper.

"Kid, we're closing up. Time to head back."

The shopkeeper squinted with a smile as he firmly locked the pawnshop door, humming a tune as he strolled home.

Rubbing his sleepy eyes, Lin Shan watched the shopkeeper's sprightly steps and couldn't help but muse, "If this job existed in my past life—sleeping and slacking off all day while raking in money—wouldn't that be the dream?"

Without delay, he dashed back to the Lin estate, stirring up a flurry of startled chickens and barking dogs along the way.

...

After a hasty meal, Lin Shan returned to his quarters and retrieved the *Song Crane Technique*.

**[Song Crane Technique]**  
Quality: Mortal Technique  
Description: The Lin family's exclusive internal art. Offensive power is slightly weak, but it possesses healing properties. Upon mastery, it slightly extends lifespan. Maximum cultivation level: Mortal Perfection.  
Enhancement Cost: 4 points  

Without hesitation, Lin Shan commanded, "Enhance!"

The yellowed manual he had flipped through for a decade suddenly began rustling on its own. Pages flipped rapidly as diagrams of meridian pathways transformed before his eyes. The entire book trembled as if stirred by an invisible wind, while an ethereal force rewrote its contents. Words vanished and reappeared, and streams of radiant light coalesced into a rainbow across the pages.

*Snap!*

The book closed itself, emerging from a hazy white glow as a brand-new manual:

**[Evergreen Art]**  
Quality: Innate Technique  
Description: Can be cultivated up to Innate Perfection. Greatly accelerates cultivation speed and moderately extends lifespan. Upon mastery, the practitioner's qi becomes deep and enduring, capable of healing internal meridian injuries.  
Derived Skill: Severing Life Palm  
Striking an opponent disrupts their life force. When pressed against plants, it can extract their vitality to aid in healing.  
Enhancement Cost: 8 points  

"An innate technique indeed! Not only is it powerful, but it even comes with a bonus skill!" 

Lin Shan was overjoyed. The *Evergreen Art*, as an innate technique, naturally surpassed mortal techniques in cultivation speed. As for the lifespan extension, it held little appeal to his sixteen-year-old self.

Though the description didn't specify the offensive power of Evergreen Qi, its emphasis on endurance and healing suggested it would at least be reliable for survival.

The derived skill, *Severing Life Palm*, was even more astonishing. Disrupting an enemy's life force was understandable, but absorbing vitality from plants to heal? Were innate techniques truly this miraculous?

Given Lin Shan's current understanding, the mechanics eluded him—but that didn't matter. He would cultivate it regardless.

As for further enhancing the innate technique? 

With zero ancient essence left, such thoughts were premature.

...

After a night of cultivation, Lin Shan felt invigorated. The white qi in his dantian had been replaced by a verdant energy.

"Qi can change color? Does this mean there are elemental affinities like metal, wood, water, fire, and earth? But why have I never heard of this before?"

Lin Shan frowned in suspicion. The *Evergreen Art* and the enhancement panel's description led him to speculate, but other clansmen cultivated techniques like *Blazing Fire Art* and *Rolling Stone Fist* without ever mentioning colorful qi.

He could only attribute it to the innate technique's uniqueness. After all, the enhancement panel wouldn't deceive him.

Over the next few days, having already exploited the pawnshop, Lin Shan switched to menial tasks to avoid suspicion. He spent his time familiarizing himself with his new innate technique, keeping himself occupied.

...

The peace didn't last. Five days later, at dawn in the back mountains:

"Did you hear? A powerful expert stormed into our Lin family's pawnshop in Qinghe City yesterday."

Lin Shan, who had been lazily practicing calisthenics nearby, immediately perked up his ears.

"Of course! They say it was a master who has reached the Transformation Realm. Three of our outer hall supervisors went to handle it and were all sent back defeated."

"Our Lin family is a big target—who knows when we might have offended a first-rate expert? But why target the pawnshop?"

"Apparently, the pawnshop damaged something the expert had entrusted to them twelve years ago."

"Tsk, the shopkeeper is in deep trouble now."

"No kidding!"

...

Lin Shan broke into a cold sweat, already piecing together the truth.

If his guess was correct, the expert's pawned item had been the Black Lotus Buddha statue.

He had originally planned to return to the pawnshop later to inquire about other such statues from the appraiser.

Thank the heavens he hadn't!

He could easily imagine the expert's fury upon finding his precious antique reduced to dust upon retrieval.

Though the Lin family was influential in Qinghe City, their reclusive innate ancestor rarely intervened in worldly affairs. A first-rate expert could roam the martial world freely—such figures were not to be trifled with unless absolutely necessary.

Since the Lin family was at fault, the poor shopkeeper had unwittingly taken the fall for Lin Shan.

He silently mourned for the shopkeeper, though there was nothing he could do.

Coincidentally, Lin Fan had previously drawn attention away from Lin Shan when the family head's beloved painting went missing—a scandal that had since died down.

"It seems I'll need to be even more careful from now on."

Dodging disaster once or twice was luck, but he couldn't rely on others to shield him forever.

Lin Shan had a foreboding sense that his quest for ancient essence would be fraught with challenges.
