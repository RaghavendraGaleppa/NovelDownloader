# Chapter 62: Netherwater Serpent Soul Bell  

Half an hour later, the second phase of the internal trading session officially began.  

Following the attendant's guidance, Zhang Jing found a seat at the edge of the hall. After a moment's thought, he listed some of the resources he currently possessed on a piece of silk cloth—several demonic cores purified of residual demonic thoughts, various mid-grade talismans, and batches of low-grade talismans.  

At the same time, he wrote down the resources he desired on another piece of cloth—demonic cores, especially high-grade ones.  

For now, Zhang Jing refrained from listing the Spirit God Liquid. He had already witnessed its immense value during the first phase of the trading session and understood clearly that it would be his key to exchanging for the rare resources held by senior disciples during this second phase.  

According to the senior sister's earlier explanation, many participants in this phase weren't looking for Dao Merits but rather sought to trade their items for specific resources. The only thing Zhang Jing could currently offer that might catch their attention was the Spirit God Liquid.  

After instructing the attendant to keep watch, Zhang Jing stood up and began strolling leisurely around the hall, carefully examining the displayed items in hopes of finding one or two treasures suitable for himself.  

Most people, like Zhang Jing, were moving about, while only a dozen or so remained seated with their eyes closed, seemingly confident that others would approach them.  

As time passed, those dozen or so disciples indeed attracted growing crowds. Zhang Jing joined the throng.  

Before one senior sister lay a dragon-like spiritual root, its severed end exuding an intense earthy aura. Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened. Just from the aura, he could tell this was an extremely high-grade earth-attribute spiritual herb. In terms of rarity, only the few herbs at the center of that mysterious medicinal garden from before could compare.  

He checked her requirements: a wood-attribute spiritual herb of equivalent grade or a high-grade spiritual pill of corresponding value.  

Zhang Jing shook his head and withdrew.  

*What a pity it's not a water-attribute herb. Otherwise, I might have considered offering some Spirit God Liquid to see if she'd be willing to trade.*  

Over the next while, Zhang Jing browsed the offerings of other senior disciples. Without exception, they displayed extremely rare treasures, but their trading conditions were equally stringent.  

Eventually, his steps halted before a petite senior sister. His gaze locked onto a small black bell the size of a palm placed before her.  

**Netherwater Serpent Soul Bell**—a high-grade magical artifact.  

According to the description, this artifact possessed immense power. The bell's body was sealed with the souls of three Netherwater Black Serpents at the ninth layer of Qi Refinement. When fully activated, the three serpents would emerge from the bell, spewing Netherwater Frost Poison that corroded flesh and froze spiritual senses.  

Zhang Jing felt a stirring in his heart.  

In terms of aura alone, this Netherwater Serpent Soul Bell surpassed even the Yellow Dragon Whip, which had fetched a high price earlier. Moreover, the bell was a water-attribute artifact—perfect for him.  

Though he was reluctant to use five high-grade artifacts to form the Five Treasures Spirit River, Zhang Jing felt that using a single high-grade artifact aligned with his attributes as the core would be far superior to five mid-grade artifacts.  

Determination gradually filled his eyes.  

After some haggling, Zhang Jing finally exchanged two qian of Spirit God Liquid for the Netherwater Serpent Soul Bell.  

A thrill of excitement surged within him.  

*Just obtaining this bell alone makes today's trip worthwhile.*  

Returning to his seat in high spirits, Zhang Jing quietly asked the attendant behind him, "Has anyone come to inquire?"  

"Reporting to the immortal, not yet," the attendant replied nervously.  

"It's fine." Zhang Jing smiled, though inwardly he felt a twinge of unease.  

*It seems mid-grade talismans aren't very popular at this level of trading session, and low-grade ones even less so. But even purified demonic cores aren't attracting interest?*  

His gaze unconsciously drifted toward the still-crowded areas.  

*Perhaps the alchemists are all drawn to the high-grade spiritual herbs and treasures.* He tried to console himself.  

As his thoughts wandered, light footsteps suddenly approached.  

Zhang Jing looked up to see a man around forty years old, with a shrewd appearance and a thin mustache. His cultivation was likely at the late Qi Refinement stage.  

"Senior Brother, are you looking for something?" Zhang Jing greeted warmly.  

The mustached senior brother's eyes gleamed cunningly as he asked in a low voice, "This humble brother is surnamed Gou, single name Sheng, at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement. May I ask how this junior brother is addressed?"  

"Zhang Jing greets Senior Brother Gou." Zhang Jing remained composed and repeated, "Does Senior Brother Gou wish to trade for something?"  

Seeing the senior brother's reluctance to get to the point, Zhang Jing understood—this man's intentions were anything but pure.  

"Ah, Junior Brother Zhang, greetings." Senior Brother Gou's face broke into a wide smile, his mustache twitching comically.  

"Brother has a question—might Junior Brother enlighten me?"  

"Please speak, Senior Brother."  

*Here it comes.* Zhang Jing grew wary.  

"Junior Brother, I've been pondering for a while. You're both selling and buying demonic cores—could it be you have a method to quickly purify demonic remnants?"  

Without waiting for an answer, he continued persuasively,  

"Junior Brother, as the saying goes, many hands make light work. Since you possess such a method, why not consider cooperating with me? I'll handle purchasing and selling the cores, and you only need to purify the remnants.  

"I'm at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement, higher than you, and I'll shoulder the hardest work.  

"We can split the Dao Merits—30% for you, 70% for me. How about it?  

"With just a flick of your fingers, you'd earn at least two or three hundred Dao Merits monthly. Such an opportunity is hard to come by!"  

Senior Brother Gou spoke as if he had Zhang Jing's best interests at heart.  

"Or, if you find it troublesome, you could simply hand the method over to me. I'll give you 15% of the Dao Merits I earn.  

"After all, at only the fourth layer of Qi Refinement, such a method is somewhat wasted in your hands."  

"Thank you for the offer, Senior Brother. I'll consider it," Zhang Jing declined politely.  

"Then take your time, Junior Brother. I'll wait right here until you decide."  

Senior Brother Gou seemed oblivious to Zhang Jing's refusal and plopped down in front of him, as if unwilling to leave without an agreement.  

Zhang Jing frowned, a hint of frost entering his gaze.  

Just then, a hoarse voice interrupted.  

"Junior Brother Zhang, so you're here too."  

The voice then berated Senior Brother Gou, "This junior brother, if you're not here to trade, don't block the way. What kind of behavior is this?"  

A flash of resentment crossed Senior Brother Gou's face. But when he saw the speaker, his pupils contracted slightly. Without another word, he stood and walked away.  

Clearly, this was someone he dared not provoke.  

"Thank you for the assistance, Senior Brother Yan." Zhang Jing said gratefully.  

"Pay that clown no mind, Junior Brother." Senior Brother Yan chuckled.  

"By the way, Senior Brother, does our team still have mid-grade artifacts available for exchange?"  

Seizing the opportunity, Zhang Jing asked.  

"We do. If you need them, I suggest waiting until Senior Brother Li returns. He has some exceptionally fine mid-grade artifacts."  

Senior Brother Yan replied without hesitation.  

Zhang Jing nodded, reassured.  

As they spoke, a hearty laugh rang out.  

"Haha, Junior Brother Yan, I knew I'd find you with Junior Brother Zhang."  

Zhang Jing and Senior Brother Yan turned to see Senior Sister Liu Nanshu, Senior Brother He, and Fairy Shen Qingqing approaching.  

"Greetings, Senior Sister Liu, Senior Brother He, and Fairy Shen." Zhang Jing followed Senior Brother Yan's lead.  

The three stopped before Zhang Jing.  

"Brother Zhang, long time no see." Shen Qingqing peeked out from behind, her eyes curving into a bright smile.  

Meanwhile, Liu Nanshu nodded with a smile and said lightly,  

"Junior Brother Yan."  

Then she turned to Zhang Jing, a flicker of surprise in her eyes.  

The next moment, she remarked half-jokingly, "Junior Brother Zhang has already reached the mid-stage of Qi Refinement? Had I known, I would've fought harder with Junior Brother Yang Chu over you."  

"You flatter me, Senior Sister." Zhang Jing replied evenly.  

"Junior Brother, you're selling purified demonic cores?"  

Senior Brother He glanced down, a strange light flashing in his eyes as he sighed,  

"What a shame so few alchemists came today. Otherwise, you'd be swarmed by now."  

*So that's why.*  

Zhang Jing finally understood why no one had shown interest in his purified demonic cores.  

After some small talk, Liu Nanshu fixed her gaze on Zhang Jing, a trace of tension in her voice:  

"Junior Brother Zhang, do you still have any Spirit God Liquid? Senior Sister is willing to pay a high price."
