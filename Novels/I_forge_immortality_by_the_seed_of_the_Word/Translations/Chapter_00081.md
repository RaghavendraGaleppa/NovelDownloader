# Chapter 80: Zhang Doesn't Lack Merit Points

After leaving Senior Brother Li's place, Zhang Jing didn't return to his cave abode but instead went straight back to the Merit Points Hall. A month had passed—it was time to check on the progress of the personal task he had posted earlier. His stock of spirit herbs had been completely exhausted and urgently needed replenishment.

Although he had obtained three bottles of Water Essence Pills from Senior Brother Li, these were barely better than nothing for Zhang Jing—only slightly more effective than directly absorbing spiritual energy, and nowhere near as potent as water-attribute spirit herbs or demon cores.

Second floor.

"Senior Brother Steward," a female disciple seated behind a counter immediately stood up upon seeing Zhang Jing and came forward to greet him.

"Junior Sister Feng," Zhang Jing nodded with a smile. This was the same disciple who had handled his personal task posting last time. It was convenient that she happened to be on duty again today.

Inside a quiet room, Zhang Jing sat upright and asked softly, "Junior Sister, how has the task I posted last month progressed? Are there any merit points left from the initial five hundred?"

Posting personal tasks required depositing merit points in advance. After exchanging his remaining points for the top-grade Habit Technique at the Inheritance Pavilion, Zhang Jing had been nearly broke. Left with no choice, he had spent several days crafting talismans until he accumulated enough to post his task for collecting water-attribute demon cores and spirit herbs.

As soon as he finished speaking, Junior Sister Feng, as if prepared, produced a translucent jade box. She opened it to reveal several demon cores inside and handed it to Zhang Jing with both hands.

"Senior Brother, these are the demon cores exchanged this month. Please take a look. As for water-attribute spirit herbs, none have been obtained yet. Also—" She hesitated.

Zhang Jing took the jade box. Inside were five demon cores—one at Qi Refining sixth layer, one at fifth layer, and the remaining three at third layer. This was unexpectedly few. He had come prepared to deposit more merit points, thinking five hundred might not be enough, only to find that even this modest amount hadn't been fully utilized.

Noticing the expression on Junior Sister Feng's face, Zhang Jing realized something must have happened that he wasn't aware of. His expression remained unchanged. "Feel free to speak your mind, Junior Sister."

Hearing this, Junior Sister Feng sighed slightly and explained, "Senior Brother Zhang, your collection task was initially progressing smoothly. But later, several alchemists from the Coiling Dragon Team posted similar tasks for water-attribute demon cores at higher prices, so..."

She trailed off, then added, "We didn't have the authority to modify your task parameters without permission."

So that was it. Zhang Jing finally understood. Alchemists collecting demon cores wasn't unusual—he just hadn't expected to run into competition. Those people were swimming in resources. An ordinary steward might have gritted their teeth and endured it, but—

Demon cores and spirit herbs were crucial to his cultivation. There was no room for compromise. Without much thought, he stored the demon cores, a faint smile flashing in his eyes. His identity token appeared in his hand.

"Junior Sister, here are fifteen hundred merit points. Continue collecting water-attribute demon cores and spirit herbs. Set the price half a percent higher than those alchemists' offers." Right now, Zhang might be lacking in many things, but merit points weren't one of them.

Inside his cave abode, in the talisman crafting chamber:

Source Talismans flickered as one lower-grade talisman after another took form. A thick stack of spirit paper on the table fluttered so fast it left afterimages. The air was thick with the scent of merit points.

Zhang Jing's mind stirred as his jade talisman materialized:

[Ninefold Stellar Talisman Art • Level 5 (551/1600)]
Skill Traits: Talisman Source Generation (Intermediate), Dao Overlay Spirit Gathering (Intermediate)

"With the Source Talisman, leveling up the Ninefold Stellar Talisman Art is indeed faster," he mused silently. His gaze swept over the newly acquired skill trait [Dao Overlay Spirit Gathering], but his heart remained unmoved.

Dao Overlay Spirit Gathering allowed him to ignore existing Dao patterns and inscribe new ones on completed talismans. Theoretically, as long as Zhang Jing's spiritual power, consciousness, and materials could sustain it, he could overlay countless Dao patterns—of the same or different types—on a single talisman.

At first glance, this seemed highly versatile. Unfortunately, Zhang Jing felt it wouldn't contribute much to earning merit points—at best, it would let him craft a few "special talismans" as trump cards. What interested him more was the mid-grade Source Talisman.

In his vision, three incomplete mid-grade Source Talismans gradually materialized. "Almost there. At this rate, it'll only take half a month to complete them," he thought, a spark of excitement in his eyes. Once the mid-grade Source Talisman was ready, his merit point acquisition speed would skyrocket.

Over ten days later, at the Merit Points Hall of the Xunfeng Team (ranked seventh in the outer sect):

Several mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators were chatting excitedly. "Heavens! The stewards from the Luodu Team and Coiling Dragon Team are at it again. They've driven up the price of water-attribute demon cores and spirit herbs by over fifty percent!"

"Those alchemists are ridiculously rich!" Their voices were full of awe and envy.

Suddenly, a few seemed to realize something and hurried out. "Hey, where are you going?" someone called after them.

"While fools stand around marveling, the wise are already out hunting water-attribute demons. Opportunities to earn merit points like this don't come often!" they shouted without turning back, prompting a rush of disciples following suit.

Similar scenes played out across other teams.

On Coiling Dragon Island, inside a cave abode:

"This is madness! What kind of reckless alchemist does the Luodu Team have? How can they afford these prices?" After a moment of silence, the voice continued, resigned, "Fine, you win. You've got more merit points, you're amazing. I'll just stop refining Water Essence Pills then. If I can't compete, I'll withdraw!"

In stark contrast to the fervor outside, the atmosphere in Luodu Tower was tense. Senior Brother Li sat at the head of the table, his gaze icy. The deputy captains seated on either side, including Senior Brother Li, all wore grave expressions.

"What are your thoughts, brothers?" Senior Brother Li broke the silence.

"Senior Brother, we can't back down. If we yield now, the Luodu Team's reputation will be ruined! What will the other seven teams think?"

"Exactly. If we retreat now, they'll push further. At worst, Luodu might be squeezed out of the top tier. The loss of resources would be minor, but we'd lose our competitive edge against Coiling Dragon and Misty Dawn Teams for top recruitment rights in the outer sect exams."

"Everyone knows we can't retreat, but how do we counter? Coiling Dragon and Misty Dawn are clearly exploiting this situation, and the inner sect seniors' stance is—" The speaker suddenly cut himself off.

"Damn it! If only we hadn't honored that agreement during the last outer sect exam and directly recruited those two A-grade talents. We wouldn't be in this mess now," someone muttered bitterly.

"Enough!" Senior Brother Li snapped. "I'll seek out Senior Brother!" With that, he stood and strode out.

Half an hour later, on the second floor of the Inheritance Pavilion:

A tall figure in purple robes stood with hands clasped behind his back, his demeanor serene. Behind him, Senior Brother Li waited respectfully, stealing occasional glances at the man's back but remaining silent.

This was Senior Brother Xie Yu, one of the inner sect disciples backing the Luodu Team.

After a long pause, Xie Yu turned. "Junior Brother Yuanxing, I understand why you're here, but... this matter involves the inner sect pavilions' competition over Junior Brother Chen and Junior Sister Shen. There's little room for compromise. For now, Luodu Team will have to swallow this loss."

"Is there truly no other way? Senior Brother, you emerged from Luodu Team—how can you bear to see—" Senior Brother Li pleaded, his voice thick with frustration. He couldn't stand by and watch Luodu decline under his leadership.

"By the way, Junior Brother Li." Xie Yu suddenly turned fully, his gaze piercing. Ignoring the previous question, he asked with a faint smile, "Recently, you purchased a large quantity of Water Essence Pills, didn't you? As I recall, you have no use for them yourself."
