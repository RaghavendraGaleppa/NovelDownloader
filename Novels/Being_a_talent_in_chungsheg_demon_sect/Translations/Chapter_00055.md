Chapter 55: The Witch-Ghost Emerges, The True Man Reaps His Harvest

Although Ming Chan was a rogue cultivator, he had inherited the teachings of the Buddhist Sect, thus he had some understanding of Foundation Establishment True Men, and knew just how terrifying this realm was. The term "Foundation Establishment" was merely a designation within immortal sects. In the Buddhist Sect, it was known by another name: "Lotus Pedestal." Cultivators who established their Dao foundation were called "True Men," while those who studied Buddhism and ascended to the Lotus Pedestal were called "Arhats." Though their names differed, their ultimate destinations were the same.

"An Arhat... There's an Arhat behind Skull Mountain!"

"Damn it, what fortune! It's all fake! Clearly, an Arhat is luring people in; even if there were any real opportunities, that Arhat would have already claimed them!"

"Amitabha... *F*ck!"

At this moment, Ming Chan had completely lost the appearance of a Buddhist monk, his old habits resurfacing amidst his panic, spewing out endless profanities. After all, before he cultivated Buddhism, he had been a mountain bandit. It was quite ironic; every time he finished killing someone or robbing a path, he would prostrate himself before a Buddha statue. He never imagined that one day he would truly stumble upon a Buddhist opportunity. The opportunity even claimed it was due to the merits he had accumulated in his previous lives. Thus, he "laid down the butcher's knife and became a Buddha on the spot." From then on, everything went smoothly for Ming Chan. He effortlessly broke through to Qi Condensation Great Perfection, just a step away from Foundation Establishment.

Yet now, he only felt dread. His previously unfailing merits from three lives and overwhelming destiny seemed to have lost their effect at this moment, only able to frantically warn him from the ethereal depths. Danger! Certain death! Run! Ming Chan ran and ran, but gradually stopped. Sweat streamed down his bald head. He looked around and found himself still in the same place he had started. What was this place? Had he truly been running just now?

"I..."

Filled with doubt, the Buddhist light in Ming Chan's eyes gradually extinguished. He 'accidentally' suffered cultivation deviation, and his Dharma body, cultivated for decades, thus lost its vitality. He was dead. From beginning to end, the Foundation Establishment True Man had not even shown himself. With just a slight ripple on the great net of karma, Ming Chan had naturally and logically met his sudden death.

Meanwhile, outside Skull Mountain Market.

Yun Zhiqiu and Ouyang Feng were equally drenched in sweat. They hadn't fled, not because they reacted slower than Ming Chan, but because they knew escape was futile. With a Foundation Establishment True Man present, how could you possibly escape? Rogue cultivators simply lacked insight. Especially Yun Zhiqiu; as Lu Yang broke through, he felt his previously clouded spiritual platform suddenly clear, followed by an intense surge of dread in his heart. What was I doing? What had I just done?

Just then, a figure quietly appeared. It was a young man in black robes, with a somber face and pale complexion. At first glance, he seemed like an ordinary Daoist priest one might encounter anywhere in the mortal world.

"...Greetings, Senior!"

Without hesitation, Yun Zhiqiu immediately put away his sword and bowed.

True Man Yinshan paid him no mind, his gaze fixed intently on Skull Mountain below. At the base of the mountain, a dark flame was slowly rising from the earth's ley lines.

On the other side, Lu Yang also experienced a sudden enlightenment. "The Witch-Ghost Secret Realm..." The karmic destiny in the ethereal told him that as he broke through, his fortune reached its peak, causing the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm to sense him and choose him for its emergence.

"...It truly was a trap!"

The next second, the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm, which had been continuously emitting a sense of affinity towards him, suddenly paused. Immediately afterwards, intense rage and fear erupted from within it. These were the emotions of the secret realm's spirit. The fish had taken the bait.

"Come here."

True Man Yinshan spoke slowly, revealing no divine abilities. Yet, with just that one sentence, the newly emerged Witch-Ghost Secret Realm flew uncontrollably towards him. Lu Yang couldn't help but curse inwardly: "F*ck!" Because within the opened secret realm, there was a dazzling sword qi, crouching like a coiling dragon and crouching tiger, seemingly waiting to deliver a fatal blow to whoever was outside!

*Zheng—!*

The next second, Lu Yang's thoughts froze. All he could see was a single sword qi that had locked onto him, as if it had seen through his entire being.

"Golden Core Sword Qi..." True Man Yinshan took a step back, shielding Lu Yang. This was precisely why he had always been unwilling to act personally, choosing instead to remain hidden behind the scenes. In an instant, True Man Yinshan's heart was filled with relief. After all, if he had personally opened the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm, then the unlucky fellow targeted by the sword qi at this moment would likely be him. In front of Golden Core Sword Qi, there was no difference between Foundation Establishment and Qi Condensation; both were just a single strike.

However, to his surprise, the sword qi did not strike. Lu Yang only felt his recently perfected True Qi, the third-grade "True Dragon Malignance," tremble slightly, seemingly resonating with the sword qi in the secret realm. The two sides were locked in a stalemate.

"...Hm?"

Witnessing this, even True Man Yinshan let out a soft exclamation of surprise, casting an unexpected glance at Lu Yang. He clearly hadn't anticipated such a variable. It was unclear how much time passed. Lu Yang seemed to have passed some kind of test from the sword qi. It no longer struck but instead dissipated on the spot, transforming into surging spiritual energy that returned to heaven and earth.

"Ugh!"

Lu Yang suddenly snapped back to his senses, his frozen thoughts resuming. His entire body was instantly drenched in sweat, as if he had just been pulled from water.

"The Nine Transformations Dragon Transformation Art, a legacy of True Man Coiling Dragon? Your luck is good; True Man Coiling Dragon was not a demonic cultivator."

"That Golden Core Sword Qi specifically targets demonic cultivators. If you had cultivated my Holy Sect's cultivation techniques, you would undoubtedly have died. Fortunately, you cultivate the Nine Transformations Dragon Transformation Art."

True Man Yinshan scrutinized Lu Yang, somewhat surprised, but not overly concerned. After all, the quality of the bait was not important, and Lu Yang's life or death made little difference to him. The key was whether the fish had been caught. Since the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm had emerged, his objective for this trip was accomplished. It was time to reel in the line.

True Man Yinshan raised his hand and grabbed. The Witch-Ghost Secret Realm, which had just emerged with its dark flame soaring into the sky, instantly vanished, transforming into a stream of light that fell into his palm.

"Excellent, excellent! A perfect Heavenly Corpse Malignance!"

True Man Yinshan looked pleased. Cultivation in the Foundation Establishment realm held other mysteries, among which was the need for Earth Fiend Qi, and Heavenly Corpse Malignance was the supreme grade among Earth Fiend Qi. With this item, his breakthrough to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment was practically guaranteed!

Just then, Lu Yang abruptly stepped forward, and without a word, knelt on one knee, declaring loudly: "Congratulations, Senior Brother, on obtaining this great fortune! From this day forward, the Great Dao is within your grasp!"

Not far away, Luo Wuya, the Second Senior Brother of the Three Rivers Society, instantly changed his expression. That son of a bitch, he got ahead of me! No wonder this kid could stand out among ordinary disciples! Truly a disciple of my Holy Sect, a shameless flatterer... Luo Wuya cursed Lu Yang inwardly, while also rushing forward without delay: "Congratulations, Senior Brother, on an immortal lifespan of a thousand years!"

"Hahaha, a thousand years is the lifespan of a Golden Core cultivator. This elder brother cannot accept such praise, cannot accept..."

Although he said this, True Man Yinshan clearly enjoyed the flattery. While his mouth denied it, he secretly wished Lu Yang and Luo Wuya would offer more. In the end, even Yun Zhiqiu and Ouyang Feng braced themselves and offered a few words of congratulations.

However, upon hearing them, True Man Yinshan cast a playful glance at Ouyang Feng: "The Divine Martial Gate openly provoked my Holy Sect. And you still dare to speak in front of me?"

Ouyang Feng's scalp instantly exploded with terror. He stammered: "You can't kill me! My... my Divine Martial Gate also has True Men—"

"There won't be any in the future." True Man Yinshan casually uttered words that made Ouyang Feng's liver and gall split: "Since this Venerable One can appear here, the Divine Martial Gate's destiny is already exhausted."

"Th-this is impossible! My Divine Martial Gate—"

Ouyang Feng's words died in his throat as his entire body's qi and blood inexplicably ran wild. Under his shock and rage, his unguarded mind was powerless to suppress it, and he could only widen his eyes—

*Bang!!!*

With a loud explosion, Ouyang Feng, a Qi Condensation Great Perfection cultivator, abruptly burst apart, transforming into a sky full of light particles that quietly merged into heaven and earth!

Only when the light particles dissipated did True Man Yinshan shift his gaze. Yun Zhiqiu, who hailed from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion, was drenched in cold sweat from watching. However, in the end, True Man Yinshan did not make a move against him. Instead, he waved his sleeve, and disappeared from the spot along with Luo Wuya and Lu Yang, leaving behind only a silent Skull Mountain.
