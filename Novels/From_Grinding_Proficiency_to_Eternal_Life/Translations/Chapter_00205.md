# Chapter 205: The Great Qian Luo Net

He left the Colonel alive for the express purpose of allowing the message to be relayed back. His intent was to draw the attention of the Great Qian military department, deployed in Qingzhou and Cangzhou, onto himself.

The disciples of the Sky-Work Cave Giant Kite Team lingered in Yanbei Dao all day, so he was well aware that the vast majority of the Great Qian military forces were tied up by the Nine耀 Sect and Yanbei City. That was why he acted in this manner.

"Senior Brother, this is the only thing this Junior Brother can do for you."

Half an hour later, at the pass of Cangwu Ridge.

Just as the triple-edged arrow was about to pierce the head of the warhorse beneath Xu Yunfan, the seven-foot-long Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swept up a blood-colored Gale. The arrow was immediately knocked away by the hammer's wind.

Before the hammer head even arrived, the blood energy within his body surged. The surging Red Python Strength rapidly erupted from his spine and transmitted to his arms, pouring into the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. The bursting Qi force blasted three heavy-armored spearmen away.

The chainmail of these elite Great Qian border troops tore apart like paper under the hammer wind. The sound of iron rings shattering mixed with the sound of bones breaking, exploding into seventeen blood lotuses on the official road.

"Flesh Refining Realm?"

A voice of surprise and doubt came from the end of the mountain path.

Great Qian Brave Commander Wang Ben, holding a bin iron spear, rode his horse forward. The golden silken ribbons wrapped around his tiger's mouth trembled incessantly.

The Black Cloud Treading Snow Horse beneath him snorted white mist from its nostrils, but it suddenly reared up twenty Zhang away.

The red blood energy steaming around Xu Yunfan actually caused this warhorse, which had drunk wolf blood, to dare not approach.

"Finally, someone worth looking at."

Xu Yunfan rested the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer on his shoulder and kicked the head of a struggling soldier beneath his feet until it shattered.

These madmen had openly slaughtered villages before arriving, intending to kill innocents to claim merit.

Wang Ben's eyes cracked with fine blood beads, looking at the broken armor all over the ground with eyes wide in rage.

Those comrades who had drunk water with him in the Hanhai were now embedded in the cracks of the official road in twisted postures. Broken bin iron spear shafts still hung half of blood-stained chainmail.

His throat rolled with a low growl honed by the wind and sand of the North, and his five fingers crushed the iron ring of the saddle into powder.

Wang Ben's chest cavity erupted with a thunder-like rumble. Thirty-nine dark red patterns climbed from his neck to his temples.

This was the True Blood of the Wang family, allowing one's actions to be as swift as the wind. At this moment, the burning of his True Blood caused the gravel within a radius of three Zhang to float into the air.

The Black Cloud Treading Snow Horse beneath him let out a mournful cry, foaming at the mouth as it collapsed to the ground. Its four hooves were suddenly crushed half a foot into the bedrock by the surging blood energy.

"You are truly unforgivable!"

Wang Ben took a deep breath, his expression carrying a hint of coldness.

"Those like you who use martial strength to cause chaos should have their three generations exterminated to resolve the hatred in my heart."

The玄 iron wrist guards burst apart as his muscles expanded. Wang Ben's exposed right arm appeared with strange patterns. The bin iron spear in his hand, weighing eighty-two catties, felt as light as a reed in his palm.

Xu Yunfan grinned, the muscles on his body twisting like pythons, each one like a steel cable, with deep grooves.

"You are still lacking. I am quite curious about how you people who possess True Blood developed it."

The moment his sole crushed the bluestone slab, the seven-foot heavy hammer turned into a red meteor.

The instant Wang Ben横 the spear to block, he finally saw the shadow of a red python entangled around the hammer head. It was actually formed by the explosive force of the hammer's Qi, condensed by his strength!

Wang Ben's pupils constricted. How could he not understand at this moment that the heavy hammer in the opponent's hand was a Treasure Artifact.

Isn't this just bullying people!

"Wait..."

The sound of metal clashing shook the pine needles down like rain.

When the bin iron spear bent into a full moon, Wang Ben's arm muscles snapped inch by inch.

The last thing he saw was the red patterns swimming beneath Xu Yunfan's bronze skin, as if a real python was tumbling beneath the skin and muscles.

"The eighth."

Xu Yunfan casually shook off the iron filings on the hammer head, his muscles slowly calming down. There wasn't a single opponent in the Flesh Refining Realm who could take a single move from him, making him somewhat suspect that he wasn't in the Flesh Refining Realm himself.

Three Yin winds suddenly attacked from behind. He didn't dodge or avoid, letting the poisoned bone-piercing nails hit his shoulder blades. The dragon-eye wood handles of the hidden weapons exploded into dust. The triple-edged nail heads scraped sparks off his bronze skin, not even leaving a white mark.

The shock of the three black-clothed assassins froze in their throats.

The Gale swept up by the sweeping heavy hammer卷起 their bodies, which hadn't even fallen yet, and smashed into the blue brick wall of the beacon tower.

From the dust, Xu Yunfan's thunderous shout came: "If you want to take Su's head, at least send a Blood Transformation Realm expert!"

The remaining soldiers trembled all over. Some could no longer hold their minds and fled in a鬼哭狼嚎 manner.

When the twilight dyed the pass red, the pass was already covered with three hundred broken armor and残 corpses.

Xu Yunfan stood at the pass of Cangwu Ridge, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer插 in the bluestone. He looked up at the battlements of the pass, now devoid of people, and couldn't help but be speechless.

After all, this world was a world of transcendence. A natural barrier guarded by hundreds of men was broken by him alone with a hammer.

He undid his rhinoceros leather belt, revealing eight abs as if cast from black iron. Three armor-piercing crossbow bolts were stuck in the muscle texture, the arrowheads only half an inch from his internal organs.

These three armor-piercing crossbow bolts were truly astonishing, actually able to break his Hardened Body Skill. The arrowheads on them were made of extraordinary material. If melted, they could be forged into a Treasure Artifact.

"Rise!"

As the Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength circulated, his back muscles surged like angry waves.

The three crossbow bolts shot back, and the newly erected ballista on the opposite bank immediately exploded into wooden chips.

Xu Yunfan grabbed the heavy hammer and leaped onto the pass. His bronze body shimmered with a metallic luster under the setting sun, like a guardian Vajra walking out of a temple.

Looking down, the elite Great Qian troops had been killed to the point where they lost their courage. Xu Yunfan didn't bother to pursue and kill them.

He just continued forward.

The direction he was heading had already been spread by these people. The Great Qian army in Qingzhou naturally knew that a powerful martial artist was destroying them from behind the lines.

A true expert appeared at the hour of Xu (7-9 PM).

When the mixed copper whip tore through the night, Xu Yunfan finally showed a solemn expression.

The newcomer wore a black fish-scale soft armor. When he moved, there was actually a dragon's cry accompanying him. The blood in his body rolled like waves. This was the sign of the small success of the Blood Transformation Realm!

The moment the heavy hammer collided with the copper whip, the earth and stones within a radius of three Zhang all rolled back like waves. The sound of metal rang through the pass.

"Cangwu Mountain, person of the Xuan Yue Sect?"

Before him appeared a middle-aged man holding a heavy whip, with a tiger's back and a bear's waist, his body like an iron tower.

The other party was also extremely surprised, and his expression unconsciously relaxed a bit: "You aren't Su Zhenhe of the Xuan Yue Sect. This hammer technique is clearly the style of the Divine Weapon Ridge."

"Sect Master of the Xuan Yue Sect, Shi Ze?"

"It is I."

Shi Ze's expression was calm, his gaze carrying a hint of appreciation.

"To be able to take a blow from me in the Flesh Refining Realm, your talent is quite good. It seems one of the three trainings—sinew, skin, and bone—has reached perfection."

Xu Yunfan's gaze was somewhat surprised.

"I thought the Incense Fire Sect slaughtered Qingzhou back then. I didn't expect to see someone from Qingzhou still alive."

A trace of sadness flashed in Shi Ze's eyes, disappearing in an instant. His expression remained calm.

"I didn't expect there to be a successor of the Divine Weapon Ridge wandering outside."

"Have you joined the Great Qian Luo Net?"

"In the current Great Zhou, I wish I could eat its flesh and drink its blood. One day, I will go to Yujing City and pull that female demon off the throne."

"Then let me see Sect Master Shi's skills first."

Xu Yunfan shook his somewhat numb hand, but his eyes ignited with fighting spirit.

The answer was the Storm-like Thirty-Six Styles of Shattering Star Whip Technique.
