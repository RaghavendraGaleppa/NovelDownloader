Chapter 178: Solo Battle Against Seven

Whiz! Whiz!

Divine lights, one after another, tore through the air with immense energy, creating terrifying and deafening sonic booms. Along their path, white mist shattered into pieces, all rushing straight towards Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian and Sacred Demon were the only allies present. Sacred Demon's strength was immense, and Zhou Tian was likely no weaker than him. If these two couldn't be dealt with, they would have no chance of seizing the lotus seed.

"Because I'm more awesome than him!"

Zhou Tian roared, and boundless energy surged from his body. With lightning as the foundation and crimson flames as fuel, he attempted to condense chaotic qi once more. He had discovered during his last battle with the King of Gods that this type of energy seemed quite potent. However, this attempt failed. The lightning pool exploded, and semi-finished energy gushed out. This was because he had currently replicated Sacred Demon's cultivation, which was only at the Half-step Dao Lord realm. His strength was insufficient to condense it. But even semi-finished chaotic energy possessed immense power. The four individuals had no choice but to retreat, avoiding its sharp edge.

On the other side, Sacred Demon's demonic energy surged sky-high, his hair shimmering. The Demon Controller took command of the body, and a great halberd swept across the sky like a Heavenly Chasm, blocking the three Heavenly Kings. If he were to use his 'Sacred Demon Assimilation' state, that would be Sacred Demon's true cultivation, Half-step Dao Lord, capable of forcefully sweeping aside the three. However, that state could not be easily activated due to severe side effects. He had only used a secret art to instantly kill a weaker Heavenly King upon arrival to establish his might. Now, he was about to obtain the lotus seed and undergo a fusion of personalities. If he used 'Sacred Demon Assimilation' now, he feared an unexpected complication.

"Zhou Tian!" the Demon Controller shouted, demonic flames swirling around him. He knew that Zhou Tian's miraculous divine ability had a time limit. They couldn't afford to delay. If the time ran out, he alone would be outnumbered, and even his 'Sacred Demon Assimilation' state was merely Half-step Dao Lord, not a true Dao Lord.

"Coming, bro!"

Thunder rumbled, and brilliant light surged around Zhou Tian. Crimson flame dragons coiled around his fists, accompanied by golden lightning. He smashed forward like this. He had now replicated Sacred Demon's Half-step Dao Lord realm, and was a Half-step Dao Lord in all aspects, including his physical body.

A crimson-haired Heavenly King dodged quickly but was still grazed, half his body a mangled mess of flesh and blood, rapidly repairing itself.

"Fellow Daoist, why lose your life for others!" the longsword-wielding Heavenly King roared.

Zhou Tian stood with his hands behind his back, his robes flapping loudly. His eyes were deep as he gazed at the seven Heavenly Kings before him. They were all peerless figures. Some shone like the sun, divine flames steaming, dazzling and awe-inspiring, becoming the focal point of the field. Others swallowed light like black holes, almost invisible, with swirling black mist nearby, emanating malevolent energy. Among them, some had eyes that emitted threads of silver light, forming tangible chains of order, while others had eyes as empty as black holes. A powerful wave of rule fluctuations spread out, crashing forward like raging tides. Their hostility towards Zhou Tian was extremely intense. Among these seven, there were no Half-step Dao Lord level Heavenly Kings. Dealing with the current Zhou Tian was indeed somewhat difficult for them.

"My little brother, I always have to look out for him," Zhou Tian shed his frivolous demeanor. He wasn't afraid of fighting them individually, but together, if he wasn't careful, he might truly fall into a trap.

"Then don't blame us!" the sword-wielding man said coldly. Sacred Demon had already touched the lotus seed, and his entire body was glowing. They could no longer delay.

The sword-wielding man was powerful. With a single step, he vanished from his spot, transforming into a streak of sword light. It was incredibly fast, appearing beside Zhou Tian, sword qi blooming with boundless killing intent, launching a decisive strike.

Clang! In that split second, Zhou Tian's feet remained still, yet he stood rooted to the spot. One hand remained behind his back, while the other extended, a sword of lightning condensing. He swung it to the side, blocking the attack with a clang, lightning radiating everywhere! The terrifying sword edge was incredibly sharp, filled with surging killing intent.

Zhou Tian's other hand condensed golden flames, dazzling to the eye. His entire arm erupted with blinding golden light, blood energy pervading. With a boom, a fist-print descended like the sky, suppressing all.

Boom! It slammed heavily into the chest of the sword-wielding Heavenly King! The sword-wielding Heavenly King's face turned pale, and he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, clearly not lightly wounded. However, he did not retreat. Instead, his body grew even more brilliant, transforming and becoming increasingly ethereal. He himself had actually turned into a sword, merging with the ethereal Heavenly Sword's phantom.

With a hum, the void seemed to be sliced open in that instant. The sword-wielding Heavenly King, transformed into a very thin greatsword, slashed over in a flash, boundless in its terror, wrapped in divine chains of order. This strike poured out his boundless energy. This was a secret art, costly but possessing immense destructive power! One could see the void shattering and twisting, sword qi filling the sky, blazing sword lights everywhere, as if the entire world would be pierced through. Among these seven Heavenly Kings, the sword-wielding Heavenly King was already considered quite strong. He controlled endless sword qi, slashing forward.

Unfortunately, he met Zhou Tian, a cheat!

"Come on, come on!"

Boom! Zhou Tian's body glowed as if he wielded boundless divine fire. His entire being was resplendent, surging with terrifying, pale golden blood energy. Around him, lightning flashed and thunder roared, light boundless. He was like a primeval god or demon emerging from the age of creation! At this moment, Zhou Tian did not move. He merely raised a pair of dazzling golden fists and slammed them fiercely into the void. Golden ripples transformed into symbols, crashing like raging waves, surging outwards.

In an instant, a roar echoed through the void. Various sword lights continuously shattered, the sword qi disintegrated with hissing sounds, and the Sword Dao's order violently exploded. The power of a single punch caused energy to surge violently, capable of shattering endless sword lights and intimidating all who witnessed it. Zhou Tian's hair shone brilliantly, swaying wildly without wind. Light surged around his body, and various exotic energies continuously appeared and vanished, cycling endlessly. The sword-embryo formed by the sword-wielding Heavenly King trembled with a hum, then flew backward, seemingly on the verge of breaking with a loud clang.

But after all, he was not alone. Boom! A massive purple-golden hammer descended from the sky, accompanied by lightning and interwoven with bolts of electricity, blocking the spread of the golden ripples. At the same time, a Heavenly Blade, transformed into the size of a mountain, slashed down solidly, shattering the void! This was merely one killing move; black holes emerged in the void, absorbing all light. There was even a crimson-golden fiery furnace, inscribed with profound symbols, spewing blazing flames. And several more Heavenly Kings attacked, their bodies glowing.

"Come on, hit me with all you've got!"

Zhou Tian laughed loudly, his hair disheveled. Faced with so many killing moves, he neither dodged nor retreated. The energy and light around his body surged dramatically. With a boom, his entire demeanor transformed completely. Golden blood energy steamed, and all the exotic energies were devoured into his body. At this moment, he was like a fiery furnace, resplendent all over, golden light surging, blood energy rolling, wrapped in golden lightning. All sorts of light burst forth from his body, forming an overbearing and awe-inspiring aura.
