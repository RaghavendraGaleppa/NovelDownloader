# Chapter 39: Xiao Ji's Unique Origins

On a winter night, three people gathered around a hot pot.  

Xiao Ji stuffed slices of meat into his mouth while pondering the story of Master Wan.  

Such a selfless powerhouse, who had gathered the Nine Treasures to suppress a cataclysmic disaster, now found himself devoid of all his cultivation.  

No one knew what he had done for this world, nor would anyone remember his kindness. Perhaps all of this was because he had grown up relying on the generosity of many.  

The Supreme Sword Immortal loved this world unconditionally, never calculating personal gains or losses—because many had helped and saved him in the past. Just as his master had once rescued and raised him, if anyone dared to harm his master, he would naturally draw his sword in defiance.  

The reasoning was the same, though Master Wan's deeds were far grander.  

Thinking of Master Wan inevitably brought to mind the Four-Stringed Pipa. Three of its strings had already been obtained, and the whereabouts of the last one were now known.  

**[The middle string is located in a dilapidated temple on a desolate mountain near Luolin Town in Longxiang Prefecture, currently in the possession of a headless old monk at the early Foundation Establishment stage.]**  

The last string would not be easy to retrieve. First, Xiao Ji had to reach the Foundation Establishment stage—a hard requirement that had to be met.  

Then, he would need to ask Song Yuanbao for an official map. The desolate mountains around Luolin Town were notoriously numerous—so much so that the town was named after them. Legend had it that each mountain was once formed from a dragon's scale.  

The official records would show which mountains had once housed temples. Investigating beforehand would narrow down the search.  

Xiao Ji had also considered searching for the remaining fragments of the Four-Stringed Pipa, but the clues were vague and unclear. Some fragments already seemed to have owners.  

In other words, within the lands of Longxiang Prefecture, Xiao Ji was not the only one gathering the pipa fragments. Other powerful figures were also searching for them. Their exact strengths and characteristics remained unknown, but Xiao Ji believed they would eventually cross paths—after all, everyone coveted what the others held.  

Anyone capable of searching for these fragments in Longxiang Prefecture would surely be well-versed in the historical context of the pipa's past conflicts. They might have even deduced the fragments' locations through divination.  

Now that the secrets of fate were leaking, treasure-seeking factions would gradually emerge. Those who obtained the treasures would inevitably grow stronger—this was the natural order of things. The weak would gain treasures, only to have them seized by the strong, who would in turn be robbed by the stronger.  

The path to gathering the Nine Treasures was truly arduous.  

"Trying to snag a piece of meat is really difficult," Liu Haizhu muttered, chopsticks poised over the pot as he eyed the few cabbage leaves swirling in the broth.  

Xiao Ji snapped out of his thoughts. His focus had been entirely on treasure hunting, and his chopsticks had instinctively gone for the meat. Now, only vegetables remained in the pot.  

"I'll go cut some more meat."  

Xiao Ji set down his chopsticks and went to the chopping board, where he sliced a fresh plate of meat. Noticing the fire beneath the copper pot had weakened, he headed to the woodshed to chop more kindling.  

As he opened the door to return, a gust of cold wind blew in, carrying scattered snowflakes.  

It was snowing again.  

"This winter is strange—it's snowed far more often than usual," Ying Xiao murmured around the chopsticks in her mouth, glancing at the door.  

"Indeed," Xiao Ji agreed, adding a few more logs beneath the pot. "Counting the days, the New Year is just over a month away. It's a time for family reunions—many wanderers will be returning home. But with this snow, the roads will be difficult. I imagine many won't make it back in time for the New Year's feast."  

He was testing the waters, seeing if the Third Princess had any thoughts of returning home—or if she had simply forgotten.  

A high-ranking princess of a great nation, missing for so long—the imperial city must be frantic. But such matters couldn't be publicly announced, as that would cause chaos. They could only search for her in secret.  

Xiao Ji had briefly considered reporting the princess's whereabouts, but he quickly dismissed the idea.  

His purpose in sheltering her was, of course, to secure future benefits for the Yuanshen Temple and gain influence in the imperial court. If he made the princess unhappy, she might become an enemy.  

There was no point in inviting trouble. All he had to do was wait—when this golden branch and jade leaf decided to return home, he could simply escort her to the imperial palace in Dragon City.  

But instead of showing any homesickness, Ying Xiao seemed to be planning to leave the temple altogether, misinterpreting Xiao Ji's words.  

**[Ying Xiao believes you want her to leave Yuanshen Temple before the New Year and plans to slip away quietly to investigate the southern regions.]**  

How sensitive... Xiao Ji decided to correct her misconception. "Yuanshen Temple is also your home. In previous years, it was just my master and me celebrating, but this year, the three of us will make it livelier. We'll make dumplings together."  

"Mmm, dumplings sound good," Liu Haizhu mused, unusually not delving into tales from millennia past. Instead, he reminisced about the day he first found Xiao Ji.  

Xiao Ji had been picked up by Liu Haizhu outside Willow Town.  

"That spring, when the ice and snow had just melted, I went for a stroll outside the city after eating dumplings. On a small path by the fields, I heard a cry like a pig being slaughtered..."  

Was that really how you described a child?  

Xiao Ji had always doubted his origins. The information he could perceive now only dated back to his transmigration—everything before that was a blank.  

He insisted his master's memory was flawed and proposed an alternative: "Master, do you think it's possible that when you found me, my parents were actually nearby? That I wasn't abandoned?"  

Liu Haizhu frowned. "No, you were definitely picked up by me. Right next to a fresh cow patty... You were starving, wailing your lungs out. Luckily, you couldn't crawl yet, or you'd have..."  

Xiao Ji didn't enjoy the rest of the hot pot meal.  

After dinner, the three retired to their rooms, lighting stoves before settling in for the night.  

Lying in bed, Xiao Ji kept an ear out in case Ying Xiao decided to sneak away.  

...  

In the Third Princess's room, Her Highness was writing in her diary by candlelight.  

**[Day 136 of running away from home: I have successfully mastered the art of sweeping and have come to understand certain truths. As Brother Xiao Ji once said, 'If you cannot sweep one room, how can you sweep the world?'...]**  

**[Had hot pot for dinner. It snowed again. Though my plans to overthrow Father's corrupt dynasty are not yet ready, the hot pot was truly delicious.]**  

"The content is all over the place!" Xiao Ji couldn't help but comment.  

**[I also heard a sad story. Brother Xiao Ji is so pitiful—born beside cow dung, growing up with it...]**  

Why would you even write that down? Xiao Ji shifted his attention away from Ying Xiao's room and lay back, checking the temple's security—whether the doors were locked, if any mice were stealing oil, or if thieves were lurking.  

He paid special attention to their neighbors, the Swift Wind Escort Agency. Recently, their men had been climbing over Yuanshen Temple's walls to sneak out to the Pleasure House.  

They'd even knocked loose a couple of bricks.  

The reason was simple: the escort agency was strict, so these young men used Yuanshen Temple's walls as their shortcut.  

But Yuanshen Temple was not a public road—they couldn't just keep trespassing.  

Xiao Ji had already confronted the agency's chief, who expressed shock and promised to tighten discipline and improve overall conduct.  

Not a word was said about compensation.  

These trivial matters fell solely on Xiao Ji's shoulders. His master still held the title of Yuanshen Temple's abbot, but he no longer concerned himself with anything else.
