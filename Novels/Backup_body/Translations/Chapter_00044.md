# Chapter 44: The Monk Raises His Demon-Subduing Staff in Tears, Mournfully Performing Last Rites for Li Zhengjing!

"Monitoring the movements around Xuanling Prefecture was originally the responsibility of our Beast Taming Hall."

"Disciples from our hall have been dispatched in all other directions, using birds and beasts to observe the area."

"Why must an inner sect disciple be sent specifically to the southwest direction?"

He Qingyu frowned. "This task only requires sending birds or beasts to avoid personal danger. Yet now he's being sent alone—Elder Chen Xuan of the Ancient Moon Peak must be trying to harm him!"

The Beast Taming Hall elder remained calm. "The presiding elder of Ancient Moon Peak has issued orders to his inner sect disciples. Neither of us has the authority to interfere!"

"Moreover, even if Elder Chen Xuan is abusing his power for personal gain this time, it's up to Ancient Moon Peak's own Law Enforcement Hall to handle it!"

With that, the elder flicked his sleeve and left. "Don't forget, you yourself are still under suspicion of wrongdoing!"

He Qingyu's expression was complex. After sitting silently for a while, she took out a wooden box from her bundle and tapped it.

A majestic black eagle emerged from the box.

"Go to the southwest of Xuanling Prefecture," He Qingyu whispered. "If Li Zhengjing encounters danger, do your best to help him escape!"

The black eagle immediately took flight, soaring into the clouds.

Meanwhile, Chen Yang arrived at Elder Chen Xuan's tent with a pleased expression.

"Uncle, it's time to depart."

Chen Yang bowed. "By noon today, we'll enter Xuanling Prefecture. According to the plan, disciples from each peak will work in teams of six, dispersing across the cities to search for traces of Xin Xuan. With so many eyes spread out, the Venom King Xin Xuan will have nowhere to hide..."

"Understood." Chen Xuan responded, then paused before asking, "What about Li Zhengjing?"

"He's already set off for the southwest as ordered," Chen Yang said in a low voice. "I've sent word to Third Uncle, instructing him to follow the Great Zhou imperial army to the southwest. Once there, with a little provocation, we can accuse Li Zhengjing of 'obstructing military operations and suspected of harboring the Venom King Xin Xuan' and have him trampled to death on the spot!"

"Good!"

Elder Chen Xuan stepped out of the tent and gazed southwest, his expression shifting slightly.

After a moment, he sighed and turned his head. "Although the Grand Elder never gave explicit orders, we both know that because of Yuan Zhengfeng, he despises that young man intensely."

"Now that Yuan Zhengfeng's remains have returned to the mountain, the Grand Elder has been brooding over their past conflicts, his mood increasingly foul."

"Delivering news of the boy's death should lift his spirits somewhat."

He patted Chen Yang's shoulder. "The Grand Elder's cultivation grows deeper by the day, and he no longer relies on the Chen clan. The higher he ascends, the more distant his ties to family will become."

"So we must do everything we can to ease his troubles. Through this matter, we'll remind him that the Chen clan remains useful, still capable of serving as his claws and fangs."

"Otherwise, once he ascends to immortality and gazes down upon the mortal world, the Chen clan will be no different from any other family in his eyes."

His brow furrowed with worry as he sighed deeply. "That day may not be far off..."

The wall-climbing bird soared high above the clouds, while Li Zhengjing walked along the road below.

A tender branch of the Five Elements Creation Tree extended from his bundle, waving as it spoke.

"Master, this path is dangerous. Let's flee!"

"Even you can see that. Do you think I don't know?"

"Well, true..." The branch waved again. "After all, I don't even have a brain. Master's mind is much sharper."

"..."

Li Zhengjing suspected the tree was implying his intelligence was only slightly better than a brainless creature, but he had no proof. Since he couldn't beat it now, he filed the insult away for future retribution.

His thoughts churned. When Chen Yang had confronted him earlier, he'd considered the consequences of disobeying Elder Chen Xuan's orders.

According to the golden page, his fortune read: *Defying Elder Chen Xuan's orders will result in him executing you personally for "violating sect law, disrupting order, and sowing chaos."*

"With the tyrannical inner energy cultivated through the Tiger and Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, the Great Derivation Void-Shattering Sword Qi, and the Blazing Sun Divine Sword in my left arm... plus my newly improved movement skills..."

"In a direct fight, I might not be weaker than Chen Xuan!"

"But if I act, it would mean defying sect law and challenging authority—tantamount to rebellion!"

"At that point, I wouldn't just face Chen Xuan, but all the elders and inner sect disciples of Ancient Moon Peak joining forces to kill me!"

"Rank crushes everything—even in an immortal sect!"

Li Zhengjing mused, *Now that I've agreed to go, what happens next?*

He glanced at the golden page and frowned.

**Fortune:** *Proceeding southwest to Xuanling Prefecture to survey the area, you encounter the Great Zhou imperial army. Upon identifying yourself, you are executed on the spot!*

"Executed on the spot for stating my identity? How dare the Great Zhou army kill a disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect so easily?"

After a moment's thought, his brow smoothed. "The Chen family's influence runs deep—they must have people in the Great Zhou court."

He took a low-grade spirit stone from his pocket and swallowed it.

The method to alter his fate didn't appear—insufficient spiritual energy!

He swallowed another low-grade stone.

This time, the method required *six* low-grade spirit stones in succession!

"What kind of fate alteration is this, needing so much energy?"

After swallowing a seventh stone, the method finally appeared:

**Method to Alter Fate:** *Travel thirty li southwest toward Xuanling Prefecture, then turn east to avoid being surrounded and killed by over a hundred imperial soldiers.*

"Walk thirty li, then head east—meaning I won't reach Chen Xuan's designated location."

"But afterward, they can still charge me with desertion and fleeing my post."

As he pondered, more text flickered faintly below the method.

Understanding the golden page's stingy nature, he swallowed another spirit stone.

The second half of the method became clear:

**Method to Alter Fate:** *Kill the Venom King Xin Xuan and shake the world with your fame!*

**Further details... insufficient spiritual energy!**

"More stones?"

Li Zhengjing cursed inwardly but didn't rush to use his remaining stones. He only had two mid-grade stones and twelve low-grade ones left—far too few to waste.

His eyes gleamed with calculation.

"So if I kill Xin Xuan and cut off the source of this turmoil, my great merit will absolve me of any charges."

"But Xin Xuan is called the Venom King for a reason—his strength rivals a True Qi realm expert, and with his poison arts, he fought his way out of the capital. How am I supposed to kill him?"

"Also, the method only mentions killing, not capturing."

Li Zhengjing mused, *Does this mean the method will give me the means to kill someone like Xin Xuan?*

Without delay, he followed the instructions, walking thirty li southwest before turning east.

Less than ten li eastward, the wall-climbing bird let out a piercing cry overhead.

Li Zhengjing's expression changed as his hand went to his sword hilt.

Then, from behind him came a trembling voice:

"Second Brother?"

"..."

Li Zhengjing stiffened and slowly turned.

A tearful monk stood there, raising a demon-subduing staff high before bringing it crashing down toward his head.

"Second Brother! Let me send you off to the afterlife!"
