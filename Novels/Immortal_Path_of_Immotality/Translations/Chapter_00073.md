# Chapter 73: Selling Off Assets

Princess Guo's fair forehead glistened with sweat. She never imagined Lin Shan would dare choose a residence within the city walls. 

The spiritual energy concentration in the mountains outside the city was five times that of the mundane world, costing only 2 spirit stones per month. Inside the city, while fifteen times richer in spiritual energy, the price of 10 spirit stones per month was far from affordable for common cultivators.

For rogue cultivators, earning spirit stones was difficult. Most would rather spend more time cultivating slowly in Yichuan than splurge on city accommodations. Typically, the 10-spirit-stone city residences were reserved for passing disciples of major sects or young masters and misses from prominent cultivation families—the privileged "immortal second generation." The central district's 30-spirit-stone residences were basically for Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Rogue cultivators like Lin Shan and Princess Guo would naturally choose the suburban areas outside the city. Poor and young, time was the one thing they had in abundance.

Princess Guo wished she could vanish into the ground. She'd already spent most of her spirit stones elsewhere and couldn't possibly cover Lin Shan's rent. She secretly cursed him for taking advantage of her offer, certain he'd chosen the city residence upon hearing she was paying. She longed to give him a thorough beating.

But outwardly, she could only feign helplessness, putting on a pitiful expression. "Brother Lin... I didn't bring so many spirit stones with me... Perhaps we could choose outside the city?"

The attendant, Elder Yan, immediately turned to Lin Shan with a look that said, "Your girl's broke, so you'd better pay up, young man. I've already registered everything!"

Lin Shan was utterly speechless as he looked at the flustered princess. 

If you can't afford it, why pretend to be generous? Getting my hopes up for nothing!

Seeing no point in pressing her, he took out his last thirty spirit stones and handed them to Elder Yan. After collecting his residence token, he left the administrative hall without another word to find his new dwelling.

Elder Yan stared blankly at Princess Guo's stormy expression, wondering if this was a case of a rogue cultivator girl chasing after privileged young masters. Had he misjudged their relationship?

"These youngsters nowadays," he mused, "so bold in reaching above their station. Who knows? Maybe this pheasant will become a phoenix yet!" 

Encouragingly, he patted Princess Guo's shoulder. "Miss, you've got good foundations. With your looks and persistence, you'll surely win that young master's favor eventually! So... still renting?"

Princess Guo snorted coldly and stormed off.

"Immortal second generation?" she fumed inwardly. "So you got quite the haul from those three dead men, didn't you, boy? Consider those spirit stones temporarily in your keeping. In three months, everything will belong to this princess!"

Elder Yan, completely ignored, shook his head and turned to other customers.

After several turns through the eastern district, Lin Shan found his assigned courtyard. 

The residence was protected by restrictive formations—impossible to enter without the proper token or by force. Not that anyone would dare break in violently, given the formidable backing of the market's administrative office.

Pressing his token into the gate's indentation, Lin Shan watched the restrictions deactivate before pushing the door open. 

Beyond lay a stone-paved path leading past a small medicinal herb garden—clearly provided for cultivators with alchemical interests. The interior contained a cultivation chamber, kitchen, bedroom, reception room, and even a beast-rearing enclosure.

Lin Shan nodded in satisfaction. The ten spirit stones were well spent, especially given the rich spiritual energy. While he had no immediate use for most facilities, he could appreciate their value.

His priority now was achieving his short-term goals during these three months.

After tidying up briefly, Lin Shan settled into his new residence and began cultivating in earnest.

These three months passed joyfully for Lin Shan, filled with unlimited spiritual energy and regular deliveries of exquisite meals—perks of the privileged cultivator district. 

Meanwhile, outside the city walls, Princess Guo and her three companions grew increasingly restless. 

They met frequently, their thoughts consumed by Lin Shan—or more accurately, by the premium mid-grade magical artifact worth 500 spirit stones and the "non-existent" fortune in his possession.

"That boy got all three storage pouches," Princess Guo calculated during one gathering. "Immortal Huang had over a hundred spirit stones, and those two in green robes probably had another hundred between them. That's two hundred stones right there!"

The others couldn't hide their envy. "The brat's been holed up in there, forcing us to rent outside just to keep watch. Who knows how recklessly he's spending it all!"

Their agitation grew disproportionate to the situation.

The brocade-robed middle-aged man focused on another matter. "That Lake Dongting venture must have yielded more than just a Vermilion Fruit. His sudden leap to the sixth layer of Qi Refining and acquisition of a mid-grade artifact suggests extraordinary gains."

Princess Guo bit her lip. "With your family's ancestral talisman sword, Brother Wang, we'll subdue him the moment he leaves Yichuan. Nothing to fear."

But the man shook his head gravely. "Don't underestimate him. While my talisman sword is mid-grade, it only bears speed and spell-breaking inscriptions—lacking the durability or sharpness to clash directly with his artifact. Moreover, our ancestral weapon is nearly depleted."

Princess Guo's expression turned icy. "Then we must take him down all the more!"

Just then, another spoke up: "My informant reports he's left his residence."

They all stood. After three months, their prey was finally on the move.

Indeed, Lin Shan had emerged—having reached the bottleneck of mid-stage Qi Refining and largely mastered the mid-grade Whirlwind Technique during his seclusion. However, he had no intention of leaving Yichuan yet.

His agreement with the Nightingale's Elder had been for six months; only half that time had passed. 

Waiting another three months would allow Nightingale tokens from across the Great Song to be gathered. He could then deliver the Vermilion Fruit to the Elder, fulfilling his promise while collecting ancient essence—saving himself an extra trip.

Besides, Yichuan's spiritual energy made the outside world seem like barren countryside by comparison. Staying here offered the best chance for advancing to late-stage Qi Refining.

Currently, Lin Shan's simplest solution was enhancing wind-attribute spirit fruits or early-stage Qi Refining breakthrough pills—the easiest path to advancement.

Now he somewhat regretted purchasing those technique scrolls prematurely. Had he saved up, he might have scraped together the 100 spirit stones needed for breakthrough pills. 

Originally, with only 3 points of ancient essence, enhancing such items was impossible—hence his focus on improving combat skills while awaiting the Nightingale harvest. But the unexpected acquisition of the Seven Arrows Book's straw doll had provided a windfall of ancient essence, convincing him to reach late-stage Qi Refining before returning to Bianliang.

Currently spirit-stone-broke, Lin Shan did possess assets he could liquidate:

From the hook-nosed man—a low-grade refined iron sword and smithing notes.
From the green-robed elder—an insect-rearing pagoda and beast-taming manual.
His own possessions—a damaged high-grade Soulwood Fish artifact and Purple Spirit Fruit pits.

Selling these should easily net over a hundred spirit stones.

Eager to begin, Lin Shan headed for the commercial district to explore his options.
