## Chapter 79: The Herb-Sensitive Beast

Lin Xuan stood before a small hill, with a long-dead corpse lying beside him. The clothes on the body indicated that the person was a disciple of the Fire Spirit Gate, but the wounds on the body were peculiar, not like they were caused by a spell or incantation. The chest was mangled, as if it had been torn apart by sharp claws or teeth.

Lin Xuan was silent for a while, his mind flashing to the word "demon beast." The Xi Yue Ravine was notorious for being a treacherous place, filled with various precious herbs and grasses, but also a habitat for demon beasts.

The Fire Spirit Gate disciple's hand still clutched a talisman, his face frozen in terror. Several crimson fruits were scattered around the body. Lin Xuan recognized them as Red Dew Fruits, a crucial ingredient in refining the Marrow-Cleansing Pill. It seemed that this person had come to the Xi Yue Ravine to gather herbs but had fallen prey to a demon beast.

Although the person was from a rival sect, the gruesome death still made Lin Xuan feel uneasy, giving him a more intuitive sense of the dangers within the Xi Yue Ravine.

Lin Xuan bent down and took the storage ring from the corpse. Although the person's cultivation level was not high, he could still obtain some crystals and materials.

Then, Lin Xuan took out a beast pouch from his sleeve and tossed it into the air. A small, rabbit-like creature emerged from the pouch. However, this creature had three eyes, making it different from a regular rabbit. It was a low-grade, first-tier demon beast known as the Herb-Sensitive Beast.

As its name suggested, the Herb-Sensitive Beast had no combat prowess but was extremely sensitive to rare flowers, herbs, and precious medicinal materials. Many cultivation sects kept them to aid in their search for valuable resources. Before coming to the Xi Yue Ravine, Lin Xuan had purchased one at a high price.

Lin Xuan flicked his right hand, and a white light enveloped the Herb-Sensitive Beast. He then pricked his finger, allowing a drop of blood to fall onto the beast's forehead, completing the master-beast recognition ritual.

After the ritual, Lin Xuan gently put the Herb-Sensitive Beast down, patted its head, and the small creature scurried off in a southeast direction.

Lin Xuan smiled, feeling more confident with the Herb-Sensitive Beast leading the way. Without it, he would be like a headless fly, wandering aimlessly and risking stumbling into a demon beast's lair.

Meanwhile, a massacre had begun in the Xi Yue Ravine.

In various parts of the ravine, Fire Spirit Gate disciples were slaughtering other cultivators. The battle was almost one-sided, as the Fire Spirit Gate had sent their elite disciples, well-equipped and well-trained. The other cultivators, including neutral rogue cultivators, disciples from other sects, and those affiliated with certain cultivation families, were caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties.

The Fire Spirit Gate's disciples, ranging from the Spirit Stage to the Foundation Establishment Stage, were conducting a thorough sweep of the Xi Yue Ravine. Within a few hours, they had killed over a hundred cultivators, while their own losses were minimal.

Lin Xuan, unaware of the carnage, was using his Wind Riding Technique to move swiftly, following the Herb-Sensitive Beast. The beast's excitement indicated that there were precious herbs nearby, although Lin Xuan was unsure if they were the ones he needed.

Suddenly, Lin Xuan stopped, his eyes narrowing. He recalled the Herb-Sensitive Beast into its pouch and concealed his presence, cautiously moving forward.

The sound of flowing water reached his ears, and he saw three cultivators, dressed in the attire of the Heavenly Star Sect, standing beside a small stream. At their feet lay a massive, dead demon beast, its body resembling a rat but larger than a wild boar, with four ears and three eyes. The beast's head was in a pool of blood, lifeless.

The three cultivators were discussing their recent battle, praising their companion, Brother Xie, for his skillful use of magic.

Lin Xuan held his breath, observing the scene. The Heavenly Star Sect had a long-standing friendship with the Fire Spirit Gate and was also a rival of the Drifting Cloud Valley.

Just as the three cultivators were about to leave, a beam of light appeared in the distance. Brother Xie immediately ordered his companions to prepare to leave, fearing that the newcomer might have malicious intentions.

However, the beam of light arrived sooner than expected, revealing a Fire Spirit Gate disciple.

Lin Xuan watched as the Fire Spirit Gate disciple, Zheng, greeted the Heavenly Star Sect cultivators. Initially, they seemed to be on friendly terms, but Zheng's expression suddenly turned cold, and he spat out a red beam that pierced Brother Xie's throat. The other two cultivators were shocked, and Brother Xie fell to the ground, his eyes filled with anger and fear.

Lin Xuan witnessed the sudden turn of events, his eyes fixed on the scene unfolding before him.
