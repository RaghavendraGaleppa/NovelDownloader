# Chapter 67: Shang Wu: "Hmph, You Unfilial Disciple..." and the Troubled Xiao Qin

"Master, actually, you're still late. I've been back for a few days."

"You... you ate it?!"

Shang Wu was momentarily stunned, watching her precious disciple nod with a melancholic expression, then sigh faintly as he clasped his hands behind his back, looking up at the sky.

The Autumn Water Pavilion fell silent.

They looked at each other, speechless.

The wind today, suddenly seemed a bit boisterous.

Seeing his beautiful Master cover her mouth, her almond-shaped eyes intensely fluctuating, Little Li's feeling wasn't exactly pleasant.

He just felt her gaze was rather rude.

He remembered when he was a child, competing with other kids, he blurted out, "My brother dares to eat poop," and the kid opposite him had a similar look in his eyes.

"Master, actually, if the dishes Ying Bing cooked weren't unpalatable, then they could still be considered..."

"I understand, you don't need to say more. You're back, and you're alive and well, that's a double blessing. Let's have a drink, master and disciple, it's all in the wine."

Shang Wu pulled out the stopper of a small gourd, taking two celebratory sips.

Then she casually handed the small gourd to Li Mo, giving his shoulder a heavy pat:

"Well done."

"......"

So how did things escalate to us drinking together?

With the crisis averted, Shang Wu happily lay back on her rocking chair, her almond eyes narrowing.

The sun was strong today. The moment she lay down, the sunlight painted a picture.

As the poem goes: "Viewed horizontally, it's a range; viewed vertically, it's a peak..."

Seeing Li Mo about to leave, she turned her head, asking sleepily:

"Oh, right, my precious disciple, what are we eating tonight?"

Meaning: Since you're going out anyway, I might as well order some dishes.

Li Mo couldn't help but grin:

"Leftovers. As you know, the Nine Peaks Martial Competition is approaching, and I'm quite busy with my training."

"Hmm?"

"Actually, I didn't finish that day. There was still some Nine-Turn Braised Intestine and Stir-fried Pork with Chili left..."

"!"

Seeing his Master completely lose her sleepiness, Li Mo suppressed his laughter and slipped away, making a quick exit.

As his footsteps faded, Shang Wu glanced at the water vat, noting the empty spot where the vegetable basket usually sat, then softly spat:

"Hmph, you unfilial disciple..."

Meanwhile.

At the Foreign Affairs Hall.

"Verification complete."

"Inner disciple Xiao Qin, for successfully apprehending and killing a Blood Qi Realm Grand Completion villain, awarded one thousand contribution points!"

The deacon of the Foreign Affairs Hall, after carefully verifying the token, smiled and nodded at the young man opposite him.

To be able to kill a Blood Qi Realm Grand Completion villain in actual combat so soon after entering the inner sect indicated that the disciple before him was a promising talent.

Many disciples who came to hand in missions also cast curious glances his way.

Bounty hunt missions offered generous rewards but also carried a high failure rate and significant danger. Therefore, not many disciples took on such missions. A considerable portion of those who did, did so to temper themselves.

"One thousand contribution points..."

"Excuse me, Deacon, how many contribution points would rare treasures beneficial to the Intent Soul require?"

However, Xiao Qin's face didn't show much joy.

"Intent Soul treasures?"

The inner sect deacon was startled for a moment, then shook his head:

"I can tell you without even looking, there's nothing below thirty thousand contribution points."

"Those are items only used by cultivators in the Spirit Contemplation Realm. It's too early for you to be looking into them. Don't aim too high."

"I suggest you first exchange for some healing items, lest you leave behind hidden injuries."

This inner sect deacon had a good impression of him, so he offered a few extra words of advice.

"Thank you!"

Xiao Qin clasped his hands in thanks, then couldn't help but sigh.

Indeed, it was just as he thought.

When he had gone down the mountain for missions, he had also inquired about similar items, but either they weren't available, or their prices were completely beyond his imagination. Exchanging with contribution points within the sect was indeed more cost-effective, but it was still beyond what he could afford...

"Child, don't worry. This old man is just a bit weak, not to the point of dissipating."

Grandmaster Thousand Forms' voice rang out, but it was much weaker than before.

"It's all my fault, for being careless for a moment."

Xiao Qin's face showed guilt.

When apprehending that villain, he hadn't fully investigated the opponent's information, unaware that the villain had accomplices, and consequently found himself surrounded. This caused his Master to expend a significant amount of his Intent Soul out of thin air to save him.

"Everyone has their youth. For your first life-or-death battle to go like this, it's already quite commendable."

"You've already reached Blood Qi Grand Completion, but alas, I am no longer strong enough to refine the Tiger Sinew Qi Condensation Pill for you."

Although Grandmaster Thousand Forms was weak, his tone carried a hint of satisfaction.

The Nine Peaks Martial Competition was approaching. Xiao Qin had originally wanted to break through to the Inner Breath Realm before this, to secure a good ranking. But he hadn't expected such an unforeseen event to occur...

"Senior Brother Xiao? You're here too."

He had just walked out the door. Suddenly someone called him, and Xiao Qin instinctively turned his head.

It was Li Mo, who had arrived at some unknown time, smiling at him.

"Junior Brother Li, are you also here to hand in a mission?"

"Yes, I also took a bounty hunt mission."

Li Mo nodded, also noticing that Xiao Qin had recently been in a battle, and some of his injuries hadn't fully healed.

"Truly, a person changes so much after three days apart that one must look at them with new eyes."

Xiao Qin couldn't help but feel a little emotional. Looking at Junior Brother Li, it was clear he had completed the mission with ease. One must know, bounty hunt missions were serious; the targets pursued were at least at Blood Qi Grand Completion. Those below that level were handled by local authorities and wouldn't be reported to the Qingyuan Sect. Recalling their first meeting, Junior Brother Li had just opened his meridians; now he could effortlessly kill someone at Blood Qi Grand Completion.

"I was lucky. That villain was injured, so he could only use about sixty or seventy percent of his full strength."

"I see."

Hearing Li Mo say this, Xiao Qin relaxed slightly.

"Oh, right, Senior Brother Xiao, I was looking for you yesterday."

"Junior Brother Li, what is it? Just speak freely. As long as it's something I can do..."

"By chance, I acquired an item and don't know its specific effects. Senior Brother Xiao, you're famously knowledgeable, so I wanted to ask you to identify it for me."

Li Mo said, reaching into his sleeve. He pulled out a block of material that was neither quite wood nor quite stone, and handed it to Xiao Qin.

"This, I'm afraid..."

Xiao Qin showed a bitter smile. Usually, when he encountered something he didn't recognize, he would ask his Master. But his Master had just said a few words to him and then fallen into a deep slumber...

"It's Deep Yin Spirit Nurturing Wood!"

The old voice suddenly rang out in his mind, sounding somewhat excited.

Wasn't Master in hibernation? Why did he suddenly sound so awake?

But immediately after, he heard Grandmaster Thousand Forms' voice quicken:

"This is a rare treasure for nourishing the Intent Soul. It requires a rare spiritual wood to be struck by lightning, then coincidentally sink into a water vein, where it is nourished for many years, turning from wood to stone, and then from stone to jade, before it is finally formed."

"Many powerful cultivators, hopeless of breaking through their current realm, would use this wood to make coffins, seal their physical bodies, nourish their Intent Souls, and only emerge in the next era."

"This piece of Deep Yin Spirit Nurturing Wood has already reached the wood-to-stone stage."

Xiao Qin understood. His Master meant that this item was extremely precious and of great use to him.

He wanted it.

But this was Junior Brother Li's item...

Xiao Qin took a deep breath, and said solemnly:

"Junior Brother, this is Deep Yin Spirit Nurturing Wood. It's an item for nourishing the Intent Soul, and it's extremely precious."

"You should keep it safe. It will be of great use when you reach the Spirit Contemplation Realm in the future."

*Sigh.*

*Old Xiao, if you had just said this thing wasn't worth much, I would've just casually tossed it to you, wouldn't I?*

*But then again, that wouldn't be him anymore...*

Li Mo could only ask again:

"Since it's an item for the Spirit Contemplation Realm, used to nourish the Intent Soul, why do I see Senior Brother Xiao looking somewhat moved?"

"To tell you the truth, I really do need something similar."

Xiao Qin scratched his head awkwardly. His Master was probably cursing him as an unfilial disciple in his mind right now.

Li Mo pondered for a moment:

"Then, how about I lend it to you for now?"
