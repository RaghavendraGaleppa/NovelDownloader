Chapter 151: Madam’s Declaration: You Are Mine!

The Leopard Blade Sect.

The place was deserted. Once a powerful sect, it now lay in ruins, evoking sighs of regret. Li Xian leaped into the courtyard, removed his mask, and headed toward the inner grounds.

The buildings along the way were orderly. There were sparring platforms, a vegetarian dining hall, a mission hall...

Li Xian thought to himself, "If there are treasures, they are likely in the inner courtyard." Thus, he did not bother searching the outer areas one by one.

Not long after, he came across a small green garden filled with plants and trees, surrounded by more than a dozen disciples' dormitories.

This was where the Leopard Blade Sect disciples usually rested and relaxed. Clothes were still hanging in front of the houses, left behind in the haste of their departure.

Li Xian pondered, "It would be such a waste to leave these fabrics. Tomorrow, I will have the runners come and collect them all. After washing, I will distribute them freely to the poor."

He recalled the past.

His greatest dream, along with his younger brother, had been to own a decent set of clothes. In the Poor Bottle Alley, a single garment could be passed down through generations.

He continued deeper inside. This time, Li Xian walked with his head held high, free to explore. He looked around, taking in the sights he had previously overlooked.

That little old man, Xu Lifeng, certainly knew how to enjoy life.

Every day, his personal disciples served him his meals and attended to his needs. Aside from daily martial arts practice, which he had to do himself, everything else—eating, drinking, sleeping, and relieving himself—was handled by his disciples.

Li Xian entered the bedroom.

He rummaged through the room and first found many exquisite jade artifacts and fine silk robes. Li Xian silently noted them; selling them later would yield at least a hundred taels of silver.

He searched meticulously, hoping to find martial arts manuals or copies of divine techniques. However, he was disappointed. He only found a few basic martial arts manuals—unpalatable to consume but too valuable to discard.

"Hm?"

While searching the bookshelf, Li Xian saw the "Blood Luo Art." He flipped through it roughly; it was a mid-grade martial art, quite extraordinary. However, it was too sinister. Cultivating it to the later stages would completely destroy one's physical form.

Li Xian discarded it immediately, not bothering to look at it a second time.

"Is this a treasure?!"

Li Xian activated his Twin Pupils and saw a hidden compartment under the bed. It contained a mechanism that would shoot poison needles to kill the thief if forced open.

With such strict defenses, the treasure inside must be formidable. Li Xian secretly rejoiced. If not for his Twin Pupils, he would have either missed this item or been killed by the mechanism.

His method was simple. He poured lamp oil on the bed and set it on fire. The mechanism inside was destroyed in the flames.

A black wooden box remained intact.

He opened the box, and inside was a "Flesh Jade." It felt like flesh but looked like jade. Li Xian took it, his heart swelling with joy. The "Azure Water Pearl" already had infinite uses; if Xu Lifeng had possessed this item, the outcome of their battle yesterday would have been uncertain.

Having an extra treasure on his body increased his confidence in wandering the Jianghu and building his fortune.

"Hm?" Li Xian suddenly paused. He remained motionless but felt a gaze scrutinizing him.

Li Xian thought, "Is the Madam watching? No, the Madam shouldn't be concerned with such small matters. But... if she sent someone else to monitor me, that is highly possible."

"If that is the case, and I keep this treasure for myself, the Madam will likely..."

The night passed.

Li Xian searched the place thoroughly, inside and out. Xu Lifeng had a rich foundation, accumulated over decades.

He found the treasure "Flesh Jade," the rare beasts "Good News Bird" and "Blue Blood Snake," and various basic martial arts manuals, about a dozen or so. However, they were all incomplete; the crucial parts of the mantras and formulas required verbal transmission.

Aside from this, there were over five hundred taels of silver. Li Xian felt there should be more. Perhaps some disciples had stolen some during the chaos.

One "Golden Leopard Great Blade."

The hilt was carved with a leopard's mouth in black gold. The spine of the blade was segmented like a human spine. Pouring Qi into it activated the mechanism.

The great blade became as flexible as a soft whip.

It was fierce yet soft, matching the Leopard Blade Sect's swordsmanship. When Xu Lifeng unleashed it with full power, it was terrifyingly effective. Unfortunately, in yesterday's battle, he had no chance to use it before drowning in the lake.

"A martial artist's life-and-death struggle is not won simply by having higher martial arts or deeper cultivation. One must use everything available," Li Xian lamented.

However, the root cause was that the Madam had effortlessly severed one of his hands, one of his feet, and one of his eyes, crippling eighty percent of his martial arts.

This gave Li Xian the opportunity to strike.

A scroll of a treasure map.

It depicted mountains and lakes, seemingly recording the location of a tomb. But Li Xian's current vision was limited to the Yihe Village and Qingning County; he truly couldn't decipher the clues.

He memorized the general layout by heart, then rolled it back up.

Aside from these, there were various miscellaneous items not worth mentioning. Li Xian organized everything.

随后，他回到了青宁湖。

He returned to Qingning Lake.

He took off his boots and jumped into the water. He dived to the bottom of the lake and found Xu Lifeng's corpse. After soaking overnight, his face was pale, his eyes wide open, unable to rest in peace.

Li Xian tried to move the body. However, it was very heavy, and it was difficult to exert force in the water. He tried twice but failed.

So, he went ashore to get a rope. He tied it around Xu Lifeng's waist and had people on the shore drag it.

The surrounding civilians gathered to watch.

When Xu Lifeng was dragged to the shore, the crowd gasped in shock and scattered in all directions.

"Magistrate Li, what... what kind of monster is this?"

The runners trembled with fear.

After Xu Lifeng died, the red fungus inside his body continued to grow. His face was completely covered by the fungus roots, densely packed, making one's spine crawl.

"This man was a demon who committed evil last night. I killed him on the spot. Do not spread rumors, lest you cause panic among the people!" Li Xian ordered.

"Magistrate Li, your might is unparalleled!"

The runners looked at him with reverence.

Li Xian kept his promise. He placed Xu Lifeng's body intact into the black coffin provided by the Madam. Then, he had people load all the treasures of the Leopard Blade Sect onto carriages.

He hauled them back to Yihe Village.

The sun rose, dispelling the darkness and bringing clarity.

Inside Yihe Village.

"Your servant greets you."

Xiang Shu, who toiled tirelessly in the village managing the accounts, arrived at the inner courtyard early in the morning. He bypassed Qiuyue and entered Madam Wen's bedroom directly.

He prostrated himself on the ground, performing a special ritual. His devotion was absolute.

Madam Wen was behind a curtain, still sleeping in bed. She was drowsy, her breath fragrant like an orchid. Hearing the noise, she opened her eyes slightly and said, "Why have you come?"

Xiang Shu said, "Madam, Xu Lifeng is dead!"

"Oh?" Madam Wen showed a hint of curiosity. "How did he die?"

"Killed by Li Xian!" Xiang Shu reported truthfully.

"Interesting, very interesting." Madam Wen yawned and asked, "Didn't you say Li Xian set a challenge, inviting him to a duel in four days? How did he die last night?"

Xiang Shu replied respectfully, "I did not expect it either. By the time I realized it, Xu Lifeng was already dead. Only this morning did I figure it out. The boy deliberately sent the challenge to focus Xu Lifeng's attention on four days later, making him drop his guard recently."

"He then launched a surprise attack last night, catching him off guard and killing Xu Lifeng!"

"Did you see the situation yesterday?" Madam Wen asked curiously.

"Your servant followed your orders and monitored Xu Lifeng overnight. If Li Xian was in danger, I was to intervene and save him. Thus, I witnessed the scene last night." Xiang Shu recounted everything he saw yesterday.

How Li Xian sneaked in, how he burned the strange incense, how he succeeded in his sneak attack. How he lured Xu Lifeng into the lake, and how he killed him in the water.

Xiang Shu saw the general process, but he had no idea about the true details. He did not discover Li Xian's "Twin Pupils."

Because Li Xian's Twin Pupils had extremely sharp vision. They surpassed Xiang Shu's; if Xiang Shu had discovered them, Li Xian would have surely discovered him.

Xiang Shu said, "Madam, your vision is sharp. This Li Xian is indeed a talent. Although his origins are lowly, he has the bearing of a young dragon. But..."

"But what?" Madam Wen asked softly.

Xiang Shu said, "But... precisely because this boy is too clever. Your servant watched him rise from a bonded servant to a commander."

"He has now reached the county level, holding an official position. While luck played a part, this boy's scheming and depth of mind are certainly not lacking. Last night's battle is proof of that. And he is not a rigid or pedantic person."

"Someone like him will not be easily subdued like Pang Long. The balance of control must be decided by you, Madam."

Madam Wen frowned slightly and sat up slowly, pondering the matter.

"Madam, I have a plan to test this boy's loyalty," Xiang Shu said.

"Speak," Madam Wen said.

Xiang Shu said, "Last night, after Li Xian killed Xu Lifeng, he returned to his residence and rummaged through it."

"Although I was far away, I saw that he seemed to have found a strange treasure. Li Xian will return shortly. We just need to see if he presents this treasure to determine his loyalty."

Madam Wen nodded. "I understand. I have a plan. Xiang Shu, you may go and rest."

"Yes!" Xiang Shu took his leave.

Madam Wen walked out from behind the curtain and tied up her long hair. She thought, "Xiang Shu is right. This boy has decent talent and is quite clever. This young dragon... needs to be knocked around occasionally to make him submit from the heart."

Around the third quarter of the Chen hour (around 8:00 AM).

Li Xian transported the coffin back to the village.

"Bad luck, bad luck! Li Xian, what are you doing?! Bringing a coffin back here is lawless!" Qiuyue stood with her hands on her hips, pointing and criticizing. She wouldn't let Li Xian enter the village.

"Get out of the way." Li Xian couldn't be bothered with this woman. He grabbed her by the belt and threw her into the crowd.

Qiuyue let out a tragic scream as she was flung into the group. She was snobbish and despised the dirty, lowly servants. Her beautiful dress was instantly soiled, which was worse than death to her.

She screamed and wailed, furious enough to kill Li Xian. But she was intimidated by his aura and didn't dare make another move.

Li Xian pulled the black coffin into the village, heading straight for the inner courtyard.

"Madam, Xu Lifeng has been executed. As per your instructions, I kept his body intact and placed it in the black coffin!" Li Xian said directly upon seeing the Madam. "Would you like to inspect it?"

"No need." Madam Wen patted her clothes. "He is a dead man. What is the point of looking at him?"

"You have completed the task. I will not reward you. You may withdraw."

Madam Wen was a master of schemes. She knew Li Xian feared her. If she asked for the treasure, Li Xian would surely hand it over. That would not test his loyalty.

That was why she spoke first to let Li Xian leave. She gave him the illusion that he could get away with it, but in reality, she knew everything.

Li Xian was stunned. He thought, "If that's the case, I... can get away with it, keep the treasure, and study its use. Wouldn't that be great!"

His mind wavered for a moment, but he immediately rejected the idea. There were two reasons. First, he had felt a gaze on him last night. It felt like someone was watching. Although he didn't know who, it gave him a bad feeling.

Second, the Madam's scheming was deep and terrifying. She tested him without a trace. Every time she seemed to offer a benefit, it was actually a hidden trap.

Li Xian said, "Madam, I found some things at the Leopard Blade Sect that I wish to offer to you."

"Oh?" Madam Wen raised her eyebrows slightly.

Li Xian said, "Exquisite porcelain, gold and silver, rare birds and beasts. I dare not keep these for myself. I present them all to you now."

Madam Wen heard many things, but the word "treasure" was missing. She was already angry. It seemed Li Xian did want to hide something.

"Good, good. You are loyal. Take these things to the accounting office. Among so many items, pick one for yourself as a reward."

Her tone was gentle.

No one could tell her mood, and neither could Li Xian.

Li Xian stepped forward. "Besides that, I have one more thing to offer the Madam."

"To be honest... I was wrong. The strangeness of this item is something I have never seen before. When I first obtained it, I thought: 'The Madam is so powerful, she might not covet this item. Why not keep it for myself?' Although this thought was fleeting, I... ask the Madam to punish me."

He presented the "Flesh Jade."

Madam Wen walked over slowly and took the Flesh Jade. Confirming it was indeed a strange treasure, her previous anger vanished, replaced by great joy. While a strange treasure was valuable, it wasn't enough to make her this happy.

It was Li Xian's performance that satisfied her immensely.

If Li Xian had handed it over readily, Madam Wen would have suspected him of having deep schemes and hidden depths. Though his strength was young, his mind was old. The ease with which he made choices was actually very difficult!

The fact that Li Xian could reveal his true thoughts was excellent.

Although Madam Wen was delighted inside, her voice changed from its previous gentleness. She scolded, "What a white-eyed wolf! How dare you harbor such thoughts!"

She flicked her sleeve, sending Li Xian flying several zhang. He crashed into the wall with a loud bang.

Her temperament was unpredictable. She punished when happy, and rewarded when angry. This was displayed to the extreme. Just looking at her expression, no one would know she was in an excellent mood.

Madam Wen walked over slowly and said coldly, "If you dare have such thoughts again, I will punish you severely."

"You must know, these treasures are mine."

"Even you, are mine."
