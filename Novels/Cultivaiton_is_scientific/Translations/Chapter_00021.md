# Chapter 21 Preparation

"Father, achieving Second Place Scholar is already an extraordinary stroke of luck. How could I dare ask for more?" Li Shiming said with a smile to his father, Li Wenyuan.

He understood perfectly well that based on his examination papers during the provincial exams, he should have rightfully taken first place as the Provincial Champion without any external factors. From Li Wenyuan's words, it seemed that because of his identity as the prefect's son, the chief examiner had changed his ranking from first to second place to avoid any appearance of favoritism.

"I reviewed your answers—the Provincial Champion's work was clearly inferior to yours by more than a margin!" Li Wenyuan shook his head.

Li Shiming was well aware of this. Setting aside the classical interpretations and memorization sections, even the final policy essay was adapted from a top-scoring imperial examination essay from his past life. Using a champion-level essay in the provincial exams naturally eclipsed all other candidates.

"Originally, I only wanted you to participate in these exams to gain experience for the next round three years later. I never expected that at just fifteen, you'd have to leave home for the capital. And I can't leave Nanling Prefecture to accompany you..." Li Wenyuan continued, his voice tinged with concern.

This was a dilemma born of joy. A fifteen-year-old taking the metropolitan exams—if he passed and became a jinshi, it would be considered an auspicious sign in the current dynasty. While Li Wenyuan was overjoyed as a father, he couldn't help but worry about his son leaving home so young.

"Father, I'm not a child anymore!" Li Shiming quickly interjected, not wanting his father's concerns to derail his plans for the capital.

"I'm not trying to stop you from taking the exams. For your trip to the capital, I'll arrange passage on an official naval vessel and assign a team of guards to accompany you. Take Siqin and Moyan with you as well. Stay at our old residence in the capital, and I'll write a few letters of introduction for you to visit some family friends on my behalf." Li Wenyuan's words came out in an uncharacteristically rambling manner, devoid of his usual sternness.

But Li Shiming could feel the depth of his father's affection. Having merged with the memories and emotions of his original self, Li Wenyuan was now unquestionably his father in this world.

"By the way, I personally prepared some tea leaves. They turned out quite well—you should try them." Sensing the somber mood, Li Shiming changed the subject, gesturing to the three tea canisters he had brought before standing to take his leave.

Li Wenyuan watched his son depart, shaking his head slightly as he picked up one of the canisters. He didn't believe his son could produce anything remarkable in terms of tea, but it was the thought that counted. He brewed a small amount.

A rich, soothing aroma filled the air, refreshing both mind and body. As a tea connoisseur, Li Wenyuan immediately recognized its exceptional quality. He took a sip—mellow with a subtle sweetness, leaving a crisp, fragrant aftertaste. Yet he couldn't identify its origin.

After the first sip, warmth spread from his stomach throughout his body. The stiffness from prolonged sitting melted away, and his mind became remarkably clear. Even without knowing what kind of tea this was, he understood its extraordinary nature. Drinking it felt like soaking in warm water or awakening from a deep, rejuvenating sleep—his entire body brimming with vitality.

He carefully locked all three canisters, including the opened one, in a cabinet. "This child, he didn't even explain properly," he muttered with an involuntary smile. Having raised Li Shiming alone after his wife's passing, seeing his son think of him with such a precious gift filled him with paternal pride.

Back in his courtyard, Li Shiming turned his thoughts to the impending journey. With the departure date approaching, he needed to consider his safety outside his father's protection. In Nanling Prefecture, his status alone provided security, but beyond its borders, even with guards, he wouldn't feel entirely at ease.

In his short time in this world, he had already encountered formidable figures—Chief Escort Wang, Shi Ximing (whom he had killed with nitroglycerin), and the two missing immortals. While he now stood a chance against someone like Chief Escort Wang, confronting an immortal remained beyond him. Though the odds seemed low, given how frequently he'd crossed paths with them, he couldn't afford complacency.

With this in mind, he retrieved the magical sword acquired from Shi Ximing. Initially, his limited spiritual energy had prevented proper examination of the artifacts. Now, he studied the sword closely. Made of iron, yet when he analyzed its structure through his enhanced senses and IBMz15 supercomputer, it revealed an entirely different molecular composition from ordinary iron. His current lack of arcane knowledge limited deeper analysis.

Testing its sharpness, he lightly struck a stone, leaving a ten-centimeter gash—astonishing for minimal effort. This was undoubtedly a peerless weapon. Channeling a trace of spiritual energy into the blade made it glow, imbuing it with an indescribable vitality. The same strike now cleaved the stone effortlessly, as if slicing through air.

Awed, he resolved to craft a scabbard for daily carry—this was a devastating tool. Though only at the second level of Qi Refinement and lacking formal swordsmanship, his enhanced reflexes, strength, and speed combined with this weapon could dispatch even formidable opponents unexpectedly.

Turning to defense, he examined the white robe obtained alongside the sword, sensing similar spiritual energy. Infusing it with qi made the garment emit a faint glow. Not daring to test it with the sword, he used scissors instead—stabbing and cutting proved futile against the enchanted fabric. He surmised it was defensive in nature, though without proper cultivation knowledge, his assessments remained speculative.

With minor modifications, the robe could pass as scholarly attire, while the sword at his waist completed the classic literati look—a perfect disguise for his newfound arsenal.
