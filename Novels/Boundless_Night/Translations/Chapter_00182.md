Chapter 182: So Excited I'm Rubbing My Hands

In the main hall of the temple, the white-clad woman gracefully walked over and said, "Do you think I would suppress you with a higher realm?"

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming was filled with confidence, almost rubbing his hands together. He couldn't wait, his heart yearning for a battle on the same level as an Ancestral Master-level figure! However, he also had some doubts about her origin, as the white-clad woman's mindset didn't seem aged.

"Senior, if I'm fortunate enough to win, I'd like that Five-Colored Bottle, and to study the complete scriptures on the hall walls," Qin Ming said.

"Still don't trust me?" The white-clad woman seemed a bit displeased.

Her dark hair veiled her face, a plain white dress draped over her slender waist, accentuating her tall figure and long, shapely legs. She gracefully glided closer.

Qin Ming chuckled awkwardly. Some things were better clarified beforehand. He changed the subject, saying, "Senior, which path do you intend to use for our spar?"

"I'm the type who gets stronger against stronger opponents, and against weaker ones... naturally even stronger. It's just the first realm, so we'll use the techniques of your 'Newborn Path'. I'll 'exchange pointers' with you in your most proficient domain," the white-clad woman said with a smile.

Although her words were gentle, Qin Ming could sense a deep-seated pride within her. She called it an "exchange," but her true intention was to defeat him in his strongest domain.

Then, he couldn't help but rub his hands together twice.

The white-clad woman immediately tilted her head and looked over, saying, "You're very excited and thrilled?"

This time, her voice was slightly higher. Though still pleasant to the ear, she seemed to be giving him a sidelong glance.

"No, I'm just nervous and scared. Whenever this happens, my palms get a little sweaty, and I have to quickly wipe them off," Qin Ming replied.

"Alright, just don't sweat during the fight," the white-clad woman said softly. She was about to brush the beautiful strands of hair from her forehead but stopped herself at the last moment.

"Are you ready?" she asked with a smile, her pure white dress fluttering as if woven from moonlight and mist.

As she took another graceful step, a hazy glow emanated from her body, and white mist rose from beneath her jade-like feet, making her appear ethereal and transcendent.

Qin Ming, dressed in coarse linen, with black hair falling over his shoulders, his eyes bright, looked ahead, extended a hand courteously, and said, "Please!"

"Boom!"

The entire main hall seemed to tremble. The white-clad woman, who moments before had been ethereal as a celestial being, now struck out like a bolt of lightning, emitting dazzling light, akin to a rainbow piercing the sun.

Qin Ming's expression turned serious. He discerned multiple variations in her attack. A simple palm strike, guided by the Withered Wood Force, accompanied by Earth Fire Force, allowing both Heavenly Light Forces to collide and "ignite" at any moment.

Furthermore, hidden behind it was a follow-up killer move from the Withered Wood Force, capable of inducing Yin-Yang transformations. And even further back, there might be Five-Colored Lightning Force to follow up, adding even more variables.

He admitted that the white-clad woman's cultivation on the Newborn Path was indeed extremely profound. A casual strike from her pure white palm contained the true essence of two or three remarkable techniques.

Fire Separation Force coiled around Qin Ming's fist, with real flames flickering. He slammed it forward, preemptively helping her detonate the Withered Wood Force.

In the main hall, astonishing Heavenly Light erupted. Their clothes flapped loudly as fists and palms collided, like dazzling thunder and fire interweaving and blossoming.

Indeed, Qin Ming's guess was correct. Earth Fire Force surged from her palm, further fueling the immense fire between them, accompanied by the sound of violent explosions.

If any other Seventh Rebirth cultivator had been there, they would likely have been incinerated and torn apart by the Heavenly Light Force.

The two moved rapidly, like two streaks of fire colliding, then separating, engaging in multiple fierce confrontations.

She was indeed proficient in the Withered-Flourish Scripture, transforming the Withered Wood Force to manifest Yin-Yang changes, and additionally striking with Five-Colored Lightning Force from her other hand, unleashing powerful moves right from the start.

In the Newborn realm, with such top-tier techniques combined with terrifying combat awareness, even core disciples from the top orthodox sects of other paths would be quickly overwhelmed and unable to keep up with such changes.

But Qin Ming blocked it.

He used ingenuity to break her techniques, circulating the River Lock Scripture. Dense mist surged, steam rose, channeling the Five-Colored Lightning Force, followed by a fierce surge of Wind Force.

He broke through her lightning bombardment.

Next, Qin Ming used brute force to counter skill, integrating the Silk Scroll Art. His right fist, like a Golden Crow clenched within, blasted out, meeting her Yin-Yang transformations head-on.

After the white-clad woman triggered the Yin-Yang transformation, black and white forces intertwined, then blossomed into three-colored radiance, resembling the "two beget three, then myriad transformations" principle of a certain Daoist lineage.

However, Qin Ming's entire body pulsed with Heavenly Light Force. He met her head-on. Even as several remarkable techniques emerged from her, after his punch landed, he pressed forward fearlessly.

In an instant, the woman's pure white hands came together, clamping Qin Ming's fist, intending to twist it off directly.

At this moment, numerous intricate characters actually appeared on her hands. Qin Ming had never seen such a remarkable technique and immediately unleashed extremely terrifying power.

The white-clad woman's hands closed, top and bottom, as if heaven and earth were merging. It was absolutely a top-tier remarkable technique. The scattered light fragments splashed by her Heavenly Light Force even carried characters resembling dragon and phoenix seals.

However, despite her hands exerting force, twisting twice in an instant, it didn't break. Meanwhile, Qin Ming's other palm burst with light and struck towards her forehead.

At this moment, in his eyes, there was no senior, only an opponent. There was no question of respect or disrespect.

The white-clad woman drifted sideways, like a phantom shattering the night sea, appearing and disappearing without a trace. This was a strange footwork, like instantaneous movement, avoiding his palm.

Qin Ming followed up, River Lock Force combined with Thunder-Fire Force. Amidst the dense mist, a flash of electricity descended, indiscriminately attacking her afterimages.

At the same time, his feet vibrated as he circulated the Wuji Scripture, initially drawing forth the essence of the earth. With a boom, the ground violently shook. Seizing the moment her steps momentarily faltered, he closed in.

Qin Ming circulated the Wuji Scripture, seeming to merge with the earth. Yellow earth-qi boiled around him as he unleashed a barrage of punches and palms forward.

Simultaneously, Fire Separation Force surged, mixing with the earth-qi.

The two figures moved rapidly, like two birds chasing and intertwining, fists and palms clashing. His linen clothes flapped, her white dress danced, long legs swept, dark hair flowed.

When the earth-qi and Fire Separation Force had sufficiently merged, the ground beneath Qin Ming's feet turned slightly red.

Immediately, he fiercely unleashed Thunder-Fire Force, raining down from above, and also activated Purple Mansion Thunder-Fire Force!

This was his combination of multiple remarkable techniques and force arts, ultimately unleashing: Heavenly Thunder Igniting Earth Fire.

Back then, even a single Earth Fire or Heavenly Thunder internal refinement was terrifying. Now, with so many cultivation arts working in synergy, their power was naturally greater and incredibly astonishing.

This was an impromptu improvisation by Qin Ming during the battle, and its effect was surprisingly good. Facing the woman, he could clearly feel her graceful body tense up. This was her first time feeling somewhat nervous.

Moreover, he was certain that at the Seventh Rebirth stage, it would be impossible for her to evade with her speed, unless she... cheated.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Earth Fire and earth-qi surged from the ground, while lightning descended from above. Natural affinity drew them together, creating an astonishingly spectacular scene.

The white-clad woman's feet glowed, each step a flicker of illusion and disappearance, as if she were traversing space-time. It was all because her speed was too extreme.

However, she still couldn't outpace the Heavenly Thunder Igniting Earth Fire. Caught within it, she received a barrage of crackling electric arcs, causing her undulating figure to stiffen slightly.

Qin Ming, seeing this, naturally wouldn't miss the chance. He charged forward, activating Thunder-Fire Force, adding "fuel to the fire."

The white-clad woman gritted her teeth, almost "breaking her vow" and simply fouling, but she was also very proud. Seeing the look in his eyes, she ultimately held back.

Crackle, crackle!

She wasn't purely enduring the lightning. Circulating a mysterious scripture, she was like a thread severing the sky, cutting off some of the Earth Fire and weakening some of the Heavenly Thunder.

Even so, she still endured a wave of thunder-fire, her body crackling with electricity. While this was nothing to her cultivation, to acknowledge that she was at the Seventh Rebirth level, she had to be genuine and not "cross the line."

Seeing this, Qin Ming's fists and palms left behind numerous afterimages. He was fighting with excitement and thrill, serving this "Ancestral Master" with the fiercest punches and kicks.

It was his first time battling such a figure, and he genuinely felt a sense of accomplishment.

Now, the two were engaging in a complete head-on clash.

Because after taking the electrical discharge, the white-clad woman couldn't instantly move away. She was enveloped by his fists and palm shadows, forced to counterattack.

Their legs were also in motion, occasionally sweeping towards each other. Instantly, her white dress would billow, and a long leg would kick, creating terrifying sonic booms.

Finally, the woman broke free from him and retreated at extreme speed, in a state befitting the Seventh Rebirth. Her hands were slightly trembling and spasming.

This state made her very unhappy; she had actually been "abused" by someone.

Strictly speaking, in that brief moment, she was only at a disadvantage, not quite miserably abused.

At this point, her pure white long dress was damaged. Both wide sleeves had been pierced through by the thunder-fire, turning into ash, revealing her fair, delicate arms, which glowed like mutton-fat jade.

Qin Ming felt that this kind of sparring was truly exhilarating. He was testing some of his ideas, skillfully combining various Heavenly Light Forces, experiencing it to the fullest.

At the same time, he realized that his opponent was very fair-minded. She genuinely hadn't used a higher realm to suppress him; even her clothes were ordinary silk, not a treasure armor.

"You cheated," the white-clad woman said, looking at him.

Even though she didn't walk the Newborn Path, her insight, experience, and techniques were all formidable, yet she had ended up somewhat disheveled, which truly exceeded her expectations.

She felt that his foundation was unrealistically thick, severely exceeding the norm. Could the Seventh Rebirth truly reach this level?

If she hadn't used clever techniques and wondrous arts to counter, her situation would definitely be worse than it was now.

"No," Qin Ming faced her calmly, shaking his head. "Senior hasn't lost yet, aren't you very strong too?"

Upon hearing this, the white-clad woman clenched her pure white fists. His meaning was that if he cheated, then she had also gone "off-syllabus."

In fact, she had indeed crossed the red line, because some remarkable techniques and special scriptures could not be learned, or fully learned, at the Newborn stage.

She had used some secret chapters, which was why she could remain undefeated.

The white-clad woman looked at herself, truly disheveled. Her sleeves were burned, and most of her pure white arms were exposed. This was truly a terrible experience.

She habitually reached to brush aside the dark, beautiful hair obscuring her face, but just as she swept it halfway, she remembered something and immediately lowered her hand.

In an instant, Qin Ming saw a profile of peerless beauty, fair and translucent, captivating his gaze, making him unwilling to look away.

It could be confirmed that she was not a "malicious ghost" with supernatural characteristics.

"Senior, your cultivation is profound, and your bearing is unparalleled!" Qin Ming praised and complimented, mainly fearing that this spar might anger his opponent.

As a result, the white-clad woman's face immediately darkened slightly. Being praised after taking a loss just didn't feel right!

"Again! I'm getting serious now!" she declared. Clearly, she was extremely proud and confident. Even if this wasn't her path, she was still bothered by being at a disadvantage.

She strode forward, her body enveloped in pure moonlight. Her tattered yet pure white long dress fluttered like flowing clouds, seemingly graceful and ethereal, yet within her body, astonishing Heavenly Light Force surged, ready to erupt.

Qin Ming couldn't help it; he rubbed his hands again, even more expectant. He wanted to fight to his heart's content today!

The white-clad woman's expression froze slightly. What was wrong with this kid? Hearing that she was going to fight him even more seriously, he became even more excited?!

Earlier, she had watched his fight and noticed he hadn't been this excited when battling that old woman.

And she already knew about his grievances with the old woman.

The white-clad woman clenched her fists, finding this kid utterly detestable. To have such an attitude towards her, it was simply outrageous!

"Senior, are you ready?" Qin Ming asked, preparing to go all out!
