# Chapter 131: The Second Trial, The Bronze Palace (Part 1)

In that instant, Ye Bing felt a momentary daze.

Some memories she had pushed to the corner of her mind, unwilling to think about, once again uncontrollably surfaced from the depths of her consciousness.

What if this ranking was the same as the last one?

Soaking in the hot spring... and having to wear *that* kind of clothing...

Ye Bing’s face was expressionless. Her slender, jade-like fingers curled, tightening around Tian Shuang.

"Oi, Ice Cube?"

Li Mo waved his five fingers in front of her eyes.

Ye Bing raised her eyes, her face deadly serious. "I haven't, and I never will."

"???"

Little Li scratched his head, full of question marks.

Why did the Ice Cube suddenly change her vibe like that?

It felt strange.

"Huu..."

Ye Bing let out a soft breath and looked towards the depths of the秘境 (Secret Realm).

The aura of the Blood Phoenix Essence was getting closer.

The scenes in her mind would never happen...

*BOOM—*

The piercing white light dissipated, leaving only a portal behind.

Through it, one could vaguely see layers of bronze stairs, looking like artifacts from a bygone era.

Above the stairs stood five palaces.

Each palace was ancient and magnificent. Unlike the refined style of the Great Yu era, their form was rough and imposing, inspiring awe.

All the palaces floated in the air.

"This should be... a structure from the Great Shang Dynasty."

"The Great Shang revered the Bronze Divine Tree and used the hundred birds as their totem. It makes sense that the Blood Phoenix would be loyal to it," someone spoke.

Li Mo looked towards the voice and found it was Senior Brother Ouyang from the Ruyi Peak.

As soon as these words were spoken, the crowd was in an uproar. Their eyes were filled with shock and immense excitement.

A Secret Realm from the Great Shang Dynasty that has existed to this day, and it is preserved so perfectly.

The opportunities hidden within it probably far exceed everyone's imagination!

**[Second Trial: Ascend the Azure Clouds.]**

**[Those who enter the Fourth Palace shall witness Creation and Immortality.]**

The content of the trial was very simple.

The bronze stairs and the four palaces themselves were the trial.

It was similar to the Ascending Heaven Stone Steps.

Whether you understood or not, the only way was to climb upwards.

Creation and Immortality!

Who dares to speak of Creation?

Who dares to claim Immortality?

Such grand words, combined with this mysterious floating Bronze Palace, made everyone believe it a little.

So, they all stepped forward and walked into the portal.

"This Secret Realm is a bit different from what I imagined?"

Little Li felt something was off.

Why did the Secret Realm feel like an entrance exam?

The first trial was nothing more than a test of combat strength and cunning, even with a hint of intentionally making people kill each other.

The second trial created something similar to the Ascending Heaven Stone Steps.

This wasn't him daydreaming or guessing based on his experience reading novels.

He had been to a proper inheritance site before.

The inheritance site below Qing Yuan didn't have any messy trials.

If you weren't chosen by the inheritance, you couldn't even reach the site.

Was he overthinking it?

...

After everyone entered, the portal vanished.

But the people at the front looked at each other; no one took the lead to go up.

No one wanted to be the first bird to fly out.

Who knew what variables would occur after walking up? Everyone wanted others to clear the path first.

"Hmph, I see that you all are just a bunch of nobodies selling your heads for money."

Bai Jinghong walked onto the stairs with his head held high, his face full of arrogance.

After stepping onto the first step, he only frowned.

There was nothing else unusual.

The people behind him exchanged glances, then followed suit.

At this stage, the few remaining members of the Qing Yuan Sect stood together. Aside from Li Mo's group, there was only Ouyang, another true disciple from another peak, and Tie Qi.

Li Mo and Ye Bing walked ahead of the group.

He stepped onto the first stair and understood immediately.

This was different from the Ascending Heaven Stone Steps.

The Ascending Heaven Stone Steps tested aptitude; the stronger the aptitude, the less pressure one felt.

---

But on this staircase, after stepping on it, there was no pressure at all.

"Just a simple staircase leading to the palace?"

Just as he thought this.

Li Mo felt a whisper in his heart. When he listened carefully, it seemed like it didn't exist.

He glanced at the others out of the corner of his eye and found they had no unusual expressions either.

It seemed the real trial was probably inside the palace...

"Hahaha, money... so much money, and heavenly treasures, divine weapons!"

Suddenly.

A person, his face filled with wild joy, staggered towards the edge of the stairs.

Then he missed a step and fell.

The abyss below was deep; no sound of him landing was heard. It was unknown if he was sent out of the Secret Realm.

"Huh?"

Li Mo was confused.

Then, his vision blurred. He actually saw stacks of red bills right in front of him.

Li Mo: "..."

The illusion disappeared in an instant.

Let's just say, the money from the previous life couldn't be spent in this one.

"Money?"

"I just saw an illusion too, it was a divine weapon..."

"Is this trial testing whether we can suppress the greed in our hearts?"

...

No one who made it this far was a fool. They quickly realized what the real trial was.

So, the number of people who fell by stepping off the edge later wasn't many.

A moment later.

Most people successfully climbed to the front of the First Palace.

*BOOM—*

The palace doors opened, revealing a dazzling sight inside.

It was filled with countless rare treasures, divine weapons, spiritual herbs and pills, pearls the size of fists, and blocks of pure gold, piled up throughout the entire palace.

*Gulp—*

"妈呀 (Oh my god), how much... wealth is this?"

"My sect's treasury doesn't have even one percent of this."

"Pure gold! One tael of pure gold can exchange for ten taels of normal gold, and here it's piled up like a mountain!"

Everyone present had seen the world, and many spoke of treating money like dirt.

But wealth moves people's hearts; how many can truly be free from俗 (vulgarity/practicality)?

Practicing martial arts is very expensive!

In a certain sense, having money can be even more important than having talent.

**[Kneel and bow, and you may enter this door.]**

...

The meaning of the stone tablet was simple.

Bow a few times, and you can go in and take the wealth.

Correspondingly, you give up the chance to continue the trial.

Many people hesitated, but in the end, some couldn't resist.

"Damn it, isn't the reason I fought so hard for all this? With this wealth, what can't I get?"

"The things later might be good, but they don't necessarily belong to us. Why don't we split this wealth?"

"Maybe the things in this First Palace are the best?"

...

Out of fifty people, more than ten walked into the palace.

There were still over thirty left.

"Just dirt," Bai Jinghong said, his eyebrows twitching, and continued forward.

Tie Qi looked at the wealth inside, his breathing heavy. However, looking at someone who was unmoved, he ultimately stopped his steps.

"Brother Li, you... aren't interested in these?"

"I am interested."

"Then why..."

"They give too little."

Li Mo shook his head slightly.

Tie Qi: "???"

Listen to what you're saying!

Even if Brother Li has some wealth, he can't possibly compare to the richness inside this palace.

He must be indifferent and just saying that on purpose.

Ye Bing, of course, goes without saying.

The Ice Cube thinks counting money is quite happy, but only if she watched it being earned bit by bit.

Ouyang also didn't seem interested in money.

As for Little Bao...

Everything inside isn't as valuable as he is himself.
