# Chapter 11: Self-Destruction

The human body is a small universe, formations a grand one.

The theoretical foundation of formations originates from the "World Architecture Theory," using the essence, energy, and spirit of mountains and rivers as a guide to temporarily construct something akin to a cultivator's creation.

This creation is connected to the cultivator's essence, energy, and spirit, causing their magical power to surge, enough to kill powerful enemies. In short, formations, like ancestral artifacts, are essentially alternative natal magic treasures for cultivators.

The *Spirit Sword Gathering Yuan Grand Formation* that Fang Jun had set up used the mountains and rivers as meridians and low-grade spirit stones as the dantian, gathering the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into one body, instantly raising his magical power to the nineteenth level of Qi Refining.

Only six levels separated him from Fang Tianxiong's twenty-fifth level cultivation. This gap of six levels was no longer an insurmountable chasm in Fang Jun's eyes!

"Buzz—"

Under the infusion of vast magical power, the Heavenly Balance Sword swelled layer upon layer, transforming into a towering giant sword. The sword's edge was chillingly bright, as if it could tear through space.

Fang Jun's eyes were like lightning, and with a sword incantation in his hand, the giant sword descended with the force of thunder, aimed directly at Fang Tianxiong's head!

Upon seeing this, a trace of panic flashed in Fang Tianxiong's eyes, but it was quickly replaced by a ferocious expression.

He roared and fully activated the token and ancestral artifact in his hands.

In an instant, the originally collapsing ancient Taotie phantom re-condensed, surrounded by blazing flames, like a world-destroying demon god, opening its bloody mouth to meet the Heavenly Balance Sword.

"Boom—!"

The giant sword and the Taotie phantom collided with a deafening roar.

Flames and sword energy intertwined, forming a violent energy storm that swept around. Under the crushing force of the giant sword, the Taotie phantom shattered inch by inch, eventually turning into a sky full of fire and dissipating.

Fang Tianxiong was struck by lightning, spitting out blood, flying backward, and crashing heavily to the ground, his body riddled with fractures.

All of this was within Fang Jun's expectations.

Fang Tianxiong's true cultivation was only at the sixteenth level of Qi Refining (cultivation plus natal magic treasure), plus the superficial ninth level of Qi Refining (ancestral artifact bonus), making his power unable to be perfectly integrated.

And Fang Jun, under the integration of Meta-Mind One, could exert the power of the nineteenth level of Qi Refining to the fullest, even with the help of the formation.

Not to mention that his combat skills and timing were far superior to Fang Tianxiong's.

Furthermore, the *Spirit Sword Gathering Yuan Grand Formation* itself, like a magic treasure, had a special design structure that could enhance the power of attacks.

Fang Jun slowly stepped forward, the Heavenly Balance Sword returning to its original state, the tip pointing directly at Fang Tianxiong, and coldly said, "Do you have any last words?"

Fang Tianxiong's eyes were full of ferocity as he struggled to get up from the ground, gritting his teeth and saying, "Damn it! Damn it! It's like this now! It was like this back then too! That bitch ruined my path! And now you, this bastard, want to kill your father?"

"Bitch?" Fang Jun frowned, a hint of unease rising in his heart. "Was there a secret to my mother's death back then?"

Fang Tianxiong sneered, "There is no secret! Even if there is, I won't tell you!"

Fang Jun wanted to pursue the question, but—

"Boom—!"

Fang Tianxiong suddenly self-destructed, and violent magical power swept around like a tide.

However, the power of the self-destruction was dispersed in three-dimensional space, and coupled with the obstruction of flesh and blood, its power was far less than that of a cultivator using spells or magic treasures to concentrate an attack on one point.

Moreover, there was still a distance between Fang Tianxiong and Fang Jun.

When the smoke cleared, Fang Jun stood unharmed in place, his eyes without the slightest ripple.

He faintly uttered two words, "Uninteresting."

Then, he turned to look in the direction of North New Town, his gaze deep and cold. "Now, it's time for me to take what belongs to me."

...

"Crack—!"

A crisp cracking sound rang out in the silent room, as if a thin needle had pierced Fang Ming's heart.

He suddenly lowered his head, his pupils shrinking sharply, staring intently at the cracked wooden tablet in the storage bag, his voice trembling and hoarse, "How is it possible! How is it possible! Father's natal spirit tablet... how could it break!"

His fingers trembled slightly as he took it out, looking at it over and over again, as if just a few more glances could prove that it was just an illusion.

However, the cracks on the wooden tablet were still clearly visible.

"Buzz—!"

Just then, a faint light suddenly appeared on the wooden tablet, and then a phantom slowly emerged.

The phantom had a cold face and deep eyes, and it was Fang Tianxiong.

"Father!"

Fang Ming's voice was filled with undisguised excitement and panic, as if he had grasped the last straw.

Fang Tianxiong's phantom had a calm expression, quietly gazing at Fang Ming, his voice low and slow, "Ming'er, by the time you see this message, I am already dead."

"Father!"

Fang Ming's voice suddenly rose, with a hint of crying.

However, the phantom just continued to speak according to the set program, without responding to his call.

"Hehe, my path was cut off back then, and it's the same now." Fang Tianxiong's phantom chuckled, his tone with a bit of self-deprecation and unwillingness, "It seems that heaven does not grant my wishes, but I, Fang Tianxiong, will defy heaven!"

His voice paused, then became serious and deep, "I have left Fang Jun's umbilical cord blood that I took back then, as well as my natal blood essence, in this token."

"Although it is not as good as Fang Jun's own bones, it can still allow you to use the *Blood Source Fortune Seizing Art* to a certain extent."

Fang Ming's fists clenched tightly, his fingernails digging deep into his palms, blood seeping out between his fingers, but he was completely unaware.

"And I have already prepared a way out in advance." Fang Tianxiong's phantom continued, "Go to the secret room where you usually cultivate, there is a hidden one-time teleportation formation."

"The method to activate it is..."

"I obtained this from a lucky encounter, use it and leave immediately."

"That is also a secret room, with supplies I have stored, including talismans that shield from heavenly secrets, from the same source as the teleportation formation."

"After using it, you can protect yourself, and then go to the upper sect."

"Ming'er, remember," the phantom's voice gradually softened, "Once you go to the upper sect, you must cultivate well. The future of our lineage depends entirely on you."

As the words fell, Fang Tianxiong's phantom gradually became blurred, eventually turning into specks of light and dissipating into the air.

Fang Ming stood blankly in place, tears silently sliding from the corners of his eyes, dripping onto the wooden tablet in his hand.

"Father..." he murmured.

"Crack—!"

The wooden tablet completely shattered, turning into a pile of wood chips.

Only a drop of scarlet blood floated in the air, emitting a faint light.

Fang Ming reached out and tightly grasped the drop of blood in his palm, it was a mixture of Fang Jun's umbilical cord blood and Fang Tianxiong's natal blood essence.

"Father, I swear I will avenge you!"

His voice was low and firm, his eyes flashing with cold killing intent.

"Fang Jun! You wait! I will definitely make you die!"
