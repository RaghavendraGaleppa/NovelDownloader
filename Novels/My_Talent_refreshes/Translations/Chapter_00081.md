Chapter 81: Spirit Talismans, Rune Arts, and Blackmist Iron Soulwood

Chu Ning didn't rush to craft talismans. Instead, he first meditated and cultivated the Spirit Refining Art. Since he was going to attempt the talisman crafting techniques described on the spirit talismans and runes, it was only natural to adjust his spiritual sense to its optimal state. After all, continuous talisman crafting was quite demanding on one's spiritual sense.

Slowly opening his eyes, Chu Ning felt his spiritual sense was in excellent condition. He took out his mid-grade talisman brush, talisman ink, and talisman paper from his storage bag. After reviewing the crafting method for the Yin Thunder Talisman in his mind, Chu Ning focused his spiritual sense and began to draw. It had to be said that crafting low-grade mid-tier talismans was indeed more difficult than crafting low-grade low-tier talismans. Despite Chu Ning's intense focus and his use of spiritual sense for guidance, his first attempt at crafting the talisman still failed.

However, Chu Ning wasn't discouraged in the slightest. He could craft the Geng Metal Sword Talisman, hailed as the top attack talisman among low-grade mid-tier talismans, so this Yin Thunder Talisman was naturally well within his capabilities. After two attempts, Chu Ning successfully completed the Yin Thunder Talisman on his third try. He then struck while the iron was hot, using 20 sheets of talisman paper in one go.

"The success rate for crafting low-grade mid-tier talismans is currently only 40%. The difficulty has indeed increased. If I hadn't used my spiritual sense for guidance, a 30% success rate would already be considered good." Chu Ning shook his head, placing the 8 Yin Thunder Talismans aside. However, he also knew that with continuous practice of the same type of talisman, the crafting success rate could be greatly improved. Thus, Chu Ning quickly took out another 20 sheets of talisman paper and began crafting again. This time, his success rate improved slightly, resulting in 9 successful talismans.

If he were still in the sect, Chu Ning would have continued in one go until he achieved at least a 60% success rate. But at this moment, Chu Ning chose not to continue. Instead, he began crafting another type of talisman, the Clear Wind Talisman. For the market opening in three days, his shop naturally needed to have a variety of talismans available. He used 100 sheets of talisman paper in one breath, completing the crafting of two types of talismans before finally stopping. By now, his spiritual sense was considerably depleted. The consumption of spiritual sense for low-grade mid-tier talismans was also higher than for low-grade low-tier talismans. If they were low-grade low-tier talismans, with his current spiritual sense, crafting 150 sheets at once would be no problem.

Cultivating the Spirit Refining Art. Chu Ning certainly wouldn't miss such an opportunity to strengthen his spiritual sense. He somewhat expectantly took out the black sword and placed it on his crossed knees. Ever since discovering the miraculous properties of the black wooden sword, Chu Ning had focused all his energy on qi cultivation to break through to the sixth level of Qi Refining.

Therefore, he hadn't yet attempted to cultivate the Spirit Refining Art with the black wooden sword after significantly depleting his spiritual sense from talisman crafting. Chu Ning now wanted to try and see what effect combining these two methods, both capable of strengthening spiritual sense, would have.

Closing his eyes, he began cultivating the Spirit Refining Art. The spiritual sense that had been consumed within his Niwan Palace continuously recovered. After a while, a drop of spiritual sense liquid was fully restored. At this moment, the gaseous vortex around it continued to spin. After an unknown period, more of it transformed into liquid form and merged into that drop of spiritual sense liquid.

Chu Ning, with his eyes tightly closed, now opened them. He immediately checked his cultivation progress.
[Azure Wood Everlasting Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Second Layer (505/900)]
[Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, First Volume, Undying Bones 169/600]
[Spirit Refining Art, First Layer 135/1000]

"It increased by 1 point! Cultivating this way, the proficiency of the Spirit Refining Art can indeed be sped up." Chu Ning looked at the rising proficiency of the Spirit Refining Art with a hint of pleasant surprise. According to his usual methods, cultivating twice or thrice a day using two separate methods would only increase proficiency by about 1 point. But now, with the spiritual sense consumption from talisman crafting combined with the effect of the black wooden sword, Chu Ning gained 1 point of proficiency in a single cultivation session. Although this was partly due to the extended duration of this particular session, it still greatly delighted Chu Ning. This meant his previous conjecture was completely correct: combining the two could significantly boost the proficiency of the Spirit Refining Art.

"I'll do it this way from now on!" Chu Ning made up his mind. After all, crafting talismans was something he did daily to earn spirit stones. At the same time, he could also strengthen his spiritual sense. Killing two birds with one stone!

Simultaneously, Chu Ning became intensely curious about what exactly this black wooden sword was made of. He took out the jade slip of the Spiritual Plant Compendium that He Changyou had given him and examined it carefully. The sheer number of spiritual plant species listed within was immense, numbering in the thousands. When Chu Ning was still in the sect, he had only spent time browsing a small portion of it. There was still a lot of content he hadn't seen, and he wondered if he could find any relevant clues here.

He looked through the various spiritual plants, meticulously examining over 1,200 species. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. The description of one particular spiritual plant caught Chu Ning's attention: Blackmist Iron Soulwood. After just a glance at its description, Chu Ning immediately read it in detail. Moments later, Chu Ning picked up the black wooden sword resting on his lap, activated the Azure Wood Everlasting Art, and slowly channeled his spiritual power into it.

At the same time, Chu Ning's spiritual sense also perceived the changes in the black wooden sword. Immediately, an expression of sudden realization appeared on Chu Ning's face, which then quickly turned into one of mixed joy and worry.

At this moment, Chu Ning had basically confirmed that the black wooden sword in his hand was indeed made of Blackmist Iron Soulwood. This spiritual plant had two extremely unique characteristics. First, it was incredibly hard and heavy, making it difficult for ordinary tools to cut. The old man Sun had told Chu Ning that a simple formation was carved into this black wooden sword, causing it to lighten when spiritual power was injected. In reality, this wasn't due to the formation's effect. Rather, the Blackmist Iron Soulwood itself would lighten upon sensing wood-attribute spiritual power. The formation on it served another purpose entirely.

This led to the Blackmist Iron Soulwood's other characteristic. Once this spiritual plant was cut, the wood would automatically emit accumulated essence over the years. If this essence could be absorbed and refined, it had the effect of strengthening one's spiritual sense. As for the small formation here, it was actually meant to lock the Blackmist Iron Soulwood's essence, preventing it from dissipating. When Chu Ning cultivated the Spirit Refining Art, activating the formation allowed him to absorb the essence within the wood to strengthen his spiritual sense.

After figuring all this out, Chu Ning was undoubtedly filled with mixed joy and worry. His joy stemmed from finally knowing the origin of this black wooden sword. He never expected that something he bought from old man Sun for only ten spirit stones would turn out to be so extraordinary. He just wondered which master crafted such a large Blackmist Iron Soulwood sword and how it ended up neglected and gathering dust outside.

His worry, however, was that the jade slip mentioned that Blackmist Iron Soulwood had no fixed growing location and no related cultivation methods. Thus, under normal circumstances, it was extremely difficult to find. Moreover, once all the wood essence within it was used up, its effect of strengthening spiritual sense would vanish. The jade slip also stated that as the wood essence within the Blackmist Iron Soulwood was consumed, its color would gradually fade, and its toughness would also decrease. When all the wood essence was completely dissipated, the wood would turn back to its original wood color, and its toughness would be no different from ordinary wood. Chu Ning had just carefully examined the wood and discovered that, compared to when he first obtained it, there was indeed a slight change in color. However, this color change was extremely subtle, and Chu Ning, who hadn't thought in this direction before, hadn't noticed it at all.

"This Blackmist Iron Soulwood sword is quite large. I hope it can support my cultivation for a good while longer," Chu Ning muttered to himself. He carefully put away the jade slip and the Blackmist Iron Soulwood sword back into his storage bag.

Before, he had simply thought it was an ordinary piece of wood, so Chu Ning had tossed and smashed it around casually, even using it to practice his Object Manipulation Art. But now, knowing it was a treasure, Chu Ning naturally stored it away with great care.

The night passed uneventfully. The next morning, even though it wasn't a market day, Chu Ning woke up as usual. He first went to the courtyard and cast the Azure Wood Verdant Spring Art on all the Azure Spirit Fruits. Looking at the vibrant, thriving vines, Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction. At this rate, in about ten days, the courtyard would be completely covered in Azure Spirit Fruit vines. This brought a sense of peace to Chu Ning, who was accustomed to a courtyard full of vines. He hadn't forgotten how effective his Thorn Art had been when he faced Qi Chongmao.

After a full cycle of cultivation—practicing the Azure Wood Everlasting Art, Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, talisman crafting, and Spirit Refining Art—Chu Ning ate breakfast before heading out of the market town towards his spiritual fields. His Purple Spirit Bamboo had just been planted, and he hadn't cast the Azure Wood Verdant Spring Art on them yesterday. The Golden Yuan Fruit seeds given by Gu Xiaoqing also needed to be planted promptly; it would be a great waste to leave the spiritual fields idle.

The beginning of everything is always difficult, especially for Chu Ning, who had just arrived at Yanji Market. He had too many things to do. Over the next two days, Chu Ning's life became a two-point line between the market town and the spiritual fields. He spent about half of his daytime in the spiritual fields, planting Golden Yuan Fruits and nurturing Purple Spirit Bamboo. In the evenings, he returned to the market town, and after a brief nurturing of the Azure Spirit Fruits, he began his cultivation and talisman crafting.

In just over two days, Chu Ning not only crafted Yin Thunder Talismans but also Clear Wind Talismans, Vajra Talismans, Spirit Concealment Talismans, and Earth Evasion Talismans, not missing a single one. He also crafted the Beast Trapping Talisman that Liao Yunming had given him. There were quite a few demonic beasts in the mountains near Yanji Market, so the Beast Trapping Talisman naturally had a market. As for the Geng Metal Sword Talisman, Chu Ning only made a few and had no immediate plans to sell them. He had already tested the Geng Metal Sword Talisman he crafted at Mu Ling's place in an uninhabited area. He immediately decided that this talisman would be his final trump card, not to be sold until a critical moment.

Every time he crafted talismans, Chu Ning would inevitably deplete his spiritual sense to about seventy or eighty percent, feeling a slight fatigue. Then, Chu Ning would use the Blackmist Iron Soulwood sword to cultivate the Spirit Refining Art. Under Chu Ning's targeted cultivation, the proficiency of the Spirit Refining Art also increased rapidly, with a daily increase of over 2 points. Time flew by, and soon it was once again the Yanji Market's bi-daily market opening day.

This morning, Chu Ning didn't wander around elsewhere and open his shop late as he had done last time. Instead, he opened his doors early and hung out his sign.

Gu Xiaoqing was the second to open her shop. As she opened her door, she saw that Chu Ning's shop across the street was already open even earlier than hers, and a hint of surprise appeared in her eyes. When her keen gaze swept over the sign Chu Ning had hung, she paused slightly, seeing what was written on it:

"Various high-quality low-grade mid-tier talismans for sale:
Yin Thunder Talismans, Spirit Concealment Talismans, Clear Wind Talismans - Five low-grade spirit stones.
Beast Trapping Talismans, Earth Evasion Talismans - Six low-grade spirit stones.
