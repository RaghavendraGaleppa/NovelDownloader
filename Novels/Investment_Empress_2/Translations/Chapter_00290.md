Chapter 290: Eighty? What is This Kid Chanting?

Dark clouds obscured the bright moon, making the early winter night in the Southern Frontier even colder.

In the pitch-black darkness, the soft glow emanating from the Mountain Lord's Temple became the only warm hue.

Little Li's horns secretly sprouted from his head, a layer of soft, white fur grew on his neck, and his clear, bright eyes seemed even more pure and spirited.

However, Xiang Liu and Fei Yi, locked in their stare-down,显然 failed to notice this.

"Indeed... there is only one Jade of the Gods from Beyond the Heavens," Fei Yi said, scratching its head with its tail.

The reason it had come along with Xiang Liu was that two excellent elixirs were not enough for four disaster beasts to share.

"You fool! If we don't kill this kid, do we even need to worry about how to share?"

Two of Xiang Liu's four heads stared at Li Mo, while the other two scolded Fei Yi.

"I take Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; you take Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. We are close friends, isn't that how we've always shared? When have I ever tricked you?"

"Alright."

Fei Yi thought about it and felt that made sense.

The two disaster beasts set their sights on Li Mo again, preparing to send him on his way first before rushing into the Mountain Lord's Temple.

"Wait!"

"I have one more thing to say. If you don't listen, you will definitely regret it."

The Baize-possessed Little Li raised his hand again.

"You talk too much nonsense."

"What are your last words?"

The two disaster beasts felt that both Li Mo and the Jade of the Gods from Beyond the Heavens in the temple were already in their grasp. Furthermore, the negative emotions from earlier had been dispelled by the pure moonlight, which was why they had managed to hold back until now.

The light in the Baize-possessed Little Li's Eyes of Destiny faded. He asked with a hint of pity:

"Fei Yi, didn't you agree with Xiang Liu that the power of the living beings in your territory would be split, with Monday, Wednesday, and Friday going to him, and Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday going to you?"

"When you went out on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, didn't Xiang Liu also come to help you guard your cave?"

"That's right. I was the one who asked him to go. It's pitiable for my wife to be alone in the cave."

Fei Yi nodded, thinking Xiang Liu was quite righteous.

Xiang Liu's expression shifted slightly; he had a bad feeling about this.

The Baize-possessed Little Li sighed softly:

"Your wife is pregnant, isn't she?"

"Huh? How did you know?"

"Congratulations on your upcoming son."

The Baize-possessed Little Li cleared his throat:

"It's just that he might not have anything to do with you."

Fei Yi was a complete sucker.

The two disaster beasts occupied the same territory, but the worship on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday all went to Xiang Liu, meaning Fei Yi白白 missed out on a day's worth of worship.

And when he went out to absorb the power of the living beings, Xiang Liu wasn't idle either...

"?"

Fei Yi's big head seemed to turn green in an instant.

"Don't listen to his nonsense!" Xiang Liu panicked, not intending to let Li Mo say any more.

But before he could pounce, Fei Yi blocked his path.

"Take your time. This kid is dead anyway. Let him finish talking first."

"You should go home and check right now," the Baize-possessed Little Li said with pity in his eyes. "The number of heads might be... a bit off."

"Demons and demons have different physiologies! It's perfectly normal to be born with two heads if it's a mutation!"

"How did you know it was two heads when I don't even know?"

"Listen to me explain..."

Xiang Liu made a gesture as if he was about to explain, but suddenly his figure blurred, and he shot towards the Mountain Lord's Temple like a slingshot.

Black water surged from around his body.

"Don't think you can get the Jade of the Gods from Beyond the Heavens before me!"

The sucker, Fei Yi, followed in shock and anger.

The four wings behind its head unfurled, and its strange appearance made one's mouth go dry. The black water blocking its path was all evaporated.

The two demons did not fight to the death on the spot.

---

But they had already achieved Li Mo's expectation. At the very least, they would not work together closely and would instead be suspicious of and restrain each other, neither wanting the other to get there first.

That was enough.

*Whoosh!*

In the blink of an eye, Xiang Liu actually came to a sudden halt.

"If you want to go first, then I'll let you go first!"

The black water suddenly surged up, forming a rolling torrent that swept up Fei Yi, who had already unleashed his explosive strength.

Before Li Mo withdrew his Baize transformation, he faintly sensed the other's thoughts.

Xiang Liu understood his strength better, so he was using the sucker Fei Yi to charge ahead and wear him down.

*BOOM!*

Fei Yi had no choice but to press on. The brute force of a Sixth-Rank disaster beast erupted instantly, crashing forward with the immense power of the black torrent.

This collision would be enough to shatter a small mountain.

But at the same time, a golden light of glazed jade also flared from Li Mo's body, instantly covering him all over.

*CLANG!*

The golden light of glazed jade seemed restrained and thin, but when it collided with Fei Yi, it directly shattered the latter's hard scales. This creature, a behemoth in its own right, was sent flying backward, tumbling several times and crushing a large swathe of trees.

"You fool, you still want to get ahead of me," Xiang Liu said with a cruel smile.

The Young Clan Leader had said that Li Mo, who had transformed into a member of the Mingjiao Clan, possessed a strange golden light that could make his body harder than divine iron for a short time.

He had just experienced it for himself.

This move probably couldn't be used frequently, otherwise it would be too heaven-defying.

Apart from that, the other party's so-called powerful strength and the ability to deceive the bloodline power of other demons were nothing to fear.

He was a Sixth-Rank disaster beast, after all; his bloodline power could already influence the heavens and the earth.

"Kid, that was your strongest move just now, wasn't it?"

The four-headed Xiang Liu did not take the opportunity to pounce on Li Mo, but instead charged straight for the Mountain Lord's Temple, his hissing voice full of mockery.

"While I go get the divine jade, you can try to run and see if you can escape with your life."

However...

Inside the Mountain Lord's Temple.

Ying Bing lightly pressed her lips together, watching the four massive snake heads rapidly enlarge.

If Xiang Liu rushed into the temple, she would have no choice but to出手.

Her hand had just touched the hilt of her sword.

The very next moment.

Xiang Liu's four-headed figure came to an abrupt halt, stiffening as if it had been caught by a rope.

Its tail had been grabbed.

"Oi, who said my strongest move was the Golden Body?" Li Mo said, gripping its tail.

Xiang Liu: "?"

He certainly hadn't thought Li Mo could escape.

It was just that this kid had sowed discord, forcing him and Fei Yi to fall out, and he still had to deal with the other disaster beast.

That was why he wanted to repay kindness with evil, making this so-called supreme flood dragon abandon the Green Luan Goddess and flee for his life. Then, just as he was about to escape, he would suddenly appear and let the kid experience despair.

He never expected that not only would he not run, but he would dare to counterattack, and even grab his tail.

How dare he?!

But at that moment.

He saw Li Mo take out a hammer.

Hmm?

Did this kid think that tiny hammer, smaller than his own teeth, could do anything to him?

At least he had some backbone...

"Eighty."

Right, what was this kid chanting?

Was it a martial arts move?
