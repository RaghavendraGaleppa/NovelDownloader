# Chapter 44: One Punch to Defeat the Enemy (Please Keep Reading!)

At this moment, Chu Ning's first thought was to immediately activate the defensive talisman in his hand.  

However, the stabbing pain in his head made it impossible for him to channel even the slightest bit of magic power. He couldn't even perform the simplest activation of a talisman.  

All he could do was watch helplessly as the ice blades struck his body.  

Qi Chongmao's voice, accompanied by these ice blades, reached him once more.  

"It's quite an honor for you to force me to expend so much energy to use a secret technique. If it weren't for fear of drawing attention with too much commotion, given my cultivation at the sixth level of Qi Refinement..."  

Qi Chongmao's words abruptly stopped, his eyes filled with astonishment.  

Because he saw that after the ice blades struck Chu Ning's body, the latter's magical energy remained completely unharmed!  

"You... a body cultivator?"  

Immortal Skin!  

At this moment, Chu Ning wasn't channeling magic power, but the Immortal Skin from the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art activated automatically.  

Chu Ning was overjoyed.  

Because he realized that, right then, the stabbing pain in his head had greatly diminished—whether it was because the opponent's secret technique had worn off or due to the effect of the Immortal Skin.  

More importantly, he could now channel magic power again!  

"Earth Armor Talisman!"  

Without hesitation, Chu Ning activated the talisman he had been holding in his hand, and a faint yellow magical barrier immediately enveloped his body.  

This was a mid-grade primary defensive talisman he had specifically asked Qiu Shunyi to purchase for him!  

Almost simultaneously, several more ice blades flew toward him.  

Qi Chongmao, seeing that his first attack had failed, launched another spell.  

However, with the Earth Armor Talisman activated, Chu Ning paid no heed.  

While his opponent was casting the spell, Chu Ning instantly unleashed a Thorny Vine Technique.  

The ice blades struck the yellow barrier and were completely blocked.  

Meanwhile, the eight ironvine tendrils Chu Ning summoned surged wildly toward Qi Chongmao.  

"Fifth level of Qi Refinement? Instant spellcasting?"  

This scene left Qi Chongmao, whose face had paled slightly after using his secret technique, momentarily stunned.  

He considered using basic spells to counter the ironvines, but his proficiency in wood-element spells was far inferior to Chu Ning's, who had only been practicing for a year.  

Qi Chongmao only managed to control six of the ironvines.  

Five of them tangled with Chu Ning's vines, while the sixth shot toward Chu Ning himself.  

Clearly, realizing he couldn't block all of Chu Ning's vines, Qi Chongmao attempted to bind Chu Ning as well.  

However, to Qi Chongmao's surprise—  

The remaining three ironvines under Chu Ning's control firmly wrapped around him.  

Meanwhile, the vine aimed at Chu Ning was blocked by a large black wooden sword Chu Ning summoned.  

The vine tightly bound the sword, which then fell to the ground.  

Seeing that he was ensnared by the Thorny Vine Technique while Chu Ning remained free, Qi Chongmao's expression shifted slightly.  

His reaction was swift—he activated a defensive talisman similar to a Body Protection Talisman.  

Instantly, a white protective barrier enveloped him.  

At the same time, Qi Chongmao cast another spell, forming a vine-like armor around his body—the Vine Armor Technique, commonly used by wood-element cultivators in the sect.  

With two layers of protection now in place, Qi Chongmao felt slightly more at ease. He glanced at Chu Ning with a hint of mockery in his eyes, as if to say:  

"Defensive talismans? I have them too."  

Chu Ning ignored the look entirely.  

Instead, he quickly activated all the remaining talismans he had prepared—six in total—sending six streaks of golden light shooting toward Qi Chongmao in succession!  

"Golden Sword Talismans?"  

Qi Chongmao was slightly surprised to see Chu Ning use so many talismans at once, but he wasn't overly alarmed. He focused on channeling his magic power to maintain his protective barrier.  

Even with the same Vine Armor Technique, the strength varied depending on the cultivator's level.  

At the sixth level of Qi Refinement, his vine armor barrier was naturally formidable, especially with an additional talisman barrier on top.  

Qi Chongmao was confident that even six Golden Sword Talismans would, at most, break through his outer barrier without harming him.  

After that, it would be his turn to deal with Chu Ning!  

With this thought, Qi Chongmao couldn't help but glance at Chu Ning again.  

To his surprise, Chu Ning activated another talisman—this time, a Fleetfoot Talisman.  

"Trying to escape?"  

Qi Chongmao's expression darkened slightly, though he didn't dare drop his defenses yet. He resolved inwardly not to let Chu Ning get away.  

But to his astonishment, after activating the Fleetfoot Talisman, Chu Ning didn't flee.  

Instead, his figure blurred as he shot toward Qi Chongmao, following closely behind the six talisman spells.  

"Thud! Thud! Thud!"  

The talisman spells struck Qi Chongmao's protective barrier one after another.  

After three impacts, the outermost pale yellow barrier shattered and vanished.  

"Wait—not all of them are Golden Sword Talismans! One of them is a Golden Light Talisman!"  

Qi Chongmao finally realized his mistake.  

Though the names differed by only a single character, the Golden Light Talisman was a genuine mid-grade primary offensive talisman!  

By the time he realized this, the remaining spells had already struck his Vine Armor barrier unimpeded.  

"Snap!"  

The barrier couldn't withstand the assault and shattered completely.  

In the next instant, Chu Ning appeared right before Qi Chongmao's eyes.  

When he saw Chu Ning charging at him with a raised fist, Qi Chongmao was momentarily stunned.  

Then, his already pale face from using the secret technique turned deathly white!  

Because at that moment, he felt an overwhelming pressure—one that carried the unmistakable threat of death.  

Trapped by the Thorny Vine Technique, he couldn't dodge. Attempting to gather magic power for another defense was impossible—there simply wasn't enough time.  

"Boom!"  

Chu Ning's fist slammed into Qi Chongmao's body, unleashing a surge of immense magical power infused with natural spiritual energy.  

This was Chu Ning's newly acquired innate divine ability—Heavenly Fist!  

The sheer destructive force left Qi Chongmao no time for further thoughts. The light in his eyes extinguished instantly.  

"How... is this possible...?"  

This was Qi Chongmao's final thought before collapsing.  

He had believed he was well-prepared, even resorting to a secret technique.  

Yet he never imagined that Chu Ning, a mere new disciple, possessed such formidable abilities.  

"Crack!"  

The sound of bones breaking echoed from Qi Chongmao's body.  

Sensing that all signs of life had vanished from Qi Chongmao, Chu Ning exhaled softly.  

Without wasting time, he quickly searched Qi Chongmao's body.  

Given the cultivation and methods Qi Chongmao had displayed, Chu Ning was certain he would have a storage pouch.  

His assumption proved correct—soon, he retrieved a storage pouch from Qi Chongmao's robes.  

Swiftly forming a hand seal, Chu Ning dispelled the Thorny Vine Technique.  

Then, without hesitation, he cast several Fireball Spells, reducing Qi Chongmao's corpse to ashes.
