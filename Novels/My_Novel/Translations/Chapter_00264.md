# Chapter 264: Pure Qi Protects the Body, All Impurities Disperse

At noon, rumors spread that the Black-Faced Bat King, due to his cultivation of unorthodox martial arts, feared the scorching sun. Walking under the sun would cause his entire body to itch unbearably and leave him weak. Seizing this rare opportunity, the wandering martial artists within the Xiu City Luo Clan entered the forest in groups to search.

The wandering martial artists searched in pairs and trios, wielding sabers, spears, staves, and various unique weapons. They ventured deep into the forest, masking their tracks. Li Xian and Luo Feiyan also joined the search, but they entered the forest from a different side slightly later. Luo Feiyan held a map, compared it to the terrain, and chose a direction, saying, "This villain must have fled this way."

She held a noble status, having no prior dealings with such vicious matters, so how could she know how to track a criminal? Her random commands were purely based on assumption and would surely be useless.

Li Xian pondered:

"This girl is arrogant and blindly overconfident. Why argue with her? I'll endure her for now and let her try. Once she figures out the situation, I'll provoke her to get the map." He said nothing and honestly helped clear the path by chopping trees, searching the mountain for the贼. After half an hour, there was no sign of the Black-Faced Bat King.

Luo Feiyan's forehead was beaded with fragrant sweat, and her clothes were slightly damp. Her boots were stuffy, and her feet were moist with sweat, making her extremely uncomfortable. She gently rubbed her ankle, wanting to take off her boots to cool down, but seeing Li Xian and another wandering martial artist, she abandoned the thought. Wiping the sweat from her forehead with a handkerchief, she couldn't help but feel annoyed.

She had been pampered since childhood, and although her martial arts realm was decent, she relied on her great talent and didn't practice martial arts very diligently.

Now that she had personally been searching for half an hour, she was already feeling agitated. It wasn't that she feared the Black-Faced Bat King, but rather that she couldn't achieve success quickly and decisively, which frustrated her pride.

Seeing the time was ripe, Li Xian sighed and said, "What a pity, what a pity."

Luo Feiyan frowned and asked, "What's a pity?"

Li Xian said, "It's a pity that even if we search like this for ten days or half a month, we might not necessarily encounter the Black-Faced Bat King."

Luo Feiyan said, "What did you say? Hmph, you little servant, daydreaming all day. Do you have some brilliant idea?" Her words were sharp and merciless. During the search, the martial artists beside her had repeatedly偷 glanced at her, which only increased her disgust. She felt extremely uncomfortable just having a nominal connection with these people. In this state of mind, hearing Li Xian's disrespectful words, she was naturally very angry.

Li Xian said, "If you give me the map to look at, I guarantee we'll meet the Black-Faced Bat King tonight."

Luo Feiyan sneered, "Do you really think you're so smart?"

Li Xian said, "Why don't we make a bet? If we don't meet him, you can kill or slice me as you wish." He thought to himself, "I'll boast first to get the map. Then I'll just slip away. What can you do about it?"

He suddenly secretly cursed himself, "I'm getting used to just slipping away."

Li Xian then said, "As for if we do meet... you'll let me have a kiss, how about that?" Although he saw that Luo Feiyan was indeed beautiful, he had no real intention. This remark was purely due to his flirtatious nature, and he loved to talk sweetly. Moreover, he intended to provoke Luo Feiyan.

Luo Feiyan thought, "This guy's face is dark and muddy, truly disgusting. But he seems confident, why not give it a try? If we find the Black-Faced Bat King, hmph, wanting a kiss from me, he is far from worthy. What's the harm in humoring him? If we don't find him, I'll take the opportunity to teach him a lesson." She looked at him with contempt and said, "Very well then, let me see what you can do."

She tossed the map over.

Li Xian carefully browsed the map. He saw a lake, with a small path extending beside it. He had bathed in the lake last night and, after sitting and practicing the "Five Viscera Transporting Turbidity" internally, had walked along this very path...

"Ah! No wonder I missed the Black-Faced Bat King. The man who went ahead was attacked and had his blood sucked dry, but I didn't see any trace of him."

It turned out that the small path extended for several miles. Next to it was a pitch-black cave, which was very well hidden. After the Black-Faced Bat King sucked blood last night, he must have hidden here. Li Xian, being new to the area and in a hurry, had passed by the cave without knowing it, thus missing the Black-Faced Bat King.

"The Black-Faced Bat King hid here last night. Now a day has passed, and he is active at night and rests during the day. He shouldn't have gone far."

Putting himself in the other's shoes: "The Black-Faced Bat King has no map. He is in the forest, obscured by the trees. If I were him, standing at this方位, I would first flee this way, then that way..."

The major and minor paths in the forest, the thousands and hundreds of trails, appeared in his mind. Crisscrossing, winding and meandering.

He continuously simulated in his mind. He finalized a few locations and then found a nearby route to approach them. In this way, he passed by several hidden hiding places one after another. Although he didn't run into the Black-Faced Bat King head-on, he faintly saw traces of wild rabbits and wild boar carcasses, indicating the Bat King had passed by nearby in his frantic escape.

Li Xian was extremely skilled at hunting.

He treated the Black-Faced Bat King as prey, searching for traces, speculating on his motives, and predicting his方位. He was also proficient in Feng Shui and geomancy, applying many miscellaneous skills together. Observing the mountains and surveying the land, visiting trees and asking grasses, his knowledge of miscellaneous arts was profound. Compared to figures like Wen Caishang, he was naturally inferior. But among his peers, few young heroes possessed such cultivation.

Luo Feiyan originally looked down on Li Xian very much, but seeing him frown in deep thought, his eyes profound, even though his face was dark and black, he exuded a different kind of charm. The knowledge he occasionally revealed was very methodical and unlike a typical wandering martial artist.

After following him for half an hour with great effectiveness, they were able to find the trail of the Black-Faced Bat King. While feeling pleasantly surprised, she couldn't help but look at Li Xian with slightly new eyes.

Luo Feiyan curiously said, "Hey, what's your name?"

Li Xian said, "Hua Manlou."

Luo Feiyan sneered and said, "That doesn't match you at all. You're more like 'Hei Manlian' (Black Full Face)."

Li Xian didn't mind at all and smiled, "And what's your name?" Luo Feiyan said, "Hua Feiyan." She was suddenly asked and almost said her real name. In her haste, she took the "Hua" from "Hua Manlou" as her surname.

Li Xian teased in his heart, "I think you're Luo Feiyan, trying to hide your identity as a member of the Luo Clan." He found it amusing and joked, "It seems we share the same surname. The surname Hua is quite rare in the world, truly extremely rare. We must have a great fate. It's possible that if we trace back, we might be cousins or close siblings!"

Luo Feiyan said with disgust, "Who wants to have a fate with you? Ridiculous, are you worthy?"

After walking for a while, Luo Feiyan said, "That darkness on your face, is it natural?" Li Xian sighed, "My mother said this full face of filth is a congenital birthmark. It can only be resolved when I meet the person I love."

Luo Feiyan didn't continue the conversation, feeling strongly that this man was flirtatious and unreliable. Just a few words with him always led to nonsense.

Li Xian suddenly looked serious. He slowed his steps and lightened his movements. He smelled a faint scent of blood. Consulting the map, he found there was a cave nearby. Li Xian quietly approached and looked at the cave, thinking the Black-Faced Bat King must be inside. He must not alert him. So he retreated and hid in a tree, using the canopy and leaves for cover.

Luo Feiyan's heart tightened as she too smelled the stench of blood, knowing they might have found the Black-Faced Bat King's hiding place. Facing a great enemy, she couldn't help but feel nervous. She turned her head and saw that Li Xian had already hidden himself, first ensuring his own safety, then gesturing to her to come over and hide.

This was understandable. However, Luo Feiyan felt very annoyed. Her beauty was such that both inside and outside the clan, everyone catered to her, cherished her, and considered her feelings. If she furrowed her brow, many men would be heartbroken and sleepless. Moreover, this operation to eliminate the Black-Faced Bat King was entirely due to her 'Golden Hairpin' reputation that it had such a grand scale. This was the first time she had seen such a man, and she cursed in her heart, "Coward, unworthy of being a man!" She stepped with her "Embroidered Dream Light Silk Step" and hid beside him.

Li Xian said, "The Black-Faced Bat King is most likely hiding here. How do you intend to show your gratitude? Give me a kiss?"

Luo Feiyan cursed, "Dream on!"

Li Xian smiled, "Alright, going back on your word. That's fine, I'm used to being hurt by women."

Luo Feiyan mocked, "With your looks, which woman would pay attention to you? You're self-indulgent and extremely sordid." Li Xian smiled, "Your mouth is really vicious. Now you want to kiss me, but I don't dare. I'm afraid of being poisoned."

Luo Feiyan secretly circulated her internal Qi, adjusted her breathing, and glared fiercely at Li Xian. She suddenly thought, "Why am I talking to this dirty kid? He must be extremely pleased that he can talk to me." But looking closely at Li Xian's features, aside from his dark and muddy face, he was actually quite handsome.

Luo Feiyan said, "You say this Black-Faced Bat King is hiding in the cave. Should we go in and catch him?"

Li Xian said, "Not advisable. The cave is pitch black, which gives him a huge advantage. We need to find a way to force him out." He immediately thought of burning grass and wood, blowing black smoke into the cave to force the Black-Faced Bat King out. But the black smoke would rise high and attract attention.

He immediately devised another plan. He opened the map and thought of a strategy. He suddenly saw that the map showed several streams around, faintly connected to the cave. This method of 'Searching the Mountain and Touching the Veins' was a geomantic technique taught by Wen Caishang. Li Xian had learned a little, and now it came in handy.

He immediately determined that there was a hidden river inside the cave, and the scale of the hidden river was not large. After emerging to the surface, it turned into a gurgling stream.

"I once learned Feng Shui and geomancy from Madam Wen. Perhaps I can use some layout to block the surrounding streams, causing the hidden river in the cave to overflow. Seeing this situation, he would surely be surprised and naturally leave the cave."

Li Xian immediately got to work.

This was not really difficult. Li Xian's Feng Shui and geomancy could only be considered slightly proficient. He knew how to use the trend of the mountains to figure out the direction of the water veins.

He said, "You two stay here and keep quiet." Holding the map, he used his lightness technique and left. Luo Feiyan was surprised: "Such excellent lightness technique! I underestimated him!"

She increasingly felt that Li Xian was no ordinary person. The Black-Faced Bat King had been committing evil for a long time, fleeing for many days, and had killed several people in the process, making him very difficult to deal with. Li Xian had only arrived today and already displayed the supreme art of tracking, finding the hiding cave along the way. Now he was revealing an outstanding lightness technique.

She murmured, "I'll follow him and see what strange things this person is up to! If he's a villain, hmph, I won't let him off either." Extremely curious, she said to the wandering martial artist, "You stay here and guard. If there's any situation, light a smoke signal. I'll go help."

Her figure drifted, like smoke and silk flying. With the tip of her foot lightly touching the leaves, she could leap several zhangs. Although the "Embroidered Dream Light Silk Step" was a lower-tier lightness technique, it had its own unique aspects.

She caught up in no time.

Li Xian said, "Why did you follow me?" Luo Feiyan frowned and said, "I need to see what strange things you're doing."

Li Xian thought, "It's still early. The Black-Faced Bat King probably wouldn't dare leave the cave. If he does leave, wouldn't that be perfect, saving me the effort." So he said no more.

The cave had a hidden river connected to four small streams. Li Xian found them one by one and found ways to block them.

He immediately ran back to the outside of the cave and waited quietly.

The Black-Faced Bat King was sitting quietly in the cave, resting and digesting the beast blood in his stomach. He practiced unorthodox martial arts, was addicted to sucking blood, and his appearance had gradually changed, becoming ferocious and terrifying.

Suddenly, he smelled a faint water vapor.

He looked down and saw the soil had become soft. When he stepped on it, it felt like stepping in water. He thought, "Is this place going to be flooded? How can I stay here? I'm only at the second level of the Martial Dao. When I encounter water, it's dangerous. I need to leave quickly!"

At this time, noon had passed. Although the sunlight was still strong, it was no longer scorching. The Black-Faced Bat King walked out of the cave entrance. The sunlight shone on him, and he couldn't help but squint his eyes and raise his hand to shield himself. His skin was very dark, with fine fuzz. Under the sunlight, the fuzz curled and bent.

Fine red rashes appeared on his skin. He bared his teeth and scratched vigorously, quickly seeking shelter under the shade of a tree.

This scene was seen by Li Xian, who secretly said, "He's really here. This person is so afraid of water, he must also be at the second level of the Martial Dao! In terms of cultivation, he is superior to me. I haven't been practicing for long, so there's really nothing I can do. But in terms of actual strength, it's hard to tell just from the realm." Li Xian took him very seriously, but didn't belittle himself.

He focused his attention and observed again. Seeing his short stature, sharp teeth, and dark face.

Luo Feiyan's heart tightened, and she said, "Let's attack together!"

Li Xian reasoned internally: "The strength of this Black-Faced Bat King is unknown for now. Why not let Luo Feiyan test him first? This person is from the Luo Clan. If she were to obtain the 'Human Yellow', she would also be a potential enemy." He smiled and said, "Are you asking for my help? First fulfill your promise, give me three kisses, how about that?"

Luo Feiyan was truly angry and said, "Dream on! Asking for your help is giving you face. Since you don't appreciate kindness, then just watch carefully."

If not for the great enemy being present, she would have struck him down first.

Although her experience was shallow, she was not foolish. She was very skilled in palm techniques, having mastered two sets of palm techniques to perfection: the "Lower Tier Ethereal Dream Shadow Palm" and the "Basic Luo Clan Soft Palm".

The Black-Faced Bat King took advantage of the shade for a moment, his figure flashing, wanting to find another cave to hide in. Suddenly, he heard the sound of wind approaching, and a palm struck suddenly. He laughed, "Another one who doesn't fear death." He turned around and returned a palm. The two palms met, and a muffled sound of "bang" was heard. The internal Qi of both was powerful and overflowed. The two paused in mid-air, and the surrounding trees, entangled by the strong wind, swayed left and right.

The bushes and weeds were all pressed flat.

Luo Feiyan let out a cold snort. As expected of a proud daughter of a great clan, she changed her palm into a finger, shooting out golden Qi rays. This move was called "Qi Piercing Finger," an extremely powerful piercing martial art. The Black-Faced Bat King was startled and didn't dare to be careless. He retracted his head and hands, hiding inside a black cloak.

The Qi ray hit the cloak and was bounced off, striking a large tree. The tree trunk 'banged' and exploded, breaking in half. Luo Feiyan frowned tightly, already feeling that this person's strength was very strong, and there might be a fierce battle. Several palms struck the black cloak, each palm force was quite formidable.

Her posture was elegant. When she raised and struck her palms, she looked as if she were dancing gracefully. But this cloak had a great mystery, like a tough and flexible cotton ball. No matter how she struck, it was hard to be effective.

The Black-Faced Bat King laughed, "What a fine little lady, coming to find this young master alone, you've got guts! Even if I let you beat me to death, you still can't do anything to me. I won't even fight back, just go ahead." He curled up into the cloak, his whole body shrinking into a ball.

Luo Feiyan cursed, "Big talk!" She exerted her strength and attacked. Several sets of palm techniques were executed in succession: Ethereal Dream Shadow Palm, Luo Clan Soft Palm, Hongyan Three-Kill Palm...

Her internal Qi was abundant, light and ethereal, yet hiding immense power. It was like the silk from Xiu City, exquisite and light, yet worth a thousand gold, enough to make people bow down. The application of the Martial Dao is often closely related to the practitioner's feelings and understanding.

In terms of internal Qi alone, Luo Feiyan was actually superior. She struck several palms in a row, but none could harm the Black-Faced Bat King. The cloak was extremely tough and slippery. When she struck, she clearly hit the Black-Faced Bat King, but for some reason, she couldn't land a solid blow.

It turned out...

This black cloak was mysterious, yet not so mysterious.

The cloak was entirely black, made from bat fur mixed with the skin of a poisonous eel. The outside was rough and sticky, while the inside was very smooth. Luo Feiyan's palm force was strong. When it hit the cloak, it touched the bat fur. The rough surface of the cloak faintly adhered to Luo Feiyan's palm. At this time, the inside of the cloak was slippery. The Black-Faced Bat King only needed to slightly move the cloak, and naturally her palm force would slide away.

The Black-Faced Bat King cackled with laughter. Luo Feiyan was extremely frustrated. She thought, "If you stand still and I still can't catch you, wouldn't I lose all face?" She vaguely guessed the Black-Faced Bat King's method. She touched her skirt with both hands and struck again. Her palm speed was incredibly fast, but it was still difficult to harm the Black-Faced Bat King.

Li Xian said, "Ah, such a powerful move!" He was referring to Luo Feiyan's useless palm techniques.

This Luo Feiyan lived up to her reputation; her strength was very strong. When she touched her skirt with both hands just now, she was secretly吸夹ing the silk threads of her dress into her palm. After that, every time she struck and retracted her palm, it was like threading a needle. It seemed like a useless effort, but she was actually sewing the cloak. She was sewing the cloak onto the Black-Faced Bat King's skin.

If she succeeded, the Black-Faced Bat King would become a silkworm cocoon, unable to move his hands and feet, trapped inside the black cloak, suffering a miserable fate. Li Xian thought, "If this technique sewed up a person's five orifices, sewed up a person's acupoints... without knowing it, they would be unable to move, unable to distinguish their hands and feet!"

In reality, very few people in the Luo Clan had this ability. The martial arts realm was one factor, but it also required excellent martial aptitude and long-term tempering. There was a very deep principle involved. One had to first master the 'Luo Clan Heart Method' and 'Luo Clan Golden Rules'. Both of these were accessible to Luo Clan descendants, and they were memorized and mastered from a young age. The essentials of many of the Luo Clan's martial arts were hidden within the family rules.

The Luo Clan Heart Method cultivated character, and the Luo Clan Golden Rules constrained habits. Both were used to shape them from a young age, both rectifying their character and laying a solid foundation. Those with outstanding character, knowledge, and aptitude were given further cultivation and exposed to the family's businesses, needing to master accounting. And within "accounting," the methods of manipulating Qi were hidden.

Then they practiced the two martial arts, "Embroidered Body Skill" and "Coiling Silk Hand". The Embroidered Body Skill is a body-nourishing martial art, using slight vibrations of the body to slightly loosen and flow the needles and threads on one's clothes. The Coiling Silk Hand is the technique of "threading" and "manipulating" the threads.

In this way, the "Luo Clan Heart Method," "Luo Clan Golden Rules," "Embroidered Body Skill," "Coiling Silk Hand"... and the methods of accounting. The combination of these many principles revealed such a technique. It was no longer achievable by a single martial art. The Luo Clan's cultivation of younger generations was indeed very methodical. Even if a outsider happened to glimpse one or two of these martial arts, how could they threaten the Luo Clan?

Li Xian secretly nodded, thinking it was good that he hadn't underestimated Luo Feiyan. Seeing the Black-Faced Bat King still not moving, and Luo Feiyan repeatedly delivering palms, the silk threads of her skirt had already diminished by half.

This technique was called "Delivering the Garment".

Silk was夹ed in the palm, and the palms were delivered at extreme speed. By the time the palm technique was finished, the opponent's clothes would be焕然一新 (brand new). And even more... it could completely replace one's own clothes with the opponent's.

Of course... if the "Needle and Thread" technique was actually used, it would be threading through the opponent's flesh and blood. Luo Feiyan delivered two more palms, about to succeed.

The Black-Faced Bat King suddenly threw off his cloak, blood flowing everywhere. Just now, the silk threads had passed through the cloak, sewing his skin and flesh, piercing his bones. It was extremely厉害. However, he was an extremely ruthless character. He forcefully pulled the threads, causing his skin to tear and flesh to split. From somewhere, he threw out a large skeleton.

Luo Feiyan was startled and struck the skeleton with both palms. The skeleton actually moved and instantly grabbed Luo Feiyan's hands.

It turned out...

The Black-Faced Bat King's weapon was a carefully crafted skeleton! It was identical to his own figure. Usually, it was fitted to his body, and then he wore thick clothes. No one could tell.

He was extremely skilled at provoking with words, then curling up in his cloak. When his opponent became angry and frustrated, and their attacks became more and more fierce, he would suddenly open the cloak and throw out the skeleton attached to his body.

Taking the opponent by surprise, the skeleton would close in, ensuring a one-hit victory! The skeleton grabbed Luo Feiyan's hands with immense strength, instantly making her hands red and swollen! The Black-Faced Bat King was bleeding profusely, and although he was seriously injured, this move had finally worked.

He tapped the back of the skeleton's heel with his toe. The skeleton immediately kicked. Luo Feiyan's hands were grabbed by the skeleton. She kicked her skirt, wrapping it around the skeleton's leg. But at the same time, the Black-Faced Bat King's two palms were already striking.

Luo Feiyan's face turned pale. She couldn't break free. The Black-Faced Bat King's skeleton weapon was incredibly诡异, and also deadly. It was as if she was suddenly facing two people, giving her the feeling that two fists were no match for four hands.

She executed "Embroidered Body Skill" and "Luo Garment Body Turning Skill"... The Embroidered Body Skill used slight vibrations of the body, combined with the special sewing technique of the clothes she wore. This made the clothes seem unchanged, but the needles and threads inside were flowing like water.

The Luo Garment Body Turning Skill... was even more a life-saving martial art. It was greatly related to "Solidifying Blood and Closing Apertures," and was "Moving Blood and Overflowing Qi." Internal Qi seeped out from the skin, flowed through the silk threads of the entire outfit, and scattered the silk threads of her clothes, weaving them around her body like a dense net, protecting her whole body.

Li Xian understood: "This Luo Clan martial art... is closely related to the clothes one wears!" Seeing Luo Feiyan's figure revealed, he couldn't help but find it amusing: "Wouldn't the Luo Clan descendants, after surviving life-and-death battles, always have their clothes completely ruined?"

The Black-Faced Bat King knew Luo Feiyan was extremely powerful. The moment he struck, his palms touched the silk threads and were immediately刮 covered in bloodstains. If he had struck forcefully, his palms would have been削 cut into eighteen pieces.

The Black-Faced Bat King said coldly, "Little lady, it's too late to regret now. For every drop of blood I lose, you must make it up!" A sweet taste in his throat, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

The blood splashed onto the skeleton. It made a "sizzling" sound and evaporated into blood mist. Faintly, it seemed to grow flesh and blood.

This was the Dao of Sorcery · Blood Flesh Growth!

Li Xian pondered: "When I was with Madam Wen before, for experts of this level, they were often slain by Madam before they could even make a move. Or they had their hands and feet cut off, wailing miserably... Now that I'm facing it personally, the number and strangeness of the techniques... truly opens my eyes!!"

The Black-Faced Bat King spat three mouthfuls of blood mist. The first mouthful of blood mist... the skeleton grew flesh. The second mouthful of blood mist... dissolved the silk threads. The third mouthful of blood mist... stuck to human skin and flesh, adhered to the skin, like wrapping a silkworm cocoon!

The first blood mist was the Dao of Sorcery · Blood Flesh Growth. The second and third blood mist... were extremely powerful martial arts.

They complemented each other! Extremely powerful.

Luo Feiyan saw the blood mist spreading and was already out of ideas. Her arms were covered in blood cocoons, and in an instant, they became numb and cold... The blood cocoons seeped into the subcutaneous layer. If she didn't驱赶 them quickly, the blood cocoons would spread through her muscles, flesh, bones, and meridians... her hands would be completely废了!

Luo Feiyan's beautiful face turned pale. The Luo Clan's martial arts all relied on their exquisite hands. If her hands were废ed, her martial arts prospects would be over. Suddenly at this moment...

A white mist drifted over, blowing through the blood mist, and in an instant, it was all dispersed! Luo Feiyan's numb hands suddenly felt a cool sensation.

By the time she came to her senses, Li Xian was already behind her. His head was topped with scattered flowers, white mist缠身, his glabella was妖 red, and all impurities could not侵 him.

The胭脂 and turbid powder on his face naturally散退 unintentionally.
