Chapter 293: Warm Winter Sun, Hidden Dragon List Released

The sky was just beginning to lighten as dawn approached. Rays of light pierced through gaps in the clouds, illuminating the magnificent newly built city.

The massive city gates stood wide open, swallowing and spewing forth a dragon-like stream of carriages and horses.

Green Wood City was a dividing line in the Southern Border, the first great human city to leave the depths of the Demon Race's territory. Upon arriving here, one had entered the sphere of influence of the Southern Pass.

Above the gates that breathed in and out countless people hung a massive beast's head—the head of a Fourth Rank Demon King, personally beheaded by the King of the South. Despite the unknown number of years that had passed, it remained as vivid as ever.

Within the city, flat-roofed buildings in the style of the Great Yu Dynasty and the corner towers common to the Southern Border were interlocked like the teeth of a dragon. On the streets, people wore long robes and skirts, while others wore more unrestrained clothing.

The cultural atmosphere of two different regions was blended together in this city, creating a strange yet harmonious fusion.

Inside a carriage amidst the flow of traffic.

"We've finally returned to the territory of the human race."

Behind the carriage curtain, Li Mo's expression was relaxed and cheerful, as if a heavy burden had been lifted.

Green Wood City couldn't be considered prosperous; it couldn't even compare to Ziyang Prefecture City, let alone the Cloud Province.

Yet, it gave him a sense of bustling human life that felt incredibly familiar.

"Ice Cube, want some?"

"what?"

Ying Bing, who was drinking tea, raised her eyes and followed his gaze.

By the roadside, an old man sat in front of a cart, dipping a bamboo stick into the syrup in a pot and painting on a stone slab. As he painted, he told vivid stories, attracting a crowd of children.

Sugar painting?

Isn't that something only children eat...

"I want some."

"Alright, then I'll paint one for you too."

Li Mo's smile instantly became bright and clear.

He exchanged a few words with the old sugar painter. When he pulled out a gold bean, the old man's cloudy eyes instantly cleared up, declaring that he could tell Li Mo was a master craftsman.

Sugar painting wasn't difficult; one just had to work quickly so the syrup didn't solidify.

In no time, a sugar figure roughly the size of a large-headed doll was born. Bolstered by Little Li's painting skills, it was incredibly lifelike.

"Wow, Gege (Big Brother), you paint so well."

"Is this a self-portrait?"

"Grandpa Qi only knows how to paint rabbits and tigers; we're tired of seeing them."

The children surrounded Li Mo, clamoring for him to make a few more different sugar figures.

The stall owner's grandson, a sturdy-looking boy who was the king of the local kids, stood with his hands on his hips and said defiantly, "My grandpa is the best. Let's see you paint several different kinds if you're so capable."

Little Li handed the large-headed doll made of sugar into the carriage and raised an eyebrow.

Here it comes. The moment you return to a human city, you run into such a classic scenario.

The disdain and contempt of a minor antagonist!

So, what comes next goes without saying, right?

It was a good thing Senior Brother Ouyang wasn't here; the things he painted definitely weren't for children's eyes.

Little Li's mouth curled into a smirk.

"Today, I'll show you what a true Painting Saint looks like!"

And so.

Two quarter-hours later.

"Wow, that big snake is so fierce, what kind of demon beast is it?"

"Hmph, haven't you seen it before? That's a Roaring Flood Dragon."

"And this one?"

"This is the Shrimp-headed Man."

"Wow, Big Brother, you paint so realistically, have you seen them all?"

"More than just seen."

Little Li stood with his hands on his hips, proudly declaring, "I've even been one! Have you guys heard of the Sea Selection?"

The winter sun seemed to grow a little warmer.

The children all held various sugar paintings in their hands, eating while listening to the story. Even the sturdy little boy was won over, voluntarily accepting Little Li as his leader.

A new king of the children was born on this street!

Ying Bing's long legs were crossed. Her jade-like face was as cold as a goddess in the snow, yet she gently took a bite of the large-headed doll made of sugar.

It was sweet.

***

The scene of the少年 (youth) showing off his prowess before a crowd of children, commanding the situation, was reflected in her eyes.

Her gaze was like a warm winter sun.

After bidding farewell to the group of little ones, the carriage slowly started moving again.

As the two were looking for an inn, they saw a crowd gathered in the distance, three layers deep, blocking the way so the carriage couldn't get through.

"The 'Nine Heavens Ten Earths风云 List' is out again. It's a pity there's no Dragon Gate here."

"It's good enough we have something to look at. Hmm... the Heaven List and the Earth List haven't changed much? That's to be expected... What about the Hidden Dragon List?"

"Here it comes!"

An officer walked through the crowd and posted the final sheet of the Hidden Dragon List onto the bulletin board.

The Heaven and Earth Lists rarely changed throughout the year, and even the Human List didn't change much.

Therefore, the most talked about was naturally the Hidden Dragon List.

For a moment, many commoners were astonished, and the sound of discussion rose on all sides.

"The changes are so huge?"

"Lord Zhong, the Young Marquis who guards our city, has shot up to sixty-fifth place? With him and General Qu leading the troops here in Green Wood City, we can rest easy."

"If the Young Marquis is within a military formation, his strength is even greater. He can fight above his level without issue; this ranking still seems a bit low."

"Wait."

The commoners whispered amongst themselves, showing great reverence for Zhong Zhenyue. After all, with his status, he could have stayed in the safe Southern Pass, but after returning from Cloud Province, he volunteered to come to Green Wood City.

"Zhong Zhenyue is also in Green Wood City?"

Little Li in the crowd heard a familiar name.

Not long after.

Several sheets of the Hidden Dragon List were posted. As they approached the top ten, the area suddenly fell silent.

"'Wife-supporting Fighting Soul' is eleventh? Ying Bing... tenth?!"

It was a long while before someone spoke in shock. It was like breaching a river dike; the crowd erupted in an uproar.

"They're only at the Divine Observation Realm, right? Even Fifth Realm Outer Scene experts wouldn't dare venture deep into the Southern Border casually."

"How on earth did they do it? What is a Celestial Jade?"

"Tsk tsk, the two of them together, slayed four Sixth Rank Disaster Beasts. It's already extremely difficult for someone at their level to fight two opponents, and they killed Disaster Beasts."

"If this record is true, then their ranking makes sense."

These two Hidden Dragons were simply too young.

Moreover, this was only their second time entering the Hidden Dragon List. Their first ranking was already exaggerated, and no one expected them to rise even further.

But this record was solid fact. Feiyi, Dafeng, Xiangliu, and Flip-River Crocodile—these were all extremely powerful Disaster Beast clans that had left behind many legends in the Nine Heavens Ten Earths during their heyday.

Fighting against superior numbers, they didn't let a single one escape, slaughtering them all.

"By the way, did you guys notice?"

"Notice what?"

"Li Mo and Ying Bing are on the list together, and their rankings rose together, sticking tightly."

"Is there no room for anyone else to get between them?"

"Incredible, Moon Sword Phoenix, you're in the top ten," Li Mo turned around and smiled.

"...... You're not bad either, Wife-supporting Fighting Soul."

"...."

Little Li's smile vanished.

So, he wasn't the Peerless Flood Dragon?

He'd made such a name for himself in the Southern Border, but they changed his nickname?! Damn it!

Little Li decided to leave this place that made him sad and find an inn to settle down first.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes, unable to help but眯 (squint) and ponder.

The Hidden Dragon List is out.

Will the Disaster Beasts' movements become even more aggressive?

At the same time.

In a tavern named 'Jia Wei'.

"Young Marquis, the list has been delivered for you."

In a private room on the second floor, Zhong Zhenyue rubbed his hands together. He didn't even look at the other lists, directly picking up the Hidden Dragon List.

He used to be very confident in himself.

But ever since he met Li Mo and Ying Bing, that bit of confidence was shattered to pieces.

So, knowing his shame, he strove to overcome it! He volunteered to come to Green Wood City to temper himself!

"This time, the gap between us should be a bit smaller, right....."
