# Chapter 124: Twin Flames and Wood, Qi Condensation Perfection

Following Little White's guidance for several miles, Chu Ning arrived at the foot of a mountain.

After carefully sensing the surroundings, Chu Ning curiously asked Little White, "Little White, the spiritual qi here is indeed denser, but not by much, is it?"

"Underground!" Little White transmitted through divine sense, then directly slipped out of Chu Ning's sleeve and led the way on the ground.

Chu Ning followed the little creature, first climbing halfway up the mountain to the other side. Then, they turned a corner and began descending along a not-too-steep stone wall. They entered a hollow concealed by the surrounding peaks.

As soon as he entered the hollow, Chu Ning felt a spiritual qi density entirely different from the outside.

"So, there's a hidden world among these mountains," Chu Ning looked up. The area was surrounded by tall peaks. If one could fly normally, this place would have been easily spotted from above. But with everyone currently restricted to walking, no one would intentionally climb to the mountain top just to check such a spot.

"Ying!" Little White urged.

Chu Ning continued to follow the little fellow, eventually entering the belly of another mountain peak. After walking a short distance, Chu Ning felt the surrounding temperature noticeably rise, becoming hotter the further they went. Fortunately, the heat was not unbearable. Chu Ning merely circulated his Azurewood Everspring Art once and immediately felt refreshed.

At this point, one person and one beast finally arrived in a mountain cave. Black sand, green trees, and red fruits interwove before Chu Ning's eyes. This small cave contained a large patch of spirit plants, numbering several dozens. Some of these spirit plants resembled cacti from Chu Ning's memories, yet they were taller than a person, growing on a stretch of black sand. Each plant bore five or six spirit fruits. The spirit fruits were entirely fiery red and about the size of a goose egg.

"Is this...Twin Flames and Wood Fruit?" Looking at these spirit fruits, Chu Ning was somewhat uncertain. He vaguely recalled seeing this type of spirit fruit in a jade slip before, but the jade slip mentioned that this fruit was almost extinct in the nearby immortal cultivation mountain ranges.

Therefore, Chu Ning hadn't paid complete attention at the time, and now he couldn't be entirely sure. Chu Ning slowly walked forward and observed them carefully.

"It really is the Twin Flames and Wood Fruit!" Chu Ning murmured softly, a hint of surprise in his voice. Legend had it that the Twin Flames and Wood Fruit could only grow in places where wood and fire attribute spiritual qi were extremely dense. They contained incredibly pure wood and fire attribute spiritual qi. Even more remarkably, the two attributes of spiritual qi were perfectly balanced. Whether consumed directly or used to refine pills, they were excellent medicinal ingredients.

However, ordinary cultivators, unless they cultivated dual wood and fire attribute techniques, could not consume them. If one could not simultaneously absorb both attributes of spiritual qi from the spirit medicine, they would instead be disturbed by the concentrated spiritual qi of the other attribute, easily leading to a loss of control over their spiritual power. Nevertheless, this type of spirit medicine was a treasure for cultivators with dual wood and fire spirit roots. Wood begets fire; these two attributes are inherently symbiotic, and disciples with dual wood and fire spirit roots often cultivated such techniques. If they could consume this spirit fruit, or pills refined from it, their cultivation would greatly advance.

These thoughts flashed through Chu Ning's mind as he pulled out a jade box. Although this spirit fruit was useless to him, as he only cultivated wood attribute techniques, how could he return empty-handed after entering a treasure mountain?

Chu Ning harvested all thirty-odd Twin Flames and Wood Fruits. At this moment, his gaze fell upon the young saplings next to several Twin Flames and Wood Fruit trees. These saplings, perhaps grown from fallen fruits, numbered about thirty to forty.

"Although the Twin Flames and Wood Fruit requires a high concentration of both wood and fire attribute spiritual qi, there might be suitable places outside. Even if I can't plant them, their value should still be considerable if I take them out." Thinking this, Chu Ning knelt down, intending to dig up all the saplings on the ground.

However, just as he crouched down, his expression suddenly changed. The next moment, Chu Ning straightened up, simultaneously activating his Startling Thunder Steps, flashing to the side. Almost simultaneously, two dark pincers emerged from beneath the black sand, snapping shut where Chu Ning had just stood. Immediately afterward, a demonic beast, primarily crimson red with two heads but a colorful belly, emerged from the black sand. It leaped up and lunged towards Chu Ning.

"A Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion?"

Chu Ning almost subconsciously held his breath, then immediately retrieved the mid-grade magical artifact, the Azure Light Pearl, from his storage bag. The next moment, one of the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion's heads spat out a crimson mist. However, as this crimson mist drifted towards Chu Ning, it was immediately isolated by an invisible spiritual qi barrier.

While once again activating Startling Thunder Steps to dodge, Chu Ning quickly retrieved several Clear Wind Talismans and Beast-Trapping Talismans from his storage bag. As the Clear Wind Talismans were activated, the crimson mist instantly dissipated. At the same time, Chu Ning activated another Beast-Trapping Talisman in his hand. A white spiritual power restraint landed on the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion's body. But in just an instant, the fire scorpion broke free.

Simultaneously, the fire scorpion's body rapidly swelled, becoming as large as a calf, perfectly blocking the cave entrance. Chu Ning consecutively unleashed several Azurewood Sword Arts, but these wood-attribute spells had little effect on the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion. As for the talismans in Chu Ning's hand, a high-grade Crimson Flame Fire Talisman would likely be even less effective against a fire-attribute demonic beast.

"Little White!" Chu Ning called out.

Little White, who had been watching the spectacle, immediately opened its mouth and spat out an ice-attribute spiritual column towards the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion. However, the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion was incredibly agile in the air, dodging the spell attack with a fierce lunge forward.

Looking at the rapidly approaching Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion, Chu Ning continued to hold his breath, while also flashing aside, once again dodging its large pincers. At the same time, he cursed inwardly, "Is this a Tier 1 high-grade demonic beast?" From the demonic beast's aura, it was indeed a Tier 1 high-grade demonic beast. But observing its defense and intelligence, Chu Ning absolutely refused to believe that this demonic beast was merely a Tier 1 high-grade.

As his figure flickered, Chu Ning's hand held a dagger-axe shaped magical artifact. It was the water-attribute offensive mid-grade magical artifact he had obtained from that Cultivation Hall disciple. Watching the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion lunge again, Chu Ning infused spiritual power into his right hand holding the short dagger-axe and thrust it forward. Immediately, a water-attribute spell condensed from the short dagger-axe. Then, at the moment the fire scorpion crashed into it, the spell struck the demonic beast. Instantly, a layer of white light appeared on the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion's body, and its crimson color weakened by a few points.

"Ying!" Just then, Little White, who had missed its "bite" earlier, let out an angry cry. It opened its mouth and spat out another white light. Because the scorpion had been hit by Chu Ning's water-attribute magical artifact, it couldn't leap up for a moment. The white light accurately landed on the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion's body, and instantly, a layer of ice encased the entire scorpion. Little White's spell had directly frozen the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion.

However, at this moment, a red glow surged on the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion's body, indicating it was about to break free from the ice. Chu Ning frowned at the sight. He was about to reach into his storage bag for a water-attribute mid-grade talisman, but a thought crossed his mind, and he stopped. "I don't know how long I'll be in this Spirit Domain, or what other dangers I'll encounter. It's best to conserve my high-grade talismans whenever possible. Using a mid-grade talisman to deal with this kind of demonic beast seems a bit too extravagant."

Instead of pulling out a talisman, Chu Ning's hand now held a dark black shield. He had always felt he might have developed some new attack method, but hadn't had a chance to try it. Today was a good opportunity.

"Little White, stop, let me!" Chu Ning stopped Little White, who was about to continue spitting ice spells. Then, with a Startling Thunder Step, he charged forward.

The Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion had just broken free from Little White's freezing spell. Seeing Chu Ning charge towards it, its two dark, almost purplish, large pincers immediately clamped down.

"Clang!"

The two pincers missed Chu Ning, but instead struck the dark black shield Chu Ning swung. The next moment, the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion was directly sent flying from its spot, crashing heavily against the rock wall. This heavy blow seemed to have completely stunned the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion. It simply rolled on the ground and didn't get up.

Seeing this, Chu Ning held the shield and charged again with Startling Thunder Steps. The Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion also noticed Chu Ning. As Chu Ning approached, its scorpion tail swept fiercely, lashing towards Chu Ning.

"Clang!"

It was almost identical to the previous scene: the scorpion tail struck heavily against the dark black shield. And the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion was once again sent flying, crashing heavily against the rock wall.

"Ying!" Watching Chu Ning's somewhat violent attacks, Little White, who was observing from the side, was somewhat astonished.

What followed was the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion being repeatedly knocked flying by Chu Ning's shield. After five hits, the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion was completely unable to move. Chu Ning then proceeded to repeatedly smash it on the ground with the shield. A moment later, the scorpion was completely motionless. Although the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion's exoskeleton was still intact, a faint trickle of red venom flowed from its mouth. Clearly, its internal organs had been completely damaged by Chu Ning's continuous impacts.

"Ying!" Only then did Little White walk over, its gaze fixed on Chu Ning.

"I told you, little fellow, to save your spiritual power," Chu Ning chuckled. Of course, he also had the thought of trying out his skills on this Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion. Before this, his Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art's offensive maneuvers primarily relied on Startling Thunder Steps and Heavenly Gang Fist. Chu Ning also wanted to see how effective his ordinary physical attacks would be without these secret arts. Now it seemed that as long as he had a suitable weapon to assist him, the power was equally impressive. If he could smash this Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion, with its incredibly tough defense, to death, then this move could certainly be used against other opponents.

He picked up the dark black magical artifact in his hand and examined it. It didn't seem damaged. Chu Ning then put it back into his storage bag. After that, he took out the dark black dagger he had kept as a trump card since obtaining it. With a flick of his hand, he chopped at the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion's pincers and tail, collecting the two most valuable parts of the demonic beast into his storage bag.

Chu Ning then used his divine sense to probe the black sand, confirming there were no other demonic beasts, before entering the area and digging up all the Twin Flames and Wood Fruit saplings. He carefully packed them into jade boxes and placed them in his storage bag.

"Ying!" At this moment, Little White barked at Chu Ning again.

"Go further in?" Hearing Little White's cry, Chu Ning looked at a dark, small cave continuing downwards ahead and hesitated slightly. However, after some thought, he continued into the cave. Since this cave contained a Tier 1 high-grade demonic beast, the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion, there shouldn't be any other demonic beasts, logically. The spiritual qi in this cave was already so dense that it could support the growth of the Twin Flames and Wood Fruit. Yet Little White said the spiritual qi inside was even denser, which piqued Chu Ning's curiosity slightly.

Of course, Chu Ning didn't dare to be careless. He first released his divine sense to probe. Then, he sent out his puppet bird to fly in ahead. To Chu Ning's regret, this cave entrance extended downwards at an incline for over 100 *zhang*, exceeding the range of his divine sense. Even the puppet bird couldn't reach the end. After hesitating for a moment, Chu Ning let the puppet bird continue to scout ahead, then slowly walked down the passage.

After walking about fifty *zhang*, the scene detected by the puppet bird on Chu Ning's magical mirror changed slightly. The end of the passage was actually a small cave only five *zhang* in size. The next moment, what made Chu Ning's mouth drop open was the sight within the cave: dozens of fire-red crystals of various sizes lay scattered everywhere.

"Could these be Fire Spirit Crystals?" Looking at the scene on the magical mirror, Chu Ning was filled with astonishment. Without rushing forward, he let the puppet bird fly around the small cave, confirming there were no other creatures or anomalies. Only then did Chu Ning continue walking down the passage until he reached the entrance of the small cave.

Chu Ning once again released his divine sense, sweeping through the area, confirming there was no danger before truly stepping into the mountain cave.

"What dense fire attribute spiritual qi!" As soon as he entered the cave, Chu Ning couldn't help but exclaim. The puppet bird could only provide vision earlier, but now, with Chu Ning himself inside the cave, the sensation was completely different. Even though he only cultivated wood-attribute techniques, Chu Ning could still discern the intense density of this fire-attribute spiritual qi.

"Ying!" Little White let out a cry at this moment. For an ice-attribute creature like it, being in such a fire-attribute rich environment was naturally uncomfortable. Seeing this, Chu Ning simply put Little White into his spirit beast bag.

Then, he slowly walked to the fire-red crystals he had seen earlier. Crouching down to examine them, Chu Ning let out a surprised murmur.

"They really are Fire Spirit Crystals." He had dug Earth Spirit Crystals before, so he could recognize them at a glance. Thinking that there were dozens of Fire Spirit Crystals inside, he didn't hesitate to take out his tools from his storage bag and begin digging. Having a clear concept of the value of spirit crystals, he naturally knew what a huge fortune this was.

These Fire Spirit Crystals varied in size, with the smallest being only fist-sized. The largest, however, were twice the size of the Earth Spirit Crystal Chu Ning had obtained previously. Chu Ning carefully dug them up, one by one.

...

While Chu Ning was busy digging Fire Spirit Crystals, outside the large mountain cave where Chu Ning had killed the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion, a rather handsome young man slowly appeared. He held a map in his hand, looked up at the cave, and a hint of expectation appeared on his faintly arrogant face. He then quickly walked into the mountain cave. When his gaze fell upon the scene inside, his expression immediately turned exceedingly grim.

"How could this be? Where are the Twin Flames and Wood Fruits?" The handsome young man's gaze then landed on the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion lying on the ground, and expressions of shock, anger, and various other emotions flashed across his face.

"The Twin Flames and Wood Fruits were harvested in advance? I spent such a great price to get this information, and expended so much effort to leave the array formation area and come here, all for these Twin Flames and Wood Fruits. Now, someone has already gotten to them first?" The handsome young man's face twisted, filled with fury.

According to the sect's requirements, he should have left several months ago when the restrictions were opened. But he had deliberately hidden from everyone and hadn't gone out. The main reason was that earlier, in the array formation area, the handsome young man had learned from a junior brother that the place he had been teleported to originally contained Twin Flames and Wood Fruits. However, because he had seen a Tier 1 high-grade demonic beast, he hadn't gone inside. He had used considerable means and paid a price to obtain this information from the other party, even going against sect orders, all for these Twin Flames and Wood Fruits. Now, the spirit fruits he had so desperately wanted had been claimed by someone else, how could he not be furious?

The young man quickly approached the Crimson Flame Twin-Headed Scorpion. After a brief inspection, his expression became even more unpleasant. "This demonic beast just died recently, and I just came in from outside, so..." The handsome young man's gaze then settled on the dark cave entrance. His eyes flickered, and he directly rushed to the cave entrance, about to step inside. But with just a slight lift of his foot, he stopped, retreating instead of advancing, pulling back to the outside of the large mountain cave. Then, he hid himself in a crevice between two rocks.

His gaze towards the large mountain cave, however, gleamed with coldness.

Chu Ning, currently in the small cave at the bottom of the mountain, naturally had no idea that someone else had arrived outside. Including the sloped passage, this cave was over 200 *zhang* long, far exceeding the range of his divine sense. Chu Ning carefully dug up each Fire Spirit Crystal and placed it into his storage bag. He even meticulously probed with his divine sense again, not even letting go of the nearby underground area. After confirming that he hadn't missed a single one, Chu Ning collected everything.

Then, letting the puppet bird scout ahead, he also walked along the sloped passage towards the cave entrance.
