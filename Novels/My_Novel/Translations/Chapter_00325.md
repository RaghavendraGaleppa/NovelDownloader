Chapter 325: The Collapse of Worry-Free Tower, Nine-Orifice Dragon Heart, Traces of Wen Caishang, and a Torrent of Abuse

The newcomer was as beautiful as a flower, tall, and full of heroic spirit. She wore a silver knife at her waist, her long hair tied in a ponytail, and her feet were shod in gold-lined silver tiger boots. Underneath, she wore silver armor, looking awe-inspiring. A waist-length python armor protected her abdomen, accentuating her slender waist. It was none other than Lin Aoshan, the young ancestor of the Lin family from their days in Qiongfu City!

Li Xian thought to himself, "Did I stir up a hornet's nest in the prefecture city? Why am I running into old acquaintances everywhere? Did Gu Nianjun, Zhou Shijie, and Lin Aoshan make an appointment or something?" He waited quietly to observe.

Lin Aoshan was on high alert, her footsteps light. After entering, she immediately hid behind an object. She focused her senses on her surroundings. Only after confirming no one was there did she lightly pat her chest and let out a breath of relief.

Li Xian watched from the side, pondering, "Besides being the Lin family's young ancestor, Lin Aoshan is also an agent of the Patrol Sky Division. Her clothing should be the official uniform of the Patrol Sky Division. She even has a Patrol Sky Division token at her waist. It seems this trip is an official duty."

Suddenly, the sound of footsteps was heard again. Lin Aoshan called out softly, "Big Brother!" Another figure appeared behind her, dressed similarly. He was very young, tall, with a square face, thick eyebrows, and a high nose, yet he had a kind and benevolent appearance.

The man said, "Aoshan, as the saying goes, first come, first served. Since we came later, we should greet the one who came first."

He then called out, "Friend in the shadows, please come out and meet us."

Li Xian no longer hid and revealed himself, saying, "Greetings to you both!" He turned to Lin Aoshan and smiled. "Aoshan, long time no see!"

Lin Aoshan was stunned, and the man looked at Li Xian with curiosity. Lin Aoshan said in a strange tone, "Li... Li Xian?" Li Xian smiled. "It is I."

Lin Aoshan looked at Li Xian, feeling quite conflicted. They had once joined forces to suppress bandits, but now, in a twist of fate, Li Xian had become a notorious flower thief. The Patrol Sky Division monitored the entire world and had the duty to suppress bandits and capture criminals. Meeting under these circumstances made her unsure how to interact with him.

Li Xian said, "I presume you two are not here to capture me. Aoshan, won't you introduce us?"

Lin Aoshan said, "He is my team leader, named Han Qingxiao."

Han Qingxiao smiled. "Aoshan, this must be the recently famous Li Xian, right? Greetings, Brother Li."

Li Xian said in surprise, "Greetings, Brother Han. Everyone else who sees me wants to beat me, kill me, or even flay me alive, yet you, Brother Han, are willing to call me Brother Li, even if just for courtesy. That shows you are no ordinary person."

Han Qingxiao, with his kind face and tall stature, said gently, "That's just the perspective of common people. Rumors, good or bad, are not worth a laugh. I only believe what I see. The first time I saw you, Li Xian, I felt you were heroic and extraordinary, definitely not an evil person. I feel a great affinity with you!"

Lin Aoshan lightly patted her chest, thinking, "Great, Big Brother Han isn't against Li Xian. If they can coexist peacefully, that's for the best." She relaxed and laughed. "Right? Li Xian is a decent person. The rumors are exaggerated; it's all Zhou Shijie's doing."

Lin Aoshan continued, "In that case, Brother Li is definitely not a flower thief? The rumors are a misunderstanding? Once this matter is settled, I will clear your name. That Zhou Shijie is too hateful, ruining your reputation like that. He's bullying you because your family background is weak. Hmph!"

Li Xian smiled. "To be honest, although I, Li, disdain to commit such crimes, due to a twist of fate, I have indeed become deeply entangled with the Flower Cage Sect. I cannot claim to be entirely innocent, so there's no need to trouble yourself with clearing my name. Let them curse if they want; I don't care."

Lin Aoshan was shocked. "Ah! So you really have become a flower thief?" She looked at Han Qingxiao. "But even among flower thieves, there are good and bad ones. Hmm, he should be a good flower thief."

Han Qingxiao said, "Hahaha, you were afraid I would get into a conflict with Brother Li, weren't you? Don't worry, am I the impulsive type? If my guess is correct, Brother Li is here for the same reason as us. We are not enemies; we might even be allies!"

Li Xian understood and smiled. "Why don't we share our information?" Han Qingxiao readily agreed. "I was just about to suggest that!"

At that moment, more footsteps were heard, and a figure in a black robe entered. The person removed their hood, revealing it was "Wang Long of Jingchun Mountain". In the past, at the "Seeking Immortal Inn", the caravan led by Elder Tang Feng had encountered the Jingchun Mountain master and disciples. The Jingchun Taoist had seen through the flower thief's disguise and decisively executed them, killing all several dozen people.

Jingchun Mountain was a branch of the Yueshan Sword Sect. When the five major sword sects formed an alliance, the Jingchun Taoist took his disciples to Feilong City to attend the grand event, connect with fellow martial artists, and step onto a larger stage.

However, during the Five Swords Meeting, the Spirit Fox Banquet, and the temple fair incense offerings, the master and disciples were nowhere to be found. Li Xian had noticed but hadn't thought much of it. Seeing him again now was both surprising and not surprising.

Han Qingxiao asked, "Brother Li, do you know him?" Li Xian said, "To be honest, I met Brother Wang once at the Luo family estate in Xiucheng. At the time, we were exterminating the Black-Faced Bat King, and Brother Wang's heroic bearing was impressive."

Wang Long was startled and bowed to Li Xian. "It is an honor to meet you."

Han Qingxiao said, "This matter is complicated, but I have heard of Brother Li's deeds. You are currently our most trustworthy ally. I, Han Qingxiao, and Lin Aoshan are agents of the Patrol Sky Division. The Patrol Sky Division...patrols the world on behalf of the heavens, monitors the Jianghu, and observes the officials."

"The Division of Celestial Observation observed the qi and luck, measured the stars, and cast star charts, predicting that turmoil was brewing in the South of Yu Province. They specifically sent the Patrol Sky Division to investigate. Although Feilong City is in a remote location, it is a first-class city with considerable influence. Its city lord, He Wenti, appears broad-minded and benevolent, making many friends in the Jianghu to expand his reputation. Secretly, however, he is stockpiling military supplies and grain, harboring great ambition, and truly has the intention to start a rebellion."

"We came specifically to investigate and met Brother Wang Long. Brother Wang Long, please, you speak."

Wang Long said in a deep voice, "That He Wenti appears broad-minded but is extremely treacherous. My Five Swords Meeting...my master was invited to participate, taking me and my junior sister to broaden our horizons and make friends with heroes. On the way, we encountered a group from the Flower Cage Sect."

"My master was decisive in killing, ordering me and my junior sister to slay the villains. It didn't take long to annihilate them all. My master heard that Lord He was kind-hearted and reasonable. Since we had eliminated the flower thieves and rid the people of harm, we were naturally innocent. There was no need to flee; we just needed to meet him and explain, and everything could be clarified. We could even avoid implicating others, so we waited for the government soldiers to capture us."

"That day, the young general of Feilong City, Yang Xinqiang, led a team to surround us. Yang Xinqiang was quite polite and said, 'Although you heroes have punished the wicked and killed the villains, dozens of lives are not a trivial matter. If you have a clear conscience, please come with me.' My master, seeing this young man's righteous aura, suspected nothing."

"All three of us were put into a specially forged prison carriage, from which it was extremely difficult to escape. Yang Xinqiang then said, 'I apologize, everyone. If the facts are clarified afterward, I will personally apologize. For now...bring three cushions, allowing you three to sit and rest in peace!' Although we were in the prison carriage, we had no doubts. We were transported to the prison and temporarily housed there."

"During this time, Lord He personally met with us to inquire about the details. Initially, he treated us with courtesy, saying, 'Although I must keep you in the prison for now, I admire your spirit. I have instructed the guards not to be rude. Once the situation is clear, I will personally welcome you.' My master laughed and said, 'I have long heard of Lord He's benevolence and宽厚. Seeing this, it is indeed true. Since it concerns human lives, caution is a good thing. Take your time to investigate, Lord He. As for me and my disciples, we have a clear conscience, so even the prison is a comfortable place to stay.' He Wenti laughed heartily. 'As expected of a sword sect disciple, truly elegant. Once your innocence is proven, I will invite you for tea.'"

"For the next few days, Lord He came every day to ask questions. He asked about the Five Sword Sects, my master's background, and sometimes spoke of family matters. For the first few days, we were not suspicious, but as time passed and we were never released, my master began to suspect and felt something was wrong."

"Afterward, the food brought by the prison guards became increasingly unpalatable. A few days later, it actually turned sour and smelly, like slop. I was furious and asked, 'Your Lord He said you would treat us with courtesy, how can you give us this to eat!' I knocked over all the food. Those prison guards laughed and said, 'You are criminals, villains, and you still want to eat delicacies? When you truly eat delicacies, your lives will be lost.'"

"Later, it became even worse. Not only did the food turn sour and smelly, but they also spat into it and sprinkled sand. It was truly inedible. My master and disciples refused to eat a single bite. We had cultivation to support us, so not eating for a few days was not a big deal. My master thought of forcing his way out several times, but he was uncertain whether it was because Lord He was busy with affairs and his subordinates were acting badly, or if He himself had ordered it. If it was the former, wouldn't it damage their friendship and add trouble?"

"So we endured bitterly. After several more days, only my master could maintain his composure. My junior sister and I were both hungry and thirsty. The stench in the prison was overwhelming, and after so many days, we felt extremely uncomfortable. We wished nothing more than to get out immediately."

"My master's meditation skills were excellent, but he too was gradually unable to sit still. It was at this moment that Lord He finally came again, but this time he arrived with an icy expression."

"My master asked, 'Lord He, what is the situation?' He Wenti shouted in anger, 'You wicked woman, how dare you deceive me! You are clearly murderous villains! Where are the gentlemanly sword sect disciples?' My master and disciples were all greatly confused. We thought the case was clear, could it be that the investigation had gone in the wrong direction? My master said, 'Lord He, this case is not complicated; you seem to have a misunderstanding about us. Please provide the details, and we will compare them carefully to resolve the misunderstanding.'"

"Lord He said, 'Audacious witch, death is at your door, and you still dare to spread your poisonous words! Do you think this city lord is easy to fool? You clearly killed the merchants for their wealth. There are witnesses who have testified in court! How do you explain that!' At the time, my master and disciples were displeased but still did not suspect He Wenti. We only thought someone was interfering from behind the scenes. My master, with a clear conscience, said, 'What villain is slandering us like this? Lord He, why not let me and my disciples confront them in court!'"

"Lord He sneered, 'Confront them in court? With just a few words from you three, who could argue against you? If you want to confront them, you must wear shackles, one by one, in the public court. If there is even the slightest discrepancy between your testimonies, it is a lie, and you will be punished according to my city's laws!' At the time, my master and disciples were eager to prove our innocence and agreed, putting on the shackles."

"My master and junior sister were taken out of the prison first. I was taken to the court only after a few days. But before the trial, I was fed a voice-robbing drug and couldn't speak a word. From that moment on, I knew He Wenti was a hypocrite. In the court, I had suffering in my heart but could not speak, and my strength was useless. All sorts of crimes were forced upon me, and I was sentenced to death, to be beheaded as a warning. My life was about to end, but fortunately, two righteous heroes saved me, and I was able to survive. But my master and junior sister..."

Li Xian asked, "Have they already been beheaded?" He thought of the heroic and handsome figures of the Jingchun Taoist and Ji Hui, and could not help but feel regret.

Han Qingxiao said, "That day during the trial, Aoshan and I were watching from the side. We noticed many suspicious points in their words, so we rescued him. We gave him an antidote to restore his speech. After hearing his story, we knew that Lord He was two-faced and treacherous, and there was indeed something wrong."

"We figured that the Jingchun Taoist and Junior Sister Ji Hui had met a tragic end and were beheaded before we could meet them. The bodies of executed criminals are stored in the mortuary, so we went to look for them. We did find a few female corpses with similar builds, but their faces, mouths, and ears were all mutilated by blades, making them difficult to identify. We thought they were the two of them."

"So we stole the bodies, found a place to bury them, and erected a tombstone."

"But later, we heard that the female relatives of various sects had gone missing. Recalling He Wenti's motives, we feared that his goal was not just to frame and harm them, but to capture the two women silently. That is why we came here to investigate and met Brother Li Xian."

Li Xian said, "There are so many twists and turns involved." He thought to himself, "I had a chance encounter with his master and disciples in the past. Who would have thought that by a twist of fate, we would cross paths again here."

Han Qingxiao wanted to investigate the Phoenix Banquet. He had the three of them split up and arrive at the Banquet one after another to avoid drawing the attention of any observers. Han Qingxiao said, "Because of this, He Wenti has pushed all his evil deeds onto the Flower Cage Sect. For the sake of survival, Brother Li has also come to investigate."

Li Xian smiled. "Brother Han is clever! In that case, we are the best allies." Wang Long only now realized that Li Xian was a flower thief. He said sternly, "You are a flower thief. Although we have the same goal, to say that we can be allies is absolutely impossible. Brother Han, don't you agree? Aoshan, what about you? How can we associate with a flower thief?"

Li Xian looked at Han Qingxiao, and suddenly, they both laughed heartily. Li Xian said, "As the saying goes, 'A fall into a pit makes a wiser man.' It seems Brother Wang has fallen into a pit but may not have gained any wisdom."

Han Qingxiao nodded. "That makes sense." Wang Long was about to curse, but hearing Han Qingxiao agree, he felt at a loss. He opened his mouth to speak but swallowed his words.

Lin Aoshan asked in confusion, "Li Xian, explain yourself clearly. I don't like these cryptic hints." Seeing Lin Aoshan acting so naturally with Li Xian, Wang Long was even more puzzled.

Li Xian smiled. "Brother Wang Long, have you ever reflected on why you, your master, and your junior sister ended up in this situation? Lord He has a good reputation, and even though you were humiliated in every way, you always believed in him. I, Li Xian, have a bad reputation. Even though I have never been disrespectful or rude to you, you are extremely disgusted with me."

Wang Long was stunned, his face turning pale and then green. He suddenly understood the key point. Lin Aoshan nodded. "No wonder you two laughed. Oh,小龙 (Little Dragon), why don't you learn from your mistakes? You need to learn from this in the future." She was used to being the young ancestor and sometimes called Han Qingxiao "Little Han."

Wang Long hesitated for a moment, then cupped his fists. "I have been taught a lesson!" He said to Lin Aoshan, "Young Ancestor, calling me Little Dragon is really strange. It makes me sound like your grandson."

Lin Aoshan put her hands on her hips. "Oh, you don't want to be my grandson?!" Wang Long's face turned bright red, and he stammered, unable to speak. Lin Aoshan waved her hand. "Fine, fine, even if you wanted to, I wouldn't want you. Li Xian is the handsome young man I fancy."

Li Xian joked, "Please don't. You should just keep Wang Long. Brother Han is fine too." Han Qingxiao laughed. "Nonsense, I am older than Aoshan. How can there be such an upside-down hierarchy?"

Everyone joked for a while. Wang Long felt it was quite strange and kept glancing at Lin Aoshan. He had come to the grand event and had suffered many hardships. His master and junior sister's lives were unknown, and their whereabouts were a mystery. His life was nearly lost, but he happened to be saved by Lin Aoshan and Han Qingxiao.

Lin Aoshan was cheerful and open-minded. Although she liked to act as a senior and spoke with a lecturing tone, she was not arrogant or overbearing. As they spent more time together, Wang Long could not help but feel his heart stir. Han Qingxiao was steady, calm, low-key, and wise, which made him even more admiring.

He saw many fellow disciples from the sword sects speaking closely with Lord He. Not daring to approach them, he followed Lin Aoshan and Han Qingxiao. Seeing the two people he admired most in his life getting along well with Li Xian, his prejudice gradually faded. He proactively cupped his fists and said, "Brother Li, what I said earlier was excessive. I hope you will not take offense!"

Han Qingxiao and Lin Aoshan both looked at him with new respect. Li Xian laughed heartily. "I'm not that petty."

Han Qingxiao said, "To the east of Feilong City is the Snow Dragon Mountain Range, and to the north is the Dragon's Roar Canyon. They are extremely dangerous places. Their perilous terrain creates a unique landscape that has attracted many scholars and poets to visit. Looking down from a high place, it looks like a giant dragon lying in the snow, trying to leap over the canyon, with the momentum of a hidden dragon flying to the sky and a fish leaping over the Dragon Gate."

He took out a city map and roughly drew the surrounding terrain. Han Qingxiao said, "For a mere city lord of Feilong City to plot to seize power... even if the world is about to be in chaos and the dynasty is weakening, he would not dare to do this easily. Lord He must have some other backing."

"A senior from the Division of Celestial Observation said that there might be a great tomb hidden in this city. The Dragon's Roar Canyon to the north should be one of the entrances. I suspect Lord He's backing is inside the tomb. Once we investigate this place and expose Lord He's conspiracy and deeds... this way, Li Xian can escape his predicament. Our duty to monitor will also be fulfilled."

Li Xian asked, "This matter is of great importance. Why didn't the Patrol Sky Division send more people?" Han Qingxiao said, "He Wenti is as cunning as a fox. Even if we send more people, we won't outnumber his soldiers. Moreover, we are here to investigate, not to kill. It is more convenient to infiltrate quietly."

Li Xian said, "In that case... this Lord He must be even more scheming." Wang Long and Lin Aoshan were not deep thinkers and asked, "What do you mean?"

Li Xian said, "If Brother Han is correct, He Wenti's plan should already be showing results, and it is a chain of linked schemes. The Five Sword Sects forming an alliance and gathering in Feilong City is a great opportunity for He Wenti."

Wang Long asked, "How so?"

Li Xian speculated:

"The Five Sword Sects all have their own sects. Why would they travel thousands of miles to specifically discuss their alliance in Feilong City? The Five Sword Sects Alliance has no hierarchy; each sect has equal status. From this perspective, none of the five sects can host the meeting. Only by choosing an external location for the meeting can the equal status of each sword sect be demonstrated."

"The Five Sword Sects, though from the same origin, will inevitably have disputes when it comes to their respective interests. That is why they carefully chose to come to the Worry-Free Tower in Feilong City, with the intention of using a third party to mediate and smooth things over. If there is a conflict, having a respected figure speak up to mediate would make a huge difference."

Han Qingxiao nodded. "That's right. Martial artists are full of spirit. Sometimes things are simple, but everyone is stubborn and doesn't speak clearly. Therefore, misunderstandings and unpleasant incidents often occur."

Li Xian said, "I suspect that after He Wenti learned of this from the Jingchun Taoist, he secretly made a far-reaching plan."

"He Wenti first promoted the alliance, increasing his reputation in the Jianghu. Then he made the female relatives of the five sects disappear and pushed the blame onto the Flower Cage Sect. His next step must be to find a way to eradicate the Flower Cage Sect, making a grand spectacle of it to further boost his reputation and gain a great name!"

"Regardless of whether the women are found or not, the Flower Cage Sect is a scourge on the world. This move of his will surely bring him great prestige. If he happens to succeed, how could his reputation not be great?"

"The Five Sword Sects are located on five different mountains, each with a certain distance from the others. Having formed an alliance, they will inevitably use Feilong City as their gathering point in the future."

"In this way, everything is linked in a chain... The Five Sword Sects will inevitably be on good terms with him! He has already won the favor of the Five Sword Sects. At this time, his reputation is good, and he has the help of the Five Sword Sects. Moreover, the Five Sword Sects surround Feilong City, forming a loose outer barrier. In the future, when he hosts grand events or seeks help from enemies... he will have countless benefits, and his power will have begun to take shape!"

Wang Long, Lin Aoshan, and Han Qingxiao all nodded repeatedly. Han Qingxiao said, "What a clever plan. Aoshan, you should learn from this."

Lin Aoshan kept praising him. "Little Xian, you did a great job! Last time you suppressed the flower thieves, it was also your plan that succeeded. It seems that after not seeing you for a long time, you have become even smarter."

Li Xian said, "It's just speculation. But if this He Wenti has ambitions to dominate, he should have such a plan."

Wang Long admired him. "Brother Li, with such talent, it's a waste to just be a flower thief!" Li Xian said, "There are other hidden reasons for this matter. It's not easy to explain."

Han Qingxiao said, "If that's the case, why haven't you been able to escape?"

Lin Aoshan said, "That's right. Lord He should be eager for you to escape." Li Xian nodded. "He should be putting on a grand show to win the favor of the many sword sects and would not just disappear suddenly. Yang Xinqiang is handling the matter of capturing the thieves, stealing all the limelight."

Li Xian said, "If my guess is correct, he has probably encountered some trouble and has no time to attend to other matters."

Han Qingxiao said, "Good! We will know the specifics once we investigate." He took out a golden disc and said, "This was given to me by the Division of Celestial Observation." He didn't elaborate, just manipulated the golden disc.

The golden disc was filled with countless inscriptions, and its operation was extremely complex. Li Xian watched for a moment and felt dizzy. Han Qingxiao quickly warned, "Brothers, don't look. This contains infinite calculations. If you don't understand the principles, looking at this disc being manipulated could be life-threatening."

Li Xian said, "Let's search around separately and see if there are any clues!" They dispersed to investigate.

Han Qingxiao manipulated the disc for a while, then suddenly said in a grave tone, "Ah! There is a tomb buried beneath this place. The terrain of this tomb is the 'Nine-Orifice Dragon Heart Acupoint'. This place is one of the orifices. It was originally a large pit, but it has been sealed by the Worry-Free Tower. The great tomb is below."

Li Xian asked, "Can we find a way in?" Han Qingxiao said, "It's difficult. The mechanisms of the Worry-Free Tower are complex. Even with the golden disc, I can barely calculate anything. If we want to enter the tomb, we need to find the other orifices of the Nine-Orifice Dragon Heart Acupoint. But the other eight orifices are probably outside the city."

Li Xian pondered, "Is there really no way?" Han Qingxiao said, "Unless the Worry-Free Tower collapses, but that would be so difficult..."

As he was speaking, the building suddenly shook. Han Qingxiao immediately took out the golden disc, manipulated it quickly, and said in shock, "The Nine-Orifice Dragon Heart Acupoint... the orifices are shifting, and it seems to be... man-made. Oh no! The Worry-Free Tower is really going to collapse!"

A red tree fell from above. Li Xian dodged to the side. He saw the building shake violently, lamp stands toppling, jade tables shattering, dancers fleeing, red silk tearing... all these changes happened in an instant.

Li Xian moved his body to dodge when he saw that Lin Aoshan's martial arts were slightly weaker and was about to be crushed by a wooden beam. Wang Long and Li Xian both moved to save her. Wang Long was slightly closer and had excellent lightness skill. He slashed with his sword. His internal energy was turbulent, and his sword qi was like a wave or a torrent.

However, the wood of the Worry-Free Tower was tougher than black iron, unafraid of fire or blades, and was extremely thick and heavy. Although Wang Long's sword arrived first, it left a deep gash on the wooden beam but could not ultimately break it.

Just as Lin Aoshan and Wang Long felt hopeless, they saw a silver spear thrust out. It seemed to have the roar of a dragon and the ferocity of a ghostly python. It was domineering and peerless. With one spear thrust, it shattered the wooden beam, sending wood chips flying everywhere.

It was Li Xian, his silver spear drawn from his sleeve, his strength terrifying! Wang Long, Lin Aoshan, and Han Qingxiao could not help but exclaim in admiration, thinking, "What a fine youth, what a great hero!"

Li Xian swung his spear technique. The tip of the spear was covered with an invisible "Pure Yang Qi Armor". With a shake and a swing, all the falling wood around him was pushed away. It was a case of "if he doesn't act, it's fine, but when he does, he stuns everyone."

Li Xian said, "Be careful! These wooden beams are all extraordinary objects, heavier than iron and stone!" Wang Long said gratefully, "Brother Li, thank you!"

Lin Aoshan cheered, "Great, you've become even more powerful!" She did not fall behind and exerted all her strength to resist. Amidst the falling of giant beams, the ground suddenly made a booming sound, and a huge pit caved in at the center of the Worry-Free Tower.

Li Xian, Lin Aoshan, Wang Long, and Han Qingxiao fell into the pit. It was pitch black around them, and they only felt their bodies falling. Li Xian opened his heavy pupils to observe the situation of the three others. They were all using their lightness skills to slow their fall and were unharmed.

Suddenly, in an instant, Li Xian vaguely heard a furious roar coming from the depths of the pit, filled with anger but sounding utterly helpless: "Wen Caishang! You bitch! Bitch! Bitch!" It seemed to be the voice of He Wenti.
