# Chapter 28: Lin Yun: "Let's Change Location—Onto the Table"

"If I go around befriending them one by one, it would be a complete waste of time. Besides, these people aren't like Han Li, who has a bright future ahead and might yield something valuable."

"Moreover, seeking them out individually would make me look desperate. I can't tolerate that."

"Among the ten thousand or so disciples in the Yellow Maple Valley, the vast majority will likely remain Qi Condensation cultivators their entire lives."

"Going to great lengths to raise their favorability ratings is definitely unnecessary."

"Making friends with them and harvesting something from each person would suffice. Even if each one only yields an average of a hundred spirit stones, that's still a million spirit stones in total."

"Since seeking them out is a waste of time, why not make them come to me instead?"

Lin Yun pondered the question in his mind.

After some thought, he arrived at a simple answer.

Two words: benefits!

If he could make these people believe there was something to gain from him, they would all swarm over to befriend him.

"The only thing I have that could appeal to so many people right now would be talismans, right?" Lin Yun stroked his chin as he considered.

"Opening a shop to sell talismans, or crafting them myself?"

Lin Yun shook his head. "That won't work."

"To truly captivate the Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment disciples of Yellow Maple Valley, sparking a frenzy, it would have to be high-grade primary talismans—especially offensive and defensive ones."

"Each of those talismans costs between fifty to a hundred spirit stones. Opening a shop would be too ordinary, and since I have no reputation, most people wouldn't buy them—or even afford them. If I gave them away for free, it would definitely cause a sensation, but the cost would exceed six hundred thousand spirit stones, which is way too high. The net profit would only be around four hundred thousand."

"Besides, there's another major issue—how would I explain such a massive expenditure of spirit stones?"

"Even if the Yellow Maple Valley disciples were blind, a transaction involving hundreds of thousands of spirit stones would definitely draw attention. As for crafting them myself? Even worse!"

"Drawing over ten thousand high-grade primary talismans to give away? I'm not an idiot."

"So giving them away for free is out of the question—at least not one per person. The workload would be enormous, the time investment too long, and the payoff wouldn't be worth it." Lin Yun dismissed the first plan.

"Let me think more carefully."

"I need to reach as many people as possible, ensure widespread exposure, and sell the goods cheaply so that most can participate."

After distilling these key points, Lin Yun suddenly had an epiphany.

"Isn't this just like Pinduoduo?!"

"Want free talismans? Want discounts? Want to buy talismans at low prices? Get your friends to help you slash the price!"

"Hmm—"

"That might actually work!"

"Yellow Maple Valley has over ten thousand disciples. Bring in one new person, and get a 10% discount!"

"Bring in ten people, and the talisman is yours for free!"

"This time, the number of Yellow Maple Valley disciples I need to interact with is under twenty thousand."

"Calculated this way, the original requirement of over ten thousand talismans drops several-fold—I'd only need to craft around two thousand at most. The cost plummets from over six hundred thousand spirit stones to under a hundred and twenty thousand. And if I craft them myself, factoring in only material costs, the total expense would definitely stay under thirty thousand spirit stones."

"With just one talisman's effort, I can harvest ten people!"

"Spending a few dozen spirit stones to gain hundreds or even thousands in return—that's terrifying profit! Thirty thousand spirit stones turning into over a million? A thirtyfold return—why wouldn't I do it?"

"Of course I'd do it! I'm a genius!"

"On top of that, through this event, I can also establish a reputation as someone who loves making friends. That way, when I approach Xiang Zhili, I'll have a legitimate reason—and I can even squeeze some benefits out of a Nascent Soul grandmaster!"

"Absolute win!"

"So, let's name this plan the Yellow Maple Valley Friendship Expansion Project!"

"Aside from Xiang Zhili, the Nascent Soul grandmaster who deserves special attention, there are a few others worth keeping an eye on."

"During Yellow Maple Valley's upcoming recruitment event, there will be a pair of brothers with the rare Thunder Spiritual Roots. There's also supposedly a child from the Wang Clan—a direct descendant of a major cultivation family—who possesses the innate 'Mystic Yin Eyes,' allowing him to cultivate the long-lost 'Soul-Shattering Divine Light,' which can suppress all ghosts and evil spirits."

"Then there's a beauty named Nie Ying. By the time Han Li returns from the Chaotic Star Sea and reaches the Nascent Soul stage, she'll have successfully formed her Golden Core, becoming a Core Formation cultivator. There's a chance to obtain magical treasures from her."

After careful consideration, Lin Yun nodded. Staying in the realm of mere thought was useless—admiring others wouldn't get him anywhere. He had to take action!

Having made up his mind, Lin Yun walked to the bed and nudged the still-sleeping Chen Qiaoqian.

"Qiaoqian, Qiaoqian~!"

"Big Brother Lin, I really can't eat anymore... Please spare me..."

---

*Slurp—*

Chen Qiaoqian smacked her lips and shifted slightly.

"What kind of dream are you having? Wake up already!" Lin Yun's face darkened as he raised his hand, aiming for a certain curve.

"Ah—!" Chen Qiaoqian jolted awake.

"Big Brother Lin, be gentle..." She wrapped her arms around his neck, her gaze sultry, her voice soft and delicate as she whispered, "I want more..."

Resting her head on Lin Yun's shoulder, she traced circles on his chest with her delicate fingers.

"Qiaoqian, tell the Chen family to exchange all the spirit stones meant for me into talisman materials," Lin Yun instructed.

"All forty thousand spirit stones?" Chen Qiaoqian looked at him in surprise.

"Yes, all of them," Lin Yun confirmed.

"Alright, I'll inform Father." Chen Qiaoqian nodded.

Then, gazing at him tenderly, she said, "Big Brother Lin, I feel like my body is swelling up. Every time after we... my cultivation seems to improve significantly. Do you know why?"

"Must be my special physique. For female cultivators, I'm like a divine fruit—a top-tier spiritual treasure that greatly boosts cultivation." Lin Yun stroked his chin smugly.

"You're awful—" Chen Qiaoqian rolled her eyes. "Who praises themselves like that?"

"Then do you want more or not?" Lin Yun countered.

"Let's change location—onto the table!"

While Lin Yun was busy with his own fiery battles, Han Li wasn't doing too badly either. From an Elder Murong of Yellow Maple Valley, he had obtained the Foundation Establishment Pill he had long coveted.

At that moment, he was happily soaring through the mountains on the leaf-shaped flying artifact issued by the sect, reveling in the feeling of freedom.

At first, unfamiliar with the artifact, his flight was erratic—rising and falling unsteadily. But soon, he mastered the technique.

(Note: The scene where the Foundation Establishment Pill is taken is borrowed from the anime adaptation.)

"Hahaha—"

"So this is the feeling of flying?!"

"If I were still a mortal, I might never have experienced this in my entire life!"

"Hahaha—"

Han Li's face was alight with joy.

But his triumph didn't last long. From the forest below, a stone projectile shot toward him. The attack was swift and fierce, launched from the dense foliage as a sneak attack. Han Li was struck and sent flying.

"Ugh—!" The impact sent him tumbling through the air. His body crashed through a tree before rolling several times on the ground, finally coming to a stop against another trunk.
