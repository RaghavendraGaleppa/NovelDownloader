# Chapter 39: Settling Scores the Same Day They're Made!

The four cultivators had drawn the full aggression of the Crimson-Tailed Ape and the Emerald-Faced Water Spider, allowing Gu Yuan to slip through the "dangerous" battlefield effortlessly and reach the depths of the water cavern.

The passage here had narrowed significantly, barely a few zhang wide, with turbulent currents rushing through. At the end stood a stone platform, upon which rested a massive crimson jade clam. As its shells parted slightly, rich spiritual energy wafted out, invigorating the senses.

The Clam King!

A treasure born only once every few decades in the first layer of the clam beds. Consuming its pearl when one's cultivation reached perfection would allow immediate advancement to the next realm—a true treasure by any measure.

And now, Gu Yuan stood mere inches away from it.

A single outstretched hand could claim this fifth-layer water cavern's prize, saving years of arduous cultivation.

Yet just as Gu Yuan prepared to seize the Clam King, he paused, withdrawing his hand as if remembering something. His gaze turned wary, scanning his surroundings as he remained motionless.

The cavern fell eerily silent, save for the rushing water.

After a long moment, a cold laugh echoed from the seemingly empty stone platform:

"A disciple from some backwater sect, yet so cautious. But even so, today will be your last!"

As the voice rang out, a figure materialized from thin air upon the platform—pale-faced, jade-adorned, with a trace of malice in his eyes. It was Kuang Mingsheng, the same man who had clashed with Gu Yuan aboard the Dragon Fang Treasure Ship.

He had been lying in ambush here all along, concealed by some technique!

Beside Kuang Mingsheng hovered three peculiar silver mirrors, shimmering faintly as if eager to strike. Had Gu Yuan reached for the Clam King, he would have suffered a devastating attack—even attempting to grasp it with spiritual energy would have ended poorly.

"I used those fools as bait, planning to claim the Clam King first. Who'd have thought you'd stumble in here too, boy," Kuang Mingsheng sneered, his murderous intent palpable.

Their prior enmity aside, Gu Yuan had now witnessed his scheme. No words were needed—only death would suffice.

"Go!"

With a sharp command, the three silver mirrors flashed like lightning, unleashing beams of eerie light that instantly illuminated Gu Yuan.

These beams carried a strange power—Gu Yuan found himself unable to resist as they enveloped him completely. His spiritual energy, consciousness, and even physical body seemed bound by an alien force. His limbs grew weak, his mind sluggish, his cultivation base unstable—as if facing imminent death.

"Sever!"

Kuang Mingsheng's assault didn't stop there. With a finger pointed, three differently colored talismans surged from his dantian.

In an instant, flames rained from above, water serpents erupted from below, and a gleaming silver sword-light shot straight for Gu Yuan's brow.

That Kuang Mingsheng had earned the trust of the Hidden Dragon Academy disciples spoke to his capabilities. Now seated cross-legged in full battle array, spiritual light radiating from his form, his flowing robes made him seem like an immortal deity pronouncing Gu Yuan's doom.

"Some backwater sect's—" His lips curled in disdain.

Then his expression twisted in shock.

With a flick of Gu Yuan's wrist, a peculiar magical implement composed of eight interlocking golden rings shot forth.

"Clang!"

The rings expanded midair before separating violently. Three of them streaked toward Kuang Mingsheng's silver mirrors with lightning speed.

"Crack!"

Before Kuang Mingsheng could react, his Three Decay Mirrors were firmly shackled by the golden rings. An esoteric power emanated from them, severing his connection to the mirrors completely.

"Whoosh!"

Simultaneously, thick mist erupted across the stone platform—dense and obscuring, it blotted out all senses and spiritual perception.

Most crucially, torrential rain began pouring, its downpour suppressing the power of Kuang Mingsheng's three talismans until they flickered weakly.

"Thud!"

Before he could process this turn, his dantian trembled violently.

The three talismans returned to him dimmed and damaged, as if having suffered a fierce counterattack.

"Cloud Radiance Robe!"

Kuang Mingsheng's face paled, all prior confidence gone as he urgently summoned his protective treasure—a robe that draped him in shimmering light.

"Clang!"

Yet no sooner had the robe appeared than another golden ring shot from the mist, clamping onto the radiant barrier.

The protective glow instantly dimmed to nothingness, the robe falling limply to the ground like common cloth.

"Eight Gates Shield Talisman!"

"Rainbow Flight Talisman!"

Heart pounding with alarm, Kuang Mingsheng activated defensive talismans while attempting to flee the unnatural mist.

"ROAR!"

Then a draconic bellow echoed through his consciousness—a bestial, primordial sound that carried such ferocity it momentarily froze his activated talismans.

"Since when were there flood dragons in Cloud Cliff Clam Beds?" he wondered distantly.

Then excruciating pain erupted from his neck.

His vision spun, the world turning upside-down as he glimpsed a headless corpse.

Then—nothing.

...

Kuang Mingsheng had never left the stone platform, maintaining his composed posture to the end—if one ignored the missing head.

"Few cultivators walk the virtuous path," Gu Yuan mused, observing the headless corpse. "Using fellow disciples as bait—utterly contemptible."

"Then again, neither am I particularly virtuous."

His initial wariness had been sparked upon entering the water cavern—seeing Yang Yue and the others battling desperately while Kuang Mingsheng was conspicuously absent. That caution had led him to pause before claiming the Clam King, which revealed their hidden observer.

Whatever concealment technique Kuang Mingsheng had used to remain undetected on the platform was impressive, but his impatience had betrayed him after mere moments of waiting.

Their battle had been brief—enmity formed and settled within the same day, causality neatly resolved.

But in the clam beds, beyond the Academy's laws, life and death were decided in moments. Here, the darker impulses of cultivators ran unchecked.

"Still, your death isn't undeserved. Even had we not met today, I'd have sought you out eventually."

With a light chuckle, Gu Yuan flicked his fingers, summoning searing flames that reduced the corpse to ashes before collecting the fallen storage pouch and dimmed magical implements.

Since their altercation on the treasure ship, he'd contemplated dealing with this man—not merely to settle grievances, but for practical gain.

Gu Yuan knew his limitations. Though he possessed the high-grade Eight Winds Golden Rings gifted by a Golden Core elder, it remained his sole magical implement. Without proper defensive treasures, facing scions of great clans could leave him vulnerable.

Unable to afford proper equipment, he'd resolved to "acquire" from adversaries instead. The lawless clam beds provided perfect cover.

Eliminating Kuang Mingsheng would bolster his strength, granting him better odds against potential "noble assaults."

With this in mind, Gu Yuan unleashed his spiritual sense like a flood dragon, swiftly erasing Kuang Mingsheng's imprints to access the storage pouch.

A dazzling array of treasures greeted him.
