# Chapter 33: Why Didn't Little Sister Tell Me Sooner?!

Extending his divine sense outside the pavilion, Han Zhen saw Han Yunzhi and her formidable-looking brother. A few breaths later, the pavilion door suddenly opened.

Han Yunfeng, at Qi Condensation Layer Ten, felt his aura falter the moment he sensed the fluctuations of spiritual power from Han Zhen. A flash of insight flickered in his eyes as he looked at Han Zhen's Dantian.

"Perfected Qi Condensation Layer Ten!"

What layer of Qi Condensation was he at when I last saw him? In just over a year, he had advanced from Qi Condensation Layer Eight to the perfected Qi Condensation Layer Ten! What a terrifying cultivation speed! He considered himself quite talented, yet it had taken him a full year to go from Qi Condensation Layer Nine to Layer Ten. He had originally intended to "show off his might" and make Han Zhen retreat in the face of difficulty, but instead, he had become the clown.

Han Yunfeng glanced at his extremely quiet sister beside him. Why had she told him so many things about Han Zhen, yet omitted the most important part about his cultivation level?

Han Zhen, however, had no idea what Han Yunfeng was thinking. He had merely mentioned it casually to Han Yunzhi back then, but she had actually taken his words as a serious invitation and kept it in mind. Seeing Han Yunfeng's dusty appearance, he guessed that his sister must have brought him to the gathering immediately after he emerged from seclusion.

"It's a good thing I bought spirit tea from Shopkeeper Tian," Han Zhen mused, appreciating his foresight. Otherwise, serving mortal tea to such important guests who held him in high regard would be quite embarrassing! Both their thoughts occurred in the blink of an eye.

Han Yunfeng had originally come to question him, so he naturally hadn't prepared any gifts. For a moment, he felt awkward, unsure what to say. Fortunately, Han Yunzhi was extremely perceptive. She took out a gift box from her small satchel.

"These are some pastries I made myself. If Senior Brother Han doesn't mind, please accept them," Han Yunzhi said shyly. This was her first time giving something she made by hand to someone other than her brother.

Han Yunfeng naturally had something to say about his sister's craftsmanship and quickly chimed in, "Indeed, indeed! Junior Brother Han, you absolutely must try my sister's handiwork!"

"Then I shall not refuse your kindness."

Han Zhen deactivated the pavilion's formation and invited the Han siblings inside. He took the pastries from Han Yunzhi, thinking, *Even though we're so familiar, this girl is still so easily embarrassed.*

Han Zhen and Han Yunfeng took the main seats, while Han Yunzhi arranged the pastries on a plate. She then volunteered to brew tea for them, and immediately, a delicate tea fragrance filled the room.

"I haven't had a chance to congratulate Brother Han on his significant cultivation advancement yet. I didn't expect you'd think of me the moment you emerged from seclusion," Han Zhen said, offering a compliment.

"Ah, Junior Brother Han, please stop teasing me. You're the one who quietly surpassed me," Han Yunfeng said, self-deprecatingly and with a hint of shame.

"This is also thanks to a slight talent in talisman arts and relying on medicinal pills to achieve such a cultivation level."

Although he had Han Yunzhi help him sell talismans, he couldn't tell her everything. Han Zhen still used the excuse that his cultivation was boosted by pills. However, his real major earnings came from transactions at the Myriad Treasures Pavilion; Han Yunzhi's involvement was merely a cover.

Thus, the two discussed the path of cultivation after Qi Condensation Layer Ten. Although their cultivation techniques were different, there were still many points they could learn from each other. Han Yunzhi listened intently beside them, while Han Yunfeng felt that Han Zhen not only possessed outstanding talent but also terrifyingly superb comprehension. His understanding of late-stage Qi Condensation cultivation techniques far surpassed Han Yunfeng's; he could even offer guidance on difficult points of Han Yunfeng's own cultivation technique. Recalling his disparaging thoughts about Han Zhen before their meeting, Han Yunfeng couldn't help but feel a blush of shame. At his rate of advancement, he would definitely break through to the eleventh layer of his cultivation technique before the Immortal Ascension Convention. Coupled with his identity as a Talisman Master, it was possible he wouldn't even need to step onto the arena to be accepted as a disciple by one of the Seven Great Sects. If anything, his sister was now the one marrying up.

The two spoke until their throats were dry, and by then, the tea was brewed.

"Spirit tea!" Han Yunfeng's reaction upon tasting spirit tea for the first time was identical to Han Zhen's previously. It seemed few rogue cultivators at the Qi Condensation stage would spend spirit stones on such things.

"Speaking of which, I forgot to thank Junior Brother Han for all the care you've shown my sister over the past year."

As Han Yunfeng said this, he brought up the incident where his sister had been troubled by someone right after he came out of seclusion. Hearing Han Yunfeng's account, Han Zhen asked doubtfully, "Was the leader calling himself Daoist Qingwen?"

"Junior Brother Han knows him?" Han Yunfeng frowned. If it was a case of "the flood washing away the Dragon King's temple" (an accidental offense), then he would apologize to Qingwen in the future, giving Junior Brother Han face.

"Just a chance encounter. He once invited me to join some Rogue Cultivator Alliance. I didn't think much of it then, but now I find him quite suspicious," Han Zhen said, shaking his head.

"Oh, how so?" Han Yunfeng was clearly curious, especially since the Daoist had just invited them.

"Brother Han has been in seclusion recently and might not have heard, but several fellow rogue cultivators have mysteriously disappeared in Tai'nan Valley," Han Zhen's words clearly implied.

They both already had the answer in their hearts, but since there was no concrete evidence, they tacitly did not pursue the topic further. Han Yunfeng thought of the Daoist couple who had left Tai'nan Valley with Qingwen; perhaps they had already met a tragic end.

"By the way, Junior Brother Han is now at perfected Qi Condensation Layer Ten. Advancing another layer within a year should be no problem for you. You won't miss the Immortal Ascension Convention, will you?" Han Yunfeng suddenly asked.

Almost all Qi Condensation cultivators, to enter the Foundation Establishment stage, must consume Foundation Establishment Pills, a spiritual medicine that only major sects can refine, to have any hope of breaking through the bottleneck and successfully establishing their foundation. In the Yue Kingdom's cultivation world, the ingredients for Foundation Establishment Pills were extremely rare. The Seven Great Sects had to work together, and only every ten years could they hope to produce a little over a thousand pills. These pills were long ago divided among the major sects, barely meeting their own demands, let alone being allowed to flow out to others.

However, there were countless rogue cultivators in the Yue Kingdom's cultivation world, and a significant number were able to cultivate their techniques beyond Qi Condensation Layer Seven. In such circumstances, more and more rogue cultivators needed Foundation Establishment Pills, which naturally led to increasingly sharp conflicts between the major sects and the rogue cultivators. Therefore, every ten years, each of the Seven Great Sects would offer ten slots for these rogue cultivators to compete for. The final winners would be determined through arena battles, allowing them to join one of the Seven Great Sects and then be provided with Foundation Establishment Pills. This way, the Foundation Establishment Pills wouldn't flow out, the Seven Great Sects could recruit high-quality disciples, and the discontent of rogue cultivators would be appeased. It was a win-win-win situation, with the Seven Great Sects winning three times over.

Of course, there was also a restriction: cultivators had to be under forty years old and at least at Qi Condensation Layer Seven. This was because after a cultivator exceeded forty years of age, their chances of establishing their foundation would decrease year by year. Even if such cultivators were powerful in combat, they held little cultivation value for the Seven Great Sects. The Immortal Ascension Convention was born from these circumstances.

Han Zhen nodded. Although he possessed an Immortal Ascension Token, he still intended to participate. Perhaps with his qualifications, he might even be able to directly join one of the Seven Great Sects without even needing to compete in the arena?
