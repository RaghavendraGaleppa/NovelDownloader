# Chapter 431: The Heaven's Will of This Realm

The Nine-Realm Supreme Grandmaster, who once single-handedly quelled the turmoil across the Thirty-Six Peaks, actually needed to silently recite the Calming Heart Sutra and circulate his true qi through three major meridian cycles just to steady his mind.

He could clearly sense that the disciple who once needed his protection now had a flow around him that was no longer martial true qi, but some kind of profound power closer to the origin of heaven and earth.

Its quality was far, far superior to true qi.

Xu Yunfan nodded with a smile. This simple action suddenly caused the plaque hanging in the hall, inscribed with "The Dao Follows Nature," to glow with golden light.

He glanced at it casually, but as he was about to withdraw his gaze, his expression paused slightly. He turned his head to examine it carefully.

"The aura of 'The Dao Follows Nature'..."

Xu Yunfan furrowed his brow slightly, his divine sense spreading out like ripples.

The three treasures of a Foundation Establishment cultivator's essence, qi, and spirit had long been refined into one, and his memory was as clear as daylight. He should not have such a vague feeling.

Yet the Dao charm flowing on the plaque now felt familiar, as if seen through a thin mist.

He suddenly recalled the tattered war banner he had seen in the Xuantian Pavilion's A-Rank Repository of the Primordial Origin Sect in the Taihua Realm. It also carried such an aura.

But the root cause wasn't here. It seemed he had discovered something extraordinary.

As he pondered this, the few young disciples nearby, unable to bear the True Martial威压 (might/pressure) permeating the air, had to lean against the corridor pillars to stay standing.

They discovered in terror that the vital energy they had painstakingly cultivated for years was flowing backward in their flesh and blood, as if actively avoiding the aura of that existence.

Hearing the commotion, Xu Yunfan quickly snapped back to his senses. Looking at Bi Yuan, who was both shocked and delighted, Xu Yunfan smiled.

"Master!"

Bi Yuan's heart settled. He asked with concern, "How have you been these past few days?"

"Quite well. I had some fortuitous encounters in the Taihua Realm and have finally stabilized myself."

Xu Yunfan spoke lightly and casually. "I have successfully established my Foundation. I am currently in the Primordial Origin Sect of the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm and have obtained the qualification to open a peak. After stabilizing slightly, I have returned."

Bi Yuan's throat moved slightly.

As the Sect Master of the Dao Sect, and having previously interrogated disciples of the Demon Subduing Sect, he naturally knew the weight of the term "opening a peak" in an upper-realm sect.

It meant that the disciple who once needed his protection was now the master of a peak, capable of truly presiding over the fate of a region.

"Fortuitous encounters?" Bi Yuan's voice was filled with emotion. "It has only been three years since you left the Divine Martial Realm..."

Three years.

Xu Yunfan subconsciously calculated with his fingers, his brow raising slightly.

It seemed the flow of time in the Divine Martial Realm differed from that in the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm. No wonder the time gaps between each entry of the Primordial Origin Sect disciples were not very large.

"Do you remember what you said when you sent the disciple away back then?"

Xu Yunfan put away his token and stood with his hands behind his back. "Upon learning that the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm had the true Dao of Immortality that could break through the shackles, you said the Divine Martial Realm was a dry well. This disciple, as a frog, had to jump out to see the real world."

Hearing this, Bi Yuan couldn't help but smile.

He naturally remembered. It was the conversation on the night before Xu Yunfan's departure, on the summit of Qingwei Mountain.

"It seems..." Bi Yuan took a deep breath, trying to calm the turbulent qi and blood in his chest. Even with his temperament, he couldn't help but feel a few thoughts rising in his heart. He laughed, "This frog of mine didn't just jump out of the dry well, it has even turned into a dragon."

"Turning into a dragon? Master is jesting."

Xu Yunfan shook his head and smiled lightly. In his eyes, there seemed to be a scene of a turtle and snake coiling together. He gently stroked the hilt of the True Martial Sword, and the blade immediately emitted a layer of azure, hazy mystic light. Faintly, the shadows of a turtle and snake roamed the edge of the sword.

"The true dragon is a true spirit of heaven and earth. Even a Golden Core True Lord would show courtesy upon seeing one. This disciple's meager cultivation, a flood dragon is perhaps acceptable, but a true dragon is far from it."

Bi Yuan sighed, "But it is far better than the loaches in our pond."

He paused, looking Xu Yunfan up and down with concern. "You... have suffered."

Xu Yunfan's heart warmed. He smiled, "Suffering is not the right word. There were some twists and turns, but overall, it was quite smooth."

As he spoke, he pressed his hand down lightly, and a ray of azure light sank into Bi Yuan's brow.

"What is this?"

Bi Yuan's whole body shook, feeling a profound scripture appear in his Purple Mansion.

"The True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture," Xu Yunfan said softly. "The path this disciple cultivates now is sufficient to allow Master to break through the Nine-Realm shackles."

In the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm, every path of cultivation has its forerunners.

Once a cultivator achieves the Foundation Establishment realm, if later generations practice their true scripture, it will invisibly add strength to their Dao path. The more people who practice it, the more stable the foundation of their Dao becomes, and the smoother the path of cultivation.

For this reason, any Foundation Establishment真人 (True Person) will open a peak and spread the Dharma, accepting a wide range of disciples.

It is both to pass on the Dao lineage and to forge the foundation of their own Dharma lineage.

This is the consensus of cultivators in the Taihua Realm and the necessary path after Foundation Establishment.

This is also why, without exception, once a Foundation Establishment True Person establishes their foundation, they open a peak to spread the Dharma, forming their own Dharma lineage.

With more people practicing it, it is naturally possible to have more Foundation Establishment spots.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but recall the aura he had sensed back then, the one connected to the person practicing the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture in the Bodhi Pure Land.

It must have been obscured by a True Lord's hand previously. Otherwise, how could he have only sensed it after holding the True Martial Sword?

Scheming, far too scheming.

But the Primordial Origin Sect was one step ahead, managing to bring over the True Martial Sword.

The two sides were indispensable to each other, and a life-and-death battle was inevitable in the future.

Now, relying on the True Martial Peak, the True Martial Sword, and the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture supported by the Attribute Panel, when he opened his Dharma lineage and drew upon the cultivation aura of later generations, it would not easily become someone else's wedding dress.

Bi Yuan's hands trembled slightly.

He had cultivated for nearly three life cycles, stuck at the "Spirit Unites with the Dao" stage of the Ninth Realm of martial arts for almost twenty years. This scripture now was like a beacon in the darkness, pointing him toward the path ahead.

"You..."

"Master."

Xu Yunfan interrupted him, his gaze suddenly becoming profound. "The sky of the Divine Martial Realm is about to change."

The moment he spoke these words, a sudden thunderclap echoed from outside the hall.

Bi Yuan looked up sharply, only to see that the originally clear sky had now revealed a heavenly anomaly.

Bi Yuan looked up sharply. The originally clear, wash-like sky suddenly changed color.

The vast, cloudless sky seemed to be torn apart by an invisible hand. Amidst the surging clouds, several bolts of lightning suddenly exploded out of nowhere.

Heaven's wrath?

Not quite.

Xu Yunfan glanced at it indifferently and withdrew his gaze. What he was doing would naturally make the will of the Divine Martial Realm dissatisfied. With such feelings in his heart, anomalies would naturally descend.

But he was a native of the Divine Martial Realm and had the merit of slaying outer demons. The will of heaven was an unconscious operating entity and could do nothing about it.

"This time, returning..."

After Xu Yunfan explained his intentions, Bi Yuan was naturally swept up in a tide of emotion. He was more than willing.

A member of the Dao Sect, having reached his step, who wouldn't want to take another step forward and seek the fruit of the Dao of longevity.

In the end, Bi Yuan made a decision in an instant. "Good! Good! Good! I will sound the Dao Sect's great bell later and have the Nine-Realm elders come out of seclusion to see if they are willing to go with you!"
