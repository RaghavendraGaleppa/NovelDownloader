# Chapter 38: Why Evil Cultivators Are Evil Cultivators

"But it's also true that it was thanks to you blocking that attack that Ma Wen was able to take you all away. Otherwise, with Yang Shou's strength at the time, you probably would have all died there." Old Huang shook his head and sighed.

He then put away the recorded confession and said, "Alright, I'll answer those questions you had earlier, one by one."

"First, Senior Brother Mu suffered a great loss. Nearly three years' worth of True Essence he cultivated was destroyed. However, through this incident, the sect also saw Senior Brother Mu's capability and character, deciding to let him join the War Hall. He was also greatly rewarded with cultivation resources and time. It shouldn't take long for Senior Brother Mu's losses to be recovered."

"Secondly, the Brother Ma you mentioned should be Ma Xiu, the one who came to report, right? Don't worry, he's perfectly fine. Among the three of you, he was the safest and suffered the least loss, and he also received a large number of rewards."

"As for Yang Shou, how else could he be dealt with? Naturally, he was killed. The sect absolutely will not spare any evil cultivators."

Ding Rui was startled. "He was really killed?"

"Why would I lie to you?"

"When was he killed?"

"That same day."

"However, after Yang Shou was captured, he knew there was no escape, so he cooperated fully and revealed everything."

"Old Huang, please tell me about evil cultivators. I still can't fully comprehend their existence. I had amnesia before, and I completely don't understand what 'evil cultivator' even means! You must know, right? After all, you've been in the War Hall." Ding Rui couldn't help but ask; he was genuinely troubled by this question.

And this was the crucial point.

Previously, he hadn't been able to concern himself with evil cultivators because he couldn't even sort out his own cultivation.

After learning of the existence of evil cultivators, he truly wanted to understand them a little.

But firstly, he found that cultivators in the Spirit Field Faction didn't have a very thorough understanding of evil cultivators; they only had hearsay knowledge.

Secondly, almost no one was willing to talk to him about it; even Ma Wen found him annoying.

He could understand this; in reality, the pace of life in the Xuanfu Sect was extremely fast.

Everyone focused on their own affairs, besides cultivation.

"The situation of evil cultivators is the same as ours. Relying solely on the spiritual energy between heaven and earth, they also cannot guarantee their cultivation speed. So, they came up with a method: seizing the True Essence of other cultivators to increase their own cultivation!"

Ding Rui's heart skipped a beat. He had already guessed that the method evil cultivators used to seize True Essence would not be pleasant.

But he still said nothing, quietly waiting for the explanation to continue.

"True Essence is energy cultivated by cultivators themselves. If not willingly given up, it's naturally very difficult for evil cultivators to seize. Not to mention, True Essence resides within our bodies, so evil cultivators naturally can't just take it directly from us. Therefore, if evil cultivators want to seize True Essence, they must kill the cultivators they are targeting!"

Old Huang spoke calmly, but beneath the calm lay hatred—an unresolvable hatred. If they wanted to live, they had to stop the evil cultivators' slaughter!

"Evil cultivators kill other cultivators, then consume them. They use their evil cultivation techniques to refine all the True Essence, spiritual energy, blood, and flesh within other cultivators' bodies into their own. And we are their prey!"

"Furthermore, after killing other cultivators, evil cultivators also use their bodies to refine spirit artifacts. Therefore, once someone becomes an evil cultivator, they become an enemy to all cultivators, including other evil cultivators themselves."
