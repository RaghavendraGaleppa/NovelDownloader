# Chapter 29: Fated Enemies, Swift Vengeance  

Li Zhengjing ultimately agreed to escort the Ghost Valley Lingguan. Even without consulting the golden page's predictions, he knew the outcome.  

Refusing the Ghost Valley Lingguan's request now would be tantamount to sealing his fate. Since the Lingguan had asked politely and offered generous compensation, why refuse kindness and invite punishment?  

*"Mainly because he offered too much..."*  

With this thought, Li Zhengjing temporarily took on the role of a coachman, driving the carriage out of Wanlin County.  

Inside the carriage sat the Wall-Climbing Bird, now sporting a horn on its head. The bird was deeply frustrated—the horn's green hue was utterly distasteful.  

*"This must be from an unorthodox dragon!"* the bird thought. *What proper dragon would have green horns?*  

In the corner of the carriage lay half of a tree trunk, gleaming gold with a glossy sheen. Its roots were tucked into a clay pot, silent and still.  

It had just been stripped of its bark, as if stripped of its clothes, then coated in wax. Humiliated, stripped of dignity and pride, it now wallowed in despair. No longer resembling the legendary Five Elements Creation Tree, it felt it had disgraced its ancestors.  

"Rumor has it that the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect recently lost a Five Elements Creation Tree," the Ghost Valley Lingguan mused. "I suppose this is the missing half. To think you'd commit such an audacious crime—no wonder you're willing to collude with me! It seems none of us—man, bird, or tree—are virtuous creatures."  

"You flatter me, Senior," replied Li Zhengjing from outside, his voice cold behind the Black-White Judge mask.  

The Wall-Climbing Bird found the remark irritating. Colluding was one thing, but why imply that *none* of them were virtuous? Wasn’t that just insulting the bird?  

It felt wronged. It had been coerced into this gang under threat—if it didn’t comply, the old man would expose its past crimes. Such treachery!  

*"Truly boarded a pirate ship,"* the bird lamented, eyeing the Five Elements Creation Tree. "Will its identity remain hidden now?"  

"This wax coating alters its appearance, and I've reshaped its form," the Lingguan explained. "Only two types of people can see through it: those with pupil-based techniques or innate divine eyes. And, of course, those who have transcended mortal limits."  

"So unless we encounter such beings, no one will recognize it as the Five Elements Creation Tree?" the bird asked skeptically. "A mere layer of wax can do that?"  

"This wax was scraped from the legendary Divine Phoenix Tree in the Ten Thousand Mountains—priceless!" the Lingguan boasted. "You’re coated in the same wax, and your bones have been restructured. Now, aside from our little group, no one will recognize you."  

"Only outlaws call themselves a gang," Li Zhengjing interjected. "With a proper Immortal Sect disciple like me, we’re a *cooperative team*."  

"Master speaks wisely!" the bird replied half-heartedly, then hesitated. "Wait, doesn’t Fan Kaihu know my identity?"  

"He’s not part of our group," the Lingguan said. "If you see him back in the sect, stay away. Associating with him brings no good."  

"Bird Master never wanted to see him anyway," the bird muttered. "Stay close to gentlemen, avoid villains—he’s a villain! Uncle, don’t look at me like that... I’m nervous. Since we’re in this together, you’re obviously not a villain."  

As the carriage moved further from Wanlin County, the atmosphere grew tense.  

"We must be cautious," the Lingguan warned. "Once I leave Wanlin County, the sect’s higher-ups will sense it."  

"I understand," Li Zhengjing replied. "Our pursuers are only below the True Qi realm?"  

"Logically, only those at the Inner Qi level," the Lingguan confirmed.  

"Why so sure?" the bird questioned. "The sect has more than just Inner Qi disciples!"  

"At the External Skill level, I could tear them apart with my bare hands," the Lingguan said calmly. "Only Inner Qi experts would force me to truly act."  

"What if they send True Qi experts?" the bird pressed.  

"None are currently active near Wanlin County. Besides, if I’m forced to strike, any True Qi expert below the Human Immortal realm will die instantly."  

The Lingguan smirked. "True Qi experts are either core disciples or inner sect elders—valuable assets. Would the sect waste them as disposable pawns?"  

"What if a Human Immortal attacks?" Li Zhengjing asked gravely.  

"I swore an oath never to use my cultivation within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect’s territory, lest I suffer backlash. The same restriction binds them."  

The Lingguan explained, "They won’t attack me within the sect’s borders. Outside, I can fight back freely, and you won’t need to escort me further."  

"So Inner Qi cultivators are just sacrificial pawns, meant to provoke you into breaking your oath," the bird realized.  

"Precisely. If I act, the oath’s backlash will kill me. Trading an Inner Qi cultivator for a notorious heretic like me—quite the bargain, no?"  

"From a strategic standpoint, it’s brilliant," the bird mused. "The sect planned this long ago—using expendable pawns to eliminate you effortlessly."  

"With Young Zhengjing here, we’ll manage," the Lingguan said.  

"What about me?" the bird protested.  

"You’re a fugitive with a new identity. If you want another transformation, feel free to expose yourself and fight."  

"No thanks! You’re on your own!" the bird snapped, burrowing into the tree pot.  

"Stupid bird! What are you doing?" the Five Elements Creation Tree shrieked, flailing its roots. "Stop digging! You’re touching my roots! Ah—I’m dead!"  

"Quiet! Someone’s coming!" the Lingguan hissed.  

Outside, Li Zhengjing halted the carriage. Behind his mask, his eyes narrowed.  

*"Fate truly has a sense of irony."*  

Before him stood four former outer sect deacons—the very ones who had conspired with Chen Youyu to swap his cultivation manual and sabotage him.  

Chen Youyu was already dead. Li Zhengjing had planned to eliminate these four eventually, but now they had delivered themselves to his doorstep.  

*"How considerate."*  

"Halt!" the leader barked. "I am Zhou Shaojie of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, patrolling this area. Surrender your weapons, kneel, and await inspection!"  

"Gladly."  

Li Zhengjing stepped forward. Inside the carriage, the Lingguan’s golden eyes gleamed through the curtain. He could sense Li Zhengjing’s murderous intent.  

*"So they have a grudge? How fortuitous."*  

Li Zhengjing recited their names coldly: "Zhou Shaojie, Fan Guilin, Wu Chi, Lin Bixiu..."  

His masked voice was icy as he drew his blade.  

"Would you four trash prefer intact corpses?"  

"Arrogant fool!" The four deacons drew their swords in fury.  

Lin Bixiu, the swiftest, struck first.  

"Die!"  

Li Zhengjing blocked the slash with his saber, then lashed out with his left hand.  

His innate divine ability activated instantly—the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi surged through his left arm, splitting it into 36,500 phantom fragments. Flames erupted.  

"Blocking a sword barehanded? Foolish!" Fan Guilin sneered.  

His blade shattered upon contact, melting into molten droplets.  

"What—?!"  

Before Fan Guilin could react, the flames consumed his upper body, reducing it to ash.  

"Daoist arts? Divine ability?!"  

"You’re a True Qi master?!"  

The remaining three paled in terror.  

Li Zhengjing, momentarily stunned by his own power, grinned.  

"Seems none of you will leave whole. Pity—I wanted to be merciful."  

His left hand turned toward Zhou Shaojie.  

Flames roared.  

Sword qi sang.  

Ashes scattered.  

Today, Li Zhengjing bathed in vengeance.  

When the dust settled, he laughed heartily.  

"Swift vengeance is truly exhilarating!"  

With a final slash, he bisected Lin Bixiu’s remains.  

"Our debt is settled."
