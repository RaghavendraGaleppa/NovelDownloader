Chapter 292: Li Mo's Dream, The Emerging Dragon and Phoenix Stir the Winds and Clouds (1/2)

Li Mo regained his consciousness in a hazy state, yet he realized he had not truly awakened.

Before his eyes lay a sky filled with dark clouds, a simple bamboo tower that seemed to grow out of the black earth, and an exceptionally luxurious altar.

Surrounding the altar were villagers with numb and confused expressions, as well as the screams of young boys and girls after the effects of the anesthetic had worn off. Floating on the river were ugly, large fish with their bellies turned upward.

Everything was reduced to only two colors, black and white. Even the blood of the dead 'River God' that stained a large area of the lake water was the same.

"Am I... dreaming?"

Li Mo had a very deep impression of the day's events.

He had arrived at this riverside town and witnessed a sacrificial ceremony.

One lives off the mountains if one is near the mountains, and off the water if one is near the water.

The people of the entire town relied on the harvest from this river to fill their bellies and support their families. However, the temper of this river was even more unpredictable than the heavens. It would stir up wind and waves every few days, making it impossible to catch fish, and it often drowned people. Occasionally, it would flood and submerge the town.

At times like these, the villagers knew that the River God was angry. The priest would then lead the villagers in a sacrifice. This year, the flood was particularly severe, so a grand sacrifice was necessary.

In their custom, the families of the boys or girls chosen by lot to be offered were considered lucky, because their children were going to follow the River God to enjoy blessings.

The parents would feed their children a 'Soul-Departing Medicine', dress them up carefully, and send them onto a lotus platform...

Li Mo saw it clearly.

The River God that swallowed the lotus platform was clearly an ugly catfish!

He did not hesitate to rush into the water. At the bottom of the river, he beat the catfish calamity beast until it spat out the children, their bodies floating on the river surface.

He had killed the River God.

When he came ashore, all the villagers surrounded him, kneeling on the ground in an orderly fashion, trembling like quails awaiting slaughter. They shouted, "The new River God has arrived in our town!"

"Do not kneel!"

"There is no River God, and I am not a god. I am just a person like you!"

Li Mo's words were firm and resonant.

However, what awaited him was not the villagers' sudden realization or their gratitude.

Instead, it was...

"If you don't accept our offerings, why did you kill the River God?"

"We knew that when the river flooded, it was because the River God was angry. If it floods again in the future, how will we know the cause?"

"Yes, if people drown then, who should we worship?"

Anger, confusion, and panic almost drowned Li Mo...

At that moment, even Li Mo couldn't help but ask himself.

"Did I... do something wrong?"

He wanted to turn around and ask her, but he found no one behind him. The surging crowd only had his lonely figure.

Huh?

"Why are you sweating so much?"

Ying Bing stared at the少年 (young man) on her lap. Her small hand brushed over his eyebrows, but could not smooth the frown on his face.

Then she heard him muttering to himself, as if talking in his dream:

"Ice Cube..."

Ying Bing's eyelashes, as beautiful as they were, trembled slightly. Her face, as cool and clear as moonlight, froze for a moment.

Had he dreamed of her?

Or was he looking for her in his dream?

It was probably the latter. After all, it was rare to see him, usually so cheerful, frown so deeply, with a hint of confusion and panic in his expression. He had never been like this before.

The girl's gaze was calm and gentle. She held his hand and said softly:

"I'm always here."

Perhaps he heard her words.

Li Mo's furrowed brow relaxed, and he stopped sweating profusely, his breathing steadying.

If the two little figures, one black and one white, were to pop out at this moment, the one who called him 'little brother' in black would probably have the upper hand.

Ying Bing held his hand and couldn't help but think this way.

Time passed.

The sun was high in the sky.

Li Mo slowly opened his eyes and yawned, feeling that this sleep was very comfortable.

---

He didn't know what he was using as a pillow; it was cool, soft, and elastic. He should use this for sleeping from now on...

Huh?

Li Mo smelled a familiar, faint fragrance and looked up.

So, a truly beautiful person is flawless from every angle. Even looking up at her from below is breathtakingly beautiful.

Her expression was serene and quiet, her clear, deep eyes gazing into the distance.

"Snore..."

Li Mo quickly closed his eyes, trying to fall asleep again, or at least pretend to be asleep...

But the next moment.

A soft, boneless hand pinched his nose.

"Are you really asleep?" Ying Bing's small hand didn't let go at all.

"Snore..."

"Looks like you're really not awake yet."

"Snore... Achoo!"

Li Mo, who was determined to keep up the act, suddenly felt an itch on the tip of his nose.

He opened his eyes and saw that the hand that had just pinched his nose was now twisting a few strands of soft, black hair. The Ice Cube had just attacked him with her hair.

"Awake?" She looked as if she was smiling but not.

"Yeah, just woke up. What just happened?"

"A bug crawled over your nose, I shooed it away."

"......Thanks."

Li Mo wiped the saliva from the corner of his mouth and got up, but his gaze couldn't help but pause again. He saw a明显的 (obvious) wet patch on Ying Bing's skirt. The wetness had even trickled a little down her thigh...

The Ming蛟 (Ming Dragon) clan is good at gathering water. Actually, he didn't use to drool when sleeping; this is a post-dragon transformation side effect...

He reached out and wiped her knee, asking:

"Should we go to Qingmu City next?"

"Probably."

"Then let's set off."

"There's one more thing before we go."

Ying Bing gave him a deep look, tied up her black hair, and inserted a jade hairpin.

"There are still two Level 6 calamity beasts."

"We'll take them on together this time."

......

Yantian Sect.

On a towering pagoda that seemed to touch the clouds and rival the stars.

The jade plate in the old woman's hand had a luster somewhat similar to the strange stone in Hengyun Sword City. She gently stroked the jade plate, a complex expression on her face.

Perhaps soon, this item would no longer be needed.

*Tap—*

Light footsteps sounded from behind. A barefoot woman walked up to her and called out softly:

"Master, the new issue of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands 'Winds and Clouds List' is all here."

The old woman grunted an "Mm," and the paper glowed faintly, projecting the information onto the void.

Her gaze swept over the lists and stopped on the Emerging Dragon List.

【Emerging Dragon List, 10th Place: Ying Bing.】
【Emerging Dragon List, 11th Place: Li Mo.】

Their martial arts were mostly the same as before.

But the changes in their battle records were earth-shattering, and the added content was quite similar.

【Battle Record: Entered the Southern Frontier, transformed into the Blue Luan Goddess (Ming Dragon of the Ming蛟 clan), stirred up winds and clouds in the Southern Frontier. Jointly slew four Level 6 calamity beasts at Sanghu Mountain: Xiangliu, Feiyi, Dafeng, Fanjiang E... and several other calamity beasts.】

【The Emerging Dragon and雏 Phoenix unite, the Four Seas and Eight Wilds are stirred by winds and clouds.】

Tian Miao hesitated for a moment and said, "Should we release all of this truthfully?"

"Truthfully."

"Yes..."
