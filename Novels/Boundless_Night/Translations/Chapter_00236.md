# Chapter 236: The Cui Family's Bloodshed

The Cui family had smiled as they shot an "information arrow," intending to skillfully manipulate the Li family into becoming their blade. However, in the end, the arrow struck their own kin.

"Call them back!" an old man roared.

Someone replied, "It's too late; they should be nearing their destination."

Several people exchanged glances, wondering what had gone wrong. Their expressions were grim. They felt it was necessary to investigate thoroughly—why, in the end, were they forced to step in personally?

***

The Li family was quite satisfied. The Cui family's radicals were rampaging across the plateau, hunting many demons. Upon hearing the news, they had all rushed over.

"To be honest, I truly hope that some grandmaster-level figures who practiced Boshu calligraphy are still alive. If the Cui family provokes them, they'll be slapped with a sound 'slap' that leaves their entire clan crippled for a hundred years."

Some members of the Li family believed that no one could cultivate Boshu calligraphy independently; one needed guidance from predecessors. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been so cautious this time.

"If that young man truly cultivated Boshu calligraphy by himself, then he's incredibly defying the heavens. We must capture him for study!"

Soon, their mood soured considerably. A spiritual bird from the front brought news: Li Qingxu, who had been traveling alone, honing himself by slaying demons, had seemingly encountered another formidable opponent. Though a full-scale battle hadn't officially begun, a single palm strike exchange earlier indicated the situation was not optimistic.

At this moment, both Xiao Wu and Li Qingxu were questioning life itself. Both wondered, how could anyone they randomly encountered be so outrageous?

In their first clash, Li Qingxu had retreated an extra step, which put him in an utterly terrible mood. Was he doomed to suffer two defeats in a single day? Moreover, this was yet another young man who walked an unconventional path!

Xiao Wu's brows were deeply furrowed. He had recently collected and carefully studied the data on various Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds, but this masked person wasn't among them. He started doubting his own strength. Was he truly inferior to Brother Ming at the same realm, and even to those near-Immortal Seeds? He had casually encountered a "savage" and merely made the opponent retreat an extra step; he should have crushed them!

"I need to reflect. From now on, I must redouble my bitter cultivation," Wu Yaozu muttered, extremely dissatisfied with his performance. As for the present, he naturally intended to first overthrow the masked man.

***

Qin Ming had swept through the area, gaining a significant harvest. Occasionally, he would return some demon heads to Jin Xiang for safekeeping. In truth, with memory crystals, the loss of spoils wasn't a major issue.

Some areas on the plateau lacked trees and were covered in waist-high grasslands. Qin Ming noticed spiritual birds watching him in the night sky and sensed rapidly approaching malice. He abruptly stopped.

The grass rustled violently as four figures arrived, bringing with them a strong gust of wind. Qin Ming remained outwardly composed, but inwardly he was far from calm. These were members of the Cui family. Although not intimately familiar, he had seen them all before. He reflected, where had he exposed himself?

"Chonghe, no, Qin Ming, is that you? Little brother!" A young woman among them approached, even calling him "little brother" with an air of deep emotion.

After reaching the Second Realm, Qin Ming's perception was incredibly sharp, especially after their spiritual resonance earlier, which allowed him to sense their hidden malice.

Cui Xueying, appearing to be in her early twenties, had jet-black hair, phoenix eyes, and vibrant red lips. She was renowned for her beauty among the younger generation of the Cui family, though her cultivation achievements were ordinary. She followed the Esoteric path and was currently in the mid-Second Realm. In the past, they had few interactions.

"Qin Ming, you're practically our brother. I didn't expect to meet you here," a young man said. He was a disciple from the Outer Yang Earth and had reached the late Second Realm. His name was Cui Chongsheng, a direct descendant of the Cui family and the paternal grandson of Cui Fifth Elder. Cui Fifth Elder had held young Qin Ming firmly in his grasp back then, precisely he who had fooled the child Qin Ming into persistently practicing Boshu calligraphy and not to diverge into other methods, blocking all his other paths. Cui Chongsheng was a few years older than Qin Ming and had long known the latter's true origins. Thus, like his older cousins, even when they were in the Cui family, they treated Cui Chonghe's "substitute" with indifference.

The old man in the grassland was named Cui Changkong. His body was robust and thick, with a full head of white hair like rough beast fur. He was a head taller than ordinary people and bore some demonic traits; horns grew on his head. He followed the path of mutation, able to transform from human to beast, becoming an aberration. Qin Ming was wary of him; this man was in the Third Realm, a person who could threaten his life.

The last young man was Cui Chongyun, the old man's paternal grandson. Among the four, he was the weakest, currently in the early Second Realm and a disciple of the Immortal Path.

"Sirs, you are..." Qin Ming naturally wouldn't admit it directly, feigning confusion and stepping back to create distance. In truth, he knew this was useless. Given the Cui family's nature, once they suspected something, they would treat it as confirmed, even if it meant killing the wrong person.

"Little brother, how can you be like this? Won't you acknowledge us? We truly consider you family," Cui Xueying blinked her beautiful eyes, sighing.

Such words were merely for show. Qin Ming was certain their earlier malice was genuine.

"Cousin, you don't have to hide from us!" Cui Chongsheng said, still as emotionless as before when facing Qin Ming, with a cold expression.

Undoubtedly, they weren't certain this was Qin Ming, but had rushed over immediately upon receiving a secret report. Just as Qin Ming understood them, suspicion alone was enough. The Cui family operated with such tyranny: capture the person first, then verify their identity later.

"Sirs, don't make things difficult for me. I don't know you," Qin Ming gripped his blade, preparing to defend himself.

With a whoosh, except for the weakest Cui Chongyun, the other three surrounded him, blocking his escape in three directions. In their view, with Cui Changkong present, even if their suspected target was incredibly heaven-defying, he wouldn't be able to stir up any trouble. Moreover, if it really was Qin Ming, how long had he been cultivating? Less than a year. Cui Chongsheng, in the late Second Realm, was absolutely confident he could immediately subdue the person before him.

He indeed acted on that confidence, striking with lethal intent from the start. He held a spiritual blade, which bloomed with conscious spiritual light, and slashed forward at extreme speed.

In such a critical moment, Qin Ming naturally held nothing back. His life was at stake; the Cui family's intentions were malevolent, and he treated this as a life-or-death battle!

With a clang, the Mutton-fat Jade Iron Blade was drawn. In an instant, a burst of incomparably dazzling saber light, captivating and awe-inspiring, rose like a burning sun from the sea, then fiercely blazed, illuminating the entire area. Cui Chongsheng's spiritual blade was quite extraordinary, inscribed with various runes that could amplify conscious spiritual light. Yet, in terms of sheer durability, it was utterly incomparable to the Mutton-fat Jade Iron Blade.

The spiritual blade snapped, cleaved in two with a single strike.

Qin Ming, in full burst, moved like a demonic shadow, silent and swift as lightning. In the blink of an eye, he advanced, carving out a dazzling blade aura.

"Ah!" Cui Chongsheng screamed. His right arm fell to the ground. In a single exchange, this late Second Realm expert suffered a devastating loss, half his body covered in blood. He felt as if it was all unreal. He retreated explosively, while resentfully glaring at Cui Changkong. A grand expert of the Third Realm guarding here, and yet he still lost an arm! Cui Chongsheng was filled with indignation, frustration, and intense resentment.

Cui Changkong was speechless. He wanted to say: Why are you glaring at me? Are you trash? A late Second Realm expert, and you had an arm chopped off in one move? That's too absurd. He had originally stood still, believing that with him here, the overall situation was decided. He truly hadn't anticipated this outcome. Cui Chongsheng, feeling that gaze, was again hit by pain, anger, and hatred.

Cui Xueying retreated. Cui Chongyun, the furthest away, tensed his body. They all felt it was somewhat surreal. No one knew Qin Ming's background better than they did. He had only embarked on the path of new life less than a year ago. Was he a reincarnated deity? To actually be able to fell a grand expert of the late Second Realm.

Now, they believed it: Qin Ming had truly cultivated Boshu calligraphy!

Cui Changkong was closing in. With every step he took, the grassland trembled as if a colossal beast was striding ferociously. He spoke, "Quickly reattach your arm; it can still heal."

However, when Cui Chongsheng picked up his severed arm from the ground, it exploded with a *噗* sound. The residual Heavenly Radiance Force within it was too overbearing, destroying everything. Cui Changkong's face darkened. Failing to preserve his grandson's arm made him lose some face.

During this process, he approached unhurriedly, while Qin Ming retreated. The disparity in their aura strength was clear at a glance. Qin Ming felt uncertain. In the past, every time he encountered a Third Realm expert, if the opponent was unharmed, he would suffer a huge loss, barely escaping with his life.

"Watch carefully," Cui Changkong said, radiating a jade-like glow. His body half-beastialized, his upper torso transforming into a rhinoceros. He charged forward fiercely.

At this moment, Qin Ming did not evade. He lunged at Cui Changkong. Just as both seemed unavoidable and were about to collide, a dazzling light suddenly shone forth. Qin Ming's right hand was covered in a piece of tattered cloth, and in front of it was a black meteorite. He fully unleashed his Heavenly Radiance Force, activating the essence of starfire, like a great sun exploding.

For a brief instant, he experienced that feeling of invincibility again, as if he could cut through all things and incinerate the night sky. In a flash, his consumption was immense. The Heavenly Radiance and the Starfire essence fused, like an immortal sword unsheathing, piercing through the old man's chest. Then, firelight blazed, and a burnt smell permeated the air.

"Ah..." Cui Changkong shrieked miserably, staggering backward, even more wretched than Cui Chongsheng. A large hole appeared in his chest, clear from front to back, pierced and utterly burned through by the sword-light formed by the fusion of Heavenly Radiance and Starfire essence. Half of his heart was gone, and a large portion of his lung was missing. He suffered unprecedented severe injuries. This was an abnormal battle. In that instant counter-attack, the surging Starfire essence was something even a Third Realm initial stage expert couldn't withstand.

Cui Chongsheng turned and fled, cursing inwardly: "You old fossil, a Third Realm expert, yet even worse than me, getting your chest pierced right away!"

"Hm?" He felt something was wrong. Why was he falling? Soon, he was terrified. His head landed on the ground, while his body... lay behind him. He had been decapitated, only realizing it belatedly after Qin Ming caught up and chopped him down with one strike!

"Ah..." In the distance, Cui Chongyun shrieked. He had fled far away, but still couldn't escape death. His heart was pierced by one arrow, and then a second arrow flew, shattering his head like a watermelon. At the same time, the two spiritual birds in the night sky also exploded, almost simultaneously shot down!

"Grandson!" Cui Changkong roared, his eyes bloodshot. Cui Chongyun was his paternal grandson, and he had watched the young man die violently before his eyes.

"Don't worry, you and your grandson will be reunited soon!" Qin Ming secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He wasn't sure if he could kill a Third Realm initial stage expert in a normal duel, but now he didn't have to worry about it.

"Qin Ming, don't do this..." Cui Xueying retreated, her face pale, her heart chilling. She truly hadn't expected such a crushing defeat, even with an elder expert accompanying them.

*Puff!*

Finally, her expression froze. A gleaming saber light flashed, crimson blood splattered, and her head flew off.
