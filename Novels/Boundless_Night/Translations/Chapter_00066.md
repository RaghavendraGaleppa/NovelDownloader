# Chapter 66: From Now On, I Live Only for Myself

Qin Ming's head throbbed, as if a dull axe was repeatedly hacking at his skull, making him feel like his head was shattered, his vision darkened, and he was in so much pain he wanted to faint.

He took a deep breath, but he still couldn't control himself. His steps faltered, his emotions fluctuating violently, like a blazing fire consuming him.

"Why are you doing this to me?" he whispered in agony. He had made many guesses, but he had never imagined that it was his parents who wanted Cui Hong to treat him this way.

This feeling was like his soul was being torn apart piece by piece, causing his body to tremble. It hurt even more than when the feathered-robe youth had used a shimmering purple bamboo stick to break his arm and shatter his skull that day.

Qin Ming staggered backward, fragmented images appearing in his mind. No wonder, during his third rebirth, he had dipped his finger in coarse tea and written a single character on the table: '棄' (abandon).

Now, he recalled more. Before he was found by the feathered-robe youth, when he lived in that peaceful village, he had silently written the character '棄' on that very night.

Even when the village was swallowed by a sudden fire, breached by a large group of experts with earth-shattering battle cries, he remained silent. Facing the life-or-death tribulation, he watched calmly, not uttering a single word.

"Did I not want to speak then? Did I seem to have an early premonition of what would happen? Was it extreme disappointment? Perhaps also heartache and loss." Qin Ming stood in the desolate wilderness, enduring the intense pain in his head, feeling as if an old wound from the past was being ripped open, re-experiencing torment.

He clearly saw that even as he was about to be engulfed by the great fire, the expression on his face remained unchanged. In the end, he even looked towards the sky, gazing at the dark night with a sense of relief, as if he had completely let go of everything.

"Did I actually feel a sense of liberation at the last moment? Had I anticipated it? When it truly arrived, I was able to face it calmly."

Qin Ming stood in the desolate wilderness, his eyes bloodshot, looking at his past self. He felt unwilling, indignant, and resentful for his two-year-old self—an emotion that surged from the depths of his heart.

"Young Master Chonghe, what's wrong with you?" Cui Hong, seeing his state, felt a pang of pity and wanted to step forward.

"Don't come over yet!" Qin Ming said in a low voice.

Before his eyes was an endless inferno, and almost being crushed by burning roof beams. At that time, he simply didn't care about life or death.

Two years ago, for some unknown reason, he let out a final sigh in silence, seemingly letting go of everything.

But now, he was truly unwilling!

"Because I was nearly beaten to death by that feathered-robe youth, I lost a lot of memories. Is that why I can't let go of that past now? I can't understand why I felt relieved at the last moment on that night two years ago."

Qin Ming stood in the desolate wilderness, enduring the intense pain as he recalled.

More fragmented images surged forth, like a dense forest of long spears, or a cold phalanx of long blades, mercilessly striking his mind, threatening to tear him apart.

It was another night, and he saw many people.

This must have been an earlier scene, before he met the feathered-robe youth. He was surrounded by a large group of people, separating from those of the Cui family.

Opposite him stood a middle-aged man and woman, watching him board a bronze carriage engraved with cloud patterns.

The middle-aged man said nothing, appearing very stern. His eyes seemed to penetrate people's hearts as he calmly watched him leave.

The woman, appearing to be in her early thirties, wore a magnificent palace dress with her cloud-like hair piled high, secured by a golden flowing feather as a hairpin. There was no ripple on her delicate face as she watched Qin Ming depart.

Many elders nearby, brimming with vitality, seemed to be awed by the aura of these two individuals, maintaining a certain distance, otherwise feeling quite uncomfortable.

At that time, Qin Ming couldn't help but look back, only to see their backs. The middle-aged man and woman had already left with their people. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out.

Although the image was fragmented and blurry, Qin Ming could clearly feel that he had strong emotional fluctuations at that time, as if facing a life-and-death separation, with reluctance, endless loss, and a hint of resentment.

"Chonghe, are you alright?" Cui Hong showed a worried expression.

Qin Ming looked at him and said, "I'm actually doing quite well now. It would be even better if you hadn't appeared again!"

His headache had somewhat subsided. He touched his face and found tear stains, unsure when they had flowed. He felt a bit annoyed and wiped them clean.

Such cheap liquid was not something he should have now. The past was long gone, it should be discarded. What was there to cry about?

Qin Ming's face remained expressionless as he said, "I always thought I had done something wrong, but only now do I realize that I shouldn't have wronged you, nor failed the Cui family. And yet you've sought me out again. What more do you want?"

Cui Hong said, "I came here for two reasons: one is to seek the Yin-Yang Great Medicine, and the other is for your matter. We will arrange a residence for you, and someone will protect Young Master. There's no need for you to travel far to venture into the outside world."

"You want to destroy my future with a single sentence?!" Qin Ming's eyes sharpened, even turning red. He had gone through so much, suffered severe injuries, was covered in blood, and was like a beggar in the ice and snow. If it weren't for the people of Twin Tree Village taking him in, he would have died long ago.

Now, with a casual word, they wanted to permanently confine him to this remote place. Why? Everything he had now was gained by risking his life in the mountains, without using even a single resource from the Cui family.

Cui Hong fell silent, guilt and unwillingness rising again. But this was his mission; how could he return without completing it?

After a long time, he spoke very seriously: "Chonghe, you must have changed to cultivating the local New Life cultivation method, right? After all, the method on the silk scroll cannot be cultivated without the guidance of predecessors. And these local New Life methods are not considered profound; it's difficult to achieve great success even if you cultivate them to the end. Even if you work incredibly hard and exhaust your effort, at most you will only become an expert in this small place. If you truly go out, you will be very dim, not considered a dazzling expert outside. So, why don't you cut off your path of rebirth while you're still at the beginning? Live a peaceful and prosperous life here. Someone will protect and care for you. What's wrong with that?"

Fire surged within Qin Ming. His path, his life, why should others arrange it for him?

He asked, "As long as I pursue rebirth, whether it's the method on the silk scroll or other New Life methods, you will follow orders to stop me and attack me, right?"

Cui Hong remained silent.

"My parents' decision..." Qin Ming looked at the dark desolate wilderness, feeling a deep sense of powerlessness amidst endless indignation.

The past hardships had forced him to face death, he had even died once, but he had never feared it. However, a blow from kinship and human nature caught him off guard.

All the fragmented, incomplete, and missing images from before and after, allowed Qin Ming to vaguely guess something from that 'abandon' character. Abandoned child, chess piece—whichever it was, it made his breathing heavy. He could not come to terms with it now.

He was certain that not only had he not wronged the Cui family, but he had also once sacrificed his life, surviving by the skin of his teeth, only to be sent to this remote place.

Before Qin Ming's eyes, fire blazed, and blurry images flashed in quick succession. He became increasingly convinced that many people in the Cui family had known beforehand what would happen that night.

"Are they pushing me out to take the fall?"

But he couldn't understand why, even when he had fallen to such a state, the Cui family, or more precisely, his parents, would still do this.

What he once thought was illusory gradually became real. How utterly despairing he must have been in the past to believe that life was false and pieced together, all because some beliefs in his heart had collapsed.

Cui Hong said nothing, walking forward. Although his heart was filled with regret, he was still preparing to act.

"Can you tell me everything I've experienced?" Qin Ming suddenly spoke. He pointed to his head and said, "You should have witnessed what happened that night. My skull was shattered in three places by that feathered-robe youth. I've forgotten many things. Even if you want to act, let me at least understand clearly what I'm going through."

"What?" Cui Hong's expression changed dramatically. He was deeply surprised, and also filled with self-reproach and guilt. "I didn't know you had even lost your memory. This is our fault. We should have rushed there faster. I apologize, Young Master Chonghe."

His emotions were also highly agitated. He said, "Chonghe, I am definitely not here to kill you. I only want to neutralize your path of rebirth. After this, no one will target Young Master again. You can marry and have children here, free from disputes!"

"How is that any different from killing me? I just want to embark on the path of rebirth; this is the future I chose for myself. What right do you have to sever it?" Qin Ming asked loudly at this point, "I've completely forgotten the past, with only fragmented memories left. What else are you worried about?"

"How could this be?!" At the edge of the desolate wilderness, an exclamation came from the winding path. Li Qingyue, in her feathered robe, appeared.

Beside her, in addition to her maid and two golden-armored men, was Meng Xinghai, the new City Lord of Crimson Cloud City.

In the desolate wilderness, there was a profound silence.

Cui Hong did not retreat, looking at the youth before him.

Qin Ming realized that the other party was ultimately going to act. He spoke, "A humble family, my neighbors, a very ordinary couple can take good care of their two children, full of kinship and warmth, protecting them with their lives. A thousand-year-old aristocratic family? From this point on, we will have no further dealings. Let us just abandon it."

At this moment, a voice in Qin Ming's heart seemed to sigh, telling him that everything was in the past, that they were his parents, that he shouldn't blame them, that it was right for him to give something, and that he should just leave.

However, he shook his head, unable to be calm.

"I've died once already. From now on, I am no longer Cui Chonghe. The one who has come back to life is Qin Ming. From this moment, I only want to live for myself!" Qin Ming shouted loudly in the desolate wilderness.
