# Chapter 20: Xiao Shiye

Nearly three months later, in the Di-fire Furnace Chamber.

Lu Yang, trembling, slowly stood up.

No, it wasn't so much "standing" as "floating," for at this moment, he no longer possessed flesh, skin, tendons, or bones; he was a crimson blood-shadow!

"I did it!"

The blood-shadow had no face, only a slightly distorted voice that vibrated amidst shimmering light: "Eighty-one days, and I've finally refined it!"

The next second, the blood-shadow gradually retracted. The shed skin on the ground flew up out of thin air, "donned" by the blood-shadow. His pale skin was slowly infused with crimson, and his shriveled flesh gradually plumped up. In a short while, a completely unharmed Lu Yang reappeared within the furnace chamber.

At first glance, he appeared no different from an ordinary person.

In fact, compared to three months prior, Lu Yang's vital energy was even more immense. His robust true qi subtly congealed into a qi seed.

Qi Condensation Seventh Layer, late stage!

Perhaps the process of cultivating this divine ability was too painful, an unimaginable ordeal for his essence, qi, and spirit, which unexpectedly helped him break through his cultivation bottleneck.

Even more fortunately, this happened before he had fully mastered the divine ability.

Had it been after mastering the divine ability, even breaking through the bottleneck would have been useless. For instance, now, his cultivation had permanently halted at the Qi Condensation Seventh Layer.

"But it's enough..." Lu Yang murmured softly. Possessing the [Hundred-Life Tome], he never fixated on achievements in a single life. His goal was always how to best utilize them in the next.

"Let's test its power!"

As Lu Yang's thought arose, a magnificent Sword Pill instantly appeared between his brows. His figure then transformed into a streak of bloody light, merging with the Sword Pill.

"Rumble!"

Outside Wanbao Peak, as the ground shook violently, the bustling crowd suddenly swayed, and several people directly tumbled to the ground.

"What's going on?"

"An earth dragon turning over... Impossible, with the True Immortals suppressing the earth veins, how could an earth dragon turn over?"

The disciples exchanged bewildered glances. Among them, those with higher cultivation suddenly felt something, subconsciously looking in a certain direction, astonishment slowly appearing in their eyes.

"Look!"

"That is..."

Everyone's gaze followed suit.

Immediately after, everyone witnessed a rainbow-like long streak of light piercing the sky, erupting from a furnace chamber. In a blink, it soared into the heavens, churning the sea of clouds wherever it passed.

Clang! Clang!

Crisp sword cries resonated through the nine heavens. The intense red light dyed Wanbao Peak crimson, drawing in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, which even transformed into a monstrous tidal wave!

Caught within such a massive surge of spiritual energy, most disciples found themselves unable to even breathe, almost suffocating!

"Such momentum, Qi Condensation late stage?"

A disciple wore an envious expression: "This is a Qi Seed already formed. Just one final step of nurturing, and it will be complete, with Foundation Establishment clearly in sight..."

"I wonder which senior brother broke through?"

"I've seen senior brothers at the Qi Condensation late stage before, but none had such spiritual pressure. That rainbow-like sword light is probably an extraordinary magic treasure as well..."

Meanwhile, above the sea of clouds.

Lu Yang, transformed into a blood-shadow, merged his qi with sword light. His spiritual sense spread out in all directions, revealing everything within a radius of over ten li with perfect clarity, like observing lines on his palm.

"Qi Condensation late stage, true qi sinks into the Dantian, transforming into a Qi Seed, triggering a metamorphosis of essence, qi, and spirit. If I still had a physical body, my physique would undergo a qualitative leap at this moment; invulnerability to blades and spears would be common, and my true qi would multiply dozens of times. Unfortunately, only my spiritual sense remains now..."

As Lu Yang mused, his eyebrow suddenly lifted.

"Who's there?"

Before Lu Yang's words had faded, his sword light instantly followed his will. The crimson, rainbow-like sword light directly tore through the sea of clouds, revealing a young, handsome figure.

"Senior Brother, please don't strike! Don't strike!"

The person shouted loudly, but Lu Yang paid him no mind. The sword light surged forward. Seeing this, the person hastily took out a small flag and planted it in the air.

The next second, the flag unfurled, transforming into a pair of banner gates.

The person dodged into one of the banner gates. Only after Lu Yang's separated sword light pursued him in did he emerge from the other gate, then with a wave of his hand.

The banner gates vanished, reverting into a small flag.

Lu Yang's eyebrow lifted, realizing that the sword light he had unleashed was somehow trapped in an unknown place, and the opponent had evaded it.

"Interesting..."

Lu Yang grinned, his Sword Pill between his brows vibrating violently, like muffled thunder rolling through the sky. In an instant, it split into dozens, even hundreds of sword lights, like a peacock fanning its tail.

Upon seeing this, the young man, who had been somewhat smug, instantly changed his expression. He hastily retrieved his small flag magic treasure to protect himself, while loudly proclaiming: "Senior Brother, I am Xiao Shiye. I merely came to make your acquaintance, with absolutely no ill intentions. Please put away your divine ability."

"Xiao Shiye?"

Lu Yang was startled upon hearing this. Then, the sword light that was about to erupt abruptly paused, hovering in mid-air, illuminating a face covered in cold sweat.

That predetermined shill?

The next second, Lu Yang retracted his sword light, transforming back into human form and landing before Xiao Shiye. He laughed heartily, "Junior Brother, don't misunderstand, I was just playing a trick on you!"

Xiao Shiye wiped the sweat from his forehead upon hearing this, inwardly grumbling that Lu Yang had clearly intended to be serious just now. Yet, on his face, he also displayed a brilliant smile, solicitously saying, "Senior Brother's divine abilities are vast, and your magic power boundless. Xiao is truly impressed. Please don't refuse this small token of my regard."

With that, he casually handed over the small flag in his hand.

"How could I possibly accept this..."

Lu Yang shook his head while taking the small flag. Only then did he see two words on the flag's surface: "Dun Kong" (Void Evasion), embroidered in golden thread.

"This treasure is called the Void Evasion Banner," Xiao Shiye proactively introduced. "Junior Brother acquired it from an antique shop before entering the sect. It didn't seem extraordinary at first, but after I joined the sect, I discovered it was a wondrous treasure."

"The banner has two sides. When activated, it can transform into two banner gates: one of life and one of death."

"Within the same cultivation realm, as long as one enters through the Gate of Death and exits through the Gate of Life, no matter how great the danger, one can find a way out, with no calamities touching the body."

Lu Yang's face twitched uncontrollably upon hearing this.

Such a miraculous magic treasure, yet Xiao Shiye just casually bought it from a mortal antique shop before he even entered the Sacred Sect to cultivate?

Thinking of this, Lu Yang suddenly had an idea and concentrated his spiritual sense into his eyes.

At the late stage of Qi Condensation, with his spiritual sense greatly expanded, many wondrous uses naturally became available. The technique Lu Yang was using at this moment was a mysterious art called "Aura-gazing Art."

He didn't look, it was fine. But once he looked, Lu Yang's eyes nearly popped out of his head.

Because in his eyes, Xiao Shiye, from head to toe—his crane cloak, boots, robes, headwear, and even his waist sash—all radiated with treasure light!

In terms of quality, they probably weren't inferior to his own Sword Pill!

Even with Lu Yang's current disposition, a sense of imbalance inevitably arose.

After all, the magic treasure he had spent several months and vast sums of money to refine was, on Xiao Shiye's side, seemingly everywhere and cheap, making it impossible not to feel envious.

"This person has such great fortune..."

If Lu Yang had previously thought that Xiao Shiye winning the great prize from the Merit Pool was due to some rigged, behind-the-scenes manipulation, he now changed his mind.

Could it really just be his good luck?

Thinking of this, Lu Yang's expression gradually turned peculiar.

With such high fortune, it could be said that simply following him would surely lead to many opportunities. Moreover, his cultivation wasn't high, making it particularly easy to "snatch" from him...

This Xiao Shiye, he really seems like a *resource*!
