Chapter 187: Sword Heart Clarity, Thank You for Your Bright Moon

The Sword Pavilion radiated divine light, obscuring the sun as if manifesting the will of the gods. Even the Cloud Ladder was stained a pale gold, resembling a path to ascension.

Ying Bing looked up at the towering greatsword, her eyes trembling.

She naturally wouldn't be rejected by the Cloud Ladder, nor would she feel its pressure. She was merely contemplating...

Should she go up?

What meaning is there in ascending if one's Sword Heart is not clear?

But if she wishes to comprehend the true meaning of the Divine Sky Heart and walk this path, then...

All future paths, she might have to walk alone.

"What's wrong with her?"

"I could finish half of this Cloud Ladder, is she perhaps afraid to go up?"

"That shouldn't be... on the stage, no one could even take three of her sword strikes. How could she be afraid?"

"Is there some trick to this?"

The noisy discussions reached her ears.

"Hm?"

Yin Mianmian, the plain-looking woman, also cast her gaze over.

The elders frowned, puzzled.

For a girl of her talent, this Cloud Ladder should be nothing more than a formality. Why did she seem to be in a dilemma?

Fragments of chaotic scenes flashed before Ying Bing's eyes.

On one side was power, solitude, coldness, and loneliness. On the other side was everything that had happened since her rebirth, vivid and real. Both were deeply rooted in her heart, impossible to dispel. Her spiritual soul fluctuated violently because of it.

"Ice Cube."

Suddenly, a voice cut through the noise and entered her ears.

She looked up to see the young man also showing a difficult expression.

Little Li was suffering inside. That inexplicable pressure was growing stronger and stronger. It wasn't acting on his physical body, but on his spiritual soul! It was absurd. He hadn't felt anything like this when he ascended the Stone Steps to the Heavens!

Could it be because this Cloud Ladder was condensed from Sword Intent, and he was an insulator to the Sword Dao? That didn't make sense either. For example, Zhong Zhenyue obviously didn't have a strong Sword Dao talent, yet he was still walking briskly.

It was truly strange.

He had no time to dwell on the reason. At this moment, he had to bear the pressure on his spiritual soul while maintaining a calm exterior on the surface. It seemed he could only use that method...

As is well known, Little Li was a genius, so after some deep thought, he really came up with a possible solution.

[Congratulations, Host. Ten years of martial arts insight have been successfully injected.]

[Year 1: You follow the dual-cultivation manual, exploring how to merge spirits and resonate spiritually.]

...

[Year 10: You gain an epiphany. The key lies in the spiritual soul. If the compatibility between the two souls is too poor, the second level of "Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh" can never be completed.]

He looked at Ying Bing and said, "The second level of 'Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh,' do you remember it?"

"Phoenix... Singing in the Heavenly Marsh?" A trace of confusion appeared in Ying Bing's clear, deep eyes, but she still nodded gently.

"Then, come here." Li Mo extended his hand toward her.

Ying Bing: "?"

As is also well known, "Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh" is a dual-cultivation martial art.

Dual-cultivation? Here?

As she hesitated in confusion, her slender hand suddenly felt a warmth. It was Li Mo, who had brought Little Princess Jiang back with him, taking her hand.

Warm and powerful.

Ying Bing discovered that the internal conflict in her heart had suddenly vanished, as if it had never existed. Why was this? Why had her spiritual soul suddenly quieted down?

The two had shared more intimate contact before. Just holding hands wasn't much... This wasn't normal.

Ying Bing looked up abruptly, but saw that pair of familiar eyes was even more familiar than before. Mirrored in them, there was actually a faint shadow of the moon.

Almost by instinct, the essentials of the "Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh" second level surfaced in her mind, and she began to circulate it.

This supreme art allowed the two spiritual souls to merge and spirits to connect.

Thus, the moon he had evoked also illuminated her acupoints.

It was also the Great Yin.

But this clarity was not cold, nor was it lifeless.

It filled the world with a tranquility and tenderness like water.

This... was the Great Yin he perceived?

But it was clearly different from what she saw, yet strangely familiar.

"Hu... let's go." Li Mo let out a sigh of relief.

After circulating their energy, he too had seen the Bronze Divine Tree and the Great Yin in Ying Bing's eyes. However, he didn't react too much. The moment their spiritual souls merged, the pressure on their bodies vanished instantly.

And so, Li Mo, with Little Princess Jiang sticking to his back and holding the dazed Ice Cube by the hand, strode forward. They walked into the blue sky, leaving the clamor behind.

"???"
"Wait, Ying Bing wasn't moving because she was waiting for Young Hero Li to hold her hand?"
"Guys, I suddenly feel this Martial Arts Summit is meaningless. I'm leaving."
"Bro..."
"This is the real-life version of 'Jiang Chen' and 'Liu Wuyan'! It's a pity Young Hero Li didn't smirk, it's missing a bit of the vibe."

After a moment of silence at the scene, the discussions were endless.

On the high platform, the elders looked at each other, speechless.

"If I'm not mistaken, they seem to be..." Elder Zeng muttered to himself.
"Exactly, dual-cultivation."
"Mm, and the level of that dual-cultivation method isn't low either."

Another elder's mouth twitched.
Everyone: "..."
We're all old folks, is this what we came to see?
In the past, when ascending the tower, it was always a competition of prodigies. Even if not full of tension, no one wanted to be outdone. What are these two little rascals up to?
"They're not treating us as humans!"
"Am I not a human? Am I not a human?!"
"Elder Zeng, you're the presiding elder for this event, say something!"

Thus, Elder Zeng slammed the table and stood up, his expression excited:
"Hehe... good, good, good! Jiang Chen has finally shown his boyfriend power!"

"????"

...

Above the Cloud Ladder, they walked higher and higher.

Ying Bing was led on a stroll through the clouds. The common world lay beneath her feet, just like when she once looked down upon the mortal world from the桂 Palace (Osmanthus Palace). But now, she wasn't alone. Because she could see the different bright moon within the young man's spiritual soul.

She was originally the Great Yin Moon Phoenix body. She was extremely sensitive to the mysteries of the Great Yin, and with the guidance of the dual-cultivation method, she saw what he saw.

The heavy confusion in her heart was illuminated at this moment, and enlightenment came naturally.

"My heart is clear as a bright mirror. No matter what is reflected in the mirror, the mirror itself is transparent."

The peak of the Sword Pavilion was getting closer.

"It's finally almost done." Li Mo smelled a faint, unknown fragrance, and the heavy stone in his heart was lifted. The Sword Immortal Li hadn't fallen from grace! It was all thanks to the Ice Cube...

"Li... Big Brother Li."
"Hm?"
"Sister Bing, she seems to have had an epiphany."
"Huh????"

Li Mo was stunned.

The spiritual soul merging with his transmitted a strong fluctuation. He looked back, and their eyes met.

There was a smile on Ying Bing's lips, very faint, but it truly existed.

*Hummm—*

A sword chant resonated between heaven and earth, seemingly real and illusory, shaking the Cloud Ladder. This time, it wasn't Little Li manually adding a five-cent special effect.

Thousands of swords cried out, as if wanting to leap from their hands. Even the massive Sword Pavilion seemed to tremble.

Li Mo was currently connected to Ying Bing's spiritual soul. He felt it too.

From the top of the Sword Pavilion, a call of ethereal quality rang out.

But Li Mo didn't have the mind to perceive it carefully. He only heard the Ice Cube say softly:

"Thank you for your bright moon."
