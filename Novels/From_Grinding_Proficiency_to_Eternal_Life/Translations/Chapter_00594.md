Chapter 594: A Fierce Monkey from a Black Myth

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated and said, "Lead the way immediately."

Yang Jian had no objection. Having been twisted and indoctrinated by the Banner Spirit, he was now loyal to the banner master, aside from hoping that more people from the Heavenly Realm could leave, giving them a chance to rebuild in the future.

Xu Yunfan naturally knew Yang Jian's thoughts. He felt a bit of a headache looking at the Ten Thousand Soul Banner—no, the Star Spirit Banner.

No wonder the Ten Thousand Soul Banner was rated by the Primordial Origin Sect as one of the must-refine magic treasures. Not only did it have considerable growth potential, but it also contained all kinds of mysteries within.

Indoctrinating the banner spirit to only obey the banner master was just a basic function.

Following Xu Yunfan's will, the Star Spirit Banner in his sleeve hummed, and a deep, dark light shone forth. It transformed into a profound streamer that pierced through the void, like a wound torn open in the night, pointing directly west.

He transformed into a streak of light and followed closely.

The scenery along the way was the very picture of a dead end.

As time passed, the spiritual energy of this world was gradually drying up. The majestic palace ruins, as large as mountains, lay toppled on the dried-up and fractured rivers of the immortal realm. The once vibrant immortal mountains were drained of all life by an invisible force, turning into massive, bone-like stones.

The starlight reflected in the firmament was no longer brilliant and beautiful but like thick, nauseating tears of blood. Pulled by an invisible force, they flowed chaotically toward a bottomless abyss of darkness.

The devouring force of the laws from the Spirit Ruin Realm of Great Clarity grew increasingly clear, like the grating sound of a giant beast gnawing on bones, echoing on the spiritual level.

It had a somewhat new Cthulhu-style vibe.

Xu Yunfan silently retracted his gaze, guarding his mind.

The aura emanating from the devouring of a world was too high-level. Looking at it too much could easily trap one's own consciousness.

In less than two or three hours, a towering black stone cliff suddenly appeared on the desolate and ruined land ahead.

Its form was strange and ferocious, with five peaks splitting toward the sky like fingers, as if it were a giant divine hand struggling to emerge from the depths of the earth, trying to tear the sky apart.

Its entire body was dark and heavy, exuding a metallic cold light, and a heavy aura of suppression spread from it. It was the Five-Finger Cliff in the west.

In the deepest part where the giant fingers intertwined and closed together, an extremely weak yet tenacious aura, like that of geothermal magma, faintly transmitted.

Ferocious!

Unyielding!

A wildness that seemed to want to pierce the sky!

Though the aura was weak, it was like an undying spark, stubbornly jumping in the cold dead land.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed slightly. Through the resonance of auras, he naturally knew he had come to the right place.

He slowly descended, his true cultivation operating silently. The protective spiritual light formed by his magic power isolated the fierce killing intent that permeated the bottom of the cliff.

He focused his gaze.

In the dark shadows, like a cage formed by the interlaced gaps of the giant fingers, a small cluster of remaining monkey fur was like a withered flame.

Half a head, almost buried in dust and stone fragments, struggled to be raised. Two golden eyes, once as bright as the sun, were now dim like two pieces of charcoal buried deep in the ground. However, in their depths, a stubborn fire still burned.

The corners of its mouth were frozen with dirty blood and solidified stone fragments. Every time it struggled, it pulled at the remaining golden light of the Buddhist seal. The light, like a red-hot branding iron, sizzled and burned the remaining fur and bones.

When those eyes saw Xu Yunfan descending, they stared at him fiercely, filled with an untamable wildness.

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows.

What a fierce monkey, with such a big temper!

A hoarse roar, like the sound of a broken bellows mixed with the friction of bones being dislocated, squeezed out from the monkey's throat.

"Where did this filthy worm come from, daring to disturb your Grandpa Sun!"

Every word squeezed out was accompanied by the Buddhist seal's golden light inflicting another flaying-like erosion on its remaining body and soul. Its aura grew dimmer with each word, but its fierce will seemed to be honed to a sharper edge.

Xu Yunfan said leisurely, "I didn't expect the restriction left behind by the Western Buddha Head, Tathagata, after his death to still have such extraordinary power."

Looking at the ferocious monkey, Xu Yunfan moved around it, which immediately provoked the creature.

"What a fierce monkey. In such a situation, it still has such ferocity."

Xu Yunfan's shock was even greater than when he heard Yang Jian's account.

He couldn't help but mutter to himself.

This monkey seemed more like the Sun Wukong from a black myth.

After all, this Heavenly Realm was full of similarities and differences. A tiny deviation could lead to a thousand miles of error.

"Are you willing to submit to me? If you do, I will save you."

Upon hearing Xu Yunfan's words, the monkey bared its sharp teeth and laughed.

"Submit to you? Once your Grandpa Sun gets out, I'll beat you until your soul scatters and your body is destroyed."

"What an arrogant monkey. It seems I really need to teach you a lesson."

A sharp light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes, and he no longer had any hesitation.

The vast spiritual sense of the late Foundation Establishment realm, like a bursting torrent, poured into the Star Spirit Banner in his sleeve.

"All stars of the heavens, capture the spirit and lock the soul! Capture!"

He shouted silently in his heart.

Hum!

The banner body trembled violently!

Ten thousand points of starlight suddenly lit up, instantly converging on the banner surface into an extremely condensed silver-white line of fire.

This starfire seemed to carry the destructive aura of burning all things to ashes. Ignoring all barriers, it pierced straight toward the source of the lingering soul hidden deep within the dim golden eyes of the monkey.

The domineering soul-capturing power of the Star Spirit Banner was unleashed to the utmost.

However, the moment his spiritual sense touched that cluster of lingering soul fire...

BOOM!!!

A mighty, indomitable, and fiercely arrogant will, like a subterranean fire dormant for ten thousand years, erupted violently.

It was in no way the lingering soul of a creature worn down for a thousand years of imprisonment; it was more like a fully-peak ferocious god that had been provoked.

That will was formless and intangible, yet it was like thousands of scorching hot needles, flowing upstream against the spiritual sense channel he had extended, and ruthlessly stabbing toward the Star Spirit Banner in his hand, making the banner tremble and giving Xu Yunfan a considerable surprise.

"Daaa!!!"

A roar that could shatter the heavens and split the earth, seemingly from an ancient primordial era, echoed with immense hatred and disdain.

"You think this sinister, evil banner can capture your Grandpa's soul?! Pah!

Even if my soul is scattered and falls into the nine hells, old Sun will never become a running dog for you, you evil cultivator! Get the hell out! Rooooll!!!"

The will stirred by the lingering soul was as wild as a quenched blade, almost seeming to劈开 the protective spiritual light before him.

Instead of being alarmed, Xu Yunfan became even more delighted.

"Good, good, good. If I use you as the main banner spirit, it will definitely allow my Star Spirit Banner to reach a new level."

In the future, he might not even need to fight his enemies himself. A shake of the Star Spirit Banner, summoning this monkey, could quickly end the battle.

How comfortable!

"Stubborn and unenlightened."

Xu Yunfan's eyes lowered, and the magic power within him surged.

"Now, it is not up to you."

Subsequently, Xu Yunfan's hand seals changed like lightning.

"Eight Scenes of Xuandu, Refine the Heavens and Create, the Cloud Sutra Opens, Hold the Body, Hold the Tool."

Within his Dantian, the Eight Scenes Cloud Qi that had been nurtured for a long time, almost like a connecting sea of clouds, no longer held back. It was like a volcano that had been dormant for billions of years, completely awakened.

The eight-colored cloud qi surged and roared, neither smoke nor fire, not belonging to the five elements of the mortal world. Within it lay the power to refine and transform the universe.
