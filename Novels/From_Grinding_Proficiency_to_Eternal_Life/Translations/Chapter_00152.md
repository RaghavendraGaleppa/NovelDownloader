# Chapter 152: Pure Yang One Qi Technique

"With living beings as straw dogs... I am no different. It is a pity that you should not have forcibly gathered spiritual energy."

Dugu Jiu wiped his finger across the edge of his ancient sword. The blood-colored stars reflected on the blade suddenly flared brightly.

The moment he slashed his sword toward the Observatory, sword marks simultaneously appeared on the ground of the Seventy-Two Districts. Nine strands of earth vein dragon qi were actually forced to the surface by the sword qi, condensing into struggling phantom dragons above the imperial city.

The Empress's Nine-Dragon Canopy shattered with a loud bang.

Her black gold-threaded dragon robe billowed violently, and twelve jade tassels swayed like swords in front of her forehead.

The moment she gripped her sword, jade-like veins of light suddenly appeared on her right hand. The instant the Golden Brilliance Sword was unsheathed, the base of the Observatory, made of dark iron, actually emitted a trembling sound like a dragon's chant.

*Clang!*

The moment the blade was revealed, the Golden Brilliance Sword flowed with a molten gold color throughout. This divine weapon, forged from Sun-Shining Dark Iron from the peak of Kunlun Mountain, had nine dragon patterns on its spine that began to move under the infusion of true qi.

"I hold the mandate of the Great Zhou, wielding the divine artifacts of the nation. A commoner dares to speak with the voice of an emperor? Seeking death!"

The Empress shattered the twelve-patterned floor tiles with a step, and the mercury blood surged like a river tide within her silver marrow.

Every time her palace boots, embroidered with the pattern of the Black Bird, stepped down, a footprint three feet deep appeared on the ground. The dragon qi erupting from the cracks actually condensed into nine golden locks that wrapped around her sword edge.

The moment the golden light and the green qi collided, the ruins of the Observatory suddenly sank a hundred zhang. The twelve coiled dragon pillars turned to dust, and the three thousand six hundred bronze lamps melted into molten iron.

The entire Observatory collapsed with a thunderous roar under the swords of the two Ninth Realm supreme qi-refining grandmasters, and the dust filling the sky instantly rolled upward.

At this moment, the morning light was just beginning to dawn. A ray of the rising sun shot out from the horizon, piercing through the blood-colored clouds and illuminating the heavens and earth.

"Hmm?!"

Sitting cross-legged atop the Sky-Work Fortress, Xu Yunfan sat on the dark steel scales protruding from the forehead of the mechanical giant tiger. His eyes, which had suddenly opened, reflected the rising sun with a strange golden luster.

He felt somewhat uncertain as he sensed the sudden appearance of a few strands of heat qi within his flesh and blood. They flowed slowly through his muscles and bones, nourishing his four limbs and skeleton, and did not dissipate for a long time.

He clearly felt a few strands of gentle qi wandering deep within his flesh and bones. It was like a spring stream thawing as it flowed between his muscles and bones, nourishing his bones until they emitted a faint, continuous hum.

When he practiced the Pure Yang One Qi Technique facing the rising sun in the past few days, he had never received such treatment.

He subconsciously glanced at a message prompt that had appeared in his vision.

*'Facing the rising sun, you visualize yourself inhaling the first strand of purple qi rising from the heavens and earth. In a state that seems empty yet not empty, a particle of Primordial Spirit Qi was accepted into your body. Your proficiency in the Pure Yang One Qi Technique has increased.'*

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan almost jumped up, his expression a mix of shock and joy. Could it be that the Primordial Spirit of Heaven and Earth is reviving?

Since he began his martial arts cultivation, many people have told him that the Primordial Spirit of Heaven and Earth has been extinguished, and the secret powers of the world no longer manifest.

What is happening today? The moment he arrived, this world has revived?!

Just as he was feeling pleased with himself, a voice sounded beside him.

"Yesterday when the earth dragon turned over, I sensed something was off with the mountains and earth veins. Chu Xu of the Melting Gold Hall has already checked ahead of time. The earth veins of the entire Cangzhou suddenly turned over."

The morning wind blew across the hundred-zhang height, making the hammers at Zhan Yan's waist clank.

"Seven earth veins were disturbed by the Incense Fire Sect, scattering some of the Primordial Spirit that was buried deep in the earth's core."

Zhan Yan frowned. "This matter..."

Xu Yunfan reacted and asked, "Then, was the blood sacrifice of the Incense Fire Sect not for their Bright Lord to descend to the world?"

Zhan Yan had a vague guess in his heart but remained silent. This matter was too earth-shattering.

He paused for a moment and said, "The disciples of the Giant Kite Team will return with information soon. Perhaps they will have news."

For the next few days, Xu Yunfan practiced the Pure Yang One Qi Technique for half an hour every morning.

Whenever the morning light pierced through the clouds, Xu Yunfan would sit cross-legged on the suspended Thunder and Fire Platform on the east side of the Sky-Work Fortress.

Every time he guided the Pure Yang One Qi Technique and visualized the Purple Qi Coming from the East to enter his body, a message would pop up on his attribute panel.

*'You visualized the Purple Qi Coming from the East and took a particle of Primordial Spirit Qi into your body. Your body has been tempered and nourished. Your proficiency in the Pure Yang One Qi Technique has increased.'*

Nine warm currents would instantly rise from his spine, like molten gold liquid pouring down the Ren Meridian to irrigate his entire body.

By practicing persistently every day, the few strands of gentle qi wandering deep within his flesh and blood became increasingly thick. Even when he stopped practicing, these few strands of gentle qi did not dissipate but remained dormant deep within his flesh and blood.

It was a very marvelous feeling, and the proficiency increased by at least five points during this process.

If it weren't for the fact that the Pure Yang One Qi Technique specifically captures the scene of the Purple Qi Coming from the East, which only has this effect during the faint light of dawn, the rest would count as ordinary martial arts practice, taking one or two hours to increase by a single point.

Otherwise, he would have devoted himself entirely to practicing the Pure Yang One Qi Technique. This kind of visible daily strengthening is addictive.

Unfortunately, there was only half an hour of practice time. The cost-effectiveness of practicing for the remaining time was terrifyingly low, so he simply focused on Sky-Work Forging Technique for the remaining time.

In the following time, after forging several superior ordinary-grade weapons, he was taught by Zhan Yan the further forging techniques for sharp blades.

In the forging workshop at noon, Xu Yunfan's bare upper body was steaming with white mist.

Every time the octagonal gilded hammer in his hand struck down, sparks accurately splashed into the cold pool quenching trough.

The proficiency of the Sky-Work Forging Technique on his attribute panel did not show a single increase, only a few messages saying that his forging skills were becoming more familiar, and so on.

The rest was tempering other aspects of the Sky-Work Forging Technique. With the Sky-Work Fortress as such a large object, there was plenty of time to practice and increase proficiency.

His proficiency in the Sky-Work Forging Technique increased quite rapidly. According to this progress, in at most three months, he would be able to reach the minor success stage.

But soon, as a large amount of various knowledge accumulated, Xu Yunfan realized that the Sky-Work Forging Technique became increasingly difficult to improve the further he went. He was still sixty points away from minor success, but he couldn't increase by even a single point each day.

At night, he still practiced the Lin Jue as usual. Whether it was an illusion or not, Xu Yunfan always felt that the practice of the Lin Jue seemed to be becoming smoother and smoother.

Although the proficiency still did not increase.

Seven days passed in this cycle of day and night. Suddenly, a deafening eagle cry tore through the dawn.

Three mechanical giant kites tilted and crashed into the outer armor of the Sky-Work Fortress.

"Yujing City... has collapsed..."

A Giant Kite Guard covered in blood crawled out from the wreckage. He was the disciple who flew the farthest. When he arrived at Yujing, he happened to see two figures crossing paths above the collapsing Observatory. The青色 and golden sword qi tore the clouds within a few miles into a spiderweb-like pattern.

Even from a distance, he could still feel the terrifying pressure that severed the earth veins.

"News left by the Sky-Work Cave in the past has come in! The Nine Luminaries Sect has sealed its mountain! The Qingwei Mountain Dao Sect has sealed its mountain!"

Another Giant Kite disciple coughed, then drank a large mouthful of water in front of everyone before saying indignantly, "The Blood Flag Guards of the Incense Fire Sect have slaughtered the seven prefectures of Longxi, but the six top sects have closed their mountain gates!"

Everyone was shocked. Mo Han, who had the most knowledge among them, reacted. He let out a furious shout and slapped the table hard with his big hand.

"That Empress wants the Primordial Spirit of Heaven and Earth to reappear, yet the six top sects of the Great Zhou actually sat by and watched, waiting for the outcome!"
