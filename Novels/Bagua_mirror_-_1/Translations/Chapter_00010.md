# Chapter 10: The Spirit-Devouring Beast  

Qin Chong originally had no spare materials or spirit stones on him—he owed this windfall entirely to Huo Yuanliang of the Canglong Valley. Of course, Qin Chong knew his limits and made sure not to produce anything that could be traced back to the man.  

After haggling for nearly half an hour, the two finally settled on three transactions. Zhao Yin seemed satisfied, and soon they went their separate ways.  

However, the Gourd Valley was limited in size, so Qin Chong eventually chose to follow Zhao Yin's path, keeping a reasonable distance between them.  

Though Qin Chong considered himself experienced and knowledgeable, his time in the cultivation world was still short compared to that old fox. In terms of locating spirit herbs alone, Qin Chong was far behind. Book knowledge could only take him so far—true expertise required real-world practice.  

He had tried fishing for information earlier, but the old man was too shrewd to give anything away.  

Left with no choice, Qin Chong resorted to tailing him. That old man had found several spirit herbs in a single day, while Qin Chong had come up empty-handed. Truly, experience mattered.  

His strategy paid off. By the end of the day, Qin Chong had harvested three spirit herbs, each between thirty to fifty years old. Though modest, he was satisfied.  

Unlike others, he had a good chance of secretly keeping a portion for himself. Hoarding too much was unrealistic, but stashing away ten percent shouldn’t raise eyebrows—especially given his low cultivation level, which would naturally justify a smaller yield.  

That night, Qin Chong began studying the Breath-Concealing Art.  

After reading the jade slip, he cursed Zhao Yin under his breath. That old miser! While the nameless technique itself wasn’t flawed, its cultivation required stringent conditions—only those with a strong physical body could achieve optimal results. The technique had three layers, and currently, Qin Chong could only practice the first. How effective it would be remained to be seen.  

Though he felt cheated, something was better than nothing. Right now, the Breath-Concealing Art was exactly what he needed. His expectations weren’t high—just enough to evade detection by late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.  

If not for this expedition, he wouldn’t have realized the importance of such a technique.  

He delved into studying it, hoping to begin cultivation that very night. The first layer’s mere few hundred characters posed no difficulty—his years of reading manuals and jade slips had paid off.  

After pondering for nearly an hour, Qin Chong started practicing.  

The technique seemed far simpler than his Earth-Solidifying Art. Soon, he grasped its circulation patterns, forming a cycle within his meridians.  

But this was only the beginning. The concealment effect would only manifest once the energy flow reached a certain speed, with efficiency increasing proportionally.  

By dawn, the technique had begun to show results, much to Qin Chong’s relief.  

Though the cultivators in the Gourd Valley were essentially working for others, they remained diligent. After all, such places weren’t easily accessible. With luck, even a single month here could yield over a hundred spirit stones—far more than the meager few a Canglong Valley outer disciple earned in the same period.  

Half the allotted time had now passed. Over the past ten days, Qin Chong had gathered over twenty spirit herbs and secretly kept a few rare ones for himself—a considerable haul.  

One night, he took refuge in the branches of a massive tree.  

At midnight, while cultivating, an unfamiliar presence jolted him awake. Immediately alert, he scanned his surroundings.  

Soon, a mid-tier Spirit-Devouring Beast appeared beneath the tree. Nearly ten feet long, the creature resembled an anteater with an elongated snout and thick gray-brown fur—excellent camouflage in the dark.  

These beasts had a penchant for devouring spiritual substances, making them adept at locating such treasures. Qin Chong couldn’t help but yearn for a Beast-Taming Ring. With a Spirit-Devouring Beast, gathering resources would be far easier.  

**Boom! Boom!**  

The creature rammed into a nearby tree twice, sending leaves and broken branches raining down. Then, to Qin Chong’s surprise, it began climbing the trunk.  

Despite its clumsy appearance, the Spirit-Devouring Beast scaled the tree with surprising agility.  

Qin Chong had been ready to strike, but seeing it ascend a different tree, he held back.  

Despite its fierce name, the Spirit-Devouring Beast was generally docile, rarely attacking humans or other beasts unless provoked. But once enraged, it could be a formidable opponent.  

*Why is it climbing?* Qin Chong wondered.  

His gaze—and his spiritual sense—shifted to the treetop.  

There, nestled among the branches, was a round object the size of a basketball, resembling a beehive. Yet Qin Chong detected no life force within.  

If there had been bee-type demonic beasts, the Spirit-Devouring Beast’s earlier ramming would have stirred them into a frenzy.  

*Wait—spirit honey!*  

Even if the hive was abandoned, remnants of spirit honey likely remained inside. That had to be the beast’s target. Spirit honey was a valuable spiritual resource.  

Its exact worth would depend on its age, but well-aged spirit honey could rival the value of ordinary spirit herbs.  

*How did I miss this? It was right under my nose!*  

Qin Chong considered stealing the prize from the beast. But fighting it at night was risky—while he could probably win, a skirmish might attract other demonic creatures.  

*Distraction it is.*  

He quietly flicked a fireball toward the ground.  

**Boom!**  

As expected, the Spirit-Devouring Beast paused and glanced down. A glimmering object caught its attention—a spirit stone Qin Chong had tossed during the distraction.  

A single spirit stone couldn’t compare to spirit honey in value, but its concentrated spiritual energy was irresistible to low-level beasts.  

Sure enough, the creature scrambled down and swallowed the stone, savoring the influx of energy.  

By the time it finished and looked back up, the hive was gone. The beast let out a low growl of frustration but, detecting no threats, eventually lumbered away.  

Meanwhile, Qin Chong had already relocated over a mile away, the stolen hive safely stowed in his pouch. Since it wasn’t on Canglong Valley’s list of requested items, keeping it posed no issue.  

After shadowing Zhao Yin for over ten days, Qin Chong had lost track of him. But in that time, he had honed his own skills in locating spirit herbs.  

Though still no match for the old man, his progress was undeniable.
