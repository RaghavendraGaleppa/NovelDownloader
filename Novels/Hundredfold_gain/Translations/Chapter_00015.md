# Chapter 15: Transport Mission

The next day.

Having broken through to the third level of Qi Refining, Qi Chuan was in good spirits. He temporarily halted his cultivation and stepped out of his small house to tend to the spiritual herbs growing in the fields atop his peak.

Compared to a year ago, these spiritual herbs had shown significant improvement in their growth. If sold to the family, they would likely fetch ten to twenty percent more spirit stones.

Half an hour later.

[You diligently tended to spiritual plants for half an hour, triggering a 4x critical hit. You gained four times the rewards, slightly improving your experience and skills in plant cultivation.]

As Qi Chuan straightened up after finishing his work, these words appeared before his eyes. He nodded slightly, a satisfied expression crossing his face. His understanding of herb cultivation had deepened, though he still hadn't reached the level of a qualified spiritual farmer. His main focus had always been on cultivation and mastering spells—tending to these herbs was merely a side activity. Yet, even this casual practice steadily improved his skills, and becoming a proficient spiritual farmer was only a matter of time.

With his task completed, Qi Chuan stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at the distant scenery. Recently, he had been the only one on this isolated peak—Second Uncle had left on another mission.

"Come to think of it, Second Uncle mentioned a while ago that I should start taking on family missions," Qi Chuan suddenly recalled.

All members of the Qi family received annual stipends—two low-grade spirit stones for those at the first to third levels of Qi Refining, with more for those in the mid-stage. However, in exchange for the family's protection and resources, every cultivator was required to undertake missions, typically at least two per year. If one didn't volunteer, the family would assign tasks anyway. Taking the initiative at least allowed some choice.

Since joining the main family, Qi Chuan hadn't taken on any missions—partly because of the secret realm incident that erupted shortly after his arrival, which led to the family restricting external activities. With fewer missions available, he had been exempt. But now that the situation had stabilized and restrictions were lifted, he needed to start accepting tasks before the family forced assignments upon him.

Moreover, his recent breakthrough to the third level had depleted his spirit stones and pills, leaving him with only two low-grade spirit stones—not even enough to purchase a single Condensing Qi Pill. Completing missions would earn him family contribution points, each roughly equivalent to a low-grade spirit stone in purchasing power at the family exchange. Some resources could only be obtained with contribution points, which would allow him to replenish his pill supply.

"Mission assignments are handled at the Mission Hall on the main peak, right?" With this in mind, Qi Chuan wasted no time and headed straight there.

The Mission Hall had three floors—the first for early-stage Qi Refining cultivators, the second and third for mid and late-stage respectively. Inside, a few early-stage cultivators were examining a jade wall displaying mission details. Some tasks were internal, offering minimal contribution points and consuming time that could be spent cultivating, while others involved external assignments with potential risks.

As Qi Chuan scanned the options, none seemed particularly appealing—until a new mission appeared on the wall.

"Transport supplies to the Murong family? Didn't Second Uncle take this mission before?" Qi Chuan remembered his uncle mentioning it during their first meeting after joining the main family. Back then, Second Uncle had been at the third level of Qi Refining—the same as Qi Chuan now. With all five basic elemental spells mastered to the minor achievement stage and beyond, Qi Chuan felt he might even surpass his uncle's former strength.

"The mission states a mid-stage cultivator at the sixth level will oversee it, and participants only need to be at least at the second level. It should be safe..." After quick consideration, Qi Chuan flipped out his family token and channeled his spiritual energy, sending a beam of light to claim the mission.

Beside him, a few others also attempted to take the mission, but only two succeeded besides Qi Chuan. Those who hesitated too long were left disappointed. 

"Lucky I got the tip-off early, or this good mission would've slipped away," one successful applicant muttered smugly, eyeing Qi Chuan with slight surprise at his swift reaction.

Unconcerned with the others, Qi Chuan left the hall after securing his spot. A few days later, he received word that the mission would commence in three days.

When the time came, a merchant convoy departed from Red Maple Valley toward the Murong family's territory. Riding atop a towering crimson horse, Qi Chuan held the reins, his body swaying slightly with the animal's movements. The convoy consisted of similar horses—some carrying riders, others pulling wagons laden with goods covered by waterproof cloth, resembling the trucks of his past life.

These horses, he had heard, carried traces of demon beast bloodline—hybrids between demonic steeds and ordinary horses, granting them extraordinary strength and endurance. Though fierce by nature, the presence of Qi Chuan's third-level cultivation suppressed any rebellious tendencies, ensuring a smooth and steady journey.
