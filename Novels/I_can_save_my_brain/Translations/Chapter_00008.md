# Chapter 8: Successful Experiment

Looking at the massive silver-white structure before him, Chen Daoxuan felt an indescribable satisfaction.

"Calling it an 'Ore Smelting Furnace' doesn't seem quite right anymore. From now on, I'll call you the Spirit Fusion Furnace!" he declared, giving the furnace a new name.

After five years of development, his magical artifact was finally complete.

The first thing Chen Daoxuan wanted to do was test whether this Spirit Fusion Furnace worked as intended. He was eager to see if it truly functioned as he had envisioned—requiring neither spiritual energy nor divine sense, but simply manual operation of the two control levers on its control system.

Growing increasingly impatient, he quickly retrieved two chunks of copper ore from his storage bag and tossed them into the furnace's feed port.

This time, Chen Daoxuan didn't use a single trace of spiritual energy, operating entirely by hand. He gently moved the second lever on the control panel, activating the drive array powered by spirit stones. The levitation array on the furnace came to life, suspending the two copper ore chunks perfectly at the center of the furnace.

"First step complete!" Encouraged by the furnace's flawless operation, Chen Daoxuan proceeded to the next phase. "Now, to heat and smelt the ore."

He manipulated the first lever, adjusting the distance between the spirit stones and the drive array to control the spiritual energy input, thereby regulating the heat-gathering array's intensity. As he slowly pushed the lever forward, the temperature inside the furnace rose rapidly, soon reaching the level he typically achieved when smelting ore manually.

"Is that it?" Watching the furnace operate smoothly, Chen Daoxuan felt an unprecedented sense of ease—like witnessing automated machinery from his previous life. However, he knew the real challenge lay ahead.

The most difficult part of the Spirit Fusion Furnace was fusing the spiritual essence. Although the fusion array was derived from his enlightenment, he couldn't be certain it would work.

As time passed, even the resilient copper ore couldn't withstand the furnace's relentless heat. After four hours, the two chunks finally melted.

Seeing this, Chen Daoxuan perked up—the critical moment had arrived.

Through his divine sense, he observed the two molten copper masses slowly merging under the influence of the levitation array. More importantly, their spiritual essences were also fusing together. This wasn't due to his divine sense forcibly compressing them; he had only been observing, not interfering. Clearly, the fusion array was working as intended.

"Whoosh—" 

The moment the spiritual essences merged, a beam of white light erupted from the furnace's top, accompanied by a sharp whistling sound reminiscent of high-pressure steam from his past life. This was a small feedback mechanism Chen Daoxuan had designed—a signal to notify mortal workers when the smelting was complete, since they lacked divine sense to check for themselves.

Hearing the sound, Chen Daoxuan was overjoyed. He quickly operated the lever, and the refined molten ore floated out through the discharge port.

"Perfect!" 

He used his spiritual energy to bring the molten copper closer, inspecting it carefully with his divine sense. It was identical to what he could produce manually.

"With enough Spirit Fusion Furnaces, my forging efficiency could increase dozens of times!" he exclaimed.

Take the Crimson Shadow Flying Sword, for example. What used to take him three days and nights of material refinement could now be reduced to just shaping the artifact and integrating the arrays—tasks that, even with the complexity of array fusion, would take no more than an hour. In other words, three days' work was now compressed into two hours—a thirty-six-fold increase in efficiency.

A single craftsman like Chen Daoxuan could now match the output of thirty-six traditional forgers. Even more astonishing was that this efficiency was replicable. If this revolutionary artifact were widely adopted, every new forger the family produced would effectively be worth thirty-six.

With this, would they ever lack spirit stones or cultivation resources again? 

For the first time, Chen Daoxuan felt truly unburdened. The decline of his family and the dwindling number of cultivators had weighed on him like a mountain, leaving him no room to relax. But now, the clouds had parted—the pressure was gone.

"However, for the Spirit Fusion Furnace to function, we'll need earthfire chambers connected to underground fire veins. Otherwise, the heat-gathering array won't work." 

Glancing at the cramped earthfire chamber he was in, he shook his head. "This one won't do, and the terrain here isn't suitable for a forge workshop either."

After some thought, he concluded that Changping County would be the ideal location. Its flat terrain offered ample space for expansion, making it perfect for future scaling.

But all of this required one crucial thing: money.

Chen Daoxuan knew his family's coffers were nearly empty. Over the years, they had invested at least five thousand spirit stones into his forging studies—a staggering sum even for Foundation Establishment cultivators. Few rogue cultivators could amass such wealth.

Yet, if not his family, who else could he rely on? 

Though he had lived in this world for sixteen years, he had never once left Shuanghu Island. His life had revolved around cultivation and forging, with his uncle, the Thirteenth Elder, shielding him from most family affairs. For the Chen Clan, his becoming a forger was already the greatest contribution he could make.

After much deliberation, Chen Daoxuan decided to seek his family's support. Even if they couldn't help financially, his uncle could at least offer advice. Compared to his own inexperience, Chen Xianhe—a veteran of cultivator wars who had traveled across the Ten Thousand Stars Sea and even the Immortal Cloud Continent—had far more wisdom to share.

Without delay, Chen Daoxuan set down the Spirit Fusion Furnace and flew straight to the clan leader's residence.

At that moment, Chen Xianhe was lounging on a recliner, sipping tea and humming a tune as he basked in the sunlight, having just finished inspecting the family's secret vault.

"Achoo!" 

Suddenly, he sneezed violently, jolting upright in confusion.
