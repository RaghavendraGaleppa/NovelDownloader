# Chapter 318: The Weight of a Best Actor Award

On the wide walls of Qingmu City.

At this moment, the outermost areas were all set with barbecue grills of various sizes. The meat on them sizzled with oil, its fragrant aroma wafting through the air. It was as if they were holding a barbecue feast right on the city walls.

Li Mo held a skewer, squinting as he observed the black cloud-like army pressing down on the city.

This vast, tumultuous force carried a wild and brutal aura that rushed at them, suffocating them.

To be honest, Young Hero Li had never experienced such a scene, and it was impossible not to feel nervous. However, the soldiers were all looking at him now. In their hearts, he was the dawn of victory...

He had to stand tall!

"Come, come, eat and drink!"

"Don't worry, everyone. The ones attacking the city are just my defeated opponents!"

Li Mo raised his skewer and took a bite.

The soldiers didn't understand what was going on, but since Young Hero Li was on the front lines with them, sharing life and death, what did they have to hesitate about?

"Forget it, if we die, we die! With Young Hero Li here, what's there to be afraid of?"

"Haha, even if we end up wrapped in horsehide on the way to see King Yama, we shouldn't go on an empty stomach!"

Thus, although the soldiers felt as if they were facing a great enemy, they followed the prior arrangements and ate their barbecue without a trace of fear.

Wu Lang squinted at the army that had arrived at the city gates and took a fierce bite of his skewer.

"I wonder how much time Young Hero Li's plan can buy us."

Qu Sheng slowly let out a breath of turbid air.

"Every moment counts. If not an hour, then half an hour is good."

"As long as the other side isn't a reckless fool, anyone who thinks deeply will hesitate upon seeing this formation."

If he were the one attacking and saw the city gates wide open, completely undefended, he would also be stunned for a good while before summoning his generals to discuss and probe the reason for this behavior.

This wasn't a plan to make the enemy retreat, but a plan to delay them.

He was also prepared for the possibility of being seen through; the city gates could be closed at any time.

Qingmu City only appeared undefended; it wasn't truly defenseless.

"I will do my best to extend the effect of this plan."

At this moment, the genius strategist, Young Hero Li, slowly stood up.

Everyone looked over.

Qu Sheng asked, "Extend it how?"

Li Mo picked up another skewer and revealed a profound smile.

"Actually, I am an actor."

"The winner of the Best Actor award at the first Golden Statue Awards is none other than myself!"

"!"

Qu Sheng and the other generals had no idea what this award was; they had never even heard of it.

But Young Hero Li was a low-key person. Even when he made it onto the Hidden Dragon List, he didn't go around boasting about his title.

Now, however, he was introducing this Golden Statue Award with such gravity.

It must be a prestigious award!

It sounded impressive just by hearing it.

Meanwhile.

Down below the city.

"What is that smell?"

"Damn, barbecue? Don't they know we're here to attack the city? They're actually eating openly!"

"Damn it, what are they even roasting? Why does it smell so good?"

"Is there a possibility that they're trying to torment us with the smell?"

"The gates are wide open, we can just charge right in and take Qingmu City in one go!"

For a moment, buzzing discussions rolled like thunder, and sounds of doubt and uncertainty rose from the enemy army.

Especially the shamans beside Han Zhen, who were possessed by disaster beasts. They all roared and howled, unable to resist the urge to rush into Qingmu City for a feast.

"Silence! I have not given the order."

Han Zhen's deep voice cut through the clamor.

The shamans fell silent, suppressing their inner agitation as they looked at him.

"Grand Tutor, this is a heaven-sent opportunity. Why not let us charge?"

"Hmph."

Han Zhen let out a cold snort.

The Beast Hall Master pondered for a moment and said, "Qingmu City is not deaf or blind. They must have received intelligence. Even if they haven't, as the deepest city within the Southern Pass, it's impossible for them to be in this state."

"I have faced Commander Qu Sheng before. He runs a strict military and is a difficult opponent."

"He would definitely fight to the death. For the gates to be wide open... could it be an ambush?"

Helian Wu's eyes also flickered with suspicion.

What they said was exactly what Han Zhen was thinking.

With over a hundred thousand troops and many disaster beasts at the city gates, taking the city would mean leaving nothing alive.

But after their long march, the Qingmu City they saw was not on high alert, nor were the city guards trembling in fear...

They were eating?

In this situation, how can they still eat?

---

And they're eating so deliciously? It makes one's mouth water just watching?

Something is wrong.

It's ten out of ten, completely wrong!

"So, what do we do now?"

The Great Wind, possessing a human body, wiped the saliva from the corner of his mouth and asked.

"We shall first..."

"Hey, old bastard!"

Before he could finish, a voice filled with laughter came from the top of the city wall.

Han Zhen: "?"

The next moment, the one who stood atop the city wall was none other than our first Golden Statue Award Best Actor!

Li Mo held a skewer in his hand, looking completely at ease, even smiling as he looked down upon the army below.

"I let you live last time, yet knowing I am here, you dare to come and seek death?"

"Dare you come out and fight me for three hundred rounds?"

"..."

Han Zhen's eyelid twitched.

This was another thing that caught him off guard.

It's said that a gentleman does not stand beneath a crumbling wall. Li Mo should know that this army pressing down on the city is here specifically for him.

But not only did Li Mo not hide, he openly stood on the city wall?

And he was pointing things out while holding a skewer?

"Come and get me!"

"Today, I'll make you feel a white blade enter and a green blade exit, as I stab your gall!"

"Then I'll make you feel a white blade enter and a yellow blade exit, as I stab your dung sack!"

"!"

Gasp...

The entire army sucked in a cold breath, so strong it diluted the smell of barbecue. They became even more curious about what kind of sauce was on the barbecue to make it smell so good...

The shamans possessed by disaster beasts even took a tactical step back.

The Grand Tutor of the Great Shang Dynasty.

A former seventh-realm, Xuanxuan powerhouse.

At his peak, even a monarch would treat him with respect. Yet now, he was being pointed at and humiliated by that brat.

Even though Han Zhen's temper was quite good, his face was now dark as water. Out of caution, he didn't order an attack, but he couldn't help but retort:

"You..."

"I don't want to hear a dog barking."

Li Mo turned his back on them with great pomp.

"??!"

That brat, after provoking them, actually turned his back?

He wouldn't even let them talk back after cursing them?

And in a standoff between two armies, he just casually turned around, turning his back on an army of over a hundred thousand, treating them as a bunch of chicken and dog trash, utterly ignoring them!

Are we not human?

Are we human or not?

"Li Mo has his back to us?"

The Beast Hall Master's eyes widened, even more confused about what kind of play this was.

"Grand Tutor, he... he's cursing you, Grand Tutor?" Helian Wu said in disbelief.

Han Zhen was now trembling with rage.

If it were anyone else, it would be fine, but it had to be his mortal enemy. It was because of Li Mo that he had lost the Blood Phoenix Essence.

Could he endure this?

He actually could.

The more this happened, the more suspicious he felt.

When Li Mo attacked him that day, it wasn't aimed at him but was a feint to shatter the秘境 (secret realm). He knew this brat was no mindless fool.

So Han Zhen suppressed his anger and commanded in a loud voice:

"That yellow-mouthed brat is doing this on purpose. He wants to provoke me into ordering an attack so he can spring his trap."

"There must be an ambush inside this city."

"Scout first, find out the truth!"

After speaking, Han Zhen looked to the side, where a middle-aged man wrapped in black raven feathers stood, his pupils blood-red.

The raven-feathered man nodded slightly. The feathers on his body turned into hundreds of black crows, flapping their wings as they flew towards the city.

He wasn't the only one.

Several other bird-type disaster beasts also used their bloodline abilities to scout Qingmu City.

On the city wall.

Li Mo frowned.

The intensity of the scouting was greater than he had anticipated.

As expected, a world like the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, with its mystical powers, cannot be compared to his previous life...
