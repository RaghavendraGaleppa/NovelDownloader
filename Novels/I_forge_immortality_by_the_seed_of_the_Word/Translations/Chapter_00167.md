# Chapter 164: The Secret Treasure—Jiaoyun Decree

As time drew near, the vast wilderness erupted in chaos.

At this moment, many gradually recovered from the shock of the terrifying destiny rewards and began recalling the rules of the first round announced by the colossal face in the sky. Worry soon crept onto their faces.

Out of a staggering 380,000 participants, only a mere 1,298 would advance to the next round. Apart from a select few, who could confidently claim they would be among those lucky ones?

Thus—

"Fellow Daoist, which arena are you in?"

"Arena 87."

"Perfect! I'm in Arena 87 too! How about teaming up? I've already gathered nine other fellow Daoists. If we work together, advancing to the next round is guaranteed."

Seeing the other's hesitation, the speaker pressed further:

"Think about it. Advancing means 20 million destiny points, but getting eliminated means not only no rewards but also losing 100,000 destiny points. Moreover, don't forget—among the participants are disciples of celestial immortal factions and those monstrous geniuses from the seven supreme legacies. Without teamwork, how can we possibly compete?"

"Alright!"

"Here's a communication jade token. We'll coordinate in the arena."

...

Faint whispers drifted into Zhang Jing's ears.

He opened his eyes, a faint, inscrutable smile playing on his lips.

Would teamwork really help? Perhaps it was merely a way to soothe their anxieties.

Back in the lower realm's Myriad Gods Secret Realm, he had already discovered a harsh truth: the gap between Foundation Establishment cultivators could be vast—so vast that numbers alone couldn't bridge it.

As he pondered, a familiar voice rang out.

"Haha, Brother Zhang, so you're here!"

Zhang Jing turned to see Qu Junhou striding toward him.

"Brother Qu, which arena are you in?" Zhang Jing asked with a smile.

"Arena 99. What about you, Brother Zhang?"

As he spoke, Qu Junhou plopped down beside Zhang Jing without a care for decorum.

"Arena 29."

"Ah, what a shame. I was hoping we could dominate the arena together," Qu Junhou lamented, shaking his head in disappointment.

"Oh? So you're also thinking of teaming up like the others?" Zhang Jing asked, his smile deepening.

Qu Junhou chuckled. "Brother Zhang, you wouldn't believe it. On my way here, I already ran into two groups from Arena 99 planning to team up. They even said they'd prioritize eliminating lone cultivators. Hearing that, I was terrified—terrified they wouldn't give me enough targets!"

His expression betrayed not a trace of fear, only eagerness.

Then, as if struck by a thought, Qu Junhou turned to Zhang Jing with interest. "Brother Zhang, what about you? Would you be scared?"

"Scared? Absolutely!" Zhang Jing replied, his smile widening.

...

As they conversed, time slipped by unnoticed.

Above them, the hundred colossal arenas suddenly erupted with radiant immortal light, exuding an oppressive, terrifying aura.

In the next instant, countless beams of light shot up from the ground, painting the sky in a dazzling array of colors.

"Brother Zhang, I'll go ahead first."

Qu Junhou stood abruptly and transformed into a streak of light, soaring into the sky.

With a faint smile, Zhang Jing ceased resisting the immense pulling force from above and vanished in a similar flash of light.

...

Elsewhere, in a vast space, millions of cultivators ceased their chatter and turned their attention forward, where projections of the hundred arenas displayed as if they were there in person.

Within the projections, countless beams of light descended like rain, a breathtaking spectacle.

...

In a higher plane of existence, a man draped in a blue robe laughed heartily. "It's about to begin! Let's see if there are any promising talents destined for our Hanhai Sect."

Beside him, a woman with hair coiled like clouds and skin like jade smiled softly. "With your esteemed presence here from the True Ascension Treasure Heaven, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. By the way, is Elder Yin Shui still in the outer realms?"

"Yes," the blue-robed man sighed. "By the decree of the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect, he remains stationed there."

...

**Arena 29**

"The Jiaoyun Decree... What does it even look like? Is it hanging from a tree or buried in the ground? This is so frustrating!"

A voice echoed through a valley.

Beside a narrow stream, Zhang Jing flipped over a crab the size of a millstone, only to find nothing beneath it. Disappointed, he shook his head.

"Do you know where it is?" he asked the crab, staring into its tiny eyes.

The crab merely stared back blankly, its once-menacing claws now tucked tightly against its body, trembling.

With a sigh, Zhang Jing tossed the crab back into the water, his expression troubled.

It was his third day in Arena 29. Perhaps due to the arena's vastness—spanning nearly 9,000 li—he hadn't encountered a single soul, let alone found the elusive Jiaoyun Decree.

With only 380,000 participants scattered across such an expanse, the odds were daunting.

"Is the first round testing our luck?" Zhang Jing mused.

The arena's rules were peculiar. Spiritual sense was restricted, and powerful gales made flight nearly impossible. Compounded by the endless mountain ranges and countless hidden nooks, finding the decree seemed an insurmountable task.

"For now, all I can do is keep searching," Zhang Jing muttered, vanishing into the valley in a blur.

...

**Day 10**

Within a serpentine mountain range, two roaring rivers surged through hundred-zhang gorges before converging into a vast, mirror-like lake.

At the lake's center lay a small island.

Zhang Jing stood at the shore, his gaze fixed on the island, excitement flickering in his eyes.

From his vantage point, he had glimpsed a faint golden light flickering on the island moments earlier.

Now, he was certain.

Stepping onto the water's surface as if it were solid ground, Zhang Jing began his slow approach.

Half a quarter-hour later, he reached the island.

At its center, hovering nine feet nine inches above the ground, was a peculiar golden cloud-patterned token, emitting a soft glow.

"This must be the Jiaoyun Decree," Zhang Jing murmured, reaching out to claim it.

A surge of unfamiliar information flooded his mind:

*Jiaoyun Decree: Contains a wisp of the Jiaoyang Qingyun's essence. Holder gains a slight boost in comprehension. Effects do not stack.*

Zhang Jing's eyes widened in surprise. He had assumed the decree was merely a token for advancement, but it was actually a treasure!

Did this mean subsequent rounds would offer similar rewards?

"Perhaps the Jiaoyun Secret Realm isn't just about earning destiny points," he mused.

...

Meanwhile, hidden in the lakeside forest, several pairs of eyes watched Zhang Jing intently.

"Damn it, that guy got there first. That thing in his hand must be the Jiaoyun Decree!"

"What do we do?" a man at the front whispered.

"He's alone," a woman in a green dress said coldly.

"But... those who dare to go solo are usually not to be trifled with," another voice cautioned.

"What's there to fear? The weakest among us has a crimson foundation, and our leader and two others have azure foundations. With the element of surprise, even if he had three heads and six arms, we could eliminate him," the woman argued confidently.

"Time's running out—only twenty days left, and we haven't found a single decree. Are you really willing to pass up this chance?"

Silence fell over the group.

Finally, the black-robed man at the rear spoke. "This decree goes to me first. Any objections? As long as we work together, I promise everyone will get one in the remaining twenty days."

The others nodded in agreement.

"Good. Prepare yourselves. He's about to leave the island. Strike hard and fast—eliminate him immediately. This is our first decree. Make it count!" the black-robed man commanded.

"Understood!"
