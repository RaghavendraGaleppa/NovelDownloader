# Chapter 39: Restless with Anxiety

Xu Yunfan's kick, while not brutal to the extreme, showed absolutely no mercy.

His foot landed squarely on Fei Shimei's body, the movement crisp and decisive without the slightest hesitation, making it clear he had held nothing back.

This scene nearly caused Qin Bo to lose control of his emotions, his blood surging as he almost rushed forward recklessly to fight Xu Yunfan to the death.

He knew in his heart that if anything serious happened to Fei Shimei, he would inevitably bear the blame, unable to atone for his sins even if he died ten thousand deaths. The Sect Master of the Shocking Tide Sect, Fei Qi, would surely make him pay for it.

Xu Yunfan was also feeling quite frustrated at the moment. He had merely purchased a courtyard at random; who could have guessed it belonged to a Great Achievement Martial Teacher who had returned in glory, and that they just happened to want to buy it back?

To be honest, there was an empty courtyard next door. Although the location was slightly inferior, Xu Yunfan wouldn't have been unable to accept it. If Qin Bo had approached him politely in the beginning, explained his intentions amicably, and offered sufficient compensation, Xu Yunfan might have seriously considered transferring the courtyard.

But Qin Bo had to go and act tough, shouting about killing and fighting from the very start. The moment he realized he couldn't match Xu Yunfan's strength, he immediately changed his tune.

Xu Yunfan thought to himself that for an ordinary person, if a Great Achievement Martial Teacher wanted the house you just bought, you wouldn't even dare to pass gas. He was afraid that most people would have been thoroughly calculated against by this Qin Bo, getting completely taken advantage of with nowhere to complain.

Qin Bo's face turned pale then green. He knew well that the person before him had no intention of letting this go easily. But it was Fei Shimei who was in the wrong first, charging in with a long sword shouting about killing; without the strength to back it up, who could endure that?

After a moment of silence, he gritted his teeth and艰难地吐出一句话: "Fei Shimei has silver notes on her. You can take five hundred taels as our apology."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. He hadn't expected Qin Bo to be so patient; this was truly a bit of a surprise to him.

He pondered for a moment. Under Qin Bo's gaze, which was almost twisted with suppressed emotion, he reached into Fei Shimei's bosom and rummaged around. Just as expected, he pulled out a stack of silver notes.

He glanced at them casually. The denominations were mostly one hundred taels each, a thick stack that looked quite eye-catching.

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate at all, stuffing the silver notes straight into his pocket. Qin Bo, seeing this, immediately grew anxious and said in a deep voice, "Brother, isn't this a bit unreasonable?"

Xu Yunfan let out a cold laugh and retorted, "What's unreasonable? This covers the cost of the apology, plus my mental distress fee, lost wages, nutrition fee, psychological counseling fee, daily operating expenses, time loss fee, and all other costs. Adding up all these miscellaneous items, this amount of silver isn't even enough! It's only because I see you're young and inexperienced with the world that I'm letting you off easily."

Qin Bo's forehead veins bulged, throbbing violently. It took a great deal of effort for him to suppress his anger as he said in a low voice, "In that case, could you sell the residence to me?"

"I'll consider it," Xu Yunfan replied unhurriedly.

Hearing this, Qin Bo could only swallow his pride and agree.

Watching Xu Yunfan lift his foot from Fei Shimei's stomach and take a few steps back, Qin Bo dared not slacken in the slightest. He glanced warily at Xu Yunfan, then stepped forward and hauled Fei Shimei up.

"Brother, the mountains remain, and the rivers flow on. I shall visit another day!"

Watching Qin Bo leave with those parting words, Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered, and he remained silent.

He knew that having a character like this, who acted without knowing the limits of her strength and shouted about killing at the drop of a hat, meant that the so-called "visit another day" was like a thorn stuck in his heart. In a word, it left him restless with anxiety.

But this Shocking Tide Sect...

Xu Yunfan let out a quiet sigh. Sitting at home with the door closed, disaster still fell from the sky.

Once Qin Bo turned a corner in the distance and completely disappeared, Xu Yunfan made a decisive move without the slightest hesitation, swiftly setting off to follow him.

He understood that if he were to fight Qin Bo for real here, the commotion would surely be too great. A martial teacher at the peak of the first level of refinement could split stones with a casual strike. If he couldn't crush the opponent with overwhelming force and a fight broke out, the surrounding houses might遭殃. If it attracted the attention of the authorities, it might lead to his previous identity being uncovered. He had to think of another method; resolving this silently and effectively was the simplest and most efficient way.

If they could avoid conflict, that would be best. But remembering the young girl's fierce demeanor, he felt it was highly unlikely to end well. In his previous life's workplace, Xu Yunfan had a very profound lesson learned.

Xu Yunfan followed Qin Bo from a great distance, unhurriedly. His hunting skills allowed him to track his prey while keeping his own form largely undetected. Following someone without being noticed was extremely simple. The bustling crowds on the street and the sundries piled up by the roadside were all his cover, allowing him to maintain a fluctuating distance from Qin Bo.

Xu Yunfan stopped at the street corner, his expression calm as he watched Qin Bo help Fei Shimei into an inn.

Having confirmed Qin Bo's lodging, Xu Yunfan didn't linger. He turned around quietly and quickly returned to his own residence.

Inside the inn, Qin Bo hurriedly placed Fei Yao gently on the bed, then straightened up, looking at her with a complex expression.

His face was like a spilled spice jar, a mix of emotions. At times it was as dark as ink, and at others, a hard-to-fathom ripple would appear.

On the way here, Fei Yao's style of acting could be described as extremely arrogant and overbearing. Wherever she went, she stirred up a pile of trouble. Qin Bo, following behind her, had no idea how many messes he had cleaned up for her, constantly tidying up her烂摊子,耗费了多少心力.

Especially today's incident, where Fei Yao had擅自提剑 wanting to rush into the courtyard, completely disregarding the consequences. In the past, it was fine; they had mostly encountered ordinary people who could be killed without consequence. But now they had run into a tough nut like Xu Yunfan and kicked an iron plate.

Qin Bo secretly wondered, if the residence couldn't be bought back in the end, had the thing hidden in the courtyard already fallen into that guy's hands?

Thinking of this, his gaze fell on the unconscious Fei Yao, and a不易察觉的狠厉 flashed through his eyes for an instant.

An uncontrollable thought surfaced in his mind: find an opportunity to send this junior sister to those people they couldn't afford to offend.只要自己语言挑拨几句, he could easily get rid of this troublemaker.

But just as this idea came up, he couldn't help but hesitate. Fei Yao had Fei Qi behind her. If he really did that, what would he do when Fei Qi came looking for him to settle the account later?

The more Qin Bo thought about it, the more frustrated he felt, a wave of dejection washing over him.

当初为了进入惊涛门, he had latched onto Fei Yao, thinking it was a path to the clouds, but now it felt like he had fallen into a quicksand, reaping the consequences of his own actions.

Just then, Fei Yao let out a soft moan, her eyelashes trembling slightly as she slowly woke up.

She opened her eyes in a daze, and the first thing she saw was Qin Bo's face, which looked full of concern.

Seeing her wake up, Qin Bo immediately put on a look of urgency and asked anxiously, "Fei Shimei, how do you feel? Are you alright?"

Fei Yao felt a sudden warmth in her face, a hint of shyness涌起 in her heart. Upon hearing the question, she subconsciously covered her stomach, frowned slightly, and carefully felt for a moment. Then she shook her head gently and said softly, "I'm fine. That guy's kick was quite strong, but fortunately, he didn't hit any vital spots."

She paused, then asked, "Senior Brother, did you deal with that person?"
