# Chapter 188: Ying Bing’s Feedback and the Sword-Scarred Strange Stone

The sound of sword songs echoed between heaven and earth.

At this moment, standing above the Cloud Ladder, the young girl seemed to be the only existence in the universe.

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in ‘Ying Bing,’ helping her achieve a clear Sword Heart.】

【You have an investment feedback reward waiting to be claimed.】

Li Mo: “.....”

It was sudden and overwhelming.

It seemed the Ice Cube had figured things out and then achieved enlightenment?

Otherwise, how could she possess a Red Destiny? Even resolving her mental inner turmoil produced such a magnificent phenomenon...

As everyone knows.

The Ice Cube’s rewards are usually world-shaking.

But it’s inconvenient to claim it right now under everyone’s gaze...

“No need to thank me. I also benefited greatly.”

“That is not the same thing.”

Ying Bing shook her head gently, a trace of softness surfacing in her deep, quiet eyes.

Progress in the spiritual soul cannot compare to achieving a clear Sword Heart.

Moreover, she gained more than just that from that round of bright moon.

The moon imprinted in Li Mo’s spiritual soul was truly extraordinary.

Mysterious, tranquil, and eternal.

She only caught a fleeting glimpse and hasn't even been able to窥探 its entirety...

“Ice Cube.”

“Hmm?”

“In the future, when we have time, in the second layer of the Phoenix Singing Sky Marsh, we can occasionally...”

“Alright.”

Ying Bing nodded in agreement without the slightest hesitation.

Then, holding Li Mo’s hand, she continued forward.

“.....”

Li Mo couldn't help but smile helplessly.

The familiar Ice Cube had returned, and she seemed even more so than before?

Her exquisite figure swayed. Although she was walking towards the top of the Sword Tower, it gave people the illusion... that the Sword Tower was actively moving towards her.

Not long after.

The three of them finally stepped onto solid ground again.

Li Mo looked around.

At the very top of the Sword Tower, there were no extra buildings, only a waterfall and a clear spring.

The waterfall shimmered with radiant light, and the mist splashed out made one’s skin tighten.

The clear pool seemed real, containing water plants, swimming fish, lotus flowers, and pebbles...

However, Li Mo could see.

This waterfall and clear pool were not real; everything within them was formed from various Qi and Intent.

Everyone gazed over and couldn't help but hold their breath.

“That is the strange stone that carries the Hengyun Sword Scar.”

Elder Zeng stepped onto the roof top and pointed casually.

Instantly, the waterfall split.

Through the crystal-clear water vapor, one could vaguely see a stone within the waterfall, as if it had endured the washing of water for endless years, appearing ancient and simple.

Staring at it intently made one’s heart sway.

The sword scar on it was shocking; just looking at it caused the spiritual soul to tremble.

“Sword-Scarred Strange Stone...”

Li Mo’s attention was instead placed on the stone itself that carried the scar.

For some reason.

When he saw this stone, fragments of *Journey to the West* popped into his mind:

“In the East Divinity Land, by the seaside of the Kingdom of Aolai, there is a Flower Fruit Mountain. Atop the mountain is a stone,受日月精華, weathered by wind and rain...”

Was it because the waterfall itself easily reminded people of the Water Curtain Cave?

Or was the stone simply too extraordinary?

“Hmm...” Jiang Chulong’s gray-white eyes behind the cloth band were incredibly focused.

Ying Bing’s beautiful phoenix eyes narrowed, as if she was filtering through the chaotic various Qi and Intent to see its essence.

Li Mo retracted his spirit.

Right.

Yin Mianmian, who had used some method to disguise herself, was also there.

He had already informed Bai Jinghong of her information, asking him to relay it to Elder Zeng.

Why hadn't the Sword City made a move yet?

Did they want to play a long game, catch the big fish, and wipe out the Rain Pavilion forces in Yunzhou in one go?

“The Sword Scar requires one to pour their spiritual soul into it to appreciate its divine mystery.”

---

“Therefore, only one person can comprehend it at a time.”

Elder Zeng said, looking at the Sword City disciples including Bai Jinghong:

“Wu Chushu, you go first. Let me see if you have made any progress.”

“Yes.”

Wu Chushu stepped forward.

He crossed the waterfall that Elder Zeng had split, walked solemnly to the Sword-Scarred Strange Stone, and sat down cross-legged to comprehend seriously.

*Buzz—*

Spiritual soul fluctuations spread. The divine intent scene he was observing appeared around him.

His face turned slightly pale as he bore immense pressure, but his expression gradually turned to surprise.

It seemed...

“He领悟了 what kind of sword technique?”

Li Mo focused his gaze.

In the pool water,不知何时, many floating petals appeared.

Not long after.

Wu Chushu stood up, took a pill to restore his spiritual soul, and returned to bow to Elder Zeng.

Elder Zeng smiled at the corners of his eyes and announced loudly:

“Wu Chushu has comprehended a high-grade martial art, the *Luxuriant Washing Sword Art*!”

Don't underestimate high-grade martial arts.

In the Jianghu, many small sects consider a mid-grade martial art enough to be their foundation, let alone a martial art created entirely by oneself and perfectly suited to the user.

Moreover, there are differences even among high-grade martial arts.

This *Luxuriant Washing Sword Art* is much stronger than the martial art Wu Chushu comprehended last time.

Given time, he will surely be able to comprehend an ultimate technique.

Everyone took a deep breath, filled with longing.

Next.

Bai Jinghong and Cao Mu went up one after another.

Cao Mu’s situation was similar to Wu Chushu’s.

Bai Jinghong, however, caused quite a stir.

Suddenly.

A white fish with silver scales, divine and agile, appeared in the pool water.

Elder Zeng’s voice was exceptionally loud this time:

“Bai Jinghong has comprehended a low-grade ultimate sword move!”

“Good. Although it is just one move, Jinghong has made great progress this time!”

The sound also reached those below.

The elders’ brows relaxed.

At Bai Jinghong’s age, to comprehend an ultimate technique is extremely rare even within the Hengyun Sword City.

With Divine Skills not appearing, Ultimate Techniques are almost the pinnacle of martial arts!

Everyone was stunned upon hearing this.

“Is Young Master Bai’s sword talent actually this high?”

“But he was easily defeated by that little girl on the擂台.”

“So... isn’t that little girl even more terrifying?”

“Young Master Bai even prostrated himself before Li Sword Immortal. Then our Li Sword Immortal... must be about to comprehend a Divine Skill?”

Whispers arose.

At the top of the Sword Tower.

Everyone’s eyes turned to Li Mo and the others.

At this moment, Elder Zeng spoke:

“Little girl, you go too.”

“I...”

Jiang Chulong bit her lip and turned back.

“Go for it.”

Li Mo executed his head-patting divine skill.

Seeing Li Ge’s encouraging gaze and feeling the warmth on her head, she nodded firmly.

She must not... let Li Ge down...

Then.

Under the gaze of everyone.

Jiang Chulong also walked to the strange stone.

*Swish—*

The next moment.

A touch of emerald green spread wildly within the pool water.
