# Chapter 55: He Upholds the Dignity of Zhongzhou!  

The city of Four Leaves fell into silence.  

All eyes were fixed on the bloodstained bundle at the feet of Elder Chen Xuan.  

The bundle, roughly round in shape, was soaked in blood. As Li Zhengjing threw it down, the cloth unfurled, revealing the ghastly, bloodied face within—the severed head of the Venom King, Xin Xuan!  

Was this truly the head of the infamous Venom King?  

The same Venom King Xin Xuan whom the combined forces of the Young Master of Kunlun Immortal Sect, the Chief True Disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, the Buddha Child of the Diamond Temple, the commander of the Great Zhou army, and numerous elders and inner disciples—over a thousand in total—had failed to capture?  

Everyone had assumed that the Venom King had escaped unscathed from Four Leaves City, humiliating all present.  

Yet now, an unremarkable inner disciple had casually tossed his head onto the ground like trash?  

"Li Zhengjing?"  

"They say he only joined the sect half a year ago and has been an inner disciple for barely a month."  

"How could a disciple who just attained Inner Breath cultivation be the one to take Xin Xuan’s head?"  

The atmosphere was heavy with silence, gradually broken by hushed murmurs among the disciples. Beyond disbelief, there was awe—and even fear.  

Earlier, when Li Zhengjing had spoken defiantly, many had deemed it outrageous. But now, his words seemed almost justified.  

"I failed to accomplish the task Elder Chen assigned me," Li Zhengjing said calmly. "But I accomplished something else—something Elder Chen would have given his life for and still failed to achieve."  

He continued slowly, "Had I followed Elder Chen’s orders to the letter, the Venom King would have escaped unharmed today. Tell me, Elder Chen—was your true intention to aid Xin Xuan in fleeing? Are you colluding with the Venom King?"  

Elder Chen Xuan’s face twisted in fury.  

"Outrageous!" he bellowed. "How dare you slander me?"  

Chen Yang stepped forward, sneering, "You think you can claim credit with a random head? You—"  

Li Zhengjing cut him off. "Everyone here can verify its authenticity. Chen Yang, I suggest you step back. If you crush Xin Xuan’s head underfoot in front of all these witnesses, someone will surely take yours in return."  

Chen Yang’s raised foot froze midair.  

Elder Chen Xuan roared, "How could a mere Inner Breath disciple like you possibly defeat the Venom King?"  

Chen Yang quickly added, "It must have been a senior from our sect who killed Xin Xuan but chose to remain anonymous. This brat merely picked up the head to claim credit!"  

Elder Chen Xuan’s eyes burned with accusation. "Then you admit this is Xin Xuan’s head—but you’re a fraud!"  

"Enough! Must you further disgrace yourselves?"  

A voice cut through the tension.  

The Chief True Disciple, Lu Huaiyuan, stepped forward. With a wave of his hand, the head flew into his grasp.  

The rough, savage face, the twisted expression of rage, the unseeing eyes—it was unmistakably the Venom King Xin Xuan.  

Lu Huaiyuan exhaled and addressed the crowd solemnly. "Regardless of who killed Xin Xuan, if the killer entrusted the head to Li Zhengjing, then the credit is his."  

"Well said," the Great Zhou army commander agreed, stepping forward. "Even if Xin Xuan had died within Four Leaves City and his corpse was transported elsewhere by the Star-Shifting Formation, the fact that Li Zhengjing brought back his head means the achievement is his."  

"Nonsense!"  

The Young Master of Kunlun strode forward, disdain written across his face. "After all these years, you still cling to your pathetic pride?"  

He swept his gaze over the crowd. "Xin Xuan escaped Four Leaves City unharmed. My sword did not even scratch him. That is the undeniable truth!"  

"Today, our arrogance has been shattered. We, who once believed ourselves invincible below the Immortal Realm, have been humiliated by Xin Xuan."  

He pointed at Li Zhengjing. "Yet this junior brother has restored our dignity. He took back what Xin Xuan stole from us!"  

The Buddha Child of the Diamond Temple clasped his hands and bowed to Li Zhengjing. "The Young Master speaks truly. Today, our lost honor was reclaimed by this junior brother."  

The Kunlun Young Master’s piercing gaze swept over the crowd.  

"We have disgraced Zhongzhou. But he has upheld its face and covered the shame of our failure!"  

"Those of you too shameless to acknowledge this debt—so be it. But I will not forget it."  

He turned to Lu Huaiyuan. "He has earned great merit today."  

Lu Huaiyuan nodded. "Merit deserves reward."  

Then he looked at Elder Chen Xuan. "As for the accusations of desertion—he merely refused to follow your orders. Clearly, his judgment was correct, while yours was flawed."  

Elder Chen Xuan’s face darkened, but he finally bowed his head. "He was right. I was wrong."  

Lu Huaiyuan declared, "Li Zhengjing will return to the mountain with me to receive his reward. Elder Chen, you may return to face disciplinary action."  

Elder Chen Xuan dared not argue further. He stepped back, though his gaze at Li Zhengjing was filled with complex emotions.  

Silence fell once more.  

With the Chief True Disciple’s decree, the matter was settled.  

The Venom King Xin Xuan, whom none could capture, had been slain by the inner disciple Li Zhengjing—a feat worthy of great honor.  

The Kunlun Young Master walked past Li Zhengjing.  

"I owe you a favor," he said quietly. "If you ever need aid, send word to Kunlun. I will do what I can."  

With that, he summoned his sword aura and vanished beyond the city walls.  

Xin Xuan’s death meant the trail to the mysterious "Creditor" had gone cold. He needed to seek new clues in the capital.  

Had someone else killed Xin Xuan, he might have suspected a cover-up. But since Xin Xuan had already escaped, there was no need for the mastermind to silence him.  

Thus, he believed Li Zhengjing had acted alone, without ulterior motives.  

He cared not how a young Inner Breath cultivator had slain the mighty Venom King, nor what secrets the boy might hold.  

His only concern now was that Xin Xuan’s death had buried the truth of the "Creditor."  

After the Kunlun Young Master departed, the Great Zhou commander prepared to withdraw his troops.  

"Junior Brother Li is truly a prodigy," the commander remarked with a smile. "Soon, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect will gain another True Disciple."  

He glanced at Lu Huaiyuan. "With such talent, he may one day surpass us all. Brother Lu, if you do not ascend to the Immortal Realm soon, your position as Chief may not remain secure."  

Lu Huaiyuan remained expressionless.  

The commander laughed heartily. "Since Xin Xuan died at the hands of the Feather Transformation Sect, his head shall remain with you. After verification, it may be submitted to the imperial court."  

With that, he led his troops away.  

The Diamond Temple’s Buddha Child approached Li Zhengjing.  

"I had hoped for your assistance, but I never imagined you would slay Xin Xuan outright," he said with a smile. "I underestimated you—my apologies."  

He added, "Do you still have the prayer beads I gave you?"  

Li Zhengjing returned the courtesy. "I retrieved them earlier. Would the Buddha Child like them back?"  

"I gifted them as payment. I will not take them back. Keep them—they may prove useful."  

The Buddha Child smiled. "I already owed you one favor. Now I owe another. If you ever need help, I shall do my best. And rest assured, I will take good care of Shi Fang when I return with him to the mountain."  

He sighed. "A great sect does not rely on one individual’s strength, but on the collective might of its disciples."  

"When I inherit leadership of the Diamond Temple, Shi Fang will become my right hand—a pillar of our sect."  

With a final glance at Lu Huaiyuan, who nodded in acknowledgment, the Buddha Child clasped his hands and departed.  

Li Zhengjing turned his attention back to the crowd, his gaze settling on Lu Huaiyuan.  

Lu Huaiyuan’s expression was calm. "Once Four Leaves City is secured, we return to the mountain."
