# Chapter 173: The Fisherman

The elderly Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator remained motionless but was prepared to strike at any moment. 

He was still skeptical—aside from the Foundation Establishment cultivators within his clan, even the younger generation didn't know of this place's existence. This was the Wei Clan's greatest secret. 

A Qi Refining cultivator appearing here was beyond his comprehension. 

He wanted to contact Wei Lin outside through the formation to inquire about the Qi Refining cultivator before making a decision. 

But Li Shiming didn't hesitate. With a flick of his spiritual sense, a jade sword shot toward the elderly Foundation Establishment cultivator. 

Had this been a normal early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, Li Shiming wouldn't have dared to use a spiritual sense attack. 

Spiritual sense attacks were double-edged swords—if the attacker's spiritual sense was stronger, it became the most potent offensive method. But if weaker, the backlash could severely damage the attacker's mind. 

The elderly Foundation Establishment cultivator before him was in a state of decline, likely moving as little as possible to prolong his life. 

Such a cultivator, despite having purer spiritual energy, was at the lowest point of his life in terms of both physical and mental faculties. 

As expected, Li Shiming's spiritual sense jade sword struck. The elderly cultivator sensed the attack, but his long-dormant body couldn't react in time. 

Moreover, the jade sword was faster than a flying sword. In this confined hall, even if he had been prepared, dodging would have been impossible. 

"Ah!" The elderly cultivator let out a pained cry. 

Still, as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, even with his weakened mind due to age, a single spiritual sense attack wasn't enough to kill him. 

The jade sword only caused a violent shock to his mind, inducing excruciating pain. 

At the same time, Li Shiming's doppelganger appeared in the hall. 

Having fought a Foundation Establishment cultivator before, Li Shiming knew how to exploit his strengths and avoid his weaknesses. 

The doppelganger stepped forward instantly, a third-grade sword foundation materializing in its hand as it slashed toward the elderly cultivator. 

Just as the blade was about to strike, a glow of spiritual energy shielded the old man. 

Though a rogue cultivator, the Wei Clan was among the wealthier rogue clans, occupying a market town and even capable of seizing other resources. 

The elderly cultivator had a passive defensive spiritual artifact that blocked the doppelganger's attack. 

At that moment, Li Shiming's true body arrived, slashing down with his own third-grade sword foundation. 

Unlike the doppelganger, this strike carried sword intent, causing the defensive artifact to tremble violently. 

Simultaneously, the doppelganger unleashed another spiritual sense jade sword, piercing the elderly cultivator's mind and plunging him back into agony. 

"Clang! Clang! Clang!" 

Li Shiming's true body and doppelganger worked like skilled blacksmiths, hammering away at the elderly cultivator as if he were molten iron. 

The terrifying force, combined with the sword intent from the true body, made the old man's body shudder uncontrollably. 

The poor elderly cultivator, barely recovering from one attack, would immediately suffer another spiritual sense strike, rendering him helpless in a cycle of pain. 

Li Shiming seized this advantage ruthlessly. 

From the start of the battle, the elderly cultivator had been trapped in agony, unable to counterattack. 

After dozens of strikes, the defensive artifact finally failed, clattering to the ground. 

The true body's sword swept across the old man's neck, sending his head flying. 

The doppelganger's spiritual sense swept over, moving the bloodied corpse aside. 

With the body removed, Li Shiming saw a jade floor beneath where the old man had been sitting, engraved with intricate patterns—a formation control core made of specialized materials. 

The high-level formation master who designed the Wei Clan's defenses had clearly put great effort into it. Likely because the Wei Clan lacked formation experts, the core had been made foolproof. 

No wonder Li Shiming's seventy-two formation flags outside the cave hadn't been detected—the formation's control was in the hands of this ignorant old man. 

Li Shiming's spiritual sense probed the core, instantly grasping the entire formation's layout. 

Every node, every spiritual energy pathway—all permissions now belonged to him. 

He saw the three Iron Clan Foundation Establishment cultivators still attacking, though their frequency had slowed. 

After all, prolonged assaults would drain their spiritual energy, leaving them unable to fight, let alone kill the Wei Clan's defenders. 

A thought crossed Li Shiming's mind. 

He manipulated the formation, opening a passage for one of the Iron Clan's early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. 

The cultivator's weapon plunged into the formation, and believing he had breached it, he instinctively charged inside. 

The moment he crossed the barrier, it sealed behind him. 

The other two Iron Clan cultivators were stunned—their attacks hadn't broken through. 

They rushed to inspect the spot where their companion had vanished, but the barrier remained intact. 

"Damn it, Third Brother's been trapped!" the mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator exclaimed. Turning to the thirty-odd followers, he barked, "All of you, attack together!" 

With no other choice, they had to break the formation quickly, or their comrade inside would surely perish. 

Though the Qi Refining cultivators' combined strength was limited, every bit of force helped drain the formation's energy. 

Losing a Foundation Establishment cultivator would be a devastating blow to the Iron Clan. 

In these chaotic times, the weakened Iron Clan would lose all offensive capability, forced into a defensive stance. 

Given time, other factions would grow stronger, and the Iron Clan would meet the same fate as the Wei Clan. 

Inside the stronghold, the Iron Clan cultivator locked eyes with Wei Lin. 

Neither knew how the other had gotten in, but words were pointless now. 

Both wielded supreme-grade magical weapons, their blades clashing with metallic rings. 

As fellow early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators who knew each other well, their duel was evenly matched from the start. 

A Wei Clan Qi Refining cultivator caught in the crossfire was sent flying, slamming into a wall before collapsing, blood gushing from his mouth, his aura dissipating. 

"Fall back!" Wei Lin ordered sharply. 

The Wei Clan's remaining forces were mostly juniors and a few outsiders raised by the clan. 

Losing any of them pained Wei Lin. 

He regretted sending most of the clan's forces to seize a spirit mine, leaving them reliant solely on the formation. 

The Qi Refining cultivators tried to retreat but found the formation blocking their path—Li Shiming's doing. 

He had trapped the Iron Clan cultivator, Wei Lin, and the Qi Refining disciples together, ensuring a brutal fight. 

The Iron Clan cultivator wouldn't let them escape. Killing Wei Clan disciples would destabilize Wei Lin. 

Darting forward, he began slaughtering the immobilized Qi Refining cultivators. 

"Iron Third, you dare?!" Wei Lin roared. 

He unleashed his supreme-grade sword, but Iron Third merely grinned, countering with his own. 

The collision sent shockwaves that flung the remaining Qi Refining cultivators aside, leaving them dead or grievously wounded. 

"You did this, not me!" Iron Third taunted. 

Wei Lin's eyes burned with rage. Among the dead were his direct descendants. 

With nothing left to lose, he drew three talismans, each containing a full-powered early-stage Foundation Establishment strike. 

These were the Wei Clan's trump cards, crafted by their sole Foundation Establishment talisman master, now too old to make more. 

Iron Third paled, spitting three mouthfuls of blood onto his sword, his face twisting with reluctance. 

"Explode!" 

"Die!" 

Both shouted simultaneously. 

The talismans transformed into three icy blades, shattering Iron Third's defensive artifact before tearing into his body, sending him flying. 

Meanwhile, Iron Third's supreme-grade sword detonated near Wei Lin. 

The blast crippled Wei Lin's sword, its fragments and unleashed spiritual energy shredding through his defenses. 

Wei Lin was sent sprawling, his body pierced in multiple places. 

The battle ended in mutual destruction—two evenly matched cultivators, fighting to the death, had crippled each other. 

"Cough... Once Big Brother breaks the formation, your Wei Clan is finished!" Iron Third spat blood but remained defiant. 

He assumed Wei Lin's injury meant the formation was unmanned, making it easier to breach. 

"Cough... You think our clan has only one Foundation Establishment cultivator?" Wei Lin retorted, equally confident. 

He knew the elderly Foundation Establishment elder controlled the formation. Though frail, the elder could easily finish off the wounded Iron Third. 

Both glared at each other, convinced of their impending victory. 

Then footsteps approached. 

A figure emerged—Li Shiming's doppelganger. 

Wei Lin hesitated, not recognizing him, while Iron Third scoffed at the Qi Refining ninth-level cultivator. 

"To die by a pretty boy's hand—what a disgrace!" 

The doppelganger answered with a sword stroke. 

The Golden Strike Sword pierced Iron Third's skull, then wheeled to Wei Lin, ending his life mid-glare. 

Calmly, the doppelganger collected the fallen storage bags before deploying thirty-six formation flags—his last reserves. 

Embedding them throughout the stronghold, he reinforced the formation, enhancing its control and defenses. 

Inside the cave, Li Shiming smiled. 

A high-level formation master, a meticulously designed formation, and a superior spirit vein—this setup could withstand Foundation Establishment assaults. 

Unlike the Wei Clan, he knew how to maximize the formation's potential. 

Unless a Golden Core cultivator appeared, this stronghold was his. 

And if one did come? 

He'd use the formation to buy time and flee. 

Besides, Golden Core cultivators wouldn't bother with a minor clan's assets—the cost of hiring one would outweigh the gains. 

Li Shiming hadn't expected such an easy victory. 

He'd only intended to exploit the Wei Clan's troubles for some profit. 

Yet fortune had favored him beyond expectation.
