# Chapter 78: Talisman Sales

The commotion around Chu Ning's place naturally drew the attention of the other nearby shops. Other cultivators who had heard whispers couldn't help but inquire with Luo Yiping, Gu Xiaoqing, and the others. Luo Yiping disdained to say anything, merely grunting in response to inquiries. Gu Xiaoqing, however, patiently explained.

"Junior Brother Chu is a dual-sect disciple of our Azure Stream Sect's Hundred Arts Hall and Talisman Pavilion. He indeed manages both of these shops alone."

The Azure Stream Sect had actually sent a young dual-sect disciple, with one person simultaneously responsible for two shops. The crowd originally gathered in front of Chu Ning's shop, upon hearing the news, went from skepticism to fervent discussion. Some even from Luo Yiping and Gu Xiaoqing's neighboring shops turned to watch Chu Ning's side.

But watching was just watching. Perhaps Chu Ning was too young, or perhaps it was because this dual-sect disciple Chu Ning was only at the fourth level of Qi Condensation, leading to doubts about his abilities. No one stepped forward to inquire about a purchase. From a distance, Luo Yiping saw this and immediately let out a light laugh. Especially when a quarter of an hour passed, and people gradually left Chu Ning's shop without anyone making an inquiry, Luo Yiping, watching from nearby, sneered repeatedly. He transmitted a message to Shen Zhengquan and Gu Xiaoqing:

"Now you've seen it too. People don't even want to enter his door. This Junior Brother Chu, he's truly capable."

Shen Zhengquan shook his head, unsure of what he meant. Gu Xiaoqing didn't reply, merely furrowing her brows slightly. Chu Ning's brows also unconsciously furrowed a little at this moment.

He had just deliberately taken a stroll around the market, mainly to check out the talisman sales point in Wind Gorge Valley. To understand the situation better, he even specifically asked someone to help him buy a few talismans. After examining the purchased talismans, Chu Ning gained immense confidence. For low-grade primary talismans of the same type, the quality of his own talismans was absolutely superior to theirs. After all, the Talisman Source Spirit Body talent's enhancement of talisman quality during crafting was substantial and tangible. So, Chu Ning decided to directly match their prices. Higher quality talismans at the same price, buyers would naturally know how to choose.

However, even fragrant wine fears a deep alley. No matter how good the talismans were, if they couldn't be sold, their value wouldn't be realized.

"It seems I'll have to employ some tactics," Chu Ning secretly shook his head. Originally, he just wanted to quietly make a fortune, without being too high-profile or ostentatious. But without income, this shop couldn't function. The Talisman Pavilion shop, according to sect regulations, had to submit 500 spirit stones a month. The Spirit Plant House was lower, only requiring 200 spirit stones. Together, that was 700 spirit stones. If his shop didn't open for business, he couldn't afford the losses.

Thinking this, Chu Ning casually took out a pre-prepared wooden sign from his storage bag and wrote a line of large characters on it.

"Grand Opening Day: Buy Five Talismans, Get One Free!"

Immediately, with a simple Object Manipulation spell, he hung this incredibly conspicuous sign directly outside the shop. For Chu Ning, who had transmigrated, he had far too many promotional tactics he could employ. And now, he had simply chosen the easiest one.

Facts proved that Chu Ning's move was indeed effective. The sign had only been hung for a moment when a man around thirty years old, looking like a rogue cultivator, after glancing at the sign Chu Ning had hung, walked into the shop and approached Chu Ning.

"Shopkeeper, your talismans are advertised as 'buy five get one free'. Does that mean if I buy five talismans, I get one free?"

Chu Ning nodded, "Precisely. If fellow cultivator buys five spirit talismans of the same price, I can give you one for free."

"Is there any issue with the talisman quality?" the man asked hesitantly.

Chu Ning directly took out a talisman and handed it to the other party. "Produced by the Azure Stream Sect, quality is naturally guaranteed."

The man took the talisman and examined it, a hint of joy appearing on his face. "The quality of this talisman is indeed good, seemingly even higher than those from Wind Gorge Valley."

Chu Ning smiled, but did not reply. The man put down the talisman and then asked Chu Ning again: "What if I buy with a companion, but he wants to buy defensive talismans? Is that also allowed?"

"Group purchases are supported," Chu Ning continued with a smile. "If fellow cultivator wishes to buy defensive talismans, you can certainly combine them with attack talismans to reach the quantity. If you buy four 2-spirit stone talismans and one 3-spirit stone talisman, I can still give you one 2-spirit stone talisman for free."

Hearing this, the man immediately turned and beckoned an older man to come forward. The two discussed briefly and quickly decided, jointly purchasing two Blazing Fire Talismans, one Profound Ice Talisman, one Revival Talisman, and one Earth Armor Talisman. Chu Ning also allowed them to choose another Blazing Fire Talisman as the free gift. The two men immediately left, happily holding their talismans.

With these two men making a purchase, everyone understood what was happening. Instantly, the discussions around grew even louder. Especially when the man who had just made the purchase said that the quality of Chu Ning's talismans was actually higher than those from Wind Gorge Valley, many people were incredibly surprised. Afterwards, one or two more people came forward to inquire about purchases. However, they did not buy as many as five, just single ones. But for those who frequently dealt with talismans, they could still clearly perceive that the quality of these talismans was indeed very high. For a time, it surprised many people greatly.

The market itself wasn't particularly large. The talismans from Azure Stream Talisman Shop were of higher quality than those from Wind Gorge Talisman Shop, and you even got a free one if you bought more. This news quickly spread throughout the market.

***

In the middle of Yanji Market street, a grey-robed youth, twenty-four or five years old, was constantly looking around. Whenever he encountered a solitary cultivator, he would actively step forward to inquire about something. However, several people in a row ignored him. Finally, when he asked a beautiful female cultivator of over thirty, she stopped.

"Are you serious? The quality of talismans at Azure Stream Talisman Shop is really higher than those from Wind Gorge Valley, and you get a free one if you buy five?"

The beautiful young woman glanced at the grey-robed youth. The youth immediately replied, "It's truly real. I just went to see for myself. I want to buy 3 talismans. Fellow cultivator, I wonder if you have any plans to buy talismans? If so, we could combine our purchases. Buying 3 talismans together can save you one low-grade spirit stone!"

Upon hearing this, the young woman's face showed some interest, and she finally nodded, saying: "Alright, let's go take a look then."

Upon hearing this, the grey-robed youth's face immediately lit up with joy. He led the young woman to Chu Ning's talisman shop. After inquiring for a bit, both of them each took out 5 spirit stones. They then each happily left with 3 talismans.

After all, before this, although talismans were not rare items in large sects, they were quite popular in Yanji Market. A situation like buying talismans and getting a free one was almost unheard of. After a few such sales, the news of Chu Ning's talisman shop promotion spread even wider. Almost every short while, cultivators would come forward to make purchases. Moreover, it was mostly groups of several people pooling their resources to buy. Chu Ning's Azure Stream Talisman Shop's business was subtly becoming the most popular in the market.

Seeing the considerable foot traffic at Chu Ning's side and how well his talismans were selling, the other disciples from the Azure Stream Sect were also greatly surprised. Even Luo Yiping, who had initially observed Chu Ning with cold indifference, was slightly taken aback. The foot traffic at their respective shops was normal, but compared to Chu Ning's, it was significantly less.
