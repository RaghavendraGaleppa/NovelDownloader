# Chapter 125: Am I a Nascent Soul Grandmaster?

"Fellow Daoist, mercy is a virtue."

As Lin Shan's consciousness traversed the void within the straw effigy to the other side, these were the first words he heard.

The thatched cottage was simple and unadorned, without even a bed—only Bear Mountain Master lying quietly on a straw mat, with a gray-robed elder sitting beside him.

The elder looked like an ordinary mortal farmer, his hands covered with calluses, his trouser legs stained with undried mud, and small fragments of dry leaves clinging to his hair bun. At a glance, he appeared to be a reclusive master of profound cultivation.

Lin Shan's mouth felt dry, and he couldn't utter a word.

Even if he wanted to speak, his words couldn't reach the other side. Separated by tens of thousands of miles of sea, he had only crossed over through the void channel opened by his divine ability.

The gray-robed elder on the other side had a serene expression, his cultivation level unfathomable. With a single glance, he locked onto Lin Shan's consciousness in the void and shook his head at him.

"Fellow Daoist's curse technique is truly astonishing. However, using it on a mere Foundation Establishment junior seems rather like bullying the weak."

As Lin Shan listened, he gradually realized something—this Pure Lotus Hermit seemed to mistake him for a peer of equal cultivation level?

Bear Mountain Master on the straw mat slowly regained consciousness at this moment. Seeing the gray-robed elder conversing with the void, his face revealed a mix of shock and uncertainty.

Pure Lotus Hermit, with his extraordinary abilities, could sense Lin Shan's "consciousness" still lingering in the void. Seizing the opportunity, he continued to persuade him.

"Fellow Daoist, this junior acted foolishly and offended you. A small punishment is enough—why insist on taking his life?"

"How about I act as a mediator to resolve this karma?"

"An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind..."

The more Lin Shan listened, the stranger his expression became. Did Pure Lotus Hermit have any connection to Bear Mountain Master?

If they were related, that would make sense. But if not, why go to such lengths to mediate? Was there something special about Bear Mountain Master that set him apart from others?

As Lin Shan pondered and speculated, Bear Mountain Master on the straw mat suddenly scrambled up and, following the gray-robed elder's gaze, began kowtowing vigorously toward the void where Lin Shan's consciousness resided.

"Senior, spare me! Have mercy on this little bear!"

"This little bear admits his mistake! This little bear dares not anymore!"

"You are magnanimous—please let me go like passing wind!"

...

Bear Mountain Master wept bitterly, his pleas for mercy filled with remorse, his appearance so pitiful it would move anyone who saw it to tears!

The gray-robed elder beside him extended a calloused hand and patted Bear Mountain Master's large head. The latter immediately burst into tears, clinging to the elder's mud-stained trouser legs and wailing loudly.

Watching this scene, how could Lin Shan not understand what was happening?

Bear Mountain Master had no idea whom he had offended and felt no genuine remorse!

He had simply been psychologically traumatized by the twenty-plus days of curses and was terrified of Lin Shan.

After all, Pure Lotus Hermit had already assumed the curse caster was a peer of equal cultivation, and Bear Mountain Master naturally believed it without question. He thought he had somehow indirectly offended a Nascent Soul grandmaster, who was now making life difficult for him.

Upon learning this "truth," Bear Mountain Master was scared out of his wits! I'm just a tiny Foundation Establishment shrimp—was it necessary to torment me like this?

What the two in the thatched cottage didn't know was that Lin Shan was no grandmaster. His cultivation was even inferior to theirs, and he couldn't transmit words across the void—only his consciousness was present.

Lin Shan could also sense Pure Lotus Hermit's attitude. Despite repeatedly mentioning "reconciliation," there wasn't the slightest hint of compromise in his tone.

Every word carried an air of unquestionable authority—this person is under my protection.

Not once did he mention offering any compensation, only demanding that Lin Shan unilaterally cease the curse.

Since when did the world work like that?

Feeling that his main body could no longer hold the bowstring, Lin Shan's consciousness had no choice but to withdraw from the other side.

The moment he left, another crisp sound of impact rang out. Within the thatched cottage, Bear Mountain Master's body suddenly radiated Buddhist light. Starting from a single point, ripples spread outward before finally calming down.

How could the two not realize this was another strike and warning from the other side?

Bear Mountain Master's face paled with fear, his mouth bitter. The grandmaster on the other side clearly had no intention of letting him go.

It seemed even Pure Lotus Hermit's face wasn't enough to sway him.

"Do not worry. The Prajna Vajra divine ability I planted in you is specifically designed to counter such sinister and bizarre techniques."

"If he tries a few more times, he'll give up out of frustration."

Bear Mountain Master hurriedly kowtowed in gratitude, though inwardly he was puzzled. This Nascent Soul grandmaster had no prior connection to him. Why go to such lengths to help him reconcile?

Wasn't he afraid of offending another peer? Unless there was something about him worth coveting...

As he pondered, his pants suddenly tore with a loud rip, and a purple tentacle tail emerged.

It swayed left and right as if stretching after being confined for too long.

"Senior, this—"

"This tentacle is beyond my ability to remove for now. Unlike the others I've already cleared, this one has taken root in your dantian. Forcibly extracting it would likely destroy your cultivation."

---

"Does that mean I'm doomed?"

"Not necessarily. I sense this thing has its own consciousness and has formed a parasitic relationship with you. If utilized properly, it might turn misfortune into blessing."

The gray-robed elder stroked his beard, thoughtfully observing the purple "tail" swaying behind Bear Mountain Master.

Back in the dark cave dwelling on the other side of the void.

Lin Shan's expression was calm, his silence profound. He quietly packed away the various ritual tools in the corner and extinguished the two candles.

Pulling open the curtains, sunlight streamed in from the mountainside, breathing life into the long-darkened space.

He sat cross-legged once more, taking out the Bi Luo Pill given by the Black Lotus Sect, and began cultivating alone. Despite the interference of a Nascent Soul grandmaster, he wasn't as furious as one might expect. Everything seemed to return to normal.

But those who knew him well would understand—this matter was far from over. It had only just begun.

"Pure Lotus Hermit, Bear Mountain Master."

"Very well..."

In the following days, Lin Shan refrained from provoking Bear Mountain Master's fragile nerves. He knew that with the old man's protection, he stood no chance of success for now.

But time was on his side. The initiative was his. Pure Lotus Hermit couldn't protect Bear Mountain Master forever. Once Lin Shan's cultivation advanced, everything would resolve itself.

Half a year passed in peaceful cultivation, the sea calm and undisturbed. His subordinates steadily consolidated the faith of the凡人 on various islands.

Everything progressed smoothly. Once the one-year term ended, he could return to headquarters to report.

However, the weather is unpredictable, and human fortunes are ever-changing. On an otherwise ordinary day, while secluded in his cave dwelling, Lin Shan suddenly heard a thunderous shout from outside.

"Who is in charge of this sea region?"

"Show yourself!"

The echo reverberated across the entire Xiayi Island, shaking Lin Shan's cave dwelling violently. Teacups and potted plants in the chamber crashed to the ground. For a moment, he thought enemies had come knocking!

Stepping out of his dwelling, he looked up.

The sky was filled with a swarm of cultivators—over a hundred of them.

Each rode flying swords, their robes a mix of black, red, and green. All were at least at the Foundation Establishment stage, with over a dozen Golden Core elders leading them.

"Joint Investigation Team of the Three Demonic Sects here on official business."

"The person in charge of this sea region, step forward immediately."

Lin Shan sucked in a cold breath. What could warrant such a grand display? Had he done something wrong? Had his secret pilfering of the Buddha statue's信仰 been exposed?

Wait—no! When had he ever stolen anything? This was merely an idea, not yet acted upon!

But with them at his doorstep, he couldn't ignore them.

Swallowing his unease, Lin Shan mustered his courage and flew up to meet them. Under the stern gazes of a hundred cultivators, he clasped his fists.

"I am Lin Shan, emissary of the Black Lotus Sect and temporary overseer of Xiayi Sea Region. Greetings, Seniors."

The leader, a middle-aged man in blood-red robes, showed no emotion as he mechanically produced a token and flashed it briefly.

Before Lin Shan could get a good look, the man tucked it away again.

"I am Yin Wuming, captain of the Joint Investigation Team of the Three Demonic Sects and protector of the Blood River Hall."

"The remnants of the East Sea, Turtle Sage and his disciple, have fled into nearby waters."

"In the coming days, you are to personally lead a thorough search. All actions must comply unconditionally with our directives."

"Anyone who dares to feign compliance while resisting—"

The Blood River Hall's Golden Core protector coldly spat out a single word.

"Die!"
