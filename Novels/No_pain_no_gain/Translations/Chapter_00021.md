# Chapter 21: Impossible! You Have a Spiritual Root Too?!

Han Zhen was grateful that he had always arranged for disciples to monitor Divine Hand Valley, which allowed him not to miss this good show.

He had originally thought that Doctor Mo was just threatening Han Li, telling him not to be smart and deliberately delay his cultivation progress. But it turned out that because he had rescued Zhang Tie, a series of unforeseen events had occurred, forcing Mo Juren to advance his body possession plan.

Han Zhen concealed all his aura, observing this 'discarding one's pawns after they have served their purpose' from a place where Mo Juren could not detect him.

Han Li somewhat regretted why he hadn't understood earlier that destiny could only be grasped in one's own hands. He had actually harbored a trace of illusion about Doctor Mo, believing that once he could control the strength of the pseudo-qi, he could slowly contend with Doctor Mo, even losing his guard. Even the techniques he had painstakingly practiced, such as the Blinking Sword Art and Flowing Smoke Steps, during Doctor Mo's absence, had no chance to be used.

Although Mo Juren looked like he was about to cough to death at any moment, his hands were still like refined iron, gripping Han Li's neck and leading him towards a stone chamber in Divine Hand Valley. Han Li was completely suppressed, without even a hope of escape.

Han Zhen followed the two like a ghost. After losing the Cloud-Winged Bird, Doctor Mo had no energy to cultivate a second one, completely unaware that everything he did was under Han Zhen's watchful eye.

The five senses of the sixth layer of Qi Condensation had significantly enhanced compared to the fourth layer. Han Zhen believed that the sublimation at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation should have given birth to divine sense. The sixth layer of Qi Condensation was even more mysterious, allowing perception to extend to places beyond what the eyes could see.

Inside the stone chamber, Mo Juren was using beast bone powder to draw a strange array, while simultaneously muttering something in a low voice. Combined with the eerie atmosphere in the stone chamber, it made people feel a chilling terror, as if a cold qi was slowly rising within the room.

Even though Yu Zitong's primordial spirit, hidden within Mo Juren's body, had repeatedly emphasized that a body cultivated to the fourth layer of the Evergreen Arts was most suitable for body possession, Mo Juren could no longer afford to wait.

Finally, Doctor Mo completed the array. He took out a silver blade in front of Han Li. Han Li's heart filled with fear, but reason told him that Doctor Mo had spent so much effort over the years; it definitely wasn't just to take his life now. It might be something even more terrifying than death!

Just as Han Li had thought, Mo Juren inserted a total of seven silver sharp blades into specific parts of his own body in front of Han Li.

"Seven Devils Devouring Souls!" Mo Juren roared.

The black mist that Han Li had vaguely seen on Doctor Mo's face finally revealed its true appearance to him. The jet-black demonic entities, like masks with tentacles, danced wildly, their ghostly heads sucking blood essence!

Han Li was somewhat stunned, because Doctor Mo was sitting cross-legged right opposite him. All the bizarre phenomena that had occurred in front of him in such a short time were perfectly clear in his eyes.

Han Li, who was experiencing the world of cultivators for the first time, was completely awestruck by this miraculous power. The existence of ghosts and spirits in reality overturned his previous understanding. The shock it caused him was even greater than that of the small green bottle, that heaven-defying treasure. For a moment, facing such non-human power, Han Li felt how ridiculous all his previous preparations were.

After performing the secret technique, Mo Juren's appearance reverted to that of a man in his thirties, in the prime of his life. Not only that, his jet-black hair and tall, upright physique all indicated that his physical strength and energy were at their peak.

Upon seeing Mo Juren's appearance, Han Zhen had the same thought as Han Li: an impulse to smash his face with a punch.

Mo Juren seemed to be lingering in this body for the last time, his consciousness somewhat dazed as he stood still. Han Zhen pondered the timing of his move. Although he knew that such a coincidental appearance would certainly cause Han Li to become suspicious, this was also the result Han Zhen desired. Little Li would eventually become Old Devil Han.

After a long while, Mo Juren finally pulled out a small silk-folded pouch from his bosom, then took out a wrinkled yellow paper from it. Doctor Mo carefully smoothed out the yellow paper; several strange symbols shimmered with silver light upon it.

Han Zhen's divine sense perceived this yellow paper, and he immediately felt a mysterious power stirring, almost causing the spiritual power within his body to lose control and expose his aura. If he remembered correctly, this should be a Spirit-Calming Talisman. Evidently, this item was destined for him.

This Spirit-Calming Talisman, when used against mortals, could naturally completely stiffen their bodies, even rendering them unable to speak. But against cultivators with a certain amount of spiritual power, its effect was slightly weaker. Although it could still immobilize lower-level cultivators, their speech and various facial expressions would remain unaffected.

"Han Li, don't blame me, I have no choice. May you be reborn early."

"This body of yours, with a spiritual root, shall be inherited by me!"

Han Li was shocked to his core by Doctor Mo's words. He finally understood what Doctor Mo's greedy gaze towards him had been seeking. Beads of sweat dripped from Han Li's forehead. He bit his lip hard, frantically urging the spiritual power of the Evergreen Arts, wanting to break free from his acupoints.

"Such a good thing, it would be a waste to use it here." Han Zhen's voice, like a heavenly melody, echoed in Han Li's and Doctor Mo's ears.

Before his voice faded, Mo Juren, who was holding the yellow paper and preparing to chant a spell, saw a fist the size of a sandbag smash violently into his face. The Spirit-Calming Talisman, which he had been carefully holding in his right hand, naturally vanished.

"Brother Zhen?" Han Li was a mixture of surprise and joy.

Han Zhen held nothing back with that punch. Thanks to the instantaneous acceleration of his Flowing Smoke Steps, and Mo Juren's complete focus on the body possession ritual, the latter had utterly failed to anticipate the presence of a third party.

Han Zhen tucked the Spirit-Calming Talisman into his bosom and casually removed the restrictions on Han Li.

He saw that Doctor Mo's neck couldn't even be straightened. His formerly robust body seemed to deflate, instantly aging, yet he still managed to stagger to his feet.

"Ahhh! You brat! You despicable mortal actually dared to ruin my grand plan!" Mo Juren roared, whether from pain or fury.

The ghostly mist around him flickered erratically from Han Zhen's punch, threatening to dissipate at any moment. With each roll of the ghostly mist, Mo Juren's body shriveled further.

Mo Juren was knocked out of the array's range, and the Spirit-Calming Talisman was stolen. Pushed to a dead end, he could only stake everything on one desperate gamble!

Mo Juren sacrificed all his vital essence, finally gaining enough spiritual power to support his primordial spirit leaving his body. A thumb-sized yellow sphere of light floated out from Mo Juren's body; even without the Spirit-Calming Talisman, he was prepared to fight to the death.

"Yu Zitong, if you don't come out now, both of us will die!"

Following the yellow light sphere, a much larger green light sphere also appeared right behind it. Han Li finally understood who Mo Juren had been conversing with. The yellow light sphere darted straight towards Han Li. He hoped the green light sphere would unleash a spell to deal with Han Zhen, who had suddenly burst into the stone chamber. He just needed to succeed in body possession; afterward, he would have ample means to deal with Han Zhen.

He was but a split second away from rushing into Han Li's body when he found his yellow primordial spirit illuminated green by a brilliant green light. His primordial spirit sensed the astonished and terrified cry transmitted from Yu Zitong's primordial spirit.

"A magic tool!"

"Evergreen Arts sixth layer! You have a spiritual root too!!"
