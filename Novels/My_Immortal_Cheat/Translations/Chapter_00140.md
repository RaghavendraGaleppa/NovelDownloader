# Chapter 140: You Have Nine Seconds

Everyone looked back, only to see a young man in a green robe calling out to them. He had a handsome face, bright eyes, and a jade crown on his head, exuding an extraordinary aura.

"Zheng Yusheng, what do you want?!" Zhou Xunchuan frowned slightly, staring at the man in front of him with displeasure.

"I wish to challenge a friend from Tianqin to a duel," Zheng Yusheng said gently, unfazed by Zhou Xunchuan's tone.

Zhou Tian looked at Zheng Yusheng. This person was one of those who had just occupied a section of the area by himself, definitely a heavenly talent on the same level as Zhou Xunchuan. He just wondered who he wanted to challenge; it couldn't be him, right?

"Who do you want to challenge?" Zhou Xunchuan's brows furrowed even deeper. Zhou Tian didn't know, but he knew this person was a genius from Daluo Academy, and his target was very likely Zhou Tian.

"Fellow Daoist Zhou Tian," Zheng Yusheng smiled faintly and said slowly.

Zhou Tian was slightly surprised. Me? Challenging me? Interesting.

"Zheng Yusheng!" Zhou Xunchuan yelled, "If you want to fight, I'll accompany you to the end!"

"Every wrong has a head, every debt has a master. Some of our juniors were humiliated in your Tianqin. I must get our dignity back," Zheng Yusheng ignored Zhou Xunchuan's sharp retort and continued to speak with a smile.

Zhou Tian realized with a start. So, he was from Daluo Academy. No wonder he was targeted.

"Of course, Fellow Daoist Zhou Tian can choose not to accept. After all, a challenge isn't compulsory. However, if you don't accept, then Fellow Daoist Zhou Tian will have to avoid places where our Daluo Academy disciples frequent, giving us a wide berth." Zheng Yusheng's tone was mild, but his words were utterly humiliating.

People nearby who were about to leave stopped in their tracks, their gazes drawn to the scene. It seemed there was a good show to watch, full of tension.

"You're courting death!" Zhou Xunchuan roared, divine light flashing in his eyes, runes swirling around his fingers and palms. The others also looked at him with displeasure.

"I accept." Zhou Tian stepped forward, walked up to Zheng Yusheng, and said in a deep voice.

"Good, Brother Zhou Tian is indeed a hero of this age, living up to his reputation!" Zheng Yusheng clapped his hands and laughed heartily, praising him. "Brother Zhou Tian, set a date. I am ready anytime."

Zhou Tian thought for a moment. Dealing with this guy wouldn't take much effort, so he said, "Since you're ready anytime, how about today then? Let's not waste everyone's time."

Zheng Yusheng was slightly taken aback but quickly reacted, "Brother Daoist is indeed straightforward. Today it is! Please, Brother Daoist, let's go to the arena!"

"Zhou Tian..." Tian Ling called out with a worried expression. Zhou Xunchuan and the others also frowned deeply. With that Great Emperor watching, there was no danger to life, but what they feared was Zheng Yusheng humiliating Zhou Tian. This was their real concern. However, Zhou Tian had already agreed, and they couldn't stop him.

"Don't worry, I'll be back in the time it takes to brew a cup of tea," Zhou Tian comforted them.

Zheng Yusheng's expression remained unchanged. He wasn't angered by Zhou Tian's disdain. In his mind, Zhou Tian was just a parasite relying on his family, so there was no need to get angry.

"Zheng Yusheng, a simple fight isn't very interesting. How about we add some stakes?" Zhou Tian spoke, plotting how to trick this guy.

"Oh? Please, Brother Daoist, speak." Zheng Yusheng also seemed interested.

"How about this: if you lose, you can't appear anywhere I am in the future, and vice versa. What do you think?" Zhou Tian slightly altered what he had just said. What Zheng Yusheng had said earlier was too unrealistic; it couldn't possibly include an entire faction's people. He had only said it to provoke Zhou Tian.

"Agreed." Zheng Yusheng nodded, accepting Zhou Tian's suggestion.

"Alright, for fairness, I'll give you ten seconds. If you can touch the corner of my clothes, I lose. After ten seconds, you're on your own." Zhou Tian thought again, feeling he was being a bit too much, so he suggested.

"Haha, Brother Zhou Tian is quite humorous!" Zheng Yusheng laughed heartily, as if he had heard something incredibly funny. Although he didn't know what confidence Zhou Tian, a mere mortal, had to defeat him, he didn't believe he would lose. As for the rumors of him "forcing a Saint King to kneel with a single shout," he didn't believe a single word of it. Tianqin's territory, of course, they could fabricate whatever they wanted.

The onlookers also erupted in an uproar, whispering among themselves, believing Zhou Tian had gone mad. Zheng Yusheng was a renowned heavenly talent, with a record of slaying saints. Zhou Xunchuan and the others' eyes twitched. "Big Brother, you're truly incredible."

"Suit yourself, I'll do it anyway." Zhou Tian shrugged and walked towards the arena. He didn't make any vows; with so many geniuses from various factions watching, no one could go back on their word.

Zhou Tian walked and shouted, "Senior of the Fool!"

In the void, the old man's figure suddenly appeared and asked calmly, "What do you need me for?" Zhou Tian's status wasn't low enough to not be qualified to speak directly with him. Furthermore, the Fool and Tianqin had been conniving together, so he wasn't in a position to put on airs.

"A moment later, I'm afraid I won't be able to hold back and might beat him to death. You must intervene promptly." Zhou Tian spoke as he walked, calculating the distance. Approaching the arena meant the battle would start immediately. He needed a target to use his [Cultivation Replication] skill. Those other geniuses wouldn't do; he needed overwhelming power, and this old man, the Fool, was perfect.

"Haha, just let loose and fight!" The old man was also amused by Zhou Tian. In his perception, Zhou Tian had no energy fluctuations whatsoever, so he didn't know how Zhou Tian had the confidence to say such a thing.

Zheng Yusheng had already flashed into the arena. Hearing this, he couldn't help but frown. Being constantly disdained by Zhou Tian's words had made him a little angry. He had originally acted for the academy, but now he was truly enraged.

Zhou Tian smiled faintly. Just before stepping into the arena, he activated his skill. A vast surge of energy instantly filled his entire body. He was like that day again, as if he had taken a little blue pill, though it was still far from the feeling of replicating a Saint-Devil's cultivation. The old man was slightly stunned. How did he suddenly feel unable to see through Zhou Tian? However, he didn't say anything more and simply vanished.

The moment he entered the arena, Zheng Yusheng's green robe billowed, his eyes turned cold, and blazing blue light rained down. In that instant, he had used at least five or six divine abilities, all of them grand divine abilities, with unparalleled attack power.

Zhou Tian casually waved his hand, and a gentle breeze swept through, making all the blue light vanish. Then he casually tapped a few times on his body, feigning solemnity, and shouted, "Dark Dragon Nine Seals! Release!"

Then he unleashed his aura. An Emperor-level aura radiated forth, the void trembled, chaotic storms raged, and Zhou Tian's body shone like a great sun. He then said to Zheng Yusheng with a smile, "Little friend, you have ten seconds... no, nine seconds left. Cherish it."
