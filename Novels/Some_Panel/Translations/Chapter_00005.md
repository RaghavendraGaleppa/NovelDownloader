**Chapter 5: Setting Sail**

Upon leaving the Myriad Treasures Pavilion, Yang Ji did not stay within the city. Instead, he used his silver to purchase two mundane swords before exiting the city gates. To facilitate his practice of cultivation arts, he sought out an uninhabited cave on a nearby mountain. Three days, neither too long nor too short, might not be enough to advance his cultivation realm, but it was certainly sufficient to further refine his Lightness Art and Water Flowing Sword Art.

【Lightness Art (Mastery): 5/50】
【Water Flowing Sword Art (Mastery): 5/50】

"My Lightness Art has advanced from 'Stepping on Clear Wind' to 'Body Like a Swan Feather'. From now on, standing in the air won't consume too much spiritual energy." Yang Ji stood in the sky, quite pleased.

Suddenly, he drew his sword and thrust it out. Spiritual energy burst forth from the blade like a raging river, propelling the sword forward with fierce speed. A white glow erupted with a *bang!*, piercing the sky and leaving two wisps of green smoke. This was the pinnacle of speed and sharpness, called the Smooth Flowing Sword.

Next, he rotated his wrist, churning the sword body clockwise. Instantly, the sword created overlapping shadows, transforming into a vortex in water. One could only see flowing light, not the blade; only sword flowers, not the person. Within this illusion, white clouds shattered and the air became fragmented. This was the Killing Intent of Shadowed Blades.

"My longsword churns, creating lines of sword shadows that form a sword qi vortex. It serves as both defense and offense. Anyone caught within my sword vortex will be shredded by the sword qi, reduced to dust." Yang Ji's grip on the sword paused abruptly. *Clang!* The sword body vibrated non-stop, emitting a long hum, then the sword shadows gradually dispersed, returning to a straight blade.

Looking at the gleaming longsword in his hand, he remarked with a touch of regret, "If the sword in my hand were a magic artifact, its power would increase by several folds."

"Three days of arduous practice, the progress is truly immense." Yang Ji looked up; the sky was already dawning. He sheathed his sword with a backhand motion and then cast his Lightness Art, flying towards Southwind City.

*Splish-splash…* The seawater gently lapped against the shore. The seaside in the early morning was a bit chilly, the air quite humid, and the wind carried a salty tang—the smell of the sea.

***

The vast, surging ocean waves rolled endlessly. The sea stretched out to the horizon, meeting the sky, its true breadth and depth unknown, concealing countless secrets and perils. Yang Ji stood by the sea, watching. Although the sky was just beginning to brighten, the area was already bustling with activity. People came and went, and many ships had already set sail. Some were out catching spirit fish, others dredging for underwater materials, or traveling to other islands for business. Over a dozen ships were already slowly heading into the deep sea. These large vessels were mostly constructed from a mix of hard wood and fine iron, making their hulls sturdy and durable, capable of resisting the ocean's erosion. The dangers of the sea were immense. While cultivators could fly, most cultivators chose to travel by ship when venturing out, to conserve their spiritual energy for unexpected crises.

"Come on, everyone! All aboard!" Jin Dafu shouted loudly from a hundred-foot-long metal ship. In an instant, over a dozen figures on the shore leapt onto the deck. Yang Ji activated his Lightness Art and landed among them on the deck.

His gaze swept across the group, taking in the more than ten unfamiliar cultivators on board. There was an ordinary-looking middle-aged scholar, a charming woman in her forties, an old man with milky-white eyes, a youth with crimson hair, a burly man carrying a long saber, and a scar-faced man with fierce eyes… The aura emanating from these individuals was extremely powerful; they were all at least Qi Condensation Layer 5, and some were even experts at Qi Condensation Layer 10. Among them, one middle-aged man with a refined appearance and eyes full of wisdom emitted the most subtle and powerful aura—he was actually a Foundation Establishment realm cultivator. Yang Ji listened to his conversation with Jin Dafu and learned his name was Chen De, one of the renowned Foundation Establishment experts of Southwind Island.

It seemed that this wasn't the first time for these cultivators to embark on a sea journey with the ship. They went straight into the cabin upon boarding. They sat cross-legged, not uttering a single word, like a bunch of silent, meditating statues. Yang Ji had hoped to listen to their exchanges and learn some experience, but this was it? Bored, he stepped out of the cabin.

"Setting sail, setting sail!" someone on the ship shouted. Yang Ji turned his head and saw dozens of sailors raising the large sails. The massive ship quickly began to move, slowly heading into the depths of the ocean. Their destination for this trip was Ten-Thousand Waters Island, located ten thousand *li* away, to purchase spirit fruits and exchange some goods.

***

*Splish-splash…* The sea was deep blue. The large ship sped through the water, stirring up splashes and a strong smell of the ocean. Yang Ji stood on the deck, gazing into the distance. Besides him, there was only one other person on deck: Jin Dafu.

Jin Dafu lay on a large chair, drinking spirit wine, eating spirit fruits, and basking in the morning sun, looking quite content. Yang Ji glanced at him and asked, "Elder Jin, it's over ten thousand *li* to Ten-Thousand Waters Island. How long will it take to get there?"

"Our large ship has array formations enhancing its speed, making it faster than an ordinary cultivator's flight. As long as we don't encounter rough weather, at this speed, we should arrive in a day."

"We'll rest for a day at Ten-Thousand Waters Island, finish our business, and then return."

"The round trip is only three days, and you'll earn fifty spirit stones. Isn't that a great deal?" Jin Dafu chuckled, facing him.

"Many thanks for your care, Elder Jin!" Yang Ji smiled faintly and cupped his hands in gratitude, his expression showing no trace of his true thoughts. People often appeared hypocritical when playing roles, and living a long life inevitably led to becoming worldly.

Yang Ji offered his polite response, then turned his attention to the sea. It was his first time going out to sea, and he was quite curious. He sat cross-legged on the deck, silently observing the folding waves. Books had recorded that this boundless ocean was incredibly dangerous, teeming with demonic beasts and prone to frequent natural disasters. These included deep-sea whirlpools, deathly fogs, fatal hurricanes, divine lightning, torrential rains, hailstorms, underwater volcanoes, tsunamis, rip currents, rogue waves, and more. According to the books, hailstones falling from the sky could be as large as millstones, covering the land as if the sky were collapsing, terrifying beyond measure. Many Qi Condensation cultivators had perished under such natural calamities. There were also rogue waves that suddenly rose under calm conditions, towering as high as the sky, sweeping down with immense force. Qi Condensation cultivators had no chance of survival; even if they dove underwater, their bodies would be shattered.

Of course, the most terrifying of all was the divine lightning. If extreme purple lightning, covering hundreds of *li*, were to appear, even Golden Core True Persons would perish, and Nascent Soul True Monarchs would be left half-dead. Fortunately, the weather today was fine, with gentle breezes and bright sunshine, and the sea surface was relatively calm.

The large ship continued to sail steadily for half a day. At this point, only half of the journey to Ten-Thousand Waters Island remained. But just then, Yang Ji's expression changed. An information prompt suddenly appeared on the sea surface ahead of him.
