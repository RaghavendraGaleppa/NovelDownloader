# Chapter 61: Mo Jingchun

Before long, the ancient bridge became a scene of lingering intimacy. The white-robed cultivator's techniques were clearly well-practiced.

The green-clad female cultivator resembled a caged golden canary finally returning to nature's embrace, unable to restrain her melodious cries.

Wang Chan had no interest in appreciating this spring scenery. He maintained strict focus, restraining his magic power, steady as an old dog, silent as a statue.

Fortunately, his position was over a hundred zhang away from the bridge. Combined with the mid-grade concealment talisman and the cover of trees and undergrowth—and the fact that the other party was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage and thoroughly engrossed in their activities—he didn't need to worry about being discovered.

Had they been late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, or if they'd suddenly decided to circle the area within several hundred zhang while actively scanning with spiritual sense, he would have undoubtedly been exposed.

What were these lofty Foundation Establishment cultivators doing playing at romance in this godforsaken wilderness instead of enjoying the immortal paradise of Baishan City's cave mansions?

After some time entangled on the bridge, the white-robed man apparently said something wrong. The green-skirted woman suddenly shook off his embrace, straightened her clothes, and said sharply:

"Bai Qing! I, Wei Yuzhu, am not some loose woman! I don't care about your sneaky affair with that red-dressed female ghost, but if you don't give me a proper explanation about that matter, don't ever come looking for me again!"

Before the words had fully faded, the green-clad woman flicked her sleeve and transformed into a streak of azure light that shot into the distance with a hiss.

This time, the white-robed man didn't give chase. Instead, he watched her depart before licking his fingers with a roguish smile. He then flew off in a different direction, soon disappearing beyond the horizon.

Wang Chan quietly exhaled in relief but still didn't dare move.

One incense stick's time passed.

Then a quarter-hour.

Half a shichen.

Though Su Jue still hadn't appeared, seven or eight groups of cultivators had already crossed the ancient bridge. Only then did Wang Chan allow himself a slightly deeper breath.

Those two Foundation Establishment cultivators must have truly left.

His cross-legged posture relaxed, his waist slumping slightly as he prepared to take out some spirit-nourishing liquid to drink while waiting—when suddenly—

"Have mine instead."

A bottle of spirit wine landed squarely in Wang Chan's lap as he whirled around.

His scalp prickled when he saw the speaker.

Half a zhang behind him, beside a large tree, stood a woman as pristine as a lotus emerging from water, untouched by worldly dust. Noticing his gaze, she raised her own bottle and took a small sip before smiling gently. "You recognize me?"

"This junior pays respects to Senior Mo!"

Wang Chan drew a quiet breath, steadying himself before bowing deeply with utmost reverence.

When encountering a Foundation Establishment cultivator you can't defeat, don't overthink things. As long as they aren't openly hostile, show absolute deference.

He'd considered pretending ignorance, but Foundation Establishment cultivators were far too perceptive—she'd clearly noticed his subtle reaction. Honesty was the safer path.

The woman before him wore elegant emerald robes that made the surrounding flora seem dull in comparison. Her generous curves paired with that slender waist made her even more stunning than in the jade portraits.

Wang Chan found himself at a loss for words—even the phrase "slender branches bearing abundant fruit" fell short.

The young madam of the Bai family—Mo Jingchun!

But why was she here?

Could she be...?

Recalling how the green-clad woman on the bridge had addressed the white-robed man as "Bai Qing," and considering both were early Foundation Establishment cultivators, that white-robed man was undoubtedly the Bai family's young master!

The green-clad woman must have been a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Wei family. And that "red-dressed female ghost" she mentioned...

He'd thought those were just rumors.

But where there's smoke, there's fire. Bai Qing's tastes were apparently... unconventional. Especially that second-order red-dressed female ghost with awakened intelligence—was that even possible?

Shaking off these thoughts, Wang Chan focused on the present. Mo Jingchun had likely been here since half a shichen ago.

Despite witnessing her husband's infidelity on the bridge, she'd shown no reaction whatsoever—no outburst, no confrontation.

This woman's composure was terrifying.

Truly befitting a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"No need for formalities." Mo Jingchun's smile was disarmingly warm, reminiscent of a schoolteacher fond of body-hugging skirts. With a sleeve gesture, she helped Wang Chan up. "Few Qi Condensation cultivators have seen my true appearance. That you recognized me means you've seen that bathing portrait, yes?"

Despite being an early Foundation Establishment cultivator, she exuded no oppressive aura, her demeanor entirely approachable. Yet her words struck like winter's chill, freezing Wang Chan's blood.

Especially considering she'd just witnessed her husband's infidelity yet could still smile so naturally at him now.

This was genuinely frightening.

Wang Chan dared neither lie nor admit the truth.

"This junior is deeply ashamed!" He hastily bowed again.

In this situation, humble contrition was his only option.

"Let me ask you something." Mo Jingchun blew a breath that somehow prevented Wang Chan from bowing further.

She seemed to be letting the portrait matter slide, but her smile had vanished, her gaze turning icy.

"Senior need only ask. This junior will speak fully and truthfully." Wang Chan kept his head lowered, avoiding eye contact.

They said women's moods changed faster than flipping pages—especially Foundation Establishment female cultivators. Caution was paramount.

"As a man, what do you think is the most agonizing form of vengeance?" Mo Jingchun's voice grew subdued.

"Beyond destroying one's cultivation path, nothing surpasses killing one's father or stealing one's wife." Wang Chan didn't dare prevaricate, offering the honest answer after brief consideration.

"I see..." Mo Jingchun responded neutrally before suddenly asking, "What is your name, lineage, and current residence?"

"This junior is Wang Chan, a wilderness rogue cultivator currently dwelling on Lotus Mountain."

"A wilderness rogue cultivator? Still at early Qi Condensation? How... lowly."

"..."

"Pity you're neither old, ugly, nor hunchbacked. Combined with your lowly status, you'd have been perfect for revenge. But why should I lower my standards too much? Your appearance isn't unpleasant."

"..."

"Fellow Daoist Wang, I have an... unconventional request for your assistance."

"Senior need only command. Within this junior's capabilities, I would brave mountains of blades and seas of fire."

Wang Chan spoke carefully, steeling himself.

To his surprise, she fell silent.

Not daring to look up or extend spiritual sense, Wang Chan waited anxiously.

After what felt like ages, just as internal curses were forming, a voice so seductive it nearly liquefied his bones whispered like a demonic enchantment:

"Fellow Daoist Wang, be gentle... This weak woman has no strength left. Won't you come support me?"

Summoning courage, Wang Chan looked up to see the dignified Bai family matriarch Mo Jingchun leaning weakly against a tree, cheeks flushed as if feverish, her eyes brimming with allure as she glanced back at him over her shoulder.
