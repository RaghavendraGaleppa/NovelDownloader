# Chapter 93: Is This What You Call a Terrifying Killing Machine? (1/2)

Zuoqiu Yang stared blankly at the three Huaishan Tyrants lying on the ground, their bones broken and tendons severed.

He had schemed and prepared for a long time to deal with these three.

First, he had deliberately exposed his whereabouts to lure them into pursuing him.

Just moments ago, he had turned the tables, using their strategy of attrition against them to slaughter all the ambushers. The killing intent of his Unborn Blade Art had accumulated to its peak, leaving him with no way out.

Today, he was terrifyingly powerful.

He had braced himself with full concentration, ready to fight to the death to avenge his master and the villagers.

Yet, in a moment of shock, these three were nearly beaten to death right before his eyes. The young man who struck them looked even younger than him.

It was... utterly deflating.

"Who are you people?"

"Why did you suddenly attack me, and why are you laughing so unpleasantly?"

Li Mo crouched in front of the continuously vomiting Huaishan Tyrants and asked.

He was representing the Clear Abyss Sect to descend the mountain and maintain order in Ziyang Prefecture City. He had beaten these people into such a state, so he needed to ask for the reason.

"I... you..."

The scar-faced man lying on the ground glared with vicious intent.

Suddenly, an unexpected change occurred.

The two other bandits, one fat and one thin, quickly placed their hands on the scar-faced man's shoulders.

They were gathering their last remaining Qi, pooling it all together.

"Hah!"

The scar-faced man shattered the floor tiles and suddenly sprang up. Three surging streams of Qi were twisted together through his meridians into a single, incredibly violent and fierce cord.

"Brat, you're still too naive!"

A victorious smile twisted his face, filled with malice.

This move didn't have much physical force.

But the combined Qi of the three men was enough to shatter an opponent's Dantian.

Zuoqiu Yang finally snapped out of his daze, while Xiao Qin's expression drastically changed. He wanted to rescue Li Mo, but it was already too late. He could only watch helplessly as the man's palm came crashing down.

It struck Li Mo's Dantian with immense force, and the Qi flooded in frantically, as if trying to废掉 the少年's martial arts.

*BOOM—*

The sound was loud.

But after the sound echoed, the air in the post station fell into a dead silence.

The young man hadn't moved a single step, merely frowning slightly.

The Huaishan Tyrants' ferocious smiles froze, and fear appeared in their eyes.

What the...

Is this guy human or a ghost?

The Huaishan Tyrants did not die peacefully.

The foreign Qi entered Li Mo's body, but he felt nothing.

He just felt the Qi was very impure, crudely twisted together. Without a second thought, he used his own Qi to expel it.

It returned along the same path.

If it had just ended there, it would have been fine.

But as their liquefied Qi was being expelled, it strangely 'ignited'.

*Pfft—*

The Three Fools... oh, no, the Three Tyrants, suddenly swelled grotesquely.

Their eyes bulged instantly, and blood flowed from their seven orifices.

They died with their eyes wide open.

His Dantian was so vast that even he found it terrifying, and his Qi was cultivated from a martial art superior to Divine Skills.

He could even ignite Qi, carrying a destructive ferocity that could burn all things to ashes.

This was the first time he had used it against an enemy.

Even Li Mo himself felt it was quite impressive.

Let alone the others.

Xiao Qin opened his mouth, unable to speak for a long time. After stopping his movement, he stood there for a long while.

Even the Thousand-Form Martial Lord was speechless with shock.

"Li Shidi, are you alright?"

When he came to his senses, he quickly stepped forward to check on him.

Although Li Shidi looked fine on the surface, that was the Qi of three masters at the Jade-Ice Qi Condensation Realm just now. Even without the amplification of a martial art, a sudden rush of it into a person's body would be unbearable.

Li Mo shook his head and asked:

"They are... the ones chosen by the Drizzle Tower to participate in the Infernal Trial?"

"Ah, they were here to hunt someone down."

Xiao Qin said, looking towards a distance.

Following his gaze, Li Mo looked to the side, at the figure wearing a straw raincoat.

---

[System notification: Congratulations, Host, you have successfully helped 'Zuoqiu Yang' kill his enemies.]

[You have a reward to collect.]

Zuoqiu Yang?

A complex light flickered in Li Mo's eyes.

[Name: Zuoqiu Yang]

[Age: 19]

[Root Bones: Nine Forms Complete.]

[Realm: Qi Condensation.]

[Fate: Purple with a touch of Gray.]

[Evaluation: Born with nine types of martial root bones, his talent is exceptional. He was taken in as a disciple by a Earthly Killer who defected from the Drizzle Tower. He is also the sole survivor of Huaishan County and will become a terrifying killing machine in the future.]

[Recent Events: The accomplices are dead, but the true culprit is hard to find. He is in the Infernal Trial, hoping to find clues.]

"Purple with a touch of Gray..."

This meant he would achieve something in the future, but at a great cost.

A terrifying killing machine?

Sounds pretty impressive...

"You... are you also participating in the Infernal Trial?"

Zuoqiu Yang placed his hand on his boiling-with-killing-intent short blade and suddenly asked.

"Why do you ask?"

"If you are, then I will withdraw right now."

"..."

For the first time, Li Mo saw someone looking so fierce but saying something so cowardly.

What happened to the terrifying killing machine?

"Is the Infernal Trial something you can just withdraw from?"

"Naturally not, but I'd rather not compete with you."

Only the few who survive to the end can be admitted into the Drizzle Tower.

Therefore, whether willingly or unwillingly, all participants are hunters in a dark forest... or prey.

If Li Mo was a participant...

Then without a doubt, he would be the winner of this trial.

"I'm not interested in the Drizzle Tower."

"On the contrary."

Li Mo took out a waist token from his palm and smiled. "I am a disciple of the Clear Abyss Sect."

"I am too."

Xiao Qin also took out his waist token, showing he was a partner of justice.

At this moment.

"Hm? What's going on here?"

Shang Wu stepped over the threshold of the post station, her gaze not even flickering at the scene of carnage on the ground. She just slightly frowned, scrutinizing the only stranger here.

*Gulp—*

Zuoqiu Yang swallowed hard, feeling like he was facing a great enemy.

His blade was trembling again, but this time it wasn't because of boiling killing intent.

It was because of fear.

When he practiced the Unborn Blade Art with his deceased master, he discovered he was naturally sensitive to things like killing intent and malice.

Before, the person with the most terrifying killing intent he had ever seen was his master.

Now, someone else had taken that spot.

The atmosphere in the post station became somewhat strange for a moment.

A small杀手 who hadn't even become a formal member of the Drizzle Tower.

And four righteous partners from the Clear Abyss Sect.

To be fair, he couldn't beat any of them. Even Xiao Qin was a Thousand-Form Martial Lord, not an old man who could only talk but not fight.

"Don't be so tense."

"We descended the mountain mainly to maintain order in the prefecture city and prevent people from taking advantage of the chaos to harm the innocent."

"As for the Infernal Trial, our only hope for it is that it ends as soon as possible."

Li Mo gestured for him to relax.

"I understand."

Zuoqiu Yang's body relaxed.

He was truly a straightforward person. He picked up the bowl of noodles he hadn't finished and squatted on the ground to slurp them down.

Li Mo, on the other hand, walked over to the Huaishan Tyrants' bodies and used his Chixiao Sword to cut open their pockets.

After a search, among the miscellaneous items, a letter in the scar-faced man's chest caught Li Mo's attention.
