Chapter 19: Karma!

Zhou Yi took the reagent into his hand. Runes coiled around the vial. After a moment, he said, "There's indeed no Spirit Qi reaction, but are you certain about the safety of this reagent?"

Emperor Qin leaned back in his chair and replied, "They say the probability of failure is less than one percent."

Zhou Yi frowned slightly. "One percent? That's still quite high. What about its effect?"

"This technology is something they've only recently begun to explore; it's not very mature. This single vial of reagent can only enhance a person's physical body by about ten times."

"That's too low, isn't it?"

"There's nothing to be done about it. After all, this method doesn't rely on Spirit Qi. They didn't really prioritize this technology before; if I hadn't brought it up, the department researching this method would have already been disbanded." As if remembering something, Emperor Qin gave a wry smile. "This one vial of reagent consumed half an Imperial Medicine just to refine!"

"Half an Imperial Medicine!" Zhou Yi's eyes widened. "How is that possible?! The energy contained in half an Imperial Medicine is enough to allow a mortal to form a Fa Xiang. How could it only..."

"Exactly. That's why they wanted to disband this department. High cost, low effect—what's the point of keeping them?" Emperor Qin shook his head with a sigh, then added, "Let Tian'er consume it here. If anything goes wrong, I can intervene."

Zhou Yi looked at the reagent in his hand, then at Zhou Tian, and said, "Alright."

Zhou Tian, who had been listening attentively to their conversation, finally saw an opportunity to interject and quickly asked, "What is this?" He had been listening for a while and could roughly guess that it was prepared for him. He wanted to know why he had to drink this thing, especially since it carried a risk of failure.

Genetic serum. When he heard that name, his mind conjured images of genetic recombination, genetic mutation, and the Hulk. As for "less than one percent" probability, that was all nonsense. If it happened to you, the probability was one hundred percent! What if it failed?

"This thing can enhance your strength. Drink it!" Zhou Yi walked up to Zhou Tian and handed him the reagent.

"I won't drink it!" Zhou Tian raised his hand, refusing to take it. "No, no, I won't take it!"

"Drink it quickly, it's for your own good!" Zhou Yi frowned slightly, energy surging around him, clearly intending to use force.

"Why make me drink it? It can at most enhance my physical body by ten times. That's not even as good as the Mortal Transformation Realm. What use is that kind of strength?!" Zhou Tian had heard clearly just now. A tenfold physical enhancement might have been useful in his previous life, but here, it was useless.

"This is just the first vial; there will be many more later!" Zhou Yi patiently explained.

"What do I need strength for? Don't I have you?" Zhou Tian said, trying to flatter Zhou Yi and muddle through.

Zhou Yi's face darkened. "After the Youth Competition, there will be a trial. This is a rule passed down by my Zhou family for generations, and you are no exception. Without strength, you'll only be sending yourself to your death!"

"I won't drink it. What if it fails?" Zhou Tian was speechless. What the hell was this "trial" business? So melodramatic! But he still didn't want to drink it. He had his cheat; what did he need this for? He had no idea what might happen if he drank it!

"Your Imperial Brother is here watching you. If anything happens, he can save you!" Zhou Yi was losing his patience.

"I won't drink it!" Zhou Tian said, his face stiff. He wasn't afraid of death; death was fine, he had his cheat anyway, and dying could even accumulate death counts—he was actually worried about *not* dying. He was afraid of genetic mutation. What if he turned into a monster? Where would he go to reason then? Revival didn't come with genetic correction.

Emperor Qin and the others didn't understand genetics, perhaps because their cultivation paths were different, but Zhou Tian knew that this thing fundamentally altered a life form's state. The most troublesome part was that if a genetic mutation occurred and he turned into a big green brute, his Undying System wouldn't care. He wouldn't be dead, so it wouldn't be the system's business.

"Drink it!" Zhou Yi completely lost his patience. Runes surged, and scarlet runes wrapped around Zhou Tian, immobilizing him. The reagent floated into the air, tilted slightly, and began pouring into his mouth!

"Don't force me!" Zhou Tian was completely restrained; only his mouth could move as he shouted.

"You little rascal, this is for your own good!" Zhou Yi's face was dark. Why weren't his first two sons so much trouble? Why was this son so much trouble?!

Emperor Qin sat in his chair, holding a cup of tea that glowed with golden light, and shook his head. He then saw Tian Ling standing nearby, waved his hand, and a chair materialized behind her, signaling her to sit. Tian Ling, slightly reserved, sat down.

As the reagent was about to pour into his mouth, Zhou Tian gritted his teeth and activated [Teleportation]. With a blur, Zhou Tian broke free from Zhou Yi's control and appeared behind Tian Ling. He stretched his limbs, took a breath, and said to Zhou Yi, "I already told you I don't want to drink it."

Zhou Yi frowned. His figure flickered, and half his body entered the void. With a "bang," golden runes appeared out of thin air, forcing him out of the void. The spatial lockdown of the Imperial Palace was even stronger than that of the Qin King's Manor!

In Emperor Qin's eyes, profound runes flashed and disappeared. He, too, frowned. Was that... the trajectory of time?

Being forced out of the void, Zhou Yi was stunned for a moment, but he quickly reacted. This was the Imperial Palace; its spatial seal was something even he couldn't break. So how did Zhou Tian travel through space?

Zhou Yi's figure blurred again; this time, it was pure speed. Zhou Tian's figure also vanished instantly, reappearing at the door.

"You little rascal, what is going on?!" Zhou Yi pursued relentlessly, his figure almost invisible, moving at extreme speed.

"Spiritual control over the physical body! If I can do it, so can you!" Zhou Tian didn't dare to stop. At first, it was because Zhou Yi had a casting wind-up, giving him reaction time, but now he couldn't react at all. If he stopped for even a moment, he would be caught!

Zhou Yi gnashed his teeth, his face dark. Spiritual control over the physical body? What the hell!

Watching Zhou Tian's continuously flickering figure, Emperor Qin's frown deepened. Now he could be certain that Zhou Tian was using a method related to time, but how was that possible?! His lips moved slightly, and a command was issued from the void.

In the deepest part of the Imperial Palace, five elderly men emerged. All had white beards and brows, and their skin was like withered wood. Taking a single step, they reappeared outside Yangxin Hall. They possessed Emperor Qin's decree, allowing them to ignore the spatial seal. The five elders exchanged glances, positioning themselves at five corners. Their entire bodies surged with energy, runes erupted, shining like great suns. A mysterious aura gradually resonated throughout the area. Countless silver runes linked together to form runic chains, and these runic chains further connected to form an incredibly complex grand array, enveloping the entire Yangxin Hall.

Inside Yangxin Hall, after teleporting once more, Zhou Tian stopped. Disregarding Zhou Yi, who had grabbed his collar, he looked at Emperor Qin, who was seated in his chair. The feedback from his [Teleportation] just now wasn't from using time-related methods, but rather from causality. And in the Imperial Palace, the only one capable of sealing time was Emperor Qin, who was right in front of him.

Emperor Qin's brows were almost knitted together. What kind of method was that just now? He couldn't understand it!
