# Chapter 83: Completing the Spiritual Roots  

Zhang Yan: "..."  

He never expected that Lei Kunhai would actually bring over an entire forging furnace just to make him learn artifact crafting.  

Artifact crafting generally requires high temperatures. The best method is to use earth fire, as its temperature is sufficient and relatively stable. However, if that's not an option, spirit charcoal can also be used. The flames from spirit charcoal are hot enough to meet the demands of forging magical artifacts, but it also comes with a hefty cost.  

If Zhang Yan had to buy it himself, he’d definitely hesitate. But now, with Lei Kunhai footing the bill, he was more than happy to take advantage of it!  

This time, besides the spirit charcoal, Lei Kunhai also brought Zhang Yan some blueprints for magical artifacts. These were all basic forging-level artifacts—nothing too difficult, usually given as benefits to disciples.  

Moreover, Lei Kunhai made it clear: any artifacts Zhang Yan forged would be bought back by him. The materials would be covered by Lei Kunhai, and the profits would go to Zhang Yan.  

Such an offer was impossible to refuse. In fact, Zhang Yan wished there were more opportunities like this.  

Lei Kunhai—Senior Lei—was truly a good man. A great man!  

After their discussion, Lei Kunhai left.  

The Qingheng Sect’s base was under strict confidentiality. Only true disciples and Golden Core elders were privy to its location. Even among the Golden Core elders, most only knew because they had likely been true disciples themselves in the past.  

As for disciples like Zhang Yan, they had been escorted here. Finding their way back alone would be nearly impossible.  

---  

After Lei Kunhai left, Zhang Yan resumed his cultivation. He opened the storage pouch Lei Kunhai had given him. Inside, besides the spirit charcoal and forging furnace, there were also some forging materials—all provided by Lei Kunhai.  

What caught his attention the most, however, were two wooden boxes in the pouch.  

Opening them, he found one filled with a golden glow and the other containing what looked like a flickering flame on the verge of extinguishing.  

One was a metal-attribute spiritual material, and the other was a fire-attribute spiritual material.  

"As expected, the efficiency of a sect far surpasses that of an individual working alone," Zhang Yan sighed.  

Previously, despite his hard work over a long period, he had only managed to obtain a wood-attribute spiritual material. Now, just by spreading the word, he had acquired both metal and fire-attribute materials. The difference was staggering.  

But he also understood that this convenience wasn’t solely due to the sect’s resources.  

---  

It was also because he was a true disciple.  

The sect was willing to invest manpower and resources to find these things for him.  

If he were just an ordinary disciple, the sect would, at most, take a glance through its own treasury. Even if they had what he needed, he’d have to pay a steep price to obtain it.  

Unlike now, where the materials were delivered to him as soon as he asked—without even charging him spirit stones.  

It was almost too good to be true.  

Of course, even as a true disciple, he couldn’t endlessly drain the sect’s resources.  

In reality, each true disciple had a fixed annual quota for cultivation resources. Anything beyond that had to be paid for out of pocket.  

This wasn’t limited to true disciples—even Golden Core elders and the sect leader had fixed stipends.  

At the end of each year, if the sect had surplus resources, they would be used to improve sect facilities. If the surplus persisted over time, benefits would be increased.  

However, such increases usually favored the upper echelons, with lower-level cultivators getting only scraps.  

It somewhat resembled the structure of a company from his past life, but with key differences.  

In the world of cultivation, a single high-level cultivator could accomplish far more than ten thousand low-level ones combined.  

For example, a Qi Refining cultivator toiling away in spirit fields for a hundred years might not match the value of a single beast slain by a Golden Core elder.  

Of course, that was a bit of an exaggeration, but the principle held.  

---  

"First, I’ll enhance my metal-attribute spiritual roots."  

Zhang Yan took a deep breath as he looked at the metal-attribute spiritual material in his hand and began casting the Spirit Nurturing Art.  

His Spirit Nurturing Art had already reached perfection.  

But as he cast it this time, he suddenly recalled the numerous inscriptions on the Thunderflame Token.  

On a whim, he equipped the Spirit Root Nurturing Art to his equipment slot and activated the inscriptions, overlapping them with the Spirit Nurturing Art.  

To his surprise, his perfected Spirit Nurturing Art and the lesser Spirit Root Nurturing Art actually synergized.  

For a moment, he felt as though his understanding of the perfected Spirit Nurturing Art had deepened.  

"Does this mean... perfection isn’t truly the limit?" Zhang Yan’s eyes widened in disbelief.  

But he quickly shook his head.  

Perfection was indeed perfection—but it didn’t necessarily mean the absolute limit.  

The reason was simple.  

If both he and a genius scored 100 on a test, he might have struggled to reach that score, while the genius hit it effortlessly because the test didn’t go beyond 100.  

In Zhang Yan’s speculation, "perfection" might just represent a benchmark. Surpassing it could allow one to develop a divine ability upon reaching Foundation Establishment.  

But that didn’t mean the technique itself had reached its ultimate potential.  

"I wonder what effects reaching an even higher realm would bring." Zhang Yan frowned but didn’t attempt it now.  

To test it, he’d need a large number of inscriptions working in tandem.  

"The Thunderflame Body Tempering Art might work." Zhang Yan thought of the densely packed inscriptions on the Thunderflame Token.  

Perhaps once his Thunderflame Body Tempering Art reached perfection, he could try enhancing it.  

With the Spirit Root Nurturing Art activated, Zhang Yan immediately began absorbing the metal-attribute spiritual material.  

In less than half an hour, he opened his eyes.  

"My metal-attribute spiritual roots... should now be at the mid-grade level." A look of joy appeared on Zhang Yan’s face.  

Mid-grade spiritual roots—that was excellent!  

"And now, the fire-attribute spiritual roots."  

Zhang Yan stared at the flickering flame in his hand, a hint of nervousness creeping in.  

He had always wanted to test whether he could complete his spiritual roots, but he hadn’t found the right materials until now.  

Now that he had them, he felt a twinge of hesitation.  

"Whatever. I’ll have to try sooner or later. Worrying won’t help my path."  

Zhang Yan chuckled and immediately sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion, beginning to absorb the fire-attribute spiritual material.  

As he applied the Spirit Nurturing Art, the spiritual essence within the flame slowly seeped into his body.  

"Hot!"  

That was his first sensation.  

It was unbearably hot—as if his entire body were on fire.  

"What’s going on?"  

Zhang Yan was startled and nearly interrupted his cultivation. But when he closed his eyes to inspect, he realized he could already convert spiritual energy into fire-attribute energy.  

"It works, but it’s painful!"  

His mind raced as he grasped the situation. Without hesitation, he continued using the Spirit Nurturing Art.  

The absorption process was agonizing, but it didn’t seem to harm his body.  

So he pressed on, enduring the pain with sheer willpower.  

Three hours later, he finally opened his eyes and wiped the sweat from his brow.  

That had been excruciating!  

But the results were undeniable.  

He had succeeded.  

Using the Spirit Nurturing Art, he had successfully supplemented his fire spiritual roots.  

To his surprise, he had assumed that spiritual materials could only produce low-grade spiritual roots at best.  

Yet the result was a spiritual root close to mid-grade, with an affinity for spiritual energy comparable to his existing wood spiritual roots.  

"Was it because of the overlapping perfected Spirit Nurturing Art?" Zhang Yan mused.  

Admittedly, this was a remarkable phenomenon.  

Though he didn’t know the exact reason, it was undoubtedly a boon for him.  

"Now that I’ve supplemented my fire spiritual roots, I still need earth-attribute spiritual materials.  

"Besides, I also need to learn the Metal, Fire, and Earth Elemental Arts as soon as possible."  

These were all crucial for him.  

The Five Elements were the foundation of everything.  

If he mastered all five Elemental Arts before reaching Foundation Establishment, his foundation would be formidable!  

The hardest part would be obtaining earth-attribute spiritual materials—those depended entirely on luck.  

As for the Earth, Fire, and Metal Elemental Arts, Zhang Yan wasn’t worried.  

These were basic spells, practiced by many cultivators—though usually just for practice, rarely mastered to perfection.  

Among them, the Wood and Water Elemental Arts had some practical use.  

But the Metal, Earth, and Fire Elemental Arts were practically useless to most cultivators!  

After all, the Wood and Water Elemental Arts were somewhat useful for spirit plant cultivators.  

The Metal Elemental Art was mainly for artifact forgers.  

The Fire Elemental Art was useful for alchemists and forgers.  

But...  

Alchemists and forgers were rare and difficult to train.  

Thus, aside from the Wood and Water Elemental Arts, few bothered to master the others to perfection.  

---  

But that didn’t matter.  

If one person’s comprehension inscriptions weren’t enough, he’d gather more.  

Two people’s weren’t enough? Then a hundred!  

With enough inscriptions, he’d eventually push them all to perfection!  

---  

After absorbing the spiritual materials, Zhang Yan immediately returned to his rigorous cultivation.  

After all, what mattered most now was improving his cultivation base.  

He was still far too weak!  

While he was immersed in cultivation, the entire Zhou Kingdom was undergoing upheaval.  

The reason? The first layer of the Taiyi Sect’s secret realm had been breached.  

Many had reaped benefits from it, sparking even greater interest in the second layer.  

Unfortunately, the restrictions on the second layer were far stronger—and far more dangerous.  

Thus, the major sects began urging rogue cultivators to charge ahead.  

They promised spirit artifacts, treasures, spirit stones, and cultivation techniques to whoever broke through the second layer’s restrictions—along with the chance to join any sect of their choice.  

The rogue cultivators threw themselves into the task with reckless abandon.  

It was a pitiful sight.  

What sect disciples like Zhang Yan could obtain effortlessly was a priceless treasure to these rogue cultivators.  

After three months of relentless assault, the second layer’s restrictions were finally broken.  

The cost? A mere hundred rogue cultivator corpses—many of them low-level cultivators who had hoped to scavenge some gains but ended up losing their lives instead.  

With the second layer opened, everyone discovered its contents.  

As the major sects had predicted, it was a place where the Taiyi Sect had imparted teachings to its disciples.  

The structure was a pagoda-like building.  

By entering and defeating the creatures on each floor, one could obtain spells and techniques tailored to their spiritual roots and comprehension—though only up to the Foundation Establishment level.  

Golden Core cultivators were excluded.  

Moreover, the pagoda appeared quite worn, its functionality uncertain.  

Thus, the major sects set a quota:  

Each major sect received seven slots.  

Golden Core families in Zhou Kingdom received two slots.  

Foundation Establishment families received one.  

Exceptions existed—for example, the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace had ten slots.  

Though unfair, no one dared object.  

After all... they had a Nascent Soul cultivator!  

Had this happened three hundred years earlier, when their Nascent Soul was in his prime, the other sects wouldn’t even have been invited.  

Additionally, the sects made another arrangement:  

Aside from the major sects, all other families—whether Golden Core or Foundation Establishment—were required to provide copies of any spells or techniques they obtained inside.  

In essence...  

While the Zhou Kingdom’s major sects granted these families slots, they were really using them to scour the pagoda’s knowledge.  

Everyone knew this, but none dared protest.  

After all, free spells were still free spells.  

As for handing over copies to the sects? So be it.  

If they refused, the sects could easily crush them.  

Such was the way of the cultivation world.  

Might made right.  

The Qingheng Sect’s seven slots naturally went to its seven true disciples—no questions asked.  

But then, an unexpected twist occurred.  

The third senior brother declined his slot.  

"No, no. My talent is mediocre, and my comprehension is lacking. Using this slot would be a waste. Sect Master, please choose someone else."  

The white-haired third senior brother’s refusal to the youthful-looking Mo Changqing was almost comical.  

While Zhang Yan was surprised, he wasn’t shocked.  

The third senior brother had always been an odd one.  

As mentioned before, his talent was poor, and his comprehension wasn’t great.  

By all logic, he should never have become a true disciple of the Qingheng Sect.  

But somehow...  

He seemed blessed by fortune.  

Every time his lifespan neared its end, his cultivation speed would inexplicably accelerate.  

And with each breakthrough, his speed would increase slightly compared to before.  

That was why he had been made a true disciple.  

Though his progress was slow, it was steady...  

"Does he have a system too?" Zhang Yan couldn’t help but joke inwardly.  

It was downright bizarre!  

"Very well. If you refuse, I’ll select someone else."  

Mo Changqing didn’t press the matter and agreed immediately.  

"The rest of you, prepare yourselves. We’ll head to the secret realm soon. Make sure to perform well—don’t disappoint me!"  

P.S.: There should be another 4,000-word chapter tonight, though it might go past midnight.
