# Chapter 126: Three-Eyed Silver Dragon, Stone Liquid Transformation!

"Roar!"

The narrow cave dwelling echoed with the furious roar of a dragon.

A ten-zhang-long silver dragon with distinct scales, silver whiskers, and horns circled endlessly around a seated Daoist. Though the cross-legged figure stood only a few feet tall—utterly dwarfed by the massive dragon—the silver beast coiled obediently, accentuating the man's imposing presence.

"Whoosh!"

At that moment, the Daoist opened his mouth and swallowed a stream of shimmering silver liquid. While his body showed no reaction, the silver dragon hovering in the cave suddenly trembled. Its previously dull eyes snapped open, flashing with silver light.

Moreover, a vertical silver pattern lit up between the scales on the dragon's forehead, resembling a third eye that gleamed brilliantly.

"Boom!"

As if breaking through some barrier, the entire world suddenly became clearer in the dragon's vision—all veils lifted, revealing everything with crystal clarity.

"Three-Eyed Silver Dragon... has a nice ring to it," murmured the Daoist. Instantly, the massive silver dragon shrank like lightning back into the man's sea of consciousness, vanishing as if it had never appeared.

The Daoist was none other than Gu Yuan.

Half a month had passed, and the Three-Eyes Spirit Water had fully condensed. Having successfully refined it, his divine sense now possessed the power to see through illusions. From this point on, his Silver Dragon Divine Sense could rightfully be called the Three-Eyed Silver Dragon.

Yet this was only the beginning.

After reaching Foundation Establishment, divine sense gained more "divine" properties and was no longer static. As long as they didn't conflict, spirit waters, seals, and techniques could continuously enhance one's divine sense. In another month, when the Kui Thunder Spirit Water condensed, Gu Yuan could refine it, potentially transforming his divine sense into a Three-Eyed Thunder Dragon.

In terms of divine sense, Gu Yuan now had some confidence. But to conquer the Scarlet Moon Great River, he needed even more.

"I hope my first post-Foundation Establishment opportunity search doesn't disappoint..." Gu Yuan sighed, then took out the stone vial and dripped the newly condensed liquid into his eyes.

"Boom!"

A resonant bell-like sound echoed in his mind. This time, it felt as though the liquid hadn't merely entered his eyes but his very soul. His consciousness soared, and the world before him transformed.

The entire landscape simplified into gray, hazy lines, dotted with countless glowing points of light in various colors.

"This is..."

Though everything seemed unchanged, Gu Yuan keenly sensed the difference. This time, when using the stone liquid, his intent had been to "seek techniques." 

Since he hadn't obtained the top-tier methods for the Golden Rainbow and Cangming Dao Foundations in the Transmission Hall—only two superior-grade seals—he urgently needed better sword seal techniques. Otherwise, he'd have to settle for crafting the "Thousand Rainbow Glazed Sword Seal."

Since he sought techniques, all the glowing points should relate to "methods." Yet this time, they felt different. 

Touching the nearest white light with his mind, a strange stream of information flowed into him. Though he couldn't discern the exact nature of the opportunity, he vaguely sensed it was related to spiritual artifacts.

His thoughts shifted, touching another white light.

"...cultivation."

"...romantic ties."

"...techniques."

"...origins."

The influx of information overwhelmed him momentarily.

"Can I now examine all opportunities related to me?" Gu Yuan's heart pounded. He never expected the stone liquid to undergo such a transformation after his breakthrough to Foundation Establishment! 

No longer would he need to painstakingly weigh his options—now, with a single glance, all opportunities would be laid bare before him.

Suppressing his excitement, he scanned the gray expanse, hoping to spot at least a cyan-tier opportunity. 

The range of his perception had expanded significantly post-breakthrough, yet the vast world before him remained dominated by white lights—minor opportunities of little benefit.

After a long search, he found nothing above cyan. But then, a light drifted from a distant spiritual peak, settling over a grand hall before erupting into a radiant silver-green glow. 

The light was faint and distant, suggesting an associated opportunity—one requiring effort to fully obtain. But any opportunity was better than none. Focusing his mind, he examined it.

"...technique, origins."

Strange information flowed from the light into his consciousness. Simultaneously, he recognized the two peaks from which the light had emerged: 

Jade Pot Peak and the Hall of Affinity!

A light from Jade Pot Peak had landed on the Hall of Affinity, forming this opportunity. And Jade Pot Peak was none other than the abode of Sword Fox Sage!

Gu Yuan's heart raced. Without hesitation, he withdrew his vision, activated his Golden Rainbow Dao Foundation, and transformed into a streak of golden light, speeding toward the Hall of Affinity.

**Hall of Affinity**

Dusk had fallen, and most tasks for the day had been completed. Disciples were preparing to retire when a golden light streaked into the hall.

"A Golden Core decree!" 

The disciples dropped to their knees in reverence. "We greet the Sage's edict!"

A Foundation Establishment elder hurried forth to receive the token. As the golden light faded, a line of text appeared:

"The Frost Soul Ice Lotus blooms soon. Dispatch a Foundation Establishment disciple to retrieve its stamen and deliver it to Jade Pot Peak. Rewards will not be lacking."

The elder sighed nostalgically. "The Frost Soul Ice Lotus blooms again... Decades have passed. Alas, Senior Sister Linglong is no longer here..."

The Frost Soul Ice Lotus was a rare treasure from the "Frost Moon Secret Realm," blooming once every sixty years. Its stamen was not only delectable but also purified the mind and strengthened Dao heart. However, the ancient pocket realm was fragile—Golden Core cultivators would cause its immediate collapse upon entry, while Qi Refinement cultivators would perish instantly from its soul-freezing blizzards. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators suffered excruciating torment from the icy winds that scourged divine sense and soul.

In the past, Jade Pot Peak's Senior Sister Linglong had personally gathered the stamen as a filial offering. But decades ago, she vanished during travels, only for her death to be confirmed years later.

"Post this on the mission board immediately! Summon all Foundation Establishment disciples to retrieve the stamen for the Sage!" the elder commanded sternly. 

Sage's orders were absolute. Were it not for the hall's rules prohibiting personal mission acceptance, he would have taken it himself—even without rewards, serving a Sage was honor enough.

"Elder, wait! Don't post it—I'll take this mission!" 

A golden streak of light flashed into the hall as Gu Yuan arrived just in time.
