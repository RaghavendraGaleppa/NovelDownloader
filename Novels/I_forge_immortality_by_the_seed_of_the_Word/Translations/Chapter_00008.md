# Chapter 8: First-Class Evaluation

A single breath, or perhaps two.

Only a brief moment had passed in the outside world, yet to Zhang Jing's consciousness, it felt as if several months had gone by.

During this prolonged period, the only thing Zhang Jing could do was continuously practice the Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Technique.

Attempt after attempt.

Insight upon insight.

His understanding of the Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Technique—or rather, his comprehension of visualization techniques in general—gradually deepened.

The heavens and earth contain spiritual energy, nurturing the luminous essence of all things. Yet the mortal body is like rotten wood, incapable of sensing the presence of spiritual energy, let alone absorbing it for nourishment.

Fortunately, the Dao follows no constant path, and destiny is never fixed.

Despite their fragile forms, humans are born with innate spiritual divinity.

This spiritual divinity is weak at first, and only through visualization techniques—borrowing strength from the myriad spirits of heaven and earth—can one sense spiritual energy and eventually develop boundless supernatural abilities.

"So the path of immortal cultivation in this world is essentially about drawing nourishment from the 'myriad spirits of heaven and earth' to strengthen one's own spiritual divinity and achieve longevity," Zhang Jing murmured thoughtfully as he suddenly opened his eyes.

He recalled a passage from the *Dao De Jing* in his previous life: *"Man follows the earth, earth follows heaven, heaven follows the Dao, and the Dao follows nature."* 

The literal meaning bore an uncanny resemblance to the immortal path of this world.

Could it be that the *Dao De Jing* held another layer of interpretation?

At this thought, Zhang Jing suddenly realized another question: If humans cultivated using this method, would the so-called "myriad spirits of heaven and earth" simply allow it? Would they retaliate?

But then again, if the immortal path of humanity had been passed down through generations and remained unbroken to this day, it meant that the great powers standing at its pinnacle must possess overwhelming strength.

At the very least, they were powerful enough to prevent those "myriad spirits" from daring to make trouble.

In that case, cultivating immortality truly seemed like a promising path!

Snapping out of his thoughts, Zhang Jing winced slightly at the faint throbbing in his brow.

From a practical standpoint, the Heart's Eye Dao Seed was indeed an incredible cultivation accelerator.

But its endurance issue was truly frustrating.

After some consideration, Zhang Jing realized that only by mastering the visualization technique and strengthening his own spiritual divinity could he hope to change this situation.

He glanced at the jade talisman.

**[Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Technique · Uninitiated (4/50)]**

"Practicing the visualization technique in the Heart's Eye state does drastically speed up progress. If I keep cultivating this way, I should be able to master it in about nine more days."

"That's far ahead of the thirty-day requirement for the academy's assessment!"

"With results like this, I should easily qualify as outstanding, right?"

---

"Speaking of which, when the Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Technique reaches level one, it should unlock a skill trait!"

Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed with anticipation, feeling as though the path ahead was bright.

He hadn't forgotten that the [Three Classics and Six Scriptures] skill had only required 10 points of experience to master—far fewer than the 50 needed for the [Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Technique].

"I wonder what kind of powerful Dao Seed will emerge when the [Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Technique] reaches level ten..."

As his mind relaxed, overwhelming drowsiness washed over him.

Lying in bed, Zhang Jing could barely keep his eyes open, mumbling, "I think I forgot something..."

The night passed without dreams.

The next day.

Lecture Hall.

At the podium, Instructor Wang's rugged features clashed somewhat with the pristine white robes he wore today.

Fortunately, the profound insights he shared about visualization cultivation were captivating enough that the audience overlooked his attire.

Before long, Instructor Wang spoke up, "If you have any questions about your cultivation, you may ask them now."

The moment he finished, Zhang Jing saw Chu Lingyun, seated at the very front, stand up and ask softly, "Instructor, since the Pure Essence Light is formless and shapeless, how can we confirm whether our visualization is correct? And if it's wrong, how should we correct it?"

"Excellent question. It seems you're not far from mastering the visualization technique," Instructor Wang replied, his gaze carrying a hint of approval.

He then explained, "The Pure Essence Light has no fixed form but emphasizes intent—what we call 'a thousand faces, one person.' As long as you grasp the pure, upright, and profound essence of the Pure Essence Light, you need not worry."

As if recalling something, Instructor Wang's expression turned serious as he addressed the group, "The Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Technique is one of the most fundamental methods. It is gentle, balanced, and profound. If you obsess over its form or appearance, you'll only hinder your progress."

"Understood, Instructor!" the students chorused.

"Any other questions?"

"Instructor, may I ask—" Another student, Deng Yuan, a scion of a cultivation family seated at the front, stood up and posed his question.

Zhang Jing watched as the four elite disciples—Ji Bochang and the others—took turns raising their questions, each receiving clear and insightful answers from Instructor Wang.

With every response, Zhang Jing noticed the same look of sudden enlightenment dawning on their faces.

Clearly, they had gained much.

---

A few others also brought up difficulties they had encountered in their practice. However, compared to the questions raised by Ji Bochang's group, theirs seemed rather elementary.

But this was only relative.

After all, apart from these individuals and Zhang Jing, the vast majority of the audience wore expressions of utter bewilderment, as if listening to an unfathomable lecture.

Zhang Jing couldn't help but click his tongue.

He had originally planned to ask the instructor about the doubts he encountered yesterday.

But now, it seemed wiser to quietly wait until he had mastered the visualization technique before speaking up.

Zhang Jing suddenly remembered his mother's advice before he left.

*The hardest thing in the world to predict is the human heart.* He hadn't even entered the academy yet. If he stood out too much, what if...

For Zhang Jing, as long as he practiced, his skill proficiency would increase. Once it was full, the skill would level up automatically.

Mastering the visualization technique was only a matter of time.

As long as it didn't affect the assessment, it was best to play it safe!

"Without the jade talisman, I'd probably be as lost as these people. Wait—no, without the jade talisman, I might not even have qualified for the academy's assessment in the first place."

Looking at Ji Bochang and the others, the gap between ordinary commoners and the scions of cultivation families was absurdly vast.

"But why would the academy structure the assessment this way?" Zhang Jing wondered. "Under these conditions, unless ordinary people have special opportunities or are true prodigies who can bulldoze through with sheer talent, it's nearly impossible for them to catch up to—let alone surpass—these aristocratic disciples."

Was fate really that important?

This didn't seem like a normal way to select inheriting disciples at all.

Meanwhile, Instructor Wang's gaze swept over Ji Bochang's group and the few others who had asked questions earlier.

"It seems these will be the ones who pass the academy's assessment this time. Especially these four—they might even earn a second-class evaluation?"

After a moment's thought, he announced:

"By the way, I should share some news with you all."

"In the Second Provisional Academy, there's a young student named Shen Qingqing who successfully mastered the visualization technique last night, passing the assessment with a comprehensive evaluation—first-class!"
