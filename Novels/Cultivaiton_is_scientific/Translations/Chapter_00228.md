# Chapter 228: Return  

The fierce battle between Qianye Temple and Senluo Sect at the Foundation Establishment level came to an abrupt halt that day.  

The Golden Core cultivators and Arhats from both sides had entered the battlefield, their terrifying auras alerting all Foundation Establishment cultivators and Buddhist monks that something significant had occurred.  

The demonic cultivators and monks withdrew from the battlefield, leaving only the Golden Core cultivators and Arhats behind.  

Three Golden Core demonic cultivators stood opposite four Arhats in the air, while four righteous-path Golden Core cultivators observed from a distance. At this moment, the righteous-path cultivators could not intervene.  

"Senluo Sect is truly a demonic sect, disregarding even the most fundamental rules of the cultivation world by sending Golden Core elders to participate in a Foundation Establishment battle. This battle has revealed the true nature of the demonic sect to all cultivators!" Although Zhiming Arhat was a venerable monk, his words were venomous.  

This was unusual for him, but the main reason was that Monk Jue Tu had gone missing—his figure was nowhere to be found on the battlefield.  

The battlefield, though vast for Foundation Establishment cultivators and monks, could be thoroughly inspected by Golden Core cultivators and Arhats in a short time.  

Monk Jue Tu was not yet an Arhat, but he was the most promising candidate to become one, and potentially the strongest among them.  

Qianye Temple had invested heavily in nurturing Monk Jue Tu—not just in resources, but also in the century-long effort to find suitable cultivators for him to kill, a laborious and unimaginable cost.  

Now, at the most critical moment of Monk Jue Tu's growth, he had been killed by a Golden Core demonic cultivator. Such an act was intolerable.  

If Senluo Sect failed to provide an explanation, a full-scale battle between Golden Core cultivators and Arhats might erupt immediately.  

"Qianye Temple is truly treacherous! You deceived Elder Lü into entering the battlefield with suppressed strength, set a trap to ambush him, and now you dare to shift the blame onto us!" a Golden Core demonic cultivator roared.  

Both sides were making baseless accusations, throwing mud at each other without evidence.  

However, the problem was that Senluo Sect had lost a mid-Golden Core elder, while Qianye Temple had only lost a monk, no matter how exceptional.  

Even the four righteous-path Golden Core cultivators watching from afar cast suspicious glances at the Arhats of Qianye Temple, wondering what means they had used to trap Elder Lü.  

Though the righteous-path cultivators would not side with a demonic sect like Senluo, they were beginning to believe Senluo Sect's claims.  

Elder Lü was a mid-Golden Core cultivator, a seasoned demonic elder. Though he had kept a low profile in recent decades, a century ago, his name had struck fear into many.  

For such a powerful Golden Core cultivator, suppressing his strength and then being surrounded and killed by a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators was simply impossible.  

If Elder Lü had truly fallen, there was no other explanation than Qianye Temple having orchestrated it.  

Moreover, Senluo Sect had no reason to lie about Elder Lü's death—such a matter could not be concealed.  

A major sect's elder was tied to numerous interests within the sect. Whether he had perished or not would be evident from the sect's reaction.  

"Nonsense! It was Lü the Demon who killed our Monk Jue Tu and then fled!" Zhiming Arhat retorted angrily.  

As he spoke, golden light flickered around his body, and his spiritual power surged. It seemed he was about to strike first.  

He knew that with four against three, and the addition of the four righteous-path Golden Core cultivators, they could overwhelm the three demonic Golden Core cultivators.  

Though their plan to eliminate a generation of demonic Foundation Establishment cultivators had failed, killing four Golden Core demonic cultivators would still deal a heavy blow to Senluo Sect.  

"Hmph!"  

"Amitabha!"  

Two voices resounded simultaneously on the battlefield, halting the impending Golden Core battle.  

"Greetings, Patriarch!"  

"Greetings, Venerable One!"  

The Golden Core cultivators and Arhats from both sides bowed toward the void. It turned out that both sides had Nascent Soul patriarchs and venerables overseeing the situation in secret.  

"Amitabha, Qianye Temple, withdraw," the Venerable's voice echoed in the void, impossible to pinpoint yet seemingly whispered directly into their ears.  

"Senluo Sect, return to the checkpoint!" the Nascent Soul patriarch of Senluo Sect commanded.  

It appeared that the patriarchs and venerables had reached some tacit agreement, unwilling to escalate the conflict further at this time.  

---  

Li Yuanba examined the contents of his storage bag: a set of 1,500 Fresnel reflector mirrors, all equipped with self-destruct mechanisms to prevent theft; a large jade bottle of pills; and the flying sword artifact obtained from Yun Xingyi.  

This flying sword artifact had always been reserved for Li Yuanba. Initially, he had planned to join Senluo Sect, uncertain of what challenges he might face, so the artifact had been kept by his main body, Li Shiming.  

Li Yuanba lacked the computational space that Li Shiming possessed, making his storage space vulnerable to inspection. If discovered, the flying sword artifact could provoke greed in Golden Core demonic cultivators, bringing danger rather than benefit.  

The Fresnel reflector mirrors were for cultivating *Purple Qi from the East*, a unique technique that greatly aided Li Shiming.  

As for the large jade bottle of pills, it naturally contained thirty top-grade pills.  

These were surplus pills saved by Li Shiming, who had now reached the peak of early Foundation Establishment and no longer needed such pills for cultivation. Even after breaking through to mid-Foundation Establishment, he would switch to mid-grade pills.  

Ironically, Li Shiming had initially hoped that Li Yuanba would advance first, leading the way and providing resources.  

However, fate had other plans. Li Shiming's exceptional alchemy skills, combined with his computational space, allowed him to refine top-grade pills. This enabled him to surpass Li Yuanba's cultivation speed, reaching the peak of early Foundation Establishment first.  

Li Yuanba's innate talent far exceeded Li Shiming's, as evidenced by how he had propelled Li Shiming's rapid progress during the Qi Refining stage.  

But shortly after Li Yuanba began cultivating *Ten Directions Sword Art*, he was taken in by Sword Elder and switched to *Sword Intent Soaring to the Heavens*, effectively restarting his cultivation.  

Now, he had only just stabilized his early Foundation Establishment strength. Reaching the peak would require over a decade of dedicated cultivation.  

Thus, the unusual situation arose where the main body, Li Shiming, was now supporting the clone, Li Yuanba.  

But since both were essentially one, there was no need to distinguish between them.  

Li Yuanba calmly stored the thirty top-grade pills, confident that they would allow him to break through to mid-Foundation Establishment within a few years.  

If Li Shiming could continue supplying top-grade pills, the breakthrough might come even sooner.  

After all, Li Shiming had reached the peak of early Foundation Establishment in just over a year with the aid of top-grade pills. With such a massive boost to cultivation speed, rapid progress was to be expected.  

Li Yuanba received orders to withdraw from the border checkpoint with the other Foundation Establishment cultivators. He boarded the sect's flying vessel, escorted by a Golden Core elder, and returned to the sect.  

---  

Meanwhile, Li Shiming deftly navigated through the formation. From within, he could sense the auras of several Golden Core cultivators on the battlefield.  

Fortunately, both he and his clone, Li Yuanba, had mastered *Step by Step, Lotus Blooms*, allowing them to swiftly distance themselves from the area in mere moments, avoiding detection.  

He summoned a flying vessel, set its course, and retrieved the storage bag delivered by Li Yuanba.  

The bag contained many items: the corpse of a physical cultivation Arhat—a top-tier material for refining corpse puppets.  

Li Yuanba had no use for it, and rather than trading it for resources, he had given it to Li Shiming.  

Though Li Shiming could not yet refine Silver Corpses, his alchemy skills ensured a steady supply of top-grade pills, making his advancement to Golden Core almost certain.  

Even if the晋升Golden Core resources in the Shushan Sect were scarce, they would undoubtedly prioritize nurturing a pill-refining master with spiritual fire and unparalleled talent.  

According to Master Ma's report to the sect's higher-ups, Li Shiming was virtually guaranteed to become a pill-refining master sooner or later.  

A Foundation Establishment pill-refining master could serve the sect for over a century, but if Li Shiming reached Golden Core, his service could extend beyond four centuries.  

Given this disparity, coupled with the rarity and importance of pill-refining masters, the sect would spare no effort to secure his advancement resources.  

Li Shiming glanced at the Arhat's corpse and stored it alongside Elder Lü's body. Both would be refined into Silver Corpses after he reached Golden Core, serving as his protectors.  

The storage bag also contained the *Thick Earth Shield Pearl* and third-grade earth-attribute materials, both useful to him.  

He then retrieved the array knowledge Li Yuanba had exchanged, scanning the jade slips into IBMz15 for analysis and study.  

*Moonlight Corpse Scroll*—though he wouldn't refine Silver Corpses directly yet, this technique could strengthen Nezha.  

Both Jiang Chen and Nezha had been refined using Qi Refining-level corpse refinement methods. Though the *Netherworld Ghost Formation*, a third-grade material, had elevated them to their current strength, they lacked the refinement process for Iron Corpses.  

With *Moonlight Corpse Scroll*, he found a way to further enhance Jiang Chen and Nezha.  

Once he gathered the necessary third-grade yin-attribute materials, he could even attempt to elevate Jiang Chen to Silver Corpse status.  

Jiang Chen was Li Yuanba's life-bound corpse puppet, which could exceed the cultivator's own realm by one major stage.  

However, Jiang Chen had only recently become an Iron Corpse, so it was best to let him stabilize at the peak of Iron Corpse first.  

As for Monk Jue Tu's corpse, stored in the Corpse Refining Coffin, Li Shiming planned to gather materials and refine it immediately upon returning. Nezha's strength was still lacking, and with his spiritual power, adding another corpse puppet wouldn't be a burden.  

Most cultivators limited themselves to one corpse puppet not due to spiritual constraints but because the materials were prohibitively expensive.  

Moreover, more puppets weren't necessarily better—refining one to its peak was far more effective than maintaining several mediocre ones.  

With his alchemy success, Li Shiming had no resource concerns. Since even Elder Lü had coveted Monk Jue Tu's corpse, he decided to refine it as his second corpse puppet.  

The Corpse Refining Coffin was a treasure that preserved corpses indefinitely and increased the success rate of refinement. It could even slowly strengthen refined corpses, effective even for Silver Corpses.  

Li Shiming stored both the Arhat's corpse and Elder Lü's body inside the coffin, which functioned as a spatial artifact capable of holding dozens of corpses.  

He had already removed the miscellaneous items from Elder Lü's person, including a spatial ring and a near-artifact-grade robe.  

The robe, though damaged by the *Upper-Grade Magical Artifact Electromagnetic Cannon*, was still a rare defensive treasure, capable of withstanding most Foundation Establishment attacks.  

The *Electromagnetic Cannon*'s power was beyond conventional cultivation world standards, representing the might of another world's technology.  

Unfortunately, its use was highly restrictive. While effective against Foundation Establishment cultivators, targeting Golden Core cultivators required extreme proximity to prevent evasion.  

But if a Golden Core cultivator got that close, the chances of detecting Li Shiming—let alone the four-meter-long cannon—would skyrocket.  

Moreover, Li Shiming wasn't confident the cannon could penetrate a Golden Core cultivator's defenses. Killing Elder Lü didn't count as slaying a Golden Core elder.  

At the time of the attack, Elder Lü had suppressed his strength to late Foundation Establishment, with his consciousness absent.  

The *Electromagnetic Cannon* had struck a Golden Core body with only late Foundation Establishment defenses—no protective spells, no Golden Core techniques, just a fatal misjudgment.  

The last Golden Core cultivator to face the cannon was the sword cultivator Yun Xingyi. Back then, Li Yuanba had first weakened Yun Xingyi's defenses with multiple strikes from his third-grade sword foundation before delivering the killing blow.  

Yun Xingyi had failed to withstand the cannon's strike, and neither had Elder Lü, who had taken the hit head-on.
