# Chapter 24: Securing Victory  

Qi Chuan had never neglected his cultivation of spells.  

Although his progress in the basic Five Elements spells had slowed after reaching the Minor Achievement level, it had remained steady. Finally, about half a month ago, both the Fireball Technique and the Water Arrow Technique advanced to the Major Achievement level.  

As for the Golden Skin Technique, Earth Wall Technique, and Wood Vine Technique, they were progressing more slowly, but they weren’t far behind.  

Qi Chuan had originally planned that if a Major Achievement-level Fireball Technique wasn’t enough to secure the inner sect quota, he would reveal his Major Achievement-level Water Arrow Technique.  

But judging by the current situation, the Fireball Technique alone would suffice.  

At this moment, in the great hall, numerous gazes were fixed on the crimson fireball floating above Qi Chuan’s left palm—larger than a clenched fist—and expressions of shock surfaced on many faces.  

A fireball of such size could only be condensed by a Fireball Technique at the Major Achievement level or higher.  

A Major Achievement-level Fireball Technique was virtually unheard of among early to mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators—it was exceedingly rare.  

Even reaching the Minor Achievement level was already considered a formidable skill for cultivators in the early to mid-stages of Qi Refining.  

A Major Achievement-level Fireball Technique could hold its own even among late-stage Qi Refining cultivators.  

If this were merely the result of a cultivator in the early to mid-stages spending decades honing the Fireball Technique to Major Achievement, it wouldn’t be so astonishing.  

But with Qi Chuan, it was entirely different.  

Because he had only been cultivating for about four years!  

To reach the Major Achievement level in the Fireball Technique in just four years—what kind of spellcasting prodigy was this?  

Moreover, his cultivation had simultaneously reached the fourth level of Qi Refining!  

Such a cultivation speed, combined with such spellcasting talent, was nothing short of terrifying.  

"Major Achievement-level Fireball Technique!"  

Not far away, Qi Chan'er inhaled sharply as she watched the crimson fireball rise, her eyes dimming slightly.  

She had also practiced the Fireball Technique, but so far, she had only reached the Entry level, not even Minor Achievement.  

While this was partly because she had devoted most of her energy to cultivation, even if she had focused entirely on spellcasting, she could never have reached Major Achievement in just four or five years.  

With her fourth-grade spiritual root, her spellcasting aptitude wouldn’t be too poor—with effort, she might have had a chance to reach Minor Achievement.  

But four cultivation levels in four years, paired with such terrifying spellcasting talent—these two factors combined had completely overshadowed her.  

Qi Chan'er knew that the inner sect quota was now beyond her reach.  

At the front of the hall, the Elder in charge of teachings widened his eyes in disbelief as he watched the crimson fireball manifest.  

This… this shouldn’t be possible!  

How could someone possess such terrifying spellcasting talent?  

Was this something a lower eighth-grade spiritual root could achieve?  

Regardless, with the Major Achievement Fireball Technique revealed, the outcome of the inner sect quota competition was decided. This was clear not only to the Elder but also to the Clan Leader and the other elders.  

"...Then it’s settled. The inner sect quota will go to Qi Chuan!" After a moment of silence, Clan Leader Qi Wuyou spoke solemnly, nodding slightly at Qi Chuan with a mix of astonishment and approval in his eyes.  

Even he hadn’t expected such a dark horse to emerge in this competition.  

With four cultivation levels in four years and a Major Achievement Fireball Technique, even as Clan Leader, he couldn’t possibly deny Qi Chuan the quota without losing credibility.  

Moreover, as the Clan Leader, he would never do such a thing.  

The inner sect quota was far too important—it naturally belonged to the most talented and promising young cultivator.  

As for Qi Chan'er, alternative arrangements would have to be made.  

"Next, we’ll determine the three outer sect quotas," Qi Wuyou announced.  

Thus, another round of competition unfolded in the hall.  

However, while the younger cultivators were fervently vying for the outer sect quotas, the elders at the front of the hall seemed somewhat distracted.  

After witnessing such brilliance, the distribution of the outer sect quotas seemed trivial in comparison.  

In the end, the three quotas went to Qi Chan'er and two other young cultivators who had reached the third level of Qi Refining and possessed decent spiritual roots.  

With that, the competition for the Fengyue Sect’s recruitment quotas came to a close, and the crowd gradually dispersed from the assembly hall.  

Yet, throughout the process, many couldn’t help but steal glances at Qi Chuan, their eyes still filled with awe.  

Among them were Qi Li and Qi Huo.  

They had never imagined Qi Chuan would achieve this.  

But by now, they had begun to understand—Qi Chuan’s lower eighth-grade spiritual root must be special, perhaps accompanied by other unique traits. Otherwise, with only a one-grade difference in spiritual roots, how could the gap between them be so vast?  

Before long, Qi Chuan and Second Elder returned to their secluded mountain residence.  

Once there, Qi Bai Cang kept casting sidelong glances at Qi Chuan, as if trying to discern something.  

"What is it, Second Elder?" Qi Chuan couldn’t take it anymore and asked helplessly.  

"I’m just wondering—how did you do it?" Qi Bai Cang clicked his tongue, still somewhat dazed.  

His lower eighth-grade spiritual root descendant had suddenly reached the fourth level of Qi Refining and mastered the Fireball Technique at the Major Achievement level.  

His impression of Qi Chuan had been stuck at the second level of Qi Refining. He knew Qi Chuan had reached the first level in a month, mastered a spell in half a month, and reached the second level in a year—showing remarkable compatibility with the Evergreen Art and spellcasting talent. But this was beyond exaggerated.  

He had assumed Qi Chuan’s progress would slow after reaching the second level and mastering basic spells, as cultivation grew harder with each step.  

Yet Qi Chuan had defied expectations, becoming even more formidable—and even securing an inner sect quota in the Fengyue Sect!  

Didn’t that mean Qi Chuan’s future achievements were guaranteed to at least match those of a late-stage Qi Refining elder in the Qi Clan?  

Did Qi Bai Cang now have a future elder as his backing?  

"Just assume I have some kind of bloodline or special constitution. I can’t explain it myself," Qi Chuan said with a shrug.  

He couldn’t very well reveal his hundredfold multiplier.  

Besides, in the world of immortal cultivation, unique bloodlines and constitutions were inherently mysterious.  

Generally, special bloodlines and constitutions were classified into three grades and nine tiers. The most powerful among them could even surpass spiritual roots in rarity, producing effects that left cultivators in awe.  

However, the variety of special bloodlines and constitutions was vast—many existed only in records or legends, and some had never even been seen before.  

Moreover, their emergence followed no discernible pattern.  

Constitutions aside—those were purely arcane.  

As for bloodlines, in the world of immortal cultivation, human bloodlines were never pure and often mingled with others. Even the slightest trace of another bloodline carried a minuscule chance of awakening or manifesting ancestral traits.  

Attributing his uniqueness to a special constitution or bloodline was the most plausible explanation.  

"A constitution or bloodline, huh?" Qi Bai Cang sighed deeply. "I’m your Second Elder—we share blood. In theory, if you’ve awakened something, I might have a sliver of a chance too. If I had, I wouldn’t still be stuck at the third level of Qi Refining."
