# Chapter 71: Courting Death!

“Understood. Many thanks, Wen Hou.”

Zhou Tian and Zhou Zui thanked him and stepped aside. They didn’t know this person too well, but regardless, his status wasn't significantly higher than theirs, so normal courtesy and communication would suffice; there was no need for flattery.

“How was it? The young lady from Heavenly Pass, was she alright?” Zhang Yi whispered.

“Alright? Let me tell you…” Zhou Zui leaned in, discussing something with him in a low voice, occasionally letting out lewd chuckles.

Meanwhile, Zhou Yan and Zhou Xunchuan conversed with Wen Hou, mostly about the recent happenings at Heavenly Pass.

Including themselves, only four of the Eight State factions had arrived so far: the monks from Luo Heaven Temple, the people from Treasure Gathering Pavilion, the people from the Fools, and the people from Armament Nation.

In recent years, the Void Storms surrounding the God-Abandoned Land had intensified, expanding their coverage by tens of thousands of kilometers.

Later that evening, Wen Hou prepared a welcoming feast for them, made entirely from the unique produce of the God-Abandoned Land. These were ingredients they had never tasted before, allowing them to truly enjoy the cuisine. In particular, a soup called “Eight Treasures Exquisite Divine Core Porridge” left Zhou Tian reminiscing for a long time.

By the time they returned to the mansion, the sky had completely darkened. Outside the Divine Glass Barrier that enveloped Heavenly Pass, the pitch-black Void Storm raged, stirring up streaks of divine light on the barrier.

Zhou Tian told the others to go back first while he circled the mansion repeatedly, measuring the distance step by step. Seeing him like this, Zhou Zui couldn’t help but ask, “Zhou Tian, what are you doing?”

“Just full and bored, trying to digest.” Zhou Tian replied dismissively.

“…”

Hearing Zhou Tian’s perfunctory answer, the others could only shake their heads helplessly. They entered the mansion, leaving him to his own devices.

After carefully measuring a few more times, Zhou Tian had a rough idea in his mind. He then entered the mansion, deliberately coughing loudly a few times before entering his own room.

As night fell, Heavenly Pass became utterly silent. A curfew was enforced within Heavenly Pass; no one was allowed to linger on the streets after the Void Storm descended.

Teams of patrolling soldiers marched through the streets, their full body armor clanging.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

A team of patrolling soldiers stopped in front of a building. A person resembling a captain stepped forward and knocked on the door.

The door opened, and a head completely shrouded in a black robe poked out. After seeing the patrolling soldiers outside, it remained silent for a moment before speaking, “What can I do for you, gentlemen?”

“Maintenance fee!” The captain, of medium build, wearing black iron armor and holding a bronze war spear, his eyes radiating chilling cold, demanded money directly.

“Captain Li, wasn’t it just the day before yesterday…” A voice came from under the black robe, tinged with slight dissatisfaction.

“Maintenance fee!” the captain roared, his bronze war spear glinting with a cold, piercing light, as if ready to strike.

“Yes, yes!” The black-robed figure pulled out a crystal clear, golden-glowing divine crystal and handed it to the captain.

The soldier captain took the divine crystal, put it away with a flick of his hand, and turned to walk towards the next house.

“Gentlemen, take care, take care…” The black-robed head said. Once the soldiers had walked away, it closed the door, spat, and muttered, “Continue. The Heavenly Pass patrol team is here to collect protection money again. Damn it, it’s getting more and more expensive.”

One divine crystal was equivalent to one million spirit stones, which was no small sum.

The room had been expanded several times by a formation. Being able to use a spatial formation under the suppression of a Heavenly Venerate Formation was not something that could be achieved merely by spending resources.

The room was lavishly decorated, completely different from the simple appearance outside. On a platform stood a winged, completely naked female humanoid creature. Its face was exquisite but devoid of expression, its body bound by silver chains, with runes inscribed upon them, flashing with golden light.

Beside it stood a figure completely enveloped in a black robe. Hearing the words from the person at the door, they spoke, “Gentlemen, this is a remnant of an ancient divine king’s lineage from the God-Abandoned Land. Its unique flavor is quite different from other creatures. Starting bid: ten divine crystals!”

Many people sat below the platform, all shrouded in black robes. Before long, someone spoke, “Eleven!”

The voice was incredibly hoarse, indistinguishable as male or female, clearly disguised.

It turned out that this place was engaged in the auction and sale of humanoid species. The Eight States had a common regulation that no humanoid beings could be traded, yet it was happening here in secret.

Time slowly passed. Two more hours went by. Zhou Tian listened intently, hearing no more movement. He silently estimated the distance, then his form blurred, and he disappeared from the room.

He reappeared outside the mansion, in a blind spot, avoiding nearby guards. Recalling the distances he had measured during the day, Zhou Tian continuously teleported, eventually leaving the Heavenly Qin’s encampment.

The street, unlike its bustling daytime appearance, was now utterly silent.

*Clang!*

The sound of patrolling soldiers approached. Zhou Tian instantly teleported away from his spot. Moments later, the soldiers passed by, knocked on a door, received a divine crystal, and then moved on to the next building.

Zhou Tian watched this scene from a short distance, his eyes gleaming. It seemed interesting. Since divine sense couldn’t penetrate objects within Heavenly Pass, these soldiers couldn’t detect him.

After the soldiers had gone far, Zhou Tian approached the building. From the outside, it didn’t appear to have anything special.

Zhou Tian walked to a wall, calculated for a moment, and muttered, “This should be the distance.” His form blurred, and he teleported inside.

Upon appearing inside the house, Zhou Tian looked around. It was a dark space, almost invisible to the eye. He had appeared in a corner, and with the dim light, no one noticed him.

He casually tore off a piece of cloth, tied it over his face to conceal himself, and walked deeper inside.

Everyone here was wrapped in black robes, making it seem like an offline gathering of a cult. Only he had a piece of cloth wrapped around his face, attracting quite a few gazes as he walked.

After circling around, Zhou Tian realized this place seemed to be a hub for intelligence exchange. No wonder it was hidden so secretly, likely competing with the Fools for business.

In the center was a large jade tablet, displaying a continuous scroll of information. If one had a need, they could select an item, and someone would come over to conduct the transaction.

After observing discreetly, Zhou Tian found a corner, calculated the distance, and confirmed he could teleport out in one go.

“Cough, cough, gentlemen!” Zhou Tian couldn’t change his voice, so he simply lowered it.

In the silent environment, Zhou Tian’s voice was like a clap of thunder from a clear sky, instantly drawing everyone’s attention.

“I have a super important piece of news here, regarding an ancient divine beast! This divine beast was incredibly powerful, having run rampant for an entire era. Wherever it passed, only shattered darkness remained!” Zhou Tian said mysteriously.

“What kind of divine beast?” After a moment of silence, someone among the black-robed figures asked. They were all well-traveled and experienced individuals, not easily swayed, and wanted to inquire about the details.
