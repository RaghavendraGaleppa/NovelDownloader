# Chapter 11: The Arrival of Immortals

After replenishing the power supply in the server room, Li Shiming's consciousness accessed the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique" document stored in the large IBM z15 server.

With the accumulated knowledge from his original body, he could somewhat understand this cultivation technique rather than being completely lost.

This immortal cultivation technique involved absorbing an energy called spiritual qi for personal use, generating a qi vortex in the chest. The formation of a stable qi vortex marked the first level of Qi Refinement, signifying entry into immortal cultivation.

The "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique" was a foundational method for the Qi Refinement stage, usable until reaching peak Qi Refinement, after which another technique would be needed.

Li Shiming attempted to sit on the ground and sense the surrounding spiritual qi according to the technique's method. However, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't perceive any so-called spiritual qi.

Unbeknownst to him, transitioning from a mortal to sensing spiritual qi required being in an area abundant with spiritual qi. Those with poorer innate talent might even need medicinal aids to pass this initial stage.

The mortal world naturally had sparse spiritual qi, and being in Nanling Prefecture—far from the relatively qi-rich deep mountains and old forests—made sensing spiritual qi even more difficult.

Disappointed, Li Shiming turned his consciousness to the "Introduction to Talismanic Script" document. Talismanic script was the writing used for creating talismans.

The document contained methods for crafting various basic talismans, all of which required the practitioner to possess spiritual qi. More complex talismans demanded greater amounts of qi and stronger cultivation from the creator.

Through this text, Li Shiming learned that the glowing green patterns on Shi Ximing's legs had been the effect of a basic Lightness Talisman.

The various talismans with their miraculous effects fascinated him, particularly the basic Lightning Talisman, which could generate electricity. If he could create it, he might solve his power shortage issues.

He shook his head helplessly. Not only could he not sense spiritual qi, but even if he could, he lacked the materials to craft talismans. These materials, mostly cultivated by immortal practitioners and imbued with spiritual qi, were nonexistent in the mortal world.

At the end of "Introduction to Talismanic Script," there were notes about immortal artifacts—left by Chief Escort Wang's ancestors to guide any descendants with cultivation potential entering the immortal world. This was how Li Shiming learned that the wooden sword was a high-grade magical artifact, and the leather pouch he found was a storage bag, a common spatial item among cultivators.

---

Storage bags were the lowest grade of spatial items and relatively easy to open, requiring only spiritual power. The problem circled back to the same issue: he still needed spiritual qi.

Li Shiming remained patient. Although practicing the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique" yielded no results, he reviewed it daily. To deepen his understanding, he used the IBM z15's data input capability to record all books from his family's study, along with numerous Taoist texts borrowed from nearby temples through his father Li Wenyuan's connections.

As his knowledge expanded, his comprehension of the technique grew. He felt confident that once he could sense spiritual qi, he could begin proper cultivation.

Four mornings later, he carried a book into the garden. Most of the garden had been cleaned up, except for the area near the artificial hill. The investigation had concluded, and according to his servant Mo Yan, the large pit by the hill would be filled and replanted within a day or two.

With the busy officials gone, the garden regained its tranquility, lifting his spirits. He sat in the pavilion as Siqin served him tea and pastries. The peaceful atmosphere, accompanied by a beautiful maid, made even classical texts enjoyable.

After learning of the immortals in the capital, his attitude toward the provincial examinations—previously unimportant to him—had changed. Passing the triennial autumn exams would qualify him for the spring exams in the capital, providing a legitimate reason to travel there. Finding an immortal there might solve his inability to sense spiritual qi—at least it was a hope worth pursuing.

As for passing the exams, with his mind holding the entire family library and memorizing over six hundred thousand words of the "Classics Anthology," he couldn't imagine anyone surpassing his literary prowess.

However, his peaceful reading was soon interrupted by approaching footsteps. He set down his book and looked toward the source. The back garden was private property; only his father would normally enter after the investigation's conclusion. Yet it was still morning—Li Wenyuan's busiest time, making his presence unlikely.

As he pondered, Li Wenyuan appeared, leading a young man and woman. The two walked beside his father without deference, indicating extraordinary status. Their condescending expressions—treating ordinary people as ants—irked Li Shiming, unaccustomed to such hierarchical attitudes from his egalitarian world.

Another clue to their identity was the leather pouches at their waists, different in design from his but adorned with similarly intricate patterns.

"Shiming, come greet these two immortals!" Li Wenyuan called, knowing his son's composed nature but wanting to avoid any accidental offense. As a prefect, he had no authority over immortals.

Li Shiming stood and bowed in the scholar's manner. The immortals merely nodded briefly before ignoring him.

"The immortals wish to see the site. Continue your studies," Li Wenyuan said, noting their disinterest.

"Father, I was the first to discover the site. I'll accompany you," Li Shiming offered.

After a glance at the immortals, the male cultivator nodded upon hearing Li Shiming's connection to the scene. Dismissing Siqin, Li Shiming followed his father and the immortals.
