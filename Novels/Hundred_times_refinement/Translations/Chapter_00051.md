# Chapter 1: Lin Xuan

"Ai!"

A sigh of disappointment escaped the lips of an ordinary-looking young man, his face expressionless. Another failure—this marked the forty-ninth unsuccessful attempt at breaking through in the past three months. Even with Lin Xuan's resilient willpower, he now found himself drowning in frustration and despair.

A bitter smile tugged at the corners of his lips as he shook his head and glanced at his hands. Could his aptitude truly be this poor?

Lin Xuan clenched his fists tightly, his nails digging deep into his palms, yet he seemed oblivious to the pain.

At seventeen years old, Lin Xuan had been a disciple of the Piaoyun Valley for three years.

Piaoyun Valley was a minor sect in the cultivation world, with nearly a thousand disciples, and Lin Xuan was but one among the lowest-ranked.

In those three years, his fellow disciples who had entered the sect alongside him had long since advanced to the mid-stage of the Spirit Moving realm. A few with exceptional talent had even reached the fifth layer—the late stage. Yet, Lin Xuan remained stuck at the first layer.

His slow progress wasn't due to lack of effort. On the contrary, his dedication was unmatched among the low-ranked disciples. While others practiced their techniques once, he practiced three times. While others meditated for an hour, he meditated for three. But despite his relentless toil, his gains were pitifully meager, leaving him far behind his peers. A deep sense of defeat weighed heavily on his heart.

Cultivation was divided into eight major stages: Spirit Moving, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, Soul Separation, Cave Profound, Spirit Division, and Heavenly Tribulation. Each stage was further divided into seven layers, with the first two layers considered the early stage, the third and fourth the mid-stage, the fifth and sixth the late stage, and the seventh layer referred to as the Great Perfection. Once the bottleneck was overcome, one could advance to the next stage.

Though the path of immortality was arduous, it progressed from shallow to profound. For instance, the first two layers of the Spirit Moving realm were merely introductory. Those with good aptitude could master the first layer in two months, while those with slightly poorer aptitude might take three to five months. Unfortunately, this only applied to those with spiritual roots.

Spiritual roots—known as such in the cultivation world—had never been precisely defined despite millennia of study. It was only understood that those with spiritual roots cultivated at a far faster pace than ordinary people without them. In theory, mortals with average aptitude could still cultivate, but the effort required would yield half the results—no, more accurately, ten times the effort would scarcely match half the gains of those with spiritual roots.

Simply put, it was a thankless endeavor.

And unfortunately, Lin Xuan was one of those ordinary people without spiritual roots.

Normally, someone like him—devoid of spiritual roots—would never be accepted into a cultivation sect, no matter how fervently he sought the path of immortality. However, Lin Xuan's circumstances were special. Three years ago, by sheer chance, he had saved a severely injured elder of Piaoyun Valley. Grateful, the elder had recommended him for entry, allowing him to become a disciple of this minor sect.

Three years had passed, and Lin Xuan had never once slacked in his cultivation. He trained through the bitterest winters and the hottest summers, pouring in far more sweat and effort than his peers. Yet despite this, he remained hopelessly behind.

In the pursuit of immortality, aptitude mattered more than effort. Hard work alone could scarcely bridge the gap!

Take his recent attempts at breaking through, for example. Lin Xuan could feel that his cultivation had reached the peak of the first layer, with only the slightest barrier separating him from the second layer of the Spirit Moving realm. But that tiny gap loomed like an insurmountable chasm, no matter how desperately he struggled to cross it.

After a long while, Lin Xuan loosened his clenched fists and exhaled deeply, as if expelling the gloom from his heart. He settled back into a cross-legged position and began the Inner Sight technique.

Inner Sight was a minor spell in the cultivation world, used to observe the flow of spiritual energy within one's dantian and meridians. It served as an auxiliary technique during cultivation.

Within his dantian, there was only emptiness, save for faint wisps of pale blue energy—this was the legendary spiritual power.

But the energy was sparse and thin, a reflection of Lin Xuan's low cultivation level.

Cultivation was, in essence, defying the heavens. And to defy the heavens, one needed immense divine abilities, achieved only through grueling trials. Only then could one master the five elements, absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, refine it, and ultimately make it one's own.

These faint wisps of spiritual energy represented Lin Xuan's gains from three years of cultivation—meager compared to his peers. Without spiritual roots, his path was far more arduous than theirs.

Under the guidance of his spiritual sense, the scattered wisps of energy began to gather and intertwine. Each strand was no thicker than a hair, but over time, they coalesced into a single stream about the width of a little finger.

A faint white mist rose from Lin Xuan's head, and his body was drenched in sweat. The mere act of gathering his spiritual energy had drained him completely. For an ordinary person pursuing cultivation, every step was indeed fraught with thorns.

His breathing grew heavier, but Lin Xuan's expression remained unchanged. After three years, he was long accustomed to this.

Once the spiritual energy was gathered, Lin Xuan didn't relax. Carefully, he extended his spiritual sense and guided the energy out of his dantian, directing it into his meridians according to the sect's teachings.

For cultivators, the dantian was the foundation where spiritual energy was stored, while the eight extraordinary meridians were equally crucial. When spiritual energy completed a full cycle through the meridians—from head to toe—it was called a Great Zhou Tian.

With each such cycle, the spiritual energy would grow slightly stronger. Though the increase was minuscule, accumulation over time made a difference. Performing several cycles daily would gradually enhance one's spiritual power.

Of course, the cultivation world boasted countless techniques, and each sect's method for conducting a Great Zhou Tian differed, yielding vastly different results.

The Great Zhou Tian was a fundamental practice for every cultivator, yet it was far from as simple as outsiders might imagine—in fact, it was exceedingly difficult.

The path of the spiritual energy's flow required no thought, as the sect's techniques had already laid it out clearly. One needed only to follow the prescribed route. However, the speed of the flow had to be determined through personal experience, as everyone's meridians were unique.

Some had robust meridians, capable of withstanding greater pressure, allowing not only more spiritual energy but also faster flow. Others had weaker meridians, making the opposite true. Generally, the better one's spiritual roots, the stronger their meridians—and vice versa.

Lin Xuan was an ordinary person, lacking even spiritual roots. Thus, performing a Great Zhou Tian demanded far more effort and time from him.

Every step had to be taken with utmost care. Moving too quickly would not only disrupt the cycle but could also damage his meridians.
