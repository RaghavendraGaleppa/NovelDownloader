# Chapter 69: War of Attrition

During Lin Xuan's period of seclusion, the cultivation world of Yanzhou in the Zhao Kingdom underwent a major upheaval, sparked by a conflict between two cultivation families—the Yan and Wang clans.

The Wang family accused Yan Tianheng of murder and robbery, alleging he had ambushed their disciples. Meanwhile, the Yan family, whose patriarch had gone missing, suspected that Yan Tianheng had actually fallen victim to the Wang family's schemes. Both sides stubbornly clung to their versions of events, locked in endless disputes...

Since Yan Tianheng had already been killed by Lin Xuan, the truth of the matter remained unresolved no matter how much they argued. While cultivation families held more influence than rogue cultivators, their power was still limited. However, both families happened to have sects backing them.

The Wang family's ancestors had once been elders of the Drifting Cloud Valley. Though they had since branched out on their own, ties of gratitude remained. Meanwhile, Yan Tianheng's second daughter was the beloved concubine of the only Core Formation cultivator in the Fire Spirit Sect. 

With these connections in play, and given the long-standing rivalry between the Fire Spirit Sect and Drifting Cloud Valley for dominance over Yanzhou's cultivation world—grudges that had been suppressed due to mutual wariness—the two major powers now took sides. Once these giants moved, the other sects in Yanzhou couldn't remain neutral. Some aligned with the Fire Spirit Sect, others with Drifting Cloud Valley, forming two opposing alliances.

At first, it was just verbal sparring, followed by skirmishes between their affiliated cultivation families. Fortunately, the major sects themselves refrained from direct conflict. But after two years, the situation hadn't improved—instead, it escalated further.

The feud between the Yan and Wang families had merely been the spark. Now, the two cultivation alliances led by Drifting Cloud Valley and the Fire Spirit Sect were truly at odds. 

Yet neither side engaged in all-out warfare. Their strengths were too evenly matched—a full-scale battle would only result in mutual destruction, benefiting no one. The high-level cultivators on both sides weren't fools. Despite their hatred, they valued their lives too much.

Instead, they adopted a war of attrition.

What exactly was a war of attrition? 

To understand, one must consider the traditions of the cultivation world. For tens of thousands of years, as people pursued the path of immortality, conflicts between sects—both large and small—had been common. 

Such conflicts took two forms. The first was a fight to the death, usually occurring when one side was significantly stronger than the other or when there was an irreconcilable blood feud. In such cases, with no room for compromise, both sides would gather all their cultivators and wage brutal battles until one side was annihilated.

These conflicts were grand in scale but short in duration, often resolved within months, leaving one sect utterly destroyed.

The second form was the war of attrition.

This occurred when two sects were evenly matched and their conflict didn't involve an irreconcilable grudge. Neither side wanted a fight to the death, yet neither was willing to negotiate a peaceful resolution. So what did they do? 

They dragged it out, fighting slowly over time.

In this scenario, neither side would gather all their cultivators for large-scale battles. Even high-level cultivators rarely engaged in direct confrontations. 

The standard practice was to declare the opposing sect and its allies as enemies—anyone encountered would be killed on sight. 

In other words, they wouldn't attack each other's headquarters but would instead hunt down isolated members of the opposing faction. 

This type of conflict didn't inflict fatal damage, but it could drag on for an astonishingly long time. There were cases in the cultivation world where two hostile sects engaged in minor skirmishes for over a thousand years, spanning generations. While few high-level cultivators perished, the number of low-level cultivators hunted down over the years could reach tens of thousands.

When Lin Xuan learned that his sect, Drifting Cloud Valley, was engaged in a war of attrition with the Fire Spirit Sect, his expression darkened. He nearly cursed aloud. The reason was simple: in a war of attrition, since neither side attacked the other's headquarters, staying within the sect ensured safety. But venturing outside meant becoming a potential target for enemy hunters.

Yet now, he had no choice but to leave.

Having reached the peak of the Qi Refining stage, Lin Xuan's next goal was naturally to achieve Foundation Establishment. 

Strictly speaking, low-level cultivators in the Qi Refining stage hadn't truly stepped onto the path of immortality—their lifespans remained similar to ordinary mortals. Only after Foundation Establishment could one be considered a true cultivator.

But achieving this was far from easy. In Drifting Cloud Valley, Foundation Establishment cultivators made up only a tenth of all disciples, highlighting the difficulty.

Though Lin Xuan possessed the ability to purify pills and could consume them in large quantities, their effects weren't omnipotent. At the very least, the pills he was currently taking weren't enough to help him break through to Foundation Establishment.

In truth, the pills Lin Xuan was using were already incredibly valuable. After reaching the peak of Qi Refining, both his spiritual power and the size of the starry sea in his dantian had grown exponentially. He could now purify not just mid-grade pills but even high-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills.

For anyone else, consuming high-grade pills combined with diligent cultivation would make Foundation Establishment relatively straightforward. After all, even major sects had very few such pills—ordinary cultivators would be moved to tears if they ever got their hands on a mid-grade pill in their lifetime.

But Lin Xuan's situation was different. He was an ordinary person without a spiritual root. Even high-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills and relentless effort weren't enough to help him break through. 

At first, Lin Xuan refused to accept this. But after failing dozens of times and confirming this conclusion, he was thoroughly frustrated.

However, his mental fortitude far surpassed that of ordinary people. He would never give up. Clinging to a sliver of hope, he even ventured back to the Path of Trial—that terrifying place filled with illusions but abundant in spiritual energy—to consume high-grade pills and attempt another breakthrough.

Yet no matter how hard he tried, no matter how many high-grade pills he took, he simply couldn't succeed. Human effort had its limits. 

It seemed there was only one hope left...
