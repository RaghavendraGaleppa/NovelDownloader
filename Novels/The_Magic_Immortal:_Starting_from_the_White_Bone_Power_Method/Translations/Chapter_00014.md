# Chapter 14: Perfect Artifact Restrictions  

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*  

The silver needles rebounded upon impact, flying back into Wang Chan's hand. The white robe remained untouched, not a single tear or movement.  

"Three needles at once, and not even a single hole?" Wang Chan thought in disbelief as he dashed beneath the crooked old tree.  

By now, he was certain the robe wasn’t some ghostly or demonic entity. Upon closer inspection, the white garment looked familiar—though he couldn’t discern its grade, it was likely a mid-tier magical robe.  

His eyes flickered toward the neighboring courtyard, No. 70, and he quickly grasped the situation. His face twitched involuntarily.  

"First, she calls me to clean the dirty ground, and now she wants me to wash her clothes. What’s next? If she gets dirty, will she call me to wash her too? What does she take me for?"  

Just as he was grumbling internally, a rhythmic *thud-thud-thud* reached his ears—like someone chopping meat on a cutting board.  

Following the sound, he realized it came from the neighboring No. 70 cave dwelling.  

"Is that Senior Chen, the late-stage Qi Refiner, making breakfast?"  

Wang Chan shook his head at the absurd thought. A woman like her cooking? He’d sooner believe she was dismembering demonic beasts or ghosts.  

But then, what kind of terrifying creature would require a late-stage Qi Refiner to chop with such force?  

The thought sent a chill down his spine, especially as he stared at the bloodstained robe before him, imagining Senior Chen’s fierce butchering expression.  

Then, a glint of light caught his eye.  

A token and two spirit coins rested on a nearby tree branch. The coins shimmered under the sunlight filtering through the leaves, radiant as a first love’s smile.  

Instantly, his frustration evaporated. Two spirit coins just for washing clothes? He was going to do laundry anyway—easy money.  

Wang Chan took down the bloodied robe and examined it carefully. Magical robes were rare treasures. He didn’t even own a low-tier one, let alone a mid-tier. He wondered how difficult it’d be to clean.  

As it turned out, those two spirit coins weren’t so easily earned.  

Whether due to the robe’s material or the sinister bloodstains, Wang Chan spent half an hour using three different methods and two bursts of magical energy before finally cleaning the white robe.  

Activating the token, he bypassed the simple protective formation of the neighboring courtyard, climbed over the wall, hung the robe to dry, left the token behind, and returned.  

An incense stick’s time later...  

After breakfast, Wang Chan stood before a mirror, straightening his worn-out green robe. He mused about acquiring a magical robe someday. Even disregarding their mystical properties, their texture alone was leagues beyond ordinary fabric.  

---  

If he wore one while soliciting medical clients, his success rate would surely soar.  

Just as he finished tidying up and prepared to leave, a weak knock sounded at the door. It didn’t sound like the Red Leaf Gang’s lackeys or the duty hall’s petty officials.  

Opening the door, he found Old Man Zhang, the hunchback.  

"Weren’t you supposed to return in half a month? What brings you back so soon?"  

A quick glance revealed Old Man Zhang looking haggard—thinner, pale, with sunken eyes and a more pronounced hunch. His voice was as feeble as a deflated balloon.  

"Brother Wang, I’ve overexerted myself. A round of acupuncture, please."  

Wang Chan ushered him inside. After a thorough examination, he said, "Your vitality is severely depleted. First, take this bottle of *Essence-Nourishing Spirit Liquid*. Then I’ll use *Revitalizing Cloud Manipulation* to regulate your energy before the acupuncture."  

Old Man Zhang obediently complied.  

An hour later, once some vitality had been restored, Wang Chan began the acupuncture.  

As the needles worked, Old Man Zhang regained enough energy to chat.  

"Did you hear? Fellow Iron’s wife died last night."  

Wang Chan paused. He rarely socialized, so news often eluded him. But this was unexpected.  

Though he wasn’t skilled in treating external injuries, he knew Fellow Iron’s wife hadn’t sustained fatal wounds—her heart was untouched. With a cultivator’s resilience and timely treatment from Fellow Tang, she should’ve survived.  

Seeing his disbelief, Old Man Zhang continued, "That Three-Eyed Crimson Hound wasn’t just a mid-tier demonic beast—it also possessed a *Crimson Venom* ability. Though low-tier, the toxin lurked undetected in her flesh. Fellow Tang missed it entirely. Yesterday, the venom flared up, attacking her heart. No one could’ve saved her."  

"Crimson Venom..."  

"On my way back, I saw Fellow Iron confronting Fellow Tang at the mountain’s base. They argued for ages." Old Man Zhang rambled on, "They say that Three-Eyed Crimson Hound has struck several times within a three-hundred-mile radius of Lotus Mountain. It hides by day, hunts by night, and moves unpredictably. The patrols have tried catching it multiple times, but it’s too cunning."  

Wang Chan’s expression darkened.  

Demonic beasts and ghosts with awakened abilities usually lurked deep in the White Mountain Range, rarely venturing into the wilds. First, the tiger-jiao, now this crimson hound... Had something changed in the mountains, or was there something in the wilds drawing them out?  

---  

At least the hound hid during the day. Otherwise, he wouldn’t dare set up his stall at the Black River Market.  

By noon, Wang Chan withdrew the needles. A hint of color returned to Old Man Zhang’s face, and his posture straightened slightly.  

"Your skills grow sharper by the day, Brother Wang."  

Feeling restored, Old Man Zhang clasped his hands in gratitude and presented ten pounds of *White Jade Spirit Rice*—worth two spirit coins.  

A bottle of *Essence-Nourishing Spirit Liquid* alone cost one coin and thirty spirit pearls. Add the hours spent and the seventeen artifact restrictions activated in the *Minor Withering-Life Needles*, and Wang Chan’s fingers ached from the repeated needling.  

A few days ago, this would’ve taken two or three sessions.  

Given the effort, two coins would’ve been fair. Seventy pearls was practically a friends-and-family discount.  

"Brother Zhang, you should rest and recuperate for the next two months. Don’t overwork yourself tending those spirit fields," Wang Chan advised.  

Yet Old Man Zhang stubbornly grinned. "A man must keep his word. Once I commit to those fields, I’ll see it through—even if I have to crawl."  

Wang Chan: "..."  

"Brother Wang, about that wine from last time..." Old Man Zhang subtly produced a five-pound sack of rice.  

"You finished it all?!" Wang Chan frowned.  

Old Man Zhang nodded sheepishly.  

No wonder he was so drained. A few more rounds, and his foundation would crumble.  

Wang Chan waved him off. "Gone! All gone!"  

Dejected, Old Man Zhang left.  

"Has he drunk some bewitching potion? Sacrificing his health for a few acres of water spirit fields..."  

Seeing the late hour, Wang Chan decided against going to the market. Instead, he brewed a pot of spirit tea and settled in with his newly acquired *Compendium of Three Thousand Demonic Beasts*. The book’s vivid descriptions of various creatures were utterly engrossing.  

---  

Under the cold night wind, Wang Chan consumed *Essence-Nourishing Spirit Liquid* and entered a meditative state.  

Three hours later, he awoke with anticipation.  

**[Today’s cultivation: +1 EXP]**  
**[Minor Withering-Life Needles artifact restriction: +1]**  
**[Minor Withering-Life Needles artifact restrictions perfected]**  

The needle case in his hand trembled—longer and more intensely than ever before. His smile froze as the vibrations persisted.  

When a magical artifact’s restrictions reached perfection, its power surged, and the wielder gained an intuitive connection, wielding it as effortlessly as their own limbs.  

After a dozen breaths, the needle case finally stilled.  

**[Minor Withering-Life Needles restrictions perfected. Spend 63 EXP to initiate divine refinement?]**
