# Chapter 96: Multi-Person Battle, The Oriole Behind

Chu Ning finally decided to act.

If Old Man Sun had managed to escape just now, and the three pursuers had followed him out, Chu Ning would naturally have chosen to seize the opportunity to leave. But now, Old Man Sun hadn't managed to escape. This also meant that once the battle between the two sides ended, Chu Ning's hidden location would inevitably be exposed.

Old Man Sun, a fifth-level Qi Condensation cultivator, was at a disadvantage against the three, but surprisingly, he still managed to hold his ground for a few exchanges. This somewhat surprised Chu Ning. However, no matter what, facing Old Man Sun alone was better than facing the other three.

Several Geng Metal Sword Talismans shot out as Chu Ning's spiritual arts directly attacked the closest yellow-faced man. This man was the only seventh-level Qi Condensation cultivator among the three.

"Watch out!"

The others finally realized something was amiss. The first to speak was the effeminate-looking man who had been facing inwards.

"Who's there?"

The yellow-faced man, being the closest and highest-ranked, also reacted. With a flick of his short spear, a yellow light shot out, intercepting one of the Geng Metal Sword Qis Chu Ning had unleashed. At the same time, an earthy-yellow protective barrier shimmered around his body. This earth-element defensive spell seemed effective, blocking several of Chu Ning's Geng Metal Sword Qis. However, in doing so, his body-protecting light barrier had already shattered.

When he looked up and saw Chu Ning waving his hand, instantly unleashing several spiritual arts of various colors, his expression immediately changed. He swiftly activated a talisman in his hand, causing an additional layer of spiritual power barrier to appear around his body.

Meanwhile, Old Man Sun, despite having many good items on him, was ultimately too low-ranked. Unable to sustain the fight, his protective light barrier shattered, and he was directly struck by Boss Liu's large hammer. With a crisp crunch, Old Man Sun's entire body slumped lifelessly to the ground.

"Watch out!"

At this moment, the effeminate-looking man shouted again. Along with his voice, a black light suddenly shot out from Old Man Sun's body. It flew straight forward, directly at the yellow-faced man who was fighting Chu Ning.

The yellow-faced man was fully resisting Chu Ning's attacks; after several spells, his protective barrier could no longer hold. He hadn't expected Old Man Sun to launch an attack on him. By the time the black light reached him, he reacted, but it was already too late to dodge. The black light pierced through the yellow-faced man's chest. The next moment, the man's eyes were wide with disbelief as he fell backward.

However, this yellow-faced man was truly a ruthless individual. Under such circumstances, he actually gathered all his spiritual power and fiercely threw his short spear. It flew directly towards Chu Ning. Seeing the rushing yellow light, Chu Ning did not dare to be careless. The Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman, a prepared high-grade primary defensive talisman, was activated, instantly transforming into a flowing, snowy-white light barrier protecting his body.

"Pop!"

The yellow short spear struck the snowy-white light barrier, was immediately blocked, and fell to the ground. But at the same time, under the man's desperate, dying strike, Chu Ning's Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman barrier also completely shattered.

"Second Brother!" Boss Liu roared, his eyes wide with fury, upon seeing the yellow-faced man fall.

The effeminate-looking youth, however, did not look in that direction, but instead shouted directly. "Big Brother..."

The next moment, several golden lights shot out from Chu Ning's hand, heading straight for the effeminate-looking youth. Their might made the effeminate-looking youth, a sixth-level Qi Condensation cultivator, extremely serious, so much so that he couldn't even voice his next words. What made him even more wary was that the spirit beast, whose level he didn't know, also sprayed a white light towards him. The effeminate-looking youth quickly unleashed several red lights to meet the golden sword lights. At the same time, a faint red barrier also appeared around his body.

Boss Liu finally reacted at this moment, no longer bothering with the fallen yellow-faced man. Because at the same time, he saw from the hands of the youth in green robes, multiple azure sword beams rapidly shooting towards him. Boss Liu activated a defensive talisman in his hand. But to his horror, right after the azure light, several more golden lights attacked. He saw clearly that the azure spell sword beams were the youth's spiritual arts, while the golden lights, identical to those attacking the effeminate-looking youth, were clearly talismans.

"How can this guy have so many offensive talismans?" Thinking this, Boss Liu gritted his teeth, activated an escape talisman in his hand, and charged straight towards Chu Ning. He was a body cultivator; naturally, close combat was where his power truly lay.

All of this happened in a mere instant. From Chu Ning's appearance with Ling Xiaobai, to unleashing numerous talisman attacks, and now Boss Liu forcefully charging towards Chu Ning using an escape talisman, it all transpired within just a few breaths.

Meanwhile, on the other end, all the golden lights had already reached the effeminate-looking youth. Although he unleashed multiple spiritual arts to block them, against the incredibly powerful Geng Metal Sword Talismans, these red lights were all shattered without exception. The remaining spiritual arts, along with the white spiritual art sprayed by Ling Xiaobai, all struck the effeminate-looking youth's body-protecting yellow barrier. The next moment, the yellow barrier was directly shattered. Two golden lights struck towards the effeminate-looking youth's chest. Seeing this, the youth's face paled in shock, and he instantly used an escape art to flee. Yet, he was still a step too late. The two golden lights descended, directly severing both of the youth's arms.

"Ah!" The effeminate-looking youth let out a scream, his gaze fixed on Chu Ning's direction, and he gritted his teeth, letting out a shriek: "Kill him!"

In his vision, Boss Liu, while using his escape art to dodge the golden spells, had already flashed towards the youth in green robes. He didn't know what was going on with the youth in green robes; he surprisingly didn't dodge. This filled the effeminate-looking youth with joy. Although Boss Liu was also a sixth-level Qi Condensation cultivator like him, as a body cultivator, his close-combat lethality was even higher than that of the seventh-level Qi Condensation yellow-faced man. The effeminate-looking youth endured the pain, eagerly anticipating the scene of Boss Liu hammering Chu Ning to the ground.

But the next moment, what utterly astonished him was... When Boss Liu's escape art brought him before the youth in green robes, and he swung his hammer down, a silver-white light suddenly flared in front of the youth. At the same time, a silver-white shield appeared, blocking Boss Liu's iron hammer.

"A defensive magical artifact?" The effeminate-looking youth's eyes narrowed. Knowing the power of Boss Liu's hammer strike, he quickly judged that this artifact was at least a mid-grade magical artifact. This left him inexplicably astonished; he truly couldn't fathom it. How could this youth in green robes possess more talismans and treasures than Old Man Sun, constantly bringing out new ones? But just now, when dealing with Old Man Sun, it was three against one. Now, it was Boss Liu against the opponent in a one-on-one fight. This made the effeminate-looking youth worry for Boss Liu.

And at this moment, Boss Liu was equally inwardly shocked. When he saw Chu Ning didn't dodge, his heart was initially filled with wild joy. But now, after his full-force hammer strike was directly blocked by the opponent, Boss Liu suddenly felt a sense of dread. He immediately intended to use his escape art to retreat. He hadn't forgotten that the spiritual arts and several talismans the opponent had just unleashed were all locked onto him.

However, how could Chu Ning give him another chance? At this very moment, a fist blasted out from behind the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield. Body cultivator? Who wasn't?

"Thud!"

Chu Ning's fist heavily struck Boss Liu's body. Accompanied by a dull thud, Boss Liu's body directly fell backward. At the same time, there was a faint cracking sound. It was the sound of bones shattering.

"A body cultivator?" Seeing this, the effeminate-looking youth's face contorted in horror, and he immediately turned and rushed towards the cave entrance. He didn't know what kind of monster they had run into. This youth clearly seemed to be at the fourth-level Qi Condensation, yet he had numerous talismans and even a defensive magical artifact – that was one thing. But the crucial point was that this person was also a body cultivator. Boss Liu, who had the strongest actual combat strength among the three, was actually killed by a single punch in an instant.

Flee! Flee quickly! This was the only thought in the effeminate-looking youth's mind at this moment. But at the same time, he saw that with just a raise of the youth's hand, an azure sword-shaped spiritual art shot directly towards him. Its speed was so great, as if it required no preparation at all. The effeminate-looking youth had to stop. He knew that if he didn't block this spiritual art, he would be pierced by the azure light.

However, during the previous battle with Old Man Sun and in the process of dealing with Chu Ning's numerous Geng Metal Sword Talismans, his talismans had long been exhausted. At this moment, he could only rely on his body-protecting spiritual art to forcibly receive the attack. Spiritual power circulated, and a faint crimson light appeared around the effeminate-looking youth's body. However, as soon as this crimson light came into contact with Chu Ning's azure light, its color rapidly faded. At the same time, the azure light intensified greatly.

Azurewood Sword Art!

Chu Ning watched this scene from a distance, his eyes gleaming slightly. If a defensive barrier couldn't completely block a sword beam and cause it to dissipate immediately, then that barrier would merely serve as nourishment for the sword beam. Indeed, under this ebb and flow, in just two breaths, the faint crimson light completely vanished. And the greatly intensified azure sword beam struck the effeminate-looking youth's body, amidst his despairing gaze.

"You... who are you?" Carrying endless questions, the effeminate-looking youth collapsed heavily to the ground.

Watching the last person fall to the ground, Chu Ning finally let out a slow breath. Today's situation was truly quite dangerous. If he wasn't mistaken, the more meticulous effeminate-looking youth should have discovered him long ago. Chu Ning's divine sense perception showed that this person had been carefully observing his surroundings after entering the cave. As for how the opponent had detected his presence, that remained unknown. But clearly, the opponent must have sensed something, which was why he immediately acted against Old Man Sun without hesitation. Moreover, he was able to react so swiftly after Chu Ning launched his attack.

"Fighting multiple opponents alone is still too dangerous, especially when your own cultivation level doesn't hold an advantage. Next time, I need to prepare more life-saving items." Chu Ning muttered to himself as he squatted down and began searching Boss Liu's body.
