# Chapter 206: Galloping All the Way

Xu Yunfan’s玄钢 (Xuan Steel) physique suffered its first dent, the bone of his left shoulder emitting a grating friction sound.

In the next instant, the muscles around the struck area convulsed and trembled as if electrocuted, instantly dispersing the force erupting from the heavy mace throughout his entire body and into the ground.

*Bang!*

The stone beneath his feet cracked instantly, yet the heavy mace was rebounded by a counter-shaking force.

Shi Ze only felt his arm being violently flung upward by a force.

"You've actually cultivated the Hundred-Forge Xuan Steel Body to such a realm. Have your weak points been completely tempered away?"

At the Flesh Refining Realm, strength permeates the flesh and blood, leaving no weaknesses around the body.

Xu Yunfan’s expression was icy. He steadied the玄钢机匣 (Xuan Steel mechanism box) containing the Ginseng Child that had slid to his lower back. Forged from Xuan Steel and meteoric iron, even a Treasure Artifact could withstand a few blows from it.

"That strike of yours hurt a little."

But he showed not a trace of fear, his eyes filled only with excitement. Vital energy circulated through his entire body, and crimson patterns flowed like magma beneath his skin, finally climbing up his spine to his arms, causing his muscles to bulge and swell.

He had finally waited for a strong enemy capable of putting up a real fight.

Xu Yunfan’s shoulder and back muscle groups exploded with power. Under the activation of the Hundred-Forge Xuan Steel Body, the crimson energy of the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Art flowed beneath his skin like magma patterns, shooting from his spine toward his arms.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer tore through the air with a foul wind; the red patterns on the hammerhead burned a dark red under the centrifugal force. As the three-hundred-plus-jin hammer fell, his right shoulder blade actually shifted three inches horizontally, diverting the rebounding force into his waist and hips.

"Bring it on!"

Shi Ze’s eyes were like bronze bells, his body’s sinews bulging violently. The heavy mace swept upward from below, the muscles and sinews of his entire body turning somewhat black under the surging of his vital energy.

At the instant the two iron-blooded forces exploded into sparks, Xu Yunfan’s foot arches and fascia turned over like a subterranean dragon; his heel ground the blue bricks to dust to dissipate the residual force into the ground. His left arm, wrapped in the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Art, gripped the hammer handle, and the second hammer slashed toward the opponent's ribs along the body of the mace.

A mournful cry of metal rang out as the heavy mace returned to defense; the immense force made Shi Ze’s eyeballs tremble, and his tiger’s mouth went numb.

"Treasure Artifact!?"

Xu Yunfan grinned, saying nothing, merely exerting force and unleashing the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer’s energy.

Amidst the cracking sounds of bones within Shi Ze’s body, he sank his waist and turned his hips, the tail of the mace stabbing straight toward Xu Yunfan’s Tanzhong vital point.

Xu Yunfan’s pectoral muscles suddenly knotted into blocks; as he硬吃 (hardly took) this fatal blow, his steel skin actually emitted a bell-like chime. He used the momentum to spin his body, swinging the third hammer in a semicircle.

Before the hammer shadow arrived, the mace tip had already劈开 (split) the hammer wind to strike the throat.

As their weapons twisted together, seven bursts of sparks erupted.

Xu Yunfan’s latissimus dorsi muscles split like the earth's crust; the displaced shoulder blade amplified the hammer force a second time.

Shi Ze’s ankles sank three inches deep into the bricks and stones; the heavy mace’s three-layered wave force penetrated the hammer body layer by layer.

The blue stone ground cracked like a spider web; sweat beads at the point of impact between hammer and mace steamed into white mist.

Both wielded heavy weapons and followed a violent path. Although the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method contained the meaning of "The Proud Dragon Repents," under the dual activation of the Hundred-Forge Xuan Steel Body and the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Art, in terms of sheer violence, it had never lost to any heavy weapon.

At the fifty-fourth collision, every time their moves met, both bodies shook.

In yet another collision, the sound of metal clashing echoed through the mountains, deafening and shocking.

"You... you are truly at the Flesh Refining Realm?!"

Shi Ze gasped for breath. He was now at the Small Success stage of Blood Transformation, his strength可谓 (can be said to be) a rebirth, far exceeding the limits of a normal person. His blood flowed like mercury浆 (slurry) inside him, and his vital energy was as heavy as a mountain.

Yet before Xu Yunfan, he seemed to fall short by a margin.

"Of course."

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained unchanged. The pure Yang internal energy within him was still continuously converting into vital energy, replenishing his consumed strength. Even his breathing rhythm was much longer than Shi Ze's.

The heavy hammer in his hand moved suddenly.

Shi Ze’s mixed copper mace suddenly flew from his hand. This expert of the Luo Net惊恐地 (terrifyingly) discovered that the strength of his Blood Transformation Realm had been反震 (rebounded), causing his vital energy and blood to逆乱 (reverse), rendering him unable to exert strength.

Meanwhile, the opponent's immense blood energy, on the contrary, grew increasingly intense like a furnace amidst the battle.

A ten-zhang deep pit exploded in the mountains.

When Xu Yunfan walked onto the bank holding the broken half of the mixed copper mace, behind him lay Shi Ze buried in earth and stones.

*‘You have successfully killed a strong enemy. Your proficiency in the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method has increased.’*

He glanced at the system prompt in his vision.

Four points of proficiency. Not bad.

For the next three days, Xu Yunfan galloped all the way. Wherever he passed, there was almost no opponent who could withstand a single exchange, moving as if there were no one in his path.

It wasn't that no one tried to capture him. There were at least three Great乾 (Great Qian) True Blood generals, comparable to the Blood Transformation Realm, frantically pursuing him, but unfortunately, they were always a step behind every time.

Until he approached the Divine Weapon Ridge in Qingzhou, on the supply road used by the Great Qian—a path carved out of the mountain body.

The thick, gloomy clouds in the sky suddenly exploded with a few muffled thunders, followed by a drizzle.

Xu Yunfan’s Xuan Steel war boots crushed over a ground of broken arrows; the blood and mud stuck to the soles dragged dark trails on the blue stones.

He hooked the bronze trigger of the last crossbow机 (crossbow mechanism) with his backhand, his index finger joint precisely卡进 (stuck into) the mortise and tenon gap.

With a *click*, the three-strength crossbow arm was snapped by his finger force into a right angle.

This was a supply team the Great Qian was sending to Yanbei City, which he slaughtered casually. He released the local conscripted drivers and laborers, but not a single Great Qian soldier was spared.

The setting sun dragged a blood-red long shadow behind Xu Yunfan.

Three hundred grain carts lay askew beside the road; the steaming scent of new wheat mixed with the thick smell of iron rust, startling even the night owls so they dared not land.

When the last斩马刀 (horse-chopping saber) snapped, he specifically used the hammer's back to smash that deputy general into a salt transport cart. The coarse salt grains pickled for three years embedding into the wound was a fate比 (better than) a thousand cuts.

That old dog had a girl he had掳ed (abducted) while riding, playing with her on his horse, and the surrounding soldiers were laughing continuously. This left Xu Yunfan with no thought of showing mercy.

"Beast..."

Watching the deputy general wail amidst the coarse salt, Xu Yunfan spat. Although he had seen the香火教 (Incense Fire Sect)'s crueler methods in Wuzhou, he still found it hard to accept now.

Where the torches flickered, the old driver crouched under the ox cart suddenly heard the sound of a chain breaking.

The破甲锥 (armor-piercing cone) at the end of the heavy hammer handle tore through the rain curtain, but merely gently pried open the iron ring around his neck.

"Take the grain seeds and go south."

Xu Yunfan甩去 (flung off) the brain matter on the hammer face and kicked open a half-bag of millet that wasn't stained with blood. "If you encounter a checkpoint with a red-tailed flag, say that Su Zhenhe of the Xuanzhen Gate sent you to seek life."

Some Great Zhou armies were still desperately守卫 (guarding) certain strategic passes.

Unfortunately... there were no supporting armies behind them. If the Great Qian hadn't gathered the vast majority of their forces around Yanbei City and the three provinces of the Nine Shine Sect, they wouldn't have allowed Xu Yunfan to run rampant like this.

Twenty paces away, a soldier pretending to be dead had just touched the crossbow mechanism.

As the sound of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer tearing through the air rang out, three poison-dipped bolts were already jumping with寒光 (cold light) on the string.

Xu Yunfan’s war boot crushed the man's throat bone just as the hammer head caught the falling trigger mechanism parts.

He caught them and looked; the sight alignment catch and trigger mechanism were made of fine steel, with assembly-line workmanship.

Rough and shoddy.

Xu Yunfan tossed it away casually, judging the military hierarchy within the Great Qian in his heart.

By the time the third watch sounded, only the blood sludge积淤 (accumulated) in the wheel ruts on the road was still squirming. The twenty-seven severed military flags soaking in it had long turned the金线苍狼 (gold-threaded blue wolves) embroidered on them into赤眼恶鬼 (red-eyed evil ghosts).
