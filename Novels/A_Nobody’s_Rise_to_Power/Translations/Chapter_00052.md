# Chapter 52: Holding the Weights and Grasping the Abacus

Zhang Yunyi had decided to go to Phoenix Mountain Manor to speak ill of Yang Can. At that moment, Yang Can was leisurely staying in the guest quarters.

These past few days, he had been working hard from dawn to dusk to develop the curved-plow. Now that he had achieved great success, it was not too much to reward himself.

"Manager Yang... I heard that someone has caught wind of it and wants to steal the design of your new plow. What should we do?" Qing Mei walked in quickly, holding two plates of fruit in her hands.

Ever since she returned to the mountain and received Suo Chanzhi's "imperial decree," Qing Mei's last knot in her heart had been untied. Now, her attitude and feelings toward Yang Can were vastly different.

Two plates of fruit, one with毛 cherries and one with mulberries. Both were seasonal fresh fruits, washed with well water until they looked juicy and refreshing, placed in front of Yang Can.

Qing Mei was very angry at the people who had rushed over upon hearing the news to steal the manufacturing method of the new plow.

*That belongs to my family!*

Yang Can smiled and said, "This kind of farm tool isn't a mystery. It didn't exist before simply because no one thought of it, not because it couldn't be made. Now that it's right there in the fields, any skilled craftsman who takes a good look will figure out how to forge it. Of course, it can't be kept secret."

Qing Mei said unwillingly, "Then what should we do? Are we just going to let others benefit from it for free?"

"Where in this world can you get benefits for free?" Yang Can smiled. "Among the Eight Great Clans of Longshang, the Yu family possesses the most arable land. If everyone has the same farming tool, the Yu family's advantage remains unchanged. As for the two great empires in the Central Plains, hehe..."

Yang Can raised his eyebrows. "Which of the two countries benefits more has nothing to do with me."

Qing Mei thought about it. There really was no way to stop it. She could only listlessly pick up a mulberry and toss it into her mouth. The sweet taste quickly seeped into her heart and lungs, dyeing her crystal-clear lips a light purple.

Yang Can said, "And even if it spreads to the Central Plains, it will still be called the 'Yang Can Plow.' Although I haven't gone to the Central Plains myself, my name is already known there. Doesn't this bring me any benefit?"

Hearing this, Qing Mei became happy again. She cheerfully picked up a mulberry and fed it to Yang Can as a reward. "Alright then... with this great contribution, is it enough for you to secure your footing in the Yu family? Do we still need to deal with that surnamed Zhang?"

"That's a separate matter," Yang Can waved his hand. "By promoting the new plow and spreading my name, I will be even more confident in dealing with Zhang Yunyi. As for how to proceed..."

Yang Can paused, then suddenly, like the old stepmother of the Golden Horn King in *Journey to the West*, he drawled, "Where has our Accountant Li gotten to with his auditing?"

Li Damu was still diligently "auditing the accounts." He strictly forbade others from disturbing him while auditing, and everyone knew this rule. So, right now, outside the accounting room, it was completely quiet, for fear of annoying this "Imperial Emissary."

On the wide desk in the accounting room, many account books were piled up messily. On the nearby three-legged high table, tea and dried fruits and candied preserves were placed. Against the wall, there was a wide armchair, the soft cushion of which had been pushed onto the back of the chair.

The petite Miss Tan was currently curled up naked in the large armchair. Right now, she was like the account books on the desk—completely disheveled. Her soft, fragmented murmurs were like the flowing water in the courtyard's active pool, gurgling and murmuring.

"Mr. Li, not here... If someone sees us, I'll die of shame..."

"Don't worry, this is Mr. Li's confidential place for auditing. Without being summoned, who dares to come in?" Li Damu looked around with an air of heroic arrogance.

"Mr. Li, Manager Yang requests your presence."

A strong voice suddenly came from the courtyard. Li Damu was startled. The accounting room immediately became a scene of chaos...

In the time it took to drink a cup of tea, Li Damu walked out, fully dressed and proper. A flush of unnatural color was on his face.

"Cough! Manager... Manager Yang, is there something you need?" Accountant Li asked the Suo family guard who had come to deliver the message, slightly out of breath.

The rules he had established here meant nothing to the personal guard of the young mistress.

"Yes, Mr. Li, please come with me."

The guard looked at Li Damu with some confusion but didn't suspect that his auditing had left him both excited and exhausted. Li Damu licked his dry lips and looked back. Xiao Tan, holding her clothes and naked, peeked out from behind the door, looked at him, and then closed the door. Only then did Li Damu follow the guard away with peace of mind.

When Li Damu arrived at Yang Can's residence, he found Zhang Yunyi, Qing Mei, and the Eldest Young Master of the Zhang family all there.

As soon as Zhang Yunyi saw Li Damu arrive, he smiled and said, "Mr. Li is here too. I was just about to send someone to inform you."

Li Damu quickly glanced at Yang Can and pretended to be calm. "I wonder what instructions the Manor Lord has?"

Zhang Yunyi said with a smile, "I have just finished speaking with Manager Yang. The spring plowing at Feng'an Manor is proceeding very smoothly, especially with the new plow developed by Mr. Yang. I, Zhang, plan to go to Phoenix Mountain Manor to report the situation to the Clan Lord. This trip will take at most two days. During the time I am away from the manor, if Manager Yang, Mr. Li, and Miss Qing Mei have any matters, my son can handle them."

The Eldest Young Master Zhang bowed to Yang Can and the others. "If the three of you have any instructions, please feel free to give them."

Yang Can smiled and said, "I have been busy developing the new plow these past few days and am a bit tired. I am planning to rest for a couple of days. It's fine, Manor Lord, please go ahead and handle your affairs."

Zhang Yunyi smiled at Yang Can, cupped his hands, and said, "In that case, I will take my leave."

As Zhang Yunyi turned, he gave Li Damu a meaningful glance. Mr. Li knew this was Zhang Yunyi asking him to take good care of things.

Originally, for a young woman of such beauty to actively throw herself into the arms of an old man like him, he naturally had to pay a price. He knew this from the start. When lust is in front, it's hard to control oneself.

Now that Manager Yang had just invented the curved-plow and was at the height of his satisfaction, he probably just called him over to ask about the progress of the audit? Li Damu comforted himself with this thought, thinking that when Manager Yang asked, he could just gloss over it with some minor, insignificant issues.

This was Zhang Yunyi's home, and Yang Can and the other two were guests. Naturally, there was no reason for the guests to see the host all the way to the main gate. So, the three of them only saw the Zhang father and son off to the entrance of the small courtyard. As they watched the father and son leave, the smile on Yang Can's face instantly dropped.

"Let's go, let's go back. I have something to say to Mr. Li." With that, Yang Can turned and left first.

Seeing the change in his expression, Li Damu couldn't help but feel nervous.

The three of them returned to the main hall. Li Damu sat down carefully and said with a flattering smile, "Manager, did you call me over for instructions?"

Before Yang Can could answer, Qing Mei couldn't wait to say, "Zhang Yunyi is about to leave the manor. Should I go make the arrangements?"

Yang Can nodded. "Don't harm his life. Make sure to bring him back in one piece."

"Rest assured, I will handle this personally." Qing Mei gave Yang Can a proud smile, her chin held high. In front of Yang Can, she had finally found where she was stronger than him. Compared to this weak chicken, *I* am very capable in combat.

Qing Mei flew out like a butterfly. Li Damu, on the side, suddenly changed color. From the sound of their conversation, they were going to make a move on Zhang Yunyi?

Yang Can didn't allow him time to think, saying with a smile, "Mr. Li?"

"Ah? Your subordinate is here."

"Hehe, as long as it's a willing exchange between a man and a woman, I can't be bothered to care about your little affairs."

"Ah? What? Manager, are you saying..." Li Damu stammered, his old face already flushed red.

Yang Can didn't continue this topic. Instead, he asked, "You've been reviewing Feng'an Manor's accounts these days. Have you found anything?"

"Um..." Li Damu hesitated, wanting to say the minor findings he had prepared in advance to get by.

Yang Can stared at Li Damu's somewhat evasive eyes and said word by word, "Just say whatever comes to mind. For example, last autumn, that batch of 3,400 *dan* of grain at Feng'an Manor that vanished compared to the actual harvest?"

*Thump!*

Accountant Li executed a "sliding kowtow," transitioning from sitting on the chair to kneeling on the ground. He smoothly pulled a notebook from his sleeve and presented it with utmost respect.

"Manager Yang, this is what your subordinate has found during the audit these days. Please review it, Manager!"

What a joke! Manager Yang had not only mentioned the time but also the exact number. If he didn't kneel now, when would he?

*Ah, Manor Lord Zhang, it's not that I don't want to help you, but Manager Yang is as cunning as a ghost. Brother, we'd better each fend for ourselves!*

Li Damu's reaction was so swift that it startled Yang Can as well. He had deliberately let Li Damu see Qing Mei go capture Zhang Yunyi, and he had deliberately mentioned an accounting loophole, all to shatter Li Damu's illusions. But Li Damu didn't even go through the simplest struggle and just knelt down so grandly...

This... is a talent!

Yang Can couldn't help but marvel.

Truth be told, there is no shortage of talent in this world. How many civil officials and military generals did Liu Bang command? And how many came from just Pei County? What were their original identities? Fan Kuai, a butcher. Zhou Bo, a bamboo weaver and funeral musician. Xiahou Ying, a groom. Xiao He, a clerk. Ren Ao, a prison warden...

Were the geomantic omens for emperors and generals all concentrated in Pei County? Of course not. As long as one is given sufficient opportunity and room to grow, many small figures have the potential to become ministers of a prosperous era. It's just that most people in this world never get that chance.

If Yang Can hadn't encountered Yu Chengye, who was struck by a poisoned arrow, he would still be herding cattle right now. Where would he have the chance to show his true abilities? Playing the lute to a cow?

So, it was not surprising that Li Damu could make such a decisive choice.

Yang Can carefully read through the notebook presented by Accountant Li, a smile appearing on his face. The accounts were very clear, and it seemed he had been well-prepared.

Yang Can closed the notebook and thought for a moment. "Li Damu."

Accountant Li was still kneeling there. Upon hearing this, he hurriedly bowed his head. "Your subordinate is here."

Yang Can said, "The direct handlers of these accounts are not Zhang Yunyi himself." He handed the notebook back. "So, take this back and sort it out again."

Li Damu asked in confusion, "What does Manager want your subordinate to... sort out?"

Yang Can said, "Sort out the people involved in these charges. List them one by one in order of their closeness to Zhang Yunyi and their status!"
