# Chapter 7: Cleansing Technique

Gu Mo had chosen an unranked minor spell called the Cleansing Technique.

This was undoubtedly the most practical minor spell for low-level cultivators. A daily casting would ensure cleanliness and freshness throughout the day.

As Gu Mo carefully studied the incantation for the Cleansing Technique, he gradually discerned its underlying principle—it achieved its cleaning effect through spiritual energy vibrations.

This bore striking similarities to the ultrasonic cleaning methods he knew from his previous world. Once he grasped the principle, Gu Mo quickly mastered the basics of the technique. In the cultivation world, this would be considered high comprehension.

However, Gu Mo's "comprehension" stemmed from knowledge of another world. Though the source differed, the outcome was the same. Combined with his precise control over spiritual energy, it wasn't long before Gu Mo successfully cast the Cleansing Technique. His speed of mastery could rival that of top-tier geniuses.

Unfortunately, the library was empty, so no one witnessed Gu Mo's impressive comprehension. Then again, it was precisely because the library was deserted that Gu Mo felt comfortable practicing there. Otherwise, he would have returned to his room to test the spell.

Gu Mo hadn't forgotten that someone wanted him dead. The culprit hadn't shown themselves yet, so until the mastermind was uncovered, Gu Mo had to maintain a low profile.

As a talentless, backgroundless outer disciple, it was hard to imagine anyone specifically targeting him. Gu Mo concluded he was likely just an unfortunate bystander caught in someone else's scheme.

By keeping a low profile, the perpetrator might even forget about a small fry like him. With the Sunflower in his possession, given enough time, Gu Mo could steadily grow stronger. Once he did, he wouldn't need to fear the hidden enemy anymore.

After mastering the basics of the Cleansing Technique, Gu Mo left the library and returned to his hut. Over the next week, he devoted all his time to practicing the spell. Spells could be divided into four stages: Novice, Proficient, Mastery, and Perfection.

The level of proficiency greatly affected a spell's effectiveness. Take the Cleansing Technique for example—at the Novice stage, it could only perform basic cleaning. At Proficient, it became thorough cleaning. At Mastery, it provided cleaning plus maintenance. As for Perfection, Gu Mo hadn't reached that stage yet and couldn't comment.

In just one week, Gu Mo had advanced this unranked minor spell to Mastery level. Though it was the simplest of spells, reaching Mastery in such a short time was still astonishing. The main reason for this rapid progress was Gu Mo's understanding of the technique's underlying principle. He continuously adjusted the frequency of his spiritual energy vibrations to achieve optimal cleaning effects.

Now, when Gu Mo cast the Mastery-level Cleansing Technique, not only did it leave him spotless and refreshed, the vibrating spiritual energy also gave his entire body a massage, making his skin noticeably smoother.

If he continued practicing and reached Perfection, Gu Mo suspected the Cleansing Technique might undergo a qualitative transformation. However, achieving Perfection wouldn't be easy. For most people, reaching Mastery was essentially the ceiling.

Even for Gu Mo, who fully understood the technique's principles, reaching Perfection would likely take considerable time. Fortunately, time was one thing Gu Mo had plenty of at the moment.

Glancing at the time, Gu Mo headed out. Today was the scheduled gathering for their group. The meeting place was the same private dining room as before, but this time, Gu Mo was the first to arrive.

After waiting quietly for a while, Yao Shifeng, Hu Hai, and Wu Jinfei arrived one after another. Seeing their current states, Gu Mo was slightly taken aback.

All three looked somewhat disheveled. In contrast, Gu Mo, who had cast the Cleansing Technique on himself before coming, appeared refined and graceful, with an air of "immortal elegance."

"Gu Mo, you actually took time to groom yourself?" Wu Jinfei couldn't help but remark after giving Gu Mo a once-over.

They had spent every moment of the past week cultivating. Forget grooming—they had even skipped meals in favor of fasting pills.

"It's just the effect of the Cleansing Technique," Gu Mo replied with a smile.

His answer left Wu Jinfei momentarily speechless. He couldn't understand why anyone would waste time practicing a useless spell like the Cleansing Technique instead of focusing on improving their cultivation.

Moreover, Gu Mo had managed to learn it in such a short time—his speed was impressive. What Wu Jinfei and the others didn't realize was that Gu Mo hadn't just reached Novice level; he had achieved Mastery.

"Gu Mo, you've learned the Cleansing Technique? Could we exchange pointers later?" A voice tinged with pleasant surprise interrupted.

The speaker was Chu Feifei, who had just arrived. As the only female in their group, she had clearly taken care with her appearance. From her question, it was evident she had also been practicing the Cleansing Technique.

Unlike the unkempt Yao Shifeng and the others, Chu Feifei refused to appear disheveled. For female cultivators like her, convenient spells like the Cleansing Technique were just as important as cultivation itself.

However, despite studying it extensively, Chu Feifei still hadn't mastered the basics. Hearing that Gu Mo had succeeded naturally delighted her.

"Of course!" Gu Mo nodded. Wasn't the whole point of their gatherings to share cultivation insights?

As soon as he spoke, Gu Mo noticed two envious gazes. As the only female in their group, Chu Feifei was quite popular. That said, there was no petty jealousy—everyone understood that on the path of cultivation, strength was paramount. With sufficient power, everything else would follow.

"Ahem!"

Seeing that everyone had arrived, Yao Shifeng, who had remained silent until now, cleared his throat to draw their attention. Then, he dropped a bombshell.

Two days ago, someone had successfully reached the Qi Refining stage.

"What?!"

The news left all four listeners, including Gu Mo, stunned. How could someone have advanced so quickly? Even with daily refinement of solar essence and talent comparable to a low-grade spiritual root, Gu Mo estimated it would take him at least three months to reach Qi Refining.

Yet in less than a month, someone had already broken through—this was cultivation speed on par with a mid-grade spiritual root.

Unless there had been an error during the spiritual root assessment, this individual must have encountered some extraordinary opportunity.

"The information is confirmed. His name is Fan Shaoming. During the assessment, the jade stone glowed even brighter for him than it did for me," Yao Shifeng said, his expression grave.

Fan Shaoming's achievement had disrupted Yao Shifeng's plans. Originally, Yao Shifeng had aimed to be the first to reach Qi Refining. Now that title had been snatched away—and by such a wide margin.

With his plans upended, Yao Shifeng grew anxious. If he couldn't claim first place, second would have to suffice. To that end, he decided to advance his original schedule.

Drawing a deep breath, Yao Shifeng scanned the four still-reeling faces before him. "Everyone," he said solemnly, "I need your help."
