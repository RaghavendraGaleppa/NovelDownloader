# Chapter 77: Chaos Emperor Python

“Blaze Burst? This skill is pretty good. It deducts health based on a percentage. Zhou Tian remembered that he had a skill that also deducted health by percentage at the very beginning. That skill seemed to deduct 10% of health, while this [Blaze Burst] only deducts 5%. However, [Blaze Burst] can be stacked on the same target, whereas that other skill couldn’t. But [Blaze Burst] can also be dodged. Each has its own merits.”

Zhou Tian’s eyes darted back and forth between the three skills, ultimately focusing on [Blaze Burst]. Golden light solidified, and the information about [Blaze Burst] appeared in his mind.

His test subject remained the same old bedside wooden table. With a wave of Zhou Tian’s hand, a fist-sized orange flame appeared out of thin air in the void. A wave of heat surged through the room, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead.

Feeling the rising temperature in the room, Zhou Tian selected the wooden table in front of him as his target.

Whoosh!

The fireball floating in the void flew towards the table, its speed neither fast nor slow.

Boom!

The moment the fireball touched the table, it ignited into flames. But strangely, though the flames appeared vigorous, they only burned a small area.

Zhou Tian watched as the burning spot turned charred black, then crumbled into ash.

Ugh… how should he put it? Zhou Tian felt this skill was just okay. While deducting health by percentage seemed incredibly powerful, making it sound like 20 fireballs could instantly kill someone, it wasn't that simple in reality.

Zhou Tian’s math wasn't taught by his physical education teacher. Even ten thousand fireballs hitting a person wouldn't kill them. The reason was precisely this percentage-based health deduction. The skill’s power lay in this characteristic, but it was also its downfall. Even if someone only had one percent of their health left, this fireball would only deduct five percent of that one percent.

Nevertheless, it was still an offensive skill, and it was a little better than the other two.

It had now leveled up to the third stage. The next upgrade would require eight deaths, so it wouldn't be leveling up anytime soon. He would still have to pin his hopes on the Land of the Forsaken Gods.

Having completed this long-prepared task, Zhou Tian let out a sigh of relief, lay down on his bed, and fell into a deep sleep.

In the ancient bronze hall at the center of Heaven Pass, divine lights danced. In the middle stood a bronze round table, upon which floated an exquisite and transparent crystal, with swirling wisps of cloud qi.

Around the table were precisely eight bronze chairs, no more, no less. At this moment, only the chair to the right of the crystal was occupied by a single figure. Dressed in a grey Daoist robe, with white beard and brows, his complexion was as ruddy as a youth's, and his eyes seemed to contain nine layers of celestial locks as he stared at the crystal before him.

Within the crystal, countless runes floated. Suddenly, a portion of the runes glowed with golden light, forming a symbol. The Daoist frowned, and with a flip of his hand, a fragmented rune disc appeared in his palm. Points of divine light illuminated it.

In an instant, the seven other previously empty bronze chairs were suddenly occupied by figures, their auras as magnificent as the great sun, like ancient deities.

“Mingzhen, for what reason have you summoned us?” the figure seated in the south, enveloped in Buddhist light, spoke.

“Heaven Pass detected an anomaly. We need to activate the probing formation,” the first Daoist replied.

“Understood.”

The figure enshrouded in Buddhist light extended his hand and produced a rune disc. It was merely to probe the situation with Heaven Pass’s array, so there was no need to hesitate.

The others also followed suit. The eight fragmented rune discs combined, their divine light piercing the sky, runes swirling. The crystal on the bronze round table seemed to have been infused with divine energy, as countless runes surged forth. The entire bronze hall lit up, and streaks of formation patterns emerged, extending into the void.

The eight figures simultaneously poured energy into the crystal, and the complex combination of runes within it regenerated.

Boom!

An unimaginable scene appeared in the crystal: in the endless Void Storms, a gigantic python was actually swimming. Its size was indescribable; its scales were jet black, and the Void Storms, strong enough to tear apart even Saints, left not a single mark on its scales. It possessed soul-devouring eyes, and its forked tongue occasionally flicked out, shattering a section of space and making the nearby Void Storms even more intense.

“A Chaos Emperor Python!” the Wenhou seated in the north frowned. This was one of the few remaining fierce beast kings in this Void Storm region, bearing the bloodline of a Lord-level fierce beast from the Void Star Realm. It was immensely powerful, even among King-level fierce beasts. They had searched for it for a long time but never found it. He never expected it to appear now.

“This…”

The bronze hall was brightly lit as the eight Guardians discussed late into the night.

Early the next morning, Zhou Tian received news: the departure time had been moved up to today.

“Weren't we supposed to leave tomorrow? Why the sudden change?” Zhou Tian asked Zhou Ying, who was leading the way. The entire group followed behind him, heading towards the departure point.

“Heaven Pass detected a huge energy body moving in the Void Storms outside the Land of the Forsaken Gods. It’s suspected to be a Void Beast. If we delayed any longer, we might encounter it, which would be very troublesome. So, we had to move up the schedule,” Zhou Ying explained without turning her head.

“Void Beasts? Weren’t they cleared out by the combined forces of the Eight Provinces?” Zhang Yi frowned and asked. He had read records in ancient archives stating that in the beginning, Void Beasts ran rampant in the Void Storms outside the Land of the Forsaken Gods. Coupled with the inherent danger of the Void Storms, it was practically a place of certain death.

Later, the combined forces of the Eight Provinces dispatched their strongest experts, spending a long time almost completely annihilating the fierce beasts, clearing a path through the Void Storms.

“Back then, over 90% of the fierce beasts were killed, but there were still some who slipped through the net. Some of the kings among the fierce beasts had deep foundations and powerful divine abilities. They also knew how to avoid danger and seek fortune. Some were even no weaker than the top experts of the Eight Provinces. Since they were intent on hiding, they were difficult to find, and eventually, the matter was left unresolved.”

“However, they also feared the Eight Provinces uniting again to hunt them down, so although there have been more reports of their sightings in recent years, there have been no signs of them harming anyone. The Eight Provinces have therefore tolerated their existence, as gathering the manpower for another encirclement and suppression would incur a huge cost,” Zhou Ying recounted.

Everyone present showed understanding.

Zhou Ying led them towards the city gate of Heaven Pass.

Outside the city gate of Heaven Pass, a wide road extended for a long distance, with various types of transport vehicles parked on both sides, resembling a port.

There were the black sailing ships they had seen outside Heaven Pass on the day they arrived. These were just one type, offering high risk and high reward. Each trip by such Void Ferrymen brought in thousands of Divine Crystals, but the danger was also extremely high.

The major powers of the Eight Provinces naturally used the best ancient ships. At the end of the road, seven ancient, colossal ships floated in the void.

Although their styles differed slightly, their general appearance was similar: nearly a hundred *zhang* tall and almost a thousand *zhang* long. Made of unknown materials, they were entirely black, with esoteric symbols carved in silver patterns along their sides.

Each ship had three masts, and the sails on the masts were no ordinary items. They were made of beast hide, remarkably adorned with golden scales and shrouded in layers of mysterious runes.
