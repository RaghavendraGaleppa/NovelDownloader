# Chapter 256: Inside the Palace

Xu Yunfan paid no heed. Instead, he took a step forward, slamming both palms against the gate.

His newly broken-through Marrow Cleansing realm cultivation erupted fully. The force generated from his bone marrow surged, the muscles on his back bulging in layers like diamond patterns. The force rapidly channeled to his arms; his golden marrow trembled slightly, emitting a sound like jade and gold, resonating with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. A faint golden membrane formed over his palms.

With a muffled grunt from Xu Yunfan, the scales of his Dragon Scale Armor rippled like waves. Under the explosive force, the scales on his wrists instantly stood on end, harmonizing with the force. A tremendous, indomitable power erupted abruptly.

The five ancient characters on the lintel blazed with golden light, transforming into five tangible rays of pure light that swept toward him.

Xu Yunfan neither dodged nor avoided. The muscles on his back rippled, and the Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel was thrust out to collide with the rays. The heavy cudgel trembled incessantly, its surface wreathed in crimson flames and blue lightning.

"Boom!"

Amidst the deafening collision, Xu Yunfan was knocked back more than ten steps, a trickle of blood seeping from the corner of his mouth.

But the fighting spirit in his eyes burned even more fiercely. The scales on his Dragon Scale Armor all stood up, greedily absorbing the wandering spiritual energy of heaven and earth in the air.

Su Zhenhe was dumbfounded. He had never imagined anyone could clash head-on with the White Jade Pure Light.

"Again!"

Xu Yunfan spat out a mouthful of blood. The Crimson Flood Dragon force rapidly retreated, and immediately, the Three Jiao Sword Nourishing Art within him ran wildly, the accumulated sword force bursting forth abruptly.

Just as he prepared to charge a second time, the palace gates suddenly made a "click" sound, slowly opening a crack.

A stale, rotten scent rushed out instantly, mixed with a certain ancient, vicissitudinous aura, making Xu Yunfan involuntarily hold his breath. His heart relaxed slightly.

If the White Jade Palace gates had opened to reveal spiritual energy a hundred times denser than the outside world, he would have turned and left without a word.

In such an environment, it wouldn't be surprising for anything to breed.

Su Zhenhe sucked in a cold breath. "How... how is this possible? The ancient texts clearly stated..."

Xu Yunfan understood. "It seems it couldn't hold on."

After two thousand years, the White Jade Palace could not withstand the erosion of time and was gradually decaying. No wonder Zhou Tianyan and the others could enter relying only on a single divine weapon.

Glancing at the Nine Burning Blade fallen on the ground, Xu Yunfan slowly picked it up.

*Crack!*

A harsh shattering sound exploded. The dark red fire patterns on the blade writhed as if alive, then spiderwebbed cracks burst forth from the middle of the edge.

The nine patterns on the blade spine, symbolizing "Burning the Heavens," dimmed one after another, as if their essence was being drained by an invisible force.

When the blade fragments fell, they actually emitted a mournful cry of metal and stone, turning into red powder upon hitting the ground, burning into a final wisp of green smoke in the wind.

Xu Yunfan casually tossed the long blade aside.

He strode toward the opened palace doors, the Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel held across his chest, ready to deal with any sudden situations at any moment.

Watching Xu Yunfan step into the palace without hesitation, Su Zhenhe hesitated for a moment, gritted his teeth, and followed closely behind.

Fortune is sought amidst danger. If he missed this opportunity, he might never have a chance at longevity in this life.

Although the spiritual energy of heaven and earth is currently being raised by the earth's veins, what will happen when it falls again in a few decades?

With a great opportunity laid out before him, he had to take the risk even if there was a threat to his life!

Su Zhenhe hurried to catch up.

The two entered the palace doors one after the other. The doors behind them closed silently, completely isolating them from the outside.

The space inside the hall was far vaster than its exterior suggested. The dome rose high, out of sight, and the surrounding walls were carved with ancient characters of the same origin as the lintel.

The ground was paved with a kind of crystal-clear white jade. Inside every jade brick, a wandering brilliance was sealed. However, due to the depletion of spiritual energy within the White Jade Palace, these slowly wandering jade lights were also faint and indistinct, on the verge of dissipating.

Xu Yunfan's Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel trembled even more violently, and the Dragon Scale Armor emitted an excited hum.

"Heaven and Earth Divine Weapon..."

Xu Yunfan's gaze was like lightning, piercing through the thin mist swirling within the palace and locking onto the depths.

Zhou Tianyan and his group were rapidly rushing toward the central high platform. Their robes fluttered, leaving afterimages; they had clearly used a secret technique to accelerate.

Xu Yunfan wasn't in a rush upon seeing this, simply observing his surroundings at his own pace. On the contrary, Su Zhenhe beside him couldn't hold back and wanted to rush over. However, he reasoned that if he did go over, considering Zhou Tianyan had the heart to destroy a divine weapon, he would likely only receive a severe beating.

Xu Yunfan ignored Su Zhenhe, who was opening his mouth to speak beside him.

The interior of the entire White Jade Palace was laid out in a ring. The dome hung high like an inverted jade bowl, densely covered with star-like ancient runes, now flickering dimly and brightly due to the lack of spiritual energy.

The ground was paved with three-foot square jade bricks. Each brick contained a wisp of wandering pure light. It should have been like a flowing river of stars, but now it was like a candle in the wind, on the verge of extinguishing at any moment.

Twelve dragon-winding jade pillars stood on both sides of the corridor. The design of dragons holding pearls in their mouths was very similar to the "Spirit Locking Vein Suppression Pillars" Xu Yunfan had seen in the *Tian Gong Atlas*, but the surfaces of the pillars were already covered with spiderweb-like cracks.

He couldn't help but stop to observe carefully. With the Tian Gong forging technique at his disposal, he naturally could see some clues.

"Formation..."

Xu Yunfan's eyes moved slightly. Although he didn't know exactly what kind of formation was inscribed on these dragon-winding jade pillars, it was nothing more than the effects of reinforcement and spirit gathering.

He had come to the right place.

Unfortunately, the decay of this palace far exceeded expectations. Even the foundational materials had already crumbled, making it impossible to see the trend of the formation clearly.

He no longer lingered and quickened his pace to pass through the corridor. The tremor of the Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel became even more violent; the red patterns on the cudgel actually ignited inch-high flames on their own.

Xu Yunfan subconsciously grasped the dragon-head mouth of the cudgel. As his force erupted, he suppressed the heavy cudgel's anomaly. This was a phenomenon that only occurs when sensing a high-level divine weapon.

When the Dragon Scale Armor had appeared, the Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel had also been unable to remain calm.

Turning a corner, the scene before them caused the two to stop abruptly.

Five skeletons lay collapsed in a fan shape at the corner of the corridor. The bones were as clear as jade but covered in fine sword marks.

The foremost skeleton still maintained a kneeling posture, its right hand gripping a rusted bronze short sword, the blade piercing three inches into the ground, as if resisting until its last breath.

A broken arrow was stuck between the ribs of the skeleton, the arrowhead glowing with a dark blue luster, clearly coated with a potent poison.

"It's people from the Sword Pavilion!"

Su Zhenhe exclaimed involuntarily, pointing at the half-decayed jade tag at the skeleton's waist. "Look at this 'Washing Sword Pool' pattern... this is at least a长老 (Elder) level figure!"

Xu Yunfan crouched down to inspect closely. He discovered a penetrating wound on the back of the skeleton's neck; the edges of the wound were smooth as a mirror—this was a characteristic left by the "Three Jiao Sword Nourishing Art" cultivated to an extremely deep level, nurturing a true sword qi.

It was at least the realm of a Nine-Rank Qi Refining Supreme Grandmaster.

His gaze swept over the other four skeletons. One had a bronze nail embedded in the Heavenly Cover acupoint on its skull, the nail body inscribed with the unique star patterns of the Nine曜 (Nine Luminaries) Sect.

Another skeleton's chest bones were completely crushed, the sunken area remaining blackened and charred, unrecognizable.

"Two thousand years ago, the Sword Pavilion and the Nine Luminaries Sect fought to the death here." Xu Yunfan looked up into the depths. "It seems the White Jade Palace's danger... the Nine Luminaries Sect must have had someone walk out of it."
