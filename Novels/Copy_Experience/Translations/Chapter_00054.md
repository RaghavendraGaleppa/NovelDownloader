# Chapter 54: Renting a Shop

“May I ask your name, fellow Daoist?”

“Do I need to give my name to do business here?”

“Since fellow Daoist is unwilling to say, then never mind. Please take out what you wish to sell, and this old man will appraise it!”

Upon hearing this, Lu Xu immediately pulled out one storage bag after another from his embrace.

The slightly dim shop before him was called the Secret Shop, similar in nature to the Secret Market trade fair. However, unlike the regularly held trade fairs, these Secret Shops were open long-term, and anyone could come here to conduct business. Lu Xu had a large number of items of unclear origin on hand, which he could conveniently dispose of here.

Currently, Lu Xu didn't have many spirit stones on him, only seven hundred low-grade spirit stones and two mid-grade spirit stones. Of course, this amount would be considered immense wealth for an ordinary late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator. But to Lu Xu, this amount of spirit stones was rather little, so he needed to sell some items to acquire more.

Lu Xu first took out six storage bags. He had a total of eight storage bags, all accidentally obtained after he was forced to retaliate in the past. Although these storage bags were the lowest-grade single-square storage bags, each was worth three hundred spirit stones.

When the Secret Shop owner saw so many storage bags piled on the table, his eyes widened. "You little rascal, how many fellow Daoists have you killed?" The Secret Shop owner's gaze towards Lu Xu couldn't help but fill with apprehension. He realized that the person before him was definitely a ruthless and tough character. One must know that storage bags were not something every cultivator was qualified to possess. After all, the price of three hundred spirit stones was not something everyone could afford. Generally, only late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators had a standard storage bag. Those who could possess one in the mid-stage of Qi Condensation were generally wealthy individuals. The person before him taking out six storage bags meant he had killed at least six late-stage Qi Condensation masters. Such a feat was something even professional rogue cultivators couldn't achieve.

Lu Xu continued to take out items. Besides the six storage bags, he also took out four high-grade magical artifacts and five mid-grade magical artifacts.

"That's all for now. Fellow Daoist, please give an estimate!" Lu Xu placed the pile of items before him, crossing his arms and speaking indifferently to the shop owner.

The Secret Shop owner's cloudy eyes gleamed. He picked up the magical artifacts and carefully examined them one by one. Finally, he sat back at the counter and said in a calm tone: "The storage bags are eighteen hundred spirit stones, and these magical artifacts are fourteen hundred spirit stones. How does that sound?"

Lu Xu calculated, finding the price reasonable, and nodded.

He then asked, "Do you have anything like Fire Thunder Orbs here?"

"I have two Fire Thunder Orbs!"

"I'll take them all!"

A moment later, Lu Xu left the Secret Shop with two Fire Thunder Orbs and two thousand six hundred spirit stones. Watching his departing back, the Secret Shop owner was filled with immense surprise: "When did such a powerful individual appear in Myriad Immortals City?"

After selling these items, Lu Xu was left with only two storage bags, one high-grade magical artifact, and one mid-grade magical artifact. The mid-grade magical artifact was naturally the Azure Radiance Sword, while the high-grade magical artifact was the Golden Radiance Mirror he had obtained from a Black Robe Society rogue cultivator.

"I need to go buy another high-grade magical artifact that suits my own attributes!" Thinking this, Lu Xu immediately headed towards the Thousand Mechanisms Hall. Not long after, when he emerged, he had an additional high-grade defensive magical artifact: the Verdant Wood Shield. This artifact cost him four hundred fifty spirit stones.

Carrying the substantial sum of over two thousand spirit stones, Lu Xu was not satisfied. Next, for his Foundation Establishment plan, he needed to replicate a series of advanced experiences, which required a massive amount of spirit stones. He had to continue earning spirit stones, earning a vast amount of them.

Looking at the bustling street before him, Lu Xu couldn't help but sigh: "I miss the days when I did business with the Black Robe Society!" How simple it was back then; he would make talismans and sell them in batches to the Black Robe Society's contact person. Spirit stones would flow into his hands like a gushing river, making it very easy to earn. The Black Robe Society was his great benefactor, funding him through the initial stages of cultivation when spirit stones were most needed. But now, after losing this major client, even if Lu Xu produced a large batch of talismans, he couldn't sell them quickly.

"For a small-scale business, setting up a stall was fine, but now I'm making hundreds or even thousands of talismans at a time, which simply can't be sold through a stall!"

"I can't possibly run a stall every day, how would I cultivate then?"

"Moreover, street stalls aren't even allowed in Myriad Immortals City!"

Lu Xu couldn't help but secretly curse the Merchant Alliance a few times in his heart. As expected of a group of merchants, they were far more advanced in exploitation than the Mo family of Azure Lake. Street stalls were not permitted in Myriad Immortals City; all business had to be conducted in shops on designated commercial streets. And these shops naturally all belonged to the Merchant Alliance. Outsiders who wished to rent them had to pay exorbitant fees. This was a major blow to the lower-tier cultivators; they simply didn't have the funds to rent a shop. Out of helplessness, these people either joined other shops as employees or became suppliers for shops, for instance, by producing items like talisman paper and spirit ink to supply the shops.

"With my current cultivation, opening a shop shouldn't be a problem!"

"Ultimately, I have to step into the public eye!" Lu Xu thought to himself.

Half a month later.

"You are Fellow Daoist Han Feiyu, correct? I've heard about you from Fellow Daoist Qin. Has fellow Daoist understood my situation?"

"Fellow Daoist Qin has told me; he said Fellow Daoist Gao is preparing to return to your hometown!" Lu Xu said with a smile, cupping his hands towards the middle-aged man opposite him.

This person was named Gao Yi, a Talisman Master Lu Xu had found a few days ago through an intermediary, Fellow Daoist Qin. Gao Yi ran a talisman shop, but recently he was preparing to leave Myriad Immortals City and return to his hometown in Yue Country, so he was considering subleasing the shop.

"Indeed, I'm almost sixty years old, and there's no hope for Foundation Establishment. Naturally, I can only return!" Gao Yi let out a bitter laugh, his face full of sighs.

"Since Foundation Establishment is impossible, then returning to enjoy life is also a wise choice. With fellow Daoist's cultivation, you can live well wherever you go. The remaining decades of your lifespan should be thoroughly enjoyed!" Lu Xu offered a few words of comfort.

"Fellow Daoist Han is right. For so many years, I've cut off all desires, toiled and cultivated my entire life with nothing but talisman crafting and cultivation. Fifty years of life have flown by, and in the end, I can only gaze from afar at the heavenly barrier of Foundation Establishment, without even a single chance to step in!"

"How unfair is Heaven! What did my fifty years of persistence exchange for? If I had known this earlier, I definitely wouldn't have let down the scenery I encountered along the way!" The middle-aged man seemed to have his heartstrings tugged, sighing endlessly for a moment.

"It's not too late to realize it now!" Lu Xu smiled slightly.

"Haha, in the coming decades, I will certainly enjoy myself thoroughly, so as not to betray my arduous life!" Gao Yi laughed heartily, leading Lu Xu to a shop.

"This shop, I've managed it for twelve years, and it has a good reputation among fellow Daoists. I don't wish for the name 'Yifangzhai' to fall after I leave, so if fellow Daoist wishes to rent this shop, I'll need to test your foundation in talisman crafting!"

"If that's the case, then fellow Daoist may bring paper and brush. I will draw a few talismans on the spot, and fellow Daoist can appraise them!" Lu Xu smiled nonchalantly.

"Good!"

A moment later, a mid-grade talisman appeared from Lu Xu's hand. Gao Yi took it, glanced at it, and immediately let out an exclamation of surprise.

"I didn't expect fellow Daoist to look younger than me, yet possess such a high level of talisman crafting!" Gao Yi was a mid-grade Talisman Master, and he had good discernment. After a few glances, he knew that Lu Xu's talisman crafting level was even higher than his own.

"It's merely the orderly inheritance of my family; my elders taught me well, saving me many detours!" Lu Xu said with a calm demeanor.

"So it's a talisman crafting family, no wonder. I'm now at ease letting fellow Daoist take over this Yifangzhai!"

After a round of discussion and negotiation, Lu Xu officially took over Yifangzhai from the high-level Talisman Master. From then on, he would be opening a shop and conducting business in Myriad Immortals City.
