Chapter 12: A Secret That Should Not Have Been Heard

The arrival of Yi She and his party only slightly delayed the team's progress in setting up camp.

As the sun dipped behind the western mountains, the camp was finally erected.

Given Yi She's status as an Executive Steward, he was second only to Suo Chanzhi in this procession and naturally merited a large tent.

The moment his tent was set up, Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan came to request an audience.

He was the commander of the Yu family's escort for this wedding procession. Together with Yang Can, the best man, he formed the martial and civil pillars of the group.

Logically, as the representative of the Yu family sent to take charge of the overall situation, Yi She should have seen him without question.

However, when the message was delivered, the Executive Steward sent back only two words: "I won't see him."

Leopard Head was instantly petrified, standing there as if his soul had fled his body, at a complete loss for a moment.

What did such an attitude from the Executive Steward imply? Even as a rough-and-tumble martial artist, he knew the answer.

So, this was it. They were going to make him the scapegoat?

Just then, Yang Can walked toward Yi She's large tent—or more accurately, toward Leopard Head.

"Master Yang!"

"Master Yang!"

Any member of the Yu family who encountered Yang Can on the road would stop their hurried pace to make way for him, showing the utmost respect.

Those busy digging stoves to cook would drop their firewood, immediately stand up, greet Yang Can warmly, and pay him a reverent gaze.

Although Yang Can's direct confrontation with the Suo family had reasoning that was somewhat unconvincing, it had vented the long-suppressed frustration of the Yu family members.

Never mind that Leopard Head had previously led them in a fierce battle against the Suo family; no matter how intense that fight was, it was just a conflict between servants of two families.

But Master Yang had challenged the Suo family directly. They couldn't help but admire such boldness and courage.

Yang Can nodded to them one by one and walked slowly to Leopard Head's side.

Leopard Head, his fists clenched, remained standing stiffly, his face an indescribable shade of ugly.

"Dakuan, why are you here?"

Hearing Yang Can's words, Leopard Head's stiff neck slowly turned, forcing a smile onto his face.

"Master Yang, Executive Steward Yi... he refuses to see me."

Leopard Head tried to appear nonchalant, to make his tone sound somewhat self-deprecating.

But after saying this, he almost burst into tears; his voice carried a hint of grievance.

This rough-looking man was, in his heart, a bit sentimental.

Yang Can asked in confusion, "Executive Steward Yi won't see you? Why? You are the commander of the main branch's guards. Doesn't the Executive Steward want to hear what you have to say about Young Master Yu's death?"

"Hehe..."

Leopard Head gave a bitter laugh. Of course, he understood this simple logic.

Yang Can mused, "Since Executive Steward Yi refuses to see you, perhaps it's because the crime you're involved in is too great, something even he cannot cover."

Leopard Head said with grief and indignation, "The Young Master's death is indeed a matter of heaven-shaking importance, but... while I bear the responsibility for failing to protect my master, there were reasons for it."

Yang Can sighed. "If someone of higher status than Executive Steward Yi has already passed judgment on you, leaving no room for maneuver, then naturally, there is no need for the Executive Steward to see you or listen to what you have to say."

Hearing this, Leopard Head's face turned as pale as paper.

A person of higher status than Executive Steward Yi could only be the Clan Lord.

Although the various Executive Stewards of External Affairs were ranked first, second, and third, this was based on their strength and status in the Clan Lord's eyes. They did not have command over one another.

Leopard Head's gaze, like the last embers of a dying fire, slowly turned to ash.

"Dakuan, if you want to live, there is only one way now..."

Leopard Head's body trembled, and he asked urgently, "What way?"

Yang Can looked around, said nothing, and leisurely walked past Leopard Head.

Cheng Dakuan was stunned for a moment, then a sudden realization struck him, and he hurriedly chased after him.

Once everything was settled, Executive Steward Yi ordered the bandit to be brought in.

Accompanying Executive Steward Yi in the interrogation of the bandit were Nurse Tu and Yang Can.

Cheng Dakuan, along with some guards, was responsible for the outer perimeter security.

Yi She was a vassal of the Yu family. If he couldn't even get to the bottom of the identity of the person who killed the Young Master and simply brought the person back to Phoenix Mountain Manor, that would be dereliction of duty.

If the Clan Lord had to handle everything personally, what was the use of having you?

In such an interrogation, Nurse Tu, as the representative of the Suo family, had to be present as well.

The bandit was hanging from a large tree at the foot of the mountain. Judging by his appearance, he was around thirty years old.

Dried blood clots were mixed in the disheveled hair on his forehead; his right ear was missing half, but that was an old injury.

The wound under his ribs was from the attack on the camp a few days ago.

At this moment, Executive Steward Yi's guards had already applied torture several times. His body was covered in new wounds that were shocking to behold.

The bandit gasped for breath with difficulty, revealing a mouth of uneven yellow teeth: "P-please... I beg you... give me a quick death. I... I'll return my life to you."

His voice was extremely weak. After being injured, he hadn't received proper treatment.

Now, having endured numerous tortures, the nails of his ten fingers were all torn back, bloodied and raw, and over a dozen tree branches were stuck into his body.

Those branches were all sourced on the spot, broken from trees. Without even being sharpened, they were thrust into his body with their rough splinters still on.

A burly man performing the torture wiped a splash of blood from his face and turned to report to Yi She: "Executive Steward Yi, this thief is very stubborn and won't talk."

"No matter, then continue the torture."

Yi She said calmly: "There are many people who are not afraid of death. But there are very few who can endure torture."

Yi She lifted the hem of his robe and sat down majestically on a large rock, looking at the bandit: "I actually hope to broaden my horizons today."

The bandit gave a惨然 a bitter laugh, his voice very hoarse.

"It's not... that I won't confess. It's that... confessing is useless.

The bandits on the Longshang Plateau have neither... a fixed... residence, nor a fixed leader.

What can I... confess?"

There were many bandits on the Longshang Plateau, but their groups were very small.

This was because the Longshang Plateau was vast and sparsely populated. They lived by plundering. If the group was too large, it couldn't sustain itself.

Therefore, the bandit gangs on the Longshang Plateau were very small, and there were even many lone swordsmen.

In such a place, it was unrealistic to occupy a mountain as a king. They could only move around and commit crimes, and the gang size had to be small.

However, it was also because the Longshang Plateau was vast and sparsely populated that people mostly lived in clusters, and the escort forces of business teams traveling there were also very strong.

At this time, if the target they wanted to attack was a hard nut to crack, the bandits had to temporarily "form a group."

The bandits that formed large gangs included small gangs and lone swordsmen—it was a temporary, hastily assembled team with an extremely complex composition.

What this bandit said was exactly this situation.

Yi She said: "That doesn't require you to worry about it. You just need to tell me, who sent you?"

The bandit said weakly: "We... are bandits, we just rob and plunder. Do we need... someone to send us?"

Yi She let out a laugh to the sky and slowly stood up: "The Suo family is marrying off a daughter, and the Yu family is welcoming a bride. Which side among them can a mere bandit like you afford to provoke?

Even if you didn't 'case the joint' beforehand and were unclear about our background, you should have understood once you saw such a large escort team?"

Yi She slowly walked up to the bandit, lifted his chin with a whip, and said in a deep voice: "I'll ask you one more time, who exactly instigated you?"

The bandit said with a惨然 a bitter laugh: "I... really have nothing to say. Just kill me."

"Death isn't可怕 terrifying, because enduring until death means the suffering has come to an end."

Yi She stared into the bandit's eyes and sneered: "But the pain of torture has no end!"

Yi She slowly took a few steps back and waved his hand lightly.

A guard brought over a bucket with honey mixed in and "哗" poured it over the bandit's head.

The bandit was already covered in wounds. The moment the honey water hit his injuries, it attracted all kinds of insects and ants from the surrounding grass to crawl onto him in just a moment.

Soon, the bandit's eyes widened, and he began to tremble violently.

He was like a fish hooked and hung in mid-air, twisting his body desperately and letting out a series of inhuman wails.

Finally, even Yang Can, an observer to the interrogation, could hardly bear the piercing screams anymore, the bandit, his eyes rolled back and his whole body trembling, collapsed.

"I'll talk, I'll talk, please give me a quick death, a quick death."

Yi She waved his hand, and two guards each brought a bucket of river water and "哗" splashed it over the bandit.

The bandit temporarily relieved the pain that was driving him mad and panted heavily.

Yi She stood before the bandit again and said calmly: "Speak. As long as you tell me, I will give you a quick death."

The bandit said weakly: "It was... it was Yu Huanhu of the second branch of the Yu family... who ordered..."

"You shut your mouth!" Yi She's expression changed abruptly.

Nurse Tu hadn't heard clearly and instinctively stepped forward, asking: "Executive Steward Yi, what did he say?"

Yi She didn't answer. He hurriedly stepped forward and "嗤" tore a blood-stained strip of cloth from the bandit's body.

Yi She didn't mind the filth, hurriedly bunched the cloth strip, and pinched the bandit's cheeks, stuffing the cloth ball into his mouth.

"Someone, give him the best golden sore medicine. You must ensure he stays alive until we reach Tianshui!"

Yi She ordered harshly, the muscles at the corner of his eye twitching from uncontrollable excitement.

Nurse Tu asked in confusion: "Executive Steward Yi, what did he say?"

Yi She didn't answer but ordered sternly: "Immediately apply medicine and bandage his wounds."

The guards acknowledged the order and immediately got to work.

Yang Can's position wasn't too close, but it wasn't too far either.

He was standing even further away than Nurse Tu, but whether intentionally or not, he was standing downwind.

At this moment, the evening wind blowing from the mountains grew slightly stronger. Although the bandit's voice was weak, Yang Can still heard the three most critical words.

Yu Huanhu!

Yang Can had only been Yu Chengye's guest strategist for a little over half a year. He had never met Yu Huanhu.

But he had long heard of Yu Huanhu's great name.

In the Yu family, this was a name that no person and no matter could avoid.

Yu Huanhu, the head of the Yu family's second branch, the younger brother of the Yu family's Clan Lord, the Second Master Yu?

This is... an uncle killing his nephew?

Yang Can was also greatly shocked inside!

PS: Congratulations to the benefactor Brother Han Han, I'll get up early tomorrow morning to kill Old Tu ^-^'
