# Chapter 633: Remolding the Physical Body

It seemed that only a thin layer of paper remained to be pierced before reaching the legendary realm of a Foundation Establishment perfection Great True Person, where one’s cave heaven was completely stable and magical power flowed unimpeded.

The key to piercing this layer of paper was the yet-to-be-condensed Intent.

Naturally, he was in no hurry regarding this matter.

He would first refine and absorb the Immortal Golden Nature as much as possible.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan stood atop a desolate hill, gazing into the distant horizon of the Aitila World.

Thirteen strands of Immortal Golden Nature swam slowly within his Dao Foundation cave heaven like thirteen purple-gold divine dragons, emanating a majestic vitality and immortal meaning.

The Star Spirit Banner floated quietly by his side. On its surface, there were now a dozen or so more Star Spirit phantoms, some clear and some blurry. Faint divine radiance intertwined, making the star map on the banner appear even more profound and mysterious.

The hunt for gods would not stop, but the next targets needed to be chosen more cautiously.

Therefore, the hunt had to be temporarily halted.

In the nearly half a year since, in this wild western wilderness—disdained by powerful gods and thus becoming a playground for these weak deities—the number of gods had actually become increasingly scarce.

Xu Yunfan stood in a just-cleared desolate valley, his brows slightly furrowed.

His spiritual sense swept through the surrounding hundreds of miles, yet he found no new traces of weak gods.

"Previously, I detected a god residing in this very location."

Xu Yunfan posed this疑惑 to the many gods within the Star Spirit Banner.

Delis within the banner transmitted a thought at the opportune moment.

"It should be that尊上's hunting traces could not be completely concealed after all. Survivors or believers have spread the news of the God Hunter. They... likely those who could escape have already fled."

Her thought carried a complex emotion, a mix of pity for her kind and fear of Xu Yunfan's methods.

Xu Yunfan understood.

Although the Threefold Karma Secret Art was powerful, capable of shielding against the Heavenly Dao's gaze and distorting his own karma traces, it could not completely conceal the regional anomalies caused by the dissipation of energy during every hunt for a god.

Especially when the target god fought back in their dying moments or self-destructed their divine core, the commotion was even harder to cover up completely.

Given enough time, it was inevitable that news would spread among the gods.

"Continuing to sweep this area for weak gods is too inefficient and a waste of time. It would take considerable effort just to chase down those who have fled."

Xu Yunfan's eyes were deep.

The foundation solidified by the thirteen strands of Immortal Golden Nature gave him the confidence to take a step further.

He was only a layer of paper away from Foundation Establishment perfection. As long as he wished it, he could instantly condense his Intent with the help of the Attribute Panel and reach the Great True Person realm in the blink of an eye.

He was merely contemplating his own Dao of determination.

Passively waiting was not his style. Since small gods were now hard to find, he might as well change his target.

His spiritual sense swept through the storage within the Star Spirit Banner, over the few unrefined divine cores.

One of them came from a weak god whose authority involved "Inspection" and "Discernment."

The core of its divine core contained mixed Faith Power, which was harmful and useless to Xu Yunfan's Dao Foundation. However, the Authority Imprint carried by the divine core itself was quite valuable.

It was particularly suitable for one person.

The Sect Master of the Dao Sect, Zhang Ziyang.

There was no need to rush for now. Xu Yunfan immediately found a hidden mountain cave and set up layer upon layer of concealment and isolation formations.

He flipped his hand and took out the diamond-shaped divine core emitting a faint inspection fluctuation. Then, he poured out a massive amount of natural treasures from his storage bag.

There were immortal gold and jade marrow scavenged from the ruins of the Heavenly Realm, Yin-Yang spiritual soil exchanged from the Primordial Origin Sect, and even the pure Faith Power stripped from the hunted gods.

"Sect Master, the time has come. I shall remold your physical body."

Xu Yunfan transmitted his voice into the Star Spirit Banner.

With this divine core, Zhang Ziyang naturally possessed the identity of a local native.

The banner flashed with a dark light, and the phantom of a handsome-faced Daoist in a blue robe appeared. Although he was a soul body, his gaze was clear and wise, filled with anticipation. He nodded slightly.

"Trouble you, Yunfan."

Xu Yunfan said no more. He formed hand seals with both hands, and Eight Scenery Cloud Qi rose and circulated around him.

He first used his immense Divine霄 magical power to melt and fuse all the materials together, transforming them into a crystal-clear, Dao-rhyme-flowing innate Dao Body prototype.

Then, he guided the inspection divine core to slowly merge into the center of the Dao Body's eyebrows.

The moment the divine core and Dao Body made contact, a soft brilliance burst forth, and the Authority Imprint began to blend with the meridians of the Dao Body.

Following that, Xu Yunfan used refining techniques to repeatedly purify the massive amount of mixed Faith Power, transforming it into the most fundamental divine essence. Like sweet dew, it nourished the junction of the divine core and the Dao Body.

This step was crucial. Here, Faith Power was not a resource for cultivation but an indispensable adhesive and catalyst for remolding the physical body.

Finally, Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense communicated with the Star Spirit Banner, releasing its restraint. Zhang Ziyang's soul avatar turned into a stream of light and precisely plunged into the Dao Body that had initially merged with the inspection divine core.

*Hum!*

The Dao Body suddenly burst forth with brilliant light. Its pores opened wide, frantically absorbing the surrounding energy and the divine essence Xu Yunfan had prepared in advance.

The divine core imprint on its forehead flickered and eventually stabilized completely, transforming into a profound silver star.

Zhang Ziyang's features quickly solidified, and his blue robe moved without wind.

A Foundation Establishment initial stage aura, accompanied by the unique Dao Rhyme Authority of inspection and discernment, diffused from his newly born body.

Zhang Ziyang slowly opened his eyes. The sharp light within them was retracted, turning into a gentle warmth.

He raised his hands, feeling the warmth and strength of his flesh-and-blood body, and bowed deeply to Xu Yunfan.

"This old Daoist, Zhang Ziyang, thanks you for the恩情 of rebirth!"

His tone was sincere, carrying the emotion of one who had experienced the vicissitudes of life.

His physical body had been remolded, and he was reborn as a human. Moreover, this body had an excellent foundation, further enhanced by the inspection divine core, which would be immensely beneficial for his comprehension of the Great Dao and his path of divine cultivation through Faith Power.

For him, this world was naturally a blue ocean, where he could施展 his skills and achieve great things.

Even if he were to return to the Taihua Lingxu World in the future, as long as there were enough believers in this world, the connection would not be severed.

Xu Yunfan withdrew his magical power, his face slightly pale, but he waved his hand.

"The Sect Master and I have a deep connection, and you have helped me greatly. This is only right. There is no need for thanks."

His tone was calm. Looking at Zhang Ziyang's familiar face, now tinged with a new aura, he was quite satisfied in his heart.

Having Zhang Ziyang, the Sect Master of the Dao Sect with astonishing comprehension, by his side would be a tremendous aid, whether for comprehending Dao techniques, deducing secret arts, or for subsequent plans.

And furthermore...

Xu Yunfan silently glanced at the Attribute Panel, where the effect of Zhang Ziyang's "Teaching" was still in effect.

Zhang Ziyang adjusted his breath slightly, familiarizing himself with his new body and new abilities, a glint of wisdom flashing in his eyes.

"Yunfan, you paused your hunt and remolded my physical body. Your plans must go beyond this. Who is the next target?"

Xu Yunfan's gaze shifted towards the distant horizon, where the clouds were thick, and muffled thunder rumbled faintly.

"The small gods in the wild western wilderness are now like startled birds. It is useless to continue lingering here.

I intend to hunt stronger targets, especially the 'Heart of Nature' pantheon that reveres primitive life force and the balance of all things..."

He paused, a sharp light flashing in his eyes. "Among them, a god who governs thunder and lightning. The aura of his Authority vaguely aligns with my Divine霄 Thunder Dao technique. Acquiring this god's divine core would be beneficial to me."
