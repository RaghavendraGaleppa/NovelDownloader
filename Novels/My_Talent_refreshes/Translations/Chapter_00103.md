**Chapter 103: Ambush**

Chu Ning was received as usual this time. However, upon hearing he only wanted to buy spirit plant seeds and talismans, he was directly led to the spirit plant section. He found the place where Iron Stem Orchids were sold last time and inquired, confirming there was indeed a batch of Iron Stem Orchid seeds. There were only a hundred. Chu Ning spent 120 spirit stones to buy all of them. Immediately after, he wandered around the area, spending hundreds of spirit stones on other seeds he thought might be useful in the future.

Then, Chu Ning arrived at the talisman selling area. He could make high-grade primary talismans himself, so he naturally wasn't interested in them. What he was looking at now were low-grade intermediate talismans. Intermediate talismans were a significant step up from primary ones. A high-grade primary talisman could only be compared to the spells of a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator. Even if a ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivator possessed powerful spells, a high-grade primary talisman still couldn't compare. A low-grade intermediate talisman, however, could fully contend with powerful spells from cultivators at the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation stage, and even with the spells of ordinary early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. Chu Ning didn't buy any attack talismans, but he spent 1000 spirit stones on five low-grade intermediate defensive talismans, just in case. Low-grade intermediate attack talismans cost 100 low-grade spirit stones, while defensive talismans cost 200.

While Chu Ning was walking around, a conversation entered his ears, piquing his interest. He looked towards the sound and saw a middle-aged man's stall not far to the left, with a scrawny old man, seemingly over fifty, standing in front of it. The sound came from their conversation. "Fellow Daoist, is this artifact fragment really 100 spirit stones?" the skinny old man asked. The middle-aged man replied, "What's wrong with an artifact fragment? Anything that can be used to refine an artifact must be made of excellent materials. If you don't want to buy it, just leave. Don't get in the way here. I only sell to those who know its worth." The middle-aged man's face immediately showed a sneer when he heard the old man's words. The skinny old man, however, did not leave; he continued to stand there, smiling and shaking his head, saying, "Refining artifacts certainly requires good materials, but yours is clearly a fusion of several materials. It must be for crafting a unique artifact. Even if the materials are good, they're useless to us. If it were a damaged but complete artifact fragment, that would be different. Some damaged artifact fragments, although unable to unleash their original power, are still quite powerful when used under certain conditions." The skinny old man simply shook his head, smiled, said no more, and walked away.

Chu Ning felt a hint of regret. The truth was, the conversation between the two not only attracted Chu Ning's attention but also drew many people from around. A young man quickly squeezed in and picked up a piece of grayish-black material in front of the middle-aged man. After the youth finished asking and the middle-aged man confirmed, he swiftly took out some spirit stones, handed them to the middle-aged man, and quickly left without looking back. Chu Ning couldn't help but sigh for the young man, who seemed to be from some cultivation family. He thought, "Artifact fragment? Damaged artifact?" Chu Ning walked towards it with some interest after hearing these words.

The market had many things he hadn't seen in Qinghe Market, which immediately made Chu Ning interested in exploring. He was slightly surprised to find a special area designated for rogue cultivators to trade. Rogue cultivators could freely set up stalls on this street to conduct transactions. After walking around, Chu Ning discovered that Wind Gorge Market was indeed much larger than Qinghe Market. However, after observing for a while, Chu Ning couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. The items here were still too low-grade; most were for Qi Condensation early and middle-stage cultivators. There were very few items suitable for a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator like himself. With this particular incident, Chu Ning lost even more interest in browsing here. He briefly thought about finding a Foundation Establishment cultivator in the city who could give them a ride. However, it was clear that even if he could find one, they wouldn't necessarily agree to take them.

He then saw the skinny old man return to the middle-aged man's stall again. "Oh, so this scrawny old man was a shill?" Chu Ning thought. He had seemed so good-tempered and experienced just now, truly deceptive. Chu Ning felt a slight sigh in his heart and decided not to go any further, lest the spirit farmer (from whom he bought items on the first day of the market) see him and feel awkward.

As the time neared, Chu Ning walked towards the market's gate tower. Chu Ning was the first to arrive. After a while, Shen Zhengquan and Gu Xiaoqing arrived successively. After they chatted for a bit, Luo Yiping and Lu Miaoying finally showed up. "Oh, you all arrived early. Since everyone's here, let's go," Luo Yiping said, looking quite pleased with his apparent harvest. The five of them maintained their formation from when they arrived. Chu Ning drove the Wind-Chasing Shuttle in the middle, as its grade was actually higher than Shen Zhengquan's, making it easier to control its speed. Luo Yiping, however, felt uneasy being at the very front. He intended to move back to the middle of the group. "All in all, it's because none of the seven sects in the Qingxia Mountain Range specialize in array formations," someone commented during their flight. "The teleportation arrays near the sects in Qingxia Mountain Range are too few; they only set up teleportation arrays over very long distances." Chu Ning privately grumbled to himself. Especially after flying for a while, Luo Yiping replenished his mana with a Spirit Recovery Pill, while Chu Ning showed no reaction, which made Luo Yiping feel quite sour.

But at this moment, Chu Ning's mind suddenly became alert. He had slowed down the Wind-Chasing Shuttle less than five li after flying out in front of the group. It was no wonder Chu Ning reacted this way, because just now, a figure had flashed past. He had actually seen the black-clothed man who had appeared outside the Green Stream Talisman Store on the day of the beast tide. Chu Ning's brow furrowed slightly. The man had just passed by from a distance and was now gone. "I think I just saw someone stealthily following you," Chu Ning said to Luo Yiping. "What?" Luo Yiping turned his head in great surprise upon hearing Chu Ning's words. "You must be seeing things. How could anyone be following me here in Wind Gorge Market? And even if there were, how could you see them?" Luo Yiping scoffed immediately after hearing Chu Ning's words. "That's even more impossible. Last time, our sect's Foundation Establishment deacons, together with Wind Gorge, thoroughly cleared the surrounding area. Where would there be so many people from the Yin Demon Sect?" Chu Ning's expression was firm and serious; this was clearly not the time to argue with Luo Yiping. "Yin Demon Sect?" Hearing Chu Ning's words, the faces of the others all changed. Luo Yiping, seeing this, became even more convinced that Chu Ning was hiding something. He even actively tried to steer the others' thoughts in that direction, saying, "Chu Ning, did you see clearly just now? You're not deliberately toying with us, making us rush so miserably, are you?" Luo Yiping continued to question.

But at this very moment, several figures launched an attack towards them. At the same time, four figures suddenly rose into the sky in front of Chu Ning. In the next moment, a black-robed figure appeared, precisely the black-clothed man who had shown his face outside Chu Ning's shop before. Simultaneously, three beams of red-black light shot directly towards Chu Ning and the others. Chu Ning, being at the very front, naturally bore the brunt of the attack. "Careful!" The red-black lights were so fast that they reached him as soon as he moved. Almost instinctively, he immediately activated the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield he already held in his hand, blocking it in front of him. Everyone else also subconsciously activated their mana shields.

Two black lights struck the low-grade intermediate defensive talisman shield outside Chu Ning's body; this defensive shield, capable of withstanding attacks from Great Perfection Qi Condensation cultivators, instantly shattered. The Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield only resisted for a brief moment before it was directly pierced through. The red-black light, mixed with black, mercilessly pierced through the defense and passed through his body. Chu Ning's body emitted a muffled sound as the red-black light, which had shattered multiple layers of defense, struck him. Immediately, he was sent flying backward by the force. They had already seen Chu Ning get knocked back and fall towards the ground. In the next instant, Chu Ning's face turned drastically pale. The slightly weakened red-black light still struck his body. The immense power of the attack filled Chu Ning with horror. His low-grade intermediate defensive talisman and the intermediate defensive artifact, the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield, had both failed to withstand it. With only two layers of defense, how could he resist such an assault?

The strongest among them, Gu Xiaoqing, was the first to fully activate her flying sword, sweeping forward like a startling rainbow. "Careful!" Gu Xiaoqing shouted, her fingers directing her flying sword to strike a tall, thin black-clothed man. Another red-bladed light attacked another person. The other two attackers, one attacked Shen Zhengquan, and the other attacked Lu Miaoying. Lu Miaoying was only at the fifth level of Qi Condensation, and facing an attack from a black-clothed man, she was clearly outmatched. This scene unfolded so quickly that by the time Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan reacted, it was already too late.

The black-clothed man who came flying from behind suddenly changed his expression and roared towards their side. The grey-clothed man fighting Lu Miaoying was also surprised, not understanding what his companion was shouting about. At that moment, another red-black light suddenly appeared from behind, shooting directly towards Luo Yiping. *Thump!* He was a step too slow. Luo Yiping, who had fallen to the very back, now landed on the ground. He moved to help Lu Miaoying. But at this moment, she (Lu Miaoying) saw, to her astonishment, that the face of the black-clothed man flying from behind suddenly changed drastically, and he roared towards their side. Taking the opportunity, one attacker killed Luo Yiping with a single strike. Chu Ning had never imagined Luo Yiping would be so foolishly reckless. In just one exchange, their side had lost two combatants. In a five-on-three situation (referring to the attackers, not counting the lost combatants on their side), there was almost no chance of victory.

Chu Ning sighed internally; at this point, there seemed to be no other choice. Gu Xiaoqing, with a solemn expression, said, "It's better to believe it than not. There's no time to lose; we must leave immediately. We'll fly at full speed from now on, without worrying about mana consumption." Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan both responded. Chu Ning, with a grim expression, said, "My cultivation is low; I won't gamble with my life." Gu Xiaoqing's words made sense; returning to Yanji Market as quickly as possible was the most important thing. "Let's be more careful on the way and look out for each other," Gu Xiaoqing added, distributing several bottles of pills from her storage bag to everyone. Shen Zhengquan quickly boarded his flying boat, carrying Lu Miaoying. Chu Ning threw out this statement, bypassed Gu Xiaoqing, and continued to fly forward without slowing down. He thought, "If another black-clothed man appeared, it would be certain death." Luo Yiping's face finally showed panic, and he wanted to flee. Luo Yiping, seeing this, could only grit his teeth and follow the others. Seeing that Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan in front actually intended to stop, Chu Ning continued to fly forward on his Wind-Chasing Shuttle.

The Yanji Market was still too close to Wind Gorge Market. Chu Ning thought, "As for Lin Changqing and Du Han, they couldn't be contacted at all." He also considered, "It's best not to bring out items like those of Old Man Sun and Big Brother Liu." The only thing that slightly comforted them was that these attackers seemed to have limitations on using the red-black light. "In the lower echelons of the cultivation world, life is actually quite difficult. People only say cultivation is good, but without talent and opportunities, the path of cultivation..." Chu Ning thought, but he didn't elaborate.

Someone, holding a completely black staff, was about to join the battle. After activating some unknown artifact, a layer of green shield immediately appeared around his body. At the same time, a green light sword spell shot from not far away, directly striking the shield. The shield then dissipated at a visible rate. The green light sword, however, shone even brighter.
