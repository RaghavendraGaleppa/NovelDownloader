# Chapter 120: The Campaign Begins, A New Cave Abode (Combined)

"Senior Brother, are you saying the Dao Academy is about to launch another campaign against the Crimson Moon Great River?" Gu Yuan asked Elder Lu Guan in the Bamboo Heart Courtyard.

"Indeed. Even before the Flowing Clouds Banquet began, the academy had secretly issued decrees. Within a year at most, we will campaign against the Crimson Moon Great River again. This time, it won't be minor skirmishes—we're determined to seize true spiritual veins and mineral deposits, bringing the Crimson Moon Great River under the academy's governance."

"Originally, the academy didn't want to act so aggressively. But with the changing tides outside, the Sunset Cloud Sect has already taken control of most of the Thunderpeal Mountain Range, gaining several third-tier spiritual peaks. Not long ago, one of their Foundation Establishment cultivators even successfully broke through to Golden Core, greatly boosting their momentum."

"In turbulent times, true heroes emerge."

"Junior Brother Gu, to be frank, before the Flowing Clouds Banquet, disciples from our seven branches had a contest with those from the Sunset Cloud Sect's various peaks. The outcome... was less than satisfactory. It was precisely because of this that the academy released an additional twenty spiritual qi for the secret realm competition—to nurture more elite disciples."

"Other sects are aggressively expanding and competing for resources. If we don't catch up, the gap will only widen over time."

Elder Lu Guan sighed slightly, his expression grave.

Once the campaign begins, countless lives will be lost.

But there's no alternative.

When all sects compete and you alone abstain, even with Golden Core or even Nascent Soul cultivators holding the line, those victorious sects will accumulate more and more resources over time. Eventually, they'll cultivate increasingly formidable disciples, and the Azure Peak Dao Academy will inevitably fall behind.

Gu Yuan nodded slightly, understanding dawning in his heart.

This was the beginning of an arms race.

Still, it made sense. Back in the Cloud Mist Valley, Gu Yuan had noticed that the combat prowess of Sunset Cloud Sect disciples clearly surpassed that of the academy's disciples. Bian Chuyao had been confident, yet was easily defeated—proof enough.

Only through life-and-death battles and ruthless competition could truly powerful individuals emerge.

The Azure Peak Dao Academy was already a step behind.

But this wasn't entirely bad. Without this situation, he wouldn't have gained the opportunities from the Flowing Clouds Banquet.

"Junior Brother is astute—you grasp the implications immediately. The campaign against the Crimson Moon Great River carries great risks, but the rewards for victory will be substantial."

"However, apart from the Azureflame Golden-eyed Ape clan, the Crimson Moon Great River also contains countless spiritual peaks and swamps, teeming with various demonic beasts—all vassals of the ape clan. The miasma and demonic influences are beyond measure. Even with your exceptional talent, you can't handle everything alone."

"Occupying spiritual peaks, plundering spiritual veins, and setting up formations are all tedious tasks. Not to mention, must you personally capture every minor demon lurking in the mountains?"

"But with the support of our Azure Fall Peak, many of these troubles can be avoided."

Elder Lu Guan seized the opportunity to make a sincere request of Gu Yuan.

Gu Yuan pondered briefly.

Elder Lu Guan spoke the truth.

If he were to join the campaign, he would indeed need assistance. This was also the academy's intention—each peak would serve as a banner, driving competition across the academy to select the most formidable individuals.

"Since Senior Brother has been so forthright, how could I refuse?"

"Which spiritual qi does Senior Brother desire?"

Gu Yuan looked up and smiled at Elder Lu Guan.

"Just one strand of Cloud Spirit Qi!"

Elder Lu Guan's eyes lit up with joy as he placed a golden box before Gu Yuan.

Seeing the box, Gu Yuan's lips curled into a smile.

Soon after, both Elder Lu Guan and Gu Yuan left Ancient Peak Mountain in high spirits.

However, Gu Yuan didn't return to the Qian Yuan Cave. Instead, he flew toward the Personnel Hall on Azure Peak Mountain.

The area outside Qian Yuan Cave was already crowded with countless cultivators, the noise making it unsuitable for cultivation.

Given his current status, he needed a better place for cultivation.

---

The Personnel Hall was filled with the fragrance of incense. Qiu Mingshan sat leisurely sipping tea and reading, thoroughly enjoying himself.

Suddenly, a streak of light arrived in an instant, landing before the hall.

The disciples guarding the entrance didn't dare to stop it.

The light resembled a rainbow, requiring no magical tools—this visitor was undoubtedly a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Such figures were beyond the ability of mere Qi Refinement gatekeepers to obstruct, unless the grand formation was activated.

Qiu Mingshan also perked up, his expression turning respectful. He glanced up curiously, wondering which elder had arrived.

But one look left him stunned, speechless for a long time.

"Gu... Gu Junior Brother? No, no—Elder Gu!"

After a long pause, Qiu Mingshan finally managed to speak.

"It's been a while, Senior Brother Qiu!"

Meeting an old acquaintance, Gu Yuan also smiled and addressed him as "Senior Brother."

"Elder Gu, you jest! Don't humble this disciple—just call me your junior!"

Qiu Mingshan forced a bitter smile and quickly bowed, not daring to accept the title.

In the Azure Peak Dao Academy, unless they were master and disciple, all members addressed each other based on cultivation level. Those of higher cultivation were "senior brothers," while those a full major realm above were "elders."

Gu Yuan had arrived on a rainbow light, like an immortal descending to the mortal realm. How could Qiu Mingshan dare to address him as an equal?

Yet, as he looked at Gu Yuan, a complex mix of emotions churned in his heart, leaving him with an indescribable taste.

When they first met, Gu Yuan had been a mere Qi Refinement fourth-layer cultivator, barely admitted to the academy. Now, he had successfully established his Foundation, while Qiu Mingshan remained stuck at Qi Refinement ninth layer. The comparison was galling.

But remembering what Gu Yuan now possessed, Qiu Mingshan's face flushed slightly with desire.

Just then, another streak of light appeared in the hall.

A middle-aged cultivator with an imposing demeanor, wearing a jade crown, cloud boots, and a white Daoist robe, materialized beside Gu Yuan.

"Master!"

Startled by the newcomer, Qiu Mingshan immediately bowed deeply.

This was the head of the Personnel Hall, a late Foundation Establishment cultivator—Daoist Yu Guang, also known as Fu Wenshan, Qiu Mingshan's master.

Most positions in the Azure Peak Dao Academy were held by members of the seven branches or aristocratic families. But Fu Wenshan hailed from the Hidden Dragon Branch, making him a disciple of humble origins.

"Elder Gu's status has changed. He's no longer someone you can receive. You may leave now..."

Fu Wenshan looked at his long-stagnant disciple, then at Gu Yuan before him, and couldn't help but sigh, waving for Qiu Mingshan to withdraw.

Qiu Mingshan froze, his spirit deflating, but he still bowed and exited the hall.

Standing outside, gazing at the golden sun hanging high in the sky, Qiu Mingshan couldn't help but laugh at himself.

Who would have thought that in just a few years, he would no longer even be qualified to receive Gu Yuan?

Was the influence of a Golden Core cultivator truly so overwhelming?

Just then, one of the hall's gatekeepers quietly approached and handed him a storage pouch.

"Senior Brother Qiu, Elder Gu just sent word for me to give this to you."

Qiu Mingshan was taken aback. Opening the pouch, he found it filled to the brim with spirit stones and treasures, dazzlingly radiant.

Yet, despite holding such riches, his face remained gloomy.

He knew the spiritual qi was now beyond his reach.

---

"Congratulations, Junior Brother, on establishing your Foundation and gaining three hundred years of longevity. Our Hidden Dragon Branch hasn't produced someone like you in many years. Let me toast you with tea in place of wine!"

In the hall, Fu Wenshan raised a jade cup in salute to Gu Yuan.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"

Gu Yuan also raised his cup in gratitude.

After exchanging pleasantries, Fu Wenshan got straight to the point: "One doesn't visit the temple without cause. Has Junior Brother come today regarding a cave abode?"

"Senior Brother sees clearly. I wish to request a spiritual island for cultivation."

Gu Yuan nodded.

According to academy regulations, any cultivator who reached Foundation Establishment could be assigned a second-tier spiritual island for cultivation. The spiritual land on the island could be freely developed—planting medicinal fields or nurturing spiritual materials.

In essence, upon reaching Foundation Establishment, one could become the master of an island, effectively gaining a personal Dao site—though it paled in comparison to third-tier spiritual islands.

"Since Junior Brother also hails from the Hidden Dragon Branch, we're not outsiders. I'll speak frankly—the Personnel Hall still has several second-tier spiritual islands available for your choosing, but don't set your expectations too high."

"What does Senior Brother mean?"

"Junior Brother may not know this, but a Foundation Establishment cultivator can live up to four hundred and fifty years. The Flowing Clouds Banquet is held once every century, with ten strands of spiritual qi distributed each time. This means that within a single generation of Foundation Establishment cultivators, the academy gains dozens of new Foundation Establishment experts—and that's just the official count. In reality, new Foundation Establishment cultivators emerge every few years, so the number is even greater."

"Although our Azure Peak Dao Academy is vast and wealthy, supporting so many Foundation Establishment cultivators is still challenging."

"We do have some second-tier spiritual islands left, but they're all barren or chaotic lands, some even plagued by fire miasma or earth toxins. They can barely sustain daily cultivation, let alone serve as proper Dao sites for nurturing spiritual materials."

Fu Wenshan sighed slightly.

"Is there no other way?"

Gu Yuan frowned and pressed further.

The matter of the spiritual island was crucial to his future cultivation—he couldn't afford to be careless.

"It's difficult."

"The distribution of spiritual islands follows strict rules—first come, first served. We can't simply take away islands that others have cultivated for decades, complete with well-tended spiritual fields, just because someone new arrives."

Fu Wenshan shook his head, but then added meaningfully, "However, private exchanges are permissible if both parties agree. Given the treasures Junior Brother now holds, you might have some opportunities if you're willing to share."

Trading spiritual qi for a spiritual island?

Gu Yuan immediately dismissed the idea.

That would be a losing deal.

Spiritual qi wasn't meant to be exchanged for resources—it was meant to secure the loyalty of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

It was about building a foundation, gaining support for competing for the position of True Successor.

A mere second-tier spiritual island wasn't worth it.

But thinking of the Dao Unity Green Lotus Seed he possessed, Gu Yuan's frown deepened.

The reason he urgently needed a new cave abode wasn't just to escape the noise outside Qian Yuan Cave—it was also to find a better place for cultivation and enhancing his strength.

After reaching Foundation Establishment, many of his Qi Refinement spells had grown in power. But breaking through to a new realm required new methods, especially since he cultivated three types of qi simultaneously.

He still had his eye on Bian Chuyao's ancient seals.

"Beyond that, we can only wait for the Crimson Moon Great River campaign..."

Seeing Gu Yuan's expression, Fu Wenshan sighed inwardly, realizing the spiritual qi was out of reach. Still, he offered another solution.

"The Crimson Moon Great River?"

This was already the second time today Gu Yuan had heard about this.

It seemed the campaign was common knowledge among the academy's veteran Foundation Establishment cultivators.

"The campaign against the Crimson Moon Great River isn't far off. This time, it's no minor operation—the academy is serious. Foundation Establishment cultivators will take part, and those who capture spiritual islands or veins will be generously rewarded. The academy will either set up formations or task the Mountain Moving Hall with fully incorporating the islands into the academy's territory, just like Flying Wave Mountain before."

"A year isn't long to wait. With the multiple strands of spiritual qi you hold, Junior Brother, your influence is considerable. If you can seize a spiritual island, it can serve as your Dao site for cultivation. The islands from the Personnel Hall are merely stepping stones."

Fu Wenshan explained.

Gu Yuan nodded resignedly. It seemed this was the only way.

"Then I'll trouble Senior Brother to bring out the maps so I can select an island for cultivation."

"Of course, of course!"

Fu Wenshan waved his sleeve, and a glowing terrain chart appeared before Gu Yuan.

Most of the islands on the map were dim, already claimed. Only a dozen or so in the corners still emitted faint light.

All leftovers.

Gu Yuan sighed softly and reluctantly chose an island named "Flameearth Island" near the center of the remaining options.

"This island has ample spiritual qi, but its earth veins contain fiery energy. At noon each day, flames erupt across the island, burning everything. No spiritual plants can survive—it's only suitable for cultivation, not farming. I apologize for the poor selection."

Fu Wenshan sighed and handed Gu Yuan a jade token.

"It's fine. Thank you, Senior Brother."

"Additionally, your identity token needs updating. After reaching Foundation Establishment, the Transmission Hall will open to you. You can study all the Foundation Establishment spells there. But they're far more difficult to master than Qi Refinement spells. If you wish to continue advancing swiftly, you mustn't slack off."

"In all these years, our humble branch has had its share of talented Qi Refinement disciples who shone brightly. But cultivation grows increasingly arduous at higher levels. A single word from a Golden Core cultivator is worth ten thousand scrolls. Golden Core cultivators rarely summon Qi Refinement disciples, but Foundation Establishment cultivators occasionally receive their guidance—the difference in status is like clouds and mud."

Fu Wenshan seemed to recall something and offered a quiet warning before updating Gu Yuan's token.

"Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother!"

Gu Yuan bowed in gratitude.

Without further delay, Gu Yuan rode his light toward the Transmission Hall.

The Crimson Moon Great River campaign was common knowledge now, leaving him little time. If he wanted to continue advancing rapidly, he had to make the most of this period to enhance his strength.

After reaching Foundation Establishment, Gu Yuan's speed had increased dramatically. He arrived at the Transmission Hall in no time.

The hall looked the same as ever—unattended, just a solitary jade structure standing alone.

Yet even at Foundation Establishment, Gu Yuan still couldn't discern the hall's depths. He only sensed a vast, imposing aura enveloping it, brimming with solemnity.

"Whoosh!"

Gu Yuan took out his token. A green light emanated from the hall, drawing him inside.
