# Chapter 47: Fu Dongliu

The three True Monarchs faced off against the three Demon Kings, while the remaining demonic beasts charged forward. In an instant, human cultivators and demonic beasts clashed.

"Little Junior Brother, go on. Find a suitable demonic beast to practice with. With me here, no demonic beast can harm you. Oh, that's right, not even those three Demon Kings up ahead," Li Changxiao said with a smile, seeing Yang Ji draw his flying sword.

Yang Ji glanced at him, deeply surprised. Demon Kings were equivalent to Nascent Soul True Monarchs. Was this senior brother of his, acquired so cheaply, really that powerful? Could he, with just a Golden Core cultivation, withstand a Demon King?

As he pondered, a foul, fishy stench suddenly wafted to his nose. Before him appeared an ugly, buffalo-sized frog, its back covered in putrid, festering tumors, exuding a repulsive odor. He scanned it with a glance: [Level 10 Fire Frog. Agile and extremely fast. Can release scorching flames and project deadly poison mist. Weakness: Vocal Sac.]

The moment their eyes met, "Croak!" The buffalo-sized Fire Frog leaped violently, its massive body lunging forward with the force of Mount Tai collapsing, seemingly intending to crush Yang Ji to death with its sheer weight.

Yang Ji smiled calmly, took a slight step back, and dodged the Fire Frog's pounce. Bang! The ground trembled as it landed heavily, dirt flying and stirring up a wave of searing heat.

Just then, a sword qi streaked across the void, aiming directly for its vocal sac—a strike instantly unleashed by the dodging Yang Ji. The Fire Frog's large eye, squinting at Yang Ji, revealed a cold sneer. With a croak, its vocal sac bulged, and its body instantly turned red like a branding iron.

It opened its mouth and spat out a stream of scorching flames, incinerating the incoming sword qi completely. It spat again, a continuous stream of flames forming a massive fiery tongue that licked "whoosh-whoosh" towards Yang Ji. Rolling flames roared, and wherever they passed, the air sizzled.

Yang Ji felt the temperature on his face rapidly rising, an intense burning sensation, as if his skin would crack at any moment. "Somewhat interesting." Yang Ji neither dodged nor retreated, smiling, "Then I shall fight fire with fire!" As he spread his palm, he summoned the Earth Spirit Fire. The terrifying high temperature created visible heat ripples in the surrounding air. Then, clenching his fist, he punched out. The fist, imbued with the destructive aura of the Earth Spirit Fire, directly shattered the incoming fiery tongue.

The Fire Frog's eyes turned cold, and the many putrid tumors on its back began to swell. Streams of blue mist erupted from them. Any vegetation touched by the blue mist immediately sizzled and instantly turned into black sludge.

"Such strong corrosiveness!" Yang Ji dared not be careless, continuously twirling his flying sword and unleashing streaks of sword qi. But as soon as they entered the blue mist, they were completely corroded away.

Yang Ji's expression sobered. He knew that ordinary sword techniques were useless against it. He immediately unleashed the Departure Sword Dao. With a single strike, countless sword qis, imbued with Fire Aspect Sword Intent, surged forth like a boundless galaxy, charging forward.

Fear appeared in the Fire Frog's eyes. It felt as if an invisible force from heaven and earth was fiercely pressing down on it. At this moment, it seemed to be facing not sword qi, but a raging inferno sweeping across the world. The Fire Frog knew that taking this sword would undoubtedly lead to its demise, but the sword qi had locked onto it, leaving it nowhere to hide. It immediately spat out flames, and the tumors on its back continuously spewed poison mist, attempting to counteract the sword qi. However, it underestimated the power of this strike.

Rip! The sword qi sliced through, instantly tearing it into pieces. Yang Ji immediately swept his sword across and extracted the demonic core.

The next moment, he felt a chilling sensation prick his back, as if he had been targeted by a primeval beast. He suddenly turned his head and saw a massive, two-zhang-long crocodile, entirely crimson with a pair of blood-red eyes, glaring at him ferociously from not far away.

"Hmm?" With a glance, Yang Ji instantly saw its information: [Level 10 Peak Lava Crocodile. Proficient in speed and strength.] Immediately, he raised his hand, pointing his long sword straight ahead, fearlessly responding to its provocation.

"Roar~" Seeing this, the Lava Crocodile roared in fury, its eyes filled with boundless killing intent. It immediately charged forward, its heavy footsteps making the ground tremble.

"Whoosh!" The Lava Crocodile was incredibly fast, closing in on Yang Ji in a few leaps. Its massive front paw lifted high, coming down directly to stomp on Yang Ji. The force of this stomp was enough to make an ordinary Qi Condensation Ninth Layer cultivator palpitate with fear, afraid to even breathe.

Yang Ji's gaze sharpened, but with a slight movement of his feet, several afterimages appeared as he easily dodged away. The Lava Crocodile was enraged and pursued relentlessly, constantly trying to bite with its huge maw and lash out with its thick tail. Yang Ji employed his Lightness Art, dodging the Lava Crocodile's attacks again and again.

He kept dodging, never parrying. This was Yang Ji's deliberate choice, wanting to train his adaptability under high pressure. Only by calmly dealing with different opponents and different methods could he deeply excavate his combat potential, accumulate battle experience, and thus gain the courage to face any enemy in the future. Therefore, in every battle, he would wholeheartedly and carefully observe, drawing experience.

As one pursued and the other fought, the Lava Crocodile was incomparably fierce. Seeing Yang Ji constantly fleeing, it was both enraged and smug. After a round of dodging, Yang Ji knew that with his current strength, even facing a Peak Level 10 demonic beast, his mind remained as still as water, utterly fearless.

Perhaps it was the powerful confidence granted by the Departure Sword Dao, he didn't feel much pressure at all and quickly adapted to the current chase rhythm. At that moment, he stopped dodging and made his move.

Whoosh! He unleashed the Lightness Art. As his figure swayed, several afterimages appeared. Just as the Lava Crocodile's massive tail lashed out, Yang Ji instantly deployed the Sword Qi Vortex from the Water Seeking Sword Art. Countless sword qis twisted and tangled, blocking the huge tail. Yang Ji's wrist twisted, and his flying sword fiercely thrashed within the sword qi vortex. The Lava Crocodile immediately performed a death roll to dispel the immense strangling force.

The Lava Crocodile's strength was truly immense. It instantly shattered the flying sword's hold and escaped the sword qi vortex. But just as it was about to furiously counterattack, an even more colossal sword qi, imbued with the brilliant Fire Aspect Sword Intent, struck and instantly tore it to pieces.

"The Departure Sword Dao is too powerful! Although I've only grasped a sliver of the Fire Aspect Sword Intent, using it against a Level 10 Lava Crocodile is simply an asymmetrical battle. One sword, still just one sword!" Yang Ji exclaimed in awe. At this moment, his heart was filled with an endless yearning for the other sword daos of the Gui Zang Sword Art. If all eight swords were gathered and the great divine ability formed, he wondered what terrifying power a single strike would unleash.

Without time for further thought, he quickly composed himself, picked up the Lava Crocodile's demonic core, and scanned his surroundings, looking for his next target. But the next moment, following a beast's roar from afar, all demonic beasts currently fighting human cultivators rapidly retreated like a tide.

In the distance, three majestic figures stood in mid-air. Gazing at the three fleeing Demon Kings, they did not pursue, but instead turned and appeared before the crowd.

"These demonic beasts delayed us for quite some time. Come, let's continue forward," True Monarch Ling Gu said, waving his hand. The group continued deeper into the underground world.

After passing through the stone forest, there were no more obstacles ahead, just a flat expanse. The group walked cautiously and soon reached the end of this underground world. There was no path forward. Only a group of ancient Qilong trees and Ghost-Face Mushrooms trembled at the very end.

"What's going on? Have we reached the end?" True Monarch Chi Huo frowned. Before them was a rock wall mixed with brown dirt, clearly indicating no further path.

"Outside, there's a spatial blocking formation; inside, there's a stone array blocking the path, and spiritual light shoots into the sky. Also, everyone picked up fragments of Adamantine Wood and other small items. It's impossible for there to be nothing down here." True Monarch Nan Kui furrowed his brow, immediately casting a spell to bombard the front. But the rock wall only crumbled away piece by piece, revealing nothing.

The crowd was frustrated, but at this moment, Yang Ji's heart was exceptionally agitated. As he gazed at the rock wall before him, information appeared in his eyes:

[Concealment Formation], [Spatial Teleportation Formation], [Cultivation Room], [Alchemy Room], [Herb Garden], [Flower Garden], [Kitchen], [Fish Pond].

[Place of Inheritance!]

Clearly, there was another world behind it! The reason everyone couldn't see it was because the Concealment Formation blocked their mortal eyes.

At this moment, Yang Ji stared intently at [Spatial Teleportation Formation], and soon more information appeared: [Teleportation Condition: A fated individual who has cultivated the first volume of the Humanoid Weapon to perfection.]

He then saw text inscribed on the surface of the Spatial Teleportation Formation: [My name is Fu Dongliu. To seek the path to breakthrough, I wandered the Four Seas and Eight Desolaces, and once cultivated here in seclusion for a thousand years. A legacy, comprehended here, left here. The Heavenly Dao cycles endlessly. A fated individual shall obtain it.]

"A fated individual? Am I not your fated individual?" Yang Ji's heart surged with excitement.

But his excitement quickly subsided, as more text appeared: [I have imprinted ten copies of the first volume of the Humanoid Weapon and cast them into various parts of the Endless Sea. Two hundred years from now, my Immortal Abode will open, and the legacy will emit a resonance. All who cultivate the Humanoid Weapon can follow the resonance and come to contend for it.]

[Left in — Immortalization Year 18.]

"Immortalization Year 18? A hundred years have passed already, so in another hundred years, the Immortal Abode will open, and the legacy will emit a resonance. Those who have cultivated the Humanoid Weapon will sense it and come to seize this opportunity?"

"But, man proposes, God disposes. This senior's Immortal Abode was directly cracked open by an earthquake. It's likely the residences inside were also affected; otherwise, fragments of Adamantine Wood wouldn't have flowed out. It must be that the spatial formation automatically repaired the breach."

"In that case, as long as I cultivate the Humanoid Weapon to perfection within these hundred years, I can claim it in advance without waiting for the legacy to emit a resonance, leaving latercomers utterly dumbfounded!"

Yang Ji's expression flickered slightly, his heart faintly stirring with excitement.
