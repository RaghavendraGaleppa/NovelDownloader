# Chapter 240: Pure New Life

The Cui family expert, half his body gone, was covered in blood from head to toe, struggling in agony. His spiritual consciousness twisted, covered by black flames, and instantly burned to ashes. He fell onto the grass, his death exceedingly miserable. The Cui family members were both shocked and apprehensive. Those black flames must be a type of Heavenlight Energy, capable of instantly destroying a Third Realm expert's mental force field.

"Who's there? Come out!" An elder of the Cui family stared in the direction where the grey figure disappeared.

The world had changed; the sun had been gone for thousands of years. Some aristocratic families had existed since the very beginning of "the Law," coexisting with the Immortal Path and the Esoteric Path. The Cui family was considered a veteran aristocratic family. Their goal was immortality, to coexist with all paths and become a truly evergreen family. The Cui family members present had originally been quite confident, but they had immediately experienced two horrifying spectacles.

In the distance, an old man in grey walked over, his wide sleeves billowing. The few dozen strands of hair remaining on his head also swayed. He was extremely aged, his face full of wrinkles. The Cui family members felt a warning sign. The New Life Path was very "age-dependent"; the more decrepit an old man looked, the more dangerous he often was.

"May I ask who you are?" Cui Cheng asked, trying his best to control his emotional fluctuations. The Cui family's losses this time were quite significant. The Cui family members all speculated, "Could this be an old monster from an Ancestral Court of the New Life Path?"

"An old man from the New Life Path, wasting away in the mortal world," Yu Gensheng said as he approached. He coldly scanned the Cui family members and said, "A thousand-year aristocratic family, what a grand aura. Instead of slaying demons, you're targeting your own kind here."

Cui Cheng smiled faintly, "Senior, you jest. Demons must naturally be purged, but this is merely a minor internal affair of my Cui family, not something that elevates to targeting our own."

*Bang!*

Yu Gensheng rushed forward, then flicked his wide sleeve, sending Cui Cheng flying through the air without touching him. In an instant, Cui Cheng vomited a large mouthful of blood, his spiritual consciousness nearly disintegrating. He was horrified. They were still some distance apart, and the opponent hadn't even touched him, yet those black flames, merely grazing him, possessed such power.

"Who's jesting now?" Yu Gensheng looked at him with a somber face. As he spoke, he pressed forward, saying, "Are you trying to talk your way out of this with me? Infighting, undermining others—you did it, yet you still won't admit it!"

"Fellow Daoist, let's talk this through!" Cui Changming spoke, stepping forward. Cui family members had either been killed or dealt with, leaving them all disgraced.

"Who's calling you a fellow Daoist? Stand aside!" Yu Gensheng was very angry. If he hadn't come, these people would surely have abducted Qin Ming, either killing him or crippling him in the end; there would have been no good outcome.

"Child, are you alright?" He looked at Qin Ming, instantly revealing a benevolent smile, his concern evident. The Cui family members felt a deep sense of disgust. So, this somber-faced old man could also smile, like a withered tree blooming in spring, sprouting branches and flowering, surprisingly radiant.

"Senior, I'm fine." Qin Ming felt a warmth in his heart. At this critical moment, it was an elder from the Mountains and Rivers Academy who had arrived.

"Are you really okay?" Yu Gensheng almost performed a bone examination on the spot, showing great care, concern, and nervousness for him.

Qin Ming nodded, "Yes, they traveled a thousand li to deliver their heads, with true scriptures as a bonus. I'm perfectly fine."

Instantly, the Cui family members' eyes turned sharp and cold. Yu Gensheng, on the other hand, breathed a sigh of relief. He and Zhao Ziyuan had just witnessed all of this firsthand and were truly enraged. At the same time, he felt a wave of fear. A similar tragedy had occurred over a hundred years ago, and he absolutely would not allow history to repeat itself.

The Cui family members watched from the side, their faces ashen, silent. Their hearts were filled with overwhelming grievance and fury. This old man had killed two of them, and after walking over, he directly challenged them. He was a bit too overbearing.

"Are you hiding over there, planning to make your move at an opportune moment?" Yu Gensheng turned his head, looking not far away. Some Cui family members were still hidden, concealed in the grassy plain under the night mist, but they couldn't hide from an old senior of the New Life Path.

Yu Gensheng, like a night bird streaking across the sky, instantly appeared in front, grabbing an elder of the Cui family and pulling him out.

"You... let go of me." Though also an elder, he was powerless to resist, held in the opponent's hand like a chick. In an instant, black light flowed around Yu Gensheng, one stream after another. A large black hand, constructed from Heavenlight, formed and *poof*, squeezed the Cui family elder into an explosion.

The Cui family members were alarmed and enraged. This old man truly had no sense of propriety, acting unscrupulously, and had killed another one of them.

Cui Changming said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoist, you're going too far. Our Cui family doesn't seek trouble, but we don't fear it either. There are still some grand experts in our clan who can defend against foreign enemies!"

Yu Gensheng said, "He intended to secretly assassinate a rising star of my New Life Path. His death is well-deserved. Tell me, which of the three I killed did not deserve to die?"

The Cui family had always been powerful, but the wretched old man they encountered today was even more domineering than them. Not to mention the first two who died, the third person was merely lying in wait and was crushed to death!

"He didn't make a move!" Cui Cheng interjected.

Yu Gensheng said indifferently, "Should this old man wait until he successfully ambushes and kills a genius of my New Life Path before counterattacking?" He pointed to the memory crystal on his body, "Your previous expressions have all been recorded. Even if I killed all of you, it wouldn't be unjust!"

"Who exactly are you?!" Cui Changming couldn't hold back. As a grand expert with one foot already in the Fourth Realm, his liver qi surged. The Cui family had been bullied like this—it hadn't happened in a long time.

"Do you still want to fight me? This old man is Yu Gensheng from Mountains and Rivers Academy." He stated his name.

Cui Changming's expression changed. So Qin Ming had joined an academy in Kunling, not one of those major sect ancestral courts. In his opinion, this was indeed a wise choice. Those ancestral courts were quickly becoming training grounds for the descendants of certain elders and major clans. After the Patriarchs of various sects emerged from their seclusion, they were all extremely enraged, wishing they could tear everything down and start anew. If a newcomer truly entered such a place without aristocratic family support or the favor of an ancestral court elder, they wouldn't be able to make any waves. If they were to discover he had mastered the Silk Scripture Art, it was estimated that some elders would desire it even more than the Cui family. It was suspected that the various academies in Kunling had Patriarchs supporting them from behind, intending to start anew. In fact, such things also occurred in the Outer Lands and among the Esoteric Sects. Some major clans had long sent their disciples into different orthodoxies to ensure the prosperity of their own clans. In the past, there had been a thousand-year aristocratic family that was annihilated, but their people emerged from the Outer Lands, raised their banner anew, and revived the clan.

"Do you want to gauge this old man's strength?" Yu Gensheng asked.

Cui Changming immediately shook his head, "No, I truly admire you, Senior from Kunling Academy. You are a pure cultivator, unlike the major ancestral courts, which are so... complicated!"

Yu Gensheng shook his head, "Your words aren't sincere; they're clearly full of hostility."

Cui Changming thought to himself: You've killed members of my clan, and I'm not allowed to feel immense hatred? He had already realized that he was far from this person's match.

At this moment, Zhao Ziyuan also appeared, similarly decrepit, walking over with his wide sleeves billowing.

"Senior!" Qin Ming immediately bowed in greeting.

"It's good that you're fine," Zhao Ziyuan smiled gently. Then, he turned to look ahead, saying, "Old Yu, you've already killed half of them. Are you keeping the remaining three?"

"I'll... rub dirt!" The remaining three Cui family members cursed inwardly, feeling horrified. Were these two planning to annihilate them all here? They should have been the ones to be strong throughout, but the encounter today had filled their chests with such vexation and indignation that they felt like spitting blood.

Cui Changming said, "Seniors, my Cui family has true top experts stationed on the plateau. We've already sent a message. Even if we die, the news will still be sent back."

"Are you threatening us?" Zhao Ziyuan spoke.

Yu Gensheng said, "The Cui family is populous. As a thousand-year aristocratic family, your direct descendants alone occupy a giant city. A few of you dying is nothing. This old man made a move today merely to express an attitude: do not touch the people we value, the prodigies of the New Life Path, Cui family."

Zhao Ziyuan nodded, "Otherwise, since your Cui family has so many people, if we retaliate madly, we definitely won't suffer a loss!"

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming's blood felt somewhat hot. These two elders, for his sake, did not hesitate to utter such words, to confront the Cui family directly, even to clash head-on. This deeply moved him!

"Two seniors, let's put this matter behind us today. We'll leave immediately!" Cui Cheng spoke.

"Half of them are already dead. I don't think we should 'abandon it halfway'," Yu Gensheng said.

"Let me!" Zhao Ziyuan moved like a specter, instantly teleporting across the grassland. With a *boom*, he spread his wide sleeve, smashing Cui Cheng into smithereens.

"You..." Another elder was utterly terrified. The Cui family's golden reputation was useless; someone wanted to annihilate them completely.

Zhao Ziyuan was as fast as lightning, arriving in an instant. The surrounding space blurred, trapping the elder. He seemed to twist the force field, instantly turning the elder into a mass of bloody mud.

"Please stop, seniors! I will represent the Cui family and negotiate with you!" Cui Changming shouted, cold sweat beading on his forehead. He had never imagined such a situation would arise.

"You're not qualified enough to negotiate with us!" Yu Gensheng said.

Zhao Ziyuan said, "Killing you all today is merely to demonstrate our stance!"

Cui Changming fled, but Yu Gensheng was as swift as lightning. Black flame Heavenlight enveloped him, seemingly transforming into an abyss, sealing him within.

Zhao Ziyuan said, "It's settled. Leave the rest to me."

"Alright, here you go." Yu Gensheng flicked his black flame Heavenlight, and the disfigured Cui Changming flew horizontally. With a *bang*, while still in mid-air, he was torn to shreds by Zhao Ziyuan's distorted force field, turning into a rain of blood.

Qin Ming was dumbfounded. Several powerful enemies who had posed a life-or-death threat to him had vanished completely in the blink of an eye. The formidable strength of these two old seniors was evident! At this moment, he yearned immensely to grow stronger and truly seize control of his own destiny.

After calming down, he sighed again. The two elders had done too much for him, which might be very disadvantageous for themselves. He knew very well that the Cui family was actually extremely powerful, with terrifying foundations. The two elders alone were not enough to face a thousand-year aristocratic family.

"It's fine, don't worry about us. Those with nothing to lose don't fear those who have everything. Their family has a large business; if they provoke us, we can casually pierce through one of their territories, and it will cause them immense pain for a long time."

"That's right, the two of us don't have many years left. What is there to fear?!" The two old men said, both looking nonchalant.

Qin Ming looked at their aged and withered bodies, a slight ache in his heart. He said, "Two seniors..."

"Child, you don't need to say anything more!"

"Alas, over a hundred years ago, the Heaven-endowed Overlord died tragically, mercilessly killed by Cao Qianqiu. We were powerless to stop it because we didn't have that level of strength. In this era, we've seen hope again. Now that a good seedling like you has appeared, we absolutely won't allow such a thing to happen again. We'll protect you even if it costs us our old lives!"
