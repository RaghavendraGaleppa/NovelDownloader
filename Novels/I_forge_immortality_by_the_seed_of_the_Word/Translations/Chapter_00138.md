# Chapter 136: The Descent of the Upper Realm Immortal, Feng Wuyu

"Move to Longhu Dao Academy?"

Zhang Jing's eyes narrowed slightly before he shook his head.

While that would ensure safety, what about their daily lives? They couldn't possibly interact with academy disciples every day.

"Dean, is there somewhere safe where ordinary people can live? After all, they're mortals. Moving into the academy would be quite inconvenient for them," Zhang Jing asked solemnly.

"Haha, that was my oversight. In that case, there's a mortal city two hundred miles from Longhu Dao Academy where many nobles from Nanli reside. Your family can move there, and the academy can respond immediately if anything happens."

"Thank you for your consideration, Dean."

Zhang Jing smiled in response.

"Don't mention it! Zhang Jing, you've rendered great service to the academy. I guarantee that every generation of the Zhang family will have members admitted to Longhu Dao Academy. Especially your younger brother and sister—when they come of age and can cultivate, I'll personally bring them into the academy and nurture them carefully."

The dean's tone was resolute.

Hearing this, Zhang Jing fell into thought before replying with a smile:

"Dean, I don't know when I'll return, so I'll entrust my family to your care. However—"

He paused, recalling his last visit home.

"If my younger brother and sister wish to remain mortals, let them be. If they desire to cultivate, then I'll trouble you, Dean. These are the resources I've prepared for them—please deliver them when the time comes."

Zhang Jing placed a storage bag on the table beside him.

Without waiting for the dean's response, he continued, his tone suddenly turning indifferent:

"As for your kind offer regarding the Zhang family, I appreciate it. But as the saying goes, 'A gentleman's influence lasts five generations,' and the path of immortality is no exception. Please watch over them for 150 years, then let them fend for themselves."

Zhang Jing knew how much benefit his foundation in the Dao would bring to the academy, so he didn't decline the offer.

The dean gave him a surprised look.

"Ah—"

He sighed deeply, then took the storage bag and said slowly:

"I understand. You may set your mind at ease and ascend to the upper realm."

Ten days remained until the immortal's descent.

A faint atmosphere of joy began to permeate Longhu Dao Academy. Arrays unfolded, their dazzling spiritual light shooting into the clouds, drawing curious discussions from uninformed outer disciples.

Meanwhile, on Zhang Jing's immortal island.

Senior Brother Li looked around with envy, marveling at the spiritual energy that was even denser than in his own cave abode. He couldn't imagine how rich the energy must be in the cultivation chambers. Was this the treatment inner disciples received?

Ahead of him, Lu Thirty-Eight led the way, chattering:

"Senior Brother, we're almost there. Mind the spirit herbs I planted—the master is waiting up ahead."

"Understood. Thank you for the reminder."

Senior Brother Li responded politely, his gaze lingering on the deer with mixed emotions. Following Zhang Jing had brought this creature great fortune—in just a few months, its cultivation had reached the ninth level of Qi Refinement. And it was still an outer disciple!

Soon, they arrived.

"Junior Brother Li, these are some cultivation resources," Zhang Jing said, flicking his finger to send a storage bag floating toward the seated senior brother. "Please distribute them according to the list in the jade slip."

The bag contained a small portion of the resources Zhang Jing had exchanged for when leaving the Myriad Gods Minor Heaven. They were of no use to him now, perfect for settling karmic debts.

Zhang Jing didn't know if karma truly existed in this world, but it was better to err on the side of caution.

Senior Brother Li probed the bag with his spiritual sense, then looked up in shock.

"Senior Brother Zhang, this is...?"

"Repayment for those in the outer academy who showed me kindness, however small."

Zhang Jing smiled.

As Senior Brother Li scanned the jade slip, names appeared one after another—Li Hong, Zhang Yangchu, Ji Bochang, Tong Yao... Each name had corresponding resources listed beside it. His own name topped the list, with the reward being Enlightenment Tea!

Senior Brother Li's eyes reddened instantly.

He knew the legends of Enlightenment Tea—a single sip could induce a state of enlightenment, an almost miraculous effect. Originally, he had no hope of entering the inner academy. But with this, perhaps there was still a chance. His fate might change!

After a long silence, he wiped his eyes and asked:

"Senior Brother Zhang, why...?"

"I'll be ascending to the upper realm soon, so I'm entrusting this task to you."

Zhang Jing's eyes were deep as an abyss, his tone calm.

"Understood. I'll complete this promptly," Senior Brother Li said solemnly, showing no surprise at the news of Zhang Jing's ascension.

In his heart, Zhang Jing's talent was peerless, perhaps unmatched in history. It was only natural that the upper realm would take notice. That realm of gods and prodigies was where Zhang Jing truly belonged.

"Thank you."

With that, all arrangements were complete.

Zhang Jing sat in meditation, awaiting the immortal's descent.

Ten days passed in tranquility.

On this day, above Dragon Marsh Lake.

Bronze divine light suddenly appeared, dyeing the sky for hundreds of miles in an instant.

Oppressive! Terrifying!

The heavens seemed to transform into a bronze cauldron lid, exuding immense weight.

Then, a divine figure wreathed in bronze light descended above Longhu Dao Academy.

Below, the dean, pavilion masters, and inner disciples who had been waiting immediately prostrated themselves, calling out reverently:

"Longhu Dao Academy welcomes the descent of the upper realm immortal!"

Among them, only Zhang Jing remained standing, unable to move except for his neck. He looked up to see the bronze-clad immortal wink at him, while a young, amused voice sounded in his mind:

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, I'm Feng Wuyu, here to bring you to the Clear Void Mysterious Bright Heaven. And you mustn't kneel—this senior brother can't accept that."

Before Zhang Jing could react, a solemn voice echoed across the land:

"Rise. There's no need for such formalities."

"Thank you, Immortal!"

The crowd rose to their feet, their voices filled with awe.
