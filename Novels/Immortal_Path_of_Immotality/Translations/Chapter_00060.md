# Chapter 60: Talisman Sword

Lin Shan was overwhelmed with regret and self-reproach! He could have immediately unleashed his mid-grade magic artifact from the start, seizing the initiative with overwhelming force. 

But his desire to conceal his true strength had made him careless, allowing Princess Guo to shrewdly turn the tables on him.

As he recovered from another bout of soul-piercing pain, Lin Shan saw the ice serpent lunging toward him and shouted, "Hold her off!"

Huang the Adept, who had been contemplating escape when the ice serpent abandoned him and Princess Guo ignored him, hesitated briefly at Lin Shan's shout. Realizing they were in the same boat—without Lin Shan, he wouldn't escape either—he commanded his luminous moth to attack Princess Guo while casting an earthen prison spell to trap her.

Sensing the surge of earth energy beneath her feet, Princess Guo swiftly dodged, firing ice spikes at the moth while conjuring another ice mirror for defense. 

The brief delay Huang created allowed Lin Shan to retreat over a dozen steps, finally escaping Princess Guo's control range. Estimating they were now about 20 meters apart, Lin Shan viciously activated his Frostiron Sword, which instantly blazed with blue light.

Princess Guo paled in shock. She tried to activate her Soulstartle Bell but found Lin Shan already beyond its ten-meter range. As she moved to close the distance, a blue sword aura shot toward her.

"Boom! Crash—"

The ice mirror shattered once more.

"Hiss—"

The ice serpent dispersed under the blow.

"Pfft—"

Princess Guo was sent flying again, another mouthful of blood staining her lips. This time, the glow of her defensive robes visibly dimmed. She trembled inwardly—how could this brat's mid-grade artifact be so powerful?

Little did she know, Lin Shan's Frostiron Sword was no ordinary artifact. Anything enhanced by his system was exceptional among its peers!

Lin Shan gave Princess Guo no quarter, stepping forward to maintain the twenty-meter distance before launching another sword strike.

"Bang! Crash—"

The ice mirror shattered again, and Princess Guo was sent tumbling like a ball. Huang seized the opportunity to send his moth after her, kicking her while she was down.

Princess Guo summoned another ice serpent from her jade pendant to intercept the moth while futilely erecting another ice mirror. Just then, another blue sword aura arrived on schedule.

Lin Shan advanced methodically, ensuring Princess Guo had no chance to use her Soulstartle Bell against him again.

Today, he would crush her with sheer range and artifact superiority!

Lin Shan hardened his heart. So what if she was a beautiful princess? Today, he would kill her no matter what!

Princess Guo was sent flying once more but proved tenacious. As her robes' glow faded further, she fled southwest, likely seeking her allies.

Lin Shan pursued relentlessly, hacking at her as he ran. After a hundred meters and three more sword strikes, Princess Guo's robes were nearly destroyed, leaving a trail of shattered ice mirrors as they entered another battlefield.

A black-robed nun was being overwhelmed by a richly dressed man. Spotting Lin Shan and Princess Guo, she cried out in relief. But Huang, upon seeing the fight, gasped in horror: "A Talisman Sword?!"

Lin Shan was baffled. Ahead, a middle-aged man in brocade stood calmly, a gray shadow—a dagger-sized sword—streaking around him like lightning. 

Swordflight combat? Impossible! 

Lin Shan gaped. This was a feat only possible for Foundation Establishment cultivators with externalized divine sense! Yet the man's aura was clearly only mid Qi Refining.

The black-robed nun defended with a ritual bowl, casting watery rings around herself while launching explosive bubbles from talismans. The bubbles detonated violently when the flying sword pierced them—likely the source of the earlier explosions.

Lin Shan was stunned. The brocade-clad man was dominating the fight with just his flying sword. The veiled woman was nowhere to be seen—dead or fled.

Before Lin Shan could finish off Princess Guo, Huang dragged him away desperately. "Run! That's a Talisman Sword! If we don't leave now, we won't get another chance!"

Lin Shan resisted, unwilling to abandon his kill. Princess Guo was defenseless—just two or three more strikes! Why was Huang so terrified of the Talisman Sword? Even if it was powerful, couldn't the three of them take the man together?

Huang yanked him harder. "Go! That thing's like a flying sword—it outranges you!"

Lin Shan's blood ran cold. A flying sword? 

He sheathed his weapon and fled northwest with Huang without another word. Behind them, the nun shrieked, "Fellow Daoists Lin! Huang!" They ignored her—mere acquaintances weren't worth dying for.

The brocade-clad man, initially composed, was shocked to see Princess Guo's battered state. How had his ally, armed with multiple artifacts and vast combat experience, been reduced to this?

He intensified his assault on the nun, eager to finish her quickly.

As they fled, Lin Shan boosted their speed with a wind-controlling spell and questioned Huang. "What's a Talisman Sword? How can it mimic swordflight?"

Huang, catching his breath, explained: "It's a sword controlled by talismans—like a remote-controlled toy. The talisman acts as the controller, the sword as the vehicle. No divine sense needed—Qi Refining cultivators can manipulate it through the talisman."

Some ancient genius had invented this fusion of talisman and sword, creating an overpowered weapon for Qi Refining cultivators.

"So it's invincible in Qi Refining?" Lin Shan exclaimed.

"Not quite," Huang said. "Talisman Swords have limited uses and are exorbitantly expensive. Some are made from low-grade artifacts—your mid-grade sword could snap them in a direct clash."

Lin Shan frowned. "What about that man's sword?"

Huang didn't answer. Whatever its grade, the flying sword made him a sitting duck. Lin Shan might survive, but he wouldn't.

Self-preservation won out—Huang prioritized escape.

Lin Shan pondered but didn't blame Huang. Against a freely controlled flying sword, his Frostiron Sword's fixed trajectory was a disadvantage.

"How far can Talisman Swords reach?" Lin Shan asked.

"At least seven zhang," Huang said gravely.

Lin Shan calculated—over twenty meters, beyond his own range. If possible, he'd get one for himself.

But the enemy had more forces. Besides Princess Guo and the brocade-clad man, allies were engaged with the green-robed elder and hook-nosed man east of the stream. 

For now, distance was safety.
