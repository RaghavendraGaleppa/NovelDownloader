# Chapter 88: Fellow Townsfolk Meet Again

"Are you Lin Shan?"  
"Lin... Lin Fan?"  

The two asked each other tentatively, confirming what they had already suspected, both feeling a sense of surrealism at the twists of fate. After all, the wondrous feeling of encountering an old acquaintance in a foreign land was truly rare.  

The royal family's Foundation Establishment elder standing nearby felt his heart sink at this exchange. He had a vague premonition that tonight's affairs no longer concerned him—this young man not only had connections with Left Perfected Master but also ties to someone from the Violet Thunder Sect.  

Thundercloud Master turned his head slightly and asked with curiosity, "Oh? You two know each other?"  

Lin Fan, his face alight with excitement, replied, "Yes! Senior Brother, the man below is my clansman from the mortal world!"  

Without hesitation, he leaped down from the purple thundercloud and hurried to Lin Shan's side. Radiating the excitement of someone who had achieved success far from home and now had a chance to show off before a fellow townsman, he grabbed Lin Shan's arm and pulled him along.  

"Haha, who would've thought our Lin Family of Qinghe County would produce two cultivators at once! Come, we haven't seen each other in years—we must catch up properly!"  

Lin Shan, however, was utterly bewildered. While it was true they were clansmen, their relationship had never been particularly close. Moreover, Lin Fan had once taken the fall for him...  

Still, this was indeed a good opportunity to extricate himself from his current predicament. Fellow townsfolk supporting each other in a foreign land was perfectly reasonable, so he didn't resist and followed Lin Fan onto Thundercloud Master's thundercloud.  

The purple thundercloud beneath their feet—whether it was a magical artifact or a spell condensed by Thundercloud Master—felt soft and spongy. Lin Shan couldn't help but worry it might conduct electricity, given that he had been struck by lightning in his past life...  

For Lin Fan's sake, Thundercloud Master gave Lin Shan a slight nod before casually addressing the royal family's Foundation Establishment elder:  

"This man is an old friend of my junior brother. Fellow Daoist, do me this small favor and let the matter rest here."  

Without waiting for the elder's response, he activated the purple thundercloud, carrying all three of them toward the imperial palace.  

The royal elder's face darkened slightly, his lips moving as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he swallowed his words. Thundercloud Master's arrogant demeanor was indeed overbearing, yet no one present found it inappropriate. After all, as a true disciple of one of the three great sects, he was a figure of lofty status. Whom he chose to protect was entirely his prerogative, and the royal elder could only grit his teeth and accept it.  

Moreover, the elder had already been in a difficult position due to Left Perfected Master's reputation. Now that the Violet Thunder Sect had forcefully intervened, he had no choice but to swallow his pride and pretend to be doing them a favor.  

The rogue cultivators present all secretly breathed sighs of relief—their lives were spared for today. The feeling of being at the mercy of others was truly nerve-wracking.  

*Never spectate again—bystanders are prone to collateral damage!*  

They immediately scattered in all directions, fearing the humiliated royal elder might vent his frustration on them. They fled faster than rabbits.  

Three breaths later, only seven figures remained on the surrounding rooftops—all cultivators from the Great Song's royal and princely families. They watched their Foundation Establishment ancestor nervously, not daring to make a sound. Princess Guo was among them.  

The royal elder swept a cold gaze over them, lingering particularly on Princess Guo, before realizing someone was missing.  

"Where is that brat from Prince Qi's residence?"  

The others exchanged glances, looking at Princess Guo, as she was the closest to the Prince Qi's heir.  

But Princess Guo, knowing she had caused a disaster—not only losing the Great Yan princess but also making the royal elder lose face before the entire capital—trembled in fear. If she were to mention the Prince Qi heir's condition now, she would be in even deeper trouble!  

Fortunately, a late Qi Refinement youth from the royal family stepped forward on her behalf.  

"Honored Ancestor, the Prince Qi heir has been gravely ill these past days. Even the imperial physicians couldn't cure him. It's said he doesn't have long to live..."  

The royal elder's face darkened further. With a flick of his sleeve, he led the group toward Prince Qi's residence.  

---  

This was Lin Shan's first time entering the imperial palace, and he eagerly glanced around, hoping to catch a glimpse of the legendary three thousand beauties of the inner palace or perhaps a bathing imperial consort. Lin Fan, seeming to read his mind, said dryly:  

"Stop looking. The important palaces are all shielded by barriers."  

He gave Lin Shan a look that said, *I've already tried.* Lin Shan reluctantly stopped peering around and followed Thundercloud Master to the grand hall deep within the palace.  

Soon after, Thundercloud Master departed, leaving the two juniors to their own devices—a Foundation Establishment cultivator had little to discuss with two youngsters.  

Lin Fan led Lin Shan to a side hall, where they sat down and began catching up.  

Meeting an old friend in a foreign land naturally led to endless conversation.  

Lin Shan briefly recounted his journey after leaving the Lin Manor—venturing to Zangke County, then to the capital, and finally to Yichuan. He omitted sensitive details, such as the brothel's demonic sect matron and the divine ability, *Seven Arrows Book of the Nail Head*.  

Lin Fan, however, opened the floodgates of storytelling, vividly narrating his far more thrilling adventures over the years.  

First, he encountered Thunder Roar Master, a direct disciple of the Violet Thunder Sect, passing through the Lin Manor. Discovering Lin Fan's dual spiritual roots of metal and thunder, Thunder Roar Master immediately brought him back to the sect, where he was accepted into the main lineage under the sect master.  

The Violet Thunder Sect comprised dozens of peaks, each representing a distinct lineage of cultivation. It was this diversity and unity that had elevated the sect to its current prominence.  

The main lineage, from which sect masters were traditionally chosen, cultivated the sect's treasured canon, *Purple Qi Heart Sutra*, specializing in thunder techniques and housing the sect's most powerful divine abilities.  

Lin Fan's extraordinary thunder spiritual root secured his place in the main lineage.  

After just a year and a half of cultivation in the Violet Thunder Sect—relying solely on absorbing spiritual energy without any medicinal aids—he progressed from the first to the ninth level of Qi Refinement, reaching perfection! The speed of his advancement left Lin Shan green with envy.  

Subsequently, Lin Fan's elders instructed him to descend the mountain and temper himself in the mortal world, seeking his own opportunities before returning to attempt Foundation Establishment.  

From then on, Lin Fan seemed to have unlocked cheat codes.  

He first traveled to the Western Desert, where he unearthed an ancient buried city—the ruins of a long-lost cultivation market.  

Next, passing through the Qinling Mountains, he discovered a Buddhist cave filled with the relics of enlightened monks.  

Later, while crossing the Longyou Great River, he stumbled upon an ancient underwater palace.  

Then, traversing the Yan-Yun Mountain Range, he accidentally wandered into the ruins of a sect lost to the annals of history.  

...  

Lin Fan recounted one miraculous encounter after another, each tale more fantastical than the last. Lin Shan listened as if hearing myths.  

*Is this guy for real? Does having "Fan" in his name really grant him such absurd luck?*  

Lin Shan found it hard to believe, but recalling Lin Fan's history of stumbling upon treasures—like the time he fell off a cliff in the mortal world—he wavered between skepticism and awe.  

After talking for what felt like ages, Lin Fan finally seemed to tire. But seeing how thoroughly he had impressed Lin Shan, he felt immensely satisfied.  

Lin Shan, however, had questions. "How did Thunder Roar Master know you had dual spiritual roots when he passed by the Lin Manor?"  

Lin Fan produced a disc-shaped artifact, explaining that major sects had specialized tools to detect spiritual roots when scouting for talents in the mortal world. As a disciple, he naturally carried one—standard issue for all sect members.  

Activating it, he tested Lin Shan.  

The disc was divided into eight sections, representing the five basic elements (metal, wood, water, fire, earth) and three derived variants (wind, thunder, ice).  

Five concentric rings indicated the grades of spiritual roots: innate (A, B, C, D) and acquired (five tiers).  

After a brief flicker, two sections lit up—the third ring glowing cyan and purple. Lin Fan nodded.  

"Not bad—mid-tier aptitude. Wind spiritual root, grade C. Thunder spiritual root... also grade C."  

Lin Shan stared at the disc in amazement. *I actually have a thunder spiritual root?*
