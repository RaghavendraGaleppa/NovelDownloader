**Chapter 20: Mission Area**  

Glancing at Yu Banxia, he was still standing by the bookshelf, struggling to make a choice.  

The dilemma lay in selecting a spell—too advanced, and as beginners, they might not grasp it anytime soon. Too basic, and the exchange price would be too low, making the reward feel wasted.  

Fortunately, Jiang Li had fewer worries in this regard.  

He patted the small pouch in his arms, where twenty-one spirit stones rested quietly.  

Two bottles of Qi-Nourishing Pills cost two spirit stones each, while two bottles of Qi-Restoring Pills cost one spirit stone each. He had traded them with Yan Hong for six spirit stones, adding to his original fifteen, bringing the total to twenty-one.  

After his breakthrough, Yan Hong had helped him inquire about the prices of techniques in the Scripture Pavilion. The most basic elemental techniques could cost less than ten spirit stones.  

Jiang Li confirmed this upon arrival.  

When selecting *Seed Puppet Corpse Art*, he had aimed for the most expensive option. But for the Yin and Wood attribute shelves, he focused on the cheapest rows—anything more advanced was beyond his budget.  

Without much hesitation, he picked one technique from each shelf and brought them to the counter for Elder Li.  

Elder Li glanced at him briefly.  

"Twenty spirit stones."  

Jiang Li’s pouch instantly deflated, leaving only a lonely spirit stone behind.  

Elder Li casually collected the stones—such a meager amount hardly mattered to him—and handed over three jade slips.  

Now at the Qi Refining stage, Jiang Li could use spiritual energy to activate the jade slips. Sitting on a nearby cushion, he pressed each slip to his forehead, channeling his energy to absorb the information.  

After using all three, his mind felt slightly swollen but no longer dizzy like the first time.  

Returning the slips, he saw Yu Banxia finally make his choice.  

"See you later."  

"See you."  

They parted ways without discussing their selections, maintaining an unspoken understanding.  

Instead of returning to his dorm or testing his new techniques, Jiang Li headed to the outer sect’s functional area—home to both the trading and mission zones.  

He entered the trading area first.  

The trading zone was vast but disorganized. Aside from proper shops, many disciples laid out cloths on the ground, setting up makeshift stalls like a night market. This made the area lively but chaotic.  

Stall prices were slightly lower than shops, attracting frugal disciples. Bargaining was common, and Jiang Li occasionally joined in.  

But more often, he wandered aimlessly, casting his Level 3 *Appraisal Skill* at everything in sight.  

Most items here were mundane—weapons for mortal martial artists, animal hides, bones, and organs, often byproducts of missions.  

Pills, artifacts, and fragmented manuals occasionally appeared, but half were either broken or fake.  

No one was foolish enough to sell valuable items openly. Still, security was decent—no theft or robbery occurred under the watchful eyes of the Law Enforcement Hall.  

"Yan Hong, how’s business today?"  

Deep in the market, Jiang Li found his round-faced friend.  

Yan Hong ran a modest stall, dabbling in buying and selling. His wares—basic pills and materials—were common, attracting few customers.  

"Haha, Jiang Li! Today’s been good. I’m planning to officially open next month."  

Yan Hong waved a notebook filled with names and numbers. His "success" wasn’t in profits but in gathered market data.  

For days, he and his nineteen subordinates had scoured the trading zone, recording prices and trends.  

"You’re a born merchant. Next month, their stipends can serve as startup funds—no need to split with me. Just don’t neglect your Qi Refining progress."  

Yan Hong’s passion for commerce had only grown since joining the sect. Jiang Li supported him—a merchant ally would be invaluable for resources.  

"Don’t worry, I’ve got an upper-grade spiritual root. By the way, did you pick any techniques? Need anything special?"  

Jiang Li thought for a moment.  

"Are there zombies for sale here? And their prices?"  

Yan Hong blinked, flipping through his notes.  

"Zombies exist, but they’re bulky and in low demand here. Only two shops sell them, and they’re low-grade but expensive. Not worth it."  

"Then keep an eye out for zombie-capturing or crafting methods. Also, look for seeds of spiritual trees or materials—no rush, just good deals."  

Yan Hong noted the requests.  

"See you later. I’m heading to the mission area."  

After two hours of *Appraisal Skill* grinding, Jiang Li moved on. The skill’s slow progress frustrated him, but he had no choice.  

His meager stipend wasn’t enough—he needed to earn more. Without crafting skills, missions were his best bet.  

Even non-cultivators could take missions here. As a Qi Refining beginner, he had no excuse.  

The mission hall was a bustling space, its atmosphere tense compared to the trading zone. Disciples here were hardened, some returning bloodied or hauling monstrous prey.  

Missions were divided by difficulty: early, mid, and late Qi Refining.  

Jiang Li assessed himself—new to Qi Refining, no mastered techniques, only a martial artist’s physique. His recovery abilities, bolstered by his status, were his sole advantage.  

Humbly, he approached the early-stage board.

Jiang Li sighed. *"I’m just an average guy."*  

He resigned himself to the early-stage board.
