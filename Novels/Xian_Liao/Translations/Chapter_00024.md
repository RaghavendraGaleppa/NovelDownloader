# Chapter 24: Pure Blessing

The stretcher was placed in the courtyard. Butcher Hu instructed his two apprentices to guard the gate and not enter.

Having practiced the Five Animal Frolics for a long time, Zhou Qing's understanding of human anatomy had deepened considerably. Especially after mastering the Tiger and Deer forms, his knowledge of joints, muscles, and bones in the limbs had become particularly profound.

As soon as Butcher Hu's stretcher was set down, Zhou Qing crouched and examined his legs. He quickly understood—Butcher Hu's tendons were severed and bones broken.

Yet Butcher Hu grinned through the pain, "Young Master Zhou, don't worry about old Hu here. At worst, I'll just use two crutches from now on. My life is tough, and I've benefited from your grace—I won't die."

Zhou Qing said solemnly, "Brother Hu, I'll find a way to get a doctor to heal your legs. What exactly happened?"

Butcher Hu replied, "It was the Fierce Tiger Gang."

"Is the Fierce Tiger Gang connected to Scholar Zhang's family?" Zhou Qing pondered.

Butcher Hu nodded. "The Fierce Tiger Gang is an outside gang. A few days ago, their leader went to offer incense at the Golden Light Temple outside the city. When Scholar Zhang passed the provincial exam, the temple he visited to give thanks was also the Golden Light Temple. Since then, the Zhang family has been a major patron of the temple."

"Why did they attack you?"

"Because they tripled the protection fees—not just for my butcher shop, but for the entire Slum Alley. If they succeed, the people there won't be able to survive." Butcher Hu explained.

Protection fees were extortion money collected by gangs. Normally, places like Slum Alley didn't pay much, as there was little profit to be squeezed. Zhou Qing's former self had paid them too.

But even a small amount tripled was significant. Moreover, the people in Slum Alley were already struggling to survive. With rising grain prices in the city and an influx of beggars and refugees increasing the labor supply, wages had dropped, making life even harder for the residents.

The Fierce Tiger Gang was clearly trying to push the people of Slum Alley to the brink.

"Did they say the increased fees had something to do with me?"

"There were such rumors."

"I see."

The whole picture became clear to Zhou Qing. Whether the Zhang family knew he had killed the monk they sent or whether the Fierce Tiger Gang acted on its own to curry favor with them, their move targeted Zhou Qing's weak spot.

If the people of Slum Alley were driven to desperation because of Zhou Qing, their hatred wouldn't be directed at the Fierce Tiger Gang or the oppressive Zhang family—it would be aimed at Zhou Qing.

Having lived in Slum Alley for years, a tarnished reputation there would severely damage his standing among scholars.

As public opinion worsened, keeping his scholar status would be difficult, let alone participating in the provincial exams. Candidates needed guarantors, and with a poor reputation, who would vouch for him?

Butcher Hu clearly understood this and had stepped forward despite the consequences.

"So how did the Fierce Tiger Gang leave?"

"That was thanks to your face, Young Master Zhou."

"My face?"

Zhou Qing first ruled out the Lin family. Given how the Zhang boy treated Miss Lin, it was unlikely the gang retreated because of them.

As for why Zhou Qing knew the gang had left—Butcher Hu was still alive. If they hadn't, Butcher Hu would have lost his life, not just his legs. Zhou Qing knew Butcher Hu had a fierce streak. Bound by shared fate, he had no other choice.

For those at the bottom to rise, risking their lives was often the only option. The worst was not even having that chance.

If not the Lin family, then perhaps Prefectural Examiner Lu's side—or more likely, his brother-in-law's family, the Wangs?

Wang Hai?

The name made Zhou Qing pause. He hadn't seen Wang Hai since the day after the exams.

"Was it Wang Hai, the nephew of the examiner and son of the Wang family?" Zhou Qing asked Butcher Hu.

"Master" was an honorific for the examiner.

"Yes. Young Master Wang had just returned from out of town and didn't know you'd moved, so he went to Slum Alley looking for you. He happened upon the situation and intervened. But he was a bit late—my legs couldn't be saved." Butcher Hu privately expressed regret to Zhou Qing.

He firmly believed that without this disability, he could have risen alongside Zhou Qing. Now, though he trusted Zhou Qing's character, what use was a cripple?

Prefectural Examiner Lu was currently away from Jiangzhou, so Zhou Qing couldn't seek his help. Moreover, scholars disdained discussing personal gain. Asking for favors over Five Fragrance Pills would only invite scorn, with no guarantee of success.

As for the Wang family, they had no ties to him. Wang Hai's previous visit was likely at the examiner's behest. Directly seeking their aid would be unbecoming of a scholar and could hinder his exam prospects.

Ultimately, his status as a mere scholar was still too low. Had Zhou Qing been a provincial graduate, even Scholar Zhang, as a senior, would have paid him a congratulatory visit.

"Where is Young Master Wang now?"

"He asked for the details, told me to come here first, and said he'd handle it. He'll visit you later."

"That was the right move. If he hadn't sent you here first, the gang might have come after you. Brother Hu, wait a moment."

Zhou Qing fetched mulberry branches he'd accidentally snapped during his Finger Flicking practice and some rope to immobilize Butcher Hu's legs.

He didn't dare do more, relying only on his understanding of leg anatomy to stabilize the injuries and prevent further damage.

"Young Master Zhou, this feels much better. I knew you could make Five Fragrance Pills, so I figured your medical skills must be good. Coming to you was better than seeing a doctor." Butcher Hu grinned.

"Brother Hu flatters me. My medical knowledge is limited. To heal your legs, we'll need a real expert. But rest assured, I'll do my best."

Butcher Hu said, "Young Master Zhou, focus on your studies. Don't worry about me. If you pass the provincial exam, my suffering will be worth it."

Zhou Qing smiled. "I understand, but helping you won't distract me."

He decided to ask the Lin family first. If they couldn't help, he'd turn to Wang Hai.

He already owed Wang Hai a favor—one more wouldn't hurt. Zhou Qing was confident he could repay them in the future.

Butcher Hu had helped him often. Judging by actions, not intentions, abandoning him wasn't Zhou Qing's way.

"Friend Zhou, long time no see. I didn't expect you to find such a secluded place to study—gave me quite the search." Wang Hai arrived with servants carrying wine and meat. Butcher Hu rested in a guest room.

After catching up, Wang Hai explained the Zhang family situation.

Zhang Shen, the Zhang heir, was Wang Hai's acquaintance. After mediating, Zhang Shen claimed he hadn't ordered the Fierce Tiger Gang to target Slum Alley or Butcher Hu. Underlings acting on their own were beyond his control. Still, he offered ten strings of cash for medical expenses via Wang Hai and, out of respect for Wang Hai, declared the Dingtai Lou incident settled.

Wang Hai said, "I took the liberty of deciding for you—better to resolve enmity than prolong it. Let bygones be bygones. What do you think?"

Zhou Qing replied, "I know what's good for me and never intended to offend Young Master Zhang. With your mediation, let it be so."

From his impression of Zhang Shen, Zhou Qing doubted the man would let it go. Sooner or later, he'd strike again.

First hospitality, then execution, treating people like dogs—this was the path to mortal enmity.

Had Zhou Qing not trained in martial arts, he wouldn't have survived the monk's attack. The consequences didn't bear thinking about.

This grudge couldn't go unanswered.

Nor would Zhou Qing spare the Fierce Tiger Gang.

His next goals were passing the provincial exam to elevate his status and continuing martial training. Once strong enough, he'd strike decisively, leaving no loose ends. History offered many examples to follow.

Even ten generations later, vengeance is justified!

After drinking with Wang Hai, Zhou Qing saw him off. Wang Hai said they'd meet again after school started, as he was off to visit an old flame at the Drunken Flower Pavilion.

Zhou Qing didn't mention Butcher Hu's legs, planning to ask the Lin family first. If they couldn't help, he'd approach Wang Hai later.

With school starting soon, they'd meet again.

While arranging a doctor for Butcher Hu, Zhou Qing also wanted to study medicine. Martial arts and medicine were intertwined—better medical knowledge would aid his training.

Techniques like the Breeze Swordsmanship were manageable, but skills like Blacksmith Hu's required precision. Missteps could cause lasting harm. With medical expertise, he could mitigate risks.

Though he had the Path of Nourishing Life for feedback, some harms might take time to manifest, leading him astray.

"Scholar Zhou, finding a doctor in Jiangzhou who can heal Butcher Hu's legs will be difficult." Before Zhou Qing could visit the Lin family, Miss Lin arrived after Wang Hai left.

"Do you have any alternatives?"

"You could try the Pure Blessing Temple deep in the western mountains outside the city."

The western mountains stretched far. Hu Village lay at their base, and Blacksmith Hu had gathered herbs there. But Zhou Qing had no memory of the temple, nor had the villagers mentioned it.

Butcher Hu said, "Pure Blessing Temple? I think I went there once as a child with Hu Xiu."

Hu Xiu was Blacksmith Hu's name.

"Yes, as a Hu villager, it's normal you'd been once. The temple's priests rarely descend the mountain. I learned of it from my grandfather. Scholar Zhou might not know, but even in peaceful times, areas outside the city are often unsafe. Any grand structure—be it temple or monastery—must house capable people to endure."

"I see. I've heard of the Golden Light Temple on the river island east of the city, commanding the waterways. That must be formidable too."

Zhou Qing remembered Butcher Hu mentioning the Zhang family's patronage of Golden Light Temple, where Scholar Zhang had given thanks, so he probed further.

"Golden Light Temple is indeed formidable. Scholars often retreat there to study, and it's well-regarded in academic circles. You might visit when you're free."

"Let's head to Pure Blessing Temple first. Is the mountain path passable? Can we carry someone up?"

"The path is narrow and rough, but if I send two guards to carry the stretcher, it should be manageable."

"Then I'm in your debt."
