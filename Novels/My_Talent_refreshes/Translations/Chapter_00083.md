# Chapter 83: I Just Want to Quietly Make Talismans

"You should all be aware of the situation. This beast tide arrived more suddenly than usual, and the demonic beasts are of higher ranks. Based on yesterday's situation, although most were 1st-tier low-grade and below, there were also some 1st-tier intermediate demonic beasts, and even the possibility of 1st-tier high-grade ones appearing."

Du Han called everyone to Gu Xiaoqin's shop and immediately got to the point.

"I went to Yangling last night when the beast tide began, but it was still a bit late. Moreover, this time the scale of the demonic beasts was large. The Li family of Yangling, closest to the mountain range, resisted for a while, but many people were still killed or injured. Fortunately, the demonic beasts retreated when dawn broke this morning."

As soon as Du Han said this, Chu Ning and the others realized that Du Han had indeed gone to the scene of the beast tide in Yangling last night to understand the situation.

At this moment, Du Han continued, "Deacon Lin Changqing has already arrived this morning and is taking two junior brothers into the mountains. They plan to investigate the specific cause when the demonic beasts become active again tonight. To be safe, he instructed me to take you all to the Li family this afternoon. We will help the surrounding families defend against the demonic beast attacks tonight and try to minimize their losses."

Hearing this, Chu Ning was startled. When the sect had arranged for him to come out, they only mentioned planting spiritual plants and selling talismans. They hadn't said anything about participating in such dangerous matters. A 1st-tier high-grade demonic beast was equivalent to a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator, not something he could easily deal with in his current state.

Chu Ning turned his head, only to see that everyone else had eager expressions. Clearly, for those in the mid-to-late Qi Condensation stage, who didn't have many opportunities to act within the sect, hearing about demonic beasts made them restless. Furthermore, in their eyes, even a 1st-tier high-grade demonic beast would naturally be no match for them.

While Chu Ning was pondering this, Du Han's voice sounded again. "The market has also closed now. All of you go close your shops and come with me."

Chu Ning sighed softly in his heart. After a moment of hesitation, he finally couldn't help but ask, "Senior Brother Du, this market should be safe, right?"

"Don't worry, it's safe here," Du Han nodded. "This market is still some distance from the mountain range, and it's surrounded by cultivation families. Even if there are demonic beasts, they will be blocked by the various families. You don't have to worry about your shops."

Hearing this, Chu Ning finally felt relieved and immediately interjected, "Senior Brother Du, that's not what I meant. What I mean is that I'm only at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation. My cultivation is so low, I won't be much help. Can I not go?"

Du Han was slightly stunned. There wasn't much expression on his cold face, but after a brief contemplation, he said, "Alright, you don't need to go. You're only at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation. Moreover, you, a spiritual plant cultivator, only know some planting spells and nothing else. Not only will you not be of much help, but you might even need others to look after you."

As soon as Du Han said this, the other Qingxi Sect members looked at Chu Ning with strange gazes. Clearly, in their eyes, Chu Ning's low cultivation and timidity made him seem unlike an outer sect disciple of the Qingxi Sect.

Chu Ning, however, ignored their gazes. He had the Yin Wood Spiritual Physique and the Talisman Source Spiritual Physique; he just needed to develop steadily and safely, so why take such risks? If this beast tide only involved 1st-tier intermediate demonic beasts, Chu Ning might have gone to gain experience. But since 1st-tier high-grade demonic beasts had appeared, dealing with them would require him to use more of his hidden cards, which would inevitably expose his true strength. Moreover, even then, there would still be certain dangers. When the sky falls, the tall ones will hold it up. He could just quietly make talismans here, and selling some to others would also count as contributing. Why join the commotion?

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, Du Han continued, "Bring out some talismans from your shop, and let everyone have some for self-defense. Although these low-tier demonic beasts are not to be feared, we're worried that when there are too many, it will be difficult for everyone to deal with them. I'll report the cost to Deacon Lin when I return, and it will be deducted from your monthly allowance."

Hearing this, Chu Ning's face immediately showed a troubled expression. "Senior Brother Du, it's not that I'm unwilling to give them. Today, everyone in the market was snatching up talismans, and all my talismans were completely sold out." He then added, "Or, I could quickly draw some now."

Du Han, however, waved his hand. "Never mind if you don't have any. Making some low-grade talismans now wouldn't be particularly helpful. We're leaving immediately; don't waste any more time." Without giving Chu Ning a chance to speak, he turned and left directly.

Du Han said that, but Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan's gazes were tinged with doubt. Chu Ning knew they suspected he was unwilling to provide talismans, so he could only shake his head. His talismans were indeed all sold out; not to mention mid-grade talismans, even low-grade talismans were completely gone.

To be honest, his unwillingness to get involved in the chaos just now was also a very important reason. If he had many talismans on him, he could simply stack them if he encountered something he couldn't resolve. But now, without a single one, he truly felt insecure.

Watching everyone leave, Chu Ning directly closed his shop door. He decided to hide in this talisman workshop for the next few days, even somewhat disinclined to go to the spiritual field. Anyway, the purple crystal bamboo and golden yuan fruit had already been planted; if he didn't go, at most they would just grow a bit slower. During these chaotic times, if he went out alone, who knew what dangers he might encounter.

Chu Ning had clearly felt that by noon today, the number of rogue cultivators in the market had significantly increased. The news of the beast tide had clearly spread, so many rogue cultivators were rushing here. Unlike the nearby cultivation families who feared the beast tide and worried about their families suffering heavy losses, most rogue cultivators were happy to see it, as at such times, hunting demonic beasts often brought them good income. Therefore, when a beast tide arrived, it was often a chaotic time in this area. Various cultivation families had to worry about demonic beasts and also about rogue cultivators taking advantage of the situation.

Closing the shop door, Chu Ning first cultivated the Mind Refining Art to restore his spiritual sense. He didn't even have time to tally his gains for the day; he immediately started making talismans. The appearance of a beast tide usually lasted for several days. During this time, the nearby major cultivation families and the arriving rogue cultivators would all have a demand for talismans. He was bound to make a small fortune by making more talismans.

The Imprisonment Talisman was what Chu Ning needed to draw, and it also had the highest demand today. Then, he also needed to prepare some Yin Thunder Talismans, Vajra Talismans, and Clear Wind Talismans. These three types of talismans were quite useful against demonic beasts: one for attack, one for defense. And some demonic beast attacks often carried poison gas, so the Clear Wind Talisman could also come in handy.

Over the past few days, continuously drawing these types of talismans had improved his proficiency and success rate. He now had a success rate of over fifty percent. In the morning, he could only successfully make fifty talismans at once before needing to stop. Now, he could reach fifty-five. After restoring his spiritual sense and continuing to make talismans, he drew another sixty Yin Thunder Talismans before stopping again. After three such repetitions, just as Chu Ning was about to conclude his practice and resume making talismans tomorrow morning,

"Bang, bang, bang!"

A knocking sound suddenly came from the shop door outside. Immediately after, a low voice rang out. "Is the shopkeeper in? I want to buy talismans."

"Someone buying talismans this late?" Chu Ning was a little surprised, his eyebrows slightly furrowed. It was already well past market closing, and it was completely dark outside.

Chu Ning hesitated, not rushing to get up or answer. He used the Concealment ability of his Yin Wood Spiritual Physique to completely hide his aura. At the same time, he cautiously used his spiritual sense to perceive outside.

He saw a black-robed, coarse-clothed cultivator standing outside his shop door. Sensing that the other party was at the late stage of Qi Condensation, and that the person's entire aura gave Chu Ning a very cold feeling, Chu Ning's heart immediately sank. At this moment, he became even more cautious, observing the person's movements.

When the black-robed cultivator heard no response, he took out something and looked as if he was about to knock it on the door.

"No need to shout, it's probably empty like the other shops." Just then, three more people appeared, and one spoke to the black-clad man, "These people from Qingxi Sect have probably gone to the cultivation families where the beast tide occurred."

The few individuals were dressed differently, looking like rogue cultivators. But they gave Chu Ning a strange feeling, like cultivators from some sect. Chu Ning couldn't quite discern their true strength, so he didn't dare to probe further with his spiritual sense. Instead, he kept it retracted around his body, making his various senses more acute. At the same time, he listened attentively to the movements outside.

However, the few people didn't say much more. "Let's go," Chu Ning only heard this one sentence, and then the four figures quickly departed.

Even after everyone had left, Chu Ning remained cautious. He listened carefully for a long time, then released his spiritual sense to gently probe again. Only when he confirmed that no one was near his shop did he slowly exhale.

"Who were these people? Were their words purely about buying things, or were they targeting Qingxi Sect?" Several thoughts flashed through Chu Ning's mind. He wanted to warn the sect members, but after thinking about it, he could only give up. He didn't even know where the Yangling Li family was; even if he wanted to send a message, he wouldn't know where to send it. As for going out to report the news, Chu Ning didn't even consider it. Especially after these people appeared just now, Chu Ning would absolutely not put himself in such a dangerous situation.

Even rest might not be peaceful this night. After thinking about it, Chu Ning decided to resume cultivating the Mind Refining Art. In the current situation, cultivating Qingmu Changchun Gong or Nine Transformations Body Refining Art wouldn't yield quick improvements and thus weren't very meaningful. Instead, adjusting his spiritual sense to the best state and making more talismans would be more useful, both for self-preservation and for sale.
