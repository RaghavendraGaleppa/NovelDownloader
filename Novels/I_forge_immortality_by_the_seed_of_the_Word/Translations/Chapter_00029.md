# Chapter 29: Preparing to Return Home, the Ji Family Extends an Olive Branch

"On behalf of all senior brothers and sisters of the Luodu Team, I welcome junior brother Zhang Jing to join us!" Zhang Yangchu said with a smile, his tone solemn.

"I'll be troubling Senior Brother Yangchu in the days to come," Zhang Jing replied with equal courtesy, a faint smile appearing on his face.

"By the way, junior brother," Zhang Yangchu suddenly remembered something and asked, "It's been over a month since you left home, hasn't it? Counting the days, there aren't many left before the Nanli Chang'an Festival."

"If you wish to return home, you can take the opportunity to go back with those who didn't pass the assessment when the Dao Academy sends them home."

Go home?

Images of his parents repeatedly giving him advice before his departure flashed before Zhang Jing's eyes.

"Yes, I should return home. Thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother Yangchu," he said gratefully.

"Don't mention it, junior brother."

As he spoke, Zhang Yangchu took out a yellow talisman and a small white jade bottle, handing them to Zhang Jing as he explained:

"Junior brother, I'll wait for your return before taking you to Luodu Island. At that time, I'll give you the cultivation cave and the opportunity to exchange for mid-grade inheritance. These are the promised Purple Spirit Pills for you to take during your cultivation back home."

"After all, the spiritual energy outside can't compare to the Dao Academy."

"This is a communication talisman. When you return, just activate it with spiritual power to contact me."

Meanwhile.

A beautiful figure made her way through the crowd and walked straight to Ji Bochang, smiling sweetly as she said:

"Junior brother, you've worked hard today."

Hearing this, Ji Bochang's face fell as he looked at the woman's lovely face and said in a low voice:

"I'm sorry, senior sister! I only managed to get fifteenth place this time."

"It's alright, junior brother," the woman gently took Ji Bochang's hand and comforted him in a soft voice. "It's understandable. After all, who could have predicted that the competition in your batch would be so fierce? Especially those three—their performances were truly beyond the norm."

As she spoke, a trace of confusion appeared on her face.

"The two A-grade prodigies are understandable, but where did that freakish junior brother who ranked third come from?"

"Never mind, his strength has nothing to do with us. By the way, what about that junior brother you mentioned earlier? Given the special circumstances of this assessment, if he ranked within the top thirty, the conditions I promised you still stand."

Hearing his senior sister's words, Ji Bochang's face immediately showed a hint of embarrassment.

He pointed to the third demonstration platform:

"Senior sister, that friend of mine is the 'freakish junior brother' you just mentioned."

"What? He's the one you were talking about?" The senior sister's beautiful eyes widened as she stared at Ji Bochang, pouting in complaint. "Why didn't you say so earlier?"

"I didn't know before either," Ji Bochang said awkwardly. "After all, senior sister, you know I spent most of my time with you—"

Before he could finish, the blushing senior sister covered his mouth with her hand.

A whisper as soft as a mosquito's hum followed.

"Junior brother, don't say anymore."

Only after Ji Bochang nodded vigorously did the delicate hand slowly withdraw from his mouth.

"Senior sister, how about I take you over now and see if you can persuade him to join our Five Colors Team?" Ji Bochang tentatively suggested.

"No need."

The senior sister forced a smile, then pointed to Zhang Yangchu on the third demonstration platform and said softly:

"Junior brother, do you know who that is?"

"Who?"

"That's Senior Brother Zhang Yangchu, representing the Luodu Team, ranked third in the Outer Academy. Unless something unexpected happens, your friend will be joining the Luodu Team. What would be the point of us going over?"

She then solemnly reminded him:

"Junior brother, having such a friend is a rare opportunity. You must cherish it."

"Senior sister, don't worry. Bochang understands."

Ji Bochang smiled faintly.

He then hurriedly took out a communication talisman and channeled spiritual power into it.

The next moment, the talisman glowed faintly, followed by a ripple of spiritual consciousness.

After a long while.

The talisman gradually dimmed, and Ji Bochang put it away with a pained expression.

"Junior brother, what are you doing?"

Seeing this, the senior sister asked in confusion.

"Senior sister, you don't know. Brother Zhang and I come from the same place, but he's from a mortal background. I was just informing my family elders about Brother Zhang's performance in the Dao Academy assessment. They're probably already on their way to his home."

Ji Bochang understood the situation better than anyone.

His friend Zhang Jing's rise was meteoric.

Now that he had joined the third-ranked Luodu Team, not only Ji Bochang himself, but even the entire Ji Family might not be able to offer resources that would catch Zhang Jing's eye.

In other words, they could no longer provide much assistance to Zhang Jing in his cultivation.

But—

The Ji Family could still extend goodwill to his parents, helping them solve worldly problems. This way, Zhang Jing could focus on his cultivation, and the Ji Family would naturally gain his favor.

"A mortal background?"

The senior sister's face immediately showed a strange expression.

Truly, this batch of newcomers was full of monsters!

At that moment.

"This year's Dao Academy assessment has concluded successfully. Tomorrow morning, all new disciples are to report to the Inheritance Pavilion to receive their robes and identity jade tokens."

Senior Brother Liu's booming voice suddenly rang out.

From the giant stone pillars.

Bright streaks of light shot off in all directions.

Yong'an City, Zhang's Medicine Shop.

"Master Zhang, tomorrow and tomorrow again—when exactly will your son return? I'm just a messenger. Why make things difficult for me?"

A middle-aged man sighed helplessly and said:

"Let me be frank with you."

"Our employer has consulted an expert who determined that the new shop must open on the day of the Chang'an Festival. But with only half a month left until the festival, you still haven't moved out! It will take considerable time to merge these shops and prepare the new store."

"So the employer has issued an ultimatum: you must move out within the next two days."

Hearing this, the smile on Zhang Jing's father's face slowly froze.

He cupped his hands politely and said:

"Brother, even if we move, we can't possibly do it in two or three days. Look at all these medicinal herbs—we've been sorting them for nearly half a month, and there's still so much left."

"That's not my concern."

The man spread his hands and said:

"As I've said before, our employer is in a hurry."

"Anyway, I've delivered the message. Whether you move or not is up to you."

With that, the man strode out.

Only Zhang Jing's parents were left behind, staring at each other in dismay.

The medicine shop fell into deathly silence.

Finally.

"Husband, what should we do?" Zhang Jing's mother's voice broke the silence.

"Ah—" Zhang's father sighed deeply and said quietly, "At this point, we have no choice but to move."

"But what about when Jing'er returns?"

"Wife, here's what we'll do. You stay here and pack up the herbs, furniture, and other belongings. I'll ask Shopkeeper Dou to come and appraise them. We'll sell everything we can to get some silver."

"When the time comes, we'll wait at the door. As soon as Jing'er returns, we'll leave Yong'an City immediately."

"Is there really no other way?"

Zhang's mother asked fearfully.

She had fled to Yong'an from Yunzhou as a child, fortunate to have met Zhang's father and finally found a home.

Now, that home was about to be taken from them.

"There's no other way. We don't have enough silver to buy another place in Yong'an," Zhang's father replied with a bitter smile.

Yet when he looked up and saw the fear on his wife's face, his heart ached inexplicably.

At that moment.

Yong'an Academy.

Master Liu paced anxiously in the courtyard, his usual calm demeanor gone.

In his hand, he tightly clutched a jade slip.

"By my calculations, the results of this year's Dao Academy assessment should have been announced by now. Why is there still no news? Could something have gone wrong?"

Despite having his own expectations, Master Liu couldn't help but feel nervous.

Time passed slowly.

Suddenly, the jade slip in his hand trembled slightly, emitting a white glow.

"It's here!"

Master Liu took a deep breath and eagerly looked at the jade slip.

[Yong'an Academy Students Who Passed the Assessment]

[Zhang Jing (3rd)]

[Ji Bochang (15th)]

For a moment, Master Liu thought he had misread. He rubbed his eyes and looked again.

He wasn't mistaken!

But it was hard to believe!

That little Zhang Jing had ranked in the top three of the comprehensive assessment?

If he remembered correctly, this might be the first time in Yong'an Academy's three-hundred-year history!

Excitement—unparalleled excitement!

"Hahaha, wonderful, truly wonderful! Our Yong'an Academy has finally produced a prodigy!"

Master Liu couldn't help but laugh heartily.

He then shouted loudly, "Someone! Go to Zhang's Medicine Shop in Yanping Lane and inform Zhang Jing's parents—no, I'll go myself! Hahaha—"

As he spoke.

Master Liu strode out energetically, paying no heed to the darkening sky.

But as soon as he stepped outside, he saw a middle-aged man in fine robes walking toward him. With a single glance, Master Liu recognized him—Ji Xianming, the current head of the Ji Family and father of Ji Bochang.

Seeing Master Liu, Ji Xianming paused in surprise and asked:

"Brother Liu, where are you headed at this hour?"

"Ah, Brother Ji. Have you come to ask about Bochang—no, Bochang must have already informed you that he passed the assessment."

"Brother Ji, have you come for Zhang Jing?" Master Liu probed.

"Haha, as expected, nothing escapes Brother Liu's notice. With a top-tier genius emerging from Linshan County, it's only natural for the Ji Family to pay our respects."

"The Ji Family's instincts are as sharp as ever."

Master Liu said meaningfully:

"Coincidentally, I was just about to deliver the good news to Zhang Jing's family. Would you care to join me, Brother Ji?"

"Excellent!"

With that, the two set off toward Zhang's Medicine Shop, one after the other.

Before long.

Master Liu and Ji Xianming stood across from Zhang's Medicine Shop.

They watched the busy scene of workers moving items out of the shop and froze in surprise.

"What's happening at Zhang's Medicine Shop?"

Master Liu murmured.

"Are they moving? But why would they move so suddenly, and at night no less?"

Ji Xianming's heart skipped a beat, a faint sense of dread creeping over him.

Please don't let anything have happened to them!

"Brother Liu, let me go ask around," Ji Xianming said gravely.

With that, he headed straight for the neighboring shops.

Shortly after.

Ji Xianming returned, his expression noticeably lighter.

"Brother Ji, did you find out what's going on?"

"Thankfully, nothing's happened to them! It's some merchant guild called the Hundred Herb Pavilion that's taken a fancy to this location and used some underhanded methods. Hmph, I heard the owner has connections to a rogue cultivator. How bold."

"We'll need to handle this carefully."

Master Liu said, relieved.

Ji Xianming's face turned cold.

He understood the implications all too well.

While no harm had come to them, they had still suffered grievances. If this wasn't handled properly, when that young man returned, there might be hell to pay.

And the Ji Family's plans to befriend him could be ruined.

After a moment's thought.

The two entered Zhang's Medicine Shop together.

"Gentlemen, if you're here for medicine, please go elsewhere. Zhang's Medicine Shop has already moved."

Seeing the two men enter, Zhang's father hurried forward and said apologetically.

"Master Zhang, I am Liu from Yong'an Academy."

Seeing Zhang's father, Master Liu stepped forward ahead of Ji Xianming and spoke politely.

"Master Liu?"

Zhang's father froze, then tentatively asked.

Master Liu nodded.

Immediately, Zhang's father's expression changed, a flash of panic crossing his eyes as he asked urgently, "Master Liu, forgive me for not greeting you properly. Has something happened to my Jing'er?"

Behind him, Zhang's mother also looked worried.

"Haha, not at all. I came to congratulate you both. Zhang Jing has passed the Dao Academy assessment. From now on, he is an esteemed immortal of the Dao Academy."

Boom—

At that moment.

It was as if a thunderbolt had struck Zhang's parents. They stood frozen, unable to process the news for a long time.

Ji Xianming and Master Liu waited patiently.

Half a quarter-hour later.

Zhang's father finally managed to gather his wits and stammered, "Master Liu, are you saying... our Jing'er... passed the assessment for the legendary Dragon Lake Dao Academy?"

"Correct!"

"He's... an immortal now?"

"Correct!"

That night.

Zhang's parents stared at the dozen or so chests filled with gold, silver, and fine silks, the deed to five thousand acres of fertile land in a sandalwood box, and the deed to a mansion in Yong'an's eastern district, feeling as if they were in a dream.

Yet the treasures before them were undeniably real.

Sigh—

"Wife, I think we should lock up these gifts from the Ji Family head and wait for Jing'er to return before deciding what to do. I'm afraid accepting them might cause trouble for him. What do you think?"

Zhang's father asked cautiously.

"Husband, you're right. If only we hadn't been caught off guard earlier... Wait, husband, we're about to move. Where will we keep all this?"

"Yes, such valuable items—what if something happens to them?"

The couple worried over this all night.

Until the next day—

A middle-aged man arrived, respectfully presenting the deed to the Hundred Herb Pavilion.
