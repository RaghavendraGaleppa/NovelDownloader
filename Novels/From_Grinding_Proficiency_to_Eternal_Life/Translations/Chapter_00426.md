Chapter 426: True Martial Sword

"Before that, I should go see Baiyue first."

Only when that promised magic treasure was in his hand would he feel at ease.

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. Riding his light, he flew straight toward Baiyue Peak.

Before Baiyue Peak, True Person Baiyue, who had sensed Xu Yunfan’s aura, was already waiting at the Nine Winding Corridor on the peak.

True Person Baiyue said with a smile, "Junior Brother Xu, you have arrived at just the right time. True Lord Qingyuan just ordered someone to open the A-Rank Treasury to clear out some inventory."

"A-Rank Treasury?"

The Origin Sect's A-Rank Treasury was a vital location of the sect, specifically used to seal and store the lifebound magic treasures of past Foundation Establishment True Persons.

These treasures had extraordinary origins; some were the remnants of True Persons who died in battle, while others were legacy treasures left behind by those who exhausted their lifespan and entered reincarnation to cultivate anew.

According to sect rules, if a reincarnated individual failed to return to Foundation Establishment within three cycles of sixty years, their magic treasure would be taken into the treasury to await a destined person.

Of course, aside from Foundation Establishment True Persons who died mid-journey, the vast majority would not contribute their magic treasures to the sect treasury. They would generally find ways to hide them somewhere, waiting to retrieve them after awakening their past life's wisdom.

The various True Lords of the Origin Sect all had their own personal treasuries.

Xu Yunfan said joyfully, "Thank you, Senior Brother Chu."

Xu Yunfan followed True Person Baiyue through thirty-six layers of restrictions. With every gate they passed, the restrictions rippled like water. These layers were nested together: there were fire curtains condensed from Azure Nether True Fire, iron gates cast from Black Yin Cold Iron, and even a Slaying Evil Net woven from nine hundred and ninety-nine strands of spiritual power.

And a Slaying Evil Net...

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but twitch his mouth.

When passing through the seventh layer of restrictions, True Person Baiyue特意 stopped to remind him, "Junior Brother, remember, do not use your spiritual sense to explore the niches on both sides after passing through this gate. Those are fierce weapons whose spiritual nature has been lost and whose aura is in extreme chaos. They are best at devouring souls and are all materials prepared for reforging."

Xu Yunfan naturally agreed readily.

When the final bronze giant gate slowly closed behind him, Xu Yunfan’s expression suddenly froze.

The so-called A-Rank Treasury before him was actually a fragment of a palace hall suspended in the void.

Twelve broken dragon-engraved golden pillars supported the precarious dome. The ground was not paved with jade but with a metal earth fused from countless weapon fragments. Every step激起细碎的金铁交鸣 (stirred a faint clanging of metal).

The sharp remnants of weapons were even somewhat piercing to the soles of his feet.

This was completely different from the treasury he had imagined.

"Let Junior Brother laugh at this," True Person Baiyue said.

True Person Baiyue brushed away the drifting stardust with his sleeve. "True Lord Qingyuan dislikes those flashy decorations. This A-Rank Treasury of the Xuantian Pavilion is actually half of a Sword Palace he moved back from the Outer Battlefield back in the day. When the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect voluntarily triggered the great tribulation, they naturally attracted a lot of concentrated fire."

Xu Yunfan’s gaze swept around. In the vast hall, only seven or eight magic treasures were suspended, making it look exceptionally empty.

A broken blade was inserted into a stone platform in the northwest corner, its body entangled by struggling blood-colored chains. In the southeast, an ancient bronze mirror leaned against something, its surface reflecting fragments of light and shadows from different time and space.

The most eye-catching was the center, three zhang high above, where nine illusory dragon shadows were entwined around a tattered battle flag. The dark brown bloodstains on the flag surface were still slowly squirming.

"Does it feel a bit shabby?" True Person Baiyue chuckled.

"Eight out of ten Foundation Establishment True Persons of the Origin Sect reincarnate to cultivate again. They would all bury their lifebound magic treasures in the Nine Nether Yellow Springs rather than obediently return them to the treasury. Three years ago, when the one on White Deer Peak achieved dissolution, he even went so far as to erase the spirituality of three magic treasures."

Xu Yunfan wasn't surprised to hear this. As a member of the Demonic Sect, selfishness was to be expected.

Before the words had fully faded, a clear and melodious sword chant suddenly rang out from the dome.

Xu Yunfan looked up and saw, on the highest broken beam, a pitch-black long sword spitting out cyan sword light.

When the sword body trembled, the fragments of magic treasures scattered everywhere resonated with it.

Suspended where the starlight of the dome fell was a pitch-black long sword. The sword body faintly displayed tortoise shell patterns, and the snake-shaped relief coiled around the sword guard was slowly moving.

When Xu Yunfan approached, the sword suddenly burst forth with three zhang of green light, illuminating the True Martial Dharma Body hidden around his body with perfect clarity.

The moment Xu Yunfan’s gaze touched that pitch-black long sword, the True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture within his body operated on its own, and the Primordial Origin True Seed trembled and resonated in his Dantian.

The tortoise shell patterns on the sword body vaguely corresponded to the scales of his Black Tortoise Dharma Body, and the snake-shaped relief coiled around the sword guard moved like a living creature.

Without needing to touch it, he already sensed the Divine Martial True Intent that had been dormant in the sword for countless years surging toward him like a tide. This sword was actively responding to the Divine Martial Dao Base within his body.

Seeing all this, True Person Baiyue’s eyes became even more filled with smiles.

"This is the True Martial Sword," True Person Baiyue said, clapping his hands and smiling. "This was the personal sword of the former Divine Martial True Person. When the great tribulation arose back then, Divine Martial True Person held this sword and drank the heart blood of seventeen Foundation Establishment True Persons."

"That exaggerated?" Xu Yunfan looked surprised.

After forging his Dao Base and entering the Foundation Establishment realm, he understood the subtleties of the situation.

Within the same major realm, if one is not fully prepared and does not lay down a heaven-wide net, it is generally very difficult to suppress and kill a Foundation Establishment True Person on the spot and send them to reincarnation.

Xu Yunfan fell silent for a moment and glanced at True Person Baiyue.

"It seems this sword was specifically placed here for me."

"For you?" True Person Baiyue shook his head. "To be precise, it is for the person who cultivates the Divine Martial Dao Base. Otherwise, why would I have intercepted you in the extreme north?"

"Why?"

"Because the True Martial Swallowing Devil Scripture relates to a Golden Core Great Dao. If handled properly, the Origin Sect may not be unable to produce another True Lord."

Xu Yunfan understood and nodded slightly, saying no more. He possessed the True Martial Swallowing Devil Scripture, and this True Martial Sword was a match made by heaven for him; he truly had no other choice.

The moment Xu Yunfan grasped the sword handle, his body trembled slightly.

A tsunami-like spiritual power surged from the sword body, and he saw countless fragments of memories.

Divine Martial True Person slaughtering a group of cultivators atop the Floating Mountain; the scene shifted to him blood-sacrificing countless loose cultivators and even disciples of the Three Great Sects in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World; finally, it froze on a pair of pale hands reaching out from the void, tearing Divine Martial True Person in two.

A True Lord actually made a move?!

Xu Yunfan’s heart trembled slightly. Looking at the True Martial Sword in his hand, he felt it was somewhat scalding to hold.

Once he accepted this sword, he would likely结下 a great karma.

*This old thing, why didn't I think of grinding you into meat paste back then.*

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but curse silently in his heart.

"Junior Brother?"

Baiyue's voice pulled him back to reality.

Xu Yunfan then realized that his Dharma Body had automatically manifested. The phantom of three heads and six arms blended with the sword light. The True Martial Sword connected to the stars, forcibly drawing the power of starlight downward to converge on the sword body. The blade was a vast expanse of white, actually projecting the brilliance of the Big Dipper onto the ceiling of the treasury.

He forcefully suppressed the shock in his heart and said casually, "This sword and I have a fate.不知可否 (I wonder if it can be...)"

"Naturally," True Person Baiyue said with a meaningful smile. "However, a Foundation Establishment True Person should have a Dao Name. Since Junior Brother has obtained the True Martial Sword, you must give yourself a Dao Name."
