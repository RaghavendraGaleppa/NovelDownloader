Chapter 51: Foot Bath

As Jiang Yun walked between the pavilions, she carried a wooden bucket filled with hot water, her hands cradling it carefully. She let out a gentle sigh, her expression tinged with tension. The night was shrouded in a fine misty rain, and the darkness was only illuminated by the soft glow emanating from within the rooms. With one more step, she would reach the chamber of the young master she was about to attend to.

Taking a deep breath, Jiang Yun steeled herself. She had been preparing for this moment for a long time, psychologically bracing herself for the encounter. With her head bowed, she proceeded towards the brightly lit room.

Unlike Zhong Jun and Xi Jia, the other two maids, Jiang Yun did not resign herself to her fate. They were content with serving their future young master, hoping that he would be lenient towards them. Jiang Yun, however, still held onto the hope of changing her circumstances.

As she entered the room, she was taken aback by the commotion within. The young master, clad in green, was engaged in a fierce struggle with a burly servant, Nhan Kha. The two were rolling on the floor, exchanging blows.

Jiang Yun's eyes widened in shock as she watched the scene unfold. Li Zhi Ming, the young master, was biting his teeth, determined, while Nhan Kha was retaliating with equal ferocity. The fight continued, with neither party yielding.

Just as Jiang Yun was about to intervene, the two combatants rolled towards her, and she had to steady herself to avoid being knocked over. Managing to maintain her balance, she took a step over the writhing pair.

"Stop fighting, you two!" Jiang Yun exclaimed, her voice stern.

However, her reprimand was met with indifference, as the two continued their brawl. It wasn't until they had exhausted themselves that they finally stopped.

As Jiang Yun placed the wooden bucket down, she scolded, "You're both grown men, can't you just calm down?" But before she could finish, she realized her mistake. She had just reprimanded her master, a grave offense.

Panic set in, and Jiang Yun knelt down, her head bowed, her body trembling. She was consumed by fear, thinking about the potential consequences of her actions.

Meanwhile, Li Zhi Ming and Nhan Kha slowly got to their feet, still bickering. Li Zhi Ming, still rubbing his sore belly, noticed Jiang Yun still kneeling on the ground.

"Why are you still down there? It's cold," Li Zhi Ming said, puzzled.

Jiang Yun hesitated, still in a state of panic, before slowly getting up. She saw Li Zhi Ming sitting down on a stool, preparing to soak his feet in the hot water. Nhan Kha was already doing the same, sitting beside him.

Without being told, Jiang Yun quickly knelt down beside Li Zhi Ming, helping him remove his socks and gently placing his feet into the hot water.

Li Zhi Ming remained silent, observing Jiang Yun's actions. Though he wasn't used to being treated with such deference, he didn't let it faze him. As a member of the gentry, he considered it normal to be treated with respect.

As Jiang Yun tended to his feet, Li Zhi Ming couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions, though he didn't verbalize them.
