# Chapter 43: The Distribution of Meat and the Madam’s Praise

A great cauldron was kept burning for two full days and one night. Although the process of refining this delicate nourishment was bitter and exhausting, no lives were lost.

The Dragon Roar charcoal had burned to ash.

The liquid inside the cauldron transformed from a grayish-brown color to a pale green, and finally to a milky white. The smell changed from turbid to clear, gradually wafting out. A gentle sniff made the mouth water with a sweet taste.

A faint, refreshing fragrance drifted out, condensing in the air without dispersing, lingering for miles.

"This precious soup of refined nourishment is truly a fine thing."

"The Madam is like a celestial fairy. If it weren't for her, none of us would ever get to drink a single drop."

"Indeed, the Madam even shares such a precious soup with the miscellaneous servants. Alas, those lowly servants are as卑贱 as mud; how could they ever deserve such a favor from the Madam?"

When the refinement was complete, the fire under the cauldron was extinguished. The guards were all sent back several miles away. The tall buildings and dense vegetation of the manor blocked their view, preventing them from seeing the copper cauldron.

They had no chance to witness the scene of opening the cauldron.

"The Madam is as beautiful as a fairy, yet as mysterious as a phantom." Everyone harbored similar thoughts.

Suddenly, someone said, "The Madam eats the meat, we drink the soup. I wonder how it will be distributed this time."

As soon as these words were spoken, everyone perked up.

"According to past惯例, the guards get seventy percent, Commander Pang gets twenty percent. The remaining five percent is split: two percent goes to the Grade A guards, and the remaining three percent is divided equally among the Grade B, C, and D guards."

"There are many of us Grade D guards. If we calculate it roughly, each person can get two or three sips."

At this time, everyone wished they could climb a little higher. The higher you climb, the fewer people there are at your level.

The share of the soup... would naturally be greater.

"That might not be the case this time. Didn't you see? There are four pieces of meat this time. The largest piece is naturally the Madam's. But what about the other three pieces?"

"Right, now that you mention it, it is indeed strange. Commander Pang gets one piece, Miss Qiuyue gets one piece, but there is still one piece left..."

"..."

At this topic, everyone's interest grew even higher. Although the meat had nothing to do with them, "who gets the meat" was worth exploring.

"I guess... it should be for Master Ying. I remember once, the Madam glanced at Master Ying."

"Ah! You mean the winter hunt last time? Master Ying killed a striped tiger, and the Madam turned to look?"

The crowd buzzed with noise, all turning to look at the very front. Huahan Ying raised his head and chest, extremely proud. He exuded an arrogant air of looking down on everyone.

His thin lips curled up, and his mind, driven by the crowd, became increasingly active and expectant.

"Could it really be... for me?"

"During the last winter hunt, the Madam did look at me."

His heart pounded. The more he thought about it, the more possible it seemed. Joy surfaced on his face.

"Ahem, do not speak nonsense. How can we, mere men, speculate on the Madam's intentions?" Huahan Ying pretended to be nonchalant, lightly reprimanding them.

"Master Ying, everyone saw it clearly. It doesn't hurt to talk about it."

Wan Xingke, also a Grade A guard, nudged Huahan Ying with his elbow and said with a smile.

Although they were both Grade A, there were still distinctions based on strength and seniority. Among the hundreds of guards, Huahan Ying's talent and martial arts attainments were second to none.

"Very well." Huahan Ying waved his hand, quite willing to let everyone discuss the matter, as it brought him face.

Everyone continued, "Master Ying's fortune is well-deserved. After all, he is forged from iron. The winter hunt happens every year, but only Master Ying could hunt a striped tiger."

"Congratulations, Master Ying."

"I just wonder what that piece of meat tastes like. I hope you can tell us about the flavor later."

"If this piece of meat is truly for me, if the Madam truly values me, I must seize the opportunity and perform with all my might. Best of all... I could make the Madam look at me a second time and remember my name!"

Huahan Ying could no longer remain calm. He turned his head toward the direction of the cauldron, the corners of his mouth slightly raised, looking spirited and triumphant.

Not long after, the sound of footsteps approached. The guards looked at Huahan Ying, their envy seeming to materialize.

Pang Long walked into their view, laughing heartily. Huahan Ying's gaze was intense as he stared fixedly at Pang Long.

However, Pang Long only nodded to him, then turned and swept past, walking straight toward the Grade C guards and shouting at a figure, "Li Xian, the Madam is calling for you."

"The Madam is calling for you."

As these four words fell, everyone was dumbfounded, showing expressions of shock.

Everyone looked left and right, their gazes gradually gathering on one person, filled with surprise, astonishment, and confusion...

Just a Grade C guard, yet he had the qualification to be summoned by the Madam!?

"Alright!"

Li Xian had long been expected this. He calmly walked out of the crowd.

"Wait here, everyone. Behave yourselves."

"This refined soup is plentiful this time, everyone will get a share. Hahaha."

Pang Long was in a great mood.

The two walked toward the distance, and the crowd of guards immediately became noisy.

"Li Xian? Is that the one who started as a miscellaneous servant, became a guard, and was promoted to Grade C within a month?"

"Tsk! I've heard of this kid. Who would have thought... who would have thought the one to receive the meat this time would be him!"

"I'm telling you, although Li Xian has potential, compared to Master Ying, he's too green. Logically speaking, it shouldn't be his turn."

"I suspect this Li Xian has some hidden connection with Commander Pang. Last time he was promoted, Commander Pang gave him a Tiger Strength Pill!"

"In that case, perhaps this time's meat distribution was also strongly recommended by Commander Pang."

"Alas, with that connection, we naturally can't compete."

Their words were filled with sourness and a sense of injustice.

"Enough."

Huahan Ying said coldly, "The Madam and Commander Pang's decisions are not for you to speculate on. Shut up."

This time, his tone was filled with hidden malice and anger.

Everyone immediately dared not speak.

Huahan Ying clenched his fists, coldly watching the backs of Li Xian and Pang Long. His jealousy and anger were beyond words.

He thought suddenly, "Who is this Li Xian? Why does the Madam give him meat instead of me? Commander Pang... I respect you so much usually, yet you treat me like this."

Grade B guard Jiang Yun also deeply watched Li Xian's back.

"This kid really has some background. I'll find a time to ask Sister Qiuyue and probe into this kid's origins."

There were three others who felt deeply moved. They were Zhao Han and the other two, who once shared a room with Li Xian and had a fairly harmonious relationship.

In such a short time, they felt as if Li Xian was climbing higher and higher.

Near the cauldron, Luo Fang knelt on the ground.

The refinement of the nourishment was complete, waiting only for the Madam's distribution. According to惯例, Luo Fang's miscellaneous servant room would get three percent.

"Li Xian? What is he doing here?"

Suddenly, he saw a familiar figure walking toward him.

Luo Fang's heart churned like the sea, but he forced himself to remain calm and observed the situation secretly.

"What is your name?"

Beside the great cauldron where the nourishment was refined.

Li Xian was brought before the Madam. He lowered his head, looking at his own toes, able to smell a faint fragrance.

"Reporting to the Madam, my name is Li Xian." Li Xian answered truthfully.

Madam Wen nodded. "Tell me how you crossed the snow and arrived at Qingning County."

Li Xian's heart skipped a beat. He immediately thought, "As expected, after I left that day, the Madam was secretly following me. Fortunately, I didn't choose to flee immediately. Being chased by that Snow Demon Monkey might have offered a sliver of life. But if I were targeted by the Madam, that would be hopeless."

He spoke the truth: "Since I was young, my ears have been sharp, and I am sensitive to the wind. By listening to the wind, I can roughly determine my direction."

"Being able to reach Qingning County that day was also partly accidental. Perhaps it was fate, guided by some unseen force."

"You... are good."

Madam Wen's voice sounded again.

Carrying a hint of praise.

She had seen all of Li Xian's actions that day. After buying the cosmetics, Li Xian immediately turned back, which at least proved his loyalty was genuine.

Madam Wen heard that Li Xian's voice was steady, but his age was very young. She couldn't help but become curious about his appearance and commanded, "Raise your head."
