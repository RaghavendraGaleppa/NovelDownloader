# Chapter 59: The Young Madam of the Bai Family  

When Wang Chan inquired, Zhang Tuozi chuckled helplessly:  

"On my way back from the Black River Market, I ran into an old friend who was being hounded for gambling debts. Seeing him at death's door, I couldn't just stand by—I lent him a hand out of old friendship. Though I got dragged into a bit of trouble myself, the matter was settled in the end."  

Wang Chan frowned.  

The situation didn’t sound like a major issue—helping someone in need wasn’t a big deal, but getting himself involved in trouble over it was less than ideal. And the fact that the person was a gambling addict...  

But seeing Zhang Tuozi’s indifferent expression, Wang Chan ultimately held his tongue.  

"Look over there—what’s that?"  

Just then, Zhang Tuozi abruptly changed the subject, pointing toward his cave abode. A faint yellow barrier shimmered into view, its surface swirling with earthen-yellow formation patterns.  

"You got the formation?" Wang Chan immediately smiled. "Looks sturdy and solid—this defensive barrier must be exceptionally strong."  

Zhang Tuozi grinned. "A twenty-five-layer **Minor Earth Formation**. Set up on the mountain, it draws power from the earth itself. It can withstand mid-grade spells and mid-grade magical artifacts for nearly half a cup of tea’s time. Low-grade attacks barely tickle it."  

As he spoke, Zhang Tuozi cast his long-practiced low-grade spell, **Minor Golden Finger**, sending a streak of golden light toward the barrier. The attack was silently absorbed without so much as a ripple.  

"Congratulations, Brother Zhang. You’ve truly gotten what you wished for. A formation like this isn’t easy to come by." Wang Chan clasped his hands in genuine admiration.  

This formation was indeed impressive—far superior to the **Mystic Water Ninefold Array** he had sold off. Earth-attribute formations were renowned for their defensive prowess.  

It seemed Zhang Tuozi was wealthier than he had imagined. A formation of this caliber would cost at least fifteen hundred spirit coins.  

And was White Mountain City truly so prosperous? Even if this was a low-grade formation, obtaining one of such quality couldn’t have been easy.  

"Just luck," Zhang Tuozi said modestly before sighing. "White Mountain City is the true land of cultivation. Especially after the arrival of that Yin God True Immortal—with his sweeping reforms, the city and the entire White Mountain region will only grow more prosperous in the coming years..."  

Clearly, his time in the city had broadened Zhang Tuozi’s perspective.  

With one hand holding a teacup and the other resting on his hip, he pontificated eloquently about the grand trends shaping the White Mountain region.  

"In three to five years, I’ll break through my bottleneck and reach mid-stage Qi Refinement. If I work hard tending my spirit fields, I might even become a high-grade spirit farmer within twenty years. Then I’ll qualify to apply for residency in the city and give Luo Bing a better life." Zhang Tuozi’s eyes gleamed with longing before he downed his tea in one gulp and added earnestly,  

"Brother Wang, you should strive for progress too. Break through to mid-stage Qi Refinement and become a high-grade physician. Sticking to the wilderness won’t get you anywhere."  

Wang Chan said nothing, merely raising his cup in a silent toast.  

Zhang Tuozi was a man of good character—unquestionably decent.  

No one would refuse to associate with a good man, for his moral standards were far above the norm.  

"Heh..." Suddenly, as if remembering something, Zhang Tuozi leaned in conspiratorially. "The benefits of the city—well, forget the rest, but the female cultivators there are like a dazzling array of flowers!"  

Without waiting for Wang Chan’s response, Zhang Tuozi glanced toward Luo Bing’s direction. Seeing no movement, he carefully retrieved a jade painting from his storage pouch and unfurled it proudly. "What do you think?"  

The painting depicted a **Beauty Emerging from the Bath**. The woman in it was breathtakingly beautiful, yet her demeanor was dignified and noble. A sheer white gauze barely concealed her alluring figure...  

The artistry was undeniably striking.  

The woman’s aura was particularly captivating—so much so that even with the veiling, one’s gaze couldn’t help but linger.  

"Guess who she is?"  

"A noble lady from some prominent family?"  

"Ha! Brother Wang, you’ve got a sharp eye. This beauty is none other than the young madam of the Bai family—Mo Jingchun!"  

"How did such a painting end up circulating?"  

"Oh, it was painted by a rogue Foundation Establishment cultivator surnamed Wang. While the woman is real, the young madam is no ordinary figure—the scene depicted is entirely fabricated." Zhang Tuozi sighed regretfully.  

"Who knows what grudge that Senior Wang held against the Bai family, but he painted many such jade paintings—not just of the young madam, but also of the Bai family matriarch... While being chased by Bai family’s Foundation Establishment cultivators, he scattered these paintings all over White Mountain City. I managed to grab one... heh..."  

"They say Mo Jingchun ranks third among White Mountain City’s Ten Great Immortal Beauties. Not only is she the direct descendant of the Mo family, a Foundation Establishment clan from Green Mountain City, but she also possesses a high-grade spiritual root. She’s already a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator. Rumor has it she’s never taken a life in her cultivation journey—her temperament is said to be extraordinarily gentle..."  

"Though there are whispers that she and the Bai family’s young master have grown estranged—they now live separately. Some say the young master is entangled with a female cultivator from the Wei family, while others claim he’s infatuated with a sentient second-rank red-dressed female ghost. Utterly absurd, if you ask me..."  

As Zhang Tuozi rambled on, Wang Chan sipped his tea quietly, his expression turning faintly amused.  

"Ah, poor Zhang Tuozi—just a lowly rogue cultivator unworthy of notice. In this lifetime, I’ll never get to taste the... *flavor* of those noble ladies..."  

With that, Zhang Tuozi handed the jade painting to Wang Chan. "Brother Wang, take a closer look. Isn’t it... *lifelike*? That gauze is so thin—I really wish..."  

"Brother Zhang, restrain yourself!" Wang Chan stood abruptly, putting distance between them. "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form. What’s so special about a mere painting?"  

"Brother Wang, you..." Zhang Tuozi stared at him in disbelief, as if to say, *You’ve changed, my friend*. But before he could continue, a delicate figure appeared out of nowhere, yanking his ear with a mix of fury and exasperation.  

"You wretched hunchback! Is my spirit field not enough to keep you busy?!"  

Amidst the scolding, Zhang Tuozi was dragged away unceremoniously.  

Wang Chan chuckled, then calmly tucked the jade painting into his storage pouch.  

*I have important matters to attend to today—no time for distractions. I’ll critique this properly another day.*  

"Speaking of which, that Fellow Daoist Su seems quite lovely. I wonder if she’s washed her honeyed spirit peaches yet..."

### **Wilderness**  

Deep within a remote, spirit-energy-deprived mountain forest, hidden behind an inconspicuous tree hollow, lay a dimly lit underground cavern.  

"Ah Wei, how many times must I tell you—remain calm in the face of great matters." He Changkong reclined in a lounging chair, frowning as he set down his teacup.  

This cavern was one of thirteen secret hideouts he had prepared in the area.  

When conducting business outside, he naturally traveled with a large entourage—strength in numbers made tasks easier, and potential adversaries would think twice before acting.  

If they encountered a formidable enemy, having allies meant shared risk—some could even serve as sacrificial pawns if necessary.  

But once the gang’s affairs were settled, he would slip away alone, retreating to one of his hidden caverns.  

Whether for cultivation or more... *unsavory* activities, the caverns provided perfect cover.  

No one else knew of these thirteen locations.  

As for his three publicly known cave dwellings, those were reserved for his Dao companion and two other... *close acquaintances*.  

Though he visited them occasionally, he never stayed the night—just long enough to satisfy certain urges before leaving.  

His caution was what had allowed him to rise from an obscure early-stage Qi Refinement cultivator in Blackwater City to a mid-stage cultivator here, first attaching himself to the Bai family before secretly aligning with the Wei family.  

In this world, trust was a luxury—whether in women, brothers, or even parents.  

This time, if not for Ah Wei’s urgent message via the low-grade magical artifact **Mystic Jade Pendant**, and if He Changkong hadn’t verified that Ah Wei wasn’t being coerced or manipulated, he would never have allowed him to come here.  

Now, he wanted to see what urgent matter had driven Ah Wei to rush over in such a frenzy.  

If the answer wasn’t satisfactory, Ah Wei would suffer for it—a lesson in discretion.  

After all, this hideout had taken considerable effort to prepare. Once compromised, it could never be used again.  

"Big Brother, I’ve gathered all the information on Wang Chan over the past decade. He has no significant backing—just some minor connection with Constable Tian, likely due to his looks. Nothing to worry about. His association with Ning Jingming is superficial too. Let’s just deal with him now." Ah Wei hesitated before blurting out his proposal.  

"You’re still fixated on this?" He Changkong sighed.  

"Now that we’ve secretly pledged ourselves to the Wei family, we don’t need to do Bai Shaofeng’s dirty work anymore. Besides, in a few days, we’ll be heading to White Mountain City to cultivate. Eventually, we’ll accompany that esteemed figure to Green Mountain City for business and settle there permanently. Even if that wilderness rogue is as cunning as they come, do you think he’d dare seek revenge in Green Mountain City? He’ll never rise above his station. And since he has no real backing, why waste energy worrying about such a nobody?"  

"But he’s just a weak early-stage Qi Refinement cultivator—it’d be effortless..."  

**Crash!**  

He Changkong’s teacup shattered against Ah Wei’s forehead, splashing tea everywhere. "How many times must I tell you? Avoid unnecessary bloodshed—you never know what tricks someone might have up their sleeve! What if you end up capsizing in a shallow ditch?"  

"Big Brother..."  

"I’ve already arranged for your sister-in-law to take the market’s flying vessel to White Mountain City today. She should already be on her way." He Changkong waved dismissively. "We need to wrap up loose ends with the Black Eagle Gang. I’m busy—go handle your own affairs."  

"But..."  

"Spit it out!"  

"But... I’ve noticed that over the past few months, Sister-in-Law has been disguising herself and secretly visiting that Wang Chan’s medical stall every month to... to... *enjoy*..."
