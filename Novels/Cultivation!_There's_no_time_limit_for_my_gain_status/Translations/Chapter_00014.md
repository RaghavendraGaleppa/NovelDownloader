# Chapter 14: The New Disciples

"Haha, young man, don't be afraid. That's why I said you're lucky—joining our Scripture Valley is your best option."

"Our Scripture Valley possesses thousands of cultivation techniques, with countless fragments of secret manuals beyond measure. Once you're here, you just need to select a dual-attribute cultivation method that matches your own attributes. Not only will you be able to cultivate both yin and wood attributes simultaneously, but you might even achieve twice the results with half the effort."

Dual-attribute cultivation techniques—this was the first time Jiang Li had heard of such a concept.

Yet, it made perfect sense. Just like how the Five Elements Peak of Shu Mountain had methods to allow the "Sword Heart" talent to unleash power beyond the limitations of one's spiritual root grade, dual-attribute spiritual roots were also a form of innate talent. Without the right cultivation method, they were like chicken ribs—tasteless when eaten but a pity to discard. Only with a suitable technique could the advantages of dual-attribute spiritual roots be fully realized.

"Thank you, Elder!"

After expressing his gratitude once more, Jiang Li followed the others as they were led by a puppet toward the rear courtyard.

There, another massive ship awaited them, its size no smaller than the one that had transported their group of two thousand. What made everyone gasp, however, was that this colossal vessel hovered silently several meters above the ground, bobbing gently like a balloon.

As Jiang Li moved closer, he noticed intricate patterns carved into the ship's hull, similar to those on the spirit-testing formation. He had no idea what principle allowed it to counteract such immense gravity.

"Jiang Li, let's go!"

Yan Hong stood impatiently on the gangplank, urging Jiang Li, who was busy examining the ship's details.

The group of twenty-one, led by Jiang Li and Yan Hong, boarded the Scripture Valley's flying ship.

"Hey, fellow disciples, we've got new companions!"

On the deck, twelve youths of similar age were chatting and laughing. They turned to look as Jiang Li and the others came aboard.

"Hello, are you all newly recruited disciples too?"

Yan Hong and Jiang Li naturally stepped forward to greet them, while the nineteen lower-grade spiritual root disciples remained quietly in place.

"Hello, I'm Jiang Li, and this is Yan Hong."

Jiang Li introduced himself.

"Nice to meet you! I'm Yu Banxia. Since we'll all be fellow disciples from now on, let's get to know each other early."

Yu Banxia was very enthusiastic, pulling the two into their circle.

"This is Qu Qianfan from the Qu family of Raging River, an upper-grade spiritual root talent."

A dark-skinned, exceptionally lean youth nodded slightly.

If Jiang Li remembered correctly, the Qu family was a renowned martial arts family in the martial world, known for their deadly "Heartbreak Sword" technique.

"I've heard of you. The Jiang family's 'Year of the Tiger Technique' is quite famous. We should spar sometime."

Qu Qianfan had been holding a slender sword and had seemed aloof until now. Upon seeing Jiang Li, however, he immediately switched to a martial artist's familiar greeting style.

Unbeknownst to him, although Jiang Li came from a martial arts family, he wasn't well-versed in these customs.

"Brother Qu, you flatter me. My skills are far from refined—I'd only embarrass myself."

They were about to become cultivators—why dwell on mere martial arts?

"Brothers Jiang and Yan, let me introduce the others."

"This is Wang Liuliang, upper-grade spiritual root." A scholarly youth waved a folding fan in greeting.

"This is Lu Qianqian, mid-grade spiritual root." Lu Qianqian was a petite girl in a beautiful blue cloud-patterned dress who seemed shy around everyone.

"...And this is Tang Wenxin, mid-grade spiritual root. Also, Kong Qingzhou and Pang Xiaowu, both mid-grade spiritual roots."

At this point, the twelve turned their attention to Jiang Li and Yan Hong, clearly expecting more details about their spiritual roots, which they had omitted earlier.

"Allow me to reintroduce myself. I'm Jiang Li, mid-grade spiritual root, and this is Yan Hong, upper-grade spiritual root."

Hearing this, the twelve smiled again.

After all, they were all newcomers to the cultivation world, starting from scratch. Spiritual root grades were the primary basis for forming friendships, as evidenced by their circle consisting solely of mid-grade and above talents.

"Tch. A bunch of outer sect disciples, wasting time forming cliques instead of focusing on cultivation. Pathetic."

A young man in a white robe emerged from the cabin. His robe fluttered elegantly, with a red-threaded "Scripture" character embroidered on the chest—similar to the attire worn by Elder Weng Sanqi's wooden puppets, likely the standard disciple uniform of Scripture Valley.

The speaker's tone was haughty, and without provocation, he berated the group. When no one responded, he grew bored, lingered on the deck for a while, then retreated back inside.

"Who was that? He looks about our age—is he a senior disciple?"

Jiang Li asked, noticing the others' displeased expressions.

"That's Qi Tianya, a supreme-grade spiritual root prodigy! He was directly promoted to inner sect upon joining and started acting high and mighty the moment he put on that robe."

Yu Banxia's face darkened with envy and resentment.

"A supreme-grade spiritual root... No wonder he dares to speak like that."

"We'd better tolerate it. The gap between inner and outer sect disciples is vast, with strict hierarchies. Next time we see him, we'll have to call him 'senior brother.'"

"As an inner sect disciple, he'll receive personal guidance from elders and better resources. It won't be long before he leaves us in the dust."

The group's "resentment of the privileged" flared up, sparking a lively discussion. Yu Banxia's expression grew even gloomier.

Upper-grade spiritual roots were rare and considered elite, but compared to supreme-grade, they paled in comparison.

After some time, Jiang Li and Yan Hong remembered their nineteen lower-grade companions and sent them to find resting spots in the cabin.

"Brothers Yan and Jiang, why bother with them? Lower-grade spiritual roots won't be of any help—they'll only hold you back."

Yu Banxia and Qu Qianfan visibly looked down on the lower-grade disciples, their class consciousness deeply ingrained even before entering the sect.

"We'll keep that in mind. Spiritual root quality is indeed crucial for cultivators."

Jiang Li smiled, offering no further explanation.

Even the weakest spiritual roots—or mortals—had their uses. Otherwise, why would the cultivation world recruit so many low-tier disciples? Without their labor filling menial roles, who would handle tasks like cleaning toilets? Certainly not high-ranking cultivators.

From their conversation, Jiang Li learned that Yu Banxia and the petite Lu Qianqian had some background in cultivation. Though their exact influence was unclear, they shared useful insights about the cultivation world.

According to them, relationships among outer sect disciples in major sects were far from the harmonious "senior-junior brotherhood" one might imagine.

In Scripture Valley, the outer sect maintained around eight thousand disciples. Factionalism, infighting, extortion, and exploitation were commonplace.

Thus, to protect their interests, Yu Banxia had taken the initiative to unite mid and upper-grade talents of their intake, forming a mutual-support group.

Jiang Li and Yan Hong had no objections.

While they wouldn't blindly trust strangers, having more allies was better than making enemies.

---

Jiang Li's group appeared to be the last batch of recruits. As the sun set, those on deck watched as a line of cultivators ascended into the sky from the direction of Shu Mountain's Five Elements Peak. Mounting their flying swords, they vanished from sight in moments.

"How fortunate—their small numbers let seniors and elders escort them directly by swordflight. Meanwhile, Scripture Valley recruited six to seven hundred this time. Without these ships, transporting everyone would be impossible."

Soon, Elder Weng Sanqi and other inner sect disciples returned, herding the newcomers into the cabin. The ship's speed was too great for mortals—without protection, the wind alone would be unbearable.

"Alright, everyone must be tired. Get some rest. In two more sunrises, we'll reach Scripture Valley."

Yu Banxia proved adept at socializing, securing decent cabins for Jiang Li and Yan Hong on the first level.

The rooms were small but elegantly furnished. Unlike the previous lakeside vessel, this flying ship was far more advanced, with round crystal windows embedded in the hull.

The convex lenses distorted direct views, but by adjusting the dial around the window, a beam of light projected the breathtaking scenery outside onto the wooden wall.

---

Time passed unnoticed over a day and two nights.

At dawn on the second day, as light streamed through the crystal lens, the thunderous snoring in Jiang Li's room abruptly ceased.

Exhaling a turbid breath, he sent a thin layer of dust scattering across the floor until it dissipated against the wooden wall two meters away.

"Finally broke through to become an internal martial artist."

**[Name: Jiang Li]**  
**[Age: 13]**  
**[Race: Human]**  
**[Primary Profession: Martial Artist, Tier: First-Class]**  
**[Secondary Professions: None]**  
**[Health: 980/980]**  
**[Stamina: 860/860]**  
**[Strength:]**  
**[Speed:]**  
**[Constitution:]**  
**[Spirit: 1]**  
**[Comprehension:]**  
**[Techniques: Year of the Tiger Technique Lv.8]**  
**[Skills: Appraisal Lv.3, Mountain-Cleaving Sword Lv.3]**  
**[Buffs: Slow Healing, Accelerated Recovery, Satiety, Robustness, Yang Vigor]**  
**[Debuffs: None]**

Sensing his nearly doubled vitality and strength, Jiang Li felt a flicker of satisfaction—but no more.

Barring unforeseen circumstances, his martial arts training ended here. Upon reaching the sect, he would devote himself entirely to cultivation. Spending even a moment on martial arts would be wasteful.

Breaking through to internal martial artist before arrival was a fitting conclusion to his family's legacy technique.
