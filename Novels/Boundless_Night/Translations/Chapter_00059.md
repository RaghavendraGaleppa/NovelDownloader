# Chapter 59: Times Have Changed

"Could it be... that Cui family member?" the maid whispered in surprise. She knew that her mistress had once lived for four years in a renowned city, where she had befriended some extraordinary individuals.

Beside them, two men in golden armor, hearing the name "Cui," also showed surprise, their eyes gleaming as they looked towards Rooster Ridge, shrouded in night.

"I can't be sure it's him yet; after all, it's been over two years since we last met. He rode past on a Violet Lightning Beast, and the eyes and nose visible beneath his facial guard were indeed very similar. Also, his habitual posture when riding a strange beast—one hand gripping the mane, using his blade as a whip..."

"Miss, you're truly amazing! The night is so dark, and in that fleeting glimpse, I could barely make him out, yet you saw him so clearly. Is this the ability of an 'Outsider'?" the maid chattered lively. She even whispered, asking if Cui Chonghe was an acquaintance, a close friend, or someone dear to her mistress, and if they were going to reveal themselves soon.

The young woman, clad in a feathered robe with her black hair cascading like a waterfall and radiant divine light flowing in her bright eyes, murmured, "If it is him, why would he be here? Times have changed; it's not appropriate for me to meet him again. Let's just wait in the dense forest. I only wish to confirm if it truly is that old acquaintance."

"Not appropriate to meet? Does he... have a problem?" The maid opened her small mouth, looking astonished.

One of the golden-armored men spoke, "Miss, we should move further away. Lord Meng has gone deep into the mountains to help you acquire the remaining branches of the Black-White Ancient Tree. What if the negotiations break down..."

***

On the back mountain of Rooster Ridge, Qin Ming, riding the Violet Lightning Beast, saw vast tracts of phoenix trees and a very large bird's nest. Inside, an exotic bird, not particularly huge, about three meters long, lay quietly in the nest. The nest, constructed from phoenix tree branches, was on the ground. The exotic bird had only a few golden feathers scattered on its body; large areas were bare, and its physique was thin, making it look quite old.

"Come, sense it. Is this a five-mutation ferocious bird?" Qin Ming patted the Violet Lightning Beast's head with his long spear. When it came to sensitivity towards mutated creatures, mutated beings understood each other best. He asked the Violet Lightning Beast, wanting to confirm.

The Violet Lightning Beast was highly intelligent and could fully understand his words. Though very reluctant to comply, it eventually relented and nodded.

"So this is the foundation of Rooster Ridge? No wonder it's called that, with an old Golden Rooster that's undergone five mutations." Qin Ming looked surprised. The old bird's condition didn't seem very good; its feathers were almost all gone.

The four bandits who had fled earlier were beside the phoenix tree nest. They were very nervous, even trembling, when facing the old Golden Rooster. The surviving bandit chief stood before the phoenix tree nest and said, "Although you, senior, warned us not to disturb you, it's a matter of life and death. Rooster Ridge is about to be annihilated, so we had no choice but to seek your help." It was clear his body was tense, fearing the old Golden Rooster would target him.

Because this ferocious bird had entered its twilight years, it was completely out of control and no longer listened to them. Even "tributes" were useless now. It was now single-mindedly attempting to imitate the legendary Phoenix-blooded strange bird's Nirvana, wanting to make one final attempt here: succeed and become a six-mutation creature, fail and die tragically on the spot. The bandit chief of Rooster Ridge understood that it was bound to fail. How could it comprehend the method of Nirvana? Its sparse phoenix blood was simply insufficient to support further advancement.

The old Golden Rooster glared fiercely at the bandit chief, then its gaze turned violent towards the man and beast in front. The few remaining golden feathers on its body stood on end. Anyone who obstructed its "Nirvana" would be torn to shreds. It had little chance, only a final flicker of hope, yet it was being disturbed, causing its malevolence to surge.

"Are you squatting there to lay an egg?" Qin Ming asked in a hoarse voice. He then quickly whispered to the Violet Lightning Beast, "If I can't beat it, you can outrun it, right?"

Inside the phoenix tree nest, the old Golden Rooster exploded in rage, its entire body literally covered in goosebumps. It stood up straight, letting out a loud, ringing Golden Rooster cry.

"Just wait to die! Senior is a male phoenix; how dare you insult it like that..." One of the surviving bandits spoke, clearly trying to curry favor with the old Golden Rooster. However, this flattery landed on a chicken leg (missed its mark). The ferocious bird in the phoenix tree nest was now erratic in its moods, taking its anger out on everyone.

After rushing out, it performed a "Golden Rooster Stands on One Leg." As for its other strong leg, it kicked sideways, sending the four bandits flying with a series of thuds. This was no simple side-kick; its sharp, large talons instantly pierced through all four of them, leaving them bloody. Some had their bellies ripped open and intestines spilling out, while others clutched their chests with gaping holes torn through them. They fell to the ground, howling in agony, and one bandit died on the spot. Even the sole surviving bandit chief's expression changed abruptly. He retreated quickly but was still a step too late. The old Golden Rooster executed a "Phoenix Spreads Single Wing," its bare, fleshy wing glowing. Although it didn't solidly smash into him, it still sliced open his armor, leaving a large bloody gash across his chest.

The old Golden Rooster was primarily brutal: whoever prevented it from spending its twilight years in peace or interrupted its Nirvana process would be killed. It was as fast as lightning, delivering another claw strike to the bandit chief, sending him flying seven or eight meters, piercing his thigh, leaving it a bloody mess, and even snapping a bone with its "phoenix claw." The main reason was that the bandit chief had been severely wounded by Qin Ming earlier; otherwise, he wouldn't have been taken down so quickly.

Qin Ming watched with wide eyes. Why did it feel like this old Golden Rooster was a "practitioner" (someone who trains in martial arts)? Its attacks were fierce, meticulously structured, as if it was proficient in human combat techniques. The bandit chief was furious but dared not speak while lying on the ground. Unless the Golden Thief personally arrived, this old Golden Rooster wouldn't heed anyone.

The next moment, the old Golden Rooster strode with its long legs, its talons cracking the rocks in the snowy ground. Carrying a gale and stirring up a sky full of snowflakes, it pounced towards Qin Ming, extremely fierce, almost teleporting directly in front of him. Even the Violet Lightning Beast grew tense, almost turning to flee.

Qin Ming gripped his long spear and thrust it out, creating dozens of spear shadows, like a coiled dragon swirling, baring its fangs and claws, aiming to tear apart the ferocious bird in front. The old Golden Rooster's massive, golden beak clamped onto the spearhead with a clang, then powerfully swung its head, snapping the spear tip with a crunch. At the same time, one of its bare, fleshy wings, like a human performing the 'Chopping and Hanging Palm' technique, chopped down towards the man and beast.

The Violet Lightning Beast was unequivocal, carrying Qin Ming and ramming upwards, using him as a cushion to protect itself. It was extremely wary of the old Golden Rooster and did not want to be struck. Qin Ming had originally intended to block the old Golden Rooster's fleshy wing to gauge its strength, but the Violet Lightning Beast used him as a shield, immediately infuriating him. He slapped the Violet Lightning Beast's back, causing it to whimper repeatedly and slump dejectedly, while his other hand met the fleshy wing. Both Qin Ming's palm and the old Golden Rooster's fleshy wing flowed with Heavenly Light. With a thunderous boom, their contact was like two colossal beasts colliding. The Violet Lightning Beast couldn't withstand such immense force, crashing into a massive ancient tree, then staggering and shaking uncontrollably.

Qin Ming jumped off it, threatening, "See that? I'm keeping this broken spear for you. If you dare to run, I guarantee I'll throw it accurately and stick it in you." He looked at his opponent; a bloody mark appeared on the old Golden Rooster's fleshy wing, seeping blood. Qin Ming now had a clear idea; he could fight the old Golden Rooster. Generally speaking, excluding rare anomalies, a normal five-mutation creature had similar strength to a newly born five-stage human. The old Golden Rooster possessed over three thousand catties of strength, similar to Qin Ming's.

The bandit chief lying on the ground and the three other near-death bandits were all extremely surprised. This mysterious, seemingly young man could actually shake the old Golden Rooster!

After one of its featherless fleshy wings began bleeding, the old Golden Rooster became enraged. It strode forward with its two long legs, raising its pair of fleshy wings like two great blades, pouncing towards Qin Ming to kill.

"It really has trained!" Qin Ming confirmed. The bandit chief lying on the ground knew very well that the old Golden Rooster had been taught by a Golden Thief and possessed an impressive inheritance and strong combat techniques.

In an instant, the old Golden Rooster continuously swung its fleshy wings, emitting blazing Heavenly Light, bursting the air, and producing bursts of wind and thunder. Qin Ming remained calm, his Heavenly Light Energy bursting forth, firmly clashing with the blade-like fleshy wings. Both being bipedal creatures, both wielding their upper limbs, the old Golden Rooster indeed displayed the combat techniques taught by the Golden Thief to their fullest, showing remarkable prowess. But it was ultimately an anomaly. The Heavenly Light it unleashed based on its racial characteristics could not withstand the multiple Heavenly Light Energies fused by Qin Ming.

With a soft thud, its fleshy wing was punctured with bloody holes by Qin Ming's "Nail Force," instantly making it a gory mess. Next, Qin Ming used his fused "Intercepting Force." His palm sliced like a blade, severing a section of the large claw that the old Golden Rooster had suddenly kicked out, trying to sneak attack. The old Golden Rooster crowed, then performed a "Golden Rooster's Disordered Nod," another practical combat move. Its golden beak pecked at Qin Ming's forehead. If an ordinary person were pecked there, their frontal bone would surely shatter, and their head would rupture. Qin Ming had Heavenly Light Energy protecting him, but he also didn't want his head pecked by an old Golden Rooster. His right palm blocked like lightning, his five fingers glowing. The fused "Edge Force" and "Nail Force" erupted. Amidst clanging sounds, five finger-shaped holes appeared on the old Golden Rooster's beak. Then, he used his "Adhesive Force," and with a snap, tore off half of the old Golden Rooster's beak.

At this point, the few bandits on the ground despaired. Even the five-mutation old Golden Rooster was no match for that mysterious expert; they were destined to be completely wiped out. The bandit chief sighed. The old Golden Rooster was ultimately a "mortal species," lacking the Heavenly Light burst methods of powerful races. Even with a body full of profound Heavenly Light, it was no match for that person.

The old Golden Rooster did not fight to the death. Instead, it leaped up and returned to the phoenix tree nest. Its entire body erupted in dazzling light, letting out a loud Golden Rooster cry. It was unwilling to give up, wanting to make one last attempt. Its entire body's blood boiled as it tried to undergo a sixth mutation, hoping to elevate its life level. Ultimately, its last golden feathers burned to ash. Its entire body cracked open, blood gushing out, and it utterly failed, dying within the phoenix tree nest.

Qin Ming hadn't expected it to be so resolute. He said, "Neither human nor beast, yet even a chicken can be so fierce and unyielding."

However, when he passed the phoenix tree nest, he no longer felt any sympathy for the old Golden Rooster. In the large iron plate used for its food, there were human arms, not yet fully eaten. To show his respect for its ferocity, Qin Ming had originally intended to "stomach-bury" it himself, as it was a five-mutation creature, and he had never enjoyed such a high-grade ingredient before.

Now, he could only wave, calling the Violet Lightning Beast over, and said, "You eat it. Consider it a reward. Although the old Golden Rooster isn't a spiritual creature, eating it will still benefit you." The Violet Lightning Beast held its head high, very proud, with a look of disdain and contempt, refusing to eat.

"Suit yourself!" Qin Ming turned, carrying his broken long spear, and one by one dealt with the bandits amidst their unwilling roars.

"Who exactly are you?! Someone sent by the new City Lord, or a mountain guardian recruited by an Outsider?" At the last moment, the bandit chief roared with all his strength.

Qin Ming did not respond, treating him like dirt. He used his spear tip to sever the bandit chief's head, then quickly cleaned up the battlefield. He was quite displeased because he saw a pile of armor, weapons, and bows in the bandit camp's warehouse, clearly prepared for newly recruited members. This meant Rooster Ridge had spent a large sum of money, but these were spoils of war he couldn't take with him.

"My Daygold!" Qin Ming sighed. In the end, he searched the entire place, tidying up the appearances of all the dead, and collected a total of forty-seven Daygold coins, along with some Night Silver. This was naturally a huge sum, far exceeding the wealth found on Wang Nianzhu, Huang Jingde, and others, but considering it was Rooster Ridge, a bandit chief's stronghold, it seemed a bit paltry.

Fortunately, he found three books here, one of which contained the crystallized wisdom of predecessors, and he sensed strong emotional fluctuations from it. Qin Ming immediately smiled. Such secret texts were far more precious than Daygold!

While he was searching for spoils on the mountain, two bandits returning from drinking in a nearby town turned pale with fright. They vaguely heard the bandit chief's roar, which sounded utterly desperate. The two immediately sobered up and plunged into the dense forest, finding a wooden hut. This place should have been guarded, monitoring movements on the mountain path, but it had been severely understaffed and empty for several days. However, someone did come daily to feed a few raptors kept here. If Rooster Ridge were attacked, these birds could be released to seek external aid.

"Sending a message to the Golden Thief lords would definitely be too late; distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. Let's ask the Three-Eyed Cult for help instead!"

Not long after, in Green Pine Town twenty li away, the Three-Eyed Cult's high-ranking members looked grim. Someone had actually launched a night attack on Rooster Ridge, and the people there were asking for their help.

"Something big has happened, prepare quickly!" They acted swiftly.

Qin Ming delayed for a long time on the mountain, searching every corner. Indeed, he couldn't find anything valuable anymore, only then did he ride the Violet Lightning Beast down the mountain.

"Take me a bit further, to Green Pine Town!" He felt that since he had already acted today, he might as well take down the Three-Eyed Cult, which also posed a significant threat to the local area. The main reason was that he had single-handedly flattened Rooster Ridge without feeling much strain.

"Tonight, I promise to let you return to the mountains. Run fast, take that small path; speed is paramount in war!" Qin Ming had done his homework before coming, studying this area.

However, by the time he arrived at Green Pine Town, the Three-Eyed Cult's stronghold was silent and deserted; all its members had evacuated. In the distant dense forest, cult members were discussing, "I thought we were going to reinforce Rooster Ridge, but who knew the higher-ups would lead us to flee!"

Qin Ming was disappointed. He left Green Pine Town via the main road. At the town's exit, he saw four figures approaching from a distance: two men in golden armor, and among the two women, one was clad in a feathered robe, clearly an 'Outsider'.

"Miss!" the maid called out.

"It seems it truly is him," the feathered-robe woman whispered.
