# Chapter 694: Heaven Moves with Constant Principles

The moment he had been waiting for had finally arrived.

Tian Guang Zhenjun made his move without hesitation.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan no longer held anything back.

With no further obstruction, two ten-thousand-zhang tall avatars unleashed their full power simultaneously!

The platinum-colored glazed sword light transformed into billions of solidified anchors, piercing into the boundary wall of the Aitila World. Meanwhile, the purple-gold thunder chains coiled around the world's body like giant pythons.

Amidst the piercing sound of the world membrane tearing, the shattered Aitila World was forcibly dragged into the edge of the law笼罩 of the Taihua Spirit Ruin World.

A vast, ocean-like aura of Xuanhuang Merit descended from the void. Sixty percent flowed into Xu Yunfan's avatar, while forty percent converged toward Tian Guang Zhenjun.

"Exhilarating!"

A look of comfort appeared on Xu Yunfan's face as he immediately activated the World Crossing Platform.

"Lu Chuan, lead the others back to the world."

Xu Yunfan's avatar pointed a finger at the World Crossing Platform.

The Jade Platform's light swirled, and thirty Void Crossing Vessels carrying thousands of cultivators roared out.

Among the crowd, a discreet streak of light, enveloping the statue of the Supreme Lord of Merciful Salvation, quietly landed and instantly connected with the remaining incense network of the Aitila World.

It was none other than Zhang Ziyang.

Xu Yunfan's avatar swept its gaze over him, then smoothly moved away as if it hadn't seen a thing.

This was not the time for conversation, with Tian Guang Zhenjun watching intently by the side. If any flaw were revealed, the smiling Tian Guang Zhenjun would undoubtedly strike with his sword without hesitation the very next second.

Tian Guang Zhenjun was eager to collect the merit to stabilize the losses to his Sword Domain, and he was also concerned about his disciples fighting for resources within the world. His platinum avatar gave a slight nod to Xu Yunfan.

"Matters here are concluded, Daoist Shengxiao. Until we meet again."

A flash of sword light, and he vanished into the Aitila rift in an instant.

Xu Yunfan stood in the界海 (World Sea), feeling the immense merit washing over him. He saw the label "Heaven's Plunderer" on his attribute panel fading away, while his cultivation level, aided by the merit and the forced resonance with heaven and earth, continuously leaped upward.

The vast tides of the World Sea gradually calmed. The massive, shattered outline of the Aitila Great World was finally completely swallowed and digested by the robust world membrane of the Taihua Spirit Ruin World.

The moment Aitila Great World was completely devoured, the void trembled instantly. A vast, ocean-like aura of Xuanhuang Merit descended from an unknown source, condensing into a tangible waterfall of light. Sixty percent of it poured into Xu Yunfan's majestic avatar standing atop the Shengxiao Mountain Peak, while forty percent flowed toward the avatar of Tian Guang Zhenjun, which was wreathed in platinum sword light at the Wansheng Sword Sect.

The massive merit washed over his limbs and bones, and even purified the origin of his soul. Xu Yunfan could clearly feel his own cultivation, nourished by this pure and mighty power, advancing at a considerable pace, as if a dried-up riverbed had finally welcomed long-awaited sweet rain.

The Taihua Heaven's generosity this time was the reward for his sacrifice of an entire great world's origin. In essence, it was a mutually beneficial exchange.

However, the look of comfort on Xu Yunfan's face only lasted for a moment.

A more obscure yet chilling will, like a bone-thorn, still lingered deep within his true spirit.

He could see, or rather perceive, that in the list woven by the world's rules in the nether, his name was still on it. Though it was no longer as piercingly red as when he first achieved the Dao, it was still branded there, not completely erased.

It wasn't that the "Plunderer" label had completely faded, but more like a mark that had changed color. It had been downgraded from "must be eliminated" to "requires high vigilance."

A faint, indistinct sense of rejection still brushed past him from time to time like a faint electric current.

This was the inherent alienation of this world toward a plunderer like him.

Everything had changed dramatically after becoming a Golden Core.

"You've felt it too, haven't you? The sky of this Taihua Spirit Ruin World, heh, has a very picky appetite."

A lazy, slightly teasing voice sounded from beside him.

The graceful figure of Dongming Zhenjun appeared quietly, with Xuansha Qi flowing around her, condensed but not dispersing.

Her beautiful eyes, which seemed capable of piercing through one's heart, fell upon Xu Yunfan, a knowing smile playing on her lips.

Xu Yunfan withdrew his gaze from the void and looked at Dongming Zhenjun. His avatar also faded, leaving only his true body standing alone atop the mountain peak.

The strong wind rustled the hems of his purple-gold Daoist robe, making a crackling sound.

"Yes. Even if we pull in more great worlds and contribute more world origin, it still seems like a drop in the bucket. The Heaven's dissatisfaction is deeply rooted."

He spoke slowly, his voice calm but thoughtful.

"The root lies in the two words: Dao Fruit."

Dongming Zhenjun's red lips parted slightly, piercing through the veil and confirming the conjecture that had just become clear in Xu Yunfan's mind.

"Dao Fruit..."

Xu Yunfan repeated the words in a low voice, a flash of lightning in his eyes.

At this moment, all the clues were connected.

He finally understood the source of the Heaven's dissatisfaction toward Golden Core Zhenjuns.

The Golden Core realm, where one attains the Dao Fruit, transcends the mundane, has a long lifespan, and is already a top-tier existence in this world.

But this is by no means the end.

Above that, there are still Nascent Dao Lords overlooking the World Sea.

Cultivators seek the Dao, ascending step by step to the heavens.

To move from the early stage of the Golden Core to the mid-stage, and then to the late stage, peak, and finally to glimpse the legendary Nascent Dao Embryo realm, the Dao Fruit itself is the greatest nourishment and stepping stone.

What is called practicing a small cycle is to use one's own attainted innate Dao Fruit as the foundation and core, and then find two other Dao Fruit that are compatible with one's own path and have complementary attributes, such as Yin-Yang, Five Elements, Life-Death, Light-Dark, and other such categories.

Naturally, the best are the fruit positions of this world.

Using one's cultivation to temper and completely refine and fuse them.

Let the power of the three Dao Fruits form an endless, cyclical small cycle operation within the Golden Core, causing the essence of the Golden Core to undergo a leap.

After that, if one's inner heaven does not fall, one can be reborn and immediately take control of one's own fruit position.

Mana, cultivation, intent, and control over laws all undergo a qualitative change. This is the mid-stage of the Golden Core.

To achieve the late stage of the Golden Core, one needs to find two more Dao Fruits with compatible attributes on the basis of the small cycle, and integrate them into the cycle, expanding the small cycle into a larger, more stable, and higher power-level great cycle.

The circulation of the power of five Dao Fruits, with the Golden Core's might being as vast as the sea, is what makes one a late-stage Zhenjun.

There are only so many of the 108 Heavenly罡 and Earthly煞 positions in the Taihua Spirit Ruin World; how many Golden Cores can they support?

"A mid-stage Golden Core Zhenjun needs three Dao Fruits, and to enter the late stage, one needs five Dao Fruits..." Xu Yunfan thought silently to himself.

Every Dao Fruit signifies the fall of a Golden Core Zhenjun, or the forcible plundering of a supreme law authority nurtured by heaven and earth.

For the Heaven of the Taihua Spirit Ruin World, this is nothing short of a continuous and intensifying internal drain and blood loss.

Zhenjuns are powerful; they are the guardians and pioneers of the realm. But they are also the most greedy of parasites.

They attack foreign worlds, plunder origin, keeping the lion's share for themselves to nourish their own path and raise their cultivation level.

The Heaven, on the other hand, often only gets to share in some fragments of world origin.

With such a severe imbalance between contribution and reward, over the long term, how could the Heaven not grow resentful, viewing the Zhenjuns as plunderers and branding them with a label?

"Heaven moves with constant principles; it does not exist for Yao, nor does it perish for Jie.

It must maintain its own operation. If the number of Golden Cores is too large and they are too 'greedy,' they naturally become redundant under its balancing laws, becoming objects that require vigilance or even cleanup."
