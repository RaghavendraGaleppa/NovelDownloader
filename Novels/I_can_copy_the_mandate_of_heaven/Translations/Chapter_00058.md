## Chapter 58: The Wounded

This was the second time since taking over the Pharmacy Valley that Scribe Li Zhi had received such a large batch of wounded. The entire valley reeked of blood, and upon entering the courtyard, Li Zhi's eyebrows furrowed.

Before him, the people from the 玄 (Xuan) Hall had brought over no less than forty stretchers. Hardly anyone could stand, and the blood from many of them had completely soaked through their stretchers. The situation was much more severe than the previous batch.

Li Zhi hurried forward, and at that moment, a 香主 (Incense Master) from the 玄 Hall, similarly covered in blood, was leaning on a crutch, struggling to walk over.

"Li Xiao Shenyi (Little Divine Physician), my brothers..." Zhou Jin's eyes welled up with tears, and he almost knelt down before Li Zhi.

Li Zhi waved his hand, interrupting him, and without turning his head, ordered, "Silver needles, gauze, hemostatic powder, quickly."

Behind him, Jiang Yun hastily brought over a medical box. She was still not very skilled in doing these tasks, and upon seeing the bloody scene, her face turned pale, but she didn't dare slow down. She hurried to Li Zhi's side, who snatched the medical box from her hand and, without even looking at her, quickly walked towards one of the wounded.

This person's injuries were so severe that they were almost too horrific to look at. A 武师 (Martial Artist) had been struck in the forehead with a knife, and regardless of the gruesome wounds on his abdomen, just the forehead wound had split his skull open.

Along the split in the skull, one could clearly see the yellowish-white matter underneath.

One eyeball had been completely destroyed by the knife, and the other eye's pupil had dilated and lost focus.

The person was almost dead.

Jiang Yun took one glance and almost let out a scream, but managed to suppress it. Her legs were shaking, and the pungent smell of blood filled her nostrils. She had never seen such a bloody scene before.

Meanwhile, Li Zhi quickly knelt beside the wounded man and opened the medical box. His face remained expressionless as he worked.

He fed the man a highly effective heart-saving pill, but the man had already lost consciousness, and blood flowed from his throat. Li Zhi had anticipated this and used two fingers to pry open the man's throat. A silver needle was inserted into the man's cheek muscles on both sides, causing his mouth to open and stay open.

Li Zhi then helped the man vomit out the filth in his mouth and fed him a crimson medicine.

Zhou Jin, who was watching, felt a surge of emotions. He had led his men to attack the 江洋大盗 (River and Ocean Bandits), who had been secretly escaping along the grain transportation route. However, upon arrival, they discovered that there were over two hundred bandits, far more than the forty to fifty initially reported.

Despite being outnumbered, Zhou Jin led his men, a hundred strong, in a surprise attack. They managed to annihilate the bandits but suffered heavy casualties, with over a third of his men killed on the spot. The rest were brought to the Pharmacy Valley, with some in critical condition.

As Li Zhi continued to work on the wounded, Zhou Jin couldn't help but feel a deep sense of gratitude and admiration for the young physician.

The entire process was grueling, with Li Zhi working tirelessly until nightfall to save as many lives as possible. His methods were remarkably effective, and even the most critical cases were stabilized.

After finishing, Li Zhi washed his hands in a basin of hot water. The bloodstains slowly dispersed but refused to completely disappear.

"Zhou 香主 (Incense Master), the task is accomplished," Li Zhi said to Zhou Jin, who was wrapped in bandages like a white mummy.

"Some of the more severely wounded will need to stay here for observation. I'm short on hands, so I hope you can leave some men to help me care for them."

Zhou Jin was moved to tears and, without hesitation, dropped his crutch and bowed to Li Zhi, who quickly helped him up.

"It's my duty as a physician," Li Zhi said, his young face filled with a sense of responsibility.

Zhou Jin was taken aback by Li Zhi's words, feeling a mix of emotions. He didn't know what to say, looking at the young physician who seemed so calm and collected despite the chaos around him.
