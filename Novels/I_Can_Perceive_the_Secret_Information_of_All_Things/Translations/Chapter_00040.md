# Chapter 40: The Famous Cultivation Street Roamer of Willow Town  

Winter was the season when all creatures lay dormant—bandits hibernated, and so did malevolent spirits. Intelligent beings, in particular, avoided mischief during the cold months.  

Thus, human towns and cities enjoyed relative peace in the harsh weather, with few incidents involving demons.  

Xiao Ji had now reached the eighth level of Qi Refinement, but he knew it was far from enough. If he were to challenge the headless old monk—a Foundation Establishment cultivator—in the desolate mountains of Falling Scale Town right now, it would be no different from delivering himself as a free, express package right to the man's doorstep.  

His top priority was to improve his cultivation. At the very least, he needed to reach the early Foundation Establishment stage. Only then, with his unique abilities, could he confidently take down the headless monk.  

To advance, he had to work diligently. He even devised a comprehensive cultivation plan:  

- **Morning:** Stroll through the market.  
- **Noon:** Visit the city gates.  
- **Afternoon:** Pay visits to nearby sects.  
- **Evening:** Return to the city gates.  

It sounded simple, but it was a carefully crafted strategy to maximize his daily cultivation gains.  

**Reasoning Behind the Plan:**  
- **Morning Market:** Many townsfolk bought groceries—meat, eggs, vegetables—each with their own stories, especially since they were transported from the spiritual greenhouses of Dragon Soar Prefecture.  
- **Noon at the South Gate:** The busiest time for people entering the city.  
- **Afternoon Sect Visits:** A good opportunity to observe advanced incense-offering practices and learn from established sects, which he could later replicate at his own Primordial Spirit Temple.  
- **Evening at the South Gate:** Many laborers and vendors returned to their villages, providing another chance to gather cultivation points.  

He also made detailed notes:  
- **"The marketplace is a must—every vegetable has a story."**  
- **"The announcement board attracts many newcomers who stop by out of curiosity."**  
- **"Networking with fellow sects is essential—start with the friendlier ones…"**  

True to his plan, Xiao Ji soon became a familiar sight around Willow Town, mingling effortlessly with the locals.  

"Granny Wang, out shopping with your grandson so early?" Xiao Ji leaned in conspiratorially. "Between you and me, the Yu family’s bean sprouts are the best, and their cabbage is fresher and cheaper than Old Li’s. Oh, and Old Li’s scales are rigged too..."  

Granny Wang blinked in surprise. "Thank goodness you told me—I almost forgot I came here to buy groceries!"  

Thanks to cultivators across the land, fresh vegetables were available year-round. Official cultivators didn’t just hunt demons; they also developed innovations for the people, such as **spiritual greenhouses**. These required minimal spiritual energy to maintain ideal growing conditions, ensuring bountiful harvests.  

Though such greenhouses were rare and state-regulated, they supplied produce to towns at reasonable prices.  

After his market rounds, Xiao Ji wandered the commercial street, back and forth.  

"Daoist Xiao, not delivering babies today?" someone called out awkwardly.  

By now, the tale of the "baby-delivering priest" of Primordial Spirit Temple had spread throughout Willow Town. At first, it sounded strange, but people eventually grew accustomed.  

"Childbirth is the mother’s doing," Xiao Ji replied with a smile. "I just cheer from the sidelines."  

As noon approached, he hastily ate a meal before stationing himself at the **South Gate**, observing the comings and goings.  

The gate was a popular spot for idlers, especially elderly men who gathered to play chess in the summer shade.  

Pointing discreetly at a shifty-eyed man, Xiao Ji whispered to a guard, "That fellow? Definitely a disguised bandit."  

The guard, having benefited from Xiao Ji’s sharp instincts before, immediately detained the man for questioning—and sure enough, he was right.  

With that, Xiao Ji’s morning cultivation session concluded.  

**Afternoon Plans: Visiting the Heavenly Net Sect**  

That afternoon, he headed to one of Willow Town’s thirty-two officially recognized sects—**Heavenly Net Sect**, renowned for its thriving incense offerings and far greater prestige than his own temple.  

Primordial Spirit Temple had few demon-hunting successes to its name—only the notable delivery at the Lu household. Townsfolk were pragmatic; efficacy was measured in results. More demons subdued meant greater divine favor.  

Xiao Ji couldn’t help it. Most of his cases for the magistrate involved human disputes, with only occasional demonic hints—none requiring his direct intervention.  

Winter’s dormancy left him few opportunities to prove himself. He’d have to wait for spring.  

His visit to Heavenly Net Sect was deliberate.  

**The Art of Rotating Targets**  

After overstaying his welcome at **Soaring Heaven Sect**—where the sect leader had begun plotting ways to bar him—Xiao Ji wisely chose a new location.  

Sometimes, he lamented how tedious his cultivation method was, earning him the nickname **"Cultivation Street Roamer."**  

But what choice did he have?  

At Heavenly Net Sect, a disciple greeted him politely.  

"Junior Brother Ma Sufeng of Heavenly Net Sect. May I ask which sect you hail from, fellow Daoist?"  

"Xiao Ji, from Primordial Spirit Temple in town. Just passing by for a look," Xiao Ji replied.  

"Ah, a local Daoist!" The disciple smiled warmly. "Feel free to explore. Rest if tired, tea if thirsty."  

...  

**Three Days Later**  

"**Sect Leader! Trouble!**" Ma Sufeng burst into the courtyard like a gust of wind.  

Inside, **Hao Wen**, leader of Heavenly Net Sect, was trimming his toenails—one last clip remaining—when the commotion interrupted him.  

Slipping on his shoes, he grumbled, "What’s the panic? Did a demon swallow you?"  

"No! It’s that Daoist Xiao from Primordial Spirit Temple—**he’s back**," Ma Sufeng panted. "I think he’s **leeching our sect’s spiritual fortune!**"  

"Nonsense. Spiritual fortune can’t be leeched," Hao Wen scoffed. "We’re all just scraping by in Willow Town. Let him visit, as long as he doesn’t steal anything."  

"But he just **wanders around aimlessly**, making everyone uneasy!"  

"Learn from me—stay calm, steady, unshaken," Hao Wen intoned sagely. "Remember: **Keep. It. Stable.**"  

**Seven Days Later**  

"**If he shows up tomorrow, shut the gates the moment you see him!**" Hao Wen snapped, his composure frayed. "Drinking our tea every afternoon with no clear purpose—it’s **disrupting my Dao heart!**"  

Ma Sufeng observed his master and thought, *"Not so steady today, huh?"*
