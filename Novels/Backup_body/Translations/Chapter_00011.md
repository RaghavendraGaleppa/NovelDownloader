# Chapter 11: The Birth of Internal Qi! Slaying the Spirit Beast!

The spirit leopard was too fast, arriving in an instant!

Li Zhengjing had no time to dodge—he could only raise his arms to block!

*Boom!*

A tremendous force struck him, impossible to resist. His feet left the ground as he was sent flying, tumbling over a dozen times before crashing into the house from the courtyard!

The spirit beast landed, its blood qi surging, its aura savage and chilling.

Its crimson eyes locked onto Li Zhengjing, filled with hunger and desire!

This was a spirit beast, untamed and brimming with the instincts of a predator!

Its muscles bulged, making it even stronger and more resilient than Li Zhengjing, who had reached the pinnacle of external martial arts!

Its blood qi had awakened—it had become a demonic beast, comparable to the "Internal Qi" realm!

"Where did this demon come from?"

Li Zhengjing rolled to his feet, not daring to glance at the golden page. He clenched his fists, steadied his stance, and prepared to defend himself.

His arms throbbed with pain. Without even looking, he knew they had been wounded by the leopard's claws and fangs!

Such a wild beast was born with natural weapons—its claws and fangs were like innate blades!

Even an Internal Qi realm cultivator would avoid confronting it barehanded. But now, Li Zhengjing had no chance to flee!

The leopard had already blocked his escape route, lunging at him again!

"Fight it is!"

Instead of retreating, Li Zhengjing charged forward!

The leopard was too fast—he couldn't evade or outmaneuver it. His only hope was to fight desperately, holding out until help arrived from the sect's experts. Only then might he survive!

If he faltered in fear, death would come even faster!

The leopard's claws slashed toward his face. Li Zhengjing barely managed to dodge, but his cheek was torn open. At the same time, he struck the leopard's flank with a punch!

At the peak of external martial arts, his fist carried the force to shatter stone!

But the leopard's body was resilient, its flesh and bones toughened by its awakened blood qi. It withstood the blow, merely staggering before steadying itself.

*Whoosh!*

Its tail lashed out like a streak of golden light!

Li Zhengjing transformed his fist into a palm and caught it!

*Crack!*

His palm erupted in pain—his tiger's mouth had split open, blood gushing!

Without hesitation, his left hand shot out, gripping the leopard's throat to prevent it from biting!

The leopard roared, its hind claws rising to tear into Li Zhengjing's waist!

"Down!"

Li Zhengjing roared back, throwing himself forward and pinning the leopard beneath him, narrowly avoiding its claws!

At that moment, his organs felt as if they had been jolted into chaos, his stomach churning as he nearly vomited blood!

But at the same time, the remnants of the "Five Elements Creation Paste" began soothing his organs, especially his wildly beating heart!

His chest pressed against the leopard's side, and in his daze, as the spiritual energy nourished his own body, he seemed to sense the beast's internal workings—its organs pulsing, its blood qi circulating, every movement crystal clear!

The residual energy of the paste even seemed to follow the leopard's internal rhythms!

"So this is how a spirit beast's organs and blood qi flow!"

Before he could fully grasp the insight, his body was violently flung away!

The leopard had roared, its organs surging with power, its blood qi erupting to send him flying several meters!

The next moment, the leopard pounced again.

Li Zhengjing was exhausted, his strength waning.

Yet his eyes burned brighter than ever!

"I understand now… internal qi, the flow of blood qi… this is it!"

His face smeared with blood, he stood up, took a deep breath, and felt his organs tremble—producing a thunderous sound!

The noise was like a tiger's roar, a leopard's snarl, a thunderclap—shaking the courtyard!

His organs surged as he bellowed, the sound of a mighty tiger!

In that instant, the leopard's eyes flickered, its aura weakening, as if a phantom of a great striped tiger loomed behind Li Zhengjing!

The tiger was the king of the mountains—its majesty was absolute!

Fear gripped the leopard's heart as it saw the phantom pounce!

In its daze, the phantom vanished—only the human youth remained, but now carrying the tiger's might!

No longer prey, he had become the hunter!

"Die!"

Li Zhengjing's eyes were icy. Within his organs, he sensed a fierce, overwhelming energy circulating!

He swung his arm—the energy flowed from his chest to his shoulder, down his elbow, and into his fist!

In an instant, his fist seemed to swell threefold, like a stone mortar!

With all his strength, he brought it down like a hammer from the heavens, smashing into the leopard's skull!

*Crash!*

The leopard collapsed, its skull caved in, brains and blood spraying!

"…"

Li Zhengjing's vision blurred. His fist returned to normal, but exhaustion crashed over him, his sight dimming.

He slumped to the ground, panting heavily.

Staring at the leopard's corpse, he murmured, "I killed a spirit beast comparable to an Internal Qi expert? I… have mastered internal qi?"

---

Outside the courtyard, the outer disciples had been evacuated. Twelve outer sect overseers arrived first.

"Overseer Zhao, the four of us can handle this. You must evacuate the other disciples and guard against more rogue spirit beasts."

Overseer Lin spoke first, standing with Overseers Fan, Zhou, and Wu to secure the perimeter.

The other overseers dispersed as instructed.

Spectators peered through gaps in the broken gate, but the battle had moved inside—nothing was visible.

"Overseer Lin, Li Zhengjing is still inside! That beast will kill him—we must act now!"

The speaker was Xie Guihai, the same youth who had warned Li Zhengjing in the library earlier.

"What do you know? That beast has awakened its blood qi—it's as strong as an Internal Qi expert! We can't rush in recklessly!"

Overseer Zhou retorted, "The four of us must plan carefully before entering!"

Overseer Lin added calmly, "We may be in the Internal Qi realm, but we're past our prime. If we act rashly, we'll only get ourselves killed!"

Xie Guihai fell silent, frowning. *Four Internal Qi overseers, afraid of a single beast?*

Forty seconds had passed since the leopard entered. The roars inside were terrifying.

Li Zhengjing, though talented, was no match for an untamed spirit beast—his guts were likely already spilled.

Xie Guihai sighed inwardly, understanding now.

Then, the roars ceased. Silence fell.

Overseer Fan declared, "The four of us will use the Four Symbols Sealing Formation to capture the beast! Everyone else, stand back!"

"Overseer Fan is right!" Pei Ying stepped forward. "Brothers, save yourselves first!"

Fifty seconds had passed. The courtyard was deathly quiet—the beast must have eaten its fill.

The four overseers exchanged glances and nodded.

If they acted now, they might at least recover half of Li Zhengjing's corpse to honor his spirit.

"Formation! Move in! Save him!"

The four overseers charged inside, shouting, "Beast! Cease your slaughter!"

Then—silence.

Xie Guihai waited outside. No sounds of battle. Had the overseers subdued the beast instantly?

He approached the gate and peered inside.

The four overseers stood frozen, stunned.

Beyond them, he could see two figures on the ground—only their lower halves visible.

"Damn it… the upper half must be gone."

A pang of sorrow struck him—until one of the figures twitched and stood up.

Li Zhengjing, drenched in blood, held a knife in his left hand and something else in his right.

He studied the overseers, then grinned—his torn face making the expression ghastly.

"You brought me leopard whip. Should we stir-fry it with ginger, braise it, or steam it? I prefer steaming, but the stench is awful."

His blood-streaked smile was terrifying, his killing intent palpable.
