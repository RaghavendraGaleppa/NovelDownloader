# Chapter 169: Yes, That Girl Right There, Get Her Out Here!

Three days ago.

In a corner booth of the "Joyful Lamb" Hotpot Restaurant, several Jianghu travelers sat eating. They had ordered five portions of lamb, dipped in sesame sauce, sweating profusely from the heat, unable to put down their chopsticks.

They looked nothing like the terrifying assassins they were supposed to be.

But that was exactly what they were.

They were all Human Butchers from the Drizzle Pavilion.

"I wonder why the Cloud Province branch suddenly issued the 'Storm Approaching' order. What could it be for?"

"I've kept my blade sheathed for a long time; it's time for a big job. With the turbulent situation in Cloud Province City right now, it's the perfect time to fish in troubled waters."

One of them spoke up. He was a bald man with no eyebrows and a particularly ferocious face.

Within the Drizzle Pavilion, assassins had no hierarchical relationships among themselves. However, this 'Storm Approaching' order was issued directly from the main pavilion.

"I heard that our Pavilion's Saintess will also be coming to Cloud Province this time," said another assassin, his entire body wrapped in black bandages, his tone mysterious.

"Is Lady Heavenly Demon coming too?"

"Even she has been stirred. It seems the Pavilion has a major plan in motion."

The assassins were all shocked.

The Heavenly Demon Saintess of the Drizzle Pavilion was the most brilliant genius assassin of the new generation, known for having assassinated three prodigies on the Hidden Dragon List.

It was said that her appearance was ever-changing, making her impossible to guard against, and her swordsmanship was incredibly诡异.

"It seems we will have to cooperate this time," said the eyebrow-less assassin, his eyes turning grim.

After exchanging glances, the other assassins nodded.

They seemed to hold this bald assassin in great awe.

"Brother Bald, I'll drink to you."

"This hotpot is really good. I wonder if there's a branch in Cloud Province City?"

"After the job is done, I'm definitely going to eat a couple more plates of lamb."

The assassins were chatting away.

Suddenly, an assassin who had remained silent the entire time, his eyes suddenly turned profound.

"Look, who is that?"

"Hm?"

The other assassins were taken aback.

This assassin was also extremely famous, known as the Death-Eye Peerless Blade. When he looked at someone with that kind of gaze, it meant he had killing intent, and that person was as good as dead.

"Li Mo?"

Every assassin, upon arriving in a new place, would first go to the Dark Pavilion to exchange information, and would naturally see various bounties.

Li Mo's portrait had appeared on the bounty list.

And the price was not low.

High price, low cultivation level. Perhaps because of his status as a true disciple of the Clear Abyss Sect, no one had managed to collect the bounty yet?

"Is he also going to the Martial Arts Summit?"

"We can take on this job right now."

"Let's do it after leaving Ziyang Prefecture. It's too close to the Clear Abyss Sect here..."

The assassins quickly came to an agreement.

After eating a few more plates of lamb, they used their tracking skills to follow the Clear Abyss Sect's convoy.

Until today, when they confirmed that no senior sect members were following them, they finally made their move.

And so, they blocked the path of the Clear Abyss Sect's carriage.

"This mountain was carved by me, this tree was planted by me!"

"Hey, we're assassins! Why are you shouting that nonsense?"

"Ahem, it's for the atmosphere..."

Believe it or not, with their bizarre attire and strange weapons, the assassins did exude a certain killing aura as they stood there.

"If you know what's good for you, hand over Li Mo."

"As for the rest of you, I can spare your lives," said a swordsman with narrowed eyes in a deep voice.

"Me?"

Li Mo, who had just stepped out of the carriage, was stunned.

He had thought they were just bandits blocking the road. He didn't expect to be called out by name the moment he got off the carriage.

"Heh, you'd better be smart about this," sneered the assassin who came from a bandit background. "See these几位? They are all Human Butchers from the Drizzle Pavilion, assassins so terrifying they can stop children from crying at night."

"This one here is known in the江湖 as the Blood-Hand Vulture. For every person he kills, he pulls out one of his own hairs. After he went bald, he started pulling his eyebrows. Look how bald he is—aren't you scared?"

"And to my left, the Death-Eye Peerless Blade. Anyone he has ever looked at with narrowed eyes has never lived to see the next dawn!"

"Of course, the one behind me is even more of a heavyweight. Legend has it that the souls of those he kills are absorbed into his body, branded onto his skin. And when he unwraps his bandages, it's a night of ten thousand ghosts!"

---

"And me, the Jade-Faced Flying Dragon..."

The assassin calling himself the Jade-Faced Flying Dragon rambled on and on.

The disciples of the Clear Abyss Sect looked at them with suspicion.

"What are their cultivation levels?"

"Observing the Spirit level. The highest one is probably at the Three Apertures stage."

"Then what are they so arrogant about?"

"Stop children from crying at night? Do they not know who Li Shidi's master is?"

The disciples even suspected that these clowns were just here as a distraction. But after a quick scan, there were no other ambushes nearby.

The senior and junior brothers and sisters were a bit confused, but they didn't attack immediately.

"Heh, I know. It's hard for you to accept just letting him go without a fight."

The one calling himself the Jade-Faced Flying Dragon puffed out his chest. "How about this: I'll pick one of you for a one-on-one duel, so you can see my prowess."

His eyes scanned the crowd.

As is well known, some people are natural protagonists and are more likely to be the center of attention.

For instance, the Ice Cube.

He pointed a finger.

"Yes, that girl right there, get her out here! Come and witness this young master's skill!"

Ying Bing: "?"

Li Mo: "....."

Jiang Chulong: "Brother Li, why are you covering my eyes?"

Li Mo sighed. "It's not something a child should see."

The scene was brutal.

Even Ouyang, who had been furious just a moment ago, swallowed his saliva, thinking that perhaps these buffoonish assassins didn't deserve such a fate.

The disciples of the Clear Abyss Sect all looked up at the sky, consciously keeping watch.

Soon.

The heavily injured assassins were all subdued.

"Tie them up first," said Shen Yunfei, the eldest senior brother.

"I'm an expert in this area," Ouyang volunteered, stepping forward to tie them up.

A moment later.

A group of assassins was tied up in a tortoise-shell bound, looking small, pitiful, and helpless.

And humiliated.

Li Mo: "Shixiong, you're very skilled at this."

Ouyang scratched his chin and chuckled awkwardly, "Hehe, art comes from life... Practice is the only way to test the truth."

Li Mo: "....."

"What should we do with them?"

"These assassins claim to have killed countless people. I don't think they're good birds. We might as well just kill them and eliminate a threat to the people."

"Yeah, it's better to kill this kind of evil cultist."

"I wonder why they were looking for me?"

The senior and junior brothers and sisters began discussing how to deal with them.

The assassins looked at the tortoise-shell bound ropes on their bodies and recalled the experience of being tortured by that female... female demon just now.

Who the hell are the real evil cultists here?

Li Mo narrowed his eyes.

He activated his Heaven's Fate Divine Eye.

【Name: Zhang Erdan】

【Age: 41】

【Bone Constitution: Toad Skin】

【Cultivation: Observing the Spirit, Two Apertures】

【Evaluation: In the Uninterrupted Trial ten years ago, he relied on his keen sense of smell to pretend to be a corpse and survived until the end. He wraps his entire body because his skin is ugly and pockmarked.】

【Recent Encounter: Ordered by the main pavilion's 'Storm Approaching' order to head to Cloud Province City】

Toad Skin... what kind of bone constitution is that...

But that's not the point.

Li Mo's eyebrows raised slightly.

'Storm Approaching' order?

So, the Drizzle Pavilion has designs on Cloud Province?

It's not that he likes to meddle in other people's business, but his group would also be staying in Cloud Province for a while. If a major chaos breaks out, they won't be able to stay out of it.

Thinking of this, Li Mo said:

"Why don't we temporarily restrain these people and imprison them for interrogation?"
