# Chapter 90: Li Mo Acts Like a Tough Guy, Please Keep It Up

“Huh?”

Although he knew Ice Cube definitely didn’t mean anything by it, Li Mo subconsciously took half a step back.

He couldn’t help it. He had read too many novels in his past life.

He had, on occasion, dabbled in genres like *“The Dominant CEO Falls in Love with Me.”*

“The Taiyin star was too intense the other day, and I haven’t fully recovered yet. I can’t completely control my internal energy.”

“If we go through the clothes, you might get hurt.”

Ying Bing’s light words carried little emotion.

Hearing them made Li Mo feel like he was the one being overly sensitive.

If the Ice Cube herself didn’t care, what was the point of him being so shy and hesitant?

“Alright.”

Li Mo took off his upper garment.

The candlelight flickered softly.

The current Li Mo was no longer the sickly,先天不足 (congenitally deficient) young master who had just left home.

He had a lean yet muscular build that was defined even through clothing, with clear lines of muscle hiding immense strength.

He had grown a few centimeters taller, now standing at least 180 centimeters.

Compared to those with skeletal structures like tiger arms, leopard waists, or mantis legs, his physique looked much more harmonious.

“Uh... what about the pants...?”

Li Mo asked very seriously.

Ying Bing frowned slightly, her eyes still looking like frozen shattered jade.

*What do you think?*

Li Mo coughed lightly, not feeling awkward, and sat down beside her.

A faint, cool fragrance drifted in the air.

His shoulder felt a bit itchy. Was it her hair?

Li Mo’s mind was a bit of a mess.

As everyone knew, he was a normal young man. If one counted his memories from the Blue Star, his most intimate contact with the opposite sex was limited to holding hands and hugging his high school girlfriend.

And now.

He was facing the peerless Ice Cube, whose beauty was practically a foul against the rules.

And she wasn’t even wearing a shirt.

“Turn around.”

Ying Bing commanded again.

Li Mo stiffly turned his back.

Then he saw that between the five fingers of her jade-like hand, a dark blue light swirled and churned, exuding a terrifying chill.

“My internal energy will enter your Dantian.”

“First, try to get close to it with your own internal energy so you aren’t injured by it.”

“If you can withstand it, we can proceed to the next step.”

“Okay.”

Li Mo retracted his chaotic thoughts, looked her in the eyes seriously, and nodded.

Actually, he didn’t know if it would succeed.

After all, whenever internal energy entered his body, it would disappear without a trace. He still didn’t know the reason why.

Ying Bing nodded slightly.

Then, her cool palm gently placed itself on Li Mo’s Dantian.

Immediately, the dark blue light scattered, turning into wisps of icy blue starlight that roamed the surface of his body.

It was cool.

But it felt much better than it had on the arena that day.

And it didn’t disappear.

Seeing that he had no adverse reactions, Ying Bing continued.

The icy blue spots moved from the surface of his skin toward Li Mo’s Dantian.

“Haa...”

Li Mo’s breath now carried a chill, as if his entire body were soaking in an ice bucket.

The bone-piercing cold radiating from the inside out didn’t cause him pain, just some stiffness and numbness.

However, this was only because his body was exceptionally strong.

If it were an ordinary person...

Li Mo couldn’t help but glance at the girl opposite him. Her expression was solemn and focused.

What she had endured since childhood... must have been worse than this, right?

She didn’t practice body tempering.

Yet she had to endure a coldness stronger than this every day.

No wonder the Ice Cube had this kind of personality...

“Focus.”

Ying Bing’s tone was light, yet it felt indisputable.

This was the Ice Cube in her training mode...

Li Mo snapped back to attention.

He began to use the method recorded in the first layer of *“Phoenix Singing in the Sky,”* circulating his own internal energy to wrap around the dark blue energy in his Dantian.

His comprehension of martial arts hadn’t gone to waste; he felt as if he had performed this kind of operation countless times.

The two streams of internal energy were like dough, kneaded together by him, and then spread out at the right time.

“Hmm?”

The closed-eyed Ying Bing’s eyelids twitched.

The time he took to condense his internal energy was very short.

But the quantity of his internal energy was actually greater than hers?

That would be fine, after all, he had been training with Shang Wu recently, so it wasn’t incomprehensible.

The main thing...

His Dantian was just too resilient?

Ying Bing had wanted to stop inputting her energy a few breaths ago, but Li Mo’s Dantian seemed to contain everything, bottomless.

He really could act tough.

---

“Any discomfort?”

“Turn up the intensity.”

Li Mo grinned.

Ying Bing didn’t speak, silently channeling her internal energy.

Half an hour later.

The input suddenly stopped.

Li Mo opened his eyes and looked at her.

His eyes held some confusion:

“Why did you stop?”

“I’m out.”

Ying Bing was somewhat silent.

By the way.

Was Li Mo’s physique strong because his Dantian was naturally strong, or was it because he was too suitable for body tempering, causing his Dantian to become much stronger later on?

If it was the former, then his physique was practically not below hers...

“Alright.”

“I’m already healed.”

Li Mo said with confidence after carefully sensing it.

Actually, what he mainly did was control his own internal energy so it wouldn’t burn Ying Bing’s away.

Originally, according to martial arts records, harmoniously coexisting with different types of internal energy wasn’t easy.

Li Mo hadn’t felt much difficulty.

“It’s your turn.”

“Mm.”

Ying Bing nodded to indicate she was ready.

Li Mo followed the same method.

The next second.

She felt a stinging pain in her Dantian. Although Li Mo was trying his best to control it, the leaking aura was still filled with the purest meaning of destruction.

“Mmm...”

Ying Bing’s expression didn’t change, and she didn’t make a sound, but a flush instantly appeared on her small face.

Li Mo controlled his internal energy, watching her expression, and asked quietly:

“Can you still go on?”

Ying Bing bit her lips.

The determination and pride in her eyes were almost overflowing.

“No problem.”

“Okay...”

Li Mo felt she probably wouldn’t force herself to the point of death, so he continued.

Only, he put even more mental effort into controlling his internal energy.

...

Time passed.

In Ying Bing’s Dantian, the icy blue and dark blue internal energies intertwined.

She had succeeded.

Just the process was much more difficult than Li Mo’s.

It wasn’t that the martial art itself was difficult, but the boy’s internal energy was too wild and fierce. Even if its owner was helping, the process wasn’t easy.

“We can proceed to the next step.”

“Okay.”

“The first acupoint, Tianzhui.”

According to the acupoints recorded in the martial art, the two streams of internal energy constantly shuttled back and forth between the two bodies.

Every time, it was a different acupoint.

Li Mo’s face had remained normal throughout.

But Ying Bing...

Occasionally, the sensation in the acupoints was too intense, causing her body to tremble uncontrollably.

The night grew deeper.

Half the night had passed.

*“Phoenix Singing in the Sky”* was finally fully circulated by the two of them, flowing through hundreds of acupoints in sequence.

“How do you feel?”

“The effect is excellent.”

Li Mo opened his eyes, his spirit vibrant.

Ying Bing: “Shall we continue?”

Accepting a foreign energy for a long time was, after all, an external object and would cause a certain burden on the body.

But with her physique, although it would be uncomfortable to continue, it was possible.

It was just that Ying Bing felt somewhat mentally exhausted.

She had to maintain twelve points of focus throughout the entire process.

“Better to stop before it’s too full. I really am tired too.”

“Let’s sleep, let’s sleep.”

Mainly.

Inside the World Seed, Princess Jiang was looking for her Master, so he couldn’t afford to ignore it.

Youth is a wonderful thing.

He fell right asleep.

Ying Bing, for some reason, let out a sigh of relief when she saw him fall asleep.

It seemed he couldn’t go for a second round.

结束了第一次双修 (Finished the first dual cultivation).

Ying Bing also lay down flat, closing her eyes.

Quietly waiting for midnight to arrive.
