# Chapter 53: Myriad Immortal City

Without a doubt, just by hearing its name, this cultivation method was clearly wood-attributed.

"Is this the Fourth Prince's primary cultivation method?" Lu Xu wondered, flipping through it.

This technique covered both the Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment stages, totaling thirteen layers, and came with two divine abilities. Its characteristics included abundant magic power, vigorous vitality, and the ability to extend one's lifespan.

"I'll put it away for now; perhaps I'll rely on it later!" Lu Xu continued to examine the Fourth Prince's storage bag, soon pulling out another cultivation manual.

"Why does this guy carry so many cultivation methods?" Lu Xu couldn't help but be surprised.

Seeing the name "《Phoenix Rider Yang-Replenishing Art》" on the cover, Lu Xu roughly understood what kind of method it was. He opened it, and indeed, it was a dual cultivation method. Moreover, it was specifically the type that leaned towards absorbing yin to supplement yang.

Generally, there are three types of dual cultivation methods: absorbing yin to supplement yang, absorbing yang to supplement yin, and yin-yang mutual benefit. The first two benefit only one party, while the latter benefits both. If a dual cultivation session were likened to making a cake, the former two would be one person devouring the entire cake alone, while the latter would be two people sharing it equally. Although the cake made through yin-yang mutual benefit would be larger, the amount each person gets after sharing is ultimately less than what one would gain by devouring a slightly smaller cake alone through the first two methods. Therefore, in the cultivation world, aside from true Dao companions who share a deep understanding, very few adopt dual cultivation methods that promote yin-yang mutual benefit.

In fact, even devouring the entire cake alone is considered good; some cauldron cultivation methods are even more sinister. They directly extract the cauldron's cultivation and life force to create an even larger cake, which the practitioner then devours entirely.

"Water fostering wood... so that's why this Fourth Prince pursued Mo Qingchan!"

Putting away the cultivation methods, Lu Xu found nothing else of value in the Fourth Prince's storage bag. After cleaning up the traces in the cave, he rode his Green Wind Skiff towards Myriad Immortal City.

Three months later.

On the outskirts of the Myriad Demon Mountain Range, a streak of green light sped from the distant horizon. Standing on the Green Wind Skiff, Lu Xu gazed into the distance. A vast, boundless grassland stretched out, like a verdant green carpet laid across the earth. At the edge of the prairie, majestic mountains rose abruptly, towering and grand, their upper peaks covered in white snow. Years of accumulated snow had formed glaciers, shimmering with golden light under the sun.

"I laugh with the mountain spirit, our heads full of clear snow, impossible to melt," Lu Xu suddenly recalled a poem he had read in his previous life. "I'm only thirty; it'll be a long time before my head is full of 'clear snow,' or perhaps it will never happen in this life!" Lu Xu thought, touching his hair.

The Green Wind Skiff beneath him trembled, accelerating forward. In the center of the grassland, a lone small hill appeared. It wasn't tall, only about seven or eight zhang high, but standing on the vast, flat land, it was exceptionally conspicuous. Numerous tall buildings stood on the small hill, and further out, encircling the hill, three towering city walls rose. Between these three walls, a large number of buildings stood, collectively forming a massive city. This was the commercial and trade center of the Nine Eastern Barren Nations—Myriad Immortal City!

The prosperity of this immortal city was unmatched by any other city in the nine nations. The sheer number of cultivators gathered here alone reached forty to fifty thousand. To support such a large congregation of cultivators, a complete industrial chain was naturally required. Unlike Green Lake Market, which was built around farming, everything in Myriad Immortal City revolved around hunting demonic beasts and exploring the Myriad Demon Mountain Range. In fact, the very foundation of this immortal city was seized from demonic beasts from the beginning.

At the heart of Myriad Immortal City lies a Tier 3 high-grade spirit vein, located within that small hill. In the beginning, there was no grassland here at all; the entire region was a landscape of towering peaks, part of the Myriad Demon Mountain Range. A Tier 3 Great Demon once occupied this place, possessing the Tier 3 spirit vein. Later, the ancestors of the Myriad Immortal City Merchant Alliance arrived, slew the Tier 3 Great Demon, flattened the surrounding peaks, and laid the initial foundation of the immortal city. Through continuous refinement by later generations, and a series of methods involving leveling mountains and filling valleys, Myriad Immortal City gradually took on its current appearance.

"Destroying mountains and breaking peaks, changing the landscape... the power of a Golden Core True Person is truly unfathomable!" Looking at the flat expanse of land, Lu Xu couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion. Such methods as flattening peaks and filling valleys were beyond the imagination of Qi Condensation cultivators.

He continued to fly forward, gradually noticing more and more streams of various colored lights around him. Occasionally, giant skiffs could be seen crossing the sky; these were flying skiffs, slow in speed but capable of carrying large amounts of goods to and from the nine nations. When he was only a few li from the immortal city, Lu Xu felt a huge pressure emanating from the sky. He had entered the range of the flight restriction array. He put away his Green Wind Skiff and descended to the ground, walking forward. Myriad Immortal City was entirely enveloped by a Tier 3 high-grade grand formation. Only with the Merchant Alliance's permission could one fly within the formation's covered area. A large number of cultivators gathered at the city gate. Lu Xu joined the crowd, slowly moving towards the city.

"First-time visitors, please register here. The entry fee is three spirit stones, allowing a stay of half a month in the city. After half a month, if you do not have a fixed residence, you will be escorted out!"

"What is your name, fellow Daoist?"

"Han Feiyu!"

At the city gate, a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator was specifically stationed there, flanked by dozens of cultivators above Qi Condensation Layer 5, dressed in artifact armor, serving as order-maintaining guards. When it was Lu Xu's turn, he gave this false name. The registering cultivator glanced at him, recorded the name "Han Feiyu," and noted his cultivation level: Qi Condensation Layer 7.

"Fellow Daoist, do you intend to stay long-term or short-term?"

"Long-term!"

"This is your identity token. Fellow Daoist, please take this token to the Immortal Residence Hall in the outer city to rent a cave mansion!"

After Lu Xu paid three spirit stones, the registrar gave him a token and directed him on where to rent a place. All land in Myriad Immortal City belonged to the Merchant Alliance, and naturally, only the Merchant Alliance could conduct the business of renting out residences.

The immortal city was divided into three areas by three massive walls: the largest was the Outer City, where the spirit veins were only equivalent to Tier 1 spirit veins. Further inside was the Inner City, where the spiritual energy concentration was equivalent to Tier 2 spirit veins. However, only core disciples of the Merchant Alliance and some Foundation Establishment rogue cultivators were qualified to reside there. The innermost area was the Core Area, which was the small hill Lu Xu had seen from outside. The spiritual energy there was Tier 3, and the Merchant Alliance's Golden Core True Persons and major Foundation Establishment cultivators resided within.

After browsing the Outer City for a while, Lu Xu headed directly to the Immortal Residence Hall.

"The spiritual energy in this Fire Cloud Lane is equivalent to a Tier 1 high-grade spirit vein. Out of the 274 residences in the lane, 43 have earthfire rooms, and one is currently available!"

"What's the rent?"

"Thirty spirit stones a year. A minimum five-year lease is required, and all spirit stones must be paid upfront!"

"Then I'll rent it for five years for now!"

After Lu Xu paid 150 spirit stones, he received a token. This was his long-term residency proof in the city, and also the key to controlling the formation of that courtyard. Yes, compared to the simplicity of Skygate City and Green Lake Market, the courtyards in Myriad Immortal City finally had formation protection. This formation was a partial power split from the Tier 3 grand formation protecting Myriad Immortal City itself. Its functions were basic and its defensive power limited, but it was a step forward nonetheless.

Holding the token, Lu Xu arrived at the residential area. Here, independent courtyards were neatly arranged, planned beautifully. Each was a standalone unit, and once the formation was activated, outsiders could not peer into the interior, offering excellent privacy. Arriving before his rented residence, number sixty-two, Lu Xu activated the token with his magic power, and the two large doors instantly opened. He stepped inside.
