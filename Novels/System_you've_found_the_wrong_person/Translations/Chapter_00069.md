# Chapter 69: Special Admission

**Universal Love!**

This was the core philosophy of the Mohist School.

To love others as one loves oneself—love without distinction or hierarchy, impartial and without favoritism—thus establishing equality among all people.

In this world, martial arts reached divine heights.

The concept of Universal Love was no longer an abstract ideal but a force capable of manifesting unparalleled power.

The Mohist treasure, the **Ring of Universal Love**, was hailed as the embodiment of equality for all beings.

Liu Baiyu's expression shifted. He hadn't expected the Mohist Grandmaster to send their sacred treasure in advance—especially to Gongshu Duwang, a descendant of the Gongshu family, who had been locked in a thousand-year feud with the Mohists.

Zhao Wudao's face grew solemn as he stared at Gongshu Duwang, his gaze filled with deep wariness.

If the Gongshu and Mohist factions truly united, they would become invincible.

With the **Ring of Universal Love** suppressing cultivation realms, and the sheer numbers of the **Colossus Soldiers**, who could possibly stand against them?

Dou Changsheng also realized something—this was Gongshu Duwang's true trump card. It didn’t matter whether his opponents were Earth Ranking Grandmasters or Pure Yang Grandmasters. With his own cultivation level activating the ring, only a handful in the world could resist its effects.

Once their realms were suppressed to the ordinary **Divine Marvel** stage, the seemingly background figures like **Leng Wuye** would suddenly become formidable.

While the **Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King** Liu Baiyu could currently overpower a single Leng Wuye with one hand, what if his strength was reduced? Could he defeat three? Or five?

The scene fell into silence as everyone contemplated this terrifying possibility.

This also revealed another truth: Gongshu Duwang’s **Colossus Soldiers** were not as overwhelmingly powerful as imagined. Likely, only the Leng Wuye model was truly perfected, while other high-tier variants were custom-made by Gongshu Duwang—not standardized, and impossible to mass-produce.

But this was only temporary. If Gongshu Duwang advanced the study of mechanical arts and more martial artists took up the craft, the future was unpredictable. Just the fact that the Mohists were willing to assist Gongshu Duwang meant the **Colossus Soldiers** could be refined further.

Alternatively, he could travel to Changzhou to complete the fragmented blueprints of the **Colossus Soldiers**.

In Dou Changsheng’s future timeline, if that version of Gongshu Duwang received support from the future Dou, he would undoubtedly soar to unprecedented heights.

Du Changwang felt a fraction of his worries ease. His mind settled.

Gongshu Duwang was reliable—he had prepared thoroughly, anticipating the Mohist Grandmaster’s absence and securing the **Ring of Universal Love** in advance.

If the ring could be enshrined within **Great Liang City**, guarded by the **Colossus Soldiers**, the city would become an impregnable fortress. The threat of the northern barbarians would vanish.

But that was merely wishful thinking. The **Ring of Universal Love** was a Mohist treasure—how could outsiders be allowed to enshrine it?

---

Gongshu Duwang slowly rose from atop the **One-Horned Savage Tiger** and spoke solemnly:  
*"Let this plaza be the boundary."*  

*"Under the **Ring of Universal Love**, all beings are equal."*  

*"Anyone who wishes to participate—even those watching from beyond—may join."*  

*"Victors may claim the blueprints of the **Colossus Soldiers**."*  

*"If the imperial court prevails, we acknowledge our inferior skill and will assist in dismantling the northern barriers, ensuring free passage between the North and Liang."*  

Liu Baiyu’s voice was heavy. *"You planned this long ago."*  

*"Otherwise, why invite Jin Wuming and Dou Changsheng?"*  

His gaze swept the surroundings as he sneered. *"**Innate Profound Realm**?"*  

*"Jin Wuming and Dou Changsheng are merely here to make up the numbers."*  

*"The Gongshu clan lacks such prodigies."*  

*"But the Mohists have no shortage of geniuses."*  

*"The tenth-ranked on the current **Human Ranking**—**Nine Precepts Daoist, Zhao Feile**—must be here."*  

Liu Baiyu’s mocking tone revealed Gongshu Duwang’s scheme. This was not just about speaking for Liang—it was also about mending relations with the Mohists by setting up this grand stage.  

Gongshu Duwang was willing to stake the reputations of established experts to elevate a younger generation.  

If the veterans won, it was expected—they had decades of fame. But if they lost? It wouldn’t be complete disgrace, but it would mean being stepped on by a junior’s rise.  

Lin Sanxing asked pointedly, *"Master Gongshu, you’ve gone to great lengths."*  

*"Striving for a win-win outcome—truly painstaking."*  

His eyes shifted to Dou Changsheng and Jin Wuming. The roles of these youths were now clear. They weren’t mere spectators—Gongshu Duwang surely had rewards for them.  

Even if the imperial court won, Gongshu Duwang wouldn’t lose. Who could decipher the ancient **Colossus Soldiers** blueprints?  

Even if the Prime Minister—renowned as a polymath—could read them, transforming the designs into reality would be nearly impossible alone. Not due to incompetence, but because his duties were vast: governance, mediating the martial world—where would he find time to study the blueprints?  

Recruiting Gongshu Duwang into the court would be inevitable.  

If the court failed and others obtained the blueprints, they would still need Gongshu Duwang’s expertise.  

From start to finish, Gongshu Duwang never intended to burn bridges. He sought collaboration—funding, manpower—to fuel his research.  

As long as he didn’t monopolize the prize, no one could easily dismantle his scheme.  

---

Du Changwang remained calm. After all the commotion, Gongshu Duwang’s true motive was laid bare: **he wanted funding** for his mechanical arts research—an incredibly costly pursuit he could no longer sustain alone.  

His secondary goal was promoting mechanical arts, aspiring to become its patriarch—a new **Gongshu Zi**.  

The affairs of Liang? Merely a means to an end.  

He had manipulated the situation, gathering factions to clash—how else would the value of his craft be recognized?  

Who would take him seriously if he simply knocked on doors?  

Gongshu Duwang could accept any outcome—because none could bypass him.  

If the imperial court didn’t win, it was a victory for Liang.  

With the **Colossus Soldiers** and Liang’s wealth, a **Prince of Liang** was inevitable.  

In peaceful times, the court would never relent. But with the northern barbarians looming, the rise of mechanical arts wasn’t a bad thing—it could bolster the empire’s strength.  

As long as things didn’t escalate, any result was acceptable.  

With the Du family’s wealth, as long as they avoided rebellion, their prosperity was assured.  

Lin Sanxing suddenly interjected, *"The **Innate Profound Realm** is too high."*  

*"Many young talents here are only at the **Innate True Realm**."*  

*"At that level, they’d have no chance."*  

His eyes rested on Dou Changsheng. *"Make it the **Innate True Realm**."*  

*"I have ties to the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou."*  

*"If Dou Changsheng leaves empty-handed, how could I face the Wangs again?"*  

*"And no weapons—relying on superior arms would be dishonorable."*  

Gongshu Duwang scanned the crowd. Seeing no objections, he inwardly sighed before declaring:  

*"Then we’ll use Dou Changsheng as the benchmark."*  

*"Agreed?"*
