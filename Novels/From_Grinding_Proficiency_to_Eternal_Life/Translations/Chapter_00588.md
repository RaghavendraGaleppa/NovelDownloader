# Chapter 588: Just an Ant Realm

Having sorted through the gains from his recent cultivation, Xu Yunfan’s gaze once again fell upon the chaotic ruins of this collapsed world.

The Heavenly Emperor’s Dao Fruit had already been divided, but the battle for the Western Buddha’s Tathagata Dao Fruit was far from over. From time to time, earth-shattering fluctuations of collision could be felt coming from the distant horizon.

“Hm?!”

Xu Yunfan sensed it clearly—it seemed that the power of the Pusa Pure Land had joined the fray. The final wave of impact was unmistakably the Dao Fruit fluctuation of the Pusa Pure Land.

It should be the Great Awakening Bodhisattva from the Western Extremity Subduing Demon Hall, who wields the Dao Fruit of Nirvanic Red Lotus.

Just as I thought. How could the Pusa Pure Land miss out on such a grand world?

Although they missed the appetizer, the Tathagata Dao Fruit of the Western Buddha was still an extremely precious treasure.

Xu Yunfan stroked his chin, not particularly surprised.

The three major sects of the Taihua Void Realm—none of them would ever be willing to fall behind.

They were all fiercely competitive.

His gaze shifted.

In the collapsed Heavenly Palace ruins of this world and the corners of the lingering secret realms, there were still many final treasures of this world.

They were being frantically snatched by the Primordial Origin Sect, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, and the desperate cultivators of this world.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes grew increasingly excited.

Good, the more chaotic, the better. That way, he could naturally fish in troubled waters.

The Heavenly Realm was already at its end, and now demons were running rampant. This was the perfect time to capture Foundation Establishment level experts to fill the Heavenly Star Sovereign Banner.

The karma of killing in this world would not be transmitted back to the Taihua Void Realm, so Xu Yunfan would naturally not let this opportunity slip by.

Now that he had reached the late Foundation Establishment stage, it was time to start preparing for the matter of seeking gold and proving the Dao Fruit.

Although he had the Attribute Panel, which allowed him to smoothly guide the fruit and successfully step into the Golden Core stage, this was only the simplest step in advancing to a Golden Core True Lord. The subsequent Heavenly Tribulation and even the Human Tribulation were the most troublesome parts.

What if a True Lord launched a sneak attack on you?

It was utterly shameless.

Now that the Divine Thunder Nine Palaces Celestial Dome Indestructible True Scripture had reached perfection and he had entered the late Foundation Establishment stage, his strength had increased greatly. With the Star Spirit Banner in hand, if not now, when?

He was still far from the goal of gathering the 365 Star Sovereigns to form the Heavenly Star Constellation Great Array and advancing the Star Spirit Banner to the level of a Spirit Treasure.

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated.

The root qi of this world was still residual, but for him to stabilize his proto-heaven, it was like a drop in the bucket.

Condensing his own immortal golden nature could not be achieved in a hurry; it required quiet comprehension of that strand of innate golden nature. Although the Attribute Panel could assist, the time required was not short, and it was not cost-effective to comprehend it within this Heavenly Realm world.

There was no great meaning in staying any longer.

Three years.

In this abyssal fissure, on the edge of the True Lord’s Dao Realm’s influence, he had cultivated in seclusion for three full years, like a磐石 (rock), absorbing the last essence dissipated from the world’s collapse.

Now that his cultivation was complete, it was time to go out and pick up some trash.

Xu Yunfan immediately waved his sleeve, and the light of several concealment formations and illusion arrays that had been maintained for many years flashed, silently dispersing.

In an instant, the noisy roars of the chaotic energy currents outside, the chilling killing intent emanating from the intense battles in the distance, and the almost tangible death and tribulation qi that filled the heavens and earth surged into his perception.

There was still a fight nearby?

Xu Yunfan’s eyes held a strange light. The three layers of concealment techniques around his body instantly operated to their peak. The powerful physique forged by the Divine Thunder Nine Palaces Celestial Dome Indestructible True Scripture activated the contained lightning starflame, turning his entire body into a faint purple shadow as he shot up from the bottom of the abyssal fissure.

Breaking through the churning magma and thick dust, the moment he left the abyss, his vision suddenly opened up, but it was also more shocking.

The sky above had long lost its clarity.

Giant cracks like spiderwebs stretched across the void, their depths revealing a terrifying dark chaos. Fierce spatial storms, like greedy beasts, continuously tore and devoured the remnants of the world.

Xu Yunfan was inwardly shocked. The Dao of the Taihua Void Realm was slowly pulling this world into itself.

Colorful yet destructive energy currents raged across the heavens, mostly the aftermath of the collision of True Lord-level spells and divine abilities.

The Heavenly River that once flowed like a jade belt above the immortal palaces was now only a intermittent, turbid band of light, like a dying giant serpent convulsing and struggling, occasionally flickering with a faint glow.

Wherever his gaze fell, the earth was shattered and floating, divine mountains had collapsed and crumbled, palaces with carved beams and painted rafters had turned into dust and fertile soil, and burning immortal trees and spiritual roots had already become charcoal.

The air was filled with a thick, lingering scent of blood, a pungent mix of burnt, medicinal, and resentful killing intent, and...

A heavy scent of the world itself being devoured, the Dao sending forth the final taste of its journey towards complete death and decay.

The devouring of a world was actually so terrifying.

Just as he shot out of the abyss, glanced at his surroundings, and felt a moment of emotion, a sharp, piercing shriek, carrying a sharp killing intent that made one’s skin and bones chill, shot out from the ruins of a collapsed palace complex to the side like a maggot附骨 (sticking to the bone).

Its target was his heart.

Fast!

Fierce!

Devious!

What shot out was not a sword qi or a treasure, but a flying needle only an inch long, its entire body flowing with a cyan-golden luster, shaped like the stinger of a wasp. The penetrating power condensed on it was a hundred times that of an ordinary flying sword. It also carried a sinister, devious, and treasure-protecting spiritual light-corroding aura.

A flying needle treasure refined by the Primordial Origin Sect?

“Drilling Heart Needle?!”

But how sharp was Xu Yunfan’s spiritual sense? The moment he came out, his spiritual sense spread out like mercury, alert for his surroundings, so he naturally instantly discerned the incoming object.

This was a Yin-evil artifact of the Demon Sect, specifically designed to break protective spiritual light. It was tempered with a potent poison, and those hit by it would often have their souls paralyzed and their physical bodies崩坏 (shatter) and die.

The ambusher had clearly seized the moment when he was distracted.

The timing was excellent.

If an ordinary mid Foundation Establishment cultivator were to encounter such an ambush, caught off guard, they would either die or be severely injured.

However, Xu Yunfan was already in the late Foundation Establishment stage, his spiritual will was powerful, and his physical body had been tempered to a level that was inconceivable for his peers.

His eyes turned cold, and he didn’t even bother to turn around.

His forward momentum did not stop in the slightest, and he couldn’t be bothered to cast a spell. His right arm simply shot backward in a backhand arc.

His fist silently sliced through the air.

On the fist锋 (edge), a layer of extremely fine, rapidly rotating紫金 (purple-gold) lightning gang instantly condensed.

Beneath his skin, a golden crystal color flashed by.

“Ding!!!”

An ear-piercing metallic clang that could tear the soul apart suddenly exploded.

That cyan-golden毒针 (poison needle), which could penetrate a thick steel shield and melt protective spiritual light, seemed to have撞上 (struck) the center of gravity of the entire world the moment it touched Xu Yunfan’s bare fist.

The Yin-evil spiritual light, sharp power, and corrosive aura condensed on it were directly shattered and disintegrated from the point of contact by the tyrannically unreasonable immense force on the fist锋, combined with the contained purple-gold lightning gang that could destroy all methods.

Puff!

The poison needle didn’t even leave a white mark on the skin that was flashing with a metallic luster before turning into a puff of cyan-black metal powder, instantly scattered by the violent fist wind.

“Hmph!”

Simultaneously, a muffled groan filled with unbelievable shock came from within that palace ruin.
