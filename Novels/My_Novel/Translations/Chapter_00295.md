Chapter 295: Steady Progress, Clam Oil Body Refinement, Cauldron Boiling, and a Woman at the Door

Li Xian destroyed the "Water Gold Nest" and exchanged heads for merit money, obtaining one tael of merit silver and three hundred coins of merit currency.

The several boxes of gold, silver, and jewels he acquired were transported back to the Green Ox Residence. Nan Gong Liu Li had spent the night alone, feeling desolate and lonely. In the past, she had always been annoyed by Li Xian's endless tricks and how he bullied her in various ways. Yet, when there was no one to bully her, she felt anxious and hurt.

Since moving into the Green Ox Residence, she had never been separated from Li Xian. This brief separation of half a day made her realize how hard it was to part with him. Worried all night, she paced back and forth and practiced her swordplay, remaining awake until dawn.

Seeing Li Xian, she finally let out a sigh of relief. Li Xian was considerate and gentle, serving her tea and water, and inquiring about the bandit-suppressing matters. Upon hearing that Li Xian had been in the bandits' lair but still took the opportunity to do good deeds, she couldn't help but applaud and praise him for doing an excellent job.

She massaged his shoulders with her delicate hands, her gaze falling on his profile. A thought fleetingly crossed her mind: "This wicked little brother seems to have no flaws. He is handsome, has a strong sense of principle, is clever and alert, and his martial talent is truly that of a dragon or phoenix. With his unique Pure Yang Qi Robe, if I were to take him as my husband, though he is wicked and always bullies me... I don't seem to be truly annoyed by it."

"I wonder what he thinks of me..."

Thinking of this, Nan Gong Liu Li's face flushed crimson, and her heart pounded. But she wouldn't ask. She knew Li Xian's nature well; his answer would surely be sweet beyond measure, and she suspected it wouldn't be genuine anyway.

Then she thought again:

"Hmph!"

"He's quite a flirt. Ten days ago, a seductive elder came knocking at night. Since then, he's been getting very close to her, even going out together. Who knows what kind of shady business they're up to? That seductive elder wants to eat you alive, don't you know that!"

"Regardless, he and I have already... Although it was under the pretext of cooperation, such a shameful act shouldn't be treated so lightly."

Her gaze was tender, yet sometimes filled with worry. The force of her massage varied from heavy to light.

Li Xian embellished the story of suppressing the bandits, making it sound thrilling—how he fell into a dangerous situation, sustained serious injuries, fought back at the brink of death, and ultimately turned danger into safety. Nan Gong Liu Li lifted his clothes to check, and seeing he was completely unharmed, she was both exasperated and amused, not knowing what to do with this rascal of a brother.

After a moment of tenderness, they got down to business. Li Xian had confiscated three boxes of jewels, but the wooden boxes were of a thick-bottomed design, appearing large but having little actual space. The jewels only covered the top layer, while the inside was empty. He gathered the jewels and spread them out on the table. The candlelight reflected off them, making the pearls and gems dazzling, but he couldn't help but complain a little, as it didn't meet his expectations.

Nan Gong Liu Li shook her head and smiled, telling Li Xian that jewelry and fine artifacts were always packed this way. If they were truly piled up in a box, they would scratch each other during transport, damaging their appearance.

Furthermore, jewels were rare to begin with. If they were packed in a full box, it would be hard to show off their luxury and prestige.

There was also the principle that "what is full will overflow."

If treasures are packed to the brim, they will spill out.

Hearing this explanation, Li Xian had an epiphany and felt he had learned a valuable lesson.

Nan Gong Liu Li ground the ink and held the brush, her eyebrows slightly raised, meticulously recording the jewelry and artifacts. She said, "Raise it a bit."

Li Xian did as he was told, lifting a green jade pendant high. Sunlight shone through the jade, fully revealing its color, texture, and patterns. Nan Gong Liu Li smiled and said, "Not bad."

With elegant handwriting, she wrote "Green Jade Dragonfish Pendant." Then she recorded the next piece of jewelry: a shimmering乳 white gem, a yellow stone jade wall, an embroidered cloud-scroll painting...

She had exceptional knowledge. From family feasts and gift exchanges of fine artifacts and jade in the past, she had been exposed to them and was well-versed in the value and quality of jewelry. At a glance, she could identify the quality, texture, and name.

After recording several pages, her pretty face was slightly flushed, and she was very happy. She estimated that the jewelry and fine artifacts were worth over five thousand taels. Each item recorded felt like money coming in, adding up little by little. As the manager of the household, this sense of achievement and joy was something she couldn't find elsewhere. Li Xian said with a smile, "Sister Liu Li, take a look. Is there anything you particularly like? If there is, I'll give it to you."

"You do have a conscience." Nan Gong Liu Li would have looked down on these jewels in the past. Though they were valuable, they were too ostentatious, as if deliberately showing off wealth, which was rather tacky. The Nan Gong family's wealth was immense, and there was no need to show off deliberately.

Today, however, her mood was excellent, and since it was a gift from Li Xian, it felt different. Looking at the glittering jewels and exquisite items, she gradually developed a fondness for them. She picked out a necklace and two hairpins... carefully inserting them into her dark hair. The pearl's luster complemented her, adding to her beauty.

Nan Gong Liu Li looked at herself in the mirror, her eyebrows slightly raised, very pleased. She asked, "Do you think it looks good?"

Li Xian said, "It looks very good, like a celestial maiden descending to the mortal world." Nan Gong Liu Li couldn't hide her joy, her heart sweet, and she嗔道, "Celestial maidens descending to the mortal world always end up benefiting mortals in the end."

Li Xian laughed and said, "Then, Sister Liu Li, are you willing to benefit me?" Nan Gong Liu Li said aggrievedly, "If I say I'm not willing, you wicked bandit, you'll just be rude to me again." Then she said softly, "So, I can only let you benefit."

Seeing Nan Gong Liu Li's deepening affection, Li Xian said, "Sister Liu Li, I have something else to do."

Nan Gong Liu Li frowned and said, "Is it important? Can't you postpone it?"

Li Xian said, "It can be postponed, but..." Nan Gong Liu Li said, "Then postpone it. Have you forgotten? We have a sincere partnership. You didn't come back last night, so you owe me a debt."

Li Xian said with a smile, "Sister Liu Li, if you're so calculating, you'll end up hurting yourself in the end."

Nan Gong Liu Li said proudly, "Little brother, I was letting you win before. Do you really think you're that great? In my eyes, you're just so-so."

Li Xian said coldly, "Alright, then let's wait and see." Nan Gong Liu Li raised her eyebrows slightly. She was best at provocation, but Li Xian never took the bait. Seeing Li Xian's aggressive demeanor, she felt both a little afraid and a little happy. She哼了一声, her face flushed as she said, "Am I afraid of you? Things are different now. What can you do to me?"

Li Xian thought to himself: "This woman sometimes really needs to be taught a lesson."

Dusk fell.

[Avoiding Turbid Qi in the Five Organs and Meeting Yang Meridian. Strengthening Organs Chapter]
[Proficiency: 5821/8000 (Minor Accomplishment)]

Li Xian fought until evening, faintly feeling a slight depletion in his body. He sat cross-legged under a fruit tree to practice internally, circulating the turbid qi of his five organs to nourish his essence and blood. The "Avoiding Turbid Qi in the Five Organs and Meeting Yang Meridian" was worthy of being a "Pure Yang Treasure Scripture" and a "General Outline of Pure Yang Martial Arts." This path was greatly beneficial, and Li Xian reaped endless benefits.

He practiced until his organs were flawless and his energy was vigorous. Then he raised his spear again and began practicing the残魍枪法 (Wraith-Devouring Spear Technique). The Peach Blossom Spear turned into a red light, using thrusts, stabs,拨, and劈 to hone and improve the martial arts he had learned. His spear intent condensed, becoming unstoppable, and his will merged with the spear.

The spear shaft trembled and flicked upwards. He executed the "Collapse Stance," his whole body shuddering, with faint roars of thunder and wails of ghosts. Leaves rustled down, the pond water rippled, fish leaped onto the shore in fright, and a bird flying past was startled into the courtyard.

The bird's eyes rolled white, its wings twitching. It was so frightened that its claws flailed wildly.

Nan Gong Liu Li was filled with admiration. She saw Li Xian's spear art becoming more and more refined, his speed steady. If he were to use his full strength with the spear, his brilliance would surely be dazzling. She recalled their first meeting. At that time, Li Xian was not weak, but compared to the younger generation of the Nan Gong family, he seemed a bit rough and had many shortcomings. The more she interacted with him, the fainter this feeling became. Gradually, she realized that Li Xian was rapidly absorbing nutrients and strengthening himself.

His future achievements were beyond her estimation. She was also young, and her experience in judging people was shallow. But later, when Li Xian's accomplishments shook the world, she would look back on this time and surely feel a sense of belated realization.

After a short rest, she went to cook and stir-fry dishes. The Green Ox Residence was quiet and pleasant. When the hot dishes and fine rice were ready, the two of them enjoyed the fading sunlight and ate together, feeling peaceful and comfortable.

The next day.

Li Xian called for "Han Zisha," intending to sell all the gold, silver, and jewels. Han Zisha had already heard about yesterday's events—how Li Xian single-handedly wiped out the bandit den, his bravery and valor, killing hundreds of bandits and eliminating the bandit leader, causing a great stir and making him the center of attention.

Han Zisha looked over the jewelry and fine artifacts, nodded slightly, and said with a smile, "Young Master Hua, these jewelry and fine artifacts, I estimate, can be sold for three thousand taels. Moreover, they are black market goods, so there's a risk in selling them. If we sell them through the black market, we'd likely have to take a fifty percent discount, and it would be hard to get even one thousand five hundred taels."

Li Xian said with a smile, "Elder Han, the way you're talking is no fun. Are you trying to fool me because I don't know the value? This batch of jewelry is worth at least five thousand taels." He casually picked up a jade pendant and continued, "This Mother-and-Child Warming Jade Pendant alone is worth one hundred and thirty taels. If you want to hear it, I can even tell you the origin and history of each treasure one by one."

Han Zisha pouted slightly. She thought to herself: "This kid is really hard to fool. He actually knows quite a bit about appraising treasures. How can a young man be so knowledgeable about miscellaneous subjects? It's really difficult to get a bargain from him." She said, "Alright, alright, let's say it's five thousand taels. You kid, you don't even believe what the elder says, what can I do?"

Li Xian said, "Then I'll have to trouble Elder Han to help me sell them. As for the remuneration, we'll stick to the old agreement, a seventy-thirty split." Han Zisha嗔道, "You're really treating me as your laborer? Last time I helped you sell honey, it was because I happened to be passing by. My bee farm and flower farm also have things to sell. This time... your jewelry, though valuable, isn't worth my while to make a special trip, which would take ten days or so."

"Even if it's worth five thousand taels, if we go through the black market, these jewels would sell for at most three thousand taels. I only get three percent, which is nine hundred taels. This amount isn't small, but it's not huge either. But for me to make a special trip, what do you think? Add to that the cost of food and lodging along the way, and social expenses, wouldn't I be making a trip for nothing?"

Her beautiful eyes held a smile, her tone seductive. She continued, "Unless..." She stepped closer, placed her hand on Li Xian's shoulder, and circled him. A fragrant breeze blew towards him, her breath carrying the scent of orchids. She said, "Unless... we go back to the room to discuss it. Out here, it's a transaction, but inside, it's a matter of friendship. Since it's friendship, why bother calculating gains and losses so precisely? Don't you agree?"

Li Xian frowned slightly. What Han Zisha said was reasonable. The jewelry was valuable, but after several transactions, the money obtained would decrease. He pondered: "Although Han Zisha has ulterior motives, her calculation of this account is correct. Asking her for help is a bit too much. Forget it, in that case, I'll wait a few months and give it to her to sell along with the honey butter. As for her 'inside and outside friendship,' if I really had a friendship with her, her greed would be even greater. I'm afraid she'd skin me and take a layer of flesh."

He immediately stated his decision directly.

Han Zisha felt a bit disappointed. She stepped back a few steps and carefully examined the jewelry. Seeing that the quality was truly excellent, she turned and said, "It's a real waste to keep these fine artifacts with you. I have another idea, would you like to hear it?"

Li Xian asked, "Please speak, Elder Han."

Han Zisha said, "Why don't you sell them to me first?" Li Xian immediately became wary: "I can sell them, but I don't accept payment in kind."

Han Zisha, annoyed, glared at him. Though her style had always been like this, being so guarded against made her feel unhappy. She then said, "I get it, you're so precious, who would even want you." As she spoke, her gaze drifted, sweeping over his face. She thought, "...Actually, I do find him quite desirable."

"But if you sell them to me, I'll only offer two thousand taels."

Li Xian pondered for a moment and felt it was feasible. The jewels were windfall profits; one must know how to give up some benefits. If you try to take all the benefits for yourself, it's easy to invite backlash. Moreover, for a long-term cooperation with Han Zisha, occasionally taking a small loss is a good long-term strategy. So he said, "Alright."

Han Zisha's face brightened. She crossed her arms and said, "Looking at you, you've probably never personally operated a cauldron before?" Li Xian said, "What do you mean?"

Han Zisha said, "What I mean is, I can give you the two thousand taels right now. But... tomorrow I will be operating the cauldron to boil a 'refined meal.' If you're willing... you can watch from the side. I'll give you a piece of the refined meat. You can consider it as tuition, and you can take five hundred taels less from me."

Li Xian felt a pang of toothache. "What kind of tuition is worth five hundred taels?" Han Zisha said, "These things, if no one teaches you, no matter how smart you are, can you handle them? Boiling a refined meal involves progress in martial arts. If you violate taboos, offend others, and cause trouble, the losses will be much more than five hundred taels."

Li Xian said, "Deal."

Han Zisha then said, "Alright then, come with me to get the silver."

Hua Liu Town had no curfew, and though it was late at night, there were still pedestrians on the streets. Tao Hua Town and Hua Liu Town had similar styles, with streets, shops, and folk customs almost identical. Li Xian followed Han Zisha back to her residence. It was a house with excellent feng shui. Red apricot trees were planted in the courtyard, their branches lush and many poking out of the walls.

Li Xian thought sarcastically: "The house is like its owner, all flowery and showy."

Han Zisha walked gracefully, leading him to a side door. She said, "Come in." Li Xian walked in confidently, crossing the threshold. He followed Han Zisha as she walked through the courtyard, seeing that the arrangement of flowers and plants was quite tasteful. The courtyard followed the principles of the five elements mutually generating and restraining. Even without human maintenance, the vegetation, flowers, streams, and rocks complemented and restrained each other, always maintaining the best scenery.

He suddenly noticed a strange object. In a misty pool, there was half a giant clam shell. "Elder Han, what is this?" Han Zisha said, "This is a lake clam, salvaged from a deep lake. Are you interested in it?"

Li Xian said, "Just curious." Han Zisha's eyes darted, and she said, "This lake clam is no ordinary thing. It secretes a thread of clam oil every day, which can be used for 'soaking and nurturing' the body."

Li Xian had heard Nan Gong Liu Li speak of the four essentials of martial arts: "eating, nurturing, training, and soaking." Eating refers to treasures, related to cultivation transformation, technique paths, and lifespan. Training refers to martial arts, related to martial arts attainment, means and abilities, and the foundation for survival. Soaking refers to medicinal baths, which forge the physique and heal injuries, and is often inseparable from martial arts. Some martial arts require a medicinal bath to practice further. Eating and training are relatively easy, while soaking is a bit more difficult.

"Nurturing" refers to cultivating health and habits, refining one's temperament. Martial artists seek resonance with heaven and earth, and their temperaments vary. Nurturing the soul and mind to be full is also of utmost importance.

Purchasing herbs, placing them in the lake clam shell to boil, the clam oil seeps out and blends with the medicinal soup. Used for daily nurturing and training of the physique, it is greatly beneficial. Li Xian trained diligently in martial arts. Every time he thrust his spear or drew his sword, though it trained his physique, there was also wear and tear. He had long known the importance of soaking and nurturing, but his family's financial situation was shallow. Money had to be spent on the blade's edge, and his physique was very strong, with a perfect self-healing ability far superior to other martial artists, so soaking and nurturing were not his top priority. Thus, he had not paid attention to it.

Han Zisha said with a smile, "How did you take a liking to this thing? Sell it to you for a thousand taels." Li Xian said, "Too expensive."

Han Zisha said, "You, you know the value of gold, silver, and jewels, but you might not know the value of this thing. This clam shell stores water essence, which is very special. When you put herbs in it to refine, the clam shell will seep out clam oil under the heat of the fire. This clam oil is the best carrier for 'medicinal power.' It carries the medicinal power and nourishes the skin."

As she spoke, she flipped her hand and took out a dagger, lightly划 a line on her palm. A blood trail appeared on her palm. She applied pressure, and the blood trail healed rapidly. Li Xian was very curious. Han Zisha smiled lightly and said, "This is the effect of the 'Yuan Healing Soup.' I am boiling the Yuan Healing Soup bath in the clam shell. The clam oil soaks into the physique, storing the medicinal power in the skin. When you are truly injured, you can activate the medicinal power and heal your injuries in an instant. Such a wonderful effect, aren't you tempted?"

Hearing the words "store water essence," Li Xian secretly took an interest. Upon hearing the miraculous effect of the clam oil, it was indeed extremely rare. He thought to himself: "Han Zisha never tells the truth. But the clam shell is rare, and storing water essence is indeed a fact. If I place it in my residence, it can strengthen the five elements arrangement and attract mist, setting up a water and mist maze." He immediately spent a thousand taels and agreed to buy the clam shell.

He received another five hundred or so taels and carried the clam shell back to his residence. Han Zisha found it amusing and warmly saw him off. This clam shell would attract water mist, so it was placed in a pool. It did seep out clam oil, but the amount had been decreasing for years. She rarely used it now, and even found it very annoying. It attracted water mist, making the house damp and stuffy, too hot in summer and too cold in winter. She had long wanted to sell the "clam shell" and had even tried to transport it outside the lake for sale.

Once the clam shell left the Dongran Lake, it couldn't adapt to the new environment. It became an ordinary clam shell and even developed a fishy smell. How could she sell it? If she just threw it away, she would be a bit reluctant. This time, she successfully sold it, which was truly the best of both worlds.

She felt very pleased. By her calculation, she had only spent five hundred taels to get "five thousand taels" worth of jewelry. She had told Li Xian that selling through the black market would result in a discount. But she had other channels to sell them, and she could get the full five thousand taels.

Li Xian carried the clam shell on his shoulder and hurried back to the Green Ox Residence with swift steps.

Nan Gong Liu Li saw the strange clam shell and came over to examine it. Li Xian told her its wonderful use. Nan Gong Liu Li said, "You made a deal with that seductive woman, aren't you afraid of being cheated?"

Li Xian said with a smile, "She was definitely trying to fool me, but I have other plans. I'm going to use this thing to set up a water and mist maze." He immediately chose a spot and placed the clam shell.

At night, the water vapor was dense. The clam shell contained "water essence," and layers of white mist gathered around it. The summer heat immediately dissipated, and waves of coolness and refreshment washed over them.

Li Xian waved a water flag, guiding the water vapor. He made the mist from the clam shell drift towards the flowing streams, making the water shimmer. The excess mist drifted towards the flowers and plants, nourishing them and making them glisten with dew.

He worked through the night to arrange the five elements, adding another layer of water and mist maze to the residence.

If a thief were to break into the courtyard, with the flowers obscuring their eyes and the mist blinding them, they would lose their direction and become confused within. Nan Gong Liu Li was very happy, and a tender, sweet feeling welled up in her heart. She knew that Li Xian had bought the clam shell and deepened the maze mostly for her sake. With her unique identity, being confined to the residence, if a thief were to launch a surprise attack, this maze situation could help her a lot.

The next day.

Li Xian got up at the Mao hour (5-7 a.m.), practicing until his Qi lake surged. He accumulated dozens of points of proficiency, feeling his body's blood like a spring gushing forth, his breath like scorching waves. His martial arts were progressing further. After breakfast, he went straight to the inner island to purchase "herbs."

To prepare the "medicinal bath soup."

Li Xian, taught by Wen CaiShang, was already proficient in pharmacology. He matched the properties of the herbs and formulated a "Qi Accumulating and Essence Supplementing Soup" on his own. After buying the herbs, he returned to the Green Ox Residence to prepare them.

"Storing water essence, that does seem to be true. I still need to test if I can actually boil out the clam oil. If it doesn't work... I can use this as an excuse to get some money back from Han Zisha."

He filled the clam with water and boiled it with a strong fire. Then he added various herbs one by one. The medicinal properties boiled and volatilized, turning the soup blackish-brown.

Suddenly, a white oil seeped from the clam shell.

The medicinal soup mixed with the clam oil, turning from blackish-brown to milky white, and a faint fragrance arose. Li Xian was very curious. He sniffed the medicinal aroma carefully; the medicinal properties had not changed.

After it was fully boiled, Li Xian took off his clothes and soaked in it. The medicinal potency flowed into his body, nourishing his meridians and organs, feeling extremely comfortable and pleasant.

Li Xian's "eating, nurturing, training, and soaking"... only "training" was decent. Eating, nurturing, and soaking were all done half-heartedly due to financial constraints. Now, soaking in the medicinal bath was like sweet rain after a long drought, and his physique was improving rapidly.

In the milky white medicinal soup, his body was like flawless white jade, delicate as silk. His lines were sharp and strong. His strength and flexibility had both increased.

The clam oil's effect was not bad. The medicinal potency accumulated in his skin, staying without dissipating, remaining without stagnating, and could be moved and used at any time. If the medicinal soup had a miraculous healing effect, and he could fight an opponent while constantly enjoying the therapeutic benefits, he would already have a significant advantage.

Li Xian tested the effect. His eyes swept over it and found a tiny crack at the bottom of the clam. Though the clam shell's effect was wonderful, it was already at the end of its life. After being boiled by the strong fire, cracks appeared on its body.

"If it were brand new, how could Elder Han be willing to sell it to me?"

Li Xian smiled magnanimously.

After soaking in the medicinal bath and washing away his fatigue, he began practicing spear and sword again, improving his martial arts attainment.

[Wraith-Devouring Spear]
[Proficiency: 3989/15000 (Minor Accomplishment)]

Evening approached.

Han Zisha was about to operate the cauldron to boil the refined meal. Li Xian was a newcomer and didn't know much, so he followed behind her, learning the process and details of boiling the refined meal. Han Zisha usually wore revealing clothes, half-concealing and half-revealing, extremely charming. Today, for boiling the refined meal, she was dressed very properly, in a brocade robe, with a silver hairpin and a step-swaying ornament...

It was clear she took this matter very seriously.

She first took two hundred taels of silver, scattering wealth to set the stage. Starting from the side door of her residence, she set up a banquet along the street for several miles. Any commoner who passed by could join the feast and eat.

Li Xian asked, "Elder Han, is there a specific meaning to this?"

Han Zisha said, "As elders, we can be stingy about other things, but we can't be stingy at this time. When we operate the cauldron, the water we boil is the dew tax paid by the commoners, that is, the dew from the flowers and plants. Setting up a banquet is, first, to give back to the commoners. Second, to inform the other elders that I am about to operate the cauldron, so they shouldn't clash with my time."

Li Xian felt he had learned something. He thought that if this point were overlooked and the cauldron was operated directly, it would offend many people.

The cauldron for boiling refined meals in the water altar is called the "Water Stone Treasure Cauldron." It stands high on "Wanglong Mountain." As soon as Li Xian entered the water altar, he saw the treasure cauldron from afar.

There was only one Water Stone Treasure Cauldron, shared by many elders. To avoid disputes and fights over the cauldron, this custom evolved: whoever "scatters wealth to set the stage" first gets to use the cauldron first. If anyone doesn't follow the rules and acts forcefully, they will be jointly condemned.

After the banquet was eaten and the commoners had dispersed, the disciples of the Flower Cage Sect remained. They congratulated Han Zisha on operating the cauldron, praising her for taking another step forward in her martial arts cultivation. They all spoke auspicious words.

Han Zisha smiled and nodded, and took out some more silver to reward these disciples. The disciples who received the money would then gather and talk, helping to recruit more companions, calling over dozens of people. These people, having received the money, would need to help with miscellaneous tasks, running errands. They could not only get paid but also get a share of the soup.

Han Zisha paid half of the hiring money upfront, and by this point, she had already spent over a thousand taels.

Li Xian was secretly amazed, feeling that martial arts were a money-burning endeavor. He recalled how Wen CaiShang, when operating the cauldron at the One Harmony Manor, was straightforward and efficient. She just had to say the word, and the leader would help her handle everything.

After the preliminary matters were handled, Han Zisha led Li Xian and dozens of Flower Cage Sect disciples towards Wanglong Mountain. It was now nighttime, and the disciples of the Flower Cage Sect inserted torches along the mountain path. The mountain path of Wanglong Mountain was relatively gentle, and the road was paved with bluestone slabs, making it convenient to transport water and charcoal back and forth.

They arrived at the summit.

The mountain wind howled, and the Water Stone Treasure Cauldron stood quietly. This treasure cauldron was about four zhang tall, with a round top, and its entire body was entwined with vines and grass, lush and full of vitality.

Li Xian looked into the distance. The lights of the town were dim, giving a sense of climbing high and looking at the mountains, with all other mountains being small. Li Xian asked, "Elder Han, why is the cauldron placed so high? Wouldn't it be inconvenient to travel back and forth?"

Han Zisha said, "Ordinary treasure cauldrons require constant input of water, which consumes a great deal of manpower along the way." Li Xian secretly nodded. He had personally transported water and knew the difficulty. Han Zisha said, "We use dew as our water source and don't need a large workforce to support it. Naturally, we don't need to work our laborers to death."

"But during the boiling process, dew is easily contaminated with turbid qi and turns into ordinary water. That's why the treasure cauldron is placed high up."

Li Xian thought: "So that's how it is. I paid for the tuition, so if I have any questions, I must ask them clearly. Otherwise, wouldn't it be too much of a loss?"

He observed his surroundings, and whenever he noticed the slightest difference, he would ask about the reason. Even if Han Zisha wanted to give a vague explanation, Li Xian wouldn't let her, and would continue to ask. This made her so annoyed that she finally spoke frankly; some questions she didn't know the answer to either.

Han Zisha walked around the cauldron a few times. Confirming that the cauldron body was unharmed, she raised her palm and slapped it虚ly. A "click" sound was heard, and the vines and grass all peeled off the cauldron body. She then waved her hand and said, "Prepare the water!"

The Flower Cage Sect disciples ran down Wanglong Mountain. The mountain path was gentle and paved with bluestone slabs. All the disciples possessed "inner Qi," so their speed was very fast. Torches had already been set up along the way, making the path bright.

At the foot of Wanglong Mountain, there was a pavilion dedicated to managing and storing "dew water." The disciples filled their containers with dew and carefully transported them to the mountain, pouring them into the Water Stone Treasure Cauldron.

After an hour of such busy work, the cauldron was half full of dew. Han Zisha nodded and said, "Prepare the charcoal!"

The disciples went to work again. There was a wooden shed on the summit, where Han Zisha and Li Xian sat and rested. Han Zisha said, "To boil a refined meal, you must first prepare the water, then prepare the charcoal."

Li Xian said, "Is it because after transporting the charcoal, your hands will dirty the dew water?"

Han Zisha nodded and said, "Yes and no. This is a trick that others don't know. I'll only teach it to you, as it can save a lot of money."

"This dew... isn't free. It needs to be purchased with money. One bucket costs one tael of silver. And dew is 'water from the clear root,' 'pure water'..."

"But the disciples who transport the water back and forth are mortals of the俗 world. They sweat and bleed. If their sweat drips into the dew, it will affect the quality of the dew."

"That's why we prepare the water first. At this time, they are full of energy and won't sweat much, so the quality of the dew is slightly better and more耐煮耐久. Using this method, boiling a refined meal can save hundreds of taels of silver."

Li Xian said, "I've learned, I've learned. So that's why Elder Han specifically boils it at night?"

Han Zisha said, "Of course. Under the scorching sun, it's uncomfortable for them to transport water, and they'll be sweating profusely. I'll also be uncomfortable getting sunburned. If my skin gets sunburned, who will compensate me? Skincare also costs a lot of money."

Huaiyin Prefecture was famous for its "Yin Bamboo Charcoal." It was slightly expensive but of excellent quality. When burned, the heat penetrated the cauldron, but the surroundings were not hot.

Midnight.

All the preliminary matters were finally completely finished. By this time, Han Zisha had already spent "two thousand seven hundred taels." The labor costs for the Flower Cage Sect disciples were nearly a thousand taels, purchasing "dew water" cost eight hundred and seventy-two taels, and purchasing "Yin Bamboo Charcoal" cost over nine hundred taels. Burning the charcoal and heating the cauldron, the boiling of the refined meal began.

The firelight shone softly.

The entire water altar was a bit brighter.

The dew water was very耐煮. The water in the cauldron boiled and churned, but it didn't evaporate. Han Zisha added the "refined meat," which was a faint purple-black color, about the thickness of an arm.

She had prepared two "Heaven-Containing Caskets." After the refined meal was successfully boiled, she would immediately taste some and store the rest in the caskets. Martial arts cultivation requires careful calculation.

Li Xian remembered everything. If he raised enough money, he would also operate a cauldron. In the latter half of the night, he only needed to keep the water level constant and pour in dew water once in a while to maintain the boiling progress.

Li Xian had seen everything he needed to see. He didn't stay much longer. Han Zisha wanted to probe Li Xian's background and wanted to keep him at the mountain cauldron for a chat. Li Xian refused straightforwardly, making Han Zisha feel very helpless.

Two days passed like this.

The refined meal was successfully boiled.

Li Xian asked for the account and calculated the expenses... For the three days of operating the cauldron, a total of three thousand seven hundred taels of silver were spent. He secretly felt that starting a martial arts path was difficult. Elders like them could use the sect's resources; "water," "charcoal," and "manpower" were all ready-made, and they only needed to pay money.

If he were to establish his own sect and start his own manor, the "cauldron" would be the primary challenge. Treasure cauldrons have always been extremely heavy, involving purchase, transportation... all sorts of difficulties. Li Xian gained a deeper understanding and increasingly admired Wen CaiShang.

Managing a manor is much more difficult than joining a sect.

Han Zisha, according to the agreement, gave Li Xian a piece of refined treasure meat, about the length and thickness of two fingers, with a milky white texture. It contained the essence of heaven and earth. Li Xian felt a bit dazed. Having eaten "Human Yellow Essence Treasure" several times, he had almost forgotten the taste of this ordinary "refined meal."

Li Xian packed it in a Heaven-Containing Casket.

Returning to the Green Ox Residence, he used a jade dagger to cut it in half and gave half to Nan Gong Liu Li.

He said, "We have a sincere partnership. According to the agreement, half of the refined treasure is yours."

Nan Gong Liu Li was both moved and delighted. They were already very familiar with each other, so she didn't refuse. Instead, she blinked and asked with a smile, "Is it just because of the partnership?"

Li Xian said softly, "I'm very grateful to you. Apart from the partnership, purely for personal feelings, I wanted to share it with you." Nan Gong Liu Li's beautiful eyes rippled with emotion, and she said with a smile, "Wicked little brother~" Her voice was extremely sweet.

This "refined treasure meat" came from the soft belly of the "Red-Eyed Demon Turtle." The essence of heaven and earth is rare in the world. Human Yellow often appears, but without great fortune, it's very difficult to encounter.

The "refined treasure meat" contains an extremely important chain of interests. Purchasing and hunting demons are full of hidden rules.

[You consumed Red-Eyed Demon Turtle meat, Culinary Skill, Proficiency +89]

The refined meal entered his stomach and turned into waves of coolness. The essence of heaven and earth filled his body cavity, totaling "one hundred and seventy-four threads." After the gain from Culinary Skill, it became over three hundred threads. Li Xian felt the essence flowing out of his body and was immediately stunned.

Nan Gong Liu Li urged, "Why are you in a daze? Don't consolidate your blood and close your pores, and circulate your Qi through the Heavenly Circuit!"

Li Xian immediately circulated his Qi through the Heavenly Circuit, consolidated his blood, and closed his pores, trying to intercept the essence of heaven and earth. However, he still couldn't stop the essence from overflowing. He only managed to intercept about half, one hundred and sixty-two threads.

He couldn't help but laugh. It turned out...

The last two times he had consumed refined treasure, it was "Golden Scale" and "Yellow Nine Ginseng," both Human Yellow treasures. These refined treasures contained a large amount of concentrated essence of heaven and earth, and they wouldn't disperse. Once eaten, they would immediately adapt and remain in the body.

But when consuming "refined treasure meat," one needed to use methods like circulating Qi through the Heavenly Circuit and consolidating blood and closing pores to intercept it. The higher the realm, the closer the physique is to heaven and earth, and the more essence of heaven and earth one can intercept.

Nan Gong Liu Li asked with concern, "Is something wrong? Are you uncomfortable?" She saw Li Xian as if in thought and was very worried. Before he had completely stabilized the essence in his body, she immediately came over.

Li Xian saw the genuine worry in Nan Gong Liu Li's eyes and suddenly thought: "In this world, besides my little brother, I'm afraid... I'm afraid only Sister Liu Li truly cares about my injuries?" His expression softened instantly, and he said, "I'm fine."

Nan Gong Liu Li reached out to touch his forehead and嗔道, "You're really something. Did you suffer qi deviation? Or should you slow down with that ghost spear? You... if you get hurt, I... I'll be so heartbroken." She saw that Li Xian's Wraith-Devouring Spear was progressing smoothly and rapidly, feeling both happy and worried.

Li Xian said with a smile, "I... I've just eaten too much essence of heaven and earth." Nan Gong Liu Li嗔道, "You're not being serious at all! You really deserve a beating." Seeing Li Xian's expression, she figured he was really okay.

[Bone-Shaping Embryo]
[Proficiency: 3/100]

Li Xian's martial arts attainment was progressing rapidly. The moment he consumed the "refined treasure meat," his long-dry physical body, nourished by sweet rain, instantly digested thirty threads of essence of heaven and earth.

His martial arts realm took a step forward.

This transformation gradually went deeper into his physique, involving the bones of his whole body. Li Xian digested the essence of heaven and earth, starting with the transformation of his skull, which emitted a faint greenish glow. It was hidden within his flesh and blood, making it difficult for outsiders to see.

[You digested the essence of heaven and earth, Proficiency +1]

He progressed steadily like this.

The digestion of the essence of heaven and earth needs to be paired with diligent martial arts practice. After Li Xian and Nan Gong Liu Li consumed the refined treasure, they often sparred and trained together.

Nan Gong Liu Li had long since entered the second realm of martial arts. The first realm, 'Consuming Essence,' has nine transformations. The second realm, 'Grand Simplicity,' also has "six advancements." Each advancement makes the realm more powerful.

The realm does not directly increase combat power.

But the Grand Simplicity realm is the transformation of bone quality. It must be accompanied by an increase in "strength" and an enhanced ability to withstand blows. The transformed bone quality is like a solid barrier, protecting the whole body.

Moreover, a person's inner Qi is generated from the growth of their inner heaven and earth. The higher the martial arts realm, the closer the body's constitution is to heaven and earth, and the naturally more powerful the inner Qi that grows.

Furthermore... those with higher realms have a higher degree of martial arts evolution.

Nan Gong Liu Li's martial arts strength was very high. Coming from a powerful family, she had many methods. When they first met... her strength and ability had already reached the "fourth advancement" attainment. In an ordinary match, with her rich foundation, she had a real advantage.

But in terms of adaptability and flexibility, she was far inferior to Li Xian. Even if her martial arts and realm were superior, if she were to fight an enemy, it would be hard to gain an advantage.

But now it was different.

Li Xian had just entered the "Bone-Shaping Embryo" realm, also known as the "Grand Simplicity" realm. But with his fierce spear techniques and the Pure Yang Qi Robe, just these two things were enough to completely suppress Nan Gong Liu Li.

Nan Gong Liu Li always suffered losses, and when she did, she felt a bit unconvinced. Her "Gathering Turbid Gauze" also had a miraculous effect. But it was shaken and thrown into disarray by the "Pure Yang Qi Robe."

Ethereal fairy sounds and her family's martial arts... were all her advantages. But when facing an enemy, Li Xian was a veteran fighter, with a sharp eye and keen observation, each move aimed directly at the vital points. He gave no opportunity, and no matter how powerful the martial arts techniques were... if they couldn't be施展, they were useless.

She fought several times, all ending in disastrous defeats. The first few times, she still shouted, "If I were to use my family's martial arts, I would surely defeat you." But after a few more fights, she couldn't get a chance to use them every time. Then she didn't dare to boast anymore, and she lost very grievously, as if she had a thousand pounds of force but her hands and feet were tied, and she could only headbutt the wall.

She knew her weaknesses and sought to make up for them. At the same time, she was secretly amazed by Li Xian. Martial arts combat is not about competing for family wealth. There are always talented individuals who can use ordinary moves to defeat their opponents in a plain and unadorned way.

The gap in realm can sometimes overwhelm everything. Sometimes, however, it is as light as a feather. It all depends on how it is used.

[Minor Five Elements Strange Escape]
[Proficiency: 39/100]

With Yan Hao's teaching and experience, his attainment in the Five Elements Strange Escape increased rapidly. As they interacted over time, Yan Hao grew very fond of Li Xian and was most willing to share his knowledge.

When Li Xian recently sought Yan Hao for advice, Yan Hao subtly revealed some information to him. The Flower Cage Sect recently... seemed to have a big move. It involved not only the Water Altar but also a "Soil Altar."

Li Xian couldn't know the specifics. But from his speculation, was it perhaps that they had set their sights on that female knight again and were planning to capture her? The Flower Cage Sect, left to its own devices, couldn't do anything proper anyway.

Let the floodwaters rage as they may.

Li Xian practiced quietly, honing his martial arts. Every time he saw a small progress in his martial arts, he felt happy and fulfilled.

After getting the "clam shell," Li Xian made the medicinal bath a priority. After practicing martial arts and spear every day, he would boil the medicinal soup and soak his body. To cherish the medicinal effects, he pulled Nan Gong Liu Li to enjoy it together.

The small courtyard was full of spring atmosphere.

Li Xian's strength was already very great. The transformation of his bones in the second martial arts realm was even more beneficial to him. His physical strength was already formidable, and naturally, his strengths became even stronger.

Another seven days passed in a flash.

[Wraith-Devouring Spear]
[Proficiency: 8169/15000 (Great Accomplishment)]
[Description: You have comprehended the Wraith Diagram, your spear path has advanced, your spear thrusts are like ghosts, and you hunt your enemies within a zhang's range.]

Li Xian had gained a deeper understanding of the essence of the Wraith-Devouring Spear. He comprehended two more moves: "Red Wraith Frightening the Soul" and "Dancing Ghost Playing with Shadows." These two moves were derived from the "Ghost Phases" in the Wraith Diagram, and they could be said to point directly to the core meaning of the Wraith-Devouring Spear, or even the essence of the魑魅魍魉图 (Diagram of Fiends, Ghosts, and Spirits).

If Chu Liuqing were to see these two moves and see who "Candle Order" was bestowed upon, he would surely reconsider. Li Xian, with no distractions, fully displayed his spear techniques.

He glanced towards the inner courtyard.

Nan Gong Liu Li had already gone to sleep. Li Xian suddenly thought: "In the past few days, I have been very close to Sister Liu Li. She has intentionally or unintentionally told me many family secrets. She even taught me the basic usage of the Pure Yang Qi Robe. She taught me the techniques of 'Shaking the Robe' and 'Entangling the Robe'."

"I am already quite proficient in using the Pure Yang Qi Robe, but... the Divine and Ghostly Fierce Robe is hidden very deeply. I wonder... what would it be like to wear the Divine and Ghostly Fierce Robe and use the Wraith-Devouring Spear?"

He was eager to try, and immediately took up his spear stance again. The spear stance was very slow and steady, calm and unhurried, with no hint of a ghostly appearance. But as the spear shaft moved, within the simple thrusts, stabs, collapses, and劈 moves, a hard-to-describe meaning gradually emerged.

A red light like blood appeared between Li Xian's eyebrows. The pale moonlight shone down, his face was fair and flawless. As he casually danced with the spear, an increasingly terrifying aura was revealed.

At this time, the Divine and Ghostly Fierce Robe was still far from being fully worn.

Wails of ghosts could already be heard by his ears. The wind around him swirled chaotically. The lamplight flickered, and with each flicker, it was as if a ghost shadow was passing by. The children in the neighborhood cried incessantly.

This aura was already far beyond his estimation.

Li Xian quickly stopped. The children's cries gradually faded. The neighbors, with lingering fear, all felt as if they had seen ghosts and gods. They kept their lights on all night and refused to sleep again.

"The Divine and Ghostly Fierce Robe... Strange, strange. There is no record of this fierce robe. I indirectly asked Sister Liu Li. She knew nothing about it either. I wonder... if it were Madam, with her knowledge, could she know about the fierce robe?"

"But even if she doesn't know, the power of this fierce robe is truly terrifying."

Li Xian put away his spear and stopped practicing, resting peacefully.

The next day.

The sky had just cleared.

Li Xian suddenly got up, his brow furrowed. He saw someone pacing outside his house. If it were a thief, he wouldn't be afraid.

But judging from the figure, it was a woman.
