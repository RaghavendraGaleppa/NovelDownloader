# Chapter 42: Mutant Spirit Beast  

Wang Chan desired both the **[Water-Fire Escape Art]** and the **[Thunder Sealing Sigil]**.  

The former was an escape technique—traversing through water and fire with ease. Once executed, it would be both dazzling and incredibly practical. Though he could already run quite fast, running was still just running—nothing compared to the art of escape.  

As for the latter, it was a sealing sigil, particularly effective against his own sinister spiritual energy due to its thunder attribute. With his panel system, he could use it immediately upon recording it, without worrying about comprehension.  

Though his physical body and skeletal magic concealed his sinister energy, which was hidden within his true bones, preventing others from discerning his demonic roots, this was still orthodox territory. What if someone powerful saw through his concealment? The odds were slim, but caution was necessary.  

If he layered the **[Thunder Sealing Sigil]** over the mysteries of the **"Skeletal Devouring Great Strength Art,"** even deliberate scrutiny would reveal nothing. Moreover, the sigil could be maintained long-term, and its sealing power could be replenished as it weakened. Once applied, whether day or night, he could practice without fear of detection.  

"Brother Wang, you’re asking for too much," Qu Lian said after a pause, shaking her head firmly with a wry smile. "Such spells are typically reserved for inner disciples who’ve rendered great service to their sects… Choose one, and I’ll compensate you with three **[Yin Ginseng Pills]** bearing twenty pill patterns."  

The **[Yin Ginseng Pill]** was another yin-attributed pill that boosted spiritual energy. Three pills with twenty patterns were no small offering.  

Qu Lian was usually generous and open to negotiation—she had even handed over the White Mountain Token without hesitation. But this time, she was unyielding, signaling no room for compromise.  

"Then the third option it is," Wang Chan conceded.  

As for the **[Water-Fire Escape Art]**, he’d have to find another way to obtain it later.  

Moreover, if Qu Lian could produce such a powerful mid-grade spell, could she also possess high-grade or even supreme-grade spells?  

The thought ignited a fervor in Wang Chan, though his expression remained as placid as still water.  

"Agreed," Qu Lian said without hesitation, refilling their tea before continuing, "But the reward will only be given after the Corpse Ghost Worm is completely dealt with."  

Neither Wang Chan nor Ning Jingming objected.  

With the agreement settled, Qu Lian laid out her plan.  

Given the Corpse Ghost Worm’s extreme yin and sinister nature, it was incredibly tenacious. Even with Qu Lian’s power to suppress it, eradicating it in one attempt was impossible—it would only provoke the worm to self-destruct in desperation.  

After discussing with the two, Qu Lian decided on three refining sessions, one per year.  

Like boiling a frog in warm water, they would gradually wear the worm down.  

Wang Chan and Ning Jingming exchanged glances—this timeline coincidentally aligned with their stay in the city. They doubted it was mere coincidence, but it was understandable. They’d do the same in her position—keeping leverage until the worm was dealt with.  

Qu Lian had already been thorough in her arrangements. After reviewing the plan several times and confirming its stability, Wang Chan and Ning Jingming gave their full approval.  

However, despite the meticulous planning, the process remained perilous.  

Once the sealing and refining began, there could be no interruptions or mistakes.  

During this period, Qu Lian would withdraw her suppression of the worm. If the worm seized the opportunity to self-destruct or unleash other sinister techniques, the consequences would be disastrous.  

But Qu Lian assured them that, barring unforeseen circumstances, she had enough power to suppress the worm. As long as Wang Chan and Ning Jingming acted promptly, no mishaps would occur.  

The two men exchanged another glance—they’d have to see what power Qu Lian truly wielded to suppress the worm.  

Without delay, Qu Lian began preparations.  

There was no time like the present—she intended to conduct the first sealing and refining that very day.  

The three returned to the courtyard.  

Qu Lian stepped outside, hung a "Closed for Cultivation" jade plaque on the gate, and shut it tightly.  

Then, she produced a mid-grade water-attribute defensive formation and meticulously set it up, with Wang Chan and Ning Jingming assisting where needed.  

Running his fingers over the high-quality formation flags and disks and gazing up at the sky-like barrier, Wang Chan’s envy burned fiercely. If only he could rob Qu Lian…  

He quickly suppressed the thought with a deep breath.  

Qu Lian might appear gentle, generous, and approachable, but she was unfathomably deep. In a real fight, he might not be her match yet.  

Once the formation was ready, Qu Lian solemnly summoned Miao Konghe from the backyard and gave the crane detailed instructions using a unique method.  

The crane flapped its wings excitedly, radiating a "willing to shed blood for my sister" fervor.  

Ning Jingming wasn’t idle either. With a flick of his sleeve, he released a low-grade Three-Tailed Black Cat.  

The cat resembled its owner in demeanor, with pitch-black pupils and no whites—utterly dark. If not for daylight, it would’ve been invisible at night.  

The cat seemed playful, darting toward Miao Konghe with meows. Soon, the cat and crane became a blur of black and white, darting and tumbling around the courtyard.  

"Brother Ning, you’ve raised a Black Pupil Spirit Cat," Qu Lian remarked admiringly. "Though of low-grade bloodline, ordinary ones don’t have three tails. Is it a mutant spirit beast?"  

"You flatter me," Ning Jingming replied modestly.  

"A mutant spirit beast implies awakened abilities," Qu Lian added.  

A mutated spirit beast was akin to a cultivator suddenly gaining a spiritual or magical physique.  

"Given the stakes, I had no choice but to bring it out for vigilance," Ning Jingming said calmly, snapping his fingers.  

The three-tailed cat instantly appeared on his shoulder, its speed astonishing. After a few strokes and silent communication, it leaped onto a tree in the courtyard, crouching motionless to watch the surroundings, ignoring Miao Konghe’s attempts to engage.  

Qu Lian sighed and recalled the crane, whispering instructions. The crane obediently flew into the barrier, merging into it and vanishing—its ability a mystery.  

With their preparations complete, the two turned expectantly to Wang Chan.  

They half-expected him to produce a mighty spirit beast, but all he took out was a low-grade **[Mysterious Mechanism Talisman]** worth three spirit coins.  

Their disappointment was palpable. Given Wang Chan’s earlier demeanor, they couldn’t tell if he was genuinely lacking resources or simply holding back.
