# Chapter 168: Arrow Flight

Two hundred miles was an extremely short distance for a Golden Core mid-stage cultivator. With the use of secret techniques, they could cover it in just a dozen breaths.

Li Shiming, sitting in the flying boat, saw the Northern Shu Golden Core mid-stage cultivator approaching like a streak of rainbow light.

He also saw the massive illusory figure that Elder Song had transformed into moments before his demise. Although Elder Song had wronged him, death settled all grudges. Watching Elder Song dissipate into nothingness, Li Shiming felt a sense of relief.

As for the pursuing Golden Core mid-stage cultivator, Li Shiming merely smiled faintly.

He had absolute confidence in the rocket he had created. If it were a rocket from his previous life, it might have been possible for a Golden Core cultivator to catch up during its initial launch phase.

But this rocket was different. It minimized air resistance and wasn't constrained by material temperature limits. It only needed to maximize the combustion efficiency of liquid hydrogen to achieve the theoretical maximum thrust that was only possible in his previous world.

Initially, the rocket's speed wasn't particularly fast, but within a few breaths, under the powerful thrust, it accelerated rapidly.

Even during its ascent phase, the rocket's speed surpassed that of the Golden Core mid-stage cultivator.

When the rocket reached an altitude of 10,000 meters and transitioned to level flight, its speed had already reached Mach 7.

The Golden Core mid-stage cultivator stood a hundred miles away from Eagle Beak Island, staring dumbfounded at the speck of light in the sky that was moving away at an unimaginable speed.

There was no question of pursuit—now he didn't even have the courage to try.

If someone had told him that he had just been chasing a Nascent Soul ancestor, he would have believed it.

Because that speed was something even Patriarch Cang couldn't achieve. He couldn't imagine any cultivator below the Nascent Soul level reaching such velocity.

Not just the Golden Core mid-stage cultivator—even Patriarch Cang frowned as he watched the rapidly disappearing rocket. Though he didn't sense any powerful aura, the speed still unsettled him.

Moreover, the rocket's altitude was dangerously close to the Thirty-Three Heavens. For cultivators without sufficient strength, approaching the Thirty-Three Heavens was tantamount to suicide.

This made Patriarch Cang's face darken with concern. The Tianhai Sect clearly harbored secrets, and he could only hope they wouldn't cause too much trouble in the future.

Li Shiming had no idea what the Northern Shu Mingxin Sect cultivators were thinking. His entire focus was on the instrument panel.

The panel displayed speed, altitude, fuel levels, and monitoring data from various parts of the rocket. The current speed had reached a point that even made him slightly nervous.

Originally, based on the rocket design from his previous life, the maximum speed of this rocket engine should have been only Mach 7.

But now, thanks to the fusion of technologies from both worlds, the rocket's actual speed had reached Mach 10.

At this speed, the spiritual energy consumption of the air-partitioning array on the flying boat was enormous. If not for the flying boat's ability to reduce air resistance, the friction alone at this speed would have generated unbearable heat.

Carefully, Li Shiming extended his spiritual sense outside the rocket. It served as his eyes, allowing him to observe the terrain below.

He saw the Seven Star Islands, tiny as ants. In just over twenty minutes, he had traveled from the sect to the Seven Star Islands—a journey that would normally take several hours even with the fastest flying artifacts.

The rocket flew over the ocean, and soon there were no more reference points on the sea's surface. It seemed as though only water existed between heaven and earth.

Li Shiming had already set his course and wasn't worried about navigation errors.

The only problem was the highly inaccurate maps of this world. Although he had a map of the North Sea, it lacked precise distance measurements.

He wasn't sure if the rocket had enough fuel to cross the North Sea, but as long as he could pass the most dangerous central region, he would be relatively safe even if he landed far from the Northern Shu coastline.

After more than five hours of flight, just as he thought this altitude would be trouble-free, he sensed a terrifying presence.

A massive shadow emerged from the sea ahead. The shadow was covered in black fur and had a humanoid structure, but Li Shiming was certain it wasn't human. Its aura carried the unique savagery of a sea beast.

Li Shiming had never heard of Nascent Soul manifestations, otherwise he would have immediately recognized the shadow for what it was.

He was unlucky. If his speed hadn't been so fast, flying at 10,000 meters wouldn't have attracted the attention of a Nascent Soul-level sea beast.

But the rocket's speed and noise were too conspicuous, making the Nascent Soul sea beast perceive it as a threat.

Powerful sea beasts were territorial. Another powerful entity passing through their domain was seen as an invasion—a direct challenge.

Thus, the Nascent Soul sea beast responded. Its manifestation took the form of a towering giant.

The giant swung a massive hand at the rocket. No matter how fast the rocket was, it couldn't evade an attack from a Nascent Soul entity.

Fortunately, the sea beast treated the rocket as an equal and didn't use soul attacks meant for weaker foes. Otherwise, a single mental strike would have destroyed the rocket without needing physical force.

Li Shiming's scalp tingled. The moment he sensed the terrifying aura, his body was completely immobilized by the sheer difference in cultivation.

The only thing he could move was his spiritual sense. Knowing this was a life-or-death moment, he immediately activated an array on the flying boat.

The array emitted a light that enveloped the rocket, causing the connected materials to lose their weight.

With the rocket now weightless but its thrust unchanged, its speed increased dramatically.

This slight speed boost allowed the giant hand to sweep just behind the rocket, missing it entirely.

At the rocket's speed, once the Nascent Soul sea beast realized it had missed, any further attack would require its true body to give chase. The manifestation's range was no longer sufficient.

Li Shiming counted down silently: "3, 2, 1." At "1," he deactivated the weightlessness array.

However, the rocket's speed, now increased, would take some distance to decelerate even after regaining weight. This distance was enough to escape the sea beast's attack range.

The Nascent Soul sea beast didn't pursue. Clearly, the "enemy" had no intention of staying in its territory. Moreover, the rocket was heading toward human lands—a place the sea beast had no desire to approach.

Land was forbidden territory for sea beasts. Even a Nascent Soul sea beast avoided it.

In this world, humans were the dominant species. Other intelligent lifeforms, no matter how powerful, were merely isolated individuals.

Li Shiming checked the instrument panel. Seeing that all data was normal, he relaxed slightly.

The rocket's body was made of ordinary metal, enhanced with inscriptions. Though the fortification runes couldn't turn ordinary metal into a spiritual material, they improved its resistance and hardness.

The weightlessness array required spiritual materials to function. Through testing, Li Shiming knew the ordinary metal could only endure the array's effects for three seconds before disintegrating.

He had considered using spiritual materials, like the lowest-grade metals used in low-tier artifacts, to construct the rocket's body.

But the amount of metal required was staggering. Even if he had enough spirit stones to purchase it, finding a seller with such quantities was impossible.

Most spiritual mines were controlled by the seven major sects, and annual production was limited.

Though he had some privileges in the Tianhai Sect, they were largely due to his relationship with Yin Shilan. Acquiring large amounts of critical spiritual metals was beyond his means.

With lingering fear, Li Shiming glanced back and marked the location with his IBMz15. Once he was strong enough, he would return to settle the score with this Nascent Soul sea beast.

Of course, he didn't yet know the beast's true strength. If he had, his thoughts of vengeance might have been different.

The flying boat continued its high-altitude journey. The fuel gauge was nearly empty, yet no land was in sight.

Li Shiming sighed. His understanding of this world's geography had been flawed.

Though this planet seemed similar to Earth, its surface area was clearly much larger—a conclusion drawn by the IBMz15 based on high-altitude observations.

Using Earth's dimensions to estimate the North Sea's width had led to the rocket running out of fuel over open water.

As the last of the liquid hydrogen was exhausted, the rocket's engine shut down, and it began to descend.

Li Shiming stored the rocket in his largest storage ring. With more fuel, it could be reused—at least until he built a better one.

He took out a jade flying boat—a second gift from the Holy Ice Sect's cultivators, the first having been traded to Ren Fei'er.

He chose the jade boat for its stealth. Its transparency provided a degree of invisibility at long range over the ocean.

Li Shiming maintained his course. Though his map was now useless for navigation, as long as his direction was correct, he would eventually reach land.

His ignorance was a blessing. Had he known the true dangers of the North Sea, he might never have dared to cross it alone as a Qi Refining cultivator.

Over the next few days, he witnessed the North Sea's perils firsthand. Every few hours, he was attacked by sea beasts.

Luckily, none were at the Foundation Establishment level, so aside from slowing him down, they posed no real threat.

Seven days later, he finally spotted land on the horizon.

His tension eased. Seven days without any landmarks—not even an island—had made him question whether he was heading deeper into the ocean.

Without the IBMz15 confirming his direction, he might have lost hope.

As a cultivator, he didn't need food, but the endless, unchanging seascape was a severe psychological test.

Li Shiming submerged the jade boat, using the ocean's surface for stealth.

Near the coast, powerful sea beasts were unlikely to appear.

If his calculations were correct, this was the Northern Shu continent.

His reasons for coming here weren't just Yin Shilan. He sought greater strength.

After witnessing the Seven Star Islands' siege by Northern Shu's Golden Core sword cultivator Yun Xingyi—who single-handedly breached their grand formation and sent seven sects into panic—Li Shiming had questioned the seven sects' power.

Yun Xingyi, a Golden Core cultivator, was incomparably strong. Discussions with the Seven Star Islands' Golden Core participants confirmed the vast gap between the seven sects and Northern Shu.

And Yun Xingyi was an outcast from Northern Shu—a "homeless dog." Yet even he was deemed invincible by the seven sects' Golden Cores.

Moreover, among the Tianhai Sect's vast collection, Li Shiming hadn't found any techniques comparable to the two he'd obtained from Yun Xingyi.

This realization made it clear that staying with the seven sects offered no future. At best, he might reach Elder Yin's level—limited by the Tianhai Island's resources and the sects' shallow foundations, which couldn't produce Nascent Soul cultivators and rarely even late-stage Golden Cores.

To his surprise, Li Shiming reached the shore without incident. Northern Shu had no coastal defenses, as if sea beasts were no concern.

What confidence was needed to be so unguarded?

In Tianhai Island, the seven sects had painstakingly established two defensive lines.

The Seven Star Islands were the first, blocking Golden Core sea beasts.

Then came the sect-specific coastal defenses, handling Foundation Establishment beasts and swarms, leaving Qi Refining beasts for junior disciples to practice on.

This layered defense kept Tianhai Island safe and provided the sects with low-level resources.

The flying boat emerged from the water onto a sandy beach.

Li Shiming stepped out, his feet touching solid ground. The world felt real again.

Days at sea had made him yearn for land.

He stored the jade boat and changed into a set of low-grade robes, even stashing his storage bracelet in his machine space.

He needed to look like a poor, wandering Qi Refining cultivator—a rogue with nothing to his name.
