# Chapter 41: How Many Merits for Killing This Gu Master?

A powerful Gu master from the Southern Wastelands had wreaked havoc in the Great Zhou Dynasty, poisoning the Crown Prince before ultimately fleeing beyond the capital's borders. 

Now, experts from all sides were hunting this Gu master, but finding someone deliberately hiding in the vast territory of Great Zhou was like searching for a needle in a haystack. Currently, only preliminary traces had been confirmed—he was likely hiding in the regions of Xuanling Prefecture, Jingye Prefecture, or Tianyuan Prefecture.

Among these, Xuanling Prefecture, though not under the jurisdiction of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, was the closest to it. The sect had now received a request from the Great Zhou imperial court to dispatch elders and disciples to assist in capturing the Gu King, Xin Xuan!

"Just as the fake medicine peddler predicted, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect is mobilizing forces from the mountain sect to join the hunt," Li Zhengjing mused, his brows furrowing slightly. "Each peak of the sect has received orders to send one elder and thirty inner disciples to participate in the operation?"

Additionally, the true disciples residing on the main peak would also descend the mountain to hunt down this scourge. 

This meant the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect would be dispatching nearly two hundred members from its mountain sect. Combined with Elder Gu's group, who had already gone to the capital, the scale of the operation was immense.

Beyond the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, the Great Zhou imperial court would undoubtedly send forces to Xuanling Prefecture, and even other major cultivation sects would likely join the hunt. 

A single individual had stirred up such a storm across the entire Great Zhou. In Xuanling Prefecture alone, the number of pursuers would likely exceed a thousand.

"To cause such an uproar with just one person's strength?" Li Zhengjing frowned, a thought crossing his mind. "Could there be a 'Human Immortal'-level expert lurking in the shadows?"

Given that the Crown Prince was the heir apparent to the throne, it wasn't unusual for factions to mobilize over this matter. Yet, Li Zhengjing couldn't shake the feeling that there was something deeper at play.

He exhaled slowly. 

Just moments ago, Inner Sect Elder Gao Changhe had visited. The elder representing Ancient Moon Peak for this mission was Elder Chen Xuan from the Enforcement Hall. Among the thirty inner disciples selected, there were familiar faces—Chen Yang was also on the list. 

And at the very end of the list was Li Zhengjing's name.

"Master, could this be the Chen family's doing?" The wall-clinging bird glanced at the list and said, "Logically, you've only just reached the Inner Breath realm less than a month ago. You shouldn't be involved in something this dangerous."

"This list originally didn't have my name," Li Zhengjing replied. "But Elder Gao said it was added later—and it had nothing to do with the Chen family."

"Nothing to do with the Chen family?" The bird was puzzled. "Then why was your name added?"

"You were out drinking when Elder Gao came," Li Zhengjing said, rubbing his temples. "He said the current leader of Ancient Moon Peak added my name on a whim."

He had a rough idea. Due to the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, the Ancient Moon Peak Master must have been keeping an eye on him for some time. His recent feat of slaying the black-robed evil cultivator in Wanlin County had also demonstrated his rapid progress in the Inner Breath realm.

Was this some kind of test?

With this thought, he focused inwardly and glanced at the golden page in his mind, wondering what fate awaited him if he descended the mountain to hunt down this enemy.

As the thought arose, his fortune remained unchanged—meaning this expedition posed no threat to his life.

"Fine. Since that's the case, I'll go down the mountain with them."

Li Zhengjing looked at his left arm and mused, "With the golden page, I'm immune to Gu poison—in fact, I can benefit from it. As for other dangers, the Raging Flame Divine Sword is enough to ensure my safety."

His gaze then shifted to the wall-clinging bird.

After its transformation by the Ghost Valley Spirit Official, this white luan divine bird was far more formidable than before, roughly equivalent to a peak Inner Breath expert. 

More importantly, the white luan was considered an auspicious creature, possessing an innate ability to sense impending danger. It could also fly high above, surveying the land below. As a divine avian, it was naturally resistant to Gu insects.

"Wall-Climber..." Li Zhengjing stroked the green horn on its head and said slowly, "The Gu insect at home still has its uses for me. But I've noticed how much you've been eyeing it, and I feel bad. How about coming down the mountain with me? We'll find that Gu master and let you feast to your heart's content?"

Tears welled up in the bird's eyes as it choked out, "Master... you truly care for me..."

"Of course," Li Zhengjing said gently. "We're both lawbreakers in the sect—birds of a feather, you might say. After all we've been through, we're partners in crime."

The bird was deeply moved and wiped its tears with a wing. "You're right, Master. Unlike that stupid tree—it hasn't even broken any rules and can't join our gang. Why don't we leave it behind this time?"

Li Zhengjing shook his head. "That won't do. What if it runs off and reports us to the sect? After all, it hasn't done anything wrong—it's not one of us."

The bird thought for a moment and nodded. "Wise as always, Master. I'll go pack some books. Even on the road, I must continue my studies."

"Exactly," Li Zhengjing agreed. "To study without thinking is futile; to think without studying is perilous. One must never slack in the pursuit of knowledge."

Muttering to itself, the bird felt a pang of inadequacy. "Master's wisdom is unfathomable—he might even surpass me now... I'd better bring ten books this time."

Once the bird left, Li Zhengjing turned to the Five Elements Creation Tree to prepare for their descent.

He had already considered this earlier—the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi within him was too sharp. Overuse could damage his internal organs. 

With the Five Elements Creation Tree by his side, he wouldn't have to worry about running out of Five Elements Creation Paste. He could brew and refine it whenever needed.

The tree grew excited at the mention of descending the mountain. 

"Master, can we leave that dumb bird behind?"

"How could we?" Li Zhengjing said in a hushed tone. "Leaving an outsider alone at home would be inconvenient. What if it steals our treasures and flees?"

"You're absolutely right!" The tree suddenly understood. "We'll bring it along so it doesn't rob us! That Gu insect, for example—if I hadn't been home this morning when you left, the bird would've eaten it..."

"Precisely why it can't stay. Help me pack up the house," Li Zhengjing said. "I need to go collect some supplies..."

"Right away!" The tree extended two roots from its pot, using them as legs to lift the entire vessel as it scurried into the house to pack.

"Pack an extra robe for me. The seasons are changing—it's getting colder."

"Understood."

"Good lad."

Li Zhengjing chuckled and headed straight for the Affairs Hall to collect his supplies.

Every inner disciple on the list would receive rewards from the sect for this mission.

"One bottle of Antidote Pills and one bottle of Barrier-Breaking Pills—courtesy of the Alchemy Pavilion."

"One Radiant Light Talisman and one Clear Mind Talisman—from the Talisman Pavilion."

"One Heart-Protecting Mirror and one Insect-Capturing Artifact—crafted by the Artifact Refining Pavilion."

The elder at the Affairs Hall explained, "These items are rewards from the sect, meant to give you more means of survival during the mission. Consider them payment for your service—you won't need to return them afterward."

Li Zhengjing nodded. "What if we distinguish ourselves with merit?"

The elder smiled. "Those who perform outstanding deeds will receive additional rewards. If you discover traces of this Gu master and report them to the elders, leading to his capture, you'll be awarded six hundred merits."

Li Zhengjing couldn't help but marvel—just discovering the target's whereabouts was worth six hundred merits. That bastard was truly valuable!

With that in mind, he asked, "And if I kill this Gu master myself, how many merits would that be?"
