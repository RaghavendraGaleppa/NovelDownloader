# Chapter 6: Who Will Settle the Matter?

**Author: Yue Guan**

Yang Can’s expression was grave as he said to Bao Zitou, "If Commander Cheng hadn't pointed it out, I would still be in the dark."

"If things are as you say, Commander Cheng, then even if the Yu and Suo families are now related by marriage, we should still be on guard against the Suo family."

Bao Zitou hurriedly said, "Of course! Our Yu family is a great clan; how can we be compared to those small households? What does marriage change? Even the Emperor must guard against his own royal relatives! What's wrong with our Yu family being wary of the Suo family?"

Yang Can nodded. "Commander Cheng, after our young master was assassinated last night, it was the Suo family who stepped in to arrange the aftermath. The messengers sent to notify the Suo and Yu families were all dispatched by Nurse Tu, weren't they?"

Bao Zitou said resentfully, "That's right! Even delivering a message requires the Suo family to step in! What? Have all the men of the Yu family died out, leaving only the Suo family to show off?"

Yang Can sighed. "Commander Cheng, do you think... with such a major incident happening in the Yu family, is it appropriate to let a member of the Suo family go back to report the news?"

Although Bao Zitou had a rough appearance, he was far from stupid. Hearing Yang Can's words, he immediately sensed something was wrong. "Master Yang, is there... a problem with this?"

Yang Can said solemnly, "Commander Cheng, you should immediately send someone to take a shortcut back and report the death to the Clan Leader before the Suo family arrives. If the Suo family gets there first, they can say whatever they want in front of the Clan Leader. Who is right, who is wrong, who is right and who is wrong... Commander Cheng, you won't be able to explain yourself clearly."

"That's right!"

Bao Zitou jumped up with a start, the rice bowl in his hand crashing into the grass. "Damn that Suo family! So they were already plotting to set me up! Master Yang... no, Master Yang, I'll send someone back to report right away!"

Seeing that Bao Zitou was about to leave, Yang Can quickly stood up and instructed again, "Commander Cheng, when you send someone back, don't forget to urge the Clan Leader to send someone with enough authority to take charge of the situation. Also, from now on, you must send someone to keep an eye on the Suo family. If anyone from the Suo family leaves without saying goodbye, they are likely going to do something detrimental to you..."

Bao Zitou felt a chill run down his spine, his fists cracking as he clenched them. "Alright! I'll have the brothers keep a close watch on those bastards from the Suo family! If it really comes to the critical moment..."

Bao Zitou's heart hardened. At that time, to hell with offending people; he would just kill them first!

Bao Zitou turned around and walked away in a hurry. After taking a few steps, he suddenly turned back, cupped his fist heavily towards Yang Can, and said with a face full of gratitude, "I won't say anything more, Master Yang. I'll go through fire and water for you!"

Bao Zitou's words came from the bottom of his heart. Since the young master was assassinated last night, he had noticed a subtle change in many people's attitudes towards him. Yang Can was a scholar; the young master's death could never be blamed on him. In this situation, Yang Can could have stood by and watched, yet he still took the trouble to advise him. How could Bao Zitou not remember this kindness?

Yang Can slowly finished his flatbread and porridge, washed his utensils by the stream, and then went to see Yu Chengye's coffin.

Overnight, the coffin had been made. It was pieced together temporarily from disassembled carriage boards. Since the boards were of different lengths, it was put together crookedly. However, the person lying inside this extremely shabby coffin was the heir apparent of the Tianshui Yu Clan, a person of immeasurably noble status.

The coffin was placed on another carriage, with an incense burner on the shaft. Yang Can lit three sticks of incense and silently bowed three times to the coffin:

*Young Master Yu, I saved your life in the past, and you gave me the identity of a staff member. Strictly speaking, you still owe me more. I was also forced into a corner last night and had to submit to the villain to save my own life. Cough! If you know anything from the underworld, don't blame the wrong person.*

*This stick of incense, I sincerely offer to send you to the afterlife. From now on, I will walk my own bright path, and you will go to your own hell. Let bygones be bygones, let bygones be bygones...*

Yang Can offered a silent prayer and inserted the incense.

At this time, Bao Zitou had already rushed back. After he offered his incense, he approached Yang Can and whispered, "Master Yang, as you instructed, I've already sent someone back to report. I've also sent men to keep an eye on the Suo family! Rest assured, I've blocked all the paths and ditches, not even a rat will be able to slip through!"

Yang Can felt a bit relieved. As long as Bao Zitou kept an eye on the Suo family and prevented them from sending out any information, his secret would be within his control. He needed to use this time to deal with Nurse Tu as quickly as possible.

However... he didn't know if Nurse Tu was the only person in charge of the Suo family's dowry escort. If he made a move, there would be no chance to make amends, so he had to clarify all possible loopholes.

Thinking of this, Yang Can looked at Bao Zitou again and asked with concern, "Old Cheng, is the captured horse bandit we caught yesterday still being guarded by the Suo family?"

"That's right!"

Hearing Yang Can bring this up, Bao Zitou exploded again. "Wasn't he taken away by Nurse Tu? Damn it! Those bastards from the Suo family, even one of their old nannies dares to order us around. What the hell is this!"

Yesterday evening, they were setting up camp, the time when the entire convoy's defenses were at their most lax. Suddenly, a group of horse bandits swept in. Although there were only about a hundred attackers, they were fierce and skilled fighters. They swept into the camp like a gust of wind, not only killing Yu Chengye on the spot but also carrying off a batch of goods. Under the fierce counterattack of the Suo and Yu family guards, the bandits left behind seventeen or eighteen people during their retreat, with only one alive. However, this person was also seriously injured at the time and couldn't be interrogated, and was later forcibly taken over by Nurse Tu.

Yang Can shook his head. "It doesn't matter who is guarding him. What matters is that our young master was killed by these horse bandits. If we don't even get to the bottom of these bandits' background... Old Cheng, even if you have a valid excuse for the young master's death, how will you explain this to the Clan Leader?"

Bao Zitou was stunned and stammered, "But this... isn't that because of the Suo family..."

Actually, Bao Zitou wasn't afraid of the Suo family; he didn't eat from their rice bowl. However, the Yu family currently needed the Suo family's help and was very accommodating to them. Since he ate from the Yu family's rice bowl, he naturally didn't dare to fall out too badly with the Suo family.

Yang Can said earnestly, "Old Cheng, not to mention that you failed to protect the young master and don't know the background of those horse bandits, so how will you explain yourself to the Clan Leader later. Just based on the fact that you are swallowing your anger now, if the Suo family sees you looking like you know you're in the wrong, won't they be even more emboldened to push the blame onto you?"

Bao Zitou's gaze immediately sharpened. He lowered his head and thought for a moment, and the beard as stiff as steel needles slowly bristled. Bao Zitou waved his big hand and shouted sternly, "Brothers, come with me to the Suo family to demand the person! Damn it! If the Suo family doesn't hand over that horse bandit today, you beat them to death for me!"

The men of the Yu family had long been dissatisfied with the Suo family. Now that they saw their leader standing up for them, they weren't afraid of anything anymore and immediately clamored and followed him.

Yang Can deliberately slowed his pace and trailed far behind them. He wanted to see, after Bao Zitou made such a scene, who from the Suo family would come out to settle the matter.
