# Chapter 379: Talented Material

Bi Yuan was visibly shaken. Xu Yunfan did not waste any time, but instead asked with curiosity about the matter of the Pure Yang Ancestor.

"Because he killed someone he shouldn't have."

"The Outer Realm Demons?"

"...Yes." Bi Yuan's tone was heavy. "This is also why I have exhausted all my resources to push you to the Land Immortal Realm."

He was just about to say more when—

A sound like tearing silk suddenly boomed across the horizon.

The master and disciple looked up simultaneously. The originally azure sky was now stained as if soaked in blood. Amidst the churning crimson clouds, a pitch-black fissure spanning a thousand miles appeared out of thin air.

Deep within the fissure, countless twisted shadows writhed, as if some colossal creature was trying to force its way into this world.

Even more terrifying was that countless blood-red threads were descending from the clouds.

"Blood threads entangling bone, the heavens weep as demons descend..."

Bi Yuan's teacup shattered in his hand, his face turning deathly pale. "The Outer Realm Demons have descended. I am not prepared, and the Dao Sect is not prepared. There were supposed to be several more years..."

Looking at the flustered Bi Yuan, Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes and patted his master's shoulder. "Master, I am already in the Land Immortal Realm."

Upon hearing this, Bi Yuan's expression immediately calmed down. He looked at Xu Yunfan with a complex expression.

"Yunfan, I only wish to protect the Dao Sect."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly. "Leave everything to me."

"Ants of the Divine Martial World..."

With a crisp sound of space tearing, more than thirty Outer Realm Demons descended lightly along the blood threads. The "Boundary Talisman Jade" hanging at their waists glowed with a faint blue light, indicating they had just undergone the turbulence of a cross-realm transmission.

The leader brushed off the residual marks on his robe and frowned as he looked at the violently trembling bronze compass in his hand. The needle spun erratically like a headless fly before finally trembling as it pointed toward a few faint light spots in the southeast.

"Strange, the *Dragon Breeding Record* clearly states that this world has at least thirty-six 'nourished ingredients' ready for harvest!"

A round-faced female disciple exclaimed in shock. The spiritual detection plate in her hand showed scattered red lights representing high-level martial artists. "Now, there isn't even one-tenth left?"

A crisp sound of something falling came from the back of the group.

Everyone turned to look, only to see a tall, thin disciple with a face as pale as paper. His trembling finger pointed toward the collapsed main peak of the Sword Pavilion in the distance.

The majestic mountain, which should have been soaring with sword intent and piercing the clouds, was now like tofu crushed by a divine giant's hammer, leaving only fragmented ruins.

A few faint wisps of sword intent, like dying struggling threads, drifted and swayed amidst the ruins. This bit of martial sword intent was simply insignificant.

"This... this place..."

The tall, thin disciple's Adam's apple bobbed violently, his voice dry like sandpaper rubbing. "The *World Map Record* clearly states that this should be a sword dao holy land with 'a thousand peaks competing in beauty and ten thousand swords vying for sound'—a martial sword cultivator specifically enlightened by the Divine Martial True Lord..."

He frantically pulled out a yellowed ancient book from his chest, his trembling fingers flipping to the marked page. "Master's notes can't be wrong... how did it become like this? Could it be... has the Dragon Breeding Technique really gone wrong?"

"Bullshit!"

The scar-faced leader roared and kicked the millstone-sized boulder beside him into dust.

As the stone fragments flew, blue veins bulged on his forehead. "The Dragon Breeding Technique personally planted by the Hundred Flowers True Lord three thousand years ago can even distort the laws of the realms. How could it be wrong?"

He grabbed the thin disciple's collar, his ferocious face almost pressing against the other's. "If you dare spout nonsense again, I'll use you to feed the banner first!"

A crisp sound of something falling suddenly came from the back of the group.

Everyone turned to see a round-faced disciple slumped on the ground, the detection plate slipping from his fingers. His originally confident face was now twisted beyond recognition. "I... I borrowed three hundred contribution points from the Joyous Courtyard!"

He tore at his own hair, his voice carrying a sob. "If I can't gather enough 'blood food' this time, with the interest compounding..."

This sentence was like a basin of cold water poured over everyone's heads.

More than half of the disciples in the group changed expressions. Some had mortgaged their lifebound magical artifacts, some had signed "Flesh and Blood Contracts" with the Hundred Desires Peak, and some, like the round-faced disciple, had borrowed high-interest loans.

If this trip yielded nothing, a fate worse than death awaited them.

Being drained of their seven emotions and six desires to be refined into "human pills," or being sold as "talented material," with even their souls used for refinement—the best outcome would be being sent to the Outer Realm battlefield as cannon fodder...

The mountain wind howled, carrying the dust from the Sword Pavilion ruins past the thirty-plus disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect, who stood frozen like clay statues.

The mountain wind moaned, swirling with faint auras as it rose upward.

Just as the thirty-plus Primordial Origin Sect disciples stood frozen, a figure shrouded in赤 golden light suddenly appeared before them, as if stepping directly from the void, without even disturbing the air.

The mountain wind suddenly stilled. The thirty-plus Primordial Origin Sect disciples all turned to look at the abruptly appearing赤 golden figure.

After a moment of shock, a strange excitement actually appeared on everyone's faces. Instead of panicking, they looked like hunters who had discovered a rare prey.

The scar-faced leader narrowed his eyes, a purple-black aura flowing deep within his pupils.

He looked Xu Yunfan up and down, then suddenly grinned, revealing his white teeth. "What a fine Divine Martial Body!"

He licked his lips, his voice carrying unconcealed greed. "Bones and muscles like a dragon's marrow quenched in fire, soul like a red sun condensed into crystal... If brought back to the Hundred Desires Peak, it's worth at least a thousand contribution points!"

The round-faced disciple beside him hastily pulled out a bronze compass. The needle trembled violently as it pointed at Xu Yunfan, and the surface even displayed rare golden patterns. "Senior Brother, look! He has Xuanhuang Dragon Qi within him, and... and the phenomenon of ten martial dao origins intertwining!"

His voice became shrill with excitement. "What blood food is this? It's a living 'Divine Martial Dao Seed'! Perhaps the Divine Martial True Lord left something behind in the Divine Martial World!"

Hearing this, the scar-faced leader's facial muscles twitched with ecstasy.

He took a heavy step forward, and the Hundred Desires Banner at his waist stirred without wind. "Kid, you've got some nerve."

He stared at the ten extreme true energies flowing beneath Xu Yunfan's skin, his Adam's apple bobbing. "A mere martial artist, to have tempered his physique to such a degree... You have heart, you have heart..."

Xu Yunfan looked coldly at this group of Primordial Origin Sect disciples, who were competing like butchers in a marketplace to divide up his body.

"That eyeball on the forehead belongs to my Hundred Desires Peak. It might be refined into a magical artifact."

"The spine is tempered as hard as iron, it should be refined into medicine."

"The martial true energy on his body must be completely剜出 (dug out), it's worth at least eight hundred contribution points..."

"Interesting... As disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect, to be so lowly, I've misjudged you."

Hearing Xu Yunfan call out their background, the scar-faced disciple was somewhat surprised. "I didn't expect the natives of the Divine Martial World to know of my Primordial Origin Sect. It seems the前辈 (seniors) who came in last time must have fallen quite badly in the ditch."

Most of the Primordial Origin Sect disciples present showed a hint of mockery.

In the eyes of their Primordial Origin Demon Sect, if one could stumble within the realms, there was nothing to say other than lacking skill.

The corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth curled up slightly, the ten extreme true energies roaring within his body.

(Two chapters for today, will continue working hard tomorrow. Thank you all. I will present a very wonderful world later, with the Dao of Martial Arts as the protagonist's foundation.)
