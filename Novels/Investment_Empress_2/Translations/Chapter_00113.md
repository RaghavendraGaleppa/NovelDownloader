# Chapter 113: Refining Oneself in the Alchemical Furnace, The Path of the Ice Cube's Dual Divine Forms

“You’re going with Xiaobao?”

“That’s right.”

“Jump into the alchemical furnace?”

“Exactly.”

Looking at Li Mo’s serious expression, Elder Xue’s face gradually turned grave.

He turned his head.

“Xiaobao, go call your Second Senior Sister here. She specializes in treating issues related to the mind and soul.”

Old Xue was worried that Li Mo was suffering from excessive mental stress or had gone astray in his cultivation.

What kind of mental state would lead someone to think of jumping into an alchemical furnace to be refined along with the pills?

This skips the banquet entirely; isn’t this just cremation?

“Okay, sure.”

Tang Xiaobao wiped his face and turned to leave.

“Wait!”

Li Mo grabbed Tang Xiaobao by the back of his head and turned him back around.

“Elder Xue, I’m serious.”

“That makes it even worse!”

Xue Jing looked grave.

“We martial artists are prone to wild thoughts. Sometimes we don’t even realize we’ve gone down the wrong path.”

“For example, when I was young, I always wanted to take shortcuts.”

“Back then, I failed to condense my Xuan Dan several times, so I thought, why not just refine a ‘Xuan Dan’ for myself and stuff it into my Dantian? Wouldn’t that be the same as a real Xuan Dan?”

“Isn’t that a pretty good idea?”

Li Mo thought Elder Xue’s idea was very creative, truly worthy of a master alchemist. He was a genius no less than himself.

But at this moment, Xue Jing sighed.

It seemed his method had failed.

“How did it fail?” Li Mo asked.

Xue Jing’s lips parted, but he hesitated, ultimately letting out another heavy sigh.

Tang Xiaobao slapped his forehead as he remembered.

“Master took the Xuan Dan to the latrine and had to use a lantern to search for it...”

“Insolent disciple, shut your mouth!”

Being reminded of such an embarrassing matter at his age, even Xue Jing’s thick old face couldn’t help but flush slightly.

Li Mo: “........”

After a moment of silence, he looked up at the sky as if he had just snapped out of it.

“Wow, look, there’s a beautiful bird over there. Oh right, Elder Xue, what were you just saying?”

Little Li’s performative personality kicked in.

Knowing this kind of thing, he dared not sleep too soundly at night.

“Hmm, it is quite beautiful.”

Xue Jing nodded.

“Where is it...”

*Smack—*

The Master gave Tang Xiaobao a crack on the head.

Tang Xiaobao felt a bit wronged; there was clearly nothing in the sky.

*Cough, back to the point.*

Li Mo cleared his throat and straightened his expression.

“Elder Xue, the reason I dare to enter the furnace isn’t because I’m daydreaming.”

“First, my body-refining method is doing quite well.”

As he spoke, he casually took out a sharp weapon and flicked it with a finger.

The weapon immediately chipped.

Xue Jing raised an eyebrow, quite surprised by his disciple-grandson’s body-refining attainment.

But just this alone wasn’t enough.

Li Mo continued.

“Your disciple-grandson has also done a bit of research on his own physique.”

“I’ve discovered that I am immune to heat and cold.”

Xue Jing shook his head.

“Of course, martial artists aren’t afraid of cold and heat to a certain extent, but this...”

“I slept with Ying Bing for a month,” Li Mo added.

As his words fell.

The small courtyard became somewhat quiet.

“You...”

Xue Jing’s face filled with shock, his eyes wide, as if a storm was raging in his heart.

“That’s right.”

Li Mo nodded heavily.

“You two have already reached that step?”

“...Elder Xue, you should focus more on my physique.”

Black lines appeared on Li Mo’s forehead.

“Hmm... if it’s to the extent that you aren’t afraid of high temperatures or severe cold...”

Xue Jing retracted his mind.

After much deliberation, he finally took a deep breath.

“In that case, let’s give it a try.”

“If anything goes wrong, we stop immediately.”

......

At the same time.

The main peak of Qingyuan.

“Your progress in the Internal Breath Realm has already broken the sect’s record, and you were able to kill a Observation Realm expert while still at Internal Breath.”

“Even many years ago, Qingyuan Sect never produced a disciple like you.”

Shangguan Wencang showed a pleased smile.

“The Sect Master overpraises me.”

Ying Bing nodded slightly.

To this day, she had never called Shangguan Wencang “Master.”

And the latter had never demanded it.

“Once you enter the Xuan Dan Realm, probably none of the Observation Realm deacons or disciples in the Qingyuan Sect will be your match.”

Shangguan Wencang said.

Elder Su of Luoxia Peak, Qian Bufan, and Han He had no objections.

Even if Ying Bing were placed in the Central Divine Continent, she would be extremely dazzling.

“You have always walked your own unique path in cultivation.”

“The reason I called you here today is also to ask.”

“What do you plan to observe to enter the Observation Realm?”

Shangguan Wencang asked solemnly.

“Grand Yin.”

Ying Bing answered without hesitation.

Observing the Grand Yin would allow her to further control the Grand Yin power within her body.

Shangguan Wencang wasn’t surprised by this answer.

He seemed to have prepared for it long ago.

“If the Grand Yin succeeds, it will naturally be a Divine Form, but it hangs high in the sky,终究 (zhōngjiǔ - in the end/after all) remains something unattainable to us.”

Observation isn’t just about seeing it.

The Grand Yin, the Grand Sun, the stars in the sky—observing them is naturally stronger than observing birds and beasts.

But to understand their essence and truly fit them into one’s ‘heart’ is something rarely seen throughout the ages.

After a moment of silence, unable to see Ying Bing’s expression, Shangguan Wencang spoke again.

“Our Qingyuan Sect has a path of observation no less than the Grand Yin.”

“It is also suitable for you, and moreover, it is easier to walk.”

“That is to condense the forms of a hundred birds! To gather the Phoenix God!”

“Are you... willing?”

When Shangguan Wencang reached this point, a strong light flashed in his eyes.

The several elders also seemed to hold their breath.

This was Qingyuan Sect’s greatest secret, known only to each Sect Master.

“I will not give up on observing the Grand Yin form.”

Ying Bing spoke softly.

The light in Shangguan Wencang’s eyes dimmed slightly.

“In that case, I cannot force you...”

“The Phoenix God, I intended to gather anyway.”

Ying Bing spoke again.

Hmm?

The elders didn’t understand.

What does that mean?

The next moment.

Two colors of light shone simultaneously.

One was born from Grand Yin energy, condensing all things; the other seemed real yet illusory, flowing with shimmering light.

It made Ying Bing’s black hair dance, as if she were an existence not of this world.

“Two types of Internal Breath?”

Qian Bufan realized.

“Are you planning... to condense two Xuan Dans, observe both the Grand Yin and the Hundred Birds form, gather two Divinities, and possess two layers of scenery?”

Han He asked softly.

He was afraid that if he opened his mouth too wide, his heart would jump out.

“Yes.”

Ying Bing nodded.

The elders couldn’t help but smile wryly.

They had dealt with Ying Bing several times, so their immunity had improved.

Who could keep gasping in surprise every day?

However, today, even exhausting their imagination, they hadn’t expected Ying Bing to walk this path.

It was very difficult.

But looking at the girl’s clear, deep eyes, they couldn’t bring themselves to dissuade her.

They even felt in their hearts that she clearly knew what she was doing and had a fair amount of confidence.

If she really succeeded...

The Grand Yin, the Hundred Birds, would both be Divine Forms.

Depending on complexity and subtlety, the forms condensed in the Observation Realm also have levels.

Lower Form, Middle Form, Upper Form, Extreme Form, Great Way Divine Form.

Dual Divine Forms?

At the very least, they had never heard of it.

“Good. Since you have such courage, it makes me seem petty.”

Shangguan Wencang slammed his pipe on the table.

“If you can successfully condense two Xuan Dans, I will take you to the Main Peak Ancestral Hall.”
