# Chapter 1: Damn It! I’ve Become a Replacement?

"Li Zhengjing, seventeen years old, peak perfection in external martial arts."

"Status: Outer disciple of the Ancient Moon Peak of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, second son of Marquis Jian'an."

"Hidden identity: The 763rd backup vessel for the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord."

"Fate: Cultivating the 'Viscera-Nurturing Inner Qi Technique' (incomplete and flawed version), failed to develop inner qi, damaging the foundational organs. Seven days later, during the inner disciple assessment, he will fail to advance, be discarded by the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, refined into a Blood Pill, and die without a complete corpse!"

The young man sitting quietly in his room opened his eyes, his expression complex.

The golden page in his mind had accompanied him since his transmigration seventeen years ago. Until now, it had remained blank, showing no extraordinary properties.

But last night, after failing to break through to the inner qi realm and preparing to record his cultivation failures, text appeared on it for the first time.

The sudden influx of information was overwhelming. Even after a night, he still couldn't calm down.

"I, Li Zhengjing, am a legitimate disciple of the Immortal Sect. How the hell did I become a backup vessel?"

"Who the hell is this Thousand Illusions Divine Lord?"

"The 763rd backup vessel?"

"Discarded in seven days? Refined into a Blood Pill? Die without a complete corpse?"

Li Zhengjing rubbed his temples, his head throbbing.

Last night, he had considered reporting this to the sect!

But the moment the thought crossed his mind, the 'Fate' line on the golden page changed:

"Fate: At noon today, after reporting the matter of the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, he will be silenced by the master of Ancient Moon Peak, dying without a complete corpse!"

"They're in cahoots!"

"Damn that Ancient Moon Peak master! Screw that Thousand Illusions Divine Lord!"

Then, he considered secretly contacting his father, Marquis Jian'an, in the capital.

But his fate changed again:

"Attempted to leak the existence of the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, was captured alive, tortured, soul extracted, died without a complete corpse, ashes scattered!"

"Why the hell does everything end with 'dying without a complete corpse'?"

Li Zhengjing wondered if someone was monitoring his every move.

He glanced around, seeing the fish in the pond, the dog by the yard, even the grass on the wall—everything seemed like a potential spy for that damned Thousand Illusions Divine Lord!

No contacting the capital!

No reporting to the sect!

How could he survive?

How could he save himself?

He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, thinking, "It might not be a hopeless situation. Since the golden page has revealed its power, perhaps there's a way to break this deadlock..."

In his past life, he had bought an ancient book from a secondhand stall. On his way home, he was struck by lightning.

The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was the book turning to ashes, revealing a flash of golden light.

When he woke again, he was a swaddled infant, with this golden page embedded in his mind.

"Seventeen years since transmigrating, the only thing that ever triggered the golden page was poison!"

"Half a year ago in the capital, I was poisoned and near death. That night, the golden page absorbed the poison, saving my life, then returned to dormancy."

"With the capital in turmoil, my father used his treasured token from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect to send me here."

"For the past six months, I've searched the sect for poison to stimulate the golden page, but found nothing."

"But last night, the golden page reacted again!"

Li Zhengjing picked up the brush on the table and murmured, "Is this the reason?"

This spirit brush was a gift from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect to new disciples. Exquisitely crafted with extraordinary materials, its handle originally held a jade-like crystal called a spirit stone!

Now, the "jade" at the end of the handle was gone!

"Last night, I was recording my cultivation insights with this brush in my mouth."

"So, the low-grade spirit stone was in my mouth. Does that mean... the golden page's change was triggered by the spirit stone?"

Spirit stones were formed from condensed heaven and earth spiritual energy. Even the lowest-grade spirit stones were treasures to transcendent beings, aiding cultivation and enhancing power.

The spirit stone on this brush, though low-grade, was still a rare item in the mortal world. But now... it had vanished!

"Right, low-grade spirit stones contain spiritual energy. Poisonous creatures, strictly speaking, also fall beyond ordinary toxins, their venom infused with spiritual energy."

"That's why the poison half a year ago triggered the golden page, but the spider venom that nearly killed me recently had no effect!"

For seventeen years, Li Zhengjing hadn't known how to activate the golden page. After a night of fruitless pondering, he now had a direction.

"Is the key to activating the golden page spiritual energy?"

With this thought, he set down the brush and picked up a medicine cauldron he had retrieved earlier.

When he first joined the sect, to test the golden page, he bought a "poisonous creature" from an outer disciple.

The seller had boasted it was a pure-blooded descendant of a Southern Barbarian Poison King, requiring a "spirit cauldron" with a low-grade spirit stone to suppress it!

But after nearly dying, he realized it was just an ordinary venomous spider!

If not for the antidote his elder brother had given him before he left home, the consequences would have been dire.

Now, it seemed the most valuable part of that expensive purchase was the low-grade spirit stone on the "spirit cauldron."

"Life and death hang in the balance over seven days, involving a 'transcendent being.'"

Li Zhengjing removed the low-grade spirit stone from the cauldron and placed it in his mouth, murmuring, "This might be my only hope."

Last night, with the brush in his mouth, the spirit stone had triggered the golden page.

If his guess was correct, holding the spirit stone in his mouth now would allow the golden page to absorb its energy and reveal its power.

Sure enough, within three breaths, the golden page in his mind shimmered with light!

New text appeared beneath the original "Fate" line!

"It worked!"

Suppressing his excitement, he focused intently.

"Li Zhengjing, seventeen years old, peak perfection in external martial arts."

"Surface identity: Outer disciple of Ancient Moon Peak, Feather Transformation Immortal Sect."

"Actual identity: Second son of Marquis Jian'an."

"Hidden identity: The 763rd backup vessel for the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord."

"Fate: Cultivating the 'Viscera-Nurturing Inner Qi Technique' (incomplete and flawed version), failed to develop inner qi, damaging the foundational organs. Seven days later, during the inner disciple assessment, he will fail to advance, be discarded by the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord, refined into a Blood Pill, and die without a complete corpse!"

"Method to alter fate as follows: ..."

"..."

"What's below?"

Li Zhengjing waited, his excitement fading into silence as he realized: "There's nothing below?"

He understood—the spiritual energy in this low-grade spirit stone wasn't enough for the golden page to reveal the complete method to alter his fate!

To see the full method, he needed more spirit stones!

Frustrated, Li Zhengjing couldn't help but curse, "Damn cliffhanger!"

Then, a thought struck him. He focused on the "Fate" line and muttered, "Wait... The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect is one of the world's three great immortal sanctums, with complete orthodox teachings. How could the 'Viscera-Nurturing Inner Qi Technique' I'm cultivating be incomplete and flawed?"

His expression darkened, but just then, a cold voice came from outside the courtyard.

"Outer disciple Li Zhengjing, absent from this morning's lecture, disregarding sect rules. Penalty: deduction of this month's medicinal bath materials!"

Li Zhengjing froze, realizing it was already noon—he'd missed the morning session.

Bang!

Before he could react, the courtyard gate was kicked open!

A gaunt, elderly man with a pale, sickly complexion stood there, exuding a chilling aura.

"Old ghost Chen Youyu is here to cause trouble again."

Sighing, Li Zhengjing picked up the "Viscera-Nurturing Inner Qi Technique" manual and walked into the courtyard.

"Elder Chen, I recall Sect Rule Six states that missing one day's lecture deducts three days of medicinal bath materials. Why am I losing the entire month's remaining seventeen days for missing half a day?"

"Originally, it was three days."

The old man replied impassively, "But you refused to answer the door and now show no respect, acting hostile. Offending an elder, disrespecting superiors—this is your second offense, warranting additional punishment. Do you admit it?"

"Screw you, you pathetic loser!" Li Zhengjing said coolly. "I didn't admit it before, but now I can."

Chen Youyu didn't understand the first part, but the tone was unmistakable. Unfazed, he flicked his wrist, sending a long whip snaking out to snatch the manual from Li Zhengjing's hand.

Retracting the whip, he tucked the manual away and said flatly, "You've had the 'Viscera-Nurturing Inner Qi Technique' for half a month. It was due back at the library today. You're overdue—third offense, additional penalty!"

Li Zhengjing looked up at the blazing sun and sighed, "Elder Chen, are you blind? It's high noon—the day isn't over. How is this overdue?"

Chen Youyu pocketed the manual and asked coolly, "Do you disagree?"

Li Zhengjing shook his head respectfully. "In six months here, thanks to your 'care,' I've been penalized twelve times. Each time, I've been so 'convinced' I wanted to visit your grave!"

"Disagree if you must, but accept the penalty!"

Chen Youyu stepped forward, his voice icy. "You're a mere outer disciple. As an elder, if I say you're penalized, you accept it!"

"Blame it on the recommendation token from Yuan Zhengfeng that got you into the sect!"

"Remember—as long as I'm an elder here, you'll never rise!"

With that, he coiled his whip, tossed a blank silver token to the ground, and left, throwing back, "Only when you become an inner disciple can you argue with me!"

Li Zhengjing picked up the token—proof of eligibility for the inner disciple assessment—and frowned. "I've reached peak perfection in external martial arts. One wisp of inner qi, and I'll advance to inner disciple, matching his status. Why is Chen Youyu so confident, as if he's sure I'll never make it?"

As long as the old ghost remained in the outer sect, Li Zhengjing would never rise?

He seemed certain Li Zhengjing would never cultivate inner qi in his lifetime.

How could he be so sure?

Li Zhengjing looked at the broken door latch on the ground, then at the ink stains on his palm, murmuring, "He didn't wait for me to return the manual to the library—he came to take it himself."

"Did Chen Youyu tamper with the 'Viscera-Nurturing Inner Qi Technique'?"

Frowning, Li Zhengjing thought, "But even as an outer sect elder, he couldn't have unchecked power here!"

The process of borrowing and returning cultivation manuals involved six elders. Any discrepancy would be reported to the inner sect for investigation!

"Was Chen afraid the manual would be inspected by the library elders, exposing the tampering, so he came to confiscate it?"

Li Zhengjing closed his eyes, reviewing the "Fate" on the golden page.

"Chen Youyu couldn't have altered the manual alone—unless a high-ranking sect member ordered it."

"But if a high-ranking member wanted me dead, killing an obscure outer disciple would be trivial over six months."

"Why risk shaking the sect's foundations by tampering with a manual just to ruin my prospects?"

"Is this connected to the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord?"

His expression grew graver as he pondered, but finally, he sighed. "I'll investigate later. Right now, the real crisis is the inner disciple assessment in seven days."

He didn't know why he'd become a backup vessel, but he knew failing the assessment meant death!

Currently, all he knew about the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord was that the master of Ancient Moon Peak—one of the sect's seven peaks, a transcendent being—was complicit!

Beyond that, he knew nothing about this monstrous figure.

The unknown was the greatest terror.
