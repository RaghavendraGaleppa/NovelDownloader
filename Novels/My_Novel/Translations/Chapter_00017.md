# Chapter 17: Passing the Assessment, Rewarding the Tiger Blood Pill

The guards敏锐地察觉到, Pang Long and Luo Tongyun both lacked confidence in Li Xian. For a time, they whispered among themselves:

"It seems Li Xian will have a hard time passing this test."

"Hey, if he can't even pass the new recruit assessment, staying as a guard would just bring us shame."

"Exactly. If he's really that useless, he might as well go back where he came from."

Luo Tongyun was a Class C guard. His daily duties weren't particularly heavy, nor were they light. But the thought of Li Xian seeking his guidance on martial arts, only for him to have to put in the effort to brush him off, was tedious.

It was better to avoid the problem altogether.

So, during this period, he deliberately took on more jobs than usual, acting as if he were terribly busy.

This was to avoid Li Xian's questions, and he was certain Li Xian wouldn't be able to figure anything out on his own.

As for Li Xian, since joining the guards, he wasn't exactly antisocial, but he rarely interacted with others.

When practicing his fists, he always preferred to find a remote, quiet spot, training alone with his head down, completely absorbed in his own world.

Very few people paid attention to him, and no one knew just how skilled his fist techniques were. They just followed the crowd, assuming his fist technique proficiency was likely below standard.

"Brother Luo, please guide me," Li Xian said, stepping forward with a cupped-hand salute, his tone calm.

"I strike without mercy. If you get hurt, I hope you won't hold it against me."

Luo Tongyun returned the salute perfunctorily, left hand behind his back, and said, "I'll use only one hand. If you can last a hundred moves against me, you'll be considered to have passed the threshold."

He then turned his head to look at Pang Long, seeking his opinion. "Commander Pang, does this seem acceptable?"

Pang Long nodded. "Whatever. Martial arts can't be faked. We'll know your true skill the moment you start."

"Good!"

Li Xian didn't waste any words, assumed a fighting stance, and stared directly at Luo Tongyun.

"Come on," Luo Tongyun said, chest out, head high, brimming with confidence. He was calm and composed, gesturing for Li Xian to make his move.

Seeing this, Li Xian took two steps forward and threw a straight punch aimed at Luo Tongyun's face. The punch was plain and unremarkable, straightforward, showing no signs of any true fist technique.

"He really hasn't learned anything," Luo Tongyun laughed inwardly. He gently moved his right hand to parry, intending to effortlessly dissolve the move and demonstrate his own prowess.

Just as the fist and palm were about to meet, Li Xian's toes twisted, causing his body to turn slightly. This subtle change in posture made the fist锋 suddenly veer off. It was originally aimed at the face but now angled towards the lower abdomen.

This was a move from the "Four Directions Fist": "Point East, Strike West." Fist techniques are very direct, and it's easy to distinguish between real and feint moves.

Especially for basic fist techniques. The套路 are limited to a few moves, either real or feint, and it's not difficult to get started.

Once a punch is thrown, the force汇聚s at the fist's锋. It has to follow through to the end. Only extremely skilled martial arts masters can achieve "free control," able to retract and change moves mid-strike.

The insidiousness of the Four Directions Fist lies in this: its path is straight, but by twisting the body, the path can be deflected. This achieves the purpose of "Point East, Strike West."

For a novice martial artist, in a close-quarters fight, this move is unexpected and very effective.

Moreover, Li Xian had the initiative from the start. It wasn't just "Point East, Strike West," but also "Show Weakness to the Enemy." This move had never failed him.

Luo Tongyun, deeply versed in the principles of the Four Directions Fist, felt a sudden chill down his spine. This simple punch not only showed that Li Xian had already grasped the basics of the fist technique.

It also showed... that his proficiency in this area was somewhat approaching his own!

He hastily brought up his other hand to block, but because he had been too arrogant at the start, it was already too late.

With a "bang," his palm went numb and swelled with pain. Luo Tongyun cursed in his heart, "This kid isn't holding back, he's using his full strength!"

He was forced back three or five steps.

His face turned青 and then红, thoroughly losing face. Just moments ago, he had been standing with his hands behind his back, elegant and poised, like a true master.

Now, he was a picture of狼狈, his expression失控.

He憋了口大气, trying to save face by offering a generous compliment, "Good punch! You've lived up to my teachings! This 'Point East, Strike West' move, you've touched upon the door..."

The "way" in "doorway" hadn't even left his mouth.

Li Xian冷笑ed, and taking advantage of the moment Luo Tongyun was speaking, he surged forward and threw three consecutive punches at his abdomen.

When martial artists fight to the death,

The biggest taboo is losing your breath!

Shouting the name of a move can boost one's气势 and help focus the breath. But if one says something无关紧要, the breath is bound to disperse.

That becomes dangerous.

Luo Tongyun was far too arrogant, placing himself on a pedestal, thinking he was "instructing" Li Xian.

He wanted to点评 to salvage some dignity, but he didn't know that Li Xian, while not one to hold a grudge over every little thing, certainly pursued all debts.

He truly wanted to use this opportunity to beat him up, not letting go of any chance!

Every punch he threw was竭尽全力, aimed squarely at vital spots. Luo Tongyun realized something was wrong and连连 retreat, his expression turning extremely ugly.

At this point, he no longer wanted to hold back, but he had already lost the initiative. To find an opening to counterattack amidst Li Xian's storm of blows was no easy task.

He never expected that although this kid looked thin and scrawny, his strength was truly不小.

"Martial arts sparring is about life and death, victory and defeat."

"Martial arts proficiency is only one factor. For a martial artist like me, what truly decides the outcome is on-the-spot adaptability, as well as initiative and rhythm."

Li Xian pushed his advantage of initiative to the limit. At the peak of his momentum, he unleashed a "Fist Shakes the Four Directions."

This punch was a risky move, even more insidious than "Point East, Strike West."

Because this move even deceives the practitioner himself.

This "Fist Shakes the Four Directions," despite having the word "fist" in its name, is actually a kick!

A kick move is mixed into the fist techniques. Those who haven't grasped the essence would practice it as a fist move, unable to unleash its power.

The kick shot out, and Luo Tongyun truly didn't expect it. In an instant, he was kicked in the chest. His chest cavity震ed, and he spat out blood.

He was kicked飞 three zhang远.

Unable to稳住 his footing, he fell to the ground with a噗通 sound, rolling three times.

Everyone was dumbfounded...

What was going on? Wasn't it supposed to be a master going easy on a disciple? How did it turn into this scene?

"Good!"

A loud, appreciative voice rang out.

It came from Pang Long. He stood up, his expression激动. "Very good, your fist technique proficiency has exceeded my expectations!"

The moment he saw Li Xian's kick, Pang Long was彻底 won over.

Because the "Four Directions Fist" was created in her spare time by the Manor's Madam. At the time, she had a sudden whim and incorporated kick moves into the fist techniques to achieve an unexpected effect.

This secret was known only to Pang Long. When he taught the Four Directions Fist to the guards, he didn't特意 mention it.

To this day, Li Xian was the only one who had executed the kick move. Just for this point alone, it was enough to make Pang Long take notice.

"Very good, Li Xian, you've passed the assessment!"

Pang Long strode over, laughed heartily, and重重ly patted Li Xian's shoulder.

Li Xian smiled but said nothing.

"How did you know that 'Fist Shakes the Four Directions' was a kick move?" Pang Long asked.

"I just felt, while practicing, that kicking felt more natural than punching," Li Xian replied casually.

"Hahaha. Excellent, truly excellent. You have great灵性," Pang Long said. "This is a 'Tiger Blood Pill'. Take it. From now on, you are an official guard."

"Starting tomorrow, besides your martial arts training, you will also need to participate in the guard's duties. Work hard and don't be lax in your martial arts."

"I will," Li Xian nodded firmly.

The assessment was over. Luo Tongyun wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and walked up to Li Xian. He seemed to want to say something, his expression changing again and again—anger, confusion, surprise, embarrassment...

He wanted to maintain some dignity, but in the end, he couldn't swallow his pride.

His eyes narrowed, and he dropped the act entirely. With a cold glare and a heavy "Hmph," he turned and left.

"Fourth Brother, congratulations."

Zhao Han and the others came over, also happy for Li Xian.

"Fourth Brother, you've really made it. Do you know, Commander Pang has taken a liking to you," Wang Chun said.

"Oh?" Li Xian asked, "What do you mean?"

"Tiger Blood Pill... this is a Tiger Blood Pill!" Zhuo Yilie said. "When we passed the new recruit assessment, Commander Pang only rewarded us with Deer Blood Pills. The difference between that and a Tiger Blood Pill is not small at all."

"Fourth Brother," Zhao Han said gravely, "You should take this Tiger Blood Pill as soon as possible, otherwise it will definitely attract envy."

Just as he finished speaking.

A figure blocked the path ahead.

It was Jiang Yun, the Class B guard they had encountered a few days earlier.

"You are Li Xian?" Jiang Yun stepped forward quickly and said coolly, "Are you selling this Tiger Blood Pill, or not?"
