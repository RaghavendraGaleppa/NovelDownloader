# Chapter 617: The True Lord Arrives

Xu Yunfan’s long-prepared final strike erupted with cataclysmic force.

Martial qi and blood surged like a dragon.

The soul-flames ignited by the Hundred Desires Secret Art burned fiercely.

The true essence of the Myriad Calamities Slaughter Sword Intent, comprehended by his clone Han Shi and refined by the Attribute Panel to its purest form.

In the crucible of ultimate fury and the crisis between life and death, the three forces were forcibly fused by Xu Yunfan with his lifelong cultivation, transforming into a peak strike that surpassed everything he had ever achieved before.

Xu Yunfan raised the True Martial Sword, its blade covered in cracks.

The Thousand Calamities Genghai Raging Wave Sword Art, Slaughter Sword Intent.

The True Martial Sword in his hand, already riddled with cracks, let out a groan unable to bear the strain. The ancient sword body was instantly covered entirely by a sinister sword light, blood-red in color and entwined with purple-gold lightning.

There were no profound sword techniques, only the most direct and primitive downward slash.

**BOOM!**

The platinum sword line, representing Ye Yuan’s lifelong swordsmanship insights and his "No-Return" will, collided violently with the flood of Slaughter Sword Intent Xu Yunfan had summoned by drawing upon his martial qi and blood, the Hundred Desires Secret Art, and the essence of his clone’s swordsmanship.

Time seemed to freeze at that moment.

Blood instantly gushed from Xu Yunfan’s mouth and nose, his eyes turning blood-red. Under the shockwave of the terrifying will collision, his formidable Divine Celestial Dao Body, like a delicate porcelain, cracked with a spiderweb pattern. Blood mist sprayed from every acupoint on his body!

Ye Yuan fared no better. The Slaughter Sword Intent nullified his ultimate sword strike. Before he could generate new force, he was torn open by the fearless, coordinated attacks of the various Star Lords from the Zhou Tian Star Dou Great Array.

Just as he pulled his sword back to defend, a giant fist shadow wreathed in killing intent slammed heavily into his back. It was Sun Yue.

His sword robe was torn, and blood shot out.

The Three-Tipped Double-Bladed Spear, the Fire-Tipped Spear, and even the Heaven-Shaking Staff…

The various Star Lords transformed from the Banner Spirits, their power amplified by the Zhou Tian Star Dou Great Array, unleashed their fatal strikes simultaneously.

In that instant, the Slaughter Sword Intent Xu Yunfan unleashed shot up to the heavens. With a violent and overbearing demeanor, it tore apart the No-Return Platinum Sword Line that symbolized Ye Yuan’s swordsmanship culmination.

*Riiip!*

A faint but clear sound of tearing silk echoed across the East Sea.

The platinum line, formed by the unyielding sword intent, shattered inch by inch.

The remnant Slaughter Sword Intent, carrying Xu Yunfan’s unyielding spirit and fury, instantly followed the torn path, ignoring the rapidly dimming pure white domain, and ruthlessly pierced into Ye Yuan’s body, which was already heavily wounded by the sword intent backlash and the Star Lords’ attacks.

Ye Yuan’s body stiffened abruptly, the burning unyieldingness and determination in his eyes freezing.

The last light on the Huijian Sword completely extinguished. The sword body, covered in cracks, let out a light, sorrowful cry and shattered piece by piece.

His massive body was sent flying by the remaining impact force. The protective sword qi around him dissipated, and he crashed heavily onto the sea surface suppressed by the Star Dou Array, raising a thousand-zhang wave of murky water.

The pure white domain shattered and vanished.

Under the remaining starlight of the Star Dou Array, only silence remained.

Ye Yuan lay in the cold seawater, his life force rapidly extinguishing like a candle in the wind, his body gradually growing cold, his soul like a dying ember.

An elder of the Tianji Peak of the Myriad Calamities Sword Sect, a powerhouse who had one foot in the Golden Core Realm, was slain here by the Zhou Tian Star Dou Great Array and Xu Yunfan’s Slaughter Sword Intent—a sword intent born from the fusion of three secret arts and the extreme yet grandiose fury comprehended by his clone Han Shi.

Xu Yunfan panted heavily, forcibly suppressing his churning qi and blood and the intense pain in his soul.

Without hesitation, he used his spiritual sense to command the last of the array’s power to restrain Ye Yuan’s dissipating soul. With a flick of the Star Spirit Banner, he drew Ye Yuan into it.

A Foundation Establishment perfection swordsman who had comprehended a sword intent and manifested a phenomenon had long since refined his soul into a sword intent, making him perfectly suited to become a banner spirit within the Star Spirit Banner.

*‘You have successfully killed a Foundation Establishment perfection swordsman. Your cultivation has deepened.’*

Glancing at the Attribute Panel’s notification in his vision, Xu Yunfan secretly let out a breath.

Ever since the Attribute Panel gained the ‘Cultivation’ column, every time his cultivation increased, even though his true scripture was already perfected, his mana and physical body continued to slowly improve.

Now with 768 points of cultivation, Xu Yunfan was certain that when it reaches a thousand, his Fruit Position would surely be able to take root.

Just killing Ye Yuan, this Foundation Establishment perfection swordsman, gave him a full thirty points of cultivation. It was truly not easy.

With a wave of the Star Spirit Banner, the sky-obscuring, boundless starlight vanished instantly. The sky above the East Sea returned to bright daylight, leaving only the lingering scent of Divine Celestial Thunder crackling in the sea breeze, carrying the heat and burnt smell after the great battle.

Xu Yunfan stood in mid-air, softly exhaling a mouthful of turbid air.

The seawater beneath his feet, suppressed by his immense mana and influenced by the extreme Yin and cold essence of water, had frozen into a massive volume. Now, it was slowly melting and pouring back into the giant pit.

The withdrawal of the Zhou Tian Star Dou Great Array also removed the immense pressure exerted on the entire sea area.

With a thought, an invisible mana hand reached out, capturing Ye Xuan, who was imprisoned in a water vapor cage not far away, and drawing her back to his side.

This female cultivator from the Myriad Calamities Sword Sect still had a look of immense shock and sorrow in her eyes, having witnessed her uncle Ye Yuan being ground down within the starlight firsthand.

He had already obtained the coordinates from Lu Chuan and verified their authenticity, but since Ye Xuan had prior information, he naturally needed to find a place to question her thoroughly.

Immediately after, the Attribute Panel jumped out with a large number of cultivation increase notifications.

He didn’t even have time to glance at the large batch of information prompts that had just popped up on the Attribute Panel.

The moment Ye Xuan was drawn to his side, an indescribable pressure suddenly descended.

It wasn’t a magical attack, nor a burst of momentum. It was more like the space Xu Yunfan was in had been instantly turned into a vacuum. All free-floating energy, diffusing mana fluctuations, and even the sound of airflow fell into absolute solidification and silence.

Then, a figure appeared without warning directly in front of Xu Yunfan.

He seemed to be imprinted directly onto that solidified space, as if he were a part of the void itself.

The newcomer had an ancient and austere face,看不出 his exact age. He wore a black Daoist robe embroidered with the phenomena of rivers and mountains flowing, and mountains and seas rising and falling. A clear, vital energy surrounded him like mist. As his deep eyes opened and closed, a majestic Dao rhythm, as if containing the sinking and rising of sun and moon, flowed within.

This person was the Clear Source Wonderful Dao Chengyun Xuanqiong True Lord, one of the Golden Core True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect.

He was also the patron Xu Yunfan had currently attached himself to.

“Disciple pays respects to the Clear Source True Lord.”

Xu Yunfan’s heart pounded violently. He had never imagined that the Clear Source True Lord would suddenly appear.

*This is terrifying!*

On the surface, however, he maintained the respect a disciple should have and bowed, his movements slightly stiff.

Under the opponent’s invisible domain suppression, even lifting his hand felt sluggish and heavy.

He deliberately revealed a hint of weakness from not having fully recovered after the battle, and took the opportunity to ask, “True Lord, your divine carriage has graced the East Sea. May I ask if there are any instructions?”

The Clear Source True Lord did not immediately respond to Xu Yunfan’s question.

His gaze fell upon Xu Yunfan, slowly penetrating the purple lightning patterns on the surface of the Divine Celestial Dao Body, as if scanning his soul’s origin and every inch of his dantian’s purple mansion.

Finally, his gaze fixed on the barely perceptible action of Xu Yunfan subtly protecting the Star Spirit Banner in his sleeve. His tone carried a sigh that seemed to see through everything.

“So that’s how it is… When the Heavenly Realm collapsed, the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit that vanished from the Heavenly Emperor’s Dao Palace… is actually in your hands.”

*Hum!*

Xu Yunfan’s mind shook violently. His entire body’s qi and blood and mana instinctively wanted to boil and explode instantly. His defense mechanism was completely ignited by that sentence.
