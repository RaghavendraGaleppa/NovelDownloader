# Chapter 116: The Sole Survivor of Tianxing Cave Heaven!

**Location:** Stone Manor, Hongshan Town, Jiangshang Prefecture, Southeast Region, Great Zhou Dynasty.

A hundred government officers stood in formation before the Stone Manor. Leading them was a figure at the peak of the True Qi realm.

"Are you the so-called 'Blood Swordmaster,' famed for sealing throats with a single stroke?" Shi Yuan looked at the man and spoke slowly. "Your reputation shakes Jiangshang Prefecture. The Prefect reveres you as an honored guest, and you are hailed as the strongest in the Southeast Region. I’ve heard of you..."

The Blood Swordmaster was an elderly man, well past seventy. Born into a minor sect with a single lineage, the highest cultivation his predecessors had ever achieved was the True Qi realm. In his youth, he had roamed the land with arrogance, but by middle age, realizing his lack of opportunities, he joined the government, serving the imperial court by hunting criminals and slaying demons. Finally, in his sixties, he was bestowed with rare treasures and twelve graded spirit stones, allowing him to open all 365 acupoints and achieve Perfection of the Heavenly Cycle.

Since then, he had been known as the strongest in the Southeast Region, his reputation unshaken for over a decade. Yet, deep down, he knew he was growing old. He had left behind a bloodline in the Southeast Region, founding a family. Thus, he had no desire to make enemies.

His gaze at Shi Yuan held no hostility, nor did he seek to intimidate. "Shi Yuan, you are highly regarded by the Prefect. If you follow my path, serve the court, receive guidance from the righteous deities, and have a Human Immortal to lead you, perhaps in a few decades, you too may transcend the mundane."

The Blood Swordmaster's expression turned solemn. "At noon today, I received an order from the Imperial Preceptor’s estate in the capital—to capture the members of the Gao Clan. This is the Imperial Preceptor’s will! You are a prodigy with boundless prospects, but right now, you are merely a junior at the peak of Internal Qi. Do not overestimate yourself and defy the laws of Great Zhou..."

He gripped his sword and stepped forward. "I came to your manor alone, without bringing the other officers, to give you a chance. If you persist in your defiance in front of everyone, even I cannot help you."

Shi Yuan's expression darkened. "Third Master Gao wrote to me, asking me to protect his clansmen. They’ve barely stepped into my home, and now you want to throw them into prison? If word spreads, what will become of my reputation?"

With that, he took a step forward. "If you want to take them from me, you must at least name their crime. What have they done?"

"Their guilt is irrelevant. What matters is that the Imperial Preceptor himself ordered the capture of the Gao Clan..." The Blood Swordmaster sighed. "Your acquaintance with Third Master Gao was merely a chance meeting in the capital. Is it worth throwing away your bright future for a mere promise? Shi Yuan, you are too young and impulsive—willing to walk to your doom for a single vow?"

He drew his sword. "I see great potential in you and wish to avoid conflict. But if you remain obstinate, you will die today!"

The sword pointed directly at Shi Yuan’s face, its edge gleaming. "This is my final warning. Will you listen?"

His eyes held a trace of regret. "The matter concerning the Gao Clan is grave. Beyond me, elites from various prefectures have been dispatched, even members of the imperial family... You cannot protect them."

Shi Yuan took a deep breath, fists clenched, his heart wavering.

"Rather than letting others capture you later, why not let me take you down and claim this merit for myself?"

The Blood Swordmaster could no longer restrain himself. His True Qi condensed into his sword, and in an instant, the blade shot toward Shi Yuan’s neck.

Previously, he had seen Shi Yuan as a rising star and sought to foster goodwill for the sake of his descendants. But now that Shi Yuan was determined to defy him, he was nothing more than an Internal Qi cultivator who could be slain with a single stroke!

As the sword thrust forward, Shi Yuan’s pupils constricted. The Internal Qi in his organs surged as he activated the Human Immortal secret technique. Yet even so, he felt the terror of impending death.

But just as he had anticipated, a flame appeared before him.

The sword pierced through the fire—but in that instant, the Blood Swordmaster felt an excruciating, searing pain in his hand. He had no choice but to release the hilt and retreat.

"What?!" The Blood Swordmaster stared in shock at the sword on the ground, glowing red-hot. Had he not let go in time, the blade—a divine weapon in the mortal world—would have melted entirely in the flames.

"The strongest in the Southeast Region?" From within the flames emerged a strange bird, its green horns and golden feathers glinting, its gaze sharp. "Birdie here is also at the True Qi realm. Let’s see how you compare to the Young Master of Kunlun back in the day..."

"A great demon?!" The Blood Swordmaster’s heart chilled.

But at that moment, another voice sounded from outside the Stone Manor.

"A mere rogue cultivator from the Southeast Region, born of a minor sect with limited knowledge and heritage, destined never to reach Human Immortality—how strong could he possibly be?"

A man clad in armor, a long saber at his waist, strode forward. Beside him stood another elder at the peak of the True Qi realm.

The elder smiled. "The General is of the imperial bloodline, trained in the world’s supreme techniques, personally instructed by Human Immortals in the capital, and revered by the court’s righteous deities. He is no less than any immortal sect disciple, equal to the Young Master of Kunlun in his time, surpassing the current Daoist Heir of Luofu and even Yu Hua Immortal Sect’s Lu Huaiyuan..."

The imperial guard commander’s expression remained calm. He had reached the peak of the True Qi realm over a decade ago. In his heart, if not for the curse of his bloodline preventing him from breaking through to Human Immortality, he might already have ascended to that transcendent realm.

Yet even without the hope of Human Immortality, he remained one of the strongest True Qi cultivators in the world. With the Young Master of Kunlun’s ascension, he considered himself the undisputed strongest beneath the Human Immortal realm!

A mere strange bird was nothing in his eyes!

"Hand over the Gao Clan members." The commander rested his hand on his saber, speaking indifferently. "Within the Great Zhou’s borders, countless talents emerge. Shi Yuan, if you submit to me, I will personally guide you. Otherwise, my blade will simply claim another life."

Without waiting for Shi Yuan’s response, he swung his saber at the strange bird. Shi Yuan had yet to act, but the bird had already used its flame abilities to resist the court’s forces!

"Defying the law warrants death!"

The saber descended—only to be met with a dragon’s roar!

A golden radiance enveloped the Stone Manor. The dragon’s might was overwhelming, freezing everyone in place.

A golden dragon coiled above the strange bird’s head, gazing down. Its scales gleamed, its ancient eyes profound and unfathomable.

Silence fell. Even breathing seemed to halt.

"The Hall-Guarding Golden Dragon..." The commander, who had claimed to be nearly invincible beneath the Human Immortal realm, felt his heart sink to the depths.

The Hall-Guarding Dragon Pillars were the sacred artifacts of the Great Zhou Dynasty. Now, all twenty-four pillars in the capital had shattered!

To his knowledge, the only remaining pillars were partly in the hands of the enigmatic Debt Collector, while one—combined with twenty-five golden dragons—had fallen into Li Zhengjing’s possession.

Li Zhengjing, the Venerable True Scenery, who possessed Human Immortal combat power, battled deities, and saved thousands of cultivators within the cave heaven!

"Why is he here?!" The commander cursed his luck inwardly. Had he known Li Zhengjing was present, he would never have accepted this mission.

Then he heard the strange bird speak.

"I was going to fight you all at the True Qi realm, but since you brought three peak True Qi experts and a thousand soldiers to gang up on me, I’ll drop the act. I am the great demon who now commands the Hall-Guarding Dragon Pillar!"

The Hanging Bird retracted the golden dragon and sighed, looking at the commander. "We’re not exactly friends, and you had a big mouth back in Xuanling Prefecture. I was planning to make you a 'familiar acquaintance,' but my master is merciful and wants to talk to you. Come along."

The Blood Swordmaster stood frozen. The elder beside him paled. Only the commander remained silent, sheathing his saber and stepping forward.

"Who is this bird’s master?" the elder whispered.

"I’ve always prided myself as one of the strongest beneath the Human Immortal realm, even after the Young Master of Kunlun ascended. Few could match me—perhaps not even the Daoist Heirs of immortal sects." The commander lowered his eyes. "But this man..."

"Li Zhengjing?" The Blood Swordmaster’s heart stirred. "He vanished for over a month and was hiding here?"

The three of them were all at the peak of the True Qi realm, standing at the pinnacle of mortal cultivation. The commander, in particular, had ambitions of replacing the Young Master of Kunlun as the strongest beneath Human Immortality.

Yet here stood a being with Human Immortal combat power!

"Even the Young Master of Kunlun, hailed as invincible beneath Human Immortality, would not dare act recklessly against a true Human Immortal." The commander recalled how, back in Xuanling Prefecture, he had tried to sow discord between Lu Huaiyuan and Li Zhengjing with a few words. 

Who could have guessed that in just a few months, Li Zhengjing—then merely at the Internal Qi realm—had far surpassed Lu Huaiyuan? Had he not defected from the Yu Hua Immortal Sect, Li Zhengjing might now be its true Daoist Heir—or even competing with Chen Zhu for the position of Ancient Moon Peak’s First Seat.

**In the backyard of the Stone Manor...**

The finest chef in Hongshan Town was roasting meat. The little dragon girl’s eyes sparkled with delight.

The Five Elements Creation Tree took root in the ground, instructing the Wave-Severing Gu while waving its branches. "Second Brother, watch closely. Among these people, only those three are at the peak of the True Qi realm—Perfection of the Heavenly Cycle, capable of externalizing True Qi. To poison them, you must find the right angle. Study their techniques and strike from the right direction. Once you do, killing them will be effortless!"

The Wave-Severing Gu let out a soft chirp, its eyes misty with anticipation. If the master gave the order, it would finally have its chance to prove itself!

Usually, it only practiced poisoning the master—always failing to kill him. The Hanging Bird often teased that as a Divine King Gu, one of the world’s deadliest poisons—and delicious to boot—it would have been eaten long ago if not for being family.

But it had never actually killed anyone, leaving it feeling like a fraud. Was it even a purebred Divine King Gu?

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing sipped tea in the courtyard, flanked by the descendants of the Gao Clan. Watching the imperial forces sent to capture them, the Gao youths trembled, placing their hopes in the man Shi Yuan revered as a deity.

"Master, I’ve brought them—all raw, not roasted yet." The Hanging Bird announced proudly.

Raw? Roasted? Did that mean they were about to be eaten alive? The group paled.

Demonic cultivators were known for cannibalistic practices—like the evil cultivator of Wanlin County or the Rage Monk who devoured human blood buns not long ago. Had Li Zhengjing, who had reached such heights in less than a year, also walked the dark path of consuming human flesh to enhance his power?

"Don’t be afraid. I’m a proper immortal cultivator!" Li Zhengjing smiled. "In the capital’s cave heaven, when five Human Immortals, five deities, and thousands of cultivators were nearly refined into pills, I didn’t even bat an eye. Why would I bother with you?"

He drained his cup and set it down, addressing the imperial commander. "During my time in the capital, I’d hoped to see you again, but you were away on patrol."

"I was dispatched to the Luofu Immortal Sect and missed the chance to witness the Venerable True Scenery’s glory!" The commander, his former arrogance gone, sighed. "In just a few months, you’ve ascended to the heavens... No longer mortal."

Though Li Zhengjing sat while he stood, the commander kept his eyes lowered. Back in Xuanling Prefecture, they had stood eye to eye, the commander’s gaze full of condescension. Now, even seated, Li Zhengjing was beyond his reach.

"Flattery won’t help." Li Zhengjing looked up calmly. "We share no past camaraderie, so let’s skip the pleasantries. Just answer me: why capture the Gao Clan?"

The commander clenched his teeth, hesitating. The elder beside him stepped forward instead, bowing. "We act on orders from the Imperial Preceptor’s estate. The details are beyond our knowledge..."

"Then shut up!" The Hanging Bird snapped. "None of your business. Want to become 'familiar' with Birdie?"

The Blood Swordmaster, about to speak, promptly sealed his lips, eyes fixed on his nose.

"The Gao Clan’s True Qi expert joined the court and was sent south. Soon after, you move to capture his kin. Why?" Li Zhengjing’s voice was cool. "We’re not friends, but I don’t mind making you 'familiar' if needed. There are plenty of officials in the capital—someone will talk."

Without even drawing his blade, he flicked a finger, releasing a wisp of True Qi—the Great Derivation Void-Transforming Sword Qi, sharp beyond compare.

That mere strand of energy sent a piercing pain through everyone present.

The commander glanced at the Hanging Bird. The Hall-Guarding Dragon Pillar, fused with twenty-five golden dragons, should rightfully belong to the court!

Yet Li Zhengjing had taken it from the capital and entrusted it to this bird. That meant even the Human Immortal generals, court deities, founding dukes, and the Imperial Preceptor dared not seize it from him.

Such a man would get his answers one way or another.

"Gao Xuan, third in the Gao Clan’s lineage, entered the Tianxing Cave Heaven," the commander said quietly. "A celestial star fell at Yan Pass Mountain, bordering the Southern Wastes, forming the cave heaven. The court dispatched a deity from the Southern Region, leading thirty True Qi experts and a thousand soldiers to investigate..."

He raised his head. "All of them died. Only Gao Xuan emerged alive. That same day, a Yu Hua Immortal Sect Elder tried to interrogate him—and was repelled in a single move."

His gaze shifted to the stunned Gao Clan members. "After leaving the cave heaven, Gao Xuan vanished. But in the past three days, over a hundred of his direct kin have been killed—turned to ash, their bloodlines erased. The culprit... is Gao Xuan himself."
