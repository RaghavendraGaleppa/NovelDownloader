Chapter 206: Reborn Through Blood

In the Secret Realm, a flowing mist of light, like the arrival of "dusk," draped the entire forest in a hazy veil, with dappled light and shadow.

Qin Ming sat still, circulating the Dragon-Snake Scripture. His body was bursting open piece by piece, a bloody mess, with crimson liquid staining him from head to toe. The sight was gruesome. He was like this from head to toe; even his otherwise handsome face was bloody, truly "lacerated all over."

"Brother!" Little Wu was extremely worried, wondering if this was due to practicing the Dragon-Snake Scripture or if the demon seed had become uncontrollable.

Xin Youdao, Jiang Ruoli, Liu Hanhya, and the others were also startled. He hadn't been injured in the previous battles, even slaying renowned young demon beasts from the plateau. Yet now, his situation was dire.

Qin Ming had become a "blood gourd." In places where his skin and flesh were thinner, such as his fingers, bone could even be seen through the wounds. The only reassuring thing was that the vitality within him hadn't diminished, and a faint dragon roar seemed to echo from within!

Moreover, his Skyglow Energy flowed ceaselessly and circulated rapidly, overflowing through his ruptured skin, like a scorching sun temporarily hidden in dark clouds. Around his body, a "divine halo" gradually formed. Despite his wounds, he exuded a sacred aura. Furthermore, within that mysterious halo, an image of dragons and snakes rising together was reflected, albeit very vaguely.

Qin Ming showed no sign of pain; his entire focus was on the Dragon-Snake Scripture, and he was gaining new insights. "From snake to dragon, it's like crossing an abyss, like walking from this shore to the other. The difficulty lies in its extreme nature, like shifting from extreme Yin to extreme Yang." He realized that the Dragon-Snake Scripture also contained elements of the Yin-Yang transformation he sought.

He had greatly coveted the Blight-Flourish Scripture because it involved evolution at such a profound level. Today, he captured a spark of inspiration from the scripture he himself possessed. No one expected that with his body in such a precarious state, he would still be comprehending the scripture's true meaning, genuinely astonishing Liu Hanhya, Gan Jincheng, and the others. They reflected that perhaps this was the difference between people, and why he could achieve such feats.

Qin Ming opened his eyes, looked at the people around him, and said, "All of you, leave this place. I sense a powerful team of demon beasts appearing in the distance." The fragmented demon seed within him had a strange resonance with the distance; other demon beasts who had received the "gift" were rapidly approaching.

Xiao Yaqin and the others wanted to say something, but Qin Ming waved his hand, "I don't need your help. If I unleash my full strength, you might end up holding me back." His "frankness" left Gan Jincheng, Liu Hanhya, and the others speechless. Had they become "burdens"? They were all geniuses, but their cultivation realms weren't high enough. Against those at the Second Realm with the potential to become demon seeds, their performance was indeed lacking.

"Brother, I'll help you, that's enough!" Little Wu said.

"Let me do this myself first!" Qin Ming said. Whether it was due to the mutual sensing and hostility of the fragmented demon seeds or a deeper understanding of the Dragon-Snake Scripture, he felt the need for a bloody battle with the distant demon beasts.

Jiang Ruoli spoke, "We'll guard from a distance. If it comes to a crucial moment and help is needed, we can intervene immediately."

Little Wu rubbed his hands, a little embarrassed, and said, "Um... everyone, although we've fought together and aren't strangers anymore, please swear an oath using a forbidden art." Looking "shy," he pulled out a certain forbidden technique from his homeland – the Fourth Despair – and asked them to swear an oath according to the ritual. "As you can see, my brother and I want to keep a low profile; we don't want to expose ourselves just yet!"

Gan Jincheng readily agreed, "Alright, no problem. We'll keep our shared ordeal in mind and won't speak carelessly!" Although the women felt a little uncomfortable, they all complied.

A moment later, the group looked at Qin Ming, their expressions changing. "Brother, are you alright?" Little Wu cried out in alarm. They found large areas of Qin Ming's flesh torn open, with skin peeling off, which was quite frightening. Even his face was cracking open; this was practically disfigurement. Furthermore, his scalp was cracking, and strands of hair were falling out. He was covered in blood, his condition worsening, utterly stained with gore.

"It's nothing, this is a necessary process for a snake transforming into a dragon!" Qin Ming said. He had shattered the demon seed with his scorching Sun-like Skyglow Energy, then circulated the Dragon-Snake Scripture to refine the essence of this "gift," encountering fierce resistance. His Dragon-Snake Scripture continuously circulated, evolving from its initial mastery to a constant upward progression, undergoing fundamental changes.

Soon, everyone realized that what Qin Ming was shedding was merely the old "scabs" and broken dead skin, like a great snake shedding its skin. This was the true meaning of the Dragon-Snake Scripture! He seemed to be undergoing a minor Nirvana, with parts of his body reborn. Then, people were shocked. In such a short time, his flesh glowed, full of vitality, and he was already healed. A dense layer of short hair had even grown on his head.

Qin Ming's body glowed, as if a divine sun was gestating within him, reflecting the wondrous sight of dragons and snakes rising together. The demon seed was torn apart by him, constantly ground down, turning into nourishment! Within his flesh, several dragon roars actually echoed. Everyone was dazed, witnessing with their own eyes such drastic changes happening to him in the shortest amount of time.

Qin Ming got up, stretched his limbs, and felt very good, ready for battle. Although some fragmented demon seed remnants hadn't been fully digested, they no longer had any immediate impact. Most importantly, the Dragon-Snake Scripture was now ready for practical combat!

"You are..." Xin Youdao, Jiang Ruoli, and the others saw his true appearance: a handsome young man they had never seen before.

Little Wu said, "Everyone, please supplement your oath with the forbidden art."

Qin Ming stood under the waterfall, washing off the bloodstains, then used Skyglow Energy to dry his clothes, ready to face the enemy!

In the distance, birds were startled, accompanied by screams. The demon beast team appeared, seemingly in a great hurry, running at high speed. "Fall back, all of you. If things go wrong, you can immediately flee far away!" Qin Ming said. He was very serious because the opponents were extremely strong.

This journey into the Secret Realm had far exceeded expectations; none of this should have happened. Several demon beast teams were stranded in the Secret Realm due to an accident. They fought and devoured each other, and ultimately, a true demon seed would be born, posing a fatal threat to the new disciples of Kunling Academy.

Gan Jincheng, Liu Hanhya, and the others entered the dense forest, watching closely. "Brother, I'll help you by watching the flanks!" Little Wu insisted on standing not far away.

Qin Ming nodded. At this moment, he had a profound realization: he needed to undergo a transformation through blood. "Flesh shattering, dragon scales forming, these are merely superficial manifestations," he murmured to himself. How could a snake transform into a dragon peacefully? This was inherently an "inverse journey," bound to face obstruction. He understood why the scripture recorded such a difficult and bloody transformation. It was because, in the unseen, there seemed to be rules; some trajectories were hard to break. A leap from mortal to higher ranks could never be smooth sailing; obstacles were bound to appear on the path ahead. At this critical juncture, there was no room for hesitation; he must fight with all his might!

Ahead, two people stumbled, fleeing towards them, but were quickly caught by a team. Those tall demon beasts were incredibly wild, stomping the ground to collapse it and cleaving through obstructive vines. Soon, both individuals were impaled by thick, long iron spears and hoisted up. Besides these two, three others had already been impaled and killed, bloody and dead for a long time.

"It's them! After escaping from that village, they encountered this demon beast team again!" Gan Jincheng clenched his fists. Two of them were members of his team. The five unfortunate souls ultimately could not escape death. Jiang Ruoli and Xiao Yaqin remained silent, but their faces showed anger. Some people they knew had also died there.

Ahead, the demon beast team emerged, numbering nineteen in total, all emanating killing intent. The leader was a silver-robed youth, very composed and cold, silently watching them. Several individuals beside him violently swung their iron spears, slamming the five impaled corpses onto the ground, crashing them against a huge rock. The young disciples from Kunling Academy instantly became mangled bodies, some with shattered heads, others torn into pieces, a gruesome sight!

"Only two of you? What a surprise!" The silver-robed youth looked over, then, treading on the bloodstains on the ground, led his people closer. He was tall, with a handsome face and an eerie, demonic aura. His body shimmered faintly with silver light, as if covered by a divine halo, and an oppressive aura could be felt even from a distance. Indeed, this team was even more terrifying.

Beside the silver-robed youth, some walked alongside him, clearly his trusted lieutenants. All were formidable; some were ferocious, others handsome. They intentionally retained some demonic features; although capable of shapeshifting into humans, they either chose not to or disdained doing so. One demon had a human body and the head of a golden elephant; even its tusks seemed forged from gold, and its pupils shimmered with golden light. Its human body was five meters tall, wielding a massive saber. On the other side was a white-haired youth with two jet-black bull horns on his head. Additionally, there was a flood-dragon-headed youth, a woman draped in peacock feather robes, and a maiden with two pairs of snow-white wings.

Qin Ming's expression was grim. This was a super lineup; the silver-robed youth at the head had five sworn brothers! Undoubtedly, the fragmented demon seeds resonated with each other, and the opponents were eager to hunt, which was why they had rushed here so frantically.

Little Wu stood in the distance, wanting to approach, but was stopped by Qin Ming. "'A great snake fiercely contends against the heavens, its body shattering, then growing horns and claws. Does it need to mutilate itself to transform? That's wrong!' Qin Ming mused, recalling the contents of the Dragon-Snake Scripture." How could blood and wounds be self-inflicted? His expression was resolute. A snake's transformation into a dragon had to occur amidst battle. True dragon transformation involved external struggle. Anyone who dared to intercept him was obstructing his path, requiring him to fight to the very end, to be reborn through tempering, and to transform from snake to dragon.

With a bang, the elephant demon stomped on a corpse's head on the ground, crushing it, and walked forward, saying, "Big Brother, let me gauge his strength first."

The flood-dragon-headed youth said, "Gauge what? Big Brother came for the fragmented demon seed. Let's finish this quickly to avoid attracting interference from other teams!"

The group rushed forward swiftly. Their only goal now was hunting; they had no desire to waste time. A strong scent of blood wafted from them. At this moment, Qin Ming wasted no words. He took out more than a dozen iron spears he had brought from the village and hurled them forward, one by one! Immediately, this area became filled with the sounds of wind and thunder.

Boom!

Wherever the iron spears passed, even a slight brush against branches would cause leaves and twigs to explode with a loud noise. The elephant's roar was deafening! The elephant demon swung its trunk like a long saber, batting away the iron spears. Without pause, it charged forward. The flood-dragon-headed youth likewise shook off the rapidly flying spears. Qin Ming assessed their cultivation levels, his expression instantly turning grave.

He hurled the other iron spears towards the demon beast servants behind, avoiding the most powerful demons. Pfft! A three-meter-tall demon beast was pierced through, dying instantly. With a bang, another tall demon beast was impaled, its entire body exploding. At this moment, the silver-robed youth and his sworn brothers acted simultaneously, each unleashing brilliant glowing energy to interfere with the trajectory of the iron spears.

Qin Ming abandoned the iron spears, took out his large silver bow, and drew a jade-iron arrow. The arrow, imbued with Skyglow, instantly streaked through the forest like lightning. With a 'pfft', a large chunk of flesh exploded from the elephant-headed youth's arm. "Moo!" The white-haired youth let out a bull roar, his pair of horns glowing. A piece of his left ear was missing, shredded by the extremely sharp jade-iron arrow that grazed it, enraging him. "Be careful, it's a pure jade-iron arrow, not a composite one!" Clearly, they had been careless, not realizing the unbelievable material of the arrow previously.

Bang! Bang! Behind, three more demon beast servants were consecutively struck in the forehead by arrows, unable to dodge. Their heads shattered like rotten watermelons on the spot, dying violent deaths. The silver-robed youth rushed to the very front, his body erupting with brilliant silver light, unfurling a light barrier. His sworn brothers did the same, their divine radiant energy surging to block the arrows. Their Skyglow Energy connected, and several of them advanced rapidly side-by-side.

Qin Ming's rapid-fire arrows, one after another, all shot towards the light barrier put up by the peacock woman, shattering it. A piece of her five-colored feathered robe exploded, blood appearing on her chest as the jade-iron arrow pierced in. However, at the last moment, spiritual light surged, and she forced the jade-iron arrow out, preventing it from piercing through her. During this process, no one in the demon beast team cried out or panicked, clearly possessing excellent psychological fortitude and having experienced various life-or-death battles. These were demon beasts of the Second Realm, possessing incredibly rich combat experience.

Qin Ming put away his bow and arrows. This time, he drew out the Mutton-Fat Jade-Iron Saber, which he hadn't used for a long time, showing how seriously he regarded this demon beast team. He was unwilling to waste Skyglow Energy to condense his Five-Colored Saber. He was ready for a bloody battle!

Over a dozen demon beasts arrived, advancing right before him, emanating astonishing killing intent, like a surging tide crashing forward. Qin Ming launched a proactive attack. The surrounding wilderness was covered in dense forest, and the Wood-elemental Qi was incredibly rich. Green mist steamed here, seeming to lift him forward, off the ground, as he swept through the air.

The elephant's roar was immense, making people's eardrums hum as if they would shatter. The elephant demon, whose arm was injured by the jade-iron arrow, was the first to act, swinging its massive saber to cleave down. Qin Ming focused his gaze. The snow-white blade in his hand shone brightly as he slashed forward. With a clang, he caused sparks to fly from the opponent's gigantic saber, breaking off its tip. He then flew horizontally, sweeping close and exchanging a palm strike with the giant elephant youth. With a bang, the elephant demon, whose human body was five meters tall, was actually shaken and staggered back several steps.

Qin Ming felt a chill. Just one elephant demon was like this, forcing him to be highly vigilant. He surged past, cutting through the strongest great demons. With a 'pfft', a demon beast servant behind him, though also in the Second Realm, simply couldn't compare to the great demons at the front. Qin Ming's saber light severed its weapon and lopped off its head. Instant kill! Then, his body moved like lightning, sweeping out and swinging his saber again, cleaving another Second Realm demon beast servant diagonally through the shoulder.

He charged in alone, directly piercing through the opponent's team, slaying two demons in quick succession. This immediately stirred the hearts of Gan Jincheng, Jiang Ruoli, and the others watching from the dense forest. How could such a young man remain unknown? When his true identity was revealed, it would surely shake all quarters.

The elephant demon's face turned ashen. The breach had been torn through his position, leading to the tragic deaths of two behind him. It immediately went berserk, golden runes appearing all over its body as it charged towards Qin Ming.

"Let me!" The silver-robed youth at the head spoke. Like a ghost in the night mist, he flashed forth, intercepting Qin Ming and engaging him in a lightning-fast exchange. At this moment, the fragmented demon seeds between the two surprisingly produced a wondrous resonance, continuously reverberating, eventually triggering a phenomenon.

A glowing path appeared, extending into the distance. Moreover, both saw that there were many other paths in the distance! On some paths, dilapidated temples stood, cicada chirps emanating from within. Some paths were paved with black and white stones, leading to a massive Eight Trigrams palace, while others seemed to connect to the clouds. Immediately, Qin Ming seemed to see the Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata, Li Qingyue, Cui Chonghe, and others in the distance! Then, he saw other small paths, discovering the traces of Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds like Su Shiyun, Zhao Yaoting, Leng Feiyue, and Tang Yutian, all on their respective paths, advancing and gathering towards a certain place deep within the Secret Realm. What surprised him most was that, in a trance, he saw the blurry phantom left behind by Sun Taichu, also on one of the paths.

"What did you see?" the silver-robed youth asked. He had seen the paths but couldn't make out the faces of those people.

Qin Ming didn't speak, merely stared at him. Both knew they needed to acquire the other's fragmented demon seed to embark on these paths! Then, the two began to fiercely exchange blows.

"Surround him!" a demon beast shouted from the side.

"You are human, yet you dare to seize my race's path?!" the silver-robed youth roared, having realized his true identity was not that of a demon beast.

"Every path leads to that mysterious place. What's wrong with borrowing a path?" Qin Ming replied.
