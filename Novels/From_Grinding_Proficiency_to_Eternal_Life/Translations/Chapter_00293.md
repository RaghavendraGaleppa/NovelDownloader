# Chapter 293: Little Daoer

“Is that the outcast from the Heavenly Work Cave? I heard he wasn't good enough for Master Bi Sheng back then. How did he get taken in by the Sect Master as soon as he came to the Dao Sect?”

“Haven't you heard? Master Bi Sheng got a good scolding from the Sect Master.”

“Shh! Don't you see the Xuantian Order hanging at his waist? A通行符 personally bestowed by the Sect Master!”

A disciple gloated, “Master Bi Sheng is in for a rough time! If he had taken him as a disciple back then, the Sect Master wouldn't have had to pay such a heavy price to keep him now.”

“Keep it down, Master Bi Sheng is very petty. If this gets to his ears, you'll be in big trouble.”

Xu Yunfan's ears twitched slightly, catching all the whispers. Hearing that Bi Sheng had been thoroughly scolded by the Sect Master, the corner of his mouth couldn't help but curl up slightly.

*Old fool, serves you right for being blind back then.*

He squinted and looked towards the high platform. There sat the heads of the twelve peaks. Li Zhi was stroking his wooden sword, his gaze cold as he looked at Yunfan. Chu Cangmiao stood alone by the corner of the eaves in his white robes, seemingly one with the snow-filled sky. He held his long sword crossed before his chest, his eyes slightly closed as if conserving his energy.

*Boom!*

The bronze bell's chime shattered the frosty mist.

The head of the Punishment Hall, Cui Yu, slapped his withered palm onto the "Mountain Suppressing Stone" above the arena, his voice like grinding metal. “The challenge begins! The Thirty-Six Linked Arenas are now open!”

Cui Yu withdrew his emaciated hand from the Mountain Suppressing Stone. As his sleeves billowed, his gaze first swept over Bi Yuan in the center of the high platform.

The Sect Master, clad in a black Daoist robe, had a calm and profound expression. He met Cui Yu's gaze and gave a slight nod, saying nothing.

This Thirty-Six Linked Arena was set up specifically for Xu Yunfan. By reason and sentiment, it was not appropriate for him to say anything more. He would simply act as a spectator.

*Yunfan, Yunfan, let me see just how much you've been hiding.*

Although he knew exactly what martial arts Xu Yunfan had learned, it was still somewhat unclear just what level he had reached in those arts and what depths he had touched.

Setting up this arena was also a consideration in Bi Yuan's heart.

If he was too weak when the time came to resist the Heavenly Demons, he might become a burden. In that case, he wouldn't be worth cultivating.

*Reaching the Marrow Cleansing realm in just two years...*

Bi Yuan sighed inwardly. He had already sent people to confirm this with the Dao Sect's connections more than ten times.

Such a speed was something that only the ancient sages of two thousand years ago could achieve.

Receiving the signal, Cui Yu then turned to Xu Yunfan below the stage. His hoarse voice cut through the wind and snow. “Xu Yunfan, ascend the stage.”

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath. Under the gaze of countless eyes, the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace spun in his palm, the dark red patterns on its shaft flowing like molten lava.

He tapped his toes, and his figure shot up like a falcon, landing steadily on the black stone slab in the center of the arena. His expression was calm, merely glancing at the snow on the platform.

The snow had been falling for three days and had yet to stop. It had already covered the arena on the Profound Sky Peak to a depth of three feet.

He slightly channeled his energy into his feet, instantly pushing the surrounding snow away to reveal a circular black platform around him.

The disciples of the thirty-six peaks below immediately stirred, their whispers spreading like a tide.

“He doesn't look that handsome, not even close to Senior Brother Chu. How is he worthy of challenging our sect's forbidden ground?”

“I heard he just entered the Marrow Cleansing realm, and he dares to accept the Thirty-Six Linked Arena challenge? The heirs of each peak have been immersed in the Marrow Cleansing realm for years, and even the heirs of the first few peaks have entered the Organ Refining realm. Who on earth gave him such courage?!”

“The Sword Burial Abyss hasn't opened in thirty years. Even the true disciples of each peak have to wait another ten years for a chance. Why should an exception be made for him?!”

The disciples below whispered, their tones filled with indignation.

Cui Yu paid no attention to the clamor. He raised his emaciated finger and pointed to the ancient bronze bell hanging at the edge of the arena. His voice was hoarse, like the clash of metal. “Heirs of the thirty-six peaks, if anyone is not convinced, they may ring the bell for a challenge. Winning one match counts as the recognition of one peak. If no one comes to the stage, it will be considered a forfeit.”

As soon as he finished, the Vice-Sect Master, Shen Wuya, who had been standing silently beside Bi Yuan on the high platform, suddenly spoke. His voice was as cold as frost. “Since everyone is so concerned about the qualification for the Sword Burial Abyss, then I shall add a prize…”

He swept his sleeve, and an ancient jade order appeared in his palm. It was carved with the words “Sword Burial,” and a sharp sword intent faintly emanated from it.

“Whoever can be the last one standing on this arena will receive this qualification for the Sword Burial Abyss from me.”

With these words, the heirs of the various peaks, who had been relatively calm, instantly boiled over!

“The qualification for the Sword Burial Abyss?!”

“Vice-Sect Master Shen is actually willing to part with it?!”

A commotion erupted below, and countless fiery gazes fixed on that jade order.

Bi Yuan's eyes flickered. He turned his head to look at Shen Wuya, a profound light flashing in his eyes.

Shen Wuya met his gaze with a faint, meaningful smile, his tone leisurely. “Sect Master Bi, adding a prize shouldn't be a problem, right?”

Bi Yuan was silent for a moment, then suddenly a meaningful smile appeared on his lips. He then said in a loud voice, “Yunfan, if you win this, the qualification bestowed by the Vice-Sect Master will allow you to choose two divine weapons!”

Hearing this, the corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth curled up. He cupped his fists towards Shen Wuya from afar and said loudly, “Many thanks for the generous gift, Vice-Sect Master!”

Shen Wuya's gaze was deep. He gave a faint smile and said no more.

Below, the eyes of the various heirs burned with fighting spirit. The arena, which was originally meant to test Xu Yunfan's depth, had now become a battle for the qualification to the Sword Burial Abyss. Who would be willing to fall behind?

The Sect Master's words were one thing, but who would win and who would lose was still unknown.

Before the words had fully faded, a cold laugh suddenly rang out from the northwest corner.

“Zhao Wujiu of the Yutuo Peak requests guidance from Senior Brother Xu!”

He raised his hand, and a small stone shot out from his toes, striking the ancient bronze bell. In the lingering sound of the bell, a black shadow shot out like a venomous snake, the cold blue glint of his twin daggers tearing through the snow.

Before his figure even arrived, the dagger wind had already brought a piercing chill, aiming straight for Xu Yunfan's throat.

Xu Yunfan was already prepared. The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace was held horizontally across his chest. The shaft collided with the dagger blades, sparking a shower of sparks.

Zhao Wujiu used the force to flip in mid-air, a sinister smile on his face. “I heard Senior Brother Xu is exceptionally skilled with the hammer? Why not use it?”

“Whoever told you that, I am skilled with the mace.”

At the very least, he was a master at the Small Success stage of the Marrow Cleansing realm. Among the thirty-six peaks of the Dao Sect, just the heirs alone could be thirty-six Marrow Cleansing masters.

*When did they become so common?*

Xu Yunfan's eyes darkened. The Pure Yang Qi Technique inside him surged instantly, and the three strands of Pure Yang True Qi that had been transformed surged through his body. Then, one strand of true energy poured from his palm into the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace.

In an instant, the crimson patterns on the mace's shaft shone brightly, like a fire dragon awakening.

Xu Yunfan's foot stamped on the black stone, producing a sound like the grinding of metal. His figure shot up violently like a savage dragon, the muscles all over his body bulging and twisting. The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace, shrouded in a scorching gale, slashed down with overwhelming force.

This move, the Eight Wastes Collapse Mountain, was pushed to its extreme. Before the mace even arrived, the ferocious pressure had already pulverized the snow within a three-foot radius into dust. The mace's momentum was like a meteor falling to the earth, and the air was squeezed into visible ripples.

Zhao Wujiu's pupils shrank violently. The moment his twin daggers crossed to block, the cold blue venomous light was actually suppressed and extinguished by the golden light of the crimson mace.

The black stone slab beneath his feet, a special material of the Dao Sect with a dark golden hue, collapsed inward with a thunderous crash by half an inch.
