# Chapter 435: The Country Bumpkin Enters the City

The split flames struggled to reunite for a long time, creating a strange vacuum zone.

"Take it."

Xu Yunfan looked at his master's stiff back. "This is my disciple's Foundation Establishment gift."

Zhan Yan's single eye suddenly turned red.

He recognized this forging technique; it was clearly his unique "Seven-Fold Forging Method," but it had been forcibly elevated to an unimaginable level by True Martial Evil Qi.

This method had been included in the Heavenly Work Forging Technique, which was time-consuming and labor-intensive. Yet, Xu Yunfan had formed it with just a few hammer strikes.

Xu Yunfan smiled. "Back then, for the sake of forging a Thunderfire Qilin Hammer for me, you didn't even leave the Earthfire Furnace to eat or drink. This disciple will never forget that."

Zhan Yan's calloused fingers stroked the star patterns on the sword's spine, his eyes reflecting the jumping green light.

"Master, come with me to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World."

Xu Yunfan's fingertips gently stroked the sword's spine. The eighth-grade divine weapon emitted a docile hum beneath his palm. "With your talent in forging artifacts, coupled with the spiritual energy of the upper world..."

"No."

Zhan Yan interrupted him cleanly and decisively.

Xu Yunfan was slightly stunned. "Why?"

He had thought Zhan Yan would agree readily, but he didn't expect the man to refuse just as readily.

Zhan Yan's rough fingers stroked the dents on the edge of the forging platform, lost in thought. "In this life, there are only three things I can't let go of: the Earthfire in the Heavenly Work Cave, the iron tongs on the wall..." He suddenly grabbed a forging hammer and smashed it onto the anvil. "And the melody of the iron胚 singing!"

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but say, "If you go, you might still be able to attain the fruit of the long life path..."

"Long life?"

When he heard the words "fruit of the long life path," the old man suddenly grinned, revealing a broken canine tooth. "Brat, do you think everyone covets becoming an immortal?"

He turned and plunged the eighth-grade divine sword into the bluestone beside the forging platform. The blade sank three inches deep, emitting a sound of clanging metal. This forging platform, refined by a thousand years of Earthfire, had long become an existence not inferior to a sixth-grade treasure artifact.

"See that broken sword over there?"

Zhan Yan pointed to a half截 rusted iron piece in the corner. "The first sword you forged five years ago. It broke in two because the quenching was too rushed."

The rough index finger traced the cracks on the blade. "But the direction of these cracks clearly shows it was a good piece of material."

Xu Yunfan was stunned.

He had long forgotten that scrap iron; he never expected his master to have kept it until now.

"Forging iron and cultivating immortality are originally the same thing."

The firelight in Zhan Yan's single eye was even more scorching than the Earthfire. "You seek long life in the Taihua World, while I seek..."

The hammer head smashed heavily onto the anvil.

"Clang!"

"The melody the iron胚 sings with every hammer strike!"

"Master..."

"That's enough. In my lifetime, to have produced a disciple like you is already a blessing from heaven. Now, I just want to guard the legacy left behind by the Divine Weapon Ridge!"

Xu Yunfan fell silent and did not try to persuade him further.

Zhan Yan had a stubborn personality; once he made a decision, not even ten oxen could pull him back.

At the hour of Chen (7-9 am) three days later, twelve figures appeared one after another amidst the roiling mountain mist. The leader, an old man in a purple robe named Xué Zhēn, had chains clanking all over his body, leaving scorched footprints on the rocks with every step.

"Daoist Master Xu."

Xu Zhēn's hoarse voice carried suppressed excitement. "We have already entrusted our sects to our disciples and have no lingering worldly affairs..."

Although Xu Yunfan was a disciple of the Dao Sect, these people were clear-headed enough to know their place.

Xu Yunfan suddenly looked up towards the direction of the Heavenly Work Cave. His Foundation Establishment divine sense pierced through the rock, clearly "seeing" the mountain-like old man swinging his hammer onto the anvil. The arc of the flying sparks was exactly the same as when he had taught him to forge weapons.

"Ding!"

The clear sound of the hammer striking the sword blank drifted along the mountain wind, and in Xu Yunfan's ears, it was even more heart-shaking than the ancient bells of the Dao Sect.

The sound of forging iron from the Casting Hall suddenly quickened and then slowed. Xu Yunfan understood that his master was seeing him off in the unique way of a blacksmith, just like every time he went down the mountain for training back then, the old man would always deliberately make the forging sounds extra loud.

Black Tortoise cloud patterns flowed beneath his feet, but Xu Yunfan did not form the hand seal to activate his escape technique for a long time.

He suddenly lifted the hem of his Daoist robe and performed a standard disciple's salute in the direction of the Casting Hall.

This action made the twelve old monsters behind him exchange glances.

Such a person who respected the Dao so much couldn't be that bad.

Bi Yuan, standing to the side, also stroked his beard and sighed with emotion.

Zhan Yan had really found a good disciple.

Then he couldn't help but得意ly curl up a smile.

His eyes were not bad either.

When he straightened up, star patterns swirled in Xu Yunfan's eyes, and all emotions were suppressed deep within. He raised his hand and flicked it. The moment the Realm-Breaking Talisman left his hand, it burst into brilliance.

"Break the Realm!"

Before the twelve old monsters could react, they felt the world turn upside down. When they opened their eyes again, they were already standing above a sea of clouds.

This place was still the Realm Gate area and not suitable for staying long. Xu Yunfan's sleeves swept out, and True Martial power surged forth like a tide, condensing Black Tortoise cloud patterns around the twelve old monsters.

The residual spiritual light of the Realm-Breaking Talisman had not yet dissipated when the group shot across the sky of the Taihua World like meteors.

"Steady yourselves."

With Xu Yunfan's light shout, everyone felt their feet land on solid ground.

Bi Yuan stumbled half a step, his black Daoist robe billowing violently against the oncoming spiritual energy.

This wasn't just air?

It was clearly liquefied essence of heaven and earth!

Every breath felt like swallowing an entire spiritual vein. The meridians, which had been depleted for three hundred years, let out thirsty groans.

"Master."

As Xu Yunfan cupped his fists, the Concealed Star and Obscured Moon Array on True Martial Peak悄然 operated.

"This place is True Martial Peak."

Bi Yuan's response got stuck in his throat.

The Sect Master of the Dao Sect was now like a novice entering a martial arena; every pore was frantically devouring spiritual energy.

His Profound Art was operating so fast on its own that tiny whirlwinds were forming on the surface of his skin.

Under the nourishment of the spiritual energy, those hidden injuries accumulated over a century were healing at a visible speed!

"Good... good..."

The old Taoist's voice was ethereal, with spiritual dew condensing on his beard.

He tried to take a step, but his boot soles were entangled with emerald spiritual vines. This was a strange phenomenon caused by the excessive richness of Earth Element Essence.

A dull "thud" came from behind. The old man with the clay shell knelt directly on the ground, frantically digging open the surface layer of spiritual soil, burying his face in the dirt like a starving ghost.

Xu Yunfan's sword finger lightly划过, and twelve streaks of green light sank into everyone's foreheads. "The restrictions within the peak have been temporarily lifted for you all."

His gaze swept over Xué Zhēn, who was shedding his skin. "But do not walk out of the range of this peak... After all, this place belongs to the Yuan Demon Sect. You are still just mortals. If someone were to capture you as raw materials for refinement, I would have no choice but to kill to vent my anger..."

He suddenly grabbed a black shadow of incense smoke that wanted to rush into the clouds. "Especially you, Great-Grandmaster."

"This... this is..."

Xu Zhēn's Adam's apple bobbed. The blood pill under his purple robe suddenly trembled violently.

The *Withering and Flourishing Art* he had cultivated for two hundred years operated on its own. A large amount of pure spiritual energy from heaven and earth poured into his withered skin, and then his entire body swelled up at a visible speed.

What was even more terrifying was the black iron chains piercing his major acupoints. Now, they were being slowly pushed out of his body by some invisible force!

These chains that locked away his vitality were no longer needed.

The Green Mist Old Crone suddenly let out a啸 cry like a sword.

The bronze giant sword on her back shattered inch by inch, revealing a lustrous, jade-like sword bone inside. The sword bone, like a snake, actually钻入 her spine, merging into one. This made Xu Yunfan's eyebrows jump slightly.

Some demonic path methods...

(It's so hot, so hot, so hot!!!)
