# Chapter 218: The Black Pavilion Is Extremely Lively

The Black Pavilion was completely silent.

In the darkness, everyone’s gaze converged, but no one spoke.

Xiao Li even suspected that the place was called the Black Pavilion simply because they didn’t like to light lamps. It was so pitch-black that one could barely see people.

Was it because they were poor, or did they think it created a better atmosphere?

To prevent assassins with poor eyesight from making a mistake, Xiao Li kindly took out a Night Pearl.

“Is that really Li Mo?”

“He came to the Black Pavilion? How dare he?”

“This is a bit disrespectful to our profession. What’s the difference between this and jumping straight into the yamen?”

The assassins in the Black Pavilion had various expressions, exchanging glances with one another.

Even the old man with the birthmark at the front desk scratched the back of his head in confusion.

In all his years of business, this was the first time he had seen a target with such a high bounty voluntarily walk in to get caught.

The Night Pearl illuminated Li Mo’s face, and whispers began to rise.

“He seems quite rich. Why don’t we kill him here, get the bounty, and also rob him of his财物?”

“Fighting is not allowed inside the Black Pavilion.”

“Why did they set such a rule?”

“Guess why we are called the Drizzle Pavilion and not the Black Wind Stronghold.”

“He has to leave the pavilion eventually, right? He can’t hide inside forever.”

“I’m just saying, is there a possibility that he brought a powerful destructive treasure and came here to self-destruct?”

.........

Someone said this, and it broke the cold sweat on the steward at the counter.

For Li Mo to appear here, he was either hopelessly stupid or had the confidence to come here.

The nineteenth on the Hidden Dragon List was clearly not the former.

“Greetings, Young Hero Li. May I ask what brings you here?”

The steward signaled to the person next to him with his eyes, then took the initiative to ask.

“‘Guidance’ is too strong a word.”

Li Mo walked to the counter, sat on the chair, and smiled: “When a customer arrives, you don’t even serve tea. That is somewhat lacking in etiquette.”

Xu Yi: “.....”

He suddenly felt that his past experiences of licking blood from the blade and hanging by a thread were completely underwhelming.

The green-faced steward paused for a moment, squinting his eyes: “When did you become a customer?”

“The Drizzle Pavilion operates without taboos, correct?”

Li Mo didn’t avoid the sharp gaze in the other party’s eyes.

The green-faced steward nodded: “Aside from the rules of the pavilion, that is naturally the case.”

“Then that means the person who has a bounty on their head can also place an order, right?”

Li Mo had already read the bounty list behind the counter.

There were plenty of examples of mutual bounties. For instance, Zhang Three puts a bounty on Li Four, and Li Four puts a bounty back.

“Correct.”

The green-faced steward thought for a moment and did not deny it.

After all, for the Drizzle Pavilion, who they kill isn’t important; how much money the other party can offer is what matters.

However, placing a bounty on the other party does not eliminate one’s own bounty. At most, it’s just getting revenge.

“Then, since I came to do business with you, I am naturally a customer. I want to place a bounty on the people who want to kill me.”

“Who do you want to put a bounty on? The Holy Maiden?”

The green-faced steward seemed to have heard something funny.

Laughter and cold sneers erupted from the Black Pavilion.

A bounty on the Holy Maiden?

Even if the steward dared to post it, would anyone dare to accept it?

“What’s the fun in putting a bounty on a Divine Sea Realm cultivator? I have a big business here.”

Xiao Li’s performative personality took over, and his aura was quite imposing: “I want to put a bounty on everyone who wants to kill me.”

“In short, whoever accepts the bounty to kill me, I will put a bounty on them.”

The green-faced steward opposite opened his mouth, his eyes confused.

Huh?

He heard such an outrageous bounty for the first time.

When these words were spoken, the brains of all the assassins in the Black Pavilion experienced a brief one-second crash.

“Is this possible?”

“Hiss... my head is a bit itchy.”

The assassins huddled together to discuss. After carefully checking the rules of the Drizzle Pavilion, they came to a conclusion.

It actually is possible.

But something feels off.

Are you coming here to hire bodyguards?

---

However, it was possible, but there was no precedent for it.

Because the money wasn’t enough.

The green-faced steward also discovered this. He smiled and brought over an abacus, clacking it loudly:

“Putting a bounty on an Internal Breath Realm cultivator costs anywhere from a thousand silver taels to ten thousand gold taels on average.”

“Putting a bounty on an ordinary Divine Sea Realm cultivator, the pavilion’s average price is five thousand to fifty thousand gold taels. Of course, this excludes geniuses on the Hidden Dragon List like Young Hero Li.”

“Putting a bounty on an Inner Scene Realm is expensive. It starts at a hundred thousand gold taels, plus strange treasures, before an assassin is willing to accept the order.”

“As for the Outer Scene Realm... hehe, Young Hero Li is probably...”

There were more than one person who accepted Li Mo’s bounty.

“Alright, stop calculating. I’ll give you a number.”

Li Mo held up five fingers: “Five times the market price.”

“You can’t afford—”

*Slap—*

A promissory note from the Hengtong Commerce House was slapped onto the table.

The green-faced steward frowned and read it:

“Party A, Young Hero Li, has deposited a golden mountain in our bank... what kind of unit is this... plus thirty boxes of strange treasures... a hundred pieces of玄晶...”

“The esteemed pavilion may regularly come to our bank to withdraw the deposited assets with this certificate...”

“—Written by Sun Gui.”

*Thump—*

The green-faced steward’s knees went weak.

He sent a fast runner to the Hengtong Commerce House.

After the person returned and whispered in his ear, the steward’s mouth twitched, forcing out an ugly smile:

“Young Hero Li, would you like Longjing or Da Hong Pao?”

The first business cooperation in the history of the Drizzle Pavilion began.

Xiao Li’s bounty was posted in the highest position, becoming the number one on the Drizzle Pavilion’s Yunnan branch’s leaderboard.

......

The news spread like the wind, and nearby assassins rushed to the Black Pavilion.

But for a moment, no one dared to step forward and accept the order.

After all, accepting the order meant challenging the Holy Maiden.

Although who accepted which bounty was a secret, no one dared to be the first to stand out.

They were truly envious, though.

“Damn Holy Maiden. Giving her face by calling her Holy Maiden. How much silver is her face worth?”

A cold, female voice attracted the attention of all assassins.

“Holy Maiden this, Holy Maiden that. If we really have trouble, can the Holy Maiden help?”

“That’s true. We aren’t a sect.”

“That makes sense...”

The assassins were tempted.

She walked to the table and slapped the “Hall Front Swallow” token onto the table: “Since we’ve all joined the Drizzle Pavilion, why are we still looking at others’ faces? Wouldn’t joining the Drizzle Pavilion be in vain?”

“I’ll accept this order first!”

As she spoke, the aura of the “Pure Passerby” Shang Wu was no longer concealed, instantly pouring out.

Inner Scene Realm!

“That makes sense!”

“I’m in too!”

The “Pure Passerby” Qian Bufan also stepped forward.

Also Inner Scene Realm!

“Those who hesitate and look back and forth cannot achieve great things.”

A rather cold female assassin also walked to Li Mo’s side.

It seemed she was going to protect him closely from now on.

Although her realm couldn’t be seen, the meaning could be felt from her cold, unfriendly gaze.

Whoever comes, dies.

She was definitely a ruthless person.

“Hehe, you have courage.”

Li Mo slapped the table and stood up: “I, Li, admire those with great courage. Please accept this small gift.”

He directly took out a few pieces of玄晶 and stuffed them into the female assassin’s hands.

Thus, more “Pure Passerby” joined.

There was a dwarf assassin, a gloomy assassin who looked full of bad ideas, and an Inner Scene Poison Master carrying various bottles and jars, smelling of elixirs, clearly skilled in using poison.

As is well known.

People have a herd mentality, and assassins are no exception.

Seeing so many people accept, even if the Holy Maiden wants to settle accounts later, she wouldn’t be able to find out who did it.

For a moment, the counter was packed.

The scene was extremely lively, with a bit of the vibe of old ladies rushing to the supermarket to grab eggs.
