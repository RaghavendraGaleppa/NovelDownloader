# Chapter 322: The Foul Robe Emerges, Chaos Reverses Yin and Yang; The Flower Cage's New Prodigy Once Again Makes a Foul Name

Inside the cocoon, there was no sense of day or night, only silence and solitude. Li Xian waited for a long time. Hearing no movement, he frowned slightly and got up to wander around. The interior of the pavilion was neatly furnished and comfortable to live in. Although wrapped by the giant cocoon, it was not chaotic.

Bored, Li Xian rummaged through the books and read them carefully. Wen Caishang had a vast collection of miscellaneous books, covering various esoteric fields: Five Elements, puppets, strange artifacts, architecture, geomancy, alchemy, astrology, medicine, toxicology, southern witchcraft... Most were stored in the manor. Naturally, they were hard to find here, but she was erudite and always found ways to obtain books to study whenever she stayed in a place.

Although she had lived in the Blue Fragrance Pavilion for a short time, she had already stored many books. The bookshelves stood over a meter high, stacked neatly.

Most of them were books like the *Book of Songs* and collections of calligraphy and paintings. Li Xian had a studious nature, so he looked for the *Book of Songs* to read, found paintings to admire, and unfolded calligraphy copies to practice.

Time passed in this way. Li Xian still heard no movement and found it very strange: "Is a day this long? It feels as if I have lived through two or three days. Could it be that within this silkworm cocoon, the evolution of martial arts is endless, making one perceive time more slowly?"

Since Li Xian held the trump card of the "Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword," he no longer had any worries. It was up to him to take action. He continued reading, writing, painting... practicing martial arts, and cultivating the Golden Light Technique. The Golden Light Technique consumed a great deal of energy. Li Xian never practiced to the point of exhaustion. When he felt slightly fatigued, he switched to practicing the "Wind Breathing Technique."

His breathing was long and deep.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Wind Breathing Technique\]

\[Proficiency: 12/3000 (Great Completion)\]

\[Description: Breathing with the wind, life ceaselessly generates. It can exhale a gale when advancing and store energy when retreating. Externally, it can drive away disease and evil; internally, it can strengthen the body.\]

The Wind Breathing Technique was only a basic martial art, but it had a great connection with the "Nangong Family's Avoiding Jade True Art," making it quite mystical. It had no stances or forms, focusing purely on adjusting one's breath. As long as a single breath remained, one could circulate energy, making it useful in many situations.

\[Path of Arts · Golden Light\]

\[Proficiency: 3/100\]

\[Bone Shaping Clay Embryo\]

\[Proficiency: 7/100\]

While practicing martial arts, he sensed the heavens and earth, and digested the essence. His realm gradually increased. The essence of heaven and earth was digested into his bones, transforming his bone quality. A martial artist's body is like a microcosm of the universe. The First Realm of the martial path is like the separation of chaos. In the Second Realm, the turbid energy sinks, transforming the bones, like mountains rising between heaven and earth, making it even more majestic.

The essence of heaven and earth within his body was over nine hundred strands, condensed and not dispersed, not fleeing or darting, quietly waiting to be digested. In recent days, thanks to the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword, the outer swords combined in form and the inner swords combined in emotion, the essence was digested very quickly, and progress was very gratifying.

Li Xian contemplated the path ahead in martial arts: "Martial combat strength is not determined by realm alone. I have acquired the Path of Arts · Golden Light. Even if I encounter a Third Realm martial artist, I might be able to hold my own with it. Now, the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword has stepped into the Great Self Realm, and my strength has greatly improved. Since I started drinking essence treasures through martial arts, I have never boiled the cauldron myself. I mostly relied on others or drank Human Yellow essence treasures."

"My understanding of martial arts has grown recently. Every time my realm advances by one percent, I need to digest over two hundred strands of essence. Relying solely on a single Human Yellow essence treasure, the progress of the martial path is ultimately limited. I eventually need to boil the cauldron myself and cook the essence meat. Thanks to the Benefit of Consumption, my demand for resources is already much less than others."

In this quiet and secluded space, more time passed. Finally, without Wen Caishang coming to find him, Li Xian could not help but speculate and his mind turned. He wondered if Wen Caishang intended to force him to gouge out his eyes before letting him out. Yet, it didn't seem like it. Although Wen Caishang was no gentleman, since she said one day, she would surely only give one day. She knew Li Xian was cunning and would not allow him to delay. If he came up with another trick, it would inevitably cause more trouble.

Li Xian's eyes flashed with light: "Could it be that something else happened in the outside world, causing Madam Wen to be delayed, leaving me here for the time being, with no time to attend to me?" The pavilion had a pool and pastries... It was fine to stay here for a long time. The silkworm cocoon was a cage, immune to water and fire, safe and secure.

Li Xian's mind was active. He explored the surroundings again. The cocoon pavilion was like a prison, still solid. He suddenly had a strange thought: "This cocoon pavilion looks like messy silkworm threads, but in reality, there is reason in all of it. Madam's seal technique seems to secretly match the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams are infinitely profound, hiding all things in heaven and earth. Qian is heaven, Kun is earth, Xun is wind, Zhen is thunder..."

Having experienced many things, he gradually understood the principles of the world. While cultivating at the Flower Cage Sect, he had learned from good teachers and friends and had grasped the essentials of the Five Elements and the Eight Trigrams. In this situation, calming his mind naturally put this knowledge to use. He walked around the pavilion according to his conjectures, combining with the power of his double pupils to observe the direction of the silkworm threads and the traces of the trigrams.

His eyes were bright as he murmured: "Madam's martial arts are profound, her realm immeasurable. For me to break her stance is surely a fantasy. But this siege situation follows the principles of the Eight Trigrams. If I use the Chaos of Yin and Yang to disrupt the Eight Trigrams, combined with the Golden Light Technique, I might have a chance to escape!"

Li Xian immediately tried to put it into practice. He executed the "Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword," attempting to disrupt the yin and yang within the cocoon. This move, the "Eight Extremes Seal," seals heaven, earth, wind, water... It is an extremely powerful trapping technique. But among all things in heaven and earth, there is a principle of mutual generation and restraint. Martial arts are derived from heaven and earth, so naturally, there are martial arts that counter them.

The Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword contains the "principle of yin and yang." When executed within the cocoon, it generates yin and yang, which can indeed stir up the trapped situation. However, Li Xian's realm was still shallow, and the evolution of his martial arts was insufficient. To rely solely on the yin and yang in the sword to reverse the Eight Extremes trap of the cocoon was absolutely impossible.

But it was enough to cause a momentary disturbance. It made the martial arts evolution contained in the cocoon stagnate for a moment. With the addition of the "Golden Light Technique" for escape, there was a slim chance. After several such attempts, he indeed saw results. The golden light seeped into the cocoon, going deeper by an inch.

However, Wen Caishang's methods were superior. The Eight Trigrams in the cocoon were as stable as iron. Although they were disturbed for a moment, they recovered instantly. The silkworm threads were tightly woven, interconnected deeply. Li Xian's clever strategy was indeed useful, but due to the disparity in strength, it ultimately fell short by several degrees.

Li Xian felt utterly helpless. A fierce intent surged in his heart. If he could ever practice the third level of the sword technique again, he would make Wen Caishang show utter embarrassment, begging for mercy, and display his full masculine prowess. He sighed slightly: "This plan still won't work. I must think again, what other means can help me escape."

Suddenly, another brilliant idea came to him. He pondered: "This move... perhaps it could work. I am at the end of my rope, so there is no harm in trying recklessly. Before that, I should rest for a bit." He had tried various things and was running low on energy. He went to the bathing pool to drink some water, then picked up a pastry to fill his stomach.

Li Xian used his long sword to lift the water. No matter how he chopped or probed, the water did not splash. It was the "Eight Extremes Seal" sealing heaven and earth, and also sealing water and fire. The bathing pool had its water property sealed, naturally losing its flowing nature. Li Xian marveled even more that martial arts evolution could reach such a realm. In the past, a single sword breaking a boat, though magnificent and sharp, compared to the "Eight Extremes Seal," it lacked a bit of mystery.

He lay on the ground to drink. The water had lost its sweetness, and the pastries had lost their taste. But his energy was replenished, and his condition returned to its peak. Li Xian walked to the main entrance and executed the "Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword" to disrupt its yin and yang. He evolved the sword stance to the extreme. In the pavilion, it seemed as if a setting sun was rising, scorching like fire.

In the cage that sealed heaven, earth, water, and fire, the principle of yin and yang appeared.

His sword followed his heart, dancing rapidly and releasing slowly, striking out sharply and withdrawing gently. It possessed its own unique charm. The Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword was created by the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple. Li Xian had already broken free from the shackles of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple, and his attainment in this path was even greater than his predecessors.

The sword stance was elegant and unrestrained, brewing the meaning of yang. It stirred the Eight Trigrams principle of the cocoon into chaos for a moment. Li Xian saw the opportunity, narrowed his eyes slightly, and donned the "Ghostly Foul Robe."

Suddenly, yin energy rose sharply, and ghostly aura thickened. It was as if the ghost realm had descended, an indescribable ferocity. Li Xian, clad in the Foul Robe, was shrouded in black mist, mysterious and unfathomable. The cocoon instantly became a scene of ten thousand ghosts rejoicing, with the Ghost Gate wide open.

Flowers and grass withered, pastries decayed, clear water turned into the Yellow Spring...

The cocoon trembled violently, as if suffering a great blow. Li Xian executed the "Golden Light Technique" again, rushing out of the cocoon in an instant. The golden light gathered, and Li Xian was already outside the cocoon. The Ghostly Foul Robe dissipated.

It turned out... although the Eight Extremes Seal was extremely powerful, upon touching the "Ghostly Foul Robe," it faced the danger of collapsing instantly! The Ghostly Foul Robe was a garment from outside the world. It did not belong to the Five Elements, did not enter the Eight Trigrams, did not involve Yin and Yang, and was outside the principles of the world. This robe was unfathomable. Once it appeared, it disturbed the yin and yang, the Eight Trigrams, and the Five Elements around the body... causing the sky and earth to darken, water to flow backward, and mountains to hang upside down...

It perfectly restrained the Eight Extremes Seal. If Wen Caishang had used binding techniques to tie Li Xian to the ground, making it impossible to move his hands and feet, even if Li Xian executed the "Ghostly Foul Robe," he would have no hope of escape. But the Eight Extremes Seal involved the Eight Trigrams.

Li Xian looked at the giant cocoon behind him and felt secretly amazed: "It's hard to imagine that such a giant cocoon could form in an instant. Madam treats me quite well. Although I have escaped the cocoon, I must still be extremely careful. If I encounter Madam, it would be a great trouble." He immediately fled, seeing the light of day again. The breeze blew, and the sun was bright, and he felt a great sense of relief.

Having lived deep in the Blue Fragrance Pavilion recently, Li Xian had observed the layout of the flowers and plants and had a hidden escape route. He really had a chance to escape. He sneaked into a cluster of flowers, moving along the ground. Suddenly, he saw several attendants sweeping snow in a corridor in the distance.

Li Xian sneaked over quietly, thinking: "If Madam is in the pavilion, no matter how I try to escape, it will be in vain. If she is not in the pavilion, why not disguise myself as an attendant and walk out of the pavilion with them? It would save me from forcibly breaking through the formation."

He then executed the "Wind Breathing Technique," opening his mouth to exhale, creating a gale-like force that blew the snow from the ground, roof tiles, and treetops... "Whooshing," the wind and snow filled the sky, blocking their vision. The attendants were blown to and fro. Xiao Tuan, being short, was so scared she lay flat on the ground. Li Xian quietly knocked out one attendant, quickly changed into his clothes, messed up his long hair to cover his face, and folded his brocade robe, hair crown, and other clothing and accessories neatly.

He looked around and saw a bamboo dustpan used to carry snow. It was big enough to hold a person. He hid the attendant and the clothes and accessories in the dustpan, sprinkled snow on top, and hid it perfectly. When the wind and snow subsided, the attendants saw the snow all over the ground. Their morning's work was all in vain, adding more labor. They cursed the evil wind.

Li Xian gave an awkward smile and lowered his head to sweep the snow. Xiao Tuan stood on a high platform inspecting the work, occasionally shouting: "Work faster! If anyone is lazy, I'll slap them. Also... I've told you a thousand times. Who dares to wander off and gets lost in the yard, I won't look for you. Let them starve and die of thirst."

She then muttered softly: "Sigh, if they really starve and die of thirst, I'll have to clean it up. Madam will surely scold me. Forget it, forget it, I'll go look for them."

Half an incense stick's time later, the snow was all swept away. Xiao Tuan was very satisfied, paid the wages, and led the way out of the pavilion. Passing by a side pavilion, her eyes darted, and she suddenly had an idea. She said: "You all come with me, there's another place that needs cleaning."

She opened the side pavilion and lit a candle. Inside were wooden boxes of various sizes, containing many miscellaneous items and collectibles. It turned out that Madam had arrived in Flying Dragon City and occasionally visited auction houses. When she was in the mood, she would buy things to collect, and some were placed here.

Xiao Tuan pointed to a wooden box in the west corner and told the attendants to carry it out to the storage room to air out.

Large and small boxes were all carried out. Li Xian smelled the scent of herbs and knew they were medicinal herbs. Several of them were very familiar. In the past, when he was a commander at the One Union Manor, he often handled medicinal herbs. He suddenly thought: "This is Madam's storage room. If I can find the Green Silkworm Rope, I might be able to use it against her in the future." While carrying the herb boxes, he secretly observed. Indeed, he saw 'Green Silkworm Rope' stored in the room, kept in a "Green Translucent Jade Box."

Wen Caishang cultivated the Silkworm Robe Misplaced Jade Art, benefiting from it but also suffering from its drawbacks. Although her ability was strong, her cultivation was difficult. The Green Silkworm Rope was essential for her cultivation and needed to be prepared regularly. It could be found on Xiao Tuan's body, in the storage room, in the bedroom... Finding it here was not a coincidence.

Li Xian knew Wen Caishang's habits well. Since he was looking for it intentionally, it was not difficult. He quietly approached, and when the time was ripe, he stole the Green Silkworm Rope. He hid it in his sleeve and acted as if nothing had happened. Xiao Tuan did not notice. After the attendants finished their work, she led them out of the pavilion. Li Xian sneaked into the crowd and successfully escaped, walking out of the Blue Fragrance Pavilion. Hearing the lively sounds of the marketplace, he felt as if he had been reborn. While delighted, his feelings were complex.

Li Xian thought: "My escape from the pavilion is a pleasant surprise. Madam is definitely not in the pavilion, otherwise I would have already suffered her cruel hand. I wonder what matter has kept Madam out for so long. Well, since I have escaped to life, I should leave immediately. When my strength grows in the future, I will avenge the siege of today." He walked another half a mile with the attendants, then took the opportunity to turn into a dark alley. He placed the dustpan on the ground, brushed off the snow, took out the attendant, used his energy to shout him awake, and then slipped away.

The attendant slowly woke up. Feeling the cold wind on his body, he was stunned for a moment before fully waking up. He was shocked to find himself lying naked. His clothes were right beside him. He immediately put them on and recalled the situation, but he could not make head or tail of it. He thought it was an evil spirit possessing him and did not dare to speak of it. He hurriedly dressed and left.

Meanwhile, on the other side.

Li Xian sneaked quietly. He reached the city gate and saw it was tightly shut, guarded by soldiers. The archers on the city wall had sharp, piercing eyes, scanning the citizens below. Li Xian found a bun shop and bought some buns while asking: "Brother, when will the city gate open?"

The bun shop vendor said: "How would I know? Sigh, with the city gate closed, my business has suffered."

Li Xian asked: "Why is it sealed? Are the other city gates open?" The bun shop vendor said: "I did overhear something. They say they've closed the gates to catch a thief. This is no small matter; they are serious about it. All entry and exit channels are sealed. But as for the specifics... I'm just a commoner, how dare I inquire? If they think I'm an accomplice of the thief, wouldn't that be terrible?"

Li Xian paid the copper coins and took a bite of the warm bun. He blended in with the crowd, not sticking out, and observed the defenses at the city gate. The gate was about nine zhang high, built of black mysterious stone, extremely solid. There was also an outer city wall outside. If he tried to force his way through, he would face enemies from all sides.

He also observed that the soldiers were arrayed in battle formation, robust and strong like dragons and tigers, all extraordinary. They vaguely formed a military formation, like an iron wall. Among them were several outstanding ones with even stronger auras, their chests out and heads high. When they spoke, their voices rumbled like thunder. They were at least at the "Chest Drum Thunder Sound" level. There were countless other archers, swordsmen, and shield bearers.

Li Xian thought secretly: "If I try to force my way through the gate and encounter such a formation, the commotion would be too great. Even if I escape the gate, there would be endless pursuit." He observed for a while longer and saw an old man standing on the city wall. His hair was white, his hands long, and his body thin, like an old sword.

The old man suddenly turned his head and looked over. Li Xian dodged and hid, quietly avoiding him. After a moment, hearing no movement, he immediately fled through a small alley. The old man just now was named "Xiao Wanjian," the "Sword Forging Elder" of the Yang Mountain Sword Sect. He was the leader of the Yang Mountain Sword Sect's expedition.

Li Xian thought: "This old man is not to be underestimated; I cannot fight him with force. Standing here, he is as sharp as a sword. If I'm not mistaken, he must be a high expert from a sword sect. Strange, how strange. How long was I trapped? Has the situation in the city changed so drastically?"

Li Xian walked about a mile. Suddenly, he saw a group of swordsmen coming. They all wore similar attire and carried giant swords on their backs. The leader was in his thirties, with short, neat hair and rough skin. His name was "Jiang Meng," a disciple of the Yang Mountain Sword Sect.

Jiang Meng brushed past Li Xian. He didn't notice at first. But after walking a bit further, he looked back, frowning. But he could no longer see Li Xian. He suppressed his suspicion for the time being and went up to the city wall to join Xiao Wanjian.

Xiao Wanjian asked: "Is there anything unusual in the city?" Jiang Meng said: "Nothing unusual for now, but..." Xiao Wanjian said: "Speak if there is something."

Jiang Meng said: "Disciple possesses the [Clear Sword Heart Physique], so my perception is quite sharp. Just now, I brushed past an ordinary person, but my heart felt unwell, as if my neck was being choked. I suspect this person is not simple. If he is not simple, why is he disguised as an ordinary person? So I am slightly suspicious."

Xiao Wanjian frowned: "Since you were suspicious, why didn't you chase him?" Jiang Meng said: "Disciple only has suspicion, no evidence. This person might be hiding something, but he may not necessarily be a villain. If I were to chase him, wouldn't that be an offense?"

Xiao Wanjian scolded: "Fool! In these extraordinary times, how can you care about others' faces? This thief surely has something unusual. I just sensed a gaze but couldn't find the figure.想必 he hid in the crowd and slipped away quietly, but ran into you."

"This person has exceptional eyesight, is deep-thinking, and acts low-key. If not for your Clear Sword Heart, he would have slipped away silently. I might have thought it was just an illusion. Where did you run into him?"

Jiang Meng said: "In Wenjing Street." Xiao Wanjian said: "Then go chase him immediately?" Xiao Wanjian said: "You guard the city gate in my stead. Don't let any small thieves take advantage of the situation. I will go after him personally."

He put his hands behind his back and executed his lightness skill, moving through the air with incredible speed. He soon arrived at Wenjing Street. This street was seven li long, with hundreds of alleys inside. Buildings lined both sides, and the crowd was dense like a weave. To hide here, how could one find him?

Xiao Wanjian stared intently but saw no suspicious thief. He felt great regret. They had been inches apart but missed each other. He could only give up.

Meanwhile, Li Xian left the city gate and went to check other city gates. All were heavily guarded, with martial arts masters stationed there.

Li Xian felt great despair at the thought of escaping. He thought again: "If I just hide like this, Madam will find a way to find me once she has the time. This Flying Dragon City is truly chaotic. The most urgent matter is that I have nowhere to go. First, I must retrieve the Sunken River Sword."

He found the inn where he was staying and returned to his room. He saw his travel bag and clothes were all intact. The Sunken River Sword was placed by the bed, covered in dust. Li Xian drew the sword from its sheath. The sharpness was still there. The blade had slight scratches but did not affect its sharpness.

Li Xian said: "Old friend, we meet again!" He placed the Sunken River Sword at his waist. Then he drew the "Green Sword." In terms of quality alone, this sword was inferior to the Sunken River Sword. It was sharp and tough but lacked the ability to manipulate water. However, it was as good as new, the blade smooth and glossy, without a single scratch.

Both swords were useful, so he wore them both at his waist. Li Xian pondered again: "The most urgent matter is to find out the situation. Then decide on the next step. But with Flying Dragon City sealed, if I inquire recklessly, I will surely attract attention."

He paced and thought. Although he had acquired the Path of Arts · Golden Light and temporarily escaped Wen Caishang, he was even more confused about the city's situation. Li Xian suddenly thought: "I can use Zhou Ping'an's identity to meet Gu Nianjun and ask her about the situation. I can clarify everything that way."

He immediately put on the white mask and carried the red bow on his back. He did not want to attract attention, so he went to the Jade Bamboo Residence at night. There was a faint light inside. Li Xian sneaked over quietly and saw Zhou Shijie in the main hall, looking dazed and absent-minded.

Li Xian thought to himself: "This Zhou Shijie, who is versed in both literature and martial arts, is a playboy no less than me. I have nothing to talk about with him. Speaking of which, this Sunken River Sword has a connection with him."

He bypassed Zhou Shijie and went to look in the other courtyard. The courtyard had elegant green bamboo, but it had not been tended to recently. Snow had piled up, breaking several branches. Li Xian had been with Wen Caishang, enjoying a blissful time and ignoring outside affairs, unaware of the changes.

Li Xian found Gu Nianjun's bedroom. He smelled a faint fragrance in the room. The desk was set with paintings, calligraphy copies, and other items. Her paintings had charm, and her calligraphy was graceful and mature. She was knowledgeable and had good cultivation.

Li Xian frowned slightly. He saw a slight layer of dust on the paintings. The bedroom had not been occupied for several days. He searched for clues on the spot. He found some spare clothes, leather boots, silk socks, fragrant handkerchiefs... personal accessories, jade belts, sachets... and other miscellaneous items.

Some of these were intimate items, not suitable for prying. But Li Xian had no scruples and examined them all carefully. He pondered:

"The clothes and accessories are all intact, showing that Gu Nianjun had no intention of leaving. So why hasn't she returned for several days? It's very strange. Gu Nianjun is very strong, sharp, and resourceful. She can handle ordinary troubles. The fact that she hasn't returned for so long must have a reason."

He observed Gu Nianjun's leftover items meticulously. The clothes and skirts left no clues, so he focused on a few pairs of walking boots. There were three pairs of boots, all of different materials. Two were for hunting and walking, and one was for making friends.

The boots for making friends were exquisitely made, with embroidery as natural as heaven. The other two were of fine material, not something an ordinary person could use. They were used for frequent walking and had a slight sweat smell mixed with body fragrance. Li Xian focused on the mud on the soles.

He pondered: "Logically, walking on snow, it's not easy to get mud on the boots. Yet there are mud traces on the soles of these boots. And..."

"It's a kind of golden mud. I heard Madam say that in places with unique geomantic omen, the soil is different. This golden mud is formed naturally by the heaven and earth in a place with good geomantic omen. Wherever this mud is seen, there must be a tomb nearby."

Li Xian felt even more confused. Suddenly, he heard a noise in the front courtyard. He sneaked over quietly. He saw Wang Dezhong and Yang Wentian, a few young men, walking over. They said to Zhou Shijie: "Brother Zhou, don't think too much about it. Surely Miss Gu is blessed with great luck and will be safe."

Zhou Shijie said gratefully: "Brothers, you have come to comfort me in your busy schedules. I, Zhou, am extremely grateful. Sigh, you are in the same situation. The Liu Shijie, Zhou Shijie, and even Elder Yun of the Jiu Mountain Sword Sect have also... all disappeared."

Wang Dezhong gritted his teeth and said: "Shameful villains! If our sect's Shijies and Shimei suffer the slightest loss, we will make them pay the blood price!"

Yang Wentian said: "That villain is truly audacious. It's not just the Shijies, Shimei, and elders of the Jiu Mountain Sword Sect. The female relatives and elders of the Li Mountain Sword Sect, Hu Mountain Sword Sect, Yue Mountain Sword Sect, and Yang Mountain Sword Sect have all disappeared for no reason. It's truly strange and bizarre."

Li Xian muttered upon hearing this: "Who is so bold and so powerful? Wow, they've taken down all five major sword sects. The five major sword sects are in the midst of an alliance, and their female relatives have all been captured. Isn't that a huge loss of face?"

He continued to listen to the three of them talking.

Yang Wentian said: "City Lord He is righteous and has ordered the city sealed to help the five sects find the thief, and has sent city soldiers to assist. I heard there has been some success. They captured a small fry from the Flower Cage Sect and interrogated him strictly. There are some slight clues."

Wang Dezhong said: "Yes, that small fry confessed the roster of the Flower Cage Sect in the city, only to discover that there were many Flower Cage thieves hidden in the city! However, the suspected thief is not some Elder Ye Cheng or others, but a new prodigy of the Flower Cage Sect..."

Zhou Shijie asked: "What is that thief's name? I will chop him into pieces!" He drew his sword, radiating killing intent.

Yang Wentian said: "That thief took quite a flashy name. His surname is Hua, given name Wucuo."

"The Flower Cage Sect's new prodigy, Hua Wucuo!"
