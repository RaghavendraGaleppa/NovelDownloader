# Chapter 219: Jueyuan  

Li Yuanba used his spiritual sense to examine the "Soul Concealment Shadow Technique," while his true body, Li Shiming, simultaneously recorded this technique in IBMz15. This technique would be considered a top-tier secret art in any sect—a rare and extraordinary method that was hard to come by.  

Li Shiming had already requested leave from Elder Su and Master Ma. He piloted his flying boat toward the battlefield.  

He hadn’t told his masters that he was heading to the conflict zone between the Senluo Sect and the Thousand Leaves Temple. If they had known, they would never have allowed him to go. Even the sect wouldn’t have permitted him to put himself in danger—he was, after all, the sect’s true inheritor of alchemy.  

After obtaining the "Soul Concealment Shadow Technique," he began studying it aboard the flying boat.  

As for safety, the flying boat was still within the territory of the Shushan Sect. Even if he ventured into the territory of the Illusory Sect, there was no need to worry about security. The righteous sects’ domains weren’t as chaotic as the Ten Thousand Mountains.  

Moreover, the insignia of the Shushan Sect on his flying boat alone was enough to deter any troublemakers.  

The "Soul Concealment Shadow Technique" wasn’t without limitations. It required the user to be in darkness or nighttime to take effect. Under sunlight, the technique was completely useless.  

The technique also required yin-attribute spiritual energy as a foundation, which made Li Yuanba frown. This meant his clone, Li Yuanba, couldn’t cultivate this technique.  

This was normal. All top-tier secret arts had restrictions. If they could be cultivated freely, true inheritors would have already mastered countless techniques.  

Since Li Shiming’s spiritual lake contained five-element spiritual energy, his water-attribute spiritual energy counted as yin-attribute, allowing him to cultivate this technique.  

Meanwhile, Li Yuanba sat down in frustration and casually deployed thirty-six formation flags, setting up a barrier to isolate his aura.  

Whether by good or bad luck, he hadn’t encountered any Thousand Leaves Temple monks in this area despite traveling for some time.  

Currently, both sides were still in a probing phase, with no large-scale battles yet.  

He closed his eyes to rest, deciding to wait passively. Sooner or later, a monk would come to him.  

After sitting for the time it took to drink a cup of tea, a shadowy figure darted through the darkness like a ghost. Moving so swiftly in such an environment meant the person was either chasing an enemy or being chased.  

The figure was using a demonic cultivation technique—undoubtedly a Senluo Sect disciple. Likely, a monk was in pursuit.  

Li Yuanba stood up, watching the fleeing demonic cultivator with interest. He had no intention of intervening.  

He had no affection for the Senluo Sect, especially after becoming Sword Elder’s disciple. Under the elder’s influence, his attachment to the sect had grown even weaker.  

His attitude toward sect members was one of indifference—no interaction, no initiative.  

The fleeing demonic cultivator hurled a talisman backward, which transformed into a cloud of black mist, likely meant to obstruct the pursuer.  

"Break!" A voice imbued with Buddhist resonance rang out, and the black mist instantly dissipated. A tall monk emerged from within.  

Li Yuanba’s eyes narrowed. The monk was only at the mid-stage Buddha realm, yet he exuded an overwhelming pressure.  

Yes, this monk was undoubtedly the most oppressive Foundation Establishment cultivator he had ever encountered.  

With each step the monk took, a white lotus bloomed beneath his feet. Though his strides weren’t large, he closed the distance to the fleeing demonic cultivator with alarming speed.  

This visual distortion unsettled Li Yuanba, who was observing from the sidelines.  

The fleeing demonic cultivator was at the late Foundation Establishment stage. Since he wasn’t part of Li Yuanba’s group, Li Yuanba didn’t recognize him, but he assumed the man was an inner sect disciple.  

"Freeze!" the tall monk bellowed when he was thirty meters away.  

Even from a distance, Li Yuanba felt an unusual energy in the voice—something that could influence a cultivator’s mind. The demonic cultivator thirty meters away suddenly stiffened.  

Li Yuanba’s scalp tingled. A technique that could immobilize a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator with just a voice was terrifying.  

He was almost certain this monk was a true inheritor like himself. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have access to such a fearsome technique.  

From the monk’s movement technique to the power of his voice, everything about him was extraordinary.  

If all Thousand Leaves Temple monks were this strong, this war would be over before it even began.  

While the demonic cultivator was frozen, the tall monk took another step. The next white lotus appeared two meters behind the demonic cultivator. The monk’s palm transformed into a massive golden hand, slamming into the demonic cultivator’s back.  

Since the demonic cultivator had been fleeing, he had retracted his defensive artifact to maximize speed.  

This was unavoidable. Activating a defensive artifact provided safety, but many movement techniques couldn’t be used while it was active, making it impossible to outrun the monk.  

The moment the demonic cultivator saw the monk, he had tried to escape, but it was too late.  

The "Freeze" command had only immobilized him for an instant, but that was enough. By the time he regained control, the golden palm had already struck.  

The golden hand pierced through the demonic cultivator’s body like a divine weapon. The man stared blankly at the gaping hand-shaped hole in his torso, stretching from his chest to his abdomen.  

"Amitabha," the tall monk intoned, pressing his palms together after killing the demonic cultivator.  

He didn’t bother collecting his spoils. Instead, his gaze turned toward Li Yuanba’s direction.  

Clearly, Li Yuanba’s observation had been detected. With Li Yuanba’s perception, he would have noticed if someone was watching him from such a distance too.  

Li Yuanba flashed out from his formation. The Swift Wind Golden Light Sword, infused with sharp sword intent, shot toward the monk like an almost invisible streak of light.  

At the same time, Li Yuanba pushed off with his feet, putting distance between himself and the monk.  

It seemed he was wary of getting too close—understandable, given how the monk had closed in to thirty meters before delivering the fatal Buddhist voice technique and finishing off the demonic cultivator.  

Li Yuanba had seen it all and naturally chose the most advantageous combat approach.  

"A sword cultivator!" The monk’s eyes gleamed. With a wave of his hand, a bronze bell appeared before him, blocking the Swift Wind Golden Light Sword’s attack.  

Li Yuanba was taken aback. Though his sword had struck the bell artifact, his sword intent hadn’t weakened the spiritual imprint within.  

This was the first time he had encountered such a situation. However, he recalled Sword Elder mentioning that certain techniques could reinforce spiritual imprints, drastically reducing the effectiveness of sword intent.  

But weakening wasn’t the same as nullifying. If one strike didn’t work, ten would. If ten didn’t, a hundred would.  

Far from feeling fear, Li Yuanba was exhilarated.  

People had many facets. Some were shy in public but lively among friends. Others preferred solitude but still enjoyed gatherings.  

Li Yuanba was Li Shiming’s clone, but their personalities weren’t identical.  

Perhaps because Li Shiming’s safety was paramount, he was always cautious and rarely sought danger.  

But Li Shiming’s adventurous and combative nature had transferred to Li Yuanba—fitting, given that Li Yuanba was a sword cultivator.  

When considering Li Yuanba’s path, it was clear that sword cultivation required battle for tempering.  

Thus, from the moment Li Yuanba joined the Senluo Sect, he had constantly taken on combat missions. This was, in a way, an outlet for Li Shiming’s suppressed desires—the true body prioritized safety, leaving the dangers to the clone.  

Facing a formidable opponent like the tall monk, Li Yuanba was eager for the challenge. Such adversaries were rare.  

The monk took a step forward, his figure vanishing. Li Yuanba split off a sword light, using sword遁 (teleportation) to rapidly change direction.  

Sword light splitting was a basic technique in many sword cultivation lineages, but it was rarely used against strong opponents.  

Splitting the sword light weakened its power, making it less effective against foes of similar strength.  

It was more suited for dealing with weaker enemies—any one of the split lights could kill them, making it ideal for handling large numbers of weak opponents.  

Li Yuanba was cautious. Lacking experience against such powerful cultivators, he prioritized safety above all else.  

Even if it meant weakening his sword light, he needed to maximize his mobility.  

Sword遁 was among the fastest movement techniques. As he shifted direction, a white lotus bloomed where he had been standing moments earlier, followed by the appearance of the tall monk.  

The distance between them had been over a hundred meters, yet the monk had closed it instantly. Clearly, he hadn’t been using his full speed earlier.  

Li Yuanba was even more shocked by the monk’s terrifying movement technique. Whether in combat or pursuit, this technique was incredibly effective.  

The monk was also surprised. He hadn’t expected Li Yuanba to react so quickly, anticipating his next move.  

He slapped the floating bronze bell beside him.  

The bell emitted a metallic chime, but the sound waves didn’t scatter. Instead, they converged into a roughly forty-five-degree arc, surging toward Li Yuanba.  

"Soundwave technique!" Li Yuanba sensed the incoming waves with his spiritual sense.  

Li Yuanba—or rather, Li Shiming—was very familiar with soundwave techniques. He had cultivated the "Demonic Sound Lotus" and inherited the Six-Fingered Sound Demon’s legacy.  

Though he hadn’t practiced the latter, he had studied soundwave techniques in depth.  

The Swift Wind Golden Light Sword flashed before him. Under Li Yuanba’s control, the blade vibrated, producing a sword tone that formed a soundwave barrier, blocking the monk’s attack.  

"I am Jueyuan, true inheritor of the Thousand Leaves Temple. May I ask which true inheritor of the Senluo Sect you are? I’ve never heard of you," the monk suddenly introduced himself.  

If the enemy had been easily dealt with, Jueyuan wouldn’t have bothered speaking.  

But Li Yuanba’s display of strength had earned his respect. Moreover, as a sword cultivator rather than a demonic cultivator, Jueyuan’s attitude had softened slightly.  

"Li Yuanba, a nobody," Li Yuanba replied, still maintaining a safe distance.  

"Aside from Sword Elder, I didn’t expect the Senluo Sect to have another pure sword cultivator. A pity," Jueyuan said, shaking his head.  

Such a sword cultivator belonged among righteous sects, not as an ally of demonic cultivators.  

"Sword Elder is my master," Li Yuanba admitted. He knew that after this battle, his status as a true inheritor would be known to all sects, so there was no point hiding it.  

"Then I must go all out. I cannot allow you to grow," Jueyuan said solemnly, pressing his palms together.  

His eyes burned with fighting spirit. Sword Elder had killed a Thousand Leaves Temple arhat—a grave enmity. Since Li Yuanba was Sword Elder’s disciple, he shared in that hatred.  

Moreover, such a sword cultivator couldn’t be allowed to mature. Otherwise, he would become another Sword Elder, further strengthening the Senluo Sect.  

Sword Elder was renowned as the foremost offensive force among Golden Core cultivators. Though a few others shared his reputation, without direct clashes, their true rankings remained uncertain.  

But once Sword Elder reached the Nascent Soul stage, he would undoubtedly be among the elite. Such was the might of sword cultivators.  

If Sword Elder had accepted Li Yuanba as a disciple, his talent must be exceptional.  

Sword Elder had never taken disciples before, underscoring his strict standards.  

Jueyuan was now resolved to kill. He couldn’t let Li Yuanba leave alive.  

As fellow true inheritors, Jueyuan had decades more experience than Li Yuanba, not to mention a higher cultivation stage. He was confident in his ability to kill Li Yuanba.  

As Jueyuan spoke, his body radiated golden light. White lotuses surged from the ground at fifty-meter intervals, spreading outward rapidly until they reached Li Yuanba.  

Jueyuan vanished, reappearing atop the nearest lotus. As he moved, the lotuses expanded faster, centered around him.  

"What kind of technique is this?" Li Yuanba retreated swiftly, not daring to enter the lotus zone.  

Jueyuan’s movement seemed less like speed and more like teleportation between lotuses, with no visible transition. His figure flickered unpredictably, defying visual tracking.  

"You’re a true inheritor and a sword cultivator. How can you fear battle with me?" Jueyuan shouted.  

His voice carried an encouraging Buddhist resonance, typically used to bolster allies. Here, it served as a taunt.
