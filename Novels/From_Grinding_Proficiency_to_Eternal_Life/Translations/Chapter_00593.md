Chapter 593: Is There a Great Sage Here Too?

The burly Taoist trembled violently, as if struck by lightning. His face turned ashen in an instant, and his Dao Heart nearly collapsed.

The enemy's effortless technique was on a level that completely exceeded his imagination.

At the same time, within the Heavenly Star Spirit Banner in Xu Yunfan's sleeve.

The remnant soul of Nezha, just recently sucked into the banner's chaotic space, had awakened under the stimulation of the banner's true power.

His angry, unwilling, and murderous divine sense echoed within the space, fiercely struggling to break free from this new prison.

"What demonic fiend dares to ambush this young master?! Let me out!! Once I recover, I'll grind your bones and scatter your ashes!!"

Xu Yunfan's mind sensed the commotion inside the banner, and the corner of his mouth couldn't help but curl into a slight smile.

He looked at the terrified burly Taoist below, whose strength was only equivalent to the early Foundation Establishment stage, and chuckled lightly.

"The noisy little brat is already inside. Why struggle? This Seat is kind-hearted. I'll send you to reunite with your master right now. It would be wonderful for you to look after each other inside this banner from now on, wouldn't it?"

Before his words had even faded, Xu Yunfan's eyes sharpened, and killing intent was revealed.

Dealing with a mere early Foundation Establishment burly Taoist was as simple as crushing an ant for a late Foundation Establishment expert like him.

He gave the burly Taoist no chance to catch his breath or self-destruct. His vast divine sense, combined with the operation of his profound technique, caused the Heavenly Star Spirit Banner to shine with a dark light once more.

The burly Taoist sensed the killing intent and instinctively ignited his last bit of immortal energy to resist or escape.

But in the face of an absolute gap in strength, all resistance was futile.

The Eight Scenery Cloud Qi descended with a rumble, like the lid of a heavenly and earthly furnace, instantly enveloping the burly Taoist and the void around him.

The soul-snatching power of the Heavenly Star Spirit Banner followed closely behind.

He couldn't even let out a scream. Under the scouring of the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, the burly Taoist's form was like a snowman under the scorching sun. His protective immortal light shattered and dissipated in less than half a breath. His physical body, along with his soul that had not yet fully left it, was forcibly refined in an instant.

Only the purest essence of his soul origin was forcibly extracted by the tyrannical power of the star banner, then dragged violently into the deep space of the banner's surface, becoming a part of it.

The entire process took only a few breaths.

Under the shattered ruins of the heavens, beside the murky puddle, only the bare jade handle of a horsetail whisk and the messy traces of battle remained.

The former guardian and the one being guarded had both vanished, having entered the precious banner.

Inside the Star Spirit Banner, the spatial tremors gradually subsided.

Nezha's remnant soul stopped his fierce struggling and cursing, because under the same shroud of chaotic starlight, another figure, plump and clad in a Taoist robe, was slowly taking form. It was a banner spirit formed from his master, Grandmaster Taiyi, now possessing absolute obedience to the banner master, Xu Yunfan.

Nezha's star spirit form flashed with intense red light, a feeling of utter despair and sorrow surging within him.

Inside the banner's space, there were now only two thoroughly refined banner spirits, left with the bond of the same source of their Dao's principles.

Once everything had completely settled, Xu Yunfan thoroughly refined the soul with his divine sense and examined Grandmaster Taiyi's memories.

As the refinement completed, the core secrets of Grandmaster Taiyi's lifelong cultivation knowledge were imprinted by the Heavenly Star Spirit Banner and fed back to Xu Yunfan, the main soul.

"So that's how it is."

Xu Yunfan digested this information, a look of keen interest shining in his eyes.

"The Heavenly Immortal Dao methods of this world do have some redeeming qualities. It is said to be divided into three paths: first, advancing both Primordial Spirit and physical body in tandem to achieve an Immortal Body; second, tempering the physical body to attain the Sage Position; third, shedding the Primordial Spirit to ascend in broad daylight...

Under the influence of this world's complete laws, once one becomes an immortal, as long as one can safely pass the Three Calamities and Five Tribulations every five hundred years and avoid the final Five Declines of the Heavens and Man, one's lifespan will be as eternal as the heavens, granting a long and enduring existence..."

The methods here and the Five Lifetimes Reincarnation theory of the Taihua Void Realm are hard to say which is better or worse. After all, the further one goes, the more terrifying the Three Calamities and Five Tribulations become.

According to Grandmaster Taiyi's memories, those who can survive for ten thousand years are exceedingly rare.

He pondered for a moment, his fingers stroking the banner pole.

"Becoming an immortal is relatively easy. The true priceless treasures, which are extremely rare, are the secret arts that allow one to safely avoid the Three Calamities and Five Tribulations and the Five Declines of the Heavens and Man...

It seems this burly Taoist, or rather, Grandmaster Taiyi, held a truly high status, as he just happened to掌握 the core secret art known as the 'True Mantra for Evading the Five Tribulations'."

Xu Yunfan carefully savored the essence of this art, which used special principles to invoke, transfer, weaken, and even substitute for calamities.

"Though the systems are different, it still contains a bit of the exquisite principles of the Heavenly Dao's cycle. The ideas within on how to avoid disasters, condense the先天 indestructible true will—which is this world's so-called 'Entering Sage' and condensing the Immortal Golden Nature—are quite helpful for my own contemplation, especially for condensing the Golden Nature of my Dao Body in the future."

After all, it was the essence of a great world. Stones from other hills can polish jade.

Xu Yunfan would naturally learn from it with an open mind.

Just as he was digesting his gains in this shattered celestial expanse and preparing to leave, the Heavenly Star Spirit Banner hovering beside him flashed with a dark light. The already thoroughly refined star spirit, Yang Jian, stepped out on his own and bowed to report to Xu Yunfan.

"What is it?"

Xu Yunfan's gaze sharpened. For Yang Jian to manifest on his own, there must be a reason.

Yang Jian raised his head, his voice steady.

"Reporting to the Venerable One, even as the Heavenly Court collapsed, there are still treasures to be found. There is now an ape who calls himself the 'Great Sage Equal to Heaven,' Sun Wukong. Although his life spirit source was suppressed by the Western Buddha Head, Tathagata, beneath the Five-Finger Cliff in the desolate Western Frontier, and is being worn away day and night by Buddha's light... his last breath of unyielding true energy has not yet been extinguished. His soul is fragmented, but his ferocity has not faded."

"Great Sage Equal to Heaven... Sun Wukong?"

A brilliant light suddenly erupted in Xu Yunfan's eyes.

Gaining Yang Jian from the spiritual banner was already an unexpectedly powerful aid. If he could add the peerless demon ape who stirred the three realms and six paths, making the immortal Buddhas of the heavens headache, to his collection...

No one could resist the reputation of this Great Sage. If he could collect him like a card, Xu Yunfan would naturally not miss the opportunity.

Yang Jian nodded, the divine pattern on his forehead glowing faintly as if sensing something.

"The Five-Finger Buddha Seal is condensed from Tathagata's supreme law, locking his form and spirit, and extinguishing his true energy.

But for some reason, although this ape was slapped to death by a Heaven-Emperor-level existence, it can now invoke the Nine Nether Yin Fire from deep within the earth's veins, using its violent and malevolent aura to sustain its last wisp of origin fire.

His soul is less than one percent of what it was, shattered to pieces, but his will is not broken. His ferocity is still greater than mine at my peak."

"Can his soul enter the banner?"

Hearing Yang Jian's archaic speech, Xu Yunfan didn't bother with pleasantries and asked directly.

"Yes."

Yang Jian's answer was decisive.

"His soul origin is suppressed and worn away by the Buddha Seal, making it extremely weak. This is a prime opportunity to take him into the banner and refine him.

If his origin ferocity can be tamed and turned into a Star Spirit general, his power would be enough to fight a Heavenly Immortal head-on, making him a peerless vanguard in the Venerable One's hand to break through obstacles and destroy enemies."

"Heavenly Immortal?"

Xu Yunfan was a bit surprised. According to the Heavenly Court's conversion, a Heavenly Immortal was on par with the late Foundation Establishment stage.

Being able to fight one head-on was enough to show the demon ape's great potential.

Once he becomes a banner spirit, in the future, given time, he might even be able to clash with a True Lord.
