**Chapter 116: The Long Game (Seeking Monthly Votes)**  

On the flying boat, beams of multicolored light intertwined in an instant, erupting into a dazzling burst that barely managed to repel the giant eagle.  

Zhou Qing, observing from the shadows, was slightly surprised.  

These four Qi Refinement cultivators had decent techniques—working together, they had temporarily forced back a Foundation Establishment-level demonic beast.  

After repelling the eagle, the four on the boat didn’t immediately flee.  

Through silent communication, they realized that the Nightmare Eagle could dive underwater. Whether in the sky or beneath the waves, attempting to escape would only lead to pursuit, and they might encounter other demonic beasts along the way.  

With a flick of her wrist, Immortal Luo unleashed a blinding red light from her hand—a crimson silk ribbon that expanded instantly, enveloping the eagle’s monstrous head. The beast shrieked in pain.  

Simultaneously, three beams of light struck the eagle’s left wing.  

Enraged, the eagle tore through the silk ribbon with a blade of wind, disregarding its injuries as it flapped its wings violently, stirring up a terrifying gale.  

The flying boat was engulfed in the turbulent winds, and the four cultivators gradually found themselves at a disadvantage.  

The eagle’s monstrous head emitted a terrifying sonic screech, weakening the boat’s protective barrier until it teetered on the verge of collapse.  

The four inwardly cursed their misfortune. According to their map, Nightmare Eagles rarely appeared in these waters. Why had they encountered one the moment they arrived?  

The map they had purchased indicated that as long as they didn’t dive below a thousand fathoms, they were unlikely to encounter powerful demonic beasts. That was why they had ventured out of the city in search of resources.  

Yet here they were, facing disaster.  

Was it because of the recent battle on the island?  

The combatants had just left, and now they were caught in the eagle’s path.  

Though Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts weren’t unheard of in the wild, the Jingyang Dao Domain spanned a hundred thousand li—it wasn’t easy to stumble upon one unless during the once-a-decade beast tides.  

Now, the boat’s hull groaned under immense pressure, warping under the strain.  

The four prepared for a desperate last stand, hoping to scatter and escape.  

Suddenly, the surrounding mist coalesced into a massive hand that swatted at the eagle. At the same time, an intense chill erupted in the air.  

The eagle, struck by the misty hand, shattered it with a flap of its wings—but before the mist could disperse, the air turned frigid, freezing the moisture into frost.  

The eagle’s body stiffened mid-flight.  

---  

At that moment, an overwhelming aura surged from the island below.  

A terrifying arrow of condensed energy, blazing with white light, shot through the sky and struck the eagle’s monstrous head. A green inner core flew out, plummeting toward the island.  

The core exploded with power, darkening the sky as a suffocating pressure blanketed the island.  

Then, a deep crimson bolt of lightning struck the core.  

A piercing shriek erupted from within as a green light tried to escape—only to be engulfed by a fiery dragon that incinerated it instantly.  

The core, now charred, fell onto the island, while the eagle’s corpse crashed into the water, sending massive waves surging.  

The four cultivators on the boat were stunned.  

From nearly being torn apart to witnessing the eagle’s demise—all in mere moments.  

Such power was beyond even the newly ascended Foundation Establishment experts in the city.  

And the fact that the mysterious figure hadn’t even revealed themselves made their prowess all the more terrifying.  

"Come down."  

The voice was distant yet clear, resonating in their minds.  

Not daring to disobey, they obediently descended onto the island.  

"Hand over all your spirit stones."  

They inwardly groaned—this expert was indeed ruthless. But then again, those who cultivated to such heights in the Southern Wastelands were rarely merciful.  

They reluctantly handed over their storage pouches.  

"I only want the spirit stones. Or do you expect me to take them myself?"  

For a moment, they were confused—was this expert really only after the stones? Not their lives?  

Hastily, they emptied their pouches, producing around twelve hundred low-grade spirit stones, including a single mid-grade stone from Immortal Luo. Though reluctant, she knew better than to hide anything from such a figure.  

Two jade vials landed before them.  

"Take them."  

Assuming poison, they hesitated.  

Immortal Luo was the first to act. "Fellow Daoists, this expedition was my idea—I’ve brought you misfortune."  

She uncorked a vial and swallowed a pill without hesitation.  

A rich medicinal fragrance filled her mouth and nostrils.  

"Qi Condensation Pills?!"  

---  

The middle-aged cultivator opened the second vial and gasped. "Marrow-Cleansing Pills!"  

Both pills were invaluable to Qi Refinement cultivators.  

Over the past three centuries, repeated beast tides had not only claimed countless cultivators but also diminished the number of alchemists and artificers.  

While artificers were less critical—given the abundance of legacy artifacts—pills were consumables. Their scarcity had made them a coveted resource, driving many toward demonic cultivation, which allowed them to absorb the essence of flesh and blood directly.  

But demonic cultivators risked losing control as they advanced. In three hundred years, only the four demonic sect leaders had reached the Core Formation stage.  

For rogue cultivators like them, obtaining these pills was nothing short of a miracle.  

"Consider these pills as payment for your spirit stones. If it’s not enough, take it as repayment for saving your lives," the voice intoned.  

"Many thanks, Senior!"  

Though curious about the expert’s identity, they dared not probe with their spiritual senses—that would be suicidal.  

After a brief discussion, they decided to be forthright.  

"Senior, the value of these pills exceeds our spirit stones. Is there anything else you require?"  

The voice replied, "Then make up the difference."  

Realizing the expert was likely unaware of the pills’ true worth—useless to someone of their level—they pooled additional resources and placed them respectfully on the ground.  

"Senior, if there’s anything else you need, we’ll do our best to provide it," Immortal Luo ventured cautiously.  

"You wish to trade with me?"  

"W-we wouldn’t dare!" they stammered.  

"Very well. Every twenty days, bring anything of value to this island. I’ll leave two random pill vials for you to take."  

Overjoyed, they bowed repeatedly in gratitude before hastily departing.  

---  

Once out of earshot, they marveled at their fortune.  

"Could it be… the Senior pitied us as fellow humans?" Immortal Luo mused.  

The others fell silent. It was the only explanation.  

"Let’s swear a Dao Oath to never speak of this," she proposed.  

The others agreed immediately. This was a rare opportunity—one they couldn’t afford to lose through carelessness.  

---  

Watching from afar, Zhou Qing and Zhang Jingxiu observed their departure.  

"Using them as intermediaries is safer than venturing into Tianxuan City ourselves," Zhou Qing remarked. "If they betray us, we’ll know."  

Zhang Jingxiu chuckled. "You’ve grown merciful."  

Zhou Qing sighed. "Survival here is hard enough. As fellow humans, I’ll help where I can."  

His voice darkened. "After all, they aren’t our true enemies here."  

Zhang Jingxiu nodded solemnly. Without the safety of the mortal realm, they’d be treading on thin ice.  

Returning to the island, they dismantled the eagle’s corpse, filling their storage pouches to the brim.  

Zhou Qing hoped this arrangement would yield steady resources.  

He now understood why pills were so coveted—no wonder the previous intruders’ pouches had been devoid of them.
