**Chapter 82: Beast Tide**

"Junior Brother Chu also brought low-grade mid-tier talismans?" Gu Xiaoqing asked, somewhat surprised.

At this moment, Shen Zhengquan, Luo Yiping, and Lu Miaoying, who were nearby, also opened their shops. Hearing Gu Xiaoqing's words, their gazes simultaneously turned towards him.

Chu Ning naturally heard Gu Xiaoqing say "brought." He didn't refute her, merely affirmed, "I prepared a little."

Hearing this, Luo Yiping, who had originally planned to watch Chu Ning's misfortune today, immediately gaped slightly. "Could this guy be the son of some elder from the Spirit Talisman Pavilion? Even high-quality low-grade mid-tier talismans were prepared in such quantities for him?"

Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, Gu Xiaoqing's face showed a gentle smile. "I was just about to remind Junior Brother Chu that I heard the person in charge of talisman sales at Wind Gorge market is a Tier 2 Talisman Master. It seems Junior Brother was already well-prepared."

The woman wasn't stunningly beautiful, but her smile was gentle and endearing, quite attractive. It drew side glances from both Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan.

Before Chu Ning could reply, several figures rushed over, heading towards their respective stalls.

"Shopkeeper, I want to buy talismans, do you have..."

The one who came to Chu Ning's stall was a middle-aged man with thick eyebrows and large eyes. He urgently spoke as soon as he arrived. Then, after his gaze swept over the sign hanging outside Chu Ning's stall, he immediately let out a surprised cry. "You have low-grade mid-tier talismans here? What kind of talismans do you have?"

Chu Ning, feeling puzzled by the man's anxious demeanor, smoothly replied, "All kinds are available, you can take a look yourself."

As he spoke, Chu Ning casually pointed to the counter in front of him. On it were not only various talismans but also their corresponding prices.

The thick-browed middle-aged man immediately started looking and muttering. "Shadow Lightning Talisman, Stealth Talisman, Clear Wind Talisman — five low-grade spirit stones each. Oh, there's also the Beast Trapping Talisman..."

He paused, then immediately shouted, "Shopkeeper, give me twenty Beast Trapping Talismans, and ten each of Shadow Lightning Talismans, Vajra Talismans, Earth Evasion Talismans, and Clear Wind Talismans. Also, thirty low-grade low-tier talismans for attack and defense each..."

Chu Ning was slightly stunned. "So many?"

The thick-browed middle-aged man immediately became anxious. "Shopkeeper, do you not have that many?"

"Yes, of course, I do!" Chu Ning immediately replied.

Saying this, he began taking talismans out of his storage bag. While taking out the talismans, Chu Ning calculated. "Thirty Blazing Fire Talismans are sixty low-grade spirit stones, thirty Earth Armor Talismans are ninety low-grade spirit stones. Twenty Shadow Lightning Talismans and Clear Wind Talismans together are one hundred low-grade spirit stones. Thirty Beast Trapping Talismans and Earth Evasion Talismans are one hundred eighty spirit stones. Ten Vajra Talismans are seventy spirit stones. Total: five hundred low-grade spirit stones."

Such a large business, he thought, should warrant a discount. Chu Ning was contemplating reducing the price when, before he could speak, the thick-browed middle-aged man swiftly pulled out a pile of spirit stones from his storage bag and placed them in front of Chu Ning. Then, he grabbed the talismans and hurried away. From his actions, he seemed to be heading to Gu Xiaoqing's shop, which sold medicine pills.

Chu Ning was slightly taken aback. "Is he that urgent?"

He was curious to see what the man would do at Gu Xiaoqing's place, but just then, another person arrived hurriedly from the other side. "Shopkeeper, what kind of talismans do you have..."

This time, it was a cultivator around fifty years old with a wisp of goatee on his chin. As he spoke, he focused his gaze on Chu Ning's various prices. Then, he pointed to several talismans and said, "Ten each of Shadow Lightning Talismans, Clear Wind Talismans, and Earth Evasion Talismans. Fifteen Vajra Talismans, twenty Beast Trapping Talismans. Forty each of Blazing Fire Talismans and Profound Ice Talismans, thirty Rejuvenation Talismans, and twenty Wood Evasion Talismans."

As he spoke, the goatee-bearded old man had already begun taking out spirit stones. Having witnessed the previous middle-aged man's example, Chu Ning didn't say much and quickly helped the man retrieve all the various talismans. Then, he swiftly calculated the total.

"Twenty Shadow Lightning Talismans and Clear Wind Talismans together are one hundred low-grade spirit stones. Fifteen Vajra Talismans are one hundred five spirit stones. Thirty Earth Evasion Talismans and Beast Trapping Talismans together are one hundred eighty spirit stones. Eighty Blazing Fire Talismans and Profound Ice Talismans combined are one hundred sixty spirit stones. Thirty Rejuvenation Talismans are sixty spirit stones, and twenty Wood Evasion Talismans are sixty spirit stones. Total: six hundred five low-grade spirit stones."

As soon as Chu Ning finished calculating, he quickly said, "Let's make it six hundred spirit stones."

The goatee-bearded man also took out the spirit stones without hesitation, placed them in front of Chu Ning, then grabbed the talismans and left. This left Chu Ning, who had originally wanted to ask a few more questions, no choice but to give up.

Something was wrong, very wrong! Chu Ning immediately frowned slightly. Both men seemed to be from cultivation families, but even cultivation families couldn't possibly need so many talismans at once. And for two families to buy so many simultaneously. Furthermore, from their demeanor, they seemed to be buying not just talismans, but also medicine pills and magical artifacts.

"Did something happen?"

When the third person, a female cultivator around thirty-six or thirty-seven, appeared before Chu Ning and immediately requested two hundred talismans, Chu Ning finally couldn't help but ask her while taking out talismans: "Fellow Daoist, what exactly happened? Why are you all so rushed, and buying so many talismans at once?"

The beautiful woman seemed more composed, but her face also showed a hint of seriousness. She sighed slightly and said, "It's a Beast Tide!"

"Beast Tide?" Chu Ning exclaimed, surprised.

This wasn't the first time he had heard this term. Previously, He Changyou and Liao Yunming had told him when sending him to Yanji Market that even the greatest disaster in this market, a Beast Tide, wasn't too troublesome for cultivators in the mid-Qi Condensation stage to handle. This was because the branch mountain range primarily harbored low-grade Tier 1 and mid-grade Tier 1 demonic beasts, with low-grade Tier 1 beasts being the most common, equivalent to cultivators in the early Qi Condensation stage. Moreover, the sect and various cultivation families had formed law enforcement patrol teams, so there wasn't much to fear.

After arriving at the market, Chu Ning also learned that the area near Yanji Market would experience occasional beast rampages, or Beast Tides. Such times were often when various goods sold best. So, when he heard the beautiful woman mention "Beast Tide," Chu Ning's eyes instinctively lit up.

Just as he was about to inquire for more details, the beautiful woman urged, "Shopkeeper, please hurry. I still need to buy other things and rush back to my family. This Beast Tide seems different from usual; I heard some mid-grade Tier 1 and high-grade Tier 1 demonic beasts have appeared. Last night, the Yangling Li Family was attacked by demonic beasts and suffered heavy casualties."

Chu Ning, who was taking out talismans, heard this and quickly asked, "Are there many high-grade Tier 1 demonic beasts?"

Mid-grade Tier 1 demonic beasts are roughly equivalent to cultivators at Qi Condensation levels 4-5, while high-grade Tier 1 demonic beasts have already reached the level of cultivators at Qi Condensation levels 7-8. Some powerful high-grade Tier 1 demonic beasts can even reach the level of cultivators at Qi Condensation level 9.

The young woman hesitated, seeming somewhat uncertain, and said, "I heard that the attack on the Yangling Li Family last night involved quite a few mid-grade Tier 1 demonic beasts and one high-grade Tier 1 demonic beast. But it's uncertain if there are higher-grade ones. Logically, there have been very few demonic beasts of this level in the mountains around Yanji Market before."

Hearing the young woman's words, Chu Ning felt more confident. He handed her the talismans, while also subtracting ten spirit stones from the total.

High-grade Tier 1 demonic beasts indeed posed a certain impact on the cultivation families in this area. However, the main reason for heavy losses should be due to insufficient preparation; otherwise, the losses wouldn't be too great. After all, among these cultivation families affiliated with the Qingxi Sect, while there might not be Foundation Establishment cultivators, most large families would have one or two cultivators in the late Qi Condensation stage.

Chu Ning's only concern at the moment was whether the talismans he had prepared would be insufficient. After all, in these three days, he had only prepared around three hundred low-grade mid-tier talismans. And now, these first three families alone had taken over a hundred.

The young woman took the talismans Chu Ning handed her, felt them briefly in her hand, and her eyes lit up. "Fellow Daoist, your low-grade mid-tier and low-grade talismans are actually of higher quality than those from Wind Gorge."

Chu Ning merely smiled and didn't reply. Although he didn't know the standard of the Tier 2 Talisman Master from Wind Gorge, he figured they certainly couldn't compare to his Talisman Source Spiritual Body talent.

After the young woman left, Chu Ning's stall was continuously visited by several more people. Chu Ning's worries were not unfounded; the talismans he had prepared quickly sold out. After learning that there were no low-grade mid-tier talismans left, even the low-grade low-tier talismans were swept clean by the crowd.

Such a scene caused Luo Yiping's eyes to almost pop out. The Beast Tide occurring nearby was no longer a secret in Yanji Market. At such times, everyone naturally wanted to prepare items that could kill demonic beasts or protect their lives. So, whether it was Chu Ning's talismans, Gu Xiaoqing's medicine pills, or Shen Zhengquan's magical artifacts, they were all highly sought after. As for Luo Yiping's spirit beasts, no one would consider them at such a time. Thus, he could only watch as Chu Ning's, Gu Xiaoqing's, and Shen Zhengquan's shops were bustling with customers, while his own was deserted.

Chu Ning, at this moment, naturally had no time to consider Luo Yiping's thoughts. Seeing how popular the talismans were, he was moved. He had no more talismans stored, but he could draw them!

Acting on his thought, Chu Ning simply hung a "Temporarily Closed" sign and went directly into his room. At this point, Chu Ning didn't even consider low-grade low-tier talismans; he immediately began crafting low-grade mid-tier talismans. He only stopped when he had fifty mid-tier talismans laid out in front of him and felt a slight discomfort in his Niwan Palace.

As Chu Ning brought out his mid-tier talismans, in the Wind Gorge Talisman Hall on another street...

The yellow-robed cultivator looked at the few people in his shop with an arrogant expression. "These mid-tier attack talismans are seven spirit stones each. Buy them or don't. Talismans are in high demand in Yanji Market right now, so the price naturally can't be calculated as usual."

A young man in black heard this and immediately shouted, "But you can't raise the price so drastically! Qingxi Talisman Hall sold one or two hundred low-grade mid-tier talismans today, and their prices weren't like this. Moreover, their quality is even better than yours."

The yellow-robed cultivator's face twitched. Learning that Qingxi Talisman Hall also sold low-grade mid-tier talismans, and that their quality was even higher than his, truly infuriated him. This morning, his own talisman hall had been practically empty.

However, at this moment, he still sneered disdainfully. "Qingxi Talisman Hall? Hmph, so what if they brought some talismans from the sect? They're out of stock now, aren't they? As the only Tier 2 Talisman Master in Yanji Market, I, Lai Weiquan, can craft talismans myself. Even if you buy them now and use them up, you can still come back tomorrow to buy more from me. Can their Qingxi Talisman Hall do that? How can they compare to me?"

The young man in black was about to say something, but then suddenly walked out and received a sound transmission talisman. The next moment, a look of delight appeared on his face. "Qingxi Talisman Hall has low-grade mid-tier talismans for sale again!"

After this low exclamation, the man left quickly without looking back. And the others in the shop also left one after another upon hearing this.

Lai Weiquan, the Tier 2 Talisman Master from Wind Gorge, now had a face full of suspicion. "Low-grade mid-tier talismans for sale again? Didn't he just sell out? With talismans available again in such a short time, could it be that someone from their Qingxi Sect here can actually craft low-grade mid-tier talismans? Impossible! Absolutely impossible!"

Lai Weiquan immediately shook his head, casting this thought aside. "It must be that people from the Qingxi Sect transferred talismans from other markets, or perhaps someone happened to come from the sect and brought talismans. Hmph, even so, they can't have many. Others will still return to me."

Lai Weiquan was full of confidence at this moment.

However, Lai Weiquan waited and waited, until the market closed, when only one person came to him to buy, and only bought three talismans. When he learned that Qingxi Talisman Hall had actually produced another one hundred low-grade mid-tier talismans for sale in a short period, and even announced that they would open their shop to supply talismans even on non-market days the next day...

Lai Weiquan was completely flustered. Where did Qingxi Talisman Hall get so many talismans from?

These talismans were naturally drawn by Chu Ning.

After selling the fifty talismans in several batches, Chu Ning re-entered his room. After a while, he brought out dozens more talismans. This time, he didn't have to wait long; everyone who had already received the news immediately snatched up his talismans.

However, at this point, Chu Ning chose not to continue crafting talismans. His spiritual sense couldn't recover that quickly. He did have a bottle of Spirit Nourishing Pills obtained from Qi Chongmao in his storage bag. But Chu Ning had never carefully understood the pill's effects, and even with some guesses, he didn't dare to take it lightly. So, he spread the word that talismans could be bought the next day even if it wasn't a market day, and then he closed up shop directly. He planned to use the rest of the day and the entire night to put other matters aside. He intended to cultivate his Spirit Refining Technique while crafting talismans.

However, before he could implement his plan, Du Han arrived first. When Du Han, with a grave expression, gathered everyone, Chu Ning vaguely felt that some troublesome matter was about to occur.
