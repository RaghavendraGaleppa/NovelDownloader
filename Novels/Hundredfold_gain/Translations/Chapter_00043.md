# Chapter 43: Fifth Level of Qi Refining, First-Level Body Cultivator  

Since Qi Chuan began cultivating the Minor Mystic Jade Body technique, he had mostly remained in his cave dwelling, rarely venturing out.  

He divided his training time into two main parts: one for practicing the Minor Mystic Jade Body and the other for refining his spiritual energy through the Evergreen Art. Although Qi Chuan was particularly focused on the newly acquired body cultivation, his core cultivation realm remained the foundation for reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, so he couldn’t neglect it.  

Additionally, Qi Chuan set aside a small portion of time to practice various spells, ensuring they also progressed steadily. However, given the minimal effort devoted to spell cultivation, their improvement was significantly slower compared to his spiritual energy and physical body.  

---  

Three months passed in the blink of an eye.  

On this day, inside Qi Chuan’s upper-grade cave dwelling, he sat shirtless in a large vat filled with scalding medicinal water. Only his head remained above the surface as he meditated with his eyes closed.  

As he circulated the Minor Mystic Jade Body technique, wisps of medicinal energy seeped through his pores, continuously strengthening his body. Over time, the thick, dark-red medicinal water gradually turned clear, and Qi Chuan’s physique grew increasingly robust.  

His skin shimmered with a jade-like luster, appearing in patches that flickered in and out of visibility, growing more pronounced with each passing moment.  

**Whoosh!**  

At a certain point, Qi Chuan’s eyes snapped open, a sharp glint flashing in their depths.  

**[You absorbed medicinal energy while cultivating the Minor Mystic Jade Body, triggering a hundredfold multiplier. Your physical body has been significantly enhanced. You have successfully mastered the first layer of the Minor Mystic Jade Body—Jade Skin Realm. You have advanced to the first-level early-stage body cultivator.]**  

A line of text appeared in his vision.  

Seeing this, Qi Chuan smiled faintly. He stood up, water droplets sliding off his now pristine skin. Clenching his fists, his entire body erupted in a radiant jade glow, an extraordinary sight.  

“So this is the first layer of the Minor Mystic Jade Body—Jade Skin Realm.”  

He could feel his skin’s defensive capabilities had dramatically increased. Each patch was now as resilient as a low-grade magical artifact. His muscles and tissues had also strengthened, though not as noticeably as his skin.  

“With just my physical body now, I could likely contend with an ordinary early-stage Qi Refining cultivator or a first-level low-grade demonic beast.”  

“If I continue refining this technique to perfection, reaching the peak of the first-level early-stage body cultivation, my physical body alone should rival a peak third-level Qi Refining cultivator or the strongest first-level low-grade demonic beasts!”  

Qi Chuan marveled at the potency of the Minor Mystic Jade Body.  

However, his expression soon turned rueful as he glanced at the now-clear water in the vat.  

“Another batch of medicinal energy completely exhausted.”  

This batch alone had cost him five contribution points—equivalent to fifty low-grade spirit stones. Over the past few months, after depleting the first large medicinal package, he had visited the inner sect’s alchemy pavilion twice more. Now, all his resources were gone.  

In total, mastering just the first layer of the Minor Mystic Jade Body had cost him a staggering one hundred and fifty low-grade spirit stones—and he had only reached the initial stage, far from perfection.  

Although the subsequent refinement of the first layer would require fewer resources, the sheer demand of body cultivation was already evident.  

“If the first layer is this expensive, how much more will the second or third layers cost?”  

Sighing, Qi Chuan muttered, “I’m too poor for this…”  

After tidying up the stone chamber, he moved to another room—the most spiritually dense area of his cave dwelling, where even the bed was placed to maximize cultivation efficiency.  

Sitting cross-legged on the bed, he took out a pale-green, marble-sized Essence Gathering Pill.  

“At least you’re cheaper—just one contribution point per pill,” he remarked before swallowing it.  

Closing his eyes, he began circulating the Evergreen Art. Wisps of spiritual energy flowed into his body, merging with the pill’s effects and transforming into spiritual power stored in his dantian.  

**[You cultivated the Evergreen Art, absorbing spiritual energy and refining medicinal power, triggering an eightfold multiplier. Your spiritual energy has slightly increased.]**  

Seeing the familiar notification, Qi Chuan mused, “Now that the first layer of the Minor Mystic Jade Body is complete, I should focus more on my core cultivation.”  

With that thought, he resumed his meditation.  

---  

Time flowed like water.  

Before he knew it, over a year had passed.  

On this day, Qi Chuan finally broke through to the next minor realm.  

**[You cultivated the Evergreen Art, absorbing spiritual energy and refining medicinal power, triggering a thirtyfold multiplier. Your spiritual energy has significantly increased. You have advanced to the fifth level of Qi Refining.]**  

Opening his eyes, Qi Chuan smiled as he examined his dantian. His spiritual energy reserves had expanded considerably—nearly forty percent more than before.  

“Fifth level of Qi Refining at last.”  

The breakthrough was long overdue. Since joining the inner sect of the Moonbreeze Sect, a year and a half had passed. With the aid of Essence Gathering Pills and no bottlenecks between the fourth and fifth levels, progress had been steady.  

“Though my Minor Mystic Jade Body remains at the first layer, it’s nearing perfection.”  

His skin now gleamed brilliantly with jade light, indicating he had reached the pinnacle of the Jade Skin Realm. Advancing further would require substantial resources—resources he had diverted to his core cultivation over the past year.  

“I should stabilize my spiritual energy first.”  

Just as he was about to begin consolidation, a faint tapping sound echoed from outside his cave dwelling.  

“Another message?”  

Curious, Qi Chuan walked to the entrance and retrieved an unfolded paper crane.  

*"To Brother Qi Chuan,*  

*I recently obtained a treasure map, verified to be genuine. However, the treasure site holds certain dangers beyond my ability to handle alone. I seek your assistance. If interested, please reply. Details will be shared in person.*  

*—Mu Rong Fan."*  

Qi Chuan’s eyebrows rose in surprise.  

“A treasure map? How fortuitous…”
