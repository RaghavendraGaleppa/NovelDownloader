# Chapter 31: The Art of Magic

In the main hall of Prince Shun's residence, the prince sat in the seat of honor, his expression indifferent as he gazed at Chief Secretary Li standing respectfully to the side.

"I'm disappointed by the trouble you've caused, needlessly losing Pei Xinlu," Prince Shun said solemnly.

"This humble official is at fault. Who would have expected that little bastard to have hidden experts by his side?" Li Wenfeng bowed his head, well aware of the prince's temperament.

"Pei Xinlu is already dead. According to the Dali Temple's report, they've suppressed the matter this time. If there's a next incident, it will reach my father's attention. You won't get a second chance," Prince Shun said calmly.

He didn't care about Li Wenfeng's assassination attempt—what concerned him was Pei Xinlu's death. The Dali Temple had no intention of escalating matters over a minor figure like Li Shiming.

Though the incident had caused quite a stir, as long as Li Shiming wasn't actually killed, the situation could be contained within certain limits.

Thus, Pei Xinlu had died on the way back to the Dali Temple, with the official explanation being suicide. It was a plausible story—a master who had lost both arms and legs would face a miserable existence if he survived, and his enemies would never let him live in peace.

But Prince Shun knew better. This was the Dali Temple's way of showing goodwill toward him while also issuing a warning: the matter ended here. Otherwise, given the Dali Temple's expertise in handling prisoners, how could Pei Xinlu have possibly been given the opportunity to kill himself? Or perhaps his death wasn't suicide at all.

"This humble official has caused trouble for Your Highness," Li Wenfeng replied, still bowing his head.

"I'm no fan of Li Wenyuan either. Use the prince's residence's connections to make things difficult for that boy. Now leave," Prince Shun said, waving his hand dismissively.

"As you command, Your Highness," Li Wenfeng replied before withdrawing from the hall.

His eyes burned with murderous intent, yet he understood that the best opportunity had been lost. Another attempt on Li Shiming's life was now impossible. His grudge was against Li Wenyuan—he wouldn't sacrifice his own future just to deal with a junior like Li Shiming.

The reason he had acted on the very night of Li Shiming's arrival in the capital was precisely because news of the young man's presence hadn't yet spread. Killing him then would have had the least impact. Once Li Shiming visited Li Wenyuan's friends—especially after taking the imperial examinations and becoming a scholar—the consequences of assassination would have been far more severe.

The official world had its own rules. Oppression and framing were acceptable, but assassination was forbidden. If everyone resorted to killing, the entire bureaucracy would descend into chaos.

Not long after seeing off the Dali Temple's vice minister, Li Shiming received news of Pei Xinlu's death.

His expression darkened. It seemed his father's connections in the capital weren't reliable after all. Perhaps the vice minister had once been his father's friend, but people changed over time.
