# Chapter 200: Heavenly Venerate Artifact

Zhou Tian was dumbfounded, wanting nothing more than to curse. Three sets of exuviae? He remembered clearly: Puzhi had said that the sealed attacks of these remains would grow stronger as Wutian's cultivation increased.

What realm was Wutian? Heavenly Venerate! Three Heavenly Venerates? What the hell were they supposed to fight?!

To this day, Zhou Tian hadn't even seen the true face of a single Heavenly Venerate. It was a realm beyond description. But since the Star Realm extolled Heavenly Venerates so highly, there must be a reason. They were an entirely new life form, fundamentally different from what came before.

On their side, only he had a few dozen seconds of Heavenly Venerate time. The opponents, however, were three individuals, not a crippled Dao Lord like Yuan Chi who could be obliterated by his skill-enhanced divine abilities. At that point, they might as well just surrender. He wouldn't die, though. With luck, if he died a hundred times in this place, he might even acquire some world-traveling skill. Otherwise, he'd just be stuck here until the world ended or his mind collapsed.

"Benefactor, do not panic. Innumerable years have passed since my master's nirvana. Without the replenishment of vital energy, those exuviae no longer possess the divine might they had in their prime. Now, at most, they only have the strength of a Half-Step Heavenly Venerate," Puzhi slowly said.

"Master, can't you just say everything at once?"

Zhou Tian breathed a sigh of relief. If that was the case, it wasn't so bad. Although Half-Step Heavenly Venerates were powerful, they still fell within the Dao Lord category. Huang Qi came from the Frontier Prison, and the Saint Demon was no simple opponent either. They might still have a chance to fight.

"However, the endless blood river of this human skin book can provide them with replenishment. At that time, they might very well revert to their Heavenly Venerate realm for a period," Puzhi said again.

Zhou Tian looked at Puzhi with a resentful gaze. "Master, can't you just finish your sentences?"

"Is there any hidden passage to secretly slip out of this place?" Zhou Tian quietly asked.

"Why does Benefactor ask?" Puzhi's eyes held a strange look.

"Of course, it's to leave quickly before those three sets of exuviae arrive. We don't have much desire for this human skin. Those are three Heavenly Venerates; running away is the ultimate strategy," Zhou Tian said, completely forgetting his previous talk about tempering oneself between life and death. He could indeed revive, but if he were trapped in this world, he would go mad.

"Benefactor, do not be so pessimistic. Heavenly Venerates are merely cultivators who have walked a bit further on the path of cultivation. There is no need to fear them so much. Moreover, without Master as their main body, even if they reach the Heavenly Venerate realm, they will lack some of the unique powers Heavenly Venerates possess." Puzhi shook his head and smiled, looking as if he had everything under control.

"Then, Master, can you defeat them?"

"No." Puzhi honestly shook his head.

Then what the hell were you talking about? Zhou Tian shook his head, speechless.

"However, this place is, after all, my master's nirvana site, and as his disciple, I naturally possess some trump cards he left behind," Puzhi said, his bald head gleaming brightly as he spoke in an unhurried tone.

"Can they deal with three Heavenly Venerates?" Zhou Tian asked.

"Barely enough to handle two."

"Oh, then what about the third one?" Zhou Tian's eyes flickered as he asked.

"For that, we will have to rely on Benefactor." Puzhi pressed his palms together, bowed slightly, and saluted Zhou Tian.

"Master, that's a Heavenly Venerate! What are you relying on me for? To cheer you on?" Zhou Tian couldn't help but laugh.

"Benefactor, this place is my master's nirvana site. I possess special means to monitor this area, so everything you have done these past few days has been under my surveillance."

"I know Benefactor is someone with great fortune. If I were still alive, I might covet your opportunities, but I have been gone for countless years. Now, I only wish to truly bury those who once followed my master." Puzhi laid all his cards on the table, looking at Zhou Tian with genuine eyes.

"Master, this..." Zhou Tian was still somewhat hesitant. Although he could reach the Heavenly Venerate realm for a period, it was only for a short time, and there were no benefits involved. It would be a complete waste of effort.

"My master once had a Buddhist Wheel. It is a Heavenly Venerate artifact. After this matter is concluded, it can be bestowed upon Benefactor," Puzhi added calmly.

"Desecrating the dead is a crime punishable by all! I'll take care of this matter, even if it means sacrificing my own life!" Zhou Tian declared passionately, then quietly asked, "Master, that treasure isn't damaged, is it? Don't misunderstand, I'm just curious."

"Benefactor, rest assured. That Buddhist Wheel's primary function is assistance, not offense, so it was not damaged during the ancient war."

"Then, could you let me have a look? Don't misunderstand, I'm just purely curious to see it."

"No problem." Puzhi smiled, not minding Zhou Tian's words. Why would others help you without benefit? Not helping was their prerogative. Only a transaction offered true peace of mind.

He changed his posture, pressed his palms together, and chanted softly, as if reciting scriptures.

"Buddha..."

A deep, ancient Buddhist chant echoed, evoking a sense of primeval vastness. Above the ancient city, Buddhist light soared into the sky, its radiant glow cascading down, causing the Yin Soldiers to hastily retreat. Wisps of bloody mist drifted from the endless crimson river, evaporated by the Buddhist light. Through the shimmering light, a colossal Buddhist Wheel was vaguely seen hovering in the sky, like a sun, illuminating the entire ancient city by several shades.

The colossal Buddhist Wheel trembled continuously in the sky. An invisible sound wave surged like a terrifying tide. A ray of Buddhist light enveloped Monk Puzhi, who, despite his blood-stained robes, appeared solemn and dignified. He sat cross-legged on the ground, palms pressed together in homage to Buddha. His previous melancholy expression was gone, replaced by an unparalleled serenity and ethereal grace.

Within the Buddhist light, Monk Puzhi slowly floated up from the ground. He sat cross-legged in the void, and around him, a colossal Buddha statue materialized. The vast and ancient aura emanated precisely from this dimly visible giant Buddha. From afar, Monk Puzhi appeared to be sitting on one of the ancient Buddha's massive hands. Although his monastic robes were long since stained crimson with blood, his entire being was ethereal, as if a true Buddha had been reborn, exuding an aura of peace and compassion.

"Wutian, My Buddha!"

After a long while, Puzhi uttered a Buddhist invocation, slowly opened his eyes. The giant Buddha vanished, the Buddhist light dissipated, and everything once again returned to silence.

"This was merely me awakening a trace of the Buddhist Wheel's spiritual essence, not fully activating it. Doing so would cause me to dissipate. Does Benefactor have any other questions?" Puzhi spoke, a few more traces of ancient weariness appearing in his eyes, as if he had comprehended something new within the Buddhist light.

"No, no more." Zhou Tian swallowed hard. As expected of a complete Heavenly Venerate artifact, just a trace of its spiritual essence held such power. What would happen if it were fully activated? It was utterly incomparable to a damaged Heavenly Venerate artifact.
