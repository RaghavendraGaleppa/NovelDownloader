# Chapter 83: The Completely Disheveled Ice Block, Punishment Begins Tomorrow

The vastness of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands held countless wonders. But this was merely a ranking for the Eastern Barren Region. It didn't include the Great Yu Dynasty, nor those transcendent great sects; it was merely a corner of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

In that instant, Ying Bing's mind went blank.

However, the system would not cease its operations due to her bewilderment and confusion.

[Eastern Barren Region Heavenly Talent Ranking, First Place: Li Mo.] The remaining words silently appeared.

"Li... Mo?"

These two characters were seared into Ying Bing's eyes, stirring up a tempest in her heart. Unconsciously, the image of the young man with his gentle, refreshing demeanor, his busy figure in the kitchen, and his trusting words on Clear Abyss Peak resurfaced in her mind.

How could it be him? How *could* it be him?

Indeed, Li Mo had changed significantly from the person she once knew. His temperament had improved, making him as pleasant as a spring breeze. His talent had soared, granting him the qualification to discuss the sword dao with her, and he had even obtained some kind of legacy.

But... he had just lost to her today!

On the arena, Ying Bing hadn't actually been entirely serious; she mostly wanted to see the extent of his true strength. The result had certainly been surprising enough. However, Li Mo's strength was clearly still a considerable distance behind hers.

Furthermore, ever since they entered the Clear Abyss Sect, they had been together day and night. Under her very nose, she hadn't seen him encounter any further fortuitous circumstances. In the same realm, perhaps there were individuals who could rival her, but they were all renowned figures.

Why? Why was it him?

At this moment, the young man's figure was shrouded in a thick veil of mystery. The air seemed to solidify. Ying Bing's emotions were a strange mix: shock, confusion, doubt, unwillingness...

So this was what it felt like to be surpassed by someone?

[Comparison concluded. Rewards are being issued.]
[Host ranked second.]
[Reward One: Three bottles of Emperor's Nectar.]
[Reward Two: One True Phoenix Feather.]
[Reward Three: One Cold Marrow Jade Bed.]

All of the system's rewards were extremely rare treasures, and they happened to be perfectly suited for her use, making them incredibly precious.

Take the Emperor's Nectar, for example. This was the essence of heaven and earth, born from the sky and scattered upon landing. Plants that absorbed it became spirits, exotic beasts that consumed it gained intelligence, and humans who took it would have their bodies cleansed, advancing their martial dao at an incredible pace. Every sixty years, Emperor's Nectar would descend in certain parts of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. As for its exact location, only the Heavenly Deduction Sect knew. Therefore, this item was rarely possessed by anyone outside the Heavenly Deduction Sect.

Then there was the True Phoenix Feather. True Phoenixes, True Dragons—these few species were once the rulers of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Even now, they remained extremely rare, and each appearance was invariably accompanied by immense heavenly destiny. In the ethereal realm, heaven and earth had their own rules. Neither phoenixes nor true dragons were allowed to exist simultaneously in numbers exceeding nine. Of course, often the total number of these auspicious beasts wouldn't even exceed the count of one hand. A phoenix feather was its natal object. Once integrated into one's body, it could grant numerous divine abilities, similar to a true dragon's reverse scale. Compared to true dragons, the phoenix lineage was even rarer, having been extinct in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands for a long time.

As for the final reward, the Cold Marrow Jade Bed, she had owned one in her previous life while in the Cassia Palace. Lying on it, her cultivation efforts would be twice as effective.

Undoubtedly, these rewards were not ordinary even for her in her previous life.

But...

[Detected that the host has activated the 'Loser's Punishment'.]
[The system will temporarily hold all rewards, and will only issue them once the host has fulfilled the punishment conditions.]
[If the challenge fails, the system will automatically unbind, and all rewards will be destroyed.]
[Current punishment condition: Share a bed with the person who surpassed you for one month.]
[Starting tomorrow, the challenge begins.]

A complex mix of emotions surged within her. Ying Bing stared blankly at the rewards and punishment conditions. When she chose to increase the rewards and activate the challenge, she had never imagined that there would truly be a day when she would be punished. Due to her intense emotional fluctuations, the suppressed Taiyin energy within her temporarily lost control. The room grew increasingly cold, so cold that one's thoughts ceased, and ideas solidified.

Her eyelashes, dusted with ice crystals, fluttered lightly, and her eyelids finally closed heavily. Ying Bing's consciousness plunged into darkness, sinking into a dream.

........

In her dream. Above a vast, boundless ocean, no sun, moon, or stars were visible. Only raging thunder danced, painting the world in stark black and white. Towering waves surged, forming an endless vortex that swallowed everything, leaving no trace.

Vaguely, Ying Bing remembered having been here before. Guixu, the Return to Emptiness. In her previous life, she had searched for it extensively. It was the last place in the world rumored to hold the opportunity for immortal ascension, and also where many legendary figures, including the Martial Emperor, the Great Ancestor of the Yu Dynasty, had ultimately vanished without a trace.

[Those who wish to become immortals, enter here to undergo tribulation.] This was the only thing present on the sea surface: a massive stone tablet, towering into the clouds.

She had been here. And she had come with the other eight from the Nine Heavens. Together, they had slain the guardian of Guixu and collectively entered the path to immortality within. But... she had failed.

At this moment, Ying Bing finally remembered the reason for her failure in undergoing tribulation: "A flaw in the heart."

.........

Morning. Sitting on a prayer mat that had hardened with frost, Li Mo slowly exhaled, the corners of his mouth unconsciously curling upwards. He was immersing his mind in his dantian. Within his dantian, the internal energy, which was originally as thin as a strand of hair, had now grown tenfold. If dispersed, it could fill his entire dantian. With a thought, the internal energy would gather, disperse, or transform into various shapes according to his will.

Li Mo pushed open the door and walked to the frozen lake, punching downwards. His pervasive internal energy penetrated the thick layer of ice. A moment later, he gently tossed a stone onto the ice. *Crack, crack, crack—* The frozen stream instantly disintegrated, flowing once more.

"Not bad," Li Mo remarked with satisfaction. If it were before, he probably would have had to exert some effort to achieve this, right?

"The ice block isn't up yet?" Li Mo cast a curious glance at the upstairs room. Normally, Ying Bing would definitely be sitting at the stone table, drinking tea, by this time. However, after seeing the state of Autumn Water Pavilion, he felt relieved. With such a commotion last night, she probably needed some time to rest.

"Huh?" Shang Wu emerged, her almond-shaped eyes narrowed, scratching her flawless, fragrant shoulder, looking dazed. Seeing the scene in the courtyard, she looked bewildered.

"It's the ice block," Li Mo said casually.

"Oh, oh." Shang Wu nodded lazily, then stomped her foot on the ground. A furnace-like warmth swept forth. The beautiful master, acting as a little sun, was exceptionally effective. She then turned her gaze towards her precious disciple.

"Uh? Master, do you need something?" Li Mo asked, puzzled.

"Cough! From today onwards, this master will diligently instruct you!" Yesterday, the elders held a criticism session for her. Several elders were emotionally agitated, accusing her of being unworthy of being a teacher. Shang Wu thought about it and realized they were right. She had basically left her disciple to his own devices for almost a month! As a master, she really should properly teach her disciple something. If she had guided Li Mo earlier, perhaps her precious disciple wouldn't have lost to Ying Bing. Which then led to her losing so much money. So, starting today, she decided to earnestly instruct her precious disciple, helping him enter the Internal Energy Realm sooner. For this, she even specially went to the scripture pavilion to review texts on how to break through the Blood Qi Realm. After all, she had broken through while drunk, she couldn't possibly expect her precious disciple to imitate her.

Shang Wu was rarely this serious. "Today, I'll teach you how to condense internal energy."

"But Master, I'm already in the Internal Energy Realm."

"Your grandma's!"
