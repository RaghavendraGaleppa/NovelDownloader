# Chapter 26: The Eternal Cataclysm! The Golden Ark of Salvation!

Inside the Hall of Spiritual Officials, Li Zhengjing wore a complicated expression.

Before him, a deformed bird wailed with tearful grievances, recounting its tragic and pitiful experiences.

"Master, how could you leave me behind when you left the other night?"

"Let's go back. I want to see the scenery at the Thunder Prison Forbidden Ground in the back mountain. It's not that I want to die—I just want to know if the view is any good."

The voice was gentle and delicate, yet it carried the tone of a ghostly wail, filled with sorrow and despair.

Li Zhengjing's expression grew even more complicated. The Hanging Wall Bird's voice was no longer childish but had transformed into something as soft as water, as clear as a babbling brook. 

If one ignored the fact that it was a bird, the voice alone was quite pleasant to hear.

Moreover, the Hanging Wall Bird had undergone significant changes. Its body had grown larger, appearing more majestic and fierce. Its wings were slender, with bones protruding from their tips, sharp as blades. Its talons were covered in scales, exuding a chilling aura. Even its beak had become longer and sharper, exuding a deadly edge. A row of bony spikes now ran along its back, sharp and intimidating.

Just as Li Zhengjing was marveling at these changes, a claw lifted the door curtain.

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official stepped out, his legs resembling those of an eagle. Each step he took sounded like the clashing of metal.

"Master, take me away! Quick, let's go!" the Hanging Wall Bird shrieked. "If we don't leave now, it'll be too late—"

Li Zhengjing remained rooted in place, not responding. Though it wasn't yet dark, there was no way he could leave under the watchful gaze of the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official.

"Stop screeching. I gave you such a pleasant voice for nothing," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official chided, holding a sharp horn in his hand, its aura still palpable and intimidating.

His golden pupils fixed on the Hanging Wall Bird as he said, "A complete transformation requires all these elements to be implanted in you. As you grow, they'll grow with you. A little pain is normal..."

With a wave of his hand, the Hanging Wall Bird landed in his palm. He comforted it, "Just one last step. Bear with it. This time, the process is simple—I'll just split your skull open, carve a hole in it—making sure not to touch your brain—then implant this dragon horn, fuse it, reconnect all the meridians, and finally apply some medicine. It'll be over soon."

"A dragon horn?" Li Zhengjing's gaze fell on the sharp horn.

"I just polished it. The size is perfect," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official said, turning to Li Zhengjing with a "kindly" smile. "The White Phoenix is a rare and blessed bloodline, hailed as the descendant of an auspicious divine bird. But my research shows that its back and head lack protection, making them glaring weaknesses. So, I planted a row of spikes on its back and a dragon horn on its head to compensate."

Li Zhengjing felt a chill run down his spine. But then he remembered something and took out the crucial "Boarding Token," presenting it with a respectful bow.

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official's smile grew even more amused. "This thing is quite a treasure. You're not keeping it?"

*Keeping it would be courting death!* Li Zhengjing thought to himself. Outwardly, he smiled and said, "I only know that this object is impervious to fire and water, unbreakable by blades, and indestructible. But I don't know its true purpose. In my hands, it's like a pearl cast before swine. Since you, esteemed elder, are interested in it, it's only right that I offer it to you with both hands!"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official weighed the token in his hand. "If I take this, you might feel like I've robbed you of a great opportunity."

Before Li Zhengjing could respond, the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official continued, "I can tell you the purpose of this token. After hearing it, you can decide whether to keep it or give it to me."

Li Zhengjing immediately adopted a posture of attentive listening.

"This object is called the Boarding Token, but it's commonly known as the Boarding Pass."

"Boarding Pass?"

"You come from an immortal sect. Have you heard of the Golden Ark of Salvation?"

"I'm afraid I haven't."

"The Golden Ark of Salvation originates from an ancient legend recorded in old texts."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official's eyes grew distant as he spoke slowly, "In ancient times, calamities struck the world—thunderstorms, floods, tsunamis, earthquakes. Mortals were like ants, and even immortals struggled to protect themselves."

"Finally, the celestial beings joined forces to build the Golden Ark of Salvation, sailing through myriad realms to escape the cataclysms."

"Of course, that's just an ancient legend."

"The Golden Ark of Salvation?" The Hanging Wall Bird looked puzzled. "I come from a noble lineage, well-read and versed in classics. How have I never heard of this ancient legend?"

"How many books have you read?" the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official asked.

"I've studied for three years—nearly ten books!" The Hanging Wall Bird raised its head proudly.

"..."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official fell silent for a moment, his eyes filled with disdain.

He ignored the bird and turned back to Li Zhengjing. "Thirteen hundred years ago, a human immortal declared that there were no true immortals in the heavens and that ascension was a lie. He rallied cultivators from all sides, seeking to emulate the ancient legend and build the Golden Ark of Salvation."

"Did they succeed?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"They're still building it," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official replied.

"Still building?" Li Zhengjing was stunned, his eyes widening in disbelief.

A human immortal from over a thousand years ago had begun constructing the Golden Ark of Salvation, and even now, after all this time, it was still being built?

"He proclaimed himself the 'Heavenly Venerable of Salvation Through Tribulations,' but he eventually perished, his lifespan exhausted by the passage of time."

"Yet, to build the Golden Ark of Salvation, he gathered countless cultivators, forming a vast organization that persists to this day, its beliefs still alive."

"Now, the leader of the Golden Ark of Salvation is the third-generation Heavenly Venerable of Salvation Through Tribulations."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official pointed at the Boarding Token in Li Zhengjing's hand. "As for this Boarding Pass, the followers of the Golden Ark of Salvation see it as a chance to ascend to immortality. But in reality, it's just a token that allows one to board the ark and become a mere 'deckhand.'"

"A deckhand?" Li Zhengjing murmured. "Was the evil cultivator I captured last night a deckhand under the Golden Ark of Salvation?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official shook his head. "In the hierarchy of the Golden Ark of Salvation, he was a 'Drowned Ghost.'"

Li Zhengjing frowned. "What's a 'Drowned Ghost'?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official chuckled, his eyes filled with mockery.

"A Drowned Ghost is a lost soul drifting aimlessly beneath the water, gazing enviously at the living beings on the deck, longing to board the ark."

"While the deckhands of the Golden Ark of Salvation live freely, the Drowned Ghosts are left to suffer the calamities of the mortal world."

"If you hold this Boarding Pass for too long, you'll be branded by the Golden Ark of Salvation and become a Drowned Ghost."

"Moreover, the cultivation methods of the Golden Ark of Salvation have spread far and wide. Anyone who practices them will be branded and turned into a Drowned Ghost."

"Of course, in the eyes of the Golden Ark of Salvation, all beings who haven't boarded the ark—including you and me—are Drowned Ghosts, drowning in the sea of tribulations."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official's voice was laced with sarcasm.

"So, a true Drowned Ghost bears the mark of the ark—meaning they're cursed?" Li Zhengjing feigned contemplation.

"Correct," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official confirmed. "Without the Boarding Pass, they'll eventually perish, their souls scattered. Only with the pass can they barely cling to life."

"For a Drowned Ghost, even with the Boarding Pass, unless they truly board the ark, they'll never attain freedom."

"Their only path is to board the ark and seek survival."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official lowered his voice. "No one knows how many Drowned Ghosts exist in the world—those who practice the ark's methods or are branded by the pass."

Li Zhengjing was astonished. "So, obtaining their 'token' or their techniques automatically makes you one of them?"

The Hanging Wall Bird gasped. "Isn't that just tricking people into joining them? How is that any different from the demonic sects of the Hundred Thousand Mountains?"

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official spread his dragon-like claws. "The Golden Ark of Salvation *is* the greatest demonic sect in the world."

"Eight hundred years ago, the second Heavenly Venerable of Salvation Through Tribulations scattered the Boarding Passes far and wide and spread the ark's cultivation methods, creating countless Drowned Ghosts."

"At their peak, you couldn't tell whether the person beside you was human or ghost."

"Elders and disciples of immortal sects, kings and generals of the mortal world, even common peddlers—anyone could unknowingly become a Drowned Ghost of the Golden Ark of Salvation."

"And without exception, all Drowned Ghosts, if they survived, would eventually seek to board the ark, desperate to join the Golden Ark of Salvation."

"Both orthodox immortal sects and demonic factions found their foundations shaken by the Golden Ark of Salvation."

"Finally, the sects of the world united to suppress the chaos, slay the second Heavenly Venerable, destroy all collected Boarding Passes, and burn every last copy of the ark's cultivation methods."

"But the source of the Golden Ark of Salvation remains. Some Boarding Passes and cultivation methods slipped through the cracks, so Drowned Ghosts could never be fully eradicated."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official added calmly, "Seventeen years ago, when Mount Fengdu in the north collapsed, unleashing a million demons, the three great immortal sects mobilized to suppress them. Behind it all, the shadow of the Golden Ark of Salvation loomed."

Li Zhengjing was deeply shaken. After a long silence, he finally steadied himself and asked, "How many Boarding Passes exist in the world?"

"Though the number of Drowned Ghosts is incalculable, as far as I know, when the Golden Ark of Salvation was being built, roughly nine thousand Boarding Passes were forged."

Li Zhengjing's eyes cleared. "So, the ark can hold about ten thousand people?"

"Approximately."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official glanced at the token in Li Zhengjing's hand and smiled. "If the Heavenly Venerable of Salvation Through Tribulations' beliefs are correct, then the Golden Ark of Salvation is the only 'immortal realm' where one can attain true freedom."

His smile grew eerie as he took a step closer. "So, do you still want to give this to me?"

Li Zhengjing focused inward, checking the golden page's prediction of his fate. Instantly, he knew his choice.

With both hands, he presented the token. "Esteemed elder, please accept this."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official didn't take it immediately. "No second thoughts?"

Li Zhengjing said firmly, "I have no desire to live as a Drowned Ghost, dependent on a Boarding Pass. Nor do I wish to be bound for life by the illusory Golden Ark of Salvation."

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official took the token, tucked it into the wound on his abdomen beneath his robe, and then looked at Li Zhengjing. "In that case, how about I bestow upon you a divine ability?"
