# Chapter 164: The Golden Edict

After reading all the letters from his friends, Lin Shan stood frozen in place, utterly bewildered. The three demonic sects had been in an overwhelmingly advantageous position—how could they have collapsed so suddenly?

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord had been active during these past ten years and was generally aware of the frontline situation. Having grown familiar with Lin Shan's subordinates, he proceeded to explain everything he knew.

...

A decade ago, shortly after Lin Shan began his secluded cultivation in the East Sea, the heartland of the Great Song Dynasty was swept by turbulent events. The demonic Black Lotus Sect captured the dynasty's capital, Bianliang, in one fell swoop, shaking the entire realm. The immediate aftermath saw the morale of righteous cultivators defending the other fronts of the Falling Pine Mountains collapse entirely. With their rear already breached, resistance at the frontlines became meaningless.

This triggered a cascading collapse—the northern and southern battlefronts were successively overrun. The Blood River Hall and Hundred Ghosts Sect surged into the western regions, eventually joining forces with the Black Lotus Sect in Bianliang.

At this point, the three demonic sects were at the peak of their power, their forces swelling like a rolling snowball. Various rogue cultivators and subordinate factions flocked to their banners, amassing an army of over 300,000 outside Bianliang.

As the saying goes, "Pursue the tottering foe relentlessly rather than rest on hollow fame." Although this exact verse didn't exist in this world, similar proverbs were abundant. The ancient monsters leading the demonic coalition were no fools.

After extensive discussions among their leadership, they unanimously agreed that "cutting off one finger is better than injuring ten." They decided to concentrate all their forces for a decisive strike—marching straight to the Violet Firmament Sect's mountain gates to annihilate this leading righteous sect once and for all.

Meanwhile, the northern Sky Cloud Pavilion was pinned down by the Yellow Springs Sect advancing from the Great Yan Kingdom, while the southern Beast Taming Valley was obstructed by the southern sea's Rain Hermitage Sect. Neither could spare forces for reinforcements—this was a once-in-a-millennium opportunity for the demonic path.

Once the Violet Firmament Sect, responsible for the central theater, was destroyed, the Sky Cloud Pavilion and Beast Taming Valley would be severed from each other, forced to fight isolated battles. Wouldn't the three demonic sects then have free rein?

Within a month of this decision, the demonic army besieged the Violet Firmament Sect, surrounding this millennia-old supreme sect completely.

The Violet Firmament Sect's Nascent Soul elders and thirty-six peak masters stood their ground, relying on their sect's ancient protective formation—continuously reinforced over ten thousand years—to make a last stand against the demonic onslaught.

It must be said that the Violet Firmament Sect's mountain-protecting formation was absurdly powerful. Generations of patriarchs had painstakingly relocated spiritual veins, erecting thirty-six spiritual mountains to establish thirty-six legacies of the Dao. Each peak had its own protective formation, and when all were combined, they recreated the renowned "Heavenly Dipper Formation" of the cultivation world.

Despite relentless assaults by the demonic hordes day and night, the united Violet Firmament disciples defended flawlessly. Not only did they repeatedly repel attacks, but they also exploited the formation's flexibility to launch nightly raids on the enemy camps.

After half a year of brutal siege, the demonic forces found their casualties unbearable. Continuing this way, they risked annihilation before ever breaching the Violet Firmament defenses.

However, the three demonic sects were replete with experts and strategists. The coalition command immediately selected eight thousand formation masters from their 300,000 troops to establish the "Calculation Battalion."

These formation masters represented countless schools—some specialized in terrain analysis, others in celestial phenomena, Five Elements and Eight Trigrams, or mystical divination techniques. Schools included the Mountain Shape, Image, Form, Fate, Five Elements, Star Constellations, and Six Harmonies factions.

Once formed, the Calculation Battalion systematically dismantled the formations, sometimes altering terrain to redirect spiritual veins, dramatically boosting the demonic offensive.

The Violet Firmament Sect, feeling the pressure, hastily assembled their own formation masters to counter. The two sides engaged in a deadly game of chess, their battles turning heaven and earth upside down, leaving rivers of blood in their wake.

While the formation masters reveled in their contest, ordinary cultivators suffered as cannon fodder, dying in droves during constant trial-and-error assaults. The demonic coalition could afford such losses, but the Violet Firmament Sect couldn't.

In desperation, they formed a special task force to assassinate the Calculation Battalion, but the demonic elders anticipated this, ambushing the squad the moment they ventured out. The outcome was predictable—another devastating loss for the Violet Firmament Sect.

...

Thus, the two sides fought a protracted war of attrition for five full years.

During this time, the Violet Firmament Sect's expenditure on maintaining their formation drained astronomical amounts of spirit stones, exhausting millennia of accumulated resources, nearly depleting their foundational reserves.

Yet under the demonic coalition's relentless human-wave tactics and the Calculation Battalion's persistent efforts, the Violet Firmament Sect's ten-thousand-year-old formation was finally breached.

Demon cultivators swarmed into the mountain gates, unleashing a cataclysmic battle!

However formidable the Violet Firmament Sect was, it couldn't withstand the combined might of three demonic sects. As their defenses crumbled and their legacy faced extinction, the thirty-six peak disciples activated their final trump card.

From the ancestral hall's memorial tablets emerged the sixth patriarch's legacy—a Golden Edict left before his ascension.

This edict was said to be a manuscript left by the sixth patriarch, a peerless genius who, upon transcending tribulation to ascend to the upper realm, expressed gratitude to his sect by leaving this final gift. It was to be used only when the sect faced existential crisis.

True to the patriarch's instructions, the elders had waited until the brink of annihilation before unveiling this artifact. For activating it would consume nearly eighty percent of the spiritual veins beneath the thirty-six peaks—the very lifeblood painstakingly accumulated by generations of predecessors.

Losing eighty percent of their spiritual veins would devastate the sect's foundation—equivalent to self-destruction. The mountain's spiritual energy would plummet, cultivation paradises would collapse, rare herb gardens would wither, and the protective formation would become useless without spiritual vein support. Future disciples would struggle to break through bottlenecks without this vital resource.

But facing annihilation, the Violet Firmament Sect chose mutual destruction.

When activated by the mountain's spiritual veins, the Golden Edict triggered celestial phenomena. Golden lightning serpents danced across the sky, forming a thunderous ocean spanning thousands of miles. A golden lightning pool manifested in the highest heavens, unleashing an inverted river of tribulation lightning that shook heaven and earth.

This divine technique, derived from the sect's treasured "Violet Qi Heart Sutra"—a lightning tribulation art none had mastered in ten thousand years—struck demonic cultivators with precision. The higher one's cultivation, the more devastating the lightning.

When the edict's power finally dissipated, nine demonic Nascent Soul elders had been struck—three perished in the tribulation, six suffered severe injuries. The demonic hordes were decimated, with nearly half their forces dead or wounded.

Yet over 100,000 demonic troops remained, still holding overwhelming numerical superiority. Had the six injured Nascent Soul elders committed to a final push, victory might still have been possible.

But demonic cultivators were inherently selfish and distrustful, especially those who'd clawed their way to Nascent Soul through betrayal and bloodshed. Now severely wounded, none were willing to risk their lives for collective victory.

At full strength, the six could have easily crushed the Violet Firmament Sect. But injured, each feared being the one to fall first. Cooperation was impossible.

The result? The six demonic elders fled in different directions. The Violet Firmament Sect's four Nascent Soul elders pursued, killing two more on the spot. Only the Black Lotus Sect's Discipline Dharma King, the Blood River Hall's Fourth Hall Master, and the Hundred Ghosts Sect's Second Elder escaped.

The Black Lotus Sect's Guardian Dharma King—reportedly the most powerful—had been suppressing his cultivation to avoid tribulation. Targeted by the lightning pool, he was forced to abandon his physical body and flee as a Nascent Soul.

Seeing their leaders dead or fleeing, the remaining demonic forces panicked and scattered. The Violet Firmament disciples launched a desperate counterattack, slaughtering countless enemies in their retreat.

...

In this single battle, the demonic path lost five Nascent Soul elders. The Guardian Dharma King's Nascent Soul whereabouts remained unknown, while other elders vanished—perhaps hunted by Violet Firmament pursuers or hiding to recover. None resurfaced.

Over half their Golden Core protectors perished. The three demonic sect leaders, attempting to preserve their forces during the retreat, became primary targets. Already weakened by the lightning tribulation, they were hunted down at great cost by the Violet Firmament Sect.

With their leadership decimated and command structure collapsed, the demonic coalition fragmented into disorganized remnants.

Though the Violet Firmament Sect's mountain gates were nearly destroyed and their foundations severely damaged, their Nascent Soul combatants remained—now outnumbering the demonic alliance.

Over the next six months, the Violet Firmament Sect gradually recovered, rallying western minor sects and clans. Riding the momentum of their victory, they reclaimed Bianliang and all territories west of the Falling Pine Mountains, pushing the frontline back to its original position.

When the three surviving demonic Nascent Souls eventually reappeared to regroup their forces, they launched several major campaigns. But lacking numerical superiority and with their forces demoralized, they suffered repeated defeats, forced into defensive positions.

Seeking time to recover, the demonic sects proposed partitioning the Great Song Dynasty along historical borders—a peace offer immediately rejected when the Violet Firmament Sect executed their envoys.

"Pursue the tottering foe relentlessly rather than rest on hollow fame"—this principle now guided the righteous factions. They consolidated their forces at the Falling Pine Mountains, training troops while awaiting reinforcements from their northern and southern allies before further expansion.

Meanwhile, the demonic sects' strongest had been decimated by the tribulation, while weaker members fell to years of righteous pursuit. Only those of middling strength and sharp wits survived.

The tide had turned completely.

...

"So the demonic factions, once dominant, are now on the defensive after the Violet Firmament Sect's counterattack," Lin Shan mused as the Black Skeleton Demon Lord concluded his account, finally grasping the weight of a decade's passage.

From age sixteen when he left the Lin family until twenty-three, he'd never undergone such prolonged seclusion. Ten years might be a fleeting moment for cultivators, but in war—especially the rapid-paced conflicts of the cultivation world where flight allowed traversing thousands of miles daily—it could completely reverse fortunes.

The demonic coalition had conquered half the Great Song in six months, taking Bianliang in a fortnight. That they'd managed to hold any territory after such a catastrophic defeat—without a formation like the Violet Firmament Sect's—was astonishing.

What frustrated Lin Shan was that right before seclusion, he'd just completed the sect leader's trial and stood on the verge of rising through the ranks. Now, emerging a decade later, not only had the demonic path suffered devastating losses, but his potential new patron—the sect leader—had also perished!

Lin Shan grimaced, realizing he'd have to rely on Protector Yan's patronage instead. At least he'd withdrawn from Bianliang before the Violet Firmament campaign—a battle that had claimed countless demonic experts, including five Nascent Souls and most Golden Core cultivators.

The Black Lotus Sect's pillar, the Guardian Dharma King, had lost his physical form, his Nascent Soul's fate unknown.

Currently, the demonic factions had been expelled from the west, barely clinging to half the territory and the East Sea while resisting the righteous alliance. With fewer Nascent Souls, they could only defend, not attack—unless the main sect in Lu Country sent reinforcements.

Sitting in his courtyard, Lin Shan concluded that consolidating his recent breakthrough took priority. The heavens might be collapsing, but taller figures would bear the weight.

Having just broken through to early Foundation Establishment and advanced a quarter into mid-stage thanks to the Purple Dust Elixir, he needed to stabilize his cultivation before this excess progress dissipated.

As for the war, joining now would only make him cannon fodder. His presence wouldn't tip the scales.

...

Lin Shan then reviewed the letter from Lin Fan, which mentioned his earlier inquiry about the founder of the "Wind Thunder Art"—Ouyang Feng, an exiled Violet Firmament disciple.

Lin Fan's research confirmed that a thousand years ago, a true disciple named Ouyang Feng had indeed trespassed into the ancestral hall to secretly study the "Violet Qi Heart Sutra." Caught by elders, this caused an uproar, as righteous sects strictly controlled access to their core techniques.

Under pressure, the sect leader had Ouyang Feng's cultivation crippled and exiled. Yet against all odds, Ouyang Feng rebuilt his foundation from scratch, reaching Nascent Soul as a rogue cultivator within two centuries and gaining renown across the Great Song.

When the Violet Firmament Sect attempted to recruit him back, Ouyang Feng deliberately avoided them, leaving the Great Song never to return.

The letter ended abruptly here—Lin Fan could uncover no more.

"What an extraordinary individual," Lin Shan murmured. "To rise from nothing to Nascent Soul in two centuries... With his wind and lightning spiritual roots, if he created corresponding techniques, he might have left behind matching divine abilities."

Setting this matter aside for future investigation, Lin Shan spent the following period consolidating his cultivation while having the Black Skeleton Demon Lord gather further intelligence.
