# Chapter 39: Mastery of the "Flame Manipulation Art"

With the Wish Dragon Pearl in his possession, Wei Qian held high hopes for his own path of cultivation. He had no intention of finding a cultivation partner to bear children and continue his bloodline. 

In truth, many cultivators in the immortal realm shared this mindset. Mortals lived no more than 120 years, hence the need for descendants. But high-level cultivators could live for hundreds or even thousands of years—why would they need offspring when they themselves could achieve longevity? Thus, Li Wanqing's well-meaning advice went in one ear and out the other, completely disregarded by Wei Qian.

After leaving the council hall, Wei Qian immediately headed to the Li family's treasure vault to meet the newly appointed elder, Li Wanhai. The vault's location had a fixed communication device, so Li Wanhai had already received the family head's instructions before Wei Qian arrived.

Li Wanhai remembered Wei Qian quite well. Despite having lower cultivation than himself, Wei Qian had twice returned unharmed from Mist Ridge Mountain—proof that luck was truly unpredictable. Since Wei Qian had killed two Wang family cultivators, Li Wanhai, like the new family head Li Wanqing, treated him with much more warmth.

He handed Wei Qian a jade disk-shaped artifact. "Whatever you want to exchange for, just press this to your forehead and browse the list inside."

Following the instructions, Wei Qian pressed the jade disk to his forehead and extended his spiritual sense into it, revealing a long inventory. 

At the top of the list was a pill—"Purple Mist Pill"—which could assist late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators in directly breaking through one level, requiring 10,000 contribution points. 

Second was a top-grade artifact, the Blazing Fire Saber, priced at 9,000 points. 

Third was...

Wei Qian scanned each item one by one until he reached the fiftieth entry, where he finally had enough contribution points to make an exchange.

The "Purple Qi Pill," a breakthrough pill that could help mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators advance one level, cost 2,000 points. Wei Qian was currently at the fifth level of Qi Refinement. If he took this pill, he could immediately reach the sixth level!

"I already have the recipe for the Purple Qi Pill. Once I gather the ingredients, I can refine a batch myself—no need to waste points here."

Though tempted, Wei Qian continued scrolling. 

At the eighty-ninth item, his spirit stirred. It was a medicinal cauldron for alchemy, priced at 500 points. 

Further down, at the 167th item, was a jade slip containing a flame-control technique, requiring 200 points.

Considering his lack of combat techniques, Wei Qian also exchanged for three fire-based spells, spending another 400 points. Finally, with his remaining points, he purchased some medicinal herbs and a thousand pounds of charcoal for alchemy. The Li family had established a medicinal herb garden on Mist Ridge Mountain, so common ingredients were readily available.

Wei Qian withdrew his consciousness from the jade disk and returned it to Elder Li Wanhai.

"Oh? You want to learn alchemy?" Li Wanhai immediately noticed Wei Qian's intentions based on his selections. 

This was precisely the impression Wei Qian had intended to give. 

"Yes. As a rogue cultivator, I've always admired those with a specialized craft. Now that I've obtained an alchemy inheritance by chance, I'd like to try my hand at it," Wei Qian replied smoothly.

Li Wanhai shook his head. "Alchemy is far more difficult than you imagine. I know you visited the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City and were inspired. But even the Xiao family, a renowned alchemy clan, has only a handful of talented alchemists among thousands of members. Our Li family had an alchemy inheritance passed down over a century ago, yet it wasn't until Family Head Wanqing that we finally produced an alchemist. Do you understand how challenging this is?"

He advised Wei Qian that alchemy was too difficult and the sunk costs too high. Instead, he suggested learning something easier, like talisman-making—where a single spirit stone could buy dozens of basic talisman papers, allowing beginners ample practice.

Wei Qian politely declined. Of course, he knew Li Wanhai was right. But he was that one-in-ten-thousand alchemy prodigy—the kind who could grasp techniques at a glance and succeed on the first try. Not utilizing such talent would be a waste that invited divine retribution!

Naturally, he couldn't explain this to Li Wanhai. If the Li family discovered his aptitude, even their relatively upright clan elders might intervene, coercing him into marrying a Li family cultivator to bind him to them.

Seeing Wei Qian's determination, Li Wanhai sighed inwardly but stopped pressing the issue. "Youth—they never learn until they hit the wall. Let him figure it out himself."

With a swipe of his hand over the jade disk, Wei Qian's contribution points were cleared. "The cauldron and jade slip can be given to you now. The herbs and charcoal will take time to gather and will be delivered to your residence later."

That evening, Wei Qian didn't meditate. Instead, he pressed the newly acquired jade slip to his forehead, absorbing the flood of information within. 

The flame-control technique he had chosen was called the "Flame Manipulation Art." At its peak, it allowed the user to freely shape flames with effortless precision. The technique spanned over 30,000 words, redundantly explaining concepts in excruciating detail.

Wei Qian, naturally gifted in both alchemy and comprehension, realized after three readings that the content could be condensed to just over 8,000 words. "Good news indeed."

But even with his talent, he had no intention of wasting time mastering this technique through conventional means. 

He immediately entered his spiritual sea and faced the Wish Dragon Pearl. "Dragon Pearl, I wish to master the 'Flame Manipulation Art' to its peak."

The pearl responded: "Twenty-six days." 

"Even this technique is far more advanced than the 'Gentle Breeze and Rain Art.' If I were to cultivate it normally, it would take three to four months to reach mastery."

Elder Li Wanhai was efficient—by the next day, all the requested materials had been delivered to Wei Qian's doorstep. 

Though the cauldron, herbs, and charcoal were ready, Wei Qian didn't start refining pills immediately. He patiently waited the full twenty-six days. 

On the final day, the Dragon Pearl fulfilled his wish, elevating the "Flame Manipulation Art" to its pinnacle!
