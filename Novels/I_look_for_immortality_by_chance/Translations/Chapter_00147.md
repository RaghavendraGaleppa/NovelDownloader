# Chapter 147: Void-Breaking Artifact, Fifteen Disappearances!

"Hmm?"

Gu Yuan was immersed in the joy of refining the Biyou Dun Tian Seal when suddenly, he felt a trace of unease.

This unease came without reason, yet the Three-Hearts Golden Seal in his dantian blazed with light. Gu Yuan felt his spiritual perception surge, as if he could sense the principles of heaven and earth. Faintly, he seemed to detect an unusual spatial fluctuation.

"What's happening?"

The unease was overwhelming. Not daring to delay, Gu Yuan willed himself into action, his body transforming into flowing water in an instant. When he reappeared, he was already a hundred zhang away.

"Whoosh!"

But at that moment, a tremendous howling sound erupted from the void, as if something extraordinary had shattered space, opening a boundless door. A transparent portal suddenly appeared behind Gu Yuan.

"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"

Not only that, but a powerful gust of wind surged forth, sweeping Gu Yuan toward the portal.

"Not good!"

The suddenness of this event left Gu Yuan unprepared. He desperately activated the Biyou Dun Tian Seal, attempting to evade with his water-based movement technique.

"Boom!"

Yet at that very instant, countless strange formation banners lit up across the great river. The entire water vein energy of the river was mobilized, and an indescribable force of suppression descended, immobilizing all beings below the Golden Core realm for a fleeting moment.

Fifteen portals suddenly brightened, accompanied by eerie howls and gusts of wind.

Gu Yuan's mind froze, his thoughts halting. The glow of the Biyou Dun Tian Seal dimmed, and his body was helplessly pulled toward the portal.

"Audacious! How dare you touch my people!"

A cold voice rang out from the sky. A brilliant sword light tore through the void, arriving in an instant to slash at the portal before Gu Yuan.

Simultaneously, multiple dazzling spiritual lights and artifacts descended from the sky, striking at the strange portals that had appeared.

"Hahaha, why the anger, fellow Daoists? Didn't you want your disciples to undergo trials? I'm merely helping them!"

A booming laughter echoed from the depths of the great river. A peculiar treasure fan rose into the sky, releasing boundless silver light that shattered the void.

"Bang!"

The fifteen portals erupted with radiant light, unleashing an overwhelming spatial force. Chaotic currents surged, and even the formidable sword light failed to destroy them instantly.

"Whoosh!"

In the blink of an eye, fifteen figures were sucked into the portals, vanishing without a trace.

......

The events unfolded too swiftly, catching even the Golden Core elders aboard the Dharma ships off guard.

Had it been an ordinary artifact, no matter how powerful, they could have resisted it momentarily. But this Void-Breaking Artifact shattered spatial constraints, operating with such stealth that by the time they reacted, it was already too late.

Fifteen disciples from the Dao Academy were abruptly transported through the void to unknown destinations.

"You dare?!"

A furious roar thundered from the heavens. A golden-robed elder, wielding a dazzling golden sword seal, slashed toward the depths of the great river.

At the same time, several other formidable figures aboard the Dharma ships launched their attacks.

"Boom!"

But then, an immense burst of spiritual light erupted, sweeping across the river like a tidal wave. It was as if something terrifying had exploded, sending towering waves in all directions.

A self-destructing formation!

The Azurewater Flame-Eyed Ape Clan had detonated their life-sustaining "Zeyuan Great River Formation," sacrificing a third-grade spiritual vein to unleash this devastating power.

Even Golden Core cultivators hesitated before such destruction, momentarily halting their advance.

"Trials and conquests? You think of my Azurewater Flame-Eyed Ape Clan as mere whetstones?"

"If you want the Crimson Moon Great River, take it! But you'll pay the price!"

Amid the deafening roar, a thunderous voice grew fainter until it disappeared entirely.

"After them!"

The golden-robed elder, consumed by rage, transformed into a streak of light and gave chase. Two other figures followed closely behind.

But a serene figure descended from the clouds, landing on the territory of Tianlang Island.

"Greetings, Elder!"

On Tianlang Island, Ma Wu and the others were stunned.

They had no idea what had happened. A blurry portal appeared in the void, and in the next moment, their senior brother Gu Yuan was sucked into it, vanishing without a trace.

Then, amidst the distant explosions, an ethereal figure descended.

Elder Jianhu ignored Ma Wu and the others. Instead, she took out a golden compass and stood where Gu Yuan had disappeared, murmuring incantations.

"Buzz, buzz, buzz!"

The compass flickered incessantly, its needle trembling as if searching for something.

"Buzz!"

After a long while, the compass abruptly stopped, pointing firmly to the west. But perhaps due to the immense distance, the needle spun wildly after a moment, like a headless fly.

"Alas..."

Elder Jianhu sighed softly, her tone tinged with helplessness.

"Elder, what exactly happened?"

Ma Wu, unable to contain his anxiety, ventured to ask.

"Just the underhanded tactics of the Azurewater Flame-Eyed Ape Clan. That old ape used a spatial artifact to target the Dao Academy disciples who killed his clansmen, sending fifteen of them to different realms."

"I used the Golden Compass to trace his aura, but it's beyond its range—clearly over a hundred thousand li away. All I know is it's to the west."

Elder Jianhu shook her head, her gaze distant.

"A hundred thousand li away? Will Senior Brother Gu ever return?"

Ma Wu couldn't hide his shock.

Just when he had managed to latch onto a powerful ally, before reaping any benefits, Gu Yuan was gone?

"If the void isn't broken, his life isn't in danger. Whether he returns depends on his own fortune..."

Elder Jianhu sighed lightly.

Ma Wu and the others looked crestfallen.

"Since you are his disciples and have reached Foundation Establishment, you may consider yourselves connected to me. Once the Crimson Moon Great River matter is settled, you may relocate your spiritual island near my Jade Kettle Peak to cultivate..."

Elder Jianhu's gaze swept over Ma Wu and the others. After a brief hesitation, she spoke.

"Thank you, Elder!"

"Thank you, Elder!"

Jiang Ningxue and Xie Chengping remained composed, but Ma Wu and the others were overjoyed, bowing profusely.

Rumors had long circulated about the close relationship between Senior Brother Gu and Elder Jianhu. Now, it seemed the rumors were true—perhaps even an understatement.

Without Gu Yuan's connection, how could mediocrities like them ever gain the favor of such a powerful patron?

"You may attend my lectures."

Suddenly, Elder Jianhu gave Jiang Ningxue a curious glance and added.

Jiang Ningxue's heart trembled, but she dared not refuse. She bowed and replied, "Thank you, Elder!"

Elder Jianhu nodded slightly before vanishing in a flash.

On Tianlang Island, Ma Wu and the others remained, but Gu Yuan was nowhere to be seen.
