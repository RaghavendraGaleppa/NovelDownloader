Chapter 101: Clothes, Flower Red, and Internal Scene Confrontation

Xiao Qin took out a letter, which was made of the same material as the one they had found on the Huai Shan three evil cultivators.

It had already been deciphered by Zuo Qiu Yang.

"Brothers, it's been three days since we parted ways, and I must say, you're quite impressive now."

"Recently, you've made a name for yourselves in the Wu Jian trial, and the judge is very pleased with you, especially Long Sha."

"The judge personally praised him, saying he's a born killer."

The tone of the letter was much more casual than before, and it even addressed them as "brothers" now.

A born killer?

Xiao Qin looked at Li Mo in surprise.

What had Li Mo done to deserve such high praise from the judge of the Fine Rain Tower?

Li Mo was also puzzled; he didn't think he had done anything extraordinary. He had simply killed a few people and destroyed their bodies.

"Let's continue reading," Xiao Qin said.

The letter went on to say that with their current strength, passing the Wu Jian trial would be a breeze.

After the trial, they were asked to meet at the Ling Jiang dock.

The judge had an important task for them, and their big brother, Xiao Mi Tuo, had managed to secure their participation.

The letter ended with the phrase "Xiao Mi Tuo, with respect."

Li Mo and Xiao Qin exchanged a look.

They were being drawn into the inner workings of the Fine Rain Tower.

Was this a guarantee of their future success?

"It seems that the judge's status in the Fine Rain Tower is higher than Xiao Mi Tuo's," Xiao Qin said.

Actually, it was Qian Xing Wu Zun who had told him this.

The judge of the Fine Rain Tower was responsible for determining whether a killer had completed their task, and it was also a guarantee of the tower's reputation.

"I wonder what kind of private business the judge has," Li Mo said.

"Whatever it is, it's probably not good," Xiao Qin replied.

A group of killers couldn't possibly be tasked with something as simple as helping old ladies cross the street.

Li Mo decided to stick to their original plan.

"Let's wait until we meet Xiao Mi Tuo, and then take him out," Li Mo said.

"Otherwise, we'll always be at risk of being exposed."

"Since we've already been chosen to work for the judge, we'll have plenty of opportunities to get close to him."

Xiao Qin nodded in agreement.

Later that afternoon, Li Mo invested in some lower-level martial arts for the younger disciples.

The system notified him of the investments and the feedback.

Li Mo looked around and noticed that Jiang Chu Long was missing.

"Where's Chu Long?" Li Mo asked.

Jiang Chu Long appeared, holding a cloth package.

"This...this is for you," she said.

The package contained a crudely made piece of clothing with a sword embroidered on it.

Li Mo was taken aback.

"You went out to collect junk just to buy fabric?" Li Mo asked.

Jiang Chu Long nodded.

Li Mo was amused.

But then he noticed something off.

"You collected so much junk, and you only got enough money to buy fabric?" Li Mo asked.

Jiang Chu Long explained that the junk wasn't worth much.

Li Mo looked at the "junk" and saw that it was actually a high-quality steel axe.

He was furious.

"Tell me which shop you're selling your junk to," Li Mo said.

Meanwhile, at the Ling Jiang dock, a black-clothed figure, Yin Hua Cheng, was standing on a boat.

He received news that Li Mo and Ying Bing had appeared in the Fu city.

Yin Hua Cheng crushed a piece of paper in his hand, and it fell into the water.

A figure with a smiling Buddha mask appeared on the boat.

"You're the one sent by Judge Cui?" Yin Hua Cheng asked.

The figure, Xiao Mi Tuo, nodded.

Yin Hua Cheng offered him a cup of tea.

"You're quite skilled in your Buddhist practices," Yin Hua Cheng said.

Xiao Mi Tuo replied that he was just helping people transcend to the next life.

Yin Hua Cheng got straight to the point.

"How's the business going?" he asked.

"Just one more batch of 'goods' to arrive, and we can set sail," Xiao Mi Tuo replied.

"The goods will arrive when the internal scene confrontation happens," Xiao Mi Tuo said.

Yin Hua Cheng seemed to savor the phrase "internal scene confrontation."

"By the way, I need you to kill someone in the Internal Breath realm and bring me their belongings," Yin Hua Cheng said.

"The price will be listed on the dark tower's flower red," Xiao Mi Tuo replied.

"How much will you charge?" Yin Hua Cheng asked.

"A Xuan crystal," Xiao Mi Tuo said.

Yin Hua Cheng hesitated.

"You want to kill Li Mo, a true disciple of the Qing Yuan sect?" Xiao Mi Tuo asked.

Yin Hua Cheng produced a Buddhist scripture with a strange image.

Xiao Mi Tuo's breathing became labored.

After a moment of silence, he said, "The fate has been sealed."
