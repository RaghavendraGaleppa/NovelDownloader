# Chapter 24: A Huge Windfall

Relaxing his entire body, Chu Ning began reflecting on today's harrowing experience. He didn't know who that bearded man was, but judging by the delight on his face when he first saw Chu Ning, the man had most likely been lying in wait specifically for him.

It was highly probable that Chu Ning's frequent solo trips between the sect and the market district in recent times had caught the attention of this bandit cultivator. The man might have even seen Chu Ning visiting Old Man Sun and known about his ability to earn spirit stones, hence choosing to ambush him there.

However, this bandit cultivator clearly hadn't anticipated that today would be Chu Ning's final visit—and that he'd spent his spirit stones on so many talismans. Thinking of this, Chu Ning felt a surge of relief. Thankfully, he'd been vigilant enough and had purchased four talismans; otherwise, he might not have made it out alive today.

"What a pity the Thorn Technique can't be cast instantly. Otherwise, I wouldn't have had to waste that Body Protection Talisman," Chu Ning muttered to himself. That talisman had mainly been used to buy time for his Thorn Technique to take effect and trap the enemy.

But as soon as this thought crossed his mind, Chu Ning shook his head. That Body Protection Talisman had been absolutely necessary. The bandit cultivator's offensive spells were clearly far superior—his Golden Sword Technique was not only powerful but also cast much faster. The only thing the man lacked was defensive talismans or related spells, which was why Chu Ning had managed to survive so easily.

Chu Ning had first used his Vine Armor Technique, followed by the Body Protection Talisman, enduring three strikes from the Golden Sword Technique before finally standing here safely. Survival comes before offense! He resolved to engrave this principle firmly in his mind. From now on, self-preservation would always come first, with offense as a secondary consideration. He must never forget this!

Still, using up two talismans in one go did sting a little—that was five low-grade spirit stones gone. Thinking of this, Chu Ning pulled out the items he'd taken from the bearded man. There was only a single low-grade spirit stone, barely better than nothing. 

A Swift Movement Talisman could temporarily increase the user's speed, useful for escaping. The bandit hadn't had the chance to use it while trapped. It was worth about two low-grade spirit stones, roughly offsetting the cost of Chu Ning's Golden Sword Talisman.

Next, he examined two booklets. The thinner one recorded a metal-attribute spell called the Golden Sword Technique—clearly the same one the bearded man had used. The spell's offensive power was impressive, and Chu Ning felt a surge of excitement upon seeing it. But remembering his mediocre aptitude and slow progress in non-wood-attribute spells, he sighed softly. He wasn't sure if he could even learn it.

Then, he turned to the slightly thicker booklet. The title made him pause in surprise: *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art*. 

"The *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art*? I've been practicing the *Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique*—could there be a connection between the two?" A thought struck Chu Ning, and he eagerly flipped through the pages. 

His *Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique* had been most effective before he began cultivating qi. During the early stages of Qi Refining, it still improved his physique somewhat, but by the time he reached mid-stage Qi Refining, its effects had completely vanished.

The first line that caught his eye read: "Refine the body before refining qi." There was no further explanation, and Chu Ning didn't dwell on it, continuing to read. 

After just a few pages, his heart raced with astonishment. The body-refining postures recorded in the *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art* were identical to those in his *Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique*! The only difference was that this version included qi circulation pathways, allowing the use of spiritual energy to enhance the body-refining effects.

"So, the *Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique* is the mortal version of this *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art*?" Chu Ning mused.

As he read further, he found that this booklet was far more comprehensive than the *Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique*. The first volume alone contained five sections: Imperishable Skin, Unyielding Bones, Unbreakable Sinews, Undying Soul, and Indestructible Golden Body. However, after the last section, it simply stated, "End of Volume One." 

The *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art* he held was only the first volume. How many volumes existed in total? What would the complete art entail? For now, there was no one to answer these questions.

At the same time, Chu Ning was deeply puzzled. How had that bearded man—clearly a rogue cultivator—obtained this *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art*? Moreover, the man hadn't seemed like a body-refining specialist. 

Despite these doubts, Chu Ning was thrilled. The *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art* was an incredible find for him. Over the past days, as he practiced various spells, his proficiency panel hadn't shown any changes—only the *Evergreen Wood Art* and *Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique* were listed. Since the *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art* was derived from the same lineage as the latter, might it also display proficiency?

With this thought in mind, Chu Ning memorized the qi circulation pathways for the Imperishable Skin section and immediately began practicing. 

The physical postures were already second nature to him after his training with the *Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique*. Now, he only needed to incorporate qi circulation. The nine movements remained the same, but maintaining stable qi flow slowed him down considerably.

Yet, after completing one cycle, a satisfied smile spread across Chu Ning's face. That long-lost sensation of warmth spreading through his body, accompanied by tangible physical improvement, had returned. 

When he focused inward, he immediately noticed a change:

[*Evergreen Wood Art* (Yellow Low-Grade), Second Layer (70/900)]  
[*Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art*, Volume One, Imperishable Skin (1/300)]  

"The *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art* really does show proficiency!" Chu Ning rejoiced inwardly. Proficiency meant that if he could master it completely, he might receive a divine ability as a reward. 

However, the *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art* seemed far more challenging. The Imperishable Skin section alone required 300 proficiency points just to begin. The first layer of the *Evergreen Wood Art* had only needed 300 points in total—covering the first three Qi Refining stages. It seemed this would take considerable time to cultivate. 

Still, this was an enormous gain. After carefully storing the *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art* booklet, Chu Ning turned his attention to the final item—a small jade box. 

Inside was a black seed. 

"What kind of seed is this?" Chu Ning frowned slightly, as the seed's aura felt strangely familiar. 

Then, his eyes suddenly lit up. 

"Seven-Star Spirit Fruit!!" 

For the past ten days, Chu Ning had been casting the Evergreen Wood Technique on Seven-Star Spirit Fruits at Old Man Sun's place. He was intimately familiar with the plant's aura. Though this was just a seed, the resemblance was unmistakable. 

"Could it really be this much of a coincidence? Did that bearded man ambush me because of this?" Chu Ning wondered. 

Recalling how protective Old Man Sun was of his Seven-Star Spirit Fruits, Chu Ning's heart raced with excitement. 

"Whatever the case, I need to confirm whether this is really a Seven-Star Spirit Fruit seed. If it is... I've hit the jackpot!" 

Truth be told, obtaining the *Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art* was already a massive windfall. But he still wanted to verify the seed's identity. 

Gritting his teeth, Chu Ning cast an Instant Growth Technique on the black seed.
