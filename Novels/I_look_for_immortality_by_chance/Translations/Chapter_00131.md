# Chapter 131: Battle Challenge at the Frontlines!

The Crimson Moon Great River, with its undulating waves and boundless expanse, was a renowned spiritual treasure among the Southern Mountain Domain's waterways. Countless islands dotted its surface like stars in the sky, stretching endlessly. These islands, along with the crude or luxurious water palaces hidden deep within the river, formed a vast and imposing territory of demonic forces.

Within this great river dwelled innumerable demons of all sizes. Humans were rarely seen here—those who did appear were mostly captured mortals destined to become meals for the demonic hordes. In the past, these demons would either feast and revel or engage in bloody skirmishes, ensuring the river was never quiet for a single day.

But on this day, an unusual silence fell over the river as countless demons gathered together, seemingly waiting for something.

Just then, a massive spell-ship shattered through the clouds like a streak of light, arriving in an instant before the great river.

"Little ones, sound the drums and form the battle array!" A thunderous roar echoed across the river, followed by the booming of war drums.

**Boom!**  
**Boom!**  
**Boom!**

The deafening sound shook the heavens as demonic energy surged and coiled, blotting out the sky and forming a vast, shadowy claw that reached toward the approaching spell-ship.

**Clang!**

A cold snort came from the ship, followed by a brilliant sword light infused with dense spiritual energy. It slashed through the claw, revealing the bright sky once more. But the demonic energy over the river, intertwined with the water veins and earth force, quickly reformed into a terrifying claw, hovering menacingly in the air as it glared at the spell-ship.

For a moment, the two sides were locked in a stalemate.

Inside the spell-ship, Yin Xingchao sat at the head, his eyes gleaming with golden light as he pointed at a radiant cyan map, outlining the battle strategy to the gathered cultivators.

"The Crimson Moon Great River stretches endlessly from north to south, with the northern region being particularly rich in spiritual energy. Its water veins are vast as the sea, dotted with third-tier spirit islands—home to the main water palace of the Crimson Ape Clan. This area is perilous and will be the focal point of our campaign."

"Your cultivation is still insufficient to participate in such a battle. Senior cultivators have already led two other spell-ships there. Our task is to conquer the Southern Marsh Water Realm before us!"

With a sweep of his hand, a golden light split the map in two, marking two battlefronts.

"The Southern Marsh Water Realm is a mixed territory under the Crimson Ape Clan's rule, filled with countless islands and over fifty earth demons."

"However, these demons lack proper heritage, possessing neither true scriptures nor profound techniques. Their cultivation is self-taught and crude, making them no match for disciples of our great sect. Do not fear them."

"Our immediate goal is to break the 'Earth Fiend Water Sky Formation' set up by the Crimson Apes in the Southern Marsh. This formation connects the water veins, earth force, and demonic energy of the islands, gathering water into a defensive and offensive sea. It is not to be underestimated."

"But once this formation is shattered, the demons will be left defenseless, scattered like loose sand, allowing us to pick them off one by one."

The crowd nodded in agreement, and the newly ascended Foundation Establishment disciples breathed a sigh of relief.

"Senior Brother, how do we break this formation?" a disciple asked.

"Though formidable, this formation is no match for the arcane power of our sect's Flying Mist Spell-Ship. All you need to do is stabilize the spirit disks as formation anchors while I sever the Southern Marsh's water veins. Within half a month, the formation will crumble!"

Yin Xingchao stroked his beard confidently. In a large-scale campaign like this, half a month to dismantle a river-protecting formation was remarkably swift—proof of the sect's thorough preparations.

"Hey, you humans! Dare to come out and face your Grandpa Ox in battle?"  

Suddenly, a taunting voice rang out from beyond the ship.

Frowning, the cultivators extended their spiritual senses and saw a burly figure emerge from the roiling demonic energy. He had black ox horns, a nose ring, greenish skin, and eerie glowing eyes. Wielding a jade great axe, he spat and jeered at the spell-ship.

This was a battle challenge—a rare but not unheard-of tactic in campaigns. Winning such a duel would boost morale and weaken the enemy, while losing meant certain death. Only those supremely confident in their strength would dare issue such a challenge.

The ox demon's bold provocation clearly signaled his confidence.

Inside the ship, the cultivators exchanged glances but remained silent. As Foundation Establishment experts with long lifespans, they couldn't recklessly accept such challenges.

"What, no one dares answer? Hiding in your turtle shell, are you? Hah! Why don't you change your names and join the old turtle's lineage? Forget cultivation—just be turtle grandsons!"  

Seeing no response, the ox demon laughed uproariously, even turning around to mock them with vulgar gestures.

"This beast's challenge is meant to thin our ranks and weaken the spell-ship's formation anchors, delaying our assault," Yin Xingchao said with a frown. "But if we slay him, we can weaken the demonic forces and hasten the formation's collapse."

"Killing him in battle would earn a great merit. Who among you wishes to claim this achievement?"  

As the ox demon's taunts grew more brazen, some cultivators grew tempted. Unlike the previous campaign at Flying Wave Mountain, the spoils of this battle would be distributed based on individual merits recorded on the sect's "Merit Jade Plates."

"I'll deal with this beast!"  

A cultivator with a faint scar near his eye stepped forward from among the noble clans. After bowing to Yin Xingchao, he transformed into a streak of light and flew out of the ship.

"That's Ji Fenghua," Ma Wu whispered to Gu Yuan. "Not from the Seven Veins or Five Great Clans—just a minor noble family. But his talent is exceptional. Twenty years ago, he chanced upon a spiritual opportunity during his travels and broke through to Foundation Establishment. His swordsmanship is said to be formidable, and he wields a spirit artifact."  

Since reaching Foundation Establishment, Ma Wu had diligently studied both the Crimson Moon Great River and the sect's experts, striving to contribute to their small faction.

Gu Yuan smiled faintly, appreciating the value of having a reliable team.

Outside, the duel between man and demon had already begun.
