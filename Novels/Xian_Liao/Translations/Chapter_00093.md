**Chapter 93: Divine Methods**  

The Tai Chi Hall in the imperial city, once the emperor's court, had now become the meeting place for Zhou Qing and his companions.  

"Anping Dao's leader wishes to meet me," Zhou Qing said, handing the letter to the three elder Taoists.  

"Let's all go together," Fushong suggested.  

Zhou Qing shook his head. "The palace still holds many rare treasures. Our people haven't arrived yet, and we can't afford any mishaps with these items."  

Taking control of the former center of power was one thing; managing it was another. While Zhou Qing and his group were formidable fighters, proper governance required trusted personnel. Outsiders offering allegiance couldn't be fully trusted.  

He shared his thoughts. Anping Dao dominated the north, commanding a following of millions of displaced refugees. Even if they subdued Anping Dao, the refugees would still need proper resettlement. Moreover, without resolving the Anping Dao issue, the north and south would remain divided.  

"If he wants to meet me, then let him. They must already know what we've done in the imperial city. Given that precedent, they'll likely be open to negotiations."  

"Are you confident going alone?" Zhang Jingxiu sensed Zhou Qing's intention to meet them solo.  

Zhou Qing smiled. "You've all elevated me to the status of an immortal envoy. If I don't display some divine methods, how can I convince the world? Don't worry—even a million-strong army couldn't hold me."  

With a surge of energy, Zhou Qing levitated effortlessly in the hall.  

"Qi-based flight?"  

Zhou Qing chuckled. "Just a simple manipulation of air currents—temporary flight, limited to a few miles at most."  

"Is it related to True Qi? Teach me," Fushong said enviously.  

"It's simple—just reach the fourth layer of Qi Refinement."  

Fushong looked stunned, while Zhang Jingxiu's face twisted in disbelief. "You're at the fourth layer?"  

"The old eunuch reached the fourth layer before he died. Why is it surprising?"  

Zhang Jingxiu felt a pang of frustration—he had only just broken through to the second layer after consuming the Ascending Dragon Pill.  

With the fourth layer of True Qi enhancing his Windshadow Steps technique, Zhou Qing could generate powerful air currents, allowing him brief aerial movement. In truth, the Windshadow Steps' full potential could only be unleashed with True Qi.  

Zhou Qing even planned to further refine the technique, envisioning a new name: "Wind God's Steps." After all, the names derived from his own understanding and will.  

The foundation of Windshadow Steps lay in the Deer Stance and the Windshadow Manual. Elevating it to "Wind God's Steps" seemed fitting.  

Through his cultivation, Zhou Qing realized that the techniques classified as "extraordinary skills" by his system were more suited for body refinement. Even the Palm Thunder technique, though powered by True Qi, fundamentally relied on his physical cultivation.  

The Rejuvenation Manual, previously deemed an extraordinary skill, emphasized vital energy, preparing him for the breakthrough to the Innate Realm. The Fierce Tiger Slaying Scripture and Soul Suppression were listed separately in his system, without any mention of spells. However, from the old eunuch's martial legacy, Zhou Qing discovered a technique that could evolve into a spell—Innate Silk Hands. If refined further, it could become "Immortal Binding Ropes."  

But the cultivation conditions were stringent, requiring at least a breakthrough to the Qi Refinement stage to even begin. Moreover, the technique only had an introductory chant, with no follow-up content. It was a fragment left behind by the legendary Master Jingyang, found by the old eunuch. Even Master Jingyang had only obtained an incomplete version.  

In contrast, Zhou Qing easily mastered the foundational Innate Silk Hands, quickly reaching proficiency with impressive power.  

Now capable of brief flight and possessing peerless body-refinement skills, Zhou Qing's movements were almost ghostly. Unless he ventured into forbidden lands deep in the mountains, no mortal force could restrain him.  

Given Zhou Qing's cautious nature, the three elders agreed to his decision.  

Additionally, the meeting location chosen by Anping Dao's leader played a role—a small riverside manor surrounded by plains, making large-scale ambushes impossible. To Zhou Qing, ordinary peak martial artists were no different from elite soldiers now.

The manor exuded an otherworldly tranquility, nestled beside the great river that had witnessed countless heroic tales.  

When Zhou Qing arrived at the gates, he was met with intense wariness.  

"Disarm," came the command.  

Anping Dao's leader emerged, flanked by four subordinates, to greet Zhou Qing.  

Zhou Qing noted the leader's ruddy complexion and remarked, "Your vital energy has nearly reached the tips of your hair—truly on the cusp of the Innate Realm."  

This was a hallmark of the Innate Realm. The leader's energy had already permeated his head, the pinnacle of the body, far surpassing ordinary martial artists. He was even closer to the Innate Realm than Zhang Jingxiu had been before meeting Zhou Qing.  

"You flatter me," the leader replied, studying Zhou Qing. "Even if I broke through to the Innate Realm, what would it mean in your eyes?"  

They entered the exquisitely arranged manor, which featured an advanced feng shui formation with a faint spirit-gathering effect.  

In the main hall, only Zhou Qing and the leader took seats.  

"Master Zhou, you overthrew the tyrannical Zhou dynasty—truly a man of our cause."  

"Tyrannical Zhou? I also bear the surname Zhou. Are you implying something?" Zhou Qing's tone carried a subtle edge.  

The leader chuckled nervously. "A mere jest."  

Zhou Qing cut to the chase. "The Zhou dynasty has fallen, and warlords rise everywhere. I intend to end this chaos. What say you?"  

"How do you plan to do so?"  

"I propose gathering the leaders of all factions at Qingfu Palace to demarcate territories. I hope you'll set an example."  

"Do you seek to become the supreme ruler?"  

Zhou Qing shook his head, hinting at the existence of the Dao Court.  

The leader sighed. "The Zhou dynasty had an Innate Realm ancestor over a century old and three thousand elite guards, yet they fell to your group. My Anping Dao, though vast in numbers, cannot withstand your decapitation strikes. But if we feared death, we wouldn't have rebelled. To truly unite the land, you must demonstrate divine methods that command absolute awe."  

He knew Zhou Qing could replicate the Zhou dynasty's downfall with Anping Dao. Today, even in Zhou Qing's presence alone, he sensed an overwhelming lethality, deepening his respect for the Innate Realm.  

Still, he needed to witness Zhou Qing's divine methods firsthand before committing. His followers and the four kings under him remained unaware of his apprehensions.  

"Very well," Zhou Qing said calmly.  

The Eagle King of Anping Dao stepped forward, gripping two iron spheres. "I am Iron Eagle. Rumor speaks of your peerless skills. These spheres are forged from meteorite iron—denser than gold, harder than diamond. With my brute strength, dare you catch them?"  

"Not just catch them—unleash your full Eagle Claw technique. I'll remain seated. If my chair moves or is damaged in the slightest, I concede."  

"Bold words! Forgive my offense."  

The Eagle King activated his technique, infusing the spheres with energy. Friction soon produced scorching heat. With a roar, he hurled the glowing spheres at Zhou Qing's shoulders like fiery meteors.  

Time seemed to freeze.  

With a casual wave, Zhou Qing caught both spheres. Then, with a gentle squeeze, they melted like liquid iron, dripping to the floor.  

"Crushing iron into mud."  

This legendary feat, achievable only by top-tier body-refinement masters, left the Eagle King aghast. The meteorite iron's durability and heat should have been insurmountable—yet Zhou Qing treated it like clay.  

This was no man—this was a deity.  

The hall fell into stunned silence.  

"Testing me one by one would take too long. Attack me together. If you can move my chair even slightly, I lose."  

The challenge ignited a mix of shame and fury among the onlookers.  

Anping Dao's leader nodded. "Since Master Zhou tests you, the four kings shall face him together."  

The Snake, Eagle, Lion, and Turtle Kings exchanged glances before bowing. "We apologize in advance."  

Though Zhou Qing was clearly transcendent, his words bordered on insult. These were no ordinary masters—each was at their prime, battle-hardened, and ranked among the top martial artists of their era.  

In an instant, the Eagle King soared, the Snake King struck like a viper, the Lion King roared, and the Turtle King unleashed his shell-backed fists.  

The hall trembled under their combined assault.  

Yet Zhou Qing sat unmoved. The raging currents of energy dissipated harmlessly before him. His mastery of the Eighteen Falling Steps would put even Zhang Jingxiu to shame.  

The four kings attacked simultaneously, but Zhou Qing seemed to grow four extra arms, effortlessly dismantling their techniques. He pinpointed every flaw in their movements and energy flow, neutralizing their force without a single loud collision.  

A numbing energy infiltrated their bodies, leaving them momentarily paralyzed upon landing.  

Their eyes widened in horror.  

In that instant, a peerless master could have slain them multiple times over. They had brushed against death itself—their fates resting entirely in Zhou Qing's hands.  

Now, they saw him not as an Innate master, but as the King of Hell incarnate.  

"Thank you for sparing us," the Eagle King muttered dejectedly.  

The others echoed his gratitude. As martial artists who had clawed their way through bloodshed, they acknowledged Zhou Qing's superiority without resentment.  

Zhou Qing smiled. "Your skills are among the finest in the world. You merely lack the breakthrough to the Immortal Path."  

"The Immortal Path?" Their eyes gleamed with longing.  

Zhou Qing turned to the leader. "Your thoughts?"  

The leader pointed to a fish tank in the corner. "Your divine methods are undeniable. Can you guess how many live fish are in that tank?"  

"Three."  

The leader smiled. "Wrong. Only two live fish. The third is dead, animated by my ghostly arts—its vitality lingering just long enough to deceive."  

Zhou Qing shook his head. "It lives."  

He approached the tank, tapped it, and a bream encased in a water orb floated mid-air. A wisp of dark energy was expelled as the fish, previously lifeless, began swimming again under Zhou Qing's revitalizing touch.  

"Resurrecting the dead!" The crowd gasped.  

In truth, Zhou Qing had used his profound spiritual sense, life-infusing True Qi, and unparalleled medical skills to revive the recently deceased fish.  

"Breathing life into bones," the leader murmured in awe.  

Today, Zhou Qing had outshone even Anping Dao's grandest miracles—his feats were undeniably real.  

The hall's occupants now regarded him with the reverence usually reserved for deities.  

"Master Zhou, your divine might leaves us humbled," the leader conceded.  

In both martial prowess and mystical arts, Zhou Qing stood beyond their reach.  

After a round of toasts, Anping Dao's leadership escorted Zhou Qing out, treating him like a living god.  

They had truly witnessed an immortal today.  

As Zhou Qing soared across the river on air currents, the masses below watched in awe. While elite martial artists could tread water, flight defied mortal comprehension.  

The legend of "Immortal Zhou Crossing the River" soon spread far and wide.
