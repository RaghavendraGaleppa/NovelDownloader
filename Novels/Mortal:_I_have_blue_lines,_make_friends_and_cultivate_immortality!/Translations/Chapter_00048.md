# Chapter 48: Lin Yun: "I'll Take On a Thousand!"

"You—" Fuyunzi was so furious his glare burned into Lin Yun.

"Kid, you've got guts!"

"Hey—baldy, what are you doing? Threatening my Yellow Maple Valley disciple? Have some dignity as a Core Formation cultivator," Li Huayuan stepped forward protectively.

"Dignity? What about your Yellow Maple Valley's shamelessness?!"

"If you let this guy enter, will any of our disciples from other sects survive?!" Fuyunzi roared. "What are your Yellow Maple Valley's intentions?! Trying to wipe out all six sects' disciples?!"

His angry outburst drew attention from all six sects.

"Huh—"

"That kid—"

"Isn't that—"

When they clearly saw Lin Yun's face, everyone's expressions changed. Though his cultivation wasn't high, he was already quite famous.

Letting this human-shaped walking talisman monster enter would mean their disciples wouldn't know how to survive.

Only Rainbow Skirt Fairy from the Veiled Moon Sect hadn't met Lin Yun before. She found it strange why Core Formation cultivators would react so strongly to a mere Qi Condensation cultivator.

Just then, a voice whispered in her ear, "Senior Sister, this is the talisman-making genius I told you about from the Ascension Ceremony."

"He's also the one who recently gave away over a thousand high-grade elementary talismans for free in Yellow Maple Valley."

Rainbow Skirt Fairy's red lips parted in shock upon hearing this. "Over a thousand talismans?! Given away for free?!"

"What does this person want?"

"Is he even human? Could he be some reincarnated Talisman Immortal?" Now she understood why everyone's expressions changed at the sight of this Qi Condensation disciple.

Letting him enter would be like unleashing a slaughter among the Qi Condensation disciples.

If someone who gave away over a thousand high-grade elementary talismans for free claimed he had none left, would you believe him?

Which Qi Condensation disciple could withstand that kind of firepower?

Core Formation experts from all six sects gathered around.

Li Huayuan shielded Lin Yun behind him.

"Fellow Daoist Li, your Yellow Maple Valley isn't playing fair this time. Young Friend Lin doesn't need to participate in the Bloody Restricted Zone, does he?" said the Core Formation cultivator from Heavenly Fortress.

"I suggest prohibiting this young man from joining the Bloody Trial," proposed the Core Formation cultivator from Saber Transformation Cottage.

"Agreed—"

"Seconded—"

"I agree—"

The other Core Formation cultivators voiced their approval.

"Wait—you all—" Li Huayuan turned to the Veiled Moon Sect members. "When your sect used the Moon Sun Treasure Pearl before, did any of the six sects demand you return the extra spirit herbs collected in previous years?"

Rainbow Skirt Fairy's expression darkened at this. It was precisely by relying on the Moon Sun Treasure Pearl to gather massive amounts of spirit herbs from the Bloody Restricted Zone that the Veiled Moon Sect had risen to become the leader among the seven sects.

"Lin Yun is also a Qi Condensation cultivator. Why can't he participate?!" Li Huayuan argued vehemently.

"Keep talking and I'll blast you all with Giant Spirit Claw Talismans!" Lin Yun eyed the gathered Core Formation cultivators.

The other sects' Core Formation experts exchanged glances. Lin Yun was indeed only at Qi Condensation perfection. They had no authority to prevent his participation.

"Enough—what's all this noise!" Just as the stalemate continued, the eccentric Elder Qiong suddenly spoke. "A mere Qi Condensation disciple has Core Formation cultivators trembling in fear? What disgraceful behavior!"

Elder Qiong stepped forward, flying to stand before Lin Yun. After scrutinizing him, a glint of admiration appeared in his eyes. "Good lad!"

"Impressive cultivation!"

This Lin Yun truly surprised Elder Qiong. Beyond his heaven-defying talisman-making talent, his cultivation aptitude was equally terrifying.

His true essence and spiritual power were unprecedentedly rich and pure. Moreover, faint explosive rumbles emanated from his body, indicating terrifyingly strong physical cultivation.

Simply perfect!

He had never seen a more flawless cultivator than Lin Yun!

"Kid, logically speaking, with your talent you shouldn't need to participate in this Bloody Trial, right?" Elder Qiong asked curiously. He knew full well the sect's usual practices—Lin Yun absolutely wouldn't be sent to the Bloody Restricted Zone.

Lin Yun clasped his hands solemnly. "I heard that after this Bloody Restricted Zone opens, the next won't be for sixty years. I simply wish to contribute to my sect by gathering more spirit herbs to secure more Foundation Establishment Pills for Yellow Maple Valley."

His answer stunned the Core Formation cultivators and Elder Qiong, who then burst into uproarious laughter. "Hahahaha—"

"Contributing to your sect?"

"That's the funniest joke this old man has ever heard!"

"There actually exists someone like you in this world?!"

"This old man doesn't believe it!"

"But since you have the courage to come and even dare reveal yourself before us, your guts are commendable!" Elder Qiong didn't care about Lin Yun's true motives. A ruthless glint flashed in his eyes.

Directly killing Lin Yun was impossible, of course.

As Li Huayuan said, when the Veiled Moon Sect cheated using the Moon Sun Treasure Pearl, the other six sects didn't unite to destroy the then-developing Veiled Moon Sect—they merely made the treasure a shared possession.

The same principle applied now.

The cultivation world wasn't about brute force, but social intricacies.

Though they couldn't act directly, that didn't mean others couldn't.

Elder Qiong's gaze swept across representatives from the other five sects. Dropping pretense, he stated bluntly: "None of us want to see this youngster grow up, do we?"

"With his talent, becoming an intermediate talisman master is only a matter of time. He'll likely achieve it soon after Foundation Establishment, and definitely not just at the initial stage."

"Judging by his extraordinarily rich spiritual power despite being a five-element spiritual root who reached Qi Condensation perfection, he must possess some unknown special physique!"

"Meaning he excels not just in talisman-making but cultivation too."

"If this kid grows up, tsk tsk tsk—"

His meaningful pause made everyone's expressions change as they probed Lin Yun with their spiritual senses.

"Is this old coot trying to unite the six sects to kill me?" Lin Yun grasped Elder Qiong's implication. "No matter. If they dare come, I'll make sure they regret it!"

"Six sects' cultivators? Hmph! I'll ensure none return!"

"Normally when he's in his sect, we can't touch him."

"But isn't this Bloody Restricted Zone our best opportunity?"

Elder Qiong's words made the other five sects' representatives exchange thoughtful glances.

"Elder Qiong, what do you mean by this? Openly targeting my Yellow Maple Valley?!" Li Huayuan demanded angrily. He hadn't expected things to escalate like this.

"This is bad! We might have overplayed our hand!"

Li Huayuan grew anxious. Elder Qiong's implication was clear—the other six sects would unite to slaughter Yellow Maple Valley's team, specifically Lin Yun.

If Lin Yun died in the Bloodly Restricted Zone, Yellow Maple Valley could say nothing.

After all, he'd insisted on participating.

"Heh, my words are plain enough, Fellow Daoist Li. You mentioned our Moon Sun Treasure Pearl earlier—the Veiled Moon Sect cannot refute that, so I approve of Young Friend Lin entering the Bloodly Restricted Zone."

"But don't forget, didn't our later self-made Moon Sun Treasure Pearl also become shared among the seven sects?"

"You can't deny that."

"If your Yellow Maple Valley wants to dominate this Bloodly Restricted Zone expedition, you'll need the strength to back it." Elder Qiong remained composed.

"I—" Li Huayuan was left speechless.

The other five sects' Core Formation cultivators exchanged glances and stopped protesting Lin Yun's participation. Instead, they returned to their groups, secretly transmitting messages.

The instruction was singular: All six sects unite to capture and kill a Yellow Maple Valley cultivator named Lin Yun!

"Lin Yun, withdraw from this Bloodly Restricted Zone expedition," Li Huayuan said directly.

"Why?" Lin Yun looked puzzled.

"Can't you see? The other six sects plan to unite and kill you inside!" Li Huayuan's spiritual sense swept over the six sects' members. "They have over three hundred, nearly four hundred people combined!"

"How can you face them alone?!"

"Only three hundred?" Lin Yun's lips curled. "I'll take on a thousand!"
