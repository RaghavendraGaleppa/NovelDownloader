# Chapter 245: Twin Swords United, Perilous Battle with Zhang Hu

Wen Caishang, graceful and elegant with her slender figure and flowing long skirt, was supported by Li Xian as they slowly walked out of the inn.

The street was bustling with activity, and a crowd had already gathered in front of the door. Li Xian and Wen Caishang exchanged a glance, both nodding slightly before quietly slipping away. They turned into an alley, navigated several winding paths, and exited the city.

Hearing nothing unusual, Li Xian asked, "Is that Zhang Hu dead?"

Wen Caishang replied, "He shattered his own heart meridian—there's an eighty percent chance he'll die. But if someone saves him, that's another matter entirely." Martial artists possessed vigorous vitality, and their martial arts comprehension varied, resulting in different characteristics.

Zhang Hu came from the "Taixin Sect."

This sect's martial arts principles, depth of meaning, and breadth of knowledge were all considered third-rate. However, they had numerous members and often launched joint expeditions, forcing ordinary aristocratic families and sects to avoid their锋芒.

Li Xian said, "I should have known to add a few more sword strikes and take his head, ensuring he couldn't possibly survive. Even a great deity would be helpless then."

Wen Caishang shook her head. "He knows my style well. Since I allowed him to commit suicide, I absolutely wouldn't make another move. If you had swung your sword, he would have immediately realized we were bluffing. He would definitely fight back desperately—a cornered beast fights fiercely, and even one or two moves from him would be extremely dangerous."

Li Xian said, "I could go back now and shoot him with a couple of arrows from afar. He wouldn't be able to do anything about that!" Wen Caishang replied, "Without anyone to save him, he'll almost certainly die. Let's not complicate things! If we attract pursuers because of this, it would be very bad."

Li Xian also thought this reasonable and said, "Good!" They held hands and left quickly. Wen Caishang had multiple injuries, her body weak and numb, making it difficult to travel far. Li Xian slowly transferred his inner qi to her, and they traveled for about a night.

Finally feeling exhausted, they found a place to sit and drank some water. Li Xian's original plan was to pass through White Tiger City, with just a few more miles to reach Wei Tiger River. But with this incident, the city would definitely be in turmoil.

They changed their route to circle around the city, heading first to Wei Tiger River, then following the river to find a boat dock to board a vessel. This added several more days to their journey.

On the other side.

When Zhang Hu heard that "Li Quan," "Su Qiuwu," and "Zhao Zhiyuan" were all dead, he became disheartened and lost all will to resist. He used "Heart-Shattering Palm" to break his own heart meridian.

The palm force was fierce and violent, completely shattering his heart meridian. In his drunken stupor, at the brink of death, he stared fixedly at Wen Caishang. With a heavy sigh, he reflected on half a lifetime of cultivation, only to end up like this. Bitterness, hardship... all sorts of emotions flooded his heart.

Suddenly, he felt something strange.

He noticed Wen Caishang's footsteps were light and empty, with very little remaining strength in her steps. He thought, "Ah! Could it be that her inner qi problem was never resolved? Was she... bluffing me just now?"

"Wen Caishang is so ruthless. Last time I captured her, I insulted her so much with my words—why would she allow me to commit suicide? Damn it! I'm too stupid, tricked into killing myself!"

When he suddenly realized the truth, he was unwilling to die. His life force was gradually dissipating, and moving recklessly would only hasten his death. He immediately exerted all his effort to "solidify blood and close pores," locking in his life force... but his eyelids grew heavier, and it seemed there was no hope left.

When he opened his eyes again, it was already dawn. He wondered, "I'm actually not dead?"

A deep voice sounded: "Brother Zhang, of course you're not dead!" The Tiger Luo Sect's leader, "Zhang Ruifeng," was already by his side.

As it turned out... yesterday, the accompanying disciples had run back to the sect on their knees. When Zhang Ruifeng learned the news, he was shocked and suspicious. To stabilize the relationship between the two sects, he went down the mountain to investigate.

Seeing Zhang Hu having committed suicide on the spot, he couldn't help but feel deeply melancholy. He reached out to check and found a faint trace of life remaining. After some hesitation, he fed him "Tiger Saliva Jade Blood Dew."

This substance could intercept life force and heal heart injuries, truly peerless in this regard. Fortunately, Zhang Hu had only shattered his heart meridian when he killed himself. If he had cut off his own head, slit his own throat, or stopped his own breathing... Zhang Ruifeng would have been helpless.

Combined with externally applied medicine and using his energy to help digest it, after one night, Zhang Hu gradually regained consciousness. Zhang Ruifeng said, "Brother Zhang, why did you commit suicide like this?"

Zhang Hu said hatefully, "I was tricked—I was really stupid! My beloved tiger was killed last night!" He gently stroked the Fanjiang Tiger, then suddenly gathered his qi and grabbed, tearing out its tiger heart.

He opened his mouth and swallowed it voraciously. The tiger heart was half the size of a human head. He dislocated his own jaw and swallowed it alive, getting stuck in his neck and swelling it round.

He jumped up and used the "Thousand Jun Fall" technique. With a "crack," he broke through the floor and landed on the first floor. The tiger heart sank to his chest.

Zhang Hu fiercely pounded his chest three times. The tiger heart broke through his intestines and filled his chest cavity. He then used his inner qi to move it to his heart meridian.

Using it as a replacement.

This was the "Tiger Form Twin Life Technique." In times of crisis, one could borrow a tiger's body to temporarily preserve life. Zhang Hu's heart meridian was damaged, barely clinging to life—this injury would be difficult to recover from. But with the tiger heart as a replacement, he could move around temporarily.

Zhang Ruifeng sighed, "Alas."

Zhang Hu cupped his hands and said, "Brother Zhang, please lend me some disciples for revenge!" Zhang Ruifeng had already helped him, showing consideration for the friendship between their two sects. However... Zhang Hu's enemy had forced him to commit suicide with just a few words. This showed how formidable they were. If the revenge succeeded, that would be one thing, but if it failed, wouldn't he just be inviting trouble?

Zhang Ruifeng said, "Brother Zhang, with your current injuries, you shouldn't act recklessly. Please rest and recover quietly."

Zhang Hu said, "Hmph! I've received your kindness repeatedly, and I'm extremely grateful. I'll definitely repay you in the future!" He cupped his hands in salute, then pushed off the ground with his hands and fled the inn, searching for traces of Wen Caishang on his own.

Aimlessly, he rushed into the mountain forest. His heart meridian was damaged, and his strength had sharply decreased. But his foundation was ultimately not shallow, with a surging qi lake. His speed was incredibly fast.

He searched aimlessly for two days.

Whether it was his extremely good luck or Wen Caishang's extremely bad luck, he didn't know.

At noon that day.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang were resting in the forest.

Suddenly, they heard a loud shout: "Good, good, I've finally found you two!" Zhang Hu pushed off the ground with his hands, using them as feet, and charged forward.

Wen Caishang exclaimed in shock, "You're not dead!?"

Zhang Hu said, "Hmph, I wouldn't dare die before capturing you alive!"

Wen Caishang sneered, "I allowed you to commit suicide, but you don't know gratitude. Fine, I'll let you taste the flavor of bone-scraping and flesh-cutting!" She flipped her sleeve and drew her sword, white essence light radiating in all directions.

"Ah!" Zhang Hu had been tricked multiple times but never learned his lesson. He waved his hands continuously and quickly fled far away.

Wen Caishang thought, "Zhang Hu shattered his own heart meridian but still didn't die. All my decisions have gone against my wishes. I have no inner qi left and am seriously injured. Could it be that some dark misfortune is still entangled with me, unwilling to let me go?"

Her heart was filled with bitterness. Her calculations weren't wrong, but the ways of the world were unpredictable, with misfortune lurking in the darkness.

Wen Caishang said, "I'm plagued by misfortune—every decision I make is a huge mistake. Li Lang... I'll listen to you completely. You come up with a plan!" Her expression was haggard.

Li Xian forced himself to remain calm and comforted her: "It's fine. This person is foolish—we can try to deal with him. I'll protect you."

When Wen Caishang heard the words "I'll protect you," she remembered how Li Xian had turned the tide along their journey, with his natural talent for strategy and bearing both being first-rate. She suddenly felt at ease.

They held hands and fled for several miles. When Zhang Hu came to his senses, he chased after them again. He laughed wildly: "Hahaha, Wen Caishang! You slut! You bitch! You won't be able to trick me this time!"

He supported himself on the ground with his hands, as if in a crouching tiger stance.

Zhang Hu said, "I'll kill your boy toy first, let's see what you do then!" He slapped the ground with both hands, borrowing the force to pounce. Wen Caishang was furious: "How dare you!" But there was nothing she could do.

In the instant he pounced close, Zhang Hu's twin claws reached out left and right. Li Xian circled his sword to block, parrying left and right. The moment his sword touched the claws, he immediately felt an extremely heavy force, and tiger roars poured into both ears!

This was the "Tiger Roar Strength Technique." When fists and feet touched the enemy, inner qi was transferred into the enemy's body, causing vibrations and humming, erupting tiger roars from within the enemy's body. A few punches and claw strikes were enough to drive someone insane.

Li Xian remained calm despite his splitting headache. Blood flowed from his ears and nose. Zhang Hu was naturally foolish and reckless, but in this situation, he was extremely troublesome.

Zhang Hu's legs were both broken, but he was very agile. His body hung in the air, his claws extremely fast! After one move of "Flying Tiger Pounces on Rabbit," he followed with "Evil Tiger Digs Out Heart," clawing straight toward the heart meridian, wanting to avenge last night's humiliation.

The moves Zhang Hu used lacked the fierce power because both his legs were broken. But the "Tiger Roar Strength Technique" was very troublesome.

If he suffered more tiger roar vibrations to his body and his mind became confused, he would definitely be defeated! Li Xian thought, "Since it's sound vibration, let me try this!" He raised his sword to block while his Iron Bronze Body shook, executing "Thunder Clap Finger," using finger force to create thunderous sounds.

The chest drum thunder sound suddenly rang out. Like thunder striking a bronze bell, deep and powerful, it instantly canceled out the tiger roar. Despite this, Li Xian spat blood from his mouth, but he wouldn't be defeated immediately.

Zhang Hu said strangely, "Good kid, you actually broke my move like this? Hahaha, not enough, not enough!"

His moves were complex—the "Tiger Roar Strength Technique" was only one of them. He changed his technique and used "Tiger Luo Ten Scattered Hands." This move was recently practiced and came from the "Tiger Luo Sect."

Although Zhang Hu's martial arts were refined and his realm was high, he had one undeniable weakness: both legs were broken! Previously, he had ridden tiger beasts, combining man and tiger, making his martial arts very strange and completely covering up this weakness. But with the tiger beast dead, his flaws were fully exposed.

Just as they started fighting, he was shocked to realize that none of his martial arts were suitable for one-on-one combat. Naturally, he used the Tiger Luo Ten Scattered Hands. There were ten moves in total, covering clawing, grabbing, deflecting, throwing... very comprehensive.

Zhang Hu hung upside down in the air, his hands continuously attacking Li Xian's lower body: knees, ankles... wanting to "return like for like" and make Li Xian taste this feeling too. Li Xian retreated while evading, his twin swords stabbing and parrying diagonally downward. With every collision, Li Xian's whole body would shake, vibrating the "chest drum thunder sound" to slow Zhang Hu's tiger roar strength.

Every few moves they exchanged, Li Xian's whole body would shake and he would spit blood. But his blood was vigorous and essence abundant, with no intention of retreating. He even thought, "In martial artists' battles, victory isn't determined by realm. Since I can't escape now, let me try my best!"

Li Xian retreated to a large boulder and slashed horizontally with his sword. He cut the boulder in half, inserted the Chenjiang Sword into the boulder, and smashed it forward. Zhang Hu chuckled "hehe," instantly striking out eighteen claw attacks.

He chipped away at the boulder bit by bit, rubble flying everywhere. Suddenly, with a "boom," the boulder erupted with flames. Several scorching sword qi shot out. Zhang Hu had indeed underestimated his opponent and screamed "ah," being blasted away with both palms burned.

At this point in the fight, although Zhang Hu was very strong, Li Xian didn't lose any of his own style. Zhang Hu slapped the ground with both palms, and with a "boom," the land within several dozen feet sank deeply. Zhang Hu borrowed the force to fly up, grabbing a tree branch and hanging high above.

Feeling the burning in his palms, he was very angry and kept cursing: "How strange, I was actually injured by a kid like you! Damn it, if my tiger beast hadn't died, and I hadn't practiced solo martial arts for over ten years, I would have captured you in one move!"

Li Xian coldly snorted, "All talk." He swept his sword across the ground, and several stones shot fiercely forward. Zhang Hu picked up three leaves and threw them out. They cut through the stones and shot straight toward Li Xian.

Li Xian stepped with the Seven Star Steps, skillfully avoiding them. Zhang Hu was very surprised and shot a few more times. Li Xian could always barely avoid them.

Zhang Hu was indeed extremely weak—barely at the third realm, with many injuries and inconveniences. Without a strange tiger by his side, many of his martial arts couldn't be used. But Li Xian's repeated clever dodging truly allowed him to fight back and forth.

It was still astonishing.

Zhang Hu let go and pounced. In the dense forest, a fierce battle ensued. Zhang Hu bullied the weak with his strong momentum. Li Xian skillfully dodged and evaded, using all the martial arts of his lifetime: Clear Wind Leg, Green Silk Palm, Gang Thunder Finger, Waning Sun Blood-Draining Sword...

If your move was strong, I would avoid it.

The Waning Sun Blood-Draining Sword was exquisite and peerless, the Gang Thunder Finger and Iron Bronze Body were uncommonly fierce, the Green Silk Palm had refined qi circulation, and the Vast Leg, Clear Wind Leg, and Seven Star Steps allowed for calm retreat.

His qi capacity was abundant, his foundation very rich.

The red mole between Li Xian's eyebrows flashed with faint light, his martial arts phenomena displaying their full power. He took full advantage of Zhang Hu's weaknesses, becoming more enlightened the more he fought.

Suddenly, he thrust out with his sword, his whole body lightly shaking. Ethereal immortal sounds vibrated three times, chest drum thunder sounds rumbling...

This sword had been accumulating power for a long time—it was the "Purple Qi from the East" of the Waning Sun Blood-Draining Sword, while simultaneously using the sword as a finger to add the "Gang Thunder Finger" killing finger. Over a dozen zhang of inner qi was poured into this strike.

Zhang Hu roared angrily, neither dodging nor avoiding. He gathered his qi and shook, his whole body bursting out with nearly a zhang of golden light. He took the sword strike head-on, only breaking half an inch of skin. But with the sword tip pressing against him, he was smashed into a cliff face.

With a "bang," spiderweb cracks spread across the cliff face.

Zhang Hu was about to counterattack when suddenly a soft sword came cutting cunningly. Although he felt this sword was weak and had no inner qi, he still withdrew his hand, not daring to be careless.

Wen Caishang held her sword and said, "Li Lang, twin swords united."
