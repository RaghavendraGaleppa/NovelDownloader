# Chapter 10: Severing Fate Palm

Amidst the vast mountain ranges and undulating green forests, two figures leaned against a tree, panting heavily—Lin Shan and Old Man Pu. 

What frustrated Lin Shan was that while they had fled together for the first half-hour, he'd spent the latter half supporting Old Man Pu as they ran. 

That's right! He had initially thought Old Man Pu, with his wealth of experience in wilderness survival and status as a seasoned martial artist who had tempered his internal organs, would be someone he could rely on. 

Unexpectedly, while Old Man Pu was indeed skilled, his advanced age meant his stamina couldn't keep up! After running for just half an hour, he was exhausted and had to lean on the younger man for support.

"They shouldn't be able to catch up now, right? We've come so far," Lin Shan muttered. 

He estimated they had covered thirty to forty li in the past hour. Fortunately, as martial artists, they could rest briefly and continue running if needed.

Old Man Pu, still catching his breath, took several large gulps from the water pouch at his waist before wiping his mouth. 

"That should be enough. I didn't expect you to be such a good runner. Climb up and keep watch!"

Lin Shan rolled his eyes but scaled the tree in a few quick steps. Gazing into the distance, he saw an endless sea of trees, layered peaks, and lush greenery. There was no telling where people might be, but for safety's sake, he dutifully kept his eyes trained behind them.

...

About a quarter-hour later, amidst the rustling autumn leaves, a faint scream came from about a hundred paces to their right.

"Ah! You bastards—"

Lin Shan, with his sharpened martial artist's vision, turned to look. Not far away in the woods, two black-clad figures were rifling through a corpse. 

They had indeed been followed!

Old Man Pu clambered up the tree as well, his expression grave as he observed the scene. 

"What now? Which way do we run?" Lin Shan whispered.

"No point running. They've already picked up our trail," Old Man Pu shook his head as he watched the two men finish their search and begin tracking their way.

In their earlier panic, neither Lin Shan nor Old Man Pu had taken the time to conceal their tracks. The black-clad pursuers were clearly part of an organized group, skilled enough to follow their trail with ease.

"Then we fight! Two against two—we still have a chance," Lin Shan licked his lips, the earlier battle having stirred his bloodlust. Had Chief Wang not been defeated and the other escorts scattered, he was certain he could have finished off Scarface.

Of course, this was merely his own assessment.

In Lin Shan's mind, while Scarface losing his weapon had been a lucky break, fairness had no place in life-or-death struggles. If an opponent showed weakness, you pressed the advantage!

Losing the initiative meant being forced into constant defense, and prolonged defense inevitably led to mistakes. Though the outcome of their earlier duel had been uncertain, Lin Shan believed his odds had been favorable.

Old Man Pu had no idea what he was thinking and didn't respond. Instead, he focused intently on the approaching black-clad figures. When they were about twenty paces away, he suddenly spoke.

"The taller one is likely at the Breath Exchange realm. The shorter, stocky one leading him is a master who's tempered his organs."

Lin Shan had no idea how Old Man Pu could tell, but he trusted the older man's judgment and quickly offered a plan: 

"When they reach the tree, we ambush them together and take out the stocky one first. The taller, weaker one will be easy pickings afterward."

"No!" Old Man Pu immediately rejected the idea. "We ambush the weaker one first, then team up against the stronger."

Lin Shan couldn't help but doubt Old Man Pu's combat ability. After all, the man was sixty years old—if he got winded just from running, could he really hold his own against an organ-tempered expert? If he couldn't, they'd both be doomed!

"What's with that look, brat?" Old Man Pu scowled. "I've traveled the land for forty years! In my youth, I was a renowned fighter in Qinghe County—countless have fallen to my blade!"

Yeah, yeah. And if I'm not mistaken, weren't you the one leading the charge when we fled the valley earlier?

Naturally, Lin Shan kept these thoughts to himself—he still needed the old man's help.

"You'll understand when you've seen more of the world. Always go for the surest option.

"Ambushing the weaker one first gives us the highest chance of success. After that, two against one means we can fight or flee as needed.

"If we target the stronger one and fail, it becomes two against two, and the situation spirals out of control!"

Of course, Old Man Pu kept one thought to himself: If they failed in a two-on-two fight, the kid might escape, but where would an old man like him run?

But Lin Shan, new to the martial world, found the logic sound. "Right—better to cut off one finger than wound ten. Master Pu, you're truly wise!"

By now, the two black-clad men were only ten paces away. The pair in the tree held their breath, watching intently.

When the pursuers finally reached the base of the tree, Old Man Pu flung a handful of lime downward and roared. The two men looked up just in time to be blinded by the white powder.

As the lime burned their eyes, Old Man Pu smoothly drew his blade and leapt from the tree, slashing at the stocky man.

Lin Shan silently applauded—the sequence was executed flawlessly, clearly the result of long practice. The old man was truly a crafty fox.

Wait... Hadn't they agreed to target the weaker one first? Wasn't he attacking the wrong person?

But there was no time to hesitate now. Sticking to the original plan, Lin Shan jumped down and swung his blade at the taller man.

The tall black-clad man was rubbing his eyes furiously, tears streaming down his face. Hearing the blade's whistle, he dodged frantically. But as Old Man Pu had predicted, being at the same Breath Exchange realm and blinded, he was no match for Lin Shan.

After a few exchanges, Lin Shan's blade found its mark, sending the man crashing to the ground with a howl. A quick follow-up strike separated his head from his shoulders.

"An old man at home is a treasure indeed! The older the ginger, the spicier it is!" Lin Shan silently praised Old Man Pu's cunning.

Turning, he saw the stocky black-clad man—confirmed as an organ-tempered expert—with bloodshot eyes that had mostly recovered. He was locked in fierce combat with Old Man Pu, though a bleeding gash on his chest showed the ambush had succeeded.

Old Man Pu swung his twin blades laboriously, panting heavily, while the stocky man fought back with powerful palm strikes. Despite his injury, he was overwhelming the older escort.

"Brat! Quit gawking and help me!" Old Man Pu shouted.

Lin Shan rushed in with his blade, but only upon engaging the man did he realize the pressure Old Man Pu had been under.

The stocky man's breath came in powerful gusts, his entire body radiating explosive strength. His palms moved with practiced precision, each strike deliberate and formidable.

Unlike Lin Shan's wild slashes, the man's palm techniques were clearly refined—he undoubtedly possessed a ranked martial art, one he had mastered to perfection. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to suppress both of them despite his injury.

Martial arts in the martial world were plentiful—Iron Sand Palm, Eagle Claw Fist, Iron Shirt, and the like. But these were all external techniques, crude and unranked.

True internal martial arts were those that incorporated inner energy and true qi, with unique meridian pathways and energy circulation methods. These were closely guarded secrets of major clans and sects.

Unless one was a direct disciple of a prestigious sect, like Old Man Pu—a mere hired blade—access to profound techniques was nearly impossible.

The Lin Family, with its innate realm expert, naturally possessed advanced martial arts. But as a non-core disciple, Lin Shan had only been taught the basic Breeze Swordsmanship.

...

After over a hundred exchanges, Old Man Pu finally found an opening to catch his breath. As he thrust his blade toward the enemy's vitals, he urged Lin Shan, 

"Use whatever secret techniques you have, boy! With that half-baked swordplay, you couldn't scratch him if you tried!"

Lin Shan cursed inwardly. What secret techniques? In his past life, the closest he'd come was two and a half years of basketball practice!

In the decade since transmigrating into the Lin Family, the only thing resembling training was... calisthenics? Wait, how did the Breeze Swordsmanship go again? Damn it, he always blanked under pressure!

The tragic realization struck Lin Shan—though he'd become a martial artist, he'd never learned any proper skills.

Wait... That wasn't entirely true. He did have one innate-level technique.

Severing Fate Palm!
