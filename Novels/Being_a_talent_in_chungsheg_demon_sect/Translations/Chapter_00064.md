# Chapter 64: Day of Auspicious Omen, Seven Martial Slayers of Immortals!

"This, this... this..."

Having lived for decades and forged the formidable reputation of the 'Martial Suppressor King,' this was the first time Ji Xiongying felt a sense of near absurdity.

As Lu Yang raised his hand, a talisman-scribed yellow paper would appear beside him, then ignite. Following that, various phenomena utterly unlike martial arts would emerge: sword qi slicing through the air, five bolts of thunder striking down, golden light appearing out of nowhere—each piece of yellow paper brought with it a fatal danger!

*Whoosh—!*

Sword qi grazed Ji Xiongying's cheek, lightning struck him, leaving his body numb, and his full-force punch was inexplicably blocked by a golden light.

"Impossible!"

Ji Xiongying retreated again, daring not to engage Lu Yang further. He gritted his teeth, looking at Lu Yang with a mixture of fear and hidden yearning.

The next second, a title leapt into his mind: *Immortal*!?

Lu Yang's methods at this moment were simply like those of an immortal from old tales, instantly igniting his desire for eternal life.

Thinking of this, Ji Xiongying once again put distance between himself and Lu Yang, his voice filled with agitation. "Wait, we don't have any real enmity, do we? How about this: if you join my Imperial Worship Hall and give me a copy of that yellow paper technique, you can choose anything you want—ten thousand taels of gold, or a fiefdom!"

"Anything I want?" Lu Yang shook his head and chuckled. *Why would I need to choose? This entire Great Zhou is the Saint Sect's secret realm; it's already mine! You dare to promise me my own property?*

"Alright, I am quite interested in the Martial Dao Heavenly Human method..."

"This is my *Power Over All*!" Ji Xiongying didn't hesitate, directly taking out a classic text and throwing it to Lu Yang. "It only has half a volume inside. Give me your art, and I'll give you the remaining half!"

Lu Yang remained silent.

Ji Xiongying's ambition was practically written on his face, and Lu Yang naturally saw it. However, he didn't care, nor was it possible for him to transmit cultivation methods to Ji Xiongying. After all, it offered no benefit to his cultivation of the Sage Thief, and it would also violate sect rules.

"What a pity," Lu Yang shook his head, put away *Power Over All*, and glanced indifferently at Ji Xiongying. Then, his figure suddenly dispersed, intending to leave directly.

"Trying to run!?"

Seeing Lu Yang's flesh and blood body directly disintegrate into an ethereal white mist, Ji Xiongying roared in anger, his face showing even deeper yearning. *Immortal arts! Absolutely immortal arts! I must obtain them!*

"Power Over All!"

Ji Xiongying exhaled deeply, raised his hand, and clenched his fingers. Surging qi and blood poured into his hand, turning his entire palm blood-red in an instant. In that split second, Lu Yang seemed to see a vast landscape of mountains and rivers slowly unfolding before his eyes. Within it, scholars rose with the roosters, farmers rested at sunset, martial artists roamed the jianghu, and merchants conducted their trade—the myriad aspects of the mortal world, clearly representing the Great Zhou's dynastic fate and the general trend of the world.

*Power Over All* was also a *fist that covered all under heaven*!

Ji Xiongying's fist-intent had no physical form; it was purely a mental oppression, the accumulated spiritual essence of Ji Xiongying, a Martial Dao Heavenly Human, transcending the boundaries of martial arts.

However—

"You're trying to compare mental strength with me? I cultivate immortality; I have spiritual sense!"

Ji Xiongying's fist-intent might have been unstoppable against crude martial artists who only understood physical brawling like himself, but it was futile when used against Lu Yang.

*Boom!*

With a thought from Lu Yang, Ji Xiongying's fist-intent shattered instantly. The national trend, the vast mountains and rivers—all were directly swept away by his spiritual sense.

"You can actually withstand my fist?" Ji Xiongying gnashed his steel-like teeth. "Again!"

His answer, however, was a cold sneer.

"Obstinate."

As his voice fell, dozens of talismans appeared out of thin air. With the Myriad Spirit Banner on hand, he had brought ample talismans for this excursion and wasn't concerned about their consumption.

The talismans shattered in unison, transforming into a torrent of sword qi that rained down on Ji Xiongying, causing him to let out a scream. Blood instantly stained the sky. However, his physique, comparable to that of a Qi Condensation Great Perfection cultivator, was truly formidable. Although the Sword Qi Talismans could cut through his flesh, they couldn't sever his bones.

By the time the sword qi dissipated, Ji Xiongying had been turned into a man of blood. Every inch of his body was mangled, as if he had just been subjected to a thousand cuts. He dared not linger and vanished from his spot in the blink of an eye.

"He certainly ran decisively..."

Lu Yang frowned slightly. This avatar of his specialized in martial arts and relied entirely on talismans to defeat enemies. Although he could fly, his speed was actually not as fast as Ji Xiongying's.

Lu Yang's expression was odd. The life force of a Martial Dao Heavenly Human exceeded his expectations. Despite Ji Xiongying's tragic and pathetic state, as long as he escaped, a few days of good rest would allow him to recover mostly. *A physique comparable to Qi Condensation Great Perfection, yet without corresponding physical divine abilities.*

"Truly good material for refining corpses..."

Thinking of this, Lu Yang felt a little self-reproach. Indeed, proximity to ink makes one black. Even a good person like him, after spending so long in the Saint Sect, had become cruel.

"...I'm not that kind of person," Lu Yang shook his head. Besides, corpse refining was too inefficient. Refining them instantly with the Myriad Spirit Banner was undoubtedly more effective.

That being said, Lu Yang had no intention of specializing in this path. After all, once this life ended, he would certainly choose his cultivation base to carry over, and the Myriad Spirit Banner couldn't be taken with him.

"I'll worry about that in the next life!"

With that thought, Lu Yang directly dispersed his body, then silently landed in an alley in the capital and reformed, thus blending into the crowd.

***

"As expected, he lost. That's normal."

In Tianjing City, at the Wei family residence, the Yun family ancestor calmly withdrew his gaze. Ji Xiongying's defeat was within his expectations; in fact, it would have been strange if he had won.

After all, this manipulation of karma meant that the purpose of Ji Xiongying's battle with Lu Yang wasn't to win, but to make Ji Xiongying discover Lu Yang's existence, then slowly disseminate that information, eventually influencing other Heavenly Humans, and finally uniting all Heavenly Humans to jointly deal with Lu Yang!

As long as his avatar was slain, his true body would inevitably show itself!

For this, he had already devised a 'fortune,' or rather, bait, just waiting for a fish to bite. Now was an excellent opportunity. Thinking of this, he immediately began to manipulate karma again.

Almost simultaneously, Ji Xiongying, who had just escaped and dared not return to the imperial palace, only fleeing towards the outskirts of the capital, was now lying low in a mountain forest. His initial intention was simply to evade Lu Yang.

However, as he hid, he 'accidentally' discovered a sealed stone chamber within a hidden mountain cave. Inside sat a skeleton.

"This is..."

Ji Xiongying approached the skeleton and saw it clutching a dusty classic text. He immediately reached out, took it, and casually flipped it open.

"...Hm!?"

One glance made Ji Xiongying's eyes widen, followed by an expression of disbelief and ecstasy. "Heaven truly helps me!"

The author of the book was unnamed, and the content was merely a record:

"Immortals exist in this world, unaging and undying. Slaying them and consuming their flesh can grant longevity... However, immortal arts are profound and difficult to defeat. After decades of diligent research, I finally comprehended a method to slay immortals before my death... It requires seven grand masters wielding seven divine weapons to join forces and form a formation on the Day of Auspicious Omen..."

*Day of Auspicious Omen, Seven Martial Slayers of Immortals!*

Besides the background, the book also recorded the forging methods for the "seven divine weapons," which Ji Xiongying read with rapt attention, his ambition rekindled.

"Hahahahaha! This king truly has great fortune and great destiny!"

"If I kill that immortal, I will surely gain eternal life!"

Amidst his laughter, Ji Xiongying's consciousness became increasingly obsessed. Karma clouded his mind, leaving him with no thoughts other than "slaying immortals and gaining longevity."
