# Chapter 43: The Chase

Standing atop the giant's shoulder, Hu Le'er delivered a solid punch to his massive head and said:

"Big Yuan, save your breath! We need to leave quickly—these three treasures in my hands absolutely cannot be lost!"

As she spoke, Hu Le'er produced two small jade vials. She opened one, releasing a tiny glowing orb that she promptly swallowed. Then she tossed the other vial whole into the giant's mouth.

"With the help of this [Emperor's Nectar], you should break through to the third rank soon!" she declared. "Once that happens, our [Peach Blossom Mountain] can claim a few more territories!"

"When we reach the outer lands, you take these three treasures and burrow straight to the earth's core. Don't come out until you've advanced to the third rank—then come find me!"

"I'll lead our pursuers on a merry chase in the meantime!"

After Hu Le'er finished her instructions, Big Yuan spoke up:

"Elder Sister, be careful! Human cultivators are cunning beyond measure. With all these treasures on you, who knows how many will come hunting!"

"Don't worry about me. With the peach branch Grandmother gave me, I can at least preserve my life no matter what."

"Give me one of your heart-hairs. If something happens to me, I'll burn it—then you mustn't come after me. Return directly to [Peach Blossom Mountain]!"

"Yes, Elder Sister!"

Obediently, Big Yuan plucked a single golden strand from his chest and handed it to Hu Le'er.

The moment they stepped out of the Meat Market, the two immediately went their separate ways.

Big Yuan, carrying the three great demon bloodline artifacts, activated his innate ability [Earthwalk] and burrowed deep into the ground, heading straight for the planet's core.

Meanwhile, Hu Le'er summoned a glowing aura and flew westward.

Not long after their departure, hordes of cultivators followed their trail, all racing toward the outer lands.

The common man's crime lies in his treasure!

Hu Le'er carried with her unimaginable wealth—vast quantities of spirit stones, the [Pure Yang Lantern], and the [Emperor's Nectar]. Any one of these alone would drive men to madness with greed!

Moreover, humans and demons had always been natural enemies. Hunting down these two peak second-rank demon cultivators and then hiding in the inner lands would make them untouchable even by fourth-rank demon saints.

Hu Le'er's appearance had drawn every eye at the auction, and none of these cultivators would let her escape so easily.

Han Yue's first—and likely last—auction thus came to an abrupt and anticlimactic end. He had been looking forward to the remaining events, but with Hu Le'er's departure, over half the attendees had left. Seeing this, the auction organizers simply called an early end to proceedings.

Back in his room, Han Yue carefully examined the four third-rank items he'd acquired.

Holding the [Supreme Profound Light Talisman] at the ready, he could feel the tremendous power contained within—enough to make his spirit tremble. This talisman contained the full-force strike of a third-rank orthodox sect elder, making it Han Yue's most powerful offensive tool currently.

Comparing it to his own abilities, Han Yue estimated that if he unleashed his [Thoughtless Slash] with all his might, burning through every drop of his spiritual energy, it might barely reach third-rank power—but would still fall far short of this talisman's might. Moreover, such desperate measures would leave him severely injured, making it only usable as a last resort.

As for the other three third-rank materials—[Stoneborn Flame], [Mao Hour Gold], and [Yin Hour Silver]—Han Yue had no immediate use for them. Handling them, he could feel their extraordinary properties and mystical natures. He could only hope they would prove useful when forging his Dao vessel someday, saving him the trouble of trading for alternatives.

In a way, Han Yue had to thank Hu Le'er for causing chaos. Had she and her companion not arrived with the [Jade Peach], drawing everyone's attention and cooling the auction's earlier atmosphere, Han Yue would never have acquired four third-rank treasures for a mere ten thousand spirit stones!

With this goal achieved, Han Yue felt his thoughts flowing smoothly and his spirit complete. He found himself suddenly devoid of any lingering attachment to the Meat Market, eager only to embark on his journey of cultivation.

Now he only needed to condense the last few Thunder Nurturing runes to bring [Thunder Nurturing Body] to its second great perfection—a process that would take less than two more months.

Storing away his treasures, Han Yue settled into another round of secluded cultivation.

Restoring his body and accumulating spiritual energy had become second nature. With his mind at ease, his progress felt divinely aided—his energy circulating with unusual liveliness as he swiftly condensed another Thunder Nurturing rune.

Time slipped quietly by in this daily rhythm of cultivation.

A month passed in the blink of an eye.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of kilometers to the west, Hu Le'er lay gravely wounded at the bottom of a small lake, silently recovering.

Over this past month, she had struggled to survive against over a hundred hunting parties led by peak second-rank cultivators. After countless battles, she now teetered on the brink of exhaustion.

Human greed and shamelessness had far exceeded Hu Le'er's expectations. She never imagined that over half the auction attendees would abandon the event entirely to pursue her relentlessly.

Though she had escaped swiftly and decisively, these human cultivators clung to her trail like maggots to rotting flesh, constantly tracking her down and ambushing her with underhanded tactics.

She now understood where she'd gone wrong, but it was too late—she no longer possessed the means to escape alone.

Hu Le'er's only hope now was to buy time. If Big Yuan could advance soon, his third-rank power could crush these insignificant foes and escort her safely back to [Peach Blossom Mountain].

At the lake's bottom, she had set up concealment arrays while suppressing her aura and taking healing medicines, waiting silently.

Unbeknownst to her, cultivators were converging within a hundred-kilometer radius. Her location had already been pinpointed—the concealment arrays useless against their tracking methods.

The hunters moved patiently, avoiding conflict among themselves as they tacitly agreed to eliminate Hu Le'er first before settling other matters.

Finally, the encirclement closed completely—there would be no escape this time.

Ten peak second-rank cultivators approached the lakeshore—three being major Meat Market dealers, the rest core members of other Guizhou cultivation factions. Behind them lurked over two hundred more cultivators in the surrounding woods, nearly all at second-rank perfection.

Every eye fixed on the water's surface, every hand ready with techniques, all waiting for Hu Le'er to emerge.
