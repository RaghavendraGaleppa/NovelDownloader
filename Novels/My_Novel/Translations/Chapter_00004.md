# Chapter 4: The Guard Recruitment Exam, A Day to Shine

Li Xian focused on a single task, constantly honing his patience. Both his physical strength and his state of mind had improved.

"Though weeding is a minor skill, it can still bring me benefits," he thought.

He was a little excited. He had originally thought that even if he mastered weeding to a deeper level, what could it possibly achieve? Perhaps just pulling weeds faster?

But that wasn't the case. Weeding was merely the surface. When any technique is practiced deeply, the profound truths within are gradually unearthed.

Li Xian's weeding was now incredibly proficient. With a gentle sweep of his hands, without needing much force, a bundle of weeds would be pulled from the earth.

This manor had excellent Feng Shui, with weeds deeply rooted and exceptionally difficult to pull. Among all the servants in the manor, there were probably no more than five who could achieve his level of skill.

Of course...

Such menial tasks were something only he would do.

"It's been a while since I checked on my younger brother. I'll go ask Bi Hao today to see if I can send a letter back home."

It wasn't late yet, but Li Xian had already finished weeding the area early. He hurried back to the servants' quarters and was about to knock on the door when he heard voices from inside.

The voice of the steward, Luo Fang, rang out first:

"Xiao Hao, although you manage all the servants under me and seem to have a glorious surface-level position, if we're talking about status, you're still just a low-ranking servant in the end."

There were eleven servants' quarters here.

Each servants' quarter had about a hundred people.

These hundred people formed a "class," and each class had a class leader. Li Xian was the twenty-seventh member of the ninth class.

Bi Hao was the class leader of the first class.

Though he appeared glorious on the surface, his status was no different. The only reason he could manage so many servants was because his uncle supported him.

But the manor was deep and complex, and Luo Fang wasn't exactly a big shot either.

"You're right, Uncle Luo. I'm very clear on that point," Bi Hao said with an ingratiating laugh, thinking Uncle Luo had come to discipline him.

"I came to you this time to bring you a piece of news. Lord Pang is preparing to recruit a strong and robust guard from among the servants. If you become a guard, things will be different. You could receive a reward from the Madam and practice some rough martial arts."

"Uncle Luo, is this true? You must help me!"

Immediately after, a "thump" came from inside the room.

It was Bi Hao kneeling and begging.

He also poured a cup of hot tea.

Luo Fang nodded secretly, took the hot tea, blew away the tea foam on top, took a small sip, and put on the airs of a big shot while savoring the low-quality tea.

He let out a long breath and said leisurely:

"Naturally, this is crucial for your future. To be honest with you, I used to be a guard myself. Later, I transitioned from a guard to a steward. Although you are my grand-nephew, if you want to truly make a name for yourself, you have to fight for it yourself!"

"Lord Pang asked me to inform everyone, telling any interested servants to report to him and prepare for the guard recruitment exam."

"I'm telling you first."

Bi Hao's eyebrows shot up with joy. "How can these lowly beasts compete with me? The position of guard is definitely mine!"

Luo Fang said calmly:

"Don't say that. The guard exam also values martial arts talent, bone structure and strength, as well as endurance and temperament. Although you have some martial arts foundation, you've never had any real combat experience. And... those lowly beasts aren't stupid either. How could they let go of such an opportunity? They'll naturally fight desperately for it, even willing to die in the exam. Tell me... do you really have complete confidence?"

"This..." Bi Hao heard this analysis and, even though he had confidence, he wasn't so sure anymore.

"And your uncle's influence doesn't reach Lord Pang. If you fail the selection, this opportunity will be lost," Luo Fang said meaningfully.

"Please advise me, Uncle. In the future, I will serve you like an ox or a horse," Bi Hao kowtowed three times.

"This matter is simple," Luo Fang said. "During this period, focus on practicing your fist. Master the Three-Aspect Fist I taught you thoroughly. Second, assign those lowly beasts who look tall, strong, and full of energy to the most arduous labor. Wear down their physical strength."

"Uncle Luo, this plan is brilliant!" Bi Hao beamed with joy.

"It's not just that," Luo Fang said, shaking his head with a light laugh. "Lord Pang asked me to spread the news. I wouldn't dare disobey, but I can choose to mention it at night, when everyone is asleep. I'll try to keep the number of people who know to a minimum."

Bi Hao kowtowed three times with a thud. "Uncle Luo, I can never repay your great kindness."

"As long as you remember my kindness," Luo Fang said. "There are still fifteen days until the guard recruitment exam. Make good use of your time."

"Uncle Luo, let me see you out," Bi Hao said, supporting Luo Fang as they walked out of the room.

Li Xian heard every word of their conversation, feeling both angry and delighted. He didn't dare stay in this place for long and quickly ran back to his desolate room.

"This Bi Hao... his strength isn't bad, yet he still uses such underhanded tricks."

"But it's a good thing. Since I know about it now, I'll lie low and secretly sign up too!"

Li Xian suppressed the excitement in his heart.

In the backyard of his desolate room, he practiced the "Bull Fist" over and over again.

Whether he could stand out this time depended entirely on this set of fist techniques!

By evening, Bi Hao made his routine inspection, and Li Xian acted as if nothing had happened.

Bi Hao nodded slightly. "Not bad, not bad, you did a good job today too. Xiao Li, you can go to the accounting office and collect three coins as a reward."

"Master Bi, I see your face is glowing and your forehead is full, you must have encountered some good news, right?" Li Xian wiped the sweat from his forehead, pretending to be extremely exhausted.

"Ahahaha," Bi Hao laughed. "You little brat, you have a good eye. Whatever good news it is, don't ask. It definitely has nothing to do with you."

"You just honestly pull these weeds. If you do a good job, you can still get a few coins as a reward. Don't think too much about other things, it's a waste of brainpower."

His tone was filled with disdain and contempt.

Just as he was speaking,

a thought suddenly flashed through his mind, and he looked Li Xian up and down.

This kid is quite tall, and he can do such exhausting work as weeding effortlessly... his physical strength shouldn't be bad.

"Xiao Li, there are still patches of desolate rooms and fields of weeds. How about this, you clear one desolate room a day. I see you're working pretty hard, so I specially mentioned it to my uncle. If you do a good job every day, you can get three coins as a reward," Bi Hao said proudly.

He thought that with just a few words, he could get rid of a potential opponent.

And the other party would still be grateful to him.

Li Xian sneered in his heart but put on a surprised expression on his face.

"Mas... Master Bi, is this true? Clearing one desolate room a day... I can get three coins? In that case, wouldn't I get thirty coins in ten days?"

"Ahahaha," Bi Hao laughed heartily, feeling incredibly pleased. "I didn't expect you, a little servant, to be quite good at arithmetic."

After Bi Hao left,

Li Xian's expression returned to calm. He secretly clenched his fist. He must seize this opportunity!

"Lie low... lie low..."

"During these fifteen days, I must strive to practice the Bull Fist to the minor success level!"

"Only by catching Bi Hao off guard on the day of the exam do I have a chance of winning!"

"Low-ranking servants will never have a day to shine. But if I become a guard... it seems I can also get in touch with some rough martial arts!"

A surge of determination rose in Li Xian's heart, his gaze firm and bright.
