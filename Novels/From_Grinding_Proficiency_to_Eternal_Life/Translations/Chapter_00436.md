# Chapter 436: Ten Thousand Soul Banner

For the first time in two hundred years, her decaying optic nerves began to regenerate. Pupils took shape within the murky whites of her eyes.

She had cultivated the method of the Clear Sword Heart, merging with her sword to achieve martial enlightenment. This naturally gave birth to a Wisdom Eye.

Now, her withered body, nourished by the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, was reviving. Dry meridians received sweet rain, and decaying flesh revived inch by inch. Even the sword bone that had been silent for two hundred years was reborn under the scouring of the spiritual flow.

"Spiritual energy... This is true spiritual energy!"

The mud-caked old man frantically tore at the earthen shell covering his body. The moment his new skin touched the air, it caused the earth-attribute spiritual energy within a hundred zhang to form a vortex.

He knelt on the ground, weeping bitterly, his fingernails digging deep into the ground. He had relied on the earth's veins to survive in the Divine Martial Realm for two hundred years, but it was only now that he understood what true "Essence of the Earth" was.

In the Divine Martial Realm, he had been like a rat digging for food in a latrine. Now, he finally tasted the flavor a human should have.

"If only the Divine Martial Realm had such spiritual energy..."

The old man wiped away his murky tears with his rough hands, trembling as he scraped off the dried mud shells on his body. "How could I have degenerated into such a ghostly, inhuman form? Heaven has pity, Heaven has pity..."

He suddenly realized his mistake and bowed deeply to Xu Yunfan. "Many thanks, True Person!"

He knew his place clearly. The other party was a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Dao, far beyond what an ordinary person like him could compare to. Even if there was a shred of a connection from the Dao Sect's incense and fire, it belonged to Bi Yuan and Xu Yunfan. They were, at best, familiar strangers.

What was most shocking was the black shadow formed by the incense and fire.

This spiritual projection of the previous sect master of the Dao Sect was currently bathing in pure spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

The black mist formed by the distracting thoughts of the believers receded like a tide. After peeling away layer by layer, it actually revealed the phantom of a Daoist in a green robe with white hair and a youthful complexion.

His eyebrows and eyes were clear, and his robes fluttered, just like the figure who had once governed the Dao Sect.

He looked at his own solidified hands and suddenly bowed deeply to Xu Yunfan. "This old Daoist, Zhang Ziyang, thanks you for the grace of rebirth!"

However, Xu Yunfan was staring at Xue Zhen—the purple-robed old man. Above his head, a phantom of a snake entwined with a tortoise was floating.

This old monster who had cultivated the "Mystic Spirit Transformation Dao" to its extreme had actually touched the threshold of Foundation Establishment in the instant he broke through the world!

What a pity...

Xu Yunfan glanced at the other party's body, which was only gathered by spiritual energy. Without a physical body, if he continued to cultivate, he could only walk the path of a Ghost Immortal.

"Senior Martial Uncle, your physical body has been destroyed. It will be as difficult as ascending to heaven to walk the orthodox path again."

Xu Yunfan sighed. "Even if I were to take action, I would need to find a先天元灵 (Primordial Spirit Origin) or such a heaven and earth treasure to reshape your physical body."

His gaze swept over Zhang Ziyang's slightly trembling spiritual body, his voice growing even deeper. "Such treasures born of heaven and earth gain spiritual intelligence the moment they are born. How could they be willing to sacrifice themselves for others?"

As for other methods, the price was too great, and it might even damage one's own Dao foundation if not careful. Xu Yunfan naturally would not use them easily.

Upon hearing this, Zhang Ziyang did not show any sign of dejection. Instead, a composed smile bloomed on his youthful face amidst the white hair.

His green-robed phantom swayed slightly as he was about to respond, when suddenly, an invisible ripple spread from the depths of the earth beneath his feet.

"Boom!"

A violent tide of spiritual energy suddenly erupted from the depths of the True Martial Peak's earth veins, like a dragon that had been sleeping for a thousand years awakening.

A torrent of spiritual energy, pure to the point of being nearly substantial, gushed out from the convergence of the earth veins, instantly turning the area within a hundred zhang into a sea of clouds with churning spiritual mist.

Zhang Ziyang's dharma body,凝聚 (condensed) from the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, trembled violently. His green-robed phantom flickered under the impact of the spiritual tide, nearly dissipating like a candle in the wind.

The others, who possessed complete physical bodies, felt nothing of the sort. Instead, they felt incredibly comfortable as the surrounding spiritual energy grew denser.

Their flesh and blood bodies were like precious boats crossing the world, filtering the violent spiritual tide into gentle nourishment, allowing their souls and spirits to dwell safely within.

But the spiritual projection formed by incense and wishes faced the violence of heaven and earth almost in a naked state.

Bi Yuan, standing by, saw Zhang Ziyang's spiritual body beginning to disperse, his soul almost shattered by the constantly surging spiritual energy. He hurriedly said, "Yunfan, is there any way to keep Senior Martial Uncle Ziyang?"

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered. He reached into his怀里 (bosom) and pulled out a blood banner, which he had looted from the Foundation Establishment True Person who had followed them into the Divine Martial Realm to deliver himself as a dish.

This banner was nurtured with blood煞 (killing intent) and had swallowed the essence souls of many cultivators. Even several Foundation Establishment cultivators were trapped within. If the banner was unfurled in the Taihua Void Realm without any suppression, it could sweep away a hundred li of ghost territory. Even if a Foundation Establishment True Person fell into it, most would not come out unscathed.

What a pity, these people were too arrogant and followed into the Divine Martial Realm without any hesitation.

Now that this matter was settled, it naturally needed to be reported to Hundred Peaks True Person.

The involvement of other True Lords was not something he could handle.

The Primordial Origin Sect had many factions, with six True Lords belonging to different schools, and their infighting was far more intense than those orthodox sects could imagine.

Bi Yuan, standing by, saw Xu Yunfan hesitating. He naturally saw the terrifyingly evil blood banner in Xu Yunfan's hand and lowered his voice.

"Regardless of what method is used, if we can keep Senior Martial Uncle Ziyang, we should... Back then, if not for being hurt by love, he could have forcefully taken that step in a world with no spiritual energy and achieved the Land Immortal Realm!"

Bi Yuan shook his head and sighed. "Such is fate. Back then, he was hailed as the second Patriarch of Pure Yang."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan did not hesitate. He immediately channeled his vast True Martial power into the blood banner.

In an instant, the originally sinister blood banner trembled violently. The ferocious faces on the banner let out piercing shrieks. Countless blood-煞 (killing intent) gases surged out like boiling water, but under the scouring of the True Martial power, they transformed into wisps of black smoke and dissipated.

He formed a seal with his left hand and held the banner with his right. The True Martial power around him surged like a river, forming patterns of Black Tortoise and Clouds on the surface of the banner.

The moment these patterns formed, they moved like a snake and a tortoise, as if living creatures were roaming across the banner's surface. Wherever they passed, the originally scarlet banner gradually faded, revealing a profound, ink-black base color.

The essence souls of the cultivators imprisoned in the banner let out sighs of relief. Under the cleansing of the True Martial power, the resentment and killing intent that had entangled them for two hundred years were stripped away inch by inch.

Xu Yunfan stared at the blood banner in his hand, a hint of regret flashing in his eyes.

This Ten Thousand Soul Blood Banner was a supreme evil treasure refined by a Foundation Establishment cultivator with all his life's effort. If he could retain its original power, he would be invincible at the early Foundation Establishment stage.

The Ten Thousand Soul Blood Banner was dark red like coagulated blood. On its surface, one could vaguely see countless twisted faces wailing in pain. Every line was soaked in the cultivator's centuries of effort.

He could feel the terrifying power lurking within the banner. Seven Foundation Establishment cultivators' essence souls resided there, and over a million mortal souls had been refined into blood-煞 (killing intent) gas.

If he were to wield this banner against an enemy, once it was unfurled, early Foundation Establishment cultivators would likely flee at the mere sight of it, unable to even withstand a single clash.

It was unknown how that devil had collected so much blood-煞 (killing intent).

"What a pity."
