# Chapter 7: Heavenly Spiritual Root, Heaven-Grasping Bottle

Han Zhen's heart thumped, unable to calm down. Could he be the legendary Wood-attribute Heavenly Spiritual Root?

Han Zhen didn't feel that taking over twenty days to achieve Qi Induction was slow. One must know that Mount Caixia had no spirit veins or spirit springs. He also had no cultivation resources like spirit stones, relying entirely on his spiritual root aptitude to perceive the scattered spiritual qi between heaven and earth.

Spirit stones were stones containing spiritual qi, and for cultivators, absorbing the spiritual qi within them would significantly speed up their cultivation. Spirit stones also varied in the attribute of the spiritual power they contained, divisible into Five-Element spirit stones of Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth attributes. Of course, there were also rare attribute spirit stones like Wind and Lightning, corresponding to variant spiritual roots. Thus, the scattered spiritual qi in the world naturally also had attribute distinctions. Spiritual root aptitude affected the efficiency of spiritual qi conversion when cultivating corresponding Five-Element cultivation techniques.

Assuming a game character panel setting, excluding the influence of heaven-defying pills like the Heaven-Mending Pill, one could assume the total points for spiritual root aptitude were 100. A cultivator possessing a Heavenly Spiritual Root could be seen as having all 100 points allocated to a single spiritual root. By analogy, Han Li's four-attribute pseudo spiritual root could be seen as having 100 points evenly distributed among four spiritual root attributes. Therefore, when a four-spiritual-root cultivator practiced Five-Element cultivation techniques, their efficiency in converting heaven and earth spiritual qi was only one-quarter that of a Heavenly Spiritual Root. This corroborated what Han Li would later hear from Wan Xiaoshan outside Mount Tai Nan Valley: that the cultivation speed of a Heavenly Spiritual Root was two to three times that of an ordinary spiritual root. Only dual-spiritual roots and triple-spiritual roots were considered ordinary spiritual roots. As for mutated spiritual roots, they could be seen as a fusion and mutation of several spiritual root attributes, where the points originally distributed across various attributes were combined, naturally resulting in a cultivation speed no less than that of a Heavenly Spiritual Root. Of course, the worse the spiritual root aptitude, the more easily one would be trapped by bottlenecks. The speed of cultivation advancement naturally couldn't be entirely linked to spiritual root aptitude, and Han Zhen felt his guess was very reasonable.

Therefore, calculating based on this method and comparing his own Qi Induction speed with Han Li's four-spiritual-root speed, Han Zhen made a bold guess about his cultivation talent. He might be a Heavenly Spiritual Root, a talent discovered only once every few centuries in the cultivation world, or a variant spiritual root formed by the fusion and sublimation of several spiritual roots, including the Wood spiritual root. Whichever it was, Han Zhen would be a coveted or highly valued individual for cultivation sects in the future. Finally, Han Zhen still considered the blessing of the innate destiny [Heaven Rewards Diligence] during his cultivation of the first layer of the Evergreen Arts.

What if it wasn't a Heavenly Spiritual Root aptitude, but rather the blessing of destiny that gave him a cultivation speed comparable to a Heavenly Spiritual Root? It would be laughable if it turned out to be a misunderstanding. To truly know his spiritual root situation, he would have to wait until the Immortal Ascension Assembly's registration, where a Foundation Establishment senior would perform a bone-viewing examination.

Regardless, Han Zhen at least confirmed that he possessed cultivation aptitude. He was already very satisfied with this result. The next step was to cultivate the first layer of the Evergreen Arts to completion. As for dealing with Doctor Mo, he was currently powerless. Knowing he had impressive aptitude but having to wait painstakingly for the next layers of the cultivation technique made Han Zhen hesitate about staying in the Seven Mysteries Sect.

Han Zhen was aware of Mount Tai Nan Valley's location: Guangui City, in the southernmost part of Lanzhou, which bordered Jingzhou. If Han Zhen truly wanted to go to Mount Tai Nan Valley to find the subsequent layers of the Evergreen Arts, he would need to cross the entirety of Jingzhou. With Han Zhen's current martial arts, self-preservation along the way wouldn't be difficult. The challenge lay in not knowing what kind of cultivators he might encounter. What if the first ones he met were evil cultivators? Wouldn't he just be actively delivering himself as raw material? The cultivation world of the Yue Kingdom was far from peaceful. Han Zhen remembered that the Black Fiend Sect had secretly been capturing rogue cultivators for blood sacrifices to practice their arts. Moreover, there were still three years until the five-yearly Tai Nan Small Gathering. Han Zhen might not be able to acquire the cultivation technique as he wished if he went outside the trade fair period.

After much deliberation, Han Zhen finally calmed down. There was no need to rush into danger. He would systematically cultivate the Evergreen Arts to the eighth layer, and only after learning spells and gaining initial self-preservation abilities, would it be not too late to visit Mount Tai Nan Valley. With the blessing of the [Heaven Rewards Diligence] destiny and knowing his spiritual root talent was also good, Han Zhen was no longer so anxious about his future cultivation. After setting his plan, Han Zhen wholeheartedly focused on cultivating the first layer of the Evergreen Arts. After completing the first layer of the Evergreen Arts, Han Zhen also didn't neglect his mortal martial arts; the existence of true qi and magic power did not conflict. In the Qi Condensation stage, his mortal martial arts could sometimes even become a trump card.

Time slowly flowed by, and in the blink of an eye, Han Zhen had spent more than half a year in the Seven Mysteries Sect. Han Zhen had long since cultivated the first layer of the Evergreen Arts to completion, and not a single wisp more of spiritual qi could be increased within his body. On the other hand, after receiving guidance from Han Zhen, Han Li still took almost three months to sense spiritual qi. It seemed the influence of spiritual root talent was even more pronounced than Han Zhen had imagined. After sensing spiritual qi, Han Li's spiritual qi grew considerably after half a year of intense cultivation, and he successfully passed Doctor Mo's test, being accepted as his personal disciple.

However, Doctor Mo's surprised, even frenzied, expression at the time made Han Li somewhat afraid and feel a sense of unfamiliarity. Moreover, the pseudo true qi he had cultivated had no power whatsoever. From then on, Han Li felt a faint resistance towards the monotonous cultivation.

These past two days, one thing had been troubling Han Li. It had been two days since he had kicked the small green bottle, and he still couldn't unravel its mystery. Han Li hadn't been able to sleep peacefully at night. At first, Han Li tried with all his might but couldn't twist the bottle open. He then tried the blood-binding ritual he'd heard about in stories from Han Zhen, and even tried to infuse it with the pseudo true qi he'd cultivated, but nothing worked. That night, Han Li even thought about going to Zhang Tie, whose strength had become astonishing after cultivating the Elephant Armor Art. But for such an exquisite bottle, Han Li didn't know why, perhaps it was just subconscious, but he didn't want Zhang Tie to know about it. He also considered using tools to smash the bottle open, but the thought of damaging such a peculiar and beautiful bottle made Han Li's heart ache. After pondering for two days, his foot had mostly recovered, but Han Li still hadn't been able to open the small bottle. Han Li's curiosity about what was inside the bottle had now been completely piqued.

After much thought, the only person who could help him and wouldn't covet the small bottle was Brother Zhen. Of course, if there truly was something beneficial for Brother Zhen inside the bottle, Han Li felt it wouldn't be unacceptable to give it to him. Afterwards, Brother Zhen would surely not mistreat him; in the past half year, Han Zhen had given Han Li quite a lot of silver, which he had all sent home.

It just so happened that this day was Han Zhen and Han Li's agreed meeting date. Doctor Mo had already taught Han Li the next two layers of the Evergreen Arts. The original secret meeting spot had also moved from the pool to the foot of Red Water Peak. Initially, Han Li wanted Han Zhen to see Zhang Tie's grimacing face while practicing. Over the past half year, Han Li and Zhang Tie had become inseparable close friends due to their similar backgrounds and compatible personalities, and Zhang Tie had also taken good care of Han Li in their daily lives. Of course, Zhang Tie was unaware of Han Li teaching the nameless incantation to Han Zhen, nor of him picking up a mysterious small green bottle the day before yesterday.

Half an hour later, at the foot of Red Water Peak, Zhang Tie was allowing the waterfall's strong currents to pound his body. Han Li called Han Zhen to the side, away from Zhang Tie's view. After first handing Han Zhen the copied two subsequent layers of the Evergreen Arts, he mysteriously took out the small bottle.
