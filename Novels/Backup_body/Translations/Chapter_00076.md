# Chapter 76: He Arrived as an Immortal!

The vast oppressive aura left everyone in awe.

The gaze of this Netherworld Marshal fell upon the fragmented jade.

The atmosphere instantly became unbearably tense!

After a moment, the Netherworld Marshal spoke again.

"The remnants of the Lord are not his true form."

His eyes flickered as the central head spoke: "Given this, we shall pardon your trespass into the Netherworld. Leave the Lord's remnants behind and depart."

Li Zhengjing's expression darkened, but he remained motionless.

Yuan Zhengfeng, as if struck by lightning, trembled violently within the fragmented jade.

"If you refuse to leave, then we shall kill you all and retrieve the Lord's remnants," the left head declared coldly.

"No!" The right head objected. "The Lord has yet to return from his journey. There must be a greater plan. His remnants may be the key to his return. If we reclaim them now and the Lord is missing a piece in the future, ruining his grand scheme, what then?"

"This matter requires careful consideration," the central head concluded.

"..."

Li Zhengjing exchanged glances with Ghost Valley Lingguan.

Ghost Valley Lingguan's eyes held a trace of strangeness as he whispered, "This legendary Xuancha Ghost King doesn’t seem to be a naturally born Netherworld deity. It might be man-made!"

Li Zhengjing was stunned. "How so?"

Ghost Valley Lingguan wrapped his voice in mana, transmitting it to Li Zhengjing's ears.

"His hundred-zhang-tall body is entirely crafted from Heavenly Domain Divine Stone, with clear signs of carving!"

"Ordinary Heavenly Domain Divine Stone only needs to exceed half a zhang to be carved into a divine body."

"But for a hundred-zhang divine body, the mana of a single Human Immortal is insufficient to sustain it. Therefore, this deity's body contains the combined mana of many Human Immortal-level experts!"

"The mana contains Yin spirits, each with its own consciousness, interfering with one another and causing chaos! The mildest cases, like the Fengdu Great God, retain only their obsessions and duties, functioning like machines. The most severe cases, like Xuji Zhenren, become madmen!"

"The creator's technique is ingenious. He divided it into three heads, and even the six arms and leopard tail each possess their own consciousness to minimize interference!"

"And within this hundred-zhang Heavenly Domain Divine Stone, the unshakable 'divine duty' is to guard this stone bridge!"

Ghost Valley Lingguan whispered, "Its essence is the same as the Fengdu Great God, but its divine body is a hundred zhang tall, containing immense mana. Thus, its power surpasses the Fengdu Great God!"

After a pause, he added, "Its strength exceeds any powerhouse I have ever seen!"

"It's so powerful we can't force our way through!"

Li Zhengjing's expression was complicated as he whispered, "Then what about the opportunities you and I seek?"

Ghost Valley Lingguan also fell into hesitation.

Yuan Zhengfeng suddenly lowered his voice and asked, "This Xuancha Ghost King has different consciousnesses sharing one divine body, bound by the divine duty to guard this place. Does its existence prove the legends of the Netherworld? The realm of death and reincarnation?"

If the Netherworld's existence could be proven, then the ancient legends were true—Netherworld deities existed, and true gods existed!

Then the legends of the Heavenly Court above the Nine Heavens, the immortal true immortals, must also be real!

"The Golden Ship of Salvation once investigated Mount Fengdu!"

"But the Golden Ship's beliefs remain unshaken!"

"They still insist there are no true immortals in the Nine Heavens, and no true gods in the Yellow Springs below!"

Ghost Valley Lingguan said slowly, "At this moment, I roughly understand why the Golden Ship is so certain! Because this Netherworld deity is forged from Heavenly Domain Divine Stone, not a naturally born true god! Most importantly, Xuancha Ghost King's divine spirit will also wither with time..."

Yuan Zhengfeng's tone was grave. "But the legends of the Netherworld, the ancient deities, are right before us."

Li Zhengjing vaguely understood and said, "Senior, are you suggesting this deity was carved based on ancient legends?"

Ghost Valley Lingguan nodded slightly, then added, "There's another possibility!"

He took a deep breath. "This Xuancha Ghost King is the legendary Netherworld Marshal from ancient times!"

"But the divine spirits within its body wither with time. Yet, on the other side of the bridge, in the so-called Netherworld, new divine spirits and mana are continuously infused into it, maintaining its immortality!"

"In other words, Xuancha Ghost King is like a house?" The wall-clinging bird's eyes lit up. "Like one generation aging while new generations move in... On the surface, the house remains the same, but countless generations have passed through it?"

"If so, the so-called Netherworld on the other side might not be the Netherworld as we know it!"

Li Zhengjing pondered. "Just like how the 'Water Ghost' sees the Golden Ship of Salvation as the immortal realm, but it isn’t truly the immortal realm!"

Ghost Valley Lingguan agreed. "The other side might just be a massive pocket realm, not the Netherworld that governs the cycle of reincarnation and connects to the Heavenly Court!"

"I DON'T CARE!!!"

Xuji Zhenren erupted in fury, roaring, "I'm going in! There are true gods inside! I will become immortal, and no one can stop me!"

With a furious bellow, he charged forward, his mana surging, sweeping through the surroundings!

Then the three-headed Xuancha Ghost King used its six arms to summon vast mana and sinister energy, tossing Xuji Zhenren around like a ragdoll!

The Ghost King's divine body didn’t even touch Xuji Zhenren—it beat him from a distance!

"Stop! Stop! I came with the Lord! We're on the same side!" Xuji Zhenren covered his head, howling in pain. "I mean no harm! I just want to join you..."

"..."

Ghost Valley Lingguan retreated in the small boat, whispering, "This Xuancha Ghost King lives up to its legendary title as a Netherworld Marshal! If not for recognizing its Heavenly Domain Divine Stone construction as a pseudo-deity... With its power to crush Xuji Zhenren like this, it might as well be called a true god!"

"In honor of the Lord, we spare your life!"

The central head spoke, hurling Xuji Zhenren to the other end of the broken bridge.

"You think you can force your way in?" The left head sneered. "For countless ages, I have guarded this bridge. Who dares trespass?"

"Well, there was one," the right head interjected. "Twenty years ago, didn’t someone force their way in and then fight their way out? Our predecessors couldn’t stop him, and he shattered this bridge into pieces, exhausting all the mana in this Marshal’s divine body. That’s how we took over and became the new Xuancha Ghost King..."

"Shut up!" The central head turned to the right, scolding. "How can you bring up such a disgraceful incident? In countless ages, this is the only time someone came and went as they pleased. This stain must never be mentioned again!"

"They’re outsiders, why not just say it?" The right head retorted defiantly.

"Wait..."

Li Zhengjing suddenly spoke. "Twenty years ago, someone forced their way past your guard, entered, and then fought their way out?"

"That never happened!" the central head insisted.

"No one can trespass!" the left head declared.

"He called himself the Patriarch of the Human World!" the right head blurted out simultaneously.

"..." The central and left heads silently turned to glare at the fool.

"Old Zhou said he was a creditor and that he’d be back!" the right head added obliviously.

"If he dares return, I’ll kill him!" the central head roared. "The greatest humiliation in countless ages! Only his death can cleanse the shame of all past Xuancha Ghost Kings!"

"I think we might not be able to beat him," the left head muttered timidly.

"..."

Silence fell once more.

Patriarch of the Human World?

Creditor?

Li Zhengjing looked at the fragmented jade in his hand.

He could sense a gaze from within the jade meeting his own.

Their eyes held an indescribable complexity.

This legendary Netherworld deity, a Marshal with power rivaling a true god, couldn’t stop the creditor from trespassing—and the creditor even left unscathed?

Just how powerful was the creditor?

Though in the human world, was he comparable to an immortal?

"The name 'creditor,' I’ve heard it before. Every major immortal sect, Daoist school, Buddhist temple, and even dynasties in the world today have supposedly received heaven-defying, world-shaking opportunities!"

Ghost Valley Lingguan whispered, "Yet over the millennia, they’ve all gradually realized something—these so-called opportunities were actually left behind by an unknown, mysterious entity! And this entity will one day reclaim all of them... Thus, the world owes him a debt, hence 'creditor'!"

He continued softly, "To scheme across the world, ensnaring all major immortal sects, Buddhist schools, and mighty dynasties in his web... His ambition is terrifying. Who would have thought he could rival a true god? Does that mean he’s at the level of a true immortal?"

"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!"

Yuan Zhengfeng whispered, "Anyone as powerful as the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign would trigger celestial phenomena, ascend to the heavens, and be unable to remain in the mortal world! Thus, no one in the human world can surpass the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign’s level!"

He paused, then added solemnly, "All factions believe the creditor is one of the most powerful beings in the world, perhaps comparable to the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign before his ascension. But none believe he could surpass the heavens and earth!"

"If he can remain in the mortal world, it proves he’s not a true immortal!"

"Seventeen years ago, the leader of my Feather Transformation Immortal Sect dragged him here, intending to perish together. That proves he isn’t invincible!"

"Though the creditor still lives, he must be severely injured. If we find him, the combined forces of all sects can surely kill him!"

After Yuan Zhengfeng’s words, silence returned.

After a moment, Ghost Valley Lingguan murmured, "Was the creditor seventeen years ago truly the creditor? If it was him, was he feigning weakness to hide in the shadows?"

Li Zhengjing’s heart stirred. He suddenly asked, "Why did the creditor force his way into the Netherworld?"

He looked at Ghost Valley Lingguan, then at Yuan Zhengfeng, whispering, "Perhaps he was as powerful as the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign three thousand years ago. One more step, and he would ascend. But after the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign ascended, he was buried in the mortal world. Did the creditor fear meeting the same fate?"

Ghost Valley Lingguan’s eyes lit up. "You mean he used Xuancha Ghost King to weaken himself?"

Li Zhengjing didn’t answer, because his own situation was similar.

The stronger he became, the closer he was to being harvested by Thousand Illusions Godlord!

That was why he had even suppressed his own cultivation progress before.

Was it the same for Thousand Illusions Godlord?

The threat looming over him was Thousand Illusions Godlord.

Then what threat loomed over Thousand Illusions Godlord? The ascension calamity that befell the Heavenly Azure Dao Sovereign?

"Wait... Did you just say 'Old Zhou'?"

As a madman, Xuji Zhenren focused on entirely different things. He erupted in fury, shouting, "This 'Old Zhou' you mentioned knows the creditor? So he’s one of us? Is he the founding Imperial Preceptor of the Great Zhou Dynasty?"

He pointed ahead, cursing, "Why can he enter, but I can’t? When I, Xuji Zhenren, made my name, he was already an old man—I could’ve crushed him with one hand! Why does he get to go in, but not me? I refuse to accept this!"

Seeing Xuancha Ghost King prepare to strike again, its aura surging like tidal waves, the small boat rocked violently!

Li Zhengjing, Ghost Valley Lingguan, and the wall-clinging bird paled in fear.

Only Yuan Zhengfeng, whose expression couldn’t be seen, appeared calm—though the fragmented jade trembled uncontrollably.

"If you’re so mighty, don’t resort to violence! Six arms don’t make you special!" Xuji Zhenren’s legs shook, but he stubbornly retorted, "Fight me with words if you dare! Can’t handle a debate?"

"He said we can’t handle a debate!" the right head remarked.

"He also said we don’t reason," the left head added.

"Reason? Are we afraid of that?" the central head snapped. "In life, I was a scholar of five chariots!"

"..." The wall-clinging bird peeked out, thinking, "I’m eight years old and already a scholar of five chariots. After living so long, he’s only at five? Clearly, I’m a prodigy!"

"Madman, your cultivation isn’t bad—no weaker than mine in life. But this is the realm of the dead. You’re not dead yet," the left head said.

"So if I die, I can enter?"

Xuji Zhenren’s eyes lit up, then he shook his head. "No, no! I want eternal life to enter! I don’t want to die—I just want in!"

"Die first, then enter," the central head replied.

"But I don’t want to die!" Xuji Zhenren protested.

"Then you can’t enter," the left head said.

"I want in!" Xuji Zhenren growled.

"Die first," the right head repeated.

"Are you deaf? I said I want in!" Xuji Zhenren bellowed. "Wait—you’re lying! If Old Zhou had to die to enter, where’s his corpse?"

"He didn’t die to enter," the right head admitted.

"I knew it! You’re lying!" Xuji Zhenren sneered.

"He became an immortal," the central head said.

"..."

Xuji Zhenren stood dumbfounded, his mind blank.

Li Zhengjing’s mouth went dry in an instant.

Yuan Zhengfeng was silent. Ghost Valley Lingguan fell into deep thought.

Only the wall-clinging bird couldn’t resist asking, "Wasn’t he here to die? How did he become an immortal? How did he do it? Can we do it too?"

"..."

Xuancha Ghost King fell silent. The three heads exchanged glances.

Finally, the right head spoke slowly: "When he arrived... he was already an immortal."
