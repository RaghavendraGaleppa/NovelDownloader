## Chapter 72: The Coming of Age Ceremony

Under the midday sun, the atmosphere outside the grand hall was solemn. Over a hundred martial artists stood on either side of the square, their eyes filled with a mix of nostalgia and hope as they gazed at the young boys standing before the massive bronze cauldron. They, too, had once been like these boys, until the elder personally performed the coming of age ceremony, and a respected guest tied a hat around their heads, marking their transition into adulthood.

Their mentor, Li Zhiming, and the usually taciturn Han Ke, stood before the four hundred young boys, exuding an aura of authority. A robust figure, larger than everyone else by a head, stood right behind Li Zhiming, sporting a foolish grin. The crowd was divided, with representatives from Hai Sha Bang and Qi Xuan Men seated on opposite sides, each occupying rows of Tai Shi chairs brought out from the grand hall.

On the Hai Sha Bang side, Su Zongguang and the Gold Light Monk sat side by side, accompanied by thirteen individuals of diverse appearances. There was the gaunt, dark-featured old man; the stout, obese man with short, coarse, and naturally red hair, and eyes that crackled with electricity. He casually handled a set of iron pellets that weighed fifty jin, doing so with the ease of handling a few peanuts.

On the Qi Xuan Men side, the seated elder figures were largely unfamiliar to Li Zhiming. There were approximately seventy elders in Qi Xuan Men, all highly respected and afforded the same courtesy as the sect leader. However, only thirty-six were present today, as the others were engaged in various important tasks or were away.

The ceremony was a grand occasion, not just for Li Zhiming's coming of age but also to showcase Qi Xuan Men's prestige in the presence of guests from Hai Sha Bang. 

The moment arrived when Meng Weizhi, dressed in ceremonial attire, stepped forward. With a gentle smile, he clapped his hands, signaling the start of the ceremony. A martial artist approached, bearing a new black hat made of cloth.

Li Zhiming stepped forward, bowed his head, and awaited the hat. Meng Weizhi took a deep breath, carefully placed the hat on Li Zhiming's head, and adjusted it to perfection. Then, he patted Li Zhiming's shoulder. Another attendants stepped forward with a black silk hat and a ceremonial hat.

The ceremony progressed with Meng Weizhi reciting passages from ancient texts. A respected elder took over, his deep voice booming across the mountain, reciting words of wisdom and blessings.

As the elder concluded, Su Zongguang from Hai Sha Bang stood up and led the applause. 

The ceremony marked not just a transition into adulthood for Li Zhiming but a celebration of his remarkable achievements, especially considering his rapid rise to prominence within Qi Xuan Men.

Among the boys, three individuals stood out, having shared a memorable experience with Li Zhiming in the past. They recalled the young boy who had shown exceptional character and leadership during a journey. It had been years since they last thought of him, but Li Zhiming's remarkable accomplishments had made him a celebrated figure.

The three former companions couldn't help but feel a mix of awe and admiration. They pondered how they could reconnect with Li Zhiming and rekindle their past camaraderie.

Throughout the ceremony, Li Zhiming remained respectful and attentive, listening intently to the elder's words. When it was his turn to respond, he bowed his head and spoke with sincerity.

The ceremony concluded, marking a significant milestone in Li Zhiming's life. The attendees dispersed, each carrying with them memories of a remarkable event that would be etched in their minds for a long time.
