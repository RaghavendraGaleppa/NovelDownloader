# Chapter 42: Zhuge Wan, This Disciple Is Not Right

Just by making an appearance before these high-ranking elders, Zhang Yan had already received gifts worth tens of thousands of spirit stones. The thrill of such quick gains left him somewhat uneasy.  

Too much, too much.  

They were giving him far too much!  

He was practically being stuffed full by these elders—his storage pouch was about to overflow!  

However, what disappointed Zhang Yan was that most of the gifts from these Golden Core elders were pills, talismans, and life-saving items. Although the sect master had given him a magical artifact, it was brand new—not a secondhand one. There were no special attributes for him to exploit, which left him feeling a bit regretful.  

If only he could have gotten his hands on some techniques or skills from these Golden Core elders, even just a trick or two would have benefited him greatly.  

"Since everyone has given you gifts, as your master, I can't be left out," Zhuge Wan said with a light laugh after watching Zhang Yan collect his presents. After a moment of thought, she continued, "Your Wood Element Technique is quite impressive and suits the path of spiritual plant cultivation well. So, instead of giving you something else, I'll gift you a set of spiritual planting tools."  

As she spoke, she took out a complete set of spiritual planting tools from her storage pouch.  

"This is a set of top-grade magical artifacts I used in the past. I hope you'll continue to work hard and go even further on the path of spiritual plant cultivation."  

When she said this, Zhuge Wan's expression was unusually solemn.  

"Junior Sister, you..."  

Seeing the set of artifacts Zhuge Wan had brought out, Mo Changqing's eyes widened. Although they were merely top-grade magical artifacts, this set represented Zhuge Wan's legacy. It was clear that she truly intended to treat Zhang Yan as a personal disciple.  

What puzzled Mo Changqing, however, was that this disciple seemed utterly ordinary. He had reviewed Zhang Yan's records—a mere lower-grade spiritual root—so why was his junior sister treating him with such favor? If he didn't know her so well, he might have suspected Zhang Yan was her illegitimate child.  

"Thank you, Master!"  

The set included a spiritual hoe, pruning shears, gloves, a shovel, a watering can, and more—everything one could need.  

Of course, the real reason Zhang Yan was so solemn was the special attributes attached to this set of equipment:  

**[Equipment Name]:** Spiritual Planting Set  
**[Equipment Quality]:** Purple  
**[Equipment Effects]:**  
- **Sharpness** (Attacks carry an additional cutting effect)  
- **Hardness Breaker** (Special effectiveness against tough objects)  
- **Mastery of Spiritual Planting** (At this moment, you are already a master of spiritual planting)  
- **Plant Atlas** (You have an encyclopedic knowledge of spiritual plants and can identify most of them)  
- **Isolation** (Your body can resist most toxins)  
- **Spiritual Fluid** (Your bodily fluids now possess spiritual properties)  

Looking at the dense list of attributes, Zhang Yan took a deep breath.  

It was too extravagant.  

Truly too extravagant.  

"To obtain so many attributes, I'd have to equip all these items, but I don't have enough equipment slots for that," Zhang Yan thought regretfully.  

But then it occurred to him—the most valuable part of these attributes was the knowledge of spiritual planting. He could learn that gradually.  

"Starting tomorrow, you will come to my cave abode for three hours each day. I will teach you the ways of spiritual planting."  

"Yes, Master."  

At this point, Zhang Yan understood—Zhuge Wan was genuinely treating him as a personal disciple.  

This was an opportunity, and he absolutely would not let her down.  

"Alright, you may go. Your fellow disciples must be growing impatient."  

Zhuge Wan waved him off.  

Zhang Yan tactfully took his leave, allowing the Golden Core elders to speak privately.  

As soon as he stepped out of the hall, he saw Mu Sen waiting for him, along with five others—three men and two women.  

"These are your senior brothers and sisters. This is Fifth Senior Brother," Mu Sen introduced, gesturing to a dark-skinned, wiry man who looked like a weathered farmer.  

"This is Seventh Senior Sister."  

"Eighth Senior Brother."  

Mu Sen went through the introductions.  

It was then that Zhang Yan learned that although he was Zhuge Wan's thirteenth disciple, there were actually only six senior brothers and sisters, including Mu Sen.  

Of the remaining seven, three had passed away due to old age, one had perished attempting to break through to Foundation Establishment, and three had disappeared during travels—likely meeting unfortunate fates.  

After exchanging greetings and receiving gifts from his seniors, Zhang Yan expressed his gratitude repeatedly.  

They exchanged jade token imprints for future communication.  

Finally, Zhang Yan made a brief appearance at the banquet, fulfilling everyone's curiosity about the new disciple of the Wood Spirit Peak's master.  

When they saw that Zhang Yan was merely an early-stage Qi Condensation cultivator, the crowd was stunned.  

It was exceedingly rare for a Golden Core elder to take on a Qi Condensation disciple.  

Because of this, Zhang Yan left an even deeper impression.  

After meeting the guests, Zhang Yan didn't linger. He mounted his Golden Bamboo Sword and returned to the outer sect.  

Now that he was an inner disciple, he needed to properly handle his outer sect spiritual fields, especially the medicinal herbs.  

Due to time constraints, some hadn't fully matured yet.  

However, Elder Bai had arranged for partial compensation, and with some hired spiritual farmers, there would be no losses.  

Before leaving, Zhang Yan decided to visit Elder Lin's spiritual garden.  

"Elder Lin."  

Nearly a year had passed, but Elder Lin looked unchanged.  

Zhang Yan was deeply grateful to him—the spiritual hoe he had borrowed had been a great help.  

"Zhang Yan? What brings you here?"  

Elder Lin was surprised. He knew Zhang Yan had connections with Foundation Establishment cultivators and hadn't expected him to visit.  

"I have quite a few mid-grade spiritual fields now, and I can't manage them all alone. I need trustworthy spiritual planters, so I was hoping you could help."  

Zhang Yan got straight to the point.  

"Mid-grade spiritual fields? How many?"  

At the mention of mid-grade fields, Elder Lin's face lit up with excitement—they were rare treasures.  

"Over two thousand acres."  

"Two thousand acres? Mid-grade? You—you're the new personal disciple of the Wood Spirit Peak's master?"  

"By my master's grace, I was fortunate enough to be accepted."  

Zhang Yan remained humble before Elder Lin.  

"Fortune doesn't strike so often in this world!" Elder Lin sighed deeply. This wasn't the first time Zhang Yan had called himself "fortunate," but each time, the shock was immense.  

A Golden Core elder's disciple!  

He had once mentored a Golden Core elder's disciple! The thought filled Elder Lin with pride.  

"Very well. Since you trust this old man, I'll gladly assist."  

With their agreement settled, Zhang Yan was satisfied.  

The next day, he arrived at his master's cave abode to begin his studies in spiritual planting.  

Yet, as soon as the lessons started, Zhuge Wan stared intently at Zhang Yan.  

She had a feeling—this disciple of hers was a little... unusual!!!
