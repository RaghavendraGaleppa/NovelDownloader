# Chapter 68: Body Assessment

Wang Mumu led Han Yue deeper into the dragon's head.

To their surprise, a hidden world unfolded before them!

Though they were in the dark belly of the dragon, after just a few steps, bright daylight suddenly appeared!

A blazing red sun hung above them, as if in midsummer!

Beneath the red sun stretched an endless forest of stone steles.

Wang Mumu walked leisurely ahead, acting as their guide.

The young woman continued her introduction:  
"Uncle-Master, this is the longevity paradise of the [Lineage Transmission] True Person, called the [Divine Firmament Stele Forest]. Our sect's Daoist scriptures are carved on these countless stone steles before us!"

"I love wandering through this [Divine Firmament Stele Forest] the most. It contains endless fascinating information. Unfortunately, the [Lineage Transmission] Patriarch worries I'll become addicted and neglect my cultivation, so he always limits my time here!"

As they walked and talked, a small pavilion appeared before them.

Inside the pavilion stood a reclining chair, a tea table, and several small round stools.

On the reclining chair lay a plump, white-haired old man with a youthful complexion, dressed in brocade robes.

The elder wore a single monocle with an earpiece and was engrossed in reading a book.

The monocle consisted of a small crystal lens framed in gold wire. The gold wire had developed a patina from long use, yet the lens remained crystal clear—the entire piece exuding an ancient aura.

So absorbed was the elder in his reading that he paid no attention to Han Yue and Wang Mumu's approach.

When he reached particularly enjoyable passages, the old man would shake his head and sway, utterly lost in the text.

This elder, who resembled a wealthy landlord, was one of the incarnations of [Lineage Transmission].

Wang Mumu, a frequent visitor here, was completely at ease.

She ran to the elder's side, steadied his reclining chair, and called out in a sweet voice:  
"Ancestor Grandpa, stop reading! We have business with you!"

The girl's voice was soft and pleasant to hear.

Only then did the elder put down his book and look up.

After glancing at the two before him, he said:  
"Little Mumu, your allotted time hasn't come yet. Go back and cultivate properly for a while longer before returning to read."

"Ancestor Grandpa, it's not for me—I'm accompanying Uncle-Master to receive his inheritance."

Hearing this, Han Yue quickly stepped forward.

[Lineage Transmission] examined Han Yue carefully before speaking:  
"So you're Tianyun's new disciple. Shangxi mentioned you! Yuanchu, was it? Quite rare to have a new disciple of the Yuan generation joining!"

"The last time a Yuan-generation disciple entered our sect was four hundred years ago!"

"Let me examine you carefully to determine which inheritance suits you best!"

The elder removed his monocle.

He wiped it with his right hand before replacing it.

He motioned for the two to sit on the round stools.

Then, peering through his monocle, he studied Han Yue intently.

Han Yue felt a peculiar surge of magical power sweep over him.

Divine Ability: [Heavenly Eye]!

A rather ordinary observation-type divine ability, yet perfected by Elder [Lineage Transmission] to miraculous levels!

This was the first trial for new disciples of the Divine Firmament Palace!

The "Body Assessment" conducted by the Longevity True Person [Lineage Transmission] was both an opportunity and a test for every Divine Firmament Palace disciple!

As he observed, [Lineage Transmission] took out a small notebook and began recording detailed notes.

While writing, he voiced his observations aloud for both to hear:

"Dharma Name: Yuanchu!"

"Hmm, not bad. Better sounding than Tianyun's own dharma name."

Han Yue had to agree.

"Age: Twenty-nine years!"

"Young indeed—only five years older than Mumu. You'll be the second youngest cultivator in our sect."

"If you can form a fourth-grade golden core before thirty, or a top-three-grade golden core before sixty, you may become a true disciple of our Divine Firmament Palace."

"Magical Power Source Quality: Fourth Tier!"

"Excellent! The primal qi you absorbed to enter the Body Stage is of superior quality!"

"Before reaching the fourth tier, you won't need to worry about refining your magical power's purity—half your cultivation bottlenecks are already resolved!"

"This deserves special note!"

"Since I took charge of the sect's inheritance, you're the one thousand seven hundred ninety-fourth disciple to enter the Body Stage with fourth-tier magical power!"

"Of your one thousand seven hundred ninety-three predecessors, one thousand five hundred thirty-two reached the third-tier Divine Realm."

"Twenty-one even achieved Longevity! Some even reached the fifth tier—truly remarkable odds!"

Wang Mumu couldn't help exclaiming enviously:  
"Wow! Uncle-Master is amazing!"

"I only entered the Body Stage with third-tier primal qi. When I reach the third tier, I'll still need to find ways to improve my magical power's quality—I'll never catch up to Uncle-Master's cultivation!"

[Lineage Transmission] responded:  
"Don't undervalue yourself, Mumu. Our Divine Firmament Palace records show that even second-tier magical power has produced Longevity cultivators."

"The path is walked by individuals. I still hope that someday, someone might reach the end with first-tier primal qi and blaze a trail for all living beings!"

"Moreover, counting only those who successfully entered the Body Stage isn't entirely fair—these numbers exclude the tremendous risks of absorbing higher-tier qi."

"Entering the Body Stage with fourth-tier magical power is a life-or-death gamble—only the most fortunate and talented survive."

"You see the high success ratio now, but countless others failed and perished, unrecorded in my statistics!"

"If we counted from before the Body Stage, the proportion of fourth-tier primal qi absorbers achieving Longevity would drop significantly!"

Both listeners nodded in understanding.

Han Yue recalled his own experience—a single sword strike that propelled him into the Body Stage—truly a stroke of immense fortune!

"Ancestor Grandpa, has anyone in our sect ever entered the Body Stage with fifth-tier primal qi?" Wang Mumu asked curiously.

"None that I know of!"

"Fifth-tier magical power has fundamentally different properties. Even if obtained by chance, it remains self-contained, unaffected by the human body, and cannot form usable magical power—thus unsuitable for Body Stage absorption."

"At the very least, I've never encountered such a case!"

"Even if someone somehow retained fifth-tier magical power within their body, its true wonders would only manifest near the Longevity stage!"

Han Yue realized this matched his own experience.

The magical power from [Thoughtless Slash] had many uses and greatly aided his cultivation.

Yet the higher-tier [Earth-Traversing Golden Light Technique]'s divine power, aside from enabling the technique itself, had no other applications.

As [Lineage Transmission] said, this was likely due to his insufficient cultivation level.

[Lineage Transmission] ceased his observations and turned to Wang Mumu:  
"Little Mumu, what comes next concerns your Uncle-Master's privacy. You shouldn't listen in—go find a stele to study in the forest, then return afterward."

"After your Uncle-Master's assessment, he'll proceed directly to receive his inheritance. He won't be emerging anytime soon!"

Obediently, Wang Mumu stood and dashed toward the vast stele forest behind the pavilion.

Getting to read even one stele counted as a significant gain for her!
