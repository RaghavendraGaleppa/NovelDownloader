# Chapter 144: The Golden Sun Crimson Crow Dao Intent

"Disappeared?"

Zhang Jing turned his head to look at his shoulder, his eyes slightly dazed. The unfinished words Long Shanshan had spoken earlier faintly echoed in his ears.

After a moment of silence, he looked directly at the translucent elderly figure before him and said calmly, "I wish to view records about the Profound Yellow Realm within the Dao Repository Secret Realm."

"You have partial permission to access information regarding the Profound Yellow Realm, my lord," the old man replied with a smile.

"Wait—how much destiny energy is required?" Zhang Jing's voice carried a rare hint of tension.

Before coming, Senior Brother Feng Wuyu had mentioned that the so-called "Profound Yellow Realm" referred to this very world he currently inhabited. Having transmigrated here for so long, Zhang Jing naturally yearned to understand more about the Profound Yellow Realm rather than remaining completely in the dark—provided the cost wasn't too high!

"My lord misunderstands. This is basic information that doesn't require destiny energy—only sufficient permissions," the old man explained.

Relief washed over Zhang Jing. Not requiring destiny energy was good news indeed. As for permissions—he didn't need to ask. It was obvious this privilege stemmed from his status as a nominal disciple of Yuanming Zhenjun. To elevate his permissions, he simply needed to become an official disciple—which sounded deceptively simple.

"Then let's begin viewing," Zhang Jing said slowly to the old man.

"My lord need only connect with the Dao Repository Secret Realm. Should you wish to use destiny energy to purchase various inheritance techniques, similarly communicate your request through mental connection. This concludes the newcomer guidance. I shall take my leave, but you may summon me anytime if needed."

With these words, the already translucent figure dissipated completely.

Another guide? Zhang Jing's eyes revealed a trace of surprise. "It seems the number of new disciples joining the sect far exceeds my imagination," he mused. Otherwise, there wouldn't be dedicated guides.

Following the old man's instructions, Zhang Jing attempted to connect with the Dao Repository Secret Realm. A small chaotic Dao mark appeared between his brows, and instantly, his surroundings transformed. Countless stars replaced the previous scenery, radiating varying intensities of light.

Zhang Jing's consciousness gradually linked with a vast presence, to which he conveyed his desire to view information about the Profound Yellow Realm. Suddenly, dozens of stars among the celestial multitude trembled before streaking toward him as streams of light.

Time passed imperceptibly. When the last star departed, Zhang Jing stretched lazily, his eyes reflecting deep contemplation. A trace of astonishment lingered on his face—he had finally gained some understanding of the Profound Yellow Realm.

Grand! Vast! Boundless! Infinite! These were his immediate impressions. The human race's seven supreme inheritance powers governed seven Heavenly Realms, including the Clear Void Profound Bright Heaven where he currently resided. The Supreme Unity Infinite Dao Sect ranked among the foremost of these powers.

Opposing the human race's seven Heavenly Realms stood the Myriad Races Alliance's eleven Heavenly Realms, whose collective strength slightly surpassed humanity's. However, internal strife among their countless races prevented unified action.

Beyond these existed the Primordial Chaos Profound Yellow Heaven in the uppermost layer of the Profound Yellow Realm, which remained neutral in conflicts between humans and the myriad races, along with various mysterious secret realms scattered throughout. The largest of these realms reportedly rivaled entire Heavenly Realms in size.

The combined scale of these realms made the Profound Yellow Realm terrifyingly immense. In comparison, the Nine Domains of the lower world Zhang Jing once considered vast now seemed insignificant. "No wonder Senior Brother Feng Wuyu said the Dao Sect recruits far more disciples from the Heavenly Realms than the lower world," Zhang Jing sighed, his expression complex. He truly was a country bumpkin by comparison.

However—Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed with sudden realization. If he recalled correctly, before humanity's foundational war against the myriad races—a conflict spanning multiple epochs—the Profound Yellow Realm hadn't been this expansive. Back then, only the Nine Domains and nine layers of void existed. The current Heavenly Realms and countless secret realms had emerged after that cataclysmic war.

What monumental changes had occurred? Zhang Jing couldn't help but wonder, though he soon chuckled and shook his head. "I'll learn these things when my cultivation advances. For now, it's just idle curiosity."

Setting aside these thoughts, Zhang Jing recalled his original purpose and connected with the Dao Repository to examine Dao Intent inheritances. Instantly, tens of thousands of stars cascaded from above, forming a veritable ocean of celestial bodies.

So many Dao Intents? Zhang Jing's expression froze momentarily. As his gaze swept across the starry expanse containing these inheritances, he gradually understood. Beyond the 365 foundational Dao Intents, the remainder represented creations—or more accurately, experimental concoctions—of other Dao Sect disciples.

The variety astounded him. One particularly bizarre example was the Nirvana Earth Dragon Dao Intent, which forcibly combined phoenix nirvana concepts with earth dragon regeneration principles, along with assorted life-recovery and rapid-growth elements. While granting near-immortality, practitioners would suffer uncontrolled, chaotic flesh proliferation—a nightmarish side effect.

Even with knowledge spanning two worlds, Zhang Jing marveled at such wildly inventive thinking. This vast collection represented a treasure trove of materials for his future Dao Intent fusion and upgrades.

After careful consideration, Zhang Jing's attention settled on one particularly radiant star among the foundational Dao Intents: [Golden Sun Crimson Crow Dao Intent - 700,000 Destiny Energy]

"Since I already possess the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent, I might as well choose a solar attribute next," Zhang Jing mused. "It would be interesting to observe the interaction between these opposing yin and yang principles."

With this thought, he promptly purchased the Golden Sun Crimson Crow Dao Intent.
