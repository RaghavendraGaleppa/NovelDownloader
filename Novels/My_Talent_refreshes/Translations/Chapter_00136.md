# Chapter 136: Refreshing the Noon Fire Spirit Body, Hidden Divine Ability Talents

In the cultivation chamber, Chu Ning sat cross-legged.

He glanced at the proficiency levels of his various cultivation arts.

[Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art (Yellow-rank Low-grade), Third Layer (2095/2100)]
[Nine Transformations Body Refinement Art, First Volume, Unbroken Tendons (868/1500)]
[Divine Soul Refining Art, Second Layer (83/2000)]

Over fifty days, with a full stack of resources, Chu Ning's proficiency grew at a rate of nearly 7 points per day.

The proficiency of his Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art had increased by a full 350 points.

However, in return, he had severely compressed the time spent on body and soul refinement.

He only consumed a Golden Orchid Fruit for body refinement every two days, and practiced the Divine Soul Refining Art once every two days, both merely as adjustments to his Qi Condensation.

Naturally, the proficiency of these two arts increased very slowly.

And now, his Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art's third layer proficiency had reached 2095.

Completing the entire nine layers of Qi Condensation within two months felt a bit too fast even to Chu Ning himself.

His realm was not very stable.

However, he had no intention of stopping now. He planned to first max out the proficiency of the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art's third layer. After refreshing his Spirit Body, he would then take his time before breaking through to the Perfected Qi Condensation realm, using that time to stabilize his foundation.

At this moment, all he needed to do was complete the remaining 5 points of proficiency.

Reaching into his storage bag, Chu Ning took out a mid-grade spirit stone and closed his eyes, beginning his cultivation.

He had already experimented before; after entering the ninth layer of Qi Condensation, one mid-grade spirit stone could support an increase of 6 proficiency points.

That was enough.

Holding the mid-grade spirit stone, Chu Ning circulated the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art. The spiritual energy from the spirit stone in his hand was immediately drawn into his body. At the same time, the ambient spiritual energy in the heavens and earth rapidly converged towards Chu Ning.

This cultivation session lasted for an entire day!

A day later.

"Crack!"

The mid-grade spirit stone in Chu Ning's hand suddenly shattered, turning into powder.

At the same time, Chu Ning's eyes snapped open.

Without any hesitation, his attention focused on the proficiency display in his mind.

[Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art (Yellow-rank Low-grade), Third Layer (2100/2100)]

"The third layer of the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art is finally perfected. As for the talent..."

Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately looked downwards.

[Wood generates Fire. Detecting host possesses Fire Spiritual Root.]
[Talent refreshed. Awarded talent "Noon Fire Spirit Body":
1. Greatly increases sensitivity to fire-attribute spiritual energy, boosting the cultivation speed of fire-attribute cultivation methods and spells; can stack with the寅 Wood Spirit Body, equally effective for cultivating wood-fire dual-attribute cultivation methods and spells.
2. When using fire-attribute offensive spells, spell attack power is doubled.
Hidden Divine Ability Talent available for viewing:
Cultivating wood-fire dual-attribute methods has a 50% chance of awakening a mutated Wind Spiritual Root.]

Looking at this long string of descriptions, Chu Ning was both surprised and delighted.

His prediction was correct; cultivating the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art to perfection indeed refreshed a Spirit Body talent related to cultivation, just as he had expected.

"Noon Fire Spirit Body!"

Chu Ning silently recited these four words, his mind now clear on the direction of his future cultivation.

Wood-attribute cultivation methods and fire-attribute cultivation methods were undoubtedly excellent, but with both the寅 Wood Spirit Body and the Noon Fire Spirit Body, the most suitable choice was undoubtedly a wood-fire dual-attribute cultivation method.

After all, he could utilize his cultivation techniques like the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art without wasting them, and the Noon Fire Spirit Body's second innate divine ability, "When using fire-attribute offensive spells, spell attack power is doubled," was incredibly potent and naturally needed to be fully utilized.

Moreover, Chu Ning could be almost certain that such a cultivation method existed within the sect. Because when he was in the Spirit Domain, the Shang Rui he encountered had cultivated such a method.

At this moment, Chu Ning continued to ponder the next line.

[Hidden Divine Ability Talent available for viewing: Cultivating wood-fire dual-attribute methods has a 50% chance of awakening a mutated Wind Spiritual Root.]

He roughly understood the meaning of the latter part: if he chose a wood-fire dual-attribute cultivation method, there was a certain probability of awakening a mutated Wind Spiritual Root. This rare spiritual root itself was related to wood and fire, and if he could truly awaken it, it would undoubtedly greatly enhance his talent.

But what about the first part?

"Hidden Divine Ability Talent available for viewing... this implies that normally, this function is hidden, but now I can see it. It seems unnecessary to add this phrase."

Chu Ning pondered for a moment, then quickly realized something.

"No, thinking this way, does it mean that the previous Spirit Body refreshes also had these hidden functions, but I just couldn't see them?"

With this thought, Chu Ning refocused his attention on the proficiency display panel in his mind.

His gaze began to scroll down, browsing the descriptions of the寅 Wood Spirit Body, the Talisman Source Spirit Body, and the True Talisman Spirit Body.

In fact, the descriptions of these spirit bodies had always been there, even including those for the Heavenly Gang Fist and Thunderclap Step. Chu Ning had not ignored them before; occasionally, when checking his proficiency, he would also look at the content below.

However, he had never seen any mention of hidden talents.

But now, when Chu Ning checked again, he was stunned.

"Does every Spirit Body talent really have a hidden divine ability talent?"

Chu Ning was startled, because at this moment, an additional point had appeared in the descriptions of several Spirit Bodies.

[寅 Wood Spirit Body: 1. Greatly increases sensitivity to wood-attribute spiritual energy, boosting the cultivation speed of wood-attribute cultivation methods and spells;
2. Wood-attribute spiritual power cultivated can mask detection, allowing one to reveal the strength of their spiritual power at will.
Hidden Divine Ability Talent: When wood-attribute spells are used on spirit plants to gather spiritual energy, the user can convert and absorb it themselves.]

"No wonder I could cultivate by relying on the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art! It truly was due to the寅 Wood Spirit Body's hidden divine ability talent."

At this moment, a look of realization dawned on Chu Ning's face. He had guessed this before; otherwise, why could only he accelerate his cultivation speed when so many others used the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art? Now, he finally had the answer.

"What about the Talisman Source Spirit Body and the True Talisman Spirit Body?"

Chu Ning suddenly thought of this and immediately checked them. He had never noticed any other hidden divine ability talents when using these two spirit bodies.

[Talisman Source Spirit Body: 1. Greatly enhances comprehension and cultivation talent for Talisman Arts;
2. Increases success rate and quality of talisman crafting.
Hidden Divine Ability Talent: Can analyze and comprehend the fundamental patterns of talismans (only able to analyze and comprehend talisman patterns one rank higher than the highest rank of talismans one can craft). After analysis, one can master the art of crafting that talisman.]

Seeing the description of this hidden divine ability talent, Chu Ning couldn't help but widen his mouth slightly. He naturally understood this description, and it was precisely because of this that he felt somewhat surprised.

According to this divine ability talent's description, if he could craft high-grade elementary talismans, he could then analyze the patterns of low-grade intermediate talismans. And once he analyzed and comprehended them, he could directly master the art of crafting them.

"If this is the case, then I won't have to worry about not having corresponding Talisman Arts to learn in the future. For example, I could buy a low-grade intermediate talisman, then analyze its patterns, and master the art of crafting it. I could even comprehend the secret talisman arts of other sects and forces."

Chu Ning wasn't sure if his thought was wrong, but if it truly was like this, then this hidden divine ability talent was terrifyingly powerful. It was no wonder he hadn't discovered it; he had simply never thought in that direction. He had bought low-grade intermediate talismans and used them directly, never considering studying them.

"No wonder it's called the Talisman Source Spirit Body. So that's how it is."

Chu Ning felt a surge of emotion in his heart, then quickly scrolled down. He still had the True Talisman Spirit Body to check.

[True Talisman Spirit Body: 1. Spell True Talisman: Can convert instantaneous spells into Spell True Talismans for crafting talismans (requires corresponding attribute Spirit Body).
2. True Talisman Spell: Can convert self-drawn talismans into True Talisman Spells and store them in a talisman ring for instantaneous casting (limited number of talismans).
Hidden Divine Ability Talent: After using a True Talisman Spell one hundred times, a Talisman Seed can be condensed, allowing the spell to be cast without relying on a talisman ring. Only one True Talisman Spell of the same attribute can be chosen to condense a Talisman Seed.]

"Talisman Seed." Chu Ning silently recited these two words and quickly understood their meaning.

Before this, for example, when he turned a Fiery Blaze Talisman into a True Talisman Spell, it had to be cast through a talisman ring. Each use was essentially like integrating a talisman into the talisman ring, its only purpose being speed. But if a Talisman Seed was condensed, he could cast the spell without the aid of a talisman or talisman ring. It meant he would directly master the Fiery Blaze Talisman spell himself.

"So that's it!"

After using it a few times, Chu Ning had vaguely felt that the True Talisman Spell of the True Talisman Spirit Body was just that. Although it was a bit faster than activating a talisman, its effect wasn't very significant. But now, coupled with the hidden divine ability talent, it was different.

Rapidly digesting this information in his mind, Chu Ning quickly looked at the Heavenly Gang Fist, Thunderclap Step, and Divine Restriction Art. However, he found that these three divine ability talents did not have any hidden content.

"It seems these hidden divine ability talents are only for the Spirit Bodies refreshed by Qi Condensation."

Chu Ning quickly made a judgment, but even so, it was enough to make him overjoyed. The harvest from perfecting the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art this time was simply immense.

Not only did he refresh the Noon Fire Spirit Body, but the revelation of these hidden divine ability talents also granted Chu Ning more skills.

However, at this moment, Chu Ning temporarily put all of this to the back of his mind.

Since the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art was perfected, and his next cultivation direction was clear, the most pressing matter was naturally to quickly choose a cultivation method. Then, following his previous plan, he would find a suitable opportunity to leave this place.

Thinking this, Chu Ning could no longer restrain himself. He immediately got up, left his cave mansion, and headed straight for the Scripture Depository.

Chu Ning had been to the Scripture Depository several times before, so he was familiar with the way. Upon entering the pavilion, Chu Ning found a middle-aged man with a long beard, who was currently engrossed in a book.

"Martial Uncle Zhao!"

The middle-aged man looked up at Chu Ning, his expression calm. "Oh, it's Martial Nephew Chu. All the books on the first floor are available for you to read. Just go right in."

"Martial Uncle Zhao, this disciple has come to look at cultivation methods."

"Cultivation methods? What kind?" Hearing Chu Ning's words, Deacon Zhao put down his book.

Chu Ning replied directly, "This disciple previously cultivated the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art, but its rank is too low. I wish to find higher-grade cultivation methods. I'm interested in wood-attribute, or perhaps wood-earth, wood-fire, or wood-water attribute methods."

Hearing Chu Ning's words, Deacon Zhao frowned slightly, seemingly wanting to say something. Then he nodded and said, "Now that you've entered the inner sect, the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art is indeed a bit low-grade. However, when disciples cultivate or change cultivation methods, it's usually best to follow their master's advice. You can go and look, but since you are already a registered disciple of the Sect Master, you should still consult the Sect Master regarding which method to cultivate."

Chu Ning's heart sank upon hearing this. If he could only look at descriptions, that wouldn't be enough for him. What he wanted was to take the cultivation method out, or at the very least, completely memorize it.

Just as Chu Ning was about to speak, Deacon Zhao spoke again. "Of course, the sect previously instructed that you disciples should be supported as much as possible in your cultivation needs. How about this: give me your jade token, and I'll grant you permission. You may select three cultivation methods from within the pavilion for detailed study. As for which method you ultimately choose to cultivate, that will depend on your own decision and the Sect Master's."

Hearing this, Chu Ning, who had been about to say something, was instantly overjoyed.

He didn't hide his excitement, quickly taking out his jade token and handing it to Deacon Zhao. The Deacon formed a few hand seals on Chu Ning's jade token, then handed it back.

"The cultivation methods are on the third floor of the Scripture Depository. You can go straight up. Remember to think carefully before taking any methods; once you've taken three, you cannot take any more."

Hearing Deacon Zhao's words, Chu Ning immediately clasped his hands in thanks, then headed straight for the third floor.

Upon reaching the third floor, Chu Ning first saw rows of neatly arranged bookshelves. Each row was independently sectioned off and protected by a barrier. Different ranks and attributes of cultivation methods were categorized and displayed.

However, the highest rank among them was only Profound-rank High-grade cultivation methods; there were no Earth-rank methods visible.

"Does the sect not possess Earth-rank methods, or are methods of that rank simply not accessible to disciples like us?" Chu Ning's mind briefly flashed with this thought, then he quickly dismissed it. For him, whether it was an Earth-rank method wasn't that important. He had the 寅 Wood Spirit Body and the Noon Fire Spirit Body, so finding a suitable method was more crucial.

Although Chu Ning was most eager for a wood-fire dual-attribute cultivation method, he didn't rush forward at this moment. Instead, he first went to the shelf of Profound-rank High-grade wood-attribute cultivation methods. After all, he wasn't sure if his current actions were being monitored by Deacon Zhao. Logically, going to look at wood-attribute methods was the most normal course of action.

Moreover, Chu Ning did have a plan: if he couldn't find a fire-wood dual-attribute method, then a wood-attribute method would naturally be one of his backups. And for the rank, it was naturally more reasonable to start looking from Profound-rank High-grade.

However, when Chu Ning arrived at this shelf, he found that there was only one Profound-rank High-grade wood-attribute method: the Profound Verdant Art. He briefly scanned it but didn't rush to take it down. He then went to look at the Profound-rank Mid-grade wood-attribute methods, and subsequently, walked towards the shelves of fire-attribute cultivation methods.

He still started by looking at the Profound-rank High-grade methods. Here, there was still only one Profound-rank High-grade fire-attribute method: the Red Lotus True Fire Art. As for the Profound-rank Mid-grade fire-attribute methods, there were several, such as the Blazing Sun Art and the Nine Suns Art.

It was only then that Chu Ning, with some anticipation, walked towards the dual-attribute cultivation method area. At this point, Chu Ning discovered that all these dual-attribute cultivation methods were Profound-rank High-grade.

He quickly scanned the other dual-attribute methods for general understanding, then swiftly walked to the shelf of wood-fire dual-attribute methods.

"There really is one!"

When he saw a jade slip placed on the Profound-rank High-grade wood-fire dual-attribute method shelf, Chu Ning's eyes instantly gleamed.

The Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art, a Profound-rank High-grade cultivation method, wood-fire dual-attribute, with a total of four layers. Unlike the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art, where layers one to three corresponded to the early, mid, and late stages of Qi Condensation, the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art was a method that could be cultivated continuously, even suitable for Core Formation stage cultivation. The layers different people cultivated could vary; some with outstanding talent might complete all four layers during Foundation Establishment, while others might only do so during Core Formation.

Chu Ning specifically checked, and upon confirming that even Qi Condensation disciples could cultivate the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art, he immediately made his decision.

Picking up his jade token, Chu Ning separately took out the jade slips for the Profound Verdant Art, Red Lotus True Fire Art, and Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art. Then, he walked downstairs and found Deacon Zhao again.

"You have quite high aspirations, choosing all Profound-rank High-grade methods." Deacon Zhao glanced at Chu Ning. "However, the cultivation of these methods also depends on one's aptitude. If your aptitude isn't sufficient, cultivating higher-grade methods might actually be slower. This is because higher-grade methods require deeper spiritual power for breakthroughs. You should know this, correct?"

"This disciple understands," Chu Ning replied.

Deacon Zhao nodded, then took out a jade slip for registration. Subsequently, he handed all three jade slips back to Chu Ning.

"Take them. These cultivation method jade slips are merely copies. Go back, carefully understand the cultivation methods, decide which one you'll choose, and then return the other two." Speaking of this, Deacon Zhao specifically added, "The time limit is ten days. These jade slips have restrictions placed on them; currently, you can only view the first layer of the methods. If they are not returned within ten days, the content within the jade slips will automatically disappear, and none of the methods will be cultivable."

Chu Ning's heart sank slightly upon hearing this. After taking the jade slips and confirming his understanding, he left the Scripture Depository.

He had originally planned to run away with the cultivation methods in the next couple of days, but it seemed this plan wouldn't work now. Clearly, the sect wouldn't allow disciples to memorize several Profound-rank High-grade methods.

Currently, he could only view a small portion of the methods' content. It seemed it would be better to return the other two jade slips in a few days and let Deacon Zhao remove the restrictions on the jade slips.

In truth, his best approach would have been to directly request the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art, but since he had already taken three, it would seem too abrupt. Chu Ning was preparing to leave soon and naturally didn't want anything unusual that might draw attention.

Chu Ning immediately rushed towards Xin Wuya's cave mansion.

To play the part fully, it was normal for him to consult his nominal sect master and master after choosing a cultivation method. Who knew if the other party would obtain relevant information from the Scripture Depository? Not reporting such a significant matter as changing cultivation methods would be too abnormal.

"The Sect Master is currently in seclusion and not in his cave mansion."

Just as Chu Ning arrived outside Xin Wuya's cave mansion, he was stopped by Xin Wuya's official disciple, a Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator named He Litao. Chu Ning had met him a few times and knew that this person seemed to be in charge of daily affairs inside and outside Xin Wuya's cave mansion.

"Martial Uncle He, when will the Sect Master likely be in his cave mansion?"

He Litao glanced at Chu Ning indifferently, saying rather coldly, "How would I know the Sect Master's affairs?"

Feeling He Litao's obvious dislike, Chu Ning didn't mind and immediately clasped his hands and departed. In fact, from He Litao's attitude, Chu Ning also gained some insight into Xin Wuya's true intentions for accepting him as a disciple. If the Sect Master truly valued him, then under circumstances with no immediate conflicting interests, a Foundation Establishment disciple under him shouldn't treat him with such an attitude, let alone offer guidance.

However, for Chu Ning, he was quite pleased with this. Xin Wuya's absence was a good thing; otherwise, if the other party insisted he cultivate the Profound Verdant Art, he would probably have to spend some effort explaining himself. Now, it was good; he could just decide to cultivate this method directly.

Leaving Xin Wuya's cave mansion, Chu Ning returned to his own cave mansion. He then casually looked at the northeast side behind his cave mansion.

"According to Little White, that area is close to the edge of the sect-protecting formation. And when no one was around before, I specifically had Little White tunnel out from there. That location is already near the very edge of the Green Gorge Mountain Range. Based on what I've learned about the situation on the Eastern Sage Continent where the Green Gorge Mountain Range is located, further east are some mortal cities with sparse spiritual energy and very few cultivators. If it's for cultivation, it's naturally unsuitable, but it's very suitable for hiding one's tracks."

Chu Ning's eyes flickered slightly.

Then, he directly entered his cave mansion.

He went straight to the cultivation chamber and casually took out the three cultivation method jade slips. Instead of immediately looking at the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art, Chu Ning first read the Profound Verdant Art and the Red Lotus True Fire Art.

After a while, Chu Ning successively put down the two jade slips.

"If I hadn't awakened this Noon Fire Spirit Body, this Profound Verdant Art would be very suitable for me, as it's directly related to the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art. It even records a spell called the Profound Verdant Spring Bloom Art, a higher-grade version of the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art, which can be cast after cultivating this Profound Verdant Art. For others, it might not be much, but I have the寅 Wood Spirit Body's hidden divine ability talent. If I could use a higher-grade version of the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art, it would naturally be of great benefit to my cultivation."

Chu Ning secretly felt a bit of pity. In contrast, while the Red Lotus True Fire Art also recorded several good spells, he paid less attention to them.

"Eh, I have the寅 Wood Spirit Body, can I directly cultivate this Profound Verdant Spring Bloom Art?"

At this moment, Chu Ning suddenly thought of this question. Taking out the jade slip again, Chu Ning found that the Profound Verdant Spring Bloom Art was actually recorded right after the first layer. He was overjoyed and immediately memorized it. As for the few spells within the Red Lotus True Fire Art, they were in later layers, which Chu Ning couldn't access.

Chu Ning didn't try the Profound Verdant Spring Bloom Art at this moment; he had plenty of time later. He picked up the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art and read it carefully. After finishing the first layer, his eyes lit up slightly.

Besides the cultivation method for breaking through from the ninth layer of Qi Condensation to the Perfected Realm, the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art also included cultivation techniques for earlier stages, and even mentioned how to transition from fire-attribute and wood-attribute cultivation methods.

"According to the description here, I need to first transform the wood-attribute spiritual power from the Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art within my body into the wood-fire dual-attribute spiritual power of this Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art. And it just so happens that my realm feels unstable due to recent rapid cultivation. Using this method to stabilize my realm would kill two birds with one stone."

Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately began cultivating according to the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art.
