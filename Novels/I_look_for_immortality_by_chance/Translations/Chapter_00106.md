# Chapter 106: The Threefold Dharma Celestial Diagram (Combined)

"Even larger in scale?"

"Could you elaborate, Junior Sister?"

Gu Yuan frowned slightly before pressing for details.

His knowledge of the Flowing Cloud Banquet came solely from the Scripture Pavilion. Since the banquet was held only once every hundred years, he had merely skimmed through the records without delving deeply, only grasping the general idea.

Now that he had obtained the Three-Hearts Golden Seal and his comprehension had greatly improved, he was confident in deciphering Foundation Establishment techniques. Once he mastered them, the only remaining step would be finding "Heaven and Earth Qi."

Originally, he planned to search for the qi himself. But with the Flowing Cloud Banquet approaching, it meant various types of qi would be bestowed, sparing him the arduous search.

Once he obtained the qi, Foundation Establishment would be within reach!

This matter was of utmost importance, and he needed to understand it thoroughly to seize the opportunity.

Hearing this, Bian Chuyao smiled and explained, "Senior Brother, you may not know, but in the past, the Flowing Cloud Banquet gathered cultivators at the ninth level of Qi Refinement who had comprehended Foundation Establishment techniques to attend a banquet at Ancient Peak. Based on their strength and innate talent, they would compete for the ten strands of 'Heaven and Earth Qi' bestowed by the sect."

"Only these ten strands were available. Those who obtained them could establish their foundation, while those who failed had to search for qi on their own."

"But this time is different. The sect will bestow thirty strands of Heaven and Earth Qi at once!"

"Thirty strands?!" 

Gu Yuan was shocked and couldn't help but marvel at the sect's generosity.

But then, a question arose in his mind: "Is the sect planning to have all disciples establish their foundations together to strengthen its foundation?"

With the impending campaign, was the sect resorting to flooding the ranks with disciples?

"Indeed, it's to allow more Qi Refinement disciples to establish their foundations and enhance the sect's strength. But it's not as simple as it seems. Have you heard of the competition for the Ten Great True Inheritances?"

Bian Chuyao countered with another question.

Gu Yuan nodded.

The Ten Great True Inheritances had long been a hot topic. After all, obtaining a True Inheritance position meant acquiring a third-tier spirit island—an immense resource!

"This matter is related to the True Inheritance positions."

"To compete for a True Inheritance position, the first requirement is to establish one's foundation. Additionally, there's an age limit—candidates must be under a hundred years old. Those over a hundred can't compete unless they've performed extraordinary feats to prove their potential."

"As long as these two conditions are met, anyone in the sect can compete for a True Inheritance position."

"But Senior Brother, you must understand that our Azure Peak Dao Academy is no ordinary small sect. Currently, there are many Foundation Establishment cultivators under a hundred years old in the sect, some of whom have been established for decades, with deep accumulations and entrenched influence."

"And the True Inheritance competition will begin within ten years at most."

"Newly established Foundation cultivators in these ten years will find it difficult to compete with the older ones. This is somewhat unfair."

"To address this, the sect has specially arranged this Flowing Cloud Banquet."

"Although thirty strands of qi will be bestowed this time, only ten people can compete for them."

"At Ancient Peak, there will be a grand competition to determine these ten individuals. Based on their techniques, each will be bestowed a strand of qi and a token to enter the Ancient Peak Secret Realm."

"The remaining twenty strands of qi are stored in the secret realm."

"These twenty strands are up for grabs—those with formidable strength can take three or even five strands, while weaker ones might not obtain even one."

At this point, Bian Chuyao's eyes gleamed with anticipation as she looked at Gu Yuan.

Gu Yuan frowned slightly, puzzled. "Establishing a foundation only requires one strand of qi. What's the point of competing for extra strands? To sell them for resources?"

But as he spoke, he suddenly realized.

"Followers?"

Bian Chuyao smiled and nodded.

"The Ten Great True Inheritances bear the responsibility of campaigning across the land, leading sect disciples to slay demons and seize spiritual veins to expand the sect's territory."

"Such individuals can't rely solely on their own strength—they must have their own followers."

"Each True Inheritance represents a faction within the sect!"

"And the Flowing Cloud Banquet is a form of compensation for newly established Foundation disciples. Those with formidable means can use the 'Heaven and Earth Qi' to quickly build their own forces."

Here, Bian Chuyao tilted her head and softly pleaded with Gu Yuan, "Senior Brother, since you defeated Senior Brother Deng, even ordinary disciples under Golden Core masters are no match for you. If you can enter the Ancient Peak Secret Realm, we can continue working together!"

"My Bian Clan will never let you down!"

Gu Yuan pondered for a moment without giving an immediate answer.

He hadn't expected the Flowing Cloud Banquet to be so intricately tied to the True Inheritance competition.

But upon reflection, it made sense. The True Inheritance bestowed third-tier spirit islands—resources that could benefit not just one True Inheritance disciple but many others.

The sect's goal was to establish ten new factions, fostering competition to drive the entire sect forward.

The most outstanding among them would likely become the sect's future leaders.

No wonder the True Inheritance positions were so coveted.

Resources, power, status—they offered everything, akin to a battle for succession.

And now, everyone's goal was to become one of the "ten princes."

"Let's discuss collaboration later. For now, let's return to the sect."

After some thought, Gu Yuan gave this response before closing his eyes to meditate, saying no more.

Seeing this, Bian Chuyao gritted her teeth, feeling somewhat indignant.

This guy must think I'm not strong enough!

---

After this exchange, the two fell silent. After several days of quiet travel, they safely returned to the sect.

The treasure boat landed on Golden Origin Island. As Gu Yuan was about to leave, Bian Chuyao couldn't resist calling out:

"Senior Brother, once I consume the Golden Fruit, I'll surely make you see me in a new light!"

She still hadn't given up on collaborating with Gu Yuan.

"I believe in you, Junior Sister!"

Gu Yuan smiled faintly but still didn't give a definitive answer. Instead, he mounted his flying shuttle and swiftly returned to Dry Origin Cave.

"Little Miss, don't mind him. Once we consume the Golden Fruit and secure our spots, we'll show him what we're made of!"

"That's right! How dare he look down on you!"

"Even if he's strong, it's only at the Qi Refinement stage. After Foundation Establishment, with our techniques and divine sense water, we won't lose to him!"

"Exactly! He only cultivates the Seed of Heaven and Earth Evergreen Diagram—nothing to fear!"

The little spirits grumbled on Bian Chuyao's behalf.

"Enough."

Bian Chuyao chided them before casting a deep glance at Gu Yuan's retreating figure and steering the treasure boat back to Profound Mystery Island.

---

Dry Origin Cave.

Gu Yuan gazed at the dazzling array patterns on the cave walls and finally relaxed.

"At last, I can see what this silver-and-golden opportunity is all about..."

Back at Cloud Mist Valley, after retrieving the silver beast-skin book, Gu Yuan had intended to dive back into the fire pool to search the middle-aged cultivator's python robe and preserved body.

But before he could descend, the entire pool erupted violently, as if something suppressing it had vanished. The magma surged wildly, threatening to burst forth and boil over.

Gu Yuan barely had time to react before his hair was singed, leaving him in a sorry state.

Seeing this, he dared not venture further. After hastily "tidying up" with the magma's help, he activated his Azure Jade Token and left the valley, returning to Bian Chuyao's treasure boat.

On the boat, he refrained from examining the silver beast-skin book, biding his time.

Now, back in Dry Origin Cave, he could finally inspect it at ease.

"This is an opportunity tinged with golden light—I hope it doesn't disappoint..."

Gu Yuan sat cross-legged beneath the Giant Divine Wood, placing the silver beast-skin book on his lap and carefully perusing it.

---

The silver beast-skin, made from an unknown spirit beast, felt cool and smooth to the touch.

Moreover, as Gu Yuan touched it, the silver dragon spiritual sense in his sea of consciousness seemed to sense something, becoming restless and excited.

"Buzz!"

Suppressing the agitation of his spiritual sense, Gu Yuan tried to read the tiny characters on the beast-skin but found them obscured by a faint film, blurring everything like viewing through fog.

He activated his Heavenly Insight but found nothing.

Infusing it with spiritual energy was like throwing mud into the sea.

"Is this some special restriction?"

Gu Yuan frowned slightly.

Just then, the silver dragon spiritual sense in his sea of consciousness grew increasingly restless, as if eager to emerge, almost beyond his control.

Spiritual sense, being the power condensed from thought and soul, was inseparable from Gu Yuan and would never harm him.

"Could it be..."

Gu Yuan had an idea and stopped suppressing the agitation.

"Roar!"

Instantly, the silver dragon surged forth, landing on the beast-skin.

"Whoosh!"

The silver dragon seemed ecstatic, opening its maw to eagerly suck at the beast-skin.

"Swish—"

The film on the beast-skin was drawn into the dragon's belly like water.

"Gulp, gulp!"

The silver dragon continued to devour, its body gradually expanding until it had nearly doubled in size, comparable to its state when amplified by the Giant Divine Seal.

Meanwhile, the strange "film" on the beast-skin faded, revealing golden characters.

These seemed like words yet also carried intent.

With just a glance, Gu Yuan heard a voice speaking unhurriedly in his ear:

"I never understood why the monarch was so easily swayed by the dragonkin... until I saw the Golden Dragon Scale Scripture. Then it became clear..."

"A true dragon's bestowed technique—what a grand opportunity! But how could our Zhongshan Kingdom, so insignificant, bear such a gift?"

"Alas... having received the kingdom's grace, how could I betray it? Never mind—it's just a life, after all!"

"Still, since it's a grand opportunity, it can't be easily destroyed. The Golden Dragon Scale Scripture can't be hidden, but this Silver Dragon Heavenly Scripture can still be passed down..."

"Future generations who obtain the Four Spirit Jade Pillars and cultivate the Silver Dragon Spiritual Sense may claim this heavenly scripture after the great upheaval."

"This technique is profound and miraculous. With it, one can establish a foundation far surpassing peers, perhaps even restoring the glory of Zhongshan Kingdom and the Heavenly Secrets Pavilion..."

The voice grew distant here, as if speaking from the heavens, yet each word struck Gu Yuan's heart like a sword.

"Threefold Dharma Celestial Diagram!"

"This technique allows one to absorb three strands of Heaven and Earth Qi, establishing three foundations—a peerless marvel."

"Once mastered, spiritual energy triples, vast as an endless ocean. It enables the use of three Foundation Establishment techniques, dominating one's peers. However, each breakthrough requires three times the usual energy..."

"The Daoist Celestial Body, commanding water and devouring swords..."

Mystical words, resonant as metal striking metal, echoed in Gu Yuan's ears.

Simultaneously, two dazzling diagrammatic illusions appeared in his mind.

One depicted a golden sword suspended in the air, its three-foot golden radiance cleaving through the void, its brilliant sword intent as majestic as the sun and moon, towering over all.

The other showed endless surging waves, dense mist obscuring the heavens as if to drown the world.

The moment these two diagrams appeared, Gu Yuan's Seed of Heaven and Earth Evergreen Diagram began operating on its own.

A green seed slowly manifested in his mind.

"Boom!"

As the seed emerged, a profound and mighty force descended from the void, merging the two diagrams and the green seed in an enigmatic manner.

Countless golden threads materialized in the air, and Gu Yuan seemed to hear the celestial music of the Great Dao, filled with divine wonder.

The golden threads coalesced, forming a brand-new diagram.

A vast emerald sea, a handsome youth striding across the waves, behind him a towering ancient tree reaching for the heavens.

Above, a dazzling sun threatened to blind all who gazed upon it—a sun composed of countless sword rays.

Emerald sea, green wood, golden sun.

These three wondrous concepts fused perfectly, forming a mystical trajectory that entered Gu Yuan's body.

"Boom!"

All the spiritual energy in Gu Yuan's body surged violently. The pathways of the Seed of Heaven and Earth Evergreen Diagram were shattered, replaced by a new, more divine trajectory.

"Rumble—"

The spiritual energy churned uncontrollably, causing blood to seep from Gu Yuan's skin—a result of the violent energy fluctuations.

"Boom!"

Within Dry Origin Cave, spiritual energy flooded toward Gu Yuan like a tide, following the new trajectory and gradually condensing into denser spiritual power.

Gu Yuan had long since closed his eyes.

In his dantian, the Three-Hearts Golden Seal shone brilliantly, radiating divine light.

The transformation was brutal yet seamless, as if ordained by nature. Gu Yuan sat cross-legged, bathed in the Great Dao's aura, a satisfied smile on his lips.

After a long while, the changes within him finally ceased.

The silver beast-skin on his lap had crumbled to dust, vanishing as if it had never existed.

"Threefold Dharma Celestial Diagram!"

"What a magnificent Threefold Dharma Celestial Diagram!"

"Water, wood, and sword—three techniques combined. From this day forth, I have the means to contend with Golden Core lineages..."

Gu Yuan opened his eyes, feeling the tripled spiritual energy within him, and couldn't help but laugh heartily.
