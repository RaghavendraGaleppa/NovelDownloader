# Chapter 10: Second Level of Qi Refining, Minor Mastery of Spells  

Gazing at the words before him, Qi Chuan wasn't surprised—he merely nodded slightly.  

He had seen similar words before.  

Half a month ago, when he first began practicing the Fireball Technique and used the hundredfold multiplier to enhance his progress, he hadn't neglected his cultivation entirely. After all, in the world of immortal cultivation, one's cultivation level was ultimately the most important.  

However, during those past two weeks, his main focus had indeed been on mastering the basic Five Elements spells. As for his cultivation, he had only practiced a few cycles as part of his routine.  

But this had already given him a taste of how the hundredfold multiplier could enhance his cultivation.  

Now, Qi Chuan closed his eyes slightly and sensed the spiritual energy within his body. He could clearly feel a slight increase in the total amount of his spiritual power.  

This improvement wasn't particularly significant for his overall cultivation, but it was still noticeable.  

After all, Qi Chuan had only completed one full cycle of the Evergreen Technique.  

Given the cultivation speed of a lower eighth-grade spiritual root, the increase in spiritual power from a single cycle was normally almost imperceptible. The fact that Qi Chuan could clearly feel the improvement now was only possible because he had triggered a twentyfold multiplier, stacking twenty times the usual gains.  

"Not bad. I'll keep going."  

Qi Chuan closed his eyes and resumed his cultivation.  

**[You diligently practiced, completing one full cycle of the Evergreen Technique. Triggered a tenfold multiplier—gained ten times the rewards. Your spiritual power increased slightly.]**  

**[You diligently practiced, completing one full cycle of the Evergreen Technique. Triggered an eightfold multiplier—gained eight times the rewards. Your spiritual power increased slightly.]**  

...  

However, no matter how much Qi Chuan wished to continue cultivating with the hundredfold multiplier, it wasn't possible.  

After some time, he had to stop.  

A faint, almost imperceptible stinging sensation had begun to spread through his meridians.  

At the first level of Qi Refining, there were limits to how much he could cultivate each day—limits imposed by his own body. Exceeding them would cause damage to his meridians.  

Unable to further advance his cultivation, Qi Chuan turned his attention to practicing spells.  

"Fireball Technique!"  

He formed hand seals, recited the incantation, and raised his right hand. A crimson fireball, about the size of a red date, materialized in his palm, formed entirely from his spiritual energy.  

Instead of dispersing it immediately, Qi Chuan maintained the fireball for a while before finally withdrawing his energy.  

**[You successfully cast the Fireball Technique and maintained it for a period of time. Triggered a thirtyfold multiplier—gained thirty times the rewards. Your proficiency in the Fireball Technique improved slightly.]**  

Qi Chuan could clearly feel his mastery of the Fireball Technique advancing from the beginner stage toward minor mastery.  

"Thirty times the rewards—impressive!"  

A satisfied smile appeared on his face.  

"From now on, I'll focus on both cultivation and spells."  

"And not just the Fireball Technique—other basic Five Elements spells like the Water Arrow Technique need improvement too."  

...  

While Qi Chuan continued his quiet and diligent training, the outside world grew increasingly turbulent.  

Under the restrictions imposed by the Fengyue Sect, most cultivation families—whether they had Foundation Establishment cultivators or were smaller, struggling clans—had obediently stayed away from the area near the secret realm.  

Many families living near the fifty-li exclusion zone, like the Qi Family, had also restrained their members, discouraging them from venturing out.  

But not all families followed the same approach.  

Some even took advantage of the chaos to attack other clans.  

In the shadows, a few families cast covetous glances toward the secret realm, though very few dared to take any real action.  

...  

Time flew by, and before he knew it, a full year had passed.  

On this day...  

**[You diligently practiced, completing one full cycle of the Evergreen Technique. Triggered a fortyfold multiplier—gained forty times the rewards. Your spiritual power increased slightly. You have successfully advanced to the second level of Qi Refining.]**  

Qi Chuan sat cross-legged, slowly opening his eyes.  

As the words appeared before him, he felt a significant surge in his spiritual energy.  

Compared to when he had first reached the first level of Qi Refining, his spiritual power had grown immensely—he had now officially entered the second level.  

After all, the first three levels of Qi Refining only required the accumulation of spiritual energy. As long as one reached a certain threshold, they would advance to the next level without any bottlenecks.  

Only when approaching the fourth level would one encounter a minor obstacle—the mid-stage bottleneck.  

Though it was only a small hurdle, many cultivators found themselves stuck there.  

Having reached the second level, a faint smile appeared in Qi Chuan's eyes.  

He felt that, with his current spiritual power alone, he could easily overpower his former first-level self.  

But his progress over the past year wasn't limited to just his cultivation level.  

"Fireball Technique!"  

Qi Chuan quickly formed hand seals, and in the next moment, a crimson fireball rose from his palm.  

Unlike before, the fireball was no longer the size of a red date—it was now nearly half the size of a fist!  

Moreover, his casting speed had also improved significantly.  

This was because, after a year of diligent practice and the help of the hundredfold multiplier, Qi Chuan's Fireball Technique had reached minor mastery!  

A minor-mastery Fireball Technique was already a formidable offensive skill in the early and middle stages of Qi Refining.  

If used against an opponent who had only reached the beginner level in the Water Arrow Technique, this half-fist-sized fireball would only be slightly weakened. The remaining force would be enough to severely injure—or even kill—a cultivator in the early or middle stages of Qi Refining!  

But the Fireball Technique wasn't the only spell Qi Chuan had mastered.  

In fact, all of his basic Five Elements spells had reached minor mastery!  

This breakthrough wasn't just due to his dedication—though he had indeed poured almost all his spare time into spell practice. Another key factor was that the multiplier from his golden finger had been unexpectedly high.  

"Second level of Qi Refining, all basic Five Elements spells at minor mastery..."  

"With this level of strength, I shouldn't be considered weak among early and mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators, right?"  

Qi Chuan smiled faintly at the thought.  

Stepping out of his small house, he stood atop the solitary mountain peak and gazed at the scenery in the distance. After a moment, he began tending to the spirit herb fields scattered across the mountainside.  

Over the past year, whenever he had free time, he had taken care of these neglected fields.  

Under his care, the once-chaotic fields had begun to show some order.  

Some of the unknown spirit herbs had also grown much healthier.  

Though he wasn't a professional spirit herb cultivator and had no real experience in planting or managing spirit plants, these particular herbs were hardy and resilient despite their long growth cycles and low value.  

As long as Qi Chuan didn't make any major mistakes, they wouldn't die easily.  

And even if a few did perish, it wasn't a big deal—just as Second Elder had said, these herbs weren't worth much spirit stone.  

Though Qi Chuan had only tended to them occasionally when he had the time and inclination, his techniques had gradually improved.  

Half an hour later, Qi Chuan straightened up from the fields and exhaled deeply, feeling refreshed.  

**[You diligently tended to the spirit herbs for half an hour. Triggered a threefold multiplier—gained three times the rewards. Your experience and skill in herb cultivation improved slightly.]**  

Clearly, the reason Qi Chuan's herb-tending skills now looked somewhat professional was precisely this.
