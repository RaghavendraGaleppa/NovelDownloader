# Chapter 49: Ten Days of Cultivation Can't Compare to One Second of Cheating

**[Northern Winds (3): After the battle at the Mountain God Temple, you were furious, believing Firecloud Zhenren had overstepped by daring to oppose you. You ventured deeper into the northern lands, repeatedly thwarting Firecloud Zhenren's plans.]**

**[This drew Firecloud Zhenren's serious attention, prompting him to hire the 27th-ranked martial artist on the Human Ranking—Jin Sanming, the Crimson Blood Hand.]**

**[When you crossed paths with this martial artist—one who had achieved the Three Flowers Gathered at the Summit and Five Qi Returning to Origin, reaching the pinnacle of the Xiantian realm—you felt no pressure whatsoever. The appearance of Ziyang Daoren had driven you to train relentlessly, pushing your strength to new heights. You had already condensed the Celestial Flower and Earthly Flower, needing only the Human Flower to reach the peak of the Xiantian realm.]**

**[Jin Sanming lived up to his reputation as a top disciple of the Divine Blood Sect and a high-ranking martial artist on the Human Ranking. His strength was earth-shaking.]**

**[The Crimson Blood Divine Art manifested as a surging river of blood, overwhelming and drowning all in its path.]**

**[You focused intently. After ten exchanges, you effortlessly discerned Jin Sanming's flaw. He had pursued the power of his demonic techniques by killing indiscriminately, falling into the trap of his own cultivation. His mind had been twisted by the demonic arts—seemingly powerful, yet in truth, he was controlled by them rather than mastering them.]**

**[The vast river of blood and its overwhelming aura concealed the flaw in his technique. Each attack, though visually spectacular, was actually his weakest moment. With sufficient speed, one could pierce through the three-inch weakness in the northwest direction.]**

**[Though you saw through his weakness, you chose not to exploit it immediately.]**

**[Because with your next sword strike, he would be unable to resist.]**

**[Had you not been studying the mysteries of the Crimson Blood Divine Art, he wouldn’t have lasted five strikes.]**

**[You crippled Jin Sanming’s martial arts but spared his life—not out of mercy, but to issue a challenge to Jin Wuming, ranked in the top ten of the Human Ranking. After returning home for secluded training, you had set your sights on claiming the top spot on the Human Ranking.]**

**[Jin Wuming was just the beginning. You planned to challenge your way up until you stood alone at the summit.]**

**[Just as you were about to leave after sparing Jin Sanming, you were ambushed.]**

**[Firecloud Zhenren, disregarding martial honor, had arranged for a Divine Marvel Grandmaster to attack. This Grandmaster, Wang Chongguang, had arrived early but waited in hiding, striking only after you defeated Jin Sanming and let your guard down.]**

**[Wang Chongguang, a figure of mixed reputation from Beiyang, was instantly recognized by you. Faced with the ambush of a Divine Marvel Grandmaster, you knew you could no longer hold back. The Human Flower manifested, and in an instant, your strength reached the pinnacle of the Xiantian realm.]**

**[The five major Qi apertures opened wide. The Tiger Soul Blade, long stored in your pack and wrapped in cloth, finally saw the light of day once more.]**

**[Though broken, the Tiger Soul Blade remained a divine weapon. Recognizing its master, it allowed you to comprehend the Seven Kills of the White Tiger. Today, you finally unleashed it with the blade.]**

**[With the divine weapon drawn, heaven and earth trembled.]**

**[A single slash felled the Divine Marvel Grandmaster. Yet you felt no pride in slaying a superior opponent—only emptiness.]**

**[You were not one to rely on divine weapons for dominance. Sheathing the Tiger Soul Blade once more, you felt deep dissatisfaction with Wang Chongguang. Storming his estate with intent to slaughter, you suddenly reconsidered—heaven favors life, and excess should be avoided.]**

**[You executed Wang Chongguang’s entire clan but spared the servants. As you prepared to leave, you discovered a hidden chamber beneath his lake, obtaining yet another thousand-year treasure herb. Yet you felt nothing—such "fortune" had become mundane to you.]**

**[Ten days of diligent cultivation rewarded: Xiantian True Qi!]**  

**[Complete!]**  

"Damn it."  

Even upon reviewing it a second time, Dou Changsheng couldn't help but curse at his future self.  

The snowball effect of Future Dou's growth was becoming increasingly absurd. Every time he faced adversity, he pulled out a solution. Even if Firecloud Zhenren—a Grandmaster of the Earth Ranking—personally ambushed him, only to be slain in return, Dou Changsheng wouldn’t be surprised.  

His own rise had been due to the Thousand-Year Earth Pearl, but that was just one of Future Dou's many strokes of fortune. His luck was terrifying—even a thousand-year treasure herb no longer counted as a "fortune" to him, just routine.  

The Tiger Soul Blade—a divine weapon.  

This was a treasure far surpassing even the finest artifacts.  

Likely, even a Grandmaster like Firecloud Zhenren didn’t possess one, yet Future Dou did.  

Countless versions of Dou Changsheng had been sacrificed to elevate this one future self.  

He needed to study Future Dou’s movements—he wanted that Tiger Soul Blade too.  

Time passed minute by minute as Dou Changsheng observed the chaotic caravan. Jin Sanming hadn’t acted alone; he had accomplices, or else the disturbance wouldn’t have been so great.  

Truth be told, Jin Sanming had done well for himself in the future. In just over three years, he had climbed from rank 79 to rank 27 on the Human Ranking. His brother, Jin Wuming, had even broken into the top ten.  

Of course, some of this was due to others aging out of the ranking or leaving for other reasons.  

But these brothers were undeniably strong in talent, ability, and luck.  

Inside his body, his Xiantian Inner Qi was rapidly transforming. In mere breaths, it had fully evolved into Xiantian True Qi.  

This was excellent—every last strand of his inner energy had converted.  

It wasn’t just a single wisp of True Qi emerging, with the rest needing gradual refinement. This transformation had instantly upgraded all the Xiantian Inner Qi in his dantian and five major Qi apertures into True Qi.  

In other words—Dou Changsheng had now achieved the Five Qi Returning to Origin, reaching the perfected stage of the Xiantian True realm.  

The cultivation of the Five Qi was about refining Inner Qi into True Qi.  

Now, in one step, he had completed it—no further refinements needed.  

Put simply, Dou Changsheng was now a Xiantian True realm martial artist with Five Qi Returning to Origin.  

The Jin Sanming of three years later was a Xiantian perfected martial artist with Three Flowers Gathered at the Summit and Five Qi Returning to Origin. The current Jin Sanming definitely hadn’t fully condensed his Three Flowers and didn’t possess Xiantian True Essence—just True Qi, like Dou Changsheng.  

With both of them wielding supreme martial arts and being at similar cultivation levels, and with Dou Changsheng fully aware of Jin Sanming’s weaknesses—not to mention the vast reserves of True Qi granted by the Thousand-Year Earth Pearl—how could he feel any pressure?  

Just moments ago, when leaving Chen Taizhen’s side, Dou Changsheng had been filled with anxiety. Now, with his "cheat" activated, he brimmed with confidence.  

A rustling sound echoed as a figure emerged from the shadows.  

Without even looking, Dou Changsheng drew the Hero’s Sword and struck.  

**First Sword of the Thirteen Golden Swords.**  

His immense Xiantian True Qi, arranged in the **Formation of Ten Thousand Armies**, surged with overwhelming momentum—like an unstoppable tide of soldiers converging into a single strike.  

This sword was swift, ruthless, and backed by the sharpness of a superior weapon.  

It was a peerless strike.  

The vast sword energy, though individually rigid like mindless soldiers, formed into battle formations, exuding an indomitable aura and an invincible spirit.  

This sword carried divine intent.  

This was the true terror of the **Formation of Ten Thousand Armies**—it could elevate the power of sword techniques, palm strikes, and other martial arts, forcibly raising their grade.  

This was the foundation of Yu Yun’s century-long dominance as the foremost of the Ten Great Generals.  

The bloody shadows erupted in layers, only to be effortlessly torn apart as the Hero’s Sword pierced through.  

Without even a chance to speak, the 79th-ranked martial artist on the Human Ranking—Jin Sanming, the Blood Hand—  

**Died.**  

Too fragile.  

Maybe that wasn’t Jin Sanming?  

He’d wait a bit longer.  

...  

A while later.  

Why hadn’t Jin Sanming shown up yet?  

He’d wait a little more.  

...  

Another moment passed.  

The flames gradually died down.  

No way...  

No way that was actually Jin Sanming, right?  

He hadn’t even used his full strength!  

How could he have fallen so easily?!
