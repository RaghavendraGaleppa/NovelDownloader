# Chapter 70: From the Depths of the Mountains to the Fragrance in the City

Drunkard's Glow Pavilion was bustling with activity, all tables occupied. The Thunderfire Forging Hall was a hot topic, with almost all Newly Awakened talking about it. After all, the time was approaching, less than half a month away—it would be here in a flash.

"I'm looking forward to the snow melting, the spring thunder booming, and the plants budding. Old Zhao here is ready to go all out this year. I'm seventy-two, and even if I die there, I'll have no regrets. But if I succeed in forging a Thunderfire Physique, I'll experience a second spring!"

"May Old Zhao's withered tree blossom again, be reborn through the baptism of the Thunderfire Heavenly Light, and even have another son next year."

"You're making my heart pound too. How many chances does one get in life? Thirty years from now, when I'm seventy-two, I'll also enter the Thunderfire Forging Hall and give it my all!"

Qin Ming then noticed that most of the Newly Awakened in Drunkard's Glow Pavilion were young and middle-aged adults, with a portion being quite old. Those under twenty, like him and Wu Zheng, were few.

Xu Sheng said, "Most of the Newly Awakened who come here are 'wild paths,' not affiliated with local organizations or sects, nor are they nobles." Of course, becoming a Newly Awakened was no simple feat; some experts here were incredibly powerful and influential. If they encountered a tricky mutated creature, they could rally a large group of people to enter the mountains.

Afterward, Qin Ming asked a question he was very concerned about. "Brother Xu, what level of Newly Awakened can enter that Thunderfire Forging Hall?" Clearly, those who had undergone three or four awakenings would have a higher chance of survival there than those who had undergone only one or two.

"Anyone can go in. Generally, for a first awakening, enduring one bolt of Thunderfire Heavenly Light in the Bronze Hall is enough. Those seeking a second awakening might endure two bolts... But after enduring the corresponding number of Thunderfire Heavenly Lights for your own level, do you still expect to come out alive?" Xu Sheng explained that even if someone assisted from outside, preparing ropes in advance to pull a person out at a critical moment, it would be useless. The only difference would be whether the corpse was somewhat intact or completely charred; either way, they would be dead.

Qin Ming mused that if he were to go to the Thunderfire Forging Hall, he would need to endure at least four baptisms of heavenly light.

Wu Zheng shook his head. "Looks like I'll need to emulate that old man and go when I'm seventy or eighty."

Xu Sheng laughed, "Haha, good point. I'll wait until I'm a hundred."

Qin Ming asked, "If someone can withstand the baptism of Thunderfire Heavenly Light, can they go again next time, and will it still be effective?"

"Being baptized once is already a favor from heaven; you want to go a second time? But now that you mention it, it reminds me that there really was such a person," Xu Sheng said. He paused slightly, reminiscing. "Decades ago, there was a young man who endured it for two consecutive years. In his third year, he went again, truly feeling overconfident, thinking he could still receive that 'heavenly grace.' He ended up dying terribly." Xu Sheng explained that the young man had a powerful background, an unusual physique, and most importantly, his Awakening technique originated from an incredibly rare secret manual. When cultivated to a profound level, his fists could emit lightning.

Wu Zheng was stunned, instantly feeling that his own ancient scrolls on "Twin Arts of Spear and Arrow" were less impressive.

Xu Sheng also yearned greatly. "That was a rare secret manual that could cultivate special abilities, and it was related to lightning, which is why he dared to go. How could an ordinary person withstand it?"

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming also felt his heart itch. Some top-tier inheritances were indeed alluring, and he knew without a doubt that they were controlled by lineages with astonishing backgrounds and and mysterious large organizations.

Xu Sheng added, "A century ago, there was an even more overconfident person who endured two spring thunders. He wanted to try the violent summer thunder, but eventually crawled out of the Golden Hall, wailing. His body was severely corroded by the heavenly light, his head turned crimson, and then his brains were cooked through."

"Brothers, something's happened in the mountains! A five-times mutated spiritual creature has appeared in Fire Cloud Ridge! Boss Liang Yukang is leading a hunt and has already severely wounded it. But they've also suffered heavy losses and some are about to give out. They're calling for help now, saying 'finders keepers'!" A middle-aged man ran up to Drunkard's Glow Pavilion, quickly relaying the news.

"Fire Cloud Ridge? Isn't that the territory of the famous Fire-Scaled Bird? They dared to go to such a dangerous place, they're too bold!"

"I didn't make it clear; it's the forest outside Fire Cloud Ridge, an area open for hunting!"

"Let's go!" With a whoosh, many Newly Awakened rushed out of Drunkard's Glow Pavilion, their hearts stirred. Since the mutated creature was already severely wounded, they could go check the situation first. If the opportunity was right, they would join in.

Xu Sheng remarked, "Liang Yukang's group has a good reputation, though."

"Should we go join the fun?" Qin Ming's eyes shone with a fiery glint.

"Little Qin, aren't you too eager? You haven't even found an inn or put down your luggage, and you're rushing off to hunt in the deep mountains?" Although Xu Sheng said this, he was also tempted. He asked, "How many awakenings have you had?"

"Two," Qin Ming replied, holding back some information.

Xu Sheng nodded. "Alright then, just watch from a distance later to gain some experience. Even if that mutated creature is about to die, don't get too close."

Wu Zheng also had a longing look, but understood his strength wasn't enough. Having just undergone his first awakening, he didn't even qualify to watch the excitement.

A large group of people exited the North City Gate, trudging through knee-deep snow, and quickly entered the forest in the mountains.

In the shallow night, Redglow City glowed as bright as day, but upon entering the forest, they felt the darkness of night. Some adapted for a moment before starting to speed up their journey.

Outside Fire Cloud Ridge, a massive azure bull, its entire body glowing with fire, was furiously charging. It was indeed severely wounded and going berserk.

"So it's this old bull! I heard that recently, more than ten Newly Awakened encountered it in the mountains and all died under its hooves, trampled to pulp."

"Taking it down today will be ridding us of a menace!" Many said this, but no one stepped forward, wanting others to make the first move.

"A bull this big weighs thousands of pounds! There's enough meat for everyone, brothers, let's go together to avoid any prolonged delays or attracting other monsters!" someone shouted.

With a boom, an old tree, so thick it would take several people to embrace it, was shattered by the azure bull's charge. Its eyes blazing crimson, it gored another Newly Awakened with its horns.

"As expected of a spiritual creature! It has over a dozen iron spears stuck in it and still hasn't fallen, and it's getting fiercer!"

"Brothers, if you act now, you can get a share of the azure bull's meat later! If you wait for it to fall before joining, you won't be qualified to share!" Liang Yukang personally shouted. His refined gold armor was shattered, and a deep gash from the bull's horn ran across his arm. Instantly, many couldn't hold back, because the azure bull was heavily wounded, and might fall at any moment. Some threw spears, some shot arrows, and some experts tried to approach it.

"Pfft!" Qin Ming also shot an arrow from a distance, hitting the corner of the azure bull's eye. Although its hide was thick and tough, the arrowhead didn't penetrate deep, but it was a vulnerable spot, almost piercing its eyeball. It immediately roared in agony, and blood flowed into its eyes.

"Attack quickly! Its left eye is blurred by blood; seize the chance to finish it!"

"Remember, that arrow was shot by my brother, Little Qin! Give him an extra share of beef later!" Xu Sheng shouted, also charging forward.

"Pfft!" Finally, a massive bull's head fell to the ground, severed by Liang Yukang himself. The several-thousand-pound azure bull's corpse crashed onto the ground, making the forest floor tremble slightly, and blood stained the snow.

Liang Yukang gasped heavily, his gleaming long saber radiating a terrifying light, stained with the mutated creature's blood. With his shattered armor and disheveled hair, he looked very intimidating. He shouted loudly, "Brothers, line up for your meat, everyone gets a share, no grabbing! Otherwise, Old Liang's long saber won't just be chopping mutated creatures!"

"Boss Liang is truly righteous! Such a large azure bull means there's no need to fight for it; everyone can get some. Brothers, be mindful!"

Instantly, this part of the forest became lively. Everyone was happy, especially those who arrived later and gained something with little effort.

Half an hour later, the azure beef was completely distributed. Some couldn't wait and roasted a piece on the spot.

"What's going on? The beef looks translucent and crystalline, but after roasting, it feels like it lacks spirituality. What's wrong?"

"We've been tricked! All of this azure bull's essence must have been in its bezoar, which Boss Liang secretly took!"

"Where's Liang Yukang?"

"He said he wasn't feeling well, badly injured, and left half an hour ago."

Immediately, the forest erupted in anger, a group of people furiously searching for Liang Yukang. Everyone was spewing profanities, including Qin Ming, who couldn't help but curse a couple of times.

That day, a large group of enraged people cursed all the way from the mountains into the city. When they stormed Liang Yukang's residence, they found he indeed hadn't returned; he had completely run off. The group cursed him, especially those Newly Awakened who had initially entered the mountains with him to attack the azure bull. They were furious, as they had all suffered serious injuries, only for Boss Liang to selfishly flee with the spiritual material. As for the few who died in the mountains, they were even more pathetic.

All day, many people in Redglow City talked about this incident. A lot of people cursed Liang Yukang for being unjust, saying that his good reputation accumulated over the past two years was all for this final "scam."

In the evening, the geothermal springs were already less "active," and with stone slabs covering various areas, the entire city's brightness significantly decreased, becoming somewhat dim. In fact, some areas were completely dark. This adjustability gave Redglow City a distinction between day and night.

Qin Ming and Wu Zheng checked into an inn. Qin Ming roasted the piece of beef he received and invited Wu Zheng to taste it with him.

"It tastes pretty good, but that Liang Yukang is too much of a swindler!" Qin Ming said.

Xu Sheng arrived with wine, sighing, "For higher levels of transformation and awakening, fathers and sons can fall out, husbands and wives can turn against each other. Anything can happen. Be careful in the future."

The next day, Qin Ming entered the mountains again. This time, Xu Sheng organized the trip. He had received news from his master, an old traveling merchant, that deep in the mountains there was a den of white apes guarding several snow lotuses rich in spiritual essence.

"Unfortunately, only one plant is left. The others have already matured and been eaten by those white apes!" Xu Sheng lamented.

"A spiritual material that can grant a fourth awakening is extremely valuable!" A woman said, her eyes burning with desire. She was a friend Xu Sheng had invited.

"We'll trigger an avalanche to scare away those white apes, then quickly move in to harvest. This den of white apes is very troublesome. If we fail, we must retreat immediately, don't waste time."

However, after successfully scaring away the den of white apes, a gray-robed figure with a covered face appeared, snatching the translucent snow lotus first. Their speed was incredibly fast, disappearing into the mountains.

Xu Sheng was so furious his lungs felt like they would explode. He had immediately organized the trip after receiving the news, and was on the verge of success, only to be intercepted by a gray-robed figure.

Qin Ming also felt a surge of suppressed anger. Although there was only one snow lotus, and he probably wouldn't achieve a fourth awakening even if he got a portion, being robbed like this still made him want to smash the person's face into a blossoming mess with a hammer.

"Don't you ever fall into my hands, don't let me find out who you are!" Even the woman couldn't stand it, cursing all the way.

This time, Qin Ming did as the Romans did, and cursed all the way from the mountains to the city with them. He felt that making a living in Redglow City wasn't so easy; the Newly Awakened here were both deceptive and malicious.

"Sigh, all in all, my strength isn't strong enough. Let the spring thunder boom earlier!"

***

In just five or six days, peculiar phenomena began to appear outside the city. Earth light steamed up, and the gloomy forests suddenly brightened, with intermittent showers of light. This was the underground geothermal springs reviving, starting to emit rays of light towards the surface to nourish all things, and the snow began to melt slowly.

Many nobles ventured out of the city to enjoy the scenery. Every year at this season, the mountains were exceptionally splendid, the snow-covered landscape stretching endlessly, looking particularly magnificent amidst the mists.

"This year, early spring might arrive a bit sooner," Xu Sheng judged.

"Brother Xu, take me to see the Thunderfire Forging Hall on Redglow Mountain." Qin Ming prepared to scout the location in advance, as the spring thunder could arrive at any moment.

"I'll go too, I want to see that Golden Hall," Wu Zheng said, but he regretted it quickly.

Because they witnessed what was truly a "sea of people." After the earth light began to steam, not only nobles drove out of the city to travel, but ordinary people also brought their children out. Redglow Mountain, as a famous scenic spot with experts guarding it, would not have any anomalies, so it was truly packed with people. Even nobles had no choice; no one paid them any mind. The crowd surged, and exotic beast carriages were useless. Some noble ladies got out and walked, and were squeezed so hard they screamed, looking disheveled, their hairpins falling off.

Qin Ming ascended the mountain with the crowd, unable to clearly see the specific beauty of the mountain; he was swept along by the human tide. Before he could properly examine the various buildings on the mountaintop, he was again pushed forward. At a critical moment, he finally managed to break free and enter the Thunderfire Forging Hall.

Wu Zheng's face was crumpled, crying. He had undergone an awakening once, but one of his shoes had been lost in the crush. He indignantly said, "I didn't even get a clear look at what the Thunderfire Forging Hall looks like outside before I was pushed in!"

"I didn't get a good look either!" Qin Ming said, standing inside the Thunderfire Forging Hall. His concentration was extremely high as he carefully examined it, even touching the walls.

"Boom!" He stumbled, almost falling to the ground, because he felt an incredibly violent emotional fluctuation. How could this ancient hall allow his spirit to resonate with it? He was very shocked.
