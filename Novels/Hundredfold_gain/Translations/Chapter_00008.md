# Chapter 8: The True Value of the Golden Finger

About half a month later, on the unnamed solitary peak where Qi Baicang and Qi Chuan resided.

Whoosh!

A crimson light streaked through the void, landing on the branch of an unnamed great tree.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The date-sized fireball wrapped in the crimson light instantly transformed into a sea of flames upon touching the branch, rapidly spreading to engulf the entire tree.

In that moment, it seemed as though wind and fire raged together, illuminating half the mountain peak in a crimson glow, resembling twilight beneath fiery clouds.

In the blink of an eye, the entire tree was reduced to ashes that scattered to the ground. The combustion was so thorough that only a small circle of ash remained, quickly dispersing in the wind.

Within moments, a towering living tree had vanished without a trace.

"So this is the power of magic—truly incomparable to ordinary fire," Qi Chuan couldn't help but marvel at the awe-inspiring sight.

This spectacle was, of course, his own doing.

Over the past half-month, he had diligently practiced his spells and finally mastered the five basic elemental magics.

As someone who had been an ordinary person in his previous life, he had never encountered such mystical powers before. After restraining himself for so long, he could no longer resist the urge to test the might of his magic.

The power of the fireball spell did not disappoint—it was unexpectedly formidable.

Fortunately, he hadn't tested the fireball spell inside his room earlier. Otherwise, the entire dwelling might have vanished, leaving him without a place to stay.

"What a disaster, Ah Chuan! Why did you burn that tree for no reason?" Qi Baicang hurried out of his cottage nearby, alarmed by the commotion. At first, he thought an outsider cultivator had attacked the mountain, only to realize it was his own descendant causing trouble.

"Ah, it's about to catch again! Again!" he exclaimed as he noticed a small remaining ember drifting through the air, about to land on a patch of forest below. If it touched, half the mountain would be destroyed—a catastrophe.

His eyes widening in alarm, Qi Baicang immediately formed hand seals, preparing to extinguish the ember with a spell.

However, Qi Chuan had already noticed the stray ember. With a completed hand seal, a thumb-thick water arrow shot out, colliding with the ember midair and extinguishing it.

"Phew..." Seeing this, Qi Baicang relaxed, dispersing his unfinished seal.

He then turned to scold Qi Chuan, "Ah Chuan, I won't lecture you too much for being young and playful, but fire isn't something to toy with carelessly. A single misstep could destroy half the mountain..."

"Second Uncle, I only burned that tree because it was blocking sunlight from reaching these spirit herbs," Qi Chuan said innocently, pointing to a small patch of spirit plants near the circle of ashes. The leaves of the plants were yellowed and withered, clearly starved of sunlight.

"These spirit herbs are barely tended and hardly worth any spirit stones. But that tree—I planted it decades ago and had grown somewhat attached to it. And now you've burned it down..." Qi Baicang's tone was reproachful but also regretful.

"Alright, I was wrong," Qi Chuan admitted obediently.

It seemed he had overthought things. Judging by the wild and untended state of the spirit fields on this mountain, his uncle likely only grew hardy, low-maintenance plants to trade for resources occasionally—hardly something that required meticulous care.

"...I'll let it go this time, but don't do it again," Qi Baicang relented with a sigh. Fortunately, the fire hadn't spread, and the loss was just an ordinary tree, not as important as his young descendant's well-being. Youthful mischief was to be expected.

"Next time you test a spell, call me over to supervise. This time, if not for that water arrow..." Qi Baicang began to lecture but abruptly stopped.

Only now did it dawn on him—Qi Chuan was only at Qi Refinement Level One and had just broken through recently. How had he managed to cast both the fireball and water arrow spells?

"Ah Chuan... you've mastered the fireball spell? And the water arrow spell too? Both of them?" Qi Baicang asked in disbelief.

"Yes, though only recently," Qi Chuan nodded.

Having already mastered all the basic spells, he had prepared the water arrow in advance to prevent any accidental fires. Otherwise, he wouldn't have recklessly burned the tree.

"Both mastered? In just half a month?!" Qi Baicang's eyes widened. It had been barely two weeks since he advised Qi Chuan to start practicing spells. Back in his day, mastering the fireball spell alone had taken him over a month.

Qi Chuan wanted to mention that he had mastered all five basic elemental spells from the Evergreen Manual, but seeing his uncle's stunned expression, he decided against it—no need to make things even more bewildering.

After staring at Qi Chuan for a long while and inspecting the ashes, Qi Baicang stroked his beard thoughtfully. "Ah Chuan, it seems you're a prodigy in spellcasting..."

"With this talent, if you can reach mid-stage Qi Refinement, your strength will be formidable."

"You must understand—in our family, aside from the few late-stage Qi Refinement elders, mid-stage cultivators are the backbone."

"Once you break through to mid-stage, your spellcasting prowess will let you surpass most of them and stand among the elite."

"By then, with your status, even I might enjoy some benefits."

His eyes gleamed as he spoke, amusing himself with the thought. After all, as a mere third-level Qi Refinement cultivator, he was a marginal figure in the family, destined for mediocrity and labor, with little support from the clan.

"This counts as being a spellcasting prodigy?" Qi Chuan was somewhat surprised.

It seemed mastering five basic elemental spells in half a month held even greater significance than he had imagined.

"Ah Chuan..." Qi Baicang chuckled, about to say more.

Bong!

Just then, a resounding bell toll echoed through the skies above Red Maple Valley, instantly stirring commotion across all its peaks.

Qi Baicang's expression changed as he turned toward the direction of the main peak, where the bell had originated.

Qi Chuan, equally startled, followed his gaze, unsure of what was happening.

Figures emerged from numerous peaks, swiftly making their way toward the main peak.

"What's going on?" Qi Chuan asked his uncle.

"Come with me—to the main peak!" Qi Baicang said gravely, quickly descending the mountain. His uneasy voice trailed behind:

"The main peak's bell signifies an event that concerns the entire family. All Qi cultivators must gather there immediately."

"So something major has truly happened?" Qi Chuan was surprised but didn't hesitate to follow his uncle toward the main peak.
