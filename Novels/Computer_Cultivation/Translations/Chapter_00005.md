# Chapter 5: Beixin Town

All natal magic treasures possess a common ability called "Size Alteration."

Even a massive construct like the Yuanshen-1, the size of a wardrobe, can be compressed into a palm-sized disc and stored within the dantian – an inner space shielded by energy barriers.

However, a behemoth like the Yuanshen-1 is not ideally suited to be a natal magic treasure. The size of a magic treasure is not necessarily better when larger.

Fundamentally, magic treasures are similar to cultivators. A cultivator's dantian cannot contain infinite energy, and neither can a magic treasure.

If one blindly pursues increasing the volume to enhance the magic power capacity, it will inevitably lead to the magic treasure becoming too large. Not only will it be difficult to control, but it will also be harder to refine into a natal object.

Therefore, when designing a magic treasure, to balance power and usability, its size must be limited.

The reason Yuanshen-1 succeeded is because Fang Jun designed it himself. Coupled with his exquisite algorithms and the Yuanshen-1's own assistance, he was able to refine it successfully.

An average cultivator would be stuck at the volume stage alone. Not to mention a second natal magic treasure.

Refining a natal magic treasure, in addition to the "Size Alteration" ability, has another benefit: the power of the magic treasure is enhanced.

This is because a natal magic treasure is more like a cultivator than an ordinary magic treasure. It subtly transforms into a living being, possessing its own dantian.

Therefore, the natal magic treasure grows stronger as the cultivator's cultivation level increases, because it is also cultivating itself.

Furthermore, the magic power it contains can also be added to the master, increasing the master's magic power output and total amount, making its power even greater.

Conversely, the master's magic power can also be added to the natal magic treasure.

Moreover, because natal magic treasures are not human, they require less sensitivity to changes in divine sense. As long as the understanding of the techniques and cultivation surpasses the cultivator's current realm, its level can be raised beyond one's own.

For example, Fang Jun's Tianjun Sword, although its cultivation level is only equivalent to the fourth level of Qi Refining, and based on the regular increase in magic power at each level of Qi Refining, Fang Jun's total magic power is actually equivalent to the third level of Qi Refining (himself) plus the fourth level of Qi Refining (Tianjun Sword), comparable to the seventh level of Qi Refining.

This is why Fang Jun was able to defeat Fang Qidong so easily.

Since ancient times in the cultivation world, for a lower-level person to overcome a higher-level person, the lower-level person must be stronger than the higher-level person in a certain area.

Or rather, there has never been a truly lower-level person. If they are strong in a certain area, they are already the higher-level person.

And Fang Jun, in terms of single magic power, is already the higher-level person.

Now, Fang Jun has obtained the Yuanshen-1 as his second natal magic treasure, its cultivation level equivalent to the third level of Qi Refining, making his total magic power close to the tenth level of Qi Refining.

Of course, in the cultivation world, the highest level of Qi Refining is nine, there is no tenth level.

Anything above the ninth level is achieved through the power of the natal magic treasure.

Thus, it can be seen that the power of a natal magic treasure is truly a multiplier of a cultivator's strength. Cultivators with and without natal magic treasures are worlds apart, the two cannot be compared.

Fang Jun, who had been sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, opened his eyes: "It's time. Returning kindness with resentment? I am cultivating immortality, not cultivating stones. I am seeking longevity, not being a slave to longevity."

"Since my good 'mother' wants my life, then the generous me will naturally take her life as well."

...

Towns in mortal kingdoms are mostly built along rivers, while towns for cultivators are built on spiritual veins.

Beixin Town is such a town, built on a spiritual vein.

Spiritual veins are limited, divided into outer, inner, and core layers: the outer layer has thin spiritual energy, not even reaching the first level; the inner layer has slightly denser spiritual energy, equivalent to Fang Jun's residence in Anxi City, reaching the lower grade of the first level; only the core layer's spiritual energy barely reaches the middle grade of the first level.

This is the Fang family's ancestral land, and the Fang family is the ruler of Beixin Town.

On this day, a handsome young man walked slowly into the town in front of the gate of Beixin Town. His eyes were calm, but deep down, he hid an imperceptible divine light.

"It has been fifteen years since I left home at the age of five."

Fang Jun felt emotional inside. Although there was some reminiscence, it was not strong.

After all, as a transmigrator, his first hometown was his previous life.

The five years he spent reincarnated in Beixin Town were just a short experience like studying abroad, not as profound as the fifteen years he spent in Anxi City.

"Whoa—!"

Suddenly, there was a burst of rapid hoofbeats and shouts from ahead.

The vendors on the street immediately panicked and frantically began to pack up their stalls, trying to avoid the impending chaos.

However, their movements were ultimately a step too slow.

A chestnut horse galloped past, and wherever its hooves passed, baskets overturned like dominoes, and goods such as green dates and red peppers fell all over the ground.

"Hahahaha!"

On horseback, a pretty girl with a delicate appearance let out a silver bell-like laugh, as if the chaos in front of her was just a game for her.

She rode away, leaving behind only a mess and vendors with helpless faces.

A vendor whose stall was knocked over sighed and complained in a low voice, "Alas, what a sin! This Second Miss Fang is inhuman, causing such a scene every now and then."

The companion next to him quickly covered his mouth, nervously looking around, "Are you crazy? How dare you say such things?"

Another younger companion said angrily, "Why can't I say it? Some time ago, there was someone who was unwilling to part with their wealth and was trampled to death by a horse. The family asked for an explanation, but now they don't even know where they are."

The companion who covered his mouth immediately switched to covering the other's mouth, even more nervous: "You know they don't even know where they are now, and you still dare to say it?"

Not far away, a child held in his mother's arms stared blankly at his overturned vegetable stall and asked innocently, "Mom, don't you always teach me 'People without etiquette will not live, things without etiquette will not succeed, and families without etiquette will not be peaceful'? Why is that person so impolite?"

The mother looked solemn and warned in a low voice, "Child, you must remember 'Heaven has no etiquette, it observes all beings equally'. In this place, the Fang family is heaven."

However, the chaos did not end there. Not long after, a team of iron-armored soldiers appeared on the street.

The leader coldly glanced at the mess on the ground and said, "You dare to make the streets so chaotic. According to the rules, you must pay 'sweeping money'."

The vendors looked at each other, their faces filled with helplessness and resentment, but they did not dare to say more. They could only reluctantly take out money and silently hand it over.

Because these people are all from the Fang family.

In the cultivation world, there are clear distinctions between ranks, and mortals have a low status, only above livestock.

And the rights of cultivators are not based on mortals, so their attitude towards mortals depends entirely on the ruler's mood.

Even if all the mortals die, it doesn't matter.

Because there will always be people who aspire to immortality who migrate and gather to form towns.

The street gradually returned to calm, but the air was filled with a suppressed atmosphere.

No one spoke much anymore, just silently restoring order.

Fang Jun stood aside, watching all this coldly, and said to himself: "Heh, the Fang family is heaven here, huh?"
