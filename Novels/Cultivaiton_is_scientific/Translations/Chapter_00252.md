# Chapter 252: Refining Corpses  

Li Shiming left the gates of the Thousand Illusions Sect. He wasn't sure if the monk from Thousand Leaves Temple who had been following him was still around. Glancing at the darkening sky, he estimated it would be completely dark in half an hour.  

He summoned his flying boat and set off toward the Shu Mountain Sect. Once night fell, he found an unclaimed mountain peak, carved out a cave, and set up concealment and isolation arrays.  

Venerable Zhiming had been keeping a close watch on Li Shiming. After Li Shiming entered the Thousand Illusions Sect's gates, the monk had waited outside. Fortunately, Thousand Leaves Temple and the Thousand Illusions Sect were allies, so Venerable Zhiming had informed the sect of his presence, allowing him to stay close to the gates without being expelled.  

Normally, a Golden Core cultivator from another sect loitering near a sect's grand formation would raise suspicions unless they were on an official visit. Sect formations were highly sensitive to Golden Core-level spiritual fluctuations. No matter how well a Golden Core cultivator concealed themselves, approaching too close would trigger the formation's detection.  

After all, Golden Core cultivators could significantly impact a sect's grand formation. If multiple Golden Core cultivators launched a surprise attack while the formation wasn't fully activated, they could cause severe damage. Thus, all sects remained highly vigilant against Golden Core cultivators attempting to approach their formations.  

Venerable Zhiming waited until Li Shiming left the Thousand Illusions Sect before continuing his pursuit. He followed until Li Shiming set up a temporary cave to rest.  

This wasn't unusual. With spirit pills, cultivators didn’t need a spiritual energy-rich environment to cultivate. Given Li Shiming's status as a high-level alchemist, he undoubtedly had plenty of cultivation pills. Venerable Zhiming assumed Li Shiming was preparing for his daily cultivation session.  

The monk stationed himself near the array, confident in his concealment artifact to avoid detection.  

Li Shiming didn’t act immediately. He needed time to adjust to his new late-stage Foundation Building realm. Recalling that his breakthrough had been triggered by spirit tea, he chuckled. No wonder cultivators valued spirit tea so highly.  

Of course, the tea had only been a catalyst. He had already been on the verge of breaking through to late-stage Foundation Building.  

Sensing the expanded spiritual lake within him, he noted that the once-full spiritual energy now occupied only one-tenth of the space. This was the spiritual energy capacity of late-stage Foundation Building—ten times that of a mid-stage peak cultivator.  

Moreover, the quality of his spiritual energy had improved dramatically. Previously, it had been liquid like water; now, it was viscous, akin to crude oil. Though still liquid, its density was incomparable.  

This transformation was largely due to the "Five Elements Absorption Array," which continuously purified his spiritual energy, refining it to the peak of his current realm. Even though he had just entered late-stage Foundation Building, his spiritual energy was already at the peak of the late stage.  

Li Shiming had mixed feelings about the array. On one hand, it provided immense benefits, keeping his spiritual energy at its peak and ensuring he possessed all five elemental spiritual energies. This versatility allowed him to learn and use a wide range of secret techniques without worrying about compatibility.  

On the other hand, he had found no records of similar phenomena in any texts, leaving his future path uncertain. When it came to forming his Golden Core, he would have to forge his own path—a daunting prospect.  

This was why he was so interested in the Five Elements Sect. As an ancient sect specializing in the five elements, even its ruins might offer insights through IBMz15's analysis, aiding his research.  

However, with the Thousand Leaves Temple monk watching, he couldn’t openly explore the ruins. If he discovered anything valuable, he doubted the monk would let him keep it.  

Additionally, he needed to send his clone, Li Yuanba, back to the Hundred Thousand Mountains. The temple's strange behavior made him wary of the consequences if they captured the clone.  

Though the clone wasn’t as crucial as initially expected, it remained a vital combat asset, especially after learning the "Sword Intent Soaring Art" in the Netherworld Sect. Li Yuanba was destined to become a top-tier Golden Core sword cultivator, capable of defeating multiple opponents simultaneously, much like Sword Elder.  

Li Shiming had distinct roles for his main body and clone. The main body focused on auxiliary skills like formations and alchemy, ensuring safety—since its death would likely doom the clone.  

That didn’t mean the main body was weak. In Foundation Building, it could overpower the clone, thanks to the Pure Dao Body's defensive and mental enhancements. At close range, even a half-step Golden Core cultivator would struggle against him.  

The clone, meanwhile, specialized in combat, accumulating experience and handling threats.  

As he pondered, Li Shiming retrieved corpse-refining materials from his spatial ring. Now at late-stage Foundation Building, he could fully refine the Iron Corpses stored in the ring's corpse-refining space.  

He also planned to refine the corpse of Venerable Jue Tu, the Buddha of Slaughter, into a powerful puppet.  

Venerable Jue Tu had practiced the "Slaughter to Enlightenment" method and reached half-step Golden Core strength. Even Elder Lü of the Netherworld Sect had coveted the corpse, preparing it for refinement immediately after death.  

From Elder Lü's spatial ring, Li Shiming had learned the elder was a master of corpse refinement, possessing ten peak Iron Corpses and one Silver Corpse. Had Elder Lü lived longer, he might have upgraded all ten to Silver Corpses, drastically increasing his combat power.  

A Silver Corpse was equivalent to a Golden Core cultivator—lacking in ranged attacks but excelling in defense and close combat. Eleven Silver Corpses would be a nightmare for any Golden Core opponent.  

Li Shiming refined Venerable Jue Tu's corpse, naming the resulting Iron Corpse "Slaughter." Unlike typical Iron Corpses, Slaughter's defense and attack power rivaled Jiang Chen's, the refined corpse of Golden Core sword cultivator Yun Xingyi.  

This was remarkable, as Jiang Chen had been downgraded to peak Iron Corpse level due to Li Yuanba's cultivation limits. Slaughter, though not yet at peak Iron Corpse, matched Jiang Chen's strength, indicating even greater potential.  

"From now on, you'll be called 'Slaughter,'" Li Shiming murmured, sensing the corpse in the refining space. He left its body unaltered, as its power stemmed from the slaughter aura ingrained during Venerable Jue Tu's life.  

According to the "Moonlight Corpse Scroll," Slaughter could grow stronger through killing, continuing Venerable Jue Tu's path—though it would likely become a demon of slaughter rather than an enlightened Buddha.  

Next, Li Shiming refined the ten peak Iron Corpses from Elder Lü's collection. With his enhanced spiritual sense, controlling twelve corpses (including Nezha) was manageable, though he felt slight mental strain.  

Among them, ten were peak Iron Corpses, Slaughter had peak-tier combat power, and Nezha was still at mid-stage Iron Corpse. With time, Nezha would catch up.  

He refrained from refining Elder Lü's corpse for now. Golden Core corpses could become Silver Corpses, and he wanted to wait until he reached Golden Core himself.  

Regrettably, refining Yun Xingyi's corpse early had cost him a potential Silver Corpse.  

With the corpses refined, Li Shiming began modifying them. Using a third-grade sword as a scalpel and corpses of Foundation Building cultivators as material, he grafted additional limbs, creating three-headed, six-armed Iron Corpses.  

The process was challenging due to the corpses' toughness, requiring Li Yuanba to imbue the sword with sword intent. After a day's work, all but Slaughter had been transformed.  

The modified corpses needed time to absorb Yin energy and integrate their new limbs before becoming combat-ready.  

Lastly, Li Shiming altered Slaughter's facial features to avoid recognition. Given his alliance with Thousand Leaves Temple, he couldn’t risk being linked to Venerable Jue Tu's corpse.  

The procedure was arduous—even Li Yuanba struggled to pierce Slaughter's skin. By reshaping its facial bones, they completely changed its appearance.  

The difficulty of the task underscored how formidable Slaughter would be in battle. Few Foundation Building cultivators could hope to breach its defenses.
