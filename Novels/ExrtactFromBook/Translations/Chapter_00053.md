# Chapter 53: Equal Retribution

Han Yue spoke up:  
"You two go ahead first. I'm faster on my feet—I'll catch up after resting a while longer."  

With that, Fang Yi and Xiao Liu set off.  

Han Yue continued silently absorbing [Sweet Dew], healing his injuries while also collecting his thoughts.  

Having experienced his first life-and-death battle, Han Yue felt his Dao heart had grown clearer, his mind more expansive.  

Recalling his earth-shattering strike, his confidence surged—his mastery of [Thoughtless Slash] had improved dramatically.  

The changes were evident in the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods* as well.  

His proficiency in [Thoughtless Slash] had jumped to 60%, far surpassing his other divine abilities.  

Now, with his new ability [Sweet Dew], Han Yue had a way to mitigate the backlash from overusing his powers. His combat strength had effectively skyrocketed once more.  

This sudden battle at Flesh Rend Bazaar would undoubtedly change many things for Han Yue.  

The life-and-death struggle and the choices made in crisis had been a spiritual baptism for him.  

Over ninety percent of the cultivators in Flesh Rend Bazaar had perished—yet the vast tide of beasts wasn't the main culprit.  

Instead, it was the collateral damage from the few attacks unleashed by the third-order Great Ape.  

If one were to tally the casualties, most cultivators had been crushed into paste under the ape's foot without any chance to resist.  

This proved one thing: in the *Jade Sky Realm*, cultivation strength was the ultimate deciding factor.  

Flesh Rend Bazaar had seemed grand and formidable, bustling with people—but like fireworks in full bloom or a raging fire, it was fleeting.  

At the first encounter with a newly ascended third-order demon, it had been utterly obliterated.  

Han Yue now clearly saw the fundamental issue with Flesh Rend Bazaar.  

Its unique organizational structure allowed for a dazzling variety of cultivation methods—spellcasters, body refiners, artifact cultivators—all coexisting.  

With abundant demonic beast resources and a crowdfunding-like distribution system, the barrier to cultivation had been lowered to a minimum.  

Flesh Rend Bazaar was a holy land for ordinary cultivators.  

Through long development and inheritance, it had fostered a massive community of a hundred thousand true cultivators—a unique phenomenon in the *Jade Sky Realm*.  

This was an incredibly valuable pool of human resources.  

If properly utilized, this environment should have nurtured a more advanced cultivation civilization, producing even greater masters.  

Yet it had ended in such ruin.  

In Han Yue's view, the Merchant Guild bore seventy percent of the blame.  

As the most powerful faction in Flesh Rend Bazaar, the Merchant Guild had effectively ruled over it.  

Through monopolistic practices, the guild had parasitized the bazaar, sucking dry the wealth, labor, and wisdom accumulated by generations of cultivators.  

Yet in the end, none of these resources were reinvested for the collective good—they became the exclusive spoils of a privileged few within the guild.  

Even at the bazaar's most desperate hour, the guild leader had prioritized his own escape over its survival.  

Unforgivable.  

If the founders of Flesh Rend Bazaar could see this from the afterlife, they would have wanted to grind Xu Yuan's bones to dust.  

In Han Yue's eyes, a monopolistic entity like the Merchant Guild, which hoarded resources by exploiting others' labor, should have used its wealth to nurture the most talented among the hundred thousand cultivators.  

Generation after generation, this would have strengthened Flesh Rend Bazaar's foundation.  

In a world where power dictated all, this would have been the wisest long-term strategy.  

The remaining thirty percent of the blame, Han Yue assigned to the Green Lotus Sword Sect.  

As an eternal sect that had stationed disciples in Flesh Rend Bazaar for generations, they couldn't have been ignorant of its flaws.  

With the sect's strength and the foresight of its immortal elders, even minimal guidance could have steered the bazaar onto the right path.  

Yet they had allowed short-sighted merchants to dictate the fate of such a massive community.  

At least in the final moments, Yang Fan's decisive stand had salvaged some dignity for the Green Lotus Sword Sect.  

Han Yue admitted that his own desperate fight had been partly inspired by Yang Fan's courage.  

But regardless, Flesh Rend Bazaar was now a thing of the past.  

All the wealth Han Yue had accumulated there had been converted into spirit stones and artifacts stored in his [Silver Hairpin].  

Though most of his acquaintances were gone, his two closest friends had survived.  

The experiences and gains here would become invaluable nourishment for his path forward.  

With his injuries fully healed, Han Yue retrieved a fresh set of robes from his [Silver Hairpin], reduced his old clothes to shreds with a blade's edge, then strode confidently out of the cave.  

He knew he was ready for whatever new challenges lay ahead.  

Summoning his flight technique, Han Yue sped toward the ruins of Flesh Rend Bazaar.  

A streak of light traversed a thousand miles in an instant.  

Han Yue arrived at the devastated site.  

No living demonic beasts remained—only their scattered bones and carcasses.  

Many bore fatal wounds from sword energy, unmistakably the work of Green Lotus swordsmen.  

Survivors were already busy with cleanup efforts—some butchering demon carcasses, others burying fallen cultivators.  

Most, however, were scavenging through the rubble for valuables.  

Beneath the ruins lay considerable wealth, and fully excavating it would take time.  

Han Yue reached the former site of Courtyard Nine.  

Fang Yi and Xiao Liu were rummaging through the debris.  

Spotting Han Yue, Fang Yi didn't ask for help—instead, she pointed him toward the Green Lotus Sword Sect's temporary camp.  

There, Han Yue found Yang Fan lying on a bed-like artifact, conversing with a silver-haired middle-aged cultivator.  

Seeing Han Yue, Yang Fan struggled upright and introduced him:  

"Uncle, this is Han Yue, the one who struck the final blow against the Great Ape and saved my life."  

"Brother Han, this is Tu Sheng, Hallmaster of Green Lotus Sword Sect's Guardian Hall."  

Tu Sheng nodded. "Thanks to Brother Han's intervention, my junior survived. The Green Lotus Sword Sect owes you a debt."  

Han Yue replied, "You honor me, Elder Tu. As a member of Flesh Rend Bazaar, I acted both from inspiration by Brother Yang and for my own peace of mind."  

Their exchange was brief. Despite being a third-order elder of a major sect, Tu Sheng was remarkably approachable.  

After a while, Tu Sheng stood. "Yang Fan, rest and speak with Brother Han. We must depart now."  

Yang Fan said regretfully, "If not for these injuries, I'd join you to slaughter some beasts in retaliation!"  

Han Yue asked, "Where is Elder Tu heading?"  

Tu Sheng's expression turned icy.  

"The demon prince attacked without cause, destroyed our city, slaughtered ten thousand cultivators."  

"As guardians of this land, the Green Lotus Sword Sect must deliver equal retribution."
