# Chapter 20: First Glimpse

A black-boned chicken with its innards removed lay before Zhou Qing, surrounded by twenty types of medicinal herbs: astragalus, angelica, salvia miltiorrhiza, ginseng, white peony root, raw rehmannia, processed rehmannia, vinegar-processed cyperus rotundus, chuanxiong rhizome, licorice, deer antler, and others. 

Purchasing these ingredients had cost him a small fortune. Had it not been for the income from his Five Fragrance Pills, Zhou Qing wouldn't have considered making the Great and Small Black Chicken Pills—commonly known as Black Chicken Pills—which required so many ingredients.

This formula originated from the *Compendium for Women's Disorders*. One of its variations bore the famous name "Black Chicken and White Phoenix Pills." Among traditional Chinese medicines, Black Chicken Pills were rare in that they actually worked. They weren't just beneficial for women—men could also benefit from their nourishing effects.

During his modern studies, Zhou Qing had known a friend who... After taking Black Chicken Pills for some time, there had been noticeable improvement. Having read the *Compendium for Women's Disorders*, Zhou Qing naturally recalled this. At the very least, the formula must have some merit, or it wouldn't have been passed down through generations. His gaze fell on the fresh black-boned chicken. Even if the pills failed, it would still make for a fine meal.

The rooster, Morning Sun, stared at the black-boned chicken with confusion. Did it have such a dark-feathered relative? Even its bones were black. Then, an instinctive fear and revulsion gradually welled up within it. Snakes didn't faze it, but this black-boned chicken made it instinctively retreat until its back pressed against the wall, where it finally felt somewhat secure. Its beady eyes turned to Zhou Qing, as if marveling at the Tiger King's fearlessness toward such a ghastly creature—clearly planning to make a meal of it. A sense of reverence for Zhou Qing arose in the rooster's heart.

Zhou Qing calmed his mind and meticulously recalled the Black Chicken Pill formula from the *Compendium for Women's Disorders*. The preparation of each ingredient, the sequence of addition, the precise measurements... all surfaced in his mind through arcane and cryptic descriptions. Had he not been trained in this field, he wouldn't have understood the formula at all. Deciphering such texts was part of classical Chinese studies.

Since ancient times, those who couldn't become great statesmen often became great physicians. Scholars and doctors were closely linked—while doctors healed the body, scholars claimed to heal the world. Regardless of their true intentions, that was the official stance.

Zhou Qing had long memorized and fully understood the formula. Now, he was merely reviewing it before putting it into practice.

Light the stove, start the fire!

A long while later, Zhou Qing frowned at the blackened, sticky mass in the pot. 

A failure? 

The sight before him left no room for denial. He dipped a finger into the charred concoction and tasted it.

"Ugh!" 

The flavor was unbearable. He glanced at Morning Sun, who was now pecking at the ground, pretending to search for worms or dig up earthworms. Its head remained firmly lowered, refusing to look up. It hadn't even glimpsed the Tiger King's shadow and had no idea what that blackened mess was. Head still down, it inched along the wall, putting distance between itself and the Tiger King.

Zhou Qing shook his head ruefully. Cannibalism—even among chickens—wasn't right, so he abandoned the thought of feeding the failed pills to Morning Sun. What a waste. His heart ached at the loss.

He reviewed every step of the process. Where had he gone wrong? How should he control the heat?

Failure was the mother of success. Zhou Qing methodically continued refining the Black Chicken Pills. Batch after batch failed, though none turned out as disastrously as the first. The resulting pastes simply didn't match the dark-red hue described in the formula. Each failure taught him something new.

Finally, one batch produced the desired paste. The next step was shaping it into pills. He had bought molds specifically for this purpose, which could later be used for Five Fragrance Pills as well.

When the first Black Chicken Pill was successfully made, Zhou Qing's heart stirred. He checked his Life Nurturing Scripture:

**Five Animals Exercise (Proficient): Tiger (Mastery), Deer (Skilled), Bear (Proficient), Bird (Proficient), Monkey (Proficient).**  
**Martial Skills: Black Tiger's Heart Pluck (Mastery); Finger Flick Skill (Skilled).**  
**Basic Alchemy (Novice).**  
**Literary Courage (Initial Stage).**  
**Remaining Lifespan: 35 years.**

A strange mix of surprise and delight crossed Zhou Qing's face. The Life Nurturing Scripture had unexpectedly registered "Basic Alchemy (Novice)." Had he just stumbled into alchemy?

"Alchemist? Immortal cultivator? Sorcerer? Taoist priest?" 

Terms related to alchemy flooded his mind—all tied to the pursuit of immortality. Following that accidental soul projection, Zhou Qing had once again brushed against the veil of the supernatural...

The Life Nurturing Scripture's feedback confirmed one thing: the Black Chicken Pills genuinely aided his cultivation. But why hadn't this happened when he made Five Fragrance Pills?

"Five Fragrance Pills don't enhance physical constitution or nourish the body," Zhou Qing quickly reasoned. Alchemy was connected to cultivation.

But since both involved pill-making, could their techniques overlap? Would making Five Fragrance Pills help improve his alchemy? That remained to be seen.

Regardless, Zhou Qing was certain of one thing: Black Chicken Pills were effective. Otherwise, the Life Nurturing Scripture wouldn't have registered alchemy.

**Basic Alchemy (Novice).**  

Once a skill appeared, it could be improved. For Zhou Qing, the hardest part was always the beginning—going from nothing to something.

After shaping the pills, they needed to dry. Zhou Qing sampled some of the failed batches. Even without the Life Nurturing Scripture's feedback, he could tell they were inferior.

He hesitated, then dumped the failed paste onto the exposed roots of the large mulberry tree in his courtyard. 

"Brother Mulberry, I've enjoyed your shade and practiced under you. Today, I offer you a feast." Zhou Qing felt slightly guilty—the ingredients were expensive, and it seemed a waste not to use them. Feeding them to others was risky; better to let the tree benefit.

The black paste blended seamlessly with the tree's dark roots. With this matter settled, Zhou Qing, exhausted, retired to rest.

Soon, an evening breeze stirred the mulberry's leaves. Morning Sun emerged from the shadows, clucking as if gloating. A cold gust sent it scurrying back to the wall. The tree's leaves rustled violently as the black paste rapidly dissolved into its roots. The marks Zhou Qing had left on its bark with his Finger Flick Skill slowly faded away.

...

"Who first awakens from the great dream? In this life, only I know."

At dawn, Zhou Qing stretched and began his morning exercises. A knock came at the door—Butcher Hu, carrying a large sack.

"Young Master Zhou, here's the first batch of Five Fragrance Powder. Please check it."

Making Five Fragrance Pills wasn't overly complicated. Zhou Qing had entrusted Miss Lin with preparing the powder, while he handled the final steps: mixing it with honey in precise proportions, following specific techniques and timings. This process shared similarities with making Black Chicken Pills.

After the handover, Butcher Hu tactfully excused himself. Zhou Qing controlled the crucial step of the Five Fragrance Pills' production, and Butcher Hu knew better than to pry. Such secrets were typically passed down strictly within families—never to outsiders. Even among friends, trespassing on such knowledge could breed enmity.

Zhou Qing saw him off, understanding his caution. He didn't consider the Five Fragrance Pills' secret unsharable—the Lin family could eventually reverse-engineer it with enough time. But not now. The temptation was too great, and Butcher Hu's departure was wise. Zhou Qing firmly believed human nature couldn't withstand such tests.

Butcher Hu was his ally now. "Trust those you employ, and employ those you trust." Testing him would only breed resentment, damaging their relationship irreparably. Once trust eroded, rebuilding it was far harder than starting anew.

In college, a friend's partner had constantly tested his love, asking, "Do you really love me?" The eventual answer, of course, was "no." Love had withered under endless scrutiny, yet the partner blamed him for changing. This taught Zhou Qing that love must withstand tests—but lovers shouldn't test it. To test love was to doubt it, and doubt destroyed it.

"Casually, the old heart changes, yet we say the old heart is fickle."

A wave of melancholy washed over Zhou Qing, stronger than before. Memories of his past life surfaced. He fetched brush, ink, and paper, channeling his emotions into the ink-laden brush.

**Magnolia Flower: An Ancient Farewell**  
*If life were but a moment's glance,*  
*Why grieve the painted fan in autumn's dance?*  
*The old heart changes without a care,*  
*Yet we blame the heart for being unfair.*  

*On Li Mountain, vows were sworn at night,*  
*Yet no regret follows the rain's sad light.*  
*How unlike the heartless lord in gold,*  
*Who forgot the love he once foretold.*

The words flowed effortlessly, each character brimming with vitality. Zhou Qing felt both drained and strangely unburdened, as if releasing pent-up emotions. He checked the Life Nurturing Scripture again.

The **Literary Courage (Initial Stage)** entry shimmered with faint mist, dispersing like the warmth from his exercises—except this mist spread through his mind instead of his limbs. A euphoric lightness filled him, reminiscent of his soul projection. Fearful of repeating that ordeal, he forcibly grounded himself.

His surroundings seemed more vivid than ever. The mulberry tree swayed in the breeze, and Zhou Qing sensed... reverence emanating from it.

"Men are not grass and trees; who can be without emotion?" 

This saying now felt incomplete. The mulberry tree's emotions defied conventional wisdom. It wasn't mere plant sensitivity—there was an ineffable spirituality within its awe. 

The haunted house incident must have involved this tree. And his rooster was no ordinary bird either. As for himself—well, he was a transmigrator, a walking anomaly. Since none of them were normal, their coexistence worked just fine.

Zhou Qing's senses sharpened further. That wisp of mist had nourished his soul. He proceeded to mix and mold the Five Fragrance Pills, his movements growing smoother with each attempt. Though his alchemy skill didn't level up, he could feel his proficiency increasing. 

**Basic Alchemy (Novice).**  

The first foundation of a nine-story tower. With clear goals and tangible progress, human potential flourished. Like in games, knowing effort yielded rewards was life's greatest joy. This positive feedback was intoxicating.

After spending the day making pills, Zhou Qing left them to dry. Morning Sun, duly warned, wouldn't touch them—it was the courtyard's guardian, after all. 

Changing clothes, Zhou Qing set off to visit Blacksmith Hu in Hu Village.

...

At the smithy, Zhou Qing noticed several strangers leaving—unusual for the village, especially the towering figure among them. Entering, he found Blacksmith Hu alone.

"Young Master, what brings you here?" 

Zhou Qing didn't ask about the visitors. "I need iron pellets made, about this size." He produced a practice stone.

Blacksmith Hu weighed it. "Is it urgent?"

"The sooner, the better." 

Zhou Qing's unease grew, thinking of the strangers. 

"Done. I'll deliver them tomorrow." 

Nodding, Zhou Qing left. At a distance, he glanced back. The setting sun bathed the smithy in blood-red light. A foreboding gripped him—was Blacksmith Hu in danger? Had enemies come for him? 

Quickening his pace home, Zhou Qing instinctively grasped the Deer Exercise's deeper meaning: to evade peril with grace.
