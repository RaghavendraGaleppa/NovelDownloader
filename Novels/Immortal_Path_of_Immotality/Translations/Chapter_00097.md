# Chapter 97: The Competition of Offering Treasures

"The East Sea Grand Ceremony officially begins now!"

With the master of ceremonies' announcement, the entire venue erupted in excitement.

Since everyone had come, they naturally wanted to show their respect to Master Tortoise and put on a proper display of support. However, Thunder Rain and the two Lin brothers sitting in the back showed little interest in joining the fanfare.

Drums and gongs resounded across the venue as banners fluttered in the wind. Around Turtle Fishing Island, countless water pillars shot into the sky, bursting into colorful sprays—a spectacle created by the island's cultivators using formation arrays to celebrate with artificial aquatic fireworks.

Amid the joyous atmosphere, the first major event of the ceremony commenced.

"The Treasure Offering Ceremony begins now!"

Rows of young women carried trays covered with red silk, while scribes and accountants nearby began meticulously recording each gift.

Cultivators from both sides of the seating area came forward one by one to offer their birthday congratulations. Disciples announcing the gifts proudly displayed the wealth and strength of their respective elders.

"Master Kui, Island Lord of Liaoyuan Island in the East Sea, presents a pair of thousand-year fire corals, wishing Master Tortoise eternal radiance like the sun and moon!"

"Elder Yan, Grand Elder of the Huiji Sect in the East Sea, offers a demon core from a Golden Core-stage beast, wishing Master Tortoise longevity like the pine and crane!"

"Fairy Xiao, Guardian of the Linyu Pavilion in the South Sea, presents a pair of mermaid tears, wishing Master Tortoise everlasting familial bliss!"

"Old Man Suichang of the Jinchuan Market in Jiangdong offers a wisp of Qianqing Cloud Essence, wishing Master Tortoise boundless fortune and longevity!"

...

The first to present their gifts were all Golden Core-stage cultivators, with treasures befitting their status. The disciples announcing the gifts stood tall, subtly competing in prestige.

Master Tortoise on the stage nodded graciously, exchanging pleasantries with each guest and thanking the Golden Core cultivators beside him for their generosity.

The crowd naturally waved off his thanks, insisting it was only proper.

Soon, another group of well-wishers took their turn according to their seating.

"The Liu Family, a cultivation clan of the East Sea, offers a Lingyuan Otter Pearl, wishing the venerable ancestor eternal brilliance!"

"The master of Yuyan Sea Market in the East Sea presents ten high-grade magical artifacts, wishing the ancestor robust health and good fortune!"

"The sect master of the Little Shark Sect offers ten dragon-spined demon fish, wishing the ancestor everlasting vitality!"

"Jade Hermit, a rogue cultivator of the East Sea, presents a jar of Blue Tangerine Spirit Insects, wishing the ancestor enduring prosperity!"

"Bear Mountain Lord, leader of the East Sea water bandits, offers ten tiger-whisker sea cucumber stalks, wishing the ancestor... colorful banners fluttering!"

...

Next came representatives from various smaller factions—sect leaders, family heads, and other prominent figures—all speaking with utmost reverence, hoping to gain Master Tortoise's favor.

Even the leader of water bandits had come, knowing that bloodshed was forbidden during the birthday celebration, making it safe to curry favor.

On the high platform, Master Tortoise sipped tea as he observed the respectful crowd below. Though the gifts varied wildly, each carried sincere intentions, and he smiled warmly, offering words of encouragement to each.

However, his expression darkened slightly when someone presented tiger-whisker stalks and wished him "colorful banners fluttering," as if touching on a sore subject. Still, he suppressed his displeasure and responded neutrally.

Batch after batch of guests came forward. This grand ceremony had invited nearly a fifth of the East Sea's cultivation world, with over a dozen Golden Core cultivators and hundreds of Foundation Establishment-stage practitioners in attendance—an unprecedented scale of magnificence.

Watching the parade of rare treasures, Lin Shan, sitting in the back, couldn't help but feel envious.

Master Tortoise merely stayed on Turtle Fishing Island, doing nothing, yet countless East Sea cultivators flocked to him, offering their wealth just to earn his smile.

How much treasure must he amass from a single birthday celebration? Hosting such an event every twenty years—just how wealthy had he become?

Lin Shan began fantasizing about the future. If he ever attained such prestige and power, commanding the entire world to gather ancient essence for him, wouldn't that be bliss?

Turning his head, he noticed his clansman Lin Fan also wore a covetous expression, clearly daydreaming about Master Tortoise's fortune. However, Lin Fan's senior sister, Thunder Rain, seemed troubled.

Noticing her unease, Lin Fan asked with concern, "Senior Sister, is something wrong? Are you unwell?"

Thunder Rain frowned, watching as row after row of guests presented their gifts. Their turn was approaching, and she stamped her foot anxiously.

"This is my first time attending such an event in the East Sea. Who knew there was a gift-giving custom? I don't have anything worthy to offer. If I embarrass the Purple Cloud Sect, what should I do?"

It wasn't that she lacked valuable items—the pair of indigo-purple spirit swords on her back were clearly extraordinary. But cultivators couldn't very well part with their primary weapons. She simply hadn't prepared a suitable gift in advance.

Losing face was one thing, but if her offering appeared shoddy and tarnished the Purple Cloud Sect's reputation, she would surely face reprimands from her elders upon returning.

Lin Shan listened silently. He himself was dirt-poor, his most valuable possession being the 128 points of ancient essence—his foundation for future advancement. There was no way he could offer anything.

Besides, he was just a rogue cultivator tagging along with Thunder Rain and Lin Fan for the feast. If he had no treasure to give, so be it. Losing face didn't matter—no one would care about a mere Qi Condensation-stage nobody.

At that moment, Lin Fan confidently stepped forward, patting Thunder Rain's shoulder.

When it came to spare treasures, his storage pouch was overflowing!

"Senior Sister, don't worry. Leave this to me—I guarantee you'll be satisfied. Even our elders back at the sect would be delighted!"

Thunder Rain eyed him skeptically, fearing he might cause some absurd scene at the grand ceremony.

While Master Tortoise wouldn't dare trouble them due to the Purple Cloud Sect's influence, any embarrassment would still reflect poorly on their sect.

Lin Shan, however, knew Lin Fan well. The young man had an endless supply of treasures, richer than most Golden Core cultivators—though still far from Master Tortoise's legendary wealth.

As the previous group of gift-givers returned to their seats, Lin Fan strode confidently down the central aisle.

"Thunder Rain and Lin Fan, True Disciples of the Purple Cloud Sect, present a strand of Amethyst Silver Stone Bracelets, wishing Master Tortoise overflowing celebration and crane-like longevity!"

The moment "Purple Cloud Sect" was mentioned, the entire assembly turned to look.

As one of the three great orthodox sects of the Great Song's heartlands, its true disciples were undoubtedly prodigies—future pillars of the righteous path. This was an excellent opportunity to forge connections.

Many female cultivators in the crowd gazed at Lin Fan with newfound admiration.
