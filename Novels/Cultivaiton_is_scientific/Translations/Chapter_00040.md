# Chapter 40: Burning  

Li Shimin, enhanced by the 'Primary Lightness Talisman,' darted swiftly between rocks along the mountain path. This route was the last remaining option analyzed by the massive IBM z15 server.  

Had he been capable of leaping off cliffs of unknown heights unscathed, he would have had many more choices. But he was merely a novice at the second level of Qi Refinement, still far from mastering the application of spiritual energy. Jumping from heights exceeding a hundred meters was beyond his ability.  

Outwardly, he didn’t appear to be fleeing in panic—only because he could detect ambushes ahead each time. Sometimes, it was the restlessness of small animals that alerted him; other times, it was an inconspicuous mark on the ground.  

Li Shimin halted again. Fifty meters ahead, he noticed a small pebble displaced from its original position, revealing a faint damp patch. This indicated someone had been there not long ago. His gaze swept the surroundings.  

Most cultivators attending this market were at the early stages of Qi Refinement. To some extent, they couldn’t move without leaving traces—subtle, but present.  

Anger simmered within him. He hadn’t expected the world of cultivation to be so treacherous. Merely revealing a bit of wealth had drawn the attention of countless cultivators.  

This was supposed to be one of the safer markets, as recommended by Gu Jia. Yet, it only highlighted how perilous the cultivation world truly was.  

In truth, Gu Jia genuinely believed this market was secure. Its safety stemmed partly from the collective adherence to rules—no violence within the market—and partly from the reputation of the Tianhai Sect’s central outpost.  

As a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, Gu Jia commanded respect in the market, with others bending over backward to curry favor. Had Li Shimin invoked Gu Jia’s name, few would have dared to attack him so brazenly.  

Li Shimin pinpointed the ambushers’ hiding spot. As his gaze settled on a large tree, two cultivators stepped out from behind it.  

Both wore identical robes and had unremarkable features, but their eyes were sharp and piercing. Realizing their cover was blown, they abandoned stealth and confronted him directly.  

Ambush or not, it made little difference. Li Shimin was too weak—a mere second-level Qi Refinement cultivator against a third-level and a fourth-level opponent. His odds of survival were negligible.  

"Hand over your storage bag, and we’ll let you leave," the fourth-level cultivator said coldly. Despite the sixty-meter distance between them, his voice carried clearly to Li Shimin’s ears.  

---  

Surrendering the storage bag was out of the question. Though it held little of value—most of his treasures were stashed in his machine room space—Li Shimin knew these cultivators wouldn’t spare him regardless.  

He quickly assessed his chances in a fight. Realistically, his odds of winning were less than one percent. His only assets were two 'Primary Earth Armor Talismans,' five 'Primary Fireball Talismans,' and five 'Primary Ice Arrow Talismans.'  

While these talismans were standard offensive tools for early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, his opponents' spiritual energy far surpassed his. The aura of the fourth-level cultivator alone sent a chill down his spine.  

At sixty meters, the pressure was already immense. Any closer, and he might not even be able to stand his ground.  

Li Shimin’s consciousness slipped into his machine room space, retrieving a 'thermite grenade' from a crate.  

The two cultivators advanced slowly, talismans for speed enhancement at the ready. Once within range, they’d activate them, ensuring Li Shimin couldn’t escape.  

They had no intention of letting him flee. Though other paths were likely blocked by fellow cultivators, if someone else killed Li Shimin, the spoils wouldn’t be theirs.  

Rumors painted Li Shimin as a greenhorn. The two sought to distract him with words, aiming for a swift kill.  

Li Shimin gripped the thermite grenade, bending his arms back with the force of his waist, channeling spiritual energy into his limbs. This crude application of spiritual energy amplified his strength severalfold.  

His throwing motion—posture and force transfer—was optimized using sports science research from the IBM z15’s database. His body became a trebuchet, his arm the throwing arm.  

"Die!" Li Shimin hurled the grenade with a shout.  

The moment it left his hand, his consciousness re-entered the machine room space, retrieving a large, pliable sheet made of 'Starlite' to shield himself.  

The two cultivators saw the grenade flying toward them—devoid of any spiritual energy. To them, such an object posed no threat.  

The fourth-level cultivator casually flicked a strand of spiritual energy to shatter it midair.  

---  

Li Shimin’s thermite grenade had two detonation modes: timed, activated via his consciousness in the machine room, or impact-triggered due to its inherent instability.  

The grenade contained volatile chemicals that generated intense heat upon any disturbance.  

Thus, the moment the cultivator’s spiritual energy struck it, the grenade exploded.  

The blast wasn’t deafening, but its true horror lay in the flames.  

This was an incendiary device, designed to unleash hellfire.  

With a *boom*, a fireball erupted, engulfing a forty-meter radius.  

Before the sound even reached them, the blinding flash from the explosion seared the cultivators’ eyes. Though they could recover quickly with a surge of spiritual energy, the flames gave them no time.  

The thermite burned at nearly 3,000 degrees Celsius.  

Blinded, the cultivators scrambled backward, fumbling to swap their speed talismans for defensive ones.  

But the flames were faster.  

Their screams lasted only two seconds before silence fell.  

The fire dissipated just as quickly, leaving behind acrid white smoke.
