# Chapter 180: Clearing the Divine Temple

In many people's perception, those who cultivated Heavenly Radiance Energy to the Blazing Sun level, merging their consciousness for spirit roaming, must have a significant background. Because, this was not their domain; people on the Path of Rebirth normally couldn't spirit roam at all!

Even the elder riding the four-tusked white elephant showed surprise, repeatedly staring at Qin Ming's back. The silver-haired girl had a graceful figure, her steps rippling with layers of divine halos. She also watched closely, quite surprised.

Although many people were stunned, they all shook their heads after recovering. "Even if a Young Ancestor were to arrive in person, it would most likely not work. Entering like this is just seeking death."

"Yes, no one has ever walked out of the Divine Temple alive."

A group of people had serious expressions. It was rare for an extraordinary figure to challenge the temple, but their end would likely not be good either. Because the master of this place was too terrifying. A great figure once personally commented that this place could be called a dead zone, a temple of no return where death is certain.

Qin Ming entered the temple. The ground was covered in withered branches and fallen leaves, as if no one had visited for countless years. This was not some ethereal place constructed by spirits. This was a true ancient structure, full of historical age. An old, decaying aura assailed him, yet it still stood. Whenever the night fog surged, it would descend upon this land.

As Qin Ming arrived, golden light gushed from the ground, filling the courtyard. Even the withered leaves and the broken windows creaking in the night wind were dyed with golden radiance. All the carvings on the surrounding courtyard walls became translucent—were they gods, or demons? All were glowing, some soaring to the heavens, some descending to hell, their expressions varied, some joyful, some ferocious, all emitting grand sounds. It was as if a large group of ghosts and gods were chanting scriptures to Qin Ming, dense symbols blooming from the surrounding courtyard walls and flying towards him.

"Is the master of this place weighing me up now?" Qin Ming paused.

Immediately, he saw that the gods and demons, their expressions becoming more vivid and lifelike, as if they had all come alive, wanting to step out of the walls. The scriptures they chanted also became tangible. The symbols from their mouths formed golden chains, expanding from the courtyard walls and coiling towards Qin Ming.

In the distance, the large crowd that had followed gathered, all gazing intently. Some knew what was happening and couldn't help but sigh, "This is quite a high-level welcome. As soon as you enter, you're pulled into the God-locking Diagram to discuss the Dao with them." Many had heard of it; some called that wall the Gods' Dao Discussion Diagram, others called it the Demons Descending Upon the World Diagram. Those locked into the wall either succeeded in their Dao discussion and eventually broke free from the diagram, or their primary consciousness would be burned to ashes by the golden chains in an instant.

"Little Wu, this person you know is a bit reckless," the three-eyed youth shook his head and said. Because he had already seen Qin Ming approaching the wall. Was there no strength to struggle? Everyone else was also surprised. Wasn't this a Young Ancestor? A bit 'weak,' weren't they?

An elder spoke, "This place tests things largely unrelated to cultivation level, mostly talent, insight, and the path-forging domain. It heavily relies on innate endowment. This place favors beings who can overcome obstacles in the future. What of a Young Ancestor? He's probably so old he's about to kick the bucket in reality. Even if his Heavenly Radiance Energy has been cultivated to the level of a terrifying great sun, he still won't stand a chance here."

"Hm?!" Suddenly, people noticed something unusual. That tall and straight figure did not disappear into the wall but was slowly moving, observing one luminous, lifelike carving after another. The figures on the wall were dimming, retreating, and dissipating.

After Qin Ming approached, he carefully observed the carvings. The chains within the wall did not touch him; they were blocked by the sun-like light emanating from his body, and were instead burned in reverse, causing all divine chains to snap.

"Why no Dao discussion? Why did all those carvings vanish?" Someone in the distance exclaimed. Many were astonished. He hadn't even entered the wall; instead, he had burned away the figures on the carvings?

A top-tier exotic creature—a Golden-Winged Roc—exuded intense light and said, "If you are powerful, the phenomena around you will speak for you and debate the scriptures on your behalf." Many felt a chill in their hearts upon seeing it. This old Roc had a great background; it was highly likely a true Golden-Winged Roc in reality. Some even speculated that it was probably the ancient Roc from the Heavenly Roc Dao Field in Kunling Giant City, whose renown was immense and known throughout the ten directions.

An elder dressed in a feather robe nodded, saying, "Fellow Daoist is right. The profound meaning contained in his Heavenly Radiance Energy is probably exceedingly extraordinary, already speaking for him and debating the scriptures on his behalf." People realized that the temple challenger must have cultivated a special Heavenly Radiance Energy, which was beneficial for path-forging, and that this place evaluated one's talent and innate endowment.

"How surprising! I thought an old fellow with one foot in the grave, no matter how profound his cultivation, wouldn't have any new profound teachings to display. Yet he's so formidable."

The elder riding the four-tusked white elephant spoke, "Who said it must be a Young Ancestor whose lifespan is exhausted? What if it's a young newcomer? This might be closer to the truth." Many people didn't believe him. Because the Path of Rebirth heavily depended on age; truly, the older, the more powerful. It required time to refine oneself. How could a lesser-known old fellow manage to spirit roam with Heavenly Radiance Energy?

The young man with a golden horn on his head said, "Hm, we'll just wait and see. As long as he's a newcomer, the later stages will probably be difficult to pass, because this path itself has reached its end and is hard to expand further."

Qin Ming walked around the courtyard walls once. Ghosts and gods retreated, and all the patterns vanished. He tentatively sensed the lingering emotions of the place, and as a result, heard deafening roars. That was the sound of the entire Divine Temple. All the ancient buildings were connected as one, like majestic bells vibrating, aiming to shatter the night mist. Qin Ming immediately stopped, not daring to continue. This temple was like a massive 'living entity'!

He walked into the second courtyard. Blue bricks were cracked, weeds grew in the crevices, and a few old trees swayed in the night wind, their yellow leaves falling. It was a scene of complete desolation. As he arrived, a half-human-height incense burner in the courtyard lit up, and the entire courtyard began to glow. Inside the bronze incense burner, three thick sticks of incense were inserted, burning like torches, their smoke rising straight to the clouds. A large amount of incense ash had accumulated in the bronze burner, and now it actually floated up, filling the entire courtyard, splitting into countless particles of ash.

"There really is an afterlife, haha! I've been reborn with innate wisdom from my past life. In this life, I shall become someone close to an immortal!" a black shadow in one particle of ash joyfully exclaimed.

"Unimaginable! After my death, I actually arrived in a brand new world, advancing triumphantly. I am about to become a god!" In another particle of ash, an elderly black shadow with a dignified and solemn appearance smiled.

"To think, my previous life was wasted in futility, yet here I have gained a chance to start anew! Becoming an immortal or an ancestor is no longer a dream!" In yet another particle of ash, a frenzied youth roared.

Qin Ming sighed. Were all these ashes in the incense burner, these countless black shadows, the lingering obsessions of the deceased?

An old man's face emerged from one of the incense sticks and said, "Heaven and Earth are the furnace, and all living beings are but ashes. Do you think yourself special? First, take a trip into the furnace, break through ten realms, and then emerge."

These words were too grand. What was this talk of breaking through ten realms?

Soon, Qin Ming understood. The old man's face had matched him with ten very brilliant and special particles of ash, each containing a departed soul.

"Hm, it's an Outer Realm Demonic Fiend! How dare you invade our realm?!" a white-robed youth shouted.

As Qin Ming approached a particle of dust, he saw an immortal sword slash down, tearing through the sky of the ash world. He was startled. Could such a sword be blocked? In an instant, he discovered that his own golden radiance illuminated all things, dispersing the sword light. The opponent's immortal sword was not as powerful as he had imagined.

"Who am I, where am I? I... had a great dream?" The white-robed youth opposite him had a complex expression, as if he had just woken up from this particle of ash. Then, he spoke, "I am a Pure Land disciple, who died in the Divine Temple. Now my consciousness has recovered, let us discuss the Dao."

Before long, a great sun hung in the sky here, consciousness and spiritual light intertwined, fiercely colliding. Then, this particle of ash world dissipated, and the white-robed youth showed a relieved smile, cupped his fists at Qin Ming, and completely vanished.

Next, Qin Ming, the Outer Realm Demonic Fiend, successively broke through nine more realms. His expression was solemn. Those who died in the Divine Temple were all extraordinarily remarkable. The ten Dao discussions, from Pure Land disciples to exotic creatures, then to giant beasts, and even formless monsters, and strange plants, all made him expend considerable effort. He didn't know that these were the cream of the crop from the incense burner, specially selected by the master of this place for their exceptionally high innate talent.

"So fast! He has passed through the second courtyard!" In the strange small town, many people floated into the air, gazing towards the Divine Temple.

"I am certain he is not a newcomer. He is probably someone from another path who cultivated Heavenly Radiance Energy; that's just an early-stage protective Dao method." Some people found it unbelievable that a newcomer could break through two stages so rapidly.

Qin Ming entered the third courtyard and saw a green ox sitting under a ginkgo tree. Golden-yellow leaves drifted down from the tree. The old ox patted the empty ground in front of it and said, "Come, let's discuss the Dao."

After Qin Ming sat down, the old ox began to moo incessantly, making it impossible to understand.

"Are you deliberately making things difficult for me?" Qin Ming looked at it.

"All things have spirits, the Great Dao is formless. I am performing the Dao, expounding the Law. Do you understand?" the old ox asked.

Qin Ming gently waved his hand, creating a guqin with his Heavenly Radiance Energy, and then began to play. He first played a piece: 'Ascending the Banished Immortal Tower.' Immediately, a scene seemed to emerge: ascending the tower to gaze into the distance, a myriad of miles of great river, fire-red sunset glow, waves rolling golden sand, flood dragons tearing through the sky, soaring into the nine heavens.

The old ox stared, dumbfounded. "What kind of bird music is this? It couldn't understand anything."

"My Dao, do you understand?" Qin Ming smiled.

Then he played another piece: 'Cook Ding Carves an Ox.' This guqin music, imbued with his golden radiance, displayed a scene, revealing his unique Heavenly Radiance Energy. This time, the old ox saw it.

"Moo!" It understood. It sprang to its feet, directly stomping its hooves and revealing its huge horns. Then, it saw a blade, resonating with the melody, clanging loudly as it swiftly plunged into its flesh, beginning to dismember it.

With a whoosh, Qin Ming entered the fourth courtyard…

Subsequently, he was unstoppable, passing a total of eight stages and directly arriving at the courtyard containing the most magnificent main Divine Temple. By this point, people outside could no longer see. Thick fog obscured their vision, but they were all greatly shocked that someone had actually passed eight stages and was directly facing the master of the Divine Temple!

Qin Ming stood in the courtyard, looking into the depths of the enormous, pitch-black hall, feeling a sensation. Suddenly, the ancient structure began to glow, becoming dazzling. All because the walls within the hall were covered in carved words, the characters soaring like dragons, dancing like phoenixes, unrestrained and flamboyant, covering what should have been a solemn and sacred great hall.

Qin Ming immediately confirmed that this must be the scriptures left by that ancient patriarch in the past. He felt a powerful Heavenly Radiance surging there, like a vast ocean, about to burst out of the Divine Temple!

"That old patriarch had immense courage, to actually carve scriptures like this in someone else's most important place!" Qin Ming secretly sighed.

"Come in," someone spoke from within the ancient temple.

Qin Ming approached. Apart from the glowing characters on the walls, other areas were relatively dark, and many places were covered in spiderwebs, accompanied by bloodstains. His expression was solemn. Those spiderwebs… how could they exist in such a place? Soon, he seemed to see a creature as large as a mountain. He quickly shook his head, feeling it was unreal. The creatures that once existed in the dilapidated spiderwebs within the hall were actually as enormous as mountains?

Deepest within the main hall of the Divine Temple, it suddenly became hazy. A small path appeared there, connecting to the extremely distant horizon, leading towards a bright moon, where a graceful figure was slowly approaching.
