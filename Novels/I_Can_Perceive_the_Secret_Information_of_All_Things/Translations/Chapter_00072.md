# Chapter 72: The Iron Gate Sect and Zhao Jiuzhou

After helping Lin Musheng eliminate the assassin Wang Dafeng, the only remaining threat—and the last enemy—for the young master of Lin Family Fort was his third uncle.  

Xiao Ji's promise to assist Lin Musheng in reaching the Foundation Establishment stage within three years wasn't mere lip service—there was a high likelihood of success.  

The two returned to the city, stopping by the market to purchase meat, eggs, and vegetables, which Lin Musheng carried as they made their way back to the temple.  

Upon their return, each busied themselves with their own tasks.  

Xiao Ji had much to do. Reaching the Foundation Establishment stage was only the beginning.  

His first priority was to monitor the headless monk in the desolate mountains outside Luolin Town daily using the zither strings, checking whether the bizarre Foundation Establishment-stage monk had moved from his location.  

The last zither string was in the hands of that headless old monk, and Xiao Ji had long coveted it.  

Now that he had also reached the Foundation Establishment stage, it was time to make plans for his journey to Luolin Town.  

Though Luolin Town was also part of Longxiang Prefecture, it was still some distance from Yangliu Town. However, for Xiao Ji, this was no longer an issue—he could traverse the distance using the Divine Movement Technique, also known as the Earth Shrinking Art.  

Halfway through his journey, he realized that while he had only recently broken through to Foundation Establishment, the headless monk had been at this stage for much longer. A direct confrontation would be difficult.  

After some thought, he settled on a plan.  

He would seek out Zhao Jiuzhou of the Iron Gate Sect and enlist his help.  

Even if Zhao Jiuzhou's cultivation was mediocre, having him there to strike the monk from behind during their confrontation would increase their chances of success.  

Among the sect cultivators he knew in the mortal realm, Zhao Jiuzhou was the only one available. Though his cultivation might be lacking, his presence as support would still be invaluable.  

The Iron Gate Sect wasn't located in Longxiang Prefecture but rather on a mining mountain outside Chaoyang Prefecture.  

After several days of traveling via the Earth Shrinking Art, consuming more than half of his spiritual energy, Xiao Ji finally arrived at his destination.  

The mountain occupied by the Iron Gate Sect wasn't a grand, scenic peak brimming with spiritual energy—just a low, unremarkable mining hill. From the base, one could see the iron cables and wooden scaffolds suspended along its slopes, remnants of mining equipment.  

The area was eerily quiet. No people or carts moved along the road at the mountain's foot, a clear sign of desolation.  

Considering the internal strife that had left the Iron Gate Sect with only Zhao Jiuzhou remaining, the bleakness was understandable.  

The path up the mountain was strewn with fallen leaves and branches, undisturbed by any caretaker, with only the occasional small creature scurrying past.  

"With the sect in such a state, Brother Zhao probably wouldn't stay here," Xiao Ji mused, sensing no signs of life on the mountain.  

At the summit, he found a vast, empty clearing, with all the buildings laid bare before him.  

---  

After a while, Xiao Ji's eyes widened slightly—he had detected something.  

Driven by curiosity, he entered the largest structure of the abandoned Iron Gate Sect: its main hall, the heart of the sect.  

Inside, the hall was in complete disarray, with traces of past battles still visible.  

Most would assume Zhao Jiuzhou had long since left upon seeing the Iron Gate Sect in such a state, but Xiao Ji was different—he had already picked up on Zhao Jiuzhou's traces.  

"Is this how Brother Zhao treats his guests?" Xiao Ji suddenly addressed a plaque hanging on the wall.  

Yet the massive hall was empty—no one was there, not even a decoy.  

After a long silence, the plaque moved and spoke.  

"Who's there? Could you step to the right, please?" The plaque, though immobile, emitted a voice.  

The accent was unmistakably Zhao Jiuzhou's.  

Xiao Ji adjusted the plaque to a higher position, then took two steps back and shifted to the right, straightening his robes. "It's me—Xiao Ji from Yangliu Town, Longxiang Prefecture."  

"Brother Xiao! No wonder the voice sounded familiar," the plaque replied.  

"Is this your latest disguise technique?" Xiao Ji asked knowingly.  

The plaque fell silent for a moment before sighing. "Indeed. Though I must apologize—you'll have to wait a couple of days while I figure out how to revert."  

Disguise techniques always carried risks.  

"Brother Zhao, though I don't fully understand the principles of disguise arts, I suggest you try concentrating your spiritual energy at a single point and force a breakthrough," Xiao Ji advised.  

At first, Zhao Jiuzhou was reluctant. Disguise techniques relied on a combination of artifacts and personal cultivation, requiring the dispersal of spiritual energy across the artifact's framework. Concentrating energy at one point risked destabilizing the artifact—even if he reverted to his original form, the artifact would be damaged.  

But given that he was merely disguised as a plaque, even if the artifact malfunctioned, the backlash wouldn't be severe—just a few months of recovery. And as for the artifact itself, it was expendable.  

Following Xiao Ji's suggestion, he focused his spiritual energy at a central point and successfully broke free.  

After stretching his limbs, Zhao Jiuzhou greeted Xiao Ji sheepishly. "Brother Xiao, I didn't expect your visit today. Look at me—I'm completely unprepared."  

"Indeed. Your Iron Gate Sect may be vast, but there's not even a cup of warm tea to offer," Xiao Ji chuckled. "Weren't you the one who vowed to rebuild the sect? The proclamation was bold, yet the place remains in ruins."  

"What can I do? Burying my fellow disciples in the mines alone took me ages," Zhao Jiuzhou sighed. "Next is the cleanup... But I haven't neglected my training in the meantime. Here, let me show you my progress."  

---  

With that, he led Xiao Ji to another area—a relatively secluded chamber that served as a cultivation room.  

This was the cleanest and most orderly place in the entire Iron Gate Sect, filled with various objects and furnishings, resembling a well-stocked general store.  

"Brother Xiao, look at this chair. At first glance, it's just a chair, but in reality, it's a cage..." Zhao Jiuzhou began demonstrating. "Watch closely—I'm about to sit on it."  

Xiao Ji observed as Zhao Jiuzhou, wearing a mysterious smile, lowered himself onto the seemingly ordinary chair.  

The moment his rear touched the seat, the chair abruptly transformed, expanding rapidly into a cage that trapped him inside.  

"Impressive," Xiao Ji praised.  

Next, Zhao Jiuzhou presented a large teapot.  

"Brother Xiao, this teapot appears to pour water, but in truth, it fires darts," Zhao Jiuzhou explained excitedly, eager to showcase his creations.  

"Quite the surprise," Xiao Ji nodded in approval. "Truly unpredictable."  

After a series of demonstrations, Xiao Ji's interest was piqued.  

Among Zhao Jiuzhou's various disguise techniques, Xiao Ji found the transformation of a hammer into a sword, and then into a spear, the most practical.  

"Brother Zhao, I have an idea," Xiao Ji said seriously. "Could you apply your disguise technique to my sword? I'd like to catch my opponents off guard in battle."  

Zhao Jiuzhou was more than happy to oblige.  

Taking Xiao Ji's sword, he examined it carefully. Though the blade was exceptional, disguise arts weren't concerned with the item's inherent value—after all, they didn't enhance offensive power. The only requirement was the desired form.  

At its core, disguise was an illusion.  

After days of discussion, analysis, and planning between the two...  

Seven days later, Xiao Ji set off on his journey—with a hammer strapped to his back.
