# Chapter 3: Evergreen Art, Hundredfold Harvest

"Hundredfold Critical Hit loading: 100%"

"Hundredfold Critical Hit successfully loaded."

"My golden finger has finally arrived!"

Gazing at the words before him, Qi Chuan smiled faintly.

However, after the loading was complete, the words slowly faded away, and nothing else happened.

"It must be a golden finger that requires personal exploration."

Seeing this, Qi Chuan remained completely unfazed, well aware of the quirks of such abilities.

"This is the Evergreen Art, a copy of a cultivation technique. It is temporarily bestowed upon you. You must return it here in six months, or face punishment."

Meanwhile, in front of Qi Chuan, after some formalities, the main event finally arrived. The Transmission Elder spoke with solemn authority.

As his words fell, a young girl in red stepped forward from behind him, distributing green booklets to the gathered seedlings of immortality.

The girl appeared to be around ten years old, with snow-white skin, a slender figure, and a serene aura.

Unlike these seedlings who had come from the mountains, the young girl seemed to carry an air of celestial grace, leaving many of the seedlings breathless and entranced.

Qi Chuan felt a fragrant breeze pass by his nose as a copy of the Evergreen Art was placed in his hands.

"So this is a cultivation technique? The name sounds quite elegant. I wonder what its actual effects and power are like," Qi Chuan mused inwardly.

As a proper cultivation technique, it was likely extremely abstruse and difficult to comprehend.

Moreover, with his low-grade eighth-rank spiritual root, Qi Chuan was merely curious. He flipped through the pages casually, not expecting to gain any immediate insights.

Unexpectedly, after a quick glance, he suddenly saw a line of text appear in his vision:

[You skimmed through the Evergreen Art in a very cursory manner, attempting to grasp its basics. Triggered Hundredfold Critical Hit, gained a hundredfold harvest. Your understanding of the Evergreen Art has slightly improved.]

Seeing this, Qi Chuan's mind stirred slightly. "Is this... the golden finger activating?"

Simultaneously, a stream of information flowed into his consciousness.

Upon closer inspection, it was a partial understanding of the Evergreen Art.

After absorbing it, Qi Chuan clearly felt that he now had a very rudimentary grasp of the technique.

This was something that a mere casual flip-through could never have achieved—it was the result of the golden finger's critical hit enhancement.

"So this is the effect of the golden finger?"

Qi Chuan carefully examined the new understanding of the Evergreen Art in his mind.

He found that, just as the text had stated, it was indeed a very shallow comprehension.

Because his earlier skimming could hardly even be called reading, even after the hundredfold critical hit, the gains were pitifully small—likely not even a fraction of a full understanding.

Far from achieving any sort of mastery.

This made Qi Chuan feel a twinge of regret.

If only he had read it more carefully earlier.

But there was no helping it now—this was hindsight. Before the first trigger, he had no way of knowing the golden finger's exact effects.

"It seems my golden finger allows me to gain multiplied rewards when I put in effort?"

"I can boldly speculate that it applies to anything—cultivation techniques, comprehension of spells and supernatural abilities, even alchemy, artifacts, talismans, formations, and so on. I'll need to verify this gradually."

"I just wonder if the hundredfold critical hit and harvest will always be maintained?"

Qi Chuan pondered inwardly.

Then, he casually flipped through the Evergreen Art a few more times.

Even if it was still a hundredfold critical hit, since he had already wasted one opportunity, he didn't mind wasting another.

[You skimmed through the Evergreen Art in a very cursory manner, attempting to grasp its basics. Triggered Tenfold Critical Hit, gained a tenfold harvest. Your understanding of the Evergreen Art has slightly improved.]

Once again, text appeared before his eyes.

Another stream of new understanding about the Evergreen Art flowed into his mind.

However, this time, the gains were even smaller than before.

[You skimmed through the Evergreen Art in a very cursory manner, attempting to grasp its basics. Triggered Eightfold Critical Hit, gained an eightfold harvest. Your understanding of the Evergreen Art has slightly improved.]

[You skimmed through the Evergreen Art in a very cursory manner, attempting to grasp its basics. Triggered Twenty-two-fold Critical Hit, gained a twenty-two-fold harvest. Your understanding of the Evergreen Art has slightly improved.]

Qi Chuan experimented a few more times.

Finally, he tentatively concluded that the critical hit harvest was random, with a range between onefold and a hundredfold.

This seemed reasonable.

After all, if it were always a hundredfold or more, it would be far too overpowered—he might as well sit on the throne of the Dao Ancestor of the immortal realm.

Still, even a random critical hit between onefold and a hundredfold was quite impressive.

Even with his low-grade eighth-rank spiritual root, with this kind of assistance, his cultivation progress would be relatively fast.

Moreover, his golden finger seemed to have no cooldown and applied universally.

Even if he died and switched to ghost cultivation, his achievements probably wouldn't be low?

This golden finger was quite open-ended—quite excellent indeed.

Meanwhile, the other seedlings were also flipping through their copies of the Evergreen Art.

However, unlike Qi Chuan, they had no golden finger to assist them, so they gained almost nothing, scratching their heads in frustration.

Ahead, the Transmission Elder continued discussing some aspects of the Evergreen Art, as well as the rules and taboos of the main lineage.

After finishing his lecture, he had the immortal master escort the seedlings out.

Soon, only two people remained in the Transmission Hall.

"Chan'er, what are your thoughts after seeing these seedlings today?" The Transmission Elder stroked his beard and looked at the young girl in red beside him.

The girl, named Qi Chan'er, was the Transmission Elder's granddaughter and possessed truly exceptional cultivation talent.

After a moment of contemplation, she replied in a clear voice, "Grandfather, I think these seedlings have inferior spiritual roots and will struggle to achieve much in the future. They'll likely stagnate at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement, or even fail to break through the early stage."

"However, our Qi Clan has just over a hundred cultivators. Even if the new blood is of poor quality, more is always better."

The Transmission Elder nodded slightly. "Indeed, but you forget that aside from spiritual roots, comprehension and fortune are also crucial in cultivation."

"Among these seedlings, there might be one or two with decent comprehension or fortune, who could reach the late stage of Qi Refinement and eventually become elders of our Qi Clan, making significant contributions."

"Of course, the probability is extremely low."

"As for you, Chan'er..."

At this point, the Transmission Elder fixed his gaze on Qi Chan'er. "You are different from them. With your fourth-rank spiritual root and already at the second level of Qi Refinement at such a young age, your talent is outstanding. As long as you don't perish, reaching the late stage of Qi Refinement is a given."

"But your ambitions should not stop there."

"I've received news that in a few years, the Breeze Moon Sect will open its gates to recruit new disciples."

"Traditionally, they've shown some slight favor to cultivation families like ours, granting a few inner disciple spots. Securing one would give you a tremendous advantage."

"Foundation-building materials, Foundation Establishment Pills... these high-level resources within the sect are only accessible to inner disciples and above."

"The most important thing for our cultivation family isn't how many late-stage Qi Refinement experts we have, but Foundation Establishment cultivators. Just one can protect the family and ensure its continuation for two hundred years. You must aim for this, understand?"

"Chan'er understands. I will cultivate diligently and strive to reach the mid-stage of Qi Refinement before the Breeze Moon Sect opens its gates, to secure an inner disciple spot!"

Qi Chan'er's bright eyes looked out at the vast mountain scenery beyond the hall, her expression resolute.
