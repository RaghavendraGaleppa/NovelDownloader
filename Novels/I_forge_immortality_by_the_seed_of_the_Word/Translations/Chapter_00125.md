# Chapter 123 - Forging Longevity with Dao Seeds  

Countless scorching gazes fell upon Zhang Jing, making his scalp tingle.  

Had these looks come from outer court disciples or senior brothers from the inner court—whom he was already accustomed to—Zhang Jing wouldn’t have minded so much. He might have even ignored them entirely.  

But the problem was...  

These gazes belonged to the deans of the three great Dao Academies and their pavilion masters—all of them Golden Core realm powerhouses.  

Their stares carried an immense weight, making it impossible for Zhang Jing to simply brush them off.  

Just then, a lean figure stepped beside him and gently patted his shoulder, offering words of encouragement in a weathered voice:  

"Zhang Jing, you’ve done well this time."  

"All thanks to the guidance of the Pavilion Master and my senior brothers!" Zhang Jing turned and replied modestly.  

"Hahaha," the bearded Pavilion Master laughed heartily. "You’re being too humble, young man. Achieving perfect comprehension of Dao Intent is entirely due to your own talent and effort. We couldn’t have guided you in that at all."  

As he spoke, the other deans and pavilion masters also chuckled, dissipating the oppressive atmosphere that had made Zhang Jing uncomfortable moments ago.  

Under the guidance of his pavilion master, Zhang Jing was then introduced to the three academy deans and over a dozen pavilion masters. Each greeted him warmly, offering tokens of goodwill and inviting him to visit their respective institutions whenever he had time.  

When he reached the dean of the Divine Thunder Academy, the man smiled amiably and said,  

"Zhang Jing, do visit our Divine Thunder Academy when you have the chance. Perhaps you could offer some guidance to our less accomplished inner court disciples."  

"Indeed, Junior Brother Zhang Jing, you should come by sometime. Junior Sister Qin Nian is quite attentive—she’ll surely take good care of you," Qiu Han added from the side.  

At this, the Dragon Lake Academy dean interjected with feigned annoyance,  

"What are you two playing at? Trying to poach our Dragon Lake’s top disciple already? And resorting to such tactics?"  

Then, turning to Zhang Jing with a grin, he said,  

"Zhang Jing, once you enter the inner court, you’ll see for yourself. Your senior sisters there are all stunning beauties. Besides, could you really bear to leave Junior Sister Qingqing behind?"  

Zhang Jing’s expression twisted into a mix of amusement and exasperation.  

What nonsense was this?  

Did they really think he was that kind of person?  

His gaze shifted to Qiu Han—the instigator of this mess—only to find the senior brother blinking rapidly and gesturing behind him.  

Confused, Zhang Jing turned around.  

There stood a delicate, doll-like young woman staring at him with a complicated expression—admiration mixed with indignation.  

"She’s grasped a trace of Dao Intent? Not bad," Zhang Jing mused. "But why is she looking at me like that? I don’t recall offending her."  

Time passed slowly.  

A streak of light, brimming with terrifying aura, shot out from the Void of Ten Thousand Divines and landed not far from Zhang Jing, materializing into an unremarkable figure in purple robes.  

The previously bustling square fell silent as all eyes shifted from Zhang Jing to You Yuanming.  

A true Golden Dao Foundation cultivator!  

It had been countless years since any of the three great academies had produced one.  

"Golden Dao Foundation...!" someone murmured in awe.  

You Yuanming first greeted the deans and pavilion masters with familiarity before walking straight toward Zhang Jing.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, congratulations on achieving perfect Dao Intent comprehension! The Golden Dao Foundation is within your grasp now."  

His gaze was complex as he spoke, his thoughts churning before ultimately settling on this simple congratulation.  

What else could he say?  

It was now clear that this junior brother’s self-awareness far surpassed his own. Zhang Jing’s insistence on pursuing the path of True Intent had been justified all along.  

As for the carefully prepared speech urging Zhang Jing to switch to the path of Formation Seals—those words now stuck in his throat.  

Even if he wanted to speak them...  

You Yuanming glanced at his academy dean and pavilion master.  

Undoubtedly, these two would be the first to oppose anyone trying to steer Zhang Jing away from his current path.  

On the other side, Zhang Jing smiled sincerely.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother. I must also congratulate you on successfully refining the Golden Dao Foundation within the Void of Ten Thousand Divines."  

"Enough of this mutual admiration between you two," the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master teased, though his grin stretched ear to ear, his pride evident.  

The other pavilion masters glared at him, their eyes practically spitting fire.  

Two hours later, the treasure ships of the Divine Thunder and Mystic Light Academies slowly ascended into the clouds before departing in opposite directions.  

This opening of the Void of Ten Thousand Divines had undoubtedly crowned Dragon Lake Academy as the greatest victor, producing two Golden Dao Foundation cultivators at once—along with a Qi Refining cultivator who had comprehended Dao Intent, a future contender for the True Spirit Ranking.  

The other two academies hadn’t left empty-handed, however. Each had disciples who had grasped Dao Intent, promising future potential.

Atop the crimson treasure ship of the Divine Thunder Academy, Qin Nian stood at the bow, her beautiful eyes fixed thoughtfully on the distant Dragon Lake Academy below.  

"Junior Sister, why are you standing here alone? Thinking about Junior Brother Zhang Jing?"  

A streak of light flashed as Qiu Han appeared beside her, teasing.  

"Don’t worry, the dean and I have already invited him. When he visits our academy, you’ll have your chance to confess your feelings. If you can convince him to stay at Divine Thunder, it’ll be a great merit for you."  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing is extraordinarily talented and close to your age—a perfect match!"  

Qin Nian’s fair cheeks flushed crimson.  

"Senior Brother, must you always be so improper?" she chided, stomping her foot lightly. "Long ago, I vowed to dedicate my life solely to the Great Dao. You know this."  

"What a pity," Qiu Han sighed before asking, "Then what were you looking at just now?"  

"Nothing. I was just thinking... Is Zhang Jing even human? To go from zero to perfect Dao Intent comprehension in just nine months—he’s a monster!"  

"With such a monster existing, doesn’t our cultivation seem laughable in comparison?"  

Her voice trembled slightly, her confidence shaken after witnessing Zhang Jing’s feats in the Void of Ten Thousand Divines.  

Sensing her wavering Dao heart, Qiu Han shook his head wryly, silently blaming Zhang Jing for the trouble.  

After a moment’s thought, he asked,  

"Junior Sister, do you think Zhang Jing’s talent is terrifying?"  

Qin Nian nodded blankly, confused by the obvious question.  

"Then do you know that every time the Upper Realm opens, the Scarlet Crow Tribe produces multiple geniuses like Zhang Jing—some even more monstrous than him?"  

"In terms of talent, Zhang Jing might rank within the top hundred, fifty, or even thirty in the Scarlet Crow Tribe. But what is the Scarlet Crow Tribe compared to the vast Heaven’s Pivot Domain?"  

"Have you heard of those legendary prodigies whom Upper Realm overlords personally descend to escort for cultivation?"  

"Junior Sister, if Zhang Jing’s talent has shaken your Dao heart, how will you face those even more terrifying geniuses when you ascend to the Upper Realm?"  

"Will you still dare to walk the path of immortality?"  

Qiu Han’s words struck Qin Nian like tolling bells, resonating deep within her.  

After a long silence, she bowed slightly.  

"Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother."  

Though her face remained pale, the light in her eyes had reignited.

Back at Dragon Lake Academy, the crowd gradually dispersed, leaving only the dean, the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master, and Zhang Jing.  

The dean smiled warmly.  

"Zhang Jing, with your perfect Dao Intent and tenth-level Qi Refinement, you’ve already met the requirements to pass the Radiant Immortal Wall trial. Since the timing is perfect, why not confirm your status as an inner court disciple today?"  

(Of course, he didn’t voice the other thought on his mind: This would also prevent the Divine Thunder Academy from getting any ideas.)  

"A sound suggestion," the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master agreed, pleased.  

The sooner Zhang Jing’s position in the Thousand Techniques Pavilion was solidified, the better—lest the other pavilion masters start scheming.  

From his observations, those old foxes from the Spirit Dao Pavilion and Heritage Pavilion were still eyeing Zhang Jing greedily!  

Zhang Jing’s heart stirred with excitement as he bowed respectfully.  

"This disciple will follow the arrangements of the dean and Pavilion Master."
