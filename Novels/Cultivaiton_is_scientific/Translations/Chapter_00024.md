# Chapter 24 Harvest

Li Shiming used his consciousness to harvest the spirit rice while meticulously recording the data. 

Though he currently lacked the means to optimize the spirit rice cultivation, that didn't mean he couldn't in the future. Each planting cycle took a month, so every additional data record effectively saved him a month's time.

The average tiller count per plant was 60, with the single-layer cultivation rack yielding approximately 364 catties (about 2.5 dan) of spirit rice per square meter this season. 

Looking at the harvested spirit rice, satisfaction spread across his face. He carefully selected the plumpest, most vibrant grains with his consciousness—these would serve as seeds for the next planting cycle to produce even more spirit rice.

What pleased him more was that even if yields didn't improve further, this amount would be sufficient for his own consumption with plenty to spare. However, the excess spirit rice couldn't be given to ordinary people. While the spiritual energy in the rice was gentle enough for Qi Refinement cultivators, it would be poisonous to mortals—consuming it could cause their bodies to rupture.

To prevent the aroma of spirit rice from spreading, he even cooked it within his machine room space. Using one catty of spirit rice and spiritual rainwater produced by his Spring Breeze Transforms Rain technique, he prepared a pot of spiritual rice.

When he brought the cooked rice out from the space, an indescribable fragrance filled the air as gentle spiritual energy wafted with the steam. He immediately began eating voraciously, worried that prolonged exposure would cause the spiritual energy to dissipate.

Despite having eaten little for nearly a month, he could only consume about a quarter of the rice before feeling completely full. He had overestimated his appetite—one catty of raw rice had produced an entire pot when cooked, and the intense satiety from the spiritual rice quickly made him realize how much he actually needed.

Calculating based on his current appetite after near-starvation, his monthly consumption wouldn't exceed 7.5 catties, likely even less. This meant he could accumulate over 350 catties of surplus spirit rice each month.

"I'll store it for now and see when I can sell some," Li Shiming mused, deciding not to stop cultivation. The spirit rice was currently his only viable trade good for transactions with other cultivators. Though he had no trading partners yet, preparation was essential.

The second planting cycle required far less attention than the first. With complete cultivation data, he only needed periodic checks.

His consciousness entered the machine room space and opened a wooden box in a small reserved area. Inside lay two rows of fist-sized iron objects carefully wrapped in soft cloth—five in each row.

These were Li Shiming's self-defense weapons. The first row contained white phosphorus bombs—extremely hazardous devices that would burn relentlessly upon contact, penetrating flesh down to bone. The second row held thermite bombs, capable of releasing blinding 3000°C flames that could melt steel targets almost instantly.

These represented the most powerful weapons he could currently craft. After studying the defensive capabilities of his white robe artifact, he'd lost interest in making firearms—ordinary guns couldn't penetrate the robe's protection, and stronger firearms were beyond his current means.

The thermite and white phosphorus bombs at least stood a chance against cultivators. As for the small wooden sword artifact, it was practically unusable for him—a single attempt had nearly drained all his spiritual energy without even activating it. The sword's spiritual energy demands were like a bottomless pit, far beyond what his Qi Refinement second layer could handle. Thus, while powerful, the wooden sword was far less practical than his longsword artifact.

Checking the spiritual energy levels in his machine room space, Li Shiming began circulating his "Five Elements Absorption Technique" while drawing out spiritual energy. Strands of energy entered his body as accumulated impurities from the past month were expelled through his pores.

After completing the circulation, he felt his body light and clear again. The expelled impurities were minimal—after barely a month with controlled food intake, there wasn't much foul odor. Still, he had Si Qin prepare a bath for thorough cleansing. His white robe artifact remained spotless, requiring no washing.

"Shiming, the official ship docks tomorrow. I won't see you off," Li Wenyuan said solemnly in his study. All preparations had been made, all arrangements settled—the fledgling had to leave the nest eventually.

"Father, I've left some tea in the storeroom. Please take care of yourself after I'm gone," Li Shiming replied, bowing his head. He had a feeling this departure from Nanling Prefecture might be long.

Though claiming to travel for the imperial examinations, his true purpose was seeking the immortal path—an uncertain endeavor he chose not to disclose unless successful. Despite limited spiritual energy, he'd used the Spring Breeze Transforms Rain technique multiple times to produce tea leaves infused with faint spiritual energy.

"Shiming, you've grown up and have your secrets. I won't pry, but remember—stay safe. A wise man doesn't stand beneath crumbling walls," Li Wenyuan said after a pause, choosing not to question further. 

Having tasted his son's special tea, he knew its extraordinary properties. His body felt a decade younger, with noticeable improvements after each serving—though the effects diminished with repeated use. Between this miraculous tea and Li Shiming's unexpected second-place examination result, Li Wenyuan knew something extraordinary was happening. 

But whatever it was, Li Shiming remained his son, and some secrets were best left unprobed.
