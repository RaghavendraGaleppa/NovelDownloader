# Chapter 161: Young Lady, Would You Like to Extend the Session?

The two were incredibly close, so close they could hear each other's heartbeat.

As is well known, the water of the Misty Flower Immortal Spring flows endlessly. The spring source below keeps bubbling, and excess water flows out through a drain.

Li Mo just happened to be sitting right at the drain.

The water enveloping Ying Bing continuously washed over him, and the strands of her jet-black hair kept tickling his back.

Moreover, after stepping into the Observation Realm, his sixth sense had become extremely sharp.

He could feel Ying Bing’s gaze fixed on the back of his head.

Li Mo considered himself a perfect gentleman.

But...

At this moment, a voice seemed to be whispering ambiguously in his ear:

*‘Just take a look back, just one look...’*

This is tough.

While Ying Bing’s nerves were stretched taut, curiosity was also surging within her.

No one had ever surpassed her in the same realm, and certainly not twice.

*‘How did he do it?’*

*‘What other strengths does he have that I don’t know about?’*

She calmed her breathing.

Letting out a soft breath, Ying Bing asked:

“How did you exchange blows with Yin Huaxuan?”

“Actually, he wasn’t killed by me.”

Li Mo also felt he needed to say something to distract himself:

“After the Pagoda extracted a blood pill from Yin Huaxuan’s body, its strength soared to a terrifying level. It actually managed to survive a blow from my hammer.”

“Truly strange.”

If Yin Huaxuan and the Pagoda were here, they would surely bang on their coffin lids in frustration.

Who could be stranger than you,小子 (brat)!

Ying Bing lowered her eyes for a moment and said softly:

“The martial arts of the Summoning Demon Sect focus on replenishing form with form.”

“Actually, their martial arts cannot be said to be inherently evil. If used for good, they are good; if used for evil, they are evil.”

The Ice Cube opened up.

She seemed quite knowledgeable about the Summoning Demon Sect.

Li Mo learned that the fundamental martial art of the Summoning Demon Sect was called the *Summoning Demon Sutra*.

It was a supreme skill.

All the martial arts of the Summoning Demon Sect were derived from this foundation.

Any supreme skill is an interpretation of the origin of martial arts, with no distinction between good and evil. Therefore, the *Summoning Demon Sutra* could actually be called the *Summoning God Sutra*.

But obviously.

The Summoning Demon Sect had not used this martial art for the right path.

Li Mo thought this was normal.

For example, the Self-Observation Method within it.

The right path was to practice hard day after day, experiencing countless hardships, and summoning oneself as a god.

The evil path was to absorb the beliefs of others, nourish one's soul, and strengthen oneself with the thoughts of the masses. It was clearly a shortcut, so it spread widely.

“The Summoning Demon Sect must have some scheme against the Clear Abyss Sect.”

Li Mo sighed softly.

Yin Huaxuan and the Pagoda had both been lurking within the sect for years.

It couldn't just be a hobby to be a spy, right?

“There is.”

“But, it doesn't matter.”

Ying Bing’s meaning was not to think too much about it.

Strengthening oneself is the true principle.

But in Li Mo’s ears, he automatically added four words to the end: *‘I will handle it.’*

Overbearing and strong, just like her!

“That’s right. With you in the Clear Abyss Sect, there’s nothing to worry about.”

Li Mo’s tone was full of certainty.

Red Destiny, the Empress of the Phoenix Heaven ordained by the heavens.

With her, there are no surprises!

“.....”

Two cat ears twitched.

Ying Bing’s lowered eyes saw her current attire through the clear flowing water.

Her pearl-like toes curled up tightly.

She had carried the expectations of countless people, revered as a goddess by many. She should have long since treated praise and trust like a passing breeze.

But偏偏 (偏偏), these words came from him.

He had just surpassed her in the system ranking.

She didn't even know how he did it.

That sense of disbelief had now completely turned into curiosity...

【Ding Dong—】

【Friendly Reminder.】

【As is well known, scrubbing each other's backs while soaking in a hot spring is a very comfortable thing.】

The water swayed the strands of hair at Ying Bing’s ears.

---

Her eyes widened slightly.

Scrub... back?

Let her, the Empress of the Phoenix Heaven, scrub a man's... back?

She would never, ever...

【During the shared bath process, everything the host does will affect the penalty evaluation~】

Ying Bing: “.....”

The air went silent for a few seconds.

“Li Mo.”

“Hmm?”

“Pass me the towel.”

“What do you need the towel for?”

“Inside the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, thank you for helping me.”

Half of what the Ice Cube said was sincere.

“Ah, we aren't outsiders, it was a small matter...”

Li Mo handed it over casually, but before he could finish speaking, his body stiffened slightly.

Because the Ice Cube didn't want the towel for herself.

Her delicate hands gently rubbed the towel against his back.

Because she was scrubbing his back.

She took two steps forward.

At this moment.

The warm breath behind his ears, the water waves exchanging body heat between their skin, and the splashing sound of the scrubbing were all incredibly clear.

The blush on Ying Bing’s neck showed signs of spreading as she said:

“By the way, do you have any preparations for the Cloud Province Martial Arts Summit?”

“Cough, I... have to participate?”

“Mm, each peak will select one person.”

When Ying Bing said this, Li Mo understood.

The Jade Peak only had him as a single seedling.

But that wasn't the key point.

The key point was that he was a normal male ball...

Through the reflection of the water, he seemed to realize that Ying Bing,不知何时 (不知何时), seemed to have taken off her bathrobe.

The bathrobe had sleeves.

And the Ice Cube scrubbing his back was clearly not wearing a garment with sleeves.

Could it be...

Who could withstand this!

....

Ying Bing, as if possessed, glanced downward with her peripheral vision.

Something she didn't have was very obvious right now...

A grand scene.

It was a grand scene that the Empress of the Phoenix Heaven, who stood above all living beings, had never seen before.

!

“Pa—”

A slender hand chopped down on Li Mo’s neck.

Li Mo’s body parts often had a mind of their own.

At this moment, Ying Bing’s hand was the same.

Her shapely eyebrows knitted together as she covered her chest:

“You just had... a mosquito on your neck.”

Li Mo, seeing stars: “......”

Are you killing a mosquito or killing me?

It’s summer, sure, but do I or don't I know if there are mosquitoes?

He naturally knew why the Ice Cube had chopped his head.

But...

Just like the morning dew that arrives on time every day, what could he do!

“Haa...”

Ying Bing’s chest heaved slightly, but her heart rate refused to drop no matter what.

She wished she could disappear on the spot!

【Countdown, five... four... three... two... one...】

Finally.

In a year that felt like a second, the countdown finally ended.

Ying Bing quickly changed back into her clothes and flew onto the bank.

A flush of color flowed out, covering her entire body.

“I’m leaving first.”

She didn't look at Li Mo’s expression.

She just wanted to leave this place quickly...

【Ding Dong, does the host want to extend the session?】

【Extending the session can improve the evaluation...】

....

PS: Hehe, the little failure’s training is showing initial results, but my phone has caught a virus, what should I do, dear audience?
