# Chapter 14: Combo Function

The days immediately following the planting were some of the rare relaxed times for the spiritual field cultivators.

If not cultivate now, then when? Everyone else also took their rewards back, cultivating one after another in eager haste.

Liu Yun had the most rewards, making them particularly troublesome to carry. Ding Rui stayed to help, and the two moved them inside together.

“Your *Rainfall Art* should be almost complete, right?” Liu Yun couldn't help but ask during this time.

Ding Rui, holding a large bag of spiritual rice, his face unreddened and heart unracing, winked at Liu Yun, “Guess?”

“Guess if I’m going to guess?” Liu Yun rolled his eyes at him.

“Heh heh.” Ding Rui chuckled, lowering his voice conspiratorially, “I’ve already mastered it!”

Liu Yun raised an eyebrow, genuinely pleased, “That’s not slow.”

“Of course.”

“But why didn’t you go to the sect to claim your reward?”

“I’m afraid the sect will find out and reassign people in our 377 spiritual field,” Ding Rui said. “Anyway, I’m not in a hurry to cultivate right now, my resources are completely sufficient, and I don’t really need the sect’s rewards.”

Just as Ding Rui had mentioned before, he didn't need to worry about casting rain in the 377 spiritual field, which gave him time to cultivate. But for him, there was an even more important matter.

That was, he could save a skill slot!

If he still had to be responsible for casting rain, he would have to condense another rain-casting skill.

By then, four skill slots would be used up, leaving only three.

And he still had three cultivation methods he hadn't practiced.

Not to mention, if nothing unexpected happened, he would no longer be able to avoid the spiritual field tasks generated by these three cultivation methods, unlike how he avoided casting rain.

“Not enough skill slots…”

Ding Rui’s earlier joy at getting skill slots had completely vanished.

He had originally thought seven was a lot, but looking at it now, seven was simply not enough.

Unless he completely relied on himself for certain cultivation and spell arts, without using skill slots.

But at this moment, Ding Rui didn't want to do that.

Having a cheat ability, wouldn't it be unreasonable not to find every way to fully utilize it?

Even if there truly was no other way in the end, he had to try first.

Therefore, to merge two skills, one must detach from the skill slots and personally cast both skills simultaneously for the skill slots to capture them.

And successfully comprehend them.

In short, skill slots would only comprehend skills that were cast *without* relying on skill slots!

They could not comprehend skills cast *by* relying on skill slots.

Naturally, it was impossible to achieve skill fusion purely by relying on skill slots.

Because he had transmigrated into a real world, the skill fusion mechanics had changed somewhat.

Skill slots only served an auxiliary role and couldn't fundamentally change anything about Ding Rui.

But this wasn't unreasonable; after all, Ding Rui wasn't playing a game, but surviving in a real cultivation world.

…

However, it was extremely difficult to successfully circulate even one cultivation method within the body simultaneously, let alone two.

Ding Rui wasn't particularly optimistic about his own talent; he couldn't easily multitask.

But he still intended to give it a try.
