# Chapter 40: Third Uncle

Qin Chong waited nearly half an hour before the grand hall's doors slowly opened. However, the person who emerged took him completely by surprise—it was his former father-in-law, Yun Qing. He hadn't expected Yun Qing to be the one discussing matters with Meng Fei.

Seeing this, Qin Chong could only bow respectfully and say, "Qin Chong pays his respects to Senior Yun." Since the marriage alliance between their families had been dissolved, Qin Chong no longer addressed him as "Uncle," opting for the more formal "Senior" instead.

"Oh? Nephew Qin? What brings you here?" Yun Qing was equally surprised to see Qin Chong.

"Reporting to Senior Yun, this junior is awaiting an audience with Senior Meng."

This exchange revealed that the guard who had come to report earlier had used a secret sound transmission technique; otherwise, Yun Qing would have known Qin Chong was waiting outside.

"Your cultivation has advanced so significantly?" Yun Qing suddenly noticed Qin Chong's aura—now at the sixth level of Qi Refining.

"After several years of tempering myself at the Cangwu Mine, I was fortunate enough to break through."

"That's excellent news. Your father will surely be overjoyed to see you reach this stage."

"I suppose so."

Yun Qing's expression darkened slightly, his demeanor becoming somewhat uneasy.

"Since you're here to see Fellow Daoist Meng, you should go in now. I have other matters to attend to."

"Safe travels, Senior Yun." Qin Chong bowed respectfully once more.

At that moment, a voice sounded in his ears: "Qin Chong, enter."

It was Meng Fei's voice.

Upon entering the hall, Qin Chong closed the doors behind him before offering a deep bow. "This junior, Qin Chong, pays his respects to Senior Meng."

"No need for formalities." Meng Fei remained as composed as ever, though Qin Chong could sense his aura had grown significantly stronger compared to two years ago—his cultivation had clearly advanced.

"Thank you, Senior."

"I assume you're here about the Cangwu Mine incident?"

"Senior's insight is unparalleled. After narrowly escaping with my life, I was uncertain how to resolve this matter and could only presume to seek your guidance."

"I personally reviewed the list of fallen cultivators from that day, and your name was indeed among them. However, I'm curious—how did someone of your cultivation level survive?"

"This is what happened. When our three-person team entered the depths of the mine..."

Qin Chong recounted the events of that day, including his detour through Pingchuan County to return to Pingyang City. Of course, he glossed over certain unusual details, summarizing most of the experience.

"To think you endured so much. Given your cultivation level, surviving is nothing short of miraculous. That single conflict claimed dozens of lives on our side."

Qin Chong's expression turned grave. "It was that severe?"

"Wait—your cultivation has improved significantly?" Only now did Meng Fei notice Qin Chong's advancement.

"Perhaps I was stuck at the first bottleneck for too long. Accumulated effort finally bore fruit."

"Regardless, you were fortunate this time. Surviving against such odds is a blessing. I'll explain the situation to the valley authorities—they likely won't investigate too deeply."

"Many thanks, Senior Meng. These are the spirit stones I mined during the final months at the site. Please deliver them to Canglong Valley on my behalf. As long as this matter is resolved properly, I'll be satisfied."

As he spoke, Qin Chong handed over a storage pouch.

"Hmm? There are at least five to six thousand low-grade spirit stones here, all unmistakably from the mine."

"Some were obtained when our team eliminated two Qingxuan Sect cultivators. I didn't dare keep them for myself."

"Good. I'll submit these to the valley on your behalf. As for the compensation spirit stones issued to your Qin family, there's no need to return them. Just have your father contribute slightly more during the next tribute payment."

"Your generosity is deeply appreciated, Senior Meng. I'll inform my father."

"You may take your leave now. I have other matters to attend to."

"This junior bids farewell."

With that, Qin Chong departed Canglong Valley's outpost, feeling as if a great weight had been lifted. Meng Fei already held considerable status within Canglong Valley, and with his imminent advancement to late-stage Foundation Establishment, his influence would only grow. Establishing a connection with him now would undoubtedly benefit Qin Chong's future within the valley.

After returning to the inn, Qin Chong promptly checked out, intending to return to his family immediately. However, at the city gates, he encountered his third uncle, Qin Ming, accompanied by two children—a boy and girl around eleven or twelve years old.

His third uncle's rotund figure made him instantly recognizable even from a distance, though the man regarded Qin Chong with a puzzled expression. It wasn't until they drew closer that recognition dawned.

"Third Uncle!"

"Is it really you? If not for your striking resemblance to your father, I wouldn't have believed it." Third Uncle's eyes grew moist with emotion upon seeing Qin Chong.

In just three years, Qin Chong had transformed from a youthful boy into a young man—taller now, with sharper facial features.

"Well, I've grown up. It's natural for my appearance to change."

"Your return is a blessing. Your father has been restless lately, fearing you'd perished."

"The danger was indeed extreme, but fate decreed otherwise. I narrowly escaped death."

Third Uncle patted Qin Chong's shoulder, steadying his emotions. "You two, greet your uncle properly. This is your third uncle."

"Greetings, Third Uncle!" the children chorused.

Qin Chong was momentarily confused. Since when had he become a third uncle?

"Third Uncle, who are they?"

"These are your elder brothers' children—Qin Yue and Qin Lei, direct descendants of our Qin family."

"You brought them back... do they possess spiritual roots?"

"Indeed. Recently, your father visited our ancestral home and discovered these two have spiritual roots. However, he had other matters to attend to, so he tasked me with bringing them to the family afterward."

"I see."

The Qin family's residence at Mount Xiao was reserved for cultivators. Their ancestral home lay seven to eight hundred li away in Ping'an Town, where at least thirty percent of residents bore the Qin surname. Though Qin Chong was considered the main lineage's eldest son at Mount Xiao, he actually had two older brothers. Lacking spiritual roots, they had been sent back to Ping'an Town in their teens to marry and raise families.

"Meeting you here is fortuitous. Let's rest here tonight and return together tomorrow."

"Agreed. I see your spiritual energy is depleted, Third Uncle. A night's recovery before traveling would be wise."

"Chong'er... you've broken through? You've reached the sixth level of Qi Refining?" Sensing Qin Chong's aura, Qin Ming's face lit up with excitement.

"A fortunate breakthrough. These years of experience abroad likely contributed."

"Hahaha! This calls for celebration—two joyous occasions! If not for my exhausted energy, I'd rush back to tell your father immediately."

"No need for haste. One more night makes no difference."

Qin Yue and Qin Lei, clearly visiting a city of this scale for the first time, gazed around in wide-eyed wonder at their unfamiliar surroundings.
