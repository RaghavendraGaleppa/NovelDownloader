# Chapter 62: The Team Disbands  

Though puzzled about where Yao Shifeng had obtained the spirit stones to treat everyone to such an extravagant spiritual meal, since the restaurant owner had already confirmed that Yao had paid, and with his repeated invitations, the group eventually picked up their chopsticks. Hu Hai and Wu Jinfei quickly devoured the spiritual dishes before them—this meal was undoubtedly a rare opportunity for their cultivation to advance rapidly. In contrast, Gu Mo and Chu Feifei ate with much more grace.  

As for Yao Shifeng, he merely took a few symbolic bites before setting down his chopsticks, leaving the rest of the meal for the others. His behavior only deepened Gu Mo's suspicion that something significant was about to happen. Yet, what major event could possibly involve mere outer sect disciples like them?  

"From today onward, I will no longer be an outer sect disciple of the Qinglu Sect," Yao Shifeng announced once everyone had eaten their fill, dropping the bombshell without preamble.  

"I have earned the favor of Young Master He and will now serve under him," he continued before anyone could react.  

"What?! Boss Yao, you've become an attendant to the sect master's personal disciple?!" Wu Jinfei exclaimed in shock. Many were aware that the sect master's disciple had recently been recruiting attendants.  

In the Artifact Peak where Wu Jinfei resided, one outer sect disciple had already received such an invitation, instantly elevating his status to the coveted position of attendant to the sect master's disciple. Wu Jinfei had been green with envy at the time, and now that Yao Shifeng had achieved the same position, he couldn't contain his excitement—this meant they had secured a powerful backer.  

"Boss Yao, are you planning to disband our team?" Gu Mo asked, finally understanding Yao Shifeng's intentions.  

Wu Jinfei's naive belief that Yao Shifeng's new status would allow them to ride his coattails was laughable. On the contrary, once an outer sect disciple became an attendant to an inner sect disciple, their status as a disciple—whether outer or inner—would be revoked. Their new identity would solely be that of an attendant, severing their previous affiliations.  

With their statuses fundamentally changed, the team could no longer continue as it was.  

"Correct," Yao Shifeng nodded. "Of course, I will compensate everyone for their previous investments in me."  

With that, he took out a jade vial and handed it to Hu Hai. Hu Hai accepted it in a daze, the suddenness of the situation leaving him momentarily stunned.  

Only when he opened the vial and the medicinal fragrance wafted out did Hu Hai snap back to reality. As an outer sect disciple of the Alchemy Peak, Hu Hai was no stranger to pills. He immediately recognized the contents—a rare cultivation-enhancing elixir, something he had long yearned for but could never obtain.  

While Hu Hai was still reeling from the shock of the pill, Yao Shifeng produced a spirit sword and handed it to Wu Jinfei. Though only a low-grade artifact, it was far superior to the crude, unranked sword Wu Jinfei had forged himself—a weapon perfectly suited to his needs, the kind he had dreamed of day and night.  

Next, Chu Feifei received a set of formation plates, while Gu Mo was given thirty catties of Water Spirit Rice.  

Glancing at the rice, Gu Mo couldn't help but feel a sense of familiarity—wasn't this the very rice he had handed over earlier?  

"Though the team is disbanding, our friendship remains," Yao Shifeng said solemnly. "If any of you encounter difficulties, you may seek me out. Within my personal capacity, I will do my best to help." He emphasized the words "personal capacity," making his meaning clear.  

Minor favors, out of friendship, he would consider. But asking him to leverage Young Master He's name for their benefit was absolutely out of the question. As an attendant, borrowing his master's authority was a grave taboo.  

Yao Shifeng's words instantly doused Wu Jinfei's excitement. "Then I wish Boss Yao a bright future!" Wu Jinfei raised his wine cup in a toast.  

Following suit, Hu Hai, Chu Feifei, and Gu Mo also raised their cups. From this moment onward, they would each walk their own paths.  

"And I wish you all success on your immortal paths!" Yao Shifeng downed his spirit wine, then turned and left the lavish private room.  

With his departure, the atmosphere in the room grew heavy. The turn of events had taken everyone by surprise.  

Wu Jinfei glanced around, a thought forming in his mind—perhaps he could rebuild the team himself. But in the end, he remained silent, lacking Yao Shifeng's commanding presence.  

Gu Mo, too, was filled with mixed emotions. He had thought this small group, formed during their humble beginnings, would support each other as they trudged along the thorny path of cultivation.  

Who would have guessed that after just a few years, the team would disband? Still, though the team was gone, their friendships remained—though time would inevitably erode even those bonds.  

"Everything settled?"  

After leaving the private room, Yao Shifeng ascended to the most luxurious suite on the top floor of the restaurant. Upon his arrival, Young Master He spoke.  

"Many thanks for your generosity, Young Master!" Yao Shifeng bowed deeply. The spirit stones for the meal, as well as the pills and artifacts given to his former teammates, had all been provided by Young Master He.  

"Work hard from now on, and you shall receive what you desire," Young Master He nodded in approval. Initially, he had been drawn to Yao Shifeng's ambition, but now, his handling of the situation had further impressed him. Yao Shifeng was undoubtedly an exceptional attendant.  

With Yao Shifeng's departure, the group gradually dispersed. Whether they would ever reunite like this again, no one could say.  

"Here, take this."  

Gu Mo tossed the thirty catties of Water Spirit Rice to Chu Feifei. In a few months, his spirit field would yield another harvest, so he had no shortage of rice.  

"Consider it a down payment for a new formation," Gu Mo added before Chu Feifei could protest. He then explained his requirements.  

As the plants in his spirit field grew stronger, Gu Mo felt that relying solely on an illusion formation was insufficient. While a defensive formation could protect, it lacked concealment properties. Thus, he wanted an additional obscuring formation layered over it.  

"Understood."  

Chu Feifei nodded. Though still an outer sect disciple, once she reached the third level of Qi Refining, she would have the opportunity to advance further and study true formation techniques.  

This was the chance the Formation Peak offered every outer sect disciple who reached the third level—a shot at changing their fate. For outer sect disciples, reaching the third level already placed them among the elite. If such a disciple showed talent in formations, the sect was willing to nurture them into low-level formation masters.  

All long-established sects understood that relentless exploitation of outer sect disciples yielded diminishing returns. Without hope, disciples would grow apathetic and slack.  

But with this opportunity to change their destinies, outer sect disciples would push themselves to the limit, striving with all their might for a better future.
