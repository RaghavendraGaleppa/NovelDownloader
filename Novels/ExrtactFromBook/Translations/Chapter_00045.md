# Chapter 45: Fourth Order  

"What an adorable little fox. You'll be staying with me from now on." The palace-robed woman's voice flowed like a clear spring, carrying a unique texture that was utterly captivating.  

To everyone's surprise, she clung tightly to Hu Le'er, refusing to let go!  

Then, with her right hand, she reached out and grasped the **Peach God Branch** floating before her, effortlessly containing the overwhelming divine power within the branch as if it were nothing.  

"You won't mind if I borrow this branch for a while, will you, little fox?"  

Hu Le'er felt an immense force pressing down on her entire body. She couldn't even speak, let alone breathe. Her divine sense was completely sealed within her consciousness, leaving her only able to observe the woman through her eyes.  

Yet, the woman's aura was like sharp needles, stinging Hu Le'er's vision painfully!  

Hu Le'er quickly realized—this woman was a supreme **Longevity True Monarch**!  

Daring not to resist, she allowed the woman to stroke her fur.  

As the inheritor of a Great Sage's legacy, she understood all too well what the Fourth Order of Longevity truly meant.  

Below the Longevity realm, higher cultivation ranks only indicated greater depth of power but didn’t necessarily guarantee absolute dominance in combat. Superior mana, profound divine abilities, and powerful artifacts could allow a second-order cultivator to slay a weaker third-order opponent.  

But once one reached the Longevity True Monarch stage, a cultivator's strength underwent a qualitative transformation. Without power of the same order, resistance was futile.  

Holding the **Peach God Branch**, the palace-robed woman began absorbing its divine energy. Under her meticulous control, the towering tree's silhouette rapidly shrank.  

The **Peach God Branch**, a fourth-order treasure imbued with the immense power of **Granny Peach**, would normally dissipate after use due to the uncontrollable loss of its divine energy.  

Yet, this woman, with her extraordinary mastery, slowly compressed the released energy back into the branch.  

Delighted at the prospect of claiming the **Peach God Branch**, she looked as if she had just acquired a fascinating new toy.  

But then—  

The **Peach God Branch** suddenly erupted with a surge of immense power from a distant realm!  

It tore free from the woman's grasp!  

"Granny!" Hu Le'er cried out.  

It was the fourth-order demon saint **Granny Peach**, striking through the treasure from afar!  

Once freed, the **Peach God Branch** exploded!  

The tremendous force shattered the void, leaving behind a spatial rift.  

On the other side of the rift stood a mountain bathed in dazzling peach blossoms. At its peak, a colossal peach tree—identical to the earlier phantom—extended its branches through the rift!  

**Mount Taoyuan**!  

**Granny Peach**!  

The branches lashed out like whips, crossing the rift in an instant and coiling around the palace-robed woman.  

Caught off guard, she was tightly bound. Only the sudden emergence of two spectral projections—a turtle and a snake—from her body shielded her from harm.  

The white fox in her arms was snatched away by the branches, swiftly dragged through the rift to **Mount Taoyuan**, tens of thousands of miles away!  

"Li Juexian! I've finally caught you this time!"  

"Do you truly believe the demon race has no one left?"  

A distant voice echoed from beyond the rift.  

This palace-robed woman was none other than the newly ascended Longevity True Monarch—**Li Zihan, the Juexian True Monarch of the Demon-Seeking Palace**!  

Though bound, she remained unruffled.  

"Granny, why so harsh?"  

"I merely found the blossoms on your **Peach God Branch** quite exquisite and wanted to admire them at leisure."  

"If you objected, I could have returned it. Was destroying the treasure really necessary?"  

"Enough of your silver tongue!"  

"This time, you won't escape!"  

From across the void, **Granny Peach** unleashed her full power, anchoring Li Zihan firmly in place with her branches.  

Then—  

A streak of crimson light tore through the distant sky, hurtling toward Li Zihan!  

The light materialized into a massive dark-red ape, wielding a golden spear!  

With a thunderous thrust, the ape drove the spear forward with unstoppable force, shattering all obstacles between itself and Li Zihan!  

A fourth-order Great Sage of the Ape Tribe—  

**The Ape Demon**!  

At the appearance of the second great demon, Li Zihan finally tensed—this was a trap set specifically for her!  

No longer speaking, she steeled herself against the incoming spear.  

Bound by the branches, she couldn't evade and could only rely on her defensive treasures to withstand the blow.  

Yet, just as the spear was about to strike—  

An unseen force from the void clashed violently with the spearhead!  

The collision produced a piercing shriek!  

The **Ape Demon**'s perfectly aimed strike was deflected, grazing past Li Zihan's body!  

Meanwhile, the unseen force—unfazed—arced through the air and slashed at the **Ape Demon**'s back!  

A metallic clang resounded as a deep wound split open on the ape's back, spraying dark-golden blood!  

"**Formless Sword**!" the **Ape Demon** roared.  

"**Shi Xuan**!"  

The **Formless Sword**—a fourth-order artifact!  

A treasure of the Penglai Sect, one of the paramount powers of the realm!  

The deadliest weapon in the **Jade Sky Realm**!  

With the **Formless Sword** appearing, its wielder—**Shi Xuan, the Stone-Cleansing True Monarch**—couldn't be far behind!  

"Retreat!"  

Realizing the situation was hopeless, the **Ape Demon** immediately decided to flee.  

Swinging its golden spear wildly to fend off the unpredictable strikes of the **Formless Sword**, it charged toward the spatial rift leading to **Mount Taoyuan**.  

*Clang!*  

*Clang!*  

The spear and sword clashed repeatedly, filling the air with deafening echoes.  

But evading the **Formless Sword** was no easy feat.  

In an instant, countless sword rays filled the void, leaving the **Ape Demon** with no room to dodge.  

By the time it reached the rift, its body was riddled with wounds.  

Dark-gold blood rained down as the **Ape Demon** scrambled into **Mount Taoyuan** without a backward glance.  

Both it and **Granny Peach** had believed this was the perfect ambush—only to fall prey to Shi Xuan and his sword!  

Once the **Ape Demon** escaped, **Granny Peach** began channeling her power to shrink the rift while retracting her branches.  

But now, it was her turn to be trapped!  

Li Zihan summoned the turtle and snake spirits, using them to yank at the branches, preventing **Granny Peach** from withdrawing!
