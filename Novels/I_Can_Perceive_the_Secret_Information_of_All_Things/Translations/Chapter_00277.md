# Chapter 277: Strange Thunder, Strange Man, Wicked Monk

On the ninth night after leaving the Divine Armory Valley, the weather was clear with a bright moon. The three of them set up a campfire in the wilderness to roast meat.  

Their barbecue equipment was complete!  

Xiao Ji was analyzing the traces left by the Thunder Pool Sword, his expression relaxed.  

"Operating a boiler isn't too difficult. You just need to regularly add spirit stones, control the intensity of the flames with your abilities as a Qi Path cultivator, and keep records of the daily spirit stone consumption..." Zhao Jiuzhou was explaining boiler operation techniques to Fan Dali.  

"But operating a boiler doesn’t seem to create much value for Tianzhu Mountain, does it?" Fan Dali still had some ideals. After all, he was a Core Formation cultivator—even if he was a rogue cultivator, he was still a genuine Core Formation cultivator. He could be looked down upon, but not belittled.  

"Dali, operating a boiler is a remarkable task. Not everyone can control the intensity of spiritual flames. Moreover, the boiler is the most crucial part of an assembly-line magical tool. Think about it—if the boiler isn’t burning spirit stones, wouldn’t the entire assembly line stop working?" Zhao Jiuzhou reasoned.  

Fan Dali nodded, finding the logic sound.  

"Only with a well-operated boiler can the assembly-line magical tools function properly and produce the final artifacts." Zhao Jiuzhou continued to reassure Fan Dali, whose heart hadn’t yet settled on becoming a boiler operator.  

For Tianzhu Mountain to develop its industry, they indeed needed someone to operate the boiler. Zhao Jiuzhou knew that Fan Dali’s joining would save him a lot of time, which he could then use for other tasks—such as refining the low-end storage artifact assembly line, expanding Tianzhu Mountain’s infrastructure, and laying a solid foundation for future mass recruitment of temporary workers.  

Thus, the three of them rested by the campfire late into the night, eating meat, drinking wine, and relaxing—a rather pleasant scene.  

---  

On the seventy-second day after leaving the Divine Armory Valley, the weather was overcast with no sun in sight. The three of them rested in an abandoned temple, where a pot of wild rabbit stew simmered over a fire.  

Xiao Ji stared at a hole in the temple’s roof—a hole made by lightning—as fallen leaves drifted down through it. His expression was solemn, clearly troubled by something.  

"Actually, boilers don’t have to be the same shape. I once saw a peach-shaped boiler in a magical tool shop in Taigu City. Wow, it was even painted in bright colors—truly eye-catching..." Zhao Jiuzhou was sharing his rich experiences with Fan Dali, though his stories never strayed far from Taigu City.  

His life experience was limited to Taigu City.  

Fan Dali was envious. As a rogue cultivator, he had never visited any major Daoist cities. His pockets were always light, his spirit stones perpetually insufficient. He couldn’t afford to spend spirit stones just to visit a city for fun, nor could he indulge in the luxuries where wealthy cultivators gathered.  

Most cultivators never set foot in a Daoist city in their lives.  

"I’m not too fond of peaches. I prefer cherries, watermelons, lychees, and bananas... I wonder if there are boilers shaped like those. They’d surely look amazing when burning," Fan Dali mused, voicing his preferences.  

Zhao Jiuzhou thought for a moment before declaring confidently, "Even if they don’t exist, we can specially craft one for you. As long as you like it, that’s all that matters. After all, you’re the only one fit to operate Tianzhu Mountain’s most important boiler."  

"Let me think about it a bit more. This is a rather significant decision," Fan Dali replied cautiously.  

---  

On the 176th day after leaving the Divine Armory Valley, the sky was dark and sunless, with a biting wind. The three of them camped by a river, preparing to roast fish.  

Xiao Ji had already caught many fish, but he continued fishing, his expression grave as if burdened by something important.  

He knew the Thunder Pool Sword was getting closer. It couldn’t hide much longer.  

"What if the boiler explodes? What should we do then?" Fan Dali was cleaning the fish, scaling and gutting them. Puncturing a fish bladder had sparked a profound contemplation about boilers.  

"See, this is why you’re perfect for boiler operation. You’ve raised an excellent safety concern—one we must seriously consider," Zhao Jiuzhou agreed, recognizing the importance of the issue.  

The two engaged in a serious and heated discussion about boiler explosions—one advocating for reinforcing the boiler, the other for controlling the amount of spirit stones burned.  

But reinforcing the boiler didn’t eliminate the risk of explosion. Even a boiler forged from celestial iron might not withstand prolonged, intense spiritual flames. Reducing the spirit stone input was feasible, but it would lower the output and possibly the quality of the assembly-line artifacts...  

The problem seemed unsolvable.  

Xiao Ji caught another fish, smacked it dead, and tossed it onto the grill.  

"You could prepare two boilers—or even more. If one explodes, just switch to the next," Xiao Ji suggested. "Alright, from today onward, no more discussions about boilers."  

He’d had enough.  

For days, his companions had talked about nothing but boilers from dawn till dusk. Even when he tried steering the conversation toward more refined topics like tea ceremonies, they’d somehow relate it back to boilers—suggesting teacup-shaped boilers would be interesting, or converting tea ceremony steps into boiler operation procedures, even naming the steps.  

In the art of tea, there were terms like "Lord Guan Patrolling the City" and "Han Xin Commanding Troops."  

The two of them, however, called opening the boiler door "Opening the Cavern" and shoveling spirit stones into the boiler with an iron spade "A Thousand Stars Converging."  

Sometimes, even a Nascent Soul cultivator’s patience wore thin. The only difference was that when angered, they had more ways to vent their frustrations.  

With the boiler discussion forcibly ended, Zhao Jiuzhou and Fan Dali suddenly found themselves at a loss for words, unsure what to talk about next.  

"Ah, well... If you want the grilled fish to be delicious, you must control the fire properly..." Zhao Jiuzhou remarked, staring at the fish.  

Fan Dali’s eyes lit up as he gazed at the flames and fish. "Exactly! This is what us Qi Path cultivators excel at!"  

*Whoosh—*  

He blew a gust of spiritual energy onto the fire, instantly extinguishing it and sending ashes flying.  

Xiao Ji placed a stick on the hot coals. "You two eat. I’ve suddenly lost my appetite for grilled fish."  

Zhao Jiuzhou and Fan Dali noticed Xiao Ji’s dark expression. Though unsure why he was in such a foul mood, they silently finished their fish, swallowing even the bones to avoid upsetting him further.  

A few days later, they arrived at a small town.  

---  

**A Few Days Earlier**  

**Ping’an City**  

Ping’an City was a modest settlement in the small nation of Tianping. Though not a land of abundance, its people lived self-sufficiently. Historically, the city had never suffered natural disasters—its only worry was the surrounding great powers, any of which might engulf it should war break out.  

The name "Ping’an" (Peace) was fitting, for the city had indeed been peaceful throughout history, seemingly blessed by the heavens.  

But lately, the city had grown unusual—thunder struck frequently.  

For people long accustomed to peace, such anomalies caused panic. They summoned Daoist priests to exorcise evil, invited monks to invoke blessings, and tried every conceivable method—regardless of whether Daoist and Buddhist powers might cancel each other out.  

*BOOM!*  

A thunderbolt struck the roof of a noodle shop, blasting a hole through it. Terrified customers fled with their bowls and chopsticks, stopping a safe distance away to watch while continuing to eat.  

"Hey! You haven’t paid for your noodles!" The shop owner ran out after them. "And don’t take my bowls!"  

Even in the face of disaster, bills had to be settled.  

"We haven’t even finished eating! What’s the rush?" A customer grumbled. Who would skip out on a few coins?  

All eyes turned to the lightning strike.  

"I saw it clearly—the lightning hit someone. A young man," a customer slurped his noodles between words.  

"Oh no, he’s surely dead," someone lamented.  

"Not necessarily. Buildings can shield against lightning," another countered, citing architectural knowledge.  

Soon, a final figure emerged from the shop—a man charred black by lightning, his clothes in tatters.  

He appeared thin and frail, silently walking away from the crowd’s gaze.  

"Whose unlucky child is that?" someone pitied.  

The shop owner squinted. "Hmm... He looks like my new hire. A quiet, hardworking lad—though a bit stiff in his movements. Who knew lightning would strike him?"  

*CRACK!*  

Another bolt descended, striking the thin man squarely on the head.  

Miraculously, he didn’t fall. He merely grew blacker, his clothes more ragged, small flames licking at his body as smoke curled from his scalp.  

"What did he do to deserve this? It’s like divine punishment," someone gasped.  

The man shook his head and kept walking—clearly intending to leave Ping’an City.  

*CRACK!*  

"This is tragic," a bystander muttered. "Three strikes in a row. He must’ve violated heavenly laws in a past life."  

*CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!*  

Ping’an City was anything but peaceful today. The people grew fearful.  

The thin man was struck repeatedly as he walked, leaving no footprints—only scorch marks where lightning had hit.  

Thus, he departed the city.  

No one knew where he went—or whether the lightning finally killed him.  

---  

Xiao Ji, Zhao Jiuzhou, and Fan Dali arrived in Ping’an City.  

Locals watched as the Daoist followed the trail of lightning strikes, puzzled by his purpose.  

Tracking the path outside the city, Xiao Ji studied the last scorch mark intently.  

"Struck at every step... Even violating heavenly laws shouldn’t warrant this," he mused, gazing skyward to trace the thunder’s origin.  

The lightning wasn’t celestial—it coalesced from spiritual energy in the air.  

Such spontaneous lightning was typically the work of Thunder Spirit Root cultivators. Yet the fact that so many strikes hadn’t killed a frail man was baffling.  

**[The thunder is self-generated by the Thunder Pool Sword.]**  

This simple statement might baffle others, but Xiao Ji understood. He knew whom he’d been pursuing—the Thunder Pool Sword, a blade capable of independent movement. If the thunder stemmed from the sword, only one explanation fit: the lightning-struck man *was* the Thunder Pool Sword.  

What puzzled him was why it had appeared in a human city—working as a humble noodle shop assistant.  

"Brother Xiao, what exactly have we been searching for all these days?" Zhao Jiuzhou finally asked. He’d been curious for a while but only voiced it now.  

He was eager to return to Tianzhu Mountain—to refine materials from the Hundred Weapons Secret Realm, begin crafting assembly-line artifacts, and tackle countless tasks.  

Yet he was conflicted. Part of him wanted to follow Xiao Ji, hoping to acquire more materials.  

Fan Dali was the most eager to return. As a rogue cultivator, he’d lacked backing and suffered for it. Now, fortune had smiled upon him—he’d found stable work under a formidable Nascent Soul Daoist.  

"A sword," Xiao Ji answered plainly.  

He hadn’t hidden his goal—Zhao Jiuzhou had simply never asked.  

Whatever Xiao Ji sought was never ordinary. Even if Zhao Jiuzhou didn’t fully grasp Xiao Ji’s caliber, Fan Dali—a Core Formation rogue cultivator—had witnessed the might of the Glazed Immortal Lantern in the White Weapons Secret Realm. He knew the artifacts in Xiao Ji’s possession were extraordinary. Thus, the sword they sought must be of celestial grade.  

The three quickened their pace, sprinting when unobserved, and soon reached a mountain near Ping’an City.  

"There’s a mountain here. On the mountain, there’s a temple. In the temple, there’s an old monk..." Xiao Ji pointed ahead solemnly.  

"I heard that nursery rhyme as a child," Fan Dali said. "Honestly, it’s quite dull."  

"Let me finish," Xiao Ji pressed on. "That old monk was drawn here by the city’s thunder. He’s now performing rites for a sword—a Nascent Soul monk. Be cautious."  

"Aren’t Buddhist monks supposed to be compassionate?" Fan Dali questioned.
