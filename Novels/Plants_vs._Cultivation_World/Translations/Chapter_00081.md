# Chapter 81: Divine Ability

After shooing away the infatuated junior sect sister from her room, Chu Feifei began practicing her Breath Concealment technique. She couldn't help but regret her earlier actions—in her panic, she had missed a golden opportunity for rapid cultivation advancement. Now, she had no choice but to master the basics of Breath Concealment quickly so she could approach Gu Mo again. After all, she had promised to request his perfected-level Cleansing Technique to activate her special physique once she grasped the fundamentals.

"Senior Sister Chu! Senior Sister Chu!" Just as Chu Feifei was about to begin her cultivation, the same junior sister she had thrown out came rushing back. "He's here! That inner sect senior brother is here! Let's go see him!"

"No!" Chu Feifei remained unmoved. She had no interest in becoming an inner sect disciple's attendant.

"Senior Sister, please come with me! If I catch that inner sect senior brother's eye, I won't compete with you for that outer sect senior brother anymore," the junior sister pleaded.

"Go by yourself!" Chu Feifei snapped impatiently.

"How stingy!" Seeing that persuasion was futile, the junior sister left in a huff. In her mind, someone of Chu Feifei's caliber stood a high chance of being chosen by the inner sect senior brother. If that happened, she might be able to ride on Chu Feifei's coattails into the inner sect's orbit. She knew her own talent would never take her beyond being a lowly outer sect disciple, but becoming an inner sect senior brother's attendant could change her fate entirely. Compared to some outer sect senior brother, an inner sect one was infinitely more desirable.

At the main hall of the Formation Peak, over a dozen female disciples crowded around a young man. There was no denying his striking appearance—pale, delicate features that blurred the line between masculine and feminine, coupled with a faint, pleasant fragrance that seemed to emanate from his person. Many female disciples were drawn to this androgynous, fair-faced type, especially since this particular inner sect disciple was renowned for his skill in crafting perfumes, which were highly sought after among the female disciples.

"Junior sisters, there's no need to push. There's enough for everyone," Ye Yuqi said with a gentle smile as he handed out small vials of his signature perfume. But behind that warm expression, his eyes remained cold and detached, even tinged with disgust. *How revolting. How dare these foul women come so close?* Blessed—or cursed—with an extraordinarily sensitive nose, Ye Yuqi could detect odors imperceptible to ordinary people. After beginning his cultivation journey, he had stumbled upon a great opportunity during a mission: a fragmentary divine ability called *Nasal Divine Sense*, obtained from a rogue cultivator.

In the world of cultivation, techniques could be categorized into four tiers: spells, secret arts, esoteric methods, and divine abilities. The farming techniques Gu Mo practiced fell under the first category—basic spells, specifically first-tier. Naturally, there were second-tier, third-tier, and even higher-level spells. In terms of raw power, spells weren't necessarily weaker than secret arts or esoteric methods. What made the latter superior were their unique effects and scalability. 

A first-tier spell, even when cast by a Foundation Establishment or Golden Core cultivator, would only be marginally more powerful than when used by a Qi Refining cultivator—it had inherent limits. Secret arts and esoteric methods, while still bounded, had much higher ceilings. A technique mastered during Qi Refining could remain useful even at the Foundation Establishment or Golden Core stages.

But divine abilities were in a league of their own. They were said to be conduits to the very principles of heaven and earth, capable of harnessing the cosmos' boundless power. Naturally, mastering them was exceedingly difficult, often requiring stringent preconditions. Ye Yuqi's unnatural sense of smell perfectly aligned with the requirements of his incomplete Nasal Divine Sense. Despite its fragmentary nature, this ability had propelled him into the upper echelons of the inner sect, making him a strong contender for true disciple status.

With his Nasal Divine Sense, Ye Yuqi could discern a cultivator's cultivation level, physical constitution, and even emotional state through scent alone. The female disciples swarming around him might have appeared glamorous, but to his nose, they reeked—of impure spiritual energy, of bodily impurities. So far, only the top-ranked inner sect disciples didn't stink, their spiritual energy pristine and their bodies free of impurities. Apart from them, only the newly enrolled Junior Sister Yuan and the sect master's personal disciple, Junior Brother He, were odorless. This made Ye Yuqi wary of underestimating them, even if their current cultivation levels were beneath his. Their potential and foundation were undeniable.

"Alright, junior sisters, this senior brother still has other places to visit." After distributing the perfumes, Ye Yuqi prepared to leave. His purpose in coming to Formation Peak was to scout for promising attendants using his Nasal Divine Sense, as it could uncover potential that conventional methods might miss. But such opportunities were rare. Formation Peak was just one stop—he planned to tour the other peaks as well. 

The female disciples understood from his words that none of them had met his standards. Still, receiving a vial of perfume made the trip worthwhile.

"Junior sister!" Having completed her meditation on Breath Concealment, Chu Feifei called out to her attendant, intending to have her submit today's tasks. Chu Feifei often tutored the junior sister in formation stones and inscription techniques, while the latter handled her routine assignments. When Chu Feifei was away, the junior sister would even complete the tasks for her.

But after several calls went unanswered, Chu Feifei sighed. *That girl must still be gawking at that inner sect senior brother.* Remembering the junior sister's earlier excitement, she shook her head in exasperation.

Left with no choice, Chu Feifei headed to the mission hall herself. She was on the cusp of breaking through to the third layer of Qi Refining, and once she did, she would qualify to become a formation master. She couldn't afford to miss deadlines and risk losing this opportunity due to poor evaluations.

"What an unbearable stench!" Ye Yuqi wrinkled his nose as he entered the mission hall, which was packed with outer sect disciples. Their mediocre talents and mundane physiques exuded a stink that turned his stomach. 

*It seems Formation Peak has nothing to offer.* Just as he was about to leave, however, he froze mid-step. His perpetually calm eyes widened in shock. Amid the reek, he had caught a whiff of an extraordinary fragrance—so intoxicating that a single breath seemed to advance his long-stagnant Nasal Divine Sense.

*An opportunity!* The thought flashed through his mind like lightning.
