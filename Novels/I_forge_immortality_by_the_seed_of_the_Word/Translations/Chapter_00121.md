# Chapter 119: The Primordial Tai Shi Realm

As the distance grew closer, the resonance in Zhang Jing's heart grew increasingly stronger. A spark of excitement flashed in his eyes as his flying speed abruptly increased.

Two hours later.

On a dark ironstone island beneath the vaulted sky.

"Those three senior brothers?" Zhang Jing's expression froze momentarily upon landing when he saw three figures seated around the very inheritance he had sensed. "What in the world? Is this inheritance so fickle?" he couldn't help but grumble inwardly.

Zhang Jing nodded.

Qiu Han didn't know how many times he had glanced at Zhang Jing. In the end, this treasure pearl actually tore through the void's chaos, transforming into a small world.

One month!

Zhang Jing suddenly opened his eyes, a gleam flashing through his pupils. "So this is what they meant by unlimited growth potential!" The spiritual light vanished without a trace.

Opposite him, within its depths, mixed emotions churned in his heart.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing."

Zhang Jing's heart stirred.

Boom—

"Is this the so-called treatment for the destined?" Zhang Jing suddenly understood.

"Haha, though I don't know why you suddenly appeared here, Junior Brother, you've truly come to the right place. See this pearl?" The words carried a hint of helplessness.

Yin and Yang began to intertwine, giving rise to the Four Symbols, Five Elements, Eight Trigrams, and other rules that gradually filled this newborn world.

Of course, he knew what this was, but seeing Senior Brother Qiu in high spirits, it wasn't appropriate to say more, so he could only play along.

But this made no sense at all.

That wasn't quite right either.

"Thank you, Senior Brother."

"Tsk, among the nine great inheritances, the requirements for cultivating the Primordial Tai Shi Realm are the highest, and those who master it are the rarest. The various grotto-heavens are bound to stir now."

Originally, Zhang Jing had thought—

Every cultivator of the Primordial Tai Shi Realm would evolve completely different Dao Domains based on their individual comprehension of the Dao and its principles.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing greets the three Senior Brothers."

"Junior Brother, please sit."

Beside him, recalling Elder Ying's previous words, the three seemed to have sensed his arrival long ago, smiling and nodding in unison.

He immediately focused his attention, looking again at the luminous pearl.

To be precise, he didn't dare to.

---

"This must be it," he thought to himself.

What if the other party held a grudge and sought revenge later?

The three of them had discovered this thing four or five months ago. After all this time of study and contemplation, they had gained nothing.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing is here."

A piece of information quietly appeared in his mind.

Above him, an illusory five-colored auspicious cloud slowly rose.

Zhang Jing suddenly realized.

"The Tai Shi Seal!"

Standing beside the three, Zhang Jing spoke neither humbly nor arrogantly.

Back then, he had only casually mentioned it. Who would have thought this junior brother would actually seem to comprehend something?

He didn't know how much time had passed.

Zhang Jing stared intently at the luminous white pearl before him.

Senior Brother Qiu Han said warmly, "Another Celestial Immortal seed is born!"

Countless gazes turned toward the Tenth Void Heaven, toward Zhang Jing, toward the mysterious seal tinged with chaos between his brows.

Comparing this to his experience in the Aurora Magnetic Sea, Zhang Jing couldn't help but shake his head slightly.

Deep within the Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven.

But what did this brief time matter in the face of the vast gap between Golden Nature Dao Foundation and Azure Dao Foundation?

At this moment.

"To perfectly comprehend Dao Intent in just nine months—there's a reason for this."

Zhang Jing's mind was wholly immersed in enlightenment. No matter how others called to him, he couldn't wake.

A wondrous seal of chaotic hue slowly appeared between his brows before fading away.

Following their example, Zhang Jing also sat cross-legged not far from the luminous pearl.

Only the howling wind filled his ears.

The surroundings gradually grew quiet.

The black-robed man said solemnly.

Unbeknownst to Zhang Jing, the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Dao Seed began to tremble violently.

At this thought.

Yet as soon as Junior Brother Zhang arrived, he gained insights?

"Why don't you join us in contemplation, Junior Brother?"

This junior brother could still easily surpass them after ascending to the upper realm.

Putting on airs now—

"Senior Brother can assure you, there's a great opportunity hidden within."

This transformation continued.

"Junior Brother, don't let its plain appearance fool you. This thing is incredibly mystical. It's visible to the naked eye, but spiritual sense detects nothing."

In an instant.

The three's expressions grew even more enthusiastic.

Coming back to himself.

"The Primordial Tai Shi Realm! So this inheritance is called the Primordial Tai Shi Realm!"

His expression was indescribably complex.

Two months!

Time passed slowly.

---

At the very least, they had concluded that "there must be a great opportunity inside."

"Tsk—"

The next moment.

What lay before him was no pearl, but a seed—a seed capable of evolving into a realm world.

Zhang Jing stared fixedly at the luminous pearl, feeling as though something within was powerfully drawing him in.

Zhang Jing responded with a smile.

Even if they had entered the upper realm a hundred and eighty years earlier than him.

Through the Tai Shi True Intent, condense the core of the primordial realm, growing it into a Dao Domain unique to oneself, ultimately evolving into a complete world.

A pure, primal spiritual light suddenly appeared, rapidly expanding to obscure the heavens and support the world.

Another half-month passed.

To this day, the three had realized their superior Dao Foundations had no chance of transformation.

"After missing the Aurora Magnetic Sea, this little fellow actually comprehended the Primordial Tai Shi Realm? Is his fortune truly this terrifying?"

Even with the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Dao Seed, it might take some time this time.

Now.

After leaving the Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven, Junior Brother Zhang Jing would undoubtedly become the treasured protégé of the Dragon Lake Academy's master, peacefully establishing his Golden Nature Dao Foundation.

"Finally mastered it! So this is the so-called 'Primordial Tai Shi Realm.'"

Yet to his surprise, the inheritance revealed its true form as soon as he sat down.

"Could Junior Brother Zhang Jing truly comprehend something?"

After some pleasantries.

His vision blurred momentarily before a familiar sensation quietly arrived.

Only half a month remained before the Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven closed.

The grand voices that had been debating suddenly fell silent.

His gaze turned toward the luminous pearl emitting a soft white glow.

Perhaps millennia, perhaps eons.

He remembered clearly—this was exactly how he had felt when he first glimpsed the true form of the Aurora Magnetic Sea.

A flash of realization crossed Zhang Jing's mind before he sank back into contemplation.

Facing this junior brother, they didn't put on any airs.

In Zhang Jing's sight, the luminous pearl suddenly expanded, instantly transforming into a majestic, vast star.

The gap was simply too large.

"This is it!"

Without Zhang Jing even needing to activate it, the pearl spontaneously emitted an intensely bright five-colored spiritual light, its radiance flowing endlessly, exuding profoundly mysterious implications.

Then, Zhang Jing was seen walking stiffly, step by step, toward the three.

Within his consciousness.
