# Chapter 402: The Ancestor of the Ying Clan, the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix?!

Little Li was afraid that Tian Miao had hit upon one of the traits of a charlatan—where curses tend to come true more often than blessings.

"If this item turns black and hot, it means it has sensed Yin煞 (Yin Evil), indicating that a Ba is nearby. At that time, I will also sense it."

Tian Miao took out a white jade pendant and said solemnly.

She handed the jade pendant to Li Mo.

The group began searching for clues within the underground palace. Tian Miao seemed extremely interested in this ancient structure and took the lead in exploring it.

Her fate did not show any signs of danger, so Li Mo did not propose that the three of them stick together.

Thus.

Li Mo held the clam pearl in one hand and the icy girl's soft hand in the other, carefully searching through the underground palace.

Midway, he attempted to release his Soul Sense to expand the search range. Unfortunately, the underground palace seemed to have a confusing effect on the perception of the Soul Sense. Originally, it could scan a hundred yards in an instant, but now it could only cover a radius of a few yards.

It was more convenient to just use his eyes.

The two walked through the underground palace.

Little Li felt a strong sense of déjà vu, as if he were back in his previous life, going to a haunted house or an escape room with his classmates.

The reason Little Li was a genius was that he had many bold ideas, so he had always been very brave. Every time he was dragged along to play, he found it boring.

Especially when he saw the couples among them, with the girls screaming and throwing themselves into the boys' arms.

But now...

He seemed to suddenly understand where the fun lay.

"Ice Cube!"

Li Mo suddenly turned around with a serious expression, covering the white jade pendant in his chest. "The jade pendant... it seems to be getting hot."

"?"

Hearing this, Ying Bing frowned, her brow furrowed as she looked into the distance. However, she only saw a few statues there.

The style was quite primitive, somewhat similar to the shaman statues seen in the Summoning Demon Sect in the Southern Border.

Where did a Ba come from?

But Little Li spoke with such conviction.

Ying Bing's eyelashes trembled slightly, and her grip on his hand tightened.

"It seems... it doesn't seem to be a Ba..."

Li Mo suddenly said in a terrifying tone, "Is it possible... it's a vengeful spirit?! A ghost trapped in this great tomb for thousands of years, never seeing the light of day again?"

"?"

Ying Bing's face was cold and aloof. She was about to reach for her sword, but found it a bit strange.

Yin Evil Qi is also a type of Yin Qi.

If there were a similar existence, she should have been the first to sense it.

However, her peripheral vision caught the jade pendant in Li Mo's embrace. Through the gaps in his fingers, it was clearly still pure white.

The jade pendant hadn't changed color.

That meant unless...

Ying Bing stared seriously at Li Mo. She saw that upon meeting her mirror-like eyes, Little Li's first reaction was to look to the left. He always did that when he was being guilty.

"...... I saw it too."

"Huh?"

The serious Li Mo was stunned.

The Ice Cube wasn't supposed to get nervous and stick close to him, asking fearfully where the ghost was, was she?

The development of the situation seemed a bit off!

"You... you really saw it?"

"Yes, really. And it's getting closer and closer." Ying Bing's cold face was completely serious.

"!"

Little Li leaned back slightly.

Originally, he was quite brave because he was a staunch materialist in his previous life. But the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands were different from his previous world. Since things like Ba exist, it seems quite reasonable for ghosts to exist too...

Moreover, the Ice Cube had a cold expression, her lips slightly parted.

It inexpurably gave a feeling of 'don't say I didn't warn you'...

Right, she has the Body of the Moon Phoenix of Great Yin, which is extremely sensitive to Yin Qi. Could it be!

"It's here."

Ying Bing suddenly looked behind Li Mo!

Li Mo shivered, turned around and shielded the Ice Cube behind him, pressing her tightly against his back. He raised the 'Forty' in his hand.

But that place was empty, with only a few primitive statues in the style of the Summoning Demon Sect.

---

"Nothing at all..."

"Maybe... I saw wrong."

"?"

Ying Bing's face was buried in his shoulder. She originally thought Li Mo was deliberately scaring her, so she decided to scare him back.

Then she planned to look at Li Mo with a half-smile, making him behave.

But before she could show that half-smile, her face was suddenly buried in Li Mo's shoulder. She suddenly found his silly样子 (appearance/manner) not so funny anymore.

"Saw wrong?"

After being puzzled, Li Mo caught on. He suspected that the 'bad' Ice Cube had just come online, but he had no evidence.

He was about to speak, but a shout came from the direction Tian Miao had gone.

"I found something, come take a look!"

"Coming right away!"

Li Mo responded. With this distraction, he didn't have time to ask further.

Ice Cube got away with it √

However, the two had not walked far.

*Creak, creak—*

A slight sound came from the statues in the darkness. The surface was shedding in rustles.

One of the statues, the stone shell covering its eyes peeled off, suddenly revealing a ghostly green, bloodthirsty light.

...

Li Mo held Ying Bing's hand, and the two quickly found Tian Miao. She was standing in front of a mural.

The mural was actually painted with Kirin Smoke Ink. After so many years, it still retained its bright colors, making the depicted scenes vivid and lifelike.

The first mural depicted a great crack splitting the heavens and earth, floods surging, the sun extinguishing, and stars falling. The scene was like the end of the world.

"This depicts... the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands! This is a major discovery."

"Our Nine Heavens and Ten Lands很有可能 (very likely) experienced a cataclysm, to the point of being on the verge of destruction."

Tian Miao looked at the mural, her calm tone unable to hide her excitement.

This was history that had been sealed away, not recorded in any of the texts of the Heavenly Derivation Sect.

Li Mo and Ying Bing exchanged a glance, seeing the solemnity in each other's eyes.

They had seen a similar scene in the Jade Phoenix God.

Strong experts left the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands one by one. When they left, they took away the 'Dao' they had refined, creating gaps in this world.

Thus, many innate beings sacrificed themselves to mend the Dao, such as the innate Golden Crow.

And the master of the Jade Phoenix God, the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix, traveled the world, preserving the sparks of life for each being.

"Is the mural recording what happened after that?"

"Did the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands eventually collapse?"

The amount of information was overwhelming. Li Mo took a deep breath.

But the heavens and earth of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands today are clearly safe and sound.

Obviously, the mural wasn't finished yet.

Holding the glowing clam pearl, the three searched to the side and果然 (sure enough) saw another mural.

The second mural showed nine people wearing strange clothes descending from the great hole in the sky. Beside them crouched countless beings, bowing in worship to them.

Among the nine, a woman took the lead.

She wore a gown of flowing light and color, exuding an aura of natural tranquility. Her expression was serene and compassionate.

"!"

That gentle woman they had seen in the Jade Phoenix God, her gentle and compassionate aura was unique in the world.

Her face seemed to slowly become clear at this moment.

At the same time, it also overlapped slowly with the already dilapidated statue in the Ying Clan's ancestral hall.

"Is she... the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix?"

"And also... the Ancestor of the Ying Clan?!"

Li Mo's scalp went numb, and a thunderclap flashed through his mind.

The small hand in his palm, Ying Bing's hand, suddenly curled up. Clearly, Ying Bing's heart was also surging with shock.

PS: The little failure is really awesome, writing a suspenseful story in a romance genre. Let me puff out my chest for a moment.
Please, esteemed viewers, give me some support, hehe.
