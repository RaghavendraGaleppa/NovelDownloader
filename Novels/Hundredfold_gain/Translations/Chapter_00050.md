# Chapter 50: Three Hundred and Ten Spirit Stones, First-Grade Talisman Crafting Legacy (Seeking Collections)

"One hundred and eighty low-grade spirit stones? That's too low!"

Upon hearing the old man's offer, Qi Chuan shook his head, picked up the partially damaged top-grade magical artifact from the counter, and made as if to take it back and refuse the sale.

Seeing this, the old man realized he couldn't easily deceive Qi Chuan and, fearing he might back out of the deal, quickly said, "The esteemed guest finds the price unsatisfactory? We can negotiate, we can negotiate..."

"One thousand low-grade spirit stones, and this partially damaged top-grade magical artifact is yours," Qi Chuan said expressionlessly, immediately raising the price to a thousand.

"One thousand low-grade spirit stones? Impossible! Even if we sold the entire Qingfeng Pavilion, we couldn't gather that much! At most, two hundred low-grade spirit stones..."

The old man seemed startled, nearly jumping in shock, his face turning red as he spoke.

Qi Chuan was well aware that this partially damaged top-grade magical artifact wasn't worth that much. 

Generally, the lowest-grade top-tier magical artifacts were priced around a thousand low-grade spirit stones, while the finest could fetch two to three thousand. 

This particular artifact had all its inscribed talisman arrays destroyed, leaving only about half of its primary and secondary materials intact. 

Moreover, Qi Chuan happened to know a bit about the primary material used—Blue Silver Silk Iron. 

Magical artifacts forged with this material were neither the worst nor the best—they were average at best. 

Thus, even if the remaining materials were extracted, they would only be worth a few hundred low-grade spirit stones at most. 

Qi Chuan had initially set an exorbitant price as a bargaining tactic.

After some haggling, they finally settled on three hundred and ten low-grade spirit stones. 

This price met Qi Chuan's expectations. The shop would still make a small profit, though they'd have to extract the materials themselves, while Qi Chuan could quickly convert the artifact into usable resources. 

It was a mutually beneficial arrangement.

"At this price, our Qingfeng Pavilion is taking quite a loss this time..."

As they exchanged the spirit stones and the artifact, the old man wore a pained expression. 

Qi Chuan ignored him, simply tucking the pouch of spirit stones into his robe before descending to the third floor under the old man's watchful gaze.

"The Qingfeng Pavilion has quite the operation, able to take in even a damaged top-grade magical artifact."

Exiting the Qingfeng Pavilion and stepping back onto the market street, Qi Chuan glanced back at the shop's signboard, musing to himself.

Given the state of the market, he had initially thought selling the artifact would be impossible and had resigned himself to taking it back to his sect for another time. 

To his surprise, the Qingfeng Pavilion had not only accepted it but also offered a decent price.

---

To be clear, three hundred and ten low-grade spirit stones was a price at which the Qingfeng Pavilion might earn a small profit, but certainly not a large one.

"Perhaps the Qingfeng Pavilion, being the best shop in this market, has the resources to handle such transactions," Qi Chuan muttered, shaking his head.

With one last glance at the pavilion, he put the matter aside for now and headed toward the market exit.

As he walked, he passed by stalls set up by rogue cultivators lining the street. 

On his way in, he hadn't paid them much attention, focused first on selling the damaged artifact. 

Now, on his way out, he took the opportunity to browse casually. Though the goods on these stalls were often shoddy, there was always a chance of stumbling upon a hidden gem.

But reality proved otherwise.

After passing numerous stalls, Qi Chuan found nothing of value. 

Most of the rogue cultivators were selling low-grade magical artifacts, first-grade low-tier talismans, and similar items. 

Many of the low-grade artifacts showed noticeable signs of wear and tear. 

As for the talismans, most were basic elemental spells—Fireball Talismans, Water Arrow Talismans, Golden Skin Talismans, Earth Wall Talismans, and Vine Talismans. Even Invisibility Talismans were rare. 

In other words, they were talismans inscribed with the most fundamental elemental spells. 

These were likely crafted by the rogue cultivators themselves—crudely made and probably weaker than the talismans his second uncle had once given him.

"Sigh... it seems hoping for a lucky find is futile..."

With a quiet sigh, Qi Chuan was about to leave when his gaze suddenly caught on one of the stalls. 

His eyes paused, then returned to a particular rogue cultivator's display.

"What's this...?"

At this stall, each item for sale had a wooden placard with a description. 

In one corner, a seemingly ordinary booklet had a placard with hastily scrawled words: *First-Grade Talisman Crafting Legacy*.

"A First-Grade Talisman Crafting Legacy? How is that possible...?"

Staring at the messy handwriting, Qi Chuan was dumbfounded. 

Shouldn't a talisman crafting legacy be a rare and valuable treasure? How could it be casually displayed for sale on a street stall in the market? 

It seemed too absurd to be true. 

Still, curiosity got the better of him, and he hesitantly approached the stall.

"What do you want?"

The stall owner was a burly, middle-aged rogue cultivator whose appearance and demeanor made him look more like a village farmer than a cultivator. 

Unlike the polite and courteous staff at the Qingfeng Pavilion, the man spoke loudly and bluntly, his voice booming.

"May I take a look at this First-Grade Talisman Crafting Legacy?" Qi Chuan pointed to the booklet and asked directly.

"Sure, but don't take too long," the man replied indifferently.

Qi Chuan found this even more puzzling, but since permission was granted, he waved his hand, and the booklet floated into his palm.

"So this is a talisman crafting legacy?"

Filled with curiosity, Qi Chuan flipped through the pages. 

Soon, lines of text appeared before his eyes:

[You briefly skim through the First-Grade Talisman Crafting Legacy, attempting to comprehend the method for crafting Fireball Talismans. Triggering a 5x critical effect, you gain fivefold rewards—your understanding of Fireball Talisman crafting improves slightly.]

[You briefly skim through the First-Grade Talisman Crafting Legacy, attempting to comprehend the method for crafting Water Arrow Talismans. Triggering a 6x critical effect, you gain sixfold rewards—your understanding of Water Arrow Talisman crafting improves slightly.]

[...]

As Qi Chuan continued flipping through the pages, more lines appeared, all related to the basic elemental spell talismans. 

At the same time, his mind absorbed fragments of talisman-crafting knowledge. 

After digesting this information, he glanced back at the stall, which was littered with crudely made first-grade low-tier Fireball Talismans, Water Arrow Talismans, and the like. 

Combined with the contents of the "First-Grade Talisman Crafting Legacy" in his hands—which only contained simple crafting methods, instructions for creating five types of basic talismans, and some messy, hastily scribbled notes—Qi Chuan quickly pieced together the truth.

He looked at the burly rogue cultivator and asked, "Did you write this First-Grade Talisman Crafting Legacy yourself? And are these first-grade low-tier elemental talismans on your stall also your own work?"

"Yep!" 

The farmer-like man nodded enthusiastically, then reached behind himself and pulled out another stack of booklets. 

With an earnest expression, he asked hopefully, "Want to buy some? I’ve got plenty more of these First-Grade Talisman Crafting Legacies—all written by me. If you're interested, I’ll sell them to you for one low-grade spirit stone each. I can even sell you the whole lot!"
