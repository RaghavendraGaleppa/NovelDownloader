## Chapter 8: Farewell

The world was not just comprised of places like the Rotating Light Sect. Beyond the vast expanse of the land, there existed numerous martial arts groups and clans, complex and intertwined, their origins a tangled web of stories. The closest ones to Dongxiang Village were the Hai Sha Gang, a massive organization of nearly 100,000 members that had risen to prominence along the canal, and the Qi Xuan Gate, a sworn enemy of the Hai Sha Gang, known for their martial prowess and dagger-wielding disciples.

The leader of the Qi Xuan Gate, Qing Xuan, had achieved great mastery in internal energy cultivation. His Seven Mystic Techniques were highly refined, and he had founded the sect hundreds of years ago. Now in its seventh generation, the sect had grown significantly but was currently weakened.

The two groups had been embroiled in a longstanding feud, with countless skirmishes and casualties over the years. Three months prior, the Qi Xuan Gate had discovered a copper mine on the border of the Hai Sha Gang's territory and began secretly extracting it. However, when the Hai Sha Gang found out, they launched a surprise attack on the mine, killing over 100 people, including more than 40 Qi Xuan Gate disciples guarding the mine.

The Qi Xuan Gate retaliated, and both sides invested a massive force of over 80,000 people. The resulting battle was brutal, with so many deaths that the mountains were filled with corpses and the canal's flow was disrupted.

Due to the heavy casualties, both sides had tacitly agreed to a temporary truce and were now focusing on recuperation.

A group of over a dozen riders burst into a small village with only about 100 households. The villagers, simple farmers who kept to themselves, were no match for these martial artists. The riders quickly searched the village and eventually gathered at the entrance.

At the eastern edge of the village, there were remains of a house that had long since fallen into disrepair. The walls had crumbled, and the area had become overgrown with weeds. A lone withered jujube tree stood at the entrance, to which a fine steed was tethered. Yang Jingshan, a prominent figure in the Qi Xuan Gate, sat on a stone, awaiting his men.

As Yang Jingshan and his men arrived, they had found only three households with children of suitable age. A rider approached Yang Jingshan and reported the findings.

Yang Jingshan frowned, then nodded. "Very well, bring them here."

Li Jiujiu, holding his young son, Xiao Si, approached with a look of fear. Surrounding them were over a dozen Qi Xuan Gate disciples, all with their swords drawn.

The scene was chaotic, and Li Jiujiu, having visited the county yamen before, felt a chill run down his spine.

Yang Jingshan introduced himself as a leader in the Qi Xuan Gate and explained their presence. He mentioned that they were there to select children of suitable age.

The villagers were initially terrified, thinking they were bandits. However, upon hearing Yang's introduction, they began to relax.

Yang Jingshan examined the children, his expression growing increasingly disappointed. These children seemed ordinary, lacking the spark that would make them exceptional martial artists.

However, given the current state of the Qi Xuan Gate, they could not afford to be picky. "Those who are chosen will receive five taels of silver per year while they are young," Yang Jingshan explained. "As they grow older, they will receive three taels. Perhaps one day, they will hold an official position, with a salary much greater than that."

The villagers exchanged worried glances. The youngest child, a scrawny boy with a hint of cunning in his eyes, seemed intrigued by Yang's words.

As Yang Jingshan finished speaking, he casually struck a nearby crumbling wall with his palm, causing it to collapse. The sudden display of power left the villagers intimidated.

Sensing the atmosphere, Yang Jingshan asked, his expression tinged with impatience, "So, what do you say?"

Li Jiujiu's child looked up at him with a glimmer of interest. However, upon examining Yang's and his disciples' fate grids, Li Jiujiu felt a pang of disappointment. Their grids were pale, indicating only a faint connection to martial arts.

The villagers were eventually given a short ultimatum: they had one quarter of an hour to make their decision. Yang Jingshan was eager to move on to the next village.

As the deadline loomed, the villagers reluctantly agreed, though their farewells were sorrowful. Li Jiujiu's wife, Zhang, held their child and wept uncontrollably.

The child, still too young to understand the gravity of the situation, was eventually taken away. As Li Jiujiu watched his child being lifted onto a horse, he seemed to remember something and rushed over to hand his son a small beast he had been keeping.

Holding his son's hand, Li Jiujiu wept. "My child, take this with you. It's what I promised you. Remember to think of home when you're out there. I'll catch rabbits for you when you return."

In that moment, something within the child seemed to click, and he began to cry, calling out for his father and mother.
