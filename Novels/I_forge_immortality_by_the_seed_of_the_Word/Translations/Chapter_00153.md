# Chapter 150: Yan Chihong

"Hmm? Is there a problem?" Zhang Jing asked in surprise, his voice tinged with confusion.

Opposite him, Ya'er's stunning face still bore an expression of astonishment that refused to fade. A thought suddenly struck her: 

Foundation Establishment realm, a Dao Mark between his brows, and seemingly visiting the Multiverse Auction House for the first time—this must be a newly accepted disciple of one of the True Lords from the Supreme Unity Infinite Dao Sect. 

The key point—he hadn't immediately denied it. 

This only further confirmed her judgment!

A glimmer of excitement flashed in the eyes of the Natural Spirit Ya'er.

The next moment.

"Honored guest, I sincerely apologize, but could you wait for a moment? My master wishes to meet you," Ya'er said hopefully, looking at Zhang Jing.

"Your master?"

Meeting her gaze, a trace of hesitation flickered across Zhang Jing's face before he returned to calmness. He nodded and replied evenly, "Very well."

This was the Radiant Light Immortal Realm—in a way, his own territory. What was there to fear?

"Thank you, honored guest," Ya'er said gratefully before her figure gradually faded away.

Left alone in the room, Zhang Jing turned his attention back to the auction information displayed before him.

The Longevity Rejuvenation Elixir had already disappeared, replaced by a faint line of text:

"Longevity Rejuvenation Elixir (Three Drops) auction has concluded. Sold for 1,050,000 units of Fortune. Would you like to claim it? Note: The Multiverse Auction House will deduct one ten-thousandth of the transaction value."

Seeing this, Zhang Jing's eyes flickered slightly.

This Multiverse Auction House was truly a lucrative business! 

Taking a ten-thousandth cut from each transaction might seem insignificant, but the sheer volume was staggering. He noticed that in the short half-hour since he'd entered the auction house, hundreds of thousands of transactions had already been completed—and this was just what he could see. It might not even be the tip of the iceberg.

With such terrifying transaction volumes, even a ten-thousandth cut would amount to an astronomical sum for the auction house!

With a thought, Zhang Jing communicated with the auction house again, conveying his desire to purchase River of Time Golden Sand or similar treasures.

Instantly, the scene before him and around him transformed.

A dense array of auction information appeared in an instant.

"So many?!" Zhang Jing's heart leaped with joy.

The more auction listings there were, the more common the item must be. For Zhang Jing, who wanted to upgrade his Primordial Beginning Realm skill, this was undoubtedly the best possible news.

He looked around directly.

"River of Time Golden Sand (Ten Grains). Note: A rare treasure from the secret realm [River of Time's End], containing faint traces of time power. Can be used to cultivate divine abilities or comprehend the Dao of Time. Current bid: 891 units of Fortune. Immediate purchase price: 1,100 units of Fortune. Remaining auction time: 15 days."

"River of Time Golden Sand (Three Grains). Current bid: 277 units of Fortune. Immediate purchase price: 330 units of Fortune. Remaining auction time: 9 days."

The overwhelming auction information nearly dazzled Zhang Jing's eyes. However, through this, he managed to discern the true value of River of Time Golden Sand—each grain was worth about 100 units of Fortune.

"From this perspective, exchanging Spirit Essence for River of Time Golden Sand in the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Virtual Heaven was taking advantage of the Dao Sect's generosity," Zhang Jing mused silently.

After all, a mere hundred thousand or so units of Spirit Essence couldn't compare to 100 units of Fortune in either value or difficulty of acquisition!

Returning to reality, Zhang Jing watched the constantly refreshing auction listings for River of Time Golden Sand, with their continuously fluctuating prices, and found himself in a dilemma.

He couldn't possibly stay here monitoring them indefinitely. But if he didn't keep watch, his bids might be overtaken by others, rendering his efforts futile. This bidding method was far too inefficient.

As for directly paying the immediate purchase price—on one hand, Zhang Jing was reluctant to part with the Fortune. On the other hand, he didn't want to be taken for a fool. 

Having observed for so long, he noticed that not a single transaction for River of Time Golden Sand had been completed at the immediate purchase price. What this implied was crystal clear to him.

Just then, a glimmer of light at the corner of his eye caught his attention.

The moment he saw it clearly, his eyes widened involuntarily.

"River of Time Golden Crystal (Weight: Nine Taels and Seven Maces). Note: A rare treasure crystal from the secret realm [River of Time's End], containing vast amounts of time power. Can be used to cultivate divine abilities or comprehend the Dao of Time. Current bid: 130 million units of Fortune. Immediate purchase price: 300 million units of Fortune. Remaining auction time: 9 months."

Zhang Jing's gaze fixed intently on the River of Time Golden Crystal, his breathing unconsciously growing heavier. This item would undoubtedly accelerate the upgrade of his Primordial Beginning Realm skill!

But when he noticed the terrifying bid price below...

He couldn't afford it!

Zhang Jing quickly averted his gaze, not daring to look any longer.

"So poor!" he lamented inwardly.

His two experiences in the Radiant Light Immortal Realm had made him face a harsh reality—he was poor!

Although he received a million units of Fortune annually from the Crimson Radiance Great Vastness Grotto-Heaven, it was still far from enough compared to the prices of truly valuable treasures.

Just as Zhang Jing was lost in his thoughts, a hearty voice suddenly came from behind him:

"Junior Brother, have you taken a liking to some treasure?"

Zhang Jing instinctively turned around.

Before him stood a burly Taoist with a thick beard, dressed in a pink robe. His rough and fierce appearance contrasted sharply with the warmth in his eyes—an extreme contradiction that left a strong first impression.

"Is this the 'master' the Natural Spirit mentioned earlier?" Zhang Jing wondered briefly before replying, "Just browsing, Senior Brother. May I ask how I should address you?"

"Haha! This senior brother is named Yan Chihong. I heard from my subordinates that a True Lord's disciple had entered the Multiverse Auction House for the first time, so I came specially to greet you. I hope you don't mind. May I ask your name, Junior Brother?" the burly Taoist explained heartily as he walked toward Zhang Jing.

"This junior is Zhang Jing. Greetings, Senior Brother Yan," Zhang Jing responded calmly, though his heart tightened slightly.

He couldn't sense any aura from this senior brother, yet the man gave him a faintly terrifying impression—similar to Senior Brother Feng Wuyu, though much weaker in comparison. Still, he was likely a Harmony Dao True Immortal!

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, forgive this senior brother's bluntness, but may I ask who your master is?" Yan Chihong asked directly.

"I wouldn't dare deceive you, Senior Brother. This junior currently studies under True Lord Yuanming," Zhang Jing answered truthfully.

There was no need to hide this—all registered disciples of the Crimson Radiance Great Vastness Grotto-Heaven knew it. Anyone who wanted to find out wouldn't have much difficulty.

Opposite him, Yan Chihong's eyes widened involuntarily.

"True Lord Yuanming, the Supreme Yang Venerable?!"
