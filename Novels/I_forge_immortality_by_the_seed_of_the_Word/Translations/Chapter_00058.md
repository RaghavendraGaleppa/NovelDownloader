# Chapter 58: I Want to Exchange for a Spot

Facing the hopeful gaze of the woman outside his door, Zhang Jing couldn't help but show a flicker of surprise in his eyes.

He was naturally familiar with her. His rapid breakthrough to the mid-stage of Qi Refinement was partly thanks to the Mist-Root Water Ginseng he had obtained from her just a few days prior. Yet, in merely three or four days, she had returned, wanting to sell more Mist-Root Water Ginseng? When had such a rare spiritual herb become as common as cabbage?

With this thought in mind, Zhang Jing spoke softly, "Come in. Of course, I'll take the Mist-Root Water Ginseng."

"Thank you, Honored Cultivator," the woman replied nervously, following Zhang Jing cautiously into the shop.

At the table, she took a deep breath and directly retrieved two five-inch-long Mist-Root Water Ginsengs from her storage pouch. A faint mist immediately filled the air. These two ginsengs were even older than the previous one, their extraordinary fragrance so rich that within moments, it seemed to permeate every pore of Zhang Jing's body. The flow of spiritual energy within him became noticeably more active.

Zhang Jing lowered his gaze, briefly scanning the ginsengs before settling his eyes on the woman's face. "What do you want in exchange?" he asked solemnly.

Without hesitation, she answered, "Honored Cultivator, I'd like to exchange these two Mist-Root Water Ginsengs for some Purple Spirit Pills and talismans."

"That's easily arranged," Zhang Jing said, producing a bottle of Purple Spirit Pills. "These two fifty-year-old Mist-Root Water Ginsengs are worth about eighty Dao merits. I'll give you this bottle of Purple Spirit Pills for twelve Dao merits. The prices for talismans are marked on the counter—you can choose what you need."

He then added, pulling out two mid-grade talismans from his storage space, "You can also exchange for mid-grade talismans. The defensive ones are eighteen Dao merits each, and the offensive ones are twelve."

"Thank you, Honored Cultivator," the woman said with a deep bow, her voice filled with gratitude.

Over the past few days, she had cautiously inquired around the market, gradually gaining a clear understanding of the value of these two ginsengs. It was then she realized just how fair this Honored Cultivator was—he hadn't tried to take advantage of her at all. This thought reminded her of the rumors that had been spreading like wildfire in the market recently...

Before long, the woman carefully stored away the pills and talismans, particularly the mid-grade defensive talisman, which she placed with utmost care in the deepest part of her storage pouch. Once everything was settled, she began stealing glances at Zhang Jing, her eyes betraying a hint of hesitation.

Her conflicted demeanor didn't escape Zhang Jing's notice. He sensed that the main topic was about to be broached. From the moment he first saw her, he had noticed the hesitation in her eyes, as if she was wrestling with a difficult decision. What secret could a rogue cultivator possibly have? It must be related to the source of her ginsengs. Yet, Zhang Jing remained silent, simply watching her with a faint smile.

As time passed, the woman's expression grew increasingly resolute. Finally, gritting her teeth, she spoke in a trembling voice, "Honored Cultivator, I know of a place of opportunity. These Mist-Root Water Ginsengs were picked from its outskirts. Inside, there are many more spiritual herbs like these, some even more precious."

At these words, Zhang Jing's heart jolted. He had considered the possibility that the woman might have discovered a growth site for the ginsengs and was holding a stockpile she wanted to sell to him. But now, it seemed she knew of a place resembling a medicinal garden—and the Mist-Root Water Ginsengs were among the most common herbs there!

Suppressing his shock, Zhang Jing maintained his composure. "What's your name?" he asked.

"Pei Xiaoshuang," the woman replied.

"Fellow Daoist Pei, are you saying you wish to exchange this opportunity for a promise from me?" Zhang Jing reiterated.

The woman nodded firmly. "What kind of promise?"

"I beg you to promise me a spot as a disciple of the Dao Academy! Whether it takes ten years or twenty, I can wait!" In that moment, Pei Xiaoshuang finally voiced her deepest desire, her eyes burning with determination.

On the other hand, Zhang Jing didn't rush to respond, silently weighing the situation. Firstly, her request wasn't particularly difficult for him, especially since it wasn't time-bound. From what he knew, some current outer court disciples hadn't entered the Dragon Lake Dao Academy through the examination process like he had, but through connections with inner court seniors. This suggested that the inner court held some authority over admissions—or perhaps, to them, an outer court disciple's status was insignificant enough that they could arrange it with minimal effort.

As for whether he himself would enter the inner court, Zhang Jing had no doubts—it was only a matter of time. Thus, the real question was whether her information was worth an outer court disciple spot.

"First, why did you come to me?" Zhang Jing asked expressionlessly.

At this, Pei Xiaoshuang's face lit up with hope. The fact that the Honored Cultivator hadn't outright refused meant there was a real chance she could enter the academy! After a moment's thought, she answered earnestly, "Honored Cultivator, when you first bought the ginseng from me, I sensed you were a true cultivator of the Dao. Our second transaction only confirmed my judgment."

She paused before continuing, "More importantly, you managed to make all the other talisman shops in the market lower their prices. That speaks to your extraordinary capabilities. And you seem quite young, so..."

"So you think I might have the means to help you enter the academy in the future?" Zhang Jing finished for her.

"Exactly," Pei Xiaoshuang admitted, lowering her head nervously.

"How many spiritual herbs are there in that place? And I assume it's not as simple as you're making it out to be?" Zhang Jing asked, his gaze piercing.

"You see right through me, Honored Cultivator," Pei Xiaoshuang said with a bitter smile. "There's a deer demon there, terrifyingly powerful. I could only watch from afar, waiting until it had eaten its fill and fallen asleep before daring to pick a few ginsengs from the outskirts."

"Does anyone else know about this place?" Zhang Jing pressed.

"No," she shook her head emphatically. "The location is extremely well-hidden. Ordinary people would never find it. I only stumbled upon it by sheer chance."

"And how many herbs are there?"

"At least several hundred. The closer to the center, the more precious they become."

To emphasize her honesty, Pei Xiaoshuang raised her hand and swore, "I swear on my life that every word I've said is true. If I've lied even slightly, may my soul scatter and my death be wretched!"

Hearing her oath, a peculiar light flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. So there truly was a hidden place with hundreds of valuable spiritual herbs, worth at least several thousand Dao merits.

After brief consideration, he made his decision. "I swear on my Dao heart that if what you say is true, I will grant you a spot as a Dao Academy disciple in the future."
