Chapter 65: Parents' Decision

In this frigid winter night, even Xu Sheng, the wandering merchant, broke out in a cold sweat. He knew the wilderness intimately, and naturally, held it in greater reverence.

He realized that today, something "big" was definitely happening!

Many people panicked, filled with fear of the unknown. If they understood, if they knew the truth, perhaps they wouldn't be so afraid. The most crucial factor was the pitch-black environment, which intensified their unease; even stretching one's hand in front of their eyes yielded nothing.

Now, many were effectively blind, their life, death, and future not within their own control, leaving them at the mercy of fate.

Qin Ming was slightly better off, able to vaguely perceive nearby objects. He remained calm, gripping his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade, ready to strike at any moment!

Suddenly, a woman's sobbing came from behind, making many people's hearts pound.

"I'm sorry..." the woman cried.

"Then let me go. My neck is bleeding a lot, and my head is about to fall off," the man said hoarsely and weakly.

...

Not far from the wandering merchant's convoy, Cui Hong was drenched in sweat. After luring away the old elephant, he quietly returned. He had reached an agreement with the old elephant, confirming that Cui Chongyi would not be in mortal danger, so he came back first to catch up with Cui Chonghe, who was close by.

Cui Hong knew some things about the wilderness, but at his level, as long as he didn't court death, passing through the fringe areas was no problem. He walked along the mountain wall, yet somehow found himself circling the same spot several times. He quickly chanted a Heart-Purifying Incantation and activated a powerful secret art, finally able to move forward again.

But when Cui Hong inadvertently looked back, his scalp tightened. Something was following him from behind. In the dense, boundless night fog behind him, there was a pair of enormous eyes, indifferent and ruthless, their cold light piercing through the mist. The two eyeballs were as large as houses, drawing closer!

He couldn't discern the unknown creature's body outline, but he surmised its size must be immense. Cui Hong felt a chill. Even as powerful as he was, if he hadn't accidentally looked back, he wouldn't have noticed it beforehand. In front of that creature, there was also a small, blood-colored lantern, comparable in size to those hung outside wealthy households. Yet, it pierced through the night fog, as if someone was holding it, guiding the colossal creature.

Cui Hong dared not delay and sped up. He had never encountered such a situation. If this thing emerged from the depths of the wilderness, he had no confidence at all.

The night fog grew thicker, threatening to strip Cui Hong of his five senses, even clouding his sharp spiritual perception. He even accidentally fell from the rugged mountain path into the wilderness. He felt something was off; his feet were wet and sticky, and there were steaming water marks on the sand, which he had stepped on.

Cui Hong quickly leaped back onto the mountain path, his face grim. He actually smelled a strong odor of urine from his feet. Who did this?

At this moment, the wilderness became even more abnormal. The dense fog undulated like surging ocean waves. When Cui Hong looked back again, he found the pair of enormous eyes were very close to him! And under the illumination of the blood-colored lantern, he could vaguely discern it was a gigantic white-furred creature.

"Its speed is much faster than mine, extremely dangerous. It... can catch up to me!" Cui Hong realized the severity of the situation.

However, as the strange phenomenon appeared in the wilderness, the white-furred creature squinted its eyes, then unexpectedly turned and ran away. The blood-colored lantern also receded, rapidly dimming.

...

"糟糕, the wilderness seems to have been offended." Xu Sheng was startled and uncertain. Such a situation was rare; who would dare to be so presumptuous in such a place?

In the boundless wilderness, thick fog surged like ocean waves, crashing against the cliffs on one side. It was precisely because of this that Xu Sheng re-determined their direction.

"What do we do?"

"Don't panic, this doesn't concern us!" Xu Sheng said, calming everyone.

At this moment, even the woman's sobbing ceased, and the group holding torches in front also dimmed, about to vanish.

Suddenly, someone trembled and said, "Brother Xu, something is touching my ankle. It's covered in stiff fur and has torn my clothes."

He wasn't the only one; several others felt it. Qin Ming vaguely saw a small creature and was about to swing his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade.

"No one move recklessly!" Xu Sheng ordered. Then, he fell silent, because it was his turn to be rubbed against by a creature as if he were a tree stump.

"We'll go up the mountain!" He knew they wouldn't be able to leave the fringe of this wilderness before the shallow night ended.

The group quickly climbed, following a gentler slope, reaching the lowest mountain cliff nearby, which was still nearly a thousand meters high. Xu Sheng said, "We'll rest here tonight and resume our journey tomorrow after the fog disperses."

"Let's travel through the mountains," someone suggested, truly terrified by the wilderness.

Xu Sheng shook his head, saying, "The mountains ahead are thousands of meters high, and each territory has dangerous aberrant beings. We merchants never attempt to cross this mountain range."

To everyone's surprise, the man who had weakly claimed his neck was breaking earlier was not dead, merely bleeding quite a bit. After climbing the cliff, he looked as if he had seen a ghost, avoiding the woman shrouded in a grey robe.

"I'm sorry, it's my first time on a long journey, and I was too nervous. I accidentally scratched you."

"No... problem!" The man recoiled.

The young boy, however, turned pale, quietly lowering his head to look at the few long black hairs in his hand. When the cold wind howled, he even caught sight of fur beneath the woman's grey robe. The night wasn't as thick here, and the boy wasn't sure if he had seen correctly, but he dared not observe further.

"It's good that everyone is fine." Xu Sheng breathed a sigh of relief. As a merchant who often led long journeys, it was normal for some aberrant beings to occasionally appear in his convoy. Earlier, when they restocked in the small town, Xu Sheng had told them they might have to sleep outdoors for two or three nights. Although everyone felt that the merchant was deliberately "generating income," they had no choice but to buy expensive tents in that small town.

Late at night, Qin Ming was woken by snoring. He swiftly drew his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade, on high alert. This was utterly absurd—how could there be an extra person in his tent? There was someone else's snoring! In an instant, Qin Ming followed the sound and discovered who it was.

It was a pig!

Qin Ming had already lit a tinder stick, clearly seeing it—a very small pig, only slightly longer than his palm. At this moment, the pig was also startled and stared at Qin Ming, eye to eye. Though this wild pig was small, it was abnormal; a pair of snow-white tusks had already grown outside its mouth, a state not normal for a piglet.

The small wild pig, barely larger than a palm, actually bared its teeth and grinned, startling Qin Ming so much he nearly slashed it with his blade, but he held back, because this was too unusual. In fact, he felt that nothing that had happened near the wilderness today had been normal.

He stared closely and noticed some black scales on the pig's face, which looked somewhat familiar. Then, he remembered the time he had hunted a Knife-Horned Deer and a Donkey-Headed Wolf in the mountains shortly after recovering from his severe illness. He had discovered a wild pig far larger than its kin, weighing over a thousand five hundred to six hundred jin, charging around like mad and even chasing him for a while. That day, when the Moonworm appeared, the giant wild pig had trembled, retreated quietly, and buried itself in the accumulated snow. That giant pig also had black scales on its face, very similar to the one before him now.

However, while that giant wild pig was a mutated creature, its beast nature was extremely strong and it seemed far from being "enlightened" or having any spiritual awareness. The small pig before him, though very similar in appearance to the large one, did not have a crazy, bestial look in its eyes; instead, its gaze was remarkably profound. Though it looked small, Qin Ming always felt it was more like an old mountain pig.

Qin Ming did not act rashly. After staring at the small pig for a moment, he put away his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade and voluntarily retreated to the edge of the tent. Soon, earth-shaking snores filled the tent.

The next day, the fog was indeed less dense. Xu Sheng sighed in relief as he took attendance, for so far, there had been no casualties, both humans and aberrants were alive. Qin Ming noticed that some people looked at him with resentment, even indignation.

A middle-aged man looked at him and said, "Young man, you look so refined, how can you make such a big 'commotion' when you sleep? In the middle of the night, I mistakenly thought it was thunder and purposely came out to check, only to find it was you snoring in the tent!"

Qin Ming opened his mouth but said nothing, feeling extremely wronged. Was he supposed to tell them it was a mountain pig snoring?

"Yes, young man, you really outdid yourself, I also thought it was winter thunder exploding in the middle of the night!" an old man chimed in.

Wu Zheng, sporting dark circles under his eyes, looked dejected. He had originally wanted to stay close to an acquaintance for support, who knew Young Brother Qin's "aura" was so strong when he slept!

"Don't waste time, boil some hot water, eat some dry rations, and we'll hit the road immediately," Xu Sheng urged.

After resuming their journey for barely an hour, everyone's expressions changed as they saw a figure rapidly approaching them through the night fog.

"It's alright, it's a human," Wu Zheng whispered.

The others remained silent. Encountering a human outside was much like encountering a monster, and their own group even had aberrant beings.

Soon, Xu Sheng's expression changed. He had recognized the person: it was the expert who had battled the old elephant yesterday, with arms reaching past his knees, chiseled features, and eyes like lightning. Qin Ming knew the long-armed man must be here for him, so he stepped forward voluntarily.

"You all should go," Cui Hong waved at the merchant group.

Xu Sheng hesitated slightly but finally sighed. Regardless of whether the other party had ill intentions, he couldn't interfere. The power gap between them was too vast, and he had to be responsible for the larger group.

"Young man, take care!" Xu Sheng led his group away.

Wu Zheng also looked back repeatedly before turning to follow the convoy.

"Young Master!" Cui Hong bowed respectfully.

Qin Ming dodged. "I can't bear such a salute. Two years ago, you saved me; I should be the one saluting you."

"That was my duty," Cui Hong said.

The wilderness was dark and silent.

Qin Ming's emotions surged. He had many questions, but having caught the complex expression on Cui Hong's face yesterday, he realized this reunion might be entirely different from his earlier conjectures.

"Young Master, have you been reborn?" Cui Hong asked, his gaze incredibly sharp now.

Qin Ming said, "Please call me by my name. 'Young Master' makes me uncomfortable."

"Then... alright, Chonghe, have you been reborn?"

Qin Ming wanted very much to correct the name, but after thinking about it, since everyone he knew called him Cui Chonghe, he would temporarily accept this identity.

"Yes!" Qin Ming felt that no matter what he said, the other party would be able to discern its truthfulness. Since someone from the Cui family had come, they would surely investigate thoroughly in Silver Vine Town and Twin Trees Village.

"Alas!" Cui Hong sighed upon hearing his affirmative answer, somewhat conflicted, somewhat troubled, and also feeling a trace of pity, his expression once again becoming extremely complex.

"Is something wrong?" Qin Ming grew wary.

"Young Master, erm, Chonghe, you want to leave this remote region and go to a distant city, don't you?" Cui Hong asked.

Qin Ming remained silent. He was already on the road; did he still need to answer?

"Chonghe, I'm sorry, I cannot disobey orders. You cannot leave this area. You need to live as an ordinary person, prosperous and safe. Someone will arrange everything for you," Cui Hong said with deep apology.

"What do you mean? You want to cripple me?" Qin Ming retreated into the wilderness. Sure enough, some of his bad premonitions had come true. The long-armed man's appearance brought no joy of reunion but rather a surging tide that crashed into his fragmented memories. Qin Ming staggered, feeling a violent headache.

He asked loudly, "Who told you to do this?!"

Cui Hong hesitated for a moment, then finally revealed, "Your father."

"And my mother?!" Qin Ming demanded, backing away further.

"Before coming here, your mother also gave such instructions," Cui Hong said.

Qin Ming felt his head was about to explode, his body swaying violently in the wilderness. No wonder he felt his life was pieced together, somewhat false; some of his beliefs had once collapsed. How could parents be like this?

He had once been in rags, covered in blood and frostbite, struggling to survive in the freezing snow. After being brought to Twin Trees Village, he had personally seen Lu Ze and his wife, who, for the sake of Wen Rui and Wen Hui, would rather suffer cold and hunger themselves than let their two children endure hardship. He believed all parents should be like this, for with his own character and disposition, he would do the same.

"Why?!" Qin Ming endured the severe headache, trying to remember what had happened in the past.
