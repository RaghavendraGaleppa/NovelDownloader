# Chapter 14: The Greed of Robber Cultivators  

A dark cloud descended from the sky, and in the next moment, a massive palm formed from the condensed spiritual energy of heaven and earth slammed fiercely toward the auction hall.  

A simple second-tier lower-grade defensive array flickered to life, activating just in time—but it only held for three breaths before the sound of shattering echoed through the air.  

A second-tier lower-grade array could only withstand attacks from an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Yet the one attacking now was unmistakably a "True Person"!  

By the unspoken rules of the cultivation world, only Core Formation cultivators could be addressed as "True Person."  

The one launching this attack was none other than a Core Formation expert from the demonic faction, **Soul-Shattering Mountain**.  

Moreover, this array was a simplified version, its defensive capabilities even weaker. Under the assault of **True Person Wuchang**, it was doomed to fail.  

Realizing this, countless thoughts surged in Wei Qian’s chest, but only two words escaped his lips: **"Run, now!"**  

His shout snapped the stunned members of the Li family out of their daze.  

In the next instant, Li Wanhai regained his senses, his expression darkening as he spat out with difficulty, **"Forget packing! Run for your lives first!"**  

With that, he grabbed Li Caiwei with his left hand and Li Guchen with his right, charging out of the hall.  

A few sturdy **Zhuangman Horses** stood nearby. Li Wanhai leaped onto one, then flung Li Caiwei and Li Guchen onto two others.  

**"Go, go!"** he roared urgently.  

While Li Wanhai moved swiftly, Wei Qian was no slower.  

Without hesitation, he pulled out a first-tier lower-grade **Swiftwind Talisman** from his storage pouch and slapped it onto himself.  

A moment later, a green glow spread from the talisman, enveloping his entire body. Instantly, Wei Qian felt as if his body had lightened by thirty percent.  

Then, he sprinted toward the herd of Zhuangman Horses on foot.  

**"There are two horses left, but Li Wanhai won’t just let an outsider like me take one,"** Wei Qian thought rapidly, his mind racing.  

**"Damn it, why would a demonic Core Formation cultivator show up here? The Millennium Pact hasn’t even expired yet—are they trying to start a war?"**  

With each step, the Swiftwind Talisman propelled him forward, covering three paces in one stride. He reached the horses in no time, spotting the one he had ridden earlier. With a leap, he landed on its back.  

Wei Qian didn’t hesitate—he pulled out another Swiftwind Talisman and slapped it onto the horse beneath him.  

Then, without delay, he urged the horse into a full gallop, desperate to escape the chaos.  

Not far away, the auction hall’s array had been completely shattered, and half the stone structure had collapsed under the attack.  

In that single strike, who knew how many unfortunate souls had perished?  

Several streaks of light shot out from the ruins, accompanied by an urgent male voice: **"True Person Wuchang! This is the territory of the Zhao Kingdom’s cultivation world! By ambushing our Flowing Cloud Sect, are you trying to provoke a war between righteous and demonic factions?"**  

**"Hah, I wouldn’t dare wear such a grand accusation,"** True Person Wuchang sneered, his voice echoing across the land without restraint. **"My beloved disciple died here. I’m merely here to demand answers!"**  

The next moment, another massive palm of spiritual energy descended.  

The battles between such powerful figures could unleash devastating storms with even the slightest ripple effect.  

At this moment, Wei Qian wished his horse could transform into some divine steed, capable of multiplying its speed eight or even tenfold.  

But the troubles didn’t end there.  

Many cultivators, seeing him mounted, immediately grew malicious. Attacks rained down as they sought to kill him and seize his horse.  

Wei Qian reacted decisively—he pulled out two talismans.  

Two fireballs, each the size of a human head, exploded toward the attackers.  

Then, he drew two more talismans, gripping them tightly but not activating them yet.  

Some cultivators hesitated upon seeing this, deeming him too troublesome to mess with. But a few remained confident, continuing their assault.  

**"Wind Blade—go!"**  

Wei Qian locked onto the nearest black-robed cultivator, launching a fireball at him.  

The man dispelled the fireball with a spell, but in the next instant, a wind blade followed, slicing toward him.  

Caught off guard, he barely dodged—but not fast enough. The wind blade cut deep into his shoulder, exposing bone.  

Wei Qian, meanwhile, had already pulled out two more talismans.  

At this point, even the most confident attackers wavered.  

In such chaos, an injury made one an easy target for opportunistic predators.  

The black-robed cultivator with the wounded shoulder quickly found himself under attack from others.  

The arrival of a Core Formation True Person had thrown everything into disarray—but it also provided the perfect cover for looting and murder.  

In this turmoil, tracking down the real culprits afterward would be nearly impossible.  

To survive, one either needed overwhelming strength—or allies.  

**"Guchen, over here!"** Wei Qian spotted Li Guchen riding alone and immediately called out to him.  

The two quickly regrouped.  

**"Where’s Wanhai?"** Wei Qian asked first.  

**"A robber cultivator tried to attack the young mistress earlier. Uncle Wanhai engaged him,"** Li Guchen replied. **"My horse ran too fast, so I got separated."**  

**"Should we go back for them?"**  

Wei Qian shook his head firmly. **"Uncle Wanhai is highly skilled and trained in body-refining techniques. He can handle that robber cultivator."**  

**"If we go back now, we’ll only be a burden."**  

After a brief hesitation, Li Guchen nodded. Before leaving, his father, Li Wanqing, had repeatedly instructed him to follow Wei Qian’s lead in uncertain situations.  

**"Right now, we head straight back to Mist Ridge Mountain. What happened here must be reported to your family’s ancestor immediately."**  

Blackwater Pond was only sixteen hundred miles from Mist Ridge Mountain—a trivial distance for a Golden Core True Person.  

With the two sticking together, many would-be attackers hesitated, suppressing their greed.  

But some, defying expectations, saw them as prime targets.  

**"Big brother, that Qi Refinement third-layer kid was throwing out talismans like paper money—he’s definitely loaded. Probably some young master from a minor clan,"** a dark-faced burly man said eagerly.  

Wei Qian’s earlier decisiveness and his ability to summon Li Guchen had created a misleading impression.  

The man referred to as "big brother" licked his lips, his eyes gleaming with greed. **"Mhm. They don’t have any elders with them. We’re at Qi Refinement fifth and sixth layers..."**  

**"This is a deal worth taking."**  

**"Follow them. I’ll handle the fifth-layer kid. You take out the third-layer one fast."**  

With that, the two changed direction, tailing Wei Qian and Li Guchen from a distance.
