# Chapter 628: Such a Weak God

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered.

*Is it this weak?*

And here he had been cautious and careful, secretly mobilizing his Divine Thunder power to deliver a devastating blow.

This attack was no longer a pure shockwave and spiritual oppression; it carried the embryonic power of this world's divine rules. However, in Xu Yunfan's view, this embryonic divine rule was inferior even to a Foundation Establishment cultivator who had just condensed their Dao Foundation.

It was completely similar to a bestowal from the Heavenly Dao.

However, Xu Yunfan had been waiting for this very moment.

Almost the instant the sound-blade cage formed, the secret technique in his heart was activated.

**Dongming Erosion Heavenly Talisman.**

The Heavenly Talisman is a secret art for tracing causality. Although the various realms manifest different forms of energy, the underlying logic of their formation is mostly相通 (connected). This is the so-called principle that the Great Dao returns to the same source.

This causal secret art traces its origins and洞察 (inspects) its essence.

The core of this secret art lies in "inspecting the true nether, eroding all heavenly connections."

Under the operation of the secret art, Xu Yunfan's vision no longer saw the world as a pile of matter, but as an extension born along the lines of causality.

Light, dust, flying stone fragments, the sound-blades flashing with lethal寒光 (cold light), including the statue of the god itself—all of existence was instantly pulled long, rapidly transitioning from concrete to an abstract representation.

Countless fine, almost transparent lines emerged.

These lines represented the connections between things, the flow of energy, the trajectories of existence, and the direction of causality...

They were the underlying logic constituting the existence of things, the projection of "Law" and "Principle" in the world of appearances.

Looking at the causal lines before him, which were even more chaotic than several hundred tangled balls of yarn, Xu Yunfan's brow actually relaxed.

*Fortunately, the Dongming Erosion Heavenly Talisman counts as one of the top causal secret arts of the Primordial Origin Sect, and with the Attribute Panel as an auxiliary, it has long been cultivated to perfection.*

Causal secret arts are inherently extremely difficult to cultivate. To reach perfection, even within the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm, there are few Foundation Establishment cultivators below the Golden Core True Lord level.

And amidst the causal lines, a particularly thick and solid main脉 (vein), shining with a bright silver color, entered his sight.

It was like a massive tree trunk, deeply rooted in the void, yet faintly connected to the ground veins of this church. At the same time, it extended upwards, as if piercing through the barrier of some dimension, probing toward a strange, unknown space.

Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense inspected it clearly: Dylis's divine power originated from here.

According to the legends of this world, divine power originates from a god lighting their divine flame, and their divine power resides in their divine realm. That should be Dylis's divine realm, or rather, the source of power for her mortal projection.

This main vein was the anchor point of Dylis's divine power in this material plane, the "causal line" of her existence here.

Then everything became simple and clear.

Besides this thick main vein, there were three slightly thinner but similarly divine-silver light bands wrapped around it like companion vines, emanating a unique rhythm.

The first light band pulsed with a melodious and graceful sense of rhythm, representing **Song and Praise**.

This was the outlet through which Dylis created and expressed her divine power.

The second light band appeared deep and reserved, like an invisible receiver, gathering and converging a certain faint will that permeated the church and the entire town.

This was **Listening**, the entrance through which she collected faith and perceived the needs of her believers.

But in Xu Yunfan's view, the greatest ability of the other party's divine authority was this Listening.

As the saying goes, "The law is not passed through six ears."

If used well, this authority could monitor the three realms. The mythical "Diting" (all-hearing) is extremely extraordinary.

Unfortunately, Dylis had developed it into something incredibly useless, turning it into nothing more than a convenient way to listen to the hearts of her believers.

"Found it."

Xu Yunfan's eyes lifted slightly.

His spiritual sense, like lightning, instantly locked onto the most essential yet core existence among the three companion light bands.

The grey authority light band representing the **Divine Name**.

Just as the sound-blade cage contracted to its limit, on the verge of grinding him to pieces—

Xu Yunfan moved!

He simply raised his right hand, index and middle fingers together, and gently pointed forward.

His fingertips did not touch any physical object, merely pointing into the slightly turbid air before him, distorted by space.

At his fingertip, no dazzling light erupted, nor did violent energy surge.

Only a speck of darkness, darker than the deepest night, condensed, its center seeming to吸 (suck) in all light.

An extreme, condensed "Inspection of the Void" and "Erosion of Destruction."

The Dongming Erosion Heavenly Talisman is not an offensive or defensive technique; it specializes in blinding, disturbing, and eroding the lines of deduction, confusing perception, and twisting causal connections.

Naturally, it could deduce the other party's hiding place through their connection.

"Break."

A low murmur.

That speck of dark light flashed gently and disappeared without a sound.

"Ah!"

The statue let out a heart-wrenching shriek.

"Crack!"

That illusory grey authority light band, connecting to the underlying rules of the world, snapped in response.

The moonlight divine radiance burning around the statue like white-hot flame, as if doused with a bucket of ice water, dropped in brightness by more than half.

The majestic, descending sacred will instantly became chaotic and scattered, collapsing by more than half.

The impact was more directly reflected in the rotating,绞杀 (strangling) sound-blade cage.

The divine power supply that formed its foundation was like having its artery pinched off; losing its core status support, the form of the sound-blades instantly became disordered.

The originally solid and lethal blade light rapidly became faint and blurry.

The lethal绞杀力场 (strangling force field) was like a popped bubble, its high-speed rotation grinding to an abrupt halt.

The death cage capable of绞杀 (strangling) a Legendary-level Transcendent completely disintegrated and vanished less than half a foot from Xu Yunfan's body.

The dimming statue trembled violently, as if some internal structure was collapsing.

The warm, jade-like texture on the surface of the stone statue rapidly faded, revealing the rough essence of stone. Cracks spread like spiderwebs over its body, climbing from the ankles up to the skirt hem, reaching the arms and neck, and finally even spreading to the face that was originally a marvel of craftsmanship, breathtakingly beautiful.

The pair of crystal eyes that once brimmed with spirit, pride, and a divine glow now had their luster completely gone, becoming like two dim, lifeless glass beads.

Xu Yunfan slowly lowered his hand, the darkness at his fingertip already long gone.

He took a step forward, a step that landed precisely in the center of the energy vortex where the sound-blade cage had been formed, his footing light and silent.

He raised his head, his gaze calmly passing through the turbid light mist caused by the dissipation of divine power, looking at the stone sculpture face covered in cracks, its luster gone, its expression frozen in pain and shock.

Moonlight streamed down from the stained-glass skylight at the top of the church.经过 (Passing through) the turbulence of the divine light and the distortion of residual energy, colorful spots of light flickered不定 (uncertainly) onto the ground and his body, adding an even more诡异 (eerie) atmosphere.

Dust was still slowly settling.

The interior of the church was in a state of devastation.

Shards of broken murals were scattered all over the floor like withered leaves.

A thick layer of powder from the exploded statue covered the ground.
