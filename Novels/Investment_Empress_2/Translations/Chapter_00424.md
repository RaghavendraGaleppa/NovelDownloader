# Chapter 424: Qin Yuzhi's Wonderful Journey, The Beam Is Askew and the Rafters Are Crooked

“Xiao Bing’er’s dream is truly out of the ordinary.”

“An ordinary Dream Weaver恐怕恐怕还进不去呢...”

Qin Yuzhi’s figure quickly blurred and shrank, silently establishing a connection with the dream bubble from Ying Bing.

Based on her past experience, the vast majority of people are in a relatively relaxed state while sleeping, so their dream bubbles are also relatively soft.

Ying Bing’s was different.

Her bubble seemed to be encased in ancient, unmelting ice, but this was no obstacle for the experienced Sect Master Qin.

She would change her approach from breaking in to blending in, turning herself into a part of the dream...

*Hum—*

A soft sound echoed as Qin Yuzhi was accepted into the dream bubble. The watery dream barrier before her vanished like ripples, and everything became clear.

“Where is this?”

Frost flew across the sky, blocking out the light.

Qin Yuzhi saw nothing but mist-shrouded, pure white mountain ranges stretching endlessly. Even the vegetation was translucent, like jade.

It seemed she had just walked out of a cold, pavilion-like structure amidst the snow and wind.

“Even the winter in Beifeng isn’t this cold...”

Qin Yuzhi shivered, feeling a chill that didn’t just come from her body.

“Our Guigong is like this all year round, there is no winter.”

A female disciple in a white dress looked at Qin Yuzhi strangely.

“Guigong?”

Qin Yuzhi had never heard of this sect. Was it established after she fell asleep?

But Xiao Bing’er is a disciple of the Qingyuan Sect, how could she dream of this so-called Guigong...

“Do you know Ying Bing?”

“Shimei, did you have a mishap while practicing?”

The female disciple’s expression changed immediately, and she quickly covered Qin Yuzhi’s mouth.

“How can you casually call the Palace Master’s name!”

“Palace Master?”

Qin Yuzhi was stunned.

“Of course. Our Palace Master is the Empress of the Phoenix, she wields the Great Dao of the Moon and the Divine Phoenix, and stands at the very top of the Nine Heavens. You aren’t a spy sent by an enemy sect, are you, to not even know this?”

“?????”

Qin Yuzhi’s round eyes widened even more, and she was completely dumbfounded.

How could Xiao Bing’er have such a dream?

Well, with her talent, this doesn’t seem like a pipe dream.

But...

“Hmm, you probably aren’t a spy. A spy wouldn’t be ignorant of this.”

The female disciple looked her up and down and asked, “Are you a new disciple who just joined the palace?”

Qin Yuzhi hurriedly nodded. “Yes, yes, Shijie, could you tell me what kind of person our Palace Master is?”

“The Palace Master... she is ranked first among the Hundred Flowers’ beauties, she is very good-looking.”

The disciple said seriously.

“There’s no need to mention such common knowledge...”

The other person looked around and lowered her voice. “How should I put it? Her temperament is very cold. Not only did she sever her own Seven Emotions and Six Desires, but she also requires us Guigong disciples to be free of worldly attachments. You must be careful, matters of romance...”

“Are absolutely forbidden?” Qin Yuzhi frowned.

“It’s absolutely forbidden to be discovered by the Palace Master.”

“......”

Qin Yuzhi roughly understood.

Seven Emotions and Six Desires are human nature; who could truly sever their feelings?

So inside Guigong, there are actually many disciples secretly having relationships... commonly known as having an affair.

Fortunately, the Palace Master keeps the cold moon as her companion all year round, ignores worldly affairs, and devotes herself to pursuing the ultimate peak of the Great Dao.

In summary.

Peerless in strength, and devoid of emotion.

“Has the influence of the Primordial Phoenix Ancestor already... run this deep?”

Qin Yuzhi muttered to herself.

Legend has it that the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix, after returning from the Heavenly Court, in order to handle the affairs of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands with absolute impartiality and without bias, modeled herself after the Heavenly Dao and created a method of the Supreme Being’s Forgetfulness of Emotion.

If the future Xiao Bing’er truly becomes like this...

The moment she ascends to immortality might be the day that being returns!

To be having such dreams now, the influence is already quite significant...

---

At this time, the female disciple spoke again.

“Shimei, since I’ve told you so much, you can help me with a small favor, right?”

“What favor?” Qin Yuzhi asked.

“Little Shidi accidentally entered the Palace Master’s bedchamber and was discovered by an Elder. He was punished to meditate at the Shuling Cliff. It’s too cold there, could you help me deliver a meal to him?”

“Who is this Little Shidi...”

Qin Yuzhi took the food box and askedquired confused.

“Li Mo, he’s the only male disciple in our Guigong. And he’s as gentle as jade and generous with his help. Many female disciples in the sect want to have an affair with him, but unfortunately, I don’t like men.”

“Huh???”

Qin Yuzhi’s brain stalled for the third time.

Xiao Bing’er is the Palace Master Empress.

That brat is the Little Shidi?

Doesn’t that make them master and disciple?

What kind of absurd development is this!

Unfortunately, she hadn’t read *The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me*; if she had read even a little, she wouldn’t be so completely lost now...

Carrying the food box, Qin Yuzhi hurriedly rushed towards the Shuling Cliff, but before she got close, she sensed something was off.

It seemed someone had arrived before her.

She quickly blurred her presence within the dream, observing secretly.

Through the jade-colored branches, she saw two figures standing before the cliff face.

“You came...”

The young Li Mo in the dream still looked like a teenager, seemingly no different from the outside world.

“You knew I would come?”

Xiao Bing’er... no, she should be called Big Ice Block now.

Ying Bing had fully blossomed. Her figure was breathtaking, her long legs giving Qin Yuzhi the illusion that they reached her waist...

But the cold, god-like aura hadn’t changed. Only, the coldness and allure were mixed in her eyes, the contrast was deadly.

Why was she here? Wasn’t she the Palace Master of Guigong now...

The Big Ice Block furrowed her delicate brows, seemingly admonishing him:

“I told you not to sneak into my chambers. Now that an Elder has caught you, if I don’t punish you, how can I explain it to the others?”

Qin Yuzhi seemed to understand.

Oh, she values this disciple, so she came to reprimand and educate him?

Although it’s a bit strange, it seems acceptable.

But Li Mo’s next sentence petrified her on the spot.

Li Mo: “But Sister, I miss you so much.”

“?”

Sect Master Qin leaned back slightly. What was he saying?

How could he speak to the Empress of the Phoenix like that?

If Ying Bing, influenced by the Way of Heartlessness, heard this, wouldn’t it be seeking death?

However...

The Big Ice Block lowered her eyes, her frosty jade-like face seeming to flush slightly:

“I miss you too...”

“???”

Qin Yuzhi’s scalp went numb. What was she saying?

How could the Empress of the Phoenix speak to a disciple like that?

You call this being influenced by the Way of Heartlessness?

“Your hair is loose, let me tie it up for you.”

“Mm...”

And so, the Empress of the Phoenix and her little disciple, the Big Ice Block sister, sat down on her little brother’s lap in broad daylight.

“Is it done?”

“You... don’t move around, I’m afraid that soon, the hardest thing won’t be my mouth anymore...”

“??????”

Qin Yuzhi felt as if struck by lightning. What are you two talking about?!

Is this dialogue something that would happen between an Empress and her disciple?!

You said you severed your feelings of love and forbade your disciples from romance?

No wonder the disciples are having affairs in secret. It turns out this corrupt wind started right from the root!
