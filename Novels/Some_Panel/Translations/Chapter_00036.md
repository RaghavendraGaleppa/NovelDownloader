**Chapter Thirty-Six: Great Divine Ability, Human Weapon**

"Let's go, down we go!"

The young man said, glancing sideways, and the middle-aged cultivator flew down with him, landing on the stone pillar.

From a distance, Yang Ji had already seen the information display indicating two people approaching. He merely frowned and observed. Now, seeing the two descend directly, he pushed open the stone door, stepped lightly in the air a few times, and flew onto the stone pillar.

"Fellow Daoist, is there something you need?" Yang Ji saw that the young man before him had an arrogant expression and an extraordinary demeanor, while the middle-aged man beside him also possessed a powerful aura. For a moment, he asked calmly.

"I heard you're very skilled in alchemy?" The young man asked, hands clasped behind his back, looking down from a superior position. His gaze was deep, and above his head appeared: [This kid is actually younger than me?] [Annoying.]

Yang Ji's eyebrows subtly twitched, his expression remaining normal. "I know a thing or two, but I wouldn't call myself skilled."

"Oh? Know a thing or two, I also know a thing or two. All my life, I've loved exchanging knowledge on the Dao of Alchemy with others. How about we have a competition and see how good you really are?" The young man said with an arrogant smile.

"See how good I really are?" Such a direct provocation made a cold smile rise in Yang Ji's heart.

Truly an egg trying to crack a stone, not knowing how dangerous it was.

If his strength weren't so low, he would surely refine pills with one hand today and smash them onto this guy's face, showing him what he was made of.

But for now, he dared not be so brazen.

"I have a beast flame. I'd like to see your flame too!" The young man spread his palm, and a bright yellow flame immediately emerged from its center.

Yang Ji swept his gaze over it and was instantly startled: [Sunflame Beast Flame.]

It's actually the Sunflame Beast Flame?

Seeing Yang Ji's surprised expression, the young man's face couldn't help but show a hint of pride. As an alchemist, possessing a good flame indeed gave him something to flaunt. He then spoke,

"This flame was taken from a Level Ten Sunflame Beast, and it's not much worse than the Qilin Divine Flame."

Level Ten Sunflame Beast, what a coincidence? Yang Ji wondered.

Just then, a figure flew from the horizon; it was Golden Abacus. His voice came from afar: "Senior Brother Chang, what brings you here?"

"Golden Abacus, you're back? I came to spar with your friend here on alchemy." The young man glanced sideways, peering at the sky.

"Spar on alchemy?" Golden Abacus's eyes flashed. He flew down onto the stone pillar and quickly said with a smile,

"My friend's alchemy skills are just average, how can he compare to Senior Brother Chang? To be an Alchemy Master at such a young age, throughout the entire Thousand Islands Sea Region, only the Grand Alchemy Masters of the Three Great Sects and Senior Brother Chang have achieved such accomplishments at this age."

"My friend is far inferior to Senior Brother, there's no need to compare at all. His alchemy skills are crude and displaying them would only tarnish the sacred Dao of Alchemy and dirty Senior Brother's eyes."

Golden Abacus chuckled, intentionally or unintentionally blocking half of Yang Ji's body.

Hearing Golden Abacus's words, Yang Ji fell into deep thought. Senior Brother Chang? Surname Chang? And a Canglan Sect disciple?

He immediately looked up at the young man, cupped his hands and respectfully said, "I never imagined Fellow Daoist to be an Alchemy Master at such a young age, truly admirable. I am ashamed of my inferiority. May I inquire your esteemed name? Please tell me, so I may bask in your glory."

Hearing Yang Ji's words, the young man smiled arrogantly, "Chang Yuan!"

Chang Yuan!

It really is Chang Yuan!

No wonder it was such a coincidence, having a Sunflame Beast Flame and the surname Chang. As expected, he's the nephew of that so-called "Chang Lin."

That old fellow Chang Lin stole my opportunity, and now his nephew is here to pick a fight with me.

Is this family destined to clash with me?

I just want to cultivate peacefully, but they won't let me live in peace?

Yang Ji also felt a bit of suppressed anger.

"Fellow Daoist, please reveal your flame," Chang Yuan said plainly, looking directly at him.

"Alright, I'll play along with you and see how good you really are." Yang Ji chuckled coldly in his heart, and with a spread of his hand, he revealed his Earth Spirit Flame.

However, at this moment, he had restrained eighty percent of its spiritual energy, making it look like an ordinary Earth Fire, so no one could discern its true nature.

"I only have an Earth Fire, it's far inferior to Fellow Daoist's Sunflame Beast Flame," Yang Ji said with undisguised envy, glancing at Chang Yuan's flame.

"Since yours is just an Earth Fire, I won't bully you. I'll provide the spirit herbs. You need to successfully refine eight pills of superior quality, while you only need to refine four pills of medium quality to win against me." Chang Yuan said arrogantly, then tapped his storage bag and took out two sets of ingredients for refining Spirit Essence Pills.

No wonder he's so confident? So it's for refining Spirit Essence Pills. He must have figured my Earth Fire can only melt a portion of the medicinal properties.

Yang Ji raised an eyebrow, accepted the herbs, and without hesitation, took out his pill furnace from his storage bag.

Seeing Yang Ji make the first move, Chang Yuan smiled faintly, unhurriedly took out his own pill furnace, and vigorously activated his beast flame to preheat it.

During the alchemy process, both observed each other's techniques in secret.

Seeing Yang Ji's serious, nervous demeanor, occasionally making small mistakes in the details.

Chang Yuan's mood, for some reason, became pleasant. His gaze towards Yang Ji also softened, changing from [provocation] to [contempt].

"This alchemy technique isn't so great after all. However, the Monster Luring Pills he refined were of excellent quality. I still need to see how he refined them," Chang Yuan mused inwardly.

He held a morbid pride in the Dao of Alchemy, believing himself to be the number one genius, yet he was extremely unconfident deep down, constantly wanting to prove himself to be the best. Therefore, whenever he encountered an alchemist, he would challenge them to a spar.

When he saw others were not as good as him, he would let out a long, satisfied sigh of relief.

With a strange confidence, he would assure himself that indeed, in the path of alchemy, he was the strongest.

Yang Ji naturally saw through his petty thoughts. At this moment, he was also putting on an act to cater to Chang Yuan's twisted psychology, letting him get lost in his own world, so that he could deliver a heavy blow later.

Every step of Yang Ji's alchemy process was performed with extreme care and caution, and occasionally he made mistakes due to nervousness.

Chang Yuan watched, feeling increasingly pleased.

His operations were much more skilled than the alchemy technique Yang Ji displayed. Every step was methodical, and although it couldn't be called a master's demeanor, it indeed touched upon the threshold of a master.

Melting, blending, separating pills, turning pills, nurturing — after a series of operations, fine beads of sweat appeared on his forehead, and he finally managed to refine eight pills.

As for Yang Ji, he was drenched in sweat. The blending step alone took him nearly half a day. It was almost dusk when he finally managed to control the formation of four pills.

A true alchemy master can control pill formation at will, while a fake alchemy master still struggles to achieve eight pills.

Now, Yang Ji had formed four pills of medium quality. He let out a feigned sigh of relief, a hint of a smile appearing on his face.

This time, he had won.

Chang Yuan, seeing him form four pills, was not angry. Instead, a sense of triumph arose in his heart: "Although this person has the standard of a peak alchemist, he's far worse than I was back then. It took him half a day to blend the medicinal liquid, which is enough time for me to refine eight batches. I suppose his Monster Luring Pills also took a massive amount of time to slowly grind out, not worth mentioning."

"Senior Brother Chang, it seems my friend won?" Golden Abacus glanced at the two pill furnaces and smiled slightly.

"Yes, your friend won. A win deserves a reward. Choose one of these three items." Chang Yuan smiled faintly, tapped his storage bag, and presented three items before Yang Ji.

A reward?

His posture was quite high.

However, Yang Ji still looked over. The three items were a top-grade pill furnace, a high-grade magical artifact, and a rotten piece of wood the size of a middle finger.

"Brother Dao, just take his top-grade pill furnace. Don't let a freebie go to waste," Golden Abacus transmitted, his eyes lighting up.

But Yang Ji, as if he hadn't heard, stepped forward and directly took the rotten piece of wood.

"This kid is quite sensible, knows to choose the worst one," Chang Yuan thought to himself.

"Sensible my ass, Fellow Daoist! What you brought out is actually a Great Divine Ability!" Yang Ji's body was trembling slightly at this moment, because the rotten piece of wood displayed: [First Scroll of a Great Divine Ability, Human Weapon!]

He accepted the rotten wood and immediately asked with a smile, "This rotten wood looks like a treasure to me. Does Fellow Daoist have any more?"

"Since it's a treasure, of course there aren't many. I don't have any left either," Chang Yuan said with a feigned smile, then subtly turned to the middle-aged man and transmitted, "By the way, where did you get this rotten piece of wood? I forgot to ask you back then."

"This rotten piece of wood? That rogue cultivator earlier said it washed out from the sea. He said when he found it, it was glowing brilliantly, so it must be a treasure that emerged from an immortal's cave dwelling hidden deep in the sea. I saw it was a bit special, so I bought it for one Demonic Essence Pill. I also studied it, but it showed no supernatural properties, just like a hard piece of wood. That rogue cultivator must have exaggerated," the middle-aged cultivator said.

"A rogue cultivator, indeed, that must be the case," Chang Yuan replied with a smile, unconcerned.

He then glanced at Yang Ji, before ascending into the sky with a triumphant smile, leaving the stone pillar with the middle-aged cultivator.
