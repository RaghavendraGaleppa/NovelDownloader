# Chapter 591: Are You Serious, Jian?

Xu Yunfan didn't take it to heart. He hadn't exerted much effort, not even circulating the magical power within his body.

The brief exchange moments ago had allowed him to clearly perceive the characteristics of the Heavenly Realm's cultivation system.

Those who emphasized magical arts and divine abilities, like the captured Star Official and Snow Soul Fairy, possessed pure and vast magical power, with a wide variety of methods.

Those who focused on fundamental cultivation methods, like the Heavenly Emperor and Empress, had profound cultivation and a long, steady aura, capable of contending with the Heavenly Beings and the Heavenly Dao itself.

And those like Yang Jian, who specialized in martial arts, had dragon-like vital energy and battle skills that approached the divine. Every strike carried his own will and magical power, and his physical body was tempered to perfection.

In the context of this realm's destruction, neither of the three was superior or inferior; it all depended on the depth of one's personal cultivation.

The Second Lord True Lord Yang Jian before him had clearly pushed the path of physical body and martial arts to a certain extreme.

It was no wonder he could unleash such terrifying combat power at the mid Foundation Establishment realm.

However, it was still a bit lacking. At the very least, the rank of this Heavenly Realm could not compare to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

The derived laws were also of a slightly lower level.

In common parlance, he was from a backwater place.

Xu Yunfan stopped dodging.

Facing the thousands of刀光 (blade lights) Yang Jian劈来 (劈来 -劈来 is a typo, should be 劈来, meaning劈来) again, the紫金色 (purple-gold) lightning radiance around his body erupted with a轰然 (rumbling) boom.

The Divine Celestial Nine Courts Purple Dome Indestructible Scripture no longer stagnated, operating at full power. The nascent洞天 (cave-heaven) in his Sea of Consciousness嗡鸣 (hummed) and震颤 (trembled), granting him a majestic and vast magical power support like an inner universe.

There were no flashy spells, only the most primitive eruption of power. The Battle Formula and the North Pole Purple We镇煞 True Qi, these two innate divine abilities, suddenly activated, multiplying his strength several times over.

The divine ability born at the late Foundation Establishment realm had not yet been fully nurtured. It would naturally flow into his heart once the nascent cave-heaven reached a certain stage.

But Xu Yunfan was almost certain it would be related to Divine Celestial Thunder.

Xu Yunfan虚握 (vacuously gripped) with his right hand, as if holding an invisible bolt of lightning.

His entire right arm was instantly covered in a layer of purple-gold, crystal-like鳞甲 (scale armor) flowing with thunderous talismans!

Divine Celestial Thunder Armor.

He took a step forward, causing the earth to shake and the mountains to sway.

He threw a punch toward the silver sea of blades that was tearing through the void.

"Break!"

Wherever the fist锋 (edge) passed, space was brutally compressed and trembled, letting out a groan as if it could no longer bear the strain.

The pure, overwhelmingly domineering thunderous force,蕴含 (containing) the true meaning of annihilation, forcibly tore apart the layers of blade lights before him.

*Boom!*

*Crack!*

The purple-gold lightning fist and the blade edge of the Three-Tipped Double-Edged Blade collided head-on.

A terrifying sound, far surpassing the clash of metal, like a giant god beating a heavenly drum,震彻 (shook) the entire universe.

A violent shockwave exploded outwards in a ring, completely平夷 (flattening) all the残垣断壁 (ruined walls and broken pillars) within a radius of several hundred丈 (zhang - a unit of length).

Dust, mixed with fine乱流 (chaotic flows) of energy, shot into the sky in a五光十色 (multicolored) display.

Yang Jian's whole body剧烈震颤 (violently trembled). He felt an unimaginable, immense force mixed with rampant thunder, like a ten-thousand-foot-tall怒涛 (furious wave), crashing into his body along the blade.

The divine body he was so proud of, tempered a thousand times over, had its vital energy and blood instantly翻腾 (churning), its bones哀鸣 (moaning). The Three-Tipped Double-Edged Blade in his hand almost flew from his grasp.

He let out a闷哼 (muffled groan), a trace of淡金色 (pale golden) blood overflowing from the corner of his mouth, his eyes filled with难以置信 (incredulous) horror.

The opponent's pure strength was far superior to his own.

It even contained a destructive power from a higher level, one that could shake the very laws of reality.

Xu Yunfan also felt a strong反震 (recoil) from his fist, but his body only swayed slightly. The purple-gold lightning armor covering his arm glowed with patterns, easily dispersing the recoil force.

The immense magical power, supported by the nascent cave-heaven at the late Foundation Establishment realm, and the Divine Celestial Thunder Body refined to the extreme, were fully displayed at this moment.

"Peak mid Foundation Establishment, is this your limit? If that's all," Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with a cold light, "what a waste of such martial skill."

He stopped testing the waters, his left hand forming a seal within his sleeve.

*Hum!*

The周天星灵幡 (Celestial Star Spirit Banner) appeared silently above Yang Jian's head, its dark banner surface instantly covering this freshly cleared area.

A restraining and absorbing force, ten times more powerful than what he used against the Zi Demon, descended with a rumble.

At the same time, countless Star Lord phantoms emerged from within the banner. Dots of starlight descended, interweaving into an invisible giant net that instantly suppressed the slightly sluggish flow of Yang Jian's magical power due to his injury.

"Suppress!"

Xu Yunfan stepped on the Dipper, formed a seal, and let out a low shout.

Yang Jian roared and struggled. His third eye shot out a golden-red pillar of light, trying to pierce the banner's veil. The Three-Tipped Double-Edged Blade unleashed its final sharpness to劈斩 (slash).

However, the Star Spirit Banner was an existence close to a spiritual treasure. When fully activated by Xu Yunfan's late Foundation Establishment cultivation, how could its power be抵挡 (resisted) by someone at the mid Foundation Establishment realm?

更何况 (What's more), Yang Jian had already suffered internal injuries.

The golden-red pillar of light was devoured by the surging river of stars' phantom within the banner. The silver blade aura劈在 (slashed against) the banner's surface, only激起 (stirring up) a few ripples before vanishing like a泥牛入海 (clay ox entering the sea).

The无形 (invisible) starlight giant net收紧 (tightened) more and more. Yang Jian felt as if he had fallen into a spider's web, his soul and physical body being forcibly suppressed and pulled by a cold and宏大 (grand) will.

"No!"

With endless unwillingness and悲愤 (grief and indignation), Yang Jian's figure twisted violently within the starlight, and was ultimately拉入 (pulled into) the deep and boundless space within the banner.

The幽光 (dim light) converged. The Star Spirit Banner turned into a流光 (flowing light) and fell back into Xu Yunfan's sleeve.

His divine sense sank into the banner.

Unlike the quick formatting of the Zi Demon, Yang Jian's star soul seemed much more tenacious. His remaining fighting will and individual memories appeared exceptionally stubborn, frantically struggling and resisting under the suppression of the myriad stars. The vertical eye mark on his forehead更是 (even more)熠熠生辉 (radiant), trying to resist the assimilation of the banner's power.

The Star Spirit Banner in Xu Yunfan's hand不断 (continuously) trembled with starlight,环绕 (circling) him like a millstone, slowly grinding away his will to resist.

"His strength is quite good, truly worthy of being a figure who once shook the Heavenly Realm. Refining him will indeed require a bit more effort," Xu Yunfan felt a hint of satisfaction. Yang Jian's potential was clearly far superior to the previous True Immortals. Once refined into a banner spirit, his strength would at least be that of a Star Lord General at the late Foundation Establishment realm.

Three days and three nights later, the Star Spirit Banner trembled slightly.

Xu Yunfan, who had been sitting cross-legged in mid-air, rose and took hold of the banner pole before him.

"It's done!"

Xu Yunfan looked at Yang Jian, who walked out from within the Star Spirit Banner.

The latter's face was somber as he bowed deeply to Xu Yunfan.

Having entered the Ten Thousand Soul Banner—no, the Star Spirit Banner—he naturally knew his life and death were no longer in his own hands. What's more, the other party had not erased his consciousness. Although it was partly for the banner's greater power, it also meant his consciousness was preserved.

"Venerable One, if it is convenient, could you perhaps travel three thousand li to the north, to the伏龙崖 (Subduing Dragon Cliff)? There is a Primordial Spirit there. You could take Nezha's残魂 (residual soul) and also bring it into this banner?"

There was such a good thing?

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, greatly surprised.

Yang Jian had been refined into a banner spirit, and his first thought was this?

Asking him to capture Nezha's residual soul?

Xu Yunfan was a bit惊讶 (astonished) and asked, "Are you serious?"

Yang Jian said, "There is no possibility of continuing here. If we can enter the banner, there might still be a path to survival."

After a brief thought, Xu Yunfan understood the reason, and his heart became clear.

The Heavenly Realm was on the verge of collapse, its end imminent. Whether it was Yang Jian or the possible residual soul of Nezha, if they continued to stay in this world of doom destined to be devoured by the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, their final outcome would either be being crushed by the aftermath of the True Lord's realm or perishing with the world itself. It was little different from the complete annihilation of body and soul.
