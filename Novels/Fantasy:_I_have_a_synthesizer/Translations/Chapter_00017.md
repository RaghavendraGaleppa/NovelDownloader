# Chapter 17: Golden Prodigy, All Sides Stir!

"Auspicious sign from heaven, golden potential!"

These eight characters appeared in Bai Zhan's mind.

However, Bai Zhan's expression grew even grimmer.

He let out a bitter laugh. "This time, I admit defeat. I never thought that a mere Heng City could produce such a talent, one unseen in the human race for a century."

Bai Zhan took a deep breath, his expression turning incredibly resolute. He gazed at the auspicious sign in the sky, knowing full well that even as a Golden Body Realm expert, he couldn't possibly conceal such a phenomenon. Since he couldn't, then...

He must obstruct!

He must obstruct it before other human powerhouses arrived! Even if he died, Su Yu couldn't suffer the slightest harm! This was the future hope of the human race!

Meanwhile, dozens of miles outside Heng City, a middle-aged man suddenly looked towards its direction. Staring at the golden-glowing Heng City, the middle-aged man's brows furrowed slightly. "I just left a short while ago, how could such a change occur in Heng City?"

The middle-aged man's face showed intense weariness; his clothes were dusty, and he looked incredibly dishevelled. This person was none other than Li Tianhe, who had fled. Li Tianhe took a deep look in Heng City's direction, then drew a deep breath.

It was as if an invisible path lay beneath his feet. With each step the old man took, the distance beneath his feet seemed to instantly stretch. And his destination was none other than Heng City!

In a deep mountain range in Jiangnan Province, deep within the mountain, there was a massive cave. From the outside, the cave appeared to be just a plain, unremarkable opening, but as one's gaze delved deeper into it, one would discover that the entire mountain seemed to have been hollowed out. Inside the giant mountain, there was a structure resembling a palace. In this place where sunlight could not reach, it was paradoxically brightly lit. Large luminous pearls cast their glow, illuminating the entire cave.

Within the palace, figures in black robes sat silently around a round table. The round table was enormous, with a full twelve seats. However, some of the seats were empty. Only eight people were present.

"An auspicious sign descends from heaven! The human race will produce another Sealed King!" A hoarse voice rang out from the black-robed figure at the head of the table. The voice was incredibly grating, like shards of glass scraping across the ground.

Instantly, the eyes of the remaining seven flickered, and they exchanged glances. "Boss, he actually took action personally!" Others might not know, but they were very well aware. Their Boss was a genuine Grandmaster-level expert! Even among all the human cults, he was a top-tier figure.

"Very well. Since Boss has taken action, we shall simply wait here."

"Agreed!"

Immediately after, silence once again settled over the round table.

Heng City.

It was night, but with the appearance of the auspicious sign, the people of Heng City pushed open their doors and drew back their windows, gazing at the anomaly in the sky.
