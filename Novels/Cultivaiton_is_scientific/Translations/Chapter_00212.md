# Chapter 212 Research

Li Shimin sat in a corner of the Alchemy Hall, refining "Shushan Primordial Pills"—a cultivation-assisting elixir for early Foundation Establishment stage cultivators. This was a proprietary formula developed by a senior alchemist of the Shushan Sect. 

The advantage of the "Shushan Primordial Pills" lay in the fact that all required first and second-grade spiritual herbs were cultivated by the sect. Disciples could either exchange contribution points for the herbs or directly obtain the finished pills.

Master Ma paid him no attention at the moment, being occupied with his own tasks. He had already demonstrated the pill refinement process for Li Shimin once, explaining all the key techniques without reservation. During the demonstration, Master Ma had even allowed Li Shimin to observe with his spiritual sense, providing him with firsthand data on refining second-grade spiritual pills.

Though Li Shimin hadn't personally refined them before, his experience with first-grade pills made the transition relatively smooth. He carefully controlled the temperature of the spiritual charcoal within the Three Revolutions Heavenly Treasure Furnace, adjusting it precisely to the required level for pill refinement.

As the medicinal aroma wafted from the furnace, Master Ma glanced over with a slight upward curl of his lips, apparently pleased. Li Shimin flicked his fingers, executing the Seven-Finger Pill Collection Technique. Seven pills flew out from the furnace into a jade vial.

He shook his head slightly—it wasn't a full batch, and only two were high-grade "Shushan Primordial Pills," with the rest being medium-grade. This indicated issues with his control over the medicinal properties. 

Despite having IBMz15 collecting data and analyzing every aspect of the refinement process—essentially cheating—he wasn't satisfied with these results. After cleaning the Three Revolutions Heavenly Treasure Furnace (which Master Ma had gifted him and which he'd managed to refine to 30% mastery overnight, just enough for basic pill refinement), Li Shimin began another batch.

With materials provided by Master Ma, he didn't need to worry about resources. His second attempt yielded ten pills, most of which were high-grade. By the fifth refinement, he had mastered every step perfectly, producing only high-grade pills.

Master Ma, having paused his own work, watched Li Shimin's progress with amazement. The young man's ability to correct mistakes—never repeating them—was unlike any other alchemist he'd seen. Most spoke of relying on "feel," but Li Shimin seemed to work toward an exact standard.

"Master, I've learned to refine the 'Shushan Primordial Pills,'" Li Shimin announced, holding up a vial of ten high-grade pills.

"Continue refining then. Consider it a sect mission to accumulate cultivation resources for yourself," Master Ma replied casually, though inwardly impressed. He wanted to see if Li Shimin could maintain such standards with more challenging formulas.

Over the following days, Li Shimin refined pills daily. The high-grade pills he produced were mixed with lower-grade ones for sect distribution, surprising many disciples who rarely encountered high-grade versions. Normally, only intermediate alchemists handled this formula, and even veterans couldn't guarantee high-grade results. Senior alchemists and masters wouldn't bother with such basic pills, reserving their skills for higher-tier formulas.

On the third day, something extraordinary happened. As Li Shimin tapped the furnace to collect pills, one stood out—shimmering with purple aura, the mark of a perfect-grade pill. This was his first perfect-grade refinement.

Perfect-grade pills were legendary—not only supremely effective but also free from the diminishing returns of tolerance. In theory, one could consume them indefinitely without needing to switch formulas. Yet their appearance was considered purely luck-based, unpredictable even for master alchemists.

"Why did this happen?" Li Shimin refused to believe it was mere chance. IBMz15's exhaustive records showed no discernible difference in this batch. His near-flawless execution of the Golden Sun Fire Control Technique, Willow Sensing Technique, and Seven-Finger Collection Technique should have produced uniform results.

While cleaning the furnace afterward, he noticed subtle changes in residual medicinal energies. A hypothesis formed. "Master, may I take materials to refine in my cave residence?" he asked, needing privacy for further experiments.

Master Ma granted him a hundred sets of materials, trusting his skills. Li Shimin was already operating at intermediate alchemist level—the highest for Foundation Establishment-stage pills. To advance, he'd need deeper alchemical knowledge or to nurture his Crimson Sun Spiritual Flame to second-grade, enabling refinement of all Foundation Establishment-level materials.

Returning to Swordholding Peak, Li Shimin sensed his doppelganger Li Yuanba's breakthrough in sword intent. Smiling, he flicked a thread of sword intent through the air—a perk of their shared consciousness. While Li Yuanba's sword cultivation talents far surpassed his own, their connection allowed seamless transfer of insights, particularly the intangible aspects like sword intent that normally defied teaching.

In his cave, Li Shimin finally experimented freely, placing the furnace inside his machine room space. Here, micrometer-level control allowed unprecedented precision, surpassing even the specialized alchemy techniques. IBMz15 recorded every variable, especially the furnace's internal changes.

Each batch took about an hour and a half. After six days of meticulous refinement—twenty-odd batches—another perfect pill appeared. Analysis revealed its secret: a rare substance accumulated during refinement, which the pill absorbed at a critical moment. This substance formed sparingly—roughly enough every ten batches to produce one perfect pill. His first success had been extraordinarily lucky.

Most alchemists could never isolate this ephemeral substance, but in his machine room, Li Shimin could micromanage its collection. What others considered random, he could now systematize—turning the mythical perfect pill into a reproducible achievement.
