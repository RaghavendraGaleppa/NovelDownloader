# Chapter 13: The Eternal Verdant Sacred Body! The Thirteenth Reserve Vessel!

At dawn, the sun rose, and the weather was splendid.

Li Zhengjing woke up feeling refreshed and invigorated.

It had been many days since he last felt so at ease.

Perhaps it was because, after reaching the Internal Qi realm, his qi circulated throughout his body, nourishing his organs and relaxing his limbs.

But the greater reason was that now that he had attained the Internal Qi realm, the "life-and-death trial" of the inner sect examination was no longer a death sentence.

Thinking of this, he recalled the words on the golden page: within three days, he must find a way to heal his organ injuries and obtain the complete "Organ-Nourishing Internal Qi Technique."

It turned out that he didn’t need three days to cultivate Internal Qi—rather, within those three days, he would face a life-or-death calamity!

Had he not made a breakthrough at the critical moment, he would have already been buried in the belly of a beast!

"Last night before I slept, the 'Fortune' section on the golden page was blank. I wonder what it says now..."

With this thought, he closed his eyes and focused his mind, looking at the golden page.

**Li Zhengjing, age 17, Early Internal Qi Realm.**  
**Surface Identity:** Outer Sect Disciple of the Ancient Moon Peak, Yu Hua Immortal Sect.  
**True Identity:** Second Son of Marquis Jian'an.  
**Hidden Identity:** The Thirteenth Reserve Vessel of the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord.  

**The Thousand Illusions Divine Lord believes that despite practicing an incomplete technique, you not only avoided organ damage but also nurtured a strand of Internal Qi. He has preliminarily confirmed you as the once-in-a-millennium 'Eternal Verdant Sacred Body.'**  

**As a result, your ranking among the reserve vessels has risen by over 700 places, placing you as the Thirteenth Reserve Vessel—now highly valued!**  

**Congratulations on your promotion! You are one step closer to becoming the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord!**  

"Congratulations, my ass! Should I say thank you?" Li Zhengjing cursed under his breath before shifting his gaze to the "Fortune" section.

**Fortune:** After cultivating the "Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi," the sword energy's sharpness becomes too intense, piercing through your body—leaving you riddled with holes, your organs ruptured, and your appearance unrecognizable.  

**Afterward, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord flies into a rage, dismembers you, grinds your bones to dust, and leaves no trace of your corpse!**  

"Is there no shred of humanity left? After dying so horribly, I still get dismembered, pulverized, and left without even a complete corpse? How utterly inhumane!"  

Li Zhengjing cursed inwardly before another thought struck him: "And why would I even cultivate that damn 'Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi'? I'd rather die than practice that!"  

As this thought crossed his mind, his body suddenly stiffened, as if he had realized something. His eyes flickered with complex emotions.  

He clenched his fists, and the light in his eyes grew even brighter.  

"That bastard Thousand Illusions Divine Lord thinks I'm some so-called 'Eternal Verdant Sacred Body,' which is why I managed to cultivate Internal Qi despite practicing an incomplete technique?"  

"Does that mean he doesn’t know that I healed my organ injuries with the Five Elements Creation Tree? And that I obtained the complete 'Organ-Nourishing Internal Qi Technique' from the library using the 'Mystic Character Selection Art' from Mount Wuding?"  

"He... isn’t omniscient!"  

His eyes gradually brightened as he thought, "Moreover, it seems the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord isn’t monitoring my every move at all times!"  

"Come to think of it, I’m just an outer sect disciple of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect. Even if that bastard considers me a reserve vessel, I was originally ranked seven hundred and sixty-third."  

"Even though I’m handsome and dignified—enough to please the eye—there’s no reason for him to stare at me twenty-four hours a day!"  

With this realization, Li Zhengjing felt even more invigorated.  

Since the other party had chosen a hands-off approach, he might still have a chance to escape his fate—especially with the help of the golden page!  

With this thought, he prepared to dig up the remaining half of the Five Elements Creation Tree to brew more Five Elements Creation Paste and cultivate the "Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Breaking Technique" to strengthen his Internal Qi.  

But after glancing at the shattered courtyard gate, he decided to repair it first. After all, he hadn’t yet passed the inner sect examination and would still be living here for a few more days.  

His cultivation of the "Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Breaking Technique" still needed to remain hidden. Moreover, aside from the Five Elements Creation Tree, there was also a chest of gold and silver in the courtyard. Leaving the gate broken would make him uneasy.  

Just as he was about to find planks to fix the gate, a familiar voice called out to him.  

"Senior Brother Li!"  

The fake medicine peddler grinned and waved. "I’ve brought you the medicine cauldron!"  

He was in high spirits. Establishing a connection with an inner sect disciple was no easy feat, given the difference in status.  

But thanks to his sharp judgment, he had swallowed the loss and sold the cauldron at a low price, forging this relationship before Li Zhengjing officially became an inner sect disciple.  

Though he had purchased the cauldron for ninety taels of silver and originally planned to sell it for five hundred, selling it for just one hundred still made his heart ache. But now, it seemed worth it.  

"I heard this morning that Senior Brother Li displayed immense prowess, slaying a spirit beast barehanded with unmatched bravery!"  

The fake medicine peddler cupped his hands in congratulations. "Congratulations on reaching the Internal Qi realm! Also, I bring news..."  

"What news?" Li Zhengjing asked.  

"Regarding last night’s incident with the rampaging spirit beast, the outer sect supervisors responsible for oversight are now being held accountable!"  

The fake medicine peddler continued, "The Beast Taming Hall disciples responsible for training the spirit beast are still under interrogation, but five outer sect supervisors have already been expelled from the mountain for their negligence!"  

"They’ve been sent to serve in various government offices outside the sect. Unless they accomplish great deeds, they’ll never be allowed to return!"  

Being expelled from the mountain didn’t mean expulsion from the sect—they would still belong to the Yu Hua Immortal Sect, but their status would be lower than those remaining within the mountain.  

Moreover, the Yu Hua Immortal Sect was situated on a blessed land abundant with spiritual energy, greatly beneficial for cultivation and even extending one’s lifespan.  

For outer sect supervisors over sixty years old, whose vitality was already waning, being exiled to the mortal world meant losing the nourishing spiritual energy. This not only dashed their faint hopes of reaching the "True Qi Realm" but also shortened their lifespans.  

From the perspectives of status, cultivation, and even lifespan, this punishment was severe.  

"If I’m not mistaken," Li Zhengjing said calmly, "those five supervisors must be Chen Youyu, Zhou Shaojie, Fan Guilin, Wu Chi, and Lin Bixiu."  

Chen Youyu was obvious, but during last night’s chaos, the other four supervisors had delayed entering his courtyard by fifty breaths—clearly intending for the spirit beast to silence him permanently.  

Now, he realized that the tampering with his "Organ-Nourishing Internal Qi Technique" must have involved figures at the supervisor level. With these five exposed, the puzzle was complete.  

"They probably saw that I’ve reached the Internal Qi realm and feared exposure. So they’re using this punishment as an excuse to leave the mountain and avoid trouble."  

After a moment of contemplation, he asked another question and finally pieced together the full picture.  

Chen Youyu came from the Chen Clan, while the other four supervisors were retainers of the Chen family.  

"From what I know, those four supervisors always looked down on Chen Youyu’s despicable behavior and wouldn’t take orders from him," the fake medicine peddler said hesitantly. "I suspect the mastermind behind last night’s attack wasn’t Chen Youyu, but someone higher up!"  

Li Zhengjing took out some silver. "Find out everything you can about Elder Yuan Zhengfeng—who among the higher-ups did he offend?"  

Then he added, "Where has Chen Youyu been assigned after being expelled?"  

The fake medicine peddler thought for a moment. "I heard he’s being sent to the Hundred Spirits Prefecture, but I’m not sure which district. I’ll look into it..."  

As he turned to leave, he noticed the wooden planks and raised an eyebrow.  

"The inner sect examination is still a few days away. I’ll be staying here a while longer," Li Zhengjing explained.  

"You could just have a labor disciple handle this," the fake medicine peddler said before suddenly pausing. "Wait... you don’t know?"  

"Know what?" Li Zhengjing frowned.  

"Your feat of slaying the spirit beast barehanded has spread not only through the outer sect but also reached the inner sect," the fake medicine peddler said seriously. "Because of you, this month’s inner sect examination has been moved up!"  

"Li Zhengjing!"  

Another outer sect supervisor appeared outside the courtyard and called out loudly, "The inner sect examination begins in one hour! Prepare yourself—Elder Gao from the inner sect will arrive shortly!"
