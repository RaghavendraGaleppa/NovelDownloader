# Chapter 94: Perfect Dao Rhyme

After a detailed explanation.

"How interesting! Truly fascinating! Young man, you're quite clever to come up with such an amusing thing~ Are you really giving this to me?" Infant Lord gazed at Zhang Jing with eager anticipation.

Meeting his gaze, Zhang Jing nodded slowly:
"I brought it here specifically to give to Infant Lord."

"Hehe, wonderful!" Infant Lord clapped his tiny hands excitedly. "Young man, you're truly kind. Rest assured, I won't treat you poorly."

"Infant Lord, I came this time to comprehend the Moonlight Dragon Python Dao Intent. Could the spirit essence cost be... reduced?" Zhang Jing ventured cautiously.

Hearing this, Infant Lord's face immediately showed a hint of embarrassment before he replied apologetically:
"Ah! About that... I'm afraid I can't help you there, young man. I don't have the authority to reduce the cost. The amount of spirit essence consumed depends entirely on how long you spend comprehending the Dao Intent."

"Moonlight Dragon Python Dao Intent, right? Understood."

Without waiting for Zhang Jing's response, Infant Lord waved his small hand, and Zhang Jing's figure vanished instantly.

Left alone, Infant Lord scratched his head and muttered to himself in mild distress: "Ah, what should I give him in return? Maybe I should tell him about—"

Just then, the left gate creaked open slightly, revealing a pair of curious eyes peering through the gap.

Seeing this, Infant Lord bristled like a startled cat. He stomped over angrily and gave the gate a fierce kick with his tiny foot.

With a loud 'bang', the left gate slammed shut again.

Infant Lord's voice, trying to sound fierce but coming out adorably stern, followed immediately: "What are you looking at? This is a wonderful gift for me! If you're so clever, get someone to give you one too~"

As soon as the words left his mouth, he hoisted the mountain-like 'transforming blocks' like a thief making off with treasure and scurried back through the right gate.

Meanwhile...

Darkness enveloped Zhang Jing's vision before he found himself in an unfamiliar space.

The surroundings were completely empty, save for a small meditation cushion placed quietly before him.

"Is this where I'll comprehend the Moonlight Dragon Python Dao Intent?" Zhang Jing examined the cushion thoughtfully.

Suddenly, Infant Lord's voice sounded beside his ear:
"Zhang Jing, sit on the cushion and silently will yourself to begin comprehension."

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Jing settled onto the cushion.

His illusory mind's eye slowly opened.

At the same time...

A crimson spiritual light and a hazy, chaotic glow emanated from within him, intertwining and shimmering with profound mysteries.

Zhang Jing's eyes became as still as ancient wells.

"Begin comprehension!" he declared inwardly.

In an instant, the empty surroundings dissolved, replaced by an abyssal, profound void.

Zhang Jing's pupils constricted sharply.

No words could possibly describe the scene before him—all language seemed inadequate in the face of such majesty.

In his field of vision...

An immeasurably vast celestial body emitting faint, cold radiance slowly crushed through endless void space, appearing countless billions of miles ahead.

Majestic! Ancient! Eternal!

"Moon Star!"

The name surfaced naturally in Zhang Jing's mind the moment he beheld the magnificent celestial body.

Before he could process this...

Roar!

A primordial bellow, as if from the dawn of time, suddenly resounded.

An enormous dark dragon of incalculable length emerged slowly from the void, coiling around the Moon Star.

"An immortal ancient variant—Moonlight Python Dragon!"

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened.

The Moonlight Dragon Python Dao Intent originated precisely from this very creature, from the interwoven principles and truths manifested in its form.

Time became meaningless.

When the visions finally faded, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes.

A jade talisman materialized before him:

[Dark Python Devours Void Dao Rhyme (Perfect)]

"The next step is to transform this into Moonlight Dragon Python Dao Intent. I'll need to accumulate much more spirit essence!"

Zhang Jing resolved inwardly.

The path might be difficult, but he felt confident. With a full year remaining, there should be ample time.

Moreover...

Having directly witnessed the Dao Intent this time, Zhang Jing faintly understood why constructing a superior Dao foundation required over a dozen Dao Rhymes or a trace of Dao Intent.

The fundamental reason was the sheer vastness and profundity of Dao Intent.

A mere superior-grade inheritance couldn't possibly encapsulate even a ten-thousandth of its essence, recording only the most minuscule fragment.

Even the Moonlight Dragon Python Dao Intent likely only captured a portion of the principles embodied by the Moonlight Python Dragon, not its entirety.

As these thoughts swirled in his mind...

The scenery shifted abruptly.

A small face popped into view.

"Zhang Jing, how was your comprehension?" Infant Lord asked with a beaming smile.

"Thanks to Infant Lord's blessing, I've gained immensely," Zhang Jing replied gratefully.

"Excellent." Infant Lord nodded approvingly, then pointed to the haphazardly scrambled 'transforming blocks' floating midair. His expression turned serious: "You gave me such a wonderful gift, and I'm not one to be stingy."

"Let me tell you a great secret."

"I'm all ears!" Zhang Jing responded solemnly, his expression grave.

The look on Infant Lord's face made it clear—this would be no ordinary revelation.

"Do you know how many Dao Intents exist here?" Infant Lord clasped his hands behind his back, adopting a profoundly wise demeanor. "Three hundred and sixty-five! These form the foundational—"

Mid-sentence, terror suddenly contorted Infant Lord's features.

His mouth opened, but no sound emerged.

After a moment...

Infant Lord, who had inexplicably fallen to his knees, gradually regained composure.

He glanced upward involuntarily before rising with a bitter smile:

"Zhang Jing, I'm sorry. I can't tell you directly. All I can say now is that the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven holds great secrets within its various Void Heavens. If fate permits, you'll discover them yourself. Only then can I explain further."

"But if you lack the affinity—"

Infant Lord left the implication hanging.

Zhang Jing understood perfectly.

Without the destined opportunity, nothing could be done.

"I understand. Thank you for the guidance, Infant Lord."

Zhang Jing expressed sincere gratitude.

This single piece of information was worth infinitely more than the so-called 'transforming blocks'.

"Um, Zhang Jing..." Infant Lord suddenly looked at him with uncharacteristic shyness. "About these 'transforming blocks'... could you teach me how to solve them? I can't seem to get them back to normal."

Zhang Jing's eye twitched.

A three-thousand-layered puzzle cube? Who in the world knew how to restore that?

After brief contemplation, he met Infant Lord's gaze with utmost sincerity:

"Infant Lord, if I simply told you the solution, would it still be interesting? Think differently—if you could deduce the method yourself, wouldn't that better demonstrate your extraordinary wisdom?"

Infant Lord nodded thoughtfully, then patted his chest confidently:

"You're absolutely right! With my supreme intellect, I'll definitely figure it out."

Deep within the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven...

"'Transforming blocks'? How intriguing! This little fellow Zhang Jing is quite interesting."

"Since you're interested, fellow Daoist, shall we make a wager? Let's stake the previous Changli Realm."

"What are the rules?"

"No using the laws of blessed lands. No employing supernatural abilities. We'll simultaneously attempt to restore a transforming block with one hundred million pieces per side. The faster one wins."

"Agreed!"
