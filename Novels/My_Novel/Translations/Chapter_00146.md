# Chapter 146: The Jade Water Strange Pearl, The Tyrant of Qingning

The treasure pearl was about the size of a knuckle on a finger. Its surface was smooth and round, resembling jade but not jade, resembling grease but not grease. It felt slippery and cool to the touch, a very unique sensation.

Placed in the palm of his hand, it emitted a lush, emerald light, which was incredibly beautiful.

This world was vast, and within heaven and earth lay "rare treasures and strange objects" with infinite uses. Whether one could obtain them depended entirely on fate. Li Xian had asked Miao Xichun about it; this item was obtained by chance from a giant, colorful clam.

Miao Xichun had just acquired this treasure but had not yet tested its use when his tracks were leaked, causing a dispute. He was forced to hand it over helplessly.

Li Xian thought to himself, "I am ignorant and have seen too little. I possess a treasure but do not know its effect. No matter what, I shall try to figure it out."

A flash of inspiration struck him. He adjusted and circulated his Internal Qi, pouring it into the pearl.

The pearl’s light indeed flared brightly, illuminating the entire room. However, glowing was certainly not its true purpose. Li Xian paced back and forth, pondering once more.

"Right, I have the Tiger Saliva Stone. That thing is half a rare treasure itself. Is this item's effect similar to it?"

Li Xian suddenly had a wild idea.

The Tiger Saliva Stone was soaked in cold water and drunk to strengthen the blood and qi, calming the mind and aiding sleep. However, Li Xian’s blood and qi were already abundant, surpassing even tigers and leopards. The Tiger Saliva Stone was now useless and had been gradually forgotten.

He immediately fetched a bowl of water.

He placed the Jade Pearl into the bowl, observing it closely... but the water did not change color. It was clearly different from the Tiger Saliva Stone.

"Forget it, I'll take my time figuring it out." Li Xian felt a great sense of disappointment and was about to give up.

Just at that moment, he noticed something strange. Although the water had not changed, tiny bubbles were emerging around the Jade Pearl. It was hard to detect, but Li Xian had sharp eyesight and barely caught sight of them.

Li Xian let out a soft sound of surprise and immediately drank the water. He carefully sensed the changes in his body. Aside from feeling exceptionally cool and the summer heat inside him dissolving somewhat, there were no other sensations.

"Could it be..." Li Xian’s mind was agile; he had glimpsed a clue and let his thoughts wander. "Miao Xichun said this item came from a clam. It must be related to water. I placed it in water, and bubbles fizzed out. Is it oxygen?"

He immediately walked out of the room.

In the southeast corner of the inner courtyard, there was an abandoned water vat filled with moss and filth. He utilized the Green Jade Palm and lightly slapped the wall of the vat.

He shook off all the moss on the inner side without damaging the vat in the slightest. Finally, he washed it clean with water and filled it with cold water.

Li Xian placed the "Jade Pearl" in his mouth, pressing it under his tongue. He dipped his head into the water vat.

The water wrapped around his head and body, cutting off the oxygen.

Li Xian felt a cool sensation all over; the pressure of the water gradually vanished. Instead, it felt like riding the wind and flying, free and unfettered, an indescribable sense of pleasure.

The Jade Pearl continuously provided energy.

Li Xian did not need to breathe and could stay underwater for a long time.

So this item was actually the rare "Jade Water Pearl." Its strange use was rare, allowing one to survive underwater for long periods, like aquatic creatures.

"Holding onto this, it might prove unexpectedly effective in the future!" Li Xian spat out the Jade Water Pearl and carefully hid it.

That night.

He returned to the Yi He Manor.

Having stumbled upon a strange treasure, he was filled with excitement. Seeing the lake right beside the manor, he was eager to try it out. He placed the Jade Water Pearl in his mouth, pressed it under his tongue, and jumped into the lake.

The lake water was dark green.

Li Xian opened his eyes and swam freely in the water. With the Jade Water Pearl in his mouth, his swimming technique was actually enhanced. With a gentle sweep of his hand, he traveled several zhang.

He stayed for half an hour without needing to breathe.

Only then, fully satisfied, did he quietly sneak back to the manor.

The next day.

The sky had just cleared.

The three halls and two sects kept their promise, each sending fifty taels of silver. Because of this incident, Lieutenant Wu Wei had firmly established his footing.

Even those who were unconvinced dared not speak out.

Fifty taels of silver was actually not much. According to what Li Xian knew, martial apprentices at martial halls had to pay a hundred taels a year for tuition and miscellaneous fees.

Those sects extorted the people, and their hands involved shops, halls, and various trades. They were all wealthy to the extreme.

The common people in the market had heard of yesterday's events. Words of praise were endless, and unconsciously, Li Xian had gained quite a reputation.

The remaining small halls and sects, fearing to offend Li Xian, followed suit one after another, offering silver as a sign of submission.

From now on, they would follow the Lieutenant's lead.

Adding everything up, it came to five hundred taels of silver. Li Xian’s first order of business was to "recruit troops and buy horses."

Expand the patrol team, fill the positions of the Lieutenant's Hall, and recruit clerks, accountants... and so on.

In this way, the Lieutenant's Hall took on a proper form and looked the part.

Li Xian laid down strict rules. His subordinates dared not disobey. Li Xian also led by example, training martial arts diligently despite the wind and sun. This influenced the patrol team invisibly.

Every morning, before dawn, the outer courtyard of the Lieutenant's Hall would already be filled with the sounds of training: "Hoo," "Ha," "Hey."

The momentum was soaring. As the beam is straight, so are the pillars.

The Lieutenant's Hall was thriving, at the height of its power.

However, this also created a strange phenomenon. The patrolmen of the county yamen inquired several times about transferring to the Lieutenant's Hall.

Those serving in the yamen were usually enough to bully the common folk. But if they encountered sect disciples or martial hall apprentices, they had to detour and dare not cause trouble.

The Lieutenant's Hall was the exact opposite, specifically looking for trouble with the sects, and with Lieutenant Wu Wei presiding, how imposing it was. Who wouldn't envy it?

Li Xian held several positions and traveled between the manor and the county.

He also saw that Ding Hu’s ability was decent, and he was well-informed about the affairs of the manor, perhaps even better than Li Xian himself.

So he was quite relieved, asking about things only at night and not interfering much. He poured more energy into his career in the county.

Jumping out of the Madam's grasp and breaking into his own world. Of course, this small world was also tacitly approved by the Madam. If not, if the Madam clapped her hands together, it would all vanish into thin air.

That evening, Li Xian returned to the manor, and the Madam sent someone to summon him.

The Madam was as beautiful as ever. She had Li Xian massage her feet and serve her for another night.

It was midnight before she raised her eyebrows slightly and casually said, "The silk materials have arrived. I allow you to purchase second-grade silk materials. If you want them, go to the Mulberry Circle yourself."

Li Xian was overjoyed upon hearing this. The next morning, he rode a horse to the Mulberry Circle.

Before going into business, he had no concept of money. Once he went into business, he realized just how wealthy the Madam was.

Silkworms are divided into good and bad, and silk is divided into superior and inferior.

The silkworms at the Mulberry Circle were cultivated by the Madam using secret methods and belonged to a rare, exotic species. Their silk was tough, translucent in texture, and unafraid of water or fire. It could be used to make armor and weapons at the high end, and silkworm clothes and beautiful garments at the low end.

Even the second-grade silk was not cheap. For one cocoon, it was one tael. The Madam, considering Li Xian was one of her own and couldn't afford much silver, sold it at a thirty percent discount.

It still cost seven hundred wen.

Li Xian already had some money. He gritted his teeth and made a hard decision. He spent several hundred taels, got a sufficient amount of silk material, and hired skilled female tailors to weave the clothes.

In a few days, four silkworm clothes were made. As soon as they were finished, they were hugely popular, attracting the wealthy merchants of the city to watch and bid to buy them.

It must be known that superior fabrics usually flowed to the prefecture city and were directly reserved by high officials and nobles.

They never flowed to the market.

Even with money, it was hard to buy them. In this world, money was important, but connections were also important.

What the Madam considered second-grade material was top-grade treasure material within Qingning County. The appearance of the silkworm clothes shook Qingning.

The landlords, aristocratic families, and sects in the city were all envious, as if wearing a silkworm clothes would make them superior. They bought them at high prices one after another.

The four silkworm clothes were sold out in just one day. After subtracting the cost of the silk, he earned three hundred taels of silver.

The pity was... the silk was not available every day.

Li Xian, as a "Lieutenant," suppressed the sects and martial halls, and was now gradually building an industry. Looking around Qingning County, he was a figure of some size.

Having power in the county, benefits came one after another.

In Qingning County, many small merchants and vendors, hearing that Li Xian acted decisively and was open and aboveboard, came to pay respects one after another, wishing to register their industries under Li Xian's name.

From then on, half of the monthly profits would go to Li Xian, in exchange for the safety of their lives and property.

Li Xian thought to himself, "A great man takes what he should and does not take what he shouldn't. My current income is considerable, so I shall not take their living expenses."

He made it clear to those merchants.

In this way.

Li Xian ran his business while practicing martial arts.

More than ten days passed.

That day, he looked over the accounts.

The operating funds of the Lieutenant's Hall were all borne by him alone. Including the salaries of the staff, it cost over forty taels a month.

The clothing shop business was on the right track. With funds, he introduced expensive fabrics and silks. He had quite a few tailors under him, responsible for cutting, weaving, embroidery... and various tasks.

These also required funds to maintain.

In this way, Li Xian could also stand on his own, with many people under him relying on him for their livelihood.

Li Xian was also happy to help.

Apart from the money needed to maintain the operation of the "Lieutenant's Hall" and the "Clothing Shop," the silver Li Xian had on hand had accumulated to five hundred taels.

Following this trend,加上 the management fees submitted by the various sects, he could earn seven hundred taels of silver a month.

Li Xian closed the ledger and felt a surge of emotion. "Where did I dare to imagine such a scene in the past? I once sold myself into servitude for five hundred wen, and now I earn seven hundred taels of silver a month."

"However... to forge iron, one must be strong themselves. The more I learn, the greater the danger I face!唯有 by constantly improving and practicing, leaving the danger behind, can I last long!"

Lieutenant's Hall.

Deep in the inner courtyard.

Li Xian banished distracting thoughts and began to practice martial arts. The inner courtyard was quiet and secluded, with only the sound of swords and blades dancing.

Li Xian had a graceful posture, holding a blade with one hand and executing the "Great Luo Blade Art." The blade art was perfected, and the blade momentum was flawless.

For basic martial arts, small success depends on effort, great success depends on understanding, perfection depends on talent, and reaching the peak depends on destiny.

The blade wind blew gently, bringing about strange sounds. It was like a melody, very pleasant to the ear. Li Xian, in high spirits, felt that just dancing the blade was a bit boring. He spun around and drew his fine steel sword in one fluid motion.

He executed two sets of martial arts simultaneously.

\[Great Luo Blade Art\]

\[Proficiency: 4150/10000 (Perfected)\]

\[Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword\]

\[Proficiency: 5123/12000 (Great Success)\]

He was proficient in both sword and blade. The blade art was open and expansive, while the sword art was scorching and aggressive.

When he had fully expressed his excitement, he sheathed the sword and put away the blade.

Li Xian exhaled a long breath of turbid air, suppressing his boiling Yang energy.

"The Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword is a superior sword art with many mysteries. It is beyond my ability to fully comprehend. The Madam taught me this sword art, making me endure the scorching heat often. My sword skills are becoming more refined, and the Yang fire within me is accumulating and hard to release."

"I must seek her to perform the dual-sword union again to continue practicing. Otherwise, it will burn my blood and qi and damage my physical body."

"I have been busy making money recently and have slacked off in my martial arts training. The weather is great today, and I have free time. I can try to practice this martial art!"

He wiped away his sweat and sat on a stone bench in the courtyard. He took a book from his chest.

The cover was tough, made of some kind of beast hide, with a dull yellow color. It was called "Iron Copper Body."

The place for trading martial arts in Qingning County was called the "Hundred Martial Pavilion."

It contained many martial arts.

After Li Xian had money, he went to the pavilion to select martial arts. However, he was slightly disappointed. Basic martial arts were varied and diverse, with a wide variety.

This was something the Yi He Manor could not match.

However, "lower-tier martial arts" were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, hard to find a book.

And... the Hundred Martial Pavilion had a rule.

Basic martial arts usually sold for only a hundred taels of silver. However, buyers would use three hundred taels to purchase the martial art.

The extra two hundred taels would "lock" this martial art.

Latercomers could only buy the martial art if they offered more than three hundred taels.

This raised the threshold and reduced the number of people learning similar martial arts.

After all, martial arts were related to one's life and property.

This caused the prices of martial arts in the pavilion to be inflated and not cost-effective. Only a few of the most common basic martial arts, which were not locked, were barely sold at a fair price.
