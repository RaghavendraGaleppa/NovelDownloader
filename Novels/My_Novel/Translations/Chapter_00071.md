# Chapter 71: A Feint to the East, Urgent Firefighting

Several members of the Black Water Gang walked out of the gambling den and headed straight out of the city gate.

It was already night, so dark that one could not see their own hand in front of their face. Having lost money, the men were naturally in a foul mood, cursing heaven and earth with an air of malice.

Seeing the road was pitch black, they cursed as they lit a fire striker.

Li Xian followed behind, secretly delighted. This made it even easier not to lose them.

*It seems Xiao Fan is not in the city.*

After walking for more than ten *li*, the group turned a corner and passed through a mountain pass.

Deep in the forest stood a large mansion with flickering lights, its scale quite impressive. Li Xian frowned, guessing that Xiao Fan was inside.

He watched as the few gang members walked up to the mansion and knocked. Shortly after, a servant came to open the gate.

"Brothers of the Black Water Gang, you have returned. Did you make a fortune?"

"Bad luck, bad luck. We lost quite a bit."

"Please come inside."

"By the way, does the Young Master have any instructions?"

"No, no instructions."

The Black Water Gang had many hands. These few were off duty today, had some spare cash, and felt the itch, so they spent the whole day at the gambling den, only returning at night.

They chatted for a moment in front of the gate, then closed it, restoring the silence.

*So, Zheng Caiqi of the Black Water Gang has colluded with Liu Yuanwai of Huangyu County to imprison my younger brother here.*

*In that case, things have become easier. The gang members and Liu Yuanwai's servants certainly aren't familiar with each other. I can blend in to investigate.*

Li Xian moved lightly, pressing himself against the wall.

At the base of the wall, he scraped off some wall dust and smeared it on his face, making his skin look dark and dirty.

He looked around.

He then saw a large tree with thick branches and lush leaves. He jumped onto the tree, placed his bow and long knife on it, and covered them with leaves.

After finishing these preparations, he quietly waited for an opportunity.

*The scale of this mansion is far inferior to the Yihe Manor. But the operating rules should be similar.*

*At night, guards will patrol. They say they are patrolling, but they are often drowsy and lacking in spirit, making it easiest to take advantage of a gap.*

Li Xian lay in the grass waiting.

Late at night, as expected, guards from the mansion came out, looking around as they patrolled.

There were two groups of patrols.

One group was Liu Yuanwai's guards, the other was from the Black Water Gang.

Suddenly, one guard had an urgent need and ran deep into the forest to relieve himself. Li Xian saw his chance and quietly followed.

"Ahh..."

A stream of liquid flowed.

At the moment the guard was most relaxed, Li Xian activated the "Breeze Leg" and lightly kicked his lower back.

"Ugh..."

In an instant, the twisting force penetrated his body, rendering him completely immobile and on the verge of collapsing.

Li Xian reached out to support him, quickly stripped him of his clothes and put them on, then knocked him unconscious and hid him behind a thicket.

Just like that, he successfully infiltrated the Liu Mansion.

Li Xian was overjoyed; things were progressing smoothly.

Using the patrol to find traces of his younger brother was truly the best method.

The Liu Mansion was indeed large, a four-entry courtyard mansion with rockeries and artificial waters inside, and a beautiful garden. However, compared to the "Yihe Manor," it was still lacking.

He arrived in front of a room with a light on, from which faint conversation could be heard.

Li Xian slowed his pace and listened attentively:

"Seventh Young Master, isn't this a bit inappropriate? With your strength, you will surely be able to claim the title next year's winter exam. Why take such a risky move?"

"Hmph, you didn't participate in the exam, how would you know its difficulty? This year it was thirty-seventh, next year it might be forty-fifth, or even seventy-seventh."

"But..."

"Enough. This time, it is the closest I have ever been to claiming the title. Father told you to obey my commands, so just do as I say."

"That brat couldn't even afford to buy books, why is he ranked before me? If he is allowed to go to the Prefecture City and enter the academy, and even go a step further to seize that mystical fortune, even Father would have to show him some respect."

"Does he deserve it? I wish I could kill him. It would be best if he never existed in this world, then I would be the thirty-sixth, a proper title holder!"

The voice in the room was one old and one young.

It was likely the Seventh Young Master, Zheng Caiqi, and his personal guard.

Li Xian narrowed his eyes, his heart filled with a flash of anger, but he did not stop, moving on to search elsewhere.

"Hey."

Suddenly, a shout came from behind.

A Black Water Gang member with a large knife at his waist called out to Li Xian.

"Eh, why is your face so dirty?" the gang member asked.

"Ah," Li Xian shook his head. "Don't mention it. I was on patrol, suddenly had to pee, and damn it, the ground was so slippery, I fell flat on my face."

"Hahaha," the gang member laughed and slapped his thigh. "You小子, I was wondering why you smelled of urine."

"Go patrol the West Courtyard for me, I need to take a big dump."

Li Xian wanted to investigate the West Courtyard anyway, so he readily agreed. "Sure."

Arriving at the West Courtyard, he saw that the patrols here were tight, mostly consisting of Black Water Gang members.

In front of one of the rooms, two Black Water Gang members stood guard on either side, firmly blocking the door.

"It's here!"

Li Xian's heart skipped a beat as he discreetly sized up the situation.

"Hey, you there, you've got the wrong place!" a member of the Black Water Gang stopped Li Xian. "This isn't your patrol area."

"Oh, it's like this," Li Xian explained. "Just now, one of your guys said he needed to take a dump and asked me to cover his patrol for a bit."

"It must be that Wang Mazi. That lazybones always has to go."

"Alright, you're responsible for this area."

The man pointed to the southwest direction.

"Okay."

Li Xian looked around. He counted about a dozen people here, the defense was tight. With his current strength, forcing his way in would be like courting death.

He also saw that these gang members looked drowsy, slacking off and goofing off. Very few were truly focused. A direct assault was out of the question, but if he used another clever plan, it might just work.

*Why not, in a moment, use a feint to the east while attacking the west.*

Li Xian maintained his composure, showing no flaws, and secretly memorized the layout of the courtyard.

After about an hour, the Wang Mazi who had gone to relieve himself came over and patted Li Xian on the shoulder, laughing. "Brother, thanks. I'll take over here."

"My pleasure."

Li Xian gave a straightforward smile.

After the handover, Li Xian left the West Courtyard. He scooped up some snow from the roof tiles and smeared it on his face, using the coldness of the snow to refresh his spirit.

If he were to execute his plan, the slightest mistake could cost him his life.

*A feint to the east, starting a fire is best!*

Such a large mansion usually has a dedicated stable.

The fodder is dry and catches fire easily. Moreover, people of the martial world value their horses above all else. If the stable catches fire, they are bound to come and put it out.

He immediately found the stable.

There were dozens of horses in the stable, belonging to the Black Water Gang and Liu Yuanwai. There were no lack of fine steeds among them. One in particular had fur as white as snow and eyes that seemed to glow red. Its coat had been carefully groomed, looking even more refined than a person.

It was a Snow Jade White Horse.

*Truly a fine steed.*

*It's a pity it has the wrong master.*

*Who would have thought the gunpowder I bought casually would actually come in handy.*

Li Xian used the gunpowder as a fuse, so that when he started the fire, the flames would spread quickly.

He then made up his mind, blew a fire striker to life, and threw it into the dry hay. He watched as a tiny spark gradually spread, a plume of black smoke drifting out.

With the gunpowder fueling it, the fire spread rapidly. The entire stable was engulfed in raging flames. Not only that, the fire gradually spread to the surrounding buildings.

It was as bright as day.

Waves of heat washed over him.

Li Xian pretended to be panicked and shouted, "Fire! Fire! Hurry, put it out the fire!"

He ran while shouting, waking up the servants and laborers first. With their addition, the situation immediately descended into chaos.

In the midst of the chaos,

Li Xian ran to the West Courtyard and shouted to the Black Water Gang members on patrol, "Quick, quick! The Young Master is calling you to put out the fire! There's a fire!"

"This..."

"What 'this' and 'that'? The fire is at the stable. If the Young Master's fine horse gets burned, can you take the responsibility?!"

"But that kid..."

"He's just a scrawny thing, he can't get far."

"Alright, alright, we're going right now."

The Black Water Gang members spread the word, and in an instant, they all set off, rushing toward the stable.

Taking advantage of the empty space, Li Xian kicked the door open.
