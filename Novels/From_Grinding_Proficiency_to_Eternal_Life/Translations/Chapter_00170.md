Chapter 170: The Character 'Lin' Increases by One Point

The fist edge brushed against the plain gauze. He precisely controlled his knuckles to shift three inches askew—a detail bought with the intelligence of his previous two deaths: a three-inch gap below the woman's ribs concealed an old burn scar.

*Clang!*

The sound of jade striking metal echoed across the mountain peak.

For the first time, the woman retreated half a step. Where she had been struck, ripples of bronze light shimmered.

One punch achieved its effect, yet Xu Yunfan remained utterly calm. His nostrils flared, catching the fleeting scent of scorching. His right fist顺势 transformed from a hammer into a claw, aiming for the woman's throat.

In the transcendent perception granted by the 'Lin' character, a silver pattern on the woman's forehead suddenly flashed.

That silver light lightly tapped the void, and the cold air of the entire snow mountain instantly poured into his open pores.

"Knock on the Heavenly Gate."

As the cold, clear Dao sound rang out, Xu Yunfan was horrified to discover that every drop of his blood had frozen into ice needles.

The mental sea maintaining the 'Lin' character was pierced by thousands of ice spikes. The state of 'Tai Shang Wang Qing' (Great Dao devoid of emotion) actually developed cracks.

The woman's two fingers, pressed together, transformed into a translucent ice spear. The chill flowing from the tip was extreme, almost freezing his body solid.

Xu Yunfan's body was rapidly disintegrating, his blood frozen, but his true spirit sat firmly in the center of his mental sea. Despite the ice spikes wreaking havoc, they were like the Sea-Calming Needle, desperately suppressing the core inch of his mental sea to keep it from shattering.

His expression remained unchanged. Both his body and spirit were on the verge of collapse under the woman's attack, yet his movements did not stop. His blood energy surged like a furnace. As he raised his elbow and stepped forward, the large patches of frost on his body shattered.

In the distorted sense of time, he caught the trajectory of the sword finger. Xu Yunfan twisted his body, sacrificing three broken ribs to avoid his heart's vital point.

However, that sword finger suddenly scattered like willow catkins, splitting into seven hundred and twenty ice threads that entangled his acupoints.

In his eyes, pushed to the extreme by the 'Lin' character, and under the extreme calm, he finally glimpsed the ancient Dao patterns flowing within the ice threads.

His body shuddered violently. He threw a punch, the muscles in his arm bulging. The blood energy of his entire body surged madly into his arm; even his tough skin couldn't hold it, tearing open countless tiny blood wounds.

The fist edge tore through the air. Knuckles shrouded in a white aura accompanied by a rumbling sound, the heavy blow smashed toward the woman's face. Xu Yunfan condensed all his vitality into this single strike.

The Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method, transforming the hammer into a fist, a star falling from the Milky Way!

The moment the fist edge touched the plain gauze.

The ice threads snapped back.

Seven hundred and twenty strands of cold air drilled into his acupoints simultaneously. Xu Yunfan froze in the snow, maintaining his punching posture.

The woman's fingertip lightly tapped his glabella.

"Hah!"

Xu Yunfan shot up from the bed, his back smashing through the thick wall. The involuntary release of force collapsed the solid wooden bed.

He instinctively touched his unharmed throat. The lingering chill from the dream still wandered through the gaps in his jawbone, raising goosebumps all over his body.

"Projection into a Dream!?"

Xu Yunfan's expression was unreadable. After the Incense Fire Cult incident, he naturally knew that extremely powerful beings could detach their spirits from their physical shells. Like the Bright Lord, who forged an Incense Fire Golden Body, still possessing uncanny, ghostly power even in the era of the Decline of Law.

Just who was that woman?

Xu Yunfan instinctively looked at the stream of proficiency information popping up in his vision.

'...'

"You utilized the 'Lin' character, entering a state of a still heart. Your proficiency in the 'Lin' character has increased."

Seeing this specific line of notification from the attribute panel, Xu Yunfan felt a hint of surprise.

Since reaching the entry level of the 'Lin' character, until now, this was the only time it had increased by a single point. This showed just how difficult the cultivation of this secret art was.

What surprised him even more was that the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Method, which should only be wieldable at the Muscle Refining Realm, had been executed by him prematurely.

"Transforming the hammer into a fist..."

Xu Yunfan looked at the fish-belly white rising in the East. Although the proficiency information delighted him, he frowned deeply. What exactly was that woman?

Since cultivating the 'Lin' character, he had never dreamed. Now, not only did he dream, but he was also forcibly pulled into the dream.

If he had held the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in that dream, the result might not have been a clean death in a few moves.

Seeing that it was getting late, he tightened the Extreme Dao Remnant wrapped around his torso like a vest. After dressing and washing up, Xu Yunfan immediately went out with the玄钢机匣 (Mysterious Steel Mechanism Box) and the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer on his back. He arrived at a mountain peak outside the Heavenly Work City and sat cross-legged.

When the first golden thread pierced the clouds, the pores all over Xu Yunfan's body suddenly opened.

The Pure Yang Internal Energy dormant in the depths of his flesh and blood surged like molten rock into an icy river. It began to flow according to the small cycles within his flesh, skin, and membrane, continuously nourishing his physique.

The Pure Yang Internal Energy, like molten gold liquid, seeped into his muscles. Xu Yunfan could clearly feel every muscle fiber greedily sucking in the heat.

As his mouth and nose inhaled the Purple Qi from the East mixed with a few wisps of Primordial Spirit Qi, it descended and merged with the Pure Yang Internal Energy.

Every muscle fiber vibrated at high frequency, grinding the absorbed dawn Purple Qi into visible golden particles.

'You practiced diligently every day, rain or shine, cultivating the Pure Yang One Qi Art. Perhaps because this place's spiritual energy is particularly rich, you absorbed a bit more Primordial Spirit Qi. Your proficiency in the Pure Yang One Qi Art has increased.'

'...'

'Pure Yang One Qi Art 3/1000 (Small Success)'

"Huh?!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly realized that the Pure Yang Qi, which had been quite abundant yesterday, was now significantly thinner.

If not for the Purple Qi from the East and the Primordial Spirit Qi entering his body today and restoring quite a bit, he might not have been able to recover it.

After half an hour, he finished his practice and slowly stood up, his eyes filled with deep thought.

That woman, what exactly was her purpose, and how did she entangle him?

According to his master, Zhan Yan, after the Primordial Spirit of Heaven and Earth recovered somewhat, the Decline of Law loosened. Those demons and ghosts that were previously unseen might revive.

During the period two thousand years ago when the Primordial Spirit was dissipating yet not gone, human cultivation regressed. Demons and monsters relied on hunting humans as blood sacrifices to increase their cultivation. It was truly a chaotic dance of demons, with humans as food and demons as guests.

Old foxes wore robes and called themselves Holy Lords; hungry ghosts wore crowns and sat in the main hall.

At midnight, demon drums beat on the city walls; the crying of thousands of children broke the heart.

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate. He immediately sprinted back to Heavenly Work City to ask his master, Zhan Yan, about the matter of projection into dreams.

Returning to Heavenly Work City, he skillfully went down to the Underground Fire Cave. When he kicked open the door of the Casting Hall, Zhan Yan was dipping a赤红 (crimson) sword blank into Weak Water.

In the white mist of quenching, the old master Zhan Yan's muscles were knotted and robust. Every movement revealed a blood energy like a furnace, so dense it was even comparable to the magma fire below.

"Master!"

The sword blank suddenly exploded. Zhan Yan's body stiffened. He threw a fire tongs backward; the sound of it tearing through the air brushed past Xu Yunfan's ear and钉 (nailed) into the door frame.

This instantly froze Xu Yunfan's rushing steps, his expression slightly awkward.

"You little brat!"

Zhan Yan pulled over a towel to wipe his face, his knuckles tapping on a sundial instrument developed by the Mechanism Hall on the forging platform. "I cast weapons at the third quarter of the Chen hour (7:45 AM) and quench at the end of the You hour (7:00 PM), yet you dare kick the door at the Yin hour (3:00 AM)?"
