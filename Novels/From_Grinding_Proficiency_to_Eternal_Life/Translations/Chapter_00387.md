# Chapter 387: Swallowing the Mystic Crystal

Where the palm edge passed, the air cracked with explosive whistles. The earth脉 qi within a hundred-zhang radius was forcibly drawn away, transforming into a visible, murky yellow torrent that coiled around his palm.

“This… is the true Martial Dao!”

His voice was like thunder, each word causing the surrounding sand and pebbles to vibrate. “Every move and stance draws upon the power of heaven and earth, turning infinite killing intent into fists and palms. Compared to those side paths of chanting spells and forming seals…”

The palm wind suddenly tore apart three ancient trees ahead. “It is thousands of times faster!”

The spiritual qi of the entire secret realm suddenly boiled. Behind the old man, a phantom ten zhang tall materialized. Upon closer inspection, it was a magnified version of the Divine Martial True Lord.

The phantom moved in perfect sync with its main body, launching a palm strike. Before the wind even arrived, the pressure caused Xu Yunfan’s entire skeleton to crackle.

“Dharma Form?”

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. He had studied the path of Dharma Forms within the Profound Heaven Treasure Catalogue and could naturally manifest the Six-Armed Diamond. However, facing this Divine Martial True Lord, Xu Yunfan did not retreat but instead advanced. The golden light radiating from his body grew blindingly intense.

The Ten Extremes True Qi surged through his body like a great river, eventually pouring entirely into the Mountain Shaking Ocean Calming Hammer. The body of this seventh-grade divine weapon could not withstand such immense power; its surface began to crack, yet this only caused it to emit an even more dazzling brilliance.

“Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall · Nine Extremes Return to One!”

Nine crimson golden dragon patterns detached from the hammer body and merged in the air to form a lifelike five-clawed golden dragon. The dragon’s roar echoed through the nine heavens as it charged forward with unstoppable momentum toward the sky-covering palm print.

“Boom!!!”

The shockwaves of the collision directly shattered the foundation of the secret realm. The sky fractured like a mirror, and the earth split into bottomless chasms.

In this apocalyptic scene, two figures yet crossed blades at an even faster speed. The Divine Martial True Lord formed a sword with his fingers; every sword qi caused lightning to crackle. Xu Yunfan swung his hammer like a dragon; every strike made the void tremble.

By the five-hundredth exchange, the secret realm was on the verge of collapse. By the eight-hundredth, spatial rifts began to appear at the site of their clashes. By the one-thousand-two-hundredth, the entire secret realm finally could not endure it and exploded into a sky full of light with a bang.

Amidst the piercing white light, the two figures pierced through the world barrier and reappeared under the sky of the Divine Martial World.

Xu Yunfan stood on empty air, realizing that below him was the familiar Clear Micro Mountains.

The remnant soul of the Divine Martial True Lord was now as solid as a real person, surrounded by 360 spiritual qi vortices. Each vortice connected to the laws of heaven and earth, continuously pouring into Chen Jiuchuan’s body.

“To have cultivated to such a realm in the Era of Lost Law…”

The old man finally put aside his contempt, speaking with solemnity and greed. “Boy, your body is indeed qualified to inherit my lineage.”

The wind howled, and the sea of clouds churned.

Xu Yunfan said indifferently, “It seems the True Lord has his eyes on it.”

He lowered his eyelids, understanding that if this dragged on, once the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect followed the scent and arrived, he would be the one at a disadvantage.

With a turn of his mind, Xu Yunfan flipped his palm. True Qi surged, and the Martial Dao Mystic Crystal suddenly floated into the air.

It was the color of congealed blood and jade, with dark golden patterns twisting and coiling within the crystal walls, resembling an ancient dragon slowly awakening from imprisonment. What was even more startling was the immense vitality contained within it. Every pulse of the crystal core caused the grass and trees within a ten-zhang radius to grow wildly. Withered branches sprouted new buds, old vines bloomed with flowers, and even the moss in the cracks of rocks instantly spread into a green velvet carpet.

The air was filled with a sweet, dew-like clarity. Just the scattered energy was enough to make the dragon scale armor on Xu Yunfan’s arm, which had been damaged by the collisions, visibly heal.

The moment the Mystic Crystal appeared, an invisible aura rippled out. The surrounding air suddenly stagnated, and even the howling wind paused for a moment.

*Hum!*

A visible ripple burst from the Mystic Crystal, sweeping over a thousand miles of mountains and rivers in an instant.

The remaining disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect in the Divine Martial World all trembled. Whether it was the scar-faced man hiding deep within the earth veins or the others fleeing in disarray, they all looked up abruptly, their eyes flashing with terrifying light.

“Mystic Crystal of the Martial Dao?! It is indeed here!” A tall, thin disciple squeezed out a hoarse cry of joy. “The rumors are true! A treasure that can forge the foundation of the Divine Martial!”

Three hundred miles away, the scar-faced man crushed the communication talisman in his hand, his face ferocious. “This beast dares… This is my opportunity!”

He tore off the talisman robe that concealed his aura, and a bloody aura shot up into the sky. “Fellow sect members! If not now, when?!”

Almost at the same moment, the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect scattered everywhere all sprang into action. Some unleashed their trump card escape talismans, burning their life essence不惜; some crushed life-saving pills, blood flowing from their seven orifices but their speed skyrocketing; others laughed grimly as they pushed their companions into traps, all to take that first step.

The Mystic Crystal of the Martial Dao meant the chance to defy fate and change one’s destiny. Once one achieved the Foundation Establishment realm, one would be free from the threat of imminent death and gain the true qualification to seek immortality!

“This Mystic Crystal of the Martial Dao should be the item the True Lord used to establish his foundation,” Xu Yunfan said, tapping the crystal with his fingertips, causing the dark golden patterns to flicker. “It should also be the thing that allowed you to defy fate, right?”

The Divine Martial True Lord’s pupils constricted, then he sneered and laughed. “When this Lord refined this item, I emptied three spiritual veins and slaughtered the nine great noble clans to gather the necessary resources. For an ant like you in the Divine Martial World…”

His words cut off abruptly, his eyes bursting with rage as he watched. Once the Mystic Crystal entered the stomach, unless Xu Yunfan died, he wouldn't be able to get it!

Xu Yunfan had actually thrown the crystal into his mouth!

“What happens if I swallow it?” His Adam's apple moved. The moment the crystal entered his stomach, the Ten Extremes True Qi within him melted away like snow hitting boiling oil. The crystal turned into a greedy black hole, not only frantically devouring the True Qi but also beginning to suck the vitality from his blood and flesh. Xu Yunfan’s right arm visibly withered, and his skin浮现ed cracks like a spider web.

He felt a shock in his heart. Was he being a bit too reckless?

But he quickly calmed down. It seemed… he could still bear it?

“Seeking death!” The Divine Martial True Lord’s hair and beard stood on end. “The spiritual qi in this world is thin. If the crystal cannot be replenished, it will drain the host dry!”

He laughed in anger. “I will watch with my own eyes as you turn into dried bones!”

Xu Yunfan, however, suddenly looked enlightened. “So that’s how it is…”

He suddenly reached out and pressed his hand against the steel mechanism box at his waist. “Thank you for the reminder, True Lord.”

*Screech!*

The moment the box sprang open, a piercing shriek tore through the sky.

A palm-sized jade carving of a ginseng child was pulled out by its top leaf. Its pink limbs flailed desperately, and red ginseng seeds fell from its head like dust.

“What?! This… how is this possible?!” The Divine Martial True Lord’s pupils contracted violently, the muscles on his face twitching uncontrollably. “In a mere realm of the boundary heavens, how could such a spiritual object that steals the creation of heaven and earth be born?!”

His voice trembled. Even in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, this thousand-year-old ginseng king that had already taken human form was enough to cause storms of blood and wind. Its roots could regenerate severed limbs, its liquid could extend life by three hundred years, and not to mention the red jade ginseng seed condensed at the top of the child's head—that was a treasure capable of helping a Golden Core True Lord break through a bottleneck!
