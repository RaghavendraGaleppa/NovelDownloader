# Chapter 81: The Grades of Divine Abilities  

After three years of study, Han Yue's understanding of divine abilities had reached an entirely new level.  

He had spent a great deal of time studying *The Ancestral Secret Treatise on the Classification and Examination of Divine Abilities*, a precious manual compiled by the venerable [Ancestral Transmission]. This tome, a synthesis of multiple secret texts from the Divine Thunder Palace, served as the best tool for disciples to quickly establish a foundational knowledge system regarding divine abilities.  

In the treatise, the venerable [Ancestral Transmission] stated:  

*"Divine abilities are profound techniques born from the harmony between a cultivator's mana, will, and the Great Dao. Due to the differences in a cultivator's achievements, the derived divine abilities are as countless as the sands of the Ganges."*  

The *Treatise* listed over a thousand different divine abilities, broadening Han Yue's horizons immensely. Yet, it also noted that beyond these, countless other divine techniques existed. Moreover, the same divine ability, when wielded by different individuals, could exhibit varying power and effects.  

Based on the widely accepted grading system for divine abilities in the *Jade Sky Realm*, the venerable [Ancestral Transmission] classified them into three tiers:  

The lowest tier was known as **Minor Divine Abilities**. These included techniques like *Minor Thunderclap Art* and *Breath Concealment Technique*, which could not be enhanced through cultivation or refinement. Even abilities like *Primordial Great Hand Seal*, though capable of gradual development but lacking significant power and the formation of a divine rune, were temporarily classified as minor divine abilities.  

The second tier was called **Peerless Divine Abilities**. Any ability that could condense an independent divine rune within a cultivator's body fell into this category. This included both innate peerless abilities and minor divine abilities that evolved into peerless ones through cultivation. Peerless divine abilities could be refined to greatly amplify their power, and the divine runes they formed served as a crucial foundation for advancing to the third rank.  

The highest tier was the **Great Dao Divine Abilities**, also known as **Supreme Divine Techniques**. Any peerless divine ability, when cultivated to a level surpassing the fourth rank, could be classified as such.  

According to the standards recorded in the *Treatise*, Han Yue possessed four core divine abilities, all of which had formed divine runes—making them peerless divine abilities. These four abilities would provide immense support for his future advancement to the third rank.  

Moreover, Han Yue was certain that *Heavenly Origin Treasure Lotus*, *Thoughtless Slash*, and *Golden Light Flight Technique* would, as his strength grew, eventually unleash the power of supreme divine techniques.  

Among his four innate divine abilities, three were supreme divine techniques—his greatest secret aside from the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Laws*.  

For cultivators in this realm, peerless divine abilities were the cornerstone of their cultivation. Each peerless divine ability could grow stronger with continuous refinement, working in tandem with their Dao-implement to form a combat system. A fully developed peerless divine ability could even surpass opponents wielding multiple peerless abilities.  

Take, for example, Tu Sheng of the *Blunt Sword* sect, whom Han Yue had once encountered. Relying solely on his *Borrowing Momentum* ability—originally a minor divine ability that he refined into a peerless one—and his *Abyssal Sword*, Tu Sheng was nearly unmatched among peers. Such cases were not uncommon in cultivation history.  

The *Treatise* also categorized divine abilities into four major types based on their effects and power: **Slaughter**, **Refinement**, **Flight**, and **Protection**.  

Slaughter, Flight, and Protection techniques were self-explanatory, representing abilities focused on offense, movement, and defense, respectively. All other abilities fell under Refinement techniques.  

Han Yue's divine abilities, aside from one Slaughter technique (*Thoughtless Slash*) and one Flight technique (*Golden Light Flight Technique*), were all Refinement techniques—a stark contrast to most Divine Thunder Palace disciples.  

From his daily interactions with fellow disciples, Han Yue noticed their strong preference for Slaughter techniques. Discussions about divine ability combat were always the most heated.  

For Han Yue, however, the combination of *Thoughtless Slash* and *Demon-Slaying Sword* was already lethally effective. Rather than pursuing more Slaughter techniques, he preferred to focus on refining his existing abilities to achieve greater power.  

The *Treatise* also provided extensive guidance for Divine Thunder Palace disciples on selecting divine abilities and constructing their personal systems.  

Aside from innate divine abilities gained upon advancement, disciples could also learn and refine divine techniques through the palace's secret methods—another crucial aspect of building their systems.  

The *Treatise* listed all of the Divine Thunder Palace's secret divine techniques for disciples to study and choose from in advance.  

Among them were 108 minor divine abilities, including *Minor Thunderclap Art* and *Breath Concealment Technique*, which Han Yue had already mastered.  

There were also 36 peerless divine abilities, such as *Entangling Thunder Robe* and *Primordial Divine Thunder Single Qi Great Hand Seal*, along with many other profound techniques that dazzled the mind. These 36 abilities covered all four categories—Slaughter, Refinement, Flight, and Protection—ensuring even the most discerning disciples could build a comprehensive system.  

As for the highest-tier supreme divine techniques, only seven existed in the entire Divine Thunder Palace, all requiring at least third-rank cultivation to practice. Each supreme technique was tied to a fundamental lineage, leaving little room for choice.  

Since Han Yue cultivated the *Supreme Divine Thunder Primordial Magnetism Longevity Scripture*, the only suitable supreme divine technique for him was *Primordial Magnetism Divine Light*.  

This technique, when mastered to its peak, could shatter the Five Elements, pierce the void, pull stars, and seize the sun and moon! However, Han Yue was still far from advancing to the third rank, making this a long-term goal.  

Han Yue had devoted considerable time to studying the *Treatise*. Even beyond cultivation benefits, it was an exceptionally enlightening read.  

After thorough research, he had memorized all 115 secret divine techniques of the Divine Thunder Palace. Many of them, even for someone already possessing four peerless abilities, were highly valuable, and he often contemplated them despite being unable to practice them yet.  

Take, for instance, the peerless Slaughter technique *Sword Light Division*.  

Perfectly complementing his *Thoughtless Slash* and *Supreme Thunder Demon-Slaying Sword*, this technique would not only amplify the power of his slashes but also allow him to split his sword light into multiple beams without losing potency, doubling his attack frequency.  

More importantly, with *Sword Light Division*, Han Yue could break free from reliance on a physical sword, making his combat style far more versatile.  

In battle, he could use sword light to engage enemies while reserving his *Demon-Slaying Sword*—charged with full power—for a decisive, finishing strike.
