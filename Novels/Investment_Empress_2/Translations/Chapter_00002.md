# Chapter 2: The Peerless Genius System and the Loser's Punishment

In the neighboring room, Li Mo stared blankly at the ceiling.

The good news was that his childhood friend, Ying Bing, had the potential to become a Great Emperor.

The bad news was that their relationship was far from good, and he had been acting like a fool in front of her every day.

Once they entered the Qingyuan Sect, she would surely shine brilliantly.

Li Mo couldn't help but imagine the classic scene where the protagonist's talent is tested, causing the Talent Testing Stone to explode with a bang. Then, the minor villains who had bullied the protagonist would tremble in fear as they lined up to get their faces slapped.

Just then—

\[Investment successful. Investment: One bowl of old ginseng chicken soup.\]
\[Reward calculation in progress...\]
\[Congratulations, Host. Reward: One Heavenly Spirit Replenishing Origin Pill.\]

**\[Heavenly Spirit Replenishing Origin Pill\]:** "Refined to six patterns, it is of the highest quality. It can make up for congenital deficiencies."

A opened jade box appeared out of thin air on the table.

Inside lay a translucent pill, shimmering with purple qi and containing a divine light that did not radiate outward.

Li Mo opened his mouth, his expression stiffening slightly, and his breath hitched for a few seconds.

He had heard of this thing.

He was a premature birth. His mother had been frightened while pregnant, giving birth prematurely before the full ten months. This led to him being frail and sickly since childhood, learning to walk a year later than other children. He had been the subject of gossip within the Li Mansion and among the neighbors, who all said the Li family had a tiger of a father but a dog of a son.

His father hadn't said anything on the surface, but he was anxious inside and tried every possible method to help him. This included searching for this so-called Replenishing Origin Pill.

Unfortunately, this item was priceless even when available. It would take half of the Li family's fortune just to buy a two-pattern pill, and even that wasn't guaranteed. Many deep-rooted, powerful families coveted this pill and were willing to pay a premium to cultivate their younger generations. After all, before practicing martial arts, no one minds having a stronger congenital foundation.

Thus, Li Mo had never been able to obtain it.

He never expected to get it in such a way. And it was a six-pattern one!

Even if Li Mo was ignorant, he knew how precious this was. The value of a pill multiplied several times with each additional pattern, growing exponentially, and such pills were also much rarer to come by. A six-pattern pill—he had never even heard of one before. Its preciousness was unimaginable.

"Ahem~"

"It doesn't seem to have much taste."

Li Smacked his lips.

No matter how precious something is, it only becomes yours once you eat it. The pill melted instantly in his mouth and flowed down his throat into his stomach without him tasting anything.

The next moment, he felt a warm current emerge out of nowhere in his limbs and bones, turning into swimming fish that roamed along his bones, meridians, and internal organs.

It was like a long drought receiving sweet rain, or a withered tree returning to spring.

"Phew."

Li Mo let out a long breath and opened his eyes again, his gaze sharp and bright. His body felt as if a thousand-pound burden had been lifted. The world before him seemed to have a veil lifted from it. Between breaths, the air seemed to carry a fragrance, and he felt an inexhaustible surge of energy within him.

To put it somewhat imprecisely, Li Mo felt like an elderly man who had instantly become decades younger. If he were to practice martial arts now, even if he couldn't be called a piece of uncut jade, he would at least be a stone without any flaws.

"Six-pattern pills truly live up to their reputation."

"And this was all from just one bowl of chicken soup."

Li Mo secretly marveled. The return on this investment was simply too exaggerated. Of course, the biggest reason was probably the investment target herself.

Ying Bing.

In his memory, Ying Bing was just like her name. Her personality could basically be summarized in three words: "Ice Cube."

Mending their relationship would certainly be a long and arduous task, but he still needed to刷 (刷 is a gaming term meaning to farm/grind) those rewards. She was a Red Fate, a Heaven-defying opportunity. If he missed this chance, he might never encounter another one in eight lifetimes.

"Steward Xu!"

"What are your orders, Young Master?"

The steward hurriedly entered.

Li Mo lowered his voice and asked, "Does Ying Bing have any favorite foods?"

The steward was taken aback and thought for a moment. "Probably not. Miss Ying usually has no particular desire for delicacies."

"Does she have any other things she likes?"

"This... I really don't know."

The steward put on a bitter face. *What is the Young Master scheming today?* In the past, he would always order the servants to deliberately make things difficult for Miss Ying. How could he have cared about her preferences?

"It's fine. Sorry to trouble you."

Li Mo felt a bit embarrassed upon recalling his past actions.

The steward was about to leave but suddenly remembered something as he reached the door. "By the way, Young Master, the Master instructed that once we reach the city at the foot of the Qingyuan Sect, we should take Miss Ying to see a doctor. He also gave 200 taels of silver for the consultation fee. What do you think..."

"Go. If the money isn't enough, take it from my private funds."

Li Mo waved his hand readily. If he could get rewards just by spending money, then it couldn't be more cost-effective.

"We have to leave early tomorrow morning, so get some rest early."

"Yes..."

The steward scratched his head and nodded in agreement. *What's going on with the Young Master?* He seemed to have changed his temper recently, not only being polite to him but also his attitude toward Miss Ying turning for the better. *Maybe he's grown up after seeing the world outside?*

***

The next morning.

The first rays of morning light shone down, and the frost that had condensed in the room glittered. A girl was hugging her knees and curling up on the bed, like an elf sleeping in the ice and snow.

Ying Bing was dreaming.

She dreamed of her life in her previous incarnation.

She had entered the Qingyuan Mountain. At first, she was diagnosed with a "Terrible Meridian" and couldn't practice. It was only half a year later that she obtained a fortuitous encounter and was able to open her meridians.

Then, she revealed her monstrous talent, leaving her peers far behind. By the age of eighteen, the Sect Master of the Qingyuan Sect was no longer her match. She had walked out of the Eastern Wasteland Region and witnessed a vaster world.

The Nine Heavens and Ten Lands were too vast. Hidden sects with their legacies, prodigies from ancient lands, geniuses from dynasties, and even old monsters who had reincarnated to cultivate anew—heroes emerged like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. It was a brilliant era.

Yet, she remained the most dazzling existence in the grand tide of fate!

First on the Hidden Dragon List, first on the Human List, first on the Profound List, first on the Earth List, first on the Heaven List...

She eventually stood among the Nine Heavens, on equal footing with the Martial Emperor of the Yu Dynasty in the Central State, and was known as the Heavenly Phoenix.

The Nine Heavens.

It meant the nine strongest individuals among the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Of course, above the Nine Heavens, there was still a legendary supreme realm.

Ying Bing opened her eyes slowly.

Everything was reminding her that she had truly returned to the past. And she had encountered something that never appeared in her previous life.

"Is it still there?"

Before her was a strange text. This text was visible only to her. It seemed that as long as she didn't make a choice, these words would exist eternally.

*System...*

Neither in her past nor present life had she ever seen such a thing.

"The Nine Heavens and Ten Lands are incredibly vast. I am far from omniscient. This might be a power I have never come into contact with before?"

Ying Bing lowered her eyes for a moment, then her mind moved.

\[Ding, binding successful.\]
\[Host: Ying Bing.\]
\[This system is the Peerless Genius System, dedicated to helping the host achieve the path to invincibility.\]

Ying Bing's expression remained calm, showing little reaction.

The path to invincibility?

She had already walked it once. Her path to rise was itself a path of invincibility. Among the brilliant heroes like the stars, none could be more dazzling than her. In her previous life, even the Yu Emperor had to rely on special means to be on par with her. In her prime, perhaps one could only find a worthy opponent by flipping through the pages of history.

In this life, she would only be stronger!

\[The通关 (clearance) reward will grant the opportunity to become an immortal.\]

At this moment, the system displayed another message.

Ying Bing's breath hitched for an instant.

*Immortal!*

This was a term that existed only in legends. It was said that in every era, a unique "Immortal" would emerge from the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. They stood above all living beings, truly transcendent, truly eternal.

However, since the Yu Dynasty established its rule, becoming an immortal had become a legend, as if this path had been completely severed, adding to its mystery. This was also the greatest secret that the历代 (past generations) of the Nine Heavens sought and competed for.

There was no path to immortality. Confident and proud, she had ultimately chosen the most difficult path, a rare path that only a handful of people in history had ever succeeded in.

But in the end, she was still one step short...

This so-called system actually contained the opportunity to become an immortal?

Ying Bing calmed her emotions and asked, "What does 'Challenge' mean?"

\[This system will encompass all geniuses of the same generation within a certain region and rank them, once a month.\]
\[After the ranking is announced, rewards will be distributed based on the host's rank.\]
\[Current ranking scope: Eastern Wasteland Region.\]

A great deal of information instantly appeared in Ying Bing's mind. It wasn't just the rules of the system, but also various restrictions. For example, she was not allowed to use any outside factors to interfere with the challenge. She was not allowed to reveal the existence of the system to make the opponent deliberately yield. Things like that basically blocked all paths to taking shortcuts.

However...

*Genius ranking?*

In her previous life, she was already the synonymous for geniuses and prodigies in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. And now, she also possesses the memories of her past life. Walking the path of martial arts again, she will only be stronger than before! If what the system says is true, it would undoubtedly greatly shorten the time for her to return to her peak, and even allow her to step into that unknowable realm. Even if it's an exaggeration, she has nothing to lose.

*The Loser's Punishment?*

In her past and present life, she had never experienced the feeling of being suppressed by someone else. The Central State had always been known for its outstanding talents and spiritual land. However, after she went there, the younger generation was cast into a shadow, almost shuddering at the mention of "Bing." There were even old monsters who, to crush her arrogance, disguised themselves and suppressed their cultivation level to pose as rising stars to challenge her. And then they were forced to reveal their true forms. The result was still a loss.

\[Prompt: Do you wish to enable the punishment mechanism?\]
\[If enabled, the rewards will be more substantial, but you will need to complete the "Loser's Punishment" for the number one ranked individual after the ranking is announced.\]

"I wish for nothing more."

Ying Bing's choice was without a doubt. She would definitely be the number one. This punishment, for her, was equivalent to non-existent. This wasn't arrogance. For something she had already accomplished, why not maximize the rewards?

\[The "Loser's Punishment" has been successfully enabled!\]

Ying Bing pushed the door and went out.

"Good morning."

Coincidentally, the young man in the neighboring room also opened his door at that moment.

Their eyes met. Li Mo grinned, revealing a warm and sunny smile. Compared to yesterday, the gloom on his face seemed to have vanished, adding a touch of elegance and brilliance. Overnight, he seemed to have become a sunny boy. He seemed to have changed a bit from the distant memory she had of him.
