# Chapter 64: Leave Langya as Soon as Possible

In the tranquil courtyard of Langya Prefecture's government office.

Before Zhang Jing could reach the gate, his footsteps gradually came to a halt. This once peaceful place now carried an air of bustling activity. His gaze swept across the scene—groups of two or three cultivators continuously walked into the courtyard with smiles, only to emerge later with identical expressions of tension.

*Has something unexpected happened?*

Zhang Jing quickened his pace toward the courtyard. Just like during his last visit, the gate swung open automatically as he approached.

"Junior Brother Zhang, you've arrived. Please come in," came Senior Brother Li's characteristically youthful voice, whispering by his ear.

Zhang Jing stepped confidently through the gate and headed straight for the courtyard's center. With just one glance, he keenly noticed the chaotic fluctuations in Senior Brother Li's aura and his unusually pale complexion.

"Having heard of Senior Brother's return from the demon battlefield, I've come to pay my respects," Zhang Jing said sincerely, unable to suppress a flicker of surprise in his heart.

*Could there really be demons powerful enough to injure Senior Brother Li to this extent?*

After all, this was no ordinary Qi Refinement Tenth Layer cultivator. As deputy leader of the Luodu Team, standing at the pinnacle of outer sect disciples, Senior Brother Li lacked for no cultivation resources. His inherited techniques and magical artifacts were all of the highest quality. Even Tenth Layer demon beasts shouldn't pose much threat to him, let alone inflict such severe injuries.

*Unless... it was a demon beyond Qi Refinement?*

Opposite him, Senior Brother Li responded with a carefree expression, noticing the subtle change in Zhang Jing's eyes: "Thank you for your concern. I must look quite pathetic to have alarmed you like this." His tone suggested he was accustomed to such reactions from visitors.

"Senior Brother, are there demons beyond Qi Refinement level appearing on the battlefield now?" Zhang Jing asked directly.

Senior Brother Li's expression turned serious. Instead of answering directly, he turned his solemn gaze fully on Zhang Jing: "You've come at the perfect time, Junior Brother. I was just about to send someone to find you."

"May I ask what instructions Senior Brother has?" Zhang Jing instinctively focused his attention.

"The net is about to close," Senior Brother Li murmured softly, raising his eyes to the sky. "The inner sect seniors will descend soon, and Langya will become a battlefield for Foundation Establishment experts and even Golden Core supernatural powers. This place is no longer suitable for you all to remain. If you have no urgent business, Junior Brother, you should leave Langya and return to the sect as soon as possible."

These words sent waves crashing through Zhang Jing's mind. He had suspected that the demonic disturbances in Langya Prefecture were nearing their end, but he never imagined it would conclude like this!

A flicker of anxiety flashed through his eyes. The spiritual herbs in that medicine garden hadn't been harvested yet—this directly concerned his ability to quickly exchange for top-tier inheritance techniques!

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Jing asked calmly: "Senior Brother, may I ask how much time remains before the inner sect seniors arrive?"

"At least ten days, at most half a month," Senior Brother Li answered with certainty.

Zhang Jing exhaled softly in relief. There was still sufficient time.

Regaining his composure, he continued somewhat sheepishly: "By the way, Senior Brother, since you've just returned from the demon battlefield, do you happen to have any late-stage Qi Refinement demon cores? I can exchange them with Spirit God Liquid."

He felt slightly inappropriate asking this when his senior brother was clearly injured, but he couldn't resist the opportunity.

"Spirit God Liquid? You still have such treasures?" Senior Brother Li's eyebrows shot up, a flash of surprise crossing his eyes. However, he didn't probe further, merely pausing momentarily as if organizing his thoughts.

After several breaths, he replied with a helpless expression: "Regarding demon cores, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you, Junior Brother. Late-stage Qi Refinement demon cores are extremely rare finds. I currently don't have any in my possession. If you need them, I can keep an eye out for you. Or you could check the team's resource repository after returning to the sect."

"Thank you, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said gratefully, suppressing his disappointment.

He then ventured another question: "Senior Brother, I heard from Senior Brother Yan that you possess some exceptionally high-quality mid-grade magical artifacts. I was hoping to purchase some—would that be possible?"

"Haha, that's a simple matter," Senior Brother Li laughed heartily, waving a hand.

Instantly, over a dozen various magical artifacts materialized, floating before Zhang Jing. Upon appearing, they spontaneously drew upon the courtyard's sparse spiritual energy, emitting powerful fluctuations.

"These are all mid-grade artifacts I've collected over time, each one a rare and excellent specimen. You've come to the right person if you're seeking mid-grade artifacts," Senior Brother Li declared confidently before proceeding to introduce each piece in detail.

"This artifact is called the Upholding Dragon Umbrella, a wood-attribute artifact crafted from..."

"And this is the Mountain Pressing Seal..."

Time passed steadily.

After much deliberation and selection, Zhang Jing finally chose four mid-grade artifacts: the Azure Light Banner, Mountain Pressing Seal, Profound Gold Mace, and Nine Flame Vase. Combined with his previous Netherwater Dragon Soul Bell, all five treasures in his Five Treasure Spirit River were now offensive artifacts.

Zhang Jing's reasoning was simple—with the Five Treasure Spirit River currently capable of holding only a limited number of artifacts, it was better to concentrate all power into a sharp edge rather than divide attention to defense. His current target was that white deer attempting its breakthrough to late-stage Qi Refinement. To ensure a single lethal strike, his offensive power needed to be overwhelming!

Moreover, for defense he still had the Five Method Spirit River. The twenty-four layers of Ice Light Curses with their [Heavy Light] characteristic, when stacked together, formed a defense as solid as diamond, sufficient to protect him.

With a pained heart, Zhang Jing transferred 230 merit points to Senior Brother Li before storing away his new artifacts. He had initially considered inquiring about his mid-grade spirit paper quota as Senior Brother Yan had suggested, but decided it would be better to handle such matters after returning to the sect.

Having settled all considerations, Zhang Jing prepared to take his leave: "Senior Brother, I shall take my leave now."

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, remember to leave Langya as soon as possible," Senior Brother Li reminded earnestly.

"I understand completely. Please rest assured, Senior Brother."

Standing in place, Senior Brother Li watched Zhang Jing's retreating figure disappear into the distance, murmuring to himself: "Qi Refinement fourth layer, and seemingly not far from fifth layer... The Plague God, tsk!" His hand suddenly produced a communication talisman.

Half an hour later.

On the second floor of the talisman shop.

Zhang Jing sat cross-legged on his bed, expression solemn.

The faint sound of flowing water suddenly began echoing through the room, growing gradually louder into an unbroken stream. Accompanying this sound, the hazy silhouette of a great river materialized, encircling Zhang Jing.

*The time has come!*

Holding his breath, Zhang Jing swept a hand across his identity jade pendant. A palm-sized black bell appeared in his hand. Carefully, he lifted the Netherwater Dragon Soul Bell and slowly guided it into the Five Treasure Spirit River.
