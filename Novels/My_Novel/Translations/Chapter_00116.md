# Chapter 116: Martial Arts Manifest Anomalies, Cleansing the Womb Reveals the True

The single point of proficiency on the [先天洗胎图] (先天洗胎图) was acquired during the time in Heihe Village. When Li Xian consumed the Crab Treasure, the essence of heaven and earth rampaged through his body, and by a stroke of luck, it washed away part of the fetal turbidity.

Without a proper method or path, it was a wild way of cultivation. However, as he continued to consume nourishing foods, the essence of heaven and earth rampaged and dissipated within his body. Repeatedly doing so, he inadvertently washed away some of the fetal turbidity, though it only scratched the surface.

In front of the main courtyard, the large cauldron emitted a buzzing sound, a sign that the nourishing food was fully cooked. Li Xian ordered people to scoop out the Dragon Roar Charcoal from the bottom of the cauldron and pour cold water from all sides to rapidly cool its temperature.

Cold water splashed onto the cauldron's body and instantly evaporated into steam with a sizzling sound. It took a full hour of pouring before the temperature finally dropped.

Then, Li Xian called upon the guards to work together to lift the cauldron lid and slam it heavily onto the ground.

Li Xian leaped up onto the cauldron's ear. He saw that the nourishing soup was extremely thick, with only a shallow layer left at the bottom. The fragrant, tender meat floated within the soup. Li Xian picked up the meat with tongs, placed it on a wooden plate, and presented it to Madam Wen, saying, "Madam, the nourishing food is ready."

Madam Wen nodded. She took a small jade-handled knife from her waist and gently sliced off a thumb-sized piece of meat from the corner. "You have功劳 (merit) in the cooking. This piece of meat is a reward for you."

"The remaining pot of soup is to be divided: seven-tenths for the guards, which you shall distribute at your discretion. The remaining three-tenths are to be shared among the miscellaneous servants."

Although Madam Wen was calculating, it wasn't a flaw. When distributing resources for cultivation, she was always decisive and never hesitant.

Li Xian watched Madam Wen leave, wrapped the piece of meat, and felt immense joy in his heart. *This small piece of nourishing meat is likely equivalent to a hundred Crab Treasures. Currently, I have no door or path; I still need to rely on Madam. I may harbor ambitions in my heart, but my feet must remain grounded!*

After Madam left, the pot of thick nourishing soup was left to Li Xian to distribute. He called Bi Hao over and gave him three-tenths of the soup. "Take this three-tenths of the soup, dilute it with water, and distribute it to all the miscellaneous servants. If you dare to swallow even a little bit for yourself, I will kill you instantly!"

Having witnessed the uncle and nephew swallowing the soup alone, Li Xian naturally understood the dirty tricks involved.

"I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare!" Bi Hao knelt and kowtowed.

In reality, for miscellaneous servants like Bi Hao, drinking the "nourishing soup" had very little effect and was almost a waste. However, being nourished by the essence of heaven and earth would somewhat strengthen their physiques, making them more energetic when hauling water.

The remaining seven-tenths of the soup, Li Xian kept three-tenths for himself. The remaining four-tenths were divided into four parts of one-tenth each for the A, B, C, and D teams. They first diluted it with water, then added seven types of animal bones—such as tiger bones, deer bones, and pig bones—along with body-strengthening herbs, and boiled it into a pot of fierce, potent soup. The guards shared and consumed it.

Inside the command courtyard, Li Xian closed the gate from the inside and bolted it to avoid disturbance. Calming his mind, he placed a piece of nourishing meat and seven bowls of white soup on the stone table.

Three-tenths of the soup, enjoyed alone, was indeed quite a lot.

Li Xian drank a bowl first. With a gulp, the soup entered his mouth and vanished immediately, leaving no sensation of liquid. However, he clearly felt a cool sensation sliding into his abdomen, turning into wisps of heaven and earth essence, quickly fleeing and dispersing from various parts of his body.

[Description: How can a mortal mud womb achieve the Dao? Only through the mouth. You have eaten through the mountains and wilds, searching for nourishing treasures. With long-term accumulation, you will eventually achieve and gain.]

[Culinary has reached Minor Accomplishment. All ingested items provide 40% increased benefits, and resistance to poison increases by 10%.]

"This is the feeling!"

Li Xian's Culinary Skill took effect. The heaven and earth essence entering his belly increased out of thin air. A bowl of soup originally contained only six strands, but after the enhancement, it turned into eight strands. A small bowl contained more essence than a whole pot of Crab Treasures.

This time, Li Xian did not restrain himself. He allowed the essence to disperse freely, feeling the coolness flowing through his flesh, muscles, bones, and meridians.

After the essence completely dissipated, Li Xian took a deep breath and sat cross-legged to regulate his breathing.

Then, he removed his clothes and armor, feeling light and unburdened. With palms facing the sky, he pushed outward, feet planted in a horse stance, waist twisted to one side, and head hanging toward the ground.

In this strange posture, he drank another bowl of nourishing soup. Following the key points of the [先天洗胎图], he used his intent and Qi to guide the flow of the heaven and earth essence. Using specific body postures, he opened various vital points...

Most of the essence drifted along the path and eventually emerged from his palms, faintly bringing out extremely fine strands of Five Turbidities (五浊胎气). A small portion drifted about freely, which he ignored.

Li Xian's sensation grew increasingly intense. The term "Mud Womb" spoken of by the world was not nonsense; it was a very fitting description. After practicing the [Womb Cleansing Diagram], he truly felt like a "mud man." Thick layers of "mud filth" adhered to his meridians, bones, and acupoints, covering the pearl in dust. No wonder it is called a "Mud Womb."

"So this is true Womb Cleansing. Back in Heihe Village, I consumed nourishing treasures, using human strength to fight against the heavens, trying to lock the essence inside my body. Although it was a form of cleansing, I missed the essence. Even if I ate nourishing food for a lifetime, it would be difficult to cleanse thoroughly."

"Because the essence of heaven and earth disperses without规律 (regularity). Sometimes east, sometimes west. It is like the dust in the courtyard being swept by four or five mischievous children. They sweep east and then west. Sometimes the mud you sweep out, I sweep back, making the courtyard a mess. When the master returns, to avoid punishment, the children simply sweep the dirt under the bed or into cracks. The filth hasn't decreased; it's just harder to detect!"

Li Xian drank several bowls of nourishing soup, his understanding becoming clearer. Until this moment, he had finally grasped a fraction of the method!

The Womb Cleansing Diagram共有 (has a total of) nine illustrations, each depicting a specific posture and flow path.

At this moment, it was the "Pushing to Heaven" stance, primarily used to cleanse the fetal turbidity of the arms, hence also known as the "Hand Washing" stance.

He drank all seven bowls of soup.

[Proficiency: 5/81]

Li Xian made significant progress. Under the sunlight, his arms looked like fine jade, appearing even whiter.

"It's time to eat the nourishing meat!"

The moment the meat entered his stomach, more than thirty strands of heaven and earth essence surged out. Through the enhancement of the Culinary Skill, they turned into over forty strands, rushing straight toward his hands.

An indescribable sense of pleasure welled up in his heart.

Shedding the mud to reveal the truth, seeing the light of day, parting the clouds and mist, breaking the shackles—the feeling was truly hard to describe.

Several visible strands of black gas drifted out from his palms.

[Proficiency: 10/81]

The nourishing food was gone, but Li Xian was still unsatisfied. His heart was filled with joy. He wiped his lips, clenched and released his hands, sensing the subtle changes.

"This method of Womb Cleansing is indeed very different from before. I can truly feel my flesh being washed and cleansed. I wonder... does this have any amplification effect on my martial arts?"

Li Xian immediately executed the "Green Silk Palm." He struck out several palms, finding that his movements were faster and more natural. His enthusiasm surged, and he condensed his Qi to strike even faster.

Suddenly, in an instant, a layer of green film appeared on his palm, and his palm force reached a higher level. When he executed the "Overturning Rivers and Seas" move, the internal Qi surged from his palm, actually creating a scene of green river waves crashing.

Although it was illusory, it was clearly different.

Martial arts had actually manifested an anomaly...

"I previously exerted my full strength with the Green Silk Palm. Although I had the momentum of overturning rivers and seas, the sweeping palm force, and surging internal Qi that could strike from a distance, I never had such a strange scene. I have only cleansed my womb once, why is the improvement so great?"

Li Xian was amazed. He pondered for a long time. However, knowledge of the martial path does not grow out of thin air. Without guidance, thinking alone is just a self-inflicted nuisance.

He decided to stop thinking about it and focus on practicing martial arts. When the time was right in the future, he would ask Madam for clarification.

"Commander Li!"

Night.

Inside the Yi He Manor.

The guards on patrol saw Li Xian and bowed in unison.

"En," Li Xian nodded. "Is there anything unusual during today's patrol?"

"Not for now," the leader of the B-rank guards stepped forward and replied.

Li Xian said sternly, "Heighten your vigilance. Qingning County has been unstable recently. Notify everyone, both inside and outside the manor, to keep their eyes wide open."

"Yes!" the guards replied in unison.

As the commander, Li Xian's duty was to protect the manor. Every once in a while, he would personally take charge and observe the situation in the manor.

Li Xian remembered the matter of Pang Long's severe injury. In the past, with Pang Long's strength, no one in Qingning County could hurt him. Now that Li Xian had become commander, he should pay attention in advance.

"You, stay," Li Xian called out to a guard at random.

"Commander Li, is there something else?" The guard nodded and bowed.

Li Xian asked, "What was the reason the former Commander Pang was injured?"

The guard said, "Oh, that matter. You were in Heihe Village at the time and didn't know. Let me tell you, you should be careful."

"A sect called the 'Leopard Blade Sect' has come to Qingning County recently. They are extremely powerful. I heard the sect leader is no ordinary character."

"They act tyrannically and dominate the county. They smashed up several of the Madam's shops. Qiu Yue reported to the Madam, and the Madam ordered Pang Long to handle the matter personally."

"He went, and things got very bad. The Leopard Blade Sect leader, Leopard Blade 'Xu Liefeng', said at the time: 'Where are you from, you wild cultivator? How dare you come to my door? First, take three of my disciple's blades, then we'll talk.' As soon as he finished speaking, one of his disciples drew a blade and slashed."

"I was there too. Man, that guy's blade was really fast. He severed Commander Pang's wrist with one strike. Commander Pang kicked back, and the guy met it with a kick, directly shattering Commander Pang's leg bones!"

"Commander Pang couldn't match him and was severely injured, bedridden."

The guard shrugged. In his tone, there was a hint of schadenfreude, but realizing that Li Xian was on good terms with Pang Long, he immediately put on a sorrowful expression.

Li Xian pondered, "So that's how it is. Did the Madam take any action after this?"

The guard said fearfully, "I wouldn't dare inquire about the Madam's affairs. But... I did hear some things."

"Speak freely, I won't blame you," Li Xian said.

The guard sighed in relief. "I don't know where the rumor came from, but it seems the Madam also punished Commander Pang, saying he handled the situation poorly."

"As for the Leopard Blade Sect... they are still operating as usual. In the county, they are incredibly arrogant. When our Yi He Manor people go to the county to have fun, we have to avoid them."

Li Xian thought to himself: *This matter is very suspicious. The Madam is so calculating. Having her shops smashed is a small matter, and Commander Pang's severe injury is also a small matter. But why didn't she demand compensation?*

*Forget it, this matter is in the past. Thinking about it is useless.*

He pushed aside distracting thoughts and said, "I see. Alright, you may continue your patrol."

"Yes, Commander Li!" The guard respectfully took his leave.
