# Chapter 22: Testing the Medicine  

At the hour of Si the next day—around nine to eleven in the morning—Jiang Li arrived punctually at the Alchemy Hall.  

For some reason, the temperature here seemed slightly higher than in other areas. Looking at the Alchemy Hall's premises, thick smoke billowed ceaselessly from the towering chimneys on the rooftops. Jiang Li couldn't help but wonder if, millennia later, the cultivation world might also suffer from "industrial" pollution.  

"Senior Brother, I've accepted the task for the Experimental Pill Division."  

When Jiang Li arrived, several other outer sect disciples who had also taken on the role of test subjects were already waiting. Unlike Jiang Li's eager anticipation, the others wore expressions of unease. While the pay for pill testers was high, a single stroke of bad luck could leave one bedridden for months.  

He approached a reception disciple and stated his purpose.  

"Mm, hand over your identity token."  

The disciple took the token and cross-referenced it with the list of test subjects.  

"Oh? It's been a while since a Qi Refining disciple accepted this task. Elder Chifa will be delighted."  

"Haha, Junior Brother Jiang Li, right? The rewards for tasks in our Alchemy Hall are always the most generous. You should come more often."  

The inner sect senior brother was unusually enthusiastic toward Jiang Li, leaving the latter with a face full of exasperation.  

*If the pay is so good yet no one comes, shouldn't you reflect on why that is?*  

Of course, he couldn't voice that aloud. He simply smiled and repeatedly agreed, "Of course, of course."  

"Since everyone's here, head inside. Just follow the path to the end."  

Among the other outer sect disciples, two seemed to have prior experience. Jiang Li followed them until they reached a pill-refining chamber constructed from white stone.  

"Xiao Si! Go check if the test subjects have arrived!"  

The moment they approached, a deep male voice boomed from inside, followed by hurried footsteps.  

Shortly after, the chamber's door swung open, and a young girl bounded out like a rabbit.  

"What took you so long? The elder has been waiting impatiently! Come in, come in!"  

The girl waved them in urgently. The test subjects didn't dare explain they had arrived on time and obediently followed her inside.  

Jiang Li soon met the elder of the Experimental Pill Division. The man was burly, standing over two meters tall, with a thick beard and wild, flaming red hair.  

*No wonder he's called Elder Chifa (Red Hair). The name fits perfectly.*  

"Hmm? Only this many today? Tch! The outer sect disciples these days grow more cowardly by the day."  

Elder Chifa was clearly displeased, but as a righteous sect, the Hidden Scripture Valley couldn't simply force disciples to test pills at will.  

"Same rules as always. Each of you takes one pill from the table, eats it, and tells me how you feel afterward. Simple."  

The female disciple called Xiao Si opened a porcelain bottle on the table and poured out six pills.  

"What are you waiting for? Eat them! I've already reduced the dosage—they won't kill you."  

Seeing the test subjects hesitate, Elder Chifa impatiently urged them on. Reluctantly, Jiang Li and the other five disciples each picked up a pill.  

The pills were pitch black, emitting a scent reminiscent of burnt rock. Their size was much smaller than standard Qi-Nourishing Pills or Energy-Restoring Pills—only about a quarter of the usual size. It seemed the elder hadn't lied about reducing the dosage.  

*Appraisal Technique!*  

**[Name: Unnamed Pill]**  
**[Type: Pill]**  
**[Grade: Ungraded]**  
**[Note: An immature creation with some effects.]**  

Confirming it wasn't poison, Jiang Li placed the pill in his mouth and swallowed.  

The others, seeing his example, had no choice but to follow suit. After all, they had already accepted the task—backing out now was too late.  

"Well? Any sensations?"  

"Focus carefully. Tell me if you notice anything unusual, no matter how small."  

The girl named Xiao Si had somehow tied her hair into a ponytail with a cloth strip. Holding a notebook, she stood beside the six test subjects, observing and questioning them.  

"I... I feel a bit tired."  

"Me too. It's getting worse..."  

"My skin—it's burning and itchy! Everywhere!"  

"Ah—I can't breathe! Senior Sister Xiao Si! Help me!"  

Apart from Jiang Li, the other five test subjects began panicking as discomfort set in. Two of them, who had trained in martial arts and had better constitutions, barely remained standing. The other three, ordinary disciples, collapsed weakly to the ground.  

Their symptoms—weak limbs and labored breathing—didn't seem feigned. Xiao Si quickly took notes while retrieving emergency pills, ready to administer them if needed.  

"Tch! Did I fail again?"  

Elder Chifa sighed in disappointment as he observed the five disciples, who looked half-dead.  

Then his gaze landed on Jiang Li, who was still standing perfectly fine.  

"You... why are you unaffected?"  

Jiang Li was speechless. *Am I not allowed to be fine?*  

He wasn't entirely unaffected—just that the effects were minor.  

**[Consumed unidentified pill. Minor stamina drain effect applied.]**  
**[Constitution exceeds 4 points. Minor stamina drain effect negated!]**  

**[Consumed unidentified pill. Acute respiratory allergy effect applied.]**  
**[Constitution exceeds 4 points. Acute respiratory allergy effect reduced by 70%.]**  
**[Minor acute respiratory allergy: Respiratory mucosa swelling 5%, lung capacity reduced by 7%. Duration: 30 minutes.]**  

**[Consumed unidentified pill. Weak skin fortification effect applied.]**  
**[Weak skin fortification: Skin toughness increased by 5%. Duration: 20 minutes.]**  

Jiang Li sighed inwardly. This newly developed pill was indeed problematic—its side effects were more numerous and severe than its benefits. By any measure, it couldn't be considered a success.  

"Elder, it might be because I'm at the early Qi Refining stage and also an internal martial artist. My constitution is stronger, so the effects on me are much milder."  

His calm response made Elder Chifa's eyes light up. The elder strode over in two steps, staring at Jiang Li intently.  

"Then tell me, what *do* you feel? Describe it in detail—leave nothing out."  

He snatched the notebook from Xiao Si and began recording Jiang Li's words himself.  

"Right after swallowing it, I felt slightly tired, just like them. But the sensation was very mild and didn't last long before fading away."
