# Chapter 235: Dreaming Once More

“Senior Brother Qi?”

The moment Xu Yunfan tossed over the hardest bone from the massive serpent, Qi Huan instinctively retreated seven steps.

The bone, thrown casually by the youth, embedded itself three zhang deep into the rock face. The explosive force from the cracks sent surrounding pebbles hovering into the air.

What terrifying control was this?

Even an elder from the Heavenly Work Hall would likely be unable to catch such a light, effortless throw!

Xu Yunfan looked at Qi Huan with some surprise, sizing him up and down.

“This is a fine treasure. You don’t want it?”

“...Thank you.”

His voice was hoarse, as if scorched by thunder and fire, and the muscles beneath his green scales spasmed uncontrollably.

When Xu Yunfan turned to process the other snake head, Qi Huan looked at the youth’s back, where the violent aura of blood qi was still churning and hadn't yet settled. Suddenly, he felt a hint of pity for the true disciples of the Xuanzhen Sect who thought themselves above others.

These people probably had no idea what kind of monster they were about to face.

In the days that followed, Qi Huan became completely numb to his surroundings.

Xu Yunfan seemed entirely unconcerned about whether the true disciples of those top sects had appeared in the秘境 (Secret Realm). Instead, he proceeded methodically, following his own rhythm.

The stronger these demons, the more vital energy their flesh contained, especially this Nine-Headed Serpent demon.

Every time he roasted and consumed the flesh, he felt a warmth spreading through his entire body.

Qi Huan, watching silently from the side at Xu Yunfan’s astonishing daily intake, remained speechless.

Xu Yunfan ate nearly six hundred catties of flesh every day, then began to practice his martial arts frantically, growing more intense with every session, training without sleep or rest.

One day, inside a naturally formed cave.

Sitting cross-legged before a campfire, Xu Yunfan held a large, oil-dripping piece of snake meat and took huge bites.

With a bite and a tear, a large chunk of meat was ripped off. His teeth ground through the roasted flesh a few times before swallowing it down. His eating speed was incredibly惊人 (frightening).

“The roasting skills have improved today, but it’s missing some spice. I remember there are a few cages of wild mountain peppers at the foot of the mountain. You can pick some tomorrow and apply them to make a spicy flavor.”

Qi Huan’s eyes twitched slightly upon hearing this, but seeing Xu Yunfan looking over, he could only nod.

“I understand.”

For the past half month, since Xu Yunfan had been eating to his heart's content, the task of roasting the flesh had naturally been handed over to Qi Huan.

With his daily martial arts training, he had no time for such things.

Watching Xu Yunfan finish eating and drinking, Qi Huan finally couldn't help but ask: “Since meeting you, you haven't slept for nearly two months. Can you truly rely on meditation to ensure sleep?”

Xu Yunfan thought for a moment, glanced at the remaining snake meat, and nodded slightly: “I really do need to sleep tonight.”

Currently, the progress of the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Method had passed three-fifths, accumulating 3,018 proficiency points, while the Pure Yang One Qi Technique had reached 2,790.

The Seal Character Mantra had only accumulated 92 points.

This kind of secret method focused on spiritual cultivation was extremely slow to progress relying solely on one's own diligent practice. But it couldn't be neglected; by practicing continuously every day, it would eventually become a solid foundation.

The snake meat was almost gone. After eating it tomorrow, it would be time to set off again.

This place was truly a holy land for cultivation.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but look back at the terrain where the spiritual energy gathered.

A month had passed since the killing of the Nine-Headed Serpent. The Primordial Qi below, originally surging like mist, had become pitifully thin.

With Xu Yunfan's method of draining the pond to catch the fish, showing no regard for the recovery speed of the terrain, his cultivation speed was naturally extremely fast.

Evening, the setting sun was like blood.

Xu Yunfan stood at the edge of a Dragon Severing Cliff on a mountaintop, gazing at the distant mountain peak where the red clouds surged. Faintly, he could hear a whistling sound like something moving through the mountains.

There, a more violent prey lay sleeping.

Qi Huan, standing by the side and seeing Xu Yunfan’s line of sight, couldn't help but feel his heart skip a beat.

“That big guy lurking there... what kind of demon is it?”

Before he could think further, he heard Xu Yunfan’s soft voice.

Qi Huan pressed his thin lips together, wanting to remain silent, but under Xu Yunfan’s oppressive might, he had no choice but to speak: “When I followed my instincts this way before, that place gave me an extremely strong sense of dread, forcing me to change direction until I met you, Brother Xu.”

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly. After a moment, he spoke again: “Tell me, where do these demons come from? This Secret Realm is rich in spiritual energy. By observing the terrain, I don't see the soil that would breed such demons.”

“This... I truly don't know.”

Xu Yunfan didn't expect Qi Huan to answer. The number of demons in this Secret Realm was astonishingly high. Aside from practicing martial arts these past few days, now that the Nine-Headed Serpent's demonic aura was gradually dissipating, many demons had begun darting over to the nodes where spiritual energy gathered.

Unfortunately, not a single one could withstand a single blow from Xu Yunfan.

Moreover, the energy contained in the demonic flesh now, as the proficiency of the Thousand-Jun Mountain Shattering Hammer Method increased and his own physique improved, he couldn't even feel any enhancement from it.

That night, under Qi Huan’s relieved gaze, Xu Yunfan finally lay down to sleep, resting his head on the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. Just as Qi Huan was about to get up, a sudden, inexplicable force pushed him out of the cave.

“I don't like having others by my side when I sleep.”

Hearing Xu Yunfan’s soft voice in his ear, Qi Huan’s face stiffened slightly, but he remained silent and casually found a spot where tree branches crossed to lie down.

Once Xu Yunfan fell into a deep sleep, the Dragon Scale Armor he wore seemed to be affected by some force, vibrating slightly. The scales shifted, loosening their grip and no longer hugging Xu Yunfan’s body tightly.

Then, the Extreme Dao Remnant Skin wrapped around Xu Yunfan’s torso like a vest began to slowly writhe again. The surrounding Primordial Qi began to surge like a whale swallowing water, continuously pouring into this remnant skin.

The visible tendons on the skin became increasingly deep.

The remnant skin, which was tightly pressed against his ribs, suddenly emitted a dark, glaze-like light.

As the skin, stripped of flesh, began to devour the spiritual energy, it revealed a translucent, ice-crystal-like texture. The faintly visible meridians beneath the skin resembled a starry river, flowing with a faint phosphorescence. Now, as the Primordial Qi poured in, it rippled with a cyan-blue halo.

The skin, as warm and smooth as mutton fat, adhered to every inch of Xu Yunfan's body.

*‘You have been possessed in a dream by an unknown powerhouse.’*

When Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, the scenery before him suddenly cleared.

He was now standing at the edge of a cold pond.

The pond water reflected nine solitary peaks that stood as straight as swords. The clouds and mist at the peaks condensed into the shape of a Green Phoenix spreading its wings; the frost scattered during the wingbeats refracted fine rainbows under the sunlight.

A woman in a plain white dress stood barefoot on the shortest of the sword peaks. Her wide, trailing sleeves were filled by the mountain wind, resembling a paper kite ready to ride the wind and depart at any moment.

The bronze sword hairpin slanted in her hair was no more than three inches long.

“Defeat me, and I shall let... hmm?!”

The woman suddenly spoke. Her voice was like ice water washing over stones, yet carried the cold sharpness of metal clashing, but then she let out a very spirited sound of confusion.

As she slowly turned around, the Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace behind Xu Yunfan suddenly emitted a tremor like a dragon's roar, and the Dragon Scale Armor plates uncontrollably flared open like an enraged dragon.
