Chapter 145: All Are Cross-Dressing Bigshots

Although the hull was made of wood, it shimmered with a metallic luster. The intricate patterns on its surface were not haphazard but seemed profoundly mysterious. This material was exceptionally precious, possessing various unimaginable powers.

On the deck stood over a dozen figures, the younger generation of Tian Qin. All were full of vigor, their eyes gleaming with divine light. Several even wore armor, radiating divine brilliance and enveloped in runes, clearly indicating their extraordinary nature.

A great war was imminent, and anyone faced the danger of falling. No amount of preparation could be considered excessive.

"Clang! Clang!" The sound of armor rubbing echoed. From the long bridge of energy extending from the ancient ship, a contingent of soldiers clad in black armor advanced. Their armor was jet black, etched with various patterns, and gleamed with a metallic sheen. It was well-maintained, and one could vaguely sense the sharpness of metal.

Their weapons were all black halberds and sky-glaives, ancient heavy arms. Their rustic appearance carried a bloody aura capable of devouring heaven and earth. This sent shivers down one's spine, as these weapons had undoubtedly slain powerful foes and cut down extraordinary figures; otherwise, they wouldn't exude such ferocity!

"They contain King Gold!" Zhou Zui narrowed his eyes and whispered. Those armors and weapons were all infused with a certain 'King Gold'—a truly extravagant expenditure. This material was the king among metals, not only incredibly hard but also imbued with various special powers.

"What is this?" Zhou Tian was a little puzzled. This army was clearly comprised of battle-hardened veterans, forged through blood and fire, yet he had never seen them during his time here.

"These are Tian Qin's garrison stationed here," Zhou Xunchuan said gravely. "They usually temper themselves in secret realms, so they are rarely seen." This force was no less formidable than Tian Qin's most elite armies.

"We are just small fry; we certainly won't be the main force. They are the main force," Li Xuanyi said. He carried a long sword on his back and wore a white robe, exuding an air of refinement and elegance.

This army numbered around ten thousand. The lowest cultivation realm among them was the Three Treasures Realm, while Dharma Idol Realm cultivators were ubiquitous, and Saints were not uncommon. Their faces were also covered by armor, with only their eyes emitting two sharp beams of divine light. They successively entered the ship's cabin from its side.

Today was the day to depart for Mount Myriad Gods. Not only had Tian Qin prepared, but various war artifacts also floated above the other seven main cities, and their respective soldier formations were gathering.

Finally, Zhou Changsheng appeared, followed by several figures—Tian Qin's high-end combat power. Except for essential personnel guarding the homeland, they had almost entirely mobilized. This was their first direct confrontation with those ancient gods, and they were also very curious about the special characteristics of the divine positions within the Pantheon.

Zhou Changsheng stood in the void, clad in teal-golden armor, his aura as resplendent as the great sun. After surveying his surroundings, he stated gravely, "Depart!"

The entire ancient ship emanated divine light. Its beast-hide sails unfurled, and a thick, glazed barrier appeared, glowing with a faint golden light. The mysterious patterns on the hull also began to shift and flow. Finally, the ancient ship began to move. Zhou Tian felt no tremor whatsoever on board; only after noticing the scenery flowing past did he realize the ship had set off.

The ancient ship's speed was incredibly fast. It did not traverse space. The space in the Land of the Forsaken Gods was extremely unstable due to interference from the surrounding void storms. To avoid trouble, Zhou Changsheng had not chosen to warp space. The other major forces followed closely behind. At present, only Tian Qin possessed two Heaven King-level existences, so they naturally took the lead.

On the ancient ship, everyone closed their eyes and regulated their breathing. Even for them, their heartbeats involuntarily quickened a little at this moment. Zhou Tian pondered inwardly. In such a super-scale battlefield, individual strength was difficult to fully exert unless one possessed absolute overwhelming power. However, currently, the Nine Provinces side only had Heaven King-level existences. As for the enemy, he didn't know if they had higher-realm existences, but he guessed they probably didn't. Otherwise, their group would simply be serving themselves up as targets. The people on the Nine Provinces side shouldn't be that foolish; they must have some understanding of the enemy, especially since the war lasted a long time in ancient times.

This led to a problem: his [Cultivation Replication] skill couldn't be fully utilized at all. Its 31-second duration was only useful if he possessed overwhelming power, and his other skills were even weaker by comparison. As for [Sacred Edict], Zhou Tian still remembered that the Dao Lord in the void storm was only restricted for a brief instant by him. The effectiveness of this skill was greatly related to the target's strength. After much deliberation, Zhou Tian realized that the only skill he could effectively use in such a grand battlefield was [Cultivation Replication], and even then, he would have to seize the opportune moment.

Looking at Tian Ling beside him, Zhou Tian, still worried, exhorted, "Be careful. The battle situation isn't something one person can control. Don't push yourself to the limit; just stick with Zhou Zui and the others and try to blend in."

Tian Ling rolled her eyes at Zhou Tian and softly said, "What do you mean 'blend in'? Don't worry, I'll be very careful."

*Look, look, she's even learned to roll her eyes now. It must be from Liu Yan,* Zhou Tian grumbled furiously inwardly, though outwardly he nodded impassively.

When the Sacred Demon brought Zhou Tian from Mount Myriad Gods to the Nine Provinces outpost, it took approximately two days. However, that wasn't his speed, but the speed of the Nine-tailed Phoenix Bird. Tian Qin's ancient ship was significantly faster than the Phoenix Bird, arriving in just over a day.

On Mount Myriad Gods, the magnificent ancient metal palace was grand indeed. The towering bronze gate stood like a primordial mountain, casting an oppressive, dark shadow that felt suffocating. Currently, the bronze gate remained tightly shut, unopen.

At this moment, seven figures already stood in the void, either clad in white robes, enveloped in shadow, or wearing lightning armor. Various phenomena surrounded them; these were precisely the gods who had descended by possessing hosts.

"A little disappointed, didn't see any familiar faces," a clear female voice drifted over. Following the sound, Zhou Tian's expression turned strange. What a coincidence? The speaker was none other than the Saintess whom Mu Su had escorted, the 'kind' girl who had insisted Mu Su bring Zhou Tian along.

At this moment, she wore a white robe and was barefoot, her eyes indifferent. Although the ancient ship was protected by formations, a single glance from her sent a chill through many. It seemed she had become the host for the Holy God Lord. It was unclear whether this girl was truly an excellent fit for the Holy God Lord, or if the Holy God Sect had some peculiar preferences, allowing even their Hierarch to become a cross-dressing bigshot.

This time, Mu Su and Ling Yu had not come along, as Zhou Tian believed it was too dangerous and their strength was insufficient. Moreover, they were, after all, natives of the Land of the Forsaken Gods; his trust did not guarantee others' trust.

"Isn't the Holy God Lord a man? How did he descend into a woman's body? Are you getting used to it?" Zhou Changsheng flew out from the ancient ship, standing in the void, and mocked.

"I was born in the sacred; I am the sacred. How can the sacred be divided by gender?" The Holy God Lord explained indifferently, devoid of any expression.
