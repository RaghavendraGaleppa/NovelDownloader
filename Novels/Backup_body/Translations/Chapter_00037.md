# Chapter 37: Between Life and Death!

At the mountain gate, Lu Huaiyuan approached with a wooden box in his hands.

"These are Elder Yuan's belongings."

"According to sect regulations, when an elder passes away, their disciples must retrieve their remains and deliver them to the Public Affairs Hall for inspection before inheritance can proceed."

"Elder Yuan's remains and belongings have been returned to the mountain. The remaining matters are now in your hands."

Lu Huaiyuan extended the box forward.

Li Zhengjing solemnly accepted it with both hands and said, "Thank you, Senior Brother Lu!"

Lu Huaiyuan nodded slightly and said, "Last night, I reviewed the records of your time in the sect since your admission. You've performed exceptionally well. Elder Yuan would surely be comforted knowing this in the afterlife."

With that, he patted Li Zhengjing on the shoulder and bowed to the assembled inner sect elders.

Faced with this courtesy from the sect's chief true disciple, none of the inner sect elders dared to slight him, returning the gesture respectfully.

Lu Huaiyuan then nodded again, stepped past Li Zhengjing, and headed toward the main peak's grand hall.

Li Zhengjing, holding the wooden box, bowed toward the coffin.

"Is this the young man who entered the sect with Yuan Zhengfeng's token?"

"He's only been here half a year and has already cultivated inner qi. His aptitude and comprehension must be outstanding."

"I heard that shortly after achieving inner qi, he slew a spirit beast. Not long ago, he also went down the mountain and captured a rogue cultivator causing havoc in Wanlin County!"

"It seems his progress after attaining inner qi has been remarkable."

"No wonder even Lu Huaiyuan, who looks down on most, holds him in such high regard! This young man is indeed extraordinary and deserves cultivation."

Some inner sect elders whispered among themselves, while others remained expressionless and offered no comment.

Gao Changhe stood to one side, next to Xie Changqing.

"Elder Yuan was strict and impartial during his time in the Enforcement Hall, offending many," Xie Changqing said quietly. "Even with the two of us, only twenty-four elders have gathered today. They likely only came out of respect for their fellow sect members..."

The ceremony to welcome Yuan Zhengfeng's remains was far from grand. Everyone knew that if not for Lu Huaiyuan, the chief true disciple, personally escorting the remains, the scene would have been even more pitiful.

After Li Zhengjing took the wooden box and Lu Huaiyuan departed, the other inner sect elders also dispersed.

Those who were courteous still bowed to the coffin, but most left without a second glance.

Only the hundred or so inner sect disciples dared not leave so casually, standing in two rows and bowing in unison.

The coffin was carried to the back mountain, where Gao Changhe and Xie Changqing had already arranged everything. Thus, Li Zhengjing had no further duties beyond delivering the belongings to the Public Affairs Hall.

After inspection, the Public Affairs Hall retained three items bestowed by the sect, returning the rest to Li Zhengjing.

Additionally, Yuan Zhengfeng had left behind 1,200 merit points. According to sect rules, thirty percent was reserved for his successor, adding 360 merit points to Li Zhengjing's name.

Among the remaining belongings, there were only six items, mostly fragments. However, Li Zhengjing was relieved to find two graded spirit stones among them.

He took the two spirit stones and intended to bury the rest with Elder Yuan Zhengfeng.

At the back mountain's restricted area, Gao Changhe and Xie Changqing were waiting. The tombstone was ready, and Yuan Zhengfeng's remains had been placed in the high-quality coffin prepared by Gao Changhe.

"We were waiting for you," Gao Changhe said. "Though you're not his disciple, you entered the sect with his token, carrying on his legacy in a way. Pay your final respects... then we'll seal the coffin and bury him."

"Understood."

Li Zhengjing stepped forward and saw a skeleton within the coffin.

The bones showed no visible injuries and were relatively intact.

His expression was complicated as he bowed.

Though he had never met Yuan Zhengfeng.

In truth, he had no real connection to the elder—Yuan Zhengfeng's token had never been meant for him.

The token had been acquired by the Jian'an Marquis Manor by chance. Recognizing it as a token of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, they had kept it for years.

Yet, it was undeniable that he had used Yuan Zhengfeng's token to enter the sect.

Though Yuan Zhengfeng's legacy had indirectly made him enemies, it had also earned him the favor of Gao Changhe and Xie Changqing.

"Elder Yuan, I borrowed your token to enter the sect. In a way, I am half your disciple. It's only right that I bear the consequences of your legacy."

Li Zhengjing bowed deeply, thinking, "Today, as your disciple, I welcome you back to the sect. I repay this debt. May you rest in peace."

After finishing his bow, he took out the belongings and placed them beside Yuan Zhengfeng's skull.

He carefully arranged each fragment.

Just as he was about to rise, his entire body suddenly trembled!

In an instant, his inner qi surged toward his head, completely absorbed by the golden page.

Before his eyes, the golden page shone brilliantly, its contents now entirely altered!

**Name:** Yuan Zhengfeng.  
**Status:** None.  
**Age:** None.  
**Cultivation:** None.  
**Fortune:** None.  
**Note:** The target's cultivation far exceeds your own. Content display failed!  
Insufficient inner qi. Please supplement with three spirit stones!

"What?"

Li Zhengjing's expression changed.

He had seen content from Yuan Zhengfeng's remains?

Previously, he had deduced that focusing his mind on a person would activate the golden page, revealing their origins.

When the cultivation gap was small, his own inner qi could serve as "spiritual energy" to power the golden page.

But when the gap was vast, he needed spirit stones to compensate for the deficiency.

But how could Yuan Zhengfeng's remains trigger the golden page when he was already dead?

Moreover, with only bones remaining, his cultivation should have dissipated entirely. How could the page still claim his "cultivation far exceeds your own"?

Shocked, he focused his gaze into the two dark hollows of Yuan Zhengfeng's skull.

But as he did, the golden page reverted to displaying his own information.

Stunned, he froze.

"Not the remains?"

Li Zhengjing's expression shifted uncertainly. Suddenly realizing something, he shifted his gaze from the bones to the fragments of belongings.

He examined each one, finally settling on a broken jade disk.

Then, the golden page displayed Yuan Zhengfeng's information once more.

A chill ran down Li Zhengjing's spine, rising to the back of his head, filling him with dread.

He vaguely understood.

Yuan Zhengfeng was dead—but not entirely.

His body had perished.

His soul was hidden within this broken jade disk?

When a person dies, their soul extinguishes like a lamp. How could it remain in the world?

By all reason, even an immortal who transcended mortality couldn't abandon their body and continue existing!

Yet before leaving the mountain, Yuan Zhengfeng had only been at the upper level of the True Qi realm—not even at its peak!

What was happening?

Li Zhengjing was shaken, his expression shifting uncontrollably.
