# Chapter 81: Princess Jiang's Hobbies, Beyond Divine Arts, Karmic Red Lotus?

"Tonight's moon seems much brighter than usual?"

In the guest room, Li Mo had just made his bed. With a little thought, he probably guessed that the 'Ice Block' not letting him stay next door had something to do with her physique. He wondered if it was a monthly occurrence, like 'those days,' or just an occasional one.

"The Lunar Moon Phoenix Physique has all sorts of extraordinary qualities and phenomena."

"My immortal physique is just too low-key; now even breaking through realms is a problem."

Li Mo merely grumbled a couple of sentences. The System had never given him anything useless, especially things dropped from the 'Ice Block'. It's just that physiques... martial artists with physiques developed their understanding of them generation by generation through experience. Like Lin Jiang, who clearly knew he needed to practice spear techniques to maximize the strengths of his physique. Li Mo had no one to learn from. He could only rely on himself, exploring step by step...

As he thought this, Li Mo opened the two newly acquired peerless sword techniques and meticulously began to study them. Gradually, the night deepened. Suddenly, fluctuations came from the World Seed.

"Churong is here so early today?"

...

Inside the World Seed.

Jiang Churong hugged a tree branch, her small head bowed. She had just demonstrated her progress, her gaze subtly peeking at the opposite side. Biting her lip, she carefully asked: "Teacher... I... I didn't... disappoint you, did I?"

She didn't know that 'Lord Heavenly Venerate' almost gasped, nearly exclaiming, 'This girl is terrifying!' A single blade of grass could sever the sun, moon, and stars – he had truly only said that casually to motivate Princess Jiang a little. But Princess Jiang had genuinely been practicing along that path! When she had just unleashed her sword, it actually carried a boundless aura of 'wildfire cannot burn it all, spring breeze brings it back to life.' It was sword momentum. Without having formally learned any sword technique, she had comprehended her own 'momentum'!

"Hmm, not bad. You must have worked very hard during this time, right?"

"Not ha... hard at all." Jiang Churong's face flushed from the praise, and she waved her small hands repeatedly: "I just... just..."

"When I woke up in the morning... when I ate... when I went outside the door... when I picked up things... I practiced... practiced a bit, and then at night... at night before sleeping... I'd practice with you for a while..."

Princess Jiang's day was very simple: eating, sleeping, picking up trash, and then practicing sword arts while doing these three things.

Li Mo: "..."

"So you only practiced twenty-four hours a day, huh?" And also, "Didn't I tell the Murong family to take good care of her? Why is she still going out to pick up scraps?"

"Are you having difficulties in your daily life?"

"Before, I often went hungry, but ever since Big Brother Li came, I haven't anymore..." Jiang Churong suddenly stopped stammering, speaking softly. When she mentioned 'Big Brother Li,' her voice grew softer and softer...

"Then why do you still go out to pick up things every day?"

Hearing Lord Heavenly Venerate ask this, Jiang Churong tilted her head. "Oh right, why?" She didn't understand either. She only knew that every time she picked up discarded items from outside, like a broken kite or a chipped bottle, she would feel very satisfied, accomplished, and happy when she saw those tattered things tidied up and neatly arranged...

"A hobby... a hobby?" Jiang Churong blinked, tentatively.

Li Mo: "..."

"What a niche hobby. Alright, as long as you're happy."

"Oh right... Teacher... Big Brother Li... how has he been lately?" A timid inquiry came. Jiang Churong's gray eyes seemed even brighter than before. She thought, her Teacher was so powerful, knowing every detail of even the ancient, magnificent events. Then he must also know how Big Brother Li has been doing recently, right?

The little girl actually cares about me quite a bit. Last time, I said I'd go back to see her, but I haven't sent a message back yet. Li Mo couldn't help but smile inwardly. He cleared his throat: "Li Mo, you mean? He's doing quite well. He just won a top-three spot in the Nine Peaks Martial Arts Tournament at Qingyuan Sect, rising to fame and earning the admiration of the elites in Ziyang Prefecture. As a completely unbiased bystander, I have to say, his swordplay is pretty decent."

Jiang Churong's eyes sparkled as she listened, seemingly drifting far away, envisioning Big Brother Li's spirited appearance on the arena stage. She smiled foolishly: "Big Brother Li is so amazing."

"Yes, he should be back in the prefecture city to see you in a while."

"Really?"

"Alright, back to business. Take these two sword arts and comprehend them. I will test you next time. Practice them quietly by yourself; do not show them to others." Lord Heavenly Venerate waved his sleeve, and two sword classics appeared on the table. Jiang Churong carefully put them away, treasuring them. Then, clutching her stomach, she said with some confusion: "Teacher, I... in my stomach... lately, it feels like there's a... little mouse."

"A little mouse?" Under the mask, Li Mo's brows slightly arched. He reached out and placed his hand on her wrist. After sensing for a moment, he let out a breath, then felt a little strange: "That's not your stomach; it's your Dantian. You're about to open your meridians."

"Open my meridians?" Jiang Churong knew very little about martial arts and didn't quite understand what 'opening meridians' meant. Li Mo hadn't had the chance to explain it to her. He had planned to wait until Jiang Churong's body had mostly recovered before guiding her in condensing her Qi and blood. He hadn't expected her to stumble upon the right path by herself, even in her muddled state.

"In that case, I will give you some pills to protect your meridians."

...

The night grew thicker. The brilliant moon hung high in the sky, casting a silvery glow over the entire Qiushui Pavilion, reflecting pure white light onto the ground. The sound of the small stream flowing in the courtyard had ceased.

"Huu..." Li Mo exhaled a puff of white air and looked outside. The entire stream, he realized, had completely frozen solid at some point, glowing with a faint blue sheen in the night. The small Qiushui Pavilion was now so cold that water instantly turned to ice, colder even than the depths of winter.

"Ice Block..."

"She should be alright, right?"

As he thought this, suddenly, the System's notification sound rang in his ear:

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in Jiang Churong and helping her successfully open her meridians.】

【Investment Feedback: One Mystical Silver Heavenly Tome Seal.】

【Mystical Silver Heavenly Tome Seal: Can deduce and perfect any cultivation technique of Peerless Art grade or below, elevating its grade by one level!】

"It's finally here!" Li Mo's eyes suddenly lit up. He was just short of one Mystical Silver Heavenly Tome Seal to upgrade a Peerless Art to a Divine Art, and then he could use that Gilded Heavenly Tome Seal. This meant he would obtain a martial art *beyond* Divine Art! He also had a chance to break through to the Inner Breath realm! If Princess Jiang were in front of him, he'd definitely give her a big hug and a couple of fierce kisses!

Without hesitation, a small seal, like flowing mercury, appeared in his palm. The tadpole-like script on it seemed to come alive. He took out the "Blazing Lotus Extreme Yang Energy" and pressed the seal onto it. The characters suddenly began to flow, as if countless swimming fish were darting within them.

《True Phoenix Blood Lotus Sun-Swapping Divine Art》

A Divine Art!

Something countless people in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands dreamed of, now lay quietly on the table. A single Divine Art was enough to cause countless powerhouses to fall, influence the rise and fall of unimaginable forces, stir up momentous changes, and unleash a bloody storm.

Having reviewed the "Moon Radiance Sword Classic" and "Sun Wheel Sword Classic," Li Mo knew that while these two sword techniques were intricate, they were ultimately only low-grade Peerless Arts. No matter how sophisticated their combined attack, they could not compare to a true Divine Art. It was likely due to their ancient origins, with rumors growing more exaggerated over time.

"Divine Arts are still beyond imagination, the pinnacle of martial dao."

"Then what lies beyond that?" Li Mo couldn't help but feel his heart surge with excitement. The Gilded Heavenly Tome Seal, in his palm, slowly descended onto the paper. Golden profound script erupted at that instant, merging into it like a hundred rivers flowing into the sea. The fine blue-patterned paper gradually disintegrated, as if what was written upon it had exceeded its capacity to hold.

"Holy crap, I didn't even get a clear look..."

Despite his shock, Li Mo fixed his gaze. He saw that the characters were obscure and profound, seemingly still shifting and transforming, impossible for anyone to fully discern. This was not any script Li Mo had ever seen. In fact, it was difficult to even call them characters.

Buzz—

The paper finally completely disintegrated. But it transformed into a mystical lotus petal, which, while Li Mo wasn't paying attention, flew into his glabella.

Boom—

A grand vision flashed through his mind. It was as if heaven and earth were first opening, all things in chaos, and in an instant, countless things dissipated and were reborn, many times more exaggerated than the phenomena within the small world. A red lotus quietly grew. With a gentle stir of its petals, boundless karmic flames burned across the sky.
