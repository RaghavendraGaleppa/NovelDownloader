# Chapter 13: The Head is Yours, The Lute is Mine  

Xiao Ji used his Thunderbolt Sword to intercept three silver needles.  

Physician Xue's eyes flashed with surprise as he quickly regained composure, withdrawing his silver needle artifacts in advance and retreating over two zhang away.  

Equipment was crucial—when facing opponents of similar cultivation levels and abilities, victory often came down to superior artifacts and techniques. Xiao Ji wielded a Heaven-grade top-tier sword and practiced a Heaven-grade sword technique, making him nearly unmatched among peers of the same realm.  

Even those above his cultivation level would hesitate before such formidable artifacts.  

If they clashed head-on, though Xiao Ji might be injured, the opponent's artifact would undoubtedly be destroyed.  

Zhao Jiuzhou seized the chance to catch his breath before charging at the sinister physician from behind.  

The battle raged on without pause.  

Physician Xue, after all, was at the fifth layer of Qi Refining, one level higher than Xiao Ji and Zhao Jiuzhou. Even if his current artifacts were inferior to Xiao Ji's, he remained composed.  

Aside from relying on his cultivation advantage, he still had his Iron Pipa—his trump card—yet to be revealed.  

Earlier, he hadn't used it not because he was reluctant, but because he hadn't deemed it necessary. In his eyes, the two intruders were nothing more than lambs for slaughter—like using a kitchen knife to chop garlic when an axe wasn't needed.  

But now, the situation had changed. The Taoist's artifact was astonishingly powerful, and prolonged entanglement would only invite greater risks. It was time to bring out the Iron Pipa.  

This very artifact had caused the internal strife that wiped out the Profound Iron Sect. With it, he—a talentless Five-Spiritual Roots waste—had rapidly ascended to the fifth layer of Qi Refining. Without interference, he would have successfully formed his Foundation, then his Golden Core, racing step by step toward immortality.  

Physician Xue leaped to a nearby wall, triggering a hidden mechanism by turning a vase. A concealed compartment opened, revealing the Iron Pipa.  

He grasped the lute in his hands and sneered at the two uninvited guests.  

At this moment, he felt as though everything was already over.  

Memories of his cultivation journey flashed through his mind.  

As a child, he had once witnessed cultivators slaying demons. A dog in his village had turned into a demonic beast, and passing cultivators had displayed their divine might. From that moment, he had yearned to become a cultivator himself. He sought masters everywhere, but the results left him disheartened.  

His talent was abysmal—someone had told him his Five-Spiritual Roots doomed him to never cross the threshold of Foundation Establishment.  

After drifting aimlessly, he turned to medicine, hoping miraculous healing arts could alter his spiritual roots. Eventually, he arrived at the Profound Iron Sect, becoming a salaried bone physician.  

Since the Profound Iron Sect was a weapon-forging sect, disciples constantly wielded hammers and axes, smashing and splitting things—injuries were common, making bone physicians highly sought after.  

Watching countless unremarkable disciples steadily grow stronger, his envy festered into something vile. Once, while treating a disciple, he heard of the legendary power of the Single-Stringed Pipa. It became his beacon of hope.  

But how could a mere first-layer Qi Refining physician seize such a treasure?  

It took him half a year to devise a scheme.  

If he couldn't take it by force, he would make the strong slaughter each other. After the higher-ups killed one another, he would manipulate the mid-tier cultivators to eliminate the remaining leaders, then turn on them in turn. Layer by layer, he would whittle them down until poison became his final weapon.  

The plan succeeded.  

With this lute, he gained infinite possibilities.  

"Listen to my… less-than-skilled music," Physician Xue plucked a string.  

The sound reverberated through the underground chamber, dizzying the mind and unsettling the soul.  

In this state, even Xiao Ji couldn't find a safe spot—he could only resist the eerie pipa music with his dwindling spiritual energy.  

Physician Xue now blocked the only exit. To escape, they had to kill him.  

Xiao Ji darted around the chamber, searching for a way to break the deadlock.  

As he passed a wooden chest—  

**[This contains the matured infant spirits Physician Xue refined. Through the Single-Stringed Pipa, he discovered a cultivation method suited to him. Unable to change his own spiritual roots, he turned to external means.]**  

**[He has refined four matured infant spirits in this underground space. Each spirit elevates his cultivation by one layer—four spirits, four layers.]**  

**[If the infant spirits are destroyed, his cultivation will regress accordingly.]**  

In other words, four of Physician Xue's five Qi Refining layers were borrowed from the infant spirits. If they were destroyed, his cultivation would revert to its original state.  

Without hesitation, Xiao Ji raised his sword and cleaved through the locked wooden chest.  

The Thunderbolt Sword shattered the chest effortlessly, annihilating the infant spirit within.  

Physician Xue shuddered violently, as if struck by a heavy blow.  

"What are you doing? Do you know what you're doing?" Physician Xue roared in disbelief, his secret exposed. "He was just a child!"  

Xiao Ji smirked at him and swiftly searched for the next infant spirit. Inside a sealed vase, he found the second one and destroyed it with his sword.  

Zhao Jiuzhou remained utterly baffled throughout, unable to comprehend why Xiao Ji was smashing chests and vases.  

But when he looked at Physician Xue, the man was already on the verge of madness.  

Now, the sinister physician's cultivation had dropped to the third layer of Qi Refining—no match for Xiao Ji and Zhao Jiuzhou.  

Even so, Xiao Ji didn't let his guard down. He knew the terrifying power of the pipa. If they didn't reduce Physician Xue to the first layer soon, he would resort to a final, desperate act—playing the lute with his very life.  

"You can't destroy my path to immortality!" Physician Xue howled, no longer able to control the Iron Pipa, reduced to impotent rage. "You heartless Taoist! Do you know how hard I worked to get here? I've lost everything… You ruined it all!"  

"Though I don't understand what's happening, I can only say—he deserves this," Zhao Jiuzhou retracted his spear.  

His weapon shifted forms—from spear to sword, then to hammer.  

It was somewhat perplexing.  

"Don't you want vengeance for the Profound Iron Sect?" Xiao Ji reminded him. "You said you'd take his head to mourn the fallen."  

Zhao Jiuzhou let out an "Ah," then transformed his hammer back into a spear.  

With a horizontal sweep, Physician Xue's head tumbled to the ground mid-scream.  

"Good. Now, the head is yours, and the lute is mine," Xiao Ji said, watching Zhao Jiuzhou's thoughtful expression. "You're not thinking that since this was forged by your sect, it belongs to you, are you?"  

Silence.  

"Of course not," Zhao Jiuzhou chuckled. "This very lute brought ruin to the Profound Iron Sect. With your strength, Taoist, you're better suited to safeguard it."  

Truthfully, he had considered it, but being called out made it awkward to insist. After all, without Xiao Ji, he might never have even encountered Physician Xue—or if he had, he'd likely be dead. The physician was far too cunning.  

Now that the Taoist from Origin God Temple openly wanted the artifact, why fight over it?  

The two searched the underground chamber, gathering anything of value into a sack.  

Once above ground, they planned to round up the physician's apprentices and deliver them to the authorities of Willow Town—let them handle the aftermath.  

Just as they emerged—  

Zhao Jiuzhou suddenly clapped Xiao Ji on the shoulder.  

"Now… I'm the last of the Profound Iron Sect, aren't I?"
