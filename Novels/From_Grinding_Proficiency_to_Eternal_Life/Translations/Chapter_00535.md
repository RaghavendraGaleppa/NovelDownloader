# Chapter 535: The Dao Foundation Shatters Its Cocoon, the Cavern Heaven Emerges

It was as if a sea of lightning within him, with endless thunder flickering.

Just as he completed a full cycle of Qi, his spiritual power about to return to tranquility, and he was preparing to wait for the minor feedback from the Attribute Panel as usual...

A message suddenly popped up in his vision.

`<Your Proficiency in the Divine Celestial Nine Firmament Profound Void Immortal Scripture has increased by 1>`

`<Your Divine Celestial Nine Firmament Profound Void Immortal Scripture has reached Great Perfection>`

With the appearance of the prompts, a sudden and strange change erupted within Xu Yunfan's body.

An invisible storm, without any warning, erupted from the stable Dao Foundation deep within his Dantian.

"BOOM!!!"

The sound burst forth from within him, echoing throughout his entire soul, and a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering sound rang out from his entire body.

It was like the first thunderclap when heaven and earth were first created.

The structure of his Dao Foundation, originally as solid as bedrock, was instantly torn and compressed by the gravitational force emanating from its very depths.

It felt as if something was about to break out from the foundation.

The moment the line of text appeared on the Attribute Panel's information bar, the already violent gravitational vortex within Xu Yunfan's body was instantly ignited.

The collapse at its core intensified abruptly.

Guided by the power of the Attribute Panel, all the spiritual power within Xu Yunfan's body, cultivated through the *Divine Celestial Nine Firmament Profound Void Immortal Scripture*, regardless of which corner of his four limbs and eight meridians it roamed, was summoned by its origin at this moment. It transformed into billions of incredibly bright, silver-purple streams of light.

Like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, or ten thousand streams converging at their source, they gathered with unprecedented speed, frantically converging towards the compression core at the center of the Dantian's Qi Sea.

The speed was as fast as lightning and thunder.

The majestic and vast torrent of spiritual power impacted the core point, but it failed to shatter it. Instead, it was frantically devoured and compressed by the terrifying attraction generated by the core point.

The core point seemed to have transformed into a bottomless black hole, distorting and blurring the very concepts of time and space around it.

Compression.

Extreme compression.

The massive, surging spiritual power was undergoing a qualitative transformation under pressure that surpassed its limits.

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan's body trembled slightly. A vast, ancient, supreme, life-and-death-controlling, terrifying aura began to diffuse from him.

He didn't know how long the compression lasted. Perhaps it was only an instant, or perhaps it was a thousand or ten thousand years.

When the last wisp of silver-purple light merged into the core point, the "black hole" that had been frantically devouring everything suddenly came to a halt.

Immediately after, a thunderclap, even more grand and pure than the one before, as if echoing through all the myriad worlds, exploded within Xu Yunfan's consciousness core.

It was as if the Dao's rumble was echoing by his ears, making his entire mind buzz incessantly.

"BUZZ!!!"

In the Dantian's Qi Sea, the core point that had collapsed to its absolute limit, suddenly transformed from ultimate dead silence into the most vibrant new life.

Under the extreme collapse of spiritual power, it was no longer a black hole, but had transformed into a seed.

A seed only the size of a grain of rice, yet in Xu Yunfan's perception, it was as vast as a star.

The surface of this seed presented a profound, almost black color, as if containing the origin of the universe, like the purest obsidian.

Yet upon this black color, countless fine and intricate patterns, too complex to be described in words, flickered.

These patterns were not carved, but naturally formed, like the celestial seal script, or the brand of thunder.

Each pattern flowed and jumped incessantly, as if billions of extremely tiny silver dragons were swimming on the surface of the seed.

The violent, destructive aura and the vitality of nascent life achieved a perfect balance with every jump and flicker of these silver thunder patterns.

A sense of innate, natural artistry arose spontaneously.

The moment this seed appeared, it became the absolute core of Xu Yunfan's body and soul.

It was perfectly linked to Xu Yunfan's essence, energy, and spirit, connected by blood and breath, blending its aura with his. It was as if Xu Yunfan was the seed, and the seed was the manifestation of his Dao Fruit.

The Seed of the Divine Celestial Cavern Heaven's Prototype.

What the Attribute Panel called "Great Perfection" was marked by the birth of this seed.

This was the true mid-stage of the Foundation Establishment realm. From here on, one could nurture and grow this Cavern Heaven prototype, raise it up to reach the late stage, and even achieve complete harmony to reach the perfect Great Perfected Person realm.

Only then could one seek the Golden Core and prove the Dao.

It could be said that with the condensation of the Cavern Heaven prototype, one had the qualification to begin the matter of seeking the Golden Core and proving the Dao.

"Condensed... it's condensed!"

Xu Yunfan's heart was instantly filled with understanding, and an indescribable joy and a sense of vast control arose spontaneously.

This was the foundation of his own Dao path.

Without collecting any external Qi from the outside world, solely through bitter cultivation he had pushed the proficiency of the Divine Celestial Scripture to the 1000-point threshold. Under the guidance of the Attribute Panel's mysterious power, it had been derived and condensed from within the Dao Foundation itself.

It completely verified his previous speculation: the Attribute Panel possessed the great power to bypass the collection of external objects and directly push for the derivation of the Great Dao from the origin level of a cultivation technique.

Although it was slow, the foundation seemed purer.

Because it was pushed by proficiency, it itself contained the most origin-level Thunder Dao of the Divine Celestial Scripture, making it a truly perfect Cavern Heaven.

The seed was formed, but the prototype needed to be built.

A massive influx of knowledge, injected after the scripture's advancement, flooded his mind, giving him instant enlightenment.

In an instant, the newly born Divine Celestial Seed suddenly erupted with an invisible field.

This field was incredibly domineering, instantly filling the original Dao Foundation space within Xu Yunfan's body.

"CRACK-CRACK!"

Within the Dao Foundation space, centered on the Divine Celestial Seed, the space shattered like a mirror.

The Dantian's Qi Sea was not truly shattered; rather, its original boundaries were pushed open by a more grand and essential force.

The shattered boundaries transformed into void and chaos, resembling the primordial scene before the creation of heaven and earth.

The Divine Celestial Seed hung high in the center of this newly born "void and chaos."

The incredibly complex silver thunder patterns on its surface suddenly lit up brightly.

The light penetrated Xu Yunfan's flesh and blood, passed through the layers of restrictions of the cave dwelling, and faintly formed a silver-purple thundercloud vortex shadow that covered an area of several miles in the sky above the peak of the Divine Celestial Peak.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed, his hand seals flying as he activated the concealment array set up around the Divine Celestial Peak.

In an instant, endless clouds and mist emerged and churned from the void, completely sealing off the area for dozens of miles around the True Martial Peak, isolating it from the outside. No external divine sense could penetrate it anymore.

He had just finished all this when the next moment, above the Divine Celestial Peak, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth went into turmoil.

Invisible laws were violently disturbed by the pull of the seed's gravity.

Within a radius of hundreds of miles, all the wisps of thunder aura and the pure Qi of the high sky frantically converged towards the top of the Divine Celestial Peak, towards Xu Yunfan's location!

Countless fine, invisible torrents of spiritual energy pierced through the cave dwelling's restrictions, ignored physical barriers, and poured directly into Xu Yunfan's body, injecting themselves into the newly born Divine Celestial Seed.

This process was accompanied by a low, rumbling sound like muffled thunder, echoing in the meditation chamber, and the ground of the cave dwelling trembled slightly.

The silver thunder patterns inside the seed frantically flickered and writhed, as if they had come to life.

They were greedily devouring the massive amount of energy.

With the injection of energy, the patterns on the seed's surface began to evolve from flat "brands" into a "three-dimensional" form, growing and developing.
