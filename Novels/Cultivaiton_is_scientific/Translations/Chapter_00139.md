# Chapter 139: Emerging from Seclusion

"Training a Foundation Establishment cultivator isn't easy for the sect. I know you have grievances, but the sect has done its best to be fair!" Sect Leader Yu patiently persuaded.

For the esteemed leader of Tianhai Sect to speak so gently to Li Shiming—firstly because of his connection to Yin Shilan, and secondly due to Li Shiming's own talent in formations—was remarkable. 

In such a short time, Li Shiming had become an intermediate formation master with a Starlight Sea formation. His progression speed surpassed even Yin Shilan's, suggesting his formation talent might be superior.

"I have no grievances. I only wish to retrieve my 'Thousand-Mile Vision'. As for the compensation from the Yun family, I won't accept it," Li Shiming stubbornly replied.

Sect Leader Yu felt a headache coming on. Li Shiming's attitude conveyed a growing sense of detachment.

He took out his identity jade slip and contacted Deacon Xu.

Deacon Xu arrived quickly, though his expression was troubled.

"The case is closed. Return Li Shiming's 'Thousand-Mile Vision' to him," Sect Leader Yu ordered with a wave.

"Sect Leader, the 'Thousand-Mile Vision' was taken by Peak Master Zhao for evidence verification and hasn't been returned yet," Deacon Xu explained instead of producing the item.

"Then have Peak Master Zhao return it immediately!" Sect Leader Yu said angrily before turning to Li Shiming. "Wait here for a moment."

Li Shiming nodded and waited quietly.

The 'Thousand-Mile Vision' was bound to his identity jade slip—useless to anyone else.

Deacon Xu soon returned, and Sect Leader Yu could tell from his expression that complications had arisen.

"Here are 1,000 spirit stones. Peak Master Zhao said he accidentally damaged the 'Thousand-Mile Vision' and is compensating you double," Deacon Xu placed the spirit stones before Li Shiming.

The atmosphere in the room grew tense. Li Shiming had refused 150,000 spirit stones in compensation, asking only for his property back—yet even this simple request had been denied.

"Please return these 1,000 spirit stones to Peak Master Zhao on my behalf. Even if my item is in pieces, I want those pieces returned," Li Shiming pushed the spirit stones back.

"Sect Leader, I'll take my leave now," Li Shiming stood and bowed before departing.

After Li Shiming left, Sect Leader Yu turned to Deacon Xu with a dark expression. "Explain what really happened."

While cultivators could easily cause great destruction, they were also masters of control. The idea that Peak Master Zhao had "accidentally" damaged the item was hardly believable.

Deacon Xu sighed. "Peak Master Zhao gave the 'Thousand-Mile Vision' to a newly supported merchant group for research. But as soon as they dismantled it, it burned out."

This wasn't Peak Master Zhao's explanation but intelligence gathered by Sect Leader Yu's network, of which Deacon Xu was a key member.

Sect Leader Yu shook his head. The Hidden Dragon Trading House, connected to him, had used the 'Thousand-Mile Vision II' to establish a sales network. With the Yun family's trading house collapsing, Hidden Dragon now monopolized the market.

Though the market catered to Qi Refinement cultivators, controlling such a large share brought staggering profits.

Peak Master Zhao and Sect Leader Yu might not care about these profits personally, but they had descendants and disciples to support. Securing legitimate benefits for them was natural.

Sect Leader Yu couldn't outright condemn Peak Master Zhao's actions—they were for the benefit of Gen Peak and its disciples. But provoking Li Shiming at this juncture would only deepen his disillusionment with the sect.

"Time may heal this. I hope Li Shiming doesn't truly leave the sect," he mused.

An intermediate formation master with knowledge of the sect's grand formation couldn't be allowed to defect—the only alternative would be elimination. Sect Leader Yu didn't want it to come to that.
