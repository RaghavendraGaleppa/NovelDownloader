# Chapter 2: The Copper Mine

Stepping out of the cave dwelling, Chen Daoxuan felt a heavy weight in his heart.

Thirteenth Uncle had sacrificed his own path of cultivation to support his training—a kindness so profound it shook him to the core.

Since his rebirth into this world, Chen Daoxuan had only heard of cultivators resorting to deceit, plunder, and murder for their own advancement. Never had he encountered someone who would forsake their own path for the sake of a junior. Such selflessness was rare, not just in this world but even back on Earth.

Yet, recalling Chen Xianhe's earnest guidance over the years, Chen Daoxuan couldn't help but feel at peace.

Activating his Wind Riding Technique, he soared through the misty mountain peaks like an immortal.

The journey passed without incident.

After roughly the time it took to burn half an incense stick, a brownish mountain peak came into view. Compared to the cave dwellings of Chen Daoxuan and Chen Xianhe, this barren hill resembled a featherless vulture—ugly and desolate.

This was the Chen Clan's micro spiritual mine—the Copper Mine, from which the Copper Mountain Range derived its name.

As he approached, Chen Daoxuan spotted groups of commoners in coarse linen shirts entering and exiting the mine shafts—all members of the Chen Clan from Changping County.

At the mine, the overseer, Chen Liangyu, immediately noticed Chen Daoxuan descending from the sky.

Before Chen Daoxuan even landed, Chen Liangyu hurried forward and bowed deeply. "Greetings, Immortal Master."

In this world, cultivators were the absolute ruling class. Thus, despite Chen Daoxuan being only sixteen, Chen Liangyu dared not show the slightest disrespect due to his youth.

"We are both members of the Chen Clan. No need for formalities," Chen Daoxuan said, raising a hand slightly as he landed.

With a single glance, Chen Daoxuan could tell Chen Liangyu's cultivation had improved—from the sixth to the seventh layer of the Innate Realm. Though Chen Daoxuan only inspected the mine once a year, he still remembered the overseer. However, whether sixth or seventh layer, to a cultivator, the difference was negligible. The Innate Realm and the Qi Refining Realm were simply not comparable.

After a pause, Chen Daoxuan smiled. "I'm here to check this year's copper ore output."

At this, Chen Liangyu's weathered face, previously wreathed in smiles, fell. He replied cautiously, "Reporting to the Immortal Master, this year's output has declined further—only about three and a half catties."

Sure enough, Chen Daoxuan's brow furrowed slightly. The situation was worse than Chen Xianhe had estimated. The mine was likely exhausted. Even if they mined recklessly, little would remain.

Taking a deep breath, Chen Daoxuan said, "Take me to see it."

"Right this way, Immortal Master!" Chen Liangyu bowed and gestured for Chen Daoxuan to follow, leading him toward the ore storage building.

The Copper Mine had three shafts, and the miners and overseers lived in simple wooden huts nearby. Among these, a three-story pavilion stood out—the temporary ore storage facility. Chen Liangyu resided there, ostensibly to safeguard the ore, but in truth, he simply preferred not to share the cramped, foul-smelling barracks with the miners.

Of course, despite the harsh conditions, the Chen clansmen willingly worked here—not due to coercion but because of the generous rewards. The clan stipulated that anyone who volunteered to mine for three months would exempt their family from taxes for a year. Additionally, miners earned one tael of silver per month. Such benefits made mining a coveted job among the Chen Clan—a high-paying position akin to a state-owned enterprise in Chen Daoxuan's past life.

Upon reaching the storage pavilion, Chen Liangyu quickly produced a key and unlocked the bronze padlock. He then guided Chen Daoxuan inside.

After navigating several turns, Chen Liangyu handed Chen Daoxuan an exquisite wooden box. "Immortal Master, all the ore mined since last year is in here."

Chen Daoxuan nodded indifferently and flicked his sleeve, releasing a surge of Qi.

With a click, the box opened, revealing three large and one small piece of reddish ore. Unlike ordinary copper ore, these stones pulsed with an indescribable energy—visible even to mortals.

Spiritual essence—the defining feature that set spiritual ore apart from mundane minerals. Typically, the grade of spiritual ore was determined by the richness of its essence.

After verifying the contents, Chen Daoxuan tapped his storage pouch and stowed the ore away.

Seeing this, Chen Liangyu exhaled in relief.

Noticing his reaction, Chen Daoxuan smiled faintly and relayed Thirteenth Uncle's orders in detail.

"What? The clan leader wants to mine the vein to exhaustion?" Chen Liangyu was stunned.

But Chen Daoxuan wouldn't fabricate such a command. The clan leader truly intended to abandon the mine. Given its dwindling output, the vein was clearly depleted. Rather than prolonging its decline, it made sense to extract everything at once.

After a moment's thought, Chen Liangyu looked up. "Immortal Master, if we exhaust the mine, our current workforce won't suffice, and the expenses will rise significantly..."

Chen Daoxuan waved off the concern. The cost was trivial—mere silver, worthless to cultivators.

"Don't worry. I'll instruct the Changping County magistrate to assist you. I'm informing you in advance so you can prepare."

Chen Liangyu bowed in acknowledgment, though inwardly, his mood soured. Exhausting the mine meant not only its abandonment but also the end of his tenure as overseer. His position had granted him status nearly equal to the county magistrate's. Aside from the clan's exalted cultivators, he had been among the most influential figures. Managing the mine's operations and personnel, even interacting with the clan's immortals—who would willingly give up such a coveted role?

Yet the clan leader's decree was absolute. As a mere seventh-layer Innate cultivator, he had no grounds to oppose it.
