# Chapter 33: Fusion

After leaving Qingfu Temple, Zhou Qing stood atop the mountain peak, gazing into the distance. The Western Mountains stretched endlessly, their peaks clustered together like a gathering crowd. Within the hundreds of miles of dense forest lay countless dangers and mysteries. Over the years, Qingfu Temple had yet to explore the vast majority of these primordial woods.

Even in the modern world, venturing into such untamed wilderness would be perilous. Yet as Zhou Qing looked out, an inexplicable impulse surged within him—a desire to immerse himself in the wild. Was it because of his Five Animals Exercises training? A natural affinity for the mountains and forests?

He suppressed the feeling.

On his way back down the mountain, Zhou Qing passed by Hu Village and asked the village elder to commission three new wooden dummies from the local carpenter. The autumn harvest had ended, and it was now the farming off-season. The carpenter, delighted with the order, set to work immediately.

During a casual conversation with the elder, Zhou Qing learned that the mountains had become restless lately. Several hunters from nearby villages had gone into the woods to hunt, spending the night in makeshift cabins, only to vanish by morning. Other hunters deduced there were no signs of them leaving the cabins, no traces of wild animals nearby, no disturbances to the traps set around the cabins, and no evidence of a struggle...

The whole affair was eerie.

Though the hunters' families had reported it to the authorities, it was unlikely anything would come of it.

The elder sighed, mentioning that the village blacksmith, Hu, had also ventured into the mountains and hadn't been heard from in a long time. Who knew if something had happened to him?

Several hunters, armed and with traps set, could have defended themselves even against tigers, leopards, or wolves. Yet there were no signs of beasts or any struggle near the cabins...

On his way home, Zhou Qing couldn't shake the suspicion that this was related to something supernatural. Given his own experiences, such things undoubtedly existed.

Take, for example, the large mulberry tree in his courtyard or the rooster, Maori. If they ever gained sentience, who knew what strange occurrences they might cause?

But Zhou Qing wasn't afraid. After all, he was becoming less and less ordinary himself.

---

Another month passed. Autumn faded into winter.

Zhou Qing consumed another Blood Qi Pill refined from a five-leaf ginseng and once again attempted to break through to the "Proficient" level in the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist.

Even with the pill's aid, he remained half a step away from mastering the technique. If he failed this time, he had no idea how long he'd be stuck at this bottleneck.

The difficulty of the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist increased exponentially the further one progressed. His earlier estimates had been overly optimistic.

Moreover, the Literary Mind (Beginner) talent, which had previously helped him overcome training bottlenecks, no longer worked for advancing the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist to the Proficient stage. Clearly, breaking through required even greater effort.

---

In the courtyard, Zhou Qing practiced the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist for the third time when the effects of the Blood Qi Pill finally wore off. The Crane Force and Tiger Heat within him still hadn't fully merged. Instead, their constant clashes caused an uncomfortable swelling pain in his dantian.

Zhou Qing halted the fusion process.

Crane Force belonged to the Metal element, while Tiger Heat belonged to Water. Despite extensive theorizing—treating his body as a furnace, the training as stoking the flames, and the two internal forces as medicinal ingredients to be refined like an alchemical pill—his three previous attempts had all failed at the final step.

What was missing?

He paused to reflect.

Was the Blood Qi Pill insufficient? Did he need a six-leaf ginseng instead?

Zhou Qing shook his head. He could still feel the pill's effects lingering. But he only had three pills left—he needed to conserve them.

Three more chances.

He adjusted his approach, replaying every detail of his past attempts in his mind.

As he pondered, time slipped away.

In his mind, he visualized the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist repeatedly. The mental image of himself practicing gradually faded, replaced by a transparent figure.

Then, the figure vanished.

A black tiger and a white crane appeared in his mind, vivid and lifelike.

Yet something was missing—they lacked the spark of true vitality.

"Life?"

Though Zhou Qing had captured the essence of tigers and cranes through his training, he wasn't a tiger or a crane. Their anatomies were fundamentally different. No matter how well he embodied their spirit, they couldn't truly come alive.

"No, it's that my essence isn't enough."

He thought of his calligraphy—"Admonitions to My Son" and "Magnolia Flower: An Ancient Farewell." Both pieces carried a divine presence. He had channeled the spirit of the texts into his brushstrokes, forming the foundation of his Literary Mind (Beginner).

The Literary Mind had helped him grasp the essence of the tiger, deer, and other forms, aiding his training. But it clearly wasn't enough to break through the bottleneck to the Proficient stage.

Was that really the case?

The Literary Mind was the crystallization of spiritual intent.

"So...?"

A flash of insight struck him. With a thought, the characters of his Literary Mind (Beginner) in his Mental Cultivation Interface shattered, leaving only a faint, translucent shadow.

An intangible spiritual force merged with the black tiger and white crane in his mind.

---

Zhou Qing had never felt anything like this before. It was as if he had truly become a tiger and a crane. His perspective shifted—a clear tiger's roar and a piercing crane's cry echoed in his mind.

Without hesitation, he popped the remaining three Blood Qi Pills into his mouth and began practicing the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist.

His body heated up rapidly, dispelling the cold, as if he were a walking furnace. The Tiger Heat and the sharp Crane Force began to merge slowly but surely.

He executed the form nine times in succession.

With a final tiger's roar and crane's cry, Zhou Qing ended his practice and stood silently.

The mulberry tree in the courtyard rustled its leaves, as if in celebration.

Maori the rooster spread its wings, praising the Tiger King. Its eyes darted around, searching for the invisible crane whose cries it could hear beside Zhou Qing.

After a moment of silence, Zhou Qing threw a punch with each hand. The accompanying crane's cry and tiger's roar were clearer than ever, and his movements felt lighter.

He examined the newly fused Tiger-Crane Force—retaining the Crane Force's sharp agility while inheriting the Tiger Heat's healing, body-strengthening, and blood-enhancing properties. Moreover, the effects were slightly amplified.

Turning his attention to the Mental Cultivation Interface, he saw the words "Literary Mind (Beginner)" had faded, nearly transparent. So this was the true purpose of the Literary Mind.

"Does this mean I can use it to fuse other internal forces in the future?" Zhou Qing speculated. He suspected it was possible.

He then reviewed his complete status:

**Five Animals Exercises (Adept):**  
- Tiger (Proficient)  
- Deer (Proficient)  
- Bear (Adept)  
- Bird (Adept)  
- Monkey (Adept)  

**Martial Techniques:**  
- Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist (Proficient)  
- Finger Flick Divine Skill (Transcendent)  
- Breeze Talisman Codex (Skilled)  

**Esoteric Skills:**  
- Revival Talisman Codex (Beginner)  

**Basic Alchemy (Novice):** Blood Qi Pills  

**Literary Mind (Beginner):** Characters faint and translucent.  

**Remaining Lifespan:** 55 years.  

Zhou Qing exhaled softly. With a flicker of movement, he darted into the array of wooden dummies in the courtyard.

Tiger's roar. Crane's cry.

The dummy arms snapped one after another, their tops flying off.

In one fluid motion, it was done.

Zhou Qing stood with his hands behind his back, surveying the scattered wood chips, broken arms, and severed tops. Though his hands were red and trembling slightly, a profound sense of fulfillment welled up within him.

From the confusion, aimlessness, and anxiety of his early days after transmigrating—worrying about mere survival—to now possessing considerable strength and status, no longer needing to tread carefully... His mindset had lightened considerably.

Moreover, he now wielded martial prowess far beyond anything he'd achieved in his previous life, with the potential to pursue longevity.

No one but him could understand this transformation.

The pent-up emotions he'd carried were finally released in the destruction of the dummies.

"Though threats like the Zhang family and the Fierce Tiger Gang still loom, and I won't feel entirely at ease until they're dealt with..." Zhou Qing knew he now had more options to confront such dangers.

He drew the ancient iron sword and practiced swordplay for a while.

His left-handed swordplay was unpredictable, with tricky angles. The flexibility of his left hand allowed for faster reactions and variations.

Unfortunately, he lacked a systematic sword technique.

"Though that's not entirely true."

He thought of the Bird Form. It shared similarities with swordplay and the Crane Form. Having focused on the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist until now, he could shift his attention to the Bear and Bird Forms.

The Bear Form would further strengthen his upper body, enhancing the power of his tiger and crane techniques while improving his resilience. In real combat, a single heavy blow could incapacitate an opponent instantly. The dramatic cries of pain often seen in fiction rarely happened in life-or-death battles—severe pain could leave one unable to scream or even move.

The monk who had infiltrated his courtyard had been instantly disabled by Zhou Qing's Finger Flick Divine Skill and a heavy punch. Yet even then, the monk had managed a counterattack that injured Zhou Qing's shoulder.

This demonstrated the monk's superior endurance, honed through rigorous training—though such training often led to hidden injuries.

With the Mental Cultivation Interface, Zhou Qing could train relentlessly without such drawbacks. Unfortunately, his five-leaf ginseng supply was exhausted.

His current achievements owed much to the Blood Qi Pills. Without them, mastering the Tiger-Crane Dual Form Fist before the provincial exams would have been impossible.

In fitness, diet accounts for seventy percent, training for thirty. The same principle applied to cultivation.

Ordinary ginseng couldn't produce proper Blood Qi Pills, but Zhou Qing had adjusted the formula to create what he called "Defective Blood Qi Pills." Though far inferior to the originals, they were still better than Black Chicken Pills for recovery. Yet after consuming real Blood Qi Pills, the defective ones tasted like ash.

If not for the lack of alternatives, Zhou Qing wouldn't bother with them now.

After taking three to restore his energy, he still felt unsatisfied. He visited three taverns in succession, eating his fill.

Then he headed to the Lin residence.

"Scholar Zhou, you only visit when you need something. What is it this time?" Miss Lin greeted him cheerfully, cutting straight to the point.

The more Zhou Qing sought her help, the more it signified the Lin family's importance to him. Even if he failed the provincial exams, she'd gladly support him for life.

In Jiangzhou, with no relatives and suspected to be from a minor branch of a prominent family, Zhou Qing was talented, handsome, and met all of Lin Tai's criteria for a son-in-law—except that his talents were too great.

She had copies of Zhou Qing's imperial exam essays evaluated by scholars, who praised their balance and potential to pass the provincial exams. Even if he failed next year, he'd succeed eventually.

For a merchant family like hers, such a man was someone to attach themselves to, ensuring the stability of their business. Without official backing, no amount of business acumen could prevent eventual exploitation.

The Zhang family were local tyrants who devoured everything in their path. Without male heirs, the Lin family was vulnerable. Only Lin Tai's lingering influence kept them from being swallowed whole.

Thus, the Lin family needed Zhou Qing far more than he needed them—even as a mere scholar. Because for them, there was no better option.

Provided Zhou Qing passed the exams.

That depended on fate.

Did the Lin family have that fortune? Did Zhou Qing?

Once seated, Zhou Qing got straight to the point: "Do you have any five-leaf ginseng left?"

Though he'd mentally prepared himself, asking outright still made him blush. But with strength at stake, pride was irrelevant.

In fact, he should have asked earlier.

He still had some face to save.

"Scholar Zhou, I'm afraid not. Five-leaf ginseng isn't as rare as the six-leaf variety, but it's seldom available in Jiangzhou. The last one was a lucky find."

That had been Lin Tai's personal stash. When Zhou Qing declined an initial gift, Lin Tai had instructed his daughter to present it under the pretext of aiding his studies—a plausible excuse.

There was another reason: Fuso had written to Lin Tai, praising Zhou Qing but noting his depleted vitality. Hence the ginseng.

"Is there any way to acquire more?"

Miss Lin pondered. "There might be. I heard the Fierce Tiger Gang recently obtained a five-leaf ginseng. Let me see what I can do."

Zhou Qing shook his head. "Never mind." He didn't want to impose too much on her.
