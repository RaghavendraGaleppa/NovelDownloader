# Chapter 322: Scheming

Zhao Yu’s breathing was rapid, causing his broken ribs to tremble rhythmically with each breath. When his Adam’s apple bobbed, the pulsing of his carotid artery remained steady as a pendulum, though the blood flow within him had accelerated slightly due to agitation.

These subtle reactions intertwined in Xu Yunfan’s eyes, forming a physiological map that could not be faked.

Every word was sincere, coming from the heart.

“...”

Xu Yunfan was taken aback at first, then shook his head and laughed helplessly, a flash of absurdity crossing his eyes.

He had thought there must be some profound meaning behind this matter, but he never expected it to be due to such a ridiculous reason.

Xu Yunfan’s five fingers tightened slightly, and Zhao Yu’s face immediately flushed red, the fear in his eyes intensifying.

He wanted to argue further, but he saw a cold light flash in Xu Yunfan’s eyes. Xu Yunfan twisted his wrist gently, and with a crisp *crack*, Zhao Yu’s neck tilted to the side at a bizarre angle, the light in his eyes instantly freezing.

Xu Yunfan released his grip, letting Zhao Yu’s corpse slump softly to the ground.

He was about to step out of this dark side room when his figure suddenly paused, and his brows furrowed.

A mediocre fellow like Zhao Yu was usually not even worth a glance from the inner disciples of the Sword Pavilion, yet now he had managed to incite a true disciple of the Sword Pavilion to come looking for trouble. The strangeness in this was self-evident.

“With your meager skills, how dare you try to stir up the Sword Pavilion?”

He looked at Zhao Yu, who lay on the ground without a sound, and a strange feeling surged in his heart. This matter was too suspicious.

How could a waste like Zhao Yu persuade a true disciple of the Sword Pavilion?

Let alone make someone as arrogant and proud as Jiang Jingguo willing to stand up for him.

“No... it wasn't about standing up for him. It should be that Jiang Jingguo has an inherently paranoid nature. Someone led him to the Changfeng Tavern, and Taoist Sect’s Chen Hong happened to bring me in... but how could they calculate that I would go out for a stroll... It should have been a casual move, but they didn't expect me to step right into it... However, they misjudged my strength and were killed by my arrow in a heap.”

Xu Yunfan muttered to himself, his gaze sweeping slowly through the side room.

The furnishings in the room were simple. Apart from a wooden table and a few chairs, there was only an inconspicuous incense burner in the corner, from which a wisp of green smoke was rising.

The fragrance was faint, but it caused the pure Yang true energy within Xu Yunfan to churn slightly.

He suddenly realized that the incense burned in the burner was likely some kind of hallucinogen that could disturb one’s mind.

Thinking back to Jiang Jingguo’s unnatural manic state and his final诡异 act of severing his own heart meridian, everything was explained.

“A fine move to kill with a borrowed knife.”

Xu Yunfan sneered. The ‘Lin’ character mantra flickered slightly in his sea of consciousness, suppressing the slight agitation.

Xu Yunfan snorted coldly, shifting his gaze away from the incense burner and not looking at it again.

He strode out of the side room’s threshold, the night wind carrying the smell of blood rushing towards him.

Just as he was about to leap towards the main room where Chen Hong was, his figure suddenly stopped.

In the center of the courtyard, a tall, slender figure stood with hands clasped behind his back. The bright moonlight, like flowing mercury, outlined a hazy halo around the man.

“The method of absorbing the essence of heaven and earth from the Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock?”

Xu Yunfan’s brows raised slightly. Under the man’s absorption, the spiritual energy in the courtyard had become relatively denser, causing the pure Yang true energy within Xu Yunfan to unconsciously accelerate its circulation.

He saw the halo, like smoke or mist, sometimes transforming into the shape of a swimming dragon circling around the man, and sometimes condensing into the phantom of a jade lock hanging three inches above the crown of his head.

This was the strange phenomenon that occurred when the *Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock*, secretly passed down by the Sect Master of the Taoist Sect, was cultivated to a profound realm, drawing the essence of heaven and earth into the body.

Each wisp of the halo circulated through a strange meridian cycle, appearing even more mysterious under the reflection of the moonlight.

The night wind suddenly died down, and even the insect cries in the courtyard vanished. Only the faint clanging sound emitted by the flowing halo remained, like the striking of gold and jade.

Hearing this, Bi Sheng retracted his distant gaze, a half-smile curling at the corner of his mouth. The moonlight cast uneven shadows on his gaunt face.

“Not entirely foolish.”

His fingers in his sleeves rubbed together, producing a clear sound as if he were kneading the moonlight to condense pills.

“To see through this layer of the joint, you haven’t wasted the Purple Gold Bone-Forging Pills your master has consumed over these past months.”

Speaking of the pills, a trace of resentment couldn’t help but appear on Bi Sheng’s face.

Heaven knows that in the past few hundred years, the Taoist Sect has only had Xu Yunfan using such luxurious items. The daily consumption of one person is comparable to the value of an entire peak. How could this not provoke envy?

Xu Yunfan’s knuckles unconsciously stroked the dragon patterns on the Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace. As his Adam’s apple bobbed, his voice sounded somewhat strange.

“Did you know about this matter, Senior Uncle?”

“Only about half a cup of tea’s time earlier than you.”

Bi Sheng’s sleeves suddenly moved without wind, and the true energy formed by the Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock circulated ceaselessly around him.

His gaze towards the main room suddenly turned cold, but his voice remained calm.

“Thirty-six peaks of Qingwei Mountain, with over a hundred thousand disciples. From the outer gate laborers gathering herbs to the true disciples of each peak, who didn’t climb up by stepping on others, expending every bit of effort and scheming?”

The jade lock halo flickered, casting the vertical lines between his brows as deep as if carved by a knife.

“Shen Wuaya has been the Deputy Sect Master for nearly a hundred years, and he still has moments of misjudgment. Let alone those...”

He suddenly stopped here.

He sighed, “The Taoist Sect is simply too big. With hundreds of thousands of people up and down, it’s not surprising for all kinds of thoughts to arise. Your master, Deputy Sect Master Shen Wuaya, and the various peak masters and elders—over the years, various forces have become intertwined and entangled. If you pull one hair, the whole body is affected. It’s not rare for some unforgivable scum to slip in.”

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, understanding this matter.

“Senior Uncle, why don’t I go kill someone first, and then we can sit down and chat?”

As long as Chen Hong wasn’t dead, he would always have it on his mind, unable to eat or sleep properly, feeling uncomfortable all over.

Bi Sheng was speechless for a moment, then shook his head and said, “There’s no rush for this matter. He’s just a small fry. Let’s keep him to lure the big fish. If you kill him so easily, everything that follows will be cut off.”

Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred slightly upon hearing this. He wasn’t in a hurry anymore. If Chen Hong was kept alive, they could naturally follow the trail to find the source later.

Xu Yunfan was clear-headed and cupped his hands in salute. “Senior Uncle is right to admonish me.”

Bi Sheng smiled slightly. “Young people shouldn’t be too impetuous; you need to practice more.”

Xu Yunfan’s knuckles unconsciously stroked the dragon scale patterns on the Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace, suddenly falling into deep thought.

Memories from his previous life as a technical worker flashed through his mind like a revolving lantern: late nights spent hunched over drawing blueprints, plans repeatedly rejected by clients, and the endless structural stress data that could never be calculated completely.

At that time, he was like a craftsman who kept his head down polishing parts, even making excuses to skip departmental team-building activities.

“Having lived two lives, I’ve inherited all the quirks of being solitary.”

He tugged at the corner of his mouth in self-mockery.

This life of practicing martial arts was even worse. Apart from the necessary etiquette within the sect, most of his time was spent constantly increasing his proficiency panel.

Thinking of Jiang Jingguo’s suspicious suicide today, and Senior Uncle Bi Sheng’s meaningful words, “Don’t let yourself be used as a spear.”
