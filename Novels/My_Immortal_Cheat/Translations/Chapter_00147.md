# Chapter 147: Stealing an Opportunity

The other four deities also summoned projections of their Divine Kingdoms, calling upon their Divine Kingdom Saints to assist them. In an instant, the area transformed into a vast battlefield where hundreds of thousands of individuals stood in confrontation. Moreover, an endless stream of people continued to emerge from the deities' Divine Kingdoms.

Zhou Changsheng's brows furrowed. Although their side was aided by army formation techniques, the opponents had an inexhaustible supply of soldiers. If the battle dragged on, they would be mired in a deep quagmire.

Without further hesitation, Zhou Changsheng extended a large hand, and an ancient spear appeared in his grip. The battle spear was blood-red, radiating immense power. The spear tip was wreathed in the River of Time, capable of piercing through eternity, its might unparalleled!

"Kill!" Zhou Changsheng swung the battle spear, his azure-gold armor glowing, wrapped in divine laws. This was also a Heavenly King-tier supreme treasure, providing him protection.

Though there were seven opponents, he showed no fear, charging forward directly. He could sense that only the Saint God, Thunder God, and Death God possessed power equal to his. The other four deities' host bodies were slightly weaker. On his side, there were only five Heavenly Kings, with two of his younger brothers already injured, barely managing to contend with one of those four deities each.

*Clang!* The Saint God Lord's immortal sword appeared in his hand and slashed upwards. The area was instantly annihilated, the void exploding, and chaos spread everywhere. Then, two figures rapidly entangled, blazing sword light and terrifying spear tips streaking across the space like dazzling lightning bolts, one after another.

Subsequently, blood rain poured down, and myriad heavenly phenomena emerged. The aftermath of their battle was actually manifesting. Within it, there were scenes of the rise and fall of races, the demise of powerful beings, the creation of heaven and earth, and the signs of apocalypse, all terrifying beyond measure. This was the collision of their wills.

"Kill!" The Thunder God Lord made his move, standing tall and majestic in the void, appearing as ancient as if he had existed for millions of years. His colossal body emitted symbols, and mysterious patterns glowed—these were incantations, transforming into tangible Great Dao patterns. Here, he constructed an altar, connecting with the formidable power of his own Divine Kingdom, immediately triggering a resonance that formed an unprecedentedly grand altar.

"Thunder Dao Severing Heavens!" he roared, a booming shout that shook heaven and earth. Wind and clouds surged, the altar glowed, drawing in endless lightning, guiding it towards Zhou Changsheng.

"Do you take us for non-existent?" A sharp cry rang out as the River of Righteous Qi manifested. A powerful expert from the Grand Luo Academy emerged from the void, radiating immeasurable light. Grand power accompanied him, elevating him to an extreme brilliance, like an emperor nurtured within a blazing white sun. Amidst clanging sounds, the Academy expert donned a layer of white armor, which was the crystallization of his entire essence—his magical power, spirit, and other elements coalesced, and his fundamental Great Dao runes flowed.

*Boom!* The Academy expert, clad in Righteous Qi armor, unleashed overwhelming white radiance. Though he looked like a scholar, he charged directly into the battlefield, his right palm like a blade, slicing open the altar.

The Saint God Lord's expression was cold. Wielding his sacred sword, immeasurable light followed behind him, making him appear incredibly divine. Yet, as he unleashed his full power, scenes of powerful beings he had slaughtered in the past and images of world destruction emerged. He seemed supremely sacred, pure white and radiant, but to become a top-tier ancient deity, how could he have risen peacefully?

The Death God also entered the fray, holding a massive black scythe etched with mysterious patterns, its design exaggerated to an extreme. With a swing, dark energy permeated, and huge cracks appeared in the void. A powerful expert from the Dao Alliance waved a whisk, purple qi spreading, tangling with and neutralizing the dark energy.

The other four deities' host bodies also joined the battle. They were all elemental deities: flames surged, wind blade cyclones raged, ancient divine mountains pressed down, and water dragons obscured the sky. The two injured Heavenly Kings from the Kyushu side also joined in.

It was five against seven, yet for a time, the battle was evenly matched. The true bodies of those deities might have been Dao Masters, but deities could only exert their full strength within their own Divine Kingdoms, and their power was inherently weakened when descending upon host bodies. Even if they forcefully used certain secret techniques to enhance those host bodies, the boost was limited.

Generals fought generals, and soldiers fought soldiers. Zhou Changsheng and his allies were locked in a fierce struggle, while the soldiers below also engaged in a brutal melee. The Kyushu side utilized army formation techniques. Confronting the Divine Kingdom Saints was basically a one-sided slaughter, especially from the Artifact Kingdom's side, which employed a special artifact that absorbed all the lightning creatures from the Thunder God Lord's Divine Kingdom. If not for the lightning carrying the Thunder God Lord's imprint, requiring time for conversion, there would have been no consumption whatsoever.

However, with the Divine Kingdom gates constantly open, the more they slaughtered, the more Saints appeared, yet the situation remained in a deadlock.

"Everyone, I'll go ahead!" Zhou Xunchuan laughed loudly, his body wreathed in surging qi and blood, and he leaped from the ancient ship. He found an enemy captain-level Saint, shattered him with a single punch, then charged straight through until he encountered a Saint-level Saint. Nearby soldiers also cooperated with him.

The others also charged down. Tian Ling nodded at him and entered the battlefield. In a short while, only Zhou Tian remained on the ancient ship's deck.

Zhou Tian glanced at the meat grinder below but had no intention of descending. It wasn't that he was afraid, but in such a battlefield, the role he could play would be minimal. He looked up at the Pantheon floating in the void. Although the ancient bronze hall's gate had opened a crack wide enough for someone to enter, its surface was still enveloped by a layer of seals. It wasn't so simple to enter; certain conditions had to be met. However, for Zhou Tian, it was effectively non-existent. As long as the gate's thickness didn't exceed three thousand one hundred meters, he could simply teleport inside.

Zhou Tian rubbed his chin. Zhou Changsheng and the others were already fighting intensely in the Nine Heavens, the void shaking unceasingly. Huge cracks extended across the sky. As if by some unspoken agreement, they kept the battlefield away from where the armies clashed, as their combat aftermath was too immense and far-reaching.

It seemed he could sneak in. Zhou Tian surveyed his surroundings. The Ancient Heavenly Qin Ship wasn't too far from the peak of Myriad Gods Mountain; a few dozen teleports would get him there.

He decided to act. Why not seize the opportunity if he could? Zhou Tian made up his mind, directly leaving the ancient ship and heading towards the Pantheon.

His figure continuously flickered in the void. Zhou Tian's attention was highly focused, fearing that a stray bolt of lightning might strike him dead, which would be an utterly devastating loss. However, to his surprise, no one paid him any attention. It wasn't until he teleported to the ancient bronze gate of the Pantheon that Zhou Tian realized someone was already confronting it—people from Kyushu and Divine Kingdom Saints. Zhou Tian wasn't the only one with the idea of stealing an opportunity.
