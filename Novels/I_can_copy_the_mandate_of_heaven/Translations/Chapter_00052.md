## Chapter 52: Practicing

Growing up in the countryside, children often lacked exposure and couldn't distinguish between those who lived a life of luxury and those who didn't. As the carriage ride continued, Slytherin命 (Lǐ Zhīmìng) could easily spot the three young children from wealthy families, exuding an air of superiority.

The inferiority complex that came with growing up in the countryside was deeply ingrained in children like him. Some, like Liu Zhi, tried to latch onto others, while quiet ones like Han Li and Lǐ Zhīmìng focused on their own lives, much like how they would hide in the ground, concealed from others.

However, Jiang Yun's noble aura was palpable, evident from his delicate hands, which seemed to have never engaged in manual labor.

Jiang Yun was kneeling beside a wooden basin, his head bowed, and his hands submerged in the water as he gently massaged Lǐ Zhīmìng's feet. The warm water and gentle hands created a soothing sensation.

Lǐ Zhīmìng studied the medical prescription left by his master. Given his current situation as a mortal without spiritual roots, his future seemed bleak. His medical skills and the magic silver hand he learned from Mo Dàifu were his only assets.

The Seven Elephant Kung Fu (Qī Jiā Xiàng Gōng) was his only hope. Once he mastered it, he would be invincible in the mortal world. If he could combine it with the "Late Bloomer"命格, there was a slight chance he could break through to the highest realm, the "Great Accomplishment"境界, and fully master the power of a dragon elephant.

However, Lǐ Zhīmìng needed to perfect the prescription first. Although his understanding of medicine was on par with his master's, the "Ma Bo San" that Mo Dàifu couldn't crack in two years wouldn't be easily solved by Lǐ Zhīmìng either.

The issue lay in finding a specific medicinal herb that could numb the body while keeping the mind clear, allowing him to practice the Seven Elephant Kung Fu.

Lǐ Zhīmìng pondered, unsure where to find such a rare herb. He had plenty of time, though, and could study the prescription at leisure.

As he turned the page, Jiang Yun stood up, silently waiting for Lǐ Zhīmìng to finish his foot soak. After a while, Jiang Yun knelt down again, testing the water temperature with his fingers. "Should I add some hot water, young master?" he asked.

Lǐ Zhīmìng declined, pulling his legs out of the water and yawning. "I'm going to sleep."

Without waiting for Lǐ Zhīmìng to move, Jiang Yun gently wiped his feet dry with a towel and helped him put on his shoes. Only then did he step aside.

As the night went on, Lǐ Zhīmìng dozed off. The next morning, he took a shovel and went to the medicinal field to work on the drainage. After finishing, he headed to the back mountain to practice martial arts.

A senior brother, skilled in martial arts, followed him from a distance. Lǐ Zhīmìng chose a bamboo forest to practice, where a few bamboo mice scurried about.

"Run, go away," Lǐ Zhīmìng said without turning around. "I don't want to hurt you."

A large, silver-furred beast, about the size of an adult dog, emerged from behind Lǐ Zhīmìng. The beast, named Pǎo Pǎo, had been following Lǐ Zhīmìng for four years. It chased after the bamboo mice, causing a commotion in the forest.

One particularly scared mouse fell from a bamboo stalk, and Pǎo Pǎo sniffed it. The mouse pretended to be dead, eyes closed, as Pǎo Pǎo examined it.

Meanwhile, back at the mansion, Jiang Yun returned and was greeted by her companions, Zhong Jun and Xiè Jiā. They inquired about her experience with Lǐ Zhīmìng.

Jiang Yun described Lǐ Zhīmìng as possibly being very approachable. Zhong Jun and Xiè Jiā were overjoyed, relieved that their young master might be easy to get along with.

As they chatted, Lǐ Zhīmìng was already busy with his daily routine, unaware of the conversations about him. Jiang Yun couldn't help but feel a little flustered, realizing her own thoughts were absurd.
