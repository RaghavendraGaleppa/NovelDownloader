**Chapter 48: All is Ready**

Ling Hanjun remained rooted to the spot, fuming with rage, watching Chen Fei leave helplessly. If the two archers had been there, they might have been able to delay him a little. But those two were the quickest to die.

"You won't escape!" Ling Hanjun gnashed his teeth, turning to check on his subordinates' injuries.

Meanwhile, after leaving the black market, Chen Fei quickly returned to another courtyard he had rented within the county. In Pingyin County, Chen Fei had rented many courtyards precisely to have new places to stay in case of unexpected situations.

"This archery technique is quite useful, but the longbow itself is a bit weak." Chen Fei couldn't help but smile, recalling what had just happened. The power of the arrows was still a bit lacking; it was fine against Muscle Refinement Realm cultivators, but it would be tough against Bone Forging Realm ones. Especially against an expert like Ling Hanjun in the Bone Forging Realm, the arrows were practically useless.

"After reaching another place, I'll have a chance to buy a good bow. At the same time, my cultivation cannot fall behind." Chen Fei mused to himself; internal force cultivation was the true foundation after all. Otherwise, even if he had a good bow in front of him, it would be useless if he couldn't draw it.

Given that his spatial grid preserved items, he didn't have to worry about food spoilage. Chen Fei decided to treat himself better. He took out all the dry rations he had prepared from his spatial grid and went back to the streets to buy fresh food. Due to the Zhao family's frantic search, the entire Pingyin County seemed somewhat tumultuous, and the already deserted streets were even emptier, with everyone hiding in their homes.

After buying his provisions, Chen Fei also quickly returned to his courtyard, no longer wandering about. Originally, Chen Fei had planned to visit Zeng Defang. After all, Zeng Defang had been good to Chen Fei back at the medical hall. Chen Fei had even once considered helping Zeng Defang leave Pingyin County. But now, Zeng Defang was severely injured and had a family to care for. The rebels would simply not allow such a pill master to leave.

After checking the supplies in his spatial grid and confirming everything was in order, Chen Fei sat cross-legged and began cultivating his internal force. Gentle breathing sounds filled the room, and the entire night passed quietly.

In the early morning, Chen Fei disguised himself as an ordinary person and left the city. He encountered no issues at the city gate. After all, very few people could see through disguise techniques, and Chen Fei had cultivated this particular art to its peak, making it difficult for ordinary people to spot any clues.

Several miles outside the city, Chen Fei saw the agreed-upon meeting point: Wind-Moved Stone. Chen Fei did not immediately approach but found a higher vantage point to observe. As the hour of Chen (7-9 AM) drew nearer, figures slowly began to appear there.

Someone couldn't help but speak up.

Qian Jijiang, a smile on his face, raised a hand to quiet them. "It is a bit expensive, yes. For those who don't wish to pay, we can simply part ways. I, Qian, am not forcing any of you to hand over this money; it is entirely voluntary."

Several people exchanged glances. It was a chaotic time outside, plagued by war, and there were no merchant caravans. Asking them to travel to other cities alone genuinely made them hesitant, even for martial artists.

"Boss Qian, if we pay this money, can you guarantee our safety throughout the journey?" someone asked in a low voice.

"That I cannot guarantee," Qian Jijiang said with a smile, shaking his head. "I can only say that we will advance and retreat together when the time comes."

"With this money, I could just be careful and continue living in Pingyin County. Why bother with a long journey to some other place?"

Someone snorted coldly and turned to leave immediately. Another hesitated for a moment before also withdrawing from the group.

A moment later, only six people remained.
