# Chapter 29: Lost Spirit Rice

Phew...

On this day, Ding Rui, as usual, finished his work in Spirit Field 377, let out a long breath, stood up, and was about to go sit down for a while to rest, waiting for his work hours to end before going to work overtime.

The other cultivators hadn't finished yet. Only Yang Shou, who was at the peak of the third stage of Qi Refinement, stopped his work shortly after Ding Rui, stood up, stretched, and walked straight towards his own room.

"Senior Brother Ding!" Yang Shou greeted Ding Rui warmly as he passed by.

Although his cultivation was higher than Ding Rui's, Yang Shou's attitude towards Ding Rui was very polite. Calling him "Senior Brother" was also a way to express respect and courtesy. At this moment, almost no one in the entire spirit field area didn't call Ding Rui "Senior Brother". After the initial awkwardness and bewilderment, Ding Rui had grown accustomed to it. Moreover, he would also call others "Senior Brother," being polite to each other, as there was no strict seniority ranking within the sect.

"Senior Brother Yang, are you going back to your room again? I think it's better to cultivate under a tree; isn't the room too stuffy?" Ding Rui couldn't help but say to Yang Shou with a smile.

Yang Shou was startled, then also smiled and said, "Senior Brother Ding, you're too kind. I'm used to cultivating in my room."

"Oh, alright then," Ding Rui nodded, not saying anything more.

Ever since Yang Shou arrived at Spirit Field 377, almost every time he finished his work, he would immediately go back to his room, which made Ding Rui feel a bit strange. This person seemed a bit unsociable when it came to cultivation.

However, it was also very difficult to notice. Although the spirit rice of the Huaqing Realm was much larger than any rice he had seen in his previous life, in the end, there was a whole large cluster hanging on the rice stalk, and with so many spirit rice plants grown close together in the entire field, it was impossible to notice without a careful look.

"Hiss... did the spirit rice fall off?" he thought, looking down at the ground, but found no fallen spirit rice.

In reality, spirit rice was very difficult to detach from the spirit rice plant. Even after ripening, the spirit rice would remain firmly attached, impossible to remove without some force. Moreover, Ding Rui killed insects and weeded every day, constantly interacting with the ground of the spirit fields. If any spirit rice had fallen, there was no way he wouldn't have noticed.

But Ding Rui truly couldn't think of any other reason. How could spirit rice, growing perfectly on the plant, just detach itself? And where did those detached spirit rice grains go? Ding Rui's eyes flickered as he tried to figure out if there was something he had missed, or if this situation had happened before and he simply hadn't noticed. He walked along the spirit field, recalling things as he went, wanting to see if other spirit rice plants also had this condition. He didn't know until he looked, but once he did, he found it!

It should be known that although these spirit field cultivators themselves were not very powerful, these hundreds of spirit fields, however, contained all the cultivation resources of the entire sect! The sect could not possibly ignore them. He pondered for a long time but found no answer. He marked the locations of these few spirit rice plants, planning to call others over later to discuss it.

But just at this moment, Ding Rui suddenly stopped in his tracks, his eyes narrowing slightly. He thought of a very startling possibility.

"Could someone be... stealing?"

Ding Rui's heart rate suddenly quickened. He had whispered this thought to himself, but it still made him feel inexplicably nervous. His gaze swept across the entire spirit field. Everyone was doing their own work, and there was no sign of anything unusual.
