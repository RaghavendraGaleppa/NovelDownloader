# Chapter 18: Two Short Years 

To be honest, Wei Qian's days as a wandering cultivator with only the first level of Qi Refining weren't particularly dangerous. 

First, because he made daily wishes to improve his spiritual root aptitude and rarely ventured out. 

Second, because he was so poor at the time that no bandit cultivators would even glance at his meager possessions. 

But this situation was changing. As his cultivation steadily improved, so too did his attractiveness to bandit cultivators. 

Moreover, his increased cultivation allowed him to interact with stronger cultivators and access more dangerous locations. 

Take this absurd auction incident—who could have imagined a Golden Core demonic cultivator would attack? 

The probability wasn't just low—it was practically nonexistent. 

After all, demonic cultivators hadn't been seen in Zhao Country for nearly a thousand years, let alone a Golden Core demonic cultivator. 

Yet as long as the probability wasn't zero, it could still happen. 

Thus, this astronomically unlikely stroke of bad luck fell squarely on Wei Qian's head. 

Deeply shaken by the dangers of the cultivation world, Wei Qian reflected and developed an indirect divination technique. 

He would wish for his own safety, using the number of days required for the wish to gauge the level of danger. 

His divination about the Li family of Misty Ridge Mountain was just a small test. 

Next, he planned to divine the fate of a Golden Core cultivator! 

At this thought, Wei Qian felt a wave of nervousness. 

"Come on, Dragon Pearl, show me the answer," Wei Qian muttered, decisively closing his eyes. 

Before long, he opened them again, his face alight with joy. "Excellent!" 

The Dragon Pearl required four days for the wish—meaning the Golden Core demonic cultivator's attack would have some impact, but not a severe one. 

"Exactly. If an outsider Golden Core demonic cultivator appears in Yunzhou, the Grand Elder of Flowing Clouds Sect and the ancestor of the Alchemy Cauldron Xiao family won't just stand by." 

The cultivation world of Zhao Country was still firmly dominated by righteous factions. 

A foreign Golden Core demonic cultivator who acted too boldly would soon find himself "purged." 

After all, Zhao Country was a cultivation nation with a Nascent Soul-level power overseeing it. 

Unless the seven great demonic sects launched a full-scale invasion, a single demonic cultivator couldn't possibly cause much trouble. 

While Wei Qian knew the demonic cultivator wouldn't wreak havoc, the Li family didn't share his optimism. 

As time passed, details of the auction's aftermath began to spread. 

It was said that even without the Golden Core demonic cultivator deliberately slaughtering people, three-tenths of those present died on the spot! 

Adding those who perished in the chaos or were killed by bandit cultivators, the death toll reached a staggering fifty percent! 

In other words, half the attendees had died. 

Among the dead were several disciples of the Li family of Misty Ridge Mountain. 

Of the twenty who had attended, only eleven returned—three of them severely injured and left permanently disabled. 

Nine would never come back. 

In a grim twist, despite losing nine members, the Li family hadn't suffered a devastating blow. 

At least Li Wanhai, Li Caiwei, and Li Guchen had returned unharmed. 

Another minor clan, similar in strength to the Li family, had sent twelve members—only two died. 

One was their leader, an elder at the eighth level of Qi Refining. The other was the only son of the clan's current patriarch, an eighteen-year-old prodigy already at the fourth level of Qi Refining. 

Upon hearing the news, their clan's Foundation Establishment ancestor reportedly spat out a mouthful of blood in fury. 

If given the choice, he would have gladly traded the lives of the remaining ten to bring those two back. 

This tense atmosphere lasted a month. 

Then, Flowing Clouds Sect issued a proclamation stating that the Golden Core demonic cultivator had left Yunzhou and returned to the northern demonic territories. 

Zhao Country's sole Nascent Soul-level power, the Ten Thousand Stars Sect, had dispatched two Golden Core elders to "escort" him out. 

With Flowing Clouds Sect's announcement and the Ten Thousand Stars Sect's endorsement, the various factions across Yunzhou finally settled down. 

Of course, Wei Qian had long known this would happen. 

So, for that month, he focused entirely on cultivating the "Thousand Tribulations Body Forging Art," mastering its basics in just twenty-eight days. 

The burly man who had previously practiced this technique had taken nearly four months! 

Wei Qian's speed was thanks in no small part to the Wishing Dragon Pearl. 

Perhaps misfortune had finally given way to fortune. In addition to mastering the body cultivation technique, Wei Qian received Old Man Li's full guidance during this month. 

Believing Zhao Country's cultivation world was on the brink of catastrophe, Old Man Li taught him the art of spirit farming as if passing down a legacy. 

And there was even better news. 

Elder Li Wanqing's promised reward, delayed by a month, finally arrived. 

He reassigned Wei Qian! 

Recently, through the Taichang Trading House, the Li family had recruited two new tenant farmers. 

Elder Li Wanqing decided to have them take over Wei Qian's duties tending the spirit rice fields. 

Wei Qian was instead assigned to guard an orchard of spirit peach trees. 

Compared to farming, overseeing an orchard was a far better job. 

His monthly stipend also increased to three spirit stones. 

The peaches Wei Qian now tended were called "Jade Marrow Spirit Peaches," named for their jade-like flesh when ripe. 

The orchard contained twelve upper first-grade peach trees, thirty-six middle first-grade trees, and seventy-two lower first-grade trees. 

Wei Qian was responsible only for the seventy-two lower-grade trees. The remaining forty-eight were personally overseen by Elder Li Wanqing. 

The reason for Li Wanqing's close involvement was simple: profit. 

Each tree in the orchard was required to contribute two hundred catties of fruit to the clan's treasury annually. The rest belonged to Li Wanqing. 

In reality, Wei Qian learned that each tree yielded an average of two hundred and thirty catties per year. 

The surplus—three thousand six hundred catties of spirit peaches—became the private wealth of Li Wanqing's faction. 

This was worth thousands of spirit stones. No matter how much Li Wanqing trusted Wei Qian, he wouldn't entrust such wealth entirely to him. 

Thus, Wei Qian settled into life in the peach orchard, working there for two full years. 

In those two years, his cultivation advanced further, reaching the fourth level of Qi Refining. With his mid-grade spiritual roots, he continued diligent practice and soon sensed the bottleneck to the fifth level approaching. 

"At this rate, I'll reach the seventh level of Qi Refining before forty and the peak of Qi Refining before fifty." 

"That means at least one chance to attempt Foundation Establishment!" 

This progress greatly encouraged Wei Qian. 

Although Qi Refining cultivators could theoretically attempt Foundation Establishment even at a hundred years old—given their lifespan of one hundred twenty years—the truth was that after sixty, declining vitality made success increasingly unlikely. 

Moreover, it was widely accepted that only those who reached Foundation Establishment before sixty had any hope of advancing to Golden Core. 

"Elder Wanqing is fifty this year and just reached the ninth level of Qi Refining. By that measure, I'm progressing faster than him." 

Speak of the devil. 

Just as Wei Qian thought of Li Wanqing, a messenger arrived to summon him for a meeting. 

What could the elder want with him? For a moment, Wei Qian couldn't even guess.
