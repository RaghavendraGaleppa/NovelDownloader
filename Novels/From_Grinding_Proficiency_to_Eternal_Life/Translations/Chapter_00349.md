# Chapter 349: Spirit Condensation and Form Manifestation

“Trinity? What a grandiose title!”

In an instant, Xu Yunfan felt the space around him suddenly solidify, as if an invisible giant hand was squeezing in from all sides. The air twisted into visible ripples.

However, his expression remained unchanged, not even furrowing his brow.

Nine chains, condensed from the Great Zhou Dragon Veins, burst from the ground and coiled toward him like enraged pythons. Yet the moment they touched his skin, they melted away like snow meeting the blazing sun. As the Ten Extremes True Qi circulated, it devoured these earth vein essences entirely, turning them into nourishment for himself!

Simultaneously, the Thousand Mechanism Poison Mist scattered by Cinan enveloped him like a bone-gnawing parasite. The true qi poison, which would cause an ordinary martial artist to collapse upon contact, seemed laughably pathetic before Xu Yunfan.

Instead of avoiding it, he took a deep breath. The poison mist was sucked into his lungs like a whale drawing in water. After circulating once through his body, it was forcibly refined by the Ten Extremes True Qi and transformed into a wisp of turbid air slowly exhaled from his nostrils.

“Is that all you’ve got?”

The corner of Xu Yunfan’s mouth curled up, a hint of mockery flashing in his eyes.

The poison mist failed to harm him in the slightest; instead, after being refined by his true qi, it was converted into pure energy that nourished him!

Xu Yunfan’s laughter shook the banners around the arena, causing them to flutter violently.

The scene was so shocking that it caused the three monks—Kunan, E, and Nan—to hesitate imperceptibly.

Xu Yunfan reversed his grip and plunged the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace into the bluestone ground. With both palms pressing at his waist, two dark lights shot out like dragons leaving the sea.

They were the Mountain Stabilizing Ocean Hammer he had obtained from the bottom of the Sword Burial Abyss.

The moment the hammers appeared, the surrounding air stagnated. Faint sounds of ocean tides roaring and earth veins trembling seeped from the patterns on the hammers.

“That hammer!”

The Nine Luminaries Sect elder watching the battle crushed the armrest of his chair. He squinted, his eyes flashing with light.

He hadn't thought much of it before, but now, seeing the dark light emanating from the pair of heavy hammers, he naturally recalled it.

This hammer was a divine weapon carried by the sect master two generations prior to him in the Nine Luminaries Sect. It had been taken away by the Dao Sect as spoils of war at the time.

This pair of dark, heavy hammers was forged entirely from Profound冥 Cold Iron. The hammer faces were densely covered with natural patterns resembling waves, emitting a dark blue glow in the morning light.

Legend has it that each hammer weighs three hundred and sixty catties. When swung, it carries the momentum of a collapsing mountain, truly extraordinary. Even among seventh-grade divine weapons, it ranks at the very top. If nurtured properly, it might not be impossible to break through its quality, contain a spirit within, and achieve the status of an eighth-grade divine weapon.

In the next instant, just as Xu Yunfan raised his two hammers.

Ciku’s玄 Yin Soul-Slaying Blade had already劈 to within three inches of his face.

This blood-red long knife, inherited from the previous dynasty, now glowed with an eerie purple light. Where the blade passed, even light twisted.

“Here it comes!”

Xu Yunfan’s right hammer swept up from bottom to top. The wave patterns on the hammer face suddenly lit up like deep-sea fluorescence.

The opening stance of the hammer technique that accompanied the Mountain Stabilizing Ocean Hammer brought with it visible ripples of airwaves. The moment the hammer and blade collided, the floor tiles of the entire Black Tortoise Arena exploded simultaneously.

Spectators saw the purple-red blade light and the dark blue hammer shadow intertwine, erupting with a blinding polar light. Those within the Five Sects whose cultivation was insufficient immediately bled from their eyes.

“Pfft!”

Ciku’s withered and thin body flew backward like a broken kite. The Soul-Slaying Blade bent into a heart-stopping arc under the hammer strike.

The old monk crashed into the Black Tortoise stone carving at the edge of the arena, his kasaya fragments mixing with chunks of internal organs that splattered onto the face of an official from the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

The Abbot of the Mituo Temple only then realized with shock that the hammer force contained seven layers of superimposed shockwaves. The “Vajra Indestructible Body” he had cultivated for sixty years was as thin as a cicada’s wing before such brute force.

Ciene’s face twitched. He had clearly seen Xu Yunfan devour the locks formed from the Earth Dragon Qi like a whale just now. He didn't dare hesitate and slapped the镇 Dragon Seal into the ground again.

Cinan, seeing this, couldn't help but urgently say, “Are you giving him more supplements?!”

“What choice do I have? With the chains binding him, he was indeed momentarily restrained! This boy is a great demon!”

Ciene responded in a muffled voice, not daring to delay in the slightest, pushing his Vajra True Qi to its limit.

The Nine Palaces Earth Vein Array, which the Ministry of Works had buried overnight, was activated. Nine chains condensed from Earth Dragon Qi burst from the ground once more.

Xu Yunfan suddenly felt his feet sink into a mire. The circulation speed of the Ten Extremes True Qi in his body dropped sharply by thirty percent.

These chains were indeed much more solid than before and did affect his movement.

Cinan dared not be negligent. True Qi surged in his sleeves, exploding into a sky full of green mist. Using true qi as a catalyst, it seemed to pull out a cloud of mist, but it was much more condensed and agile than the previous casual scatter.

“Thousand Mechanism Powder!”

This strange object, taken by the Great Zhou Imperial Court from the southern frontier's bug poison, specifically corrodes true qi. It had once caused a ninth-grade Qi Refining supreme grandmaster to die with regret.

The poison mist touched Xu Yunfan’s Dragon Scale Armor, emitting a “sizzling” sound of metal corrosion. The protective spiritual light on the surface of the armor visibly dimmed.

A cold sneer had just appeared on the corner of the Great Zhou Ministry of Works official’s mouth on the high platform when he saw two golden lights suddenly light up within the poison mist.

That was the faint golden luster emanating from Xu Yunfan’s pupils!

“Petty side paths...”

He crossed the two hammers in front of his chest. The Ten Extremes True Qi poured into them frantically. A deep-sea巨兽-like hum came from within the Ocean Hammers, along with the interwoven tremors of an earth dragon turning over.

“Mountain Stabilizing Ocean · Whale Swallowing the World!”

The two hammers collided with a bang. The wave patterns on the hammer faces actually幻化出 the phantom of a giant whale shaking a mountain.

The terrifying sound wave spread out in a fan shape. The Thousand Mechanism Poison Mist was forcibly shaken apart and reorganized,倒卷 toward the three monks.

Cinan’s right hand, hastily forming a seal, was instantly covered in青紫色毒斑. The veins under the withered skin bulged like earthworms.

“Impossible!”

The Daoist in the blue robe from the Xuanzhen Sect cried out in shock.

He saw it clearly. Xu Yunfan’s move just now hadn't used true qi at all. He purely used the hammer technique to draw in the ambient spiritual energy, forming a hurricane eye.

This realm of returning to simplicity had already touched the threshold of “technique approaching the Dao”!

It was indeed so. From a high vantage point, with his current strength, practicing any martial art was extremely fast. Whether it was the Mountain Stabilizing Ocean Hammer or the Sky Piercing Cloud Arrow Technique, it took Xu Yunfan merely half a month to cultivate them to perfection using his attribute panel.

Cultivating lower-level martial arts from a higher realm, one could see through them at a glance, let alone with Xu Yunfan’s attribute panel.

At this time, Ciene took the opportunity to push the镇 Dragon Seal to its extreme.

Nine Earth Dragon Qi chains, like giant pythons, bound Xu Yunfan’s limbs. The luster shimmering on the chains became blindingly bright.

The people below the stage suddenly discovered that the clouds above the arena were being torn into a vortex shape by an invisible force.

It was actually a strange phenomenon caused by the forced extraction of earth vein spiritual energy!

Xu Yunfan let out a muffled groan. His muscles bulged all over. Red currents seeped out from the gaps in his Dragon Scale Armor.

Xu Yunfan’s left arm muscles suddenly tightened. The Mountain Stabilizing Ocean Hammer in his palm hummed and trembled, like a trapped deep-sea beast eager to break free.

He flicked his wrist, and the hammer shot out of his hand. In an instant, the Ten Extremes True Qi surged out from his skin like a raging tide, transforming into a layer of dark golden Gang Qi that enveloped the flying hammer.

The hammer shadow tore through the air. Wherever it passed, the air was forcibly torn open a turbid white air wave, like a巨舰 splitting the raging sea. The airflow on both sides twisted violently, emitting a sharp shriek that hurt the eardrums.
