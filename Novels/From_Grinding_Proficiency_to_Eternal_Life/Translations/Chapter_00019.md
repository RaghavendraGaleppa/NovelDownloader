# Chapter 19: Introduction to Hunting

Upon hearing this, Yang Gan was overjoyed and immediately knelt, bowing as he said, "I will not fail the General's command."

A sneer crossed Zhang Shuyang's face as he said coldly, "If you fail to bring it back, the military law will be enforced. Execution!"

Yang Gan felt a chill in his heart but had no choice but to grit his teeth and agree, "Yes!"

"Use the terrain and surrounding environment to conceal your movements. For example, you can approach your prey along the back of a slope, the bottom of a valley, or through dense forests, avoiding exposure in open areas."

"The tracks of different prey, including the shape, size, depth of the footprints, and the time they were left. By observing the direction and spacing of the tracks, you can determine the prey's walking speed and general direction."

As he spoke, Fang Mushan, who had been kneeling on the ground observing the tracks, stood up and exhaled. He looked at Xu Yunfan with a serious expression and nodded slightly.

Over the past few days, Xu Yunfan's learning ability had been incredibly strong, showing an ability to extrapolate from one instance to many. Fang Mushan even felt a bit of frustration.

Xu Yunfan nodded, glancing at a system notification that had popped up in his field of view.

*'You listened to Fang Mushan's explanation of hunting techniques. You have gained some insight into hunting, and it seems you have glimpsed the threshold of the skill.'*

Xu Yunfan said, "Shall we split up and try hunting?"

Fang Mushan nodded upon hearing this. "The 800-mile荒川冰原 (Barren River Ice Field), though it looks desolate and lonely at a glance, with its continuous snowy mountains, still has animals living underground. We have a better chance of getting prey if we split up."

That was what he said, but the 800-mile Barren River Ice Field was too desolate. Over the past few days, Fang Mushan had caught very little prey. The only significant haul was two snow hares.

Unfortunately, for the few of them who practiced martial arts, that wasn't even enough to fill the gaps between their teeth.

After parting ways with Fang Mushan, Xu Yunfan held a self-made bow in his hand. Although he didn't know the name of the tree, Fang Mushan had crafted it finely—it was hard yet flexible.

The bowstring was made from the tanned fibers of a plant called high-altitude willow.

*'You tracked an animal's footprints, preliminarily determining its direction of travel. Your hunting proficiency has increased.'*

"You..."

Xu Yunfan glanced at the several information prompts in his vision.

He naturally knew he was on the right path.

His gaze flickered constantly, not missing any detail in his surroundings.

The cold wind on the Barren River Ice Field howled past, carrying coarse sand that whipped against his face. His tattered clothes let in the wind everywhere, making him shiver.

Xu Yunfan rubbed his hands. With his "Flying Hair Leg" technique, his steps were agile and his figure nimble. He moved forward through the rugged mountain paths, his footsteps light and swift, not making a single unnecessary sound.

After nearly two hours, Xu Yunfan finally spotted a high-altitude goat resting near a brownish earth and stone that was so inconspicuous it almost blended into the surroundings.

To be precise, it was a highland岩羊 (rock goat) whose fur shimmered with a unique luster in the sunlight.

Despite being settled in its resting spot, its posture was robust and alert. Even while resting, its ears twitched slightly from time to time, as if it could sense danger at any moment and bolt away.

A surge of joy instantly welled up in Xu Yunfan's heart, and the fatigue from his long journey was quickly swept away as he faced his prey.

His hand slowly reached for the bow and arrow on his back, feeling the slight roughness of the fletching. Every nerve in his body tensed as he focused intently on the岩羊's every move.

This arrow was merely bound with a bit of fluff; it was made by Fang Mushan.

He carefully nocked the arrow and drew the bow. The plant-tanned bowstring, which was quite strong, was pulled back bit by bit, emitting a faint "creaking" sound.

As the muscles in his arms tensed and exerted force, the bow was drawn into a full moon shape, and the arrowhead steadily aimed at the岩羊's vital points.

Xu Yunfan's eyes sharpened, and his fingers suddenly released. The feathered arrow shot out like lightning with a "whoosh," carrying an unstoppable momentum as it tore through the air and pounced on the岩羊.

The岩羊 seemed to sense it and leaped up instantly, but it was still a step too slow. The arrowhead precisely pierced its neck, a spurt of blood gushing out. The岩羊 let out a mournful bleat, stumbled a few steps, and then collapsed to the ground with a thud.

Xu Yunfan hurriedly ran over, looking at the prey in his hands, his eyes filled with joy.

*'You successfully shot and killed a rock goat. You have gained new insights into the hunting skill, finding the bow in your hand increasingly handy. Your hunting skill has reached the入门 (Novice) level.'*

*'Hunting 0/500 (Novice)*
*Special Effects: Keen Eyesight and Hearing, Tracking Like a Wolf, Silent Footsteps, Basic Archery, Skilled at Luring and Trapping'*

In an instant, memories of him hunting in the mountains flooded his mind.

In these memories, he went into the mountains every day to find tracks, track prey, set traps, and practice archery.

At first, he returned empty-handed nine times out of ten. But through day after day of honing his skills and contemplating archery, he finally learned how to make luring traps, track prey, and hit his target five or six times out of ten shots.

Moreover, strands of faint, almost imperceptible heat flowed slowly within his body, but they quickly dissipated. Apart from making his body feel slightly swollen, there were no other abnormalities.

Xu Yunfan exhaled and understood in his heart that his physique had already reached a very high level. For a common skill like hunting, the physical enhancement was extremely limited.

But now, with his hunting techniques...

Xu Yunfan looked up. Before him, an endless expanse of white stretched to the horizon. The mountain ridges were covered thickly with ice and snow, without a trace of green.

A fierce wind howled across the ice field, carrying bone-chilling cold and letting out sharp whistles.

The surrounding mountains rose and fell. Below the ridges, there was nothing but desolate, yellowish scrubland and grass, without even a single branch. The mountains were filled with jagged rocks, eroded by ice and snow into a myriad of holes, standing starkly in this desolate land.

For the past few days, the sky had been overcast, with heavy, leaden clouds pressing down, adding to the oppressive feeling of this cold and desolate ice field.

But now, even if he were alone, he should be able to survive in this desolate land.

The fur of this岩羊 could be tanned into clothes to keep out the cold.

Xu Yunfan hoisted the岩羊, which weighed a good 150 pounds, onto his shoulder. With light steps, he quickly returned to a temporary dwelling in a mountain hollow in just over half an hour.

Li Haomiao asked in shock, "You caught this?"

"That's right."

"Impossible."

Xu Yunfan lifted the岩羊 slightly. "This is a fact."

"..."

Li Haomiao felt a pang in his heart. He recalled that back when he hunted in the imperial mountain forest, he had single-handedly taken down a fierce tiger and could easily kill a fierce bear. However, he had never completed a proper hunt; most of the time, he had relied on his superb martial arts skills.

Then, under Li Haomiao's surprised gaze, Xu Yunfan skillfully used the fragments of the Purple Gold Earth-Shaking Hammer to skin and disembowel the岩羊.

He looked extremely proficient.

"Where did you learn this technique?"

"Fang Mushan taught me."

Li Haomiao looked utterly unconvinced. "With this technique, I wouldn't believe it unless you've skinned a hundred sheep."

"Believe what you want."

Without even looking up, Xu Yunfan focused on processing the岩羊's carcass.
