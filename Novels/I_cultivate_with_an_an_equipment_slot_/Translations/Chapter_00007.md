# Chapter 7: Spells and Divine Abilities  

"Excellent! To master divine abilities, you must first cultivate your spells to perfection during the Qi Refining stage!"  

"Our Qingheng Sect's sect leader mastered three spells to perfection before reaching Foundation Establishment! After establishing his foundation, he was virtually unmatched among his peers!"  

Mu Sen's smile widened as he observed the stunned expressions of the disciples.  

"Three spells perfected?!"  
"That's incredible!"  

The disciples' eyes widened in awe.  

This was truly remarkable!  

Perfecting three spells!  

Some of them were senior disciples, not newcomers, and they understood all too well how difficult it was to perfect even a single spell, let alone three.  

"Three perfected spells!"  

"If only I could find magical artifacts with perfected spells..." Zhang Yan's eyes burned with fervor.  

Perfecting spells was crucial for him.  

Moreover, thanks to his Equipment Bar, his path to achieving this might be easier than for others.  

"Before reaching Foundation Establishment, I must master at least one spell!"  

With this thought, his resolve hardened.  

"Mastering spells is no easy feat. Just keep this in mind—whether it's Foundation Establishment or perfecting spells, both are still far beyond your current reach." Seeing the disciples' enthusiasm, Mu Sen nodded slightly before continuing his lecture.  

It had to be said—Mu Sen was truly skilled.  

As expected of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Under his guidance, even the most tedious spells became fascinating, captivating the disciples for hours.  

Before they knew it, two hours had passed.  

"Today's lesson ends here. If you're interested in the Wood Element Technique, you may return in seven days." As Mu Sen concluded, the disciples quickly rose from their meditation cushions and bowed deeply in gratitude.  

The gift of knowledge was invaluable.  

After paying their respects, the disciples swiftly departed.  

Zhang Yan, however, hesitated for a moment before approaching Mu Sen.  

"Do you have a question?" Though a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Mu Sen was amiable toward his disciples.  

"Teacher, I noticed these meditation cushions seem to enhance comprehension. May I purchase one?" Zhang Yan asked respectfully.  

"Oh?"  

"You sensed that?"  

Mu Sen looked surprised.  

While the cushions did indeed have a slight effect on enhancing comprehension, it was negligible at best.  

If an ordinary person's comprehension was rated at 100, the cushion's effect would only add 1—practically imperceptible.  

Only those with extraordinary talent could benefit from it.  

Ordinary people wouldn't even notice.  

"If you could sense it, your comprehension must be quite good. Very well, these cushions cost ten contribution points each." Normally, these cushions weren't for sale.  

But since Zhang Yan had noticed their effect, Mu Sen assumed his comprehension was above average.  

In that case, exceptions could be made.  

In this world, rules often bent for talent and strength.  

"Thank you, Teacher!" Zhang Yan immediately transferred ten contribution points.  

Without hesitation, he then approached a young female disciple.  

"Apologies, fellow disciple, but I've purchased this cushion."  

"......"  

Zhang Yan's words left not only the girl but even Mu Sen momentarily speechless.  

Mu Sen now strongly suspected that this disciple's so-called interest in the cushion was merely an excuse to strike up a conversation with the girl.  

"You!"  

The girl's face flushed slightly.  

"There are so many cushions here—why must you take this one?"  

"No!"  

Zhang Yan refused without hesitation.  

Nonsense!  

He, Zhang Yan, was not someone who acted recklessly!  

He wanted this specific cushion.  

None of the others had the effect of a perfected Wood Element Technique!  

"You!"  

The girl's face turned even redder.  

With no other choice, she stood up in frustration and handed the cushion to him.  

"Thank you."  

As Zhang Yan took the cushion, he felt a lingering warmth—clearly, the girl's body heat.  

By now, her face was practically crimson.  

But Zhang Yan paid no heed.  

He simply snatched the cushion and stored it in his spatial pouch before leaving, satisfied.  

......  

"What a shameless rogue!"  

Watching Zhang Yan's retreating figure, the girl stomped her foot lightly, her voice a mix of anger and embarrassment.  

......  

Zhang Yan, of course, remained oblivious to her thoughts.  

Now that he had obtained the cushion, he eagerly returned to inspect it.  

Perhaps because of his fruitful gains, he headed straight back to the Spirit Herb Garden.  

Since it was still early, Senior Brother Lin hadn't returned yet, so Zhang Yan retreated to his room.  

He laid out his acquisitions—a pill furnace and the meditation cushion.  

"First, let's try the Wood Element Pill Furnace."  

Of the two, the pill furnace was his priority.  

This thing was a money-making treasure!  

Without hesitation, he equipped the Wood Element Pill Furnace.  

Instantly, the furnace vanished.  

In its place, streams of information flooded his mind.  

"So this is alchemy... this is flame control!"  

Zhang Yan sighed in amazement.  

"Wait—"  

"Something's not right!"  

Suddenly, Zhang Yan realized something unusual.  

He had equipped the Wood Element Pill Furnace, but the Jade Slip of Techniques hadn't been unequipped!  

Closing his eyes, he saw two equipment slots in his mind.  

"What's going on?"  

"An extra equipment slot!"  

Zhang Yan's eyes widened.  

Originally, he had only one equipment slot—but now there were two!  

"Did this happen because I reached Qi Refining?"  

After some thought, aside from his increased cultivation, nothing else had changed.  

"It seems the number of equipment slots isn't fixed—they can be unlocked progressively!"  

"If that's the case, my options have expanded significantly."  

This discovery delighted him.  

With two equipment slots, the combined effect wasn't simply additive—it was multiplicative.  

For example, the Jade Slip of Techniques granted minor mastery of the Evergreen Art, while the meditation cushion slightly enhanced comprehension.  

Equipping both would allow him to comprehend the Evergreen Art faster, enabling him to master it naturally even after unequipping the items.  

There were other possible combinations, but unfortunately, his current equipment was still limited.  

With more items, the possibilities would multiply.  

"I need to earn more spirit stones to buy magical artifacts—that way, I'll have more options."  

"Also, my cultivation is still too low. I must accelerate my progress."  

With this in mind, he wasted no time and began meditating.
