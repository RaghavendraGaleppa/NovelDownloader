# Chapter 220: The Final Strike  

Li Yuanba refused to be provoked by Jueyuan Buddha. He continuously used sword light division to retreat beyond the range of the white lotus while relentlessly attacking Jueyuan Buddha with his Swift Wind Golden Light Sword.  

However, Jueyuan Buddha's figure flickered unpredictably, making it impossible for Li Yuanba's flying sword to land a hit. Every strike merely passed through an illusory afterimage.  

This was the most formidable opponent Li Yuanba had ever faced—his swordsman techniques had no effect on him.  

Of course, the main issue was the gap in their cultivation realms, which left Li Yuanba at a disadvantage in every aspect.  

Had they been on equal footing, it would have been difficult to say who would have the upper hand.  

With no other choice, Li Yuanba divided his sword light once more. Originally, he had split it into two—one for sword evasion and the other for offense. Now, he further divided it into ten sword lights, with nine focused on attacking.  

This was actually borrowed from his main body, Li Shiming's technique. The nine sword lights were equivalent to nine flying swords, though their power was significantly weaker. Moreover, only one of them was a physical entity, and the Swift Wind Golden Light Sword wasn't designed for formations, so it only mimicked the form.  

Since Li Shiming had deeply researched the manipulation of nine flying swords, Li Yuanba could still unleash considerable power with the nine sword lights when necessary.  

The nine sword lights darted like fish within a thirty to one-hundred-meter radius in front of him. Though seemingly aimless, they concealed the principles of formation arrays.  

While the nine sword lights couldn't form a powerful formation, they were still energy constructs imbued with spiritual power, allowing them to create a rudimentary array.  

Additionally, as the battle progressed, Li Shiming provided assistance by leveraging their shared consciousness to tap into IBMz15's computational power, granting Li Yuanba the ability to set up formations mid-battle.  

This was only possible because Li Shiming's spiritual power had greatly improved, allowing him to form divine sense. As the intermediary, his connection with IBMz15 no longer suffered from delays.  

Previously, Li Shiming's spiritual power had been insufficient. By the time IBMz15 processed the data and relayed it back to Li Yuanba through him, there would have been at least a one-breath delay—rendering it useless in battle.  

The formation created by the nine sword lights was simple—a Soul Confusion Array.  

This array didn't affect the soul directly but instead generated illusions to disorient those within it.  

Li Yuanba wasn't sure how effective it would be against Jueyuan Buddha, but he had to try. At this point, he had few means to counter him.  

Jueyuan Buddha used Buddhist secret techniques to move rapidly, leaving Li Yuanba with little time to think. His movements were almost instinctive.  

Under normal circumstances, Jueyuan Buddha wouldn't have been affected by such a minor Soul Confusion Array. But when relying on instinct, his brain only made judgments based on the immediate environment.  

Soon, Jueyuan Buddha's movements became orderly within the array, still incredibly fast—so fast that the process of movement seemed negligible. His figure flickered continuously atop the white lotus.  

However, due to the array's influence, his movements followed its guidance, giving Li Yuanba the chance to predict his trajectory.  

Within two breaths, Jueyuan Buddha sensed something amiss. Just as he was about to react, Li Yuanba's counterattack arrived.  

The nine sword lights suddenly merged, along with the one beneath Li Yuanba's feet, forming a single strike aimed at an empty spot above a white lotus.  

At the very moment the sword light approached, Jueyuan Buddha's figure materialized there.  

The strike bypassed the bronze bell in front of Jueyuan Buddha. His rapid movements prevented him from utilizing the bell's full defensive power—merely maintaining its use at such speeds was already a feat.  

Most cultivators had to choose between extreme speed and defensive artifacts; excelling in both was impossible.  

The bronze bell had been refined by Jueyuan Buddha through secret techniques, forging a deep connection that allowed him to use it even at high speeds. However, he could only position it in front of him, leaving the rest of his body exposed.  

A tearing sound echoed as Li Yuanba's sword light slashed across Jueyuan Buddha's body, leaving a foot-long wound.  

The wound was long but not fatal, as it wasn't deep.  

Li Yuanba's expression darkened. Jueyuan Buddha's physical cultivation had reached late-stage Foundation Building, far surpassing his own realm.  

This suggested that Jueyuan Buddha had either consumed treasures like Monkey Wine or absorbed the relics of a high-ranking Buddhist master to accelerate his physical refinement.  

Only Li Yuanba's sword intent allowed him to breach Jueyuan Buddha's defenses and inflict damage.  

His final strike hadn't been executed at full power, resulting in only a minor injury.  

"An excellent opponent! That wasn't a swordsman's technique just now!" Jueyuan Buddha wasn't angered by the injury. Instead, he laughed heartily.  

Such an adversary was rare. Even among his peers in Qianye Temple, few could challenge him. Among late-stage Foundation Building Buddhas, only a handful could match him in a full-fledged battle.  

The flesh around Jueyuan Buddha's wound twisted and tightened, concealing the injury.  

This didn't mean he had healed—it was merely his physical cultivation technique forcibly sealing the wound.  

The injury itself was trivial, but the sword intent within it posed a problem. He needed to expel it with his spiritual power.  

But Li Yuanba wouldn't give him the chance. His sword light shot toward Jueyuan Buddha once more.  

With a loud shout, Jueyuan Buddha activated his bronze bell, enveloping himself in its protective glow.  

He seemed intent on expelling the sword intent before making his next move.  

Li Yuanba wouldn't let this opportunity slip. His sword light flickered, transforming into razor-thin threads that slithered across the bronze bell, eroding its spiritual imprint.  

He believed that no imprint, no matter how resilient, could withstand repeated sword intent attacks.  

Now, it was a contest—would Li Yuanba erase the bell's imprint first, or would Jueyuan Buddha purge the sword intent?  

The two stood about one hundred and fifty meters apart, locked in a stalemate.  

The bronze bell completely obscured Jueyuan Buddha, and its ability to block spiritual sense prevented Li Yuanba from sensing his condition inside.  

In truth, Jueyuan Buddha wasn't healing. He knew that without drastic measures, he couldn't kill Li Yuanba.  

Even now, Jueyuan Buddha remained confident in his ability to defeat Li Yuanba—his goal was to kill him, not merely win.  

The more impressive Li Yuanba's combat prowess, the more determined Jueyuan Buddha became to eliminate him.  

Such terrifying talent, if allowed to grow, would become a major threat to the righteous path—much like Sword Elder of the Senluo Sect, a looming menace at the Golden Core stage.  

As a true disciple, Jueyuan Buddha had a broad perspective. The current large-scale battle between Foundation Building cultivators was part of a grand scheme. If successful, the Senluo Sect would suffer devastating losses in this generation of cultivators.  

Without a cohort of Foundation Building cultivators, the Senluo Sect's strength would plummet for decades, requiring forty to fifty years to recover.  

Only a select few true disciples in Qianye Temple knew of this plan to decimate the Senluo Sect's Foundation Building cultivators.  

Using secret techniques to suppress his injury, Jueyuan Buddha identified Li Yuanba's weakness.  

From the start of the battle, Li Yuanba had continuously retreated, trying to widen the distance.  

This was standard for swordsmen, including Sword Elder—they avoided close combat, preferring to strike from a distance with flying swords and sword intent.  

Modern swordsmen relied on flying swords rather than melee combat, making them weaker at close range.  

Thus, Jueyuan Buddha suppressed his injury and immediately activated a secret technique.  

Teleporting one hundred and fifty meters to Li Yuanba's side required preparation—so much so that he was willing to sacrifice his only artifact, the bronze bell.  

The reason Jueyuan Buddha's bell could resist sword intent was because it was his sole artifact. Since becoming a Buddha, he had continuously deepened his connection with it through secret techniques, enhancing its resistance.  

The bell was a versatile artifact, capable of both offense and defense, making it sufficient for all his needs.  

One breath, two breaths, three breaths—outside, the sword light relentlessly assailed the bell with sword intent. Jueyuan Buddha could feel his connection weakening.  

No matter how much he reinforced its resistance, it couldn't completely negate sword intent.  

Swordsmen survived through sheer offense. If there were a way to fully counter their sword intent, they wouldn't be universally recognized as the pinnacle of combat in the cultivation world.  

"Enough time has passed!" Jueyuan Buddha thought, sensing the bell's imprint fading.  

Li Yuanba was shocked. He hadn't expected an artifact to withstand so many sword intent attacks.  

If Jueyuan Buddha were a Golden Core cultivator wielding a magic treasure, it would make sense. But as a mid-stage Foundation Building Buddha, his artifact's resilience was astounding.  

Combined with his speed, Jueyuan Buddha was nearly invincible.  

Still, through his flying sword, Li Yuanba sensed the bell wouldn't last much longer. His sword light rained down on it like a storm.  

Inside the bell, Jueyuan Buddha's eyes snapped open, glowing with lotus-like radiance.  

He relinquished control of the bell—his next move required leaving it behind.  

Behind Li Yuanba, a white lotus bloomed without warning. Simultaneously, Jueyuan Buddha vanished from the bell and reappeared above the lotus.  

With a pre-prepared secret technique, his hand transformed into a golden palm strike aimed at Li Yuanba's back.  

This was a move Jueyuan Buddha had mastered—many demonic cultivators had fallen to it.  

He was confident that even without his artifact, this strike would kill Li Yuanba.  

But the moment the golden palm descended, Li Yuanba sidestepped as if he had anticipated the attack.  

From the beginning, Li Yuanba had set a trap. After their initial exchanges, he realized conventional methods couldn't kill Jueyuan Buddha.  

Even if he summoned Jiang Chen, Jueyuan Buddha could escape using his unimaginable movement technique.  

Thus, Li Yuanba played the part of a standard swordsman—constantly retreating to maintain distance, avoiding close combat.  

All the while, he waited for Jueyuan Buddha to close the gap.  

Though the "Sword Demon Codex" wasn't the most powerful technique, its close-combat prowess was unmatched before the Golden Core stage.  

As an alternative swordsmanship lineage, it provided comprehensive Foundation Building techniques, allowing Li Yuanba to fight at close range effectively.  

Jueyuan Buddha might excel in physical cultivation and possess close-combat techniques, but even if they were on par, Li Yuanba had the advantage of preparation.  

In close combat, the slightest misstep decided the battle.  

Dodging the golden palm strike, Li Yuanba pivoted and thrust his hand forward like a sword. As he did, a third-grade sword foundation materialized in his grip.  

Thanks to his physical cultivation, the sword foundation had reached the pinnacle of artifact quality, surpassing all others.  

Its third-grade metallic nature ensured this—after all, the "Sword Demon Codex" was designed to nurture a Golden Core-stage sword.  

The thrust was the fastest attack at such close range.  

Jueyuan Buddha never expected Li Yuanba to conceal close-combat abilities—let alone at late-stage Foundation Building proficiency.  

After consecutive secret techniques, he had no strength left to evade. He could only hope his physical cultivation would withstand the strike.  

The third-grade sword foundation, infused with sword intent, pierced Jueyuan Buddha's forehead like light.  

To avoid a counterattack, Li Yuanba released the hilt and retreated immediately.  

The sword foundation dissolved into energy, returning to his body.  

A clean hole remained in Jueyuan Buddha's forehead. He sat cross-legged, serene as a statue, his life force extinguished.  

Li Yuanba shook his head at the sight. Such an opponent was terrifying—had he not planned ahead, he might not have even been able to keep Jiang Chen a secret.
