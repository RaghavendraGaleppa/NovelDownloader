# Chapter 85: The Selection  

"Uncle Cheng thinks highly of you. Why not stay at Xun Peak? Though as a junior spiritual planter, you won't be of much use in Xun Peak's spiritual fields—you'd only be doing odd jobs there," Zhuji chattered as they flew toward the Central Peak's Affairs Hall.  

Through their conversation, Li Shiming learned that none of the nine peaks had any spare low-grade spiritual fields left.  

Beneath the nine peaks of the sect lay the main spiritual vein—the area with the densest spiritual energy. The Central Peak was the richest, followed by the other eight peaks.  

Within the range of the main spiritual vein, the abundant spiritual energy supported higher-quality spiritual fields. After countless years of development, all the fields across the nine peaks had reached mid-grade status.  

The "Spring Rain Technique" that junior spiritual planters like Li Shiming could use was only suitable for low-grade spiritual fields, which were scattered across the sea beyond the nine peaks, dotting the islands.  

"This is the Affairs Hall. I won't accompany you further," Zhuji said, pointing to the hall below.  

"Thank you, Brother Zhu," Li Shiming said with a bow.  

The paper crane descended in front of the hall, which was quiet and nearly empty.  

The Affairs Hall handled sect assets, so business was usually slow. Only one Qi Refinement cultivator was present inside.  

"Greetings, Senior Brother. I'm here to rent a spiritual field and cave dwelling," Li Shiming said, stepping forward and offering ten spirit stones.  

Given his status, addressing anyone with the mark of a formal disciple as "Senior Brother" was the safest bet.  

"Identity jade slip. The green markers on the map indicate available spiritual fields and cave dwellings," the senior brother replied matter-of-factly, pocketing the spirit stones with practiced ease.  

A three-dimensional holographic map appeared before Li Shiming.  

As expected, none of the nine peaks had green markers. However, beyond them, scattered across the islands, many green dots indicated available locations.  

"So many choices?" Li Shiming couldn't help but exclaim.  

"Spiritual planters have always been rare. These fields were all developed but are currently unclaimed and forcibly sealed. If you're looking for a recommendation, there's Changming Island—home to 300,000 mortals. Life there wouldn't be too hard, with plenty of servants at your disposal. Your only duty would be to drive away any sea beasts that appear," the senior brother suggested, having accepted the bribe.  

"How common are sea beasts? And how strong?" Li Shiming asked, concerned.  

"Powerful sea beasts don't appear in sect waters, but there are plenty of weaker ones—mostly at the early Qi Refinement stage. Don't worry about safety. If you encounter something you can't handle, activating your identity jade slip will summon nearby sect members quickly," the senior brother assured him.  

---  

Li Shiming's gaze didn't linger on Changming Island. Since he had chosen the path of cultivation, he wanted to stay far from mortal affairs.  

He preferred a quiet, undisturbed place.  

His eyes settled on a small island called Eagle Beak Island, about two hundred li from the nine peaks. At that distance, even if he activated his jade slip's distress signal, sect members from the main peaks could reach him swiftly.  

Most importantly, Eagle Beak Island had no mortal inhabitants—just five mu of low-grade spiritual fields.  

Five mu was manageable for a junior spiritual planter like him at the third level of Qi Refinement.  

"Senior Brother, I choose Eagle Beak Island," Li Shiming declared without hesitation.  

"Eagle Beak Island?" The senior brother hesitated before advising, "The island's secondary spiritual vein is a branch of the sect's main vein, but its quality is poor. The fields are also low-grade. Its only advantage is affordability. Are you sure?"  

"I've made up my mind," Li Shiming confirmed with a nod.  

"Very well. I'll add the permissions to your jade slip. With it, you can activate the island's defensive formation and unseal the fields. Given the low-grade fields and the climate, you can only cultivate for six months a year—three growing seasons." The senior brother did some quick calculations. "At a yield of 100 jin of spirit rice per mu, you'll need to submit 750 jin annually, earning 325 merit points."  

He gave Li Shiming a complicated look before handing over the jade slip once the latter acknowledged the terms.  

Only then did Li Shiming realize how low the yield was for low-grade fields. His 280-square-meter machine room space alone could produce 364 jin per season.  

Paying 750 jin annually would be effortless. Renting the fields counted as a sect mission—once he met the quota, he wouldn't have to take on additional tasks unless the sect mandated them.  

The merit points were modest, but still better than what non-specialized cultivators earned.  

Leaving the Affairs Hall, he summoned his paper crane for the long flight ahead.  

The sea breeze brushed his face as he soared through the sky—though the experience was slightly diminished by the fact that his "crane" was made of paper.  

The flight took a little over an hour to cover two hundred li.  

At first glance, Eagle Beak Island made Li Shiming wonder if it was even habitable.  

The map had made it seem small, but in reality, it was tiny.  

---  

The island was shaped like an eagle's beak—narrow at one end and wider at the other. The base was no more than two hundred meters across, with a fifty-meter hill at its root. Between the base and the tip lay a flat area where the spiritual fields were located.  

Surrounding rocks acted as natural barriers, keeping ordinary sea beasts from wandering into the fields.  

Using his jade slip, Li Shiming activated the defensive formation and stepped onto the island.  

The five mu of fields were sealed by a formation that preserved their spiritual energy, though it would gradually dissipate over time.  

A spiritual planter needed to periodically use the "Earth Spirit Technique" to draw energy from the ground and replenish the fields.  

Even so, this only maintained the fields' foundation. Over time, their quality would slowly degrade.  

These five mu were already at the lowest tier of low-grade spiritual fields—barely qualifying as cultivable.  

Li Shiming didn't unseal them immediately. First, he needed to clean up the cave dwelling and settle in before tending to the fields.  

The cave was carved into the hill at the edge of the fields.  

Using his jade slip again, he opened the cave's restrictions—only to be hit by a wave of damp, rotting stench that made him recoil.  

He put on a respirator, used telekinesis to clear out the debris, and refreshed the air inside before the foul odor finally dissipated.
