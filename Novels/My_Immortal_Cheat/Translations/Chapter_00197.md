Chapter 197: Not on the Same Side!

Zhou Tian walked up to an ordinary residence. The door was dark red, the color of dried blood. He could clearly hear eerie sounds emanating from behind the massive, blood-red door.

With a sense of confidence, Zhou Tian stepped forward and pushed the door open. It creaked, revealing a crack.

Instantly, a foul, pungent wind swept out. Zhou Tian's expression changed. He crossed his arms, and golden light flickered on his forearms. *Bang!* A powerful force struck him. Strangely, however, Zhou Tian was not sent flying backward; instead, he was flung *into* the residence.

The courtyard was equally dilapidated. In front of Zhou Tian floated a figure—no, not a figure... Zhou Tian's pupils constricted, for it was clearly a human skin husk, with only a few withered strands of long hair on its scalp. Its eye sockets were two dark, hollow holes, yet Zhou Tian felt this skin husk staring at him.

"What the hell is this thing?"

Zhou Tian's scalp tingled, and goosebumps rose all over him.

"Hiss!"

The skin husk let out an eerie hiss. Its figure seemed to be blown by the wind, twisting and deforming. The skin husk lunged forward, dark light emanating from its fingers and palms. Though it was mere skin, it felt more powerful than a solid entity.

Zhou Tian dodged to the side. The skin husk's fingers and palms grazed past him, bringing with them a wave of foul stench. Yet, Zhou Tian smiled, for he discovered that this skin husk was far less formidable than he had estimated.

He had initially thought the skin husk would utterly crush him, and he had even prepared to use [Teleport]. But he found that the skin husk's strength was, at best, not much different from his own.

He had jumped to conclusions. Although this was Wutian's Nether City, and Wutian was extremely powerful in ancient times, countless years had passed since his demise. No matter how strong the creatures in this city once were, time had eroded their power, making them far weaker than before, let alone these mutated entities.

"Then I'm going to play you to death!"

Zhou Tian chuckled. He lightly tapped his foot, his fist like a great dragon, imbued with Buddhist light, and he slammed it forward.

Dark patterns surfaced on the skin husk's withered skin, and it let out a shrill roar.

*Bang!*

The skin husk flew backward, golden light still lingering on its chest, as if scorching its body.

The skin husk let out a terrible shriek, as if perplexed. Its own dark-light fist had also struck Zhou Tian's chest just now, but Zhou Tian was completely unharmed, as if he hadn't taken any damage.

Zhou Tian's knuckles cracked as he clenched his fist. He grinned, "Do you know what it means to be a cheat?"

*Boom!*

He lunged forward again, relying on his [Attack Immunity] skill to disregard the skin husk's attacks.

"Pagoda Palm!" Zhou Tian roared. His right hand transformed into a dazzling, crystalline Buddhist palm. However, this was incomparable to the attack he could unleash at the Dao Lord realm, especially when amplified by [Attack Amplification].

The Buddhist palm, only a zhang (approx. 3.3 meters) wide, descended with unparalleled suppressing power towards the skin husk.

Meanwhile, a scorching fireball appeared in his left hand—this was the [Blazing Detonation] skill—which he also slammed fiercely onto the skin husk alongside the Pagoda Palm.

*Boom!*

The ground here was incredibly sturdy. The skin husk was slammed into the earth. Despite its remarkably tough skin and the black patterns augmenting it, several large, charred holes appeared on its body, with golden light still burning.

"Satisfying!"

After unleashing this combo, Zhou Tian felt exhilarated. This was the skill combination he truly desired.

The skin husk floated up from the ground once more. The black patterns on its body became even more pronounced. Zhou Tian frowned, trying to discern them; they seemed to be patterns resembling writing.

"Hiss!"

The skin husk hissed again.

Zhou Tian, however, just laughed. "Go on, scream! Scream all you want! Even if you scream until your throat breaks, no one will come...!"

*Whoosh!*

A sound of something tearing through the air came. Zhou Tian's pupils suddenly constricted. He wanted to forcibly shift his body or use his [Teleport] skill, but it was already too late.

A sharp pain shot through his heart. A pillar of blood, crimson and jet-black, erupted from his body—it wasn't his own blood.

Zhou Tian sharply turned his head, only to see a tiny tributary flowing down from the Blood River in the sky, precisely the pillar of blood that had pierced through his shoulder.

"What the fu—" Zhou Tian cursed aloud. This was simply too shameless! Was this how they played the game?

However, this was only the beginning.

"Roar!"

A furious roar echoed. The skin husk's entire body erupted in a bloody glow. The large holes in its skin were repaired, and its whole body swelled up as if inflated. Bloody light flickered in its eye sockets.

An unimaginable aura burst forth. After being engorged with blood, this skin husk was more than just one level stronger than before. A majestic power permeated the air.

Zhou Tian didn't know what expression he should wear. Feeling the sharp pain in his heart, he was now a powerhouse at the Incarnation Realm. Even with his heart pierced, he wouldn't die immediately, using his spiritual energy to sustain his life.

The blood from the Blood River was clearly not ordinary blood either, containing extremely evil power. His wound had already begun to rot.

"I thought I wouldn't need this move..." Zhou Tian gave a helpless smile. His body erupted in light, cracks extending, and he charged towards the skin husk.

*Boom!*

A violent explosion occurred, energy annihilating, releasing immense power.

Within the dust, the skin husk was completely unharmed, enveloped in a bloody glow, not even swaying.

Then, Zhou Tian revived. Without hesitation, he instantly teleported out of the residence.

Immediately after, the red door exploded, and the blood-engorged skin husk burst out.

Zhou Tian was about to use [Teleport] again to escape the area. He had been severely wounded just now, and it would have been better to just "die" and fully recover his state. But now, there was no need to waste revival chances here; this place was too strange, and he needed to save them for emergencies.

However, suddenly, a skeleton warrior clad in tattered armor rushed out from the side, raising its blade and fiercely hacking at the blood-engorged skin husk.

Both were sent flying backward simultaneously.

"Hmm?"

This sudden development made Zhou Tian temporarily abandon his plan to leave. These two creatures from the Nether City were actually fighting each other.

The skeleton warrior got up, brandishing its blade. With each step it took, the dark light on its body grew denser. Zhou Tian had seen this before; this was the ancient city itself augmenting these skeleton warriors.

The huge gash on the blood-engorged skin husk's body also healed within the bloody glow. Another pillar of blood split from the Blood River high in the sky and entered the skin husk's body, making its aura even stronger.

*Swish!*

The skeleton warrior swung its blade. Although it was a skeleton, it moved like a master of the blade, its saber aura tearing towards the sky.

The blood-engorged skin husk swelled up another notch, its skin absorbing the blood and becoming lustrous, with a bloody glow soaring skyward.

The two creatures clashed. The bloody glow from the Blood River and the demonic light emanating from the Nether City met, causing continuous roars. It was like fire and water, erupting in thunder-like explosions.

Then, death energy soared into the sky, and blood light obscured the sun. The two creatures fought as if no one else were present, as if they didn't even see Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian looked at the Blood River in the sky, then at the ancient city beneath his feet. A thought suddenly popped into his mind.

"These bastards aren't on the same side!"
