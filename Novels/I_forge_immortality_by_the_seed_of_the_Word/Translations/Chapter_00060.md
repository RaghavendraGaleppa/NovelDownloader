# Chapter 60: Enlightenment and the Five Treasures Spirit River  

At Xu hour (8 PM), Zhang Jing calculated the time. Less than thirteen hours remained until the trading session began.  

Without hesitation, he closed the doors of his shop and went upstairs to the talisman-making chamber.  

Of course, Zhang Jing was extremely interested in this so-called "trading session." However, he knew his own circumstances all too well. Apart from a batch of demon cores, he currently possessed no other valuable items.  

Moreover, due to the price reductions at other talisman shops, fewer people were coming to purchase talismans from him using Dao merits. As a result, he only had a few hundred Dao merits left.  

The lower-grade talismans he had on hand were reserved for exchanging demon cores, so he couldn't recklessly use them.  

But demon cores likely weren't considered rare items in the eyes of the senior disciples participating in the trading session—  

Wait!  

A sudden realization struck him.  

His demon cores had been purified of demonic remnants, which should give them some value, right?  

At the very least, alchemists would probably find them quite appealing.  

Still, that wasn't enough.  

As thoughts raced through his mind, Zhang Jing's hands moved without pause. He spread out spirit paper, took out spirit ink, and began deftly drawing the intricate and profound Dao patterns of a mid-grade talisman with his spirit brush.  

At a trading session of this level, lower-grade talismans wouldn't be worth much unless offered in bulk.  

Thanks to his Source Talisman, Zhang Jing had already printed over two hundred lower-grade talismans during his spare time, so quantity wasn't an issue.  

Unlike lower-grade talismans, mid-grade talismans were always a valuable resource—especially since the ones he crafted were of superior quality.  

To be safe, he decided to use the remaining time to make more.  

After all, the more resources he had, the greater his chances of obtaining coveted treasures at the "internal trading session."  

Speaking of resources, Zhang Jing immediately thought of the two fifty-year-old Mistroot Water Ginseng plants he had acquired from Pei Xiaoshuang earlier that day.  

After a moment's consideration, he decided to focus on cultivation first.  

Sharpening the axe wouldn't delay the cutting of firewood.  

With improved cultivation, talisman-making would become easier.  

He glanced at the jade slip.  

**[Five Organs Water Origin Method · Level 3 (787/800)]**  
Skill Trait: Five Elements Spirit River (Intermediate)  

The Five Organs Water Origin Method, which he had been eagerly anticipating, was on the verge of leveling up.  

Spiritual light shimmered in the room.  

The illusory great river within his organs surged violently under the influence of the pure water-attribute spiritual energy from the Mistroot Water Ginseng.  

---  

At a certain moment, as if touched by divine inspiration, Zhang Jing suddenly recalled the vast, winding black river he had seen earlier that day and the vibrant life it nurtured along its banks.  

A trace of confusion arose in his heart.  

Both rivers were turbulent and mighty, yet why did they evoke such different feelings in him?  

What exactly was water?  

This was the first time Zhang Jing had seriously pondered this question.  

Countless thoughts emerged in his mind, yet the crimson divine light enveloping his body showed no signs of dissipating—instead, it grew even brighter.  

Unnoticed by him, the Heart Eye Dao Seed trembled faintly, its radiance filling the entire sea of consciousness.  

Ancient scriptures from his past life, buried deep in his memory, seemed to coalesce into a great book that slowly unfolded before his eyes.  

Water embodies the principle of balance—stillness. It also embodies the principle of flow—motion. Motion and stillness, yang and yin, the union of opposites is water.  

Water flows downward, residing in the lowest place, nurturing all things from the beginning.  

With water as the origin, the five elements cycle endlessly.  

Water resides in the north, governing winter among the four seasons—a time of storage and conclusion.  

A profound and mysterious enlightenment blossomed in his heart.  

An unconscious smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face.  

Before him, the jade slip materialized on its own.  

The experience value of the Five Organs Water Origin Method began to rise rapidly, accelerating with each passing moment.  

---  

As dawn broke, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, his gaze tinged with bewilderment.  

Recalling the events of the previous night, he wondered uncertainly, "Was that the legendary enlightenment?"  

Scanning his body with spiritual sense, he discovered that his cultivation had advanced significantly—he was now very close to the fifth level of Qi Refinement.  

Moreover, though he couldn't be sure, Zhang Jing faintly sensed that his future cultivation would become remarkably straightforward. It seemed all he needed to do was continuously refine spiritual energy and fill his dantian with spiritual power.  

It was as though—  

The riverbed had already been carved; all that remained was for the water to flow in.  

His gaze instinctively returned to the jade slip.

"A single moment of enlightenment actually pushed the Five Organs Water Origin Method to level six?" A trace of astonishment flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.  

Yet when he thought back to that indescribably profound state, it no longer seemed so surprising.  

If enlightenment didn't yield extraordinary results, why would it be so coveted by cultivators?  

---  

After several rounds of meditation, his thoughts settled.  

He then examined the new skill trait of the Five Organs Water Origin Method.  

A stream of information suddenly appeared.  

Soon, understanding dawned on Zhang Jing's face.  

The Five Treasures Spirit River was similar to the Five Elements Spirit River, but it felt far more terrifying to him.  

Yes, "terrifying" was the most fitting word to describe it.  

Within his body, the vast river projected another spiritual river that could accommodate five magical artifacts. Each surge of this river would unleash the combined might of these artifacts—whether for offense or defense—with devastating power.  

However, greater power came with greater consumption.  

Zhang Jing wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry.  

At his current level—approaching the fifth level of Qi Refinement—he would likely deplete his dantian's spiritual power after just a few attacks with the Five Treasures Spirit River at full capacity (assuming all five artifacts were mid-grade).  

As for lower-grade artifacts, he didn't even consider them.  

He still had the Five Elements Spirit River and numerous talismans at his disposal.  

If all those methods combined couldn't defeat an enemy, how much difference would the Five Treasures Spirit River with lower-grade artifacts make?  

"Looks like I'll need five mid-grade artifacts corresponding to the five elements and arrange them in the Five Treasures Spirit River according to the cycle of mutual generation. That might reduce the consumption," Zhang Jing mused to himself.  

He returned to the talisman-making chamber.  

Business could wait until tomorrow.  

Today, he would focus entirely on crafting mid-grade talismans for the trading session that evening.

Night fell unnoticed.  

Hidden Fragrance Pavilion.  

Once a renowned gathering place for poets and scholars in Nanli, this pavilion had been famous for its elegant entertainments and courtesans, attracting nobles and wealthy patrons who would spend fortunes without hesitation.  

Carved towers and lanterns illuminated the night sky, while the fragrance of incense and the opulence of carriages filled the air for miles—a sight that had captivated countless young hearts in Nanli.  

However, after the outbreak of the Langya demonic chaos, the pavilion had fallen into desolation.  

Yet tonight, the Hidden Fragrance Pavilion was once again aglow, its lights stretching for miles. But compared to before, the atmosphere was less decadent and more refined.  

Nearby—on rooftops, in trees, beneath bridges—every conceivable spot was packed with cultivators.  

Their gazes were fixed on the pavilion's entrance.  

Occasionally, figures in blue robes radiating powerful spiritual fluctuations would appear, eliciting murmurs from the crowd.  

For the numerous rogue cultivators present, this was a rare opportunity to witness the strength of the Dao Academy's disciples. Anyone still in Langya City would not miss this event.
