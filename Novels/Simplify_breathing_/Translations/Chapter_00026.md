# Chapter 26: Multiple Versions of Cultivation Techniques

Each of these four sword techniques was no worse than Chen Fei's Azure Mountain Sword, some even slightly superior.

"Merge!"

The Azure Mountain Sword and Gale Sword disappeared, replaced by a single Blazing Mountain Sword.

"Simplify!"

"Blazing Mountain Sword is simplifying... Simplification successful... Blazing Mountain Sword → Azure Mountain Sword!"

Just as Chen Fei expected, after simplification, cultivating the Azure Mountain Sword would increase its proficiency. Now, it was time to grind for experience.

As for the formula for the Agile Spirit Pill, Chen Fei considered it for a moment and decided to inquire with the vendors in the dark market.

During the day, Chen Fei went to the North City Medical Hall as usual. With Sun Shu's recent trouble, Chen Fei had unexpectedly become the most powerful person within the medical hall. If it were someone else with a stronger desire for power, they would likely be gathering followers and establishing a personal faction by now.

However, Chen Fei had no interest in such things, because he knew that a faction or not, a single word from the Zhang family could overturn everything. Ultimately, the medical hall belonged to the Zhang family, and its fate was entirely up to them.

Liu Jun approached, greeting Chen Fei courteously. After some thought, Chen Fei reassigned Liu Jun to a different post—a minor promotion with less work and more pay. Chen Fei still had that much authority.

However, each condition was quite stringent. Even the easiest one required two thousand taels of silver, plus one hundred Agile Spirit Pills at half price.

Chen Fei inwardly exclaimed, *Good heavens!* It was clear these people had no intention of selling. Such prices seemed utterly unreasonable, almost like they were fishing.

Chen Fei had originally intended to change his appearance to that of a regular medicine vendor and inquire at the various herb stalls. But now, it seemed pointless; everyone was guarding their pill formulas as if they were their lifeblood.

"With my current alchemy level, I wonder if I can reverse-engineer the formula for the Agile Spirit Pill?"

Chen Fei stood in the dark market, his brows furrowed.

Chen Fei had consumed Agile Spirit Pills before. Some of the ingredients were actually the same as those in the Herb Reversion Pill. Only a few parts had been replaced, and the alchemy techniques also differed somewhat.

Chen Fei's Herb Reversion Pill was now at Great Perfection. As he briefly contemplated the Agile Spirit Pill, many inspirations flashed through his mind. However, it would be wishful thinking to try and refine the Agile Spirit Pill based solely on these insights.

"I'll go check the book stalls."

Chen Fei walked to a secluded spot, and when he emerged again, his face and figure had subtly changed. He walked down a small street and arrived at Chi Defeng's stall.

"Oh, why do you have time to come today? The medicinal herbs aren't ready that quickly," Chi Defeng said, leaning back in his long chair and looking at Chen Fei with some surprise.

"I just feel that some of the words within it make a lot of sense," Chen Fei said with a smile.

"You should be careful with that."

Chi Defeng said, then rummaged through his stall and handed a cultivation technique manual to Chen Fei.

Chen Fei looked down at it. *Annotations of the Thunderclap Sword Force.*

The corners of Chen Fei's mouth involuntarily twitched. Who would be so bored as to create an annotated version?

"Are there other versions?" Chen Fei asked curiously.

"Of course there are! The Thunderclap Sword Force is the Immortal Cloud Sword Sect's top-tier introductory cultivation technique, coveted by countless people. You want other versions?"

Chi Defeng looked at Chen Fei strangely. Could this guy really be cultivating it, and had he now gone mad, intending to piece together the complete Thunderclap Sword Force himself?

"Give me all the versions you have," Chen Fei nodded.
