# Chapter 32: The Four Fundamental Elements  

The giant rhino's mana had just been dispersed, leaving it momentarily disoriented in a brief state of chaotic energy.  

Han Yue seized the perfect opportunity.  

His violet blade aura, unhindered by the rhino's defenses, pierced straight through its pupil and into its brain.  

The rhino's consciousness shattered instantly, and its massive body collapsed with a thunderous crash.  

In the next moment, Han Yue teleported away, reappearing beside Xiao Luo on the right.  

Xiao Luo had already prepared a second strike but retracted the mana gathered in her fist upon seeing Han Yue's decisive move.  

Just like that, a second-tier giant rhino was effortlessly slain under their combined assault.  

This was the easiest hunt Han Yue had ever experienced.  

Xiao Luo had completely suppressed the beast, leaving it unable to mount any effective defense or counterattack—giving Han Yue the perfect opening to strike.  

And Han Yue didn’t waste the opportunity, landing a single, fatal blow.  

"You're really impressive, Paopao! I never expected to find a mage like you in Fenrouji!"  

"You don’t seem like a typical Guizhou cultivator at all!"  

Xiao Luo was genuinely surprised by Han Yue’s abilities.  

His mana seemed weak, hardly befitting a disciple of a major sect, yet he wielded formidable divine abilities, always exceeding her expectations.  

"Xiao Luo, are all Beast Taming Sect cultivators as strong as you?"  

"In Fenrouji, hunting second-tier demonic beasts requires multiple factions working together, with several second-tier cultivators joining forces just to ensure success."  

"But in your hands, these second-tier beasts don’t even stand a chance!"  

Xiao Luo pondered for a moment before explaining:  

"In this vast Jade Sky Realm, there are countless human cultivators and demonic beings, yet only a rare few possess the foundation to ascend the path of immortality."  

"A cultivator’s foundation is built upon four fundamental elements."  

"**Mana cultivation is the Dao.**"  

"**Divine techniques and spells are the Art.**"  

"**Physical body and bloodline are the Body.**"  

"**Mastery over external objects is the Tool.**"  

"Yet most cultivators in this world are lacking in all four—weak in Dao, unskilled in Art, frail in Body, and poorly equipped in Tool. Their path is arduous."  

"Not just in Fenrouji, but in many other factions, most cultivators are similarly mediocre."  

"However, disciples of major sects like our Beast Taming Sect excel in at least one of these four elements, making us far stronger than ordinary cultivators."  

"If a cultivator excels in even one of these four—Dao, Art, Body, or Tool—their strength will far surpass their peers."  

"If they excel in two, they can be hailed as prodigies, leaders of their generation, and true inheritors of third-tier sects."  

"But those who master three or even all four? They are true seeds of immortality, the elite disciples of renowned sects, destined to dominate their era!"  

"From what I’ve seen, Paopao, your talent in the Art is exceptional. Your divine abilities are outstanding, making you one of the strongest in Fenrouji."  

"But the other three aspects are still lacking."  

"Of course, without the backing of a major sect or proper guidance, reaching your current level is already impressive!"  

As a disciple of a major sect, Xiao Luo effortlessly imparted invaluable knowledge to Han Yue with just a few words.  

"Look at these wild demonic beasts in the outer regions. Though they may have strong bodies and high ranks, to us disciples of major sects, only their physical prowess is noteworthy. The other three elements are insignificant."  

"In terms of true strength, they can’t compare to us cultivators!"  

"Among demonic beasts, only those with the bloodline of ancient great demons—those capable of wielding high-tier mana and divine abilities—can truly rival us."  

"But such high-tier beasts are exceedingly rare, especially in these borderlands."  

Han Yue nodded repeatedly, absorbing every word. He couldn’t resist asking a question he had long pondered:  

"Xiao Luo, though I come from Fenrouji, I have no master and have been cultivating through self-study. If I wanted to join a major sect, what would it take?"  

Though Han Yue was still steadily accumulating resources in Fenrouji, it was mainly because he felt his time in this world had been too short. He was using the settlement’s resources to grow rapidly.  

Moreover, he had the *Yang Shen Lei*—a foundational cultivation method—so he was far from hitting a bottleneck. He hadn’t yet considered leaving Fenrouji to seek a proper sect.  

But he knew that sooner or later, he would have to venture out in search of a true inheritance and attempt to join a top-tier faction to continue his path.  

And since Xiao Luo was the only major sect disciple he knew, her advice was invaluable to him.  

"To join a renowned sect, you only need to excel in one of the four elements—Dao, Art, Body, or Tool—and find a sect that aligns with your strengths. That alone gives you a strong chance of becoming an inner disciple."  

"However, just the talent requirement alone eliminates ninety percent of cultivators."  

"Add to that the arduous journey to find a compatible sect, along with countless dangers along the way, and the number of successful applicants becomes very limited."  

"My Beast Taming Sect, for example, recruits widely across Guizhou. Any cultivator with outstanding talent can join us."  

"However, our core teachings focus on the Body and Tool paths. To become a true inheritor and a seed of immortality, one must excel in these two."  

"Paopao, with your divine abilities, joining our sect as an inner disciple wouldn’t be a problem."  

"If you’re interested, after we finish our business here, I can give you our sect’s token and recommend you for admission."  

"But I should warn you—I’ve noticed you cultivate through primal qi absorption, not bloodline body refinement."  

"Though our sect does have mage teachings, achieving immortality here would require switching to either the Tool or Body path."  

"Truthfully, most top-tier sects focus on mage cultivation. Sects like ours are in the minority."  

"In Guizhou, there’s another top-tier sect—the Green Lotus Sword Sect—which is far more suited for mages."  

"But their recruitment philosophy is different from ours. They prioritize quality over quantity, accepting very few disciples with much stricter requirements."  

"The Green Lotus Sword Sect has less than a tenth of our numbers, but nearly all their disciples are sword cultivators—mages with unparalleled combat prowess."  

"Since you’re a mage, if you’re confident in your talent, you could try joining them to train in the sword path."  

"As for top sects in other continents… the journey is far too long, and admission is even more difficult."
