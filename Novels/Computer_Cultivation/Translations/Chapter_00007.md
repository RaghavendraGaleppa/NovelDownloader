# Chapter 7: Combat

"Clang!"

With a flash of sword light, Fang Jun's Heavenly Balance Sword steadily blocked the incoming attack. He smirked, "Yang Yuwan, why be so impatient?"

In the distance, a dignified and elegant woman sped over, none other than Yang Yuwan.

Behind her followed a fifteen or sixteen-year-old youth, his face still bearing a youthful innocence, with features somewhat resembling Yang Yuwan's.

Yang Yuwan's eyes burned with fury, her voice sharp, "Fang Jun, you dare kill my daughter!"

Fang Jun's expression remained calm, his tone even, "She spoke disrespectfully and provoked me first. I merely acted in self-defense."

Yang Yuwan laughed in extreme anger, "Self-defense? Even if she was at fault, are you completely without blame? A life for a life, it's the law of heaven!"

Fang Jun sneered, "Yang Yuwan, you're certainly protective of your own. In that case, I'll say it the way your daughter liked to hear it—I killed her because I felt like it. What about it? Are you satisfied?"

The youth frowned upon hearing this, stepping forward, his voice still boyish but carrying a hint of righteousness, "Fang Jun, speaking to my mother like that, have you no regard for human ethics? How is such behavior any different from that of a beast?"

Fang Jun glanced at him, "I once heard the townspeople of North New Town say, 'Heaven is without courtesy, observing all living beings equally, and Heaven favors the Fang family.' Now you use ethics to restrain me? How laughable."

Yang Yuwan trembled with rage, raising the long sword she had used to attack Fang Jun, pointing it directly at him, "Enough nonsense! Today, I will take your life to avenge my daughter!"

Fang Jun sneered, "You say that as if you wouldn't have taken my life even if I hadn't killed your daughter? Have you forgotten the assassins you sent to Anxi City? But since you insist on seeking death, then I shall grant your wish."

Just as the two were at daggers drawn, about to clash, a loud shout echoed from afar, "Stop!"

The voice was like thunder, causing the surrounding air to tremble.

A middle-aged man strode through the air, his figure like lightning, instantly landing between the two. His face was stern, his eyes like torches, none other than Fang Tianxiong, the head of the Fang family.

Upon seeing him, Yang Yuwan said angrily, "Tianxiong, he killed Ruer, are you just going to stand by and do nothing?"

Fang Tianxiong frowned, glancing at Fang Ru's corpse on the ground, and said in a deep voice, "Such a thing happened? Fang Jun, why did you kill your sister!"

Fang Jun sneered, "My 'sister'? Since when did my mother have a daughter?"

Fang Tianxiong's face darkened, and he shouted, "Silence! Your mother is right here!"

Fang Jun's gaze was icy, staring directly at Fang Tianxiong, "I only have one mother."

Seeing this, Yang Yuwan shrieked, "Tianxiong, look, Fang Jun doesn't even acknowledge me. He's clearly an outsider. Don't favor him anymore!"

Fang Tianxiong was silent for a moment, then turned to look at Fang Jun, his tone cold and hard, "Fang Jun, I ask you, do you acknowledge Yuwan as your mother?"

Fang Jun laughed, his laughter tinged with mockery, "What if I don't?"

A hint of coldness flashed in Fang Tianxiong's eyes, his voice low, "Acknowledge, and you are still a member of the Fang family. Refuse, and you will get out of this house."

Fang Jun didn't care, and asked, "What happens after I get out?"

Fang Tianxiong's gaze turned cold, his tone filled with killing intent, "Naturally, you will be killed."

Upon hearing this, Fang Jun laughed loudly, "Fang Tianxiong, if you want to kill me, just kill me. Why bother finding such a high-sounding reason?"

Fang Tianxiong frowned, "I never thought of killing you."

Fang Jun's laughter stopped abruptly, his gaze like a knife, "Never thought of it? Then what are you doing now? Forcing me to acknowledge someone I don't as my mother, then using the family rules to expel me from the family, and finally, righteously eliminating me—Fang Tianxiong, you've really calculated this well."

Fang Tianxiong's expression changed slightly, "Fang Jun, don't talk nonsense! I never had such thoughts!"

Fang Jun sneered, "Whether you did or not, you know it in your heart. But I'll make it clear today—I, Fang Jun, will never acknowledge Yang Yuwan as my mother, nor do I care about the identity of the Fang family. If you want to kill me, go ahead and do it. Why put on such a hypocritical act?"

Seeing this, Yang Yuwan shouted sharply, "Tianxiong, what are you waiting for? He's so rebellious. Are you still going to spare his life?"

Fang Tianxiong was silent for a moment, "Fang Jun, since you insist on this, then don't blame me for not considering our father-son relationship."

Fang Jun scoffed, "Father-son relationship? Fang Tianxiong, when have you ever had a father-son relationship with me? Today, I want to see how you'll kill me!"

Before the words were finished, Fang Jun had already made his move, the sword light like lightning, directly targeting Fang Tianxiong's throat.

Fang Tianxiong's figure flashed, dodging the sword's edge, then he patted his waist, and a fiery red token suddenly flew out, hovering in front of him.

The runes on the token flickered, instantly releasing a sky full of fire. The flames were like dragons, layered upon layered, turning into a wall of fire, completely blocking Fang Jun's sword light.

The flames didn't stop there, but instead swept towards Fang Jun like a tide, the scorching heat distorting the surrounding air.

Fang Jun snorted coldly, the sword light swirling, drawing a sharp sword aura, dividing the oncoming flames in two.

The flames were forced back by the sword aura, but they didn't dissipate. Instead, under Fang Tianxiong's control, they re-condensed, turning into several fire snakes, attacking Fang Jun from all directions.

This was the combat between Qi Refining Great cultivators, no longer relying on fists and feet, but using magical treasures as a medium to unleash power far beyond the imagination of ordinary people.

The cultivation methods of cultivators are originally to pursue longevity. Although their physical bodies are strong, they are far inferior to magical treasures specifically designed for combat.

Even mortal martial artists know that bare hands are no match for divine weapons, let alone cultivators?

Moreover, the birth of natal magical treasures allows cultivators to merge with their magical treasures, the magical treasures becoming extensions of the cultivator's body, so there is no need to rely on the physical body during combat.

Fang Tianxiong's fiery red token was his natal magical treasure, with infinite power.

Fang Jun's swordsmanship was fierce, the sword light like a rainbow, each sword seeming to carry the power to destroy mountains and break rocks.

And Fang Tianxiong controlled the flames with the token, the flames sometimes turning into barriers, sometimes turning into sharp blades, both offensive and defensive.

The battle between the two was extremely fierce, sword energy and flames intertwined, the surrounding houses were damaged by the aftermath, and the ground was shaken and cracked with ravines.

In the heat of the battle, Fang Jun suddenly sneered, the sword stance suddenly changing, the sword energy like a rainbow, directly targeting Fang Tianxiong's vital points.

Fang Tianxiong's expression changed slightly, and he hurriedly retreated several steps, the flame barrier instantly condensing, barely blocking this sword.

Fang Jun sheathed his sword and stood upright, "Fang Tianxiong, your strength is only so-so. I thought a cultivator at the ninth level of Qi Refining would be much more powerful."

Fang Tianxiong's face was livid, and he gritted his teeth, "Fang Jun, don't be arrogant!"

Fang Jun didn't say more. The Heavenly Balance Sword merged into his body, and his body turned into sword light, soaring into the air.

Seeing this, Yang Yuwan said anxiously, "Tianxiong, are you just going to let him go?"

Fang Tianxiong said angrily, "Shut up! Do you know how amazing Fang Jun's cultivation is now? A third-level Qi Refining cultivator can contend with a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator. Even if it's because of his natal magical treasure, I also have a natal magical treasure. Fang Qidong was probably killed by him."

"And most importantly, I can't activate the family's formation. It seems someone is helping him."

Yang Yuwan felt as if she had been doused with a basin of cold water, understanding the seriousness of the matter, and calmed down, "Then what should we do!"

A soft laugh came, "How about this?"

As the words fell, the sword light turned, and Yang Yuwan's head was separated from her body.

Only Fang Tianxiong's roar remained, "Fang Jun!"
