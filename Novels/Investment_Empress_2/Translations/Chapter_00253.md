# Chapter 253: The Combined Technique — Bing!

Li Mo and his companions left the garrison camp, traveling over a hundred miles through the night before finally setting foot on Treasure Bottle Mountain.

As for why they went to the military camp, there were two reasons.

First, to find out where the Peng Demon frequently appeared.

Second, to friendly "discuss" the matter with Commander Qi with a hammer in hand, expressing that he would return, and hoping that Fu Yingzi’s family would be safe and sound upon his return. Otherwise, within three days...

Under the night sky, the exceptionally tall trees stood like a woven net, with the occasional cry of insects and birds piercing the silence.

Huang Donglai moved like the wind, darting around with his nose twitching. While searching for traces of the Peng Demon, he casually picked up the medicinal herbs he passed by.

"Brother Huang’s movement technique is truly remarkable," Li Mo praised with clicks of his tongue.

Mu Rongxiao watched with some envy; he still didn't know when he would make it onto the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List).

"No wonder Brother Huang is called the Flying Poison Twin-Faced Turtle," Mu Rongxiao remarked.

Huang Donglai’s body stiffened, and he almost crashed into a tree.

"Brother Huang, have you found the Peng Demon’s most recent roost?" Li Mo asked, looking up.

"This is indeed a place it occasionally frequents," Huang Donglai nodded, then added with a hint of camaraderie, he said, "However, it is likely afraid of ambushes. Like a cunning rabbit with three burrows, this is probably just a decoy to fool people."

"Then where is its real nest?"

"Rest assured, Brother Li, I can find it!" Huang Donglai picked up a clump of soil and placed it in his mouth, tasting it carefully.

"Reliable!"

Li Mo gave a thumbs up. Bringing Huang Donglai along was a wise decision. It not only avoided many troubles but also served as a living map of the Southern Frontier, complete with built-in tracking navigation.

It wasn't long before they arrived at the a cliff on the mountain top.

Huang Donglai tasted the soil on the ground again, then looked at the cave not far away and nodded.

"This is likely the Peng Demon’s true lair."

"It hasn't returned for two to three days, probably because of Fairy Ying."

"It will still return here," Li Mo said, covering his nose to block out the foul smell from the cave, frowning as he asked, "Brother Huang, shouldn't we make some preparations?"

The Peng Demon’s flight speed was extremely fast.

Speed was currently Li Mo’s weakness. Even with a superior movement technique and the Cloud Walking Boots, he couldn't compare to a demonic beast with the bloodline of a bird of prey.

Huang Donglai, on the other hand, was not lacking in speed. With the Cloud Walking Boots, he would surely be able to catch up.

But he might not be able to take it down alone.

As for Mu Rongxiao... at the Internal Breath Realm, he was barely half a combatant.

"A trap to deal with bird-type demonic beasts..." Huang Donglai pondered.

However, before he could come up with the most foolproof plan, the clever Li Mo’s mind flashed with a brilliant idea!

"Hey, Brother Huang, you can catch up, but you might not be able to beat it, right?"

"Correct."

"I can't catch up, but I can definitely beat it, right?"

"Naturally," Huang Donglai said, somewhat confused.

Their strengths couldn't be combined.

Then he saw Li Mo smile and say, "In that case, why don't I just ride you?"

Huang Donglai: "???"

Li Mo then looked at Mu Rongxiao beside him: "Brother Mu Rong has the鸣蛟 (Ming Jiao) bloodline, and the Ming Jiao and the Great Peng clans are mortal enemies, right?"

"Yes, the letter from home said I must avoid the Great Peng clan's territory," Mu Rongxiao replied, coming to his senses. He had indeed told Li Mo this before.

Li Mo clenched his left fist and slapped his right palm, laughing: "Then, let’s have Brother Mu Rong lure it into a trap! I will teach you some techniques to enrage it. When it swoops down, you throw the Soft Tendon Powder."

"Ah?" Mu Rongxiao pointed at himself: "Me?"

Li Mo said confidently: "Once it's blinded by rage, I will ride Brother Huang and launch a sudden attack! How will the Great Peng deal with that?"

"The probability of us making sure it has no way to escape is one thousand percent!!!"

This fighting style combined the essence of "Fighting King," Li Mo's combat strength, and Huang Donglai's speed!

It was absolutely flawless!

"!!!" Mu Rongxiao leaned back in shock.

Huang Donglai sucked in a cold breath.

He had faced many enemies, but he had never seen such a bizarre fighting style.

Putting himself in the enemy's shoes, even he would likely meet a tragic end facing this combination.

Good thing his relationship with Brother Li was excellent!

......

The next evening.

Outside Treasure Bottle Mountain, a huge bird shadow flew over. The strong wind pressure caused by its passage startled the birds and beasts in the forest to flee.

As a Great Peng nearing the Sixth Grade with a powerful bloodline, it disliked relying on a clan. Having the entire Treasure Bottle Mountain as its territory was a wonderful thing.

The setting sun shone on its head, reflecting a dazzling light, showing that it was in a bad mood.

"Xiao Qing actually refuses to see me."

"It's all that human woman's fault!"

The Peng Demon cursed as it flew, its tone filled with anger and fear.

It had every reason to fear.

The Qing Luan clan was once a very powerful branch during the Great Shang Dynasty. Since then, they had guarded the Southern Frontier alongside the Great Shang experts.

Later, when the border troops and experts returned to the Imperial Capital, the Qing Luan clan remained here. After the fall of the Great Shang Imperial Capital, they had been recuperating in the Southern Frontier.

"That woman actually entered the Qing Luan territory as a human."

"And received such special treatment..."

It muttered as it flew near the cliff. After circling a few times, it never landed.

Something was wrong.

Extremely wrong. The smell...

Its vision was excellent. Squinting its pupils, it saw that there was actually a... bald person sitting in front of its nest?

Where did such an arrogant monk come from?

No, no, it wasn't just a monk.

The Peng Demon flew closer, judging from the scales on the opponent's neck and those claws.

That annoying smell was the Ming Jiao!

The Peng Demon itself disliked monks, let alone a Ming Jiao-blooded monk, especially since it was in a rage, wishing to swallow it whole.

However, it still had some reason and didn't approach recklessly.

"Bald bird!"

Mu Rongxiao suddenly shouted, pointing at it.

The Peng Demon: "?"

Do you know how handsome I was when I wasn't bald?

Before it could react.

Mu Rongxiao silently recited "Amitabha" in his heart and shouted again:

"I still can't forget the feeling of kissing your mother."

"?"

"The duck tongues in the hotpot last time were really delicious."

"Your mom is the duck! I'm going to eat you!"

From the Peng Demon's bald spot turning slightly red, one could see that it, already furious, became even more enraged.

It didn't care about anything else anymore and dove straight down, wanting to swallow this bloodline enemy whole.

However, before it could dive to the front, several jars were suddenly thrown by Mu Rongxiao, smashing on the ground and raising a cloud of powder.

"Ambush!?"

The Peng Demon felt its limbs go weak the moment it smelled it, but it had been living in the mountains and fighting with various exotic beasts and demon clans for a long time. It immediately stopped its momentum.

Flapping its wings, it created a boundless gale to blow away the dust.

"This Soft Tendon Powder is better than nothing," a voice sounded from not far away. It was Huang Donglai, who had been waiting for a long time.

"Let's take it down first," another figure rushed out from the dust, holding a hammer.

"Hehehe, do you think these little tricks are enough to take down this Lord?" the Peng Demon laughed, flying back into the sky.

Although the opponent's realm wasn't as high as its, they were clearly well-prepared.

It had been affected by the poison just now, so it might not win in a direct fight, and it didn't know if there were other ambushes, so it decided to retreat tactically.

Humans needed to be at the Inner Scene Realm to fly, and their speed definitely couldn't match its.

So...

"Eat this Lord's bird poop!"

The Peng Demon prepared to恶心 (disgust) the opponent before leaving to vent its anger.

However, the next moment.

It saw a scene it would never forget.

"Brother Huang! Combined technique!" Li Mo shouted.

"Alright!"

Huang Donglai, now wearing the Cloud Walking Boots, bent down.

He didn't know why, but hearing Brother Li's shout gave him an inexplicable feeling of excitement?

A weight pressed on his back.

Li Mo, holding the hammer, jumped onto Huang Donglai's back. The latter's movement technique ran at full power.

And so.

Li Mo rode Huang Donglai, charging at the sky with incredible speed and fierce momentum!

The Combined Technique — Bing!

Even in this crisis, the Peng Demon couldn't help but feel a scalp-burning sensation.

"What the hell is this?!"
