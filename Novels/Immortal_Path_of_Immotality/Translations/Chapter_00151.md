# Chapter 150: The Demon Sect's Inquisition

"Lushan, come to the command tent's meeting hall immediately! My master is looking for you!"

Luan Chun hurriedly ran to the supply depot, grabbing Lushan's arm and dragging him toward the depths of the military camp. Completely baffled, Lushan let himself be pulled along, wondering what urgent matter could have Guardian Yan summoning him so abruptly.

Upon arriving at the grand meeting hall of the central command, the atmosphere was solemn, with blazing torches illuminating the space. 

Rows of Golden Core cultivators sat cross-legged on either side—over a hundred in total—likely representing the majority of the Black Lotus Sect's elite combatants. At the far end of the hall, the sect's leader stood respectfully to one side while three Nascent Soul guardians sat loftily above him, listening impassively to his report.

Lushan nearly jumped out of his skin when Luan Chun pulled him inside. As a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, what business did he have attending such a high-level meeting? This couldn't be right.

The two quietly skirted around to the side where Guardian Yan, as a Golden Core expert, had her own seat. She motioned for them to join her without a word, then settled into silent waiting.

Soon, others trickled in until the hall fell quiet once more.

"Now that everyone is present, we shall proceed with the next item—the investigation!" 

"According to Guardian Wang of our Southern Border faction, several years ago, a Black Lotus Buddha statue containing centuries of accumulated faith from the region was stolen by righteous cultivators and hidden in the imperial palace."

"During the recent battle at Bianliang, our sect thoroughly searched every corner of the imperial palace and ultimately discovered the statue's remains in the inner treasury."

"Someone had already beaten us to it, secretly pilfering the statue's faith!"

The assembly erupted in uproar.

Gasps and murmurs spread like wildfire as everyone glanced around, wondering who would dare commit such an audacious theft—stealing faith was a capital offense in the Black Lotus Sect, punishable by soul extraction and sky lantern execution. Not even Golden Core guardians would risk it.

A heavy, murderous tension settled over the hall.

Standing behind Guardian Yan, Lushan's heart plummeted. He hadn't expected the Black Lotus Sect to know about the statue in the palace, let alone that their upper echelons would take such an interest. Now that the truth was coming to light, would they uncover his involvement?

Fortunately, many demonic cultivators had stormed the palace that night. His decision to conceal his identity to avoid "Thundercloud Master" had serendipitously masked his trip to the inner treasury. Moreover, the强化面板 had absorbed the faith without leaving a trace—no residual energy clung to him. Logically, he should be safe... but it never hurt to be cautious.

"This case regarding the stolen faith will be presided over by myself, with the three Dharma Kings overseeing the proceedings."

---

Three nights prior, 78 Foundation Establishment and numerous Qi Condensation disciples had entered the imperial palace. 

All Qi Condensation suspects had already been secretly investigated over the past three days. Now, the remaining Foundation Establishment suspects were called forward.

"Under the Dharma Kings' supervision, I will not covet any disciple's fortuitous encounters. Please rest assured as I inspect your storage pouches."

"Resisters will be executed!"

The sect leader's icy tone, coupled with the three Nascent Soul Dharma Kings' tacit approval, left the entire assembly trembling in fearful silence.

One by one, the summoned Foundation Establishment cultivators formed a line, obediently presenting their storage spaces for inspection while enduring full-body scans of their spiritual energy. None dared protest.

Human rights? Privacy? Such concepts didn't exist here—this was a demonic sect! Who cared about such niceties?

Cold sweat drenched Lushan's back. While his storage bracelet contained no faith, it held plenty of incriminating items and treasures he couldn't afford to expose:

- The straw effigy from the Witch Sect's legacy containing their foundational divine ability.
- The ancestral tablet from Penglai Holy Land in the Eastern Sea.
- A sapling of the ten-thousand-year-old sentient Illusory Spirit Ancient Tree.
- The Bliss Buddha statue obtained from the Jiangdong ruins.

Each item had extraordinary origins—some even he didn't fully understand. 

Then there were the treasures: the Void Star Disc artifact, Severing Water Sword, the minor divine ability Water Veil of Heaven, Illusory Spirit Wood and its sap, the Eastern Sea spirit materials left by Elder Tortoise, and over a hundred thousand spirit stones.

Such wealth concentrated on a mere early Foundation Establishment cultivator would raise instant suspicion—most Golden Core experts weren't this rich!

Lushan's mind raced like ants on a hot griddle. Fleeing wasn't an option—with three Nascent Soul and over a hundred Golden Core experts present, any attempt would be suicide.

"I can use a secret technique to conceal the Illusory Spirit Ancient Tree's life aura. Go ahead without worry."

Black Skeleton Demon Lord, who had remained silent until now, finally sensed the gravity of the situation. Having not accompanied Lushan into the palace that night, it assumed his anxiety stemmed from the ancient tree's detection—something even Nascent Soul elders would covet.

Lushan nearly exclaimed aloud upon hearing the mental transmission. Since when had this bastard recovered to Foundation Establishment?! They'd agreed to maintain parity, yet it had secretly crossed the threshold right under his nose!

"Shh! No time for arguments now—we're in this together," Black Skeleton hastily placated, recognizing the danger of drawing attention. "I'll conceal your other treasures too. Let's settle this later."

Lushan had no choice but to agree as the line dwindled, with Guardian Yan gently urging him forward. 

Black Skeleton scoffed mentally, "Aside from the ancient tree, do you really think the sect leader would care about your other junk?"

In its view, Lushan's artifacts, minor divine abilities, and assorted materials might tempt ordinary Golden Core cultivators, but the leader of a top-tier sect had seen it all. With millions of disciples and vast territories under his rule, why would he covet such trifles?

Lushan remained skeptical—had it failed to recognize the Seven Arrows Book's straw effigy? The Penglai Holy Land tablet? The Bliss Buddha statue? Then realization struck: without the强化面板, even he wouldn't know their significance. Perhaps the sect leader would overlook them too.

"Lushan, it's your turn. Don't worry." Guardian Yan's gentle nudge and Luan Chun's reassuring pat reminded him that others had seen him use artifacts before—his paranoia about wealth exposure wasn't unfounded.

The hundred Golden Core elders sat meditatively, none daring to interfere with the inspection.

Each Foundation Establishment disciple endured thorough scrutiny—some sweating bullets, others trembling uncontrollably, a few nearly soiling themselves. 

In a demonic sect, who didn't have skeletons in their closet?

- Some secretly murdered fellow disciples to refine corpse puppets.
- Others assassinated Golden Core elders' descendants, now fearing recognition by grieving seniors.
- One collected female disciples' intimate garments—possibly including items stolen from present Golden Core matrons.
- Another dabbled in curses, hoarding hair and personal belongings to hex comrades.
- A particularly depraved individual sketched erotic art featuring imagined nude portraits of Golden Core women.

The demonic sect was a cesspool of vice—normally tolerated if undisclosed, but now threatening to erupt into internal bloodshed if exposed.

As the sect leader examined each storage device, his frown deepened. Thank heavens these discoveries remained private—public revelation would spark a massacre among the elders. These youngsters were truly... something.

His thoughts wandered:

- So Junior Brother Zhao's head disciple died fifty years ago at a comrade's hand...
- Elder Huang's second son's chronic illness stemmed from a curse...
- Junior Sister Qian's missing undergarments—the legendary "Phantom Hand Thief" was this old man?!
- Junior Sister Yan's figure truly was exquisite—this erotic album captured her likeness perfectly. Should I... keep it?
- My secretly raised bastard son wasn't killed by my wife... but by this brat?!

Wait—what?!

The sect leader nearly choked. Just as he'd been mentally mocking others, he'd become the victim! The irony was unbearable.

Case closed! After all these years, his son's murderer stood before him—a seemingly honest, dull-faced middle-aged man gazing at him with reverent admiration.

Suppressing murderous intent (a public scene would undermine sect stability), the leader patted the man's shoulder like a benevolent elder: "Good lad, you may go."

The man bowed, inwardly panicking. He'd killed the leader's son on the madam's orders and used the unique artifact gifted to the deceased—of course the leader recognized it! Those pats must have planted a tracking mark. His only hope was fleeing to the madam's protection at the Eastern Sea headquarters.

---

Finally, Lushan's turn arrived. His heart pounded as he faced the sect leader.

Though Black Skeleton's logic seemed sound, who knew what the leader might recognize? Even if overlooked, how would he explain his excessive wealth?

Thankfully, they'd transferred the royal elder's items to Black Skeleton's pouch and concealed the ancient tree sapling. 

Seconds stretched into eternities under the leader's Golden Core late-stage spiritual scan. His wind-thunder energy vortex quivered unnaturally, goosebumps sprouting like bamboo shoots.

Yet the leader's actual thoughts surprised him:

"So the Eastern Sea's Elder Tortoise didn't flee overseas—this kid inherited his fortune instead! Remarkable luck. With such talent at his age, he's worth nurturing..."

The leader recognized some of Elder Tortoise's registered possessions but considered them insignificant. His vision extended beyond petty greed—only appreciating Lushan's potential.

The primary objective remained locating the stolen faith. Lushan's side matters could wait. With such wealth, he'd thrive even without sect support.

Whether he'd been Elder Tortoise's accomplice mattered little. Demonic sects embraced all talents—dead men told no tales, and inheritors became loyal members regardless of past affiliations.

"No issues here. You may step down."

Dazed, Lushan returned to Guardian Yan's side, the leader's unexpected praise leaving him both relieved and bewildered.

---

After inspecting all 78 suspects without finding a trace of faith, the sect leader's expression darkened. The assembled Golden Core elders sensed the impending storm.

"Are you certain these were all who entered the palace that night?" the leader demanded of a subordinate.

"Y-yes, Sect Leader!"

"Absolutely sure?"

"W-well..."

The sweating aide hesitated, prompting the experienced leader to press harder: "Out with it!"

"Rumors suggest... many witnessed Bear Mountain Sage near the palace and inner treasury that night. However... investigations show he only arrived at the frontlines yesterday from the Eastern Sea, so..."

"Where is Bear Mountain Sage now?"

"In camp!"
