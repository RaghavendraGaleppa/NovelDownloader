## Chapter 65: A Letter from Lánzhou

Sitting on a stone at the entrance of the medicinal valley, Li Zhīmìng cradled a large, plump furball in his arms, basking in the midday sun with a serene expression. However, his tranquility was disrupted by the furry creature in his arms, which began to squirm and kick its short legs, indicating it wanted to be put down.

Li Zhīmìng held on tight, not letting it go. Just then, a black-clad maiden with a wooden basket slung over her elbow descended from the mountain. Her movements exuded elegance, reminiscent of a delicate, ethereal dance. Upon seeing the youth in green attire holding a fat furball, she quickened her pace, approached Li Zhīmìng, and bowed graciously.

"Young master," she said sweetly.

It had been two years since she had seen him in the valley. Iān Yún seemed to have stopped developing physically, but in reality, her body had grown significantly, unfolding like a blooming flower. Her figure was slender and graceful, and she took great pride in her enhanced bust. For the first time, she felt she could rival Iān Yún.

Moreover, she had discovered a unique advantage that set her apart from Iān Yún.

"Xī Jiā, what were you up to?" Li Zhīmìng barely glanced at her and continued to play with the furball in his arms, teasing it with his fingers and making "clicking" sounds.

As Qī Xiā's silken hair fluttered, she smoothed a strand behind her ear, a hint of shyness crossing her face. The young master had grown into a refined and handsome young man.

"I went to pick some mushrooms on the mountain, planning to make a soup for you tonight," she said, sharing her findings with him.

Li Zhīmìng glanced at the basket in her hands, which contained various types of mushrooms, mostly black, gray, or white.

"Not bad," he said, slapping his thigh. "Tonight, we can have a nice mushroom and furball stew."

The furball in his arms let out a series of high-pitched squeaks, its large body rubbing against Li Zhīmìng's chest. Its short legs no longer seemed to want to move.

Qī Xiā giggled, her eyes sparkling with mirth. She gazed at Li Zhīmìng several times, her cheeks flushed. After a moment, she bowed and said, "I'll go wash the mushrooms."

"Go ahead and play," Li Zhīmìng said, setting the furball down. The large creature was finally free, running off with its butt twitching.

As Qī Xiā walked away from Li Zhīmìng, a blush spread across her face.

The young master had essentially grown up under their eyes in the medicinal valley, earning the respect of everyone in the Qī Xuán Sect. They had, in a way, accepted their fate – their families had been destroyed, and they now served as maidens, bound to the sect.

Their lives seemed predetermined, confined to the valley.

However, observing Li Zhīmìng's growth made Qī Xiā realize he was unlike the rustic children from the countryside. While they might appear dull and uninteresting at first, they often developed into sturdy and simple individuals.

Li Zhīmìng, on the other hand, had blossomed into a refined and elegant young man.

As Qī Xiā departed, her thoughts drifted to the future. There was still a year... 

Stretching her arms, the warm sunlight made Li Zhīmìng feel invigorated. He turned to head back when he saw a woman approaching, holding a white oil-paper umbrella. Her dark hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall. She emerged from the mountain path, exuding an otherworldly aura, as if she had stepped out of a painting.

She walked directly to Li Zhīmìng and bowed, addressing him as "young master."

"Young master, a letter from Lánzhou."
