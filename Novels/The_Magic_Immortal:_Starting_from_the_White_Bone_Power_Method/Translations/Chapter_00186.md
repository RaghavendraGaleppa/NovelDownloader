# Chapter 186: I Admit You're Somewhat Strong, But Not Enough

The square-faced man remained utterly confident, not even bothering to immediately attack Wang Chan. Seeing that Wang Chan ignored him, he showed no irritation and continued, "I am Huo Douliang, the senior true disciple of Canglang Peak from Canglan Sect—the foremost major sect of Canglan Kingdom. You seem unfamiliar, may I have your name?"

Wang Chan still paid him no heed.

Huo Douliang's expression darkened slightly, but he maintained his composure. "I see you're quite arrogant. Very well, let's see if your skills match your attitude. I'll give you three moves—if you can withstand them, I'll spare your life."

With that, he raised his hand, and a vast, surging force gathered in his palm, forming a massive wave-like energy. The surrounding air trembled violently as if unable to bear the pressure.

"First move—**Canglan Raging Tide!**" Huo Douliang bellowed, thrusting his palm forward. The immense wave of energy surged toward Wang Chan like a tsunami, roaring with overwhelming force.

Wang Chan remained motionless, his expression indifferent. Just as the wave was about to engulf him, he casually flicked his sleeve. A faint ripple spread out, and the terrifying wave instantly dissipated into nothingness, as if it had never existed.

Huo Douliang's pupils contracted slightly. "Not bad, you've got some skill. But don't get too complacent—this was just a warm-up!"

He took a deep breath, and his aura suddenly surged. The ground beneath his feet cracked as an even more terrifying power condensed around him.

"Second move—**Heaven-Overturning Wave!**"

A colossal wave-shaped phantom materialized behind Huo Douliang, towering like a mountain. With a thunderous roar, it crashed down toward Wang Chan with earth-shaking momentum.

Wang Chan finally moved. He took a single step forward and lightly punched out. His fist seemed unremarkable, devoid of any flashy brilliance, yet the moment it made contact with the descending wave, the latter shattered like fragile glass, collapsing into scattered fragments of energy.

Huo Douliang's face stiffened. His strongest technique had been effortlessly broken by a single punch. A trace of panic flickered in his eyes, but he quickly suppressed it.

"Fine, you've forced my hand!" he growled through clenched teeth. "This last move will decide everything!"

He clasped his hands together, and his entire body began to glow with a deep blue radiance. The air around him distorted violently as an unprecedented pressure descended upon the battlefield.

"**Canglan Divine Judgment—Annihilation!**"

A beam of blinding blue light shot toward Wang Chan, carrying with it a destructive force capable of obliterating everything in its path.

Wang Chan sighed softly. "Enough of this farce."

He extended a finger and lightly tapped the air. The terrifying beam of light froze mid-flight before silently dispersing into nothingness, as if swallowed by an invisible abyss.

Huo Douliang staggered back, his face ashen. "Impossible... How could you..."

Wang Chan looked at him indifferently. "I admit you're somewhat strong, but not enough to trouble me. Now, it's my turn."

With that, he raised his hand, and an overwhelming pressure instantly crushed down on Huo Douliang, forcing him to his knees. The once-arrogant true disciple now trembled uncontrollably, realizing for the first time the vast gulf between them.
