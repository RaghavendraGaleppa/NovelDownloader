**Chapter 87: Practicing Along the Way**

However, Ding Rui had, after all, been tempered for fifteen years and was an excellent student who had gone through the *Gaokao* (college entrance examination). This ability to memorize things was something he had indeed cultivated.

He held the paper, first marking out all the key points, then reading it once before tucking it into his robe. "All right, I'll definitely commit this to memory. What's next?"

Li Yizhen watched Ding Rui, who had merely skimmed through the document, yet managed to accurately highlight all the crucial points of the entire pill formula. A trace of surprise flickered in her eyes. "It seems your talent for rote memorization is slightly higher than your talent for fire control. I'm very pleased."

"Is my talent for fire control really that low?" Ding Rui found it a little hard to believe.

"It's nothing, everyone has their flaws," Li Yizhen said, offering a faint, comforting smile. She suddenly realized that speaking this way was surprisingly satisfying, especially when directed at Ding Rui. However, this time, without waiting for Ding Rui's reply, she continued to explain the pill refining process.

"The most crucial aspect of pill control is speed and flexibility. Sometimes, you even need to multi-task, for example, when refining a Meridian-Opening Pill, you'll need to simultaneously process two spirit herbs during certain periods..."

Under Li Yizhen's meticulous and patient guidance, Ding Rui finally grasped the entire pill refining process. Through repeated practice, the sky completely darkened, and it was now deep into the night. However, most of the houses in the Pill Hall district still had lights on. The wolf cultivators had too many poison pills, so some excellent Pill Hall disciples had to devote almost all their time to refining pills.

As for Li Yizhen, having only recently entered the Foundation Establishment stage, her divine sense couldn't support her refining pills continuously. If she forced herself to refine pills when her divine sense was nearing exhaustion, it would only lead to failure and a waste of spiritual materials. She would refine pills until she was utterly exhausted before resting, and after that, she didn't even have the energy for cultivation. Now, after teaching Ding Rui pill refining, she was so tired she could barely keep her eyes open. Thus, even though Ding Rui was still full of vigor, Li Yizhen had no choice but to ask him to leave.

"Alright, it's very late. You should head back. Come again tomorrow. The sky is completely dark now," she said, letting out a yawn.

"Sigh! I really don't want to leave!" Ding Rui suddenly looked at Li Yizhen and exclaimed with a hint of deep affection.

The reason for his sustained vigor was that, at the time, to quickly master five cultivation techniques and become a spirit farmer, he hadn't cultivated at all, dedicating all his free time to working overtime. After successfully becoming a spirit farmer, and in order to maintain his identity and smoothly get through the first harvest, he didn't have much time to ponder cultivation either. After all, even with the help of his skill slots, he still needed to pay attention to the condition of the spirit rice while working, so it was naturally better to be careful. Furthermore, at that time, his five cultivation technique skills hadn't yet merged. It wasn't until he had finally completely merged his five cultivation techniques that the sect's domain began cultivating Meridian-Opening Flowers. When Ding Rui used his [Deep Pit] skill, he had to visit several spirit fields a day, and each field had its own cultivator overseeing it. His act of loosening the soil for two Meridian-Opening Flowers at once had already shocked too many people.
