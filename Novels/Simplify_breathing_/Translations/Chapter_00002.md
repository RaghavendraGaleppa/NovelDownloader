**Chapter 2: Counter-kill**

Seven or eight days passed. Chen Fei's originally thin and small body gradually developed, gaining some muscle. He no longer looked so weak and easily bullied.

Just as Chen Fei was anticipating his cultivation breaking through to the Skin-Refining Realm, the medical hall suddenly announced that they needed to go to the mountains outside the city to gather herbs.

The next morning, a group of apprentices from the medical hall left the city with their medicine baskets, heading to Pingyin Mountain.

Recently, it hadn't been very peaceful outside the city, but the medical hall was short on herbs, so the assignment for the apprentices to go out was naturally non-negotiable. Each person had a quota for gathering herbs; once completed, they could descend the mountain. If they failed to meet the quota, they would still have to return in three days, but a beating would be unavoidable.

The group scattered throughout the vast Pingyin Mountain and soon disappeared from sight.

Chen Fei walked for the time it takes an incense stick to burn, then spotted an herb. He joyfully went forward to pick it. With his continuous cultivation improvement, Chen Fei's physical strength had recently improved, and the sharpness of his five senses had also increased significantly.

Though Chen Fei was gathering herbs, his ears and eyes constantly paid attention to his surroundings, lest any danger approach without him knowing. Although there were no large beasts in Pingyin Mountain, there were many poisonous insects and snakes. Every time they gathered herbs, many apprentices would get injured, or even die.

As he thought about this, Chen Fei looked at his personal panel.

[Name: Chen Fei]
[Occupation: Martial Artist]
[Cultivation Methods: Extreme Mountain Fist (Uninitiated), Extreme Mountain Breathing Technique (Great Completion)]
[Realm: Martial Practitioner (99/100)]

“Almost there!”

Chen Fei’s expression brightened slightly. He had originally estimated ten days, but it seemed it would be even sooner. Moreover, the strenuous running and breathing just now seemed to have accelerated his realm's progression.

Chen Fei recalled Niu Kuo’s attire from earlier; he might be a hunter from Pingyin Mountain, possibly able to track him. Chen Fei didn't linger and ran in another direction.

He ran for a bit, rested, then ran again. Half an hour later, Chen Fei stopped, sensing intense changes occurring within his body.

The next moment, the sound of his muscles and bones resonating erupted from within Chen Fei. He involuntarily lifted his head as a surge of pain emanated from deep inside, followed by a tingling itch coursing through his flesh. Fortunately, this sensation only lasted a moment before subsiding. A powerful surge of strength welled up in his body, and Chen Fei instinctively clenched his fists.

[Realm: Skin-Refining (1/1000)]

“Whoosh!”

Before Niu Kuo could finish speaking, his face suddenly changed. He rolled to the side as a bowl-sized rock flew past where his head had been.

Niu Kuo got up, just as he was about to raise his bow and arrow, a figure had appeared before him. With a kick, the bow and arrow in his hand were sent flying, and Niu Kuo himself was knocked over by an immense force, involuntarily falling backward.

“Chen Fei!”

Sha Daxin hadn't yet understood what was happening when he saw Chen Fei appear, kicking Niu Kuo away. Sha Daxin instinctively swung his wood-chopping knife towards Chen Fei.

“Bang!”

Chen Fei kicked Sha Daxin in the chest. Sha Daxin grunted, spitting blood, and was sent flying several meters backward. He crashed into a large tree and slid to the ground.
