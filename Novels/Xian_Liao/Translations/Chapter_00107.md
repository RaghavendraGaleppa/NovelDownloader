# Chapter 107: The Five Beasts Technique

The roars of tigers, the cries of deer, the bellows of bears, the screeches of cranes, and the howls of apes—five thunderous sounds echoed through Zhou Qing's medicinal garden before finally subsiding after a long while. Zhou Qing took out his brush and ink, deep in thought.

"The foundation of my cultivation began with the Five Animal Frolics. Now, my Five Organs Thunder technique also stems from it, though refined and elevated by incorporating the Six Healing Sounds. However, this path of mine is exceedingly difficult. Perhaps I should divide my knowledge into five separate techniques—the Five Beasts Techniques—each simplified to guide practitioners directly to the Xiantian realm. Those with exceptional talent among future disciples may then use these to break through the three levels of body refinement and reach the 'Furnace' realm."

With this thought, Zhou Qing began writing the first manual:

**"Tiger's Roar Killing Scripture."**

The Tiger Frolic was the starting point of Zhou Qing's cultivation journey, and he held deep affection for it. Not only did he embed the Tiger's Roar Thunder within this scripture, but he also fused it with the Fierce Tiger Killing Scripture. Originally, the Tiger Frolic was the easiest of the Five Animal Frolics to master, but after Zhou Qing's modifications, the Tiger's Roar Killing Scripture became significantly more challenging.

With the help of his "Everlasting Life Mastery" in merging martial and Dao insights, Zhou Qing's inspiration surged. By expending some of his spiritual sense and qi-blood, he could swiftly create new techniques. Even so, it took him three days and nights to complete the first volume of the Tiger's Roar Killing Scripture.

As Zhou Qing examined the scripture written on the parchment, he felt something was missing. Soon, he noticed the parchment was drying out, and he realized the issue.

"To truly pass down the essence of the Tiger's Roar Killing Scripture, I must imprint my martial intent onto the parchment. However, even high-quality parchment is ultimately a mundane material and cannot withstand my martial intent for long. Over time, the intent will dissipate or destroy the parchment."

After some contemplation, Zhou Qing decided to switch to a different material—not mulberry bark parchment, but the hide of a White Wolf Beast.

### The Five Scriptures

1. **Tiger's Roar Killing Scripture**  
   The foundation of Zhou Qing's martial path, combining the Tiger Frolic's essence with lethal techniques.

2. **Deer's Call Longevity Scripture**  
   Infused with the essence of the Everlasting Youth Technique, focusing on vitality and longevity.

3. **Bear's Roar Golden Bell Scripture**  
   A body-refinement-centric technique, best paired with the Crane's Cry Scripture for balanced cultivation.

4. **Crane's Cry Soaring Heavens Scripture**  
   Emphasizing agility and grace, complementing the Bear's Roar Scripture.

5. **Monkey's Heart Ascendant Scripture**  
   The most challenging, requiring innate talent akin to an immortal constitution. Without external aid like the Great Mulberry Tree, practitioners risk self-harm from excessive internal fire.

### Passing Down the Legacy

Zhou Qing summoned Lin Wan'er, Butcher Hu, and Yuan Mingyue.

**To Lin Wan'er:**  
"Wan'er, this *Deer's Call Longevity Scripture* embodies my life's work. With the Bone-Cleansing Pills you've taken, mastering its basics will be straightforward. As you progress, combine it with Qi-Condensing Pills to deepen your cultivation. Though it emphasizes body refinement, its qi-refining aspects are unique. Within twenty years, aided by my elixirs, you should reach Qinglingzi's former level."

Lin Wan'er bowed in gratitude, receiving the scripture. The text shimmered like flowing water, each character pulsating with Zhou Qing's martial intent and aura, glowing faintly green—a divine artifact in its own right.

**To Butcher Hu:**  
Zhou Qing entrusted him with the *Fierce Tiger Killing Scripture*. Butcher Hu's background as a slaughterer and his accumulated bloodlust made him uniquely suited for this path. The scripture would allow him to harness his killing intent, turning a potential weakness into strength.

**To Yuan Mingyue:**  
Zhou Qing handed her the *Crane's Cry Soaring Heavens Scripture*. A month later, after a grueling trial, she awoke to Zhou Qing's relieved voice:  
"I underestimated the Heavenly Tribulation's difficulty. Without my Sacred Heart Art, I might not have saved you."  

Yuan Mingyue's success, alongside Blacklist champion Fang Longyuan, who endured despite witnessing two deaths and one surrender, cemented Zhou Qing's reputation. The world now saw Qingfu Palace's mountain gate as a "Dragon Gate"—where ordinary men could leap into the realm of immortals.

### The Path Forward

Recognizing the importance of life-and-death trials in overcoming the Heavenly Tribulation, Zhou Qing proposed abolishing the Blacklist and instituting a triennial **Martial Arts Grand Tournament**, where combatants would fight to the death without repercussions. This would foster true martial growth and uncover hidden talents across the land.

Meanwhile, Zhou Qing focused on refining the Dragon Yuan Pills, while Yuan Mingyue advanced her arraycraft to aid in forging magical instruments. Their next goal: exploring the cave abode of the legendary Master Jingyang.

### Epilogue: The Nature of Cultivation

"Demonic cultivation is still cultivation," Zhou Qing remarked to Fushan. "We must simply choose our path with clarity—knowing what to embrace and what to reject."

Fushan nodded in agreement.  

Thus, the legacy of the Five Beasts Techniques began its journey through time, shaping the future of cultivation under Zhou Qing's vision.
