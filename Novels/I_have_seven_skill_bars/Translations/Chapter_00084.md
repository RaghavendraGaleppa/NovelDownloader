# Chapter 84: I'll Teach You Alchemy!

"Fellow Junior Sister Li!" Ding Rui exclaimed, "What are you doing here?"

Li Yizhen was taken aback, thinking, *Didn't I ask you that first?*

"Also, why are you wearing outer sect disciple robes?" Ding Rui added, his voice full of shock.

Li Yizhen immediately rolled her eyes, glaring at Ding Rui, and scoffed, "You're allowed to cultivate five cultivation methods and become a Spirit Farmer, but I'm not allowed to cultivate one and become an outer sect disciple?"

Only then did Ding Rui realize it had been nearly half a year since he became a Spirit Farmer. After such a long time, Li Yizhen breaking through to the Qi Refining stage probably shouldn't surprise him so much.

Although he thought that, Ding Rui still blurted out, "Awesome!"

"What? What 'awesome'?" Li Yizhen frowned, her delicate brows furrowed in confusion.

"Huh? Are there no cows here? Cow cultivators." Ding Rui also grew confused.

"Cow cultivators? What's that? Never heard of them," Li Yizhen said.

"Alright," Ding Rui nodded, having learned new knowledge. So there were no cow cultivators within the sect domain. He couldn't help but wonder, "I just don't know if they don't exist *only* in the sect domain, or if they don't exist in the entire Huaqing Realm."

After she saw Ding Rui's gaze shift with her, she quickly flipped her hand and pointed to her own nose, then smiled even more brightly.

"What?" Ding Rui didn't understand.

"Me!"

"What about you?"

"It's me!"

"You what?"

"I'm going to teach you alchemy! Got it?" Li Yizhen's eyes widened, her voice rising by a notch, startling a passing Pill Hall disciple who glanced their way several times.

"Can teaching alchemy be this overbearing now? Learned something new..." the Pill Hall disciple mused to himself, nodding subtly with a hidden smile.

"You're going to teach *me* alchemy?"

Ding Rui's voice was even louder than Li Yizhen's, and laced with disbelief.

Li Yizhen immediately became displeased. Her beautiful eyes widened to their extreme, and her chest heaved as she almost couldn't catch her breath.

After not seeing him for so long, she could no longer perfectly maintain her composure in front of Ding Rui.

"What do you mean? What about me? Can't I teach you?" Li Yizhen's tone directly rose an octave.

Indeed, Li Yizhen became Ding Rui's temporary alchemy master.

Moreover, the price she asked for was surprisingly cheap, slightly astonishing Ding Rui.

Only fifty grains of spirit rice per hour.

The common market price was a hundred grains of spirit rice.

Upon hearing fifty grains of spirit rice, Ding Rui immediately disagreed, insisting he would only settle for paying a hundred grains.

"No, that won't do. A hundred grains means a hundred grains. My agreement to help you kill pests for free back then was a separate matter. How can it be linked to this? Besides, even if it were to be counted, it should be against your entire Spirit Field #56, not just letting you suffer a loss alone?" Ding Rui shook his head firmly.

Hearing this, Li Yizhen's heart twisted again.
