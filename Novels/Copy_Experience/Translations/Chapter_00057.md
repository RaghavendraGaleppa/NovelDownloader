# Chapter 57: Heaven Spirit Flower

“Oh, Fellow Daoist Han has entered the eighth layer of Qi Condensation! Congratulations, congratulations!”

At Talisman Master Wang's courtyard, when Lu Xu arrived, the old man immediately discerned his cultivation change and quickly offered congratulations.

In the past few years, while cultivating, Lu Xu hadn't forgotten to befriend his neighbors. Talisman Master Wang, whose experience he had once copied, was one of them.

“Alas, after ten years of arduous cultivation, I've finally broken through. It truly wasn't easy. Each layer in the late Qi Condensation stage becomes progressively harder to cultivate!” Lu Xu shook his head and sighed theatrically.

“Cultivating in the late Qi Condensation stage is naturally much harder than the early and middle stages. However, for a Fellow Daoist to break through a layer within ten years, your talent must be extraordinary!”

“Not at all, not at all. It's merely because I earned some spirit stones from making talismans and bought some Qi Gathering Pills, which allowed for this speed.”

“Fellow Daoist is too modest. Looking at your age, I believe you have a good chance of reaching the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation before you're sixty, don't you?”

“That's truly hard to say. Fellow Daoist Wang, don't let my youthful appearance fool you; I frequently consume Beauty Preserving Pills. My true age is already quite advanced!” Lu Xu sighed, shaking his head.

Talisman Master Wang smiled, then changed the subject:

“Speaking of which, Fellow Daoist Wen Siming, who lives in Building Twenty-Three, just entered the tenth layer of Qi Condensation two days ago. He's only fifty-five this year, so he has great hope for Foundation Establishment!”

“Oh, has this Fellow Daoist prepared for Foundation Establishment?” Lu Xu immediately asked with great interest.

“I just visited him yesterday. He's almost finished gathering the thirteen auxiliary ingredients for the Foundation Establishment Pill, but for the main ingredient, he's completely at a loss!”

“Heaven Spirit Flower, you mean? That is indeed a difficult matter!” Lu Xu murmured with a sigh.

The Heaven Spirit Flower is the main ingredient for refining Foundation Establishment Pills, and its yield severely restricts the number of pills available. For most Qi Condensation cultivators, the difficulty of Foundation Establishment lies precisely in the scarcity of the Heaven Spirit Flower.

The Heaven Spirit Flower is a spiritual medicine that cannot be cultivated by human effort. For thousands of years, countless wise sages and powerful cultivators have tried to artificially cultivate the Heaven Spirit Flower, but all have failed. It is a spiritual medicine born of heaven and earth, only capable of naturally forming within spirit veins; there is no other way. For example, the low-grade second-tier spirit vein in Qinghu City produces one Heaven Spirit Flower every three hundred years. The low-grade third-tier spirit vein of the Wei Family in Tianmen City produces one every twenty years. As for the high-grade third-tier spirit vein in Wanxian City, it is said to produce one Heaven Spirit Flower every five years.

“I remember that Heaven Spirit Flowers occasionally appear at the major auctions in Wanxian City, don't they? That gives us rogue cultivators a chance!” Lu Xu said.

Talisman Master Wang shook his head repeatedly upon hearing this:

“That's purely a matter of luck. Those Heaven Spirit Flowers put up for auction are all found in the Myriad Demon Mountain Range. Even if one occasionally appears, it's impossible for it to fall into the hands of rogue cultivators!”

“Nominally, it gives rogue cultivators a chance, but how can rogue cultivators hope to compete with those Foundation Establishment forces?”

“Does Brother Han know how high the price of a Heaven Spirit Flower was at the last Wanxian City auction?”

“How much?”

“Eight thousand six hundred spirit stones!”

That was indeed a despair-inducing number. No rogue cultivator could possibly produce such a vast sum of spirit stones.

“Then it seems Fellow Daoist Wen has little hope!” Lu Xu sighed softly.

“Indeed. He's a genuine rogue cultivator, without any backing from a force. He achieved his current success by risking his life in the Myriad Demon Mountain Range!”

“So, if that's the case, he can only place his hopes for Foundation Establishment on the Myriad Demon Mountain Range?”

Talisman Master Wang nodded: “It seems that's the only way!”

There are many spirit veins in the Myriad Demon Mountain Range, which also produce Heaven Spirit Flowers. However, finding a Heaven Spirit Flower through this method is extraordinarily difficult, because Heaven Spirit Flowers are also crucial for demon beasts. First-tier demon beasts primarily rely on consuming Heaven Spirit Flowers to advance to the second tier.

Of course, besides Heaven Spirit Flowers, there is another avenue. Over thousands of years, through the continuous research of various alchemy grandmasters, cultivators have indeed discovered another path for refining Foundation Establishment Pills: using demon cores!

Foundation Establishment Pills can also be refined using demon cores as the main ingredient, and their effect is no worse than those made with Heaven Spirit Flowers. However, demon cores are usually only found within third-tier Great Demons, which are powerful demon beasts comparable to Golden Core cultivators. Humans would never dare to plot against them.

But occasionally, some exceptionally talented second-tier demon beasts unexpectedly develop a “pseudo-demon core” within them. These pseudo-demon cores can also be used to refine Foundation Establishment Pills.

Normally, for a Qi Condensation cultivator to challenge a Foundation Establishment expert is simply wishful thinking. But while humans at the Foundation Establishment stage are unbeatable, second-tier demon beasts still offer a ray of hope. Although second-tier demon beasts have higher intelligence than first-tier ones, their intelligence is ultimately limited; they still fall within the category of wild beasts and cannot compare to humans.

In fact, Lu Xu came to Wanxian City for this very reason. He placed his hope for Foundation Establishment on the Myriad Demon Mountain Range. Whether it was to search for Heaven Spirit Flowers in a spirit vein within the mountains or to refine Foundation Establishment Pills using pseudo-demon cores, he would have to deal with demon beasts. Wanxian City is the most prevalent place for demon hunting in the Eastern Barren Lands.

“Fellow Daoist Wen is currently recruiting people to form a demon hunting team. To be honest, if I hadn't already passed the age for Foundation Establishment, I might have been tempted to join!”

“Alas, if only we had been born into those major forces, we wouldn't have to worry about such matters!” Talisman Master Wang sighed.

“Our origins are not something we can decide. Since we don't have the innate conditions, we can only fight for our lives in the later stages!”

“That's true. Oh, by the way, the five-year small auction in Wanxian City is in just over ten days. Does Brother Han plan to attend?”

“I'll see how things are. Perhaps I'll go then!” Lu Xu deliberated before replying.

Wanxian City regularly holds auctions. Small auctions are held every five years, and large auctions every thirty years. Small auctions are generally attended by Qi Condensation cultivators, while large auctions usually see the appearance of more than one Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Lu Xu certainly didn't want to miss such a grand event, but he preferred to go alone, so he gave Talisman Master Wang an ambiguous answer.

“Hmm, in that case, I won't invite Brother Han to go with me!” Talisman Master Wang understood his meaning and didn't insist, stroking his long beard with a smile.

After leaving Talisman Master Wang, Lu Xu mused:

“Even at a small auction, there will occasionally be some characters rarely seen elsewhere. This is a good opportunity to copy experiences!”

“First, I'll recharge my spirit stones and be ready!”

Upon returning home, Lu Xu immediately took out a large pile of spirit stones. He currently had four thousand four hundred low-grade spirit stones and two mid-grade spirit stones. Lu Xu unhesitatingly directly charged one thousand four hundred spirit stones to the Azure Stone Tablet.

Afterward, he quietly waited for the auction to arrive.
