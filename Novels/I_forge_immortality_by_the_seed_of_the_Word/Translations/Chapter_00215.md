Chapter 213: True Disciple Visits

Inside the palace in the central area of the immortal island.

Zhang Jing sat cross-legged on a futon.

Behind him, twenty-four layers of Heavenly Worlds overlapped, forming complex phantoms and rings of immortal light imbued with immense, profound energy. These subtly connected to the void spanning tens of thousands of miles around him.

With each breath, boundless void was refined into a vast quantity of immortal energy!

Immortal light swirled and diffused, and grand Dao sounds echoed within, seemingly expounding infinite wondrous laws and immortal principles.

At a certain moment, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes.

In his gaze, a subtle, terrifying essence of the supreme, indifferent, and unkind Heavenly Dao flickered, only to disappear in an instant.

"The twenty-four layers of Heavenly Worlds have all been fully integrated into me. According to the Twenty-Four Heavenly Divine Ability's inheritance, this signifies reaching the perfected realm."

"But—"

Zhang Jing's eyes flickered slightly.

A majestic aura suddenly erupted from his body, manifesting from nothing in an instant and then rapidly expanding as if limitless.

This aura clearly originated from the twenty-four Heavenly Worlds behind him.

With a thought, the jade talisman in his Niwan Palace trembled slightly.

[Twenty-Four Heavens · Level 9 (2,798,130,000 / 3,000,000,000)]
Skill Properties: Primordial Immortal Core (Immortal), Void Furnace (Immortal), Small World Fetus Membrane (Immortal)

Looking at the skill information displayed on the jade talisman, Zhang Jing pondered.

In reality, when he upgraded the Twenty-Four Heavens skill to Level 9, he had already condensed the twenty-four layers of Heavenly Worlds, which was the 'perfected realm' mentioned in the inheritance.

However, he was still short by a full three billion experience points to evolve it into an Immortal Seed.

Three billion experience points!

This was far more than all the experience points Zhang Jing had consumed throughout the entire process of upgrading it from not even initiated to its current Level 9.

"Fortunately, I gained enough Destiny in the last Proud Cloud Secret Realm, otherwise..."

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but shake his head.

The path he had chosen, or rather, planned for his advancement to the Golden Core realm, consumed an overly terrifying amount of resources.

Fifty billion Destiny!

That was more than enough for an ordinary cultivator to cultivate from the Qi Refining realm all the way to the Dao Integration realm.

Yet, for him, it was barely enough to cultivate one Immortal Seed essential for advancement.

The disparity was immense.

He exhaled a turbid breath, a contemplative look flashing in his eyes.

"I still need two hundred million experience points to transform the Twenty-Four Heavens into an Immortal Seed, and from the looks of it now, it will most likely directly become an Eighth-Grade Immortal Seed."

"And I still have a little over five hundred million Destiny left, which would be enough if I used it all to purchase Cosmic River Gold Crystal."

"But..."

Zhang Jing's brows furrowed slightly, seemingly having thought of something.

Lately, all Cosmic River Gold Crystals whose auctions had recently ended had been bought by him.

As for the Cosmic River Gold Crystals currently still being auctioned, even the earliest ones wouldn't conclude their bidding for another two and a half years.

With his advancement to the Golden Core realm imminent, Zhang Jing no longer wished to wait.

As for the "Buy It Now" option, he hadn't even considered it.

After all, he had participated in so many auctions. He naturally understood the intricacies involved.

Unlike other cheap resources, when it came to precious treasures like Cosmic River Gold Crystal, the "Buy It Now" price set by sellers typically far exceeded the item's actual value.

Buying at the "Buy It Now" price would truly make him a fool.

Though he was anxious, he wouldn't joke around with his Destiny.

"So..."

Zhang Jing seemed to have an idea, and his mind returned to the jade talisman.

[General: 537,120,000]

"Although the general experience points converted from source energy are extraordinary, I still need to actually use them to see their effect."

"Besides, using them on the Twenty-Four Heavens skill at its current stage wouldn't be a waste."

With this thought, a hint of determination, along with a trace of anticipation, flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

With a thought, the 'General Experience' entry on the jade talisman began to flicker.

However, the next moment, "Is Junior Brother Zhang Jing present? Please come out for a word."

A voice like a clear spring gently resonated in his ears.

Zhang Jing's expression shifted.

That voice was—Senior Sister Kong?

Why would she be here?

By all accounts, she should be participating in that so-called 'Welcoming Immortal Banquet' at this time.

Zhang Jing felt a little confused but didn't dwell on it.

The terrifying fluctuations of spiritual power surging from him gradually subsided, and at the same time, the Twenty-Four Heavens behind him gradually dissipated and vanished.

Subsequently, a bright spiritual light flashed through the cultivation chamber.

On the futon, Zhang Jing's figure had already disappeared.

...

Not long after.

In the palace's reception hall, the atmosphere was incredibly silent.

Nine figures sat upright, each radiating strands of immense and boundless aura, except for Zhang Jing. Some exuded Dao Domains, others Indestructible Bodies, or even Primordial Black Holes...

Terrifying auras intertwined, threatening to suffocate Zhang Jing.

"Haha, Junior Brother, these are all the true disciples of our Crimson Bright Grand Haze Grotto-Heaven, your Senior Brothers and Sisters. We heard that Junior Brother has been accepted by our Master and ascended to true disciple status, so we specially came to visit."

Feng Wuyu, one of the two figures seated at the head of the table, slowly rose, walked forward, and said with a smile to Zhang Jing.

His voice broke the silence in the room.

At the same time, the oppressive aura in the reception hall completely dissipated.

"Senior Brother will introduce them to you."

"Thank you, Senior Brother."

Zhang Jing immediately let out a breath of relief, then rose and followed behind Feng Wuyu, expressing his gratitude.

"Haha, Junior Brother, no need to be so polite."

...

A few moments later.

"This is Senior Sister Kong. Junior Brother, you've already met her in the Ancestral Court, so Senior Brother won't introduce her much."

Feng Wuyu said with a chuckle.

"Zhang Jing greets Senior Sister Kong."

A faint smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face as he spoke, neither humble nor overbearing.

Across from him, Senior Sister Kong smiled in response, "Junior Brother, you are too polite."

...

"This is your Third Senior Brother, Jian Zhongfu."

...

"This is your Fourth Senior Sister, Zhai Sha."

...

"This is your Senior Brother Lu Yuanxuan."

...

...

After a brief round of introductions, Zhang Jing had finally met eight true disciples, including Senior Brother Feng Wuyu.

These eight were the actual helmsmen of various affairs within the Crimson Bright Grand Haze Grotto-Heaven, and even within the entire Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect, they were formidable figures.

Looking at the eight Senior Brothers and Sisters before him, Zhang Jing instantly understood.

It was quite clear.

Among them, the four formal direct disciples of their Master held the highest status, while the remaining four true disciples, who were the Master's registered disciples, held a considerably lower status.

Of course, among the nine true disciples of the Grotto-Heaven currently, he, Zhang Jing, held the lowest status.

However, Zhang Jing was not surprised by this.

After all, with his cultivation level, being able to sit at the same table as these Dao Integration realm Senior Brothers and Sisters was already due to the prestige of being a formal direct disciple of their Master.

As Zhang Jing pondered, Senior Sister Kong's gaze softly fell upon him, and she spoke softly:

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, I came today mainly because of the 'Welcoming Immortal Banquet' held by those Junior Brothers below."

"Welcoming Immortal Banquet?" Zhang Jing asked, surprised.

Hadn't he already sent Lu Sanba there? And with the Dao Seal representing his true disciple status, there shouldn't have been any mishaps.

Meeting Zhang Jing's gaze, a hint of apology flashed across Senior Sister Kong's face.

The next moment, she spoke frankly:

"Senior Sister won't hide it from Junior Brother. This 'Welcoming Immortal Banquet' was orchestrated by Junior Brother Jun and a few other unruly Dharma Manifestation realm disciples from our Heavenly Realm lineage. Its aim was to embarrass Junior Brother Zhang Jing in public."

"It's all due to Senior Sister's lax discipline, which caused Junior Brother and your mount to suffer injustice."

"Therefore, hearing that Junior Brother likes immortal roots and spiritual plants, Junior Brother Jian, Junior Sister Zhai, and I have specially prepared some immortal root seeds. We hope Junior Brother Zhang Jing won't stoop to their level."

She paused, then added:

"Especially Junior Brother Jun, his family has an ancestor who is a Heavenly Immortal True Monarch, so he's been spoiled since he was young. His actions can sometimes be a bit extreme. We hope Junior Brother will absolutely not blame him."

Upon hearing this, the smile on Zhang Jing's face gradually faded.

"May I ask, Senior Sister, did they lay hands on Junior Brother's mount, Lu Sanba?"

His voice carried a hint of coldness.
