# Chapter 237: The Misty Rain Building Is Operating—Everyone on the Ground, Hands on Your Heads!

Mu Rongxiao had been captured by the rebel general from the South?

Li Mo fell into deep thought.

Wait, why was Junior Brother Mu even in Yunzhou? And he just happened to run into a rebel general?

In a way, that was pretty lucky.

"Chang Bolong should have just kept running. Why did he have to capture Mu Rongxiao? Isn't that just adding a burden to himself?" Qian Bufan felt exhausted.

The group had been about to return to Ziyang Prefecture, but this incident had thrown a wrench in their plans.

"We followed the External Affairs Steward of Sword City to search for a long time, but we couldn't find any trace of them," Xue Jing said with a frown. "I don't even know if that kid Mu Rongxiao is still alive..."

"Every profession has its own expertise. Searching for people isn't what swordsmen are good at," Li Mo analyzed after a moment of contemplation. "Chang Bolong is being hunted by the government, yet he insists on taking Mu Rongxiao with him. This means he has other plans, such as..."

Shang Wu's beautiful eyes widened. "Such as liking handsome, dashing young men? Then you, my precious disciple, need to be careful."

Li Mo: "..."

Setting aside the fact that his Master's speculation was utterly ridiculous...

He actually didn't mind hearing that.

Seeing his beautiful Master getting serious, Li Mo took out a bottle of aged wine and placed it in her hand. "We can't rule out that possibility."

Shang Wu snorted, indicating that as long as she was around, she would definitely protect her precious disciple.

Li Mo continued, "But then again, we don't need to worry too much about Mu Rongxiao's safety. Our primary goal right now is to find them."

Everyone nodded. Senior Brother Li's analysis made sense. When Li Mo got serious, he was reliable. They suddenly felt like they had a backbone.

Ying Bing slightly lowered her head, her eyes reflecting the image of the young man speaking confidently. She quietly poured a cup of tea and placed it by his hand.

Qian Bufan said, "We can ask the fellow cultivators from Sword City to help. They would certainly not shirk the responsibility, but right now, we can't even find the trail of Chang Bolong's group."

The swordsmen were all powerful and loved to show off in splendid clothes and on fine horses. However, they disdained doing things like gathering intelligence or tracking. They would pick a rooftop under a clear breeze and bright moon to spar; how could you expect them to lie in a gutter like bounty hunters or disguise themselves as street beggars to search for information?

Sword City was willing to help, but only limited to fighting.

"Yunzhou isn't Ziyang Prefecture after all. We can't make a big move here," Xue Jing nodded.

"Actually, the solution is right before our eyes," Li Mo suddenly said with a smile.

Everyone was stunned.

They saw him walk out to the street and shout loudly, "Brothers, new job!"

In an instant, the originally bustling street fell silent. Countless peddlers, porters, and street performers all stopped what they were doing. Even the old men playing chess and the beggars with crippled legs stood up and lined up in front of the tavern.

"Master Li, your orders."

"Just say the word, who do we kill?"

"How do you want it done? Chopped into fine mince?"

The entrance to the tavern was filled with enthusiasm. The assassins were full of motivation and a thirst for performance. They were truly a group of hardworking, ambitious individuals striving to get rich through diligence.

"Ahem, I'll keep it brief. My bounty was withdrawn not long ago, but I haven't actually canceled the reward yet, so..."

Watching Li Mo lecture a group of assassins, the people inside the tavern were lost in thought. If an outsider saw this, they would think Li Mo was the branch master of the Misty Rain Building in Yunzhou. Even for them, they were starting to have illusions. We are the Qingyuan Sect, a famous orthodox sect!

Not long after, Little Li had arranged for the assassins to disperse. He was about to return to the tavern to discuss the matter further with everyone.

"Brother Li."

A voice suddenly came from behind him. It was a sallow-faced middle-aged man.

---

"I'm Huang Donglai."

Huang Donglai was afraid Li Mo wouldn't recognize him, so he restored his original voice.

"So it's Brother Huang. Are you here to stay? I'm afraid I don't have the time to entertain you right now..."

"No, I came to lend Brother Li a hand," Huang Donglai cupped his fists and said seriously. "Tracking minute clues is also my strong suit."

"You're also skilled in this area?"

"Yes, I have some experience, especially in how to destroy evidence and hide one's tracks."

"..."

Li Mo looked at the middle-aged man Huang Donglai had disguised himself as. If he hadn't used his Destiny Divine Eye, even he wouldn't have been able to tell. It was clear that Huang Donglai truly had some professional skills. He was a rare talent.

...

While undercurrents were surging in the city, a certain temple was exceptionally quiet at this moment. Located in the suburbs of Yunzhou, it wasn't particularly popular, but with its green waters and lush mountains, it was a rare place for quiet cultivation.

However...

Now, from the abbot down to the novice monks, everyone had been replaced.

*Squeak*— After sending off the last group of pilgrims, a "monk" closed the heavy temple gates, then kicked aside a wooden fish that was in his way and walked up to the abbot.

"General..."

"Hmm?"

The thick-browed abbot opened his eyes slightly, filled with malice.

The "monk" quickly corrected himself, "Abbot, we're pretending to be monks here, eating tofu and cabbage every day. My mouth is about to淡出鳥來 (bored out of its mind). When can we go back?"

It turned out the original monks of the "Jinguang Temple" had all met their demise. The temple had been taken over by a group of rebels.

"What's your hurry?" Chang Bolong snorted. "Right now, Yunzhou City is on high alert. We can't leave for the time being, so we have to stay here and wait for the wind to die down. Those swordsmen from Yunzhou are all arrogant fools, obsessed with showing off. Even if their brains exploded, they wouldn't think we've 'become monks.'

"Besides, the 'High God' has sent down a decree," he said, glancing at the Buddha statue behind him with a grin. "We have already found the God-Child for the High God. The Church will reward us for this. Once we get through this period, it'll be like a bird flying high in the sky. We'll never have to suffer in that godforsaken land of the South again."

Hearing this, the "monks" all beamed with joy.

"With the General's merit, you should at least be promoted to a Hall Protector."

"The Church is great. The bottleneck I've been stuck at for five years was broken yesterday."

"Hahaha, how could those stupid swordsmen from Yunzhou ever find us?"

"Wait, don't you think... this incense is a bit too fragrant?"

"It is too fragrant... It's making me a bit dizzy..."

...

At that moment, Chang Bolong, disguised as the temple abbot, suddenly sensed something was wrong and held his breath.

"The incense is poisoned!" he roared.

The next moment...

*BOOM!*— The temple gates were kicked open.

"The Misty Rain Building is operating! Everyone on the ground, hands on your heads!"

The "Monks": "?"

What the hell? The Misty Rain Building?

Wait a minute.

This scene of kicking the door open... why does it look so familiar?

Even though they were fugitives now, they used to be official soldiers, proper military men who ate government rations...

In the past, they were the ones kicking down other people's doors. Now, they were being kicked out by a group of assassins? It was just... suddenly hairless.

...

PS: Sorry for being a bit late today. I spent the afternoon writing a detailed outline and sorting out the plot for the trip to the South. Mwah!
