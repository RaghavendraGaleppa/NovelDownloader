# Chapter 149: The Sword Cultivator  

Five days passed, and the formation of the Seven Stars Island was completely restored.  

With a surge of energy, seven points of starlight lit up across the island, connecting together to form a protective barrier around the entire Seven Stars Island.  

Li Shiming and Yin Shilan had stayed behind precisely to witness this moment. Only after confirming that the island's formation was fully operational could they return.  

"I'll take Lan'er back first!" Elder Yin appeared beside Yin Shilan and said solemnly to Zhuge Xuan.  

Zhuge Xuan bowed in agreement, while Li Shiming helplessly made a hand gesture to Yin Shilan—a secret signal they had agreed upon to communicate via their identity jade slips once they were back within the sect's territory.  

Elder Yin pretended not to notice the exchange between the two youths and vanished into the sky with Yin Shilan.  

"Li Shiming, let's go too!" Zhuge Xuan patted Li Shiming on the shoulder with a smile.  

This mission had brought them closer, and Zhuge Xuan no longer treated Li Shiming as a junior but rather as an equal—especially since Elder Yin had allowed Li Shiming to address him as "Uncle." Zhuge Xuan wasn't foolish enough to risk offending Elder Yin by acting superior.  

"Shiming, have you reached the advanced level?" On the flying boat, now that their mission was complete, Zhuge Xuan relaxed and let the vessel fly on autopilot as he asked with a grin.  

During their time on Seven Stars Island, he had noticed something unusual about Li Shiming's speed in repairing formations. Even sections involving advanced formations didn't require his intervention—Li Shiming only needed time to study them before resolving the issues himself.  

"I'm not sure," Li Shiming replied, still somewhat unclear about the standards for an advanced formation master. The sect's three senior formation masters had never explicitly explained the criteria.  

"Can your Stellar Sea of Formations operate autonomously now?" Zhuge Xuan turned to him and asked.  

Li Shiming nodded. His Stellar Sea of Formations had indeed achieved self-sustaining operation, even forming an independent cosmic star chart.  

"Once we return, I'll arrange for Senior Brother Chang and Senior Sister Song to test you. After you're certified as an advanced formation master, you'll gain access to the sect's core knowledge of formations!" Zhuge Xuan said with evident delight.  

He was genuinely pleased. With only three advanced formation masters in the sect, he and the other two had been overwhelmed with work. The repair and maintenance of the sect's grand formation had been a constant struggle.  

More importantly, Li Shiming was still young and had immense potential to become a formation grandmaster. If that happened, the sect's formation studies might even regain their former glory.  

The more Zhuge Xuan looked at Li Shiming, the more he admired him. Such a prodigy was a blessing for the Tianhai Sect.  

The flying boat sped across the sea when suddenly, a sword light flashed. In an instant, the vessel shattered into fragments.  

The sword light swept over Zhuge Xuan and Li Shiming, pausing briefly as if hesitating before piercing Zhuge Xuan's heart.  

This was the first time Li Shiming had witnessed a fellow sect elder being killed right before his eyes. Zhuge Xuan's life force vanished the moment the sword light entered his body. As the blade exited his back, his body disintegrated into a mist of blood.  

The power of the sword light was on an entirely different level from Zhuge Xuan's, leaving him no chance to retaliate or even identify his attacker before he was slain.  

A chill ran down Li Shiming's spine. An overwhelming pressure immobilized him, preventing even his spiritual sense from extending beyond his body.  

His thoughts turned to Yin Shilan—she would surely grieve if he died.  

He thought of Ren Fei'er, who might resent him for breaking his promise.  

He thought of his father, of Si Qin and Mo Yan—he wondered how they had been all these years.  

As these thoughts raced through his mind, the sword light reached him. Just as he braced for death, it suddenly carried him into the sea.  

The sword light transformed into a barrier, parting the water as they descended over a hundred meters to the seabed.  

The light burrowed through the sand and mud, entering a hidden chamber—a makeshift cave dwelling.  

Li Shiming observed carefully. It was common for cultivators to carve out temporary shelters, given how easily they could cut through stone with magic tools and store excavated material in spatial pouches.  

But creating a cave in the seabed's soft mud was no small feat.  

Li Shiming had done something similar before, though in much shallower waters and on rocky terrain.  

This cave, however, was dug directly into the mud, solidified to withstand the immense water pressure over a hundred meters deep.  

Despite the danger, his analytical mind couldn't help but ponder these details.  

The sword light dissipated, dropping Li Shiming onto the ground. Before him sat a figure in meditation.  

Even seated, the man exuded an aura as sharp as a blade—a terrifying, murderous sword.  

Li Shiming's first thought was of the golden core sword cultivator who had left the five massive gashes on Seven Stars Island. The only person who could kill a Tianhai Sect elder—an advanced formation master—so close to the sect's waters had to be that very sword cultivator.  

The unimaginable power of that sword light, which had slain Zhuge Xuan without resistance, only reinforced this conclusion.  

Their flying boat had simply been unlucky enough to pass over the sword cultivator's hideout, drawing his lethal attention.  

What Li Shiming didn't understand was why he had been brought here alive.  

Yun Xingyi ignored the newly captured Qi Refining cultivator for now. Activating his sword light had aggravated his injuries, preventing him from dealing with the young man immediately.  

Not that he was worried—even injured, a mere thought could obliterate the Qi Ref
