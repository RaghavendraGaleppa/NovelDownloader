# Chapter 555: Blood Elder Devil

"This is the Taihua Spirit Void Realm!

With such abundant spiritual energy, as long as I cultivate step by step, reaching Foundation Establishment should be no problem..."

Han Shi's heart filled with understanding, and for the first time, true hope appeared on his withered face.

However, this hope vanished in an instant, covered by deeper worry.

He furrowed his brows tightly.

"The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Art is indeed marvelous and unfathomable, known as the supreme foundation of the sword path, but it ultimately stops at the Qi Refining level.

Without a corresponding Foundation Establishment realm sword art, even with sufficient spiritual energy, it would be like a tree without roots, unable to break through the bottleneck..."

"Xu! Yun! Fan!"

This name, like a blood curse, was squeezed out from between his teeth.

A torrent of hatred, suppressed for nearly a hundred years, instantly shattered the joy of his newfound vitality. In his eyes, honed by time to only reveal ruthlessness, a cold light shone like a sword, almost ready to devour someone.

"If not for that bastard's harm, how could I, Han Shi, have been trapped in this spirit-dead wasteland for nearly a hundred years, wasting my origin, my lifespan nearing its end! This仇 is irreconcilable!"

With his temperament, how could he be willing to be someone else's clone?

As long as he killed Xu Yunfan, he would be the legitimate one!

At the moment this hatred surged, Han Shi's mind suddenly stirred.

He turned his head sharply, his gaze as sharp as a sword piercing through the void, looking towards a distant direction.

There, a vast, boundless sword intent soared into the sky, as if wanting to pierce the nine heavens and sweep across the universe.

Its piercing purity, domineering and righteous will, like an invisible magnet, attracted the resonating Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Intent within his body.

"It's the direction of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect's sword domain, the location of the mountain gate."

Han Shi instantly understood. The ruthlessness in his eyes did not diminish, but a hint of wild joy and ambition flashed through them.

"Although my hair and beard are white, and my vitality has slightly declined, my sword heart is clear, and my realm remains.

With this sword foundation, entering the mountain gate should be no problem."

Without any further hesitation, he concealed all his emotions beneath his icy sword intent.

The sword light around him flared brightly, no longer dim, trailing a long rainbow of sword energy as he tore through the air, heading straight for the mountain gate of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect where the sword intent pierced the sky.

"It's done."

Xu Yunfan's lips curved slightly. This operation required considerable effort. Not only did he need to use the Primordial Sect's界 Gate to precisely locate the spatial node to open the way, but he also had to construct an imperceptible "Barrier of Perception," making Han Shi's clone believe it was his own sword dao that had advanced and his inspiration that had flourished, naturally choosing this path to join the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

With Han Shi's current sword dao talent, supplemented by the authentic "Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Art," entering the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect should not be difficult.

When the time comes, once the opportunity arises, it will naturally cause a great upheaval.

For now, let's not worry about it.

Xu Yunfan shifted his gaze.

At the same time, in the Eastern Wastelands, his clone, Sun Wukong, followed the group of four, Tang Sanzang and his disciples. Through tribulations, the ritual of the King Buddha was nearing completion.

A grand, compassionate, yet supremely dignified aura was quietly brewing in the Eastern Wastelands.

Xu Yunfan could clearly perceive that once the ritual was completely finished, with golden light soaring into the sky and Buddhist sounds cleansing the world, it would be like a boulder thrown into a calm lake, instantly stirring up the winds and clouds of the Three Sects and attracting the attention of countless gazes.

When the situation becomes chaotic, it will be a great opportunity to fish in troubled waters and obtain what is needed.

After all, although the position of the Self-Existing King Buddha is watched by the World Honored One Tathagata, the other two sects also have Dao Lords. It won't be so easy to manipulate.

That will also be an opportunity.

It seems I must抓紧 cultivation and reach the peak of Foundation Establishment.

It seems that seclusion can only be temporarily put on hold. I need to find opportunities outside to increase my Daoist cultivation.

It would be best to obtain some heavenly treasures and spiritual herbs to refine the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiends. These are the best supplements for increasing proficiency.

"Xu Yunfan! Get out here and accept death!"

Just as Xu Yunfan was calculating in his heart and secretly anticipating the changes in the Eastern Wastelands, a sharp, chilling voice, like a knife scraping bone, filled with boundless rage, suddenly pierced through the layers of restrictions on the Divine Thunder Peak and the ceaseless sound of the Divine Thunder, crashing heavily against the entire mountain.

The late Foundation Establishment pressure contained within the voice was like a substance, crashing down with a rumble.

Rumble!

The thick thunder clouds that perennially lingered above the Divine Thunder Peak, as if stirred by an invisible giant hand, churned violently.

The protective array shield covering the entire peak suddenly blazed with dazzling light, rippling in large patches, emitting a low, strained hum.

The fine thunder runes carved on the cliff face lit up one after another, like a prairie fire, barely resisting this terrifying pressure that felt like mountains collapsing and seas overturning.

Disciples working in the various cave abodes and spirit fields within the peak, refining fire and forging artifacts, suddenly changed color under this terrifying pressure.

Many refining furnaces were destroyed in this pressure.

"Ah!"

"Pfft!"

"Enemy attack!"

Qi Refining disciples, as if struck by an invisible giant hammer, felt their chests tighten and couldn't breathe. Those with weaker cultivation had their knees go weak, their faces turning deathly pale. Some even had blood trickle from the corners of their mouths as they stumbled and fell.

Disciples like Bi Yuan, at the late Qi Refining stage, felt as if they were carrying a ten-thousand-jun mountain. Veins bulged on their foreheads as the true energy in their bodies frantically circulated to resist the omnipresent pressure, the light of their protective artifacts flickering rapidly.

They艰难地 raised their heads, looking towards the terrifying figure outside the peak, like a blood sun descending, their eyes filled with unconcealed horror.

"Late Foundation Establishment! It's that Blood Elder Devil from the Scripture Pavilion!"

A supervising disciple's voice trembled as he recognized the visitor's identity.

The Blood Elder Devil's notoriety was well-known. His cultivation method was sinister and cruel, his personality twisted and perverse, and he was a notorious煞 Star within the sect.

Bi Yuan wiped the bloodstain from the corner of his mouth, his eyes showing no retreat, but instead surging with a fierce determination.

He roared, "Activate the Minor Heavenly Thunder Induction Array within the peak to protect the low-cultivation disciples! Disciples of the Divine Thunder Peak, heed the order! Form the array!"

He didn't care who the visitor was or how high their cultivation was. As long as the Divine Thunder Peak still stood, the sect's rules and regulations remained.

At this moment, whether inner or outer sect disciples on the Divine Thunder Peak, facing this terrifying enemy far beyond their level, not a single one fled in panic. Instead, they gritted their teeth, enduring the immense pressure, and艰难地 gathered, attempting to form a weak defensive formation. The faint thunder energy within their bodies resonated with each other, revealing a moving unity against the enemy amidst despair.

They knew very well that this resistance was like an ant trying to shake a tree before a late Foundation Establishment cultivator.

But they had to unite. If they scattered, they would only be easily killed by the other party. It was better to rely on the Divine Thunder Array laid down by the Divine Thunder Peak Master to struggle for a while.

Deep within the cave abode, Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow upon hearing the sound.

The chilling, bone-deep killing intent from the outside, the familiar foul bloody aura, the violent tremors of the Divine Thunder Peak's array, and the faint resonance from the disciples desperately forming their阵, all clearly reflected in his sea of consciousness.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but nod slightly, and he couldn't help but赞叹 a few times in his heart.

The disciples he had opened the Divine Thunder脉 for were all clever fellows.

Indeed, those who could survive until now were not fools.

His eyes were as calm as an ancient well, without any surprise. After a slight calculation, he understood in his heart.

The little incident in front of the Scripture Pavilion had indeed brought the main character.
