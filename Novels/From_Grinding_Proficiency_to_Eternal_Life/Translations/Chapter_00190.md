# Chapter 190: The Final Step

The medicinal herbs in the medicine pool had already been cleared three times today.

For the past month, Xu Yunfan had been using the ginseng qi emanating from the Ginseng Baby as a foundation. His Pure Yang One Qi Technique had already surpassed eighty percent, reaching 835 proficiency points. He was only a thousand points away from the Great Completion realm. With at most half a month of effort, he would be able to enter the Great Completion realm of the Three External Unifications.

By then, entering the Muscle Refining realm would be a natural progression.

For this reason, Xu Yunfan had not slept or rested for half a month. During the day, he practiced the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, causing his muscles, bones, and skin to be washed by his Pure Yang internal qi until they felt swollen and distended.

He would then take a breath of ginseng qi to practice the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique.

Whether it was the Black Steel Hundred Tempering Body, the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength, or the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique, he could now execute their moves separately, and his progress was gratifying.

At night, Xu Yunfan would cultivate the "Lin" Character Mantra using the wisp of ginseng qi that the Ginseng Baby spat out with a grimace. Although his proficiency only increased by one or two points every couple of days, he was already very satisfied, considering that he wasn't gaining any proficiency at all before.

Although he had not truly entered the Muscle Refining realm during this period, his strength had advanced by leaps and bounds. Compared to himself a month ago, the difference was like heaven and earth. The Three External Unions were only one step away from being integrated.

Half a month, at most half a month. Optimistically, he might even enter the Muscle Refining realm in less than ten days.

After Pei Yan and Qi Huan invited him to the various sects' martial exhibition, and Xu Yunfan refused, Hong Baichuan personally came to mention it as well.

Seeing that Xu Yunfan did not want to go, he did not insist, only saying that if Xu Yunfan changed his mind, he could let him know anytime within half a month.

Fu Jin did not want Xu Yunfan to be wandering around outside after reaching the Three External Unifications realm. At this stage, one could not advance bravely through battle alone; instead, one needed to constantly ponder the feeling of blending the three types of training—muscles, bones, and skin—into one furnace.

Seven days ago, Qi Huan and Pei Yan left the Heavenly Work Cave and went to the Green岳州 (Qingyue Province).

Xiao Yuwei wanted to go, but her master pulled her down into the ore vein to absorb the Geng Metal Qi. Aside from Xu Yunfan, who could absorb the Primordial Spirit Qi, only Yan Yuwei successfully attracted the spiritual qi by relying on the Heavenly Work Qi Absorption Technique passed down by the Heavenly Work Cave.

Because of this, she might be able to push one of the three trainings—muscles, bones, or skin—to perfection. Naturally, the Hall Master of the Melting Gold Hall, Chu Xu, would not let Yan Yuwei run around recklessly.

Having not slept for over forty days and nights, Xu Yunfan relied entirely on the secret technique of the "Lin" Character Mantra to lock in his spirit and maintain his state.

He had reached his limit now. At this moment, the hundred bones of his body were trembling slightly, barely under his control.

Although he still felt energetic, with a sharp light in his eyes, an extreme sense of exhaustion welled up from the depths of his soul. The fishy, sweet taste of blood seeping from under his tongue reminded him that if he continued, his spirit and will would completely collapse.

He needed to sleep.

After washing his body, Xu Yunfan glanced at the vest he was wearing, which was woven from the Extreme Dao Remnant.

"Hey, you wicked woman, here comes your grandpa!"

Xu Yunfan fell into a deep sleep.

The moonlight was brilliant, like mercury pouring onto the ground, covering the earth with a faint layer of lunar brilliance.

Under the quilt, the Extreme Dao Remnant that was wrapped around him like a vest suddenly moved. It slid open smoothly and silently, completely covering Xu Yunfan once more. If one didn't look closely, it would seem as if a naked woman with skin like cream was tightly clinging to him, motionless.

Xu Yunfan's eyelids had just parted halfway when an inverted mountain peak pierced his pupils.

Thirty-six thousand green peaks, like spears and halberds thrown by a god, pointed their jagged summits towards the blood-red sky. Ice crystals condensed at the roots of the mountains, reflecting an otherworldly sapphire blue.

His bronze-colored chest heaved violently. He found that even the white mist he exhaled was drifting against gravity. Every grain of dust here defied the laws of nature.

*Zheng!*

A familiar sword cry erupted from the depths of the inverted mountain range.

The bulging veins on Xu Yunfan's body suddenly stiffened. He saw the mountains piercing the clouds beginning to disintegrate: the shedding rock shells turned into scales, the cold pool in the mountain gorge formed the sword's spine. Under the light lift of a woman's slender hand, the entire mountain range was reassembled into a colossal sword that spanned heaven and earth!

"You sure know how to pick a place."

Xu Yunfan laughed as he bent his knees and sank his waist. The blood and qi in his body churned in an instant, the muscles of his entire body swelled, and veins crisscrossed like roots. The volume of his muscles expanded several times beyond their normal state.

Two blood marks suddenly spread and crisscrossed beneath the skin of his raised right arm, like two blood pythons rapidly spreading to the back of his hand.

The moment the woman's sword finger fell, the ten-zhang-wide bedrock beneath his feet collapsed with a thunderous roar.

It wasn't shattered by the sky-piercing giant sword falling, but was crushed by the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength bursting from his spine, combined with the eruption of his Pure Yang internal qi.

The instant the inverted mountain sword qi fell, Xu Yunfan's knotted back muscles stretched out. He gripped the air in his hand, and the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer appeared. Pure Yang internal qi and Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength intermingled as his blood and qi surged.

At this moment, this precious artifact finally revealed its true, formidable power. With the momentum of a reversed celestial river, it carried a visible, turbid white shockwave and the power of thunder and fire, drawing a fiery red arc across the sky.

He used the counterforce to flow upward, tearing a blood-red path through the falling boulders weighing millions of tons.

Ripples finally appeared in the woman's eyes.

The massive mountain sword was shattered by him with a thunderous crash. Xu Yunfan was now drenched in blood, but his grin grew even more ferocious.

He weaponized the abnormal gravity of the inverted world. By deliberately holding back a third of his strength when kicking off the shattered rock, his spinning, uncontrolled body drew in air currents, deflecting the woman's subsequent three sword qi by half an inch.

As their figures crossed, the heavy hammer in his hand emitted a sound like a bell or chime.

"Got you!"

The next instant.

The entire inverted mountain range trembled collectively. The mountains enslaved by the woman's sword qi briefly revived amidst the roar of chains. The ancient earth脉 (dìmài) qi bursting from the depths of the rock strata collided violently with the Thunderfire Qilin Gangqi blooming from his fist.

The woman formed a sword seal with both hands for the first time.

As Xu Yunfan fell through the void amidst the shattered mountain cores, he suddenly saw the spot where her toes lightly touched—it was the central vital point of all the inverted mountain sword qi.

Xu Yunfan's vision went black.

*This is freaking cheating!*

When he woke up again, Xu Yunfan did not hesitate in the slightest.

"Lin!"

The syllable that vibrated his Adam's apple resonated with the flesh and blood of his entire body. His eyes, filled with an unquenchable fighting spirit, rapidly cooled down at this moment. Only the boiling blood in his body made him emit waves of furnace-like heat.

His bulging muscles quickly subsided. His knotted back muscles retracted and sheathed themselves like a receding tide. The surging veins turned into fine threads flowing beneath his skin.

He picked up the hammer with the precision of a carpenter's ink line, wasting not a shred of excess energy.

The woman in white, who saw this, looked at Xu Yunfan's transformation with a glimmer of light in her eyes.

"Do you know that if you use the 'Lin' Character Mantra too often, you will forever fall into the state of the Supreme's Forgetfulness?"

The woman in white spoke, her voice still carrying a hint of coldness, as if she were merely narrating an unimportant matter.

Xu Yunfan said nothing. The moment he raised his eyes, a ten-zhang aura of Gangfeng was fully retracted into his pupils.

Xu Yunfan heard the explosive sound of hematopoietic stem cells multiplying deep within his bone marrow and sensed the Pure Yang vortexes in his pores tearing at the air.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, light as a feather, horizontally blocked the center path. He pushed off with the arch of his foot, his body like a cannonball fired from its muzzle, charging at the woman in white.
