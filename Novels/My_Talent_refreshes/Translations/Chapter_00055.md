# Chapter 55: Successful Promotion

The crowd standing in the spirit fields began turning their heads to observe each other's progress. In truth, they had already been discreetly assessing one another during breaks between casting the Verdant Spring Technique. Many, especially those clearly falling behind, had already formed a rough idea of their standing.

Now that the assessment had truly concluded, as everyone began openly examining each other's cultivation results, complex expressions surfaced on many faces.

He Changyou didn't give them much time to wait. He walked into the fields, moving row by row. Those with mediocre results didn't even warrant a glance from him. Only those with passable achievements—including Chu Ning, Luo Hongping, Lu Yunfang, and others—made him pause briefly.

After completing his rounds, He Changyou returned to his original position. "The ten names I call, bring your Blood Sandalwood and come forward," his voice rang out again.

At this point, everyone understood—the six promotions would be selected from these ten. Immediately, those who had been scrutinized by He Changyou earlier wore expressions of nervousness, while most others showed varying degrees of disappointment.

"Lu Ming, Luo Hongping, Lu Yunfang, Chen Jinhua, Chu Ning, Jiang Dawei, Liu Qingshan..."

As He Changyou read the names, the ten individuals retrieved their Blood Sandalwood from the fields and stepped forward. The entire field buzzed with murmurs.

"Who's Luo Hongping? And Lu Yunfang—why haven't I heard of them before?"

"Those two were previously assigned to external cultivation families."

"Oh? And who's Chu Ning?"

"Never heard that name before. Completely unfamiliar."

Amidst the whispers, the ten stood in a line before He Changyou, who instructed them to place their Blood Sandalwood in front of them. "As fellow spirit planters, you may assess for yourselves whether there are any disparities."

Four of the ten immediately sighed, their expressions dimming. Though none of the Blood Sandalwoods had grown significantly in half a day, theirs were visibly shorter than the others'. Jiang Dawei, ranked sixth, glanced at Chu Ning with a mix of relief and astonishment—Chu Ning's Blood Sandalwood was slightly taller than his own, comparable even to the four senior disciples.

This didn't escape the notice of the others, including Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang, whose gazes eventually settled on Chu Ning.

He Changyou nodded approvingly at Chu Ning. "Impressive. Your spellcasting talent exceeds my expectations. For a fourth-level Qi Refiner to match your seniors is remarkable."

Chu Ning exhaled softly—his promotion to the C-tier was assured. Of course, what truly mattered wasn't the C-tier fields, but the talisman-crafting techniques that came with it.

He Changyou then announced loudly, "The C-tier promotion assessment concludes. The following six are promoted: Lu Ming, Luo Hongping, Lu Yunfang, Chen Jinhua, Jiang Dawei..."

Whether intentionally downplaying Chu Ning or highlighting the newcomer, He Changyou listed him last. As the first five names were called, the crowd's attention sharpened, waiting for the final announcement.

"Chu Ning!"

The fields erupted in murmurs.

"Who is Chu Ning? I've never heard of any outstanding D-tier disciple by that name."

Meanwhile, Shang Zhaoxiang and Cao Dongxin exchanged stunned glances. "Chu Ning... promoted to C-tier after just a year and a half in the sect?" Shang Zhaoxiang's words spread rapidly.

"A new disciple, advanced to C-tier in a year and a half? How monstrous is he? Is he even a pseudo-spiritual root disciple?"

With his enhanced spiritual sense, Chu Ning caught every whisper. He sighed inwardly. Despite striving for obscurity since joining the sect, this promotion had thrust him into the spotlight. 

*Well, I'll just have to be even more low-key from now on. With so many geniuses in Qingxi Sect, they'll forget about this mere labor disciple soon enough. At least I only revealed aptitude for wood-element spells—no cultivation level or other abilities were exposed.*

His thoughts were interrupted as He Changyou addressed the remaining disciples. "The rest of you must continue diligent practice without slackening." Turning to the promoted six, he added, "Report to the Spirit Planting Hall's training ground tomorrow morning for further instructions," before departing, followed by Zhuang Yunde.

Once they left, the crowd's attention—especially on Chu Ning—intensified. Among the candidates, he alone had joined the sect so recently. Under their envious or jealous stares, Chu Ning sighed again. He had no choice but to compete for the C-tier position. Without lingering, he collected his Blood Sandalwood and left swiftly.

After a short distance, he spotted two figures waiting—Shang Zhaoxiang and Cao Dongxin.

"Congratulations, Junior Brother Chu!" Shang Zhaoxiang greeted cheerfully. "To think you've progressed so far in just over a year."

Chu Ning clasped his hands modestly. "You flatter me, Senior Brother. It was merely luck."

"Pure skill, not luck," Shang Zhaoxiang countered, then gestured to Cao Dongxin. "We waited not just to congratulate you—Lao Cao has something to say."

Cao Dongxin's face twisted with conflict before he gritted his teeth. "Junior Brother Chu, I... I apologize for my past offenses. I hope you can overlook them."

Chu Ning was taken aback. He hadn't expected Cao Dongxin to seek him out for reconciliation. Clearly, his demonstrated prowess and promotion had forced Cao Dongxin to acknowledge his rising status.

*The cultivation world truly respects only strength,* Chu Ning mused. But as his gaze swept over Cao Dongxin, he stiffened. Beneath the surface, buried deep but detectable by Chu Ning's sharp perception, lurked jealousy—and something darker, more desperate.

*Then let's test him.*

Ignoring Cao Dongxin's apology, Chu Ning addressed only Shang Zhaoxiang. "Senior Brother Shang, the spellcasting has left me fatigued. I'll take my leave." He walked away, extending his spiritual sense to monitor the pair.

Behind him, Shang Zhaoxiang shook his head. "Lao Cao, you've misjudged him badly this time." Cao Dongxin's swarthy face darkened, a flash of venom crossing his features.

Chu Ning continued forward expressionlessly, but cold resolve solidified in his heart.
