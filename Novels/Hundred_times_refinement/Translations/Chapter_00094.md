# Chapter 44: Exposure

By chance, Lin Xuan overheard this significant secret and dared not even breathe loudly. Though only fragments of conversation, he could piece together the general sequence of events from the discussion between the Yan father and son.

The head of the Yan family was a master at the peak of the Lingdong stage, on the verge of stepping into the Foundation Establishment realm. Originally, he had planned for his son to take advantage of the disbanding of the Cloudsoar Sect to acquire a mid-level cultivation manual. However, Lin Xuan had beaten them to it.

This infuriated Yan Tianheng. The Yan family was only a mid-sized cultivation clan, lacking the influence to manipulate matters behind the scenes or make prior arrangements. With the only available mid-level manual falling into someone else's hands, Yan Tianheng had no choice but to take a desperate risk—ambushing another cultivation family and seizing their mid-level manual.

The Wang family, which had been robbed, was originally the largest cultivation family in the area. Their ancestor had been an elder of the Drifting Cloud Valley. Though they later branched out on their own, they maintained good relations with the sect. Moreover, the Wang family boasted over a hundred cultivators, including three Foundation Establishment experts, making them one of the most powerful families in the region.

However, misfortune struck. The three Wang elders were all at critical junctures in their cultivation. Besides, they never imagined anyone would dare attack their family. Thus, they only sent a few juniors to attend the gathering, giving Yan Tianheng the perfect opportunity to kill and steal.

Having analyzed the situation, Lin Xuan became even more cautious. He already had a grudge with Yan Ming, and now he had overheard their dirty secret. If discovered, they would surely silence him.

The Yan father and son were ruthless and far from virtuous, but their cultivation was formidable. Yan Tianheng was just one step away from Foundation Establishment, while Yan Ming had reached the fourth layer of cultivation, the same as Lin Xuan.

Of course, if things took a turn for the worst, Lin Xuan wouldn't just surrender. In a fight, he still had a sliver of hope. First, he had mastered the Ice Needle Technique—a mid-level spell, yet its power was no less than that of low-level ones. Second, he had collected numerous talismans, including over a hundred low-level ones from this trip and several mid-level ones inherited from Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan.

Lastly, there were the magical artifacts. Setting aside the other two, at least the Golden Binding Rope was something he had mastered. Though his Object Control Art could only unleash a fraction of its power, it could still serve as a trump card.

Despite his confidence, Lin Xuan had no intention of provoking a fight with two cultivators, especially one at the peak of the Lingdong stage. It was better to avoid trouble. Seeing that the two seemed prepared to camp here, Lin Xuan could only lament his bad luck—tonight, he'd have to sleep on a tree branch.

The cry of wild geese reached his ears. Yan Tianheng stood up, displeased with the taste of his rations. Since prey had come to him, he decided to hunt one for a better meal.

Seeing the man look up, Lin Xuan knew things had taken a turn for the worse. Without hesitation, he leaped down from the branch. This wasn't recklessness—if Yan Tianheng looked up, his concealment would be exposed given the man's cultivation. Rather than waiting in a disadvantageous position, it was better to strike first!

After all, he had overheard their secret. The Yan father and son would never let him walk away safely. Since conflict was inevitable, he might as well take the initiative.

The sudden appearance of someone in the tree startled the Yan father and son. When Yan Ming recognized Lin Xuan's face, he exclaimed, "Father! He—he's the one who used mid-grade pills to buy the manual!"

Before he could finish, crimson light flashed as several fireballs the size of basins hurtled toward him.

Lin Xuan unleashed Flame Talismans with one hand while preparing the Ice Bullet Technique with the other. With a hiss, the spells activated. Strangely, Lin Xuan also held a talisman in his mouth, which dissolved into smoke and seeped into the ground under spiritual power.

Yan Ming panicked. Though fire and ice were low-level spells, they could still kill him if they hit. In his fluster, the pampered young master revealed his inexperience. He fumbled, failing even to raise a spiritual shield, and only thought to dodge—unaware that his clumsy movements played right into Lin Xuan's trap. Quicksand became his death sentence.

As the quicksand trapped his feet, fireballs and ice bullets surged toward him. Yan Ming's face paled. Though he was also at the fourth layer of the Lingdong stage, he had lived a sheltered life, rarely engaging in combat and always under his father's protection. He had never faced such danger before.

"Useless!" Lin Xuan sneered inwardly. 

Having cultivation but fumbling in battle—such a bully, relying on family power, had no future. Just as Yan Ming was about to be struck, a figure darted forward and pulled him aside.

The Yan family head!

Lin Xuan's expression turned grave. This man was the real threat. To avoid being overwhelmed, Lin Xuan had targeted the weaker Yan Ming first, hoping to eliminate one enemy while they were unprepared. Initially, it had gone smoothly—Yan Ming was strong but a useless fop. However, the Yan patriarch reacted swiftly.

Though he saved his son, he couldn't prevent all harm. A single ice bullet struck Yan Ming's chest, drawing blood. Seizing the opening created by the patriarch's rescue, Lin Xuan didn't waste the opportunity.

He reached into his robe and pulled out five talismans. Infusing them with spiritual power, he flung them into the air.

Boom!

A wave of scorching heat erupted as the talismans transformed into dozens of fireballs, roaring toward the Yan father and son.

Yan Tianheng's face darkened. He hadn't expected this young man to act so decisively, striking ruthlessly without a single wasted word.

In comparison, his son was far too lacking. Despite his decent cultivation, he panicked in battle, failing to unleash even a tenth of his strength. Instead of helping, he had become a burden.
