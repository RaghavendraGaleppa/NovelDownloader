# Chapter 291: The Candle Edict, Liu Qing’s Change of Heart, and the Chosen Prodigy

Li Xian and Nan Gong Liuli had studied the "Five Elements Foundation" and "The Theory of Strange Evasion" for several days, feeling they had gained much. Nan Gong Liuli was naturally intelligent and broad-minded; whenever Li Xian encountered something he didn't understand, she could often explain it. However, regarding the principles of evolution and adaptation within the Five Elements, she was far inferior to Li Xian.

"Five Elements Foundation" and "The Theory of Strange Evasion" were foundational texts. But the annotations within the books were the true essence. Yan Hao was proficient in the Five Elements Strange Evasion, yet whenever he had free time, he would still flip through these two books. Whenever he had a new realization or感悟 (insight), he would record it in the margins.

Li Xian followed these annotations, adding his own understanding and research. He recorded his doubts in the book but never went to ask Yan Hao for answers, thinking that although Yan Hao had agreed to teach him the Five Elements Strange Evasion, if he bothered him too frequently and Yan Hao found it annoying, that would be inappropriate.

Li Xian practiced the Five Elements during the day, trained with the Residual Demon Spear at night, and practiced the Five Organs Turbid Cleansing technique. In his spare time, he exchanged moves with Nan Gong Liuli, cooperating sincerely. Time passed quickly, and the appointed day arrived.

Nan Gong Liuli sat under the shade of a tree reading a book, feeling increasingly surprised by Li Xian. She realized that Li Xian’s thinking was agile. They had started studying the Five Elements at the same time, but Li Xian had already surpassed her. She secretly steeled herself, becoming even more diligent, unwilling to fall behind.

Li Xian left through a side door, heading southeast.

"That Senior Liu Qing originally looked down on me, yet she asked me to come to her residence again after three days. Why is that?"

He soon arrived at the Quiet Heart Residence.

The place was serene and quiet, with occasional light cries of birds and beasts. Li Xian gently knocked on the bamboo door. The sound "tap, tap" was light and distant, absolutely not disturbing.

After a moment.

Yan Hao came to open the door, his expression very strange. He hesitated for a moment and said, "You come in."

Passing through the pear garden, they saw the main hall. Several people were already seated inside: Chief Envoy Shi, Chu Liuqing, and Ferry Envoy Jin Shichang.

Chief Envoy Shi said, "Miss Liuqing, are you sure you won't stay a few more days?"

Chu Liuqing shook her head faintly and said, "No need. Suddenly, there is urgent business. I must take my leave today."

"Chief Envoy Shi, thank you for your hospitality these past days. I, Liuqing, express my gratitude. If you encounter any difficulties in the future, please feel free to seek me out."

Chief Envoy Shi now understood the whole story and knew that further persuasion was useless. He sighed helplessly, "Very well... but regarding that matter..." When he said "that matter," Chu Liuqing averted her gaze, so he tactfully said no more.

At this moment, Li Xian and Yan Hao arrived at the hall, and the atmosphere was heavy. Chu Liuqing glanced lightly at Li Xian, then ignored him. She stood up and said, "Let's leave it at that. Chief Envoy Shi, is the boat ready?"

Chief Envoy Shi said, "The boat is ready." Chu Liuqing said, "Then we shall depart early." She walked straight out of the pavilion. To the southeast of the island was a town called "Flower Pomegranate Town," similar in size to Peach Blossom Town. Walking a few miles from the pavilion and bypassing Flower Pomegranate Town, one would reach a harbor.

Chu Liuqing was rushing for time, and Chief Envoy Shi followed to see her off. Chu Liuqing was indifferent and distant. As she passed Li Xian, she didn't look at him an extra time. Her figure flickered, and she was already far away.

Li Xian thought it was strange. Yan Hao sighed softly, "Some things depend heavily on fate. If it is destined to be yours, it is; if not, it isn't. There is no need to think too much about it." Li Xian didn't understand: "What do you mean, Deputy Envoy Yan?"

Yan Hao said, "Even if it doesn't work out, we must still respectfully see her off. Let's hurry and follow." Li Xian and Yan Hao used lightness skill, following behind Chu Liuqing, Chief Envoy Shi, and Jin Shichang.

The blue water flowed gently, waves rippling one after another.

A decorated boat hovered in the middle of the lake.

Beside the decorated boat. Chu Liuqing’s face was veiled in white gauze. She held a long sword in her right hand and cupped her hands toward the crowd: "Let us part here." Chief Envoy Shi cupped his hands and smiled: "I wish Miss Liuqing all the best in your endeavors."

Chu Liuqing nodded faintly. Her beautiful eyes glanced intentionally or unintentionally at Li Xian, but she said nothing. She said to Jin Shichang: "Please trouble the Envoy to see me out of the Water Altar."

A short while later, the decorated boat rode the waves and departed. The mist over the Dongran Lake grew hazy, gradually enveloping the boat. Chu Liuqing, Jin Shichang, and the others had already left the island.

Shi Yufei said, "Ah! What a pity, what a pity!" He patted Li Xian on the shoulder. Li Xian asked confusedly, "Chief Envoy Shi, I am quite confused about this matter. Could you explain it to me?"

Chu Liuqing's attitude was distant and hard to understand.

Shi Yufei originally didn't want to bring it up, but he suddenly thought that this matter was actually a very good test of one's state of mind. He immediately asked: "You really want to know? The matter has already happened and is irreversible. Some things are better off treated as if they never happened. But if you know the reason behind it, regret, jealousy, and unwillingness will accompany you for life. It is very possible that your martial path will stop there because of it."

Li Xian thought to himself: "Chief Envoy Shi's words are very strange. It’s as if I’ve lost a great opportunity. Speaking of which... I have gained a lot recently, why would I regret, envy, or be unwilling?" He asked: "Chief Envoy Shi, please go ahead."

Chief Envoy Shi said: "Very well, let's return to the residence to speak." He grabbed Li Xian's shoulder and leaped up, moving at extreme speed. Li Xian felt as though he were shuttling through a bamboo forest. In just a few breaths, they had returned to the Quiet Heart Residence.

Yan Hao was half a step slower, landing steadily in the courtyard. The three sat in the stone pavilion. Chief Envoy Shi said: "Speaking of this matter, you have unknowingly missed a great opportunity."

Li Xian was very curious and asked further. Chief Envoy Shi said: "You already know about the Candle Cult. The Candle Cult was destroyed, its sparks scattered everywhere. But as a forbidden demonic sect, its foundation is deep and cannot be underestimated. A centipede dies but does not fall over. The Candle Cult still has remnants remaining, secretly gathering strength to revive."

"The previous Chu Liuqing was a Venerable of the Candle Cult. She also possessed the most orthodox lineage of the Candle Cult and held part of its heritage. The remnants of the Candle Cult have turned from bright to dark, and their reputation is no longer apparent. But if they were to reveal their traces again, it would certainly shock the world. The Candle Cult is accumulating strength and secretly plotting. At this time, if one wants to enter the Candle Cult, it is truly extremely difficult. One must obtain a recommendation and get a 'Candle Edict' to do so."

"And three days ago, you displayed your talent in the spear path and were proficient in the Residual Demon Spear technique. You truly have a fated connection with the Candle Cult. Venerable Liu originally intended to pass the Candle Edict to you and draw you into the Candle Cult."

Chief Envoy Shi smiled faintly: "You probably don't know the severity of the situation, nor the opportunity involved."

Li Xian顺势 asked.

Chief Envoy Shi explained: "The Candle Cult was too glorious. No force in the world could compare to the shock the Candle Cult brought!"

"'The Candle Lamp Illuminates the World, I am the Sun and Moon. Great Unity Under Heaven, My Cult Has No Distinctions.' Who would dare make a sound in the presence of such terror?"

"The world says the Candle Cult brought disaster, and indeed, in its later stages, the control over its disciples was loose. But during its glorious period, it was certainly not like that. The Candle Cult indulged in passion and nature, making it difficult to keep its disciples pure. But when the sect rules were strict, it absolutely disdained to do evil or cause trouble."

"The Candle Cult has been destroyed for a long time, and there are no records on paper. But if you ask the子弟 (scions) of the aristocratic families, do they know of the Candle Cult? They surely do! Even after a thousand or ten thousand years, it cannot be completely forgotten."

"They both fear the might of our demonic sect and envy the past glory of our Candle Cult."

"And the 'Candle Edict' of the Candle Cult has a special meaning. It was once a token to show status within the Candle Cult. Even back then, during the glory days of the Candle Cult, those who possessed a 'Candle Edict' were very few."

Li Xian sighed: "I see."

Chief Envoy Shi said: "The Candle Cult has a profound foundation. The Candle Edict represents status. To obtain a Candle Edict is already a great honor!"

"The Candle Cult is vast and precise, with a strict hierarchy. Since the Candle Edict represents status, it naturally has grades."

"Venerable Liu's Candle Edict belongs to the highest grade. To obtain her Candle Edict and join the Candle Cult through her recommendation, one's status in the sect would be several ranks higher than others. The abundant resources of the Candle Cult would naturally be obtainable. [Precious Treasures], [Wealth], [Connections], [Martial Arts]... all are within easy reach."

"Even though the Candle Cult has fallen, its heritage is extraordinary. It must not be underestimated."

"If you had obtained Venerable Liu's Candle Edict, your status would have changed dramatically, even sitting on equal footing with me. You could freely enter and exit the Water Altar, and many favorable matters would come to you one after another. Even if you caused a great disaster outside, hiding in the Water Altar would keep you safe and sound."

"It could truly be said that you would soar to the heavens."

"You would likely be able to follow Venerable Liu to cultivate, touching upon the true martial arts of the Candle Cult. That kind of inheritance... is truly a unique opportunity. You come from a hunter's background and have such cultivation; you are certainly not a foolish person. You should know the path of martial arts. It is said to be difficult, as difficult as climbing to the sky. It is said to be easy... just needing a noble person to gently lift you up, and it becomes much easier."

"You were supposed to have this great fortune. Unfortunately... it is completely different yesterday. But you cannot blame yourself. It is the fate of the heavens."

Yan Hao sighed lightly.

Li Xian said: "So that's how it is. There is such a hidden relationship of interests."

When he heard the slogans "The Candle Lamp Illuminates the World, I am the Sun and Moon. Great Unity Under Heaven, My Cult Has No Distinctions," he was very surprised. He had thought the Candle Cult did evil deeds and went its own way, full of ruthless and fierce people.

But the sect's teachings were quite elegant.

No wonder it was the focus of the world's attention and the enemy of the world! The aristocratic families occupied resources and tightly controlled the essentials of martial arts. The Candle Cult sought "My Cult Has No Distinctions," which would inevitably conflict with the aristocratic families. The Candle Cult's later mixture of good and bad people was also closely related to its teachings.

Shi Yufei continued the topic, clarifying the whole story. "Yesterday evening, Venerable Liu suddenly received a letter. The young prodigy of the Li Shan Sword Sect, who had entered the Huaiyin Prefecture's Earth Ranking, wanted to join the Candle Cult."

"Venerable Liu's Candle Edicts only number three. She had to be extremely cautious. After thinking it over, she decided to give the Candle Edict to that prodigy. And you... had a connection but no destiny."

"Speaking of which... you cannot blame Venerable Liu. She originally came for that young hero. If the Candle Cult wants to revive, it must promote a shocking genius who can bear the sun and moon, subdue the four seas, and command the nine heavens and the netherworld. Therefore, they secretly select and recruit talents."

Shi Yufei observed Li Xian's expression. Seeing him relaxed and indifferent, he couldn't help but be very relieved. He stroked his beard and smiled. Unlike Chu Liuqing, he felt that Li Xian, coming from a lowly background and being so young, had reached this step. His potential was not inferior to a young prodigy. Li Xian thought: "This thing never belonged to me in the first place. Passing me by, what is there to regret? Venerable Liu and I were just strangers meeting by chance. Why should I expect her to treat me well?"

He didn't care at all. Li Xian said: "Chief Envoy Shi, what is that young man's name?"

Shi Yufei said: "His name is 'Shan Guyun'. He is a disciple of the Li Shan Sword Sect."

Li Xian said: "Disciple is just curious, meaning no offense. Since Shan Guyun is already a disciple of the Li Shan Sword Sect, is he really willing to join the Candle Cult? The Li Shan Sword Sect is one of the Five Great Sword Sects, with a very loud reputation. It should be considered an orthodox righteous sect."

Shi Yufei laughed: "Naturally, he is willing. Although the Li Shan Sword Sect has a great reputation, if we talk about martial arts and swordsmanship... compared to our Candle Cult, it falls far short. If one seeks stability, the Li Shan Sword Sect is a good place to be. But if one wants to reach the heights, the Candle Cult is the better choice. This Shan Guyun is indeed a rare prodigy. He has a clear sword heart, a琉璃 (colored glaze) sword bone, and a碧落 (azure sky) talent."

Li Xian asked further: "With such a hero, how is the Li Shan Sword Sect willing to let him go?" Shi Yufei said: "So it requires Venerable Liu to personally take action. Do you think she went to plead with them? As long as Shan Guyun agrees to join the Candle Cult, Venerable Liu will take him away."

"Whoever tries to stop them will be useless."

"Speaking of which... in these few days, there will be a good show to watch. When Venerable Liu takes action again, it will surely be earth-shattering. Shan Guyun, obtaining her Candle Edict, can immediately cultivate the 'Solitary Cloud Nine Swords', which belongs to the high-level martial arts of the Candle Cult! This rich blessing makes people envious."

Li Xian's mind trembled slightly. The "Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword" he practiced was also high-level martial arts. It required dual cultivation of Yin and Yang to fully display its wonderful effects. Practicing it alone was only barely mid-level, with many side effects. But features like "Yang Hua沐Body", "Yang Origin Sword Qi", and "Heart Fire" had already shown their extraordinariness, and Li Xian had benefited from them to this day. Combining Yin and Yang could also preserve health and prolong life, keeping one's appearance young. Li Xian had reached the peak of the first and second layers, but he had never glimpsed the full picture of the "Yin Yang Immortal Couple Sword". Back when he combined swords with Wen Caishang to repel Zhang Hu of the Taixin Sect, Wen Caishang had no internal Qi and couldn't truly reveal the subtleties of the sword technique.

Thinking of this, it was a great regret.

Hearing the name "Solitary Cloud Nine Swords", it seemed sharp and radiating, solitary and proud above the nine heavens. It must be extremely powerful. He felt a hint of envy, but thinking of the Residual Demon Spear, the Five Organs Turbid Cleansing and Yang Meridian meeting, and the Five Elements Strange Evasion, all of which still needed to be slowly cultivated, the envy gradually faded.

"Martial path, martial path, since it is my path, I only need to compete with myself forever. If others look down on me, I don't need to be angry."

Yan Hao sighed: "Venerable Liu is really good to him." He thought back to a few days ago when she saw Li Xian施展 the Residual Demon Spear, she had been moved and hesitant. But in the end, she was stingy with her teaching, yet she was very enthusiastic towards that Shan Guyun.

Shi Yufei said: "Of course, it's because Shan Guyun's talent is exceptional. It is also because our Flower Cage Sect's status in the sect is lowly. Venerable Liu only has three Candle Edicts, so she must be cautious. This is very helpless. Ultimately, there was less affinity."

The moon was bright and the stars were sparse.

Li Xian chewed on a piece of grass and walked slowly around the island. The Dongran Lake was vast and boundless, shrouded in mist, unable to see the shore. The lake grew lotuses, reeds, aquatic trees, and other vegetation. In the depths, venomous snakes nested. With this折腾 (tossing about), a day passed quickly. Li Xian relaxed his muscles and bones, eased his mind, and recalled what he had heard today. He felt both startled and unreal.

It seemed that with a slight deviation, he would have transformed instantly, joining a forbidden demonic sect with a high status. Li Xian saw a green lotus swaying in the wind. He stepped on the Seven Star Step, stepped on the lotus pod, picked the lotus seeds one by one, and jumped back to the shore.

He peeled the lotus shell and put it in his mouth. The taste was slightly astringent and somewhat bitter. But there would be a sweet aftertaste, clearing the liver and brightening the eyes. Li Xian ate leisurely, one by one. He thought: "Since I started practicing martial arts, I have seen many cold and desolate things. Although Chu Liuqing looks down on me, Chief Envoy Shi and Yan Hao are very good to me. They didn't have to honor the bet regarding the Residual Demon Spear, yet they were willing to teach me the Five Elements Strange Evasion. This is a kindness. My fortune is already better than that of many people."

Returning to the Green Ox Residence, he cooked a pot of lotus seed and fish soup today. It tasted delicious.

After a night of rain and wind, Li Xian returned to his room to rest. Sitting cross-legged on the bed, he quietly practiced the Five Organs Turbid Cleansing, advancing the Five Organs Turbid Cleansing and Yang Meridian meeting. Suddenly, he felt a glow bursting from his pores, and his hair floated slightly. He exhaled a clear breath that lingered and didn't dissipate.

**[Five Organs Turbid Cleansing and Yang Meridian Meeting - Five Organs Chapter]**
**[Proficiency: 3986/8000 Minor Achievement]**
**[Proficiency +1]**

Accumulating day by day, proficiency gradually increased, and his martial foundation became richer. Li Xian suddenly felt curious. He had gained much recently: Martial Realm Second Stage, the Phantom God Ghost Garment, the Residual Demon Spear, the Five Organs Turbid Cleansing and Yang Meridian meeting... but they were rarely revealed. He came to his senses. If he went all out with his current strength, it was truly very powerful.

His spine was like a divine mountain, the Perfect Strange Physique, the Pure Gang Qi Robe, the Vomiting Blood Classic, the Flying Snake Hand... the foundation was solid, and progress was stable. He was moving forward steadily.

In the following days.

Li Xian's Five Elements Strange Evasion and Residual Demon Spear progressed steadily. The Vomiting Blood Classic reached its peak, adding several zhang of internal Qi. His Qi Lake was now eighty-two zhang wide. Vomiting blood was like fire, capable of burning several zhang away. Vomiting blood to form a cocoon was very solid and thick.

The Residual Demon Spear reached its goal naturally, stepping into **[Great Completion]**.

**[Residual Demon Spear]**
**[Proficiency: 124/15000 Great Completion]**
**[Description: You observed the Ghost Map, deeply understanding the Ghost's intent. The Residual Demon Spear reached Great Completion, comprehending the 'Ghost Cry' immortal sound, and witnessing the initial scene of the martial path!】**

Through the initial scene, Li Xian faintly saw the full picture of the "Map of Specters, Fiends, Ghosts, and Spirits". It was quite a coincidence. The Residual Demon Map was an imitation of the "Map of Specters, Fiends, Ghosts, and Spirits". It was later burned and torn, hence it was named the Residual Demon Map. In the initial scene of the martial path, it was a painter copying the original painting. Li Xian, by this circumstance, happened to be able to glimpse the true map of the Specters, Fiends, Ghosts, and Spirits.

The spear technique benefited immensely.

If he could glimpse it a few more times, without obtaining the true "Map of Specters, Fiends, Ghosts, and Spirits", Li Xian could also cultivate the "Specters, Fiends, Ghosts, and Spirits Spear"! Li Xian's state of mind was steady. This was a distant fantasy, and thinking about it empty would waste energy. So he temporarily put it aside and studied the "Ghost Cry".

The Ghost Cry belongs to a lingering immortal sound. It uses the collision of the bones throughout the body to produce a special strange sound, thereby bursting with strange effects. This sound starts from the "Jade Pillow Pass", vibrating between the ribs, with a total of seventeen sounds. It sounds like a ghost crying. When used while舞ing the spear, it adds extra quality.

Others hearing it will have their minds gradually affected, bringing fear, panic, gloom, nightmares... various strange conditions. Li Xian's martial foundation has added another weight. He knows that the application of martial arts is crucial in actual combat. Therefore, he attempts to combine the "Ghost Cry" sound with the many martial arts he has already mastered.

Li Xian has mastered four types: "Body Guarding Sound", "Attack Sound", "Yang Playing Sound", and "Ghost Cry Sound". The principles of "Yang Playing Sound" and "Ghost Cry Sound" are contrary. If played together, the Yang Playing Sound will cover the Ghost Cry Sound. But if the Ghost Cry Sound is used together with the "Gang Thunder Finger", the Gang Thunder Finger immediately becomes Yin-cold and ghostly, making it harder to fathom.

Many妙用 (wonderful uses) depend on the situation to be implemented.

Martial arts progress is abundant, and other paths have not been neglected.

**[Small Five Elements Strange Evasion]**
**[Proficiency: 13/100]**

Li Xian and Nan Gong Liuli studied "Five Elements Foundation" and "The Theory of Strange Evasion"... accumulating many doubts, they went to seek Yan Hao for answers.

Yan Hao was a genius in the Five Elements Strange Evasion. What others found difficult, he found easy. Therefore, his words were ambiguous and very vague, making it extremely difficult for others to understand. Fortunately, Li Xian was well-prepared. Before asking for answers, he had accumulated knowledge and pondered repeatedly. Although Yan Hao's words were vague, Li Xian could always understand his meaning.

In this way, back and forth, Yan Hao was very pleased and became more willing to teach the Five Elements Strange Evasion.

As Li Xian's cultivation deepened, his thinking became more divergent, and he gradually was able to converse with Yan Hao about this path. Yan Hao loved the Five Elements Strange Evasion extremely much, thus neglecting his martial arts. For many years, he had been "appreciating his own solitude", inevitably lonely.

With Li Xian, they were gradually becoming teacher and friend.

At the same time studying the Five Elements Strange Evasion was Nan Gong Liuli. At first, she could keep up, barely maintaining a comparable level. Gradually, Li Xian had surpassed her by much.

Whenever she raised a question, Li Xian could answer it. Nan Gong Liuli came from an aristocratic family, with a dignified and wise appearance, but in reality, she was extremely competitive. Seeing this situation, she studied even harder, but felt an invisible pressure. She actually chased further and further away from Li Xian.

Every evening, at the dinner table, their conversation was no longer "conversation", but teaching. Nan Gong Liuli asked for advice, and Li Xian answered.

Nan Gong Liuli sighed softly and had to accept it. Her talent was not bad, and her progress in the Five Elements Strange Evasion was very fast.

In the blink of an eye, a few more days passed.

Li Xian was practicing martial arts in the inner courtyard when he suddenly felt a subtle sensation. He had dropped hair and rooted it in the cracks of the vermilion wall. The hair sensed that someone was visiting. He immediately glanced at Nan Gong Liuli. Nan Gong Liuli had been with Li Xian for a long time and had a vague telepathic connection. She returned to the bedroom to hide.

Li Xian practiced martial arts as usual, waiting for the knock on the door before going to open it.

"Chief Envoy Shi, why have you come?" Li Xian asked.

Shi Yufei smiled kindly: "I came to see you." He walked into the residence, looked around, and saw the scenery was very simple. He said earnestly: "Wu Cuo (Li Xian's alias), this won't do. I heard from Yan Hao that you practice martial arts diligently and are quite attentive to the Five Elements Strange Evasion. However... the courtyard scenery of the residence also needs time to be arranged."

"Your residence is quiet and secluded, but it is too bare. The ground is still yellow mud. Cultivating the martial path is both seeking martial arts and seeking survival."

These words were very sincere. Li Xian smiled: "Chief Envoy Shi's words make sense, but I am short of money and really have no extra funds."

Shi Yufei said: "Forget it, I didn't come to talk to you about this." He came to the stone pavilion and sat down, saying leisurely: "Have you heard the recent news?"

Li Xian was puzzled: "What news?"

Shi Yufei said: "You can't go out, so it's normal you don't know. That matter is related to you, yet unrelated to you. It's about Venerable Liu and Shan Guyun."

Li Xian was immediately curious. Shi Yufei continued: "Some time ago, Venerable Liu recruited Shan Guyun. I figured this matter wouldn't be peaceful. As expected, just as I predicted, it caused a huge stir!"

"That day, Shan Guyun betrayed the Li Shan Sword Sect, causing the sect to be furious. They wanted to forcibly keep Shan Guyun. Venerable Liu appeared quietly, raised her sword and chopped a building, shaking the four sides. She took Shan Guyun and left on a light boat."

"The Li Shan Sword Sect still wouldn't let go. Venerable Liu said: 'Is the Li Shan Sword Sect so petty? Only taking in, never letting out. Even if a disciple wants to join another sect, you want to stop them?' The people of the Li Shan Sword Sect said: 'It's a small matter for him to leave the sect, but it involves our sect's martial arts. This matter must be settled clearly. You cannot leave until it is.'"

"The atmosphere was extremely heavy at the time, even the river waves stopped. Venerable Liu said: 'Mediocre sects, inferior martial arts, yet you treat them as treasures.' The Li Shan Sword Sect was furious. Several elders entered the river to intercept. That scene was truly rare to see. Wind howled, river waves roared, sword light chilled the nine provinces. Venerable Liu lifted the river and stepped on the waves, sword Qi rising to the sky, rolling the wild waves up to the ninth heaven. The Li Shan Sword Sect was defeated one by one, powerless to stop her. They watched as Chu Liuqing stepped on the boat and departed."

Shi Yufei spoke in great detail, observing Li Xian's reaction. Chu Liuqing had abandoned him to choose the more troublesome Shan Guyun. Such a feeling would be hard for anyone to balance. And it involved wealth and honor, soaring to the heavens, a carp turning over, which made people's thoughts even more chaotic.

But seeing that Li Xian remained calm throughout, Shi Yufei appreciated him even more. Recalling his younger days, he didn't have such composure. He suddenly thought:

"Venerable Liu's decision may not be correct. Although Shan Guyun's talent is powerful, he is certainly not unique. Wu Cuo's open-minded nature, on the contrary, is more suitable for the style of our Candle Cult."

"Can the Candle Cult be reignited just by relying on a prodigy like Shan Guyun? I think it's far from enough."

"On the other hand, this Wu Cuo. If cultivated, there might be even more surprises."

His gaze was sharp, his fingers tapping thoughtfully. He had prepared a great gift before coming.
