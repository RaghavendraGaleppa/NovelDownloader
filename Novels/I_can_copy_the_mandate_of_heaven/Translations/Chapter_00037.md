# 37，悬壶济世李童子

Li Zhiming took out medicinal stones and other items, first finding the most urgent case and began treatment.

The man had been stabbed in the chest, the blade nearly reaching his heart. The wound was festering, and he was bleeding profusely. At this rate, he would have died from blood loss soon. This 'Wind' character disciple, standing at nearly six foot three, was brimming with robust blood and qi. An ordinary person wouldn't have lasted this long.

Li Zhiming didn't waste any words. He applied several needles to stop the bleeding, then immediately disinfected and sutured the wound.

He then placed a slice of ginseng under the injured man's tongue to sustain his life force, before pouring a scarlet pill from a red bottle and feeding it to him.

After calmly completing these steps, the heavy bleeding had stopped. Next, he needed to carefully sew the blood vessels and flesh together, a step that would secure the man's life.

To anyone watching, the sight was a bloody mess. His hands moved through the gore as he stitched, the raw flesh revealing layers of fat and cut muscle, with glimpses of internal organs.

An adult would likely find it difficult to watch, but the young boy acted as if he saw nothing amiss, calmly continuing to stitch.

Han Li stood behind Li Zhiming, watching his companion's rescue efforts. At first, he thought he was showing off, but as he watched him calmly sew through the bloody flesh, the needle moving as smoothly as a flower threading through leaves, no one would believe it was his first time. His skill was beyond simply "knowing how" - it was as if he had practiced hundreds, even thousands, of times.

But, where would he have learned this?

Watching his companion confidently and skillfully suture wounds and save the injured, Han Li felt insecure. They were both studying under Doctor Mo, had his master been secretly tutoring him? Why didn’t he know this?

Han Li felt a sense of… *wait, weren’t we in the same class?* A feeling of shock.

Indeed, Li Zhiming wasn't just competent; he was skilled, as skilled as Doctor Mo.

His white destiny card read: [Roaming the World with a Sword].

Skills: Farming Expert (Level 4)
Hunter (Level 1)
Tailoring and Sewing (Level 4)
Blacksmith (Level 5)
Scholar
Saving the World (MAX): You are the best doctor in the world.
Demon Silver Hand (MAX)
Dragon Binding Skill (MAX)

Having inherited all of Doctor Mo's expertise, Li Zhiming at that moment was a perfect copy of him, without the slightest difference. In the art of healing and saving lives, not to mention being a mere apprentice, when Doctor Mo was still alive, Li Zhiming could already be considered a master physician on par with him.

Doctor Mo had died, making Li Zhiming the best in the world!

Whatever level Doctor Mo was at, Li Zhiming was at that same level!

Not to mention, Doctor Mo had diligently practiced the Demon Silver Hand and the Dragon Binding Skill for forty years, which Li Zhiming had now mastered. At the young age of twelve, he possessed the same level of skill that Doctor Mo had only achieved after forty years of training!

In terms of pure martial strength, if Li Zhiming wasn't so young, he would definitely be considered a top-tier martial artist within the entire Seven Mysteries Sect!

This destiny copying ability was truly heaven-defying!

Remaining inconspicuous on ordinary days, one could soar to the heavens overnight!

In the blink of an eye, everything could be completely different!

Li Zhiming was only twelve years old, but he was a young replica of Doctor Mo with 40 years of martial arts experience + 40 years of medical skill!

More and more people gathered around to watch, from the beginning with Gao Changdong, to the heads of various peaks, their expressions grew increasingly serious. They watched Li Zhiming skillfully apply medicine, stitch, insert needles, treat knife wounds, and even detoxify poison.

He was too skilled to be an apprentice.

How could they not be concerned?

With Doctor Mo's death, where could they find another such excellent physician? Now, one of his disciples had stepped forward. Regardless of his age, what if, just what if, he could fill the void left by Doctor Mo? From now on, how many fewer people would die within the Seven Mysteries Sect?

Soon, Li Zhiming had successively treated seven or eight people, without looking up, without pausing, with zero mistakes. Aside from a slight clumsiness at the beginning, he became increasingly skilled. His skill reached a confident, effortless level.

If you didn't say he was a child, but said he was Doctor Mo reincarnated, Gao Changdong would believe it!

Standing behind Li Zhiming, watching him skillfully, confidently, and calmly treat seven or eight injured people, Gao Changdong couldn't help but believe it, no matter how skeptical he was. He gaped, his face filled with shock and disbelief. His previous disdain had completely vanished.

Though, it was still hard to believe.

It was like seeing someone who looked like an elementary school student in a specialist clinic, a face even more innocent than your sixth-grade son, wearing a white coat, taking pulses, listening to hearts, asking questions, and writing prescriptions, just like an eighty-year-old senior consultant.

Yet, watching from the side, you couldn't find any mistakes in the process or the results.

He had treated seven or eight people in a row, and he was correct every time.

In this situation, regardless of whether "a beardless mouth can't be trusted."

The fact of the matter was, his master was dead, and throughout the entire Seven Mysteries Sect, he seemed to be the only doctor who could even be considered competent. Would you let him treat people or not?

This era had one good thing: they believed in the strong. They only looked at the results and not the process. They ignorantly didn't understand how many years of hard work and how many cases it took to develop such medical skills.

As long as you could heal people, no matter how young you were, calling you a "little miracle doctor" was all it took, and everything was reasonable.

As long as you could get the job done, what was wrong with making a twelve-year-old a prime minister?

Night had fallen, and Li Zhiming was so tired he couldn't stand up straight.

Li Zhiming finished stitching up the last injured person. Although his medical skills were on point, Li Zhiming's age meant that his energy and stamina were too weak. Seeing Li Zhiming's condition, Han Li quickly stepped forward and supported him.

"I haven't failed your expectations," Li Zhiming said respectfully to Gao Changdong.

Having witnessed Li Zhiming's "miracle" from beginning to end, Gao Changdong was startled when this unremarkable boy bowed to him. How could he dare to act presumptuously in front of Li Zhiming now?

In the future, if he got injured or had a headache, and needed someone to stitch him up or prescribe some medicine, did he want to die?

Furthermore, martial artists respected doctors the most. With Doctor Mo's death, who would have thought that this twelve-year-old could step up to the plate? For the Seven Mysteries Sect, it was like a windfall!

"Little Miracle Doctor!" Gao Changdong said with a face full of respect, jumping to the side and bowing politely to Li Zhiming, "Please, accept my bow!"

Saying that, this peak head, who held a high position within the Seven Mysteries Sect, bowed deeply to Li Zhiming!
