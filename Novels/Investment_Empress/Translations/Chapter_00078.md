# Chapter 78: The Deciding Match, Silencing Everyone

As the elders fell silent, they all saw the horror in each other's eyes. It was already headache-inducing enough for Qingyuan Sect to have Shang Wu, a naturally gifted fighting physique. If a second one were to appear... *hiss*... The elders leaned back strategically.

The only comforting thought was that while Li Mo was formidable in a fight, he usually had an excellent temper and was kind to others. His heavy-handedness this time was also due to the opponent's initial provocation.

"Old Xue, this child is your grand-disciple, correct?" Qian Bufan said in a deep voice.

"Hmm... Li Dalong was once my personal disciple." Xue Jing's gaze was complex. "It was just that he was injured later and applied to return home."

"Then you should visit Autumn Water Pavilion more often in the future."

"Indeed, the ideological education of disciples is also extremely important." The elders had already begun to formulate ideological and political education classes for Li Mo.

"That's my disciple!" Shang Wu twitched her delicate nose and snorted, "A bunch of old fogies, just now you were questioning my teaching abilities."

The elders: "..." What did his body-refining techniques and swordsmanship have to do with her? Wasn't this purely due to his own innate talent? Hmm. To achieve such a level under Shang Wu's guidance only made Li Mo seem more like unpolished jade. It was a pity that Li Mo's talent had troubled all of them back then. They also wondered if taking Shang Wu as his master was a stroke of unexpected luck...

"He obtained Chixiao, so his swordsmanship must also be strong."

"If he has body-refining skills... then he and little Bing'er might really be able to give us a dragon-tiger struggle."

"Hahaha, my Qingyuan Sect has produced a true Phoenix, and now a latent Dragon is about to emerge." Just based on the level Li Mo displayed in the arena, at the age of sixteen, if you add his considerable swordsmanship attainment, he definitely belonged to the ranks of heavenly talents!

The elders looked at the people from the various sects, large and small, with eyes that seemed to smile but not quite. Thought Qingyuan Sect was in decline? Wanted to test the foundation of their sect? You must be sweating now, aren't you?

"Oh, right, Old Qian, why don't you go up and stop it?"

"Oh, I've been thinking that too, I'm getting old and always forgetting things."

This match was over. The result was naturally self-evident and extremely memorable; after all, this was the first time in this Nine Peaks Grand Martial Meet that someone was carried off on a stretcher. If Wang Hao hadn't still been twitching when he was carried down, everyone would have thought he was dead.

Many people looked at Ying Bing. But the girl was still drinking tea, showing no surprise. She had personally taught Li Mo swordsmanship, so she naturally knew. For Li Mo's swordsmanship attainment, body-refining was merely icing on the cake. Everyone thought about it and felt relieved. Since the two lived together, they must have some understanding of each other's strength, so not being surprised was normal.

It's just that they didn't know... Between the two, who was stronger now?

***

The Nine Vein Martial Meet continued. But the subsequent matches were rather unremarkable. Ying Bing's combat process could basically be summarized as: "I rose, and instantly killed them." However... someone didn't even make a move.

In the semi-finals, Li Mo's opponent was actually an acquaintance. It was the boy, a disciple of Elder Xue of Dan Ding Peak, who had received Li Mo and Ying Bing at the medical hall that day.

"Hehe, Junior Brother Li, we meet again." The boy's smiling eyes were filled with emotion: "When I saw you that day, you hadn't even opened your meridians, and I was already in the Jade Liquid Realm. Who would have thought that now you would be standing opposite me." His true age was actually much older than his appearance; he only looked this way because he was ill.

"Senior Brother." Li Mo nodded slightly.

"Hmm?"

"If you want to talk about standing opposite me, you have to get onto the arena first, don't you?" Looking at the boy still standing below the arena, Li Mo showed a helpless expression.

"Uh, I just remembered that Dan Ding Peak still has medicine brewing," the boy stammered. "I'll be going now, I won't disturb you." The boy left in a hurry. As he left, his gaze still lingered between Ying Bing and Li Mo, then he gave Li Mo a thumbs-up: "Go for it, Junior Brother Li. I'm rooting for you."

Li Mo: "?" Well, he didn't even need to move.

***

It was the final match.

Looking up, at the steps, Ying Bing's light blue plain robe fluttered against her slender figure, and in her dark spring-like eyes, emotions finally surged. She had never thought before that in the Nine Peaks Grand Martial Meet, the person standing opposite her would be Li Mo. This young man who, in her previous life, had quickly disappeared into the crowd, becoming unremarkable. In this life, he had unhesitatingly jumped into Qingyuan with her, unhesitatingly given her the Yuanhuang Xiapo, and then displayed astonishing swordsmanship talent, almost comparable to Jiang Chulong.

Because of him, her life in this world had also undergone many changes. Every day there were delicious meals, someone to discuss swordsmanship with, play chess, and occasionally hear new and interesting words pop out of the young man's mouth. This feeling... not bad?

"Thanks to you, I've become much stronger," Li Mo smiled slightly. "I won't hold back." The rewards "brushed out" from the "ice block" (Ying Bing) naturally went without saying. The daily immersion and influence gave him the opportunity to realize his dream – to be a dashing swordsman.

"No need to thank me, just thank your hardworking self." Ying Bing's delicate lips curved into an arc that even she herself hadn't noticed: "Let me see what fruits your recent efforts have borne."

"I'm sure I'll give you a surprise." Li Mo's smile was bright. As a swordsman, to duel with a master, this feeling was truly wonderful.

"If you've made great progress, I'll also be happy for you," Ying Bing said softly. His sword, she had taught him. If there were results, she would naturally be happy. Victory or defeat, on the other hand, was completely unimportant.

Audience: "?"
The elders: "?"

Wait, why don't you fight? Others enter the arena, not even trash-talking or provoking each other, which already shows high caliber. But you two are here, celebrating each other's success? Should we leave then?

Fortunately, neither of them said anything more. Li Mo gripped Chixiao tightly in his palm, his breathing becoming lighter. Ying Bing tied her dark hair into a high ponytail with one hand, then nodded slightly.

The battle began.

Student Xiao Li made the first move. With a flick of Chixiao's sword tip, the sharp killing intent almost solidified. Like a volley of crane feathers, each imbued with the sharpness to pierce metal and cleave stone. He hadn't wasted his time during this period. In order to smoothly interact between the two fated heroines, he had gone to the scripture pavilion and frantically studied many books on swordsmanship theory, spending nearly half of his surplus martial arts insights on them. He had taken a big step on the path of skill nearing the Dao.

"Using killing intent to replace inner energy."

"Not bad," Ying Bing praised softly. The brilliant sword light of frost and snow flashed; she did not use inner energy. However, her nimble sword flowers precisely dissolved the sharp killing intent one by one into nothingness, and she still had strength to spare. The sword flowers extinguished the crane feathers, then coiled back towards Li Mo.

The next second, Li Mo's figure disappeared from his spot. Wind Shadow Step.

"The Flower Seeking Sword Art can be wielded with the momentum of a dark storm," Ying Bing's clear voice came. "Simply evading will only make my sword momentum grow stronger."

Li Mo was thoughtful. Both are Transformation Realm sword arts, why? Suddenly, he stopped thinking about the Fire Crane Thousand Feathers, and instead traced back to the origin, recalling the original "Prairie Fire Sword Art." Prairie Fire?

The audience below fell silent. Are these two strong? Very strong. Whether Li Mo or Ying Bing, their swordsmanship was beyond their imagination. But... what the heck. Where was the gunpowder smell of competing for first place in the martial meet? Is this a fight? It's clearly them feeding moves to each other! True Heir Li, where's the energy you used to pummel Wang Hao into the ground? True Heir Ying, where's your invincible posture of instantly killing opponents? You weren't like this before! Are you playing around?!
