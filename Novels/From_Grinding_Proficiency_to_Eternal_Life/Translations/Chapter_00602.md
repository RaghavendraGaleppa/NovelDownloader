# Chapter 602: False Seizing of the Golden Position

The Yin and Yang Dao Fruits naturally work best when together, nestled in mutual dependence.

A True Lord's Cave Heaven also requires Dao Fruits to elevate their own cultivation. The interdependence of Yin and Yang is of paramount importance for a Golden Core True Lord. Naturally, Yin and Yang attributed Dao Fruits are supreme treasures.

Xu Yunfan's true objective now was to leverage the imminent perfection of the *Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Sutra* and combine it with the mana characteristics of his *Divine霄 Nine Firmaments Profound Vault Indestructible True Scripture*. He aimed to refine a magical treasure capable of containing the essence of the *Taiyin Xuanjian* Dao Fruit, specifically to forge a vessel for temporarily holding this Dao Fruit core.

A disposable magical treasure that would allow him to falsely seize the Golden Position and briefly unleash the power of a True Lord.

Fortunately, the *Creation Cloud Sutra* contained relevant refining methods, though they required modification.

If any other refiner were to undertake this task, it would be impossible to complete in less than a few hundred years. But Xu Yunfan possessed the Attribute Panel; the intricacies of artifact refining and its underlying principles had been thoroughly comprehended by him. He knew not only what to do but also why it worked.

Xu Yunfan's mind became serene and focused, his entire consciousness pouring into the refinement process.

As he formed the hand seals, Eight Scenery Cloud Qi gushed forth from his Dantian, its color shifting to simulate the profound principles of heaven and earth. The *Divine霄 Nine Firmaments True Scripture* operated, injecting the origin power of thunder to add a trace of indestructible and sovereign characteristics to the vessel. Since Divine霄 Thunder governs life and destruction, it naturally endows the object with unyielding properties.

After completing all this, Xu Yunfan exhaled lightly. He then activated the meticulously arranged formation array, shrouding himself completely. Otherwise, once he took out the *Taiyin Xuanjian* Dao Fruit, its aura would disperse. The very next second, a True Lord would likely appear before him, shouting, "Ant, hand over the Dao Fruit..."

After finishing these preparations, Xu Yunfan carefully took out the Taiyin Treasure Mirror, suspending it before him. He then retrieved the wisp of Taiyin Immortal Gold Nature, stripped from the soul of the Heavenly Empress Star, and carefully guided it to serve as the core bridge connecting the vessel and the Dao Fruit.

Countless rare spiritual materials were melted and purified within the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi. Under the micro-carving of his spiritual sense and the Attribute Panel, an extremely complex and precise internal structure was constructed, resembling a miniature prototype of a Golden Core Cave Heaven. It was ready to be instantly activated once the Dao Fruit was placed within.

This refining technique was incredibly exquisite. Xu Yunfan could be certain that the artifact refining true method within the *Creation Cloud Sutra* was at least created by a Golden Core mid-stage True Lord. Otherwise, it wouldn't include the method for creating an auxiliary treasure modeled after a Cave Heaven.

This process was immensely costly, pushing the depletion of his spiritual sense, mana, and resources to the limit.

Within the Divine霄 Peak's cave dwelling, terrifying aura fluctuations flowed day and night. Eight-colored mystic light, dark starlight, and sharp lightning flashed in alternation. If not for the great array's protection and Xu Yunfan's careful concealment, such phenomena would have long since alerted the sect.

Winter passed, and spring arrived; the cold and heat changed with the seasons.

In the blink of an eye, three years passed.

On this day, deep within the Divine霄 Peak's cave dwelling, the surging spiritual power fluctuations that had lasted for three whole years suddenly ceased. The dense Eight Scenery Cloud Qi slowly retracted, like a tide flowing back into the seated figure's body.

Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes. Within them, purple lightning and dark light interwove before finally returning to a deep, calm state.

He opened his palm, and a crystal bead the size of a pigeon's egg, perfectly round, lay quietly in his hand.

"It's done!"

Xu Yunfan was filled with emotion.

Three years! Three years!

Do you know how I spent these three years?

Without blinking an eye, constantly adjusting the fire control, I finally forged this treasure. Even if another refiner were to attempt it, they could not reach Xu Yunfan's current level.

This bead appeared crystal clear on the outside, but inside, it seemed like a deep, cold galactic river. Countless tiny specks of light flowed ceaselessly along profound trajectories. A heart-palpitating Dao charm and pressure, far surpassing the Foundation Establishment level, was perfectly locked within this small bead.

This was the treasure he had spent three years, pouring vast resources and effort into forging. A special vessel capable of temporarily containing the core of the *Taiyin Xuanjian* Dao Fruit and utilizing its power.

Holding this bead, Xu Yunfan clearly sensed that once activated, he could temporarily seize the position of the Dao Fruit and borrow a sliver of a true Golden Core True Lord's power.

Although this false seizing of the Golden Position might only last for a moment, and the materials consumed were nearly impossible to replicate, it was already his strongest trump card and killer move available at the Foundation Establishment realm.

In the Taihua Spirit Void Realm, which Foundation Establishment Master possesses such extravagance, using a Dao Fruit as a vessel for their false seizing of the Golden Position as a killer move?

Just as Xu Yunfan was carefully experiencing the results of his costly and time-consuming refinement, a slight fluctuation came from the restrictions outside the cave dwelling.

The voice of the attendant Taoist boy, filled with respect and a hint of nervousness, transmitted in.

"Reporting to the Peak Master, True Lord Qingyuan's disciple, Master Lu Chuan, has come to pay a visit."

Xu Yunfan was slightly stunned. He didn't expect Lu Chuan to find him first.

He carefully put away the perfectly round crystal bead, remained silent in meditation, and did not respond. If Lu Chuan intended to force his way in, Xu Yunfan naturally needed to be fully prepared. Although the probability of this happening was very small. Who knows if the thought process of a Foundation Establishment Master from the Primordial Origin Sect is even more erratic than those fanatics from the Wansheng Sword Sect.

When he went into seclusion previously, he had instructed that he was refining artifacts and not to be disturbed by anyone.

Seeing that the Peak Master seemed to be at a critical juncture of his seclusion and didn't respond immediately, the attendant Taoist boy didn't dare to keep Lu Chuan waiting for long. He had to brace himself and report on his behalf.

"Please forgive me, Master Lu. The Peak Master previously instructed that he is not to be disturbed unless there is a major matter... Judging from the aura within his cave dwelling, it seems... seems he is still at a crucial point in stabilizing his cultivation. The Peak Master left a message before his seclusion: if Master Lu graces him with a visit and he is unable to greet you in time, he sincerely hopes for your understanding, as he needs to stabilize the opportunity from the Heavenly Realm. Once the Peak Master emerges from seclusion, he will immediately pay his respects to you at the Purple Chen Peak upon the first opportunity."

Upon hearing the Taoist boy's words, Lu Chuan showed no anger. Instead, a look of understanding flashed in his eyes. He had naturally also sensed the lingering powerful aura deep within the cave dwelling.

"It is of no matter."

Lu Chuan nodded slightly, his voice calm and clear, looking like a true cultivator of the righteous path.

"Since Junior Brother Xu has obtained an opportunity from the Heavenly Realm, he naturally needs time to stabilize and digest it. Consolidating one's foundation is the righteous path. Guard the Peak Master's cave dwelling well. Once Junior Brother Xu successfully completes his cultivation and emerges from seclusion, please convey to him that I will be waiting at the Purple Chen Peak."

After leaving these words, his figure drifted away without lingering any further.

Now that Xu Yunfan had the merit of being the first to ascend, possessed exceptional aptitude, and was highly regarded by True Lord Qingyuan, Lu Chuan naturally wouldn't recklessly disturb him. Furthermore, for a Foundation Establishment realm cultivator to go into seclusion, the short duration could be two to three months, while the long could be seven to eight years. Three years was neither too long nor too short; it was quite normal. After obtaining an opportunity from a realm, one naturally needs time to digest it.

Lu Chuan estimated in his heart that with this opportunity, Xu Yunfan would likely be able to strive for the late Foundation Establishment stage. He naturally didn't know that Xu Yunfan had already stepped into late Foundation Establishment within the Heavenly Realm; otherwise, he would have been even more shocked.

Inside the cave dwelling, sensing Lu Chuan's aura moving further away, Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed slightly.
