Chapter 87: Mysterious Little Beast

Accumulating so many spirit stones was, of course, thanks to the continuous sale of low-grade mid-tier talismans over the past few days. One must know that the sect had previously set a monthly submission quota of 500 spirit stones for the talisman workshops here in Yanji Market, primarily considering the sale of low-grade low-tier talismans. Yet, Chu Ning had sold numerous low-grade mid-tier talismans these past few days.

However, Chu Ning also knew that this was likely the only wave of truly significant spirit stone earnings. In the future, the number of talismans he could sell daily would naturally not be as high as it had been these days. Still, even so, it was enough to make Chu Ning delighted; at least these spirit stones were now in his hands.

Having earned so many spirit stones, Chu Ning didn't hesitate and immediately began cultivating with them. Truth be told, his cultivation speed for both the Azurewood Evergreen Art and the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art had been somewhat delayed these past few days due to constantly drawing talismans. The good news was that his spiritual sense was continuously strengthening through constant use, depletion, and recovery. The proficiency of his Spirit Refinement Art was also steadily increasing.

He had been in this market for eleven days. The proficiency of his Azurewood Evergreen Art had only increased by 11 points, and the progress for Non-Decaying Bones had only increased by 9 points. However, for the Spirit Refinement Art, his proficiency had surprisingly increased by nearly 30 points. Chu Ning's priority now was to catch up on his Qi Condensation progress.

Holding the spirit stones, Chu Ning cultivated one after another. This cultivation session lasted for most of the day.

[Azurewood Evergreen Art (Yellow-grade low-tier), Second Layer (521/900)]
[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art, First Volume, Non-Decaying Bones 179/600]
[Spirit Refinement Art, First Layer 149/1000]

Chu Ning spent a total of 30 spirit stones, increasing his Azurewood Evergreen Art proficiency by 10 points. After reaching Qi Condensation Layer Six, Chu Ning now needed 3 low-grade spirit stones to increase his proficiency by 1 point. Calculating this, Chu Ning couldn't help but secretly shake his head. 4200 spirit stones seemed like a lot, but they were consumed rapidly when used for cultivation. Just cultivating from the sixth layer to the seventh layer, if relying purely on spirit stones, would consume over a thousand spirit stones.

Next, Chu Ning continued to cultivate the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art. Previously, his Indestructible Skin proficiency had reached a bottleneck at 150 points after starting at 300. He had eventually relied on the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit to break through the bottleneck. Chu Ning wanted to see if Non-Decaying Bones followed the same pattern; if he cultivated it to 300 proficiency, would he encounter a bottleneck? However, at the current cultivation speed, it would still take several months.

Over the next two days, various deacons from the Azure Stream Sect arrived one after another to inspect the area around the market for any remaining disciples of the Yin Demon Sect.

Chu Ning, meanwhile, kept Lin Changqing's previous instructions in mind and did not go out. He spent every day cultivating and making talismans within the market. One day was the market's trading day, and Chu Ning, as usual, brought out his talismans for sale. However, because the beast tide had been blocked and the number of nearby demonic beasts had decreased, there were indeed far fewer people buying talismans. Chu Ning only managed to sell less than one hundred low-grade spirit stones' worth of talismans the entire day.

That afternoon, Lin Changqing arrived at the market to inform everyone that no other Yin Demon Sect personnel had been found nearby; it was likely just an impulsive act by low-level disciples. As for high-level demonic beasts, there were none. Occasionally, there were some low-level demonic beasts, which these Foundation Establishment stage deacons did not bother to eliminate, instead leaving them for various families and rogue cultivators to hunt.

Even so, Chu Ning was not in a hurry to go out and waited for another day and a half. It wasn't until the morning of the third day, when Chu Ning saw everyone in the market acting as usual and many family disciples and rogue cultivators had already arrived, that he finally left the market, preparing to check on his twenty mu of spirit fields.

Chu Ning cautiously exited the market and cast the Wind Control Art, heading towards the spirit fields. His left hand held a Vajra Talisman, and his right hand gripped a Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield. Even though both Lin Changqing and Du Han had said that the area around Yanji Market was incredibly safe, Chu Ning dared not be careless in the slightest. After all, the sect had also said that the Yin Demon Sect disciples appeared by chance, but Chu Ning clearly knew they had an ulterior motive. He just hadn't figured out why low-level disciples would appear here. Moreover, even without Yin Demon Sect disciples or demonic beasts, there were still rogue cultivators in the vicinity. Chu Ning wasn't sure if some ill-intentioned individual might suddenly attack him.

The journey was peaceful, and Chu Ning only took a little time to enter his spirit fields. He glanced around and saw that the protective formation on the outer perimeter of the spirit fields was still intact, which made Chu Ning slightly relieved. It seemed that the demonic beasts had not yet reached such a close distance to the market. Of course, it was also possible that demonic beasts had appeared but were killed by others. Chu Ning took out his formation token, opened the formation, and walked into the spirit fields.

The next moment, his expression turned incredibly ugly. He saw that within the spirit fields, whether it was Purple Crystal Bamboo shoots or Gold Yuan Fruit saplings, they were all missing in patches. At a glance, a good portion of the spirit plants had disappeared. What made Chu Ning feel extremely strange was that the missing spirit plants were completely random, one here, one there. Even those that weren't missing showed signs of being gnawed on.

"Demonic beast?" Chu Ning reacted almost instantly, feeling alert and incredibly surprised at the same time. He had clearly seen that the protective formation of the spirit fields had not been damaged in the slightest when he was outside. How could a demonic beast appear inside this formation?

Without hesitation, he activated a Vajra Talisman to protect himself, while slowly channeling spiritual power into the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield he held in his other hand. This way, he could activate the protective magic tool at any time if he encountered danger. Simultaneously, Chu Ning's left hand held three Beast-Trapping Talismans.

Having done all this, Chu Ning began to look around. But what met his eyes was nothing. "Did some demonic beast accidentally wander in and then leave?" Chu Ning mumbled to himself, but he found it truly bizarre. If a demonic beast had indeed entered and exited, the protective formation should have been damaged.

Thinking this, Chu Ning cautiously walked towards the center of the spirit fields, simultaneously extending his spiritual sense to scout. He walked for a long time, almost covering the entire spirit field, but Chu Ning still found nothing.

Just as he was about to reach the far end of the spirit fields, Chu Ning suddenly paused. Within the range of his spiritual sense, about a zhang (about 3 meters) away from him, beneath the spiritual soil, a tiny white demonic beast was curled up. The beast's body gently rose and fell, apparently sound asleep. Because its body was completely covered by the spiritual soil, Chu Ning couldn't see it with his naked eyes. If he hadn't happened to sweep it with his spiritual sense at this moment, he wouldn't have discovered it at all.

There really was a demonic beast! With almost no hesitation, Chu Ning quickly activated a Beast-Trapping Talisman and threw it towards the white demonic beast. As the Beast-Trapping Talisman was about to fully envelop it, the sleeping white demonic beast suddenly became alert. The next moment, it leaped up and darted outwards at incredible speed, actually managing to dodge the spiritual power restraint formed by the Beast-Trapping Talisman.

However, just as the white demonic beast darted out, another Beast-Trapping Talisman descended. Chu Ning had been prepared; the instant the first Beast-Trapping Talisman was activated, he had already activated several more talismans in quick succession, completely surrounding all possible escape routes for the white demonic beast. So, no matter which direction the white demonic beast darted, it would meet the same result. Chu Ning had many things, but talismans were especially abundant.

However, what surprised Chu Ning slightly was that the spiritual power restraint formed by the Beast-Trapping Talisman, after landing on the demonic beast, only restrained it for a moment. In the blink of an eye, the white demonic beast completely broke free.

Immediately after, the demonic beast faced Chu Ning, opened its mouth, and spat out a beam of white light that shot towards him. Even though Chu Ning already had a Vajra Talisman shield around him, he didn't dare to be careless in the slightest at this moment. He decisively channeled spiritual power into the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield that he had been holding. The next moment, the palm-sized magic tool suddenly enlarged, blocking in front of him.

"Chish!"

The white light struck the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield and instantly disappeared. This mid-grade defensive magic tool had directly blocked the little demonic beast's attack. Taking this opportunity, Chu Ning finally got a clear look at the white demonic beast.

The white demonic beast was about the size of a rabbit, dragging a long tail. However, it had four ears on its head and a pair of curved horns similar to a goat's. Its entire body was snow-white, with only its eyes being black and as crystal clear as gems.

After its sprayed white light was blocked, a hint of fear appeared in the little demonic beast's eyes. It turned to flee. But just as it turned, several more Beast-Trapping Talismans descended consecutively, binding it tightly. Chu Ning had taken the opportunity to activate several more Beast-Trapping Talismans. The little demonic beast tried to struggle but could no longer break free.

Seeing this, Chu Ning casually activated a Geng Metal Sword Talisman. A golden light flashed, unhesitatingly striking towards the little demonic beast. At the same time, his hands continuously formed incantations, condensing a green sword art in his hand.

At this moment, the spell released by the Geng Metal Sword Talisman had hit the little demonic beast. A white light flashed on the little demonic beast's body, surprisingly blocking most of the power from the Geng Metal Sword Talisman. However, a small portion of the weakened sword qi still struck the little demonic beast's back, causing it to bleed.

"Ying!" The little demonic beast let out a whimper.

The next moment, the white little demonic beast lifted its head. Its eyes looked at Chu Ning, filled with a plea. Chu Ning was slightly stunned to see such intelligent eyes on this little demonic beast. The Verdant Wood Sword Art he was about to unleash paused for a moment, and he didn't send it out immediately.

Seeing this, the white little demonic beast continuously nodded towards Chu Ning, begging for mercy. This greatly astonished Chu Ning, and he couldn't help but murmur to himself, "What kind of demonic beast is this, to be so intelligent?" Observing the power of its attacking spell, it should at most be a low-grade mid-tier demonic beast. However, by rights, such a demonic beast shouldn't possess such intelligence.

"Let me go!" At this moment, a voice suddenly echoed in Chu Ning's mind. This startled Chu Ning immensely. He stared at the white little beast with wide eyes and blurted out, "You can talk?"
