**Chapter 73: No Door to Enter**

Lian Baoshan, the Way of Melting Steel.

“Your bones have eighty-one apertures, originally a top-grade foundation. However, the three fatal Jade Pillow bones have been tempered into a dark gold color by the residual force of the heavy hammer. It is a pity. This diverges from our school’s Way of Melting Steel, and there is no turning back. You may leave.”

“……”

Inside the White Ape Gate on Long Brow Mountain, a bearded giant with extremely long limbs—his arms almost touching the ground—stood barefoot, his feet indistinguishable from his hands. He looked Xu Yunfan up and down.

“To be honest, with your realm of Muscles and Skin Great Completion and the strength of a Second-Rank Martial Master, you could at least serve as a steward within our sect.”

Xu Yunfan asked, “Is it possible to cultivate the martial arts of the White Ape Gate?”

The bearded man shook his head slightly. “No. The martial arts of the White Ape Gate require starting from a young age, constantly stretching the tendons and bones to cultivate an Agile Ape Body. Your body has already taken shape, and your tendons and bones are set. To cultivate now... it is harder than ascending to the heavens.”

“……”

Xu Yunfan cupped his fists politely. “Thank you for the explanation, Gate Master.”

Watching Xu Yunfan turn and leave, the bearded man stroked his beard and shook his head slightly. At such an age, his practiced skills were not systematic; it was a pity to waste such a fine vessel.

“Senior Brother, I heard from the disciples that someone has come from outside the mountain to seek apprenticeship. I thought it wasn't the day to open the gates to accept disciples?”

A slightly weak voice sounded from behind the bearded man. Turning around, it was Liu Xiong. His face was pale, his breath weak, and his steps unsteady.

“Junior Brother, you should go rest. Healing your injuries is the most important thing. You don’t need to worry about these matters. It’s just a disciple who turned to the path halfway. Although his aptitude is decent, he has already missed the age for molding his body to practice the White Ape Body.”

The Gate Master frowned and stepped forward to support Liu Xiong.

“If you are fine, don't wander around. How could a Divine Weapon be so easy to fight over? That old demon Buddha of the Thousand Buddha Temple has likely already taken residence in Qingzhou. We still need to find a way to report this to Central State and have them send people to handle it. We shouldn't get involved.”

“Yes…”

At the foot of the mountain, Xu Yunfan stuffed the last handful of alfalfa into the Red Date Horse’s mouth.

The fierce horse, bought from Changyi for nearly a hundred taels of silver, rubbed affectionately against his palm. Its mane shimmered with a dark red glow in the twilight.

Over the past two months, this Red Date Horse had carried him across nearly the entire five-hundred-mile radius of Changyi. The horseshoes were worn smooth on the stone slabs of the main road; it was a rare steed.

It was difficult.

It was just as Liu Tianyun had said. These sects place great emphasis on background. Most prefer to cultivate from a young age, and many martial arts require a pure and upright body to learn. How could they be like Xu Yunfan, who used a Attribute Panel to force his way into a skill?

From Green Lotus Mountain to Cangwu Peak, behind the towering sect archways hid equally arrogant faces.

Last night in the inn, he heard that a scion of a noble family merely presented a visiting card and was welcomed up the mountain by twelve inner disciples carrying a sedan chair. As for a wild cultivator like him, even the outer courtyard servants require checking three generations of clean lineage. For someone like him, with an unknown origin yet possessing martial arts and formidable strength, most would be rejected.

Ordinary martial artists, if they practice skills that conflict with their original foundation, not only is it unclear if they can achieve success, but if they do, they will likely twist themselves into a bizarre shape.

Turning to the path halfway, with no family background, one simply cannot find the door.

However, over these days, he had come to understand why it was said that the sects of the Great Zhou Empire occupied a third of the world. Along the way, Green Lotus Mountain, Cangwu Mountain... these sects occupied vast territories. Not only the mountains themselves but also hundreds of thousands of acres of land below belonged to the sects.

They paid no taxes and no grain. In Qingzhou alone, there were over a dozen such sects. No wonder Li Haomiao looked so displeased when talking about these sects, let alone what the top nine sects of Great Zhou looked like.

In a sense, these were states within a state.

After feeding the fodder and taking a sip from his water pouch, Xu Yunfan pondered inwardly. Perhaps he should lower his requirements and look for small sects with unique characteristics?

Small sects in Qingzhou are in a weak position. According to the requirements of the Great Zhou government, third-rate sects must pay grain and taxes. With such constraints, their situation is naturally not as good as those major sects.

“Brother, were you going to Lian Baoshan to seek apprenticeship?”

Just as he was mounting his horse, preparing to go to a nearby small sect, a square-faced, righteous-looking man holding a blade emerged from the woods. He walked up to Xu Yunfan with a beaming smile. Under his dark tight-fitting clothes, the hem was stained with grass fragments, yet his smile was even more enthusiastic than the innkeeper's from earlier.

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised and didn't speak for a moment.

“Don't be nervous.”

The man shook his empty hands. “I am Zhang Tiehu, an outer sect steward of the Qixia Taoist Temple. Just now at the foot of Lian Baoshan, I saw you in the tavern inquiring about the rules of accepting disciples for various sects…”

He suddenly lowered his voice. “Are you looking for a proper sect to settle down in?”

The mountain wind rolled up the debris on the ground. Xu Yunfan stared at the bronze waist token swaying at the man's waist.

The surface was carved with cloud patterns, but the two characters for 'Qixia' in the center seemed newly engraved, and traces of old characters were still visible at the corners.

Xu Yunfan asked, “What are the specifics?”

“Of course, there are specifics. I specialize in this business, so I naturally understand the ins and outs.”

“Three hundred taels for the referral fee, guaranteeing you direct entry into the inner sect.”

Zhang Tiehu took half a step closer, and a sheepskin scroll slid out from his sleeve. “Although Qixia Taoist Temple isn't among the thirteen major sects of Qingzhou, the 'Thirteen Styles of Flowing Cloud' was a highly praised martial art back in the day. It has declined quite a bit now, but in Qingzhou, it is still quite famous…”

Xu Yunfan looked the blade-wielding man up and down. By the looks of him, he hadn't even reached the First-Rank Martial Master level, at most Small Completion of the First Rank.

Over the past month, he had encountered many martial artists of this level.

Or rather, in the martial arts world of Qingzhou, these wandering martial artists are mostly at this level. First-Rank Great Completion Martial Masters are not non-existent, but they are few.

Traveling all over Qingzhou, First-Rank Martial Masters mostly lurk and cultivate within these sects, or settle in cities. He had only encountered a dozen or so on the road, mostly traveling with a purpose, unlike those wandering martial artists wandering aimlessly.

To cultivate a martial art to Great Completion requires decent aptitude and sufficient resources to achieve success, so naturally, they all have roots.

This Zhang Tiehu in front of him was quite interesting.

“Fifty taels as a deposit.” After pondering for a moment, he let go of his hand and counted out the silver. “The remaining balance to be paid upon entering the mountain?”

“No problem, that's the way it should be!”

Zhang Tiehu accepted the silver with a beaming smile, biting it to check the tooth marks.

“Brother... no... Junior Brother, from now on, we are fellow disciples!”

The corners of Xu Yunfan's mouth twitched slightly, and he nodded slightly. “Please lead the way, Senior Brother.”

As dusk deepened, the two men leading the horse passed through a field of unmarked graves, walked along a narrow path, and circled up a desolate mountain.

Zhang Tiehu suddenly stopped and pointed at a few sparks in the distance.

“We're here.”

Xu Yunfan looked up and saw the firelight hanging halfway up the mountain, like a few red lanterns hanging under the night sky.
