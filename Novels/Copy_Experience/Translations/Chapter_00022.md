# Chapter 22: Qi Condensation Fourth Level

Back in his home in the market city, Lu Xu's heart finally settled down. This battle had truly been perilous. If he hadn't possessed the Yin Fire Thunder, a major killing weapon, he wouldn't know how it would have ended! The difference in combat power between early-stage Qi Condensation and mid-stage Qi Condensation was indeed vast. No wonder there were bottlenecks between minor realms; the quality and quantity of spiritual power differed too greatly.

"Good thing I had enough mid-grade Rank 1 talismans prepared, even if they were pseudo mid-grade."

Lu Xu took out his storage bag, placed the earthy-yellow small seal in front of him, and the bronze mask. Leaving aside everything else, just this storage bag was worth 300 spirit stones; the Yin Fire Thunder he had used had paid for itself. This was the lowest-grade storage bag, with an internal space of about one cubic meter.

Lu Xu first poured out a pile of spirit stones, counting them carefully; there were over two hundred. Next were a dozen or so low-grade Rank 1 talismans, which Lu Xu recognized as his own creations at a glance. Three mid-grade Rank 1 talismans: one Adamant Vajra Talisman and two Blazing Flame Talismans. A copy of the "Thick Rock Art" cultivation method, and some miscellaneous items.

When Lu Xu took out the last item from the storage bag, his face froze. It was a low-grade magical artifact, a small knife, not particularly eye-catching. But Lu Xu was not unfamiliar with this artifact; he recognized it at a glance as the one He Qing had possessed.

"So it was you who killed He Qing!" Lu Xu murmured. He sighed, faintly understanding why He Qing had died. "Fellow Daoist He, I've avenged you!"

After a moment of silence, Lu Xu put away the artifact and picked up the small seal, examining it carefully. He had just witnessed the immense power of Tan Hu's artifact; it could smash anything, proving effective against all. "Judging by the momentum just now, the force of that artifact's impact must have been at least ten thousand jin; it truly is a fine piece!"

Placing the artifact into his storage bag, Lu Xu's gaze finally settled on the bronze mask. He knew clearly that this item was definitely the most valuable gain from this expedition. He first picked up the bronze mask, erased Tan Hu's spiritual power imprint within it, and then imprinted his own spiritual power. As he put the mask on his face, Lu Xu immediately felt it rooting itself, growing onto his face, slowly merging. With a thought, his face twisted, and his entire being transformed into an unfamiliar appearance.

"Indeed, this is an artifact that changes one's appearance, so effective even Spirit Sight techniques can't see through it!"
"It can even alter one's aura and characteristics!"
"Hmm, it seems it can even conceal my cultivation, making it undetectable by Spirit Sight!"
"Good stuff, good stuff, this mask arrived just in time!"

After thoroughly exploring the functions of the bronze mask for a while, a look of pleasant surprise flashed across Lu Xu's face, and he carefully put it away. He burned all of Tan Hu's miscellaneous items, then placed all of his own valuable possessions into his storage bag for safekeeping. Now he possessed over eight hundred spirit stones, three magical artifacts, and an unknown mask. Oh, and the corpse of a Black-Scaled Serpent. He needed to find a way to dispose of this corpse.

"I'll just leave it in the storage bag for now. I need to raise my cultivation first!" Lu Xu thought to himself. He went to Hundred Herbs Pavilion and bought a bottle of Qi Replenishment Pills, then stayed within his small building, not venturing out.

One month later.

Inside Lu Xu's Dantian, a greenish Qi mass the size of a red date slowly rotated and floated. Wisps of greenish airflow emanated from it, entering the meridians, circulating through one grand cycle before returning. Each time they returned, the greenish airflow would grow a bit denser. As these trickling streams converged like rivers flowing into the sea, the greenish Qi mass seemed to reach a critical point. Suddenly, it stopped rotating, shook violently, and began to shrink rapidly. Like a gas-composed star rapidly collapsing, the surface of the red-date-sized greenish Qi mass roiled with gas, compressing continuously. In the end, it returned to its origin, shrinking back to the size of a soybean. Just as it had been when he was at Qi Condensation first level.

This time, however, within the greenish Qi mass, there seemed to be a hint of "wetness"! Lu Xu could distinctly feel that his spiritual power was no longer as "dry" as before. Instead, it was like the air after rain, carrying a hint of coolness. The greenish Qi mass began to rotate again, and as wisps of spiritual power entered his meridians, Lu Xu immediately felt a surge of power emanating from all over his body.

Qi Condensation Fourth Level!

"Indeed, this is a qualitative change in spiritual power. Next, it should be progressing towards liquefaction!" Lu Xu thought to himself. It was rumored that Foundation Establishment cultivators' spiritual power was liquid, while Golden Core cultivators condensed their spiritual power into a solid state.

"The strength of Qi Condensation Fourth Level cannot be compared to Qi Condensation Third Level!" Feeling the formidable spiritual power within him, a smile gradually appeared on Lu Xu's face.

"A low-grade Rank 1 Black-Scaled Serpent, hmm, fellow Daoist has good methods, such a demonic beast is quite rare!" In front of a shop, the owner, a white-haired old man, stroked the Black-Scaled Serpent's corpse with one hand while conversing with Lu Xu.

"This humble one also went through countless hardships to bring this beast here. I heard the scales of this Black-Scaled Serpent are materials for forging mid-grade defensive artifacts?" Lu Xu, disguised as a burly man, said.

"Indeed, although the Black-Scaled Serpent is only a low-grade demonic beast, its scales are exceptionally tough. There's no problem at all in forging mid-grade artifacts with them!"

"Haha, good to hear that, then make an offer!" Lu Xu let out a hearty laugh.

After pondering for a moment, the old man slowly said, "Eighty spirit stones!"

"A bit higher!"

"Can't go any higher, I wouldn't have any profit then!"

"Ninety spirit stones!"

"Absolutely impossible, eighty-two at most!"

After a round of bargaining, Lu Xu sold the demonic serpent for eighty-five spirit stones. After leaving the shop, he went outside the market city, found a quiet, uninhabited spot, and took off the bronze mask. He then returned to the market city and continued towards the trading district. He intended to see if Gao Tianqiang, the fishmonger, was still there. Lu Xu had always harbored a hint of doubt about this person.

Halfway there, he faintly heard a noisy commotion in the distance. Only when Lu Xu got closer could he hear clearly:

"Is it really the Divine Wood Sect?"
"Absolutely true! Marks of the Divine Wood Sect were found on the ruins!"
"Hurry, if we delay any longer, we'll be too late and miss out on the first spoils!"

A dozen or so people rushed out of the market city with a great clamor, then immediately mounted their artifacts and flew rapidly towards the horizon, looking very urgent.

"What ruins?" Lu Xu frowned slightly, looking around, seeing that various parts of the market city seemed to be subtly stirring. He was about to inquire in detail. Suddenly, a familiar figure entered his view. Lu Xu's eyes lit up, and he quickly stepped forward to greet them:

"Brother Leng, it's been several years since we last met!"
