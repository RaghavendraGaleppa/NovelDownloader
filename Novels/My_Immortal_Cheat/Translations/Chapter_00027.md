Chapter 27: Saint and Demon United!

The white-haired youth wore a gentle and benevolent smile. He extended a pale, jade-like hand, and energy converged, forming a white longsword wreathed in runes. With a light swing towards the giant hand, sword qi surged, spanning thirty thousand li, tearing the void asunder.

Clang!

The sword qi struck the golden giant hand, shaking the void. At the point of impact, countless runes were destroyed and reborn, and shockwaves spread, clearing the heavens and earth.

The giant hand was forced to abandon its suppression of the two figures, diverting all its power to counter the sword qi.

After all, he had come in his true body, so the white-haired youth still had reserves of power. He turned to the two black-robed figures and said, "How could I allow you to be suppressed? Carry on!"

"Yes!"

The two black-robed figures felt the suppressive force enveloping them vanish, their bodies suddenly lightened. They continued to control the black needles forward.

The golden giant hand radiated immense energy, divine light flickering as it clenched into a fist. A powerful recoil erupted, shattering the white sword qi.

From within the spatial rift, a rumbling sound like ancient divine thunder echoed forth.

"Saint-Demon? It's you! How did you smuggle yourself into the Nine Provinces?"

Elder Zhan clearly recognized the white-haired youth.

Saint-Demon smiled faintly, saintly light surging as flowers bloomed in the void. "Zhou Zhan, the Nine Provinces are my home. How can returning home be considered smuggling?"

He directly addressed Zhou Zhan by name, clearly an old acquaintance.

"Are you acting up again? Why are you attacking my Zhou family!" Zhou Zhan pressed on.

"Why do you speak so offensively? What's wrong with attacking your Zhou family? Bite me then!" Saint-Demon frowned slightly, speaking with clear displeasure.

"Let your other personality come out and speak with me!" Zhou Zhan's voice noticeably deepened.

"If he comes out just because you ask, wouldn't I lose face?" Saint-Demon rolled his eyes and replied.

Zhou Zhan clearly had no desire to speak further with him. The golden giant palm gathered energy, and runic chains as thick as mountain ranges coiled around it. Golden lightning materialized within his palm, which then clenched into a fist, grasping a golden lightning spear ten thousand li long. The lightning surged, shattering the void.

"Judgment!" Zhou Zhan roared, and the golden lightning spear, reaching heaven and earth, imbued with powerful demon-suppressing energy, shot directly towards Saint-Demon!

Saint-Demon narrowed his eyes, sensing the sealing and suppressing power in the void. He was a Saint, his energy leaning towards support, not particularly strong for direct offense.

"Sigh..."

With a soft sigh, a wisp of demonic energy emerged from the pure saintly light. Subsequently, boundless demonic qi enveloped everything, countless specters howled, and demonic sounds grated on the ears.

"Haha, I didn't expect to meet an old acquaintance so soon this time!"

The Demonic personality burst into laughter, and monstrous demonic qi converged, forming a pitch-black great halberd in his hand, roughly a zhang tall, its eerie black glow dazzling and intoxicating.

"Demonic War of the Eight Directions!"

A monstrous demonic silhouette appeared behind him, towering to the heavens and earth, nearly ten thousand zhang tall, its face indistinct. In its hand, it also wielded a ten-thousand-zhang great halberd.

The ten-thousand-zhang halberd swung, the lightning spear intimidating. Halberd tip and spear tip collided, supreme yang meeting supreme evil. The tremendous sound was silent, the sky shattered like a spiderweb, and a vast spatial storm raged, yet it was torn apart by the power generated from the collision.

The two black-robed figures below trembled nervously, their bodies shaking, terrified that the aftermath would reach them.

The black needles had gradually begun to corrode Zhou Tian's protective divine dragon. The golden dragon was half pitch-black and half golden, with flashes of struggle in its eyes. Although the Dragon's Fortune had been enhanced dozens of times this time, the black needles had also been significantly strengthened. While the grand formation had only expanded tenfold, the black needles it formed were far more than just ten times stronger, not to mention the numerous 'private goods' the two black-robed figures had added.

"Zhou Zhan, if your true body were here, you might still be able to contend with me. But merely fighting me by relying on this Sky-Searching Grand Formation to cross countless distances? I'm afraid that's still not enough!"

As the aftermath dispersed, a giant crater ten thousand li in diameter appeared where they had fought. The space within the crater intermittently shattered. After this collision, the space here had become incredibly fragile, likely remaining barren for a thousand years.

In the Zhou family ancestral land, Zhou Zhan's face was grim. He had miscalculated this time. He had originally thought it was merely a hidden adversary from the Tianqin Empire, but he never expected it to be Saint-Demon, that old fellow, causing trouble behind the scenes.

That old fellow was right; if he didn't descend in his true body, relying solely on a projection would be utterly insufficient to fight him.

"Is the teleportation grand array ready?!" Zhou Zhan bellowed.

"The distance is too great, and interfering arrays have been set up nearby. It will take a while longer to successfully pinpoint the location!" The news from the void was not good.

Feeling the black needles drawing closer and closer to Zhou Tian below, Zhou Zhan gritted his teeth and said, "Prepare the Projection Grand Array!"

"Elder Zhan! The Projection Grand Array is *within* the Nine Provinces..." The voice in the void spoke anxiously.

"I said, prepare the Projection Grand Array!" The voice in the void was interrupted by Zhou Zhan before it could finish speaking!

"Understood!"

In the void, five more smaller golden eyes appeared, combining with the initial one to form a larger eye. It emitted a faint golden light, enveloping Zhou Zhan's entire body, causing his form to become illusory.

Elsewhere, the golden giant hand vanished, and the golden giant eye high in the sky emitted a golden light. From it, a thin pillar of light shot down, and from within the pillar, a figure emerged: a white-haired middle-aged man, none other than Zhou Zhan.

"Zhou Zhan, he's not your illegitimate son, is he? This is *within* the Nine Provinces, and you're using a Projection Grand Array? Aren't you seeking death?" The Demonic personality said to Zhou Zhan.

"Hmph, the lives of my Zhou family members are not something you can take!" Zhou Zhan's entire body surged with energy, lightning spear in hand, tearing through space directly towards the Demonic personality!

"Come, come!" The Demonic personality's battle intent soared to the heavens. Demonic wings sprouted from his back, and he gripped his great halberd tightly, engaging Zhou Zhan in a fierce struggle.

Demonic flames spilled forth, thunder shook the heavens. The firmament was torn with cracks, the earth shattered, and ravines thousands of li deep appeared.

The lightning spear forced the black great halberd back. Zhou Zhan's figure suddenly blurred. Seeing this, the Demonic personality laughed loudly. "Haha, the arrays within the Nine Provinces were built by your combined efforts. The backlash must be quite uncomfortable!"

Zhou Zhan's eyes flickered uncertainly. The backlash grew heavier and heavier; he could not drag this out any longer.

RUMBLE!

Immeasurable lightning surged from Zhou Zhan's body: purple lightning containing immense destructive power, silver lightning surpassing space in speed, golden lightning imbued with unparalleled demon-suppressing force, and more, forming a sea of thunder.

Countless bolts of lightning enveloped Zhou Zhan, as if an ancient Thunder God commanded myriad thunders!

"Thunder Dao Severing Heaven!" With a mighty roar, the sea of thunder spread for ten thousand li, thick bolts of lightning churning within, and terrifying destructive power brewing.

"This old fellow has grown stronger again!" The Demonic personality watched the sea of thunder bearing down on him, his expression solemn.

"However..."

"I am..."

"...not bad either!"

A bizarre sight appeared on Saint-Demon's face: one half was light, the other half was darkness.

"Saint and Demon United!" Saint-Demon seemed to have gone mad, his expression deranged. Both personalities controlled the body simultaneously; this contradictory sensation was unbearable even for him.

A wisp of unknown energy appeared, drifting erratically, its aura hard to define, slowly circling Saint-Demon's body.
