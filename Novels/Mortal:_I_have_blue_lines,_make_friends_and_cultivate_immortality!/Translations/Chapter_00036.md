# Chapter 36: Obtaining the Thunder Spirit Root!

"Come take a look! Don't miss out!"

"Free high-grade primary talismans for new friends!"

By the new disciple recruitment area, Lin Yun set up his stall, placing a conch-shaped magical instrument on display. As he channeled spiritual energy into it, the conch emitted a series of promotional messages.

Listening to his own advertisement, Lin Yun frowned—it didn't seem catchy enough. He then took out another conch instrument and infused it with spiritual power. This one played a peculiar melody:

"Yue Country! Jianzhou! The largest talisman workshop in Yue Country's Jianzhou—the Yellow Maple Valley Talisman Workshop—has gone bankrupt!"

"That bastard workshop manager, Old Fu, gambled away 350 million spirit stones and ran off with his sister-in-law!"

"We have no choice but to pay wages with talismans!"

"High-grade primary talismans originally worth 50-60 spirit stones are now sold at a discount!"

"Bring one new friend for 10% off, two for 20% off! Bring ten new friends, and get a high-grade primary talisman for free!"

The unusual jingle quickly drew curious onlookers.

"Did I hear that right? Free high-grade primary talismans? How is that possible?" People exchanged glances—this was the first time they'd encountered something so bizarre.

A high-grade primary talisman, especially an offensive or defensive one, was worth 50-60 spirit stones. Giving them away for free would be a massive loss!

"Senior Brother, are you really giving away talismans for free?" Two fair-skinned, delicate-looking young boys who appeared to be twins approached Lin Yun's stall. They couldn't have been older than ten or eleven.

"Haha, of course! I wouldn't go back on my word after making such a public offer!" Lin Yun replied with a mysterious smile.

"Really? Then give me a hundred!" one of the boys exclaimed excitedly.

"Now, now, little brothers, there are conditions for the free talismans," Lin Yun wagged his finger, his expression resembling that of an older brother trying to swindle children out of their New Year's money with candy.

"You're not going to ask for spirit stones, are you?" one boy asked warily. The other added, "We're not that easy to fool."

"Haha, of course not." Lin Yun chuckled and pointed to the sign in front of his stall.

The two brothers read the sign: "Bring one new friend for 10% off, two for 20% off, ten for a free high-grade primary talisman. Note: Each person is limited to one opportunity."

"What? Only one talisman? And only one chance per person?" The Murong brothers looked disappointed. "Senior Brother, isn't that a bit stingy? One talisman isn't enough for anyone."

"Haha, you two are quite the shrewd little ones. My stall isn't just for you—think about how many people are in Yellow Maple Valley. If I gave everyone free talismans, I'd be left without even my underpants!"

"You have a point, Senior Brother."

"But if we bring people over, you won't go back on your word, right?" the other boy asked suspiciously.

"Haha, I'm just one person here. If you bring ten people, you'll outnumber me—how could I possibly refuse?" Lin Yun laughed.

"Fair enough!" The two boys nodded.

By now, Lin Yun's unusual advertising had attracted even more attention.

"Look! It's Lin Yun!"

"Heavens, it really is him!"

"What's he up to this time?"

"Giving away high-grade primary talismans for free?!"

"Seriously? Free high-grade talismans? Has he gone mad?!"

Once the crowd recognized Lin Yun, the Yellow Maple Valley cultivators grew excited. Ever since he had helped Han Li seek justice, Lin Yun's reputation had spread throughout the sect. Though he had since kept a low profile, his reappearance now drew a flood of curious onlookers.

"Senior Brother, who is this Lin Yun? Is he famous?" a new disciple asked.

"You don't know Lin Yun? He's the hero of all Qi Condensation disciples in Yellow Maple Valley! He got rid of that villain Elder Ye! Now we don't have to suffer exploitation when taking missions from the Hundred Tasks Hall. Even the elders have become more restrained since then."

The disciple proudly explained to the newcomer.

"Wow, so he's like a legendary righteous official?!" the new disciple exclaimed.

"Exactly! Come on, let's go see what he's up to!" The two joined the growing crowd around Lin Yun's stall.

The disciples eyed the high-grade talismans greedily.

"Senior Brother Lin, are these talismans really free?" one asked, swallowing hard in disbelief.

"Of course! Why don't eleven of you come forward and see for yourselves?" Lin Yun produced a magical instrument. "Fellow disciples, I'm doing this for your benefit. The talismans are limited—each person gets only one chance, whether buying or helping others get discounts."

"Buyers must first infuse this instrument with their spiritual energy. It will remember your energy signature, so don't bother trying to cheat. I advise against wasting your time."

The crowd murmured in understanding, though they had never seen such a device before. Soon, discussions broke out about who would take the first turn.

Naturally, everyone wanted to be the buyer—getting a free talisman was far better than helping others get discounts. Still, even helping ten people for a free talisman was a good deal, considering the value.

Before long, the first group of eleven stepped forward.

"Senior Brother Lin, we're ready."

They each infused the instrument with their spiritual energy.

Lin Yun nodded. "Would you all be willing to befriend me? These talismans are only for friends."

The eleven hesitated briefly before nodding. "We'd be honored."

Lin Yun smiled in satisfaction. Aside from the worthless Ice Spike Talisman, the rest were fantastic deals. The Red Copper Blade alone was worth about 100 spirit stones, while the high-grade talismans he was giving away were worth 50-60 spirit stones at most—an excellent trade.

As for how to sell the items later, the Chen family could handle that. If needed, he could wait until the demonic invasion, when prices would skyrocket.

"Each of you may choose one talisman from the stall," Lin Yun said.

"Really?!" One disciple covered his mouth in shock. He couldn't believe he was getting a high-grade talisman for free.

"Anything here?" The man eyed the golden talismans—clearly metal-attribute offensive talismans, among the finest of the five elements.

"Of course." Lin Yun nodded.

The crowd held their breath as the disciple picked up a Thousand Blades Talisman.

"Thank you, Senior Brother Lin!" the man said gratefully.

"You're welcome. Now, please step aside—your chance is over." Lin Yun gestured for them to leave.

The lucky disciple beamed, while the other ten looked dejected at having lost their opportunity.

The moment the talisman changed hands, the crowd erupted.

Eleven people splitting one free talisman might not seem like much, but free was free! A high-grade primary talisman normally required two months of labor for an average Qi Condensation disciple. Getting it for nothing but a verbal agreement of friendship was an incredible deal.

Moreover, if others took the offer and you didn't, you'd be at a disadvantage. The remaining disciples quickly formed groups of eleven, eager to secure their share before Lin Yun changed his mind.
