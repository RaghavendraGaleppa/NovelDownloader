**Chapter 223: The Terror of Twin Trees Village**

Night mist swirled around Twin Trees Village. Scarlet fire springs flowed, and the leaves of the black and white twin trees rustled in the warm breeze. Outside the village lay vast fields of thriving crops.

"Old Immortal, you've come again." At the village entrance, Old Man Liu grinned, appearing simple and honest, his face ruddy as he held a porcelain bowl, eating.

Though Cao Qianqiu was a manifestation of a Pure Yang consciousness, he had reined in his sun-like radiance, appearing no different from a flesh-and-blood body. His silver hair gleamed, his face glowed faintly, and his feathered robe was expansive.

"Hm." He nodded, sizing up Old Man Liu, then glanced at the old yellow dog lying by the courtyard gate. With his cultivation, he could easily discern that this was just an old hunter in a remote area.

Old Man Liu chuckled, "Have you eaten, Old Immortal? Why don't you come in and have some? Your complexion is truly getting better and better; you'll surely live to a hundred years old."

Cao Qianqiu shot him a glance. He pursued immortality; was this old man wishing him an "early death"? Besides Li Qingxu, all his disciples were already over a hundred years old.

Old Man Liu quickly slapped himself. "My apologies, Old Divine Immortal, I spoke wrongly. You will certainly live for ten thousand years without end."

Cao Qianqiu was dominant and overbearing, but he wouldn't stoop to bickering with a village elder. He looked at the forty-odd households under the night sky—blue bricks, gray tiles, wisps of smoke curling from chimneys—they were utterly ordinary.

He reached out and stroked the black and white twin trees at the village entrance, confirming they weren't dead wood coming back to life, but new trees that had just matured.

Afterward, he walked around the entire village, measuring it by foot. The sounds of crowing roosters and barking dogs occasionally broke the silence; the remote village was full of life.

The only abnormality was a mutated squirrel with fur like red silk, practicing martial arts with a young child. Both were grunting and puffing.

The red squirrel swung its fists, kicked its legs, darted about, and flicked its tail, all with remarkable precision. Divine wisdom was already flowing within its body.

Cao Qianqiu captured its 'thought-sense'; it surprisingly possessed a strong fighting spirit.

"Through wind and rain, I will rise! One day, I'll even raid *that person's* nest!" This was the belief that supported the red squirrel in its self-improvement and diligent progress.

Cao Qianqiu returned to the village entrance, looked at Old Man Liu, and said, "Tell me again, in detail, about the blood-stained kite incident you personally experienced as a child."

Finally, he ascended into the sky, disappearing into the pitch-black night.

In the Kunling region, the atmosphere was incredibly tense; a final great war was on the verge of breaking out! Along certain paths, old seniors at the forefront of their fields arrived, and Grand Ancestor-level figures appeared, drawing the gaze of countless people in the Night Mist World.

Such a grand spectacle hadn't appeared in many years. At the same time, this also implied a problem with the plateau outside the Third Forbidden Zone, otherwise, why would it alarm major figures from more than just one path?

Various academies were making intensive arrangements, dispatching airships to send their disciples away, planning to recall them once the commotion from this event subsided.

At the Mountain River Academy, in Qin Ming and Little Wu's residence—where green bamboo was fresh, golden vines sparkled, and a shimmering blue lake lay before the door—the two were fishing for five-colored dragon carp, then grilling them to entertain familiar faces like Ling Yu and Xin Youdao, a sort of farewell meal.

"We should be reuniting in Kunling soon, right?"

"Hard to say. The atmosphere this time feels off; too many experts have arrived."

During the meal, Qin Ming gained a lot, learning about many new techniques his master had been researching from Ling Yu, which gave him great inspiration. Of these, one interested him the most: the Heavenly Light Immortal Lotus Seed.

Using heavenly light as mud and flesh as soil, a Pure Yang seed is planted, grinding out an enlightened lotus of consciousness from the immortal path, which eventually flourishes into an immortal lotus. This was a prime example of a new technique that perfectly combined the Path of Rebirth and the Immortal Path, quite extraordinary and unique.

What Qin Ming cared about wasn't the power of this new technique, but its ability to change a person's spiritual disposition. He could control his flesh and alter his appearance, but his spiritual aura was hard to change. Now, this new technique provided a way, making it entirely possible for him to become a completely different person.

Ling Yu introduced the method, explaining that burying the Pure Yang seed into the flesh was equivalent to combining it with Heavenly Light. Whatever cultivation method was practiced, the spiritual aura would change accordingly.

Qin Ming mused. This didn't seem too difficult for him, as his Heavenly Light had long been merging with divine wisdom and conscious spiritual light. He tried the method on the spot, planting the accumulated conscious spiritual light that hadn't yet fused into the 'soil' of his flesh and Heavenly Light.

Then, he began to explore and circulate the technique. How overbearing was his Heavenly Light? Each day, after being illuminated by it, the accumulated conscious spiritual light had long possessed Pure Yang energy, completely unafraid of such refinement. Thus, he directly skipped the arduous seeding stage that others faced; there was no difficulty for him. Moreover, he also incorporated divine wisdom, and the effect seemed even better.

Ling Yu was dumbfounded. He had only roughly explained it once, and then he watched the other person succeed in cultivating it. It should be noted that his teacher felt this technique was still somewhat crude, not refined, and quite difficult to practice. Furthermore, Ling Yu himself was only in the process of practicing it; he had just deeply buried the Pure Yang seed in the soil of his flesh and Heavenly Light, and had yet to achieve much. At this moment, he was incredibly shocked.

Tang Jin arrived, and seeing this scene, she was also astonished. Why did her master's new technique pose no difficulty whatsoever in the hands of the Black and White Mountain youth?

Master Wu also widened his purple eyes in surprise. "No threshold, just cultivated it directly? And he figured it out himself based on the general idea."

Subsequently, Tang Jin personally transmitted the specific incantations to him, allowing him to refine and perfect the new technique—Heavenly Light Immortal Lotus Seed. Qin Ming immediately demonstrated it. All his conscious spiritual light condensed within his flesh and Heavenly Light, manifesting a heart lotus. This then merged with the Heavenly Light, capable of unleashing astonishing beams of light.

Unintentionally, he had cultivated a trump card!

"This..." Tang Jin felt a pang of regret. Such a heaven-blessed genius should indeed have been brought before her teacher earlier; he was naturally suited for the new technique. Then, she furrowed her brow and asked, "Why does your Heavenly Light Immortal Lotus Seed have an extra mysterious glow, and its power is greater than it should be?"

"I also fused divine wisdom into it," Qin Ming informed her.

"He can cultivate three paths simultaneously?!" Even Master Wu was shocked. He had heard of those who progressed on two paths, but this was the first time encountering such a powerhouse strong in all areas.

Qin Ming shook his head. "Alas, I can only walk the Path of Rebirth. I've been 'kidnapped'."

Even so, everyone present was stunned. He was 'bound' simply because his Heavenly Light energy was too overbearing. It took them a while to regain their composure.

During the meal, Tang Jin maintained her composure and did not ask further about Demon Seed Yao Yi. Qin Ming, however, was very generous, sketching out Yao Yi's appearance and showing it to them.

The purple-eyed crow said, "The outside world is going crazy with rumors now. He's been beating Cao Qianqiu in their shared domain. Material from the secret realm has been sent to the desks of all major sects; he's regarded as the next generation's Demon God and will be targeted and studied by people from all paths."

"A person fears fame just as a pig fears gaining weight; becoming famous young isn't always good," Little Wu said. "If a true demon seed existed, it would be hard for it to survive."

The others also nodded. Without Grand Ancestor protection, how could a young demon seed possibly grow? It would surely die young. Afterward, the atmosphere relaxed.

"We should go too!"

At Mountain River Academy, one huge airship after another set sail, flying into the night sky.

"Aren't we at an advantage? Why are we retreating?" Someone asked, puzzled.

"The academy's higher-ups made this decision; there must be a deeper meaning," some people said with grim expressions.

Qin Ming and Little Wu were on the same airship. Their destination was the neighboring dynasty—Great Yu. After boarding the airship, Qin Ming paid a high price for more escape parachutes and shared them with Little Wu.

"Brother, is it really necessary?" Wu Yaozu looked at him strangely. He hadn't expected Brother Ming to be so afraid of death, so severely acrophobic.

"Do you still remember how I met you? Falling from the sky!" Qin Ming sighed, already having developed a psychological trauma; he had fallen from the sky more than once. Then, he chuckled, "Didn't you say you couldn't find your way back? There's no need to worry at all. If worst comes to worst, take an airship to that region, and you'll be home with just one leap."

"Don't tell me, that really is a way!" Little Wu nodded.

That day, numerous airships set sail, flying towards the three great dynasties: Yu, Qian, and Rui. Kunling was located between them, and due to the presence of multiple forbidden zones, no party dared to occupy it.

Little Wu looked back and said, "Why do I feel like we're leaving and never coming back? Sigh, I just got familiar with a region, and now we're rushing away again."

The night mist was thick. The airship traversed the sky, and Qin Ming and Little Wu entered the territory of Great Yu that very day. This time, they didn't stop mid-journey to collect 'Heavenly Essence' or other resources, so their speed was faster.

Under the inky, viscous night, Twin Trees Village was peaceful, with no abnormalities. However, in the night sky, black mist surged. In the abyss-like heights, Cao Qianqiu had been gone for a long time, and an indescribable aura permeated the area, disturbing some night birds. Occasionally, more spiritual raptors passing by would have their feathers stand on end, instantly changing their flight path, not daring to approach this area. But some foolish birds, unaware, would silently plummet if they flew into this area. That day, the villagers picked up some dead birds, considering it an extra meal.

In fact, this was just the visible area; in the unseen places, it was extremely terrifying and dreadful, because Cao Qianqiu was crawling out of the black mist. He seemed to be in an invisible tunnel. Although he was a Pure Yang spiritual body, he appeared no different from his true body, covered in blood, which represented the loss of Pure Yang essence.

This was his second time here, and he had hit a wall again. Moreover, this time he retreated even faster! Perhaps no one could have imagined that Cao Qianqiu's face was now pale, and when he looked back, his facial muscles twitched, showing considerable apprehension and unease. Behind him, something seemed to have appeared. Although slow, it seemed to be pursuing him.

Long hair, black and shiny, was wrapped around his hands, stained with blood. It clearly didn't belong to him; he had picked it up while crawling through the invisible tunnel in the night mist. He was originally a Pure Yang spiritual body, his palms capable of emitting sun-like beams of light. But now, his face was grim, his brows deeply furrowed, and as he moved through the tunnel, his five fingers were corroded, emitting white smoke as if being burned.

A movement came from behind. His expression suddenly changed, and the moment he turned his head, his pupils contracted even further as he rapidly charged forward. At this moment, his face was actually slightly pale—an expression never seen on him normally. Clearly, he had suffered a tremendous loss here today!

Finally, Cao Qianqiu crawled out of the tunnel, burst from the black mist, and emerged into mid-air. He was surprisingly stumbling, as his injuries were not light. One of his feet seemed to have kicked an exotic metal plate; the toes of his Pure Yang spiritual body were broken, and it was stained with blood. In addition, a rusty spear was stuck in his body, making his steps unsteady and his gait wobbly. He didn't pull it out immediately, choosing instead to rush wildly into the distance.

"Old Divine Immortal, he really can fly!" Below, by the fire spring in Twin Trees Village, Old Man Liu exclaimed in surprise.

At this moment, Cao Qianqiu glanced deeply at him. He didn't stop, nor did he show any intention of attacking anyone, and he flew away like a strange bird in the night sky. He didn't unleash his crimson sun; his body only glowed faintly, much more subdued than when he arrived. Moreover, his hurried demeanor was as if he were fleeing!

"Old Divine Immortal seems to be bleeding. Why does he look somewhat like a blood-stained kite himself?" Old Man Liu gazed into the distance.

"Uncle Liu, look, the fire spring has brightened up again," said Village Head Xu Yueping.

The fire spring gurgled and flowed, running into the fire fields outside the village, nourishing all the crops, which glowed a vivid red.

Old Man Liu said, "Last time, it was also due to his arrival that our fire spring became more active. If this continues, it will soon become a second-tier fire spring."

"He truly is a divine immortal! I never thought I'd see a person who could fly in my lifetime!" Xu Yueping exclaimed, filled with awe towards the direction Old Cao had departed.

"But... the Divine Immortal is bleeding!" Yang Yongqing said, his voice trembling, his face filled with fear as he gazed at the night sky. It turned out that the blood-stained kite incident Old Man Liu spoke of in his early years was all true.

Cao Qianqiu fled, but he always felt something was chasing him from behind, though he couldn't see or touch it. It wasn't until he was three thousand *li* away that the throbbing anxiety and unease in his heart gradually disappeared.

At this point, his face darkened. His injuries today were even worse than last time; he had truly broken his foot. If this were to spread, the old fellows on other paths would surely die laughing!

"Ah, Senior Cao?!" Someone exclaimed in surprise.

In fact, Cao Qianqiu had already sensed people in the distance beforehand. His expression was cold. He pointed a finger, and with a boom, a beam of blood-red light shot out, instantly causing a Pure Yang conscious spiritual light to explode. Clearly, that was also a master, someone of considerable standing capable of traveling as a conscious spiritual light, yet he was instantly killed.

His face was indifferent; he was injured and didn't want others to know. Soon, he began to heal. There was an inexplicable aura entanglement within his body that infuriated him, temporarily unremovable, though outwardly he appeared to have recovered. It was also at this moment that he pulled out the rusty spear, gripping it in his hand. Only then did a faint smile gradually appear on his face. The value of this spear was immeasurable!

However, when he thought of that region, his face turned grim again. The various experiences filled him with anger and resentment; he wished he could immediately kill his way back and fight another battle. Cao Qianqiu composed himself, becoming cold and rigid once more. His broad sleeves were no longer tattered, and Pure Yang light emanated from his body. When he set off again, he was like a crimson sun blazing across the sky, illuminating all things as he headed directly for Kunling City, twenty thousand *li* away.

"Hiss, Cao Qianqiu reappears! He's back from Black and White Mountain, and he's high-profile this time. Did he get his revenge?!"

Along the way, as he passed by some cities, he made no attempt to conceal himself, streaking across the sky and shaking the vast night. The thick night mist violently churned, scorched away. For a time, a crimson sun hung in the sky, illuminating the path.

However, when he passed over a desert, his Pure Yang conscious spiritual light suddenly extinguished, and Old Cao plummeted, crashing onto the ground with a bang. With a thud, a massive crater appeared. Cao Qianqiu was instantly furious. How could he fall from the sky? This shouldn't happen to a Pure Yang spiritual body at all.

"Is it because of the desert? Even so, it shouldn't be this bad!" He thrust the rusty spear into the ground. However, in the end, he stumbled out of the vast desert, his face ashen. Innumerable bizarre scenes haunted his conscious spiritual light, eroding his mind. It wasn't until he had run for over a thousand *li* on the ground that he shook off this state.

Cao Qianqiu set off again, still using his conscious spiritual light to pierce through the night sky. After flying another thousand *li*, he suddenly plunged into a pitch-black abyss. He felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar, the chill piercing to the bone. In such a place, even he felt some apprehension. Ultimately, a phantom, skeletal claw snatched away a piece of his Pure Yang flesh and blood.

"What happened? That's Cao Qianqiu traveling, yet his Pure Yang conscious spiritual light unexpectedly 'extinguished' several times along the way, mysteriously disappearing. Is something wrong?"

Naturally, countless people were watching him along the way. After compiling the news, people were surprised to discover that Old Cao had 'fallen from the sky' before, nearly getting into trouble in some special regions.

Cao Qianqiu was furious. He seemed to be possessed by bad luck, falling from the sky five times in a row, each time more serious than the last. He encountered indescribable things, and his very life was threatened. When he was very young, his master had once said that when traveling in the Night Mist World, no matter how high your cultivation, even if you could participate in creation, you must not be high-profile, or something would surely go wrong.

Cao Qianqiu had always remembered his master's teachings. However, after reaching the peak, he believed nothing could threaten him. As long as he didn't venture into special places or the deep parts of the Night Mist World, the vast lands under the endless night could be traversed at his will. However, today he was educated repeatedly, making him recall his master once more. The old path-opener of yesteryear eventually returned his soul to the night mist, dying mysteriously.

Cao Qianqiu still defied fate. He set off again. Ahead, the night mist was boundless, a seemingly ordinary region, but today, he felt a chill down his spine there. Within the night mist, an old wooden house stood silent and desolate. It made him fall from the sky; he was inexplicably enveloped by strange mist and dragged into the house.

"This is too much!"

Cao Qianqiu was enraged. The number of times he had fallen from the sky this day exceeded all his previous life, and he frequently found himself in inexplicable dangers. Inside the old wooden house, there was a great commotion. Eventually, Cao Qianqiu used the rusty spear to tear open the doors and windows, only then rushing out, his Pure Yang blood continuously flowing. This time, his injuries were very severe.

"Old Senior Cao seems to have fallen again, experiencing inexplicable dangerous incidents." Along the way, someone exclaimed in shock. Because Cao Qianqiu was traveling high-profile, whenever his crimson sun extinguished, something had certainly gone wrong, visible to people from afar, who could even feel the angry fluctuations of his conscious spiritual light.

"It's normal for the Night Mist World's true nature to be unfathomable. If people understood it, *that* would be abnormal," an old senior remarked. Someone even stated bluntly, "Even Grand Ancestor-level figures must travel discreetly, or something will go wrong!"

When Cao Qianqiu fell from the sky for the eighth time, his own face turned pale. This time, he landed in a dense forest, a place he recognized. After his master mysteriously returned his soul to the night mist years ago, leaving no corpse, Cao Qianqiu had erected many cenotaphs in various places. This was one of them. The old grave was overgrown with mugwort, even collapsed and level with the ground, but he still recognized it at a glance; he had fallen precisely onto the old grave's original spot.

This time, Cao Qianqiu didn't feel danger, but he became even more wary. Some unknown force seemed to have entangled itself with him in the dark. Could it be that he still hadn't escaped the influence of Black and White Mountain? But he had already fled fifteen thousand *li*!

The tenth time, as he traveled through the night sky, he inexplicably encountered a meteorite wrapped in extraterrestrial light, which slammed into him. If it were any other master, they would surely have exploded. After all, such a massive meteorite combined with extraterrestrial light was enough to bore through the earth, causing widespread subsidence. But Old Cao endured it. His Pure Yang spiritual body rapidly reformed after shattering. He was furious and horrified; everything was beyond his control. He wondered if this bad luck was going to plague him forever.

Cao Qianqiu was arrogant and stubborn. His temper flared, but he still didn't change, once again setting off in a high-profile manner. When he passed through a rumored land of the netherworld, something indeed went wrong again. It was said that quasi-divine beings had died here, turning it into cold yin soil. Cao Qianqiu was torn by an inexplicable force and dragged underground. He fought here for more than half a day before seeing the Night Mist World again. By this time, he was covered in wounds, and his Pure Yang conscious spiritual light had dimmed.

After Old Cao had fallen thirteen times in a row, he finally stopped. He no longer traveled like a blazing sun across the sky, but flew discreetly towards the Kunling region. For the last few thousand *li* of his journey, Cao Qianqiu encountered no more incidents. The path was smooth, very peaceful. He fell silent, wondering, had he been taught a lesson by the Night Mist World earlier? Or perhaps, he had been affected in the Black and White Mountain region, and only after fleeing eighteen thousand *li* did he gradually escape its influence?

Cao Qianqiu finally arrived discreetly at Kunling City, sparking widespread discussion.

"Did something happen to you on the road?" Sun Taichu asked with a serious expression after hearing the news and personally coming to see him.

"I almost died!" Cao Qianqiu said in a deep voice, extremely displeased. This journey had been too arduous; he was just traveling, yet incidents kept happening repeatedly.

Sun Taichu said, "The Night Mist World is vast and boundless, with too many unknowns and mysteries. Some things even we cannot discern. Do not overly trust your current power!"

Great Yu, Qionghua City, was exceptionally prosperous, with bustling streets.

"Boss, your business is really good; this food is so unique!" Little Wu exclaimed, stopping at a stall. Sugared spiritual fruits, bear paws—everything was available. He called out, "Give me a skewer of sugared turtle!"

"This is marinated with honey; it's called 'turtle honey'!" the boss corrected.

A moment later, Qin Ming and Little Wu each gnawed on a skewer of sugared turtle, beginning to familiarize themselves with the city. After all, they might be staying here for a while.

Two days later, news arrived like a massive explosion, shattering Qionghua City's tranquility and stirring up colossal waves across the entire Night Mist World. The Grand Ancestors from various paths had made their move in the Kunling region, pushing into the plateau. The earth had subsided, and even the Third Forbidden Zone was suspected to have been flattened.

However, after that, there was no further news. The entire Kunling region seemed to have fallen into complete silence, with the heavy night covering all areas. On that day, many experts entered one after another to explore. Suspected flashes of blood light appeared, and they all never returned.

The Kunling region was utterly quiet, completely silent, while the entire Night Mist World boiled over!
