# Chapter 45: Potato Mine  

The Black Mist Space held two pleasant surprises for Gu Mo. The first and most obvious was the appearance of a new plant in the vending machine window.  

**Name:** Potato Mine  
**Grade:** 1st Tier, Low Grade  
**Effect:** Inflicts powerful explosive damage upon activation.  
**Planting Conditions:** 1st Tier Spirit Field.  

For 25 units of Solar Essence, Gu Mo purchased one Potato Mine. Indeed, at just 25 units, it was currently the cheapest plant available. However, considering that the Potato Mine was a single-use consumable, the price wasn’t exactly cheap either.  

*Just how powerful is this "powerful explosive damage"?* Gu Mo examined the fist-sized potato in his hand—this was merely the seed. The true form of the Potato Mine would only reveal itself after planting.  

Unlike the actively attacking Peashooter, the Potato Mine was clearly a passive defensive plant. Burying them around his spirit field seemed like an excellent choice.  

With that thought, Gu Mo spent another 75 units of Solar Essence to buy three more Potato Mines, planning to plant them later.  

Next, he turned his attention to the other side of the Black Mist Space. As the mist continued to recede, a new object had appeared—a door.  

Opening the door revealed an interior still shrouded in mist, its contents indiscernible. Gu Mo tried using Solar Essence to disperse the mist inside, which worked smoothly. However, this only affected the mist within the door; the mist in the main Black Mist Space remained untouched.  

This meant the space behind the door was separate from the main area. *What could be inside?* Gu Mo’s curiosity was piqued.  

Unfortunately, with his Solar Essence running low, he had to set aside his exploration of the door for now.  

Exiting the Black Mist Space, Gu Mo took the four Potato Mines and began searching for suitable planting spots. As defensive plants, their primary purpose was to protect his Sunflowers and his cabin. Fortunately, both were located close to each other, so he buried all four Potato Mines in the area around the Sunflowers.  

*This takes a while.*  

After planting, Gu Mo waited for about an hour before a small, round-headed stick emerged from the soil—the trigger for the Potato Mine.  

If one wasn’t paying close attention, it would be easy to overlook this tiny stick. Moreover, once buried, the Potato Mine emitted no spiritual energy fluctuations whatsoever. For cultivators accustomed to sensing such fluctuations to detect danger, this made the Potato Mine an exceptionally stealthy threat.  

But Gu Mo still didn’t know exactly how powerful it was. *Should I test it?*  

Using a Potato Mine for testing meant wasting 25 units of Solar Essence, but understanding its true power would allow him to make better tactical decisions.  

*Fine, let’s test it!*  

In the end, Gu Mo decided to go ahead. Twenty-five units of Solar Essence was just two and a half days’ worth of harvest. If the Potato Mine’s power turned out to be unexpectedly strong, he could use it more effectively in the future.  

Keeping his distance, Gu Mo picked up a stone and threw it at the round-headed stick.  

*Huh? It didn’t explode?*  

He clearly saw the stick being triggered, yet the Potato Mine remained inert.  

*Does it have an anti-misfire feature?*  

Upon closer inspection of the plant’s properties, Gu Mo confirmed that the Potato Mine indeed had such a function—non-living objects wouldn’t trigger it. Additionally, it had a whitelist feature, meaning people on the list could step on it without setting it off.  

*That’s incredibly thoughtful.*  

These features made the Potato Mine highly practical. Now, he wouldn’t have to worry about accidentally triggering his own mines if he forgot their locations.  

For testing purposes, however, Gu Mo disabled the anti-misfire function. Then, he stepped back and threw another stone at the stick.  

**BOOM!**  

A deep explosion erupted in an instant, leaving behind a crater roughly three meters in diameter. The pit wasn’t large, but the soil and rocks within had been utterly obliterated.  

Gu Mo imagined himself standing in that blast radius—death would have been certain.  

This meant the Potato Mine could instantly kill early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, whether they were at the first, second, or third layer. Mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators would likely suffer severe injuries, though Gu Mo wasn’t sure about late-stage ones, as their higher mobility might allow them to escape the blast radius.  

Still, the Potato Mine lived up to its description—*powerful explosive damage*. Compared to the Peashooter, which had an attack power equivalent to a second-layer Qi Refinement cultivator, the Potato Mine was far stronger in raw force. Of course, one was a single-use weapon while the other was a sustained attacker, each with its own advantages.  

*High power, small range—perfect for the spirit field.*  

Gu Mo was extremely satisfied. His Sunflowers and Water Spirit Rice were planted in the field, and if the Potato Mine’s explosion radius were too large, it could damage his crops. The current size was just right.  

After filling in the test crater, Gu Mo bought another Potato Mine from the Black Mist Space and planted it before returning to his cabin, feeling much safer with both Peashooters and Potato Mines guarding his territory.  

*Wait!*  

He stopped Yuan Niya just as she was about to enter. Another month had passed, and she had arrived right on schedule. But this time, Gu Mo didn’t immediately let her in—he needed to add her to the Potato Mine’s whitelist first.  

*Wouldn’t want my employer stepping on a landmine.*  

“What’s wrong?” Yuan Niya looked at him in confusion, scanning the surroundings. The illusion array over the spirit field was fully active, so she couldn’t see inside. However, as an inner sect disciple, she had already learned about Gu Mo’s attempts to cultivate high-grade Water Spirit Rice.  

To her, his secrecy was understandable—after all, a mere outer sect disciple trying to grow such advanced crops either had a death wish or some hidden method.  

“Nothing.”  

Once Yuan Niya was added to the whitelist, Gu Mo let her inside.  

“Junior Brother Gu Mo,” she said as soon as she entered, “can you increase the intensity of the Cleaning Technique?”
