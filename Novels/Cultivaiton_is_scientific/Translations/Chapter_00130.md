# Chapter 130: Six Arms (Bonus Chapter for Reader 171021102948988)

The three-headed, six-armed bronze corpse was placed into the 'Nether Ghost Realm Formation'. The surgery was merely the prerequisite for modification—now it was time to see how the transformation technique would synergize with the formation's effects.

Li Shiming continuously cast a series of frost-laden runes, each landing precisely on the modified areas of the corpse. Within the ghostly domain of the formation, yin-attributed spiritual energy surged into the corpse's body, converging at the points marked by the transformation runes.

The main head of the bronze corpse burned with ghostly blue flames in its eyes. As vast amounts of yin energy poured in, the flames grew even more intense. At that moment, two smaller flames split from the main fire and flew toward the two additional heads.

The eyes of the two new heads snapped open, revealing the same ghostly blue flames—the telltale sign of a refined corpse's spiritual essence.

Li Shiming didn't interfere with the corpse's autonomous transformation process. This was the bronze corpse's natural instinct. Although the modification technique provided guidance, it was ultimately just an auxiliary tool—the true transformation was completed by the corpse itself.

Li Shiming had provided the ideal environment for modification—the ghostly domain created by the third-grade spiritual artifact 'Nether Ghost Realm Formation'—and had meticulously connected the most delicate nerves and blood vessels required for the three-headed, six-armed form. 

This served as a roadmap for the corpse to follow during its final autonomous transformation. When the two additional heads ignited with the glow of refined corpse spirits, Li Shiming's greatest concern was alleviated, and his furrowed brows finally relaxed.

The bronze corpse would remain in the formation for an extended period. By evening, Li Shiming realized he'd forgotten something important.

"Ah, I didn't message Fei'er!" he suddenly remembered.

He retrieved his communication token, which contained several messages from Ren Fei'er:

"Big brother, where's my new story?"

"Big brother, you left without telling me! I'm angry!"

"Mean guy, when are you coming back?"

...

"Big brother, are you back yet?"—this one had arrived in the afternoon.

"I know you're back—why aren't you replying?" Sent an hour later, when Li Shiming had been too absorbed in modifying the corpse to check his token.

"I just got back today and was cultivating!" Li Shiming hastily replied.

After waiting a while with no response, he didn't dwell on it—perhaps Ren Fei'er was busy and hadn't seen his message, just as he had missed hers earlier.

Unbeknownst to him, Ren Fei'er was fuming. She had been worried about Li Shiming during his absence and had been secretly inquiring about him through her sister, Yin Shilan.

That afternoon, when she contacted Yin Shilan, she noticed her sister was in an unusually good mood. Being clever, she immediately guessed that Li Shiming had returned—which was why she had reached out to him.

But Li Shiming hadn't replied, even though he had contacted Yin Shilan the moment he returned. A feeling she had never experienced before welled up in Ren Fei'er's heart.

She had never felt jealousy before, let alone imagined she could feel it toward her own sister. She shook her head vigorously, trying to dispel the emotion.

"Mean Li Shiming!" she muttered, staring at her communication token. If only he would send a few more messages, she might forgive him.

Li Shiming, oblivious to her thoughts, was entirely focused on the bronze corpse's transformation progress.

Ren Fei'er angrily put away her token, her large eyes darting mischievously. Anyone who knew her well would recognize the look—she was plotting something.

By the next morning, the bronze corpse rose from the ghostly domain. Its three heads tilted back simultaneously, unleashing a deafening roar that echoed like crashing waves—as if heralding a rebirth.

Li Shiming immediately checked the blood contract binding the corpse. Finding it intact and still under his control, he extended his consciousness into the corpse to assess its condition.

The three-headed, six-armed bronze corpse retained its original head as the primary one, with the two additional heads displaying noticeably lower intelligence. 

Li Shiming's main concern was whether the new additions would degrade the corpse's quality. The original material—the body of a single-spiritual-root genius—was exceptionally rare. Just recalling the terrifying talent of someone like Baili Jinyan (though not all single-spiritual-root cultivators were the same) underscored how precious such a foundation was.

Only a corpse with a single spiritual root could maintain the absorption efficiency of spiritual energy necessary for rapid growth. Natural undead might take a century to become bronze corpses and a millennium to reach iron corpse status—unless their original bodies also belonged to single-spiritual-root cultivators.

For most cultivators, raising a corpse without such innate absorption capabilities wasn't worth the effort—their growth would lag far behind the cultivator's own progress. By the time such a corpse reached the Qi Refining stage, the cultivator might already be three generations removed from its creation. What use would it serve?

Fortunately, Li Shiming's fears didn't materialize. Though the skeleton had been replaced, the corpse's core remained that of a heavenly spiritual root. While the two new heads absorbed spiritual energy at a noticeably slower rate, the impact was manageable. The bronze corpse could sustain the additional burden of two heads and two arms.

However, the new additions would slow its growth. It would take considerable time for the corpse to fully assimilate the new parts and elevate their spiritual energy absorption to heavenly spiritual root levels. 

Until then, the corpse's progress would be delayed. But with the 'Nether Ghost Realm Formation' and Li Shiming's current fourth-layer Qi Refining cultivation, he had ample time to nurture its development.

The dim-witted nature of the two new heads was actually beneficial—they obeyed the primary head without question, displaying no resistance. This made sense, as their spiritual essence had been derived from the main head, establishing an inherent hierarchy.

Li Shiming then tested the corpse's movement. The six arms initially felt awkward, but the four new limbs were controlled by the secondary heads. After some adjustment, the bronze corpse could maneuver all six arms fluidly.

This highlighted the bronze corpse's innate combat instincts. Whether naturally occurring or artificially refined, these creatures existed for battle. Even with three heads and six arms—or any other bizarre configuration—they could quickly adapt and weaponize their forms.

Li Shiming left the corpse in the formation to continue acclimating to its new body.

The 50,000-spirit-stone order from the Yun Trading Company would take at least five days to fulfill, even with prioritized processing due to his status as a valued partner. Once delivered, he could fully equip his newly enhanced bronze corpse.

That evening, Li Shiming messaged Ren Fei'er again, but again received no reply. Several days passed with no contact, and he grew concerned for her safety. Yet he realized there was little he could do—he didn't know where she lived, which sect she belonged to, or any way to reach her beyond the silent communication token.

Suppressing his worry, he trusted that Ren Fei'er's intelligence and connections would see her through any trouble.

On the fourth day of her silence, Yin Shilan left a message saying she had urgent business and would be unavailable for some time, promising to update him upon her return.

Soon after, the five mid-grade magical artifact Gatlings Li Shiming had ordered arrived, plunging him back into work.

With prior experience, the construction of the five new Gatlings proceeded much faster. His improved mastery of formations also allowed him to enhance their original designs.

In three days, all five were completed, and he even upgraded the original Gatling. Each now boasted power equivalent to late seventh-layer Qi Refining—approaching eighth-layer strength.

Meanwhile, the bronze corpse's body stabilized. Testing revealed that even without the Gatlings, its combat prowess had increased by at least 30%, thanks not only to its new limbs but also to the foundation-stage cultivator's bones integrated into its frame.

Li Shiming briefly fantasized about acquiring a golden core cultivator's skeleton to elevate the corpse to iron-grade strength—but dismissed the thought. Not only were such materials unobtainable, but allowing the corpse to grow too powerful too quickly could be dangerous.

With time on his hands, he resumed taking on sect formation assignments to earn contribution points, having long since lost interest in spirit stone rewards.

But this routine was soon interrupted by a message that demanded his immediate attention:

"Big brother, come to Qingyi Island quick—I need help!" 

After days of silence, Ren Fei'er's abrupt plea was followed by another disappearance.

Though puzzled—Qingyi Island lay deep in the ocean, far beyond the communication token's supposed range near the Tianhai defense line—Li Shiming didn't hesitate. Ren Fei'er was one of his few friends in this world.

After retrieving the bronze corpse from Eagle Beak Island's underground chamber, he prepared to depart immediately. To save time, he opted for his jade flying boat despite the risk of attracting the Holy Ice Sect's attention.

Meanwhile, on Qingyi Island, Ren Fei'er sat on a smooth rock, swinging her slender legs idly.

"He should have gotten my message by now," she mused, gazing at the horizon. "If he doesn't come, I'll never speak to him again!"

She had run away from home again—without telling anyone—to prove something important: that Li Shiming cared about her.

Qingyi Island, located a few hundred miles behind the foundation-stage cultivators' defensive line, was relatively safe—only first-grade sea beasts roamed the area, all of which she could handle. She knew Li Shiming's combat prowess and his spirit turtle shield's defenses would protect him here too.

This wasn't about life-or-death danger—she just wanted him to come so they could return together happily.

Having calculated that Li Shiming's crow-feather wings would take about twenty hours to reach the island at full speed, she set about staging a crisis before his arrival.

Qingyi Island was a small outpost marked on maps as a hunting ground for sea beasts. With most cultivators currently defending the Tianhai line, the island was deserted.

Ren Fei'er took out a formation disk, inserted four spirit stones, and activated it, creating a protective barrier with a ten-meter radius.

Next, she produced a vial of spirit-attracting liquid stolen from her mother—a potion that lured sea beasts. After dripping a single drop, which vaporized into a fragrant mist, she frowned.

"Maybe that's not enough," she muttered, carelessly pouring out a quarter of the vial.

Instantly, the fragrant mist spread across the entire island, unaffected by wind. Sea fish emerged from the water, swimming toward shore—some even beaching themselves in their frenzy to reach the scent's source.

Five sea beasts soon appeared.

"Too much?" Ren Fei'er watched the chaotic scene unfold but remained unperturbed. As a seventh-layer Qi Refining cultivator with powerful artifacts and her protective formation, she felt secure.

More sea beasts would come, but she was confident in her ability to handle them.
