# Chapter 50: Various Reactions

"The match is about to begin!" Zhou Xunchuan declared. Having received a royal education since childhood, he exuded the aura of an elder brother, even though he wasn't the oldest among them.

"We must get a good look at the peerless grace of the Crown Princess of Qin!" Gu Feng laughed. Unlike his father's calm and dignified nature, he was quite lively, perhaps due to his youth.

"Then we'll just stay here and watch. It's not very comfortable around the elders. Zhou Tian, you can't kick us out…" Zhou Zui sprawled comfortably on a chair. The Xiaoyao King, in his younger days, was a mischievous little devil, but now he was very strict with his son, though seemingly to no avail.

"I wouldn't dream of it…" Zhou Tian smiled and agreed. This group of friends was quite interesting. Although he couldn't cultivate, none of them looked down on him because of it. Their relationships were quite good, and he was very satisfied with that, as he was merely a "salted fish" – content with his lot, perhaps occasionally flipping over, but he couldn't stand daily scheming and power struggles.

The war drums beat with increasing urgency, pounding like morning bells and evening drums, resounding across the sky, yet falling just right on everyone's ears. As the drums grew more intense, the audience's chatter gradually quieted.

Dong!

With the last heart-shaking drumbeat, the array patterns on the building's walls became even more striking, appearing almost tangible. They were kings of beasts, strangely shaped and exuding monstrous ferocity. Though depicted as mere patterns, they seemed to possess life, incredibly vivid.

Whoosh!

A desolate horn call echoed. Two divine lights shot from the main platform, connecting to the contestants' preparation rooms, forming a rainbow divine bridge.

Two figures stepped onto the divine bridge, slowly making their way to the platform.

From the south came Tian Ling, petite in stature, her beautiful hair tied back, revealing a fair, delicate face. Her autumn-water-like eyes held a look of firm resolve. In her hand, she held a long sword that shimmered with light. This was not the sacred artifact, but merely a Three-Treasures level weapon, as each strike from a sacred artifact consumed an immense amount of energy.

From the north was the rogue cultivator connected to Daluo Academy, named Zhang San—a very common name. He had an ordinary appearance, dressed in a grey battle robe, and carried a bright silver long spear. His face showed a hint of excitement, for this was a stage he had never ascended before.

He stared fiercely at Tian Ling opposite him. Those important figures had told him that as long as he injured that woman, he would soar to great heights and become a person above others!

In Zhou Tian's room, everyone shed their smiles, watching the two figures in the center. The show was about to begin!

In the circularly arranged VIP rooms, many people displayed varied reactions.

"Is this the girl who caused Old Yi's third son to make such a big fuss?" Northern Frontier General Yu Gu muttered in his private VIP room, watching Tian Ling. He grabbed an exotic fruit nearby and stuffed it into his mouth by the handful, his bone armor creaking.

"Didn't see it coming. That boy Zhou Tian is quite the romantic, settling down for this girl just like that." In the Xiaoyao King's room, a beautiful lady sat on the sofa. Her skin was like congealed fat, her pretty face blossomed with charm, her figure was graceful with exquisite curves, and her eyes were like autumn water holding dew. Her mature aura was completely unmasked. This beautiful sight was only visible to the Xiaoyao King, who sat on a small stool beside her, looking like a little beast feeling wronged.

Hearing his wife's words, the Xiaoyao King mumbled softly, "Who isn't?"

"And you have the nerve to say that!" The lady's beautiful eyes widened, her brows furrowed in anger. "Look at what you've taught Zui'er! Liu Yan is such a good girl, yet he's still hesitant to make a move!"

"A doting mother spoils her child. Who's spoiling him, don't you know in your heart…" the Xiaoyao King grumbled.

"You…"

…

"Is it because of Zhou Tian? Tian Ling's fortune has also become blurred…" In the Imperial Advisor's room, a white-robed youth, possessing an ethereal and Daoist demeanor, floated in mid-air. A third eye had opened on his forehead, its iris golden, with profound runes flowing within it. If one looked closely, at its deepest core, faint, spiderweb-like cracks were spread across it.

The divine eye on his forehead slowly closed. The Imperial Advisor shut his eyes and murmured, "Zhou Tian, oh Zhou Tian, what heaven-defying fortuitous encounter have you actually obtained!" At this moment, he recalled the indescribably grand aura he had seen deep within Zhou Tian's soul a few days prior. In just an instant, his Exquisite Sky-Penetrating Divine Eye had almost been rendered useless. It was fortunate that Emperor Qin had ordered him to look, providing him with many divine medicines, which allowed him to slowly recover.

"Duke, I didn't expect you to be interested in the affairs between these youngsters…" In another VIP room, two men sat. One had white hair and a face full of wrinkles, yet his posture was ramrod straight, like a sky-piercing divine sword poised to stab directly into the firmament! He was precisely the Duke of Wei of the Heavenly Qin Empire!

Opposite him sat a black-haired middle-aged man in a green robe, with a perpetual smile on his face. He was the one who had just spoken, Prime Minister Liu of Heavenly Qin!

The Duke of Wei heard his words, his face showing no ripple of emotion. He said calmly, "This is not merely a matter between youngsters. If handled poorly, it could lead to a conflict between two major powers…"

"It's not that serious, not that serious. This is just a matter between the younger generation!" Prime Minister Liu's smile was as refreshing as a spring breeze, but his tone grew a shade heavier!

"Zhou Yi's boy's methods these past few days clearly aim for the other party's life. Prime Minister Liu wouldn't fail to see that, would he…" The Duke of Wei frowned slightly, looking at Prime Minister Liu. Zhou Tian's methods were incredibly clumsy; old foxes like them could tell at a glance. After all, the opposing party was a state-level power. Blind protection would only exact a greater price!

"Oh, Duke, don't underestimate these young ones. It doesn't matter if their methods are unsightly, as long as they work. Who knows what secrets these youngsters might be hiding? We old folks just need to be there to back them up…" Prime Minister Liu's smiling expression was a constant.

"Has Zhou Yi confided in you?" the Duke of Wei asked Prime Minister Liu.

"Heh heh…" Prime Minister Liu offered a mysterious smile, saying nothing.

Seeing his smile, the Duke of Wei gritted his teeth in irritation, wishing he could draw his sword and cleave this old fox. He closed his eyes, out of sight, out of mind!

The reactions of the other major state-level powers who had arrived varied. This was not their home base, after all, and it was the imperial capital of Heavenly Qin. They essentially had no intelligence networks they could deploy here. They could only vaguely guess, through a few scraps of hearsay, that Daluo Academy seemed to be clashing with Heavenly Qin, so they had all come here to merely observe the drama.

In Daluo Academy's VIP room, Scholar Li's face was so gloomy it could drip water. Suppressing the rage in his heart, he sternly roared at the few people standing before him, "Who gave you permission to act on your own initiative?! Don't you know where this place is? You're courting death!"
