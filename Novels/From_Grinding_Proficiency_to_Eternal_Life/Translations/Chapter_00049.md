# Chapter 49: A Compromise

He suddenly flipped open his lapel, revealing a bronze-colored waist and back. A vicious scar cut right through the muscles at his waist.

Xu Yunfan’s pupils constricted slightly. No wonder, when Old Man Lu initially swung his hammer, he hadn't used his waist and back for power, but instead used the method of driving force through his shoulder blades.

"Back then, half of the Divine Weapon Ridge collapsed... Which of the thirteen families of Qingzhou didn't go to the ruins to scavenge for food? This injury was obtained back then."

Lu Yi finished speaking, seeming to feel he had said too much. He coughed twice, took a drink of wine, and said slowly, "Otherwise, how could I have come to this North Ye City to retire... Forget it, let's not talk about this. It's just that you asked, and this old man got carried away and said too much."

Putting his clothes back on, Old Man Lu tapped the wine cup with his finger.

"As for bone forging techniques, looking at the entire Great Zhou, the White Tiger Metal Essence Bone Tempering Art of the Tiger Fiend Sect is at the top of the list. There is also the Dragon Tiger Sect's Twelve Golden Sinew Jade Bone Techniques, a peerless divine skill for tempering sinews and forging bones. The Buddhist Arhat Subduing Dragon Technique, when cultivated to its extreme, can turn the bones into gold and jade."

Xu Yunfan’s hand, which was pouring the wine, paused slightly.

The stream of wine hung in the air, forming an amber bridge that reflected the flickering light in Lu the Blacksmith's eyes.

He changed the subject. "Let's not talk about distant matters. Let's talk about the Qingzhou region..."

The old man let out a low, thunderous laugh from his throat, his flushed face carrying a hint of intoxication.

"Twenty years ago, the Qingzhou army suppressed a rebellion. Three hundred heavy-armored陌刀手 (Mo Dao Shou - a type of elite infantry) surrounded and killed a fully-fleshed Bone forging Master. That person used the Great Zhou Military's 'Breaking Army Seven Killing Fist.' He actually夹断 (jia duan - clamped and broke) dozens of fine steel Mo Dao with his back blades. You can imagine how formidable this bone forging technique is."

A strange smile appeared on his face. He slammed his wine cup heavily onto the table, causing the plate of braised beef to jump three inches high.

"The Great Zhou Military's 'Breaking Army Seven Killing Fist' is open to all, but to practice this technique, one must enlist in the military and spend three years in the Qingzhou Blood Miasma Bone Tempering Camp before one is qualified to be taught."

He suddenly reached out and grabbed Xu Yunfan's wrist bone. Xu Yunfan remained calm, but his muscles and sinews were as immobile as cast iron. The bulging muscles on his arm trembled slightly, actually shaking Lu Yi's iron-clamp-like fingers until he couldn't maintain his grip.

"Good lad! Full Skin Tempering, a first-rank Martial Apprentice!"

He clearly remembered that back at Divine Weapon Ridge, it took fellow disciples at least ten years of hammering by the furnace to forge such copper skin, and they also needed the special secret medicine of Divine Weapon Ridge to avoid damaging their foundation.

He had no idea how Xu Yunfan had managed to train.

Lu Yi was then surprised to discover that Xu Yunfan had actually cultivated the 'Red Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer Technique' to the Great Completion level, his skin as tough as ox hide, difficult to harm by sword or blade.

He felt a bit of relief in his heart.

"This hammer technique is considered quite difficult even within Divine Weapon Ridge. For you to achieve Skin Tempering Great Completion with it is truly not easy... If you have the chance, you can go to Divine Weapon Ridge again. There is a Quenching Pool at the back mountain. The sect's founding ancestor back then..."

Lu Yi's words cut off abruptly. His face was filled with a bleak expression, and he shook his head.

"Forget it. There is no conclusion to this matter, so let's not speak of it."

Yunfan noticed the bulging veins on the back of Lu Yi's neck, a physical sign of a warrior forcibly suppressing his emotions.

The old blacksmith finally didn't continue. Instead, he grabbed the wine jug and took three big gulps.

"The Wu Family Fortress has raised凶虎 (xiong hu - fierce tigers) for the Prince of Longxi for three generations. They cultivated a White Tiger beast, and from it, they discovered the White Tiger Golden Jade Art, which is particularly good at bone forging. Looking at the entire Great Zhou, it is quite excellent. The most impressive thing was three years ago, when the Wu Family Fortress held a martial arts tournament to select a son-in-law. Seventeen good men at the Bone forging Realm had their kneecaps shattered by the fortress lord's daughter using the White Tiger Golden Jade Art."

It's a pity that the Wu Family Fortress is extremely xenophobic. This bone forging technique cannot be learned by anyone other than direct descendants. What a pity, what a pity!"

Lu the Blacksmith fiddled with the wine in his cup with his chopsticks and spoke slowly.

"Besides that, the Iron River Gang on the Canglan River is the top contender. Their 'Stacking Waves Bone Forging Technique' involves standing in a rapid current with a three-hundred-pound iron anchor tied to you. The river water is icy cold, and blood qi actively seeps into the bones. If practiced correctly, the bones become as hard as iron."

"The Hundred Refinements Manor in the southern mines has the 'Cold Iron Quenching Technique.' They use living people as iron blanks to forge. Every ten days, one must soak in cold iron water for three hours. If you endure, you succeed; if not, you die."

"If we're talking about the most conspicuous, it should be the 'Humpback Dragon Strength' of the Dragon Gate Escort Agency within the city. It emphasizes that the spine is like a great dragon, connecting the four limbs and all bones. A master who has achieved Bone Forging Great Completion will have a spine three times thicker than an ordinary person. In the city, if you see someone with a neck thicker than their head, it's most likely someone from the Dragon Gate Escort Agency."

Lu Yi's series of speeches revealed his encyclopedic knowledge of the martial arts of the various Qingzhou sects.

He sighed and said, "It's a pity that these sects are extremely xenophobic. It will be somewhat difficult for you to join them and obtain a bone forging technique."

Xu Yunfan felt a bit helpless. Although he had made ample preparations in his heart, hearing Lu Yi say this still left him somewhat frustrated.

Seeing Xu Yunfan with his head down and silent, Lu Yi chuckled and changed the subject.

"Thirty miles west of the city, there is a Ghost Market. It opens at midnight on the fifteenth of every month. That handful of玄铁砂 (xuan tie sha - black iron sand) I had came from there. Last year, in the twelfth lunar month..."

He let out a hiccup. A sharp light flashed through his turbid eyes. That wasn't intoxication; his eyes were filled with envy.

"This old man personally saw someone trade a fragment of the 'Black Tortoise Carrying Mountain Art.' It caused a huge stir in the entire black market at the time. Dozens of top-notch experts, who knows where they came from, almost smashed the entire black market to pieces. It was only rebuilt a few months ago. You can go and take a look on the fifteenth."

As he spoke, he pulled an iron token from his chest and tossed it in front of Xu Yunfan.

"The entrance is a stone bridge. A lame old Taoist guards the bridge. Just show him this token. Remember to hide your identity. Inside the black market is fine, but once you leave, anything could happen."

Xu Yunfan picked it up and looked. The iron token was worn smooth and shiny. In the middle of the token was a character written on it.

'Fog'

"Thank you!"

It wasn't until the moon was high in the sky that Old Man Lu drank to his heart's content. Xu Yunfan helped Lu Yi back to the blacksmith shop.

Moonlight shone down, and the entire snow-covered North Ye City emitted a faint silver glow.

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan stopped his footsteps and looked sideways at the corner of a roof. There, a person was huddled in the corner, covered by a thick layer of snow, already motionless.

North Ye City is located in the northern border of the Great Zhou. The winters are extremely cold, and the snow is very thick. If one has no firewood and no place to warm up, they can only freeze to death like this.

Moreover, quite a few people freeze to death in the city. This is just the tip of the iceberg.

Now, the number of refugees in North Ye City seems to be gradually decreasing.

"These are all refugees from the neighboring Wuzhou. When the Empress ascended the throne this year, the Incense Fire Sect caused chaos in Wuzhou. The war in Wuzhou has been ongoing, and the state capital, Yonggu, is in danger. If not for the heavy snow sealing the mountains in winter, Wuzhou would have completely broken away from the Great Zhou's control. Now, the Xuanjia Army of Zhongzhou has been deployed. After spring next year, they will quell the rebellion and restore order."

A slightly cold voice came. Xu Yunfan looked toward the sound.

He saw a scholar-like figure, slightly thin, wearing a fur coat, looking at the scene before him with righteous indignation.

Xu Yunfan glanced at him, said nothing, and turned to leave.
