# Chapter 121: Mutual Gaze

Li Shiming had produced 164 chips named "Dragon Core Generation 1" — 32-bit cores running at 168MHz with 1Mx8 memory, 192Kx8 RAM, and low voltage. While not the most advanced chips, they were sufficient for applications that didn't require massive computational power. He planned to produce multiple batches to accumulate manufacturing experience while also establishing a legitimate source of spirit stone income.

With these chips, his design for an LED display to accompany identity jade tablets became feasible. The original identity tablets could provide holographic projections for video calls, but this feature required specific array formations and was only available to senior sect members. Through his studies of array formations with the computational power of IBM z15, Li Shiming had successfully digitized parts of formation knowledge, though this breakthrough was only useful to him—no other cultivator could process complex hexadecimal data without chips.

He created a smartphone-like casing for the identity jade tablet, allowing information to be displayed on a 16cm LED screen. Touching the screen could activate simple functions like video calling within a thousand li of the sect's grand formation. The device included a friend list interface and options to initiate visual communication. The chip was restricted to only connect with Tianhai Sect's formation and recognize their identity tablets.

Power consumption was minimal, using a small battery continuously charged by a spirit stone through a micro-current generating formation. One spirit stone could power the device for years. While functionally inferior to smartphones from his past life, its energy efficiency was vastly superior. Security was ensured through irreversible chip-tablet binding, with additional complex but functionally useless formations that required supercomputer-level computation to decipher.

Yun Ze arrived at Eagle Beak Island, curious about his first invitation inside after multiple supply deliveries. The spirit fields grew various common plants—all seeds he had supplied—that had transformed the island's landscape over months. Five main shoots of talisman bamboo thrived under an intermediate spirit farmer's care.

"Junior Brother Li, what major order brings me here today?" Yun Ze asked as they sat at a stone table outside the cave residence. Previous large orders had been arranged via identity tablets, so this formal invitation suggested something significant. He also wondered about Li Shiming's wealth—impressive for someone who had joined the sect just a year prior.

Li Shiming laughed wryly, "Brother Yun jokes—I've exhausted all my spirit stones!" This surprised Yun Ze, who considered whether Li Shiming sought a loan. "All my resources went into research that's finally borne fruit. I wanted your opinion on its value."

His invention, "Thousand-Li Mutual Gaze," was an add-on for identity tablets. When Yun Ze inserted his tablet into the device, the screen displayed Tianhai Sect's majestic Nine Peaks shrouded in clouds—an effect normally requiring expensive spirit crystals or elaborate illusion formations. The simple interface showed Yun Ze's public profile with an image, all powered by mundane materials from their previous transactions.

Under guidance, Yun Ze selected Li Shiming from his extensive friend list (unlike Li's sparse contacts) and initiated a call. Seeing Li Shiming's live image appear simultaneously on screen and in person amazed him. "Does this require both parties to have the device?" Yun Ze asked, already calculating marketing strategies.

"Absolutely—the functionality depends entirely on Mutual Gaze," Li Shiming confirmed. When Yun Ze questioned replicability, Li Shiming confidently asserted no one could duplicate it. The electronic components would appear as worthless mundane objects to cultivators without foundational knowledge. This technological gap also allowed hidden backdoors for potential surveillance.

They negotiated terms: initially proposing 50 spirit stones per unit, then settling on Yun Ze's offer of 60 for exclusive distribution rights. Recognizing the device's potential status symbol value (mimicking senior members' privileged communication), Li Shiming renegotiated for 30% of sales revenue while maintaining anonymity as the inventor.

The first batch of 100 units quickly sparked a sensation. Yun's Trading Company employed clever marketing—gifting devices to influential figures who then drove demand through social proof. Despite attempts to reverse-engineer (destroying several units), the technology remained irreplicable. When the next ten units sold instantly at 500 spirit stones each, with backorders piling up, the device's commercial success was assured—all while Li Shiming quietly continued his cultivation and research.
