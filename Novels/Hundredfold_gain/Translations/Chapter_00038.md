# Chapter 38: Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body and Talisman Treasure  

"A skeleton here?"  

Gazing at the remains within the tree hollow, Qi Chuan was utterly surprised.  

After all, beneath this Spirit Ginseng Tree resided a swarm of Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees. How could this skeleton's owner have possibly reached this place before death?  

"Most likely, they entered this tree hollow before the Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees appeared and then passed away here," Qi Chuan speculated.  

He then examined the skeleton before him.  

The remains had clearly been dead for many years, with no trace of flesh remaining—only bones. However, the bones were not the usual pale white but instead had a translucent, crystalline quality, as if carved from gemstone, making them exceptionally peculiar.  

"This must be the skeleton of a cultivator, and their cultivation level in life must have been extraordinary," Qi Chuan thought to himself.  

No ordinary person could have reached the Cloudrise Mountains. Although these mountains were relatively safer compared to some truly perilous regions, they still teemed with demonic beasts. Moreover, the unusual state of the bones suggested they belonged to no common mortal.  

As for why this cultivator had perished here—whether they had suffered fatal injuries, been pursued by enemies, or something else—Qi Chuan had no way of knowing.  

On the surface, the skeleton revealed no clues, only adding to the mystery. Qi Chuan couldn't even discern the person's identity.  

"Perhaps they were a cultivator from the Breeze Moon Sect, or maybe an outsider?"  

Qi Chuan leaned toward the latter. Given the skeleton's likely high cultivation level in life, if they had been a sect member, even with fatal injuries, they could have returned to the sect before succumbing.  

Only an outsider would have hidden in this tree hollow, possibly fearing pursuers.  

Of course, another possibility was that the skeleton's enemies had been from the Breeze Moon Sect.  

But regardless of the reason, it mattered little to Qi Chuan. Right now, he was far more interested in something else.  

His gaze fell upon the tattered gray robe draped over the skeleton. Though it had once been a magical garment, the passage of time had eroded its inscribed formations, rendering it useless.  

Yet beneath the robe, something seemed to be concealed.  

With a wave of his hand, Qi Chuan lifted the robe's edge, fully revealing the hidden objects.  

"This is..."  

His eyes widened in astonishment as he summoned the two items before him.  

One was a yellowed booklet inscribed with the ancient characters: "Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body."  

"Could this be...?"  

A thought flashed through Qi Chuan's mind, and hope flickered in his eyes. He immediately flipped through the booklet, skimming its contents.  

**[You have briefly perused the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body, attempting to comprehend its contents. Triggering a tenfold critical effect, you gain tenfold rewards. Your understanding of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body has slightly improved.]**  

As expected, words appeared before his eyes.  

"It really is a body-refining technique!"  

Qi Chuan smiled.  

Simultaneously, fragments of understanding about the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body surfaced in his mind, confirming its nature as a body-refining cultivation method.  

He had stumbled upon a body-refining manual.  

"Legends say that breaking through the Qi Refinement bottleneck to reach Foundation Establishment involves overcoming three major hurdles..." Qi Chuan mused.  

Though he had started as a mortal, his journey had brought him into the Breeze Moon Sect as an inner disciple. By now, he was well-versed in the basics of cultivation.  

"The first hurdle is achieving Qi Refinement perfection—the tenth layer. Only with sufficiently profound spiritual power can one attempt to break through to Foundation Establishment."  

"The second hurdle is the body, or rather, the vitality barrier. The deeper one's vitality, the easier it is to break through to Foundation Establishment."  

"Cultivators naturally develop stronger physiques over time as their spiritual power nourishes their bodies, eventually reaching levels comparable to mortal martial artists or elite fighters. However, this alone is insufficient for breaking through to Foundation Establishment."  

"Moreover, once a cultivator surpasses sixty years of age, their body weakens, vitality declines, and their chances of Foundation Establishment plummet."  

"Thus, the body is crucial for reaching Foundation Establishment. It's said that some exceptionally talented cultivators, confident in reaching the tenth layer of Qi Refinement before sixty, begin cultivating body-refining techniques as early as the mid-stages of Qi Refinement to enhance their physique and vitality, thereby increasing their chances of success..."  

"With my hundredfold critical effect, reaching the tenth layer before sixty will be effortless, leaving me ample time. Now that I've obtained this body-refining technique, why not start cultivating both body and spirit simultaneously?"  

"Doing so should boost my chances of Foundation Establishment!"  

Excitement surged within Qi Chuan as he gazed at the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body manual in his hands.  

With his hundredfold critical effect, he wasn't picky about techniques. Any body-refining method, practiced diligently, would yield results.  

Moreover, based on his initial understanding, the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body was a rather exceptional technique.  

It comprised six layers: the first three corresponding to Qi Refinement and the latter three to Foundation Establishment.  

Mastering the third layer would grant a physique strong enough to rival late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators—even those at the tenth layer.  

And if one reached the sixth layer, their body could withstand attacks from all but Core Formation experts.  

Unfortunately, the technique ended at the sixth layer.  

Still, for Qi Chuan at his current stage, the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body was more than sufficient, as it could carry him through late Foundation Establishment—a realm still far beyond his reach.  

"I'll take it and start cultivating once I return."  

Smiling, Qi Chuan stored the manual and turned his attention to the second item.  

"Is this... a magical artifact? Or a talisman?"  

After a moment of scrutiny, however, confusion flickered in his eyes.  

Though he hadn't seen an overwhelming number of talismans and magical artifacts, Qi Chuan was confident in his ability to distinguish between them.  

Yet this item left him puzzled.  

While it resembled a talisman in shape, its dimensions were several times larger than standard talismans. Moreover, instead of inscribed runes, it bore an intricate depiction of a massive black ruler, so lifelike it seemed the actual weapon lay before him.  

"Just what is this... Wait, could this be the legendary Talisman Treasure?"  

A sudden realization struck Qi Chuan, and his expression shifted to one of astonishment.  

In the cultivation world, above magical artifacts were spirit tools—weapons typically wielded only by Foundation Establishment experts.  

Beyond spirit tools lay magic treasures, exclusive to Core Formation cultivators and above.  

Yet one category transcended these classifications: the Talisman Treasure.  

Neither spirit tool nor magic treasure, it nonetheless possessed a fraction of a magic treasure's power.  

A Talisman Treasure was created when a Core Formation cultivator sealed a portion of their magic treasure's power into a special talisman. However, this process destroyed the original treasure, so only those nearing the end of their lifespan would craft one, intending to protect their descendants or disciples.  

Even under the best circumstances, a Talisman Treasure could only retain up to thirty percent of the original magic treasure's power. Moreover, it had limited uses—once its spiritual energy was exhausted, it would crumble to ash.  

Recalling this, Qi Chuan's eyes gleamed as he studied the massive talisman before him, emblazoned with the black ruler.  

"This must undoubtedly be a Talisman Treasure!"  

No other explanation fit.  

Though he longed to test its power, this was neither the time nor the place.  

"I'll verify its capabilities another time," Qi Chuan decided.  

With great satisfaction, he stored the Talisman Treasure and conducted a final sweep of the tree hollow. Finding nothing else of value, he prepared to leave.  

As for the skeleton, though its owner had clearly been a formidable cultivator who had practiced body-refining techniques, the remains held no further use for Qi Chuan.  

Glancing toward the valley entrance, he noted that the Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees still hadn't returned. Still, it was best not to linger.  

Without delay, Qi Chuan leaped down from the Spirit Ginseng Tree, levitated into the air, and flew toward the valley's exit. He ignored the spirit herbs scattered throughout the valley, his heart full with the treasures he had gained, and set off to reunite with Qi Chan'er.
