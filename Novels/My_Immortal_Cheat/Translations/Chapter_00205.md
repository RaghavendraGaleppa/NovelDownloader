**Chapter 205: Wutian's Remnant Soul!**

The Blood River practically turned into a vortex, endless essence surging towards the shed body. The aura emanating from the shed body grew increasingly profound, blood light swirling in its eyes as the heavens and earth roared and cracked.

Puzhi broke free from the obstruction of the blood-colored storm, his body transforming into a streak of light. Dao patterns swirled around him, his fist like a colossal dragon, golden light flashing in his eyes, his hair sparkling.

The shed body, which was absorbing the essence of the Blood River, its eyes flashing with blood-red light, suddenly looked up and gripped Puzhi’s fist. A hoarse voice emerged: "Disciple, are you going to attack your master?"

A blood-colored leg lifted, runes swirling around it, and violently struck Puzhi. Space directly shattered, unable to withstand such terrifying power. It could actually speak; with the replenishment of vital energy, it had regained its consciousness. The vital energy provided by the Blood River had allowed it to return to the Heavenly Venerate realm.

*Boom!*

Puzhi flew backward, the blood-colored mark on his abdomen rapidly disappearing. His eyes, chilling and sharp, fixed coldly on the shed body. It stood motionless in the void, exuding an earth-shattering vital energy that dyed even the mountains and rivers a deep crimson! Though it didn't move, like an ancient fossil, it was incredibly intimidating. Mountains and rivers cracked, the starry sky trembled, and the atmosphere was tense and oppressive.

"It's merely a husk shed by Master, it doesn't have the right to speak like that," Puzhi declared.

His fingers and palm formed a sword, cleaving down from the heavens! The heavens and earth were vast and boundless, yet at this moment, nothing surpassed the magnificence of that sword light. The sword qi was grand and immense, overwhelming the world, reaching everywhere!

*Rumble!*

The heavens and earth seemed to disconnect as a single sword qi slashed down!

"Disciple, is this how you speak to your master?!"

The shed body's blood-red light shot skyward, scarlet and demonic. With a *boom*, it soared forth. As its human skin swelled, its gray hair fanned out, making it resemble a sovereign ruling over heaven and earth. As it moved its hands, its entire body was covered in symbols of order and fragments of the Grand Dao. These patterns transformed into supreme armor, covering its form.

"Kill!"

At this moment, both sides unleashed their formidable attacks, commencing a decisive battle.

In another direction, another streak of blood-red light surged skyward; it was another shed body that had absorbed the essence of the Blood River, also returning to the Heavenly Venerate realm.

"Saint Devil, bring out that lotus seed!" Puzhi bellowed, his right hand manifesting life and his left hand death, an endless cycle of life and death, temporarily repelling the shed body he was fighting.

Saint Devil narrowed his eyes slightly, seemingly deep in thought. A moment later, a crack appeared between his brows, and a crystalline golden bead floated out—it was precisely that lotus seed.

"Epoch Resuscitation!" Puzhi roared, forming a hand seal. A massive, profound symbol imprinted itself on the forehead of the giant Buddha.

*Rumble!*

The giant Buddha phantom, which had been seated on the ground, slowly shrunk, transforming into a speck of light that merged into the golden lotus seed. Then, the golden lotus seed transformed into a gate of light, and a phantom figure stepped out. It was a middle-aged man with black hair and black robes, emanating an aura so terrifying that it caused the heavens and earth to collapse and the void to shatter completely. His eyes were initially bewildered, but instantly became sharp and clear. He was still muttering to himself: "Has it come to this? It's all my fault..."

Wutian's remnant soul! Zhou Tian was startled; he was standing beside Saint Devil and involuntarily took two steps back. He hadn't expected Wutian to have a trace of his remnant soul remaining in the world. Huang Qi also unconsciously retreated two steps. He was from Border Purgatory; if this mighty figure found him displeasing and struck him with a palm, he would be finished.

"Master!" Puzhi's gaze also shifted, his mind stirred, his eyes even growing a little red.

*Bang!*

In his momentary distraction, Puzhi was caught off guard and spat out two mouthfuls of fresh blood.

Upon seeing this, Wutian's eyes instantly turned extremely cold. He looked towards Saint Devil and said, "Junior, lend me your body for a while, and I shall bestow upon you a great fortune!"

Before Saint Devil could react, Wutian stepped into his body.

Saint Devil's pupils deepened, and his aura became vast and ancient. Then he took a step, moving towards the shed body. His figure was incomparably overbearing. As he arrived, clouds in all directions exploded, the sky cracked, and the starry sky dimmed, all intimidated by his presence!

"Mere remnant remains, daring to cause trouble!" he declared.

He unleashed heavy punches one after another, each seemingly piercing eternity, sending vast mists of blood erupting from the shed body standing amidst the raging blood flames. Finally, he advanced with overwhelming dominance, as if treading on the river of time, moving at extreme speed. With thudding sounds, he threw nine consecutive punches, piercing through the shed body, causing blood to splatter everywhere. The entire world wailed and trembled slightly, as if suppressed by him.

With a low roar, the figure in the sky soared across, not retreating, but emitting a dazzling beam of blood light within the chaotic mist.

"The trouble I left behind, I shall deal with it today!" Saint Devil roared, his hair disheveled, like a heaven-cleaving blade drawn from its sheath. He was now exceptionally sharp, his aura like steel needles, capable of inflicting pain on flesh and soul even across billions of miles of space.

"You've been dead for countless years, and your remnant soul dares to jump out?! You are destined to be scattered!" the shed body roared, its blood light surging, seemingly to alleviate its inner fear and bolster its confidence.

*Bang!*

Both figures flew backward, the Grand Dao streaking across the abandoned lands beyond the heavens. The deafening roars sounded as if countless demon lords were chanting scriptures, and billions of Buddhas were singing Zen chants, chilling all beings and making them instinctively want to prostrate.

With just one palm, Saint Devil blocked the shed body, forcing it to unleash its vital energy to shatter the silent void and confront him with all its might. Saint Devil's palm strike was terrifying. The patterns of his palm were visible; within each pattern was a boundless landscape of mountains and valleys! Furthermore, Saint Devil's palm lines contained the Dao patterns that once exclusively belonged to Wutian. He was using Saint Devil's body, and since Saint Devil's body had not yet reached the Heavenly Venerate realm, Wutian could only imbue it with his own Dao principles. Within each pattern, there were scenes of thundering heavenly mountains, surging yin energy, or eternal light, like divine realms. A single pattern was an entirely new world of mountains and rivers, encircled by stars, terrifyingly boundless. Precisely because of this, with a flick of his hand, he shattered all the rules and Dao trajectories of this place; only his Dao was eternal.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

The shed body threw punches, continuously colliding with Saint Devil's palm. The most dazzling light erupted between the two, truly astounding heaven and earth. At this moment, the energy unleashed by Saint Devil was too terrifying. Each strike pierced through the starry sky. If not for the opponent being that shed body, it would have absolutely shattered all things; nothing could have withstood it! His speed was too fast and too dense. Later, it was as if one galaxy after another poured down, the light from his fists boundless and overwhelming everything.

Yaksha wielded blades, Rakshasa roared, and demonic qi permeated around Saint Devil, making him appear incredibly evil, like a demonic king. With a slight movement, the starry sky collapsed, the void dimmed, and all the stellar brilliance extinguished!
