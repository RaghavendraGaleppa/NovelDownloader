Chapter 3: Bitter Cultivation in the Illusory Realm

The majestic Zhi Ying Pavilion stood tall, with its cultivation hall spanning thousands of square meters, serving as the training ground for disciples in the Ling Dong period. At this moment, the spacious hall was dotted with dozens of figures.

The time was still early, and the Jian Ji period cultivator responsible for imparting techniques had yet to arrive. The disciples gathered in small groups, discussing topics of interest.

Lin Xuan quietly made his way to a less crowded corner, sat down cross-legged, and began to cultivate once more. Just as he started, the sound of footsteps caught his attention.

"Ah, isn't that Lin Shi Di?" a voice said with a hint of ridicule. "I heard you went into seclusion to cultivate, but you still haven't broken through to the second layer?"

The mocking tone and sneers from the other disciples made Lin Xuan's brow furrow slightly, but he remained expressionless on the surface. To ordinary people, cultivators were like immortals, detached from worldly concerns, but in reality, the cultivation world was even more ruthless, realistic, and utilitarian than the mundane world.

In this world, strength was the foundation of power. The higher one's realm, the better one's magical tools, and the more precious one's elixirs, the more authority one held. Words spoken by such individuals were considered truth.

Despite three years of diligent cultivation, Lin Xuan's lack of spiritual roots had left him far behind his fellow disciples, earning him cold glances and disdain.

"Humph, a mere mortal without spiritual roots, no matter how hard he tries, will never be able to compare to us. Instead of staying in the sect and embarrassing himself, he should just leave," one of the disciples sneered.

"Yes, three years and still stuck at the second layer of the Ling Dong period. He's simply useless," another chimed in.

Lin Xuan didn't even blink at the jabs from his fellow disciples. He cast a cold glance at them before turning away. He wasn't angry; he simply didn't deem those shallow individuals worth his attention. His state of mind wouldn't be swayed by a few careless words.

After sitting down cross-legged, Lin Xuan began to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy. About half an hour passed before the sound of a bell echoed through the hall. The disciples, who had been chatting idly, immediately fell silent and formed a line. Lin Xuan took his place at the back of the queue.

A middle-aged man, appearing to be in his forties but likely much older due to the extended lifespan granted by cultivation, walked into the hall. The disciples bowed in unison, addressing him as "Shi Zun" in accordance with the rules of the Piao Yun Valley.

"I am Zhang Yu, and I will be teaching you the secrets of the Spiritual Energy Shield," he announced.

The Spiritual Energy Shield, as its name suggested, was a protective magical technique that involved deploying spiritual energy around the body to form a protective barrier. It was a fundamental defensive technique for cultivators.

The disciples' eyes lit up, and they began to whisper to one another. Lin Xuan, however, was the only one without spiritual roots, and his cultivation lagged behind the others.

"Silence!" Zhang Yu's face darkened as he scolded the chattering disciples.

The disciples immediately fell quiet, and Zhang Yu began to explain the intricacies of cultivating the Spiritual Energy Shield. Lin Xuan listened intently, although his current cultivation level wasn't sufficient to wield the technique. He made a mental note of the method, planning to practice it when his abilities improved.

After Zhang Yu finished his explanation and left, the disciples were left to practice on their own. Lin Xuan departed the Zhi Ying Pavilion and returned to his simple wooden dwelling. High-ranking cultivators had their own caverns, but the accommodations for lower-ranking disciples like Lin Xuan were modest.

Inside his dwelling, Lin Xuan retrieved paper and pen from the drawer and recorded the method for cultivating the Spiritual Energy Shield. This was a habit he had developed over the three years, as he couldn't rely on his memory alone. Many techniques he learned couldn't be practiced yet, but by writing them down, he wouldn't forget.

After completing his notes, Lin Xuan carefully stored the book and headed to the Lian Xin Path on the back mountain. He continued down the path to the spot where he had been cultivating for the past two days.

The spiritual energy here was becoming increasingly abundant. Lin Xuan stopped, knowing he couldn't proceed further. The deeper he went into the Lian Xin Path, the more terrifying the illusions became.

Suddenly, the scene around him changed, and he found himself in a vast, snowy expanse. The biting wind howled, and snowflakes buried his ankles. Lin Xuan felt as if he had been frozen stiff. The illusions were changing; last time, he had endured the agony of being consumed by flames, and now he was beset by the bitter cold.

Without a change in expression, Lin Xuan sat down cross-legged on the snowy ground, beginning to absorb the surrounding spiritual energy. As the cold intensified, his hair turned into icicles, but he remained motionless, persisting for over twenty minutes before exiting the illusion to rest.

After recovering somewhat, Lin Xuan resumed his cultivation. Two days passed, and Lin Xuan stood up, his expression unchanging. He hesitated for a moment before deciding to venture deeper into the Lian Xin Path. The spiritual energy here wasn't pure enough; he needed to proceed further to find the more refined energy required to break through his bottleneck. With determination, he stepped into the even more terrifying illusions that lay ahead.
