# Chapter 217: Eighth-Rank Divine Weapon, Ninth Under Heaven

“Ginseng fibrous roots, just that their medicinal effect is slightly stronger.”

Zhan Yan’s eye twitched slightly, his five fingers gripping the rock crevice to steady his figure.

Amidst the flickering phosphorescent fire on the stone wall, the veins on his neck bulged and throbbed. “What you fed me just now wasn’t an ordinary ginseng root, was it?”

It wasn't just strong; it was simply inhuman. In the past, people used ginseng to sustain a dying breath. Whether one could take a few more breaths after consuming a whole root was still up for debate.

Zhan Yan felt a metallic taste rising in his throat. He recalled how an elder at the Divine Weapon Ridge used old ginseng to prolong his life. Even swallowing a whole century-old ginseng root, managing three extra breaths was considered a blessing.

For a martial artist's physique, ordinary ginseng simply couldn't be absorbed in large quantities.

Yet now, the scorching current surging through his flesh and blood felt like the true fire condensed from ten mountains of ginseng. It was rapidly healing his physical injuries, and even the long-standing shackles of his martial dao seemed to be loosening.

Xu Yunfan had only taken out a single ginseng root to save his life.

Moreover...

Zhan Yan glanced at the black steel mechanism box behind Xu Yunfan’s waist, his expression somewhat dazed.

However, he didn't ask further. Everyone has their own fortuitous encounters. Seeing his disciple have such an opportunity, he was naturally happy in his heart.

Before Xu Yunfan could say anything else, Zhan Yan said, “Let's go to the left tunnel first... inside there lies the true foundation of the Divine Weapon Ridge.”

In the time it took to speak a few words, Zhan Yan was already able to stand steadily and move freely.

The two no longer hesitated. As they moved forward, Xu Yunfan told Zhan Yan about the arrival of a master-level expert at the Cleansing Marrow Realm.

Zhan Yan’s expression tightened slightly, and after a long while, he let out a breath.

“We must not delay; we need to speed up.”

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan no longer mentioned the matter.

If the newcomer was an enemy, then Lu Cheng and the others were likely in grave danger.

The further they went in, the stronger the smell of sulfur seeping from the rock crevices became. Xu Yunfan’s boot soles crushed a few赤晶石 (red crystal stones), and the debris actually scorched marks on the blue stone.

When they turned the seventh serpentine bend, the heat wave turned into a tangible force hitting their faces. The surface of the black iron mechanism box instantly condensed fine frost patterns.

“Earth’s Lung Golden Qi. Be careful. If inhaled by someone below the Organ Refining Realm, it will burn the internal organs.”

Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan held his breath, allowing his pure yang internal energy to flow slowly through his flesh and blood to prolong his breath-holding time.

If one had stepped into the Organ Refining Realm, the five organs and six viscera would be strengthened, allowing one to hold their breath for three days and nights without changing color.

Currently, he could hold it for at most an hour.

The tattered clothes on Zhan Yan were fluttered by this heat wave.

He didn't hesitate at all. His eyes shone with a crystal light, carrying a hint of nostalgia.

“Fortunately, this place wasn't collapsed.”

This location was nearly two thousand zhang underground. Without the map recorded on the silk cloth given by Lu Cheng, the underground caves were interconnected and winding. It would have been extremely difficult to find this place in a short time.

Looking at the deep tunnel ahead, Zhan Yan stepped forward and brushed the dust off the stone wall, revealing a Taotie relief sculpture.

His vigorous and powerful hand pressed onto the eye of the Taotie relief on the rock wall.

The bronze beast's pupil sank three inches with a rumble. The sound of gears meshing came from deep within the rock strata.

Xu Yunfan felt the stone steps beneath his feet suddenly collapse. The ground opened and closed, revealing a huge, deep hole.

His whole body tensed. Just as he was about to swing the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in reverse to unleash the chain hammer, Zhan Yan spoke: “Just fall down. Below is the true Divine Weapon Ridge forging ground.”

Xu Yunfan relaxed his body slightly, staring at the thick fog below where the light of fire was透射 (penetrating).

He and Zhan Yan fell into the surging red mist.

Countless black iron chains loomed faintly in the mist. Each iron ring interlocked like the veins of a dragon, swaying slowly from time to time. When the scorching wind swept past, it actually emitted the sound of clanging weapons and charging horses.

They fell for nearly a thousand meters. To slow their descent, Xu Yunfan tapped the chains with his toes several times.

As the chains swayed, it seemed to evoke a dragon's roar echoing, deep and long, making one's heart pound.

The moment his toes touched the ground, Xu Yunfan’s pupils constricted abruptly.

The stalactites hanging from the hundred-zhang high ceiling had all turned into red gold. The earthfire veins coiled in the center of the cave like a dragon.

Seventy-two bronze furnace cauldrons stood in a circle around them. Dark red magma could be seen flowing between the coiled dragon patterns on the cauldron bodies.

What was most terrifying were the nine meteorite iron chains hanging from the cave top. Each chain's end was tied to half of a charred corpse, the fingers of those skeletons still clutching forging hammers.

“The blood sacrifice method is the easiest way to forge a divine weapon, but it also makes the divine weapon's characteristics unstable,” Zhan Yan’s voice came through the heat waves. “The first generation of forging masters at the Divine Weapon Ridge voluntarily melted their flesh and blood into the earthfire array, eventually forging a divine weapon armor.”

Their arrival seemed to cause a slight disturbance in the earthfire. Not far away, from the deep earthfire magma, an iron chain shot out like a dragon emerging from water, bringing a thirty-zhang wave of fire that splashed towards the ceiling.

As the red iron water fell like a rainstorm, Zhan Yan’s palms moved like a crane's wings. Using the technique of the Black Steel Hundred-Forged Body to disperse and卸力 (dissipate force), he brought the falling fire into his control.

“Watch closely!”

Zhan Yan roared, his vigorous arm muscles bulging as he pulled the chain on the high platform in front of him.

*Boom!*

A tiger's roar and thunder sound burst from Zhan Yan’s throat. His bronze-colored muscles rose like coiled dragons, and his strong knuckles gripped the heavy chain as thick as a bowl's mouth.

Then, the mechanism at the end of the chain exploded with a bang. The nine red serpent-patterned rings were pulled taut like a string.

*Zing!*

The friction between the black iron chain and the mechanism sparked blindingly. In an instant, the earth shook and mountains swayed.

Not far away, the red magma churned like boiling water. The obsidian platform at the bottom, engraved with ancient inscriptions, rose inch by inch in the heat waves. In a moment, a nine-chi high black steel platform broke through the flames and emerged.

Dark gold armor, tightly bound by countless chains, hung in mid-air. Every scale was swallowing and spitting the essence of earthfire.

*Clink!*

The sound of metal rang out layer by layer. Several chains on the armor suddenly broke, causing Zhan Yan’s expression to tighten slightly.

After seeing no further abnormalities, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.

The dark gold scale armor shrank abruptly amidst the sound of the chains snapping. One thousand, seven hundred, and twenty inverted scales stood up like the barbs of a poisonous bee's stinger. The edges of each dragon scale were edged with magma patterns. Drawn by the qi mechanism, they could adjust their angles on their own. The six silver-white scales on the chest protector flickered, clearly opening and closing with the rhythm of the magma churning three zhang away.

“Among the weapons of the world, those that possess a spirit enter the ranks of seventh-rank divine weapons. As for eighth-rank divine weapons, there are only eight under heaven. And this Dragon Scale Armor is the eighth-rank divine weapon forged by our Divine Weapon Ridge itself, ranking ninth among the eight divine weapons under heaven!”

“Two thousand years ago, the founder of the Divine Weapon Ridge, Ou Yezi, subdued a red python. He used the hardest scales on its body to forge this. To temper it into a divine weapon, he poured out his heart and blood. Even many forging masters sacrificed their lives and blood to complete it. Back then... it almost caused the Divine Weapon Ridge to be destroyed. It took a full twenty years to recover.”

Zhan Yan stared at the divine weapon armor on the high platform, his eyes unblinking, his expression carrying a hint of melancholy.

“Two thousand years of spring and autumn cycles have passed. This dragon blood armor that swallowed the lives of nine hundred swordsmiths is still waiting for a new master who can suppress the red python's soul.”
