# Chapter 57: Yun Qingyue and the Divine Origin Hall

Standing at the entrance of his cave abode, Qi Chuan activated his Clear Sight technique once more, carefully observing Wind Spirit Mountain and Moon Shadow Mountain in the distance. Yet again, he found nothing of note.

"I wonder if I'll be able to see through this third-grade sect-protecting grand formation over Windmoon Lake once my Clear Sight reaches perfection?" Qi Chuan mused to himself.

With that thought, he withdrew his gaze and deactivated the technique.

[You channeled and maintained your spiritual energy in your eyes to sustain Clear Sight for a period, triggering a 31x critical effect. You gained 31x the usual progress. Your Clear Sight has improved slightly.]

A line of text appeared before his eyes. Qi Chuan felt a fleeting cool sensation pass through his eyeballs as new insights about the Clear Sight technique emerged in his mind.

"My Clear Sight has improved again!" Qi Chuan smiled faintly.

Having already mastered the basics of Clear Sight, his next goal was to reach the minor achievement stage. As an ocular technique, Clear Sight was notoriously difficult to cultivate—the minor achievement stage would undoubtedly be more challenging than the initial mastery.

But for Qi Chuan, all he needed to do was use Clear Sight regularly to continue improving. However, this method would only take him from the beginner stage to its limit. To truly break through to the minor achievement stage, he would need the medicinal aids described in the technique's manual.

That was a problem for the future, though. Once he acquired the necessary ingredients, advancing shouldn't be too difficult.

"Still, I've nearly exhausted my spirit stones now—only a few remain. It's time to start earning more," Qi Chuan thought. "Otherwise, both my second-stage Minor Profound Crystal Body cultivation and the Spirit Gathering Pills for refining my spiritual energy will be affected."

Now that he had become a mid-grade first-rank talisman master and mastered the basics of Clear Sight, Qi Chuan felt it was time to return to his regular cultivation routine—the dual cultivation of spiritual energy and physical body.

Both paths required spirit stones. His original stock of over three hundred low-grade spirit stones had been depleted during his talisman studies, with most spent on the high-grade spirit brush, the Mystic Elephant Brush. While expensive, the brush was a long-term investment that would serve him well.

For now, talisman crafting was his best option for earning spirit stones.

"Although I haven't reached high-grade first-rank talisman mastery yet, even as a mid-grade master, producing a large batch of mid-grade talismans could earn me a decent amount," Qi Chuan considered. "Moreover, since I've achieved major mastery in the basic elemental spells, the quality of my mid-grade Fireball and Water Arrow talismans will be exceptional among their rank, giving me an edge in sales."

Originally, he had planned to start earning through talismans only after reaching high-grade mastery. But with his funds nearly depleted, he had no choice but to begin earlier.

"First, I'll return to my cave and produce a batch of mid-grade talismans to sell," he decided.

With one last glance at Wind Spirit Mountain and Moon Shadow Mountain shrouded in mist at the center of Windmoon Lake, Qi Chuan turned and retreated into his high-grade first-rank cave abode.

Meanwhile, at the foot of Moon Shadow Mountain stood the Divine Origin Hall.

Moon Shadow Mountain was originally the secluded cultivation site of the Windmoon Sect's Elder, the True Person of Mystic Sword. The hall at its base had only been constructed in recent years.

Outside the Divine Origin Hall, an elderly man with a wizened face led a coldly elegant woman in white robes toward the grand entrance.

"We're here. You've visited this hall before, so enter and begin your comprehension," the elder said, stopping at the doors.

"Many thanks, Sect Master!" The woman in white bowed respectfully before lifting her gaze to the imposing hall, which exuded an aura of profound mystery.

"This time is different," Yun Qingyue, the woman in white, thought resolutely. "My ocular technique has reached major mastery, and my cultivation is at the peak of Qi Refinement. I will surely succeed in comprehending the treasure within!"

As the foremost of the Windmoon Sect's twelve core disciples, Yun Qingyue's reputation for both beauty and strength was renowned among her peers and even the sect's elders. In a past secret realm competition, she had severely injured Lin Sha, the top core disciple of the rival Heavenly Soul Hall, despite both being at the tenth level of Qi Refinement.

This wasn't her first visit to the Divine Origin Hall since its opening to core disciples. Though as the top disciple, a Foundation Establishment Pill was already within her grasp—no other core disciple could compete with her—the treasure within this hall was different.

The sect's Elder had personally decreed that anyone who comprehended the hall's treasure would be rewarded with a supreme-grade Foundation Establishment Pill. While Yun Qingyue wasn't desperate for such a pill—she was confident she could establish her foundation even with a high-grade one—the Elder's personal interest suggested the treasure's significance. Successfully comprehending it would undoubtedly bring immense benefits to her future cultivation.

Thus, after achieving major mastery in her ocular technique, Yun Qingyue had immediately requested permission from the sect master for another attempt.

With confident steps, she entered the Divine Origin Hall under the sect master's watchful gaze.

Boom! The heavy doors slammed shut behind her, sealing the interior from view.

Outside, the sect master tucked his hands into his sleeves, his expression calm as he waited. He had brought all core disciples here before—some multiple times, like Yun Qingyue. Yet none had succeeded in comprehending the treasure. Even most Foundation Establishment elders, himself included, had failed.

He knew Yun Qingyue had already visited once with minor mastery in her ocular technique. This time, she had only progressed to major mastery—not perfection. The improvement didn't seem significant enough to expect success.

"Still, Yun Qingyue has been consolidating her peak Qi Refinement cultivation. If she fails this time, she'll likely attempt Foundation Establishment soon," the sect master mused. "And once she succeeds, another core disciple position will open up... We'll have to hold another selection ceremony. It's been years since the last grand event."

A hint of nostalgia colored the sect master's quiet words as he gazed at the sealed hall.
