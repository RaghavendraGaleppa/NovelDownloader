# Chapter 12: Declining the Offer  

"Sit." Zuo Le pointed to a wooden stool beside him.  

"Thank you, Master." Qin Ziling bowed slightly before sitting down calmly, his demeanor respectful yet composed, neither subservient nor arrogant.  

*I never expected this young man to possess such talent in combat. What a pity—after nearly three years of training, he still hasn’t touched the threshold of the skin-membrane layer. Without reaching the power realm, no matter how skilled he is in combat, he’ll remain nothing more than a martial apprentice. Otherwise, I wouldn’t hesitate to support him financially.* Zuo Le observed Qin Ziling with a gaze that mingled appreciation and regret.  

"You’ve been at the martial hall for nearly three years, haven’t you?" Zuo Le asked.  

"Two months short of three years, Master," Qin Ziling replied.  

"Training for so long must have placed a heavy burden on your family. They must be eager for you to start earning a living, no?"  

"Yes," Qin Ziling admitted.  

"Have you heard of the Xingchang Escort Agency? One of the four major escort agencies in our prefecture. The chief escort, Song Haichuan, is a close friend of mine. I can recommend you for a position as an escort there."  

Qin Ziling’s expression flickered with surprise.  

Martial apprentices like him, who had only trained their muscles and tendons, typically started as lowly escorts—only those who had reached the skin-membrane layer could directly become full-fledged escorts.  

Moreover, Zuo Le was known for his stern demeanor, especially toward impoverished apprentices like Qin Ziling, who showed little promise of advancing. Apart from basic instruction upon entry, he usually left their training to his senior disciples who had reached the skin-membrane layer.  

The former Qin Ziling had feared Zuo Le, harboring no fondness or respect for him, viewing him as a cold, money-driven instructor.  

Yet now, this very man was showing concern for his future—even offering to leverage his connections to secure him a coveted position.  

"An escort must not only possess the strength to protect goods but also the social finesse to navigate relationships. Your combat skills already match those of a skin-membrane practitioner, and you’re literate and quick-witted. With some guidance, you’d adapt quickly. Unlike Liu Xiaoqiang—though he’s naturally strong and comparable to a hide-level practitioner, his lack of education and blunt temperament suit him better as a guard or a frontline enforcer for a gang, not an escort."  

"Of course, while the pay is decent, these are troubled times. The profession carries great risk. Think it over. If you’re interested, my word alone will secure you the position." Seeing Qin Ziling’s surprise, Zuo Le smiled faintly before continuing.

Had it been the former Qin Ziling, he would have accepted without hesitation.  

With his skills, even five years as a lowly escort wouldn’t have earned him such a promotion. And despite the dangers, the income was substantial—a few successful runs could support his family for a year.  

But the current Qin Ziling was different.  

Though he still lacked funds for nourishing meats and herbs, he now possessed hidden means to acquire them—means that couldn’t be revealed openly. His only visible path was martial arts.  

Thus, his priority wasn’t earning money but advancing his skills, breaking through to the skin-membrane layer and beyond.  

Staying at the martial hall was his best option.  

"Thank you for your kindness, Master. But I don’t wish to abandon martial arts—I want to continue training." Qin Ziling rose and clasped his hands in salute.  

Zuo Le’s eyes flickered with surprise, then a hint of mockery at the young man’s overestimation of himself.  

"Very well. You may go." With a dismissive wave, Zuo Le turned his attention back to his tea.  

The world was harsh and pragmatic. He had done his part—if Qin Ziling refused, he wouldn’t waste further words.  

---  

"Ziling! I haven’t sparred with you in a while, but you’ve improved! You actually held your own against Nan Gongyue!" Liu Xiaoqiang greeted Qin Ziling with a hearty punch to the chest, while the other muscle-training apprentices subtly avoided him.  

Everyone knew Nan Gongyue had been humiliated and would bear a grudge. Unlike Liu Xiaoqiang, they still had to train here and didn’t want to draw his ire.  

As for the skin-membrane practitioners, even if some disapproved of Nan Gongyue’s behavior, they were all Zuo Le’s disciples. There was a sense of shared honor—none would openly praise Qin Ziling. And with Zuo Le having just intervened and spoken to Qin Ziling privately, none were foolish enough to provoke further conflict.  

"I just dodged well," Qin Ziling replied modestly, not mentioning that had Zuo Le not stopped the fight, his palm strike would have incapacitated Nan Gongyue.  

"That’s still impressive!" Liu Xiaoqiang clapped his shoulder before lowering his voice. "What did the master say to you?"  

"He offered to recommend me as an escort at Xingchang Escort Agency, but I chose to keep training."  

Liu Xiaoqiang’s eyes widened as if he’d seen a ghost. After a long pause, he sighed and slapped Qin Ziling’s shoulder. "You’ve lost your mind!"  

With that, he turned away and began striking the iron-sand bag.  

The bag wasn’t filled with ordinary sand but a mix of fine iron and medicinal paste brewed from a secret formula. Each strike required channeling energy from the dantian into the palms.  

Only when his hands were swollen and red did he stop, soaking them in the hall’s medicinal solution to reduce swelling and strengthen muscles and bones.  

Qin Ziling smiled without explaining and began his own training.  

Before, striking the bag had only brought pain. But today, he sensed a faint medicinal energy seeping into his skin, stimulating and repairing his palms’ tissues.  

When he soaked his swollen hands in the solution, the sensation intensified—his blood and qi seemed to boil within, surging restlessly.  

*The Lin family’s secret formula is remarkable—no wonder they’ve established a martial hall in the prefecture. Before, my mediocre talent and weak foundation prevented me from sensing its effects. Had I experienced this sooner, even without nourishing meats and herbs, I might have broken through to the skin-membrane layer within two or three years.* Qin Ziling marveled at the solution’s potency.  

Lost in training, he barely noticed the sun setting.  

With the city gates closing at dusk due to recent unrest, Qin Ziling bid Liu Xiaoqiang farewell and left the hall.  

Not far from the martial hall, a carriage pulled up beside him.  

The curtain lifted, revealing Nan Gongyue’s cold, scowling face.
