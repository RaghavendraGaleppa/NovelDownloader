# Chapter 40: Gilded Heavenly Scroll Seal, Upgradable Divine Arts, World Seed!

"Three investment feedbacks appeared all at once?"

Li Mo was surprised and thrilled. The rewards reaped from the 'ice lump' this time around not only seemed high quality but were also satisfying in quantity. For a moment, Li Mo was a little overwhelmed. Sure enough, the 'ice lump's' jade thigh was good to cling to. Tomorrow, he absolutely had to treat the 'ice lump' to something good as a reward.

"Let's look at them one by one."

Li Mo turned his gaze to the first reward that appeared.

**[Gilded Heavenly Scroll Seal]:** "Capable of elevating the grade of any martial art, from divine arts downwards."

"It can even upgrade the grade of Divine Arts?" Li Mo gasped, truly showing his inexperience. To be honest, he had only ever heard tell of Divine Arts. One had to understand, Clearstream Sect had such a long history, and its founding patriarch even hailed from the Central Divine Province, yet the highest martial art within the sect was merely an Absolute Art. Mastering a Mid-grade Martial Art to Grand Perfection was enough to be considered a powerful figure in Ziyang Prefecture. Mastering a High-grade Martial Art to Grand Perfection was enough to establish a sect. Indeed. At present, Li Mo, as long as his cultivation kept up, could be considered a renowned expert within a prefecture simply with his Fire Crane Thousand Feather Sword Art.

As for Divine Arts... Li Mo had only heard from storytellers that a century ago, a powerful expert known as Martial Venerable Thousand Forms had fled to the Eastern Desolate Domain, carrying a Divine Art. At that time, countless foreign experts descended, and local sects like Clearstream Sect didn't even have the qualifications to intervene. Even the Great Yu Heaven-Seeking Guards personally got involved. Ultimately, no one knew who the Divine Art fell into. In his understanding, Divine Arts were the absolute pinnacle of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Above Divine Arts? That was completely beyond the scope of Li Mo's imagination.

"Alas, I don't even have a Divine Art right now, so I'll save it for later." Li Mo's heart surged with emotion, like a pauper who had suddenly stumbled upon a chest of gold bars. Though gold bars were good, he couldn't spend them immediately. The best martial art he currently possessed was merely an Absolute Art. Using the Gilded Heavenly Scroll Seal on an Absolute Art would be a complete waste of a heavenly treasure.

"Among the Heavenly Scroll Seals, there should be some that can upgrade Absolute Arts." "At that time, I can first upgrade an Absolute Art into a Divine Art..." "Besides, a 'mere Divine Art'—who knows when the 'ice lump' might drop one for me?" Li Mo's mentality had always been solid. Having read so many novels in his previous life, he might not have eaten pork, but he had seen pigs run. "Calm down, calm down."

Li Mo looked at the next reward.

**[World Seed]:** "A nascent small world, currently in an unformed chaotic state, which will gradually grow and perfect itself with the host's strength, and in the future has the potential to evolve into a true Great World!"

A Great World! Those five words alone were enough to demonstrate its immense value. This time, Li Mo was truly stunned. "No, I've only just started cultivating martial arts. Are the future standards already leaning towards Pangu's feat of splitting heaven and earth?"

The World Seed would continuously grow stronger as he did. And as the small world strengthened, it would in turn nurture him. Ultimately, the world would be him. In his world, the concept of strength and weakness would no longer matter. He would be both the Heavenly Dao and the Sovereign; with a single thought, he could overturn the heavens and earth, shifting stars and constellations.

"The vast Nine Heavens and Ten Lands also began with a World Seed." "Did it expand naturally, or did it grow by attaching itself to someone?" Li Mo's thoughts wandered, and he couldn't help but make connections. "Well, that's not something I can investigate for now." In his perception, his small world wasn't even a seedling yet.

"Claim." The thought had barely settled in Li Mo's mind. The next moment, the surroundings shifted like ripples on water. In a trance, he saw countless colors surging, reorganizing, changing, dazzling and strange. In an instant, all colors vanished, leaving only boundless emptiness. When he came to his senses, he found himself standing in a pure white space. Boundless white mist surrounded him on all sides. The space already opened up beneath his feet was only about the size of a basketball court, several times smaller than the Autumn Water Pavilion. But this space was entirely his.

"Sword, come!" Li Mo's expression was solemn as he casually beckoned. Immediately, a divine sword flew in from who knew where, its aura sharp and its edge fully revealed. Dressed in white like snow, he resembled a true peerless swordsman. Suddenly, he roared: "Sword Cleaves Heavenly Gate!" Instantly, boundless sword qi surged forth, sweeping across heaven and earth. Uh... If one ignored the fact that this 'heaven and earth' was only a few dozen feet in circumference, this sword strike was still quite magnificent.

"Being a swordsman is truly awesome." "If only I could use this move outside too." Li Mo sighed. His sword dao talent hadn't changed; it was merely his performative personality acting up, and this world was cooperating with his show... "This place still looks a bit too empty." "Let's decorate it a little." Li Mo developed some interest in tending to his private space.
