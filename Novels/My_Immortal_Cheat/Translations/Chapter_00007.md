# Chapter 7: The Young Woman

The next day, as the great sun first rose, Zhou Tian got up. Why? Of course, to foster relations.

He allowed the maids to help him dress. Although Zhou Tian deeply despised such dregs of feudal society, the clothing designs were too complex, and it would take him a long time to manage them by himself, so he had no choice but to endure this "dreg."

Once dressed, Zhou Tian, led by a servant, headed towards Tian Ling’s residence.

Prince Qin’s Estate was enormous and adorned with unparalleled splendor. Everywhere, one could see immortal flowers emitting a faint azure glow, sparkling and smooth—clearly extraordinary objects.

The servant led the way, with Zhou Tian following behind, though Zhou Tian seemed somewhat distracted. If one looked closely, Zhou Tian’s entire figure appeared slightly blurred.

If someone were to slow time by a thousandfold, they would see that while Zhou Tian appeared to be walking step by step, this was not the case. Every instant, Zhou Tian would vanish and then reappear, but the time interval was extremely short and the speed incredibly fast, so to an outsider, it looked no different from normal walking.

Zhou Tian was practicing his proficiency with [Teleportation]. Although he had acquired such a divine skill, it wasn't as divine when manifested by Zhou Tian himself. Powerful cultivators could react in an instant, but Zhou Tian was merely a mortal for now, without such powerful reactive capabilities. Therefore, he could only practice. Practice makes perfect; if he could train it to be an instinctive reaction, that would be ideal.

What prompted him to do this was his cheat: the Undying System.

The Undying System’s instructions explicitly stated: "The Undying System expends a large amount of unknown energy each time it revives the host. Therefore, self-destructive behavior by the host under any circumstances is prohibited. Deaths resulting from self-destructive behavior will not be counted as death instances. As for what constitutes self-destructive behavior, the Undying System reserves all rights of interpretation."

Furthermore, the Undying System had a limited number of resurrections every 24 hours—only one. If he died a second time within a day, he wouldn't truly die, but he would have to wait until the next day for the resurrection count to reset. During this period, he would be in a death state, devoid of self-awareness.

It was these restrictions that introduced a tiny blemish to what was originally a perfect yesterday, making Zhou Tian jump in frustration. He thought, it’s called the Undying System, so why so many restrictions?

Therefore, [Teleportation] still needed practice. Now Zhou Tian was a man with a fiancée; he needed to be presentable in all aspects. From the fragmented memories of his original body, he knew that this Imperial City was not so peaceful. Although he was the son of Prince Qin, in this Imperial City, you could pick anyone randomly off the street, and tracing them would likely involve several major figures.

What if he ran into some brain-dead scion on the street? It would be awkward if his attempt to show off backfired and he ended up getting beaten.

As he pondered this, the servant in front of him stopped, turned around, and respectfully addressed Zhou Tian: “Young Master, Alfalfa Garden has arrived.”

Zhou Tian looked up. Before him was a large courtyard. On the purple plaque above the gate were three large, gilded characters: “Alfalfa Garden,” grand and imposing. It was said that Prince Qin had personally inscribed them, imbued with his supreme martial dao aura. Unfortunately, Zhou Tian stared until his eyes hurt and still couldn’t discern anything special.

This was Prince Qin’s Estate’s guesthouse for honored guests. Elder Li alone wasn’t qualified for such an honor, though Prince Qin, Zhou Yi, outwardly praised him as an old master from Futian Continent. In truth, the man was old, but "old master" was a stretch. It was due to Tian Ling’s standing; after all, she was Zhou Tian’s future wife and thus warranted such respect.

“You may go.” Zhou Tian nodded, instructing the servant.

The servant acknowledged and withdrew.

*Whoosh!*

Zhou Tian let out a breath of relief, stepped forward, and knocked on the door.

*Thump, thump, thump!*

After a moment, the door opened. It was Tian Ling who opened it. Today, she was wearing a light green dress, exuding a youthful vibrancy.

Seeing Zhou Tian outside the door, she was slightly taken aback, and a faint blush appeared on her warm, jade-like face.

“Uh… why did you open the door? Where are the servants?” Zhou Tian asked, easing the awkward atmosphere.

“Elder Li and I are both members of sects; we’re not accustomed to having people serve us even when we’re dressing, so we let them leave.” Tian Ling’s cherry lips parted slightly, her voice gentle and moving. Then, as if remembering something, she hastily added, “I wasn’t saying it’s bad to have others serve you even when dressing; it’s just that we’re not used to it.”

Her speaking speed was noticeably faster than before, as if afraid Zhou Tian would misunderstand, because this was common among aristocratic families.

“Haha…” Zhou Tian couldn’t help but chuckle at Tian Ling’s appearance. After his conversation with her yesterday, he had thought this little girl was quite mature, but now it seemed she was still just a young girl.

After all, she had grown up in the Haotian Sect and was a direct disciple of the Sect Master; she had basically experienced no scheming and didn’t overthink things.

“I understand. Aren’t you going to let me in?”

Tian Ling slightly moved aside, quietly saying, “Please…”

Zhou Tian didn’t tease her further. He stepped inside, and Tian Ling closed the door, following behind him, head bowed, looking at Zhou Tian’s shadow on the ground, lost in thought.

“Your Highness’s visit is truly an honor!”

Entering the living room, Elder Li was sitting at a table, sipping tea. Although the tea served to guests in Prince Qin’s Estate wasn’t as fine as what Zhou Tian drank, it was by no means ordinary, and Elder Li had consumed a lot of it lately.

Seeing him enter, Elder Li rose and spoke.

Zhou Tian smiled slightly and returned the courtesy, “I apologize for disturbing Elder Li.”

“Haha,” Elder Li was pleased by his politeness and chuckled, saying, “Your Highness jokes. This is Prince Qin’s Estate; we should be the ones apologizing for the disturbance.”

He paused, then continued, “May I ask why Your Highness has come? Surely not just for pleasantries with an old man like me.” He then cast a glance at Tian Ling beside him.

“Today, I mainly wanted to invite Miss Tian Ling out for a stroll. I heard that Miss Tian Ling has always lived in the Haotian Sect and has never been down the mountain. Since she’s finally come to the Imperial City, I thought I should take her out to see things.”
