# Chapter 86 - Forging Eternal Life Through the Dao Seed

Outside the cave dwelling.

"Senior Brother, what is this about?"

Zhang Jing looked bewildered at Senior Brother Li standing before him.

He had just been about to enter Luodu Tower when he suddenly saw Senior Brother Li emerging from within. Before he could even greet him, he found himself inexplicably transported back to the entrance of his own cave dwelling before he could react.

"Junior Brother, wait a moment. There's a senior brother who wishes to meet you," Senior Brother Li said with a warm smile.

A senior brother? Wanted to meet him?

Zhang Jing didn't need to think hard—anyone Senior Brother Li addressed as "senior brother" was undoubtedly an inner court disciple.

But—

Zhang Jing couldn't help but recall Senior Brother Qiu, who had just left. Did these inner court disciples have to schedule appointments to meet a mere outer court disciple like him?

Before long.

"He's here!" Senior Brother Li exclaimed excitedly as he spotted a streak of light approaching from the distance.

Yet, in the next moment, a trace of doubt crept onto his face.

Why were there two streaks of light?

When he had communicated with Senior Brother Xie Yu earlier, the latter had clearly said he would come alone. Surely he wouldn't change his mind so abruptly.

Beside him, Zhang Jing also noticed the two streaks of light. One of them was familiar—he had just seen it moments ago.

---

In the reception room, the atmosphere was awkward.

Zhang Jing served spiritual tea to Senior Brother Qiu, Senior Brother Xie, and Senior Brother Li before obediently taking a seat, remaining perfectly still.

Senior Brother Qiu Xiuyun picked up his teacup with practiced ease, leisurely savoring the brew.

Opposite him, Senior Brother Xie Yu wore an expression of helplessness, occasionally glancing at Senior Brother Li beside him, lost in thought.

As for Senior Brother Li, he sat stiffly, as if on pins and needles, beads of sweat forming at his temples. He sipped his tea mechanically, barely registering its taste.

As time passed in silence, Senior Brother Qiu finally spoke, breaking the tension.

"Junior Brother Xie, have you come to invite Junior Brother Zhang Jing to join the Inheritance Pavilion in the future?" he asked with a knowing smile.

At the sound of his voice, both Senior Brother Li and Zhang Jing exhaled in relief. The oppressive atmosphere had been unbearable—especially for Senior Brother Li, who glanced down at his teacup, realizing he had already drained it without noticing. Had the silence continued, he might have started chewing on the cup itself.

"You saw right through me, Senior Brother Qiu," Senior Brother Xie Yu admitted sheepishly. "Since Junior Brother Zhang is a member of the Luodu team, as his direct senior brother, it's my duty to guide and nurture him."

He then turned his gaze squarely to Senior Brother Qiu. "But Senior Brother Qiu, what brings you here?"

"Ah, Junior Brother Xie, I come bearing greetings from Senior Brother You," Senior Brother Qiu replied with a laugh.

With that, he stood and walked over to Zhang Jing, producing a crystal vial from thin air. Through its translucent surface, a faintly glowing blue liquid could be seen swirling inside. Though the vial was tightly sealed, a delicate fragrance still managed to escape, filling the air with its aroma.

A single whiff was enough to make Zhang Jing's recently advanced seventh-level Qi Refining cultivation stir restlessly. An inexplicable longing arose within him, and his breathing unconsciously slowed.

"Senior Brother, what is this?" Zhang Jing asked, forcing his gaze away from the vial to meet Senior Brother Qiu's eyes. He didn't understand the meaning behind this gesture.

"Junior Brother, this is a gift from Senior Brother You—one and a half qian of Primordial Water Essence. This amount will suffice for your entire Qi Refining stage cultivation," Senior Brother Qiu explained.

He continued, "Senior Brother You also asked me to convey that if you choose to join the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, he will personally guide you in forging a top-tier Talismanic Dao Foundation. Once your foundation is complete, you will become the next Chief of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion."

As he spoke, a hint of envy crept into Senior Brother Qiu's voice.

Zhang Jing was momentarily stunned. Staring at the precious Primordial Water Essence before him and recalling the offer, he found himself at a loss for words.

Was he tempted? Of course. But Zhang Jing was even more certain that the path he would walk in the future could only be the True Law Path.

Meanwhile, across from him, Senior Brother Li felt his mind go blank upon hearing the words "Senior Brother You" and "one and a half qian of Primordial Water Essence."

Who was Senior Brother You? The Chief of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion's inner court, a name listed on the True Spirit Ranking, a figure already noticed by the Upper Realm. In terms of status, he even surpassed the Pavilion Master of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion!

Yet such a figure had sent an inner court senior brother to deliver a gift to Zhang Jing? And not just any gift—one and a half qian of Primordial Water Essence! The reward the Dao Academy had allocated to the top ten teams this time included only seven fen of Primordial Water Essence in total, highlighting its rarity.

When had Primordial Water Essence ever been measured in liang?

But when Senior Brother Li heard the words "top-tier Talismanic Dao Foundation" and "next Chief of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion," it was as if thunder had struck his ears, leaving his mind blank. Only one thought remained:

The Luodu team had struck gold!!!

If Zhang Jing became the Chief of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, the Luodu team's ranking would naturally rise to first place—unshakably so!

Yet while Senior Brother Li was overjoyed, Senior Brother Xie Yu felt nothing but despair. The Inheritance Pavilion might have been able to scrape together some Primordial Water Essence, but the condition of Senior Brother You personally guiding Zhang Jing to forge a top-tier Talismanic Dao Foundation left them powerless.

They had no senior brothers ranked on the True Spirit Ranking. As for the Pavilion Master's guidance—if that had been effective, someone in the Inheritance Pavilion would have forged a superior Dao Foundation long ago. They wouldn't have had to wait desperately for the opening of the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Heaven to seek enlightenment as a last resort.

After all, if the Pavilion Masters had been capable of forging superior Dao Foundations, why would they have resigned themselves to remaining in the Lower Realm?

Before Senior Brother Qiu, Zhang Jing finally regained his composure. Instead of accepting the Primordial Water Essence, he bowed deeply and said apologetically:

"Senior Brother Qiu, I am deeply grateful for your and Senior Brother You's kindness, but I must respectfully decline. I have already resolved to walk the True Law Path."

His voice was firm and resolute.

Senior Brother Qiu's expression froze momentarily, his gaze turning puzzled. He couldn't fathom why Zhang Jing would reject such an offer despite his exceptional talent. Had he been in Zhang Jing's place, he would have chosen the Talismanic Dao Path without hesitation—even without these incentives.

Witnessing this, Senior Brother Li snapped out of his daydream, his heart aching with regret. If possible, he would have taken back Zhang Jing's words himself.

Yet in Senior Brother Xie Yu's eyes, a glimmer of hope appeared.

After being rejected, Senior Brother Qiu quickly regained his composure, as if he had anticipated Zhang Jing's response. He recalled Senior Brother You's instructions before his departure:

"Junior Brother Qiu, if Zhang Jing insists on the True Law Path, let him. As long as he joins the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, I have ways to change his mind."

"But Senior Brother, what if Zhang Jing remains committed to the True Law Path?"

"Then we'll see how he performs in the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Heaven. If he seizes the opportunity to forge a superior Dao Foundation, what does it matter if the Thousand Techniques Pavilion has a Chief who follows the True Law Path? Who would dare object? If not, he'll have no choice but to forge a Talismanic Dao Foundation."

"I'm doing this for his own good!"

"So you're determined to have Zhang Jing succeed you?"

"Do any of you have the talent and aptitude he does?"

Snapping back to the present, Senior Brother Qiu smiled and said, "Junior Brother, take it. Even if you choose the True Law Path, the Thousand Techniques Pavilion's offer stands. Senior Brother You can even arrange for the Chief of the Spirit Dao Pavilion to guide you."

Though he added silently to himself: That is, if Junior Brother Zhang still remains as resolute after witnessing the might of Senior Brother You's Talismanic Dao Foundation in the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Heaven.

"Understood. Thank you, Senior Brother You, and thank you, Senior Brother Qiu, for your kindness," Zhang Jing said gratefully as he accepted the Primordial Water Essence. With the offer laid out so generously, he saw no reason to refuse.

"Excellent. Train well, Junior Brother. Senior Brother You will be waiting for you in the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Heaven. I'll take my leave now," Senior Brother Qiu said with a laugh.

He then turned to Senior Brother Xie Yu. "Junior Brother Xie, my apologies. Let me treat you to spiritual wine another day to make up for this."

"Senior Brother Qiu, you jest. Junior Brother Zhang's admission to the Thousand Techniques Pavilion is a result of his talent. As his senior brother, I couldn't be happier for him," Senior Brother Xie Yu replied, forcing a smile while inwardly lamenting.

What could he do when the Thousand Techniques Pavilion had enlisted one of the Dragon Lake Dao Academy's two True Spirit Ranking elites? 

"Pavilion Master, it's not that I didn't try—our opponent simply cheated!" he cried inwardly.

After exchanging farewells, Senior Brother Xie Yu followed Senior Brother Qiu out of Zhang Jing's cave dwelling, leaving only Senior Brother Li behind.

Some time later, after confirming that both inner court disciples had left Luodu Island, Senior Brother Li clapped Zhang Jing on the shoulder and burst into uncontrollable laughter—so hard that tears streamed down his face.

No one knew the pressure he had endured as the captain of the Luodu team in recent times. Now, everything had turned around!

Overcome with emotion, he could only stand there grinning foolishly, at a loss for words.

The next Chief of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion—from their Luodu team!

Before this, such a thought wouldn't have even crossed his mind in his wildest dreams.

Truly, fate works in mysterious ways.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

In the cultivation chamber, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes.

After half a month of relentless cultivation—aided by the ninth-level Water Attribute demon core, along with other demon cores and rare treasures he had recently acquired—his cultivation had quietly advanced beyond the seventh level of Qi Refining.

With this, all his conventional resources had been exhausted, and his Dao merits were nearly depleted.

Without hesitation, he retrieved the Primordial Water Essence gifted by Senior Brother Qiu.

---

Meanwhile, on Panlong Island, the captains of the top ten outer court teams had gathered under the supervision of a purple-robed inner court senior brother to determine the distribution of the Dao Academy's rewards.

"Everyone, how shall we divide the rewards this time?" Senior Brother Li asked, standing with his hands behind his back, his face brimming with confidence.

"This time, Luodu takes thirty percent, Panlong fifteen, Mist Veil fifteen, and the remaining forty is divided equally among the other teams. How about that?" a burly man proposed through gritted teeth.

Beside him, a beautiful middle-aged woman nodded reluctantly, though resentment flickered in her eyes. Both silently cursed inwardly:

"What damn luck!"

The news they had received from the inner court senior brother filled them with envy and regret—enough to make their teeth ache.

How had they failed to recruit such a prodigy—one favored by Senior Brother You, Chief of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, and designated as his successor—when he had already been ranked third?

Meanwhile, the captains of the other seven teams, who had initially come expecting a spectacle, were stunned. The situation was nothing like what they had anticipated.
