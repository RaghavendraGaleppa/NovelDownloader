# Chapter 388: The Gift Most Loved by a Gentleman (1/2)

Inside the room of the so-called "Divine Hammer Tyrant," Li Mo sat on the bed, looking at the open box. It was his birthday.

After awakening from the confusion of his previous life, long-sealed memories surged forth, each one as vivid as if it were yesterday.

There were exactly seventeen items, one for each year of his life.

"Ice Cube..."

Li Mo looked up in a daze.

The fireworks on that snowy night had illuminated her red dress, the slightly crooked white cat-fur hat, the slender legs wrapped in white silk stockings, and the black hair tied up with a jade hairpin, dusted with snowflakes.

There was a Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.

And in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, there was a New Year's Goddess of his own.

She had suddenly appeared by his side, bringing him a birthday surprise.

Little Li Mo was feeling exactly that right now.

"I found these while cleaning the room. They seem... to be your things," Ying Bing said softly, sitting beside him with her eyes lowered.

"......"

Li Mo looked at the pacifier in the box.

Even if he had been a little tyrant in his previous life, he couldn't have possibly bought this kind of thing right after being born.

"Maybe it was a gift from my New Year's fairy," Li Mo put down the pacifier and picked up a jade pendant carved with white bamboo joints.

It symbolized that a boy had grown up and could now wear fine jade like a gentleman.

He had thought it was exquisite when they were strolling together, but despite haggling for a long time and even using the "I'll walk away if you don't sell it" tactic, he had failed to get it.

Yet, the Ice Cube had gone back and bought it.

"I'm glad you like it..."

Seeing him happily putting on the pendant, Ying Bing quietly took off her shoes and sat on the bed as well. Her feet, wrapped in silk stockings, were tucked to one side.

As she brewed tea, she glanced at him from the corner of her eye.

Suddenly, the tea in the bowl rippled slightly. Her expression froze for a moment, and she bit her lip as she pulled her feet back.

"This wooden sword is really nice. If I had one when I was little, the other kids would have been so jealous," Li Mo said seriously, holding the wooden sword in his left hand.

That's right. Little Li Mo had a swordsman's dream since he were young!

"Are all of them to your liking?" Ying Bing asked, looking nonchalantly at the fireworks outside the window. Her clear, deep eyes were illuminated, sparkling with light.

Li Mo hugged the box and said earnestly, "Mm, they fit the hearts of me at different ages."

"Then what fits your heart the most right now?"

"Naturally, it's the jade..."

Li Mo was originally debating between the jade pendant and the wooden sword.

But his eyes seemed to have a will of their own, drifting to the side, towards the patch of white—the slender, delicate foot wrapped in the stocking.

"....."

The Ice Cube's complexion had always been fair, but now it had suddenly become different from the white cat-fur hat, the color difference becoming strikingly apparent.

As is well known, jade is a synonym for nobility and purity.

Bamboo symbolizes integrity, never bending.

When the two words "Jade Bamboo" are combined, it means that jade can be shattered but cannot change its whiteness, and bamboo can be burned but cannot destroy its joints. It has always been favored by gentlemen.

Also, as is well known, Little Li Mo is a super gentleman.

A gentleman loves Jade Bamboo. √

Li Mo is a gentleman. √.

So, Li Mo only has a gentleman's noble aspirations. What's wrong with that?

Moreover, the Ice Cube herself had taken off her shoes, her legs crossed and lying there, her ice-like skin and jade-like bones bathed in the red glow of the fireworks.

Perhaps she didn't know.

The budding of an orchid in a secluded valley is enough to make all the flowers on the Hundred Flowers List lose their color.

In this scene.

Li Mo felt that even if he were now a peerless sword immortal, a sword god of the present age, the hand holding the wooden sword would have to tremble slightly, let alone the fact that he was only a step away from becoming the "Hengyun Sword Hero."

And no other swordsman was as proficient in foot massage as he was...

"Ice Cube, today is my birthday. The sixteen gifts you gave me are all the best. The last one..."

"But... I haven't bathed today."

---

"How can you doubt yourself like that? The Cold Fairy is spotless. Bathing is just a hobby."

"......"

"How about this, I have a bathtub in my room..."

Gentleman Li Mo stroked his chin, as if he were doing something serious and proper.

The Cold Fairy gave him a long look, bit her lip with her pearly teeth, and silently changed her posture, turning her legs to face him.

If she let him keep talking, he might suggest she take a bath in his room.

"Ice Cube, this has been the happiest birthday I've ever had."

"Don't do this again..."

The Ice Cube was already used to him massaging her feet. The main issue was that Little Li Mo, taking advantage of his birthday, was being excessively arrogant today.

He wouldn't even let her calves go.

Ying Bing took out the little money jar from the big-headed doll. She had intended to count her money.

Then she discovered.

The jar was empty.

She had almost forgotten. She had been in a hurry to buy things today and didn't haggle. She just paid whatever the seller asked.

Since she couldn't distract herself by counting money, her thoughts, like the fireworks outside, burst forth one by one in brilliant explosions, making the lake of her heart shimmer.

Little Li Mo had been a little tyrant in his幼崽 period.

It turned out that as he grew up, he hadn't learned to be good.

Do men become worse as they grow older?

What about next year...

An hour later, the sound of fireworks outside gradually faded, leaving only the night sky stained by the fireworks. New Year's Eve was over, and so was Li Mo's birthday.

"Let's start the dual cultivation. I'm about to break through," said the seventeen-year-old Li Mo, who had become a little worse, deciding to get down to business. He had already mastered the secrets of dual cultivation long ago.

"I'm going back to my room," Ying Bing gently pulled her foot back, hugged her knees, and looked at him warily.

"Aren't we going to practice today?"

"But when I came, I ran into your father and mother at your door," Ying Bing said with a cold expression.

Li Mo: "......"

Given his past record, his dad would definitely pass by here on his way to the latrine at night, and he would pay special attention.

Besides, it was the first day of the new year tomorrow. He had to go with his parents to the Ying family's old house to offer incense.

After that, they would have to go to the Broken Axe Mountain.

"Alright then."

"I'm going back," Ying Bing put on her boots and got up to leave.

With a cold and expressionless face, she stumbled at the door, perhaps because her legs had gone numb from sitting for too long...

The next morning.

Before the relatives and friends came to visit, his parents got up early and woke Li Mo up, carrying things they had prepared long ago.

After New Year's Eve, the liveliness in Qinghe County remained undiminished, and the festive atmosphere grew even stronger. Perhaps it would be even more lively tomorrow.

The ground in front of the Li residence was covered with firecracker paper and snow. Everyone was ready to set off. Li Dalong stuffed some incense and candles into Li Mo's hand.

"In the past, we didn't take you to offer incense because you were still young. Now you're a grown man. From now on, you must join us in these rituals. No matter how high you fly in the future, don't forget to come to the Ying family's old house to offer a stick of incense during the New Year," his father said, patting his shoulder, then went ahead.

Li Mo, holding the incense and candles, looked at Ying Bing beside him.

"Ice Cube, are you coming with us?"

"Yes," Ying Bing looked towards the direction of the old house.

That place was no longer the shadow of her childhood.

However, though the shadow was gone, the heavy fog had yet to clear.

Li Mo and the Ice Cube were thinking the same thing.

Why did the Ying family attract that black Nian Beast?

What does this have to do with the Ice Cube?

Just a trip to the old house might not be enough to answer these questions. Perhaps they would need to go to the Broken Axe Mountain to find the answers.
