# Chapter 526: A Great True Person's Lifelong Fortune

He couldn't help but ask, "What does Senior Brother mean?"

Chu Chengnan lowered his head, his gaze sweeping over his own tattered body, carefully sensing his condition.

"The Foundation Establishment is merely the root that carries spiritual power. If it shatters, one returns to being a mortal, with their foundation completely lost. It is true that the price for seeking the Golden Core is agonizingly high, but it is not an incurable disease. After all, I was a Great True Person at the peak of Foundation Establishment."

A hint of unconcealed pride tinged his voice.

"Even though my inner world has withered and my meridians are severed, as long as my soul remains, the profound cultivation I have painstakingly trained for a hundred years and accumulated through five lifetimes is still there.

'Cultivation attainment' is not the same as 'cultivation level'; it is one's 'understanding' and 'accumulation' of the heavens, the earth, and the self. Even if this foundation is destroyed, how could my attainment be completely scattered?"

He paused, seemingly silently activating a secret technique to sustain his life force. The dissipating aura of blood and energy around him slightly stabilized before he continued, "I only need to find a place rich in turbid evil or vital energy to barely survive. After a few years of recuperation, supplemented by medicinal pills to strengthen my foundation and nourish my vitality, my broken body will naturally recover somewhat. Given time, it is not entirely impossible to condense a new foundation once more.

By then, although I will have lost all my past cultivation and fallen back to the starting point of a mortal, my insights from this century will still remain, and the foundation of my attainment will be intact. Starting over from scratch doesn't preclude the opportunity to advance once more..."

These words, spoken by a cultivator who had just experienced a shattered foundation, failed in his ascension, become a废人 (cripple), and been abandoned by his master, were spoken as calmly as if he were telling someone else's story.

The toughness etched into his very bones and the obsession with "my attainment is still here" made Xu Yunfan involuntarily feel a sense of respect.

The willpower of the Senior Brother before him was far more resilient than he had imagined.

He had not seriously interacted with this Senior Brother, the Hundred Peaks True Person Chu, before.

Within the Primordial Origin Sect, among those Foundation Establishment True Persons who had opened their own Dao Veins and established their own peaks, he truly could not tell who was good and who was bad.

Furthermore, the Primordial Origin Sect was known as the Primordial Demon Sect for a reason; it was not entirely wrong to view all these Foundation Establishment True Persons as villains. Xu Yunfan naturally did not want to have too much contact with them.

He might fall into a trap one day.

Chu Chengnan slowly raised his head, his gaze passing through the turbid evil smoke filling the valley to look in a certain direction.

"This place is not suitable for a long stay. Take care on your path, Junior Brother Xu. If one day..."

He seemed to want to say more, but in the end, he shook his head and did not speak.

He propped himself up with his hands on the ground, trying with all his might to stand up again, but collapsed back down due to exhaustion, coughing up black blood mixed with fragments of his internal organs.

Xu Yunfan took a step forward and extended a hand. "Senior Brother, do you need..."

Chu Chengnan raised his hand, which was covered in terrifying cracks, and shook it firmly but powerlessly, stopping Xu Yunfan from helping him.

He clenched his jaw, the muscles on his cheeks tightening, and a final glimmer of fierce defiance burned in his eyes.

He stopped speaking and tried again. Little by little, extremely slowly yet exceptionally determinedly, using his remaining arm strength, he dragged his completely crippled lower body along the gravel and stones, "crawling" inch by inch toward the direction of the relatively calmer turbid evil river outside the valley.

Every movement left a trail on the ground, a mixture of mud, shredded flesh, and dark red bloodstains, which was shocking to behold.

Xu Yunfan stood in place, quietly watching that figure, hunched and back like an ordinary old man, crawling tenaciously in the ruins of despair.

The howling wind swept past, stirring up the lingering evil energy, almost swallowing the figure whole.

Chu Chengnan's words, "my attainment is still here," along with his current struggle for survival, and that saying, "a man must rely on himself, and even a True Lord is untrustworthy," rang in Xu Yunfan's mind like a great bell, reverberating repeatedly.

When Chu Chengnan's figure finally disappeared behind the jagged rocks and the thick fog of turbid evil, an indescribable and complex emotion churned in Xu Yunfan's chest.

It was admiration, it was pity, it was the chilling feeling of a hare mourning the death of a fox, and even more so, a shock and awe at the nearly mad obsession with seeking life in a desperate situation.

But more importantly.

He looked at the storage bracelet in his hand, which contained seven-tenths of Chu Chengnan's积蓄 (savings) from five lifetimes, almost making his eyes spin.

Piles of spiritual materials, various precious herbs, and rare refining materials were simply innumerable.

The foundation possessed by a Great True Person who had cultivated for five lifetimes was so extravagantly luxurious that even Xu Yunfan's calm heart fluctuated for a long time.

He had stumbled upon a great fortune on his journey.

Chu Chengnan had kept only three-tenths for himself, which was more than enough for him.

This man was the true seeker of immortality.

With this great gift, Xu Yunfan let out a long sigh, and the words of praise for Chu Chengnan in his heart were given without reservation.

As long as no unexpected changes occurred, Chu Chengnan would definitely make a comeback.

The other party naturally understood that in his current state, he could not stay in the Primordial Origin Sect. Without a True Lord's protection and with his foundation shattered, it was possible that some Foundation Establishment True Person might get greedy.

Just as Xu Yunfan withdrew his gaze and prepared to return to Hanyaguan to close his cultivation, a spiritual message, devoid of any emotional fluctuation yet containing a massive spiritual pressure, abruptly imprinted itself in his mind.

It originated from the aura of True Lord Qingyuan.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow.

The content of the message was short and direct, without any warmth: "Foundation Establishment True Person Xu Yunfan of Zhenwu Peak, within three days, take this order, leave Hanyaguan, and return to the sect's Zhenwu Peak for assignment."

Subsequently, a mark, formed by spiritual power and symbolizing the identity of True Lord Qingyuan, appeared before Xu Yunfan's eyes and transformed into a token that fell into his hand.

This was the mobilization order.

"The decree of True Lord Qingyuan..."

Xu Yunfan muttered to himself silently, the corner of his mouth curling into an arc of understanding mixed with a hint of mockery.

The battle at Hanyaguan was over.

Chu Chengnan, this chess piece, was completely报废 (scrapped). There was no longer any need to defend this place, or rather, the resources exchanged with other True Lords here were no longer cost-effective for True Lord Qingyuan.

And he, a Foundation Establishment disciple who the True Lord found somewhat peculiar and who had just "witnessed an important lesson," had also reached the time to be recalled and have his purpose reassigned.

He raised his eyes and looked toward the distant Hanyaguan, where smoke still billowed, but the core battle seemed to have already subsided.

The magnificent giant wall and fortress, having endured the impact of a Great True Person wielding a spiritual treasure, was now covered in cracks everywhere, its cold energy in disarray, shrouded in an atmosphere of decay and chaos.

However, it was no longer any of his concern. He only had to wait for the subsequent Hanyaguan Garrison Commander sent to clean up the mess.

"What a pity for this Hanyaguan. I originally thought I could stay a bit longer and make a good profit. It seems the benefits of Hanyaguan can no longer be reaped."

Xu Yunfan muttered with a sense of regret in his heart.

As an important outpost for the Primordial Origin Sect to contact the other two sects, Hanyaguan gathered resources from all sides. The turbid evil essence, minerals, and even the potential legacies left by fallen cultivators in battle were all enormous potential sources of wealth.

Leaving now meant giving up on the huge profits that might exist in the future.

However, this sliver of regret was quickly replaced by the calculations in Xu Yunfan's heart.
