# Chapter 522: I'm Furious! (Acting)

If there wasn't a hidden hand behind this, Xu Yunfan wouldn't believe it. It was highly probable that a True Lord had secretly intervened for things to turn out this way.

There are only so many Golden Core positions in the world. With the Celestial and Terrestrial Stars totaling one hundred and eight, excluding the dozen or so True Lords from the Three Great Sects, the remaining positions are either concealed by the Heavenly Dao or devoured and merged into other Golden Core True Lords' cave-heavens.

How many vacant positions could possibly be left?

After all, cultivators across the world are like greedy rats. The Heavenly Dao within the Taihua Void Realm originally intended to drive cultivators to conquer other realms to strengthen itself.

But how could cultivators be willing to be so restrained by the Heavenly Dao? As a result, they acted like rats, trying every means to dig into the root qi of the Taihua Void Realm, forge Dao Fruits, and attain the Golden Core position.

And even go a step further to achieve the Nascent Soul Dao Lord.

Only during the great war between the Three Great Sects could one find a sliver of opportunity.

Right now is the best time.

Xu Yunfan even suspected that the Primordial Origin Sect initiated this great war for the sole purpose of allowing Chu Chengnan to become a Golden Core True Lord.

The roar of the world's qi mechanisms grew increasingly clear. High above the firmament, the invisible Dao rules representing "Immovability," "Bearing," and "Heaviness" had already become clearly visible, transforming into a complex vortex of runes. It slowly rotated, descending toward the top of Chu Chengnan's head.

As long as this rune completely merged with the mountain shadow behind him, the Dao Fruit would be formed.

"Stop him!"

"We absolutely cannot let the Demonic Sect gain another lackey!"

Roars of even greater fury and unwillingness echoed faintly from the distance.

From the direction of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, an even sharper Sword Intent was brewing.

Within the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land, it seemed a powerful Buddhist light was also attempting to split off a portion of its power to strike!

Just at this critical moment.

*BOOM-CRACK!!!*

A deafening sound shook the universe. It wasn't from an attack, but from Chu Chengnan himself.

He seemed to have transformed into a primordial divine mountain taking form.

The Immovable Profound Mountain Dao Fruit, suspended above his head, manifested into the world. As if drawn by the strongest attraction, like a mountain returning to its place, it instantly accelerated. Carrying the immense force that could suppress all ages, it plummeted toward the mountain shadow behind Chu Chengnan.

The moment the Dao Fruit touched the mountain shadow...

*Hum!*

The moment the Dao Fruit touched the mountain shadow, an unexpected change occurred.

A dark golden Buddhist light tore through the void without warning, moving faster than the limits of perception.

It possessed the strength of a Great Perfected One at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm!

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. With his mid-Foundation Establishment spiritual sense, he couldn't even issue a warning in time, let alone出手 to block it.

His mind raced, but he ultimately suppressed the urge to make a move.

Heaven have mercy, he was just a mere mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator. How could he possibly withstand this expert, whom the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land called a Great Arhat?

He had already worked hard enough just to grind down that Sword Qi.

An emaciated old monk in a maroon cassock appeared directly above the Dao Fruit. His face was like ancient bronze, with a cinnabar dot on his forehead. The qi around him was as round and solid as a diamond boulder. He was clearly a Great Arhat of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm.

The old monk's deep-set eyes were devoid of any ripples. In his hand, a gilded Demon-Subduing Pestle, shrouded in the light of Nihilistic Nirvana, viciously smashed down toward the "Immovable Profound Mountain" Dao Fruit that was about to fuse with Chu Chengnan.

*Hum!*

*BOOM!*

A clang like metal striking metal wasn't from a physical collision, but from the shockwaves of the Dao Fruit. The Demon-Subduing Pestle had actually breached the boundaries of reality and law, striking the Immovable Profound Mountain Dao Fruit head-on.

The pestle was covered in Buddhist Sanskrit, and the Buddhist power coiling around its body was transcendent. It was a "Nihilistic Red Lotus" qi unique to a higher realm, one that had condensed the origin of a Dao Fruit. It was clearly a natal Spirit Treasure refined by a Bodhisattva after proving their Dao Fruit.

Xu Yunfan sucked in a cold breath upon seeing this.

The Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land had no shame. Those Bodhisattvas played dirty, even bringing out the Spirit Treasures they had personally refined.

What is a Spirit Treasure?

Artifact, Dharma Treasure, Spirit Treasure.

A Spirit Treasure can be called the object of a True Lord's attainment of the Dao.

"No!"

Chu Chengnan's furious roar, his eyes bursting with rage, shook the heavens.

He was in the most vulnerable moment of his soul fusing with the Dao Fruit, watching helplessly as the "Immovable Profound Mountain" that carried the hope of his entire Dao path was pierced through by the immense power of a Spirit Treasure.

The Dao Fruit instantly dimmed and disintegrated. As if slapped down by an invisible giant hand, it wailed as it sank into the gushing filth and evil qi of the earth veins beneath寒鸦关 (Cold Crow Pass), merging with the violent and chaotic terrestrial qi, and once again concealed within the rules of the heavens and earth.

The once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity for the Dao Fruit to bestow its favor was cut short.

The backlash from the interrupted quest for the Golden Core and the Dao was terrifyingly sudden.

The vast qi that had been rising around Chu Chengnan was as if掐断 (choked off) by an invisible giant hand, plummeting wildly!

The cave-heaven foundation that was supporting the Dao Fruit took a direct hit from the Spirit Treasure's power, emitting a "cracking" sound like porcelain shattering.

His burly and sturdy body trembled violently. A mouthful of heart blood, mixed with Xuanhuang spiritual light, gushed out. His complexion instantly turned ashen as gold paper. The mountain-like heaviness around him crumbled. He was like a kite with a broken string, plummeting from the sky.

The majestic pressure of a peak Foundation Establishment Great Perfected One vanished without a trace, leaving only a aura of decay and death.

Xu Yunfan's heart turned cold. The quest for the Golden Core had failed.

The Eight Scenery qi in his hands subconsciously added a bit more force.

The cultivators below Cold Crow Pass, who had activated the mountain protection array, also looked on with mixed feelings.

Some older cultivators couldn't help but shake their heads and sigh.

"In a thousand years, not a single person has become a True Lord and proven a Dao Fruit. The greatest hope we've had in recent times, what a pity..."

What a pity the Three Great Sects were at each other's throats. If anyone in a sect was about to become a True Lord, the other two sects would naturally go all out to suppress them.

*Pfft!*

The Great Arhat who had thrown the Spirit Treasure Demon-Subduing Pestle was also not faring well.

Forcibly using a Bodhisattva's Spirit Treasure, far beyond his own realm, to launch a fatal blow, his entire body of Buddhist light trembled violently. The surface of his Vajra body was suddenly covered in cracks like a spider's web. He resembled a clay Buddha statue on the verge of shattering. His aura plummeted to its lowest point, clearly having suffered a terrifying backlash.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan also reacted instantly.

If he didn't make a move now, when would he?

Otherwise, if he was to be held accountable later, he would have no way to explain himself.

When mixing in a gang, strength is one thing, attitude is another.

Xu Yunfan was genuinely enraged!

Fake.

On the surface, he had to put on a good show.

The moment he completely ground down the last trace of the entangled Sword Qi, his eyes were already as cold as a blade.

"Bald donkey! Pay with your life!"

"Eight Scenery Cloud Qi · Thunder Prison!"

Without a single word of废话 (nonsense), the meticulously prepared killing move was unleashed with ferocious intensity. Xu Yunfan formed hand seals with both hands, pushing the Thunder True Meaning of the *Mystic Skies Nine Firmaments Undying True Sutra* to its absolute limit.

The eight-colored cloud qi, refined from the Xuan Du Eight Scenery Smelting Heaven Creation Cloud Scripture, churned and surged around him, instantly transforming into a sea of thunder covering ten li.

The cloud qi of the Eight Trigrams—Qian, Kun, Zhen, Xun, Kan, Li, Gen, and Dui—did not act independently. Instead, they were commanded by Xu Yunfan's Mystic Skies True Meaning, evolving into the profound mystery of thunder that destroys evil spirits.

Golden, purple, and incandescent electric serpents and thunder dragons roared, carrying the majestic might of the heavens that passes judgment on all things. Ignoring the distance of space, they violently poured down upon the Great Arhat whose Vajra body was on the verge of shattering.
