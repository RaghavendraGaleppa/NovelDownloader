# Chapter 130: Li Mo: "Ying Bing, Have You Ever Soaked in a Hot Spring?"

"Is the trial over already?"

Li Mo looked up at the sky.

Hmm.

That ice lump did catch up quite a bit later on.

But there was nothing for it. He had built up too big of a lead earlier. After taking the Bone Ape's beast token, his total happened to be just a bit more than Ying Bing's.

"Let's go, everyone, let's head to the gathering point."

Li Mo took the Phoenix Blood Spirit Grass and glanced at it.

Then he casually stuffed it into Old Xiao's arms.

"Ah?"

Xiao Qin held the spirit grass, feeling the vibrant life force within it.

This was the reason he had braved the danger of life and death to enter the秘境 (Secret Realm).

It was also the rare treasure needed for his Master to reconstruct his body in the future, making it incredibly precious.

If it were taken outside, many people would fight and kill for it, even brothers turning on each other or husband and wife falling out...

"I can't..."

"Take it!"

Li Mo's five fingers closed, making a gesture that said 'no need for words.'

"But this spirit grass... if it weren't for Junior Brother Li, it never would have ended up in my hands."

Xiao Qin's feelings were complicated, and he forced a smile that looked worse than crying.

"I still haven't repaid the favor I owed Junior Brother Li from before."

"Now I've incurred a new debt..."

He truly didn't know how he would ever repay it.

Old Xiao even felt for a moment that if only he were a girl, he could repay him with his body.

"Take it. The more lice, the less they itch; the more debts, the less you worry."

"I don't have much use for this thing anyway," Li Mo said with a helpless laugh.

"Alright."

Xiao Qin put away the Phoenix Blood Spirit Grass, his face full of shame.

He asked softly in his heart:

"Master, could I practice that divine skill of yours together with Junior Brother Li?"

In the short term, he wanted to repay the debt but lacked the ability.

"If it suits him, naturally, he can."

"But you must remind him that he absolutely cannot leak it."

The Thousand Form Martial Sovereign hesitated for a few seconds, and in the end, he just let out a long sigh and agreed.

Whether it was the Deep Yin Soul Nourishing Wood or this Phoenix Blood Spirit Grass, the true beneficiary was him.

However.

It was still too early to say anything about that.

The conditions for practicing that martial art were very strict; having good talent wasn't enough.

Even Ying Bing might not necessarily be able to practice it.

After putting away the spirit grass, Xiao Qin shook his head and said:

"I won't be following Brother Li to the next level."

"The next trial is probably even more dangerous. Not only would I be unable to help Brother Li there, but I would also hold you back."

"Besides, the thing I wanted most is already in my hand."

Xiao Qin cupped his fists.

Li Mo pondered for a moment, then nodded and gave up on the idea of giving him some beast tokens.

"You can go to the Treant Forest and leave with everyone else."

"Everyone?"

"Yeah, just go there."

Although he didn't know who "everyone" in the Treant Forest referred to.

Anyway, Old Xiao trusted Li Mo unconditionally, so he immediately nodded.

"What about you, Senior Brother Tang?" Li Mo turned and asked.

"Master told me to advance and retreat with you, so of course, I'm following you."

The mud monkey was Tang Xiaobao, revealing a row of white baby teeth as he smiled.

Collecting the beast tokens from these Bone Apes would just about squeeze him into the top fifty.

In the end.

Xiao Qin went to the Treant Forest according to the direction Li Mo gave.

Meanwhile, Li Mo's group of three set off towards the direction indicated by the pillar of light.

At the same time, a pleasant notification sounded in his ear:

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing a Phoenix Blood Spirit Grass in 'Xiao Qin'.】

【Investment Feedback: Mist Flower Ageless Spring.】

【Mist Flower Ageless Spring】: "Once deployed, it can generate a hot spring ten meters wide and long. It remains perpetually clean and possesses an extremely strong fatigue-relieving effect. Dropping any medicinal liquid into it will allow the body to fully absorb it, and it also has the effect of beautifying the skin."

A hot spring?

The effects look quite lengthy, but they seem pretty useless.

For absorbing spiritual treasures, he could just refine them in the Dragon Tiger Pill Furnace, which would be much more effective than soaking in a bath.

Relieving fatigue... he hasn't been refining his body that much recently.

Beautifying the skin is even more nonsense. With how handsome I am, do I need beautification?

---

"I guess I can only put it in Autumn Water Pavilion as an item for enjoyment," Li Mo muttered.

......

In front of the open ground where the white light was emitted.

More than forty people had gathered there.

The strongest beast in the Secret Realm was at the Divine Observation Realm.

And the entry restriction was also the Divine Observation Realm.

To be able to kill one or even several opponents of the same realm meant one was a top-tier genius with extraordinary combat prowess, either using powerful martial arts, possessing divine weapons, or having strange treasures to rely on.

Most of the people were dusty and disheveled, and there was hardly anyone who wasn't injured. Moreover, there were almost no one at the Internal Breath Realm.

Why do I say "almost"?

Ying Bing stood in a corner, still wearing that fish-tooth brocade skirt with black cloud gauze underneath.

She stood alone, holding her sword, aloof and unapproachably elegant.

Only when looking at the ranking above would a hint of confusion flicker in her beautiful eyes.

Well...

It wasn't just Ying Bing who was confused.

Everyone who looked at the final ranking was petrified. They weren't just shocked; they felt it was absurd.

It was so absurd it was ridiculous.

"The first and second place are two people from the Internal Breath Realm?"

"That little girl got over three hundred beast tokens? How did she do it?"

"I saw Ying Bing fight. I'm at the fourth acupoint of the Divine Observation Realm, and I wouldn't dare to fight her even if you killed me. She can only be described as terrifying."

"Okay, then what about Li Mo?"

"This Secret Realm must be broken! I don't accept this! Let's have a rematch!"

It was understandable that the crowd couldn't accept this.

They could tolerate a prodigy from the Internal Breath Realm being able to fight above their level, even stronger than someone in the Divine Observation Realm.

But over six hundred beast tokens...

Are you here to stock up?

Just as everyone was feeling suspicious and uncertain...

"Isn't that Li Mo?"

Someone shouted.

Instantly, countless eyes focused on him.

"Junior Brother Li, how did you manage to do this?"

Ouyang, the senior brother from Ruyi Peak, was also there. He wasn't particularly close to Li Mo, but he was genuinely curious.

"Do what?"

Li Mo glanced in the direction he was looking and said frankly:

"Do good deeds, and don't ask about the future."

"After I saved others, they gave me all their beast tokens."

In other words.

A significant portion of the people who didn't make it into the top fifty gave their beast tokens to Little Li.

"???"

Everyone looked bewildered.

We were supposed to be in a world of human诡计 (trickery), where everyone schemes and harms each other, fighting to the death by any means necessary.

Are you here to accumulate merit?

The key point is...

Is this actually a valid strategy?

"It seems he took a shortcut," White Shock Hong felt relieved.

When he passed by, he watched Li Mo fight the giant ape for a while.

He's quite厉害 (powerful), but he could have done the same when he was in the Internal Breath Realm. It's strength within the realm of his understanding.

"I wonder what the next trial will be."

"By the way, this is a Secret Realm, so why does it feel like the sect is recruiting disciples with so many trials?"

Li Mo walked over to Ying Bing, looking at the pillar of light that shot straight into the sky and muttered.

"It might be something the Blood Phoenix set up before she died," Ying Bing's gaze was calm.

Anyway, she was certain that the Blood Phoenix Essence was here, and that was enough.

As she was lost in thought.

Li Mo's gaze swept over her face, and he couldn't help but think of the feedback he had just received.

A hot spring...

If the ice lump soaked in it, wouldn't the Mist Flower Ageless Spring freeze over?

Hmm...

"Ying Bing."

"Hmm?"

"Have you ever soaked in a hot spring?"

"?"

Ying Bing's clear, deep eyes trembled slightly.
