# Chapter 42: Raking in Big Money

“Do you sell Grass Reversion Pills?”

In the hidden market, Chen Fei, having changed his appearance once more, approached a stall and tentatively asked.

“Yes, twenty-five taels a piece,” the stall owner said, glancing at Chen Fei with a hint of laziness.

“That expensive?”

Chen Fei was somewhat surprised. He had investigated a couple of days ago, and at that time, they were still twenty taels each. He didn't expect the price to have surged again. Before the rebels arrived, the market price for Grass Reversion Pills was actually only ten taels each.

“Don't complain about the price. You know the situation in Pingyin County now; most elixirs have been handed over. It’s already difficult to have any left over,” the stall owner explained, perking up slightly when he saw Chen Fei didn't just leave after asking.

“That makes sense.”

Chen Fei nodded, a slight smile appearing on his face. “Then do you buy Grass Reversion Pills?”

“You want to sell?”

The stall owner, who had been reclining in his chair, immediately sat upright, looking at Chen Fei. “What’s the quality like? Never mind, quality isn’t important. How much can you supply daily? If the quantity is large, the price is negotiable.”

“I can guarantee twenty to thirty pills a day.”

“Good! If you can guarantee that amount, I’ll give you this price per pill.”

The stall owner made a gesture with his hand. Chen Fei looked at it, then shook his head slightly. “You sell them for twenty-five taels, but you’re only willing to buy them for fifteen taels? That’s too little.”

On the surface, Chen Fei looked regretful, but inwardly, he was ecstatic. Before the rebels arrived, Chen Fei sold Grass Reversion Pills for no more than eight taels each, and he had to acquire the medicinal ingredients himself. Now, the Zhao family provided the ingredients, and the price of Grass Reversion Pills had skyrocketed. All things considered, Chen Fei was practically making a killing.

With Chen Fei’s current Great Perfection skill in refining Grass Reversion Pills, he could sell around twenty-five pills a day in the hidden market, which meant a daily income of five hundred taels of silver. Compared to before, this was a massive leap forward.

“Take a look at the pills. There are about a hundred here.”

Chen Fei took out the medicine bottles from his satchel. The stall owner dared not be negligent. Although he had said he didn't care about quality earlier, if it could be better, it would certainly be more perfect.

As the cork was pulled, a medicinal aroma wafted out. The stall owner carefully poured out one pill, and seeing the smooth, round surface of the Grass Reversion Pill, a smile couldn't help but appear on his face. For Grass Reversion Pills of this standard, the offered price was not a loss. His master would even praise him for his good judgment!

“Here’s your money, keep it safe.”

The stall owner checked the quantity, confirming everything was in order. He quickly counted out the silver and placed it in front of Chen Fei. Two thousand taels of silver, heavy in weight, landed on the counter with a muffled thud.

With that deal concluded, Chen Fei, with a smile, then introduced another topic: “For Light Spirit Pills, would you be interested in purchasing? I was thinking, how about six taels per pill? I quite like that number.”

The stall owner considered for a moment, then agreed. The main reason was that there were only a few alchemists in Pingyin County capable of refining Light Spirit Pills. Even if they wanted to cultivate new ones now, it was too late because medicinal ingredients were too scarce to waste. One portion of medicinal ingredients for one Light Spirit Pill was already not a loss. In the past, this would have been an insane profit, but with the value of ingredients skyrocketing, it could only be said to be decent.

“I’ll take three portions of ingredients for now. I’ll come back to you tomorrow.”

“Alright, please wait a moment.”

The stall owner went to the back room to notify someone to fetch the medicinal ingredients, and also to report the matter. About fifteen minutes later, the ingredients were in Chen Fei’s hands. Chen Fei identified the ingredients, found no issues, cupped his hands to the stall owner, and left the hidden market directly.

Midway, Chen Fei transferred all the silver into his panel, feeling a sense of lightness behind him. The ‘little tail’ he expected didn't appear, which was somewhat surprising to Chen Fei. It seemed the influential family behind the stall owner genuinely wanted to cooperate with Chen Fei. Or perhaps, it was only the first day, and they weren’t in a hurry, wanting to observe further.

Grinding proficiency, watching his strength grow bit by bit, had become an inseparable part of Chen Fei's life now.
