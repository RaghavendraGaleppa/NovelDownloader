# Chapter 33: Pursuit

Zhou Li's eyes widened in terror. Just as he was about to struggle, a sharp pain erupted from his neck. The next moment, his vision went black.

"Ah!" Seeing Zhou Li collapse to the ground, Zhou Shi screamed in fright. But as soon as the sound left his throat, he found his mouth covered by a hand, unable to utter another sound.

"You were the one spying on me during the day, weren't you?" Sun Shu looked down at Zhou Shi, one hand covering Zhou Shi's mouth, the other gripping his neck, pulling him closer.

Zhou Shi's eyes instantly filled with tears. He kicked his legs forcefully, but couldn't break free, only able to watch Sun Shu's face draw closer and closer to his own.

"Every decision has a price, do you understand? Hehehe!" Sun Shu suddenly let out an eerie laugh. The hand gripping Zhou Shi's neck began to constrict. Zhou Shi's eyeballs involuntarily bulged, and the next moment, a mist of blood permeated the dilapidated courtyard.

"The price... the Zhang family..." Sun Shu muttered to himself, releasing his hands. Zhou Shi's corpse fell to the ground.

Outside the courtyard wall, a small figure, peeking through a hole in the wall, witnessed everything that had just unfolded.

Zhao Qi desperately covered his mouth, preventing himself from crying out.

Every day, Zhao Qi would look through this hole at the next-door courtyard. Sometimes, even when the courtyard was empty, Zhao Qi would watch with interest.

But today, Zhao Qi regretted it; he had witnessed a murder.

Chen Fei stood up and walked out, just in time to see a servant speaking agitatedly.

"Manager Chen." Liu Jun was also nearby. Seeing Chen Fei, he quickly stepped forward to greet him.

"What's wrong?"

"Something happened to this servant's family; it seems his family members were killed. He's begging us, hoping the medical hall can advance him some wages."

Chen Fei glanced at the servant. His face was pale and sickly, a clear sign of malnutrition, likely someone recruited from among the refugees.

"Give him this money; it's from me."

Chen Fei took out a few taels of silver, then turned and left. For such matters, this was probably all Chen Fei could do. If he gave more, the servant likely wouldn't be able to keep the money.

After a few steps, Chen Fei heard the servant's tearful gratitude from behind. Chen Fei waved his hand and returned to the alchemy chamber.

Pushing the recent events aside, Chen Fei continued his research on the Light Spirit Pill.

An hour later, Chen Fei rubbed his head, feeling a slight headache; progress was minimal. But this was normal, as reverse-engineering ingredients from a finished pill was an inherently difficult task.

However, Chen Fei found some enjoyment in it, and the overall progress was decent. If he continued to grind away, Chen Fei was confident he could reconstruct the Light Spirit Pill's formula.

Being able to fight above one's realm with a single set of sword techniques demonstrated its excellence. Compared to the inheritances of the aristocratic families within Pingyin County, Chen Fei's sword technique was by no means inferior.

In the medical hall's main lobby, Chen Fei was chatting with a physician, discussing the properties of various medicinal herbs. The Light Spirit Pill had been stuck at a certain point for a long time, and sometimes, discussing herb properties with a physician could spark new ideas for Chen Fei.

As they chatted happily, Zhang Yuezhen appeared inside the medical hall.

"All the guards, follow me. Chen Fei, you come too!"

Zhang Yuezhen called out, and upon seeing Chen Fei in the lobby, she thought for a moment and included him. As someone with at least Skin Refining Realm cultivation, Chen Fei could be considered an asset compared to the defenseless physicians.

Chen Fei's expression stirred slightly. He thought for a moment, then followed behind.
