# Chapter 114: Sect Master Xin Wuyai's Decision of Qingxi Sect

Qingxi Sect, deeper inward from the outer sect, lay the cultivation grounds and residences of the inner sect's true disciples. Most cultivators above the Foundation Establishment stage also resided there. Unlike the individual courtyards in the outer perimeter, the inner sect, apart from a few pavilion buildings, primarily consisted of small hilltops, each home to various cave dwellings.

At this moment, six people were seated inside one of the cave dwellings, which possessed the densest spiritual energy. All were clearly powerful Golden Core realm cultivators. The middle-aged man seated in the center had a fair, beardless face, appearing exceptionally refined. Yet, an uncontainable joy was evident on his face.

"Elders, according to the latest information from a disciple, the spiritual seed in the Spirit Domain is a Wood Spirit Seed. I plan, when the prohibition can be opened three months from now, to organize disciples who cultivate Wood-attribute techniques within the sect to enter. We will use the power of the Five Elements Qiankun Array to seize the spiritual seed in one fell swoop. What do the elders think of this?"

As the middle-aged man finished speaking, a stout old man immediately interjected: "Sect Master, for this spiritual seed, our entire sect has spent decades. Now that we finally have definite news, of course, we must obtain it with all our might. However, with the cultivation of Qi Condensation disciples, to activate this Five Elements Qiankun Array, even with just two people rotating, it would require thousands of people to sustain the rotation. If we add disciples of other attribute techniques, there would naturally be no problem, but entirely Wood-attribute disciples... after years of attrition, I'm afraid it will be difficult to gather a thousand or more Qi Condensation sixth-layer disciples."

"That's right, Sect Master, why don't we just wait a bit longer?" The only female cultivator among them, a silver-haired old woman, chimed in at this moment. "Since we already know it's a Wood Spirit Seed, we can spend some time cultivating more Wood-attribute disciples; we'll see results in a year or two. We've waited decades, so waiting another year or two won't matter."

In Qingxi Sect, the only one who could be called Sect Master was naturally Sect Master Xin Wuyai. This middle-aged man was indeed Xin Wuyai. Hearing their words, the joy on his face receded slightly, and he let out a faint sigh, saying: "Elder Xie, Elder Mu, how could I not wish to wait? But the Shadowfiend Sect outside is like a lingering ghost. And the other six sects in the Qingxia Mountain Range seem to have caught wind of something. During the last joint suppression of the Shadowfiend Sect, they kept probing. I presume it won't be long before they directly exert pressure. What if, by then, the six sects also get involved..."

As soon as Xin Wuyai uttered these words, the elders exchanged glances, and a few more degrees of solemnity appeared on their faces.

"If there aren't enough people, what does the Sect Master intend to do?" The silver-haired old woman, known as Elder Mu, spoke again.

Xin Wuyai's gaze fell upon an old man wearing a red robe.

"This will trouble Elder Gui to personally take action and refine a batch of Breakthrough Pills."

"Breakthrough Pills." Hearing Xin Wuyai's words, everyone's eyes flickered slightly, but no one spoke. This Breakthrough Pill was specifically for Qi Condensation cultivators. After consumption, it could forcibly raise one's cultivation level by one stage, even bypassing bottlenecks. For example, a fifth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator could take it and break through to the sixth layer in a very short time. A sixth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator could also directly enter the late Qi Condensation stage, reaching the seventh layer, after taking it.

However, once one breaks through with the aid of this pill, their cultivation will no longer be able to advance, remaining stuck at that realm for life. This pill was usually only taken by Qi Condensation cultivators who had cultivated for many years without further advancement and felt hopeless in their pursuit of the Dao. Furthermore, this pill was difficult to refine, making it extremely hard for Qi Condensation disciples to obtain. Therefore, Breakthrough Pills were not widely used in the cultivation world. After all, as long as one was a cultivator, who wouldn't hold a glimmer of hope for the Grand Dao before their demise?

At this moment, Xin Wuyai saying he wanted to ask Elder Gui to refine a batch of Breakthrough Pills, his intention was self-evident. Xin Wuyai observed everyone's expressions and slowly spoke, his face remaining as usual: "If it weren't absolutely necessary, I would never let the disciples of my sect have their Dao path cut off. But the spiritual seed is of paramount importance. As long as we can obtain it, our Qingxi Sect will have hope of producing Nascent Soul stage cultivators. For the sake of the sect's overall situation, some disciples must be sacrificed." By the end of his words, Xin Wuyai's tone was extremely resolute.

"The Sect Master's words are correct." A dark-faced old man on the right side spoke coldly. "Someone always has to sacrifice. It's just that their cultivation won't advance, right? So many disciples perished when they entered the Spirit Domain before."

Xin Wuyai nodded towards the dark-faced old man, then swept his gaze over the other elders again, and spoke once more: "Since that's the case, this matter is settled. For now, we won't publicize it. Three months from now, all inner, outer, and miscellaneous disciples who cultivate Wood-attribute techniques, those at the sixth layer and above, will directly enter. All fifth-layer Qi Condensation cultivators will take a Breakthrough Pill and enter the Spirit Domain together. At that time, I will also trouble all elders to reopen the prohibition together." After speaking, Xin Wuyai's gaze turned to the grey-robed old man named Gui. "Elder Gui, this matter is of great importance. Please, Elder Gui, personally refine the Breakthrough Pills, to prevent any leaks."

***

At Yanji Market, Chu Ning's breakthrough to the eighth layer of Qi Condensation was naturally unknown to anyone. He still maintained the appearance of a fifth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator.

The next day, market day, Chu Ning opened his shop as usual. By afternoon, Chu Ning was preparing to head to the spirit field. Gu Xiaoqing, however, came knocking. Recently, Du Han had stopped pestering her, evidently because the idea Chu Ning gave Gu Xiaoqing last time had worked. Thus, Gu Xiaoqing had also returned to her usual gentle and refined demeanor.

"Junior Brother Chu, some of the pills you left with me last time were quite niche. They only sold out completely today." As Gu Xiaoqing spoke, she took a bag of spirit stones from her storage pouch and placed it on the table. "They sold for a total of 620 spirit stones. Junior Brother, please count them."

"Thank you, Senior Sister Gu." Chu Ning casually put the bag of spirit stones into his storage pouch. Then he took out several Flowing Light Ice Shield Talismans from his storage pouch and handed them to Gu Xiaoqing, saying: "Thank you, Senior Sister, for going to such trouble. Last time I returned to the sect, I brought out some high-grade primary talismans from the Spirit Talisman Pavilion, but their sales in this market aren't high. If Senior Sister doesn't mind, please take a few to use."

Gu Xiaoqing, however, shook her head and said, "I cultivate and refine pills here every day and don't go out. These talismans are of no use to me. Junior Brother should keep them for sale. I see that Yanji Market is growing larger and larger, so these high-grade primary talismans will definitely sell more."

Seeing that Gu Xiaoqing wouldn't accept them, Chu Ning could only give up. These high-grade primary talismans could indeed sell for some money in the market now, but a few pieces a day was still too little for Chu Ning. To cultivate his Soul Refining Technique, he hadn't made any fewer talismans during this period. He had a large pile of these high-grade primary talismans in his storage pouch. Of course, this was not something he could tell Gu Xiaoqing. Just then, Lu Miaoying, who was nearby, also finished putting away her things, and the two of them started chatting.

After Gu Xiaoqing left, Chu Ning looked at the sky and decided not to go to the spirit field after all. After cultivating in the evening, Chu Ning thought for a moment and, instead of rushing to rest, pulled out a pile of talismans from his storage pouch.

"Even though I've intentionally controlled the production of high-grade primary talismans during this period, I've still accumulated over a thousand sheets after several months. It seems necessary to make a trip to Yunhai Pavilion in Fengxia Market." Chu Ning muttered to himself. Besides selling the talismans he had, Chu Ning also had some other needs. Thinking of this, Chu Ning looked at the Black-Sky Iron Soulwood sword in his hand. Over the past year or two, Chu Ning's proficiency in the Soul Refining Technique had been continuously increasing, besides his regular cultivation and talisman crafting. The wood essence energy from this Black-Sky Iron Soulwood had certainly contributed greatly. However, as Chu Ning cultivated, the black wooden sword's color was now far less dark than it originally was.

Although Chu Ning couldn't directly sense how much wood essence energy remained inside, from the change in color, Chu Ning felt that it wouldn't support his cultivation for much longer. Although items that aid in the growth of spiritual sense were hard to come by, Chu Ning still planned to try his luck at Yunhai Pavilion. This was also to prepare in advance. At the same time, Chu Ning also wanted to inquire if there was any news about the subsequent cultivation methods for the Soul Refining Technique. After all, according to Chu Ning's current cultivation progress, his Soul Refining Technique would be perfected at the first layer in less than three months, allowing him to begin cultivating the second layer.

With this thought, Chu Ning still made up his mind to make the trip. Although the journey to Fengxia Market wasn't short, there hadn't been any recent news of Shadowfiend Sect disciples being sighted. Furthermore, Chu Ning felt that going alone would be less conspicuous, so he believed there wouldn't be much risk. In fact, it would be safer if he could go with Lin Changqing. However, Chu Ning's current trip to Yunhai Pavilion involved too large a spirit stone transaction, coupled with many secrets, making it inconvenient to go with Lin Changqing.

So, early the next morning, Chu Ning left the market and headed towards the spirit field as usual. However, he didn't linger in the spirit field. After just a quick look to confirm there were no abnormalities, he left the spirit field, used a Shapeshifting spell to change his appearance, and departed on the wind. After walking some distance further, essentially leaving the vicinity of Yanji Market, only then did Chu Ning take out his Wind Chasing Shuttle from his storage pouch and flew towards Fengxia Market. After all, he wasn't sure if anyone else would recognize his Wind Chasing Shuttle, so it was better to be cautious.

The journey was uneventful. Chu Ning's Wind Chasing Shuttle was fast, so in just about an hour, Chu Ning had already arrived at Fengxia Market. Upon entering the market, Chu Ning didn't linger, heading straight for Yunhai Pavilion. The items he wanted to trade now could only be handled by large establishments like Yunhai Pavilion and Fengxia Pavilion; other smaller shops wouldn't be able to support such transactions.

Chu Ning entered Yunhai Pavilion, and a server proactively stepped forward to greet him. Chu Ning casually took out a jade token. "Please help me check how many spirit stones are in this jade token and take them all out." This jade token was obtained from Old Man Sun's storage pouch. Before, Chu Ning had no idea what it was for. So, he hadn't brought it with him on his last visit to this market.

"Fellow Daoist, please follow me." The server didn't ask further, directly leading Chu Ning to a circular device. Then, pointing to one of the grooves, he said to Chu Ning: "Fellow Daoist, place the jade token on top. You can then view the number of spirit stones inside directly, just like reading a jade slip."

After Chu Ning arrived, he roughly understood that this circular device should be something that temporarily lifts the restrictions on a jade token. Immediately, he placed the jade token inside. Indeed, the restrictions within the jade token were gone, and Chu Ning could clearly sense the information inside.

"One thousand one hundred thirty spirit stones." When he saw the recorded number of spirit stones inside, Chu Ning felt a slight disappointment. "It seems Old Man Sun indeed had over five thousand spirit stones after selling the Seven-Star Spirit Fruits and other items. But he must have used quite a bit later, now only a little over a thousand remain." However, on second thought, Chu Ning felt relieved. After all, it was all obtained for free. In fact, the truly good item he obtained from Old Man Sun back then should have been that dark, small knife. Although Chu Ning had always kept it as his trump card and hadn't truly used it yet, its existence gave Chu Ning a certain confidence.

Turning around, Chu Ning said to the server, "Please convert all my spirit stones."

"Alright, Fellow Daoist, do you wish to exchange for all low-grade spirit stones, or for mid-grade spirit stones?" The server asked at this moment.

Mid-grade spirit stones? Chu Ning's heart stirred upon hearing this. According to the conversion method in the cultivation world, one mid-grade spirit stone was equivalent to 100 low-grade spirit stones. His purpose for coming this time was actually to see if he could exchange for some mid-grade spirit stones to use. Besides being fewer in number and easier to store, Chu Ning also wanted to see if the spiritual energy from mid-grade spirit stones would be absorbed faster by him. Unexpectedly, the server took the initiative to suggest it. It was clear that having a jade token identity indeed allowed for different treatment at Yunhai Pavilion.

Thinking this, Chu Ning said to the server, "Exchange them all for mid-grade spirit stones. Any remainder, for low-grade spirit stones."

"Fellow Daoist, please wait a moment." Saying so, the server left with Chu Ning's jade token. A short while later, the server returned, holding a round tray. On it were two types of spirit stones of different sizes. There were eleven of the slightly larger ones, and thirty of the common low-grade spirit stones.

"These are mid-grade spirit stones." Chu Ning's gaze swept over them, and he muttered to himself. Then, without a change in expression, he put both types of spirit stones from the tray, as well as the jade token, into his storage pouch. Without saying anything further, Chu Ning directly turned and exited Yunhai Pavilion. Finding an unoccupied spot, Chu Ning forcefully crushed the jade token. Although this jade token had restrictions, it was mainly to prevent others from viewing information and had no other function. So, with Chu Ning's squeeze, it instantly shattered.

At this moment, Chu Ning used the Shapeshifting spell again to change his figure and appearance, transforming into a middle-aged man. This appearance was the same one he used when he last came to Yunhai Pavilion to sell talismans. It was then that Chu Ning returned to Yunhai Pavilion. When Chu Ning displayed his jade token and mentioned that the female cultivator surnamed Zhang was familiar with him from last time, he was quickly led back to the room where the female cultivator surnamed Zhang was in charge. The reason he sought her out again was that for talismans and such, the prices had already been agreed upon, making it more convenient.

The female cultivator surnamed Zhang indeed recognized Chu Ning. Upon seeing him, she immediately opened her mouth with a smile: "Fellow Daoist Li, we meet again."

Chu Ning nodded noncommittally, maintaining his previous lukewarm demeanor. The female cultivator surnamed Zhang showed no embarrassment because of this, and continued to smile: "Fellow Daoist Li, have you come this time to sell something, or to buy something?"

"I've brought some talismans," Chu Ning said, taking out stacks of talismans from his storage pouch. This time, Chu Ning didn't bring any mid-grade primary talismans; he brought only high-grade primary talismans. After all, the demand for mid-grade primary talismans in Yanji Market wasn't small during this period, and Chu Ning generally produced them according to sales volume. In comparison, the output ratio of these high-grade primary talismans was undoubtedly higher.

"That's wonderful!" A gleam of light flashed in the eyes of the female cultivator surnamed Zhang. "The talismans Fellow Daoist left here last time were very popular. The seniors in the pavilion have been scolding me for not having Fellow Daoist stay as a guest talisman master. I've been looking forward to Fellow Daoist coming back to sell more talismans." The female cultivator surnamed Zhang spoke words that Chu Ning didn't know were true or false; he just listened casually and didn't take them seriously. For him, obtaining real spirit stones was what truly mattered.

When Chu Ning placed several stacks of talismans in front of the female cultivator surnamed Zhang, a look of surprise finally appeared on her face. "Four hundred Blazing Flame Talismans, four hundred Cloud Soaring Talismans, and five hundred fifty Flowing Light Ice Shield Talismans." The female cultivator surnamed Zhang quickly counted the quantity and then sought confirmation from Chu Ning. After Chu Ning confirmed they were correct, she continued: "As for the price, we'll use the same price we gave Fellow Daoist last time. Blazing Flame Talismans and Cloud Soaring Talismans are 17 spirit stones each, and Flowing Light Ice Shield Talismans are 22 spirit stones each. Together, that's twenty-five thousand seven hundred spirit stones." The female cultivator surnamed Zhang quoted a slightly astonishing figure. Chu Ning couldn't help but feel a hint of joy in his heart. Although he had many treasures on him at the moment, this was the first time he had so many spirit stones.

Chu Ning also didn't forget that he still had one thousand spirit stones in his own spirit stone jade token. Adding the one thousand one hundred spirit stones he just took from Old Man Sun's jade token, and some other spirit stones on him, the total was almost enough to reach the threshold of thirty thousand spirit stones. "Perhaps within the sect, my amount of spirit stones is definitely not small."

While Chu Ning was turning these thoughts in his mind, the female cultivator surnamed Zhang had already spoken again: "Fellow Daoist, do you wish to purchase anything else?"

Chu Ning nodded. Of course, he wanted to buy things; he couldn't spend so many spirit stones all by himself. "I wonder if your esteemed pavilion currently has any treasures or medicines that strengthen spiritual sense? I have an elder who wishes to purchase such an item."

"Treasures that strengthen spiritual sense?" The female cultivator surnamed Zhang seemed a bit surprised upon hearing Chu Ning's words. However, hearing Chu Ning say it was for an elder, she didn't ask further. She merely showed an apologetic expression to Chu Ning and said: "Fellow Daoist, these spiritual sense strengthening medicines are primarily used by Foundation Establishment stage seniors. I truly don't have the authority to view them here. How about Fellow Daoist waiting a moment while I send a message to inquire with other seniors in the pavilion?"

Chu Ning nodded, not at all surprised by this. Within Yunhai Pavilion, there should indeed be different levels with different authorities. The female cultivator surnamed Zhang, with her seventh-layer Qi Condensation cultivation, should primarily be responsible for receiving late Qi Condensation cultivators. Cultivators of this level indeed do not require spiritual sense strengthening treasures. Then, the female cultivator surnamed Zhang took out a transmission talisman, but she didn't rush to send the message. Instead, she said to Chu Ning: "Fellow Daoist, would you like to mention other items? If there are other treasures I don't have authority for, I can inquire about them together."

Chu Ning thought for a moment, then shook his head, saying: "Let's ask about this first." Although he had quite a few spirit stones on hand now, items related to spiritual sense were likely to be expensive. He still wanted to first see if they had any before considering other things.

Seeing Chu Ning say this, the female cultivator surnamed Zhang nodded and then sent out the transmission talisman. In just a short while, a transmission talisman returned to the female cultivator surnamed Zhang's hand. Along with it, a small jade box also arrived on the round tray. Holding the transmission talisman, the woman listened for a moment, then looked up and said to Chu Ning: "Fellow Daoist Li, I truly apologize, but spiritual herbs and treasures that strengthen spiritual sense are extremely rare. Our pavilion temporarily does not have any. However, our pavilion currently does have an item related to spiritual sense. I wonder if Fellow Daoist would be interested."
