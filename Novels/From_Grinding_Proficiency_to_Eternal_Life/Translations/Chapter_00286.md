# Chapter 286: Putting on a Show

In an instant, the four men’s bodies stiffened slightly. Under the suppression of his aura, it felt as if mountains were weighing down on them, making each of them unbearably heavy.

How is this possible?!

The disciple from the Xuanxiao Peak at the forefront had his pupils constrict violently as he looked at Xu Yunfan in utter disbelief.

“Make way.”

Two simple words struck like a heavy hammer.

The leader’s finger, which had been pressing down on his sword hilt, suddenly froze. His knuckles turned white from the excessive force, yet he couldn't draw the sword even half an inch.

As if pressed down by an invisible hand, the four men unconsciously stepped aside to create a path.

He paused briefly at the stair landing and, without looking back, tossed out a sentence. “According to the sect rules…”

The scales of the Dragon Scale Armor clanged like jade striking gold. “You should address me as Senior Brother.”

The spiritual fruit in the purple-robed disciple’s hand had long been crushed into a pulp. Scarlet juice dripped through his fingers, reflecting a distorted reflection on the cold jade floor.

This scene naturally attracted the attention of many below.

When Xu Yunfan’s aura of the Marrow Cleansing realm spread out like a tide, those probing gazes instantly recoiled as if struck by lightning, one after another lowering their heads to avoid him.

The bloodline pressure of a Marrow Cleansing Grandmaster was enough to suppress an entire peak even within the Dao Sect of Qingwei Mountain.

Several muffled groans came from the crowd, and a few disciples with shallow cultivation were even sent stumbling back by this aura.

The originally whispering discussions came to an abrupt halt, as if their throats had been seized by an invisible hand.

Only the true disciples on the level of the Thirty-Six Peaks' Dao Children could still hold their heads high, but their eyes carried a hint of gravity. Those known as Dao Children, even if they had not reached the Marrow Cleansing realm, were virtually guaranteed to enter it.

However, Xu Yunfan looked far too young compared to them.

Xu Yunfan ascended the stairs step by step. The gazes behind him, filled with either shock or wariness, receded like a tide.

Wherever he passed, disciples on every level lowered their heads and made way, not daring to utter a word of provocation.

He walked steadily, passing straight through the vast sea of books on the first eight layers until he stepped onto the green jade steps of the ninth layer.

The moment he pushed open the gilded, cloud-patterned door, what rushed toward him was not the scent of ink, but a rich, overwhelming spiritual energy.

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows slightly. It turned out that the gathered spiritual energy had converged on the ninth layer.

The top of the nine-story pavilion was actually a starry sky. A diagram of the celestial stars carved from a single piece of meteorite jade hung overhead, with thirty-six silver threads descending from the positions of the Twenty-Eight Mansions, each thread tied to a mere thirty-odd volumes of classics.

Xu Yunfan casually brushed aside a curtain blocking his path and took a volume from the jade stand.

The cover was written in cursive script with vermilion mixed with gold powder: *Great Sun Burning Sky Hell Crushing Fist*.

What an imposing name.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but curl his lips.

Flipping to the preface and reading the general principles, he realized it was an overbearing fist technique that required using blood energy as a guide to fuse with pure yang energy. Unfortunately, it ran counter to his path of weaponry, so he placed it back in its original spot.

Moreover, the name exceeded the reality.

The fist techniques recorded inside were indeed exquisite, following the pure yang path, but it had nothing to do with a "burning sky." It was unknown which undignified elder of the Dao Sect gave it such a name.

The collections on the ninth layer were mostly fundamental techniques pointing directly to the nine realms of Qi Refining, such as *Purple Thunder Sutra* and *Grand Blue Mystery诀*. Martial skills made up less than a tenth.

After all, in the current era of martial arts, most people cultivate their bodies while simultaneously honing corresponding martial skills. Every time they cross a realm, they can use matching techniques.

Pure martial skills are relatively rare. Xu Yunfan wasn't surprised. He had plenty of time; if he wanted to, he could stay here for ten days without eating or drinking.

Finally, at noon the next day, Xu Yunfan found a rare manuscript in the west corner, *Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall Cane Method*, pressed down by an iron paperweight.

The pages were made from the tanned leather of an unknown beast. The opening eight characters—"The cane falls, mountains sink, power penetrates the Eight Wastelands"—faintly exuded the lingering might of the creator who once shattered a mountain with a single cane strike.

Finally, he found a cane technique...

Xu Yunfan's brow relaxed slightly. He glanced at the bookshelf beside him; among the ten martial skills on it, at least eight were sword techniques.

He couldn't help but be a bit speechless. He had plenty of time. If possible, he could even stay here for ten days without eating or drinking.
