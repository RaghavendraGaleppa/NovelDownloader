# Chapter 73: The Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven

Entering the Dao Academy, Zhang Jing didn't hesitate for a moment. He immediately directed Deer Thirty-Eight to fly toward Luodu Island.

This time, he encountered no obstacles along the way—a lesson well learned from his previous experience in Langya City. Of course, this was also because they were currently within the Dao Academy's territory. No one would believe any demon or monster would dare trespass here!

Before long, they arrived before a familiar cave abode. Zhang Jing took out his jade key, deactivated the restrictions, and opened the massive bronze doors.

"We're here, Thirty-Eight. Are you sure you want to stay outside? Should I build you a shed?" Zhang Jing asked with an amused smile.

Behind him, Deer Thirty-Eight suddenly grew nervous. "Master, this... this is where you live?!" The deer stared wide-eyed at the enormous bronze doors that could easily accommodate its massive frame. It seemed it had underestimated its master.

After a moment's thought, however, it realized this made perfect sense. Its master had effortlessly slain that terrifyingly powerful human while only at mid Qi Refinement stage—a feat that defied all logic. Surely, in a place like the Dao Academy filled with powerful cultivators, its master must be someone extraordinary. And given how ruthless and cunning he could be...

Yes, Deer Thirty-Eight decided, it was only natural its master lived in such grandeur.

Snapping out of its thoughts, the deer broke into a simple, honest grin. "Master, what do you mean staying outside? I don't recall saying that! I'm your most loyal mount, after all."

"Another virtue discovered—thick-skinned as they come," Zhang Jing mused internally before stepping inside. "Come in."

"Right away, Master!" Deer Thirty-Eight happily followed, but the moment it entered, it froze in place, staring in disbelief at the cave abode filled with spiritual energy so dense it had condensed into mist. For a moment, the deer thought it must be dreaming.

"Mother of heavens, what kind of divine place is this?!" it exclaimed in awe, immediately forgetting all nostalgia for its old cave dwelling.

Zhang Jing then gave Deer Thirty-Eight a tour of the incredibly spacious spirit beast quarters and the spirit herb cultivation room. Throughout the tour, the deer kept exclaiming in wonder, repeatedly shouting, "Thirty-Seven! I've brought honor to the Deer family name!"

Zhang Jing couldn't help but chuckle. He decided it was time to give Thirty-Eight some proper ambitions.

"Thirty-Eight," Zhang Jing said seriously after some thought, "I've been observing your performance these past days. As long as you work hard, not only will I prepare a body transformation technique for you, but I'll also provide a cultivation method suited to you—one that will increase your cultivation speed dozens of times over!"

"You enjoy growing spirit herbs, don't you? In the future, I'll prepare an entire island dedicated to herb cultivation for you. We'll set up dozens of spirit-gathering formations until the spiritual energy becomes so dense you wouldn't dare imagine it!"

"And when I ascend to immortality, you'll be an immortal's mount—second only to me, above countless other spirit beasts. You'll have your pick of any doe in the world. No—by then, you'll be spoiled for choice among immortal does!"

"Work hard, and you'll break the thirty-eight generations of single-line inheritance in your family. You might want to start thinking of names for your future offspring now—'Deer Ten-Thousand' doesn't sound very elegant."

"Don't worry, Master! I'll think of good names and work hard!" Deer Thirty-Eight panted excitedly, nodding vigorously, its large eyes shining with anticipation. Its master was incredible—he wouldn't lie about such things!

This meant—"Herb island... immortal mount... immortal does... Deer Ten-Thousand... hehehehe~"

"Rest here for now, and don't wander off," Zhang Jing instructed as he prepared to leave, though he wasn't entirely confident the deer would listen. Thirty-Eight was already lost in the grand future he'd just described, grinning foolishly to itself.

Zhang Jing shook his head. Surely it would know better than to cause trouble.

Without further delay, Zhang Jing left the cave abode and headed straight for Luodu Tower.

At the center of Luodu Island stood a small hill only a few dozen zhang tall. At its peak sat the mysterious Luodu Tower—the meeting place for the captains of Luodu Squad.

From the outside, the tower appeared to be an ordinary three-story stone structure covered in moss and vines, blending seamlessly with its surroundings. It lacked the usual grandeur of immortal abodes but exuded a natural, harmonious aura.

On the third floor, by the window, stood a handsome man in his early thirties wearing a jade crane crown. The faint wrinkles at the corners of his eyes and the trace of vicissitude in his gaze betrayed that he was older than he appeared.

Following his gaze, one could see a young figure in blue robes rapidly approaching the tower.

"Zhang Jing," the man mused. "Two months in the Dao Academy, already at the fifth level of Qi Refinement. His talent for talisman crafting is monstrous—currently achieving a thirty to forty percent success rate with mid-grade talismans, possibly higher."

A faint smile played on his lips. "The Plague God... quite an interesting little fellow."

His voice took on a teasing tone as he continued, "With sixteen months remaining, it's worth a gamble. If this succeeds, Luodu Squad's standing in the eyes of the Inner Court and even the Pavilion Master will rise significantly."

"It's been too long since our squad's ranking moved up. What does it matter if they're A-rank? What if the Inner Court seniors favor them? Even without an A-rank prodigy, our Luodu Squad will have a genius of equal caliber participating in the legendary Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven this time!"

Zhang Jing's appearance had given him hope.

In a quiet chamber on the first floor, the soothing scent of calming incense filled the air.

"Please have a seat, Junior Brother Zhang," said the man from the window, now seated on a cushion.

"Thank you, Senior Brother Li," Zhang Jing replied respectfully before sitting opposite him.

"I must apologize for only meeting you now, over a month after you joined Luodu Squad. I hope you won't hold it against me," Senior Brother Li said with a warm smile.

"As captain, you must be extremely busy. It's completely understandable," Zhang Jing responded politely.

To Zhang Jing's senses, Senior Brother Li's aura was terrifyingly powerful—far surpassing even that of Senior Brother Li from before, who was also at the tenth level of Qi Refinement. They seemed to exist on entirely different levels.

"Do you know why I summoned you, junior brother?"

"Might it be regarding talismans?" Zhang Jing ventured.

"Yes, and no." Senior Brother Li's expression grew profound. "Please enlighten me, senior brother."

"Of course, I wouldn't call you here without full disclosure. But first—" Senior Brother Li's gaze suddenly sharpened, as if piercing straight into Zhang Jing's soul, "answer me one question."

"Please ask, senior brother." Zhang Jing met his gaze unflinchingly.

"If provided with sufficient resources, can you reach the tenth level of Qi Refinement within fifteen months?" Senior Brother Li asked, enunciating each word clearly.

Zhang Jing fell silent. The question was unexpected. Why would someone of Senior Brother Li's stature ask something that sounded so absurd? Yet he instinctively sensed this was profoundly important.

After a moment's consideration, Zhang Jing nodded firmly. "This junior can do it."

"Are you certain?" Senior Brother Li's voice turned grave, his gaze like sharpened blades.

An oppressive aura suddenly filled the room, as if countless mountains had descended upon Zhang Jing's shoulders. His bones creaked under the immense pressure, and beads of sweat instantly formed on his forehead. Yet his expression remained unchanged, his gaze as steady as ever.

"Absolutely certain," Zhang Jing ground out through the pressure.

The moment the words left his mouth, the pressure vanished.

"Excellent!" Senior Brother Li laughed heartily. "I believe you, junior brother. In that case, there's no need for further hesitation. If the Inner Court has any objections, I'll bear full responsibility!"

"Senior brother, what do you mean?" Zhang Jing asked, confused.

"Junior brother, have you heard of the upcoming opening of the Myriad Gods' Minor Void Heaven?" Senior Brother Li's expression turned solemn.
