# Chapter 37: The Scent in the Blood  

"How is it, Qianqian? Can he be saved?"  

In the inner chamber of the palace, Lu Qianqian worked meticulously over the injured boy, one hand controlling a sphere of water while the other wielded silver needles, performing an intricate procedure.  

Zhengyuan, the Buddhist cultivator from the Cihang Temple, possessed terrifying physical strength. Even a single punch from him would leave Jiang Li—a man with thick skin and tough flesh—in considerable pain.  

Though Zhengyuan had held back, it was already a stroke of immense luck that this ordinary boy had managed to cling to life, even temporarily.  

"It's hard to say right now," Lu Qianqian replied, beads of sweat forming on her forehead. "I'm using the Springwater Technique to stabilize his condition while suturing his internal organs and reconnecting his broken bones with silver needles and catgut. But his injuries are too severe—his chances of pulling through are slim, less than ten percent."  

Seeing her exhaustion, Yu Banxia stepped forward and carefully wiped her brow with a white cloth.  

"Do what you can, but don't overexert your spiritual energy."  

Yu Banxia clearly had little interest in saving the boy. Had Zhengyuan not left behind a bottle of pills and instructed them to help, they might have given up long ago.  

"This bottle of Jade Bone Regeneration Pills contains only three pills. It's impossible to divide them equally among the eight of us."  

"In terms of market value, a high-grade Yellow-tier pill usually costs ten spirit stones each. But since these three haven't been appraised for quality or efficacy, their price would be discounted if sold."  

"So, if anyone needs them, they can purchase them at eight spirit stones per pill. The spirit stones will then be distributed among the rest. If no one wants them, we'll sell them upon returning to the sect and split the proceeds."  

With that, Yu Banxia produced the bottle Zhengyuan had given them. A light shake confirmed there weren't many pills inside.  

He didn’t try to claim an extra share despite his higher cultivation level. His proposed distribution was fair, suggesting he valued this circle of new disciples and intended to nurture it further.  

"That's fair. If no one objects, I'll take the Jade Bone Regeneration Pills. Here are twenty-one spirit stones."  

Originally, it would have been twenty-four stones, but since Jiang Li was one of the eight, he only needed to pay the other seven members three stones each.  

Jiang Li had always been the type who couldn't resist pills, and this was no exception. Among the group, only Yu Banxia was well-off; the others likely couldn’t afford the cost. Thus, the high-grade Yellow-tier Jade Bone Regeneration Pills fell into Jiang Li’s hands.  

"Jiang Li, how did you earn so many spirit stones? Tell us what kind of missions you've been taking in the task zone!"  

The others were astonished by Jiang Li's lavish spending. They had thought themselves relatively wealthy among the new outer disciples after completing their last mission smoothly, but Jiang Li had quietly surpassed them.  

"It's nothing much. The Crimson-Haired Elder from the Alchemy Hall took a liking to me, so I became his nominal disciple. I just help out occasionally and earn some spirit stones on the side."  

He showed them his nominal disciple token, drawing envious looks. Even a nominal disciple assisting with pill refinement was still a nominal disciple—who would know the truth unless he told them?  

"Jiang Li, you actually have alchemical talent!"  

"To become a nominal disciple of an Alchemy Hall elder so soon after joining—you're amazing!"  

"Jiang Li! Brother Jiang! We'll have to rely on you from now on!"  

"Jiang Li, why didn’t you say so earlier? Congratulations!"  

As expected, the moment he revealed his nominal disciple status, their attitudes toward him became even friendlier.  

Jiang Li received the same treatment Yu Banxia had when he broke through to the mid-stage of Qi Refinement a few days prior. The flattery was almost identical, making both Jiang Li and Yu Banxia slightly uncomfortable.  

"Alchemy is a profession that consumes a lot of spirit stones. Right now, I'm just an assistant doing odd jobs—I'm still far from refining pills myself."  

After deflecting the topic with a few modest words, Jiang Li steered the conversation elsewhere.  

---  

"*Whew*, finally done. I never thought saving a mortal would exhaust me this much."  

Lu Qianqian finished her treatment. The boy, who had been nearly unrecognizable, was now pieced back together—a testament to her skill.  

"But what do we do now?"  

"While treating him, I examined his entire body. There’s no poison or other injuries. I still can’t figure out why they’re comatose."  

"Sorry, everyone. I’ve let you down this time."  

As their last hope, Lu Qianqian sounded dejected.  

Disappointment was inevitable, but since none of them had contributed, how could they blame her?  

"Don’t say that, Qianqian. It’s not your fault. Besides, we haven’t reached a conclusion yet."  

"I think this coma might be related to the demon’s emergence. Maybe if we wait until other cultivators eliminate it, these children will wake up on their own."  

Yu Banxia, clearly smitten with Lu Qianqian, was quick to comfort her.  

---  

"Qianqian, didn’t you say the child’s blood had a strange scent earlier?"  

Jiang Li interrupted their moment with an untimely question.  

"Yes, but I didn’t find any toxins in the blood."  

"I even tested it on animals—it didn’t put them to sleep."  

Lu Qianqian had already ruled out the anomaly as harmless.  

"Does *his* blood have the same scent?" Jiang Li pressed.  

"No... Well, actually, his blood has a different strange scent."  

After a pause, Lu Qianqian elaborated.  

"I tested the blood of all these children with silver needles. Each had a unique scent not found in ordinary people."  

"But I don’t think it’s significant. The cultivation world is vast—regional and climatic differences can create huge variations among people."  

"That scent might just be unique to the children of Yinnan Kingdom. It doesn’t explain anything."  

"Jiang Li, do you still think this is why they’re comatose?"  

Lu Qianqian considered Jiang Li a complete amateur in medicine. After all, human skin, eyes, and hair came in all colors—a slight scent difference meant little.  

"No, I’m not sure what caused their coma. But don’t you think his survival is too miraculous?"  

"What are the odds of a mortal child surviving a strike from a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator?"  

"What if he survived not by chance?"  

With that, Jiang Li pulled out a crystal from his pocket and placed it in the injured boy’s hand.  

Moments later, a faint, mist-like glow emanated from the crystal.
