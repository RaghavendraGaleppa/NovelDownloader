# Chapter 33: The Cloudcliff Shell Fields

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, nearly half a month had passed.

Inside the quiet chamber of the cave abode, the floor was strewn with shattered jade powder. A scorching aura lingered incessantly, as if countless sharp arrows were slicing through the void, bringing with them a sense of deadly solemnity.

Gu Yuan sat with his eyes closed, rapidly condensing his spiritual energy. With lightning speed, his mana surged toward a faintly discernible seal script floating in the air.

*Clang!*

The sound of a golden arrowhead rang out, as if a bowstring had been plucked in the void, sending ripples through the air.

"Finally, success!"

A crimson seal took form, its fiery patterns spreading endlessly, dense and intricate, exuding an overwhelming aura of violence.

Seeing this, a look of joy finally appeared on Gu Yuan's face.

After half a month of meticulous study and the consumption of twenty shadow tablets, the *Miyuan Command Arrow Seal* had been successfully refined.

Merely hovering in the air, the seal radiated waves of scorching heat, like a blazing furnace, raising the temperature of the entire cave abode. The spiritual energy in the void seemed eager to rush into the seal.

"Now I have a trump card!"

Gu Yuan smiled in satisfaction. With a thought, the *Miyuan Command Arrow Seal* swiftly descended into his dantian.

Within his dantian, translucent mana swirled like mist, and amidst this mist, six seals of varying colors floated, each emitting a faint glow.

"Six seals—offensive and defensive—coupled with the spiritual sense I gained from consuming the Spirit Dragon Heavenly Water, should be enough to establish my footing."

Gu Yuan exhaled deeply, as if expelling all the fatigue accumulated over the past days.

*Relying on others' power is not as reliable as relying on oneself.*

Though he could temporarily avoid oppression by leveraging the influence of the Golden Core elders and the sect's laws, nothing was as secure as his own strength. This gradual growth in power was the most gratifying feeling.

"However, it's time to find a way to enhance my cultivation."

Surveying the cluttered cave abode, Gu Yuan murmured to himself before waving his hand. The formation activated, sweeping away all dust and debris in an instant, restoring the cave to its pristine and tranquil state.

While seals were important, cultivation was the foundation.

Over the past month, Gu Yuan had focused solely on refining seals, neglecting his cultivation progress, remaining stagnant at the fifth layer of Qi Refining. But this was all part of his plan.

With his innate talent, relentless cultivation alone would only leave him mediocre among the masses. To make significant strides, he needed alternative methods.

In truth, what Gu Yuan had hoped to find in the Scripture Transmission Hall was not seals but a "Body Seal" capable of altering one's innate aptitude. Unfortunately, he had found nothing.

But fortunately, Gu Yuan had other means.

Though the outcome was uncertain, he couldn't resign himself without trying.

"The stone liquid has fully replenished. This time, I'll use cultivation as an opportunity to see if I can find a suitable chance."

With a flip of his palm, a bluish-gray stone vial appeared in his hand. A gentle shake produced the sound of liquid sloshing within.

The stone liquid was Gu Yuan's greatest reliance.

*Clang!*

*Clang!*

*Clang!*

Just as Gu Yuan was about to pour out the stone liquid, three resonant bell chimes echoed through the cave abode, their golden and jade-like tones reverberating in all directions.

"This is… the Golden Bell and Jade Chime of the Hidden Dragon Academy?"

Gu Yuan frowned slightly.

In the Dao Academy, disciples were generally left to their own devices, with minimal oversight. However, as a major sect with laws and regulations, there were still constraints in place. The Golden Bell and Jade Chime were one such measure.

The Golden Bell and Jade Chime was a unique artifact of the Hidden Dragon Academy. Once sounded, it would awaken all cultivators on the three islands, summoning them to the Hidden Dragon Hall. It was typically used only for major events.

The last time it had rung was fifteen years ago.

"Could another significant event be happening?"

At the Qi Refining stage, Gu Yuan had no desire to act; he only wished to cultivate in peace. After all, at the fifth layer of Qi Refining, he was still a minor figure who needed more time to develop.

But the sect's laws were absolute. Once the Golden Bell and Jade Chime sounded, attendance was mandatory.

With no other choice, Gu Yuan reluctantly stored the stone vial, mounted his Cloud-Treading Shuttle, and flew toward the Hidden Dragon Hall.

---

The Hidden Dragon Hall was located on Golden Origin Island, the most spiritually abundant of the three islands. At this moment, the sun was just rising in the east, casting its radiant glow across the sky. Countless streaks of light, trailing spiritual energy, raced toward the hall, creating a spectacular sight.

A rough estimate put the number at several hundred, all clad in azure robes, exuding an air of distinction.

As he watched the ever-increasing number of streaks of light around him, Gu Yuan couldn't help but marvel.

"Truly the grandeur of a major sect. A single toll of the bell summons a thousand streaks of light—what boldness!"

Though the Hidden Dragon Academy consisted solely of Qi Refining disciples, its foundation far surpassed that of minor sects like the Verdant Wood Sect.

The plaza before the Hidden Dragon Hall was vast enough to accommodate thousands.

Gu Yuan found a corner, landed his shuttle, and looked ahead.

After a long while, when no more streaks of light appeared, a middle-aged Daoist clad in white robes stepped out before the Hidden Dragon Academy. His expression was stern, and a vertical golden mark adorned his forehead, shimmering with an eerie light that sent chills down the spine.

Having perused the academy's records in the Scripture Pavilion, Gu Yuan recognized this man.

He was Zhou Qisheng, the dean of the Hidden Dragon Academy, also known as the Golden Light Daoist, a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator of humble origins.

Zhou Qisheng swept his gaze over the dense crowd of Hidden Dragon disciples before speaking coldly:

"The Golden Bell and Jade Chime tolls only for significant events."

"Let it be known that upstream of the Nine Rivers Great Marsh, in the Crimson Moon Great River, the Azurefire Golden-Eyed Ape tribe has occupied our academy's Cloudcliff Shell Fields for nearly a millennium. Out of compassion for the hardships of demonic cultivation, our academy has never sought to reclaim it. Yet, these creatures have grown increasingly brazen, now attempting to descend the river and seize our Stardust Shell Fields."

"These beings fear power, not virtue. Thus, by the decree of the academy, disciples of the Hidden Dragon Academy shall board the Dragonfang Treasure Ship, cross the river, and reclaim the Cloudcliff Shell Fields."

Here, Zhou Qisheng paused meaningfully before adding, "The academy desires only the shell fields."

His words immediately stirred a commotion among the disciples.

Zhou Qisheng made no effort to quell the discussion, allowing the disciples to debate freely.

"The Cloudcliff Shell Fields? Weren't those originally the territory of the Azurefire Golden-Eyed Apes?"

"Indeed. According to the *Records of the Eastern Mountains Domain*, the Eastern Mountains house nine great rivers, each home to an aquatic tribe that dominates a treasure land, exerting influence over ninety thousand li. The Azurefire Golden-Eyed Apes have dwelled in the Crimson Moon Great River for millennia."

"Strictly speaking, the Nine Rivers Great Marsh, where our academy resides, is formed by the convergence of these nine rivers. In truth, we are the outsiders."

Some disciples well-versed in regional records voiced their thoughts.

But almost immediately, someone scoffed:

"Pedantic fools!"

"Treasures of the world belong to those with the virtue to claim them!"

"Do you not realize why the Cloudcliff Shell Fields were never mentioned for a thousand years, only to be brought up now?"

"Have you forgotten the blood rain from days past?"

At these words, the surroundings fell silent.

The dimming sun, the weeping heavens, the mountainous thunder, the lamentations of all living beings—the fall of a True Dragon!

Could this be the ripple effect of that event?
