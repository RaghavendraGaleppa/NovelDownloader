# Chapter 240: Kongming Sword Cleansing Art

"Impressive. As a Warden of the Sword Pavilion, you are indeed well-informed. Until now, I still don't know where I came from."

Qi Huan let out a dry, rasping chuckle. He was naturally aware of this, but seeing Pei Yan mention it without reservation, the tone carried a hint of impoliteness.

He couldn't beat Xu Yunfan, but against Pei Yan in his current state, he felt he had a certain degree of confidence.

Qi Huan deliberately exposed his broken fangs. "But Brother Pei, your Profound Origin Energy seems unable to suppress the flood dragon venom anymore?"

The岩 cave suddenly fell into a dead silence.

The few of them spoke no more.

After finally stabilizing the injuries within his body, Pei Yan let out a long exhalation.

"Thank you!"

Pei Yan finally responded. It was gratitude for the two of them not taking advantage of his peril, as well as for the rescue. His expression still carried a trace of sorrow as he thanked them.

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan naturally understood why the other party carried such sorrow.

"It seems your hunt for the flood dragon failed."

Pei Yan slowly sat up and said calmly, "There were ninety-six Sword Pavilion disciples who entered the秘境 (Secret Realm). To围杀 (encircle and kill) the evil dragon, we were反噬 (counter-attacked) instead. Now, I am left alone. The flood dragon venom has浸入 (seeped into) my body; I fear my days are numbered. I can only wait for the Sword Pavilion's Grand Elder to wield a divine weapon again, using the method of gathering heaven and earth to locate the evil dragon and behead it to lay a foundation for the disciples."

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows. He naturally understood the meaning behind Pei Yan's words.

It was both a statement of fact and a warning.

The Sword Pavilion was the leading sect in the Jiangnan Dao.

The Great Zhou had six major Dao, but only Jiangnan and Yujing Dao were prosperous in economy and culture. As the leader of Jiangnan Dao, the Sword Pavilion's strength was among the top two even within the six major sects.

Otherwise, as a Sword Pavilion disciple, how could he have been allowed to participate in the various sects' martial demonstrations of the Xuanzhen Sect in Lingnan Dao, and obtain a ranking to bring disciples into the Secret Realm?

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but find it absurd. A spot that others could only hope for but never obtain, Pei Yan actually used his status as a Sword Pavilion Warden to forcefully bring nearly a hundred Sword Pavilion disciples into the Small World Secret Realm.

However, for the Xuanzhen Sect to allow this, there must have been some underhanded dealings, which Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to guess.

At this moment, he didn't answer Pei Yan's words. His eyes were fixed on Pei Yan, making the latter feel somewhat creeped out.

Pei Yan's expression remained unchanged, but his gradually tensing body indicated that his mood had tightened to the extreme.

Qi Huan beside him was silently scooting his butt back a few steps.

If a fight broke out, he would definitely have to help; otherwise, once Xu Yunfan had a free hand to settle accounts, he would die without a doubt.

After a long while, Xu Yunfan's leaning body slowly straightened up.

He said indifferently, "Brother Pei, how about we make a deal?"

Pei Yan maintained his composure. "I am all ears."

"I have a precious medicine that can help you remove the flood dragon venom from your body."

"What do you want?"

"I lack a martial art to enter the Ninth Realm. The martial art I cultivate is the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art. Cultivating it to the extreme perfection can only reach the Marrow Cleansing Realm. The subsequent Viscera Refining Realm is a blank; I can only seek other methods."

After a pause, Xu Yunfan's fingertips tapped lightly on his knee, and the岩 cave echoed with a rhythmic *tap-tap* sound.

He suddenly leaned forward, the campfire leaping in his eyes into two golden points.

"When I brought Brother Pei here, I discovered a place of earthfire thirty miles away that can burn the flood dragon venom somewhat. If Brother Pei were to price the Kongming Sword Cleansing Art..."

Pei Yan's expression changed drastically, his composure finally breaking as he refused outright.

"Impossible. The Kongming Sword Cleansing Art is the foundation of the Sword Pavilion's establishment. Its口诀 (mantras) are inscribed on the Heaven-Bearing Sword Stele in the Ancestral Master Hall. Not to mention that I haven't received the true transmission, even if the Sect Master were to come in person... This art is a secret method of the Sword Pavilion for the Viscera Refining Realm; I have no way to impart it. Furthermore, this Viscera Refining method is a method passed down exclusively by the Sect Master; I haven't acquired it either."

Xu Yunfan casually poked the fire, the exploding sparks illuminating the smile at the corner of his mouth.

"I heard that three years ago at the Jiangnan Dao Heroes' Banquet, your sect's Elder Lingxu, while drunk, said that among the contemporary disciples, only Brother Pei has received the secret of 'Sword Qi Walking the Three Jiaos'. At the time, it caused quite a stir, comparing you to the Holy Maiden of the Tian Shu Gate, saying you could cultivate a strand of Sword Qi right at the Outer Three Combinations."

Pei Yan's heart shuddered, and he almost couldn't suppress the injuries in his body. A fishy sweetness churned in his throat. In a daze, he saw the flowing silver patterns on the Heaven-Bearing Sword Stele again.

He suddenly remembered that night of pouring rain. He had knelt before the stele for seven days and seven nights before catching a glimpse of the first key to the "Kongming Sword Cleansing": the lungs and viscera as the sheath, the meridians as the path; one must refine the five viscera and six bowels into vessels for nurturing Qi.

When perfected, every breath would carry a whistling sound. Even a single falling hair could cut through gold and jade.

The Great Zhou's six major sects each had their own emphasized methods for every realm.

For example, the Dao Sect's Pure Yang One Qi Art could perfectly fuse the power of muscles, bones, and skin into one furnace.

The Nine耀 Sect's Nine耀 Swallowing Qi Art for the Blood Transformation Realm, the Amitabha Sect's Meridian Cleansing and Marrow Washing Art for the Marrow Cleansing Realm...

And within the Sword Pavilion, the Kongming Sword Cleansing Art in the Viscera Refining Realm could be said to be unrivaled under heaven.

Once the Kongming Sword Cleansing Art is perfected, the lungs and viscera, along with the meridians, all transform into channels for containing Qi. It could even trace back the body's realm, allowing one to re-practice the Nine Realms.

This martial art could be said to be a work of divine creation, incredibly miraculous.

Three hundred years ago, the one known as the Heaven Sword, Dugu Qiu, brought the Kongming Sword Cleansing Art to the perfection realm and suppressed the world. To break through the shackles of the Ninth Realm, he叛出 (defected from) the Sword Pavilion and forcefully抢了 (snatched) the strongest methods for each realm from the six major Dao of the Great Zhou, after which he vanished without a trace.

There are rumors in the martial world that the one who confronted the female demon witch in Yujing City that day was the former Heaven Sword, Dugu Qiu.

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan didn't insist. Looking at Pei Yan's fluctuating expression, he just smiled faintly.

"Brother Pei, think it over. This Small World Secret Realm is now full of crises. As time passes, our vital blood Qi will attract many demons and monsters to come.

Your sect has yet to tear open the Secret Realm and send people in; you must be obstructed by something. Brother Pei needs to consider this carefully. In your current state, it's hard to survive."

Xu Yunfan finished speaking and said no more. He left Pei Yan and Qi Huan behind and picked up the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer to start practicing his hammer art.

As the wild game over the campfire roasted and emitted a spicy aroma, Pei Yan, whose expression was wavering, suddenly saw roasted meat on a stick being handed to him.

"Eat some first. After all, you need strength to recover. With your current state, without the divine armor on your body, you might die of suffocation in a breath. This wild game is also a strange beast; although the essence Qi it contains isn't comparable to demons and monsters, it's much better than ordinary wild game."

Pei Yan fell silent for a moment, propped himself up to sit, and took the roasted meat.

"Thank you, Brother Qi."

His mind was wandering. Looking at Xu Yunfan practicing his hammer art not far away, he casually put the roasted meat into his mouth and chewed. His eyes suddenly widened in surprise.

"Brother Qi, this roasted meat tastes quite good. I've been with you for so long but never realized you had this skill."

Qi Huan shrugged. "It's not me. The spices on this roasted meat were all gathered casually by Xu... Junior Brother Xu along the way. I was only responsible for the heat."

The heat control was actually taught by Xu Yunfan; otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to roast it well. In fact, he was beaten up by Xu Yunfan before he succeeded in learning it.
