# Chapter 47: The Enforcement Hall Comes Knocking

The first step in cultivating the Divine Refinement Technique was sensing spiritual consciousness.  

For Foundation Establishment cultivators, this was basic skill. But for Qi Refinement stage cultivators like Chu Ning, it wasn't so easy.  

Fortunately, Chu Ning had already tested his spiritual consciousness strength yesterday, making today's attempt somewhat familiar.  

As he focused his entire mind on his Muddy Pellet Palace, the surroundings suddenly became utterly silent. He could clearly sense every blade of grass and tree around him.  

At the location of his Muddy Pellet Palace, an intangible energy was slowly rotating—this was the state of Divine Refinement cultivation.  

After an unknown amount of time, Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes.  

He immediately checked the changes in his proficiency. The Divine Refinement Technique cultivated spiritual consciousness, different from his previous Qi Refinement and Body Refinement. He wondered if proficiency would appear.  

Sure enough, there was now a proficiency for the Divine Refinement Technique:  

[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Grade Low Tier), Second Layer (244/900)]  
[Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, First Volume, Unbreakable Bones 2/600]  
[Divine Refinement Technique, First Layer 0/1000]  

"The Divine Refinement Technique truly isn't simple. My spiritual consciousness is twice as strong as an ordinary cultivator's, yet a whole night of cultivation didn't increase the proficiency at all."  

According to the technique's records, when the intangible energy in the Muddy Pellet Palace condensed into liquid droplets through cultivation, it would signify true mastery. At that point, one could release spiritual consciousness outward.  

As cultivation deepened and the droplets grew stronger, the range of spiritual consciousness would expand further.  

After a night of cultivation, Chu Ning didn't detect any signs of his spiritual consciousness liquefying. Even the flow of energy showed little change. Clearly, this would be a long-term process.  

But after some thought, Chu Ning accepted this. Spiritual consciousness was inherently the most difficult aspect for cultivators to refine. Otherwise, Qi Refinement cultivators wouldn't struggle to even grasp it—only Foundation Establishment cultivators could sense, cultivate, and use it.  

Qi Chongmao, for instance, had likely cultivated for many years and had only just reached the first layer of the Divine Refinement Technique.  

Now, Chu Ning began pondering another question: the pattern behind the proficiency system.  

From his recent cultivation experiences, spells couldn't be displayed, nor could they yield rewards. Currently, the only things that appeared were the Evergreen Wood Technique, Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, and Divine Refinement Technique—corresponding to Qi Refinement, Body Refinement, and Divine Refinement.  

This realization made Chu Ning thoughtful.  

He then recalled the rewards from previous proficiency completions.  

For Qi Refinement, he had obtained the Yin Wood Spirit Body and Talisman Source Spirit Body.  

For the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art's first volume, completing the Indestructible Skin realm had granted the innate divine ability, Heavenly Fist—a secret technique inherent to the art.  

If this pattern held, then completing the Unbreakable Bones realm would likely grant a similar innate divine ability.  

As for the Divine Refinement Technique's first layer, would the reward be a spiritual consciousness-related innate ability? Or perhaps directly transform the Phantom Spike into an innate divine ability?  

With this line of thought, Chu Ning felt he had vaguely deciphered the rules of his golden finger's refresh mechanism, filling him with anticipation.  

However, for now, it seemed unlikely he would achieve breakthroughs in Qi Refinement, Body Refinement, or Divine Refinement anytime soon—a fact that left him slightly disheartened.  

Still, cultivation and duties continued as usual.  

Chu Ning meticulously tended to his Dark Spirit Bamboo and Purple Vine Grass daily, accumulating harvests for the season. In the blink of an eye, half a month passed.  

During this time, his fastest progress was in the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art. The Unbreakable Bones realm's proficiency had surged to 50 in just half a month.  

But in recent days, perhaps due to exhausting the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit's medicinal effects, his Body Refinement progress had slowed to normal.  

As the time to deliver talisman paper to Mu Ling approached again, Chu Ning prepared to visit the market.  

On one hand, he needed to maintain the appearance of purchasing talisman paper there. On the other, he planned to buy more talismans.  

His stock had nearly depleted during the fight with Qi Chongmao. After two battles, Chu Ning increasingly recognized the importance of talismans—especially since his spell repertoire was still limited and their power weak.  

Talismans were vital for survival.  

Speaking of talismans, Chu Ning felt slightly frustrated. Despite possessing the Talisman Source Spirit Body for over half a year, he had only worked with talisman paper production so far. The art of talisman-making remained out of reach.  

He considered exploring other avenues to learn talisman-making after this harvest season. Otherwise, his talent would go to waste.  

After all, talismans sold for much higher prices than plain talisman paper.  

Storing his belongings in his storage pouch, Chu Ning stepped out of his courtyard—only to freeze in his tracks.  

At the same moment, he saw several figures emerging from the neighboring courtyard.  

Aside from Zhuang Yunde, whom he recognized, the others were unfamiliar. Yet their cultivation levels all seemed higher than Zhuang Yunde's—especially the stern-looking middle-aged man leading them, who was a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Chu Ning's heart tightened, but his face showed only curiosity.  

Zhuang Yunde spotted Chu Ning and spoke first, "Chu Ning, perfect timing. We were just coming to see you. This is Enforcement Hall's Elder Zhang."  

Chu Ning immediately cupped his hands and bowed slightly. "Greetings, Elder Zhang and fellow senior brothers."  

Elder Zhang didn't respond, only fixing Chu Ning with a piercing gaze that seemed to see right through him.  

An immense pressure bore down on Chu Ning, sending chills down his spine. Fortunately, Elder Zhang soon withdrew his gaze slightly.  

As the pressure lessened, Elder Zhang's cold voice rang out:  

"Have you seen Qi Chongmao recently?"  

"Senior Brother Qi?" Chu Ning feigned slight confusion. "It's been a while since I last saw him."  

Elder Zhang pressed on, "When was the last time you saw him? Did you notice anything unusual?"  

After a moment's thought, Chu Ning replied, "Perhaps half a month ago? We exchanged greetings outside the courtyard. I don't recall the exact day, and nothing seemed amiss."  

Elder Zhang snorted. "You live right next to each other, with adjacent spirit fields. How could you not check on him after so many days?"  

Chu Ning adopted a flustered expression, stammering, "This disciple has only recently joined the sect and spends most time tending the Dark Spirit Bamboo fields. I rarely interacted with Senior Brother Qi and truly didn't notice."  

"Elder Zhang," Zhuang Yunde interjected, "Chu Ning has been here just over a year, managing five acres of premium Ding-tier spirit fields. He truly is occupied there most days."  

Elder Zhang finally looked away from Chu Ning, though he shot Zhuang Yunde a displeased glance.  

"Your Spirit Plantation Hall can't even keep track of its own outer disciples. Pathetic management."  

With that, Elder Zhang turned and left, his robes fluttering, leaving Chu Ning and Zhuang Yunde behind.  

Watching the Enforcement Hall members depart, Chu Ning quietly exhaled in relief.
