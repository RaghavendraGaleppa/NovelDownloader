Chapter 327: Master and Disciple Estranged, Jingchun Falls Ill, and Li Xian Wins Her Heart

The Daoist Master Jingchun’s original name was Zhao Chunxia. Due to a momentary misjudgment, she was framed by He Wentian and forcibly branded a murderer. She should have been beheaded and displayed to the public, but instead, she was secretly transported to this place and imprisoned in a stone cave within the cliff wall, never to see the light of day again.

Only now did she realize He Wentian’s cunning, but it was too late for regret. Although Zhao Chunxia was captured and trapped, she remained tenacious and calm. "What a He Wentian," she thought. "I trusted his reputation, which allowed him to harm me. If he didn't kill me on the spot, then if I find an opportunity, I will surely ruin his reputation!"

She comforted Ji Hui with her eyes and transmitted her voice: "Stay calm. Your master is waiting for the right moment to find a way to escape!" Ji Hui was greatly comforted, thinking vaguely: "Master is extremely capable. As long as she is here, I can be at ease."

For the first three days, Zhao Chunxia combined her knowledge to search for flaws in the stone cave and planned an escape route. She probed the cultivation level and capabilities of her captors. Her heart sank, but she remained calm and adaptable. She felt that although this matter was difficult, it was not hopeless.

"Where there is a will, there is a way. Although I am shackled, my internal energy is sealed, and my capabilities are less than one-tenth of what they were, I still have some means to struggle. Although this stone prison is solid, if I can get out of this situation, then find a way to break the shackles, restore my state, and use my means to struggle, I can naturally resolve the crisis."

Zhao Chunxia sat calmly, her face slightly pale, her long hair flowing. She was elegant and beautiful, untainted by the slightest dust, calm as usual. The cave room was narrow and dark, but it could not hide her beauty.

Many of the cave rooms in the mountain walls were dug out of the cliffs. There were no roads to pass through, only iron chains hanging from above. Daily meals, supervision... everything was handled by servants who climbed the chains to deliver food to each cave room.

On the fourth day.

Zhao Chunxia had observed for several days and felt confident. She sensed that the time was ripe and waited quietly for a servant to climb the chain to the outside of the cave room. She prepared to use the "Sound of Viewing Spring as Self," a martial art derived from the "Viewing Spring Treasure Canon Health Cultivation." Paired with the celestial sound and chest drum thunder sound... it did not require internal energy to assist. It could confuse the enemy invisibly. The so-called "Viewing Spring as Self" meant that those hit by this martial art would, for a moment, feel as if their 'self' was not their self, but rather Zhao Chunxia. Their thoughts would naturally be for the benefit of "Zhao Chunxia."

If in a duel with swords, an enemy was hit by this celestial sound, "I" would no longer be "I," but Zhao Chunxia, while the real Zhao Chunxia was standing opposite. This feeling was extremely bizarre. Who would be willing to hold a sword and slash at "themselves"? Naturally, they would be timid and confused. Sometimes they would slash off-target, afraid of hurting "themselves." Sometimes they would actively run into the sword, leading to defeat.

Applying it here now, it could make the meal delivery servant feel "I am not I." Seeing "himself" trapped in the cave room, he would naturally find a way to help "himself" escape.

This plan was originally feasible. The servant, hit by this strange art, immediately tried to help.

However, the one guarding the dark gorge was named Zheng Dechun. He had a slender waist, a long face, a short nose, thin eyebrows, and large eyes, looking neither male nor female. He possessed the [Heavy Yin Physique], making him a hermaphrodite. He was not easily fooled and immediately sensed something was wrong. With a single palm strike, he killed the servant.

Zhao Chunxia’s face turned as cold as frost. "Truly birds of a feather. In terms of despicable behavior, you are from the same school!" Zheng Dechun laughed, his voice sharp and thin: "Thank you for the compliment. I will go get the锁骨琵琶链 (Lute Bone Chain). You had better behave yourself. Otherwise, this great tool will be used on your dear disciple."

Zhao Chunxia was unwilling, but concerned for her disciple's life, she had no choice but to endure the humiliation and accept the torture. The Lute Bone Chain had four sharp hooks, two large and two small, terrifyingly sharp. The two large hooks pierced through her lute bones from her back. The two small hooks pierced through her ankles. The chains extended and were locked to the four corners of the cave wall. Zhao Chunxia endured the pain without a word, but her heart fell into an ice pit. She felt that escape was even more difficult now. When the iron gate slammed shut, she was in a daze and couldn't react for a moment.

She suppressed the pain and assessed her physical condition. The Lute Bone Chain locked her bones, strength, and energy. She secretly played the "Sound of Viewing Spring as Self." The bones vibrated, which inevitably pulled at the lute bones. The pain was unbearable, and cold sweat broke out. Moreover, the celestial sound was transmitted through the bones. The Lute Bone Chain was connected to the bones, passing through them, and instantly导出 (guided out) the celestial sound.

The Lute Bone Chain also possessed the strange effect of "dissolving bones." If worn for a long time, the iron chain would dissolve into the bones and merge with the wearer, making it impossible to separate.

When Zhao Chunxia played the celestial sound, the Lute Bone Chain would "clang" and vibrate. This immediately attracted the guards' attention. Her methods were no longer usable, and her ankles were pierced. Although she could walk, it was absurd to think of stepping out of the cave room.

Ji Hui looked over, her gaze filled with concern and panic. Zhao Chunxia couldn't bear to see her disciple frightened and desperate, so she pretended to be fine and nodded calmly. However, she felt that hope was slim, and her mind was also in a state of panic.

Two more days passed like this. A servant climbed the chain to the outside of the black iron gate and ordered her to stick out a finger. Zhao Chunxia was unwilling to obey, but the situation was irreversible. The servant pricked her finger, used energy to force out blood, and filled a jade bottle.

Zhao Chunxia suddenly understood: "He Wentian went to great lengths to trick me and capture me here. It turns out he wants a continuous supply of blood." She tried to move her body and let out a muffled groan. Her bones and muscles ached terribly. She was helpless.

By evening, the sky was gray, and the surroundings were as silent as nothingness. Occasionally, a cool breeze blew.

Daoist Master Jingchun’s face was filled with sorrow, her beautiful face covered in worry. She thought: "I come from a sword sect. In my life, I have always taken it as my duty to eliminate evil and kill demons. I practiced quietly, and the 'Viewing Spring Treasure Canon' gradually achieved some success. I thought I had seen through all the principles of the world. The Yue Shan Sword Sect is large and influential, and conflicts are inevitable. I was unwilling to participate, so I chose another precious mountain. I spent my days viewing and appreciating the spring, calling myself Daoist Master Jingchun. This time I entered the world, but I didn't know I would be harmed by a treacherous person. I am suffering, but I have also dragged my disciple Ji Hui into this misfortune. The most pitiable one is my disciple Wang Long. He... he is not a woman. He must be... dead."

The cave room was dug out of the cliff face, suspended in mid-air. It was simple and crude inside. There was a wooden bed, a meditation cushion, and nothing else. The entrance was sealed with a black iron gate. It was no more than three steps across, with no extra space. Zhao Chunxia had been trapped for a long time and rarely moved. At noon every day, when the sun shone into the gorge, she could enjoy a moment of sunlight.

Zhao Chunxia’s lute bones had been pierced, with sharp spikes protruding from the front of her shoulders. Blood had stained the back of her clothes, but it had already scabbed over. She sat still, gazing at the opposite cliff face.

This dark gorge had two sides of cliffs, cut like knives and axes, facing and enclosing each other. It was a combination of nature's creation and human craftsmanship. There were nearly a hundred stone caves in the opposite cliff, and the women living there shared similar fates.

Her disciple Ji Hui was here. Ji Hui’s cultivation was shallow, so her lute bones were not pierced. But she was also in despair, with no way out. From time to time, she looked over with pleas, desperately hoping for her master to save her.

Every time Zhao Chunxia saw her disciple's gaze, her heart felt all kinds of discomfort. She thought: "My disciple, my disciple. Your master's lute bones are pierced. My internal energy is difficult to use, the celestial sound is difficult to play, and my ankles are pierced. This time, I really can't even save myself. If... if no one comes to rescue us, my whole life... my whole life will be confined to this three-step room, allowing people to exploit and take from me, like a fish or meat waiting to be cut up. If it were possible, your master would risk her life to save you out. Unfortunately, your master really... really... Heaven have pity. Whoever saves my master and disciple from this predicament, I, Zhao Chunxia, am willing to... Ah!"

She felt hopeless again. Her mind turned over and over, but her face remained calm. She nodded slightly to Ji Hui, pretending to be calm, and transmitted her voice: "Wait for the right opportunity." Ji Hui looked at her with vague eyes. Seeing her master calm and steady, she believed it and took the opportunity to rest.

Zhao Chunxia’s pretty face was pale. She averted her gaze and looked at other cave rooms. In the upper斜处 (slanted direction), there was a stone cave imprisoning the "Autumn Water Ten Thousand Falling Sword" Hong Qiushui. The two had some acquaintance. Hong Qiushui was a famous female knight-errant in the martial world, with very strong strength and ability. She had also suffered the same misfortune, trapped here for an unknown reason, her lute bones pierced.

"What exactly is He Wentian's conspiracy?" she wondered. "Trapping us here, spending energy to keep us alive, and taking our blood. What is it for? Is he planning to take our blood until our lives run out?"

Zhao Chunxia couldn't help but feel terrified. She knew He Wentian was cunning and meticulous. This place was dark and lightless, remote and gloomy. There were strong enemies guarding the outside, and stone gates blocking the way. It was almost hopeless to get free.

Although she was extremely good at cultivating her mind and body, after being deceived, framed, and imprisoned... her heart was filled with gloom. Living such a muddled life, several more days passed. Every day at noon, when the sunlight shone in, Ji Hui would definitely cast her gaze, filled with vague expectation. Even though Zhao Chunxia was in despair, she would comfort her with her eyes. But it became more and more forced. She had lost her calm and felt extreme self-blame. Every time she met Ji Hui's gaze, she felt immense guilt. She thought that the fate of the master and disciple was entirely due to her own pedantic harm. She didn't know how to face it.

Ji Hui was able to persist, but Zhao Chunxia felt even more depressed.

On the eighth day of her imprisonment.

Today, as their eyes met, Zhao Chunxia’s stomach churned, and she suddenly felt nauseous and dizzy. Her emotions had accumulated, and actually allowed external evil to invade, causing a sudden severe illness.

Zhao Chunxia’s strength and methods were not shallow. She guarded the women and kept the surroundings in good order. Seeing that Zhao Chunxia was unwell, she twisted her hips, held the iron chain, and used lightness skill to reach the outside of the cave room.

Zhao Chunxia’s voice was sharp and thin: "Oh, oh, so you're sick. As long as you're not pretending to be a ghost and preparing to escape, that's fine. This is a life-preserving pill. Take it quickly. If you die, your poor disciple will be miserable." She leaped down.

She lived comfortably, having built a tall building in the gorge. In front of the building were a pond and a courtyard... She was leisurely and elegant all day. Everyone wished they could swallow her alive. Daoist Master Jingchun had suddenly fallen seriously ill and was physically weak. Everyone's situation was miserable, and no one had the heart to comfort her. Only Ji Hui was extremely panicked.

Daoist Master Jingchun only wished to die of illness right there, but she thought of her disciple Ji Hui. She picked up the life-preserving pill and took it. Although her condition didn't improve, her life was safe for the time being. Zhao Chunxia immediately cast a calm gaze to soothe Ji Hui's panic.

At this point, she was just barely holding on. Ji Hui began to suspect: "Wait for the right opportunity. Until when will the right opportunity come? Is Master already... she's just comforting me? This... this... doesn't it mean I'll have to live out my life in this dark room?"

On the tenth day, the gorge path was suddenly very lively. A group of servants carried dozens of wooden boxes. Opening the boxes, they were all women. Judging from their attire, they were all from sword sects.

The women were all unconscious, hidden in wooden boxes and secretly transported here. Zhao Chunxia saw several friendly elders from the Yue Shan Sword Sect. Her face turned pale, and her pupils shook.

The women were all imprisoned in various cave rooms. Those with higher cultivation levels had their lute bones pierced while unconscious. Zhao Chunxia was extremely shocked and said through gritted teeth: "I recognize several sword sect elders. That He Wentian is incredibly audacious. He... he has actually captured all the women of my sword sect? Has the Five Sword Alliance been secretly wiped out by him? To capture women, he has gone this far? Is he not afraid of the sword sects joining forces to hunt him down?"

She had already felt hopeless, and seeing this scene, she was even more in despair. Her eyes were moved, and she could no longer pretend to be calm. When the women woke up, curses rang out one after another. But it was all useless. She was too weak to speak.

In her state of mind being greatly shattered, the illness invaded her body even deeper. Her life was not in danger, but her physical condition worsened. On the twelfth day, she was completely unconscious for a whole day. When she woke up again, she sensed that Ji Hui's gaze had changed, filled with despair, panic, and a hint of blame.

Zhao Chunxia "ah"ed, wanting to speak but stopping.

It turned out that Ji Hui had long sensed something was wrong, but she deceived herself, firmly believing that her master had the ability to save her. But yesterday, Zhao Chunxia was unconscious all day, which showed she was at her wit's end and her life was in danger. Ji Hui could no longer deceive herself and felt despair and panic. Recalling all the experiences, it was all due to her master's confidence. As a disciple, her master taught her the way, imparted knowledge, and resolved doubts. She shouldn't blame her. But natural emotions are like this; how can they be completely reasonable?

Zhao Chunxia looked at her disciple and saw Ji Hui's gaze avoiding her and hiding back in the depths of the cave room. She sighed softly: "If I hadn't trusted He Wentian so easily, how could I have ended up in this situation. Ji Hui is so young, and she is trapped here. Naturally... she naturally blames me."

In the following days, Ji Hui avoided her and wouldn't see her. Zhao Chunxia felt even more self-blame. Her heart-sickness was difficult to heal, and her physical illness became worse. She coughed from time to time and felt even more numb and muddle-headed. She no longer asked about outside matters. She didn't even know when the servant delivering food had been changed. One day, while eating, she suddenly saw a note hidden in the rice grains. Her hands and feet were weak, but she managed to unfold the note and look at it.

The handwriting inside was bold and strong, likely from a young man. She hadn't seen anything from the outside for a long time and couldn't help but be curious. The note had few words but a shocking meaning. It read: "I am hiding among the贼厮 (thieving servants), waiting for an opportunity to act."

Zhao Chunxia's gaze flickered between light and dark. She was happy for a moment, but then immediately frowned. "I have empty martial arts skills, have cultivated quietly for many years, and easily trusted others, leading to this end. I should have learned my lesson. This note is probably... another trick by them to play with me!"

She didn't believe it at all, but there was a vague hope in her heart. She couldn't help but observe the handwriting. The brushwork was still immature, but there was a unique charm between the ink strokes. She couldn't help but think again: "The one who wrote this is young. Which young man is this? Writing such sharp characters. Is he perhaps a disciple of my sword sect? Seeing the writing is like seeing the person. Whether this person is real or fake, I can find out by looking at his writing more."

Her mood was somewhat different. By evening, the servant brought food again. She ate calmly but observed for any notes. This time, she was disappointed. She felt extremely lost and gave a self-mocking smile.

The next morning, there was another note in the food. She felt a little joy inside, unfolded it, and saw three words written first: "Eat first."

Zhao Chunxia was stunned, hid the note, ate quietly to fool the inspectors, and then unfolded the note to read: "Healing the illness comes first, the body is most important. For now, put aside distracting thoughts."

Zhao Chunxia was stunned, feeling an inexplicable emotion. The words actually carried a sense of care and concern, as if a warm current was flowing through her. She pondered: "When have I, Zhao Chunxia, ever been cared for by others? Now I am being cared for by a mysterious young man. This feeling is really strange. Well, well... the body is most important. First, preserve myself, then I can find a turning point."

Zhao Chunxia was gloomy and despondent, but she was not weak-willed. It was just that being trapped alone and worried, combined with self-blame, and having no outlet for her various emotions, her mind was greatly damaged. At this time, the words of others were especially important.

Zhao Chunxia, with nothing to do, looked at the writing again. Each character's start was plain, but the ending was sharp and revealing. Zhao Chunxia suddenly thought: "Who is this young man? Just from the style of the writing, this person seems quite steady. His brushwork is shallow, but he is very young, which shows his cultivation is not bad. His characters have traces of 'Liu Yuzhi' of the Great Yu dynasty. He must practice copying calligraphy models diligently every day, but he doesn't lose his own style."

"Back in the past at Jingchun Mountain, I often gave calligraphy models of sages for Wang Long and Ji Hui to copy. Wang Long was a bit steadier, but he had no interest in the Dao. Ji Hui was lively and mischievous, and even more so..."

She couldn't help but appreciate it. Zhao Chunxia had a unique understanding of "calligraphy" and felt even more curious. Her emotions shifted, and her illness actually eased. She waited quietly until noon, when lunch was delivered. She indeed saw another note and couldn't help but feel a secret joy. A smile finally appeared on her face.

The note read: "There is a healing pill inside. Take it to nourish your body. There is a strand of hair hidden in the food. Plant the hair in the ground. Whisper to the hair, and I will be able to hear. We can then communicate through notes."

Zhao Chunxia indeed found a strand of hair in the food. She picked it up and hid it in her sleeve. She ate and finished the food calmly, then gave the bowl and chopsticks to the servant to take away. Occasionally, there were cries from the mountain walls. Women with strong personalities would bang on the iron gates violently. They were never quiet.

Zhao Chunxia got out of bed. She took two steps inward and suddenly felt a pull at her shoulders and ankles. It was very painful. She bent down and planted the hair in the ground. She saw the hair touch the ground and take root. It was truly marvelous.

Noon had passed, and the slanting sun had set. The cave room was dim and gloomy. Zhao Chunxia was both surprised and curious. She whispered: "You... who are you?" She wanted to ask more, but seeing that the hair had taken root but had no ears or eyes... to say it could transmit sound was absurd. She thought she might be dizzy and hallucinating.

So she didn't talk in detail. She lay quietly on the bed, took out the note, and studied it. Her mood was indescribably agitated. In the evening, the dishes were delivered. Zhao Chunxia was both happy and worried. She found the note and opened it: "Eat first."

Zhao Chunxia's eyes showed a strange look. She thought: "Strange, strange. When I was in my glory days, no one cared for me. After falling into such a境地 (situation), someone is now instructing and caring for me." She ate the food honestly, then unfolded the note.

It read: "My name is Li Xian. I have come specifically to save you. Your disciple Wang Long is safe and sound and living peacefully. If you have anything to say, you can tell the hair. There is no need to be shy."

Zhao Chunxia was stunned. Seeing "Wang Long is safe and sound," her mind was slightly relieved, and she couldn't help but feel happy. Seeing the four characters "My name is Li Xian," a strange light flickered in her eyes. She murmured: "Li Xian? Is there such a young talent in my sword sect? What does he look like, what is his bearing... Have I seen him? He has come specifically to save me... Is it that Wang Long asked for help?" With many questions, she thought of the content of the note and poured it out to the hair.

Daoist Master Jingchun was originally a person of few words and a quiet nature. But this time, she asked many questions, her mind active. The feeling of being昏沉 (muddle-headed) and in despair was slightly eliminated. Zhao Chunxia waited until late at night. Her pretty face suddenly turned red as she realized she had talked too much. She returned to bed and lay down, but felt that this night was incredibly long.

The next day, the servant delivering food climbed the chain and brought the dishes. Zhao Chunxia opened the note and saw: "Eat first, calm your mind, don't be anxious." Zhao Chunxia's face turned red, thinking of her loss of composure last night. She whispered about various matters. If the hair could transmit sound, that "Li Xian" must have heard. So at the beginning of the note, he特意 (特意) wrote the words "calm your mind, don't be anxious."

Zhao Chunxia ate honestly, pretended to sleep, secretly unfolded the note, and looked at the content: "The reason for the matter is inconvenient to explain in detail. Wang Long is safe and sound. I am not from the sword sect. I came specifically to save you because... I admire your beauty, Senior. I will save you first, so that I can see your beauty in the future. Haha."

Zhao Chunxia was not angry but happy. She had a初步 (initial) understanding of Li Xian and thought secretly: "He is still a frivolous young man. He is not from the sword sect and knows Wang Long. He must be helping out of righteousness. Li Xian... Li Xian... this name has a unique charm. I wonder what the person is like."

Zhao Chunxia had received many notes and was extremely curious. She analyzed the person from the writing. In her mind, she sketched out a vague figure based on the charm of the characters. A straight figure, a blurred face, but a unique temperament.

She was invaded by illness, but inexplicably, her heart was stirred. Her eyes showed a strange light. She quickly abandoned distracting thoughts and cultivated her mind quietly. She couldn't help but think again: "Is there really such a young man in the world?"

It turned out... Li Xian had taken the opportunity to潜入 (infiltrate) among the guarding servants. The Jie You Lou had collapsed. The daily dishes were sent from Jie You Lou to this place to feed the women and maintain their vitality. Seeing that Jie You Lou had collapsed, Zheng Dechun sent people to recruit the chefs of Jie You Lou to come here to cook and provide food.

Li Xian overheard the important news here. He then pretended to be a chef from Jie You Lou. He possessed the "Appetite" skill, which allowed him to judge the ingredients, heat, and cooking methods of dishes. At the same time, his "Culinary" skill was perfect, and his techniques were熟练 (skilled). With such a disguise, he could actually make the decades-old dishes of Jie You Lou.

Naturally, he could impersonate without any problems and perfectly hide among them. Then, when cooking, he would pass notes to communicate. Li Xian thought at the time: "There are over a hundred women here. To pass notes and understand the situation, I must choose someone I am relatively familiar with. Among the many women, there might be undercover agents. After thinking it over, the Daoist Master Jingchun, whom I met once before, is the most suitable!"

So he used the opportunity of serving food to secretly hide the notes. In this way, they could communicate and understand the situation here, lying low and waiting.

At night, Zhao Chunxia found it difficult to sleep. She talked to the hair. She was extremely curious about this person she had never met. The next morning, Li Xian replied with a note. Zhao Chunxia asked about Li Xian's sect, appearance, and figure. Li Xian drew a simple stick figure, with a round face and a thin body, a few strokes outlining it. In the left hand, he held a spear, in the right, a sword. On the face, he wrote the words "Handsome Face" as a reply.

Zhao Chunxia got the note. She had guessed how he would speak and how he would boast. She knew Li Xian was not an honest person. But she could never have imagined such a reply. For a moment, she smiled brightly. Looking at the word "Handsome" on his "stick figure's" face, she didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

At noon, she used the sunlight to look around. Seeing Ji Hui hiding in the dark on the opposite cliff, she couldn't help but feel a pang in her heart. She looked at the camp below and thought: "That Li Xian... is hiding there. This place is extremely dangerous. If he is discovered, his life will be in danger." She couldn't help but feel extremely worried.

She used the hair to say: "Brother Li Xian... Thank you for your righteousness, but escaping is really difficult. You... you... have the heart to save me, I am immensely grateful. But your life is also important. Please find an opportunity to leave. Don't worry about me."

Li Xian replied with a note: "Where there is a will, there is a way. The path is under your feet. How can a great senior like you complain and feel sorry for yourself?" This note was very short, without the usual lightness and liveliness. Zhao Chunxia read the note and couldn't help but feel lost. She paced back and forth, thinking: "I have suffered repeated setbacks recently and have always complained and felt sorry for myself. Li Xian has the heart to save me, but I first dampen my own spirit. He... he must be angry after hearing this?"

Her mind felt very uneasy. She said to the hair: "Brother Li Xian, it was Chunxia who spoke wrongly. I... I was worried about you, that's why... I hope you won't blame me. If we can meet in the future, I will surely apologize properly. You... you won't blame me, will you?"

Li Xian heard the words and felt it was very strange. He saw that Zhao Chunxia's spirit was受挫 (挫折), so he used words to encourage her. The words were short but the meaning was accurate. He had no intention of blaming her, but why did Zhao Chunxia beg him not to blame her? He was open-minded by nature, and sometimes his thinking was meticulous. But when it came to the twists and turns of a woman's mind, he was far from being able to fathom it. Just one Lady Wen had already given him a headache.

But he was best at attracting women. If this continued, a great disaster would surely befall him.

Li Xian used the lunch time to pass a note: "How could I bear to blame you, Senior? From now on, don't say such things. I will definitely find a way to save you. Senior, please rest assured."

Zhao Chunxia got this note and finally let out a long breath. While feeling relieved, she felt a secret joy. She admired the writing and understood the meaning. She suddenly thought: "He said 'How could I bear to blame you.' What does this mean? Is he pitying me for being pitiable?"

The two secretly communicated. Zhao Chunxia's condition actually improved day by day, and the severe illness naturally disappeared. When she saw today's lunch, she suddenly remembered: "Ah! I am so foolish. I only noticed now. Today's lunch, yesterday's breakfast and lunch... although they are not ordinary dishes, if you eat them continuously for several days, they can form a therapeutic effect! This Li Xian... this little hero Li Xian, his care is so meticulous. He silently cares for my body, and his knowledge of dietary therapy is quite profound and thoughtful."

"I only realized this intention now. It's really, really not right. I need to cheer up and try my best to help him!"

She ate the dishes completely. The color and taste were quite good. Her strength had recovered somewhat, so she tried to regulate her internal energy and practice the "Health Cultivation," trying her best to restore her abilities. Although it was extremely difficult, it was different from before.

She told Li Xian about this. Li Xian was very happy to hear it and drew a thumbs-up on the note to express praise. Zhao Chunxia was both happy and strange. She murmured: "Why does it feel like I am a child waiting for praise? Li Xian is not old, but his thinking is meticulous. He has been hiding for many days without showing any trace. I really need to learn from him."

While admiring him, when she had some spare time and saw smoke rising from the kitchen, she would look in that direction. The two secretly talked and gradually figured out the situation. Zhao Chunxia told him all the details she knew and also understood Li Xian's predicament.

Many plans, the only one that could not be绕开 (bypassed)... was the hermaphrodite, Zheng Dechun! This person had to be killed, otherwise, saving people would be a fantasy.

Zhao Chunxia knew Zheng Dechun's capabilities. He was He Wentian's right-hand man, neither male nor female, not fond of women. He had been in the Second Realm for decades and had just entered the Third Realm. Therefore, he was entrusted with guarding the "Prison Women's Gorge." He was cunning in temperament and very strong in strength. It would not be difficult for Zhao Chunxia to kill him at her peak. However, at this moment, it was difficult to cross this threshold.

Zhao Chunxia knew that Li Xian was very young, the same age as Wang Long, and had just entered the Second Realm of martial arts. To fight Zheng Dechun would surely mean death with no chance of survival. It was an insurmountable obstacle.

However, one evening, during dinner, she received a note that read: "Tomorrow is a great opportunity. From noon to evening, only Zheng Dechun will be here. I will take his head and save you out."

Zhao Chunxia was shocked and let out an "Ah." She felt extremely uneasy and wanted to advise him to give up. But after careful consideration, there seemed to be a young man standing with a spear in the lines of the note, looking down arrogantly at the villain. This made her mind wander and her heart beat very fast.

Zhao Chunxia replied: "You can try. I will do my best to help you." She suddenly thought, if it were like this, wouldn't she meet that "Li Xian" young man tomorrow?

At the same time.

Lin Aoshan and Luo Feiyan both knew that Li Xian would be fighting Zheng Dechun tomorrow. They secretly worried for him and couldn't sleep all day.

Li Xian's hair could coexist with three strands. He was secretly chatting with three people. Li Xian was sleeping peacefully in the wooden杂铺 (miscellaneous quarters), calming his mind.

He had探知 (probed) the situation. Tomorrow, all the杂役 (laborers) and servants would be抽调 (transferred). Only Zheng Dechun would be guarding this place. Tomorrow, among the众女葵 (many women), Li Xian would fight the Third Realm alone, determined to take his head!
