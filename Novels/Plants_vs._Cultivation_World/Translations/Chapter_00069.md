# Chapter 69: Accelerated Growth

As soon as this idea occurred to Gu Mo, he couldn't resist trying it out. At worst, he would lose one Water Spirit Rice plant—an acceptable loss given that he had an entire acre of them in his spirit field.

Without hesitation, Gu Mo reached out and pinched the Water Spirit Rice before him, slowly channeling his spiritual energy into it to accelerate the flow of energy through its meridians.

"It actually works!" 

As the spiritual energy within the plant's meridians began circulating faster, Gu Mo clearly observed the Water Spirit Rice growing at an accelerated rate. In just fifteen minutes, the plant before him had already begun to sprout ears, while the other Water Spirit Rice plants in the field were still in the leaf-splitting stage.

Unbeknownst to Gu Mo, this experiment had led him to grasp a new advanced technique for spiritual plant cultivators: **Accelerated Growth**.

With this technique, a spiritual plant cultivator could hasten the growth of plants, particularly effective for those with naturally slow growth rates. However, mastering this technique was no easy feat. **Plant Perception** was the most basic requirement, followed by precise control over spiritual energy. The meridians of plants were far more delicate than those of cultivators—the slightest mistake could destroy them. Moreover, using spiritual energy to accelerate the flow within a plant's meridians demanded an exceptionally high level of control.

Fortunately, Gu Mo met these conditions perfectly. The spiritual energy in his body was derived from purified solar essence, making it exceptionally pure and easy to manipulate. Additionally, his mastery of the **Perfect-Level Cleansing Technique** further enhanced his control over spiritual energy, allowing him to succeed in his very first attempt at accelerating the flow within a plant's meridians.

Mastering these two aspects meant he had achieved the basics of the **Accelerated Growth** technique. However, perfection required one more condition: the nature of the spiritual energy had to align with the plant's attributes. 

For instance, a cultivator who practiced fire-attribute techniques would be ill-suited to applying **Accelerated Growth** to a water-attribute plant like Water Spirit Rice—it would not only fail to accelerate growth but could outright destroy the plant.

Gu Mo also met this condition. His spiritual energy was balanced across all five elements and carried a trace of solar essence—a vital element for plant growth. This made his spiritual energy uniquely suited for nurturing spiritual plants.

Thanks to these factors, Gu Mo had inadvertently grasped an advanced technique of spiritual plant cultivation. In fact, the moment he comprehended **Accelerated Growth**, he had effectively become a true **Spiritual Plant Cultivator**.

Remarkably, he had achieved this in just over a month—a speed that would astonish anyone. Yet, Gu Mo remained oblivious to this accomplishment, as the inheritance he had received from the Golden Core elder did not include this advanced technique.

### **The Path to Fusion**

Still, Gu Mo felt he was close to becoming a true Spiritual Plant Cultivator. All he needed was to successfully fuse two spiritual plants—essentially, grafting.

"Just a simple graft," Gu Mo mused. "It shouldn't be too difficult." In his previous life, he had practiced grafting fruit trees under his father's guidance. While there were no fruit trees here, he could experiment with Water Spirit Rice. With cultivation techniques at his disposal, grafting rice shouldn't pose any problems.

However, grafting required two different plants. His spirit field contained Water Spirit Rice, Sunbloom, Sunflowers, Peashooters, and Potato Mines. The latter three were off-limits for now—losing even one would be problematic, as he currently had no spare solar essence to replace them. His reserves were entirely dedicated to upgrading his Sunflowers.

Thus, his only options were Water Spirit Rice and Sunbloom. Unfortunately, these two plants were too dissimilar to graft successfully.

According to the inheritance from the Golden Core elder, fusing two spiritual plants wasn't as simple as grafting them together. It required merging their meridians and ensuring the energy flow remained unobstructed—only then would the fusion be considered successful.

Different types of plants had vastly different meridian structures, making the fusion process extremely challenging. Naturally, Gu Mo wasn't foolish enough to attempt such a low-success-rate experiment.

Instead, he decided to fuse **Water Spirit Rice** with **Spirit Jade Rice**, as both were rice variants. Even if their meridian structures differed due to their grades, they were still fundamentally similar.

With his plan set, Gu Mo visited a neighboring disciple's spirit field and obtained a few Spirit Jade Rice plants.

He extended two fingers, summoning a sharp **Gengjin Sword Qi**, and cleanly sliced the Water Spirit Rice he had just accelerated at an angle. Then, he severed the roots of the Spirit Jade Rice.

Placing the upper half of the Spirit Jade Rice onto the rootstock of the Water Spirit Rice, he ensured the cuts aligned perfectly, leaving no gaps.

"**Minor Restoration Art!**"

No need for adhesive—a simple spell fused the two plants seamlessly. The techniques of a **Spirit Farmer** truly remained useful even when advancing to **Spiritual Plant Cultivation**.

However, merely healing the wounds of the two plants did not constitute true fusion. That had been the work of a Spirit Farmer—what followed was the true test of a Spiritual Plant Cultivator.

Activating **Plant Perception**, two damaged meridian diagrams appeared before him. Now, Gu Mo had to merge these two diagrams into one functional system.

### **The True Challenge Begins**

"Alright, let's begin."

Taking a deep breath, Gu Mo channeled his spiritual energy into the plant and began reconstructing the meridians. This was far more difficult than simply accelerating the flow of energy within them.

Given that the two plants' meridians weren't identical, Gu Mo had to create new pathways while sealing off some of the existing ones.

Minutes passed, and beads of sweat formed on his forehead. Most spiritual plant cultivators started with **Grade 1 Low-Tier** plants for their first fusion attempt. Gu Mo, however, had chosen to fuse a **Grade 1 High-Tier** Water Spirit Rice with a **Grade 1 Low-Tier** Spirit Jade Rice—a far more challenging task.

Yet, relying on his precise spiritual energy control and reserves far exceeding those of his peers, he painstakingly completed the fusion of the two plants' meridians.

"**Whew—**"

As the merged meridians began functioning smoothly, Gu Mo exhaled sharply. He realized that more than half of his spiritual energy had been depleted. Had his foundation been any weaker, this experiment would have ended in failure.

Fortunately, he had succeeded—albeit imperfectly. Still, Gu Mo was satisfied. He had fused the roots of a **Grade 1 High-Tier** Water Spirit Rice with the ears of a **Grade 1 Low-Tier** Spirit Jade Rice. He couldn't wait to see what grade of spirit rice this new plant would yield.

"Let's speed things up." Pinching the newly fused plant, Gu Mo injected spiritual energy into it, accelerating the flow within its meridians to hasten its growth.
