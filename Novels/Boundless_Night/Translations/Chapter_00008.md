Chapter 8: Once Shone on the Returning Rosy Clouds

In this era, eternal night blanketed the world. Luminous creatures were rare, and their appearance often signified something formidable and deadly, necessitating immediate retreat from their vicinity. In the vast wilderness, an unknown number of dangerous beings lurked. To expose oneself in such a perilous environment, brazenly emitting light, was undoubtedly a display of confidence, likely indicating immense power.

Qin Ming silently slipped down behind a tree, hiding in the shadows of the dense forest, his heart restless. That was no ordinary luminous creature; it illuminated the entire night sky. In an age without sun, moon, or stars, such a marvel appeared in the pitch-black world.

"A Moonworm!" he had heard of it. Elders often told stories to their descendants, of a very distant ancient time when there was a sun and a moon. Seeing the children's bewildered expressions, the elders would use the Moonworm as an example. "If one day, you happen to glimpse a Moonworm, you will know what the moon looked like." If a Moonworm appeared, no one needed to say anything; everyone would know it was precisely that, for it would be the sole light in the night sky.

When the ball of light initially rose, it was quite gentle. Qin Ming wasn't sure if it was a preconceived notion, but he vaguely seemed to see a blurry insect shadow. Now, however, it was too resplendent. Where was the shape of an insect? Light intertwined, like a dazzling disk, or perhaps a divine crown, radiating light across the night sky.

Cicadas know not spring or autumn, and normally, few insects could survive winter to the next year. Yet, according to the elders, the Moonworm had migrated to this area over fifty years ago, residing deep within the majestic mountains, rarely appearing in the outer regions. According to local customs, it had long been recorded as a "renowned insect" that had stood for fifty years in the great mountains without falling. People had reason to believe its true power might not be weaker than that of exotic beasts or Mountain Lords that had existed for even longer.

Qin Ming was lost in thought. Was this what the moon looked like in that distant ancient era? In the night sky, it was as if a heavenly lantern hung high, sparkling brilliantly, casting a pure light that fell upon the dark forest, blanketing the dim wilderness. In an instant, this entire area was dyed a faint silver. This was completely different from anything he had ever seen. The dense ink-like darkness of the mountains was thoroughly dispelled. The entire world was transformed. Qin Ming gazed at such a beautiful sight, yearning for the ancient world with sun and moon. What kind of world was that? He knew that the Moonworm only illuminated the two nearby small mountains, far from comparable to the true bright moon, which was rumored to shine for tens of thousands of miles, a vast spectacle in the sky, truly great brilliance.

At this moment, all was silent. Whether it was the Wild Boar King, the mysterious creature pursuing it, or other birds and beasts, all were quietly lurking. Suddenly, a streak of light cut through the sky, and the Moonworm departed. The nearby area quickly lost its radiance, and the forest plunged back into boundless darkness.

Qin Ming felt an emptiness in his heart. Then, a strong desire arose within him: when could he, like the Moonworm, come and go freely, with the eternal night unable to obscure his path forward? He had no time for further thoughts. While the various fierce beasts were still deterred and dared not roam freely, he sprang into action, pulling the Blade-horned Deer and the Donkey-headed Wolf over the small mountain, quickly moving away.

Deep in the mountains, a piercing howl echoed, then abruptly ceased. It seemed a powerful creature had been slain at the spot where the Moonworm had dived. The forest fell silent. Neither the unusually strong exotic beasts nor the repeatedly mutated "renowned birds" dared to make a sound.

Twin Tree Village was in sight, and Qin Ming successfully returned with his prey. Approaching the village entrance, he looked back. The wilderness was vast and endlessly dark. The splendid scenes from earlier still flickered in his mind, leaving him somewhat dazed. The ancient bright moon, which once shone on the returning rosy clouds, where was it now?

"Grrrrumble!" A sound came from his stomach. Intense hunger pulled him back to reality. He laughed wryly; what was the point of pondering such ethereal matters? He needed to solve his immediate need for food and warmth.

On such a cold day, only a few children were chasing each other at the village entrance, unwilling to stay indoors.

"Brother Qin, you went into the mountains... and hunted a Blade-horned Deer by yourself?" A scrawny boy's eyes widened in astonishment. The children's small faces were red from the cold. They clustered forward and were startled to see the black Donkey-headed Wolf, which weighed hundreds of pounds. They stared at the two prey, secretly swallowing their saliva.

"Come to my place for meat later, all of you," Qin Ming said with a smile. He was like a gust of wind, dragging the two catches back home. Having endured the journey, he felt like he could have eaten raw meat and drunk blood. He immediately boiled water and called Lu Ze and Liang Wancheng for help.

"Little Qin, are you hurt?" Liang Wancheng, being observant, immediately saw the bloodstains on his shoulder.

"Just a minor injury, it's fine," Qin Ming shook his head. Lu Ze examined him, saw the wound wasn't deep and had already scabbed over, and felt relieved.

Soon, a rich aroma wafted from the small courtyard. Large chunks of meat simmered in an iron pot, while a deer leg, constantly dripping oil, roasted over the fire. Qin Ming's stomach rumbled like thunder. He couldn't wait any longer. He used a small knife to cut a thin slice from the deer leg and, unafraid of the heat, put it directly into his mouth.

"It's cooked, and it tastes great! Wen Rui, did Uncle satisfy your wish today?"

Wen Rui took a bite, his eyes curving into crescent moons in intoxicated bliss. He nodded like a pecking chick, saying, "It's so fragrant! I've forgotten how long it's been since I had meat, Uncle, you're amazing!"

Qin Ming motioned to Lu Ze and Liang Wancheng, telling them to eat first and they could sort out the remaining meat later. Wen Hui, just over two years old, couldn't chew the roasted deer leg and could only eat the boiled and mashed meat paste. He pouted in distress, watching longingly, making everyone chuckle.

Qin Ming was in a crucial period of "rebirth." His body had repeatedly sent strong signals, craving meat immensely. Now, he devoured it ravenously, finally feeling satisfied.

Just then, a few children peeked through the courtyard gate, their faces grimy. Smelling the aroma of meat from the courtyard, they looked eager, their eyes sparkling, but they were too shy to enter. Qin Ming immediately beckoned them, saying, "Didn't I call you at the village entrance? Come in quickly, all of you, and eat together."

"Thank you, Brother Qin."
"Uncle, you're so nice..."

The children called out various things, shyly entering the courtyard. Soon, they began stuffing their cheeks like little hamsters, muttering indistinctly about how delicious it was.

"Slow down, there's plenty more," Liang Wancheng said, fearing the children might choke, and served them some meat broth.

Qin Ming felt his flesh and blood cheering, like a parched land receiving sweet rain. Countless new sprouts burst forth, all things coming to life, brimming with infinite vitality. He clearly felt his tendons growing, his joints occasionally popping, his hearing and sight becoming sharper, and his spirit becoming exceptionally vibrant. Through acquired 'womb-like rebirth', his body was undergoing a true renewal!

Lu Ze and Liang Wancheng had already put down their chopsticks, but Qin Ming was still devouring meat, his appetite like a bottomless pit. This way of eating was somewhat frightening, and he was constantly sweating, white mist rising from his body.

"His body is undergoing rebirth, changing drastically!" Lu Ze was astonished. He hadn't expected Qin Ming's transformation, which had begun yesterday, to still be ongoing and even accelerating. What level was he reaching?

The children couldn't eat anymore, their bellies round and full, their small faces showing immense satisfaction. Qin Ming noticed they felt a bit constrained there and smiled, "Are you all full? Then go play."

Soon, the news of his hunt, the Blade-horned Deer and the Mountain Rogue (Donkey-headed Wolf), spread. The villagers were surprised. At this stage, the wilderness was extremely dangerous, and many people dared not enter the mountains, yet he had achieved such a harvest. Moreover, the mutated Donkey-headed Wolf was notorious, and ordinary people rarely survived encountering it. Qin Ming was only sixteen; how could he deal with such a fierce beast weighing hundreds of pounds?

"Could it be that he underwent rebirth during his golden age?"

For a time, many people came to Qin Ming's small courtyard, inquiring about the situation in the mountains. If it was safe, they too planned to go hunting.

"Mom, I'm hungry," a little girl with patched clothes whispered. In this winter of scarce food, the aroma of roasted meat in the courtyard was especially strong. Some children hid behind their parents, their eyes wide with longing. Qin Ming knew the taste of hunger. Looking at their red, pitiful little faces, he quickly beckoned, saying, "Come over, all of you, and eat together."

These children didn't immediately sit down but first looked at their parents, being quite simple and reserved. Qin Ming then spoke, "Uncles and aunts, I won't ask you to eat here. I'll cut five pounds of meat for each family to take home."

"Little Qin, how can this be..."

"It's settled," Qin Ming said. The entire village had only a few dozen households, enough to distribute some.

"Little Qin is truly a good person. Later, everyone should look around and quickly arrange a beautiful wife for him; he's about the right age."

"No rush for that," Qin Ming hastily waved his hand. The courtyard was filled with laughter, and the children were the happiest, gathered together, their small faces glistening with oil as they ate.

...

"Little Qin, tell Uncle honestly, have you undergone rebirth?" Yang Yongqing arrived. He had met Qin Ming before dusk. It hadn't been long since they parted, yet Qin Ming could now kill a mutated Donkey-headed Wolf, which truly startled him.

Qin Ming smiled and nodded, saying, "Uncle Yang, didn't you say that a noble lady was coming down, and that I should strive to improve myself and perform well? Plus, I encountered danger in the mountains, which stimulated me. My body kept heating up, and suddenly, I underwent rebirth."

"You rascal, you're not humble enough," Yang Yongqing chuckled, pointing a finger at him. Everyone present knew clearly that it was all due to Qin Ming's extraordinary physical constitution and profound accumulated foundation.

"Undergoing rebirth in the golden age, this is the first time in decades for our Twin Tree Village!" Old Man Liu, who lived at the village entrance, exclaimed with emotion. Everyone knew what this meant; he would be dazzling in this entire region, with infinite possibilities in the future.

In this extremely cold weather where one's breath could form ice crystals, Qin Ming's body was like a furnace, growing hotter and hotter. Large amounts of sweat were excreted, making him soaked, and he was nearly enveloped in white mist.

"His flesh and blood vitality is so strong, far more intense than mine back then!" Yang Yongqing's full beard trembled, astonished. He clearly understood that Qin Ming, from head to toe, inside and out, was accelerating his rebirth. First, like autumn and winter, shedding withered leaves, then like spring and summer, sprouting branches and budding. The stickiness on his body was him cutting off yellow leaves and expelling old turbidity. Inside, there was a vibrant vitality, his blood glowed, and he felt as if he had returned to his mother's womb, giving birth to a vigorous new power, reopening the limits of his body.

Qin Ming felt drowsiness creeping in. After eating his fill, he felt as if he was about to fall into a special "hibernation," his eyes barely able to stay open. He asked Lu Ze to distribute the meat to each family, while he himself, following his body's instinct, prepared to sleep deeply in the house.

"Grandma Zhou is being buried today. Please go for me and send some extra meat to the Zhou family," Qin Ming said, enduring the drowsiness. He rinsed his body with ice water, then lay down on the heated bed.

Others, though surprised by his state, did not grasp its full implications. Yang Yongqing, who had seen more of the world, noticed that Qin Ming seemed enveloped in a white immortal mist, and his strong, powerful heartbeat resonated like a drum, causing a tremendous shock in his heart! Most crucially, the other party was still in the midst of "rebirth," far from finished.

Could it be that after Qin Ming's rebirth this time, there might be a slim chance for him to approach those famous youths in the distant bright city? Soon, Yang Yongqing shook his head again. No matter how good one's innate talent, how could it compare to the accumulation of three generations? Moreover, those individuals were already exceptionally outstanding themselves. As for the young man and woman who had recently astonished that city, surpassing all previous "golden age" rebirths, he believed there was no need to even consider them; they were simply not comparable.
