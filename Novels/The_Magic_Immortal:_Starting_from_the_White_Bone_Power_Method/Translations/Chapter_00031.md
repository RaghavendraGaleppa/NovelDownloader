# Chapter 31: The Demon Path Truly Has Prospects  

One month later, at Lotus Mountain.  

Wang Chan held a rudimentary, unranked formation token in his hand. After channeling a spell into it, a faint blue membrane of light enveloped the entire cave dwelling. He tapped it lightly, watching as ripples spread across its surface like water.  

He didn’t dare apply too much force, afraid of breaking the delicate barrier.  

Though his sinister demonic energy was now restrained within his true bones, preventing him from unleashing the full power of his True Bone Body, his physique had still undergone tempering. His strength, speed, and defense were now comparable to a mid-grade magical artifact.  

Once the formation was set up, Wang Chan glanced around. The surroundings were pitch black. The hunchbacked Zhang from the neighboring cave to his left hadn’t returned since his last trip down the mountain. However, since his cave was still rented, he was presumably still alive.  

The cave to his right was also odd. After Fellow Daoist Chen left, no one had come to inspect it, nor had any stewards from the Administration Hall come to manage it.  

The wind howled outside, rustling the half-cut tree at the cliff’s edge. Despite being slashed in half by Chen Fengshuang, it stubbornly clung to life—a testament to its resilience.  

By now, the hour of midnight had arrived. The seductive laughter of the voluptuous female cultivator from Cave No. 48 at the foot of the mountain had been absent for an hour, likely exhausted from her nightly activities.  

Her foundation was solid, and she probably cultivated some unorthodox techniques, as her business was always booming. From dusk until an hour ago, she had laughed about six times. Rumor had it she earned thirty to forty spirit pearls per session, meaning at least two spirit coins today.  

Making money while lying down—now that was a skill.  

Shaking off his thoughts, Wang Chan decided it was time to retire for the night. Yet, for some reason, he felt restless. The moonless night and howling wind seemed perfect for murder and arson. Should he go down the mountain and kill a couple of people to satisfy his urges?  

The moment the thought surfaced, he slapped himself hard across the face. The sharp pain jolted him back to his senses, and he muttered to himself,  

"These demonic impulses are truly mischievous. It’s only been eight days since the last cleansing, and they’re already rearing their heads. But no matter what, I’ll have to wait until after tonight’s cultivation session before using the [Purification Talisman]."  

Taking a deep breath, he entered his room and firmly shut the doors and windows.  

On each wall, door, and window hung a low-grade [Minor Mystic Talisman], a single-layered charm that would self-ignite and explode if the room’s qi was disturbed by an intruder, serving as an early warning.  

After a quick inspection confirmed all talismans were intact, Wang Chan muttered,  

"Please don’t self-destruct. At three spirit coins apiece, I can’t afford to waste them."  

With that, he lifted the bed plank and descended into the hidden cellar beneath.  

---  

The cellar was now as spacious as a bedroom, lined with an unranked concealment formation that masked fluctuations in spiritual energy and prevented casual divine sense probing.  

Of course, if the energy fluctuations inside grew too intense or if an outsider forcibly broke through with a powerful divine sense, the formation would be useless.  

Still, it had cost him a staggering twenty spirit coins—a purchase that had nearly broken his resolve.  

"Someday, when I’m richer, I’ll get a high-grade one. Cultivating amidst swirling demonic energy is no joke…"  

Settling into a cross-legged position, Wang Chan focused his mind and retrieved a vial of [Spirit Nourishing Elixir]. He then began circulating the [Bone Devouring Great Strength Art], sinking into deep meditation.  

Cultivation was a mix of pleasure and pain.  

The pleasure came from devouring spiritual energy, watching as the Bone Devouring Art refined it into strands of pure magic power. Frankly, this process was far more exhilarating than any wellness regimen from his past life.  

As for how dual cultivation with a female cultivator in this world would feel—well, he hadn’t tried it yet. He wondered if it would be more enjoyable than solitary cultivation.  

The pain, however, came when the sinister magic power seeped into his true bones for tempering. The surging demonic energy felt like countless needles piercing his bones, tormenting his flesh in the process.  

During the first few days, Wang Chan had nearly developed a psychological aversion to cultivation.  

But now, after enduring it daily, he had grown accustomed to it. In fact, he almost felt off if he didn’t experience the pain at least once a day.  

Three hours later…  

**[You have cultivated diligently for three hours today. Experience +1.]**  

Wang Chan smiled but kept his eyes closed. After fusing with the demon bone, he could now cultivate for over two hours at a stretch. With the aid of the [Spirit Nourishing Elixir], he could push it to four hours.  

Though he had already gained the experience, he couldn’t afford to waste the elixir—nor the cultivation time.  

An extra hour of cultivation each day amounted to 360 hours a year. Every little bit counted.  

Another hour passed before Wang Chan finally opened his eyes. He stretched lazily, loosened his limbs, and eagerly checked his progress.  

Within his dantian, fifteen grayish-white strands of bone magic power coiled like serpents, while twenty-six wispy strands of newly formed magic power swirled around them like mist, exuding an almost tangible vitality.  

"Twenty-six strands of magic power in a month… At this rate, I’ll condense one full strand every four months. That’s three strands a year. If I ignore bottlenecks, thirty years of hard work should get me to Foundation Establishment."  

A faint smile tugged at his lips.  

This cultivation speed was on par with that of a mid-grade spiritual root cultivator.  

At thirty years old, reaching Foundation Establishment by sixty would still place him within the golden age for the breakthrough.  

Such efficiency wasn’t surprising. The fused demon bone enhanced his cultivation, and the [Bone Devouring Great Strength Art] was profoundly mystical.  

"The demonic path truly has prospects," Wang Chan couldn’t help but marvel.  

Yet, this was merely the most basic form of cultivation—far from the limits of a demonic practitioner.  

According to the manual, if he could obtain spirit bones to assist his cultivation, his efficiency could improve by ten to twenty percent.  

And by "spirit bones," of course, he meant those from demons, ghosts, or monsters—their sinister energy was exceptionally rich and ideal for his purposes.  

As for human cultivators’ spirit bones… It was best to avoid those. Though more potent, the risks outweighed the benefits.  

If conditions allowed, he could also prepare medicinal baths from rare treasures to use during body tempering, further boosting efficiency by another ten to twenty percent.  

Combined, these methods could let him condense four strands of magic power a year.  

And if he wanted to be truly extravagant—  

He could consume pills that enhanced magic power.  

Given his current state, refining a fifteen-layered low-grade Yin-attribute pill would take three days and yield nine strands of magic power.  

Twelve such pills in a little over a month would condense one full strand.  

The effects of pills were undeniably astounding.  

Wang Chan would love to cultivate in such luxury.  

But reality didn’t permit it.  

Even his current basic cultivation was straining his resources. If not for his good looks—allowing him to set up a stall in the market daily, rain or shine, and occasionally land big orders—he wouldn’t be able to sustain this expenditure.  

As expected, the [Spirit Nourishing Elixir] had risen to two spirit coins per vial, and prices were likely to climb further.  

That meant sixty spirit coins a month.  

Moreover, as a demonic cultivator, demonic impulses were now a constant nuisance.  

For instance, the urge to kill someone who rubbed him the wrong way, or to "drill" a certain alluring female cultivator…  

But compared to the benefits of the demonic path, these side effects were trivial. The [Bone Devouring Great Strength Art] even provided solutions.  

Every nine days, he could use a low-grade [Purification Talisman] to cleanse his demonic thoughts.  

Given his current cultivation—fifteen strands of magic power and true energy—only a fifteen-layered purification talisman would suffice.  

And of course, talismans weren’t cheap either. A fifteen-layered low-grade [Purification Talisman] cost twenty spirit coins.  

Using three a month meant another sixty spirit coins.  

In total, his monthly cultivation expenses amounted to 120 spirit coins.  

As for the market prices of spirit bones and medicinal baths—  

One spirit bone cost three spirit coins, while a set of medicinal bath ingredients cost two.  

He had tried both once—cultivating while soaking in the medicinal bath, simultaneously absorbing the sinister energy from the spirit bone in his hands.  

The scene might have looked eerie, but the results were undeniable—a thirty percent boost in efficiency.  

The only downside?  

It burned through money like crazy.
