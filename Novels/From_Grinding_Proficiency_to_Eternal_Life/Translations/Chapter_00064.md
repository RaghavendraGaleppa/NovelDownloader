# Chapter 64: The Entry of the Lin Character Art

‘You have been tainted by an ominous aura.’

‘You are silently reciting the Lin Character Art. The ominous aura is being assimilated. The proficiency of the Lin Character Art has increased.’

In his mind, that hazy figure slowly materialized, as if gazing at the eight-armed, three-headed statue atop the altar from afar.

The anomalies within the entire Buddhist hall rapidly subsided. When Xu Yunfan looked up again, the eight-armed, three-headed Power-Perceiving Bodhisattva statue on the altar no longer possessed that先前的 uncanny and heart-stirring quality.

Though it remained sinister, it no longer tugged at his heartstrings.

“Why must you, Benefactor, entangle yourself in karma?”

A rasping voice exploded right along his spine. Xu Yunfan felt his hair stand on end.

He spun around and retreated, his robes tearing through the air with a hissing sound. One hand had already grasped the瓮金锤 (Earthen Gold Hammer), and his figure shot back violently into the courtyard.

He saw, ten zhang away, beneath the Buddhist hall’s altar, an old monk sitting on a rush cushion.

The monk was facing him directly, his body as withered and thin as a bamboo stick wrapped in human skin. The hem of his cassock was piled up with spiderweb-like wrinkles.

What was most terrifying were his eyes—floating within the murky pupils were two golden lights, as if he had refined all the incense smoke of the entire temple into the embers within his eyes.

Is he human or ghost?!

Warning bells rang loudly in Xu Yunfan’s mind, and his scalp went numb.

It was the first time he had seen a person with such a诡异 (uncanny) appearance.

Without a moment of hesitation, Xu Yunfan stomped his foot. The bluestone bricks beneath his feet instantly shattered into pieces, and his figure shot back violently.

Watching Xu Yunfan about to scale the high wall, the wrinkles at the corner of the old monk’s mouth suddenly curled upward, revealing gold foil embedded between his gums.

Those gold foils shimmered with a strange luster amidst the incense smoke, actually outlining the dense text of the *Rebirth Sutra*.

His withered neck emitted a crisp sound like a bamboo joint snapping. His head tilted back at an impossible angle, and the golden light in his eye sockets flared violently.

“Since you have beheld the True Buddha, why not convert?”

The sound wave, wrapped in a sweet, fishy scent of sandalwood, rushed at him. Xu Yunfan suddenly noticed his shadow twisting into the shape of eight arms on the bluestone slabs.

He bit the tip of his tongue fiercely. The salty, fishy taste, combined with the Lin Character Art guarding his mind, cleared his thoughts. The hazy figure in his mind, stimulated by this, actually moved forward a step, as if trying to step out from the fog. Its form became much clearer.

‘You have been soaked in the scent of incense. The Lin Character Art assimilates it. The proficiency of the Lin Character Art has increased.’

A stream of clarity rushed to his spiritual platform. He saw the arhat reliefs on the surrounding pillars all turning their eyes. Eighteen gazes pierced into the back of his head like steel needles.

This time, however, it stirred Xu Yunfan’s ferocity.

“Stop your ghostly tricks!”

The Earthen Gold Hammer slammed into the ground. The shockwave from the two-hundred-plus-jin weapon tore a gap through the oncoming waves of incense smoke.

Xu Yunfan used the recoil to leap into the air, his foot tapping on an inverted statue of Weituo.

The withered, bamboo-like old monk saw that Xu Yunfan had actually broken free from his mental restraint. His eyebrows trembled, his lips quivered, and his expression was filled with excitement, no longer like before.

“You actually cultivate the ancient methods! Has the Primordial Spirit in the world awakened?!”

The old monk suddenly burst into tears, looking up to the sky with palms joined.

“Ancestor! I have waited for it! I have finally, waited for it!”

Then, he suddenly glared at Xu Yunfan, his murky eyes now covered in bloodshot veins.

The old monk slowly stood up. As he moved, his body emitted a series of令人牙酸 (grating) cracking sounds.

This old monk must have sat motionless in this spot for decades to make such sounds.

Xu Yunfan was secretly shocked, yet he let out a breath of relief. The other party did not seem to be skilled in martial arts, but rather focused on spiritual cultivation, capable of using spiritual power to influence things and trap people in illusions.

After this experience, when he formed the Lin Character Seal, a feeling rose in his mind as if something was about to burst forth.

He was almost at the entry level!

On the contrary, the Lin Character Art focused on spiritual unity and stability of body and mind, making it immune to external disturbances. It was the best method to break through these hallucinations caused by spiritual influence.

As the Taoist teachings say, the Lin Character Art can banish external demons!

Having been held back by this old monk time and time again, Xu Yunfan naturally would not hesitate any longer.

Since he was not a martial arts master, but merely one who had cultivated his spirit for years, what was there to fear?

A tiger’s roar erupted from Xu Yunfan’s throat. The muscles and tendons of his entire body tightened like drawn bowstrings. The muscles of his legs suddenly swelled by three inches, taking on the appearance of a full moon bowstring.

*Hum!*

Amidst the vibrating hum of the bowstring, Xu Yunfan’s figure shot forward like an arrow leaving the string, enveloped in a sharp gust of wind as he charged straight at the old monk.

His right hand gripped the Earthen Gold Hammer, his knuckles turning white. Vital energy and blood surged like boiling water through his body. As the heavy hammer swung, the air let out a惊人 (startling) roar.

The old monk’s withered body, however, remained motionless. The golden light in his murky eyes blazed intensely.

He joined his palms, muttering something. His cassock moved without wind, and a strange spiritual fluctuation spread out like ripples.

Xu Yunfan’s vision blurred, and the scenery around him twisted suddenly.

The beams of the Buddhist hall transformed into giant pythons, and the ground cracked open with countless fissures, as if trying to swallow him.

But he was already prepared. His left hand had long since formed the Lin Character Seal, and he silently recited the *Supreme Goodness is Like Water* Heart Mantra. His mind was united as one, and he was not swayed in the slightest.

“Take this!”

With a fierce shout, the Earthen Gold Hammer smashed heavily into the old monk’s chest.

The withered body flew backward like a kite with a broken string, crashing into the altar with a dull thud.

But Xu Yunfan could clearly feel that when his heavy hammer landed, a great portion of its force was blocked by an invisible power.

The blow landing on the old monk was likely not fatal.

Having found his opening, Xu Yunfan kicked the head of the heavy hammer with his right foot. The Earthen Gold Hammer drew an arc in mid-air. With his stride, twist, and exertion, the vital energy and blood in his body boiled, his muscles bulged like dragons, and his veins popped up like snakes. The air inside the hall suddenly stagnated, as if it had turned into a thick liquid, creating layers of ripples as the heavy hammer swung.

The Earthen Gold Hammer drew a circle directly in mid-air, unleashing a terrifying force.

The thirty-sixth move of the Gale Hammer Style, the final form.

Heaven’s Collapse!

However, in that very instant, a sudden change occurred!

The eight-armed, three-headed statue on the altar trembled violently. The central head, with its compassionate, downcast eyes, slowly raised its head. A blood-colored light shimmered in its empty eye sockets.

The left head, with its furious eyes and bared fangs, let out a piercing shriek. Black mist actually gushed out from the empty eye sockets of the right head.

All three heads were looking toward the sky outside the hall, as if anticipating something.

An invisible force suddenly spread out from the statue, preventing him from advancing another half step.

*Zi!*

A piercing sound that seemed to pierce the clouds suddenly came from the horizon.

Xu Yunfan instinctively looked back and saw a golden stream of light rising from the horizon, shooting violently toward this Buddhist hall.

As the immeasurable ominous aura dissipated, Xu Yunfan, who had been holding the Lin Character Seal in his left hand all along, paused.

The hazy figure in his mind completely walked out from the mist, becoming clear upon his spiritual platform.

It was him!

Xu Yunfan’s heart moved, and a line of information floated in his vision.

‘The Lin Character Art has reached Entry level.’

‘Lin Character Art 0/500 (Entry)
Special Effects: Discerning the Minute, Spiritual Insight, Spirit Condensed and Will Steadfast, Spirit Awakened and Mind Aware’

In an instant, strands of refreshing coolness appeared in his mind, constantly surging upward into his brain.

He felt as if his brain had been submerged in water.

A sensation of being soaked in water constantly surfaced.

In that moment, he felt his thinking speed increase by a large margin. The martial arts bottlenecks he couldn't figure out before, which he could only overcome by repeatedly practicing to increase proficiency, suddenly became clear to him.
