# Chapter 23: Voicing Grievances (with Notice)

On a hidden hillside outside the Spirit Field Zone.

Rainy walked slowly and sat down beside East Wind, smiling, "Why do you have time to come today?"

"Finished work in the spirit fields, and didn't feel like cultivating, so I came early to wait for you," East Wind said, leaning his head slightly to sniff the fragrance of Rainy's hair.

"Aren't you going to weed other spirit fields?" Rainy asked, puzzled.

"Don't even get me started on that, it makes me so angry!" East Wind punched the grass beside him.

"What's wrong?" Rainy straightened up, frowning.

The two had known each other and fallen in love while working as spirit field cultivators.

East Wind then recounted everything that had happened that day to Rainy, without exaggeration, telling nothing but the truth.

After Rainy heard it, she also found it a bit strange and couldn't help but frown, "But he's only one person. He can't be everywhere at once. At most, he can only visit one or two spirit fields a day. If other spirit fields leave their weeds and aphids, isn't that a huge loss? Doesn't that mean you still have an opportunity?"

East Wind shook his head, "You're thinking too simply. The cultivators in other spirit fields aren't fools. They know they might not be able to call Ding Rui over, so the amount of weeds and aphids they leave are always within their manageable range. Even if some spirit fields are slow at dealing with weeds and aphids, they'd rather wait one or two more days, because Ding Rui, without fail, always chooses the one with the largest quantity. Even if ordinary aphids turn into large aphids, Ding Rui can easily handle them."

"And most importantly, Ding Rui's fees are ridiculously low!" East Wind grew angrier as he spoke. "Do you know what he charges for weeding and pest control? He only collects one spirit grain for every ten spirit rice stalks! He makes no profit at all. Doing this is a complete waste of time! So why does he do it? He's here to cause trouble! He's targeting me! Damn him!"

"One spirit grain for ten spirit rice stalks?" Rainy's eyes instantly widened, and she nearly jumped up.

Now, she had no doubts left.

As someone who had also risen through the ranks as a spirit field cultivator, she naturally understood what it meant to charge one spirit grain for processing ten spirit rice stalks, and to include both weeding and pest control.

This was no longer doing business.

Rainy immediately understood that East Wind had clearly been affected by the sarcastic remarks of other cultivators, and Ding Rui hadn't actually done anything excessive; his words were well-measured.

"Hmph!" East Wind finished, letting out a cold snort. "There's no opportunity now, but as soon as there is, I'll make sure that brat knows not to mess with me, East Wind! Once I become an outer sect disciple, I'll definitely find a way to properly teach him a lesson!"
