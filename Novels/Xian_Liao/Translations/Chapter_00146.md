# Chapter 146: Scheming

“Can you all persevere?” Zhou Qing asked, and without waiting for their replies, he drifted away.

His disciples, along with Fu Song and the others, felt a profound shock in their hearts, lost in thought.

Zhang Jingxiu steadied his mind, a look of resolve in his eyes. “By strengthening one’s self, naturally, one can persevere,” he said softly.

Fu Shan nodded in agreement. “Those whose innate nature is like bedrock, unyielding and immovable, are destined to be true seekers of the Dao.”

On the path of cultivation, there are all kinds of temptations and trials. After experiencing these, one might have a moment of fleeting brilliance, but without escaping the cycle of life and death, one ultimately turns to dust. It is known to be an empty pursuit! Yet, cultivating the Dao to seek longevity is like moths drawn to a flame. Even if a bottomless abyss lies ahead, one must leap across without hesitation.

“Today, on the grand path, we are like sparrows. Yet, one day, we shall be like roc birds, soaring beyond the nine heavens, roaming the vast void, transcending all shackles, and achieving true freedom,” Zhou Qing said to Mao Ri with a smile as they departed. Sparrows can fly, and roc birds can fly. All sentient beings are but insignificant specks of dust, but to be able to soar into the sky and behold a more beautiful scenery is, after all, different. It begins with the master of life preservation, manifests in the human world, and culminates in free and easy wandering.

This symbolizes hope. Over the three years since his last sermon, Zhou Qing's efforts, besides cultivation, were primarily focused on deciphering the Divine Water Palace map, in the process of the Dao Court's development. This allows for the continuous production of low-tier spirit pills, talismans, and artifacts, like a flowing stream. However, only Zhou Qing and a few others are aware of this.

The cultivators of Jingyang Dao Domain, never lacking resources, continuously gather them and exchange them for low-tier consumables at Luopo Ridge’s market. Lin Wan'er, through cultivation in the water mansion, gradually reached the peak of the ninth Qi Condensation layer. Her Lingfei Marvelous Sound Scripture subtly improved her physique, and with various resources, her current cultivation aptitude is comparable to that of some talented Dao Court disciples.

After decades, the Dao Court has developed specialized divisions. Zhang Jingxiu's Great Pine Tree also grows on Luopo Ridge, absorbing Earth Elemental spiritual energy. Though its spirit-gathering effect is far inferior to the Great Mulberry Tree, it still provides some benefit. Fu Song returned to Luopo Ridge and invited familiar cultivators from Tianxuan City and rogue cultivators from Luopo Ridge to listen to his sermons. He reiterated the essence of Zhou Qing’s sermons, naturally earning much praise.

Lines of colossal stones formed by Earth-to-Stone Transformation Art, and houses built from them, are spread out densely and orderly across Luopo Ridge. With cultivators employing divine abilities, magic spells, and magic artifacts, it is effortless to excavate caves and construct houses. For the human race in Jingyang Dao Domain, it has been a long time since a new city appeared. Settlements gather into towns, and towns gather into cities. Fu Song and the others also receive a fixed quota of premium spirit rice and spirit tea each year. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement. Luopo Ridge serves as a transit hub connecting Tianxuan City and the Mortal Dao Domain. After all, Luopo Ridge has already endured several beast tides; whether there are many mortals or not, the beast tides will still come, so it doesn't matter much. Furthermore, the territory now occupied by Luopo Ridge extends beyond the ridge itself, encompassing the surrounding mountains. This also saves the Earth Armored Dragon time in searching for earth elemental spiritual items.

Over the years, Blackwater Sect has gained a lot from these beast tides, cultivating a large number of new demonic cultivators. Although Tianxuan City sometimes wonders why Luopo Ridge has a continuous supply of low-tier magic artifacts, elixirs, and talismans, it has never questioned it, considering it a good thing instead. One side must completely surrender for peace to settle between the demon sects; otherwise, if the demonic cultivators' killing intent rises, orthodox cultivators will also be affected and encounter undeserved calamities. At the Foundation Establishment stage, demonic cultivators break through at a speed far beyond that of orthodox cultivators. Conversely, only a powerful human race can truly allow the Blackwater Sect to continue to gain a foothold in Jingyang Dao Domain.

Zhou Qing internally speculated and judged that dealing with the Blackwater Sect would indeed be somewhat difficult for him. Last time, he was able to make Meng Xuan of the Blackwater Sect hand over the map because Meng Xuan was backstabbed by Qin Fang of the Blood Demon Sect. Now, Meng Xuan is certainly holed up in his lair, not giving Zhou Qing any opportunity. He remembers all these grievances. Zhou Qing, of course, does not need to worry about Luopo Ridge. These cultivators of the Dao Court, with various enhancements, even if their Divine Qi Body foundations are far from Zhou Qing's original, they are not a hindrance.

This is an agreement between the Four Great Demon Sects: if the demon race invades on a large scale, the Four Great Demon Sects must watch out for each other and provide mutual aid. In the past, Old Ancestor Tianxuan would also have lent a hand. Old Ancestor Tianxuan has not yet passed away; even if he is in slumber, he should still have the ability for one last strike. Old Monster Howling Moon clearly cannot emerge for now; otherwise, he would have sought revenge long ago for his divine sense avatar being annihilated by Qing Lingzi last time. Currently, the Blackwater Sect and Blood Demon Sect have fallen out and are constantly at war. Moreover, the Blood Demon Sect and Blackwater Sect have already turned against each other, so they likely won't come to help. Although there were losses in the battle with the Blood Demon Sect, most of them were low-tier demonic cultivators. In intense battles, demonic cultivators' potential can be rapidly stimulated, leading to quick growth.

The cultivation of demonic arts, for most cultivators, is like drinking poison to quench thirst. If not for the flaw of losing oneself to madness, there would be far fewer orthodox cultivators in Jingyang Dao Domain.

But then, suddenly, the wind and clouds changed color. As his words fell, two figures appeared in the void. One was a colossal eagle obscuring the sky and sun, and the other was a black flood dragon churning like rivers and seas in the clouds.

“Profound Eagle King, Ink Dragon King!” Meng Xuan exclaimed, his expression startled. The grand formation of Blackwater Palace was activated. This was the Blackwater Grand Formation, inherited from the Divine Water Palace. The disciples of Blackwater Palace panicked; normally, demon beast aura of this level would only appear near Tianxuan City. Terrifying demon king power spread. Blackwater Palace was like a small city, but the entire Blackwater Palace only had about three hundred people. Despite its sparse population, it incredibly boasted twenty Foundation Establishment demonic cultivators. A dark yellow demonic cloud, carrying a chilling aura, gathered above Blackwater Palace. Today was supposed to be a quiet day for Blackwater Palace.

“Bai Yue, I have the Blackwater Grand Formation bolstering me. Although your cultivation is higher than mine, this Blackwater Palace is not something you can break through just by saying so,” Blackwater Sect Master Meng Xuan’s voice echoed in the air. Terrifying demonic power coalesced into a colossal wolf claw that descended, gripping the protective shield formed by the Blackwater Grand Formation. Dark, eerie black water surged from the shield, creating friction upon contact with the massive wolf claw. Yuan Qi constantly rioted, and during the tremendous impact, Blackwater Palace slightly trembled. “The Blackwater Demonic Art, truly lives up to its name,” Bai Yue’s voice emerged. The two sides clashed in aerial combat, causing massive tremors. But Meng Xuan’s Blackwater Grand Art, bolstered by the Blackwater Palace’s grand formation, was incredibly resilient, allowing him to fight Bai Yue, who was a minor realm above him in cultivation, to a standstill.

It seemed that Qing Lingzi’s potential was far more terrifying than Meng Xuan had imagined. Soon after, the demon clouds receded like a tide. Outside the Blackwater Sect.

Meng Xuan’s expression was slightly complex. He sent a telepathic message to the Life-Slaying Daoist: “These three, Bai Yue and the others, their real target isn’t my Blackwater Palace. Their true target is Qing Lingzi.”

“Bai Yue, humans are cunning. Even if Meng Xuan of the Blackwater Sect agrees to help us, he’s not to be trusted,” said the Profound Eagle King.

“I certainly won’t agree to help them lure and kill Qing Lingzi. But I can use this opportunity to try and make the demon race suffer a heavy loss.” Meng Xuan knew very well that if he helped Bai Yue and the others, even if successful, he would inevitably be at the mercy of the demon race in the future. Killing Qing Lingzi would certainly be satisfying for a moment, but afterward, wouldn't he still suffer at the hands of the demon race?

Bai Yue retorted, “Eagle King, I’m being cautious. As long as he agrees to make Qing Lingzi come out, half of our plan will succeed. As long as there’s no Old Ancestor Tianxuan, the human race is vulnerable.”

“What opportunity?”

“Most likely in the Blackwater Sect.”

They wanted to use him to lure and kill Qing Lingzi, but he could also use this opportunity to try and deal with Bai Yue.

Meng Xuan smiled slightly. “Dao brother, let me finish. I believe this is an opportunity.”

“Bai Yue, Meng Xuan and the others, why did they leave?” The Life-Slaying Daoist, who had rushed to provide support, frowned deeply. The three great demon kings attacking together, then suddenly leaving, he didn’t believe it was because of him. He secretly crushed a communication talisman in his hand. With the three great demon kings joining forces, the Blackwater Sect’s chances of holding out today were slim.

Meng Xuan frowned. “This isn’t the first time you and I have dealt with each other. Why bother with such pretenses? Why did you attack my Blackwater Sect today?”

Life-Slaying Daoist said, “Qing Lingzi? Old Ancestor Tianxuan hasn’t passed away yet; they can’t succeed.”

Meng Xuan replied, “Dao brother, rest assured, although we are of the demonic path, we also understand the greater cause of the human race. This matter still requires you to take the lead and plan it out thoroughly.”

“It’s best if you think that way. The demon race wants to destroy our human race; cooperating with them is undoubtedly digging your own grave,” Life-Slaying Daoist said. However, the survival of the human race is a matter of great righteousness. Life-Slaying Daoist’s brows flashed with killing intent. The Ink Dragon King next to him said, “That human junior has the secret of the Divine Water Palace on him; I must get it.”

“You agreed to them?” Life-Slaying Daoist asked.

Meng Xuan said, “Yes, I agreed to them.”

Bai Yue scoffed coldly, “The entire Jingyang Dao Domain should be our demon race’s territory. Your Blackwater Sect will eventually have to submit to us.”

Meng Xuan continued, “Therefore, they intend for me to lure Qing Lingzi out, otherwise, during the next beast tide, they will flatten Blackwater Palace.”

“There are eight fragments of the Blackwater Divine Tablet in total. I have already obtained seven of them. If I find the last one, I can reforge the Blackwater Divine Tablet.”

“Where is the eighth piece?”

Through his careful deductions, Zhou Qing gradually gained insight into how to prematurely open the Divine Water Palace. The Blackwater Sect remained an unstable factor. His previous encounter where Meng Xuan suffered such a great loss, and Zhou Qing himself having killed important figures of the Blackwater Sect, meant that this animosity would not be easily resolved, given the demonic path’s vindictive nature. Zhou Qing speculated that Zhang Jingxiu would be able to attempt True Body breakthrough before the next beast tide. Once a body cultivator reaches close-combat, even at the early True Body stage, they can have some impact on a mid-stage Core Formation cultivator. Just relying on the Divine Sword Thunder Control True Art’s natural suppression of demonic cultivation, if he could find a good opportunity, there was indeed a certain possibility of severely injuring Meng Xuan. Furthermore, Meng Xuan was a seasoned peak mid-stage Core Formation demonic cultivator, with prospects of reaching late-stage Core Formation; even in a solo fight, Zhou Qing couldn't say he had much chance of victory. Such an opportunity would be hard to find.

Since Yuan Mingyue, new Foundation Establishment cultivators have appeared one after another. Tang Jieyuan was among them. With Fu Song, Immortal Aunt Luo, and others present, the affairs of Luopo Ridge were well-organized. Zhang Jingxiu, stationed at Luopo Ridge, with his top-tier combat power below Core Formation, could easily quell any occasional disturbances. Old Fu Song was still not living up to expectations; if his aptitude were as good as Zhang Jingxiu’s, he might also have hopes of reaching True Body. Currently, Fu Song had only just touched the threshold of late-phase Crucible Stage. Fortunately, Old Zhang was progressing well. Zhou Qing also had the Jade Liquid Reversal Pill, which, while primarily for Qi cultivators to increase their chances of Core Formation, also had extraordinary effects for body cultivators. The human race would eventually climb out of the abyss once more.

The Mortal Dao Domain can also extensively develop spiritual fields. Although the spiritual energy in the Mortal Dao Domain is inferior to that of Jingyang Dao Domain, the Mortal Dao Domain has a large supply of spirit stones from Jingyang Dao Domain, which can enhance the effect of spirit gathering formations. Thus, the spiritual energy in the spiritual fields is also abundant. Used spirit stones can even be mixed with demon beast flesh and blood to make fertilizer. In addition, after living in Luopo Ridge for many years, the Earth Armored Dragon has undergone some new changes. With Luopo Ridge as the center, the earth energy from the surrounding mountains converges there, making the soil of the spiritual fields excavated in Luopo Ridge more fertile, and occasionally yielding earth elemental spiritual items. The ability to achieve this is inseparable from the Spirit Gathering Grand Formation arranged by Yuan Mingyue in Luopo Ridge. From time to time, scattered rogue cultivators from the wilds, bringing a dozen or two mortals, came to settle in Luopo Ridge, attracting tens of thousands of mortals to reside there.

Furthermore, the great Confucian scholars of the Ancient Scripture Academy, combining the principles of Confucian self-cultivation with the Formless Heart Method, further refined the Clear Heart Art, which proved excellent for refining divine sense for cultivators below Foundation Establishment. This was his path. Therefore, low-tier spirit rice could also be gradually supplied for the cultivation of Dao Court disciples. Xiao Ruowang had already infused the spirit tea tree with the Demonic Seed. Under the research of master farmers, the tea tree was growing well, and its leaves had a beneficial auxiliary effect on cultivation.

“Demonic cultivators, everyone has the right to eliminate them. As for this matter, once Dao Brother Zhang advances to True Body, and we then join forces with Dao Friend Jinguang and bring in Qin Fang, we might be able to try to coerce Meng Xuan.”

“Hahaha, Junior Brother, there’s been a breakthrough in the matter of the Life-Extending Immortal Pill!” In Qingfu Palace, Fu Shan hadn't closed his eyes for a month, his eyes bloodshot. Yet, he wore a smile and spoke to himself, truly ecstatic.
