# Chapter 627: Blasphemer

They were as numerous as the stars, yet each occupied a greater or lesser domain of law.

However, were tens of thousands of divine authorities merely manifestations of Dao Fruits?

Xu Yunfan had never believed this. If that were truly the case, how could the Taihua Spirit Void World, with only its one hundred and eight Heavenly and Earthly Dao Fruits, even function?

Though this world was vast, it seemed unlikely to be able to support such a monumental foundation of Dao Fruits.

He was more inclined to believe that these so-called deities were merely unique forms of existence or powerful wills that leveraged the world's rules.

Like the Delis before him, whose birth was a mere thousand years ago and whose believers were limited to the vicinity of this small town. What was her true essence?

It was quite thought-provoking.

Zhang Ziyang had a sharp eye, and by observing a part, he could see the whole. He had already grasped the general outline of this world's cultivation system.

Those who became gods likely only used the power of faith and desire to condense an external Dao Foundation, cultivating a thread of indestructible golden nature.

At this moment, the young deity's fury was completely ignited.

"Blasphemer!"

Delis's voice was no longer limited to Xu Yunfan's ear but suddenly exploded within the hollow dome of the church.

The sound carried a strange resonance; it was not a pure roar of anger, but more like a sharp melody suddenly rising to the verge of breaking, containing sonic waves capable of tearing the air apart.

Visible ripples of sound waves spread instantly from the center of the statue. The complex religious murals on the walls cracked and peeled off under the impact of this sound wave.

The first to be affected were the stone guardian statues standing solemnly on either side of the church.

They were carved by ordinary craftsmen from common materials.

*Bang! Bang! Bang!*

A series of muffled sounds erupted like a volley, like clay jars unable to bear the pressure and shattering.

Several statues instantly exploded into dust.

The stone powder, mixed with the shockwave, rushed toward Xu Yunfan, striking him head-on.

Faced with this divine sound冲击 capable of tearing steel and shattering rock, Xu Yunfan did not even take a single step back.

He remained standing where he was, not even the hem of his robe stirring.

Just as the sound wave, filled with violent divine power, was about to hit him, the space around his body twisted subtly and imperceptibly.

There was no earth-shattering confrontation, no dazzling explosion of light.

The divine sound冲击 that could destroy stone statues was like a raging flood hitting an invisible deep-sea vortex. The violent energy ripples collapsed less than three inches from Xu Yunfan's body, silently decomposing and being devoured entirely.

The stirred stone dust flew toward him densely but stopped three inches from his body, as if stalled by an invisible, viscous fluid, before reluctantly falling in a rustle.

The description was lengthy, but this scene happened in the blink of an eye.

The church was dead silent, only the occasional crisp sound of peeling mural fragments falling onto the floor tiles.

In the crystal-like eyes of the statue, the indifferent gaze was replaced by a stronger anger, even mixed with a sliver of faint astonishment.

She clearly hadn't expected this existence, dressed in strange attire and viewed by her as a mere mortal ant, to so easily dissolve the divine sound she had summoned in her anger.

This was a blasphemer.

Many powerful mages did not believe in deities; instead, they sought ways to capture them and study how to become gods.

Was he here to seize her status?!

With this thought, Delis no longer relied solely on sound.

The smooth, jade-like statue began to glow. A gentle yet undeniable light透发 from within the statue, like tangible moonlight, instantly filling the entire space.

Where the light covered, the air became heavy and viscous, as if the space had been frozen like honey.

A massive will descended from the void, like a tangible pressure, gripping every corner of the church.

It was not merely physical pressure, but divine might. A force that acted directly on the mind and soul, causing living beings to instinctively feel reverence, submission, and even complete mental collapse.

This was the most direct manifestation of a deity proving their status.

The core of this will was firmly locked onto Xu Yunfan.

It was not just pressure, but a declaration.

*Humble being, only kneeling is allowed before a god.*

Xu Yunfan's eyebrows raised almost imperceptibly for just a moment.

Then, he let out a light sneer.

For Xu Yunfan, who had just experienced the perfection of his Dao Fruit's reforging and had struggled to return from the ruins of a higher-level Great Dao, this kind of pressure based on the spiritual will was like a faint breeze blowing against his face.

The tsunami-like will, capable of crushing the spirit of an ordinary saint, crashed against his soul, as stable as an eternal divine mountain, but failed to stir even a single ripple.

He didn't even bother to adopt a defensive stance, allowing the massive will to sweep through his consciousness.

His posture remained relaxed, and his eyes regained their initial look of interest, falling back on the glowing statue, as if he were examining a novel and interesting toy.

After a while, seeing that the other party was still only using divine might, Xu Yunfan finally found it somewhat boring.

"Is that all there is?"

Xu Yunfan finally raised his head and clearly uttered a sentence. His voice was not loud, but it stably pierced through the stagnant air and the coverage of the invisible divine might.

He met the statue's crystal eyes, which were blazing with light and seemed ready to spout fire, with a calm gaze.

"Shaped by a thousand years of incense, and you've only formed an empty shell? Your divine power is unstable, your divine might is scattered. But, I have to say, your appearance is indeed not bad."

The tone of his last sentence was exactly like someone evaluating an exquisitely carved but flashy fake flower in a market.

To be honest, the cultivation philosophy of the Hundred Desires Peak emphasized having many furnaces. His *Heaven and Earth Interaction, Yin and Yang Separation and Union True Scripture* was still only at a minor success stage; he still had much to practice.

This final comment about her "not bad appearance" was like a red-hot branding iron suddenly pressed onto Delis's divine heart, which was already extremely sensitive and proud due to her few believers and narrow diocese.

Her fragile self-esteem had been trampled.

Perhaps to mortals, she seemed high and mighty, but in reality, among the countless gods, she was truly weak, pitiful, and helpless.

The previously gentle moonlight divine radiance suddenly turned into a burning white flame.

The blinding light made the entire church as bright as day. The walls and dome, made of mundane materials, seemed to be groaning and wailing, unable to bear this pure overflow of energy.

"Seeking death!"

This time, Delis's voice was no longer a simple, explosive roar, but a combination of countless shattered, sharp, and intertwined frantic notes.

Each syllable had transformed into a tangible attack.

Countless sound blades, shimmering with the cold light of moonlight, accompanied by a piercing sound of tearing silk, suddenly generated around Xu Yunfan's body without warning.

These sound blades were not chaotic but, under the牵引 of a strange divine power, instantly formed a rapidly rotating cage of blades, composed of pure sound and destructive energy.

This was the true attack form of Delis, the Goddess of Song and Listening.

Sound was no longer merely a medium of transmission, but divine power materialized into sharp blades.
