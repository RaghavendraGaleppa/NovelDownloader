# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 106: Medicine Spirit Mountain  

Lin Xuan channeled spiritual energy into his eyes, and the illusion before him instantly dissipated, revealing a small marketplace in his line of sight.  

The market wasn't large—only a few thousand square meters—but it was bustling with over a thousand cultivators. Lin Xuan released his spiritual sense and quickly scanned the area. Just as the three siblings had mentioned, all the participants were low-level cultivators at the Qi Refining stage.  

Though their cultivation levels were modest, the treasure-hunting event was lively. There were no fixed shops here, and no one knew exactly what goods were available. Everyone had to search for themselves. If they found something they wanted, they could either purchase it with spirit stones or trade for it.  

Lin Xuan strolled leisurely through the market.  

It had to be said that the standard of the Youzhou cultivation world was truly different.  

In this place, mockingly referred to as the "Junk Trade Fair" by high-level cultivators, Lin Xuan actually spotted several spirit artifacts—though they were all low-grade. If this were Yanzhou, such a sight would have been unthinkable.  

Of course, given Lin Xuan's current wealth, he had no interest in such low-tier items. A few young cultivators at the fifth or sixth layer of Qi Refining, however, were making a fuss as if they had stumbled upon treasures, nearly coming to blows over the ownership of the spirit artifacts.  

A faint smile tugged at Lin Xuan's lips. Two years ago, he would have reacted the same way upon seeing a spirit artifact. But times had changed. The blue star sea within him had altered his fate, allowing him to advance from a trash-tier cultivator at the first layer to the Foundation Establishment stage in just two short years.  

Looking back at these low-level cultivators now, it truly felt like a lifetime ago.  

Yet finished spirit artifacts were still a rarity. Most of the goods on sale were low-tier materials and talismans. Lin Xuan was sorely disappointed. He had hoped to find something useful, but it seemed he had wasted his time.  

Just as he was about to leave the market in frustration, a sign suddenly caught his eye.  

"Discarded Pills."  

The four characters sent a thrill of excitement through Lin Xuan, though his expression remained calm as he approached.  

The stall owner was a middle-aged man around forty, surrounded by a few young cultivators.  

"Boss, do you sell pills here?"  

"Yes, but they're discarded pills."  

"Discarded pills?" The cultivators exchanged puzzled glances. "You're selling discarded pills?"  

"Are you serious? Consuming discarded pills does more harm than good."  

"You don't understand," the stall owner said confidently. "For us Qi Refining cultivators, consuming discarded Marrow-Cleansing Pills is indeed harmful. But what if they're higher-grade Foundation Establishment Pills or Essence-Nourishing Pills?"  

"Aren't those used by Foundation Establishment seniors?"  

"Exactly. These are Foundation Establishment-grade pills. The materials used to refine them are far more precious than those for Marrow-Cleansing Pills. Even if they're discarded, consuming them won't harm your body."  

"Really?"  

"Why would I lie?" The stall owner angrily produced a waist token inscribed with three ancient characters: "Medicine Spirit Mountain."  

Lin Xuan's heart stirred. Though he hadn't been in Youzhou for long, he had heard of Medicine Spirit Mountain's reputation. In terms of strength, it ranked near the bottom among Youzhou's many sects.  

Yet even the three major powers of Youzhou—Biyun Mountain, Thread Gorge, and Thundercloud Manor—wouldn't dare provoke Medicine Spirit Mountain lightly.  

It was a sect with an extraordinary status.  

Though its disciples' cultivation levels were mediocre, every one of them was skilled in pill refinement.  

The path of cultivation encompassed countless disciplines, and the importance of pill refinement was universally acknowledged. Yet few cultivators were willing to dedicate themselves to it.  

The reason was simple—it was a skill that largely benefited others. Becoming a high-level pill refiner required immense time and effort. But a cultivator's energy was limited. Spending too much time on pill refinement left little for mastering other techniques or advancing one's cultivation.  

This ran counter to the very purpose of pursuing the Dao.  

Thus, aside from the rare few with a genuine passion for pill refinement, most cultivators avoided it entirely or only dabbled at a basic level.  

Pill refiners were scarce, yet cultivation was inseparable from pills.  

This elevated pill refiners to an exalted status. Even a Qi Refining cultivator, if highly skilled in pill refinement, would earn respect from those far stronger than him.  

In Youzhou, whether it was sects, clans, or rogue cultivators, no one dared offend Medicine Spirit Mountain. Apart from the most basic pills like Marrow-Cleansing Pills, which could be refined independently, all higher-grade pills required gathering materials and paying spirit stones for Medicine Spirit Mountain to refine on their behalf.  

Their success rate was simply higher.  

Appearances could be deceiving. This rat-faced middle-aged man was actually a disciple of Medicine Spirit Mountain. Though the patterns on his waist token indicated he was merely a low-level apprentice, no one dared look down on him.  

"My apologies, my apologies! So you're a pill refiner," a low-level cultivator said, cupping his hands in respect. "You mentioned that discarded Foundation Establishment Pills can still aid cultivation. How does that work?"  

"Yes, please enlighten us!"  

...  

Under the admiring gazes of the crowd, the middle-aged man couldn't help but preen slightly. "Discarded Foundation Establishment Pills, if consumed by a Foundation Establishment senior, would neither help nor harm their cultivation."  

"So they're useless—just neutral?"  

"Correct," the stall owner nodded. "But if these discarded pills are taken by us Qi Refining disciples, the precious herbs used in their refinement—far superior to those in Marrow-Cleansing Pills—can still provide some benefit to our cultivation."  

"How much benefit?"  

"That's hard to say," the man admitted with a hint of embarrassment. "It depends on the level of impurities. But roughly speaking, one discarded Foundation Establishment Pill is about one-fifth to one-third as effective as a low-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pill."  

"That little?" The crowd was disappointed, but after a moment of dejection, they still began reaching for their spirit stones. It was understandable—even for sect disciples, the monthly allotment of Marrow-Cleansing Pills was meager, far from enough for cultivation.  

For rogue cultivators or those from minor clans, the situation was even worse. With no access to pills at all, they could only rely on sheer perseverance. Pills that could enhance cultivation were rarely sold even in major markets. Though these discarded pills were less effective, they were better than nothing. Better to buy them now while they could.
