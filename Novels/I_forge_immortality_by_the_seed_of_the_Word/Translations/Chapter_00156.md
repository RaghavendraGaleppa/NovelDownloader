# Chapter 153: Proud Cloud Secret Realm

"Senior Brother, but what?" Zhang Jing asked solemnly.

Upon hearing there was indeed a secret realm suitable for his cultivation level that could also yield vast amounts of destiny energy, the joy on his face had barely appeared before being replaced by seriousness.

The reason was simple.

The conflicted look in Senior Brother Xuan Yuan's eyes clearly told Zhang Jing that this matter wasn't as straightforward as it seemed.

After a moment of silence under Zhang Jing's expectant gaze, Xuan Yuan slowly explained:

"To be honest with you, junior brother, what I mentioned earlier is the famous Proud Cloud Secret Realm. It's not located in our Clear Void Profound Bright Heaven, but within the Dongzhen Huamiao Heaven."

"Proud Cloud Secret Realm?" Zhang Jing's eyes showed confusion.

"Indeed, the Proud Cloud Secret Realm!" Xuan Yuan confirmed with a nod before elaborating:

"This secret realm is extremely unique, opening once every hundred years with two layers. One layer only permits Golden Core cultivators to enter, while the other is exclusively for Foundation Establishment cultivators. Moreover, Golden Core cultivators need to contribute one million destiny energy to enter, while Foundation Establishment cultivators require one hundred thousand."

"Just entering the secret realm requires that much destiny energy?" Zhang Jing exclaimed in surprise.

Xuan Yuan nodded and continued explaining:

"On the day the secret realm opens, all cultivators will be placed in an arena of competition by the secret realm's spirit. Through successive rounds of competition, final rankings for both Golden Core and Foundation Establishment cultivators will be determined. The ranking rewards consist of all the destiny energy contributed by participants upon entry."

"The higher one's ranking, the more staggering the amount of destiny energy they receive."

Hearing this, a look of astonishment appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

After a brief silence, he asked curiously:

"Senior Brother, how many cultivators typically participate when the Proud Cloud Secret Realm opens?"

"Well, from what I know, the smallest number was over 3,500 years ago. That time, only about 29 million Foundation Establishment cultivators and just over 1.8 million Golden Core cultivators entered the Proud Cloud Secret Realm."

Zhang Jing couldn't help but shudder at these staggering numbers.

The Golden Core cultivators could be set aside for now.

But 29 million Foundation Establishment cultivators? The total destiny energy reward pool would reach a terrifying 290 billion!

It was easy to imagine how much destiny energy the top-ranked Foundation Establishment cultivator could obtain.

Though Zhang Jing wasn't clear about the secret realm's exact rules, even the most conservative estimate suggested the first place would receive at least a billion destiny energy.

From 100,000 to possibly billions—a ten-thousand-fold return based not on luck but pure strength!

Returning to the present, Zhang Jing suddenly looked up, his breathing unconsciously becoming heavier.

"Senior Brother, the first place must receive an enormous amount of destiny energy, right?"

"The first place receives one-thousandth of the total reward pool," Xuan Yuan patiently explained before hesitating slightly and adding bluntly: "Junior Brother, the next opening of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm is in thirty-five years. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend you enter this time."

"Please explain, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said, a trace of surprise in his eyes.

"The Proud Cloud Secret Realm attracts countless geniuses and prodigies from the seven great orthodoxies every time it opens, along with carefully nurtured talents from various other major and minor factions. These individuals have all cultivated for at least a hundred years, having perfected their cultivation to the absolute limit."

"Many even include geniuses from the Myriad Races of the Heavens."

"Compared to those monsters, your cultivation time is far too short, Junior Brother. Even if you go, it would be difficult to achieve a good ranking. The key point is that each person only gets one chance to enter the secret realm at the Foundation Establishment stage. Wasting it like this would be truly regrettable!"

"That's tens of billions in destiny energy we're talking about," Xuan Yuan's voice couldn't hide a note of awe.

"In fact, the Proud Cloud Secret Realm has evolved into a battleground for the younger generation of humanity's top orthodoxies, as well as a stage for talented youths from other major and minor factions across the celestial realms."

After listening, Zhang Jing fell into contemplation.

He fully understood what Senior Brother Xuan meant—that with his relatively short cultivation time, he stood little chance against those monsters who had cultivated for centuries and perfected both their cultivation and Dao Comprehension.

Just then, Xuan Yuan's voice interrupted his thoughts:

"By the way, Junior Brother, you cultivate the Primordial Beginning World, right? Which path did you choose?"

"Senior Brother, I chose the World Manifestation path," Zhang Jing answered truthfully.

The moment these words left his mouth, Xuan Yuan's expression changed dramatically.

How could he not know of World Manifestation's reputation? It was notoriously the deepest pit of them all.

However, realization soon dawned on him, and his expression softened slightly.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing was personally recruited by the True Monarch after all. He must have some contingency plan if cultivation fails."

With this thought, a complex look flashed in his eyes as he said meaningfully:

"Junior Brother, legend says the World Manifestation path requires mastering thirty-six perfect Dao Intentions at the Foundation Establishment stage. You should focus on cultivation. Perhaps when you've comprehended over thirty Dao Intentions, you'll have enough strength to compete for destiny energy with those monsters in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm."

"Thank you for your advice, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said with a smile.

Yet at this moment, his mind was already racing.

"Thirty-five years should be enough to perfect all thirty-six Dao Intentions. By then, my combat power shouldn't lose to those monsters."

"I might as well compete in this Proud Cloud Secret Realm."

A flicker of excitement appeared in Zhang Jing's eyes.

Tens of billions in destiny energy!

Enough not only to exchange for the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability, but the remaining could also purchase large amounts of River of Time Golden Crystals to upgrade them to Immortal Seed stage.

Moreover, Zhang Jing was genuinely curious to see how powerful the Foundation Establishment monsters nurtured by the other six great orthodoxies truly were.

Having obtained the information he needed, Zhang Jing quickly bid farewell to Senior Brother Xuan.

Now that he had decided to participate in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm thirty-five years later, his time had suddenly become extremely precious.

The four Dao Intent inheritance manuals he had previously purchased needed to be comprehended to perfection as quickly as possible.

Not long after, watching Zhang Jing's retreating figure, Xuan Yuan murmured to himself:

"I hope Junior Brother takes my advice to heart. If he cultivates steadily for another two hundred years before entering the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, he'd have a real chance at ranking in the top ten—no, wait!"

Xuan Yuan suddenly remembered his junior brother was pursuing the World Manifestation path.

Who knew what state he'd be in after two hundred years? It was entirely possible he might not have progressed at all.

A bitter smile involuntarily appeared on his face.

"Junior Brother, Junior Brother, with so many powerful paths available, why did you have to throw yourself into the pit that is World Manifestation? Ah..."

Returning to his immortal island, Zhang Jing suddenly stopped in his tracks.

Before him by the spirit spring, Deer Thirty-Eight was intently watching the golden auction list of the Myriad Worlds Auction House, a satisfied smile on his face.
