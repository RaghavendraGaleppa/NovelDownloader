# Chapter 6: The Nine Treasures of Heaven and Earth, The Four-Stringed Pipa  

The banquet was lavish, with servants and maids from the Lu residence bustling about, serving tea, pouring water, and even helping to dish out food—almost to the point of feeding the guests directly.  

Lu Jinyin was in high spirits, urging everyone to eat freely.  

At first, the guests weren’t particularly enthusiastic, their appetites seemingly absent, and their hands and feet oddly uncooperative.  

Zhan Duanfeng of the Falling Leaves Sword Sect fumbled with his sword, dropping it to the floor with a loud clang. "Ah! My sword fell—I hope the floor tiles aren’t damaged. If they are, it’ll cost silver to repair, won’t it?"  

The midwife, hearing this, tottered forward on her tiny feet, pulling out some silver and raising her voice. "Is this the kind of silver you mean?"  

"Amitabha," the fake monk rubbed his bald head, feigning distress. "This humble monk hasn’t seen silver in a long time."  

Though he hadn’t lifted a finger to help, the fake monk had still managed to secure a seat at the banquet.  

The guests chattered on, their conversation revolving entirely around silver and money—utterly vulgar.  

Only one girl remained silent, focused solely on eating.  

"Let’s distribute the rewards first," Xiao Ji said bluntly.  

His ability to perceive hidden information told him that Lu Jinyin, in his excitement, had forgotten about the promised payment. Once the banquet ended and the wine flowed freely, some would forget, others would be too embarrassed to ask, and Lu Jinyin himself would likely pass out drunk.  

If that happened, it would take at least two days before anyone saw their reward.  

That scenario absolutely could not be allowed.  

Through his perception, Xiao Ji suddenly realized he could now glimpse events that would occur in the near future—though the timeframe was limited, currently to about three days.  

His ability wasn’t just about uncovering surface-level information or probing others' thoughts and memories. It allowed him to perceive the past, present, and future of all things.  

Of the three states, the future was the hardest to grasp, given its inherent uncertainty. Strengthening his perception of the future would take time—for now, three days was the limit. But as his power grew, he would be able to see further ahead.  

Lu Jinyin slapped his forehead, suddenly remembering, and began preparing the payments.  

In his good mood, he didn’t care who had contributed more or less. Everyone present at the Lu residence that day would receive a reward.  

Naturally, the distribution varied.  

Those who had done the most work—like the Daoists from the Primordial Spirit Temple—received the largest share.  

Those who had taken action also got a considerable amount.  

Even those who had merely stood by in awe received a small sum—after all, they had contributed by setting the mood and lending their presence, which counted as a form of labor.  

As for the banquet, everyone was welcome—not just the invited experts, but even the Lu family’s own servants were treated to lavish food and drink. Once the guests had been tended to, the servants could indulge freely.

The banquet was in full swing when Lady Lu, still weak from her ordeal, came to pay her respects to Xiao Ji and offer tea to those who had helped with the birth, exchanging a few words with each.  

Xiao Ji was particularly interested in the memories of the evil spirit before its demise and took the opportunity to ask Lady Lu about her visit to the Child-Giving Temple, hoping to learn more about the place.  

"Why did you go to the Child-Giving Temple?" Xiao Ji asked.  

Lady Lu replied, "My husband has always longed for a son. To fulfill his wish, I sought blessings everywhere. When I heard the Child-Giving Temple was effective, I went there."  

"Honestly, sons and daughters are both precious. A daughter can carry on the family legacy just as well," Xiao Ji said.  

"It’s all my fault, all my fault..." Lu Jinyin was filled with remorse. If not for his outdated beliefs, his wife wouldn’t have suffered so much.  

Through their conversation, Xiao Ji learned more about the Child-Giving Temple.  

It was an old Daoist temple, isolated in the hills, neither near a village nor a town, over a hundred li from Willow Town.  

Earlier in the year, the temple’s original seven Daoists had vanished without a trace. Now, it was occupied by a traveling physician named Xue, who occasionally left to offer free medical treatment in nearby areas.  

The physician claimed the seven Daoists had gone to a place rich in spiritual energy to cultivate and wouldn’t return for thirty years. He was merely looking after the temple in their absence.  

Over time, people began visiting to pray before the statue of the Child-Giving Daoist. If they were lucky, they might encounter Physician Xue and receive a free consultation. Within half a year, he had effectively become the temple’s de facto master.  

Xiao Ji received a generous sum of silver. During the banquet, he used his perception on various objects, though the cultivation points he gained were minimal.  

He noticed that once an object had yielded cultivation points, no matter how thoroughly he perceived it again, he wouldn’t gain any more.  

This meant each object could only provide cultivation points once. To advance further, he would need to perceive increasingly powerful items.  

For example, the large incense burner at the Primordial Spirit Temple had only granted him points once. If he could have obtained them repeatedly, he could have strengthened his cultivation without ever leaving the temple.  

Through experimentation, he also discovered a pattern: his perception could be divided into surface-level information and deeper, specialized insights. By repeatedly perceiving the same object, he could uncover more details.  

If he focused on a specific aspect, the perception would refine the relevant information while downplaying the rest.  

---  

By the time the banquet ended, it was well past the hour of the Sheep (1–3 PM).  

Xiao Ji carried a small cloth bag containing the valuable mountain goods and three hundred taels of silver he had earned that day.  

With this money, he and his master could live comfortably for quite some time.  

He planned to purchase daily necessities, stock up on his master’s favorite foods, buy a few jars of good wine, and hire a cart to deliver everything to the Primordial Spirit Temple.  

The Lu residence was located in the northern part of Willow Town, while the temple stood in the center. Though they were in the same town, the distance was considerable—Willow Town was large, its walls taller than those of most other towns.  

Standing in front of a gambling den called Fortune’s Gathering, Xiao Ji didn’t enter.  

Not because he didn’t want to, but because he couldn’t.  

Gambling dens strictly prohibited cultivators from participating—a rule enforced by the authorities. Special artifacts, fragile as eggs and hidden in secret locations, detected the slightest fluctuation of spiritual energy. If any spellcraft was used, the artifacts would explode, alerting everyone inside.  

No matter where the caster was, as long as their magic entered the gambling den’s premises, the anti-cheating artifact would shatter. It was an extremely effective deterrent.  

Xiao Ji sighed. Such a lucrative opportunity was beyond his reach—his ability required a small amount of spiritual energy to function.  

Leaving the gambling den behind, he wandered through the bustling streets, past teahouses and taverns, shops and stalls, the air filled with the clamor of commerce.  

Then, from a teahouse called "A Bowl of Fragrance," he heard a burst of applause.  

Approaching, he saw a storyteller in the midst of a tale.  

It had been a long time since Xiao Ji had leisurely enjoyed tea and storytelling. Now that he had money to spare, he decided to indulge himself before returning to the temple.  

Paying a few coppers for a seat near the middle, he settled in as a waiter filled his bowl with tea from a long-spouted pot.  

"Tell us another story!" someone in the audience shouted, and the crowd quickly joined in.  

The storyteller took a few sips of tea, then declared in a clear voice, "Since my esteemed patrons are so eager, I’ll gladly oblige. Today, let me tell you of the Nine Treasures of Heaven and Earth."  

The storyteller, a man in his forties or fifties, was known as Master Wan. He always carried a folding fan and spoke with a gentle demeanor, accompanied by a young apprentice girl of about thirteen or fourteen.  

Xiao Ji knew Master Wan had been storytelling at A Bowl of Fragrance for years.  

A sharp rap of the storyteller’s gavel silenced the room.  

"It is said that our great Li Kingdom has a neighbor—the Valley Kingdom. In its capital, within the imperial palace, grows an ancient ginkgo tree, a wonder of the world. Legend holds that when its golden leaves begin to fall, a great calamity shall befall the land..."  

"Rumor has it that not long ago, a single leaf fell from that ancient tree. The calamity is coming."  

"And when calamity looms, people speak of the Nine Treasures of Heaven and Earth. There’s a saying: 'When the Nine Treasures unite, a sage shall rise, and the calamity shall flee.' The tale of the Nine Treasures is long, but today, let us speak only of one—the Four-Stringed Pipa."
