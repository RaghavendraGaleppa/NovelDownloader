# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 120: Ancestor Tianchen  

Lin Xuan held a dark green token in his hand. With this token, he could select any three treasures from the Spirit Medicine Mountain's vault for his upcoming journey as protective measures.  

Although Lin Xuan had already intended to go, since Elder Tongyu needed his help, he naturally seized the opportunity to gain some benefits.  

Spirit Medicine Mountain was renowned throughout Youzhou for its wealth. With a thousand years of accumulation, the treasures in the vault were unlikely to disappoint.  

As he walked, Lin Xuan pondered what he should choose. Ten minutes later, he arrived at a massive cave.  

Outwardly, it looked no different from an ordinary cave. However, as the sect's treasure vault, its defenses were incredibly stringent. Especially after the female ghost had plundered the Foundation Establishment stage's discarded pills, multiple layers of protective formations had been added to all important locations within Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

After all, as long as one had spirit stones, formation tools could easily be purchased from the market!  

Despite having reached the Foundation Establishment stage, Lin Xuan remained cautious. According to his master, the Twin Dragons Formation guarding this place had cost tens of thousands of spirit stones and was powerful enough to rival the protective formations of mid-tier sects, capable of trapping early-stage Core Formation cultivators.  

Lin Xuan had no desire to test its might.  

He took out a communication talisman from his pocket, imprinted his message onto it with his spiritual sense, and watched as the talisman transformed into a paper crane and flew into the cave.  

Then, he calmly waited outside the cave entrance.  

He didn't have to wait long. Five minutes later, a streak of white light flew out from within. As the light dissipated, it revealed a cultivator in his late twenties.  

The moment the man saw Lin Xuan, he greeted him warmly, "You must be Junior Brother Lin? I’m Yang Xiu, a disciple of Elder Niu. I entered the sect a few years before you, but we’re of the same generation."  

Lin Xuan cupped his hands in greeting. "Ah, Senior Brother Yang, it’s an honor."  

Yang Xiu laughed. "No need for such courtesy. Though you joined later, your talent is extraordinary. You’ve already been designated as the sect’s next leader. For you to bow to me would be too much!"  

Yang Xiu was clearly skilled in conversation—flattering Lin Xuan without appearing obsequious, his words carrying a natural warmth.  

Moreover, he was not yet thirty and had already reached the peak of the Qi Refining stage. Even in other major sects, he would be considered a genius, let alone in Spirit Medicine Mountain, which traditionally placed little emphasis on cultivation.  

After sizing each other up, Yang Xiu spoke again, "This is my first time meeting you, Junior Brother, but I’ve long heard of your reputation. Not only have you achieved Foundation Establishment at such a young age, but your talent in alchemy even surpasses that of the sect master. Truly, you’re an all-around prodigy!"  

His words carried no sarcasm—Yang Xiu’s expression was filled with genuine admiration.  

Despite Lin Xuan’s thick skin, he couldn’t help but blush. He was no genius—his aptitude was merely average. If not for treating pills like candy, he would still be lingering in the first layer of the Qi Refining stage, let alone reaching Foundation Establishment.  

As for his alchemy talent… that was just cheating with his purification ability.  

Unwilling to dwell on the topic, Lin Xuan deftly shifted the conversation. "You flatter me, Senior Brother. Are you the overseer of this vault?"  

"Strictly speaking, no," Yang Xiu replied with a smile. "The vault is managed by my master, but he spends ninety percent of his time in the alchemy chamber. Unless something critical arises, the responsibility falls to me. So, you could say I’m the temporary overseer."  

"I see." Lin Xuan nodded. The treasure vault was different from the discarded pill repository. He had found it odd earlier—even with formidable formations, how could they entrust such a place to a mere Qi Refining disciple?  

This made sense. The actual overseer was one of Spirit Medicine Mountain’s three great elders, which aligned with reason.  

"Since you’re the temporary overseer, I’d like to trouble you with a request."  

"Of course, Junior Brother Lin. As long as it’s within my power, I’ll do my utmost to assist." Yang Xiu thumped his chest confidently. He had already guessed Lin Xuan wasn’t here for idle chatter.  

Lin Xuan was the sect’s rising star, the future sect master. It was only natural to curry favor.  

Though Yang Xiu was clever, his scheming was no match for Lin Xuan’s.  

Noticing the subtle shifts in Yang Xiu’s expression, Lin Xuan deduced his thoughts and smiled. "I’ve come under the sect master’s orders to retrieve some treasures."  

As he spoke, he handed over the token.  

After verifying it, Yang Xiu’s face brimmed with envy, though he wisely refrained from prying. He gestured, "Follow me."  

With that, he transformed into a streak of white light, leading the way. Lin Xuan followed closely behind.  

The two entered the mountain’s interior through the cave, and Lin Xuan was stunned by the sight before him.  

The cavernous hall was vast beyond measure, its end invisible to the eye. Such a structure would be impressive enough above ground, but this was inside a mountain—had the entire peak been hollowed out?  

This proved that Spirit Medicine Mountain was not to be underestimated. Among its past generations of ancestors, there must have been hidden masters.  

"This is where several of our sect’s ancestors secluded themselves for cultivation. Please keep quiet—they dislike disturbances."  

Lin Xuan was still marveling when Yang Xiu’s voice reached him via sound transmission, though the man’s lips never moved.  

Lin Xuan was taken aback but responded in kind. "Ancestors? Core Formation experts? I thought the strongest in our sect were the sect master and the three elders, all at mid-Foundation Establishment?"  

Yang Xiu chuckled. "So Elder Tongyu hasn’t told you yet. It seems he wants you to focus on alchemy without distractions."  

Lin Xuan was momentarily puzzled, but after a brief contemplation, a faint smile tugged at his lips. "That old fox almost fooled me. He’s tight-lipped indeed. It seems Spirit Medicine Mountain isn’t as simple as it appears—there are many hidden secrets."  

Yang Xiu seemed to know something.  

Adopting a sincere expression, Lin Xuan asked, "Senior Brother, could you enlighten me about these ancestors you mentioned?"  

"Very well." To Lin Xuan’s surprise, Yang Xiu agreed readily, leaving him momentarily stunned. All the carefully prepared probing questions he had in mind became unnecessary.  

"Though Elder Tongyu will eventually tell you, I’ll take the liberty now. But you must swear not to reveal this, or I’ll face severe consequences."  

"Don’t worry, Senior Brother. My lips are sealed. I won’t let you suffer for this."  

Assured, Yang Xiu stopped beating around the bush and transmitted as they flew, "Outsiders—even most disciples—believe Spirit Medicine Mountain is only famous for its alchemy. But that’s not the case..."  

"Alchemy is useful, but it consumes most of one’s lifetime. Obsession with it leaves no room for cultivation, which is counterproductive to pursuing the Dao."  

"Our founding ancestor was a genius—why would he make such a foolish choice?"  

The ancestor Yang Xiu spoke of was Tianchen Zhenren, the founder of Spirit Medicine Mountain. According to legend, his peerless alchemy skills had convinced the sects of Youzhou to cede this "mountain within a mountain," rich in earth vein flames, allowing the sect to flourish.  

"Are you saying the legend isn’t true?" Lin Xuan asked, feigning shock.  

"The story is true," Yang Xiu said reverently. "But Ancestor Tianchen didn’t just obtain this mountain for alchemy. His true strength wasn’t that of a mere Foundation Establishment rogue cultivator, as the sects believed."  

"Then what was his cultivation...?"  

Lin Xuan’s voice turned respectful—though mostly feigned. But he had already guessed that the sect’s founder must have been a formidable figure of immense power.  

"Ancestor Tianchen was at the Nascent Soul stage."  

Nascent Soul stage! Lin Xuan was speechless. This was staggering. If it became known that Spirit Medicine Mountain—long considered a third or even fourth-rate sect—had once boasted a Nascent Soul expert, the world would be stunned.  

"Cough..." Lin Xuan took a moment to digest this before asking, "If Ancestor Tianchen was a Nascent Soul cultivator, why did he resort to trickery to seize this mountain with its earth vein flames, which enhance alchemy success?"  

"I’m not entirely sure," Yang Xiu admitted hesitantly. "The ancestor left no records—only vague oral traditions. The truth is lost to time..."
