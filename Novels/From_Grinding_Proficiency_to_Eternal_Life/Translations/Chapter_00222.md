# Chapter 222: The End

Qin Lie’s eyes turned blood-red, and the muscles throughout his body bulged to their limit. The pores on his skin erupted with sounds like firecrackers popping, and a mist of blood sprayed out from them.

This was the life-preserving secret martial art he had painstakingly cultivated. It could instantly triple his vital energy and blood, allowing him to unleash power far beyond his current realm, and the speed he could爆发 (burst forth) with was beyond imagination.

Although the side effects were terrifying, it was enough to save his life.

With this method, he had escaped danger multiple times and fled from death’s door.

However, just as his retreating left foot left the ground, the "Tremor" technique of the Nine Profound Dragon-Subduing Cudgel had already pursued him to his face.

In the deafening roar of air compressed to its limit, Qin Lie’s protective energy shattered like an eggshell.

His proud strength was laughably fragile before the gilded cudgel. The instant his nasal bone collapsed, two rows of teeth, accompanied by bloody froth, burst out from the back of his head and embedded themselves deeply into the screen wall ten zhang away.

"Nine Profundities Return to Origin."

Xu Yunfan’s expression was cold to the extreme, yet a low, dragon-like howl suddenly sounded from his throat, appearing somewhat eerie.

The flowing firelight on the surface of the gilded cudgel abruptly extinguished. As it slid, the air howled, and a muffled thunder-like hum echoed. In the vast underground space, it seemed as if the very air was trembling and vibrating.

Zhan Yan, who was watching the battle, suddenly clutched his chest. His heart was trembling violently in rhythm with the heavy cudgel’s movements, as if some primordial behemoth was about to break out of its cage.

The moment the heavy cudgel descended upon Qin Lie’s broken body, a dense series of bone-cracking sounds exploded around Xu Yunfan. The wind pressure in the surroundings instantly reversed, forcefully pushing Qin Lie, who was desperately trying to retreat, toward the heavy cudgel.

When the Crimson Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength was pushed to its limit, the dragon scale armor leaves on Xu Yunfan’s body flared open, revealing imperceptible gaps from which the breath of flowing magma was emitted.

"No!"

Zhao Mo’s scream was abruptly cut short.

When the ninth streak of crimson fire pierced his chest like a meteor, the tip of the gilded cudgel suddenly lit up with a piercing golden light.

The superimposed shock force of nine layers exploded within his body. The bodies of the two Marrow Cleansing Realm masters, like leather bags filled with shattered bones, twisted into a bizarre spiral within the blood-red vortex.

The hum of the gilded cudgel returning to the steel mechanism case lasted for a full three breaths.

A five-zhang-wide ring of scorched earth appeared beneath Xu Yunfan’s feet, and the edges of the blue bricks displayed a glazed luster.

Half of Qin Lie’s skull was embedded at the edge of the scorched earth, his remaining left eye frozen in disbelief. Until his death, he could not understand how the internal force of a Muscle Refining Realm martial artist could break through the marrow transformation of the Marrow Cleansing Realm and reach a level that even he could not withstand.

*You have successfully killed a Marrow Cleansing Realm master. Your proficiency in the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art has increased significantly.*

*You have successfully killed a Marrow Cleansing Realm master. Your proficiency in the Nine Profound Dragon-Subduing Cudgel Art has increased immensely.*

*You...*

Having killed two Marrow Cleansing Realm masters, the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art had increased by 321 points, and the Nine Profound Dragon-Subduing Cudgel Art had advanced further.

Glancing at the dozen or so system messages flickering in his vision, almost filling the screen, Xu Yunfan, still not having exited the Lin State, remained unmoved, without a trace of emotional fluctuation.

He raised his head and looked at Yuwen Chengji, whose expression was extremely unsightly not far away.

Watching Xu Yunfan walk over slowly, Yuwen Chengji instinctively took a step back, swallowing a mouthful of saliva. The hair on the back of his neck suddenly stood on end as the fragments of the blue bricks Xu Yunfan had shattered landed near his golden-threaded python-patterned boots.

The heir to the Northern Protectorate Manor could clearly hear the throbbing at his temples. The muffled sound of Qin Lie’s skull embedding into the ground was echoing repeatedly deep in his ears.

"Wait, we can talk. I am Yuwen Chengji, the second heir of the Northern Protectorate Manor of the Great Qian. Now, the Great Zhou is terminally ill, while my Great Qian is flourishing and will soon annex the entire Great Zhou. As long as you submit to me, I will reward you, appoint you as the Northern Protectorate General, and grant you a lifetime of glory and wealth. I have heard that you need the gall of the Crimson Serpent to cultivate the Crimson Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength. The treasury of the Northern Protectorate Manor holds three pairs of century-old..."

The air suddenly let out a sharp shriek, like cloth tearing.

The little finger of Xu Yunfan’s lowered hand twitched slightly. This subtle movement made Yuwen Chengji’s pupils contract sharply.

*Bang!*

The Northern Protectorate Manor’s secret true-blood movement technique had not even been fully executed when five spiral-shaped airwaves exploded before his eyes. The vacuum trail left by the fist breaking the sound barrier left him horrified.

*Crack!*

The left side of Yuwen Chengji’s cheek instantly caved in, forming a bowl-sized pit. Four molars, trailing lines of blood, shot into the screen wall behind him.

He spun wildly in the air like a kite with a broken string. The purple gold crown, studded with pearls, shattered into fragments under the force of centrifugal force.

When his back slammed heavily onto the forging platform seven zhang away, the entire right side of his face had swollen up like a piece of fermenting dough.

His originally handsome phoenix eyes were squeezed into thin slits, and a murky fluid was seeping from the corners of his cracked eyes.

He tried to prop himself up, but found that the true blood strength he had been proud of had already failed. The third protruding vertebra of his spine was now sticking out through his broken flesh.

"Wait, wait, I can also talk, I can also be loyal to the Great Zhou. I know the secrets of the Great Qian, I know all the military maps of the Great Qian in the northern lands of the Great Zhou, I..."

Before he could finish, Xu Yunfan walked up to Yuwen Chengji with a cold face, raised his foot, the armor leaves attached to his calf shuddered like a snake, then suddenly retracted and stomped down heavily.

*Pop!*

After watching Yuwen Chengji’s head shatter, dead beyond doubt, Xu Yunfan finally exited the Lin State. The super-sensory state receded like a tide.

The massive amount of information suddenly flooding his mind, which he had no time to process, made his temples feel slightly swollen.

The feeling of standing three zhang around him, as if he were a god on the ground, was marvelous. Everything was grasped in his heart. This was also why he could easily kill Qin Lie and Zhao Mo.

As the potential within his body once again lay dormant, a sense of weakness, soreness, and even a slight instability in his steps set in.

After taking another deep breath from the Ginseng Spirit to calm himself, and feeling the pure yang internal energy slowly flowing within his body beginning to replenish his depleted internal force, Xu Yunfan finally let out a long sigh.

Xu Yunfan turned back to look at Zhan Yan, who was standing there in a daze, looking as if he hadn't fully woken up.

He quickly stepped forward and said, "Master, it seems the crisis has been resolved. Since there's nothing else worth taking here, shall we go up first?"

"Oh, oh, alright!"

Zhan Yan agreed a few times and was dragged along by Xu Yunfan for a few steps before he finally came to his senses. He couldn't help but ask, "Yunfan, how did you do that?"

"It was just like this first, then like that, and then like this..."

"...That heavy cudgel, I seem to..."

"Outside Beiyecheng in Qingzhou back then, a golden light shot up to the stars from the mountains, spreading rumors that a divine weapon had appeared. It was precisely this gilded cudgel."

Zhan Yan was silent for a moment, then said, "This cudgel is called the Crimson Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel. It is a divine weapon forged seven hundred years ago by the founder of the Divine Weapon Valley. It was used by Ma Jin, the Grand Marshal of the previous dynasty. When this Grand Marshal, whose strength was unrivaled under heaven, broke through the Northern Mang Royal Court with this cudgel, he drank the blood of three supreme masters of the Nine Realms of Qi Cultivation."
