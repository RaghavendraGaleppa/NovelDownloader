# Chapter 229: Li Xian Strikes, Turning the Tables

Li Xian and the others successfully entered the city. The streets were illuminated by candlelight, bright as day.

Mud and ash were smeared on their faces to conceal their features, but their facial contours were difficult to change completely. Moreover, it gave off a rather "protesting too much" feeling. If anyone looked directly at them, they would surely be exposed.

Li Xian, being meticulous in his thinking, was secretly worried.

He quickened his pace, positioning himself ahead of Tiger and Dog to avoid direct eye contact. His chest was broad and warm, and Wen Caishang, forced to lean against him, had her body tense. Whether they would be safe or in danger depended entirely on Li Xian's response.

In front of the inn.

Li Xian pushed the door open and shouted, "Innkeeper, bring wine quickly, to honor these two gentlemen!"

The waiter hurried over to serve them. Seeing Li Xian's tall figure carrying a beautiful woman tied up like a rice dumpling, he was astonished, wondering if this was a flower thief. Then he saw the Dog and Tiger duo, with their ugly appearances, mangled flesh, and terrifying injuries, which immediately made his legs go weak.

Li Xian barked, "What are you waiting for?" The waiter quickly replied, "Yes, yes, I'll go right away!"

He immediately brought wine to serve them.

Li Xian looked around, contemplating an escape plan. His ears were sharp, and he heard sounds coming from the kitchen, as if someone was moving things back and forth.

He understood: city inns served both food and lodging, and the ingredients for daily meals needed to be prepared the day before. Therefore, every night, "vegetable suppliers" would deliver fresh fruits and vegetables by carriage.

An idea struck Li Xian: "If I try to escape with Wen Caishang by force, I'll definitely provoke their murderous intent. These two are seriously injured, but their strength and foundation are still there. I can avoid them for now. If I can ride the vegetable supplier's carriage and leave quietly, it would be much safer."

Having made up his mind, he said, "Two seniors, I know these cunning commoners love to shortchange people. I'll go to the kitchen to supervise them and have them cook a couple of dishes."

Tiger and Dog clinked cups and drank, waving their hands with a smile. "Go ahead."

Li Xian walked toward the kitchen. After a few steps, Tiger suddenly said, "Wait!"

Li Xian was secretly alert, his whole body tense. Wen Caishang was also anxious and worried. Li Xian turned around, his face slightly tilted so that it was backlit, half his face hidden in shadow. He said calmly, "Seniors, is there any particular dish you'd like? If necessary, I know some cooking and can prepare it myself."

"Young man, you don't want to let go of this beauty now that you're holding her, do you?" Tiger said displeased.

Li Xian said, "Hahaha, so the two seniors are eager to get close to her. That was indeed my oversight. I'll put this treacherous woman beside you two seniors right now."

Wen Caishang frowned, her nails digging into Li Xian's abdomen as she shook her head slightly.

Tiger said, "Don't rush. I didn't say anything, so you can keep holding her for now." He waved his hand dismissively.

He was torn between his urgent desire for the beauty and his fear of Wen Caishang's methods. During the journey into the city, he had been restless and impatient, eager to play with and torment Wen Caishang. After entering the inn, his mind settled, and this desire grew even stronger. But when he caught sight of Wen Caishang's white dress, he couldn't help but think of his two brothers' tragic deaths, which intensified his shadow of fear and stopped his thoughts.

His spirits lifted, and he raised his wine bowl, saying, "Brother Dog, come, let's drink to mourn our fallen brothers!"

The Tiger was named Zhang Hu, and the Dog was named Li Quan. Together with the deceased Deer and Python, they were sworn brothers. In their early years, they entered the 'Ruins' and caught a glimpse of Wen Caishang's elegance, becoming obsessed ever since. They abandoned martial arts,一心想着抱得美人归 (dedicated to winning the beauty). They were teased and played with by Wen Caishang. Later, when they learned the truth and went to confront her, Wen Caishang, displeased, beat all four of them into disability.

Li Quan said, "Brothers, rest assured! We captured that treacherous woman alive! I will avenge the humiliation you suffered."

Zhang Hu said, "If it weren't for Brother Deer and Brother Python's spiritual protection from beyond, how could we have captured that treacherous woman so inexplicably? It's truly satisfying. I've never seen that treacherous woman so discomposed. Thinking back to those days, she was like a goddess from heaven, lofty and unattainable. Just one glance from her, and I would have willingly lived or died for her. And now... hahaha, soon I'll be able to... make her beg for life and death..."

"Hahaha." Li Quan said, "Someday, let her taste Brother Tiger's skills. I'm afraid she'll be even more discomposed."

Zhang Hu said, "More than that, I need to make her sink into the mud and suffer endless humiliation."

The two clinked cups and drank heartily.

In the kitchen.

The cook heated the wok until it was scorching hot, poured in lard, and added vegetables and meat, creating a sizzling sound. Fragrant aromas wafted out. There was a back door in the kitchen, now open, with several waiters moving vegetables and meat ingredients back and forth. Outside, a carriage was parked, and the vegetable supplier sat on the edge, constantly urging them on. He seemed to catch a glimpse of Wen Caishang and craned his neck to get a better look.

Wen Caishang had bloodstains on her, but her clothes were relatively neat. Helpless in her predicament, bound in shackles, she exuded a captivating charm, and with her extremely beautiful appearance, she instantly captivated the vegetable supplier. Wen Caishang gave him a cold glance, but the supplier wasn't afraid. Li Xian glared at him, and only then did the supplier withdraw his gaze, not daring to look again.

Li Xian deliberately made noise, loudly urging the cook to hurry with the dishes.

When the carriage was empty of vegetables and meat, Li Xian seized the opportunity. While no one was paying attention, he quietly hid in the carriage. Using the "Lightness Technique," "Vast Legs," and other martial arts, his body was as light as a falling leaf. When he hid in the carriage compartment, there was no vibration at all.

The vegetable supplier was a street vendor who knew no martial arts and didn't notice. After receiving payment for the vegetables, he shouted "Giddyup!" and drove away.

The kitchen staff brought out dishes one after another. Zhang Hu and Li Quan drank fine wine, ate large mouthfuls of food, and were extremely happy. Having resolved a major concern, their joy could only be expressed through drinking wine, eating food, and venting their heroic words. Amidst the wine and meat, they talked about how to punish Wen Caishang, how to humiliate her, how to tease her... Their words were vicious, filled with obscenities too不忍直听 (unbearable to hear directly).

After a long while, Zhang Hu said, "That's right, what about that kid from the Sword Rain Pavilion? Should we really let him have fun too?"

Li Quan sneered, "That kid is unlucky. He'll either die at Wen Caishang's hands or at ours. Back then, we pursued her so hard, and we couldn't even get her to look at us favorably. If this kid can so easily taste her滋味 (flavor), wouldn't we from back then be too pathetic?"

Zhang Hu said, "Exactly. Now that Wen Caishang is in our hands, how we humiliate her is our own business. That kid just happened to bump into us. Hehe, whether his艳福 (luck with women) is deep or shallow is hard to say, but his小命 (life) is definitely in danger."

Li Quan said, "If it weren't for our fear that Wen Caishang might still have hidden trump cards, hmph, that kind of美差 (good job) wouldn't have轮得到 (been his turn to have)." The 'good job' he mentioned was, of course, when Li Xian was groping Wen Caishang up and down while tying her up. Li Quan had been very envious at the time.

Zhang Hu said, "In my opinion, Wen Caishang is indeed out of moves. Later, let's call that kid over, have some drinks and food together, and then deal with him directly."

Li Quan said, "No, to be safe, let's keep him for one more day to observe. We can even pretend to let that kid go first. By then, I don't believe Wen Caishang can still have any hidden trump cards. Once we're sure she's out of tricks, we can好好逍遥快活 (enjoy ourselves to the fullest)."

Li Quan said, "Call that kid over. We can still use him." He shouted "Lin Li" toward the kitchen several times, but there was no response. Li Quan and Zhang Hu looked at each other, beginning to feel that something was wrong. Looking back now, it was full of flaws:

"It was already night. Disciples of the Sword Rain Pavilion, Taixin Sect, and Huangsha Sect always travel together and need to form large arrays. It's rare for them to go out alone."

"That kid appeared neither early nor late, but right after the battle ended, as if he had been waiting on the sidelines for the right moment."

Many details came to mind.

Li Quan and Zhang Hu slammed the table and stood up, finally remembering the fair-faced young man beside Wen Caishang. They shouted, "It's him!"

The two, driven by reputation, fought with Wen Caishang, which showed they were not good at strategy and were obsessed with face. When Li Xian appeared, his flattering words to them made them extremely happy. Moreover, having captured Wen Caishang alive, they were so elated and飘飘然 (carried away) that they looked down on everyone, no matter who came.

They especially looked down on Li Xian.

Therefore, Li Xian's flawed plan was surprisingly effective. Although luck played a big part, it was originally四分可行 (40% feasible).

"Bastard! How dare you play us!" Li Quan was furious. The sound wave erupted, shattering all the wine jars, porcelain ware, and tables and chairs in the inn.

The innkeeper, who had been snoring, hurriedly put on his shoes to check. Before he could speak, Li Quan slapped him, killing him with a "bang."

Zhang Hu walked upside down, rushing into the kitchen, but where was anyone there? Zhang Hu and Li Quan shouted angrily, "Chase them!"

They ran wildly through the surrounding streets, but there was no trace of them. They were at a complete loss, left with nothing but满心的憋屈不甘 (hearts full of frustration and unwillingness), hating their own stupidity and carelessness.

The sky gradually brightened.

Zhang Hu and Li Quan knew that Li Xian had escaped and would be difficult to catch in a short time. The two were furious and暴躁 (irritable), raising their hands to smash the surrounding shops. With one palm strike, rows of windows broke, and the vegetable stalls on the ground... were搅得零碎 (smashed to pieces).

The two尽情泄愤 (vented their anger to their heart's content). Suddenly, they heard a loud shout: "Stop! Are you crazy?!"

Su Qiuwu leaped over and grabbed their shoulders. Zhang Hu and Li Quan were in a rage and attacked together. Su Qiuwu snorted coldly and neutralized their attacks.

Zhang Hu and Li Quan were already seriously injured. After three consecutive palm exchanges, their qi was depleted and their blood was exhausted. They had no choice but to暂时熄灭怒火 (temporarily extinguish their anger) and stop fighting.

Su Qiuwu said, "It seems that not only did you four fail to harm Lady Broken Sword, but you were also driven mad by her."

"Bah!" Zhang Hu said angrily, "Su Qiuwu, where was your support? Why are you only coming now?"

Su Qiuwu said lightly, "Last night, we encountered another powerful opponent and were delayed for a moment."

"Is this just a moment late? You damn well didn't come at all!" Li Quan's whole body trembled.

Su Qiuwu said, "What's done is done. We still need to work together, so why dwell on it?"

He said calmly, "It seems the Taixin Four Heroes couldn't keep Lady Broken Sword. Well, well, I expected as much."

"Nonsense!" Zhang Hu said, "My four brothers fought to the death of two and the injury of two. Last night, we had already captured Wen Caishang alive. But she was rescued by the servant beside her, who even used your Sword Rain Pavilion's name! If you had come to help us yesterday, how could this have happened?"

"Hmm?" Su Qiuwu was stunned. "Really?"

"Of course it's true!" Zhang Hu said.

Su Qiuwu said suspiciously, "With just you four, you could hardly even injure Lady Broken Sword. How could you capture her alive?"

"Good!" Li Quan was furious. "So you've always looked down on us too!"

"Hmph! You're right. Wen Caishang is indeed厉害 (formidable). With one sword thrust, my four brothers could only flee in panic. But we couldn't help it if heaven wanted to take her, making her lose all her inner qi."

"This..." Su Qiuwu, being聪明反被聪明误 (too clever for his own good), half-believed and half-doubted, realizing he had missed an excellent opportunity. He couldn't help but secretly regret it, but his face始终不显露 (never showed it). He said, "You said Wen Caishang was rescued? That young man beside her is young and has limited martial arts attainments. How did he rescue Wen Caishang from your hands?"

Li Quan and Zhang Hu suppressed their anger and详细告知 (told in detail) the events of yesterday: how they captured Wen Caishang, how they drank in the inn, how Li Xian disappeared into thin air...

Su Qiuwu pondered: "In that case, I did indeed miss a great opportunity yesterday!唉 (Alas), regret is useless. If Wen Caishang has truly lost her inner qi, right now... capturing her is the best时机 (opportunity)."

He said coldly, "Go! Take me to that inn!"

On the other side.

The carriage galloped through the streets, with Li Xian holding the helpless lady, lying inside the carriage compartment.
