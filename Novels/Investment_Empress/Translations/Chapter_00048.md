**Chapter 48: This Kid is Too Honest, the Bronze Heavenly Scripture Seal!**

Qingyuan Sect, Library Pavilion.

It was an octagonal building, rising layer upon layer, reaching a height of a hundred *zhang*.

Many disciples were entering and exiting. As soon as Li Mo appeared at the entrance, countless gazes fell upon him.

"Is that True Heir Li?"

"Senior Brother Li is really handsome, especially when he smiles; he's so gentle, unlike other True Heirs who are so aloof."

"That must be the Crimson Firmament Sword at his waist, right? To acquire a Profound Weapon at such a young age, his swordsmanship must be excellent."

"What happened with the Divine Edge Cavern yesterday? The earth vein actually erupted ahead of schedule."

"Sigh, now everything below the third layer of the Divine Edge Cavern has been sealed by Elder Hanhe. I'm afraid it will be difficult for any disciple to obtain a Profound Weapon there in the future."

"Many elders don't even have Profound Artifacts; it doesn't really concern the disciples anyway."

...

The whispering wasn't loud, but Li Mo heard it clearly.

"Elder Hanhe moves quite fast, doesn't he?"

"Though that old man values his reputation, he's truly reliable when it comes to getting things done."

Lost in thought, Li Mo arrived at the counter on the first floor.

The Inner Gate steward, seeing him, immediately put on a smiling face: "True Heir Li, are you planning to go to the fifth floor to claim your sect trial rewards?"

"Precisely." Li Mo nodded, handing over his waist token.

"Uh... True Heir Li, the fifth floor only contains some Mid-tier martial arts." The Inner Gate steward reminded him. Suitable Mid-tier martial arts were quite rare even for inner disciples. But a True Heir shouldn't be lacking such things, should he?

Li Mo smiled without a word. The Inner Gate steward suddenly remembered: although this True Heir Li was a True Heir, his master was Elder Shang Wu... Everything suddenly made sense.

"You may choose two Mid-tier martial arts. Please."

"Thank you."

Before long, the other party completed the registration. Immediately, Li Mo turned and went upstairs.

On the second floor of the Library Pavilion, there were still many Qingyuan Sect disciples. The lower three floors housed mostly low-grade martial arts, as well as various biographies and miscellaneous books. Li Mo did not linger, ascending the stairs.

On the fourth floor, the number of people had significantly decreased. This floor contained Low-tier martial arts, as well as knowledge on various topics such as alchemy, forging, and rearing exotic beasts. Most of those browsing books here were also inner disciples. Li Mo did pay a bit of attention. There were even books about cooking. However, after picking one up and scanning it twice, 'Little Li's' mouth twitched slightly as he put it back.

"No wonder the Qingyuan Sect's cafeteria food isn't very good." Li Mo remarked that it wasn't even a tiny bit as good as the cookbook he had received from his investment returns.

The fifth floor. There were even fewer people here. Only disciples who had completed sect missions and accumulated a certain amount of contribution points could spend them to come up here.

"Hammer techniques..." Li Mo walked to the section containing weapon arts. "Quenching Hammer Technique... that's for forging." "Tiger Roar Hammer... suitable for long-handled great hammers? Not quite..."

Alright. It seemed that not only did 'Little Li' himself not particularly enjoy smashing people with hammers. The Library Pavilion was supposed to be all-encompassing, yet it couldn't even find a few hammer martial arts. Indeed. In the martial world, one only heard of Sword Gods, Blade Sovereigns, and Spear Immortals. When had anyone ever heard of a title that included "Hammer"? Hammer techniques were already niche enough. The Cataclysmic Meteor Hammer, being a short-handled hammer, was an even more obscure niche.

"Brother Li!" At this moment, a familiar young voice suddenly came from not far away.

Turning his head, he saw Murong Xiao waving at him from a short distance.

"You've also come to choose martial arts?" Li Mo asked in surprise. Divine Weapon Peak was a powerful and influential lineage. How could they let a True Heir personally run to the Library Pavilion to find martial arts?

"Brother Li, you've misunderstood. I haven't told my master." Murong Xiao gave a wry smile.

He briefly explained a few things, and when Li Mo activated his Heavenly Fate Divine Eye again, he understood.

[Name: Murong Xiao.]
[Age: 16.]
[Root Bone: Roaring Flood Dragon Physique.]
[Realm: Qi-Blood Realm, Seven Meridians.]
[Heavenly Fate: Blue with a hint of grey.]
[Evaluation: His father is human, his mother is a transformed flood dragon. His nature is kind, yet he is deeply affected by his own bloodline. If he can combine the advantages of both, his future is boundless; if he combines their drawbacks, he will become a calamity for the region.]
[Recent Encounters: Affected by his bloodline, he has recently been plagued by distracting thoughts and endless nightmares, dreaming for days that his hands were covered in blood. Thus, he wants to find a mental cultivation method that can calm his mind and soothe his spirit.]

"My master still doesn't know that my half-demon bloodline comes from a Roaring Flood Dragon..." Murong Xiao sighed, his face filled with worry.

"So that's why you came to the Library Pavilion yourself?" Li Mo's expression was odd.

Murong Xiao nodded: "Exactly. If the old man asks, I don't want to deceive him, but I also don't dare to tell him the truth, so I just decided not to tell him at all..."

Li Mo: "..."

Elder Hanhe was so approachable. With a little roundabout explanation, getting a mental cultivation method would be a piece of cake; he might even directly hand over a High-tier one. This kid was truly honest.

"You should be able to find a mental cultivation method," Li Mo said. "But don't expect a Mid-tier mental cultivation method to suppress your bloodline." Li Mo shook his head.

"Then what should I do... huh?" Murong Xiao's face showed his dilemma, truly at a loss, when a booklet was suddenly thrust into his hand.

"This is..."

"Golden Bell Shield, a High-tier body tempering martial art."

"Ah?" Murong Xiao opened his mouth, completely bewildered, unsure why Brother Li was giving him a body tempering martial art.

"To clear your mind and focus your spirit, it doesn't necessarily have to be a mental cultivation method." Li Mo helplessly glanced at the unlucky kid: "This High-tier martial art originated from a Buddhist sect; it contains Buddhist principles and is a method of cultivating both body and mind. If you master the Golden Bell Shield, why would you fear being plagued by distracting thoughts?"

"Golden Bell Shield..." Murong Xiao's dim eyes lit up. But soon, he became flustered again, tugging at the corner of his clothes, hesitant to speak...

"Don't feel burdened." Li Mo patted the Crimson Firmament Sword at his waist: "I obtained a Profound Artifact from Divine Weapon Peak, which is far more valuable than a High-tier martial art. Consider it returning a favor."

Actually, it wasn't just the Crimson Firmament Sword. When he gave something away, the other party might make a small profit, but he always profited more.

"Divine Weapon Peak is Divine Weapon Peak; how can this be considered returning a favor...?" Murong Xiao's lips were tightly pursed, his gratitude beyond words. "Brother Li, I have once again received your great kindness."

Looking at him, it seemed that besides having a child, Li Mo could ask for anything and he wouldn't even frown.

"When you go down the mountain to perform sect missions, be sure to inform me."

"Sect missions..." Including True Heirs, all Qingyuan Sect disciples were regularly required to complete sect missions, whether big or small. This was mandatory. After all, if the Qingyuan Sect did nothing but stand idle, no one would revere it as the leading sect of Ziyang Prefecture.

"I do have this intention recently," Li Mo said. "I'll have to trouble you then." Li Mo agreed. The Murong family had considerable influence in Ziyang Prefecture, being one of the local powers; they could provide convenience for any mission he undertook.

"Then I'll go back and comprehend the Golden Bell Shield first!" Only then did Murong Xiao reveal a smile.

"Go on."

After he left, the system promptly delivered a notification:

[Congratulations to the Host, for successfully investing a High-tier martial art into Murong Xiao, helping him escape the predicament of his bloodline.]

[Investment Return: One Bronze Heavenly Scripture Seal.]

[Bronze Heavenly Scripture Seal]: "Apply it to any martial art to allow it to be deduced, perfected, thereby elevating its grade. It can elevate a martial art to a Peerless Art at most."

"Good stuff!" A High-tier martial art could become a Peerless Art. Moreover, he could even choose the type of Peerless Art! The feedback Murong Xiao brought him this time was somewhat beyond expectation!
