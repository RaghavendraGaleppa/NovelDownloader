# Chapter 334: The Dumplings Made for This Pill (1/2)

The morning sky was a murky gray, making one worry that another heavy snow might suddenly fall.

The Qingmu Camp remained bustling as ever. Soldiers were busy with various post-battle affairs, and the snow-white ground was quickly covered with all sorts of messy footprints and wheel ruts.

The kitchen was even more lively. Cooking utensils had been moved out into the open air, and fresh vegetables were continuously being transported in by large and small carts. It was a scene of fervent activity as they prepared to make dumplings.

The arrival of a certain person made everyone put down their work and greet him loudly.

Li Mo wasn't fully recovered yet, so he and Huang Donglai had come using their combined skill.

"Isn't the Hidden Dragon List about to be released soon?"

"Thinking about it, that's right. Young Hero Li this time is like a god descending to the mortal world. A one-man army at such an age—which young hero could match such a feat?"

"I think in front of Young Hero Li, even our current Crown Prince might not be able to claim the title of number one genius."

"Frankly speaking, that's true. After all, the Crown Prince's status is what it is. If the Heavenly Derivation Sect didn't rank him first, His Majesty would lose face. It's hard to say if there was any underhanded dealings."

"Did you guys notice how skilled Young Hero Huang is at carrying Young Hero Li?"

"Because he... is kind?"

Not long after, Li Mo and Huang Donglai arrived at the kitchen, where generals were also busy working away in high spirits.

Wu Lang was using his thick-backed golden-ringed saber to chop melons and slice vegetables. The defense commander next to him seemed to have practiced martial arts focusing on borrowing force to redirect it, as he was performing 'catch, transform, and release' on a lump of dough.

Commander Qu, still with his head full of white hair, was the most down-to-earth, mixing the dumpling filling.

"Uncle Qu, aren't you planning to dye your hair back?" Li Mo asked casually after releasing the combined skill.

At a glance, Qu Sheng's graying hair made his originally profound and steady temperament seem much more approachable. It easily reminded one of a middle-aged breadwinner, worn down by life's toil and aging quickly.

"No more fussing with it," Qu Sheng replied seriously, squinting his eyes while his hands kept working. "I'm researching something very important."

"Oh?" Li Mo immediately became serious; it was rare for Qu Sheng to utter the word 'important.'

"And moreover, I've already used my gatekeeping martial arts—a set of Soaring Cloud Palm and a set of Golden Silk Severing Cloud Saber—but I still can't take it down."

"Take down what?"

"The dumpling filling."

Qu Sheng brought over a plate of dumpling filling.

Li Mo: "..."

That pork had endured far too much damage it shouldn't have.

"Too much cabbage, and the pork is too fatty. The best dumpling filling should have a mix of fat and lean meat, finely chopped into mince..."

Although Chef Li couldn't personally take action now, he still offered technical guidance.

"This is also a field of study in itself; it requires quite a bit of thought."

"Why did the Commander suddenly think of making dumpling filling himself today?"

"When I left home, my family ate at a town restaurant, and we had pork and scallion dumplings. After that, I've had them many times, but I never tasted that flavor again... never got to eat them again."

Qu Sheng recalled the taste of that plate of dumplings. After all, it had been thirty or forty years since he'd been home; he might not even remember the shape of the dumplings clearly, let alone the taste.

"Why not try this? This is a family heirloom secret recipe; I don't tell just anyone."

"Oh?"

Qu Sheng took the ancestral dumpling filling recipe Li Mo gave him and began researching it enthusiastically, as if he had obtained some profound secret manual.

Meanwhile, a prompt sounded in Li Mo's mind:

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in Qu Sheng and helping him find the taste of home.】

【Investment Feedback: Returning Heart Arrow.】

【Returning Heart Arrow】: "Write a name on the arrow tail, and it will be delivered to the person you are thinking of, provided that person is still alive."

Li Mo was stunned.

Commander Qu clearly could have normal investment feedback.

Why was there no feedback after successfully defending Qingmu City?

The Divine Eye of Fate activated, and Li Mo looked at Qu Sheng, who was flipping through the dumpling filling recipe.

【Name: Qu Sheng】
【Age: 52】
【Bone Structure: Golden Beam Jade Bone (Postnatal Transformation)】
【Realm: Outer Scene Third Heaven.】
【Fate: Black】
【Evaluation: Born a mortal body, average aptitude, a life of奔波劳碌 (running about in toil), born amidst hardship, fortunately dying in comfort.】
【Recent Circumstances: Burning lifespan, overdrawing Outer Scene power, left with only a heart full of homesickness, hoping to be sustained until the Return of the King of the South, then hanging up his seal and returning home to find peace in his roots.】

---

Li Mo instantly understood why he didn't receive feedback from Qu Sheng.

Because he hadn't changed the other party's fate.

Qu Sheng would still die in the defense of Qingmu City, just earlier or later. And Qu Sheng clearly didn't successfully wait for the King of the South, ultimately dying in a foreign land.

"Young Hero Li, is this right?"

A basin of newly made dumpling filling was brought before his eyes.

"Yes."

Li Mo's furrowed brows relaxed, and he nodded.

Young Master Li pondered for a moment and suggested, "It's not festive to eat dumplings without some luck. Let's put something inside when we wrap them."

"True, for good luck. What should we put in?"

"Let's put some money."

Huang Donglai pointed excitedly at the gap in his front teeth. He had only eaten dumplings once in his life, but he ate too aggressively and chipped his tooth on a copper coin. Since then, he's been very cautious.

"Alright."

Li Mo was just thinking the same thing.

*Thud—*

Several wooden boxes crashed heavily onto the ground. The money from the investment feedback, which Li Mo hadn't had time to count, was simply stuffed into boxes. There were fifty or sixty such boxes.

"What is this?"

"Banknotes."

"?"

The kitchen fell silent for a moment. Wu Lang picked one up, and it clearly stated one thousand taels.

Three boxes, all full. He wouldn't dare burn this much even when offering paper money to his ancestors.

Huang Donglai was used to it, however, and shook his head. "Brother Li, how can banknotes be boiled in a pot? We should switch to copper coins or silver coins."

"Good point."

"Yeah, but there are tens of thousands of people, so many dumplings. Even more banknotes probably wouldn't be enough to give out..."

"That's not necessarily true."

"???"

So, thumb-sized golden beans were produced and wrapped into the dumpling filling.

"Cough, Donglai, help me out for a moment."

"What's up?"

Huang Donglai didn't know why he was being called over again, so he put down his work and went over.

Young Master Li glanced at Qu Sheng and saw that our Qingmu Commander was carrying the wrapped dumplings out to the snow to cool down. Only then did he pull something out from his sleeve.

"Put this in a dumpling, and remember to mark it. Don't lose it in the boiling."

"What is this?"

"A top-grade treasure pill."

"Gasp..."

Huang Donglai instinctively leaned back in shock.

A top-grade treasure pill, this priceless item, you're using it for dumplings?

That's freaking awesome.

"I'm making these dumplings specifically for this pill."

Li Mo patted his shoulder, signaling the steady Brother Huang not to make a fuss.

Then he went to the other cooks and took out his special soul-grilling sauce.

Today's Winter Solstice victory banquet would have barbecue paired with dumplings.

He was just passing on the recipe when suddenly a sound of footsteps came from outside. However, the scene was too lively, with too many people coming and going, so it wasn't clear.

"Young Hero Li, look," a cook next to him gestured with his lips.

"Why are you suddenly twisting your mouth..."

Li Mo was confused but subconsciously turned his head.

"..."

It was a... ice lump coming from the ice and snow.

She was about to walk into the kitchen!

Young Master Li's face turned pale with shock!!
