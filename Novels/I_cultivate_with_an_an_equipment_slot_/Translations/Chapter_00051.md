# Chapter 51: The Three-Year Deadline Has Arrived, Inviting the Dragon King to Emerge!

First, there were 100 acres of spiritual fields.  

By trading the future ten years' worth of harvests for upfront capital, Zhang Yan could then purchase more spiritual fields and repeat the cycle. He could even increase the value of the fields by cultivating high-yield spiritual herbs. Additionally, the expertise of spirit planters like Zhuge Wan and Zhang Yan himself would further enhance the land's worth.  

Originally, 100 acres might yield 1,000 spirit stones per year, but after his strategic packaging, the same land could be valued at 1,500 spirit stones.  

By repeating this process, Zhang Yan estimated that within just a few cycles, he could amass a substantial amount of spirit stones and eventually gain control over most of the Qingheng Sect's spiritual fields.  

In theory, as long as he had a powerful backer, this vision could become reality.  

But he quickly dismissed the idea.  

This was, after all, the world of cultivation—strength was the ultimate currency.  

Though he possessed a cheat-like advantage, Zhang Yan was still only an early-stage cultivator. If he truly dared to play such games, he wouldn’t even know how he died.  

Even Zhuge Wan wouldn’t be able to protect him.  

However, if he limited his schemes to just these 100 acres, no one would raise objections—all out of respect for Zhuge Wan.  

"Thank you, Master," Zhang Yan quickly expressed his gratitude to Zhuge Wan.  

After leaving Muling Peak, Zhang Yan first visited the sect’s administrative hall and sought out Steward Bai and others.  

Everyone was shocked when Zhang Yan requested spirit stones upfront without having even planted anything yet.  

But upon further consideration, they realized it wasn’t a bad deal.  

After all, Zhang Yan wasn’t offering nothing in return—he was pledging the harvests of the next ten years. He even had detailed plans for what spiritual herbs to cultivate during that period.  

Most importantly, based on Zhang Yan’s pricing, they wouldn’t lose out—in fact, they might even profit slightly less than usual.  

And then there was the fact that Zhang Yan was backed by Zhuge Wan, a Golden Core cultivator.  

Her reputation was solid. Even if Zhang Yan failed to deliver, they could always seek recourse from Zhuge Wan.  

After all, a Golden Core cultivator within the same sect would surely value face!  

With this in mind, both the administrative hall and the cultivation families connected through Steward Bai readily handed over the spirit stones.  

Not only did they suffer no losses, but they also gained the favor of a Golden Core disciple.  

From every angle, it was a win.  

Some even waived the usual 10% discount and paid the full amount upfront.  

After all, befriending a Golden Core disciple like Zhang Yan had its perks.  

Besides, whether it was the sect or the families making the purchase, it wasn’t their personal funds at stake—the money came from the sect or the families themselves!  

Yet, the goodwill earned would be theirs alone!  

Zhang Yan couldn’t help but marvel at how simple and trusting these people were.  

If he weren’t planning to stay in the Qingheng Sect long-term, he might have considered selling the same land multiple times, absconding with the funds, and leaving them with 100 acres of worthless fields.  

But alas, Zhang Yan was an upright, kind, and principled cultivator.  

Well, the real reason was that he valued his life.  

After all, he had used Zhuge Wan’s reputation as collateral. If he dared to run off with the money, no corner of the world would be safe for him.  

Through this scheme, Zhang Yan managed to secure over 10,000 spirit stones from the future ten-year yields of his 100 acres.  

"I’m rich!"  

As Zhang Yan stepped out with a storage pouch in hand, he couldn’t help but eye everyone around him with suspicion—suddenly, no one seemed trustworthy.  

"I need to carefully plan how to spend these 10,000 spirit stones."  

For him, this was a colossal sum.  

An ordinary cultivator could reach the late Qi Refinement stage with this amount, but for Zhang Yan, it might not be enough.  

The reason was simple—he needed to purchase a vast number of magical artifacts.  

He wanted to master more spells, ensuring he’d have access to numerous divine abilities after reaching Foundation Establishment.  

Thus, spirit stones were never enough—the more he had, the more artifacts he could buy, and the more spells he could master.  

He also intended to acquire spiritual materials to refine his spiritual roots using the Spirit Nurturing Technique.  

"First, a small goal: master three perfected spells and elevate my spiritual roots to mid-grade."  

Zhang Yan silently set his objective.  

---  

Time passed swiftly in the world of cultivation.  

In the blink of an eye, two and a half years had gone by.  

Though not an exceptionally long period, Zhang Yan had transformed from a mischievous youth into a refined young man.  

Thanks to the 10,000 spirit stones, his gains over these two and a half years were substantial. His cultivation had advanced from the third layer of Qi Refinement to the fourth, and he was steadily progressing toward the fifth.  

While his cultivation level hadn’t risen dramatically, his spiritual energy was exceptionally pure.  

Beyond that, Zhang Yan had perfected five spells: Wood Element Technique, Water Element Technique, Spirit Nurturing Technique, Lightfoot Technique, and Spirit Rain Technique.  

This year, he was still half a year shy of turning eighteen.  

With ample time left before his official Foundation Establishment, a terrifying thought crossed his mind:  

"Does this mean I can master a hundred spells?"  

Most prodigies considered mastering three to five spells before Foundation Establishment an extraordinary feat.  

Yet, he had the potential to master a hundred.  

Was there no justice in this world?  

This was utterly absurd!  

"If I truly achieve a hundred spells before Foundation Establishment, how powerful would I become? Could I slay Golden Core cultivators as a Foundation Establishment cultivator? Or even challenge Nascent Soul experts?"  

Zhang Yan felt his mental state teetering on the edge of delirium.  

"Yiting."  

"Coming, Young Master." Over the past two years, Liu Yiting had blossomed into a striking young woman—tall, graceful, and exquisitely beautiful.  

Even among the Qingheng Sect’s outer disciples, she was renowned for her looks.  

However, everyone knew she was Zhang Yan’s personal attendant—his exclusive property—so no one dared to entertain any improper thoughts.  

Liu Yiting approached with freshly brewed tea and poured him a cup.  

This was tea from his second-grade spiritual tea tree. He kept some for himself to enhance his spiritual sense, while the rest was blended into Hundred Flowers Tea, which he used as gifts.  

Still, two and a half years was too short a time in the world of cultivation—his Hundred Flowers Tea had only just begun gaining recognition.  

"Young Master, Elder Zhuge requests your presence when you’re free," Liu Yiting said softly as she massaged his shoulders.  

"Master is summoning me?" Zhang Yan was surprised. Though Zhuge Wan had initially demanded daily visits, she had stopped calling for him once he mastered the art of spiritual planting.  

Her summon now surely meant something significant was afoot.  

"Calculating the time, the three-year agreement must be nearing its end. Could this be the reason?  

Well, I’ll go see what’s happening."  

Since Zhuge Wan had called, Zhang Yan had no reason to delay.  

"Oh, Young Master, there’s one more thing..." Liu Yiting’s voice carried a hint of sorrow.
