# Chapter 112: The Pantheon Reopens

"Even if..."

Zhou Tian was about to launch into one of his lengthy monologues when Mu Su cut him off.

"I understand what you mean. The Holy Divine Cult is the source of everything, but I just want to hit you!"

"..."

Zhou Tian was speechless. He silently handed over the sword in his hand.

Mu Su took the longsword, exerting every ounce of his strength. Energy surged around him, and a fierce sword light slashed down heavily onto Zhou Tian's head. However, it was useless. The attack was directly absorbed, and Zhou Tian was completely unharmed.

Mu Su dejectedly tossed the sword aside. What's the point of fighting?

"Feeling better now?"

Zhou Tian picked up the longsword again and quietly tucked it into his embrace.

"If I could cleave your head in two, I'd feel a lot better."

"You're even starting to j-"

Zhou Tian saw Mu Su's unfeigned expression and swallowed the rest of his words. Giving up entirely, he said, "You can't kill me anyway. I have a suggestion. If you can accept it, we'll cooperate fully. If not, then we part ways."

Mu Su stared intently at Zhou Tian.

"Let's wipe out the Holy Divine Cult. What do you say?" Zhou Tian proposed.

"Good, I accept," Mu Su agreed without hesitation.

Zhou Tian wasn't surprised. He would have been surprised if Mu Su hadn't agreed.

"I know you have an extraordinary background, but it will be very difficult for just the two of us to accomplish this. The Holy Divine Cult has an incredibly profound foundation, and a Holy Emissary is even about to descend recently." Mu Su analyzed seriously.

"Actually, if you give me enough time..."

*Boom!*

Before Zhou Tian could finish speaking, a massive pillar of light shot up from the distant Myriad Gods Mountain, piercing the heavens. The nearby sky rippled like a movie screen, and one illusory projection after another appeared.

Some were completely shrouded in lightning, some had fire dragons coiling around them, some carried scythes on their backs, some held divine spears, and some were hidden in shadows. These figures were incredibly tall, almost level with the current Myriad Gods Mountain – they were the ancient gods of the past.

The most dazzling figure was the one in the center, shrouded in chaotic mist. Just looking at it evoked a sense of grandeur and vastness.

The King of Gods!

An involuntary feeling surged in their hearts, and this title naturally appeared in their minds.

The anomaly continued. A scene of an ancient battlefield emerged: a golden Buddha body tens of thousands of feet tall, yet devoid of compassionate expression. Instead, it continuously unleashed various divine abilities, wielding a Lapis Lazuli Golden Staff and shattering a vast world.

There were also figures dressed in luxurious dragon robes, wearing purple-gold crowns, their eyes cold. Enveloped in the aura of the Five Emperors, nine golden dragons danced, each scale lifelike, their muscles ferocious, tearing apart god-like beings of extraordinary presence.

A blurred figure shrouded in purple qi, a Tai Chi symbol floating above its head; an old man dressed as a scholar, a river of righteousness flowing through the entire battlefield; figures hidden in spatial rifts, preparing for a fatal blow.

The King of Gods faced the siege of multiple individuals alone, his divine might unparalleled, wielding various divine arts with ease: holy light spears, thunder hammers, flaming longswords, and more. Scene after scene flashed by.

Although the King of Gods possessed unparalleled divine might, two fists were no match for four hands. Eventually, he fell silent, and the other numerous gods scattered and fled, leaving behind a shattered world.

"Eight Realms Attacking the Gods?"

Mu Su mumbled to himself. Zhou Tian abruptly turned to look at him.

"How do you know?"

Mu Su was also full of confusion. "I don't know, this term just appeared in my mind inexplicably."

A thoughtful look flashed in Zhou Tian's eyes. This term hadn't appeared in his own mind, so it seemed it only affected the natives of the Land of the Abandoned Gods, i.e., the people of the God Realm.

"Is there any other information?" Zhou Tian asked.

Mu Su closed his eyes and sensed carefully, his brows slightly furrowed. "The return of the gods, the reappearance of the God King, the reopening of the Pantheon."

Finally, he suddenly opened his eyes wide and exclaimed, "Divine Seat Inheritance!"

Zhou Tian's eyes narrowed slightly. Divine Seat Inheritance? Divine Seats were unique to the God Realm, similar to a Buddhist attainment, yet vastly different. Inheriting a Divine Seat was equivalent to directly becoming a god. In ancient times, all Divine Seats were distributed, making it almost impossible for anyone else to become a god.

But now, countless gods had fallen during the ancient war. Who knew how many Divine Seats were vacant?

'So this is what "the return of the gods" means. I thought it meant those fleeing gods were returning. Turns out it's the reopening of the Pantheon, with Divine Seats being inherited anew,' Zhou Tian mused inwardly. 'What exactly are these guys planning with such a grand scheme?'

Mu Su's eyes shone brightly. Just now, he was worrying about how to take down the Holy Divine Cult, and unexpectedly, a pie fell from the sky – a grand bestowal of Divine Seats! If they could truly acquire a Divine Seat, they might actually be able to destroy the Holy Divine Cult.

Zhou Tian looked at Mu Su, who had regained his spirits, and smiled faintly. "It seems we're on the same page."

He didn't know if non-God Realm individuals could inherit Divine Seats, but he didn't mind trying. It was a good opportunity to see what kind of tricks these gods were up to.

"Can you tell me first what 'Eight Realms Attacking the Gods' means?" Mu Su asked Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian was silent for a while, not knowing how to answer. Should he tell him that in ancient times, their worlds united to shatter their world and beat their "King of Gods" into a pathetic state?

After pondering for a moment, Zhou Tian decided to tell him. It wasn't some earth-shattering secret.

"In ancient times, due to certain reasons..." Zhou Tian paused. He had initially wanted to tell him the information he saw in the Heavenly Qin, but on second thought, those were merely things written by the victors. Apart from those who were present at the time, no one could truly explain the specific circumstances. So, he changed the reasons involving right and wrong to "certain reasons."

Zhou Tian slowly recounted the tale.

Mu Su listened quietly, the shock in his eyes growing more and more intense. What Zhou Tian was currently describing undoubtedly opened the door to a new world for him. Just now, he had viewed the Holy Divine Cult as an insurmountable behemoth, but now it seemed like nothing more than a younger sibling.

"So what exactly is your origin?" Mu Su asked Zhou Tian after hearing the ancient history. He had always been curious about Zhou Tian's background.

"I am the third son of the King of Qin from the Heavenly Qin Empire," Zhou Tian said lightly.

After Zhou Tian's recent explanation, Mu Su already knew what the Heavenly Qin Empire represented.

He immediately looked at Zhou Tian with a peculiar gaze. "I didn't expect you to be such a big figure. Why are you acting so recklessly in what's considered enemy territory?"

Zhou Tian waved his hand grandly, exuding an air of powerful command. "I'm no hothouse flower, afraid of death. If I can't live a dangerous life, licking blood from the blade's edge in the most perilous places, then what's the meaning of life?"

Mu Su's gaze became even stranger. He hadn't expected Zhou Tian to have such an outlook. This changed Mu Su's perception of him, turning him into a nutcase with a hole in his brain.
