# Chapter 40: Matthew's Plan

Old Huang shook his head and sighed, "I have to admit, Yang Shou is a very clever man. He found a way to build a good relationship with the chicken cultivators, and then, seizing an opportunity, he secretly took an egg that was close to hatching. He killed and ate the nearly formed chick inside, then used its body and spiritual energy to initiate himself into a demonic cultivation technique. After that, he didn't kill any other cultivators; he merely used the introductory demonic technique to continuously refine immature spiritual rice."

"It was precisely because of this that the demonic aura on him was too faint for even Senior Brother Mu to detect, and his power growth rate was far slower than other demonic cultivators."

Ding Rui's eyes widened, full of confusion. "Didn't the chicken cultivator notice one of its children was missing?"

"The chicken cultivator kept all its children together, which was more conducive to hatching, and never kept an exact count. Because it had never experienced any losses before, Yang Shou was able to exploit the loophole." Old Huang was clearly very helpless.

Ding Rui hadn't expected such a reason and was slightly speechless. "That's a bit too careless about its own offspring, isn't it?"

"They're all pretty much the same, honestly." Old Huang shrugged indifferently, then stood up. "Alright, if you have any more questions, we can talk about them when I have time later. Yang Shou was just one case. During this period, the elders will conduct another thorough investigation within the sect. Even if there are any other problems, they will all be rooted out. I imagine the sect's rules will also be adjusted in the future, with greater emphasis placed on the management of the spiritual fields."

Ding Rui knew that Old Huang was definitely short on time, so he didn't detain him. After seeing Old Huang to the entrance of the spiritual fields, the two immediately said their goodbyes.

At the same time, the cultivators who came to help in the spiritual fields had also finished all of Ding Rui's work for the day. After greeting Ding Rui, they all left one by one.

"Is it even possible that 'demonic cultivators' is just a name we gave them? From their perspective, they are the normal cultivators; the strong prey on the weak. Perhaps *we* are the anomalies!"

"If that's truly the case, then the pressure on me is immense..."

"And Yang Shou's technique was acquired incidentally from a demonic cultivator. So where did *that* demonic cultivator's technique come from? They all kill and devour each other; it's impossible for them to be teaching each other cultivation methods, right? But if they don't pass down techniques, how do demonic cultivators propagate?"

"Could it be that some powerful demonic cultivators, to ensure they have enough food and cultivation resources, deliberately disseminate techniques—perhaps even embedding flaws in them? That actually seems plausible."

"Though it also seems not every type of demonic cultivator requires a specific technique..."

As Ding Rui pondered these thoughts, he walked to his hut and glanced at Green Hornet.

Green Hornet was still in hibernation, and he had no idea when it would successfully awaken with awakened sentience.

He sat on the ground, his mind a jumble of thoughts. After thinking for a while, he suddenly realized, "What's the point of me thinking all this? Right now, I'm just a weakling! The most important thing I should be doing is raising my cultivation level!"

"With the skill slots at my disposal, even if we are the anomalies, even if we are the weaker side, I should still have the ability to change all of this..."

The next day, Ding Rui immediately threw himself into intense work.

Li Yizhen's face went from red to white, then greenish and finally dark, all in the span of a single breath. He stiffly turned to give Ding Rui a forced smile, then turned and walked back into his room.

Ding Rui remained somewhat bewildered until he left Spiritual Field No. 56.

Next, Ding Rui carved out another day, taking some spiritual rice specifically to visit Ma Wen.

Without the rescue efforts of Li Yizhen and the others, he might have had to stay in bed for many more days.

But without Ma Wen, he likely wouldn't be alive today.

A mere bit of spiritual rice was, naturally, an insufficient token of his profound gratitude.

Ma Wen chuckled as he accepted it. "Perfect timing! I've been recuperating these past few days and haven't been out. The sect's rewards are almost used up. This is a timely help, Brother Rui!"
