Chapter 701: My Words Are as Solid as Spoken

"With this treasure as a cover to conceal your life force and simulate the appearance of your true soul returning to nothingness, it may be possible to deceive the laws of the Sea of Bitterness and open a path for you."

"At that time, you shall take the treasure and enter, seeking the traces of the Great Yin Dark Flood Dragon's Dao Fruit for me."

Upon hearing this, Sun Wukong's true soul trembled violently once more. An unbelievable light, mixed with extreme absurdity, exploded within his golden eyes.

He was just about to speak when he met Xu Yunfan's calm,波澜不惊 (ripple-less) eyes.

A barely perceptible tremor ran through his heart.

He quickly calmed down.

After all, he was merely a clone of another, his life and death not in his own hands. What right did he have to negotiate?

"A treasure?"

Sun Wukong's spiritual will was filled with doubt and mockery.

"What treasure can withstand the Soul-Corroding Yin Wind and dissolve the Profound Light? What treasure can deceive that damned Gate of Netherworld's laws? Xu Yunfan, are you trying to fool me like a three-year-old child? I think you want to send the last bit of my true soul to its doom in that ghostly place!"

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged in the face of Sun Wukong's质疑 (skepticism).

He slowly raised his hand, palm facing upward. A wisp of pure Eight Scenery Cloud Qi rose, its nature shifting through the scorching of Li Fire, the softness of Kan Water, the violence of Zhen Thunder, and the thickness of Kun Earth...

The Eight Phases circulated, creating an endless cycle.

"Ordinary treasures naturally won't work. Moreover, you were split from my soul, and it was not easy for you to birth a wisp of true soul. I certainly won't let you perish easily," Xu Yunfan's voice was steady and powerful.

"By relying on my perfected state of the Xuandu Eight Scenery Heavenly Forging Cloud Sutra, supplemented by the Attribute Panel's ability to deduce ten thousand methods, and using the Soul-Returning Stone, Soul-Nourishing Wood, Soul-Stabilizing Pearl, and the remnant wisp of indestructible golden nature from your innate stone embryo as the core, we can forge a Soul-Protection Mystic Mirror."

Whether it would succeed was another matter, but at least he needed to create an atmosphere of being fully confident.

If he himself was uncertain, how could he make others work for him?

Although he could force Sun Wukong to go, initiative and passivity were two completely different feelings.

Some people in the Primordial Origin Sect liked being passive, but Xu Yunfan was different. Once the other party resisted, he would lose interest.

After all, if they resisted, many actions and things couldn't be accomplished.

His fingertips twitched. Several spiritual materials, radiating strange fluctuations, flew out from the pile and悬浮 (levitated) above his palm: a pitch-black strange stone covered in profound returning-to-nothing patterns, a section of a gray-white wood core flowing with gentle vitality, a dark blue pearl with a nebula-like vortex churning inside, and finally, a faint but incredibly tough wisp of dark golden light originating from Sun Wukong's main body.

"The outer shell of this mirror will be made from the Soul-Returning Stone, engraved with the Dao patterns of the Sea of Bitterness's returning to nothingness to confuse the heavenly mechanism's sensing. The inner part will embed the Soul-Nourishing Wood core to firmly hold the true soul's origin from dispersing. The Soul-Stabilizing Pearl will be in the center to harmonize and stabilize the spirit body's form, resisting the erosion of the netherworld's chaotic currents. As for your innate indestructible golden nature..."

Xu Yunfan's gaze fell upon that wisp of dark golden light.

"...it will be the true core pass of this treasure. It originates from the world's creation, containing a trace of this world's origin imprint. By right, entering and leaving the Azure Abyss should be an easy task. Using it as the core may, to the greatest extent, reduce the Gate of Netherworld's排斥 (rejection) of foreign objects."

Xu Yunfan's plan was bold yet meticulous, pushing the subtleties of artifact refining and his understanding of karma to the extreme.

As for reincarnation, although he did not cultivate reincarnation methods, through analogy, he had delved into it over the years.

Now was the time to use Sun Wukong as an experiment.

Sun Wukong's true soul listened. Seeing Xu Yunfan speak so logically and coherently, the doubt in his eyes, though not completely消散 (dissipated), weakened a bit, replaced by solemnity.

After a pause, Xu Yunfan said, "Once you complete this task, I will grant you freedom. How about that?"

Upon hearing these words, Sun Wukong's resistance instantly weakened by more than half.

"Truly?"

Xu Yunfan smiled slightly. "You can inquire outside. The things I say and do, I have never gone back on my word."

"Hmph!"

Sun Wukong's true soul snorted coldly. His spiritual fluctuation remained strong, but he no longer refuted it vehemently.

"It's easy to say. Even if the treasure is forged, the depths of the Sea of Bitterness are fraught with danger. The legendary Sea of Bitterness Flood Dragon is ferocious to the extreme, and it coexists with the Dao Fruit you seek. With my current true soul, even with a treasure for protection, wouldn't entering just be seeking death?"

"That is why you need to act with caution," Xu Yunfan continued. "Rely on the treasure to conceal your tracks, with reconnaissance as the primary goal. Never engage in a direct confrontation unless necessary."

"Your combat instincts and crisis perception are the keys to this journey. Moreover..."

His gaze deepened as he looked at Sun Wukong, adding more筹码 (stakes).

"Once the task is successful and we find the traces of the Great Yin Dao Fruit, I will personally go to接引 (guide) you out. At that time, it is no empty promise to reshape your innate Dao body and continue your path of Dao."

Reshape the Dao body, continue the path of Dao!

These eight words struck deep into Sun Wukong's true soul like a heavy hammer.

The humiliation and despair of his Golden Core self-detonating, his physical body being destroyed, and his true soul remaining in the banner, seemed to be torn open a gap at this moment.

He could still seek the Great Dao again!

Although his hatred for Xu Yunfan had not消散 (dissipated), the temptation of this promise was too great for a former innate creature and king of battle.

Sun Wukong's true soul fell silent, his illusory golden eyes staring fixedly at Xu Yunfan, as if trying to penetrate his appearance and see the true intention behind his words.

To verify the truth of his words.

But Xu Yunfan was a True Lord. What he said, Sun Wukong could not see through or figure out.

The hall fell into a momentary silence, only the lingering spiritual charm of the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi flowing slowly in the air.

After a long time, Sun Wukong's spiritual will, carrying a molten gold texture, sounded again, filled with complexity and determination.

"Alright! This old Sun will trust you one more time! But Xu Yunfan, you remember this. If this is another deception, even if my soul is shattered and my true soul forever falls, I will be your eternal nemesis, never to rest until one of us perishes!"

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan secretly curled his lips, but his face showed no波澜 (waves). He only nodded slightly.

"Agreed."

The agreement was reached, but an无形 (invisible) pressure grew heavier.

Xu Yunfan said no more. With a wave of his sleeve, Sun Wukong's true soul fell into the cultivated dharma body.

The dharma body slowly opened its eyes, revealing a rebellious and桀骜不驯 (unyielding) gaze.

The clone Sun Wukong looked at Xu Yunfan with a complex expression. Having experienced enlightenment and achieved the position of Fighting King Buddha, how could he not know his current situation?

Although his Buddha position was lost, his true soul was immortal, and the protected indestructible golden nature remained undissipated, making him feel that his life was not his own.

For now, he could only believe Xu Yunfan's words.

His gaze turned to the mountain-like pile of spiritual materials and the newly born Cloud Sutra clone. Next, it was time to refine the crucial protective treasure for the journey to the Sea of Bitterness's reincarnation—the Soul-Protection Mystic Mirror.

The Cloud Sutra clone's body was once again surging with Eight Scenery Cloud Qi. Connected in mind with the main body, it would serve as the main hand for controlling the fire and refining the artifact.

Three months later, inside the Divine Thunder Palace.

Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, like living things,缠绕 (entwined) the Soul-Protection Mystic Mirror suspended in mid-air.

This mirror was shaped like an ancient bronze mirror. The frame was inlaid with returning-to-nothing Dao patterns carved from the Soul-Returning Stone. The back of the mirror used the Soul-Nourishing Wood core as its base. The Soul-Stabilizing Pearl, at the mirror's knob, circulated a dark blue star vortex. A wisp of dark golden light, now appearing, now disappearing, was at its core.

It was the passage credential condensed from Sun Wukong's innate indestructible golden nature.

The Cloud Sutra clone's hand seals changed continuously. The Xun Wind Cloud Qi precisely carved the final rune, and the Zhen Thunder Cloud Qi suddenly surged in to activate it.

"It is done."

The main body's sleeve swept out, and the Soul-Protection Mystic Mirror fell into his palm.

The mirror's surface reflected Sun Wukong's monkey face.
