# Chapter 13: Breakthrough! Visualization Upgrade!

The vast lecture hall stood empty, with only Wu Mingyuan remaining inside, silent as a statue.

"Heh~"

Wu Mingyuan suddenly let out a bitter laugh and muttered to himself:

"Only two days left—there's no hope now. Who would've thought that among the four of us, I'd be the only one with a Grade C evaluation? Will Lingyun look down on me because of this?"

"How ironic!"

"It's all Ji Bochang's fault!"

Wu Mingyuan's eyes widened as he roared hoarsely:

"It's all because of his bet that distracted me, making it impossible to master the Visualization Technique within seven days. It's all his fault!"

However—

Wu Mingyuan knew full well that after receiving a Grade B evaluation, Ji Bochang was no longer someone he could provoke. No matter how much resentment he felt, he could only swallow it.

Wait!

"I may not be able to touch Ji Bochang, but that guy Zhang Jing is fair game! What if Ji Bochan finds out and makes trouble for me in the outer sect later?"

That wouldn't be worth it!

After much deliberation, Wu Mingyuan finally realized with frustration that there was nothing he could do—at least not for now.

"Don't be angry, Wu Mingyuan. You mustn't be angry! That Zhang Jing will definitely fail the assessment—it's karma. And who says someone with a Grade C evaluation can't surpass those with Grade B in the future?"

"Temporary outcomes don't determine everything!"

Wu Mingyuan kept comforting himself, yet his heart only grew more agitated.

Clenching his fists, he smashed them hard against the ground.

Bang! Bang!

A sudden knock at the door shattered the silence in the room.

"Who is it?"

Zhang Jing stood up and walked to the stone hut's entrance, asking cautiously.

"Haha, it's me."

"Brother Ji?" Zhang Jing's tense heart relaxed slightly as he slowly opened the door. "It's really you?"

"By the way, I haven't congratulated you yet on earning a Grade B evaluation," Zhang Jing said with a smile inside the room, handing a cup of water to Ji Bochang.

"Haha, congratulations to you too."

Ji Bochang accepted the water, his face beaming with joy.

Opposite him.

"Oh? Congratulations to me?" Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened as he mused, "Could it be about that earlier bet? If so, Brother Ji, you work fast. How did you get him to agree?"

"Just a coincidence," Ji Bochang waved it off before continuing, "I came today mainly to bid farewell, Brother Zhang."

"Farewell?" Zhang Jing was surprised.

"That's right," Ji Bochang nodded firmly. "After the instructor confirmed I'd mastered the Visualization Technique today, he told me someone would take me to select a legacy tomorrow. Then I'll have to stay there to train until the entire assessment is complete before officially entering the outer sect."

"I see."

"Ah, I almost forgot!" Ji Bochang snapped his folding fan shut and smacked his forehead as if suddenly remembering something. "I have something for you."

"What is it?" Zhang Jing asked, puzzled.

"Haha, this."

Ji Bochang pulled out a small pouch from his robes and placed it on the table.

"Inside are five spirit stones—enough for your spirit beast meat needs during this time. Well, it's getting late, so I'll take my leave now."

No sooner had he spoken than Ji Bochang stood up decisively and left without hesitation.

"Brother Ji, I—"

Zhang Jing wanted to say something, but Ji Bochang cut him off.

"Brother Zhang, don't misunderstand—this is an advance on your share. If you really want to thank me, just give me some pointers on my fan designs later."

"Oh, I forgot to mention—I raised the bet to fifty spirit stones. You're about to strike it rich! Of course, that's assuming you weren't lying to me..."

At the door.

Watching Ji Bochang's figure disappear into the night, Zhang Jing couldn't help but feel a surge of gratitude—though what he had meant to say was: Brother Ji, I don't need spirit stones right now.

As for fan design advice...

For Zhang Jing, who had browsed countless designs in his past life, it was child's play.

He could easily whip up something for him—wild if he wanted wild, innocent if he preferred innocence, seductive if he craved seduction...

Closing the door.

Zhang Jing couldn't resist picking up the pouch on the table, pouring the spirit stones into his palm, and examining them closely.

This was his first time seeing spirit stones, and curiosity burned within him.

"So these are the legendary spirit stones worth their weight in gold?"

At first glance.

Zhang Jing realized the stones weren't crystalline as he'd imagined. Instead, they were thumb-sized green cubes with a texture closer to jade, though lacking jade's smooth luster.

They felt icy cold in his hand.

After a while, Zhang Jing reluctantly returned the stones to the pouch and tucked it at his waist.

His gaze sharpened, his expression turning solemn.

"Tonight, I'll practice the Visualization Technique once, then use the Dark Python Devours Emptiness Dao Charm to restore my spirit. Another session tomorrow morning, and the proficiency will be maxed out."

With his plan set, Zhang Jing slowly closed his eyes.

"Mind's Eye!"

[Pure Essence Absorption Visualization Technique · Uninitiated (50/50)]

[Low-Grade Dharma Seed: Mind's Eye (Cannot be upgraded)]

[Dark Python Devours Emptiness Dao Charm · Fragment (Cannot be upgraded)]

On the jade talisman.

The golden characters began to flicker, reflecting in Zhang Jing's dark eyes like burning golden sparks, igniting fervor in his gaze.

Scalding blood surged relentlessly through his organs and every corner of his body.

Burning!

An unbearable heat erupted within Zhang Jing.

Simultaneously.

The tranquil sea of consciousness suddenly churned with towering waves.

Yet now, Zhang Jing had no attention to spare, focusing entirely on the space between his eyebrows.

There, something like a seed seemed to be silently growing, gathering strength, awaiting its moment of transformation.

Time passed second by second.

Finally.

[Pure Essence Absorption Visualization Technique · Level 1 (1/100)]

[Skill Trait: Essence-Gathering Radiance (Low-Grade)]

Crack—

A faint shattering sound echoed in his ears.

The next instant, Zhang Jing felt all resistance at his brow vanish as the seed rapidly took root and sprouted, spreading outward.

An indescribably profound sensation abruptly emerged.

In that moment, beyond his five senses, Zhang Jing gained a new form of perception—one that could both 'see' and 'touch,' tangible yet intangible, existing independently outside his body yet capable of hiding within, utterly miraculous.

"Spiritual Sense!"

Zhang Jing immediately recognized this as one of the hallmarks of mastering the Visualization Technique—Spiritual Sense!

Through this new sense, Zhang Jing 'saw' the familiar spiritual energy—wispy strands, glimmering specks, like light and dew—swirling around him.

Only now had he truly stepped onto the path of cultivation!

His eyes calm as still water, Zhang Jing murmured to himself:

"I thought I'd be overwhelmed with excitement upon mastering the Visualization Technique. But now that the moment has arrived, I realize—"

Tranquility.

His heart was unusually serene.

Not that he wasn't thrilled.

But his gaze had already turned toward horizons far beyond.

Mastering the Visualization Technique was merely an insignificant starting point.

"Ah, the Pure Essence Absorption Visualization Technique reached Level 1 and awakened a skill trait?" Zhang Jing's attention shifted to the jade talisman.
