# Chapter 95: Poison-Resistance Divine Ability

For Wubing, however, no cultivation method could be more suitable than the [Pure Yang Heart Mantra]!

As a demonic creature without orthodox inheritance, relying solely on bloodline power and accumulated cultivation over the years to seek breakthroughs through sheer quantity, any method that could enhance its accumulation and accelerate cultivation was worth pursuing.

Without a clearer path to advancement, accumulating spiritual power through the [Pure Yang Heart Mantra] was its best option.

Wubing continued lurking outside the beehive. With the first bee as its insider, trapping more became increasingly easier.

Soon, the first controlled bee lured another from the hive. Upon reaching Wubing's hiding spot, the unsuspecting bee was subdued and transformed into another vessel for the mantra.

Another puppet secured!

Within three days, Wubing captured six [Gold-Devouring Bees], all implanted with the [Pure Yang Heart Mantra]. The increase in spiritual power was palpable—now two percent of the hive's bees were under its control, and the conversion rate was accelerating.

Han watched the bear corrupting bee after bee with the mantra, finding his own recovery hastened by the spectacle. Seizing the opportunity, he took out the refined [Gold-Devouring Honey] from his alchemy furnace.

The processed honey had condensed to one-tenth its original volume. Holding a portion, it resembled a large jelly. Han devoured it in a few bites, feeling it dissolve instantly into a unique spiritual energy rich in vital essence.

This energy surged toward his liver and spleen, rapidly merging with the organs. Han felt his body greatly nourished, his recovery speed skyrocketing. Soon, the energy fully integrated, forming a layer of mystical runes enveloping both organs.

A new divine ability—[Poison Resistance]—was unlocked.

**[Divine Ability: Poison Resistance]  
[Quality: Rare (Green)]  
[Already at maximum tier for this ability]**

Though a minor ability, its effects were extraordinary: enhancing liver and spleen functions, neutralizing hundreds of poisons, and synergizing perfectly with his [Nectar] ability. With this, Han mastered his tenth divine ability, placing him firmly among the elite of first-tier cultivators.

Among these, two were golden-tier mythical abilities and three purple-tier epic abilities—all major divine techniques capable of supporting breakthroughs to the third tier's longevity threshold, as recorded in the [Ancestral Sect's Compendium of Divine Abilities]. Had the sect elders known the true tiers of Han's abilities, they might have reevaluated his genius.

Yet, only two of his ten abilities—[Thoughtless Slash] and [Primordial Great Seal]—were combat-oriented, a stark contrast to the Thunderclap Monastery's usual focus on offensive techniques (where disciples typically mastered eighty percent attack abilities). Han still had much work to do.

While man and bear camped outside the hive, each pursuing their goals, the [Gold-Devouring Queen Bee] inside feasted on metals delivered by worker bees. A mature, responsible ruler at the peak of the second tier, the queen had noticed an odd surge in her workers' cultivation and intelligence lately, boosting the hive's overall strength.

Suspecting an impending breakthrough, she inspected the enhanced workers but found no anomalies. With no evidence of rare treasures consumed, she attributed it to her own impending ascension.

Then, a worker reported that the newly empowered bees had captured a second-tier [Iron-Eating Beast] and were dragging it toward the hive. Delighted—for these honey-thieving bears were the hive's nemeses—the queen abandoned her meal to investigate.

Outside, she found thirty bees surrounding a motionless giant panda. As she approached, the workers suddenly turned hostile, swarming her. Her usual dominance tactics failed, and in the chaos, the "lifeless" panda lunged. A single paw struck her head.

Though unharmed physically, a strange energy from the blow infiltrated her consciousness. To onlookers, the queen shuddered briefly before falling eerily still. Under cover of his controlled bees, Wubing fled.

An hour later, the queen revived and returned to the hive as if nothing happened. Unbeknownst to all, the colony now had a hidden master.

Han, now mostly recovered, marveled at Wubing's cunning. This luck-blessed, adaptable bear was proving invaluable. Empowered by its first second-tier mantra vessel, Wubing's mastery of the technique reached new heights.

Testing its control, Wubing directed the queen to transfer the mantra to another worker. Without resistance, the bee accepted the energy, twitching as it became another puppet. The silent takeover was complete.
