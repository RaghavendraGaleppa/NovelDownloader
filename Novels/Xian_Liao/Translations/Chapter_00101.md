# Chapter 101: Demon Seeding

The people in the grand hall expected a world-shaking battle to erupt at any moment.

Yet Zhang Jingxiu could sense Zhou Qing's calm composure.

He remembered Fusong mentioning how, when Zhou Qing was still weak and powerless, he had assassinated the son of a local gentry in Jiangzhou. After the deed, Zhou Qing had returned home, quietly taken a nap, and then gone to take the provincial examinations.

From that moment, Fusong knew Zhou Qing was no ordinary man.

Now, Zhang Jingxiu observed that Zhou Qing's demeanor was remarkably similar to what Fusong had described—utterly composed even in the face of life-and-death battles.

This wasn't carelessness but supreme confidence born from complete mastery of the situation. It wasn't blind arrogance but a higher level of strategic awareness.

Zhou Qing waited until the Tiger Slaughtering Sutra reached its peak before striking.

The old monk had also finished digesting his gains and was at his strongest.

Zhou Qing clenched his five fingers together as if drawing all the air from the hall into his palm, gathering an unstoppable gale of energy.

With a thunderous boom, he struck!

Zhou Qing's attack erupted with clouds of energy, his movements sending shockwaves through the air. His entire being radiated divine majesty, like a deity walking among mortals.

The final palm strike landed with the force of a thunderclap.

Heartfire Thunder erupted!

Palms of Thunder!

Crimson lightning exploded from Zhou Qing's hands, terrifying in its intensity.

The old monk's previously calm and indifferent eyes suddenly flashed with disbelief. He had transformed into an asura, absorbing the flesh and essence of an entire temple's devotees to break through the Heavenly Gate and reach an unimaginable state.

But Zhou Qing's Palms of Thunder struck him down from his lofty perch.

Terror!

Absolute terror gripped the old monk, who had believed himself beyond life and death. Zhou Qing's Palms of Thunder filled him with despair, as if they would erase his very existence from the world.

Even the merged King of Light felt this despair. While Zhou Qing's Tiger Slaughtering Sutra hadn't been enough to instill fear, the Palms of Thunder, with their innate suppression of ghostly paths, were far more terrifying.

Simultaneously, Zhou Qing's yang energy exploded forth, combining with the Palms of Thunder to make him appear like a deity commanding lightning—sacred, solemn, yet free and unrestrained.

The ground within a dozen zhang shattered instantly, and a terrifying shockwave erupted from the epicenter where Zhou Qing and the old monk stood. Many onlookers were slammed against the walls of the hall by the force.

Zhou Qing transformed his palm into a hammer, relentlessly pounding the old monk into the ground until half his body was buried.

The terrifying power of Heartfire Thunder penetrated deep into the old monk's body, suppressing both the King of Light's ghostly energy and the old monk's own life force.

The old monk's eyes filled with despair and unwillingness.

But Zhou Qing gave him no chance for a final struggle.

Facing such a formidable opponent, Zhou Qing wouldn't allow any last-ditch suicidal techniques.

"Morning Sun," Zhou Qing called softly.

The rooster appeared, its sharp claws tearing through the old monk's scalp as flames spewed from its beak, relentlessly burning the monk. A demonic shadow flickered within the flames, but it had already suffered Zhou Qing's devastating blows and couldn't withstand Morning Sun's fire.

As the flames roared around Zhou Qing, the bloodstains on his body were burned away, leaving his robes pristine.

Outside, the lamas of the Tiger King Temple and the Peacock King Temple watched Zhou Qing bathed in flames, a ludicrous thought crossing their minds:

"Is this man the true King of Light?"

Zhou Qing swept his gaze over the lamas and the Central Plains' martial heroes, speaking calmly, "From this day forth, any in the Snowy Peaks who dare worship ghosts and demons will share this temple's fate."

...

"An earth-shattering event—Zhou Zhenren has conquered the Snowy Peaks!"

"They say Zhang Zhenren fought the King of Light but was no match, so Zhou Zhenren intervened, using the Daoist secret technique of Five Thunders Striking the Top to level the Diamond Temple."

"Legend has it that with a single utterance from Zhou Zhenren, hundreds of lamas in the Diamond Temple were all liberated."

"Zhang Zhenren reportedly sighed, saying that while he might be the world's number one, Zhou Zhenren belongs to the heavens."

"Zhou Zhenren sits alone atop the clouds, gazing down at the mortal world—truly as lonely as snow."

"We ordinary folk may never glimpse Zhou Zhenren's divine visage, but the Taihe Sect welcomes talents. Perhaps we might receive a word or two of guidance from Zhang Zhenren."

"As for the Dao Court's immortal envoys, Zhou Zhenren stands supreme. With the Two Elders of Qingfu and Zhang Zhenren's disciples from the Taihe Sect, all major affairs of the world truly lie within Zhou Zhenren's grasp."

News also spread about the new innate master Xiao Ruowang, who had undergone his heavenly tribulation at Qingfu Palace.

This caused an even greater stir among various factions.

Not only did it signify the birth of another innate master, but it also lent further credence to the legends of the Dao Court's immortal envoys.

Zhou Zhenren truly could help others achieve the innate realm!

The Ascension Token!

Zhou Qing's name spread like that of a living deity, while the other four innate masters seemed far more human in comparison.

...

"Some men become gods while still alive." Zhang Jingxiu and Zhou Qing didn't hurry to leave the Snowy Peaks. After this battle, the esoteric sect's accumulated resources fell entirely into the Dao Court's hands.

Zhou Qing rolled his eyes. "You're elevating me to godhood so you can claim the title of world's number one."

He saw right through Zhang's scheme.

Zhang Jingxiu smiled. "What use is being number one in the world to you? Rather than having you deal with challengers, it's better if I handle them. I've cultivated fist intent—truthfully, in this world, I'm second only to you."

...

The more abundant the spiritual energy, the more likely it is to give rise to powerful and terrifying anomalies.

If the red python and demon crane from before had grown in places with incredibly rich spiritual energy, they would have been far stronger. The physical talents of demonic beasts far surpass those of humans.

"Take Morning Sun, for example—born with extraordinary gifts, it awakened the bloodline ability of Solar True Flames immediately. For a human to achieve Solar True Flames through cultivation, they'd need to at least be an innate master."

If Zhou Qing fed Morning Sun enough elixirs, he had no doubt Zhang Jingxiu would no longer be a match for the rooster.

How many demonic beasts possessed such extraordinary talents?

Even if rare, demonic beasts clearly had an easier path to reaching innate levels than humans.

Moreover, there were cases of demons growing stronger by devouring flesh and blood.

"Regardless, improving one's own strength is the true path to power."

Zhou Qing immersed himself fully in cultivation, and another year passed in the blink of an eye.

The five innate masters held their annual gathering.

"Aside from Ruowang, we've all hit cultivation bottlenecks we can't overcome for now," Zhang Jingxiu sighed softly.

"The main issue is that after taking the same elixir seven or eight times, its effects diminish significantly, and the accumulated toxins increase," Fushan added.

Zhang Jingxiu said, "I'm considering trying the Demon Seeding and Rebirth Art to refine the Great Pine."

He shared his thoughts.

Zhou Qing replied, "We'll have to try it eventually. Let's study the Demon Seeding and Rebirth Art together first—I'll go first."

Zhou Qing decided to use the technique to deepen his connection with the Great Mulberry Tree—not to refine it, but as an experiment.

The more he cultivated, the more he felt an invisible constraint limiting his physical body—a limitation inherent to his species.

Even among ordinary humans, innate differences in physical strength existed between men and women.

Breaking through to the innate realm shattered the body's limits but didn't necessarily transcend the constraints of one's species. The Demon Seeding and Rebirth Art was clearly an ancient attempt to use demons to break through humanity's natural limitations.

Moreover, all the demons Zhou Qing had encountered so far were wood-attribute spirits, making him suspect that the demons in this mortal realm might be the products of some ancient cultivator's experiments.

If Zhang Jingxiu encountered problems during cultivation, it would be difficult to correct.

With his powerful spiritual sense and years of connection with the Great Mulberry Tree, Zhou Qing could easily withdraw at the first sign of trouble.

But first, the five needed to thoroughly study the Demon Seeding and Rebirth Art together.

This was also because Zhou Qing clearly realized how incredibly difficult it was to cultivate Heartfire Thunder—it seemed not meant for normal humans at all.

After their discussion, Zhou Qing produced the Demon Seeding and Rebirth Art for them all to study.

"Back to Jiangzhou."

Zhou Qing and Morning Sun took to the air, spotting Zhang Jingxiu heading toward Mount Taihe. Zhou Qing transmitted his voice, "Brother Dao, need a lift?"

Zhang Jingxiu pretended not to hear. He vowed to use elixirs to reach the fourth level of qi refinement, even if it delayed his body refinement progress.

This was just too humiliating!

...

Upon returning to Jiangzhou, Lin Wan'er also came back from the capital.

Zhou Qing examined her and smiled. "The Marrow-Cleansing Pills worked well. From now on, I'll use thunder resonance to cleanse your organs monthly. In a few years, you might directly begin qi refinement. With more Blood Qi Pills, you should reach the first level of body refinement, ensuring you live to at least 140."

Lin Wan'er was delighted. "Then I can follow you for over a hundred more years."

Zhou Qing said, "Don't think about that. What matters in life is the present moment."

Without achieving immortality, a hundred or even a thousand years would be but a blink in the vast river of time. Pursuing immortality was like trying to scoop the moon from water.

But having set this goal, the difficulty became secondary—persistence was key.

This path had only success or failure; its hardships were irrelevant.

If he failed and death came, there would be no regrets.

Zhou Qing then summoned Butcher Hu and gave him some Marrow-Cleansing Pills.

After handling mundane affairs, Zhou Qing checked Yuan Mingyue's cultivation progress.

"Mingyue, I didn't expect your talent for the Spring Return Talisman Canon to be so remarkable. From now on, you may enter the herb garden whenever you wish. Its vibrant vitality and richer spiritual energy will aid your cultivation. I hope you'll successfully undergo the heavenly tribulation."

"Master, I will definitely succeed—I won't fail." She rarely spoke with such certainty, but regarding the heavenly tribulation, she was uncharacteristically resolute.

Zhou Qing was surprised. "You're not usually like this. Why the sudden determination?"

Yuan Mingyue replied, "Because cultivating under your guidance has been carefree. I wish to continue this life indefinitely."

"You never go out—don't you find this dull?"

Yuan Mingyue said, "Actually, I don't enjoy traveling much. Having a stable place to pursue what I love brings me peace. Though... I do miss my father sometimes."

Zhou Qing nodded. "Visit him annually to fulfill your filial duties. You should have told me earlier if you missed him."

"That was my fault. I became too absorbed in cultivation and array studies, reluctant to leave."

Zhou Qing felt a pang of emotion and sighed softly. "Don't blame yourself. The young see only the vast world ahead, rarely what's before them."

He then entered the herb garden and approached the Great Mulberry Tree.

The tree was utterly transformed from nine years ago—as was Zhou Qing himself.

Collecting his thoughts, he began cultivating the Great Sun Tathagata True Flames, which aided both alchemy and Heartfire Thunder cultivation.

As Zhou Qing visualized the Tathagata's dharma nature from the portrait, he gradually became immersed.

In a daze, he found himself in an unknown land.

A great sun hung over a desolate sky. Unconsciously, Zhou Qing merged with this sun, gazing down upon the mortal world.

He saw humans treated as prey by demons, witnessed monstrous beasts dominating the land, and watched cultivators desperately battling demons and beasts.

There were body refiners, qi refiners, and powerful cultivators commanding spirits or merging with demons to fight.

Yet no true sanctuary existed.

Demons and beasts were innately stronger than humans.

A rooster's crow startled Zhou Qing awake.

There was no true Great Sun Tathagata—or perhaps it was a figment of desperate human imagination.

Was this the Snowy Peaks' past?

Eons had turned wilderness into snowy peaks.

"With spiritual energy's resurgence, the greatest beneficiaries aren't humans but demons and beasts. They'll grow ever stronger and more numerous, squeezing humanity's living space."

Zhou Qing wondered if the world's spiritual energy had been deliberately sealed. This would have caused powerful demons and beasts to weaken over time, allowing humans to gain dominance.

Now, as spiritual energy returned—still sparse—and with people like him around, the newly awakened demons and beasts were far weaker than their ancient counterparts.

Instead, they served as cultivation resources to empower him.

Master Jingyang had been a pioneer.

"It's like protection for a beginner's village." Zhou Qing had an inkling.

Why the protection?

Because the outside world was far more terrifying.

Master Jingyang's map had five trials—perhaps a form of screening. Did he believe only those who passed all five were worthy of inheriting his cave abode?

It wasn't that simple.

"The broader cultivation world likely holds even greater dangers." Zhou Qing began forming judgments about external cultivation realms.

The danger probably didn't come from humans but from demons, beasts, and possibly worse.

The more abundant the spiritual energy, the more likely powerful anomalies would emerge.

Had the red python and demon crane grown in energy-rich environments, they'd have been far stronger. Demonic beasts' physical talents far surpassed humans'.

"Morning Sun, for instance, was born with Solar True Flames, while humans would need innate mastery to achieve the same."

If Zhou Qing fed Morning Sun enough elixirs, Zhang Jingxiu might no longer be a match.

How many such gifted beasts existed?

Even if rare, demonic beasts clearly had an easier path to innate levels than humans.

Moreover, some demons grew stronger by consuming flesh and blood.

"Regardless, improving one's own strength is paramount."

Zhou Qing devoted himself fully to cultivation, and another year slipped by.

At the five innate masters' annual gathering:

"Aside from Ruowang, we've all hit bottlenecks we can't overcome," Zhang Jingxiu sighed.

"After taking the same elixir seven or eight times, its effects diminish, and toxins accumulate," Fushan added.

Zhang Jingxiu said, "I want to try the Demon Seeding and Rebirth Art on the Great Pine."

Zhou Qing replied, "We'll have to try eventually. Let's study it together—I'll go first."

He planned to use the technique to deepen his connection with the Great Mulberry Tree—not to refine it, but as an experiment.

The more he cultivated, the more he felt his physical limitations—constraints inherent to humanity.

Even among ordinary humans, innate physical differences existed between genders.

Breaking through to the innate realm shattered bodily limits but didn't transcend species constraints. The Demon Seeding and Rebirth Art was clearly an ancient attempt to use demons to overcome human limitations.

All demons Zhou Qing had encountered were wood-attribute spirits, making him suspect they might be products of some ancient cultivator's experiments.

If Zhang Jingxiu encountered problems, correction would be difficult.

With his powerful spiritual sense and long connection with the Great Mulberry Tree, Zhou Qing could withdraw at the first sign of trouble.

But first, the five needed to thoroughly study the technique together.

This was also because Zhou Qing found cultivating Heartfire Thunder incredibly difficult—it seemed not meant for normal humans.

After their discussion, Zhou Qing produced the Demon Seeding and Rebirth Art for joint study.

"Back to Jiangzhou."

As Zhou Qing and Morning Sun flew, they spotted Zhang Jingxiu returning to Mount Taihe. Zhou Qing transmitted, "Need a lift?"

Zhang Jingxiu pretended not to hear, vowing to reach the fourth level of qi refinement through elixirs, even if it delayed his body refinement.

This was just too humiliating!
