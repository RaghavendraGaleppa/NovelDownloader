# Chapter 14: Triple Divine Abilities

The entire space was engulfed by white divine radiance. The human had nowhere to dodge. He clenched his hands into fists, slamming them hard against his chest. An inexplicable shockwave spread out, shattering all the white divine radiance that came into contact with it. However, this was only a small portion; more white divine radiance surged forward, forming a sea of light.

The sea of light enveloped the man, his pitch-black figure strikingly conspicuous within it. Though tiny, he remained unyielding.

As the sea of light dissipated, the man's body reappeared. His originally dark body was now covered in streaks of purple patterns.

"Double Flesh Reinforcement!" Zhou Tian exclaimed in surprise. Although he didn't cultivate and hadn't delved much into such matters, he had received basic education and understood some things about it.

The Triple-Treasury Realm was almost universally considered a crucial cultivation stage. At this realm, one could develop three divine abilities from within oneself. These three divine abilities would accompany a cultivator throughout their life and grow stronger as their own strength increased.

Through the research of countless predecessors, the technique of Divine Ability Combination was also developed. However, this came with a prerequisite: only divine abilities of the same attribute and type could be combined. For example, the person who controlled lightning in that sixty-victory arena match had divine abilities that were all offensive and lightning-attributed, allowing them to combine into a much more formidable skill. Their opponent, however, could not combine theirs; though both were earth-attributed, one was defensive and the other offensive, so they couldn't be merged.

Double Divine Abilities meant developing two identical divine abilities, which would then be amplified to an incredibly powerful degree—not a simple one-plus-one effect, but almost a tenfold increase. Such a feat was exceedingly rare, not merely achievable through talent or resources, but largely dependent on luck.

The human on the field clearly possessed two Flesh Reinforcement divine abilities, so much so that it manifested the "Purple Mark" physical anomaly, an unusual phenomenon that only appeared when the physical body was strengthened to a certain extent.

"Haha..." Zhou Xunchuan chuckled proudly, then said, "Keep watching."

It seemed there was still some surprise to behold.

...

The human on the field frowned slightly, his aura surging. Runes surfaced on his skin, and the sparse purple patterns gradually covered his entire body, strengthening his physical form to a terrifying degree. Simply standing still, the space around him couldn't bear it and cracked like glass.

Yet, this wasn't enough. The man, now entirely purple, let out a low roar. A hundred-meter-tall figure appeared behind him, just as purple and incredibly solid. Its muscles were menacing, imbued with boundless power—this was his Dharma Idol!

Meanwhile, the Celestial Race member's expression had already changed. What was wrong with this person? How long had they been fighting, and he was already unleashing his ultimate move? This wasn't how it was supposed to go!

However, he couldn't afford to think too much. Golden energy enveloped his body, even his wings were dyed gold. A remarkably solid wing appeared behind him, stretching nearly a hundred meters wide, golden-yellow and lifelike. Golden divine light flowed along every single feather.

"Ah!"

The human roared, and his hundred-meter Dharma Idol soared into the sky. The earth beneath was utterly shattered, revealing the grand formation operating underneath.

He clenched his palm into a fist, and without any flashy phenomena, he simply threw a punch. The very sky shattered like glass.

The Celestial Race member's golden runes surged skyward. The golden-winged Dharma Idol behind him folded together, its edges becoming incredibly sharp, transforming into a bizarrely shaped weapon.

The golden wing struck the purple giant, leaving only a shallow white mark. The giant roared, grabbing the golden wing with both hands, and savagely ripped. With a crisp sound, the golden wing shattered, dissolving into a rain of light that scattered across the heavens and earth.

The Celestial Race member opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blue blood, his face as pale as paper. He began to fall to the ground, but before he could land, a spatial fluctuation shimmered, and he vanished mid-air. The arena had already determined that he no longer possessed the strength to fight.

All of this happened in an instant; the battle was over in a flash.

Zhou Tian looked at Zhou Xunchuan beside him with slight admiration. "Triple Flesh Reinforcement divine ability, Third Brother, your eye for talent is truly sharp."

Zhou Xunchuan looked quite pleased. He hadn't expected the person he'd favored to end the battle so decisively, which certainly gave him face. "I observed him in the arena for a long time before I discovered such a talent. Now, even Father King will envy me for quite a while! Alright... alright... no more chatting, I need to go recruit him quickly. Brother Tian, until next time..." With that, he hastily departed with his guards.

Zhou Tian shook his head with a smile and turned to Tian Ling, who was still lost in thought. She only snapped back to attention when Zhou Tian waved his hands in front of her face.

"Quite an exciting battle, wasn't it?" Zhou Tian asked her.

"Mm," Tian Ling nodded, her eyes still a little unfocused. She lowered her head and murmured, "It was indeed spectacular. I've never seen anything like it at our Vast Sky Sect!"

What truly shocked her wasn't the battle itself, but the attitudes of Zhou Tian and Zhou Xunchuan. Zhou Tian was alright, but Zhou Xunchuan was too obvious. He carried himself with an air of superiority, his gaze unwavering while watching the fight, as if the combatants weren't two experts of the Dharma Idol Realm, but rather two ordinary people squabbling, completely beneath his notice. His eventual delight was merely because that man had given him ample face in front of Zhou Tian.

If not for her status as Zhou Tian's fiancée, Zhou Xunchuan probably wouldn't have even spared her a glance.

"Alright, let's go. There aren't any other battles worth watching here today. I'll take you to see other places." Zhou Tian said to her.

"Mm." Tian Ling nodded, still a little distracted.

Zhou Tian didn't think much of it, assuming she was still immersed in the recent battle. He naturally took her hand and led her out.

Tian Ling offered a symbolic resistance, then allowed him to hold her hand.

Outside the arena's gate, a carriage awaited them. The two boarded it and departed.

Time passed quickly, and evening arrived in the blink of an eye. The two returned to Prince Qin's residence in their carriage.

Throughout the afternoon, Zhou Tian had taken Tian Ling on a thorough tour of the imperial capital, finally ending up at the Dance Heaven Pavilion for a Sacred Beast Feast. All the ingredients were sourced from Saint-level fierce beasts. Zhou Tian, unable to sense spiritual energy at all, could only appreciate the delicious taste. Tian Ling, on the other hand, glowed and sweated profusely from the meal, her clothes almost soaked through. The alluring outline of her figure through the damp fabric was certainly a feast for his eyes, prompting him to secretly decide to bring Tian Ling here more often in the future, even if one meal cost nearly a million spiritual stones.

After this day, their relationship had grown significantly closer. After all, with Emperor Qin's bestowed marriage, they were certainly going to wed in the future, and both were diligently working to accept each other.

However, Tian Ling's face remained flushed from the evening meal. After escorting her to her residence, Zhou Tian hummed a little tune as he returned to his own room.

And just as Zhou Tian returned to Prince Qin's residence, a message, having overcome countless difficulties, was transmitted out of the imperial city. It contained only five words:

"Zhou Tian is still alive!"
