# Chapter 42: Forced Into Battle

The battle around the cold pond intensified as the innate masters, cunning veterans that they were, targeted the weakest link—the blue-skirted young woman at the early Qi Refining stage. This forced Immortal Master Nan to divide his attention, roaring in frustration.

Finally unable to bear it any longer, he retrieved a palm-sized yellow talisman from his waist pouch. The moment he activated it with spiritual energy, a transparent yellow barrier rose from beneath his feet, encasing him like an eggshell.

Swords and sabers striking the barrier were all repelled with loud clangs, leaving the innate masters stunned.

"You refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit! Mere mortals—I've endured you long enough!" Immortal Master Nan's face twisted with visible pain as he used the precious talisman.

Now protected by the yellow barrier, he abandoned defense and went all-out on offense. His golden spear whirled like a windmill, driving the innate martial artists into retreat. His sister, the blue-skirted girl, took advantage by producing a red stone, absorbing its spiritual energy while launching fireballs.

The siblings quickly regained the upper hand.

Watching from the forest, Lin Shan's eyes burned with envy. "Are those... talismans and spirit stones? Real cultivators indeed—unlike me with just my Wind Blade technique."

The battlefield situation suddenly shifted.

Unrestrained, Immortal Master Nan wielded his golden spear with deadly precision. No innate master could withstand a single strike—each thrust meant certain death. After eliminating several opponents, he focused on one of the leaders—Patriarch Hong.

As Patriarch Hong dodged a fireball, the golden spear shot forth like lightning, impaling him five meters away before he could react.

The innate masters gasped as they watched Patriarch Hong convulse, futilely trying to pull out the spear. From a distance, Immortal Master Nan clenched his fist.


"Scatter!" 

The golden spear dissolved into energy, then fragmented into a dozen blades that shredded Patriarch Hong's body mercilessly.

A collective hiss ran through the spectators. Seeing Immortal Master Nan deploy a talisman, slaughter multiple innate masters, then execute Patriarch Hong chilled them to the bone.

The remaining dozen innate masters hesitated, eyeing Immortal Master Nan warily. As the yellow barrier flickered and faded, he carefully stored the talisman back in his pouch, wincing at its expenditure.

Seeing him weaponless and talisman-less, the innate masters grew restless. But golden light flashed as an identical spear materialized in his hand, while his sister regained vigor from the spirit stone.

Though they knew letting the siblings recover was tactical suicide, the memory of Patriarch Hong's gruesome death paralyzed them with fear.

Amidst the surrounding clashes, an eerie stillness enveloped the high-level combatants—until a black figure burst from the trees!

Jiang the Protector's sword gleamed like a falling star, its tempered steel reflecting the sunset as it stabbed toward Immortal Master Nan's flank.

Lin Shan groaned inwardly. This reckless fool, thinking himself equal to a cultivator, was charging to his death against a mid-Qi Refining expert!

Immortal Master Nan blocked effortlessly, sending Jiang flying before thrusting for the kill. As the innate masters hesitated, Lin Shan knew his observer role had ended.

Just as the spear was about to pierce Jiang, a three-foot wind blade shot from the forest. Distracted, Immortal Master Nan barely intercepted it—then a second blade targeted his sister!

Feinting east to strike west!

He shattered the second blade but took a grazing hit to his waist from the first.

"Aaargh!" Blood soaked his yellow robe as he clutched the wound.

"Brother!" The girl abandoned her recovery to slap a green talisman on his injury, stopping the bleeding though his pallor revealed severe damage.

"Who dares ambush me? Show yourself!" Immortal Master Nan roared through gritted teeth. The Vermilion Fruit was non-negotiable—he'd kill anyone in his way.

A young man's voice echoed from the trees: "I'm assisting you. Attack now or never!"

Dozens of wind blades rained down, forcing the siblings into desperate defense. Seeing their vulnerability, the innate masters exchanged glances.

"Kick them when they're down!"

They swarmed the wounded pair.

Meanwhile, Lin Shan kept shifting positions while launching precise wind blades. In the contest for immortality, there was no right or wrong—only opportunity.

This Vermilion Fruit could aid cultivation—he couldn't let it slip away. Cultivation meant defying heaven itself; without struggle, how could one ascend? Coming to Dongting Lake meant only one could leave with the prize.

His earlier intervention—saving Jiang while wounding Immortal Master Nan—had been calculated. By remaining hidden and bombarding with twenty-plus wind blades, he'd manipulated the innate masters into attacking.

As predicted, seeing the siblings overwhelmed, they seized the chance.

Immortal Master Nan barely blocked a wind blade when the Chief Constable of Jingxiang's saber aura struck. As he parried, the Nightingale Branch Leader's sword darted for his wounded side. His sister dispersed that attack with a fireball, only to face a fist strike and another wind blade from the trees.

Soon both siblings bore multiple injuries.

After prolonged combat, Immortal Master Nan finally activated another yellow talisman, summoning the protective barrier.

But the attackers simply redirected all attacks—swords, fists, even wind blades—toward his sister.

"YOU COWARDS!" His enraged scream echoed across the island.
