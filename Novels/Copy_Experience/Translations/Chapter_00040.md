## Chapter 40: High-Grade Talisman Master (Two-in-One)

The Nine-Leaf Talisman Master was one of the few high-grade talisman masters in Heavenly Gate City, skilled at crafting various first-grade high-grade talismans, including Wind Screen Talismans and Ice Spear Talismans.

He operated a shop called Nine-Leaf Hall, specifically for selling talismans. However, it was usually his apprentices who handled affairs at the Nine-Leaf Hall. The old talisman master himself lived in seclusion year-round, making him difficult for outsiders to meet.

Lu Xu spent a full three spirit stones to acquire information regarding the old talisman master’s whereabouts.

There was a restaurant in Heavenly Gate City called Immortal Delicacy Restaurant, which specialized in providing high-end cuisine for cultivators. A single meal there cost at least twenty spirit stones, an exorbitant price that few in the entire city could afford. Clearly, this was an upscale establishment that catered at least to mid-Qi Condensation cultivators.

According to the intelligence Lu Xu purchased, the Nine-Leaf Talisman Master regularly rewarded himself with a visit to this Immortal Delicacy Restaurant on the ninth day of every month.

"Isn't this just like my past life? After working hard for a while, I'd always go out for a big meal with my good brothers!"

"This person certainly knows how to enjoy life!" Lu Xu mused.

He wound through several streets in Heavenly Gate City before arriving at a secluded spot. Facing the street stood a tall, exquisite building, clearly not a place ordinary people could afford. The rich aroma wafting from within, carried on wisps of smoke, made one's mouth water, stirring a gluttonous urge.

At the restaurant's entrance, two beautiful first-level Qi Condensation maidens greeted every passing cultivator with sweet smiles and respectful curtsies. When they saw Lu Xu approach, the two maidens immediately curtsied in unison. One of them asked in a soft, sweet voice:

"Immortal Delicacy Restaurant welcomes you, Fellow Daoist. May I ask if you have a VIP jade token?"

"No," Lu Xu replied.

"Then Fellow Daoist might consider obtaining VIP status. Afterwards, you can enjoy a 10% discount at our Immortal Delicacy Restaurant, for only a yearly..."

Hearing this, Lu Xu's head began to ache. "Damn it, why does every place want you to sign up for a membership?"

He quickly refused with a few words, then followed the maiden into the Immortal Delicacy Restaurant. Despite the refusal, the maiden's expression remained unchanged, still beaming with a smile. She led Lu Xu upstairs to the second floor, brought him to a table, then bowed again and withdrew.

Immediately, someone else approached, handing Lu Xu a jade tablet. Vivid patterns were carved upon it, accompanied by textual descriptions.

"Fellow Daoist, these are the dishes from our Immortal Delicacy Restaurant. You can choose according to your preference, but I highly recommend you consider our set meals!"

"What's special about these set meals?" Lu Xu asked, looking at the jade tablet.

"We have two types of set meals: the Exquisite Set Meal, which includes two dishes, a bowl of Purple Gourd Spirit Rice, and a cup of Green Bamboo Spirit Wine..."

Listening to the person's endless introduction, Lu Xu's gaze fell upon the set meals listed on the jade tablet. The Exquisite Set Meal cost twenty-five spirit stones per serving, most of its ingredients being first-grade mid-grade spirit food. According to the jade tablet, consuming one Exquisite Set Meal was equivalent to eating a Qi Nourishing Pill.

Above the Exquisite Set Meal was the Immortal-Grade Set Meal, costing fifty spirit stones per serving. These were mostly first-grade high-grade ingredients, and the food essence contained within was equivalent to a Qi Gathering Pill. A Qi Gathering Pill was a first-grade high-grade medicinal pill, the best pill to assist late-Qi Condensation cultivators in improving their cultivation, with each pill valued at thirty spirit stones.

Those who could prepare such delicacies were called Spirit Chefs. Spirit Chefs were also considered one of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation, and they were even rarer than alchemists! Some Spirit Chefs were even more formidable than alchemists! After all, creating delicious dishes with effects comparable to medicinal pills was not something just anyone could do.

It was said that when the art of Spirit Cuisine reached profound depths, it could even concoct delicacies that, after a single taste, could cause one to break through their current realm. However, such a high-level chef was nowhere to be found in the entire Wei Kingdom.

Lu Xu ordered a twenty-five spirit stone Exquisite Set Meal.

After a while, several attendants brought up the exquisite dishes. There were two main courses. The first was Azure Jade Soup, served in a large white jade porcelain bowl, with an azure carp over a foot long lying within. Hot steam wafted up, and the rich aroma was incredibly appetizing. Azure Jade Soup was made from Azure Jade Carp, a first-grade mid-grade demonic beast produced in Azure Lake. Azure Lake was a richly endowed place with countless demonic beasts, and Azure Jade Carp was considered a rather inexpensive demonic beast. More precious fish, such as Red-Veined Dragon Carp and Azure Jade Dragon Carp, which greatly benefited a cultivator's physical body and cultivation after consumption, could fetch much higher prices.

The second dish was a plate of Rock Horn Boar meat. This was a first-grade mid-grade demonic beast that lived in the Myriad Demon Mountain Range, its meat was delicious and its flesh contained abundant essence. Besides these two dishes, the remaining bowl of Purple Gourd Spirit Rice and cup of Green Bamboo Spirit Wine were both first-grade mid-grade items.

If these items fell into the hands of ordinary people, consuming them would not have much effect, at most increasing some vitality. However, when handled by a Spirit Chef, they could be transformed into spirit food comparable to Qi Nourishing Pills through the use of various spirit herbs and special techniques.

Not only did they possess the most delicious taste in the world, but they could also enhance cultivation. This was much more satisfying than merely dryly consuming medicinal pills. Since stepping into the cultivation world, Lu Xu had been casual about his diet, only meeting the most basic needs. How could he have ever tasted such immortal delicacies?

He immediately picked up a piece of fish with his chopsticks and began to devour it. As the fish entered his mouth, he instantly felt a deliciousness that penetrated his soul, stimulating every cell in his body to dance with joy.

"What kind of life have I been living before? It was too hard! Once my cultivation improves in the future, I must replicate the Spirit Chef's experience, then raise a group of beautiful maids and have them cook such grand meals for me every day!"

While fantasizing about his wonderful future life, Lu Xu transformed into a glutton, rapidly devouring the spirit food. However, while enjoying the meal, he didn't forget to constantly pay attention to the staircase.

After waiting for about a quarter of an hour, Lu Xu's eyes lit up. He finally saw the person he had been waiting for.

"Consistent with the description, this is the Nine-Leaf Talisman Master!"

After confirming the other party's identity, Lu Xu immediately muttered inwardly: "Check Talisman Dao experience!"

After a flash of green light, a line of text appeared before his eyes:

"[First-Grade High-Grade Talisman Master: 13/100 (10x)]"

"Ten times? That means I need 130 replication points!"

The Azure Stone Stele still had 239 replication points remaining, which was more than enough. Lu Xu immediately whispered in his heart: "Replicate!"

The next moment, after a flash of green light, countless Talisman Dao experiences poured into him like a vast, surging river. In an instant, Lu Xu was enveloped by an immense amount of Talisman Dao experience, and he strenuously digested it all. It was a long while before Lu Xu finished organizing this surge of Talisman Dao experience. At this moment, he had silently transformed into an experienced first-grade high-grade talisman master.

He swept the delicious immortal food off the table like a whirlwind, then immediately left the Immortal Delicacy Restaurant. Back at his residence, Lu Xu sat cross-legged and introspected the Azure Stone Stele:

[Name: Lu Xu]
[Lifespan: 27/126]
[Cultivation: Sixth-level Qi Condensation]
[Spirit Root: Wood (Mid-Inferior)]
[Cultivation Method: Azurewood Art (Great Perfection): 1000/1000]
[Replication Points: 109]

[Skill – Alchemy]:
First-Grade Low-Grade Alchemist: 91/100
First-Grade Mid-Grade Alchemist: 47/100 (3x)

[Skill – Talisman Crafting]:
First-Grade Low-Grade Talisman Master: 74/100
First-Grade Mid-Grade Talisman Master: 42/100 (3x)
First-Grade High-Grade Talisman Master: 13/100 (10x)

[Skill – Spells]:

"Indeed, it's just as before. Once I replicate high-grade experience, the lower-grade experience also increases accordingly!"

"This means my success rate for crafting first-grade mid-grade talismans has soared to 40%, and for low-grade talismans, it's 70%!"

"I should take this opportunity to craft more first-grade mid-grade talismans. Amassing a large quantity of talismans will ensure my safety!"

"Also, I only have eight hundred spirit stones now, and two hundred of those are those two mid-grade spirit stones. Excluding those two, I only have six hundred usable spirit stones!"

"I need to earn some spirit stones quickly!"

Now that Lu Xu had mastered both alchemy and talisman crafting, he could earn a large amount of spirit stones from both. However, after some deliberation, Lu Xu still chose the old path of talisman crafting rather than alchemy to earn spirit stones. This was because he had no sales channels for alchemy. Although his alchemy experience was high, to outsiders, he was just a novice. Lu Xu himself would never dare to buy pills from novices or small shops, nor could he expect others to buy his pills without hesitation.

Therefore, expanding customer sources and opening sales channels would undoubtedly be a very troublesome and time-consuming matter. A bottle of pills he refined might sit there for a month or two without being sold. Although from a long-term perspective, once his reputation was established, the income from alchemy would certainly exceed that from talisman crafting, in the short term, it could not quickly gather funds for Lu Xu. Moreover, a greater reputation would immediately bring greater risks, and Lu Xu did not want too many people to notice him.

So he still chose the old routine. Having made up his mind, Lu Xu immediately went out and purchased a large quantity of talisman paper. First-grade low-grade talisman paper cost one spirit stone for forty sheets, and first-grade mid-grade talisman paper cost one spirit stone for ten sheets. He bought two hundred sheets of first-grade mid-grade talisman paper and one thousand six hundred sheets of first-grade low-grade talisman paper, spending a total of sixty spirit stones.

After bringing all these talisman papers back, Lu Xu resumed his life of talisman crafting. The courtyard gate was tightly shut, and silence once again fell over the area. Periodically, after crafting a batch of talismans, Lu Xu would go to Gao Tianqiang's residence to conduct transactions. The war between the Black Robe Society and the Three Families Alliance continued, so Lu Xu's talismans were very popular with Gao Tianqiang. No matter how many talismans he produced, the other party could take them all. Thus, it continued until the end of the year, when Lu Xu finally exhausted all the talisman paper he had on hand.

He had crafted eighty first-grade mid-grade talismans, including the defensive Vajra Talismans, and offensive Blazing Flame Talismans, Ice Cone Talismans, Golden Blade Talismans, and others. Lu Xu did not sell any of these eighty mid-grade talismans, keeping them all for his own defense.

This day, after crafting the last talisman, Lu Xu stepped out of his small courtyard, carrying the final batch of talismans to find Gao Tianqiang. After this transaction, his talisman crafting life would temporarily come to an end.

At this moment, inside Gao Tianqiang's mansion, a burly man with piercing eyes arrived.

"Brother Long, why are you the one coming for the handover this time?" Gao Tianqiang was startled the moment he saw the man.

"Ah Qiang, what kind of talk is that? Can't I come over?" The burly man's lips curled into a cold smile.

"That's not what I meant. But Brother Long, you're one of the few late-Qi Condensation experts in our society, always shouldering important responsibilities. Now that the war is tense, why would the leader send you to do such a small task?" Gao Tianqiang stood up, choosing his words carefully as he asked.

"Heh heh!" The burly man sneered a few times. He seemed to show little courtesy towards Gao Tianqiang. He paced around the room twice, then seated himself boldly in a chair and said coldly:

"Breaking through the defenses of those three families is not an easy task. How could mere mid-Qi Condensation cultivators manage it? So, the leader sent me!"

"So that's how it is!" Gao Tianqiang nodded upon hearing this, but his expression did not soften; instead, it flickered unpredictably. After he finished speaking, the room fell into a deathly silence. Neither spoke, and the atmosphere grew heavy.

At some point, the burly man's finger began tapping on the armrest of his chair. "Tap! Tap!" The tapping sound was exceptionally loud in the quiet room. Gao Tianqiang felt each tap as if it struck his own heart. An invisible pressure descended, making cold sweat seep from his forehead.

"I say, Ah Qiang, I'll ask you one more time." The burly man's voice suddenly rang out eerily, making Gao Tianqiang's heart clench violently.

"Who exactly killed my brother?" He slapped the armrest fiercely, his fierce eyes fixed on Gao Tianqiang, his face contorted with rage.

"As expected, it's about this!" Gao Tianqiang's heart lurched, then such a thought emerged.

"Brother Long, I truly don't know about this. Xiao Hu suddenly disappeared outside the market city around that time. I spent most of my time gathering intelligence inside the market city and didn't know the situation outside!" Gao Tianqiang said with a sincere expression.

"You don't know? Heh heh, are you really saying you don't know?" The burly man sneered and stood up, his massive figure looming over Gao Tianqiang like a wall. He walked up to Gao Tianqiang, placed his massive hands like cattail leaf fans on Gao Tianqiang's shoulders, leaned close to his ear, and whispered:

"Even if you don't say it, I've already guessed!"

"Ah Qiang, you really have a good plan, don't you? After my brother died, you were the only one who could contact that talisman master. Naturally, the lucrative position of purchasing talismans fell into your hands. Tell me, how many spirit stones have you amassed from this over the past half year?"

Gao Tianqiang's face instantly changed when he heard this. "Brother Long, you can't just make wild accusations like that! I've never embezzled a single spirit stone from the society!"

"Is that so? Heh heh, actually, it doesn't matter if you took a little. Who doesn't pocket something when they're doing business?" The burly man said with a chuckle. His grim expression gradually relaxed, easing the tense atmosphere in the room slightly.

But the next moment, his two massive hands suddenly clamped down fiercely on Gao Tianqiang's shoulders, his face directly opposite Gao Tianqiang's, his eyes blazing with fury. He opened his mouth, his voice shifting from a low murmur to a high roar, finally thundering:

"Ah Qiang! You shouldn't have done it, you shouldn't have hidden the cause of my brother's death from me, just to monopolize this lucrative position!"

The burly man pressed down fiercely on Gao Tianqiang's shoulders, as if trying to crush him to bits. Waves of sharp pain surged from his shoulders, and Gao Tianqiang's face finally turned deathly pale.
