Chapter 158: Sparring

“Brother Guanshan, the disciple of the Casting Hall beside me not only excels at forging weapons but also possesses martial arts that are outstanding among the younger generation.”

He slapped Xu Yunfan’s back heavily, producing a thudding sound, and extended two fingers.

“Two refinements—muscle and skin refined to perfection! He has now entered the Outer Three Unifications Realm. Even those in the Muscle Refining Realm would struggle to defeat him.”

Xu Yunfan: “...”

Hearing this, the old Taoist Guanshan was somewhat surprised and began to seriously size up Xu Yunfan.

“Hm?!”

His eyebrows twitched slightly as he glanced quickly at Hong Baichuan, who seemed completely oblivious.

Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred.

The old Taoist Guanshan suddenly smiled and said, “My disciple has also just entered the Outer Three Unifications recently. Why don’t the two of them have a little spar?”

The chopsticks in Xu Yunfan’s hand abruptly stopped mid-air, his expression freezing.

Su Zhenhe suddenly let out a soft laugh.

“Brother Xu, care to give it a try?”

The laughter hadn’t even faded when his folding fan pointed three inches outside Xu Yunfan’s Jianjing acupoint.

The hair on the back of Xu Yunfan’s neck stood on end. Before the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer could even be drawn, the Thousand Mechanism Silk hidden in the waist mechanism shot out like a viper’s tongue, wrapping around the dragon spine pattern on the fan ribs.

*Clang!*

In the sound of metal colliding, the wooden stools beneath the two of them were actually forced back three inches each.

Su Zhenhe stroked the ink-splashed star map on the fan surface, a sharp glint appearing in his eyes. “Brother Xu’s Silk Winding Technique truly captures the essence of the Hundred Refinements Silk Winding Technique.”

“Brother Su’s technique is also exquisite. You were actually able to exude energy to the point of forming frost.”

The dormant vital energy and blood in Su Zhenhe’s body suddenly exploded like a stone shattering the heavens. In an instant, his aura soared to its peak, which was truly astonishing.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained calm as he shook off the ice crystals on the Thousand Mechanism Silk, catching sight of the fine teeth marks on its surface.

In that brief exchange just now, the thirty-six cold iron fan ribs hidden in the folding fan had actually collided with the Thousand Mechanism Silk more than seven times.

If he hadn’t used enough clever force, this Thousand Mechanism Silk would have snapped long ago.

Xu Yunfan glanced at Hong Baichuan.

He saw a hint of certainty mixed within Hong Baichuan’s drunken, hazy gaze.

Xu Yunfan understood.

At this moment, Su Zhenhe stood up and walked out of the Star Catching Pavilion, coming to an open space. The folding fan in his hand slowly tapped against his palm.

“It’s too cramped inside; we can’t properly stretch our limbs. Brother Xu, why don’t we try it out here?”

“Certainly.”

Xu Yunfan’s expression was calm. As he stood up, he casually took the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer placed to one side and walked slowly to stand on the open ground.

Inside the Star Catching Pavilion, Taoist Guanhe, the old Taoist Guanshan, and Hong Baichuan, who didn’t have a trace of drunkenness on his face, watched the scene intently, their eyes not blinking.

Xu Yunfan: “...”

The mountain wind swept past the bronze bells on the eaves of the Star Catching Pavilion. Xu Yunfan’s wrist trembled, and the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swung up three feet of dark light. An invisible energy suddenly burst out from the hammer head and spread rapidly.

Before the hammer head even arrived, the wisps of hair on Su Zhenhe’s forehead were already pressed tightly against his scalp by the劲 wind.

“Treasure Artifact?!”

Su Zhenhe’s originally relaxed and elegant face finally showed a hint of seriousness.

Sharp blades were one thing, but Treasure Artifacts could spontaneously emit energy. When wielded, they could also stimulate and amplify one’s vital energy by several percent, making them excellent weapons for fighting across realms.

“Brother Su’s folding fan is also not weak.”

As soon as Xu Yunfan finished speaking, he stomped his foot, and his body shot out like an arrow leaving the string. The heavy hammer in his hand swept out, carrying with it wind and thunder.

*Clang!*

The folding fan unfurled against the wind, and the thirty-six cold iron fan ribs forcefully blocked this heavy hammer.

Su Zhenhe’s eyes narrowed slightly. The force carried by this heavy hammer was completely beyond his expectations.

He twisted his waist and spun his body. The green stone floor tiles were crushed into powder under his deerskin boots. He actually used the immense force from Xu Yunfan’s swing to leap three zhang into the air.

In mid-air, the folding fan snapped shut, and the tip of the fan, like a viper’s tongue, stabbed straight towards Xu Yunfan’s lower back.

Xu Yunfan’s vital energy and blood boiled like a seething pot. Even the dormant Pure Yang Internal Energy within his flesh and blood began to flow through his limbs and bones, making his strength even more ferocious.

The muscles on his arms bulged and swelled, the loose sleeves stretched taut by his movements.

The heavy hammer in his hand suddenly changed its trajectory. He flipped his hand, and the armor-piercing cone at the end of the hammer handle brushed past Su Zhenhe’s ear, tearing off half a sleeve made of shark-silk.

“Excellent use of the ‘entangling’ technique in the Cloak Hammer Style!”

Su Zhenhe retreated rapidly, his toes touching the ground. When he landed, his left sleeve had already been wrapped around a玄甲 vambrace.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes twitched slightly upon seeing this.

Yet another Treasure Artifact. He was truly wealthy and extravagant.

Su Zhenhe’s folding fan flipped between his five fingers, leaving afterimages.寒 light flashed continuously from the seams of the fan ribs. Twenty-three gusts of wind capable of easily piercing gold and cracking stone shot out instantly, targeting Xu Yunfan’s twelve joints.

Xu Yunfan exhaled a white mist from his nose, the muscles and sinews of his entire body twisting like old vines.

He swung the heavy hammer in a full circle, like a full moon. Wherever the hammer shadow passed, sparks flew. The bursting energy also brought forth bursts of thunderous cracks. All twenty-two gusts of penetrating energy were completely shattered.

Xu Yunfan stomped his foot. His two-hundred-pound body spun horizontally in the air. The soles of his boots shattered the green bricks, and the flying stones rained down like arrows towards Su Zhenhe’s face.

“Here it comes!”

Su Zhenhe’s folding fan closed into a ruler-like shape, the bones of his wrist cracking like frying beans.

The fan ribs poked, parried, lifted, and wiped. The impenetrable rain of stones was actually broken by him, creating a three-foot gap.

Just as the last grain of stone was about to fall, his left palm suddenly slapped the ground. Smoke and dust rose like a screen from the cracks in the green bricks—it was a hidden move he had prepared earlier by using hidden force to crack the floor tiles!

“?”

When Su Zhenhe saw that the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in Xu Yunfan’s hand could actually transform into a chain hammer, his expression couldn’t help but be a bit stunned.

Among the seated figures in the Star Catching Pavilion, Taoist Guanhe was even more amazed.

“As expected of the Heavenly Work Cave! They were actually able to forge such a strange and Treasure Artifact-level weapon through a combination of forging and mechanisms!”

A ginkgo tree as thick as a bowl’s mouth snapped with a sound. The trunk flew sideways and scattered the dust.

“Oh dear, my ginkgo tree!!”

The old Taoist Guanshan couldn’t sit still anymore, but was held back by Hong Baichuan, who comforted him, “It’s just a ginkgo tree, Brother Guanshan, why be like this? I’ll have the disciples from the Heavenly Work Department plant you a琉璃 tree later. It’ll be much more beautiful than this.”

Amidst the flying wood chips, a cold light swept across the ground.

Su Zhenhe actually used the folding fan as a blade, employing the style of a ground-sweeping saber!

*Crack!*

The Thunderfire Hammer slammed half a foot into the ground. Xu Yunfan used the rebounding force to flip backward.

Su Zhenhe’s fan blade grazed his back, scraping a string of sparks off the玄 steel waist guard.

In the instant they crossed paths, Xu Yunfan’s heel chopped down like an axe. Su Zhenhe raised his elbow to block it硬. The玄 iron vambrace actually emitted a rebounding force, which stunned Xu Yunfan’s heel.

The two of them went back and forth, hammer and fan colliding. Sparks almost seemed to sprinkle throughout the entire courtyard, the clanging sounds continuing without end.

Xu Yunfan held the heavy hammer. Its momentum surged with wind and thunder. It was open and powerful, yet not without delicacy. There was always a bit of room for maneuver with every swing of the hammer. His aura was like a tiger emerging from its cage, not taking a single step back.

Su Zhenhe was indeed a true disciple of the Xuanzhen Gate. His use of the folding fan’s巧 force was superb. Although he couldn’t withstand the force head-on, he had a knack for borrowing force to deflect it.

A hundred moves passed in the blink of an eye.

Xu Yunfan’s hammer momentum grew fiercer. When he executed the thirty-sixth move of the Cloak Hammer Style, “Iron Lock Across the River,” the heavy hammer actually rippled in the air.

Su Zhenhe’s temples were sweating. The opening and closing of his folding fan showed signs of sluggishness. Twelve fan ribs had been knocked somewhat red by the heavy hammer. His grip, shaken by the repeated hammer strikes, became unstable.
