# Chapter 130: The Great Dao Oath and the Flying Mist Ship (Combined)

After hearing his master's words, the young man no longer hesitated and obediently steered his escape light toward the direction of Diyan Island.

Having reached Foundation Establishment, his escape light was swift. Even as a newly advanced Foundation Establishment cultivator, his speed was nothing to scoff at. In just a short while, he arrived at the vicinity of Diyan Island.

At this moment, four figures were already waiting quietly on Diyan Island.

"Is the newcomer Xie Chengping from Bilan Peak, Senior Brother Xie?" 

As soon as the young man's escape light arrived, a Daoist with fiery red eyes and a weathered gaze stepped forward from among the four figures and bowed in greeting.

"Senior Brother Ma Wu?"

Although Xie Chengping usually devoted himself to cultivation and paid little attention to the affairs of the Dao Academy, he had recently taken the time to study the six individuals to whom Gu Yuan had distributed spiritual energy. 

Among them, two stood out. One was naturally Jiang Ningxue, the prodigious daughter of Ruyi Peak, who possessed the Supreme Yin Physique. However, she had only reached the eighth level of Qi Refinement and would need more time to reach Foundation Establishment despite having obtained spiritual energy in advance.

The other was Ma Wu, who had nearly secured a seventh-grade spiritual energy slot on his own. In truth, he might even be slightly stronger than Xie Chengping. 

However, Ma Wu could only counter fire-based cultivators, whereas Xie Chengping cultivated the Cloud Script Qi. Moreover, upon returning to Bilan Peak, his master would bestow upon him a mid-grade spiritual artifact. He reckoned that Ma Wu would never surpass him in the future.

With this thought, his heart lightened, and a smile appeared on his face.

"Senior Brother Xie, let me introduce you. This is Junior Sister Fu, Junior Brother Lü, and Junior Brother Song. From now on, we will all serve under Senior Brother Gu. We should support and assist each other!"

Ma Wu enthusiastically made the introductions.

Forming alliances and sticking together was the survival strategy of disciples from humble backgrounds.

One reason they had agreed to serve under Gu Yuan was that he could unite them into a cohesive force. Within such a group, they would have more confidence when navigating the Dao Academy.

"Greetings to all junior brothers and sisters!"

Xie Chengping also clasped his hands in greeting, smiling in response.

But inwardly, he paid them no mind.

How could a few alchemy and artifact dabblers compete with me? In the future, they would still serve under me.

Ever since his master mentioned that possibility, he couldn't help but imagine himself in that role, eagerly awaiting the day.

"Senior Brother Xie has arrived. Now, we're only missing Junior Sister Jiang. I wonder if she'll make it in time for the expedition to Chiyue Great River?"

Unaware of Xie Chengping's thoughts, the others were simply delighted to see their small group growing stronger.

---

"There's still time before the official expedition. Junior Sister Jiang is exceptionally talented—she should make it," Fu Hongling said softly.

"Let's hope so."

Ma Wu and the others nodded in agreement. An additional Foundation Establishment cultivator meant more combat strength, something they couldn't afford to overlook.

"Let's not wait for Junior Sister Jiang. We should pay our respects to Senior Brother Gu first!" 

Xie Chengping secretly hoped Jiang Ningxue wouldn't advance to Foundation Establishment so quickly, but he couldn't voice this aloud. Instead, he changed the subject and urged the others to enter the island.

"Senior Brother Xie, don't rush. It's not that we don't want to enter the island—it's just that Senior Brother Gu seems to be refining a magic seal and has activated the island's barrier. We should wait a little longer."

Ma Wu pointed to the surging spiritual energy on Diyan Island and spoke softly.

Wait?

Xie Chengping instinctively felt displeased.

He had come all this way to swear a Great Dao Oath of loyalty, and now he had to wait?

**Boom!**

At that moment, a brilliant golden light erupted from Diyan Island. Countless streams of spiritual energy surged like tidal waves from all directions. The island's barrier suddenly deactivated, and starlight seemed to descend from the heavens, shimmering with an otherworldly radiance as it poured into a cave.

Then, the resonant hum of a sword rang out, shaking the surroundings like thunder.

**Clang!**

Not only that, eighteen dazzling sword lights uncontrollably spilled from the cave, sweeping across the area and heading straight for the group.

"Move! Senior Brother Gu's sword seal is incredibly powerful!"

Ma Wu shouted, swiftly pulling the others back.

Xie Chengping initially wanted to retreat as well, but remembering his master's earlier instructions, he steeled himself. He clasped his hands behind his back, channeled his magic power, and activated a protective seal, summoning wisps of cloud qi to block the incoming attack.

**Swoosh!**

Yet the sword light was blindingly bright, like intangible lightning. In an instant, it sliced through the cloud qi and, with lightning speed, left a fine cut on Xie Chengping's face.

This all happened in the blink of an eye. Xie Chengping didn't even have time to retreat a second time.

Fortunately, the sword energy was merely residual. After crossing a certain threshold, its power diminished greatly. After leaving a mark on Xie Chengping's face, it was blocked by his magic power and caused no further harm.

"Senior Brother Xie, are you alright?!"

But this single sword strike felt like a slap across his face.

Ma Wu's concerned voice only made his face burn hotter with humiliation.

He hadn't even been able to block a stray sword beam—how could he ever hope to establish his reputation and lead the others?

Though part of the reason was his recent breakthrough to Foundation Establishment and lack of a refined magic seal, the embarrassment was undeniable.

---

"I'm fine, I'm fine!"

He quickly shook his head, indicating he was unharmed, and activated his seal to heal the cut on his face.

But though the wound wasn't deep, the sword energy carried an intense sharpness. No matter how much magic power he channeled, he couldn't completely dispel it, and the wound refused to fully close.

"Senior Brother Xie, don't worry. That sword energy was unleashed when Senior Brother Gu completed his seal refinement, drawing upon the power of heaven and earth. Its might far surpasses ordinary attacks. Here, I have some 'Dispersing Gold Dew'—apply it, and it'll heal right away."

At that moment, Fu Hongling took out a small green jade bottle and dripped a single drop of shimmering liquid onto Xie Chengping's wound.

The sword energy dissipated instantly, and the wound closed.

"...Th-thank you, Junior Sister."

Xie Chengping's emotions were in turmoil, and he could barely stammer out his gratitude.

"Senior Brother Xie, you're too kind. Since we're all under Senior Brother Gu's command, we should support each other."

Fu Hongling smiled gently.

This only made Xie Chengping feel even more conflicted, leaving him at a loss for words.

"Enter the cave for discussion!"

Fortunately, at that moment, a gentle divine sense emanated from the island, dissolving Xie Chengping's awkwardness.

The group didn't dare delay and quickly summoned their escape lights, flying toward the Stone Grotto.

---

The Stone Grotto remained as crude and cramped as ever, but when Xie Chengping and the others entered, they felt an oppressive sharpness in the air, as though countless sword lights shimmered on the walls, lingering and refusing to fade.

Ma Wu and the others brightened at the sight.

Senior Brother Gu's power had grown again.

Only Xie Chengping's mood remained complicated.

"All five qi have been achieved—congratulations!"

Seeing the five before him, Gu Yuan smiled with satisfaction.

These were his foundation, his support for the expedition to the Great River and his bid for the True Inheritance position.

"Thanks to Senior Brother's guidance, we've reached this point. Today, we come to swear the Great Dao Oath—we vow to serve under you for fifty years. Should we break this oath, may heavenly lightning strike us down!"

Ma Wu was the first to bow deeply, solemnly declaring his oath to Gu Yuan.

As soon as he spoke, an intangible force seemed to stir, as though some unseen presence had taken notice of his words.

The Great Dao Oath was a sacred vow within the Dao Academy. Once sworn, it invoked the will of the heavens and could not be broken lightly. Violating it would indeed summon divine retribution—ranging from the loss of cultivation and eternal stagnation to being reduced to ashes on the spot.

The True Immortals resided in the celestial palaces, and oaths held real power.

"Fu Hongling vows to serve under Senior Brother for a hundred years. Should I break this oath, may heavenly lightning strike me down!"

"Lü Zijin…"

"Song Shan…"

One after another, the others also swore their oaths, invoking the unseen forces of the cosmos.

Gu Yuan nodded slightly in approval.

Seeing that everyone else had already sworn their oaths, Xie Chengping knew he had no choice. Taking a deep breath, he slowly declared, "Xie Chengping of Bilan Peak vows to serve under Senior Brother for fifty years. Should I break this oath, may heavenly lightning strike me down!"

"Excellent."

Gu Yuan glanced at Xie Chengping, then chuckled lightly as he helped the group rise.

He knew that each of these individuals harbored their own ambitions.

But such was the nature of the world—without mutual benefit, how could they be gathered?

As long as he could keep them in line, it wouldn't be a problem.

"Since the oaths have been sworn, we must support each other. The expedition to Chiyue Great River is imminent, and time is short. You should all select your magic seals as soon as possible to strengthen yourselves."

"Though rumors may exaggerate our strength, we know the truth—we are all newly advanced Foundation Establishment cultivators. How can we compare to seasoned veterans? For this expedition, we must remain vigilant at all times and never let our guard down."

With the oaths complete, Gu Yuan didn't keep them any longer. After delivering his warning, he sent them on their way.

Originally, Ma Wu and the others had felt a sense of pride after their breakthrough. But Gu Yuan's words sobered them, and they bowed respectfully before hastily departing.

Watching their retreating figures, Gu Yuan sighed softly before resuming his cultivation.

His words hadn't been mere intimidation.

For this expedition, the greatest danger lay with newly advanced Foundation Establishment cultivators like them.

Without fully refined magic seals, spiritual artifacts, and other essential tools, they had the realm but not the matching strength.

Yet one year was the limit the Dao Academy could afford to give them. Any longer, and the situation in Chiyue Great River might change unpredictably.

The Flowing Clouds Banquet was the academy's final opportunity for its elite disciples to prepare before the expedition.

If Gu Yuan wanted to secure benefits from this campaign, he had to strengthen himself as much as possible.

The refinement of the Dragon-Binding True Seal and the Vast Sea Unity Seal had to be accelerated.

---

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, over half a year had passed.

During this time, nearly every cultivator had been frantically stockpiling resources. All manner of magical tools, pills, and materials for refining magic seals were in short supply.

Meanwhile, the momentum for the demon-slaying campaign within the Dao Academy had reached its peak.

**Dong!**

**Dong!**

**Dong!**

On this day, the skies were clear and cloudless. The resonant tolling of a bell echoed throughout the Dao Academy.

The sound spread across the great marsh, and countless cultivators looked up to see four massive treasure ships, each as towering as a mountain, rising into the sky and casting vast shadows over the land.

"By decree of the Dao Academy, we march to conquer Chiyue Great River!"

A thunderous voice boomed across every corner of the academy. With the exception of those in secluded breakthrough cultivation, every disciple heard this proclamation.

Countless cultivators emerged from their caves, sighing as they summoned their escape lights and soared toward the four treasure ships in the sky.

The four ships varied in design. The highest among them was immense as a mountain range, its restrictions as vast as an ocean, exuding an overwhelming pressure. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators with their radiant escape lights found it impossible to approach, as if an immense force held everything in place.

This was the Heavenly Net Treasure Ship—the vessel of the Golden Core cultivators.

Conquering Chiyue Great River was no trivial matter. Without Golden Core cultivators leading the charge, how could they possibly overthrow a demon king's domain?

Yet the Heavenly Net Treasure Ship's aura was as deep as the sea, obscuring any view of how many Golden Core experts were aboard.

Beneath it were three Flying Mist Ships.

These ships were designed specifically for campaigns. Each had two levels—the lower level could accommodate over a thousand Qi Refinement disciples, while the upper level had forty-nine spirit platforms, each capable of holding one Foundation Establishment cultivator.

With forty-nine Foundation Establishment cultivators working in tandem, the ship's power became as vast as a mountain. Even a Golden Core cultivator could be held off for days. These were the Dao Academy's prized instruments of war, rarely deployed.

Now that the expedition had been officially declared, the three ships were divided according to cultivation realms, each led by a late-stage Foundation Establishment expert.

**Whoosh!**

**Whoosh!**

As the bell tolled, streaks of light shot forth from all directions, landing on their respective ships according to their cultivation levels.

By the time Ma Wu and the others arrived, over twenty Foundation Establishment cultivators were already seated on the spirit platforms of the first ship's upper level, all at the early-stage Foundation Establishment realm.

At the ship's helm sat an elderly man with white hair and golden light flickering in his eyes.

His aura was profound, and strands of golden radiance seemed to seep from his hair, indicating he had reached the peak of late-stage Foundation Establishment and touched upon a trace of Golden Core essence.

Yet this final step was as difficult as ascending to the heavens, and countless cultivators had perished attempting it.

At this moment, the elder sat cross-legged, eyes closed in silence.

When Ma Wu and the others arrived, he didn't even glance their way.

But Ma Wu and his group didn't dare show disrespect. They bowed respectfully before finding a corner to settle in.

More Foundation Establishment cultivators arrived in succession, yet the elder remained unmoved.

Even when disciples from prominent families like Bian Chuyao, Feng Anping, and Ji Mobai appeared, he paid them no attention.

Only when disciples from Yingyue Peak arrived did he finally open his eyes and give them a glance.

The Yingyue Peak disciples immediately bowed with visible delight.

The atmosphere on the ship shifted subtly.

Clearly, this elder was a senior from Yingyue Peak. In this expedition, Yingyue Peak had already gained an advantage.

As time passed, the ship gradually filled up.

Soon, all forty-nine spirit platforms were occupied.

The most eye-catching group was the Su family, which occupied eight platforms all by itself, forming their own faction.

Apart from them, Ma Wu and his companions also stood out, seated together in a group of five.

But given their unstable auras, many cultivators on the ship sneered and quickly lost interest.

"The time is almost upon us. Those who miss the expedition will be punished according to academy regulations!"

The elder's gaze was sharp as he noted the two empty platforms beside Ma Wu's group and spoke coldly.

Ma Wu and the others grew visibly anxious.

They had intended to meet Gu Yuan at Diyan Island and come together, but to their surprise, Gu Yuan was nowhere to be found. 

With his prolonged absence, they couldn't help but feel uneasy.

Having only recently broken through to Foundation Establishment, they lacked proper spiritual artifacts. Without Gu Yuan, this expedition would likely yield little gain—and might even cost them their lives.

**Whoosh!**

Just then, a golden streak of light arrived in the blink of an eye, landing on the ship.

Close behind it was a white streak of light, drifting gracefully onto the deck.

"Take your seats at once!"

The elder waved his sleeve impatiently.

Gu Yuan and Jiang Ningxue bowed to the elder before settling onto the spirit platforms beside Ma Wu and the others.

With all forty-nine Foundation Establishment cultivators present, the ship's restrictions flared to life, radiating a cold, formidable aura as a vast spiritual force enveloped the entire vessel.

Below, on the ship's lower level, a multitude of Qi Refinement disciples watched nervously as the ship trembled slightly before transforming into a streak of light, shooting off into the distance.

The campaign against Chiyue Great River had officially begun.
