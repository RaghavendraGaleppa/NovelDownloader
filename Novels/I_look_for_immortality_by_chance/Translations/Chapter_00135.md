# Chapter 135: Seventeen Sword Rays Divided, Slaying the Demon Ape!

Above the floating clouds, the Azure-Flame Golden-Eyed Ape grew impatient when no one emerged from the magic vessel. A savage glint flashed in its eyes as it tightened its grip on the blade, preparing to dismember the corpse before it.

Just then, a figure streaked through the air like a beam of light, landing before the ape in an instant.

"At least you have some courage left!" the ape roared with laughter, sheathing its blade as it sized up the newcomer.

The man wore a green robe, his hair tied back with a jade hairpin. His sleeves fluttered slightly as he stood tall, his expression calm and composed, devoid of the fury seen in the previous challengers.

"Who are you? State your name, lest you end up like this fool—dead without knowing why!" the ape sneered, pointing at Ji Fenghua's corpse.

"The one who will kill you," Gu Yuan replied coolly.

"Arrogant fool!" The demon ape's face twisted in anger, but seeing Gu Yuan's unshaken demeanor, a flicker of doubt arose in its heart. Without further words, it abruptly shut its eyes, channeling its innate power before snapping them open again.

**Boom!**

In an instant, golden flames erupted, blazing like the sun. A terrifying will, carrying scorching radiance akin to golden lightning, tore through the void and struck at Gu Yuan's consciousness.

The **Golden-Eyed Flame Technique**—the Azure-Flame Golden-Eyed Ape's signature ability, the very reason it dominated these lands.

This strike was as swift as light itself, bearing both the searing heat of golden flames to scorch flesh and eyes, and an intangible sharpness capable of shredding a cultivator's consciousness.

Yet, the moment the ape closed its eyes, Gu Yuan did the same—only to reopen them in perfect sync.

**Boom!**

Golden flames ignited in his pupils, turning his eyes into molten gold, as if forged from divine metal, radiating a brilliance that repelled the incoming flames.

"The Golden-Eyed Flame Technique? No—**Golden-Eyed Elixir**?! You've consumed the Golden-Eyed Elixir!" The ape's expression shifted in shock.

Of all things in the world, the one that countered the Golden-Eyed Flame Technique most effectively was the Golden-Eyed Elixir. 

Countless techniques could rival the ape's innate ability, but none countered it as naturally as the elixir refined from the eyes of its own kind.

Yet, within moments, the ape's surprise faded. "A mere inferior Golden-Eyed Elixir at the Qi Refining stage..."

Though the golden light in Gu Yuan's eyes was pure, its potency was far too low to truly oppose the ape's technique. At best, it could protect his eyes—his consciousness remained vulnerable to the golden flames' assault.

But just then, within Gu Yuan's mind, a three-eyed lightning dragon, crackling with thunder, suddenly opened its eyes.

**Roar! Boom!**

The dragon's awakening was like thunder, like a furious bellow. Its colossal form surged forward, an unstoppable force erupting from Gu Yuan's consciousness.

---

**Boom!**

Invisible lightning detonated in the void as the scaled and armored dragon roared forth, obliterating the incoming golden flames in an instant.

The dazzling golden light scattered like sparks from a forge, painting the sky in a brilliant display.

Yet, the Azure-Flame Golden-Eyed Ape's face twisted in horror, a deep sense of dread rising within it.

**Clang!**

A golden bamboo-like shadow—or perhaps a sword's gleam—shot forth from Gu Yuan's body in tandem with the three-eyed lightning dragon. With unimaginable speed, it slashed toward the ape's forehead.

**Clang!**

The ape roared, swinging its massive golden staff with monstrous strength to block the incoming sword light.

**Swoosh!**

But the instant the sword light neared, it split—one becoming two, two becoming three, three multiplying into sixteen.

In the span of a single thought, sixteen razor-sharp sword rays converged, weaving a deadly net around the ape.

Panic flashed in the demon ape's eyes as it frantically spun its staff, forming an impenetrable barrier.

Yet the sword rays were too swift, too sharp. They carried not only the edge of spiritual swords but also the profound artistry of swordplay. In moments, they slipped past the ape's defenses, carving deep, bloody gashes across its body.

The sword qi seeped into its bones, leaving it drenched in blood, a pitiful sight.

"Break!" Desperate, the ape bit its tongue, summoning a forbidden technique to escape.

But just then, the sixteen sword rays flickered once more—and a seventeenth emerged.

"No!" The ape's eyes bulged in terror.

This final sword ray was the last straw. Mirror-bright and unstoppable, it slipped past the ape's defenses, guided by the other sixteen, and pierced clean through its forehead.

**Thud!**

The Azure-Flame Golden-Eyed Ape collapsed lifelessly, its corpse plummeting from the clouds.

**Whoosh!**

At that moment, a jade light surged from Gu Yuan's palm, enveloping the ape's corpse and essence before vanishing.

**Roar!**

From the Earth Fiend Water Sky Formation below, a furious bellow erupted. A monstrous aura surged, forming massive hands that clawed at Gu Yuan.

But golden light erupted from the flying vessel, shattering the spectral hands and restoring calm to the skies.

"My apologies," Gu Yuan murmured, paying his respects to Ji Fenghua's corpse with a sigh. He waved his sleeve, and emerald light from his Green Ginseng Dao Foundation enveloped the body, mending its wounds before he carried it back to the vessel.

"Senior Brother Yin, the task is complete," Gu Yuan announced, presenting the corpse with a bow.

"Excellent! This is the bearing of a true genius of our sect. Seventeen sword rays divided in just a year—such comprehension is worthy of the favor you've received from the elders. The title of champion at the Flowing Clouds Banquet is well-deserved!"

The battle had been decided in mere breaths, with neither side unleashing their full arsenal. Yet the brilliance of their techniques left onlookers awestruck.

Yin Xingchao couldn't help but praise him.

**Sword Ray Division** was a secret art of the sword path, demanding extraordinary talent—but the rewards were immense. The more rays one could divide, the greater the technique's power.

Ten rays marked a prodigy, capable of dominating peers. Fifteen rays were fearsome, allowing one to slay opponents instantly if they lacked countermeasures. 

Seventeen rays? Unstoppable. Even a rare beast like the Azure-Flame Golden-Eyed Ape had fallen in moments.

With this sword art alone, Gu Yuan had matched decades of cultivation by the early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators aboard the vessel.

Such was the gap between genius and mediocrity.

Most crucially, while others might not recognize it, Yin Xingchao had—Gu Yuan had wielded the **Boundless Sword Seal**, a secret art of the Jade Pot Peak lineage.

Could it be that this disciple was already a personal student of a Golden Core elder?

"Hahaha! Junior Brother Su, your eyes are sharp indeed! I was blind—how could someone like me compare to a genius like Senior Brother Gu? A single year's progress surpassing decades of toil—Junior Brother Su, you have keen judgment indeed!" 

Among the crowd, Ma Wu stood abruptly, bowing deeply to Su Huazheng with exaggerated praise.

"Since Senior Brother Su admires Senior Brother Gu so much, and now that Senior Brother Gu has retrieved Senior Brother Ji's remains, surely you won't go back on your word, will you?" Fu Hongling added with a smirk, her gaze fixed on Su Huazheng.

Su Huazheng's face turned deathly pale, his eyes wide with disbelief. 

He glanced instinctively at Su Jingming, but the latter clutched his eyes, groaning in pain as if oblivious to the situation.

All eyes were now on Su Huazheng.
