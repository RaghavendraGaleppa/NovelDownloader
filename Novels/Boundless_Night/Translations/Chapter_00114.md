## Chapter 114: Young Patriarch-Level Demeanor

The sinkhole was like a large, sloped bowl; the further down one went, the denser the violent light mist became. Although the bottom of the giant pit wasn't dark, the colorful spiritual mist obstructed vision, so even after Qin Ming removed his armor, no one could see if his arms were bare. Of course, a very few exceptions existed; Li Qingyue's spiritual eyes could pierce through the mist and miasma.

Qin Ming, clad in cool inner armor, stood on the slope, continuously practicing Yang Fist and Yin Fist. When he reached a subtle understanding, he combined them into the Wu Ji Fist. At this moment, the fist technique balanced Yin and Yang, its power surged, and his fists glowed with a hazy light mist, ready to unleash both masculine and feminine energies at any time.

Next, Earth Vein Essence Qi steamed from beneath Qin Ming's feet, expanding up his legs and throughout his body, filling him with power. First, this was the Wu Ji Fist, representing the power of the Earth domain. Secondly, it was then divided into Yang Earth Qi and Yin Earth Qi, which could be considered the Yin-Yang Fist.

Standing there, Qin Ming felt a profound, solid Earth essence qi spreading from his feet to every part of his flesh and blood, filling him with a sense of immense power. He himself was surprised, as it should be difficult to capture Earth essence qi outside after leaving the Mountain River Spirit Nest, given that was a method of the Outer Sages. Yet now he had achieved it; with his feet on the ground, he felt an indescribable sense of security, as if an inexhaustible, continuous supply of power was available.

"The terrifying and extraordinary aspect of the Wu Ji Scripture lies here: as long as you don't leave the surface, there's power to borrow." Qin Ming finally understood why Xiang Yiwu said this miraculous art might be even more precious than the Li Fire Scripture. Joy filled his heart, because the Wu Ji Fist was originally only supposed to be mastered at the Outer Sage stage!

Qin Ming was certain this was related to his journey to the Mountain River Spirit Nest. There, he absorbed vast amounts of Earth Vein essence qi, forcing himself to master the Yang Fist and Yin Fist. Now, upon arriving here, he naturally achieved twice the result with half the effort by utilizing the Heaven's Light for fusion. There was an even more crucial point: he had deepened his foundation in the Mountain River Spirit Nest.

"No wonder the Patriarchs of Sky-Supporting Qi and Six Imperial Qi went to great lengths to borrow the methods of the 'Beyond-Worldly' cultivators to improve their foundations; there are so many benefits!" Qin Ming pondered, having surpassed young Oddities by a significant margin, he could be considered a "Young Patriarch"-level figure, right? Looking at it this way, it was normal for him to grasp some Outer Sage methods at the Rebirth stage. Which "Patriarch" could be measured by common sense?

"I'm already a Young Patriarch-level figure; just mastering this Wu Ji Fist isn't enough. I need to improve it further," Qin Ming strictly demanded of himself. As a fellow Patriarch-level figure, others had all sorts of legends; he couldn't disgrace himself!

Qin Ming wielded Yin Earth Qi in his left hand and Yang Earth Qi in his right. Then, the Yin and Yang energies flowed between his hands, easily merging into Wu Ji Qi, becoming increasingly refined until a profound artistic conception gradually emerged. In a trance, across this vast land, a young man was forging ahead alone, clearing paths with his fists, breaking through layer upon layer of obstacles before him.

On the surface, Li Qingyue was surprised. It was her first time seeing Qin Ming practice like this; he truly possessed a hint of a young Grandmaster's aura. She recalled the records of the Patriarchs of Six Imperial Qi and Sky-Supporting Qi from the Beyond-Worldly Lands; they probably weren't much more impressive in their youth, were they?

At the bottom of the bowl-shaped deep pit, Qin Ming's entire body was permeated with Wu Ji Qi, as if he had solidified into one with the earth. He exhaled a breath of Heaven's Light, concluding his practice here. He felt that as a Young Patriarch, reaching this level in the Wu Ji Scripture was not disgraceful.

Next, he used the dense Heaven's Light to practice the Overlord's Wind Qi and Overlord's Might. He also vaguely understood why the Overlord grew stronger and stronger from the Spiritual Domain stage onwards. "Wind Qi and Overlord's Might combine with the Spiritual Domain, borrowing the grand momentum of heaven and earth. His Spiritual Domain is extremely special, summoning swirling dark clouds and lightning, which integrate into his Overlord's Might. How could ordinary people block that?"

Qin Ming pondered that the Overlord utilized various forms of grand momentum through his Spiritual Domain. He certainly couldn't execute it now, but there was one type that might be attempted in a special terrain. He had mastered the Wu Ji Scripture, allowing him to briefly merge with the earth. The Earth Veins here were filled with dense Heaven's Light; if he were to borrow momentum using the Overlord's Wind Qi and Overlord's Might, it would be worth a try!

The "Grass-Skimming Flight" movement technique Qin Ming practiced also contained Wind Qi, but compared to the Wind Qi in the Overlord's Legacy, they were entirely different in style and form. The latter was destructive, sweeping everything away like a hurricane, boundless in its might.

Not long after, he also pushed his Wind Qi and Overlord's Might to their limits, pondering for a long time how to combine them with the Wu Ji Scripture. However, he stopped at the crucial incubation stage. What if he were to trigger the Heaven's Light in this giant pit? Even if only a small portion erupted, the commotion would be enormous. Moreover, he was still at the bottom of the pit; if he accidentally "sent himself away," that would be quite the spectacle.

After mastering the newly acquired Wind Qi, Overlord's Might, and Wu Ji Qi, Qin Ming wasn't in a hurry to merge them into one. He began re-practicing other Qi arts. Since the Rebirth process always lasted one or two days, he could conveniently use the inexhaustible Heaven's Light to study other cultivation methods. In particular, the two miraculous arts that had previously boosted his strength—the Li Fire Scripture and the Golden Silkworm Art—were his focus. Critical points that he couldn't master in the past might now be achievable. After all, thanks to his journey to the Mountain River Spirit Nest, he now possessed a "Young Patriarch"-level foundation.

Sure enough, when he re-comprehended the miraculous Li Fire art, it was different from before; he could continue practicing it. On Qin Ming's body surface, Li Fire Qi transformed into a fiery glow. Splendid divine flames gradually emerged from his body, enveloping him without harming his flesh, blood, or hair. Once the Li Fire appeared, it could nourish his own flesh and blood and incinerate the opponent's Heaven's Light. He cautiously tested it, and a patch of naturally existing Heaven's Light in front of him instantly exploded.

"What a good cultivation method! This is a terrifying counter to many Heaven's Light Qis!" Qin Ming exclaimed. No wonder Xiang Yiwu, the Disciple of Tathagata, insisted on exchanging with him, eager to practice it. "He has a Golden Cicada, I have a Golden Silkworm. Can I refine the Golden Silkworm with Li Fire here?"

Before refining the Golden Silkworm with fire, Qin Ming first practiced the Golden Silkworm Art independently, also needing to elevate it. As expected, this miraculous art could also be continued. Dense golden threads appeared on his body surface, weaving into a net that protected him. When he launched an attack, all the golden threads surged from his body, extending about three inches. They possessed an unstoppable momentum, capable of breaking through the opponent's Heaven's Light Qi and even piercing through their physical body.

"Refining the Golden Silkworm with Li Fire... it really works! Fire restraining Metal is also a form of spur, a driving force!" Evidently, Qin Ming gained greatly from entering the deep pit this time. The Li Fire Qi and Golden Silkworm Qi he now mastered also reached the domain only accessible by Outer Sages, already on the same level as the Wu Tu Qi.

"Yellow Mud Palm, Entangling Silk Qi, Vajra Qi... all need to be improved!"

When Qin Ming got tired, he would eat some dry rations, then find a spot where the light mist was thinner to take a short nap. Time flew by; over a day passed, and Qin Ming's sixth Rebirth was nearing completion.

During this period, the Beyond-Worldly disciples used various methods, startling Qin Ming several times. They even used gunpowder, a byproduct of alchemy, hoping to blast through the giant pit and "flood" out the Heaven's Light. However, apart from causing a series of explosions, it served little purpose. Some even wanted to draw in fire springs to flood the sinkhole. Others deployed "mechanical beasts" crafted by Beyond-Worldly cultivators, but they were completely corroded and destroyed by the Heaven's Light soon after being sent in.

"How about this: each of us refines a drop of Pure Yang Blood Essence and a wisp of Pure Yang Consciousness Spirit Light from our bodies—the kind that has completely severed the 'Yin God' attribute. Don't tell me you can't do it; it's just one drop and one wisp. Then, use this blood essence and consciousness spirit light, attach them to a few Outer Sages, protect them as they go in, and bring out the near-immortal item, how about that?"

Someone proposed this suggestion, immediately causing a commotion. Because this method was feasible and relatively safe, no one had to take risks. Although severing a drop of Pure Yang Blood Essence and a wisp of Pure Yang Consciousness Spirit Light incurred some consumption, it could be recovered after a period of recuperation. However, with more people, opinions naturally diverged. Elite disciples, in particular, felt they would be making sacrifices for others' benefit, losing Pure Yang spirituality for nothing, and were rather unwilling.

After some twists and turns, the core disciples collectively decided it must be so, and the other Beyond-Worldly disciples reluctantly accepted. After all, many had originally attached themselves to the core disciples, coming to assist. Having completed ninety-nine bows, they might as well complete the hundredth. However, their efficiency wasn't very high. They were all supervising each other, fearing that the essence blood provided by various disciples might not possess the Pure Yang attribute.

At this moment, Qin Ming's sixth Rebirth had concluded some time ago. He was diligently comprehending and feeling the changes within himself. "My body's strength has probably reached nine thousand jin!" This was his instinctive feeling, and he believed this judgment was correct. Ultimately, his current achievements were inextricably linked to his journey to the Mountain River Spirit Nest.

"I really have to thank Qingyue," Qin Ming mused with some emotion.

Cui Chongxuan, nourishing his body with the Six Imperial Heart Scripture to enhance his foundation, was merely transforming into an Oddity. But what level had Qin Ming reached now? If converted to his first Rebirth, the foundational strength he possessed now would be 1,500 jin. A young Oddity, even after nine Rebirths, only possessed over eight thousand jin of strength. He, after six Rebirths, already possessed nine thousand jin of strength. What level was this? A Young Patriarch-level demeanor, perhaps even stronger!

In fact, specific strength was merely a superficial manifestation; what it truly revealed was inner foundation and a premonition of future potential! By this, one could judge how far a person could go on the path of Rebirth. "Hmm, this is a Patriarch-level path for me, unpredictable," Qin Ming murmured with a smile.

He began to gather and merge various Heaven's Light Qis. Qin Ming used the Silk Scripture method to control various arts, unifying all Heaven's Light, merging them into one. For a moment, the three miraculous arts and eighteen Qi arts he had practiced simultaneously roared and resonated, forming a layer of mysterious radiance around his body. That Heaven's Light was exceptionally splendid and quite sacred, like a divine halo, enveloping his body, making him appear ethereal and transcendent, as if a deity walked the earth.

Qin Ming exhaled a breath of turbid qi, and the brilliant Heaven's Light receded within him. He returned to his original simple state, becoming a clean-cut, refined youth once more. Without needing to test it, he knew that his merged Heaven's Light Qi had undergone another qualitative change, its power significantly increasing.

At the same time, he discovered a "peculiar light" within his flesh and blood. He realized it was a new ability that had emerged after this Rebirth. Those who walked this path would develop special abilities after their sixth Rebirth; some were like a "chicken rib" (useless), while others were quite extraordinary. Qin Ming did not activate that light, because if he did now, he didn't know when he would recover. With a major battle imminent, he didn't want to prematurely exhaust a means.

He gently vibrated, and Heaven's Light Qi surged. His body instantly became spotless and flawless, even his hair strands were crystal clear, not a speck of dust tainting them. Qin Ming put on his golden robe and golden armor again, walking out of the sinkhole. He did not approach the legendary item, knowing that whoever touched it first would become a target. For now, he could let those people consume their Pure Yang Blood Essence and Consciousness Spirit Light. At the critical moment, he could strike amidst the chaos, ideally dragging everyone into the battlefield.

He reached the surface, breathing the fresh air, and looked down at the giant pit where Heaven's Light flowed. He truly loved it immensely! Qin Ming really wanted to stay here permanently and continue letting his body undergo Rebirth. Alas, everyone had a buffer period; ordinary people couldn't exceed five Rebirths in a year. He had already broken this limit without ill effect, but the intervals couldn't be too short. For others, a sixth Rebirth within a year was already beyond their limits and could damage their foundation.

"I feel that if I wait another ten days to half a month, I can continue with my seventh Rebirth. Alas, the Beyond-Worldly cultivators probably won't give me that much time," Qin Ming sighed.

Out of curiosity, he went to see what the Pure Yang Blood Essence of the Beyond-Worldly disciples looked like. He successively saw some acquaintances, such as Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan. Although neither was a core disciple, their strength was not weak, and they were both waiting for an opportunity. Qin Ming didn't have a good impression of them, but he had to admit, their current strength was quite high, both having entered the second major realm—Yellow Court. No wonder Li Qingxu's cousin had subtly mocked him in Chixia City, implying that Qin Ming might only be able to meet old acquaintances in the Beyond-Worldly Lands after reaching his peak. Reality was indeed cruel; Qin Ming had only just begun his path of Rebirth. Were it not for his extraordinary talent, he would likely be exactly as the other party had described.

Wang Caiwei, Lu Zhenyi, Chen Bingyan, and a few others walked together; they hadn't given up either, quietly awaiting a special opportunity.

"Their Pure Yang Blood Essence isn't all that special. From this perspective, my blood's Pure Yang attribute isn't bad." Qin Ming mused, realizing there was indeed some truth to his ability to absorb and move within the Heaven's Light from beyond the world.

"The Beyond-Worldly disciples only refined one drop of Pure Yang Blood Essence, which is clearly not enough," at this moment, core disciple Hu Tingwen spoke.

"I..." Zheng Maoze had just offered a drop of Pure Yang blood and wanted to curse. Such blood was precious; did they want him to refine a second drop?

Hu Tingwen said, "Senior brothers, don't misunderstand. My intention is that we should also ask the Outer Sages present to refine a drop of Pure Yang Blood Essence."

"That's feasible," many Beyond-Worldly disciples nodded.

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming turned and walked away. Why should he offer Pure Yang Blood Essence for them? It was utterly impossible.

"No one is allowed to leave!" someone shouted.

Qin Ming ignored the other golden-armored guards and simply strode forward. Zheng Maoze happened to be in this area and naturally wanted to uphold the dignity of the Beyond-Worldly disciples. He said, "I'm talking to you! Why aren't you stopping?"

Qin Ming turned his head and said, "I came to assist, not as anyone's follower. Moreover, my collaborator has already left, so I have no obligation to help you consume Pure Yang blood."

Zheng Maoze said, "Assist? Since you've already come, you should be aware of your position. Hurry up and come over."

"I am a discarded disciple of Tathagata. Do you dare bully me?" Qin Ming said.

"The identity of the discarded disciple of Tathagata is already public; he's not here," Zheng Maoze laughed, walking forward to force this golden-armored guard to offer his blood.

Qin Ming said in a deep voice, "Then I'll tell you the truth: I am a direct descendant of the Six Imperial Qi. Even if you are a Beyond-Worldly disciple, you have no right to order me."

"Why don't you say you're the Six Imperial personified, or the Tathagata himself in this age?" Zheng Maoze actually moved to attack directly.

Qin Ming now possessed a Young Patriarch-level foundation, had even partially mastered the three miraculous arts of the Outer Sage stage, and used the Silk Scripture method to control various scriptures. He genuinely wasn't afraid of him now. Since he couldn't avoid it, he really wanted to test his current strength.

The next moment, Qin Ming decisively made his move. The three miraculous arts and eighteen Heaven's Light Qis merged into one, erupting with a sacred radiance that made him appear like an exiled immortal descended to the mortal world.

"Ah..." Zheng Maoze cried out in alarm. His consciousness spirit light was actually shattered by the opponent's fist, ignited. His physical body was struck by a punch, bones cracking, sending him flying twenty meters away.
