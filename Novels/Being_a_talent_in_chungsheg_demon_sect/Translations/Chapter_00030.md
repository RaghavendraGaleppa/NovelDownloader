Chapter 30: The Peak Master of Heaven-Mending Peak

In his previous life, Lu Yang had meticulously researched array formations. The grand array he ultimately inscribed onto his Blood Sun Sword Pellet was a sword array known as the "Blood-Soaked Heavenly River Sword Array Diagram."

This array was structured according to the Three Powers and Nine Palaces, with the Sword Qi River, activated by the Blood Sun Sword Pellet, serving as its core, complemented by the Heavenly Devil Blood Transformation Divine Light. Lu Yang had also specifically designed three hundred and sixty array nodes. According to his vision, if three hundred and sixty cultivators were stationed within them, the array's power could be unleashed to its utmost.

He had already planned for this. Once he reclaimed his Innate Primordial Qi Myriad Spirits Banner from Liu Xin, he would let the banner spirits inhabit the array nodes, which would not only save effort and be convenient but also allow him to carry it with him.

However, for now, he could only personally command the array.

"Open!" Lu Yang chanted a spell, and the Blood Sun Sword Pellet hummed. Within the array, a heavenly river surged from south to north, covering the sky, boundless as far as the eye could see.

At this moment, Lu Yuanchun, Zhao Xuhe, and everyone else had all fallen into this heavenly river. The river waters roared, meaning an unending stream of sword qi cleaved at them every second. A few cultivators with weaker cultivation only managed to let out a miserable shriek before transforming into a bloody blossom in the heavenly river.

Lu Yuanchun's expression drastically changed upon seeing this.

"This is impossible! Although Master mentioned earlier that this person understood array formations, I didn't give him any time to set one up. How did we still fall into an array?"

Lu Yuanchun naturally couldn't comprehend this. This was because the Blood Sun Sword Pellet was no ordinary magic treasure; it was an Array Treasure. An Array Treasure is a treasure that *is* an array itself. The array forms with a mere thought, requiring no setup at all!

Falling into an array at this moment had completely exceeded Lu Yuanchun's expectations. After all, arrays borrow the wonders of heaven and earth, wield the power of heaven and earth, and are hailed as invincible among peers of the same realm. Though he prided himself on his strength, falling into an array made him lose his confidence.

Could he truly suffer a humiliating defeat today?

Thinking of this, Lu Yuanchun's expression grew even uglier, no longer showing his previous certainty of victory. Even Zhao Xuhe beside him became uneasy: "Senior Brother, this array..."

"Junior Brother, be careful. Today's events might take an unexpected turn." Lu Yuanchun whispered, while also activating his Golden Light Treasure Mirror into the air to protect himself.

At this moment, Lu Yuanchun still held a glimmer of hope. In his view, Lu Yang was merely an ordinary disciple who had stumbled upon a fortuitous encounter. Although he knew many things, he had only recently joined the sect. Even if he understood arrays, how much could he possibly grasp? As for the array before them, perhaps it was a legacy from a predecessor?

However, the very next second, Lu Yang shattered his fantasy.

Lu Yang's expression was cold. With a thought, he pointed a finger, and the previously clear Sword Qi Heavenly River instantly turned a piercing crimson.

Heavenly Devil Blood Transformation Divine Light!

Although this divine ability possessed immense power, claiming to "harm if grazed, and cause death if touched," it also meant that it could only display its might if it struck the target. If it missed, it would be useless.

However, within the "Blood-Soaked Heavenly River Sword Array Diagram," Lu Yang had resolved this flaw. As long as one was inside the array, it was equivalent to being immersed in the divine light! In other words, simply activating it guaranteed a hit!

In an instant, Lu Yuanchun felt a world-shaking tremor. His remaining junior brothers shrieked one after another, then in a flash, turned into human skin husks!

"Oh no!" Lu Yuanchun's face instantly changed drastically. He gritted his teeth, his hand seals shifting, and the aura of the Golden Light Treasure Mirror above his head instantly became chaotic and violent.

Lu Yang took one look and instantly reacted. "Self-detonating a magic treasure? Naive!"

The Golden Light Treasure Mirror was clearly a high-grade magic treasure. If Lu Yuanchun detonated it, he indeed had a chance to tear apart the array diagram and create a path to survival. However, the premise was that Lu Yang didn't understand array formations.

Ordinary arrays, even when presided over, could only operate according to fixed rules; they were "dead arrays." However, with an array master present, it was entirely different. A qualified array master could temporarily adjust the array according to the changes in the battle situation. This transformed a dead array into a "living array," whose power was naturally incomparable. Not to mention that the "Blood-Soaked Heavenly River Sword Array Diagram" was created by Lu Yang himself, making it as easy to control as moving his arm.

Therefore, the moment Lu Yuanchun detonated his magic treasure, Lu Yang acted. He pinched his fingers to calculate with one hand and adjusted the array patterns with the other, instantly dispersing the explosion's power, which was originally concentrated at one point, throughout the entire array.

Once the explosion was dispersed, its power instantly decreased severalfold. The array, which would have been broken, remained perfectly intact. It even seized the opening created by the Golden Light Treasure Mirror's destruction, engulfing Lu Yuanchun and Zhao Xuhe in one fell swoop.

Zhao Xuhe didn't even have time to shriek before instantly turning into a dried corpse.

"Impossible! This villain is actually an array master!?" Lu Yuanchun's face was ashen. He felt his flesh and blood pouring out like a breached dam, on the verge of following in Zhao Xuhe's footsteps and dying a violent death.

"Blood Transformation Divine Light..."

At the critical juncture of life and death, intense fear quickly extinguished his rage. Lu Yuanchun's eyes were about to split, yet he was helpless. He finally resigned himself and lowered his head.

"Boom!"

The next second, a jade pendant on Lu Yuanchun's waist quietly shattered, then burst forth with infinite brilliant light, instantly breaking through Lu Yang's grand array!

Lu Yang's pupils contracted upon seeing this. He looked up at the sky. His gaze fell upon the brilliant light, which, high above his head, ten thousand zhang in the sky, outlined a calm, solemn, and imposing giant face that showed no anger!

That face showed no emotion whatsoever. Its eyes were as bright as the sun and moon. Even looking at it for just a moment made Lu Yang's eyes sting and tear up. His True Qi was inexplicably weakened by seventy to eighty percent, almost making him unable to maintain his escape light, threatening to make him fall from the sky.

The face looked down, its voice like thunder from the mountains: "Impudent!"

The voice was not loud, yet it seemed to speak the will of Heaven, making Lu Yang an existence loathed by heaven and earth. The surrounding spiritual energy even shied away from him as if avoiding a plague.

The invisible gaze felt truly as heavy as Mount Tai, pressing down on Lu Yang's body. The ground around him even cracked inch by inch because of it.

Such a scene naturally startled the entire Heaven-Mending Peak. For a time, countless disciples on Heaven-Mending Peak who were in seclusion were awakened. They emerged from their cave dwellings, looking at the giant face in the sky with expressions of terror.

"Greetings, Peak Master!"
"Greetings, Peak Master!"

Some old disciples of Heaven-Mending Peak recognized the face. Their scalps instantly tingled, and without another word, they prostrated themselves on the ground, kowtowing repeatedly.

The Peak Master of Heaven-Mending Peak! Lu Yang finally learned the identity of Zhao Xuhe's mysterious Master: the Peak Master of Heaven-Mending Peak, a Foundation Establishment True Human who presided over one of the Four Inner Peaks of the Primordial Saint Sect!

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

As the words fell, the array diagram Lu Yang had painstakingly refined in his previous life instantly began to crumble. Large sections of the array patterns even exploded on the spot.

Seeing this, Lu Yang couldn't help but show a hint of helplessness. The gap between Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment completely exceeded his imagination. Twenty years of his hard work and achievement were no match for just two words from a Foundation Establishment True Human!

A mere reprimand, yet it reached such a degree?
