# Chapter 13: Immortal Encounter (Happy May Day!)

"Sister Zheng, we've got a situation!" That evening, just as Sister Zheng was preparing to cultivate, she received a message from Senior Brother Zhao. She quickly opened her door and stepped outside.

By then, the protective formation outside had already been withdrawn by Senior Brother Zhao. Without hesitation, he activated several talismans on himself and rushed in a certain direction.

Sister Zheng hesitated briefly. She hadn't packed her belongings, but considering this was the government office—the safest place in the mortal world—and that Senior Brother Zhao had already taken the lead, she also activated several talismans on herself and gave chase.

The Great Xia Dynasty was their sect's territory. The sect strictly prohibited outside cultivators from entering mortal areas—cultivators had their own world. The mortal realm was the foundation of their sect; without ordinary people, how could the sect continue to exist? When non-sect cultivators appeared within their territory, sect disciples were obligated to investigate. More importantly, eliminating such cultivators not only allowed them to claim the deceased's possessions but also earned them rewards from the sect.

Ge Tianqing was a rogue cultivator merely passing through Great Xia. Traveling through mortal lands protected by sects was ordinarily an uneventful affair—as long as he didn't reveal his cultivation abilities, there would be no trouble. His destination would require several times the distance if he avoided Great Xia's territory and the sect-protected mortal lands, so he chose the shorter route. As night fell, he spotted Nanling City—a perfect place to replenish his supplies.

Legends spoke of immortal cultivators who could survive without mortal sustenance, but that didn't apply to Qi Refinement cultivators like him. Like ordinary people, they still needed food to replenish their energy. As a rogue cultivator, Ge Tianqing didn't have access to the precious spirit-rich food that sect disciples enjoyed.

By the time he arrived, the city gates of Nanling had long been closed. He decided to scale the city wall, using a light-foot technique without any attempt to conceal it, assuming no cultivators were present in Nanling.

Unbeknownst to him, Senior Brother Zhao's formation had been monitoring spiritual fluctuations to detect cultivators. The moment Ge Tianqing used his technique, the formation picked it up.

As he walked down the street, searching for an inn to stay the night, he suddenly froze, sensing something from a certain direction.

Senior Brother Zhao and Sister Zheng moved swiftly, closing the distance until they were within each other's detection range.

"Be careful, Sister Zheng—this is a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator!" Senior Brother Zhao's expression darkened as he transmitted the warning.

He was now convinced that Ge Tianqing was the cultivator they were looking for—the one responsible for the explosion in the government office's rear garden. His strength matched, and his appearance at this time was too coincidental.

Places like Nanling Prefecture rarely saw cultivators for decades—how could this be mere coincidence?

Hearing that their opponent was at the late stage of Qi Refinement, Sister Zheng tapped her storage pouch and summoned a small shield, holding it before her. Senior Brother Zhao was equally quick, drawing a longsword while a turtle-shell-shaped shield orbited around him.

Ge Tianqing had wanted to speak, but seeing the two cultivators draw their magical artifacts, he knew words were pointless. He retreated, summoning a black iron hammer.

When Senior Brother Zhao saw the hammer, he actually relaxed.

"He's a rogue cultivator—prepare to kill him swiftly!" he transmitted to Sister Zheng.

He judged Ge Tianqing's status by his poverty. In a life-or-death confrontation, the man had only produced a low-grade hammer artifact. Though low-grade hammers could be powerful, a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator using one clearly indicated his background.

Senior Brother Zhao was confident in swiftly eliminating Ge Tianqing. Before arriving, he and Sister Zheng had already activated multiple talismans, whereas Ge Tianqing bore no such enhancements.

The gap between sect cultivators and rogue ones was vast—this was why most cultivators strove to join sects, only resorting to rogue cultivation if they had no other choice.

The battle erupted right there in the street—a conflict Nanling City was never meant to witness—and it turned ferocious from the very first exchange.

Senior Brother Zhao's mid-grade sword artifact shot forth, slashing toward Ge Tianqing.

Though Ge Tianqing's equipment was inferior, his combat experience as a rogue cultivator was extensive. His low-grade hammer struck the incoming sword.

The collision of artifacts sent a shockwave of spiritual energy rippling outward, shattering the stone pavement and sending debris flying into nearby buildings. The deafening impact was followed by the sound of countless windows and doors being smashed, then the panicked cries of the residents inside.

Neither Ge Tianqing nor the two sect disciples paid any heed to the destruction their battle caused.

Sister Zheng's attack arrived next—a low-grade hairpin artifact. Though not particularly powerful, it was extremely subtle. While Ge Tianqing blocked Senior Brother Zhao's strike, the hairpin darted toward his shoulder.

Sister Zheng had launched the hairpin while simultaneously activating an offensive talisman. Ge Tianqing, distracted by the talisman, failed to notice the hairpin until it was too late.

He barely managed to duck, but the hairpin still grazed his shoulder, leaving a bleeding wound infused with Sister Zheng's spiritual energy. Though his cultivation was higher and dispelling the energy wouldn't be difficult, doing so mid-battle would divide his focus and weaken his combat effectiveness.

"You'll pay for this!" Ge Tianqing snarled, his face contorted with rage.

Being ambushed by two sect disciples—who had immediately gone for the kill—left him seething. The ruthless survival instincts of a rogue cultivator flared to life under the threat of death. Rogue cultivators weren't entirely without their own opportunities.

Knowing he had to fight with everything he had, or die here today, he swept a hand over his storage pouch and produced a stack of low-grade talismans. Without hesitation, he hurled the entire bundle at Senior Brother Zhao.

Flames, ice, wind blades, and other energy-based attacks surged toward Senior Brother Zhao, who hastily activated a mid-grade defensive talisman. Fearing it might not be enough, he retreated, recalling his sword artifact and channeling more spiritual energy into his turtle-shell shield.

As a sect disciple, he was gold—Ge Tianqing was mere rubble. He would never risk his life against such an opponent.

In his retreat, he left Sister Zheng alone to face Ge Tianqing.
