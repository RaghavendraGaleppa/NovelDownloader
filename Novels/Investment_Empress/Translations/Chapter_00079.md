## Chapter 79: The Suffocating Ying Bing, Li Mo's Ultimate Move, Victory Decided?!

His first time, Little Li experienced sudden enlightenment in the Sword Dao. His sword suddenly slowed. Without needing to speak, Ying Bing, opposite him, tacitly slowed her offensive as well. This process lasted only a few seconds.

The next second, when Li Mo struck again, at first glance, the sword's edge seemed much weaker. Amidst the woven tapestry of sword glints and phantom blossoms, the Crimson Sky Sword was like a dying candle in the rain, swaying repeatedly but never extinguishing. Instead, it grew stronger and stronger. However, a hint of satisfaction flashed in Ying Bing's eyes. He understood. The momentum of a prairie fire lies in its ceaseless vitality, in the ebb and flow of its power.

Clang, clang, clang—

Ice-blue and crimson sword lights collided dozens of times in the blink of an eye. To outsiders, True Disciple Li was initially suppressed, constantly teetering on the brink of danger yet always remaining upright, gradually transforming from weak to strong, and now stood on equal footing with Ying Bing.

"These two's sword techniques, they must have been practicing since they were in their mothers' wombs, right?"
"I'm already struggling to understand."
"What True Disciple Li is using, it looks like the Prairie Fire Sword Art, but not quite..."

Their spar had already surpassed most people's understanding of the Nine Meridians Grand Martial Gathering. This was simply not the level a rising star should possess. Gradually, everyone held their breath, their eyes fixed on the arena.

The next second, the Crimson Sky Sword's momentum suddenly surged. Like a raging prairie fire, it tore through the heavy curtain of rain. Gasps of astonishment immediately erupted in the arena. Was True Disciple Li going to win? Was victory to be decided so quickly?

Li Mo, however, knew what was happening. The 'Ice Block' was deliberately allowing him to familiarize himself with the sword momentum, thus intentionally not changing her moves. This single sword strike would leave ninety-nine hundred and ninety-nine out of ten thousand people helpless; the sole exception was Ying Bing.

Indeed. Cling—

The sword's edge sliced through the wind, about to pierce Ying Bing, but the Heavenly Frost Sword was already swaying before his eyes. The tips of the two swords collided with incredible precision. The Crimson Sky, imbued with the intent of a prairie fire, pressed the Heavenly Frost to its extreme limit of bending. But Ying Bing's sword momentum, like a dying candle in the wind, did not vanish. Li Mo felt a chill in his heart. This scene gave him a sense of déjà vu. Too familiar. In a flash, he saw Ying Bing's slightly pursed lips and quickly reacted. Prairie Fire Sword Momentum!

A sense of crisis surged in Li Mo's heart. He redoubled his strength, redirected his sword, and without a moment's pause or needing to recover his qi, struck again. This was the advantage of having thirty-six main meridians in the Qi-Blood Realm. His reserves of power were inexhaustible; he didn't need to worry about his strength being depleted.

Clang—

The Heavenly Frost Sword twirled in her delicate wrist, and the Wind and Rain Obscurity momentum of the Flower-Seeking Sword Art resurfaced, intertwined with the ceaseless prairie fire intent. One sword, two momenta! The Prairie Fire momentum focused on accumulation and building power, while the Wind and Rain Obscurity momentum focused on ceaseless continuation and overwhelming with sheer force. Ying Bing had perfectly overlaid the two, merging them without any discord, even compensating for each other's weaknesses!

Li Mo sighed inwardly. The 'Ice Block' was still the 'Ice Block'. Trying to go fifty-fifty with her just by using sword techniques was indeed unrealistic. Of course, Little Li had no intention of winning solely with his sword from the start. He actively disengaged using the Wind Shadow Step, his body abruptly retreating over ten zhang.

"Impressive." Li Mo said sincerely.
"It's nothing." Ying Bing didn't pursue, standing in place with her sword on her back, showing no trace of self-satisfaction. In her previous life, she hadn't mastered two momenta simultaneously in the Inner Qi Realm; she only became proficient in it at the God-Sighting Realm. For him to make her use it now was already admirable enough. What surprised her even more was Li Mo's extended breath and profound strength, which she had never seen in any other Qi-Blood Realm practitioner. This... was it also from the inheritance he obtained?

The audience below was completely silent at this moment. Even on the stage, there was a period of silence. The brief exchange between the two just now had already surpassed the limits of their understanding of the word 'genius'.

"Are they even letting others live?" Elder Su of Luoxia Peak finally let out a long breath. Once upon a time, she was also hailed as a sword dao genius. However, it was only during the God-Sighting Realm that she vaguely touched upon the existence of sword momentum, and only during the Inner Scenery Realm, contemplating the scenery within her heart, that she truly mastered one. These two youngsters were more outrageous than the last...

"Is there a possibility," Qian Bufan mumbled, "that Ying Bing hasn't used her full power yet?" Everyone immediately became even more flustered and confused. Indeed, what Ying Bing possessed was far more than just sword techniques. The inheritance from the Clear Abyss, her innate physique, none of it had been truly unleashed yet. She hadn't even used her inner qi a moment ago.

"Let's continue to watch." Elder Han He watched Li Mo with profound eyes. Ying Bing hadn't used her full power, but had that boy?

As the elders whispered amongst themselves, "I'm going to get serious," Li Mo said.

"I'm one realm above you." Ying Bing looked at the boy, now serious, and her red lips slightly parted: "If you can touch the hem of my robe, you win." The 'Ice Block' rarely showed her domineering side. This meant she was also getting serious.

"Good." These words ignited a small flame in Li Mo's heart. Commonly known as getting a bit hot-headed.

The next moment, both figures in the arena moved.

Buzz—

An intense, sharp aura of martial slaughter vibrated, and its mere presence carved marks into the bluestone ground. Li Mo himself seemed to transform into a precious weapon, dazzling to behold. The Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body was activated with full power for the first time to face an enemy. From the Eye of Heavenly Mandate, he had long known that the 'Ice Block's' strongest reliance was definitely not her Sword Dao. It was her very being! So Little Li decided to go hard.

Boom—

The Crimson Sky Sword, enveloped by a sharp, murderous aura, hummed with a metallic ring. This profound weapon had become the eye of a storm. Carrying boundless keenness and surging power, it threatened to swallow Ying Bing whole. One force breaks all methods. This was not something Li Mo had comprehended from the sword.

At the same time, as the Heavenly Frost Sword moved, clouds and mist instantly arose, seemingly nonexistent yet omnipresent. Within their birth and demise, a sharp, hazy edge was concealed. No sword light was visible, yet it felt as though ten thousand swords were pressing down upon him. Even though he was only fighting Ying Bing, Li Mo inexplicably felt as if he had fallen into a heavy encirclement. No matter how Li Mo attacked, no matter how fierce his martial slaughter aura was, it failed to stir many ripples in the misty light.

The crowd in the arena was completely entranced. If, at first, both their sword techniques surpassed their comprehension, now they couldn't even tell who had the upper hand. They could only see the misty light appearing and disappearing, and the sharp power surging into the vastness. The qi dynamics of the two were so intense that a thin mist even began to rise in the air.

Cling—

Li Mo finally caught Ying Bing's figure amidst the illusory and real misty light, and without hesitation, unleashed a full-powered strike. However, what awaited him was not clear skies after rain, but the sight of the maiden's figure slowly fading away. He struck empty air.

"No wonder she said I'd win if I touched her robe's hem..." Li Mo was truly sweating profusely. At the same time, he deeply knew that he could not continue to waste time. The numerous illusory moves hidden within the misty light, imbued with Ying Bing's inner qi, were incredibly chilling, making his thoughts almost sluggish at this point. Soon, even moving became difficult for him. This was the Red Heavenly Mandate, this was... someone born to answer the call of the martial world. The 'Ice Block' was so strong it made one despair.

The elders on the high platform also sighed imperceptibly. If they were to go up, even maintaining their Inner Qi Profound Core Realm cultivation, they wouldn't have a single shred of a chance against Ying Bing. They probably wouldn't last as long as Li Mo. They saw even more within the exchange. Ying Bing was using misty light and inner qi to simulate sword qi. If compared to Xiao Qin's externalized inner qi, it was laughably childish. Moreover, it wasn't just a simple simulation; sometimes it was nimble and ethereal, sometimes mighty and fierce, sometimes ancient and unadorned... ever-changing, yet resonating with each other. One word: superb. Two words: terrifying.

"Huuu..."

"If misty light can hide a sword, then can the sharp aura of martial slaughter also..." Suddenly, Li Mo seemed to have an epiphany. Meanwhile, his other hand, his left, hidden beneath his sleeve, quietly grasped the Star Mace. Everything around him suddenly slowed.

"Hm?" Ying Bing instantly sensed that even her movements had become sluggish. Opposite her, Li Mo had, unnoticed, drawn closer. The young man wasn't using his sword; the Crimson Sky hung from his right hand. He lifted the sleeve of his left arm, or rather, the hammer within the sleeve, and slowly brought it down. Its speed wasn't fast. Yet, it gave an impression of inevitability, as if no matter where one fled, to the ends of the earth, or how one dodged, it could not be evaded.

Stabilize Heaven and Earth!

Ying Bing was thoughtful. The sword qi filling the air contracted, a wisp of Taiyin power acting as a thread, twisting the sword qi into a ball.

Boom—

Time around them seemed to freeze. The next instant, countless auras erupted, uncontrollably shooting out in all directions. The scene instantly became somewhat chaotic. Shangguan Wancang slapped the table and rose, instantly appearing on the stage, pressing down with a single hand. In his palm, there seemed to be a circle that devoured all things, capable of absorbing everything, returning all to nothingness, making the storm dissipate invisibly. His gaze, burning bright, fixed on the center of the arena. Everyone else did the same. Who won?

However, under the watchful eyes of all, everyone suddenly fell silent again. What had just happened?

Little Li's strike shattered the condensed sword qi. He had used an ultimate technique impossible for the Qi-Blood Realm to activate; even with his thirty-six meridians of qi-blood power, he was almost completely exhausted. However, that wisp of Taiyin power did not dissipate, making him feel as if he had fallen into an ice cellar. It was truly effing cold.

Before he could make any move, in a daze, he wrapped his arms around Ying Bing's waist, tumbling into her embrace, and falling to the ground with her.

Mmm...

Little Li's eyes were obscured. His already sluggish mind now held only one thought: "Even an 'Ice Block's' embrace is just as soft, like warm, fragrant jade..."

Ying Bing seemed to be stunned. She didn't push him away immediately.

The crowd: "!? "
The elders: "!!? "
The guests from various sects: "!!!? "
A passing dog: "??? "

Their suspended hearts... finally died.
