# Chapter 511: The Calamity Begins

Sanzang was finally alarmed and rushed to the courtyard.

The simple monk's robe on his body moved without wind, indicating that his heart was in extreme turmoil.

However, when he saw the scene in the courtyard clearly...

The priceless Heavenly Earthly Spirit Peach Tree, which carried the heavy treasures of the Zhenyuan Temple, had completely turned into charcoal. The chaotic aura of the Heavenly and Earthly Origins was dissipating all over the ground, and two Taoist boys of unknown life or death lay in a pool of blood...

The compassion and composure on Sanzang's face could no longer be maintained.

This was completely beyond his expectations.

The thousand-year grand plan of the Bodhisattva Zenith Pure Land was going to be ruined by a wild monkey?!

Even with his excellent temperament and self-cultivation, seeing this scene almost made him choke with anger.

In this way, this was just like jumping straight into the trap of the Primordial Demon Sect.

"Ah!"

This always gentle and peaceful monk, like a lion whose tail had been stepped on, let out a sharp and unseemly roar. His pale face instantly turned red, and the finger pointing at Wukong trembled non-stop due to extreme anger.

"Wild monkey! Wicked beast! Untamable demon monkey!"

Sanzang completely lost his composure, shouting at Wukong with all his might.

"You... you have caused a disaster of immense proportions, a disaster of immense proportions!
This humble monk warned you a thousand times, not to cause trouble, not to stir up misfortune!
You, on the other hand, if you were greedy for food, that's one thing, but you... you actually dared to destroy this world's rare treasure.
Do you know what kind of karma this is?! This is the sacred treasure of the Daoist Abode of the True Lord of the Nine Heavens, Clear Source, Responding Thunder, Manifesting Wonders, and Spreading Salvation!
It is the face of the Nine Immortal Mountains of the Primordial Origin Sect!"

His mind was a flash of lightning and a peal of thunder.

Not to mention anything else, if it weren't for the Three Sects, the treasures of other True Lords could be destroyed, and it would be fine to just give some compensation.

But the Primordial Origin Sect has now drawn the line, clearly baiting them to take the hook.

He had warned Wukong a thousand times, yet Wukong still bit down eagerly.

Sanzang's heart was struck with anger. Ever since he was chosen by the World Honored One Tathagata, enlightened to be the World Honored One's walking representative in the world, and embarked on the path of spreading Buddhism in the Eastern Wasteland...

Although there were twists and turns, relying on the potential of the innate Daoist fetus of his incarnation, the support of the Bodhisattva Zenith Pure Land, and the grand ritual secretly guided, he had always believed that receiving the throne of the Self-Ruler King Buddha, though difficult, would be a matter of course.

The Eastern Wasteland is vast and rich, plagued by demonic disasters, and lacks the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Primordial Origin Sect. It is the perfect soil for establishing a Buddhist kingdom on earth and gathering supreme vows.

It would only be necessary to make the demons and monsters in the Eastern Wasteland suffer a bit. Perhaps later, when they are guided into the Bodhisattva Zenith Pure Land, they could add a bit of foundation to the Pure Land.

However, this "Zhenyuan Temple" abruptly stood in the path of his planned propagation, the appearance of the True Lord of Spreading Salvation, and the temptation of the Heavenly Earthly Spirit Peach Tree were all clear and open schemes.

Sanzang knew that there are countless calamities in the world, and establishing a Buddhist kingdom on earth would not be smooth sailing.

He had thought he could stabilize the situation, at least maintaining a temporary "peace" on the surface.

Wukong stealing the peaches, though troublesome, was still within the acceptable range; it would just require paying some price to apologize.

But now...

This wild monkey has actually smashed this immortal root treasure tree.

He has also injured, and possibly even killed, the Taoist boys under the True Lord.

This is not only slapping the face of the True Lord of Spreading Salvation!

It is kicking the gates of the Nine Immortal Mountains of the Primordial Origin Sect with his feet!

It is also tearing apart the compassionate cloak of "spreading Buddhism to the East, saving all sentient beings" that the Bodhisattva Zenith Pure Land has cultivated for hundreds of years, revealing the evidence of "allowing demons to act violently and destroying others' treasures."

"This one strike... the path of spreading the Dharma to the East, I'm afraid... is completely cut off!"

Sanzang felt a chill in his heart and despair, feeling darkness clouding his vision before his eyes.

The incarnation of Amitabha was beheaded by the Pure Yang True Lord with a single, unstoppable sword. Although he is still the walking representative of the World Honored One Tathagata, he has ultimately lost his ultimate means.

That True Lord of Spreading Salvation now has a reason to make a move.

The grand ritual needed for the throne of the Self-Ruler King Buddha, the pure Buddhist light and vows required, will inevitably be stained with countless infamies after this incident. The demons and monsters of the Eastern Wasteland will be even harder to subdue, and even the reputation of the Bodhisattva Zenith Pure Land's teachings in the Taihua Void Realm will suffer a heavy blow.

He thought it was a game he was sure to win, only to suddenly find that the pieces were completely out of control, and they had even personally overturned the board.

Xu Yunfan of the Cold Crow Pass was naturally ecstatic to see this scene, even dancing for joy.

Such a grand spectacle would definitely attract the attention of most of the Bodhisattva Zenith Pure Land and the Primordial Origin Sect.

That True Lord of Spreading Salvation set up his Daoist abode, clearly to trap the Bodhisattva Zenith Pure Land.

Otherwise, that immortal peach tree would not have been so easily broken by Wukong's staff.

Now that the Primordial Origin Sect has achieved its wish, the Bodhisattva Zenith Pure Land, wanting to settle the matter, will likely have to pay a huge price. The spread of Buddhism to the Eastern Wasteland will likely have a share for the Primordial Origin Sect.

Wukong was also confused by Sanzang's sudden intense reaction. As the immortal tree was completely destroyed, the strange aura that disturbed the mind along with it also dissipated, and the fury provoked by the evil aura quickly receded like the tide.

Looking at the dead silent charcoal tree and the two Taoist boys, and without Xu Yunfan secretly interfering, endless regret finally surged from the depths of his heart, washing away the previous violence.

"Master... Master, please calm your anger!"

Wukong hurriedly put away his iron staff, his face showing unprecedented panic and remorse, his voice a bit weak, "It was this disciple who was impatient for a moment and lost control... I... I will go apologize to the True Lord right now. To be killed or cut..."

"Apologize?! You wild monkey! Stubborn and unenlightened!"

Sanzang couldn't listen to a single word at this moment. With anger and fire attacking his heart, the finger pointing at Wukong trembled even more, his voice sharp and grating, "Your apology, I'm afraid, wouldn't even be worth a single root of that tree.
Your nature is hard to change, your demon nature is hard to remove! I was truly blind to let such a wicked creature accompany me on the scriptures quest. Do you know..."

"Enough."

A voice as cold as ice interrupted Sanzang's nearly uncontrollable roar.

At some point, a figure shrouded in a clear, misty immortal light had appeared next to the charcoal-like spirit peach tree.

It was none other than the True Lord of the Nine Heavens, Clear Source, Responding Thunder, Manifesting Wonders, and Spreading Salvation.

The hazy halo on his face had already dissipated, revealing a face that seemed young, with eyebrows slanting upwards towards the temples, but eyes as deep as an abyss.

However, at this moment, there was no expression on this face. His eyes, like an ancient cold pool, swept coldly over the blackened tree stump that was split into pieces and had completely lost its source of light, and then fell upon Qingfeng and Mingyue, who lay on the ground, life or death unknown.

That gaze contained not a trace of anger, yet it was more terrifying than anger. But the hint of joy deep within his eyes was released without restraint, making Sanzang's heart turn cold.

It's over.

He slowly raised his head, his gaze sweeping over Sanzang and his three disciples, finally fixing on Wukong, who held the iron staff and was full of remorse and fear.

"You smashed my treasure tree, you beat my Taoist boys..."

The voice of the True Lord of Spreading Salvation was calm, as if he were narrating a fact unrelated to himself.

"I originally intended to treat you as honored guests, but I never expected that I would welcome a group of wicked and evil guests who bring disaster to the world."
