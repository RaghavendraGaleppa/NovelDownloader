# Chapter 32: Blocking the Path

Li Shiming shared a special connection with the Geng Gold Needle, allowing him to control its direction. However, as this was his first time activating the Geng Gold Art and he had borrowed the concept from bullets, the needle's straight-line speed was too fast. By the time he tried to control it, the needle had already plunged deep into the ground, losing its forward momentum.

To his surprise, the spiritual energy consumed this time was only one-tenth of what was used when casting the "Spring Breeze and Rain Art." As a second-level Qi Refinement cultivator, a single use of the "Spring Breeze and Rain Art" consumed one-third of his total spiritual energy. 

He wondered why there was such a difference between the two basic spells. Though he had several theories, without a teacher to guide him, he couldn't determine which was correct. 

With enough spiritual energy remaining, Li Shiming decided to learn the next spell, the "Earth Spirit Art." This spell adjusted the spiritual energy within spirit fields and seemed the least useful to him. Yet, it was a fundamental skill for spirit farmers—necessary for resetting the field's energy after each planting cycle.

Drawing inspiration from aerial footage of landscapes, he quickly grasped the concept behind the "Earth Spirit Art." However, casting it consumed one-third of his spiritual energy, similar to the "Spring Breeze and Rain Art." Fortunately, he wouldn’t need to use it frequently, sparing him another major energy drain.

When he stepped out of his study, his demeanor had subtly changed. He now possessed an offensive spell—a reliable means of self-defense. Unlike talismans, the "Geng Gold Art" could be used ten times before needing to replenish his spiritual energy.

Seeing her master’s smile, Siqin’s mood lifted. "Prepare gifts and have Moyan ready the carriage," Li Shiming instructed. "I’ll visit my father’s friends."

After last night’s assassination attempt, word of his arrival in the capital had likely spread. Whether his father’s connections were trustworthy or not, courtesy demanded he pay his respects. 

As Siqin left, his fingers traced intricate spiritual runes in the air, summoning a nearly invisible Geng Gold Needle.

With practice, he guided the needle through the air. The control range was limited—about five meters—beyond which the needle could only fly straight, with a maximum range of thirty meters. 

Testing its power, he found the needle could pierce trees and rocks effortlessly. Though devastating against ordinary mortals, its small size made it less lethal to cultivators unless it struck vital points.

By the time he boarded the carriage, he activated his concealment art, masking his spiritual vortex, which now held only forty percent of its energy. 

Visiting his father’s high-ranking friends—officials ranging from fifth to second rank—was a formality. At the residence of a second-rank official, he merely delivered gifts without meeting the man. Unfazed, Li Shiming had no interest in politics.

"Take the detour through Prince’s Manor Avenue," he ordered Moyan.

Though unfamiliar with the capital, Moyan had studied the routes thoroughly. The wide, quiet street, lined with towering red walls, housed the mansions of imperial princes. 

"Prince Shun’s Manor," Li Shiming murmured, his gaze sharpening with hostility. His uncle, Li Wenfeng, served as the manor’s chief steward, implying Prince Shun’s involvement in past schemes. 

The prince’s influence meant little to a cultivator like Li Shiming. This scouting mission was preparation for future action.

"Master, someone’s blocking the road," Moyan suddenly reported.

Frowning, Li Shiming stepped out to find a middle-aged man in a blue Daoist robe standing before the carriage. A storage pouch hung at his waist. 

At the man’s wave, Moyan collapsed onto the carriage shaft. 

"Moyan!" Li Shiming exclaimed. 

"Don’t worry—he’s merely asleep," the man said calmly. 

"Who are you, and why stop us?" Li Shiming demanded, steadying himself. 

"I am Gu Jia, a stationed cultivator of the Tianhai Sect. I’m here to verify your identity." 

Gu Jia’s piercing gaze stripped away Li Shiming’s concealment, exposing his second-level Qi Refinement cultivation. The inspection was invasive, leaving no room for refusal.
