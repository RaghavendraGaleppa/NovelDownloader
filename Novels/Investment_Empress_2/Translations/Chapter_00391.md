# Chapter 391: Counterattack! The Qingyuan Sect Meeting (1/2)

The mist around Li Mo dissipated as he descended from mid-air. He found the Happy Lamb Hotpot Restaurant deserted, without a single soul in sight.

Just moments ago, it had seemed bustling from a distance.

Frowning, he landed on the ground, only to find two figures sitting at the entrance, blocking the light streaming in from inside.

The Eye of Providence automatically activated.

**[Name: Jiang Yu]**

**[Age: 22]**

**[Constitution: True Dragon Body, Emperor Sword Bone (Not fully belonging to him).]**

**[Realm: Nine Apertures of Divine Observation.]**

At this point, the information displayed by the Eye of Providence flickered.

This was the most complex Fate color Li Mo had ever seen with the Eye of Providence.

Gold, mixed with a hint of red.

Normally, this is a sign of Fate transformation, potentially developing in a better direction.

However, this hint of red within the gold was faintly grayish, even blackish.

After a moment's pause, the Eye of Providence finally gave its evaluation.

**[Evaluation: Possessing the same constitution as Grand Martial Emperor Taizu, he was supposed to walk the path of invincibility in this era, shouldering the fortune of the dynasty. However, his rise was due to the Great Yu Dynasty, and his fall is also due to the Great Yu Dynasty...]**

**[Recent Encounter: Discovering that Jiang Chulong, whose Sword Bone he had long since taken, shows signs of a new Sword Bone growing within her. He wants to test out how far she has come.]**

How did he test her?

Li Mo's expression changed. He could already hear the sounds from inside, similar to the sound of bamboo shoots frying meat from his childhood, but evidently much, much heavier.

He stepped into the hotpot restaurant.

Just in time to see the pink-clad maid's withered willow branch whipping down with a whistling wind.

Jiang Chulong had many new bloodstains on her body, dyeing her new clothes a different color. The pink-dressed girl was ruthless in her attacks; the flesh was broken, but the clothes remained intact.

At that instant, a surge of anger burned up from Li Mo's chest, his hair almost catching fire.

But he didn't lose his reason. He plucked a single hair, letting it drift with the wind into the hotpot restaurant's backyard, and then flicked his finger, sending the round, lustrant Spirit Pearl of the Mirage God out.

"Get out."

Jiang Yu's dual pupils looked back, and the green-robed woman beside him spoke with an icy expression.

But no matter how cold her face was, it couldn't be colder than Li Mo's icy expression.

"I am the owner here."

"Brother Li Mo..."

Seeing Li Mo enter, Jiang Chulong finally pursed her lips, damp traces faintly appearing on the cloth strip.

"Chulong, hit her back. Don't hold back."

Li Mo's voice was very soft, yet it sounded exceptionally clear.

"Heh..."

The pink-dressed girl seemed to have heard a joke. Forget a hotpot restaurant owner; even if the Domain Lord of the Eastern Wasteland or a State Governor were here, they wouldn't dare speak to stop her.

Besides, Jiang Chulong was already crippled, no different from an ordinary serving boy in a tavern.

She swung her arm, the withered willow branch carrying a mournful whistling wind, aiming straight for Jiang Chulong's face.

If this hit landed, that small goose-egg face would surely be disfigured.

However, when Jiang Chulong saw Li Mo's calm eyes, her panicked heart inexplicably calmed down.

Brother Li Mo said she could fight back.

Relying on the confidence Li Mo gave her, she firmly picked up the peach blossom branch.

*Slap—*

The sword intent within the peach blossom branch was tenacious and sharp, severing the withered willow branch in half and even coiling upwards.

The pink-dressed girl's sleeve was shredded, and a few drops of blood dripped down.

She looked utterly shocked, never expecting the usually soft Jiang Chulong to unleash such astonishing sharpness in her attack.

Jiang Yu's dual pupils flashed violently. With a glance from him, the green-robed woman holding a sword beside him threw the long sword in her arms.

It was actually a Profound Weapon.

The pink-dressed girl caught the sword and counterattacked.

*Ding, ding, ding—*

For a time, sword lights flickered within the hotpot restaurant, shadows of swords layering upon each other. Neither party used their cultivation level; they were purely comparing swordsmanship.

The result was that the sword maid from the Tianshan Sword Manor was suppressed and beaten by the little Princess Jiang.

The pink-dressed sword maid suddenly moved like a butterfly passing through flowers, the sword light in her hand flaring brilliantly.

---

The sword intent of this strike was like a long river amidst the clouds, falling from the ninth heaven, carrying a vaguely similar origin to the Crossing Clouds Sword Intent.

Without using cultivation, this strike could make it difficult for a武者 at the Internal Breath Realm to resist.

Facing this domineering and terrifying sword strike, Jiang Chulong did not retreat but advanced instead.

The peach blossom branch seemed to flicker, unleashing dozens or even hundreds of sword lights, among which one appeared exceptionally pure, bright, tenacious, and firm.

The sword light flashed and vanished.

The Profound Weapon sword in the pink-dressed girl's hand flew out, plunging point first into the ground.

If she hadn't let go just now, her five fingers would have been severed.

However, the peach blossom branch in Jiang Chulong's hand still didn't stop, because Brother Li Mo had said not to hold back.

Having lost her sword.

The pink-dressed sword maid became even more flustered and embarrassed, forced to dodge left and right.

To put it simply, she couldn't even fight back anymore; she could only be chased and beaten.

"Enough!"

Jiang Yu stood up.

"Not enough!"

Li Mo met those dual pupils without avoiding them in the slightest.

"Your identity is noble, but my small shop has its own rules."

Jiang Yu stood up, no anger visible in his dual pupils.

He was seriously scrutinizing this youth who claimed to be the hotpot restaurant owner and ranked fourth on the Hidden Dragon List.

"She practices martial arts. Is that related to you?"

"It was me. What are you going to do about it?"

"You have committed a capital crime!"

Jiang Yu's aura intertwined, manifesting a majestic divine will.

A golden dragon with prominent horns and scales radiating golden brilliance, holding an Emperor Sword in its mouth, hovered in the air.

Beneath where it circled, there seemed to be a magnificent city.

Was it the Imperial Capital?

It looked somewhat like it.

Divine Sword Golden Dragon Suppresses the Emperor's Realm.

Perhaps when this city fully materializes, Jiang Yu would break through the Inner Scene, but just the pressure from his divine will at the Nine Apertures of Divine Observation realm was enough to cover a radius of dozens of miles with its domineering and sacred aura.

Within a fifty-mile radius, pedestrians felt a sense of dread, as if they could only kowtow and dare not look up. Their knees went weak and were pressed to the ground.

The dragon's roar of the Golden Dragon rose to the heavens.

Qingyuan Sect.

Main Peak Hall.

The elders were holding a meeting. Shangguan Wencang sat in the Sect Master's seat, taking a puff from his pipe and speaking slowly:

"The Crown Prince has arrived. We must showcase the excellent spiritual outlook of the Qingyuan Sect. Each peak should perform its duties, maintaining a stable and positive development trend."

"Cough, the new peak master of the Rare Beast Peak has yet to be selected, and the hygiene environment of the異獸 needs improvement. After the meeting, we must organize the disciples to arrange a thorough cleaning."

"The Alchemy Peak has made new, breakthrough progress in external alchemy. Although only Li Mo succeeded, it still expanded our thinking and pioneered a new path. We can focus on showcasing this research to the Highness later."

"The Ruyi Peak has also made new explorations in the Dao of Painting. The 'animation' technique developed by disciple Ouyang allows the Divine Observation Diagrams to become more vivid, promoting the cultivation progress of Divine Observation realm disciples, and has the potential to be popularized throughout the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands."

"Cough, by the way, tell Ouyang to put away his 'hobbies.' If the Highness sees them, he might think the Ruyi Peak is involved in some illegal industry..."

"Does anyone have anything else to add?"

After Shangguan Wencang finished speaking, he coughed lightly, picked up the porcelain jar beside him, blew on it, and took a sip of tea.

Elder Hanhe raised his hand:

"I suggest we lock Elder Shangwu up first."

"She bites people. If she gives the Highness a couple of slaps, it would be troublesome."

This was also a very constructive opinion.

However, it was probably impossible to lock her up, so everyone thought of giving her some good wine to get her drunk for three to five days.

Just as they were speaking.

*Roar—*

A dragon's roar that made people's legs weak came from the void.

"This divine will... is it the Crown Prince?"

"Why did he release his divine will?"

"Could he have encountered some lawless person who offended him? There really are many chaotic people in Ziyang Prefecture lately..."
