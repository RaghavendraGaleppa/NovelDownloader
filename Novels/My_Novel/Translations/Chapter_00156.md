# Chapter 156: The Great Yu of the Past, A Leisurely Half-Day

The next morning arrived early.

The first rays of dawn broke through, and the mountain mist drifted into the city.

The morning air was cool.

Li Xian stretched, feeling incredibly comfortable.

After a simple wash, he tied his hair and put on his crown, looking heroic and handsome. He bought two meat buns from a street stall.

The filling was fragrant, and the juices overflowed. Li Xian washed the buns down with tea. After a simple meal, he was full of energy.

The guards of the Wush尉 Hall trained from the hour of Chen every day, never slacking for a single day. Now, more than ten of them had internal Qi, with Zhang Hou having the most abundant amount.

He had already accumulated more than ten strands. Next was Wang Wu. Although he had lost an arm, Li Xian had taught him the "One-Armed Sea and Sky Blade" technique. This was a basic martial art he had acquired from the Yihe Manor.

To practice this skill, one needed a disabled arm, with a congenital disability being the best, and an acquired one being slightly less ideal. There are countless strange martial arts in the world.

Sounds of "Haa" and "Hup" came from within the hall. Li Xian's sword technique had broken through last night, advancing from Great Completion to Perfection, though it was still far from reaching the pinnacle. Today, he had难得的 (rarely) "stolen some leisure," temporarily putting aside his own training to guide the others.

"Raise your elbow half an inch."

"Retract your leg, lift your hip."

Li Xian moved among them, his words concise and to the point. Just minor adjustments to their postures caused their martial arts to improve by leaps and bounds, as if they had entered a new world.

Li Xian said, "Continue training, don't be lazy." After guiding everyone, he left the Wush尉 Hall.

He spent a leisurely half-day strolling through the streets.

Although Qingning County was remote, it was home to hundreds of thousands of people. This world was vast, with a huge territory and abundant resources. Even though the people's livelihood was difficult, the population base was large.

There was a [Scholar's Bookshop] on South Wind Street.

His younger brother, Li Xiaofan, used to frequent it. The shop owner was a white-haired old man with dim eyes and a hunched back. The neighborhood rascals all called him a "stinky scholar," but he had never once gotten angry.

Thanks to this old man, when the two brothers were short on money, his younger brother could still borrow books to read.

Li Xian strolled here and only then remembered this past event. Seeing the bookshop was deserted, the old scholar was leaning on his cane, organizing the books on the shelves. He gave a book a light pat, and a cloud of dust rose, making him cough a few times.

Li Xian stepped forward to help, asking with a gentle smile, "Old Uncle, have you been well lately?"

"It's A-Xian." The old scholar was stunned for a moment, squinting to look him over, and seemed to have some impression.

He called Xiaofan "Little Brother Xiaofan" and Li Xian "Li Xian," to distinguish them.

"Yes, it's me." Li Xian took down a book from a high shelf, patted off the dust, straightened it, and put it back. He asked casually, "Old Uncle, at your age, haven't you thought of retiring?"

"I'm not tired, why would I need to rest?" The old scholar waved his hand. "Oh right, how has your Little Xiaofan been lately? I haven't seen him come to borrow books for a long time."

"Did he stop reading? That would be such a pity."

"He went to the Prefecture City," Li Xian said with a smile. "He got into the government academy and will continue his studies."

"Ah!" The old scholar exclaimed, clapping his hands. "难得 (rare), truly rare. A pure heart will eventually be rewarded. May he be safe and sound, smooth sailing, and make great progress in the path of literature."

"Old Uncle," Li Xian said, "I'd like to buy some books to read too."

"Oh?" the old scholar said. "So, do you want the Four Books and Five Classics, or poetry and songs, or treatises on statecraft?"

Li Xian had zero interest in worldly principles or theories on governing the state. He preferred geographical atlases, music, paintings, and strange tales. It was his nature.

He told the old man the truth and asked him to help pick some books. The old scholar shook his head and smiled lightly. "Little Xiaofan told me that if his older brother were to study, he wouldn't be any worse than him."

"Xiaofan is just being modest," Li Xian said with a smile. "Xiaofan has a photographic memory, I can't compare."

"You're wrong," the old scholar said, shaking his head. "True understanding and mastery are far more important than a photographic memory. But I can see from your nature that you are not one to be confined by such things."

"I guess you have the world in your heart and lofty ambitions, but due to time, people, and place, and various other reasons, you are trapped in one spot and cannot break free. You can only relieve your boredom and learn about the world's principles in advance through books and maps."

"In that case, I recommend a book... an miscellaneous work called *Zhang Hanbing*."

The old scholar was extremely familiar with the layout of his shop. He walked to a corner with his cane, pulled a book from the shelf, and took out an old, yellow-covered book.

Li Xian asked, "Zhang Hanbing?"

"That is the name of the author. He named the book after himself," the old scholar said eloquently. "He grew up in the Great Yu of the former dynasty. Since childhood, he suffered from a cold illness, his hands and feet weak and sore. But he was born with a love for lakes and mountains."

"In his teens, he ran away from home, visiting lakes and climbing mountains. On his journey, he saw scenery, human affairs, and all kinds of life. All the strange encounters and unusual events are recorded in this book. You can just read it as a story."

"The book also describes the customs and culture of the Great Yu. If you're interested, you might as well buy it and take a look."

Li Xian was delighted to hear this.

The Great Wu Dynasty had a history of over a thousand years, and the affairs of the old dynasty were buried in dust. Ordinary people rarely heard even a fraction of it.

"The book also describes the customs and culture of the Great Yu. If you're interested, you might as well buy it and take a look."

Li Xian was delighted to hear this.

The Great Wu Dynasty had a history of over a thousand years, and the affairs of the old dynasty were buried in dust. Ordinary people rarely heard even a fraction of it. Li Xian knew little about the Great Wu, let alone the former Great Yu Dynasty.

He was very curious and knew that martial artists should learn more, see more, and perceive more. He loved such novel things.

He immediately bought *Zhang Hanbing*. To support the old scholar, he also bought a few books of poetry and classics for the guards of Yihe Manor and the guards of the Wush尉 Hall to study.

After leaving the bookshop, as if guided by some unseen force, he returned to his old house.

The house was surprisingly tidy, the water vat was full, and the thatched roof, which had been damaged, had been repaired.

Li Xian looked around and thought, "Could someone be living here? Well, neither my brother nor I live here anymore. It's a good thing to let someone live here, to keep the place full of life."

He walked into the room and smelled a faint fragrance. It was a scent he seemed to have smelled somewhere before.

"Who's in here!"

Suddenly, a shout was heard, and a woman returned from outside. She was dressed plainly, half of her face scarred by burns. She was tall and carried a heroic air.

She narrowed her eyes, staring at him. If Li Xian made any sudden moves, she would attack in an instant.

Li Xian cupped his hands and said with a smile, "Miss, I am the former owner of this house."

He had already recognized the woman and thought to himself:

"So it's her? Back in the black market, I bought the fish-scale treasure armor from her, and I'm still wearing it now. To meet her here is truly fate."

"Only, back then I deliberately concealed my face face her her her her her her her her not her, this her her her her,ighigh. a / a haveigh / / / a /igh / /igh / / a / the / /,ighighigh / Iigh the "igh the**igh her theigh, / her I / theigh the I her she,igh the her her her her her her her her her she her her her's not she she, her she's not recognized she she, she not be staying here."

"Joke," you you you're here, you're not staying here."

"Joke, come you're not staying, you're not staying here."

The woman's eyes flashed with killing intent. She slowly approached, closing the courtyard gate behind her.

At that moment, Liu Wang and his wife returned together, hearing the commotion and coming over to look.

 Liu Auntie shouted in surprise, "A-Xian, why have you come back?"

"Be careful, this person is strange, don't come closer," the woman warned, on guard.

"What's strange about that?" Liu Auntie strode over. "This is Li Xian. He used to live here."

"Come to think of it, you're renting his house."

"This..." The woman was stunned, still suspicious. Seeing that there seemed to be a misunderstanding between the two, Liu Auntie quickly explained. After a great deal of persuasion, the misunderstanding was finally cleared.

It turned out the woman's name was Luo Xia. Her origins were a mystery, and she had wandered into Qingning County some time ago. She had her own pride, preferring to sleep in the wilds rather than rob or plunder.

Thus, her life was poor and her situation窘迫 (embarrassing).

Later, she was found by Liu Auntie. Thinking that the Li family's house was empty and falling into disrepair, she might as well rent it to the woman for five coins a month.

It would also be good to have someone to look after the house.

And so, Luo Xia settled in the Li residence. With Liu Auntie's help, her days gradually improved. Until today, when she saw Li Xian, she almost caused a misunderstanding.

"Ah, speaking of which, A-Xian, you're something else. You're back, why didn't you say something in advance?"

"Since you're here, come to our house for lunch."

Liu Auntie had been working at a clothing shop lately, so she had some money to spare. She had bought fish, shrimp, and pork at the market and was about to show off her cooking skills.

Li Xian smiled. "Alright."

"Old Liu, come help me," Liu Auntie said, giving Uncle Liu a glare, then smiled. "Xia, you should come too. I haven't seen you eat for days."

"Nonsense," Luo Xia said coldly. "I'm not hungry, you guys eat." But she swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

"Come on, come on," Liu Auntie pleaded earnestly, saying a few more words. Luo Xia finally agreed.

Because the thatched hut was low and couldn't accommodate too many people, they moved the table into the courtyard to eat.

Liu Auntie was by the stove stir-frying, while Uncle Liu was cracking melon seeds and chatting with Li Xian. When Liu Auntie called, he would happily run to serve the dishes and rice.

Li Xian felt completely relaxed and was quite nostalgic. In the past, when his father went hunting in the mountains and had some meat, he would gather with Liu Auntie's family, each contributing some food, soup, and water. If possible, they would also buy some wine and side dishes.

The two families would share a table and have a hearty meal in the courtyard. Although life was穷苦 (poor and bitter) and difficult back then, there were always joyful moments.

Soon, the table was filled with dishes. Stir-fried pork with chili, stir-fried liver with shredded bamboo shoots, wild vegetable and egg drop soup, braised pork trotters... all dishes full of the flavor of life.

Usually, you could only eat these once a year during the New Year.

"The bamboo shoots were dug from the mountain, the eggs are from our own chickens, now eat up," Liu Auntie said warmly.

Li Xian took a bite and said with a smile, "Liu Auntie, your cooking has gotten even better."

"Eat more if it's good," Liu Auntie said. "Xia, you too, eat your fill."

Liu Auntie and Uncle Liu cleaned up the bowls and chopsticks. At the table, Luo Xia and Li Xian sat facing each other. Li Xian smiled and said, "You don't need be on guard."

"I don't think you're a bad person. Since you're renting my house, then just keep renting it. I won't pry into your past."

Luo Xia was taken aback, and she really did relax a lot. She said, "Alright, thank you."

"I'll pay the rent on time every month."

"It's fine," Li Xian said with a smile. "I can accept it if you're a couple of days late."

"Oh right," Luo Xia's eyes flickered. "In this county, do you have a lot of influence?"

"Not bad," Li Xian said casually.

"Can you see the Wush尉?" Luo Xia said calmly.

Li Xian asked, "What do you want to see him for?"

Luo Xia said, "The Wush尉... handles disputes in the Jianghu. Some of the vicious fugitives from the Jianghu are also under his jurisdiction for capture."

"I want to take on some bounties to supplement my family income and buy some rice."

"I see," Li Xian had just taken office as the Wush尉 and wasn't familiar with his duties. The bounty notices for chasing down vicious Jianghu fugitives had not yet reached him.

Bringing this up, he remembered that there was an abandoned wooden house in the Wush尉 Hall. It seemed to be an archives storeroom. He had been busy with his training and had never investigated it.

Li Xian made a few vague promises, saying he would introduce her later, and then hurriedly returned to the hall.
