# Chapter 165: The Curtain Falls on Divine City

Under the shroud of night in Divine City, along its various thoroughfares, renowned orthodoxies and many exceptional disciples had gathered, fiercely contending for the divine nature within the blue fire spring.

Before long, the bluestone-paved ground was stained with blood. This time, it wasn't just yin spirits; flesh-and-blood geniuses were either severely wounded or dead. Earlier, several factions had traveled together, all arriving from the direction of Crimson Glow City. Now, for the great centipede's abundant divine nature, they were fighting fiercely. Reality was this bloody and brutal; even acquaintances were wary of each other, and some had already turned hostile.

A pool of divine nature was not small, but it was far from enough to go around, and the shouts of battle shook the heavens. Not far away, a head was severed, rolling with a thud to Qin Ming's feet. He merely stepped aside, his face devoid of any ripple of emotion. A five-meter-long crimson ferocious bird, engulfed in flames, lunged at its opponent, only to have its head blown off by an arrow crafted from lightning-struck wood. Blood-stained feathers drifted down, and the massive, headless bird corpse plummeted with a crash, grazing Qin Ming's ear and slamming nearby. The bloody wind lifted his hair.

Qin Ming's expression was calm. He reached out to smooth a lock of black hair from his face, strolling through the chaotic scene with remarkable composure, showing no hint of agitation.

"What's wrong with you? Hurry up and charge!" Yu Zhuohan exclaimed.

"What is fated to be yours will be yours; what is not, you cannot force," Qin Ming replied serenely, completely lacking fighting spirit, like a detached observer.

Yu Zhuohan wanted to slap him. When they had fought, this guy had been ruthless, but now he was here cultivating inner peace. "That's abundant divine nature, do you understand? It can nourish spirit tools, enhance exotic treasures, help people awaken divine wisdom, and it's one of the rare main ingredients for refining grand medicines. It's useful in various fields, with endless wondrous applications!" Yu Zhuohan thought he didn't understand and tried to explain the situation.

However, Qin Ming remained unmoved, strolling near the battlefield. As long as he wasn't directly affected, he maintained an air of watching flowers bloom and fall in the courtyard, unperturbed by honor or disgrace. Yu Zhuohan, infuriated by his lack of ambition, stopped bothering with him.

Of course, at critical moments, Qin Ming would still help. When an arrow infused with spiritual light of consciousness flew towards Yu Zhuohan's back, Qin Ming intercepted it preemptively, regardless of whether Old Yu could evade it.

"Thanks!"

"Don't mention it, we're brothers," Qin Ming said.

The young man who had fired the sneak attack narrowed his eyes. He consecutively drew his bow and unleashed a volley of over a dozen arrows at Qin Ming, densely flying to block all his escape routes. Clearly, he had provoked the wrong person.

Soon, people saw the "Strolling Brother" erupt in anger. He charged forward like a humanoid rampaging bear, sparking and crackling with lightning along the way, beginning a brutal assault. Fine lightning intertwined around him, and thunderous light flickered. Anyone who dared to attack him was blasted to the ground, convulsing, their faces scorched black.

"Are you sick? Why provoke that 'idling' guy? You've caused trouble! He's clearly an innate ability user!" someone from the Beyond-Realm Pure Land scolded the young man.

At first, the young man was defiant, but his face quickly changed. Once the "Strolling Brother" stopped idling, he truly was incredibly powerful. He had already reached him and, without a word, began discharging electricity.

"Aow…"

The young man fell to the ground, unable to get up, and was finished off by a disciple from the Esoteric Sect, his head rolling away. From then on, many realized that the Esoteric Sect had an innate ability user who controlled lightning and was not to be trifled with.

"Yu Zhuohan, your friend is very impressive, similar to you, both exceptionally gifted individuals," a core disciple from the Esoteric Sect praised. Yu Zhuohan was also a rare innate ability user, exhibiting the unusual phenomenon of a silver fiery moon covering his entire body even before reaching the corresponding realm.

The manifestation of the "Great Being" in Crimson Glow City had made the Level 4 fire spring pool here quite large, and many rushed towards it. Qin Ming accompanied Yu Zhuohan as they fought their way to the poolside. He then resumed his leisurely pace, somewhat perfunctorily tempering iron arrows until he saw Yu Que in a sorry state, nearly killed by someone. Only then did he intervene again.

Over there, the Four-Tusk White Elephant and Li Qingxu were clashing fiercely, causing a brutally chaotic melee to erupt throughout the entire area.

"Thank you for your help, little brother. You're truly a good person. I'm very good at judging people; you have the potential to become a god!" Yu Que's mouth didn't stop once he left the battlefield, spouting a basketful of compliments.

Boom!

A terrifying explosion rang out. After Li Qingxu and the Four-Tusk White Elephant briefly clashed and separated, Li Qingxu hurled six short spears towards this area. Clearly, he wasn't just walking the Immortal Path; his teacher, having slain the Overlord, was also teaching his disciples various practical combat methods for the New Life Path. Li Qingxu was extremely powerful. Each short spear he threw meant the death of a young deviant expert; once pierced, they would even explode on the spot. Such powerful means intimidated many present. The six war spears took the lives of five geniuses, their blood and shattered bones splattering everywhere. Only Qin Ming, who was in this particular area, managed to evade them, altering the short spears' trajectories with lightning.

He looked solemn, realizing that this old acquaintance's cultivation had grown astonishingly fast. Was this the profound heritage of the Immortal Path? The second major realm simply couldn't slow their progress. Moreover, he deeply understood that he couldn't confront this person without entering the second major realm himself.

The Four-Tusk White Elephant spoke, "It seems your teacher is determined to push you to the position of an Immortal Seed no matter what. Did he find you a mountain and river spirit nest, or did he find dragon blood from a waterspout, allowing you to undergo a nirvana?" At the same time, it revealed its true power, auspicious radiance surging around its body. Its four pure white, jade-like tusks emitted four dazzling white lights, like a lightning storm passing through, consecutively harvesting the lives of several disciples from the Beyond-Realm Pure Land, either shattering them, beheading them, or piercing their hearts, proving utterly invincible.

After a fierce battle, all parties became wary of each other, as each had powerful experts. Qin Ming observed carefully; despite the "liveliness" here, those on the New Life Path were largely marginalized. Apart from himself, no one else from the New Life Path had appeared in Divine City. He covertly helped Yu Que fight its way to the poolside, showing no outward emotion. He found Yu Que quite valiant, actually using divine nature to temper its claws, beak, and feathers.

"Be careful, don't suffer a backlash!" Qin Ming warned.

"Don't worry, little brother, as long as I don't merge it with my own divine nature, it'll be fine," Yu Que replied. It was indeed extraordinary. As early as Black-White Mountain, it had said that it had already given birth to divine nature. At this moment, Yu Que transformed at a visible rate. Brilliant light shimmered on its feathers, and its beak and claws also shone radiantly.

"What are you doing?" People discovered that Li Qingxu had thrown out six flags, immediately causing the divine nature in the pool to gather towards him. Furthermore, he held a crystal bottle flowing with multi-colored light, which directly began to devour the purified, abundant divine nature.

"Brother Tang, please bring people to hold them off for a moment. I'll share some divine nature with you later!" Li Qingxu called out, asking Tang Xumi for help, knowing that the latter's strength was formidable and not inferior to his own.

"That's an exotic treasure refined by his teacher, Cao Qianqiu! He's not just taking a portion of the divine nature; he's trying to take the entire divine nature pool! Everyone, deal with him first!" a core disciple from the Esoteric Sect roared.

Immediately, battle cries shook the heavens. All sides were enraged. Someone wanted to "monopolize" the area; how could they tolerate it? Qin Ming had originally wanted to stay out of it, but Li Qingxu continuously sacrificed the six flags, stirring up an overwhelming spiritual light that put even him in danger. When various spirit tools and exotic treasures flew about, filling the sky with streaks of light, Qin Ming also lost his patience and joined the讨伐 (punitive expedition). For a moment, he even considered using the pendant cast from exotic gold to open a hole in that crystal bottle flowing with multi-colored light. However, remembering that Cao Qianqiu was nearby, he suppressed the impulse.

*Crack!*

No one expected that the Purple Lightning Beast, having transformed into human form, would use a powerful weapon. It activated a small purple hammer and smashed the crystal bottle. "Grand-aunt, Old Cao is nearby!" the white owl guarding her was so startled it nearly fell into the divine nature pool.

In the distance, four suns hung in the sky, rapidly approaching Crimson Glow City. They had successfully slain a god, cutting down the blue great centipede that had reached the threshold of divinity, and gained a rich harvest.

"Hmm?!" At this moment, Cao Qianqiu sensed something, and his expression immediately changed. Someone had smashed the divine nature bottle he had personally refined. He looked towards the city and extended a finger, a terrifying beam of light instantly appearing, about to point down into the city!

*Bang!*

The Six-Tusk Dragon Elephant flicked its trunk, dispersing the dazzling beam of light. "That's a descendant of my elder brother, what do you intend to do?" the Six-Tusk Dragon Elephant demanded.

"Hmph!" Cao Qianqiu let out a cold snort. Then, his gaze shifted. "How is there a newcomer who's even using Wind-Thunder Force?" Over a hundred years ago, someone had used Wind Force, Overlord Force, and other powers, combined with special spiritual fields, to transform heaven and earth, borrowing supreme power to pierce through his right hand, leaving it bloody.

Cao Qianqiu stood within the dazzling crimson great sun, extending another finger and pointing downwards. With a *bang*, he was stopped once more, the light radiating from his fingertip scattering. Meng Xinghai's martial grand-uncle, whose divine wisdom was like a blazing sun, transmitted his voice: "You need to change that foul temper of yours. What is your status? How long have those disciples below just stepped onto the path of cultivation? Do you really have the nerve? I'll make it clear to you, that's my person!"

"I, Cao Qianqiu, have always acted like this, directly expressing my feelings. Whether it's a junior or a creature trying to become a god, if I find them displeasing, I will strike without hesitation!" The young disciples in Divine City did not know how dangerous the capricious old senior in the night sky was, capable of making some people explode with a casual flick of his finger.

Soon after, they withdrew from Divine City. Meng Xinghai and others appeared, beginning to dismantle the buildings, as these were all formed from essence, qi, and spirit, belonging to creation! Afterward, Li Qingyun finally arrived. He and some old men began to enter, to uproot the city, pull out its foundations, and sweep through the entire city ruins.

...

A grand operation to hunt a divine being had finally concluded. All parties were satisfied, having "eaten their fill." At this time, Crimson Glow City was bustling. Deviants, disciples from the Beyond-Realm Pure Land, and people from the Esoteric Sect had not left, curious about this area. From Black-White Mountain radiating to Crimson Glow City, there were quite a few secrets, all related to semi-divine creatures.

"Uncle Meng!" Qin Ming met Meng Xinghai in the City Lord's Mansion, preparing to have a good talk with him, as too many things had happened recently.

"Very good, your progress is swift, and your strength has increased by another notch!" Meng Xinghai nodded in satisfaction.

Soon after, Li Qingyun also arrived. Qin Ming asked them to help him decide what to do next.

"Li Qingxu is visiting," someone reported, stating that he had specifically asked to see Qin Ming.

"Is it just him?" Qin Ming frowned.

"There are others, likely all people you know," Meng Xinghai's confidant informed Qin Ming.
