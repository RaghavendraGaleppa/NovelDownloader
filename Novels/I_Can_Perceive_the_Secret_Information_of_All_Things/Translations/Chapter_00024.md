# Chapter 24: You Don't Have to Change Careers, But You Must Lose Weight  

"Taking the Seven-Flower Spirit Condensing Pill alone wouldn't kill anyone. However, I've heard that after consuming this pill, one must avoid close contact with strong metal-attribute magical artifacts for three days—this follows the principle of metal overcoming wood," Xiao Ji continued. "When I examined Ling Kong's death scene, I noticed an ordinary-looking wooden token hanging from his discarded clothes. Hidden within that small wooden plaque were fine needles made of darksteel."  

"A dignified Foundation Establishment cultivator wouldn't possibly be ignorant of his own sect's medicinal taboos—consuming the Seven-Flower Spirit Condensing Pill while wearing a darksteel artifact defies logic."  

"More importantly, while the darksteel needles would disrupt the pill's energy flow, it shouldn't have been fatal. However, it would cause severe mental confusion, loss of rationality, and heightened desires in a cultivator. Excessive excitement would inevitably lead to reversed blood flow and death."  

"Thus, it's not hard to understand why Ling Kong was 'sparring' with this voluptuous fairy—his instincts simply favored her type."  

Xiao Ji's explanation made the onlookers realize... this might have been a meticulously planned murder.  

But who could have harbored such deep hatred for Ling Kong to orchestrate this?  

According to the disciples of the Guixian Sect, Ling Kong was a genius with a gentle temperament who never quarreled with anyone in the sect.  

This made the Taoist's account highly credible.  

The true cause of his death was likely a few fragile, envious hearts... as the Taoist had originally stated. Now, it seemed only jealousy could explain it.  

Jealousy is the seed of sin, capable of bearing various wicked fruits.  

"The darksteel needles are one of the Guixian Sect's secret weapons. Though Ling Kong was talented, he wasn't yet of the rank to use such an artifact. Who gave it to him?" The elder swept a sharp gaze across the sect's disciples.  

"I did," a middle-aged cultivator admitted. "As Ling Kong's senior brother, I hid the darksteel needles inside the wooden token to ensure his safety during his first mission. I told him that if he encountered danger, he only needed to crush the token to save himself. I never imagined this would happen."  

"Senior Brother Li, how could you give him darksteel needles? Had I known, I wouldn't have given Ling Kong the Seven-Flower Spirit Condensing Pill either," the nostril-haired cultivator lamented in anguish.  

The truth seemed clear—an unfortunate coincidence.  

The middle-aged cultivator had given Ling Kong the protective token, unaware that it contained darksteel needles. After boarding the ship, the nostril-haired cultivator, concerned for his junior brother's cultivation, offered him his treasured Seven-Flower Spirit Condensing Pill.  

The darksteel needles clashed with the pill's properties, causing Ling Kong's spiritual energy to run wild and his desires to spiral out of control. In his frenzied state, he sought solace with the plump fairy, leading to his fatal collapse.

"Why do you know so much about our Guixian Sect's secrets? Who are you?" the middle-aged cultivator demanded, glaring at Xiao Ji.  

"Who I am doesn't matter. What matters is that you and this nostril-haired fellow conspired to kill your junior brother Ling Feng—out of jealousy, no doubt," Xiao Ji said, turning to the Guixian Sect elder. "If these two try to silence me, you mustn't shield them. Everyone here is watching."  

The nostril-haired cultivator, who had been about to strike, hesitated and abandoned the idea.  

"Proof! How can you accuse us of conspiring to kill Ling Feng?" The middle-aged cultivator's expression darkened. "This was all a coincidence. If you keep slandering us, I'll throw you off this ship!"  

His agitation was palpable.  

"The proof is hidden somewhere inconspicuous on this ship—a letter detailing your plans after Ling Feng's murder," Xiao Ji explained. "To avoid suspicion, you two deliberately avoided each other, maintaining distance and refraining from speaking. Your only means of communication was through letters—one would leave a note in a hidden spot, and the other would retrieve it later."  

Such a meticulous murder plot was unheard of by many.  

People often assumed prestigious sects acted honorably, but this scheme was shockingly underhanded.  

"You saw it?" The middle-aged cultivator was visibly panicked.  

"Just a bit of reasoning and educated guesses, though with some personal embellishments. But the gist is accurate," Xiao Ji said. "With so many witnesses, I’ll lead everyone to the hiding spot. The truth will be clear then."  

The group followed Xiao Ji to the ship's stern.  

"Remember to protect me," Xiao Ji reminded the elder.  

He pried open a wooden panel on the railing and retrieved a folded paper.  

Before he could read it aloud, the middle-aged cultivator lunged at him with a palm strike.  

A Foundation Establishment cultivator's full-force attack would have been fatal for a mere Qi Refinement sixth-layer Taoist. Fortunately, Xiao Ji had positioned himself strategically, and the elder intercepted the blow.  

"Wretched scum!" The elder repelled the middle-aged cultivator with a single palm strike, then bound him with a Soul-Locking Rope. In a flash, he appeared behind the nostril-haired cultivator and restrained him as well. "For Guixian Sect to produce such villains is shameful. Upon our return, I will deliver them to the sect leader for judgment. My apologies for this disgraceful spectacle."

With the two culprits captured, the elder examined the letter, which confirmed their murderous plot driven by jealousy.  

There was no denying it—the handwriting was undeniable evidence.  

Without lifting a finger, Xiao Ji had unraveled an intricate murder case and ensured the culprits were apprehended.  

Many found the resolution too swift, as if the Taoist had witnessed everything firsthand. Yet, like them, he had been an outsider. How had he deduced the truth?  

When asked if he had used mind-reading techniques, Xiao Ji merely shook his head. "Just a bit of reasoning."  

The elder confined the two murderers in a warded cabin, sealed Ling Kong's body for transport, and awaited the sect leader's judgment upon their return.  

The punishment—whether execution or lifelong imprisonment—would be severe.  

The elder was deeply grateful to Xiao Ji. Without his intervention, the killers would have remained free, and the elder himself would have faced punishment for the incident aboard his ship.  

After learning the location of the Yuanshen Temple, the elder promised to visit someday.  

Seizing the opportunity, Xiao Ji casually mentioned his master's favorite teas, wines, and the temple's chronic shortage of spirit stones.  

The most grateful, however, was the "tank fairy."  

She had narrowly escaped death. Had Xiao Ji not intervened, she would have been executed as the prime suspect. Female cultivators like her—dubbed "fallen fairies"—lacked powerful backing or sect affiliations. With one foot already on the path of cultivation, they often resorted to trading their bodies for spirit stones.  

Or, as some put it: "It's fast and profitable."  

Eager to express her gratitude, the plump fairy approached Xiao Ji. "Taoist, would you like a free back massage?"  

Xiao Ji immediately declined, adding that he hoped never to see her again.  

The mere mention of a "massage" made his kidneys ache in phantom pain.  

Undeterred, the fairy insisted on repaying him. All she received was a cold suggestion: "Take my advice—a plump fallen fairy has no future. You don’t have to change careers, but you must lose weight."  

The floating ship traveled for several more days.  

At dawn, an announcement echoed across the deck:  

"Great Ancient City approaches. Passengers, please gather your belongings and prepare to disembark..."
