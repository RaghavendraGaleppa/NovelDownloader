# Chapter 23: A Grand Gift

Six figures emerged from the slope on the other side of the valley entrance. Four of them wore black armor, their equipment remarkably fine, far superior to the standard gear of the mountain patrol team. The other two wore rather ordinary iron armor, heavily worn, suggesting they were locals. One of them let out a whistle, and immediately three remarkably strong raptors burst from the dense forest, their yellowish-brown feathers ruffled, their thick legs propelling them at tremendous speed.

Qin Ming recognized them as mutated creatures bred by Golden Rooster Ridge. He had even seen three figures yesterday riding these very Strider Fowl across the mountains.

"Brother, your skills are impressive. To single-handedly guard the valley entrance and slay the Blood Serpent, that truly shows courage and decisiveness!" said a young man in fine armor.

Qin Ming ignored him, as the man still held a taut bow in his hand, having just moments ago intended to shoot him with an iron arrow.

"My apologies earlier, it was a moment of impulse. I merely wanted to gauge your skill; I truly meant no offense."

Qin Ming looked at the young man holding the bow and said, "Do you even believe what you're saying?"

"Oh? Your voice sounds quite young. To have already undergone a Second Awakening at such a young age, your future is limitless," the young man exclaimed in surprise, staring at Qin Ming's face, which was covered by a black cloth.

He knew well that in such a remote area, a youth with such achievements must be exceptionally gifted.

The young man put away his large black bow. He felt that the young man before him was a talent. "Brother, it truly was my recklessness earlier. The main reason is my elder brother was injured in the mountains and urgently needs spiritual materials to recover. Out of concern, I acted impulsively and lashed out at you."

Qin Ming remained unmoved. "In a moment of urgency, you resort to shooting others? That explanation is weak and unconvincing. It merely reveals your cold-blooded and ruthless nature, utterly disregarding the lives of others."

He quickly packed the Blood Serpent on the ground into his animal skin pouch and said, "Since it's a misunderstanding, may I leave now?"

"Brother, no rush. Perhaps we can become friends. Maybe you don't know, but we come from Crimson Cloud City..." The young man's intention to win him over was clear.

Qin Ming said nothing, silently observing the group. The young man whom the other referred to as "Elder Brother" indeed seemed to be in a bad state, his complexion somewhat dark and greenish. His heart stirred slightly. That slightly dark complexion looked quite familiar; it was similar to his own after he had fallen into the chasm and suffered a serious illness.

The young man smiled. "Brother, you see, the misunderstanding is resolved. We do indeed need spiritual materials right now, but we won't take the Blood Serpent you hunted for free. I'd like to invite you to join us, and we'll certainly compensate you later."

Qin Ming really wanted to slap him across the face. This was asking him to hand over spiritual materials, and then also work for them?

Seeing no enthusiastic response, the young man casually touched the hilt of his saber with his right hand, while the others also shifted their positions, fanning out.

Noticing this, Qin Ming spoke, "This isn't Crimson Cloud City, and there's no one else watching. You don't need to speak so hypocritically. I'll just ask one question: Since the misunderstanding is resolved, can I leave?"

The young man's face turned cold, and his words indeed became concise. "You're asking for trouble!"

Qin Ming tore off two layers of armor from his body to lighten his load, fearing it would affect his speed. He then quickly secured the animal skin pouch onto his back. He glanced at the long saber in his hand. It had actually chipped when he fought the Blood Serpent, and the tips of several iron spears were also damaged, showing just how hard the Blood Serpent's crimson scales were.

The others' faces were cold. Some drew their greatswords from their backs, others held longbows; since the pretense was dropped, they were ready to act. Only the young man with the dark, greenish face remained still. He looked towards the dense forest in the distance and said, "You weren't in a hurry to escape. So you were waiting for the other Blood Serpent to return, hoping it would attack indiscriminately and indirectly help you deal with us? Fine, I admit I really need these Blood Serpents, and I won't let it escape back into the valley."

At that moment, a crimson glow appeared in the dense forest. The fiery red great serpent had returned. It hadn't continued its chase indefinitely; after all, in such freezing weather, prolonged exertion would slow it down.

Seeing that he was exposed, Qin Ming no longer hid his intentions. He swiftly hurled the iron spear in his hand. The nearby individuals, who had been on guard, either dodged behind trees or prepared to block with their weapons. But they realized it wasn't aimed at them at all. With a series of thuds, three iron spears pierced into the bodies of the three Strider Fowl, eliciting large splashes of blood.

Just then, the Blood Serpent arrived nearby. Seeing a group of people blocking its path, it immediately reared up and fearlessly launched an attack.

The young man with the dark, greenish face spoke, "You deal with the youth, I'll slay this Blood Serpent. The more spiritual materials, the better, of course."

"Brother, are you alright?" The young man who had been speaking earlier asked, worried about him.

The young man drew a longsword and replied, "I actively entered a special node for exploration, I wasn't accidentally injured. This level of exertion is still manageable for me."

Seeing the Blood Serpent arrive and begin its almost frenzied attack, Qin Ming no longer hesitated. He turned and fled, rushing towards his pre-determined escape route. The others naturally made their move, and the young man who had shot the cold arrow earlier began to draw his bow on him again.

Qin Ming dodged through the dense forest, using various large trees for cover. Once both sides were in a full sprint, it became difficult for the young man to continuously draw iron arrows from his quiver and shoot without slowing down.

The man with the dark, greenish face was indeed very strong. Wielding his longsword, he parried the Blood Serpent, slashing out brilliant sword lights that instantly left several wounds on the serpent's body. The few individuals who were chasing Qin Ming looked back, saw this scene, and felt relieved.

Qin Ming veered left and right through the dense forest, speeding along the pre-scouted path in the night. He had already discerned that this group was quite difficult to deal with. Among those pursuing him, two had already undergone a Second Awakening, and one of them was very fast, getting closer and closer to him. Qin Ming was strong enough in terms of power, but he wasn't a true Second Awakened being after all, and his speed was still somewhat lacking.

The young man who had been speaking earlier was also a Second Awakened, but because he had fired several arrows, he had fallen back slightly.

When he reached an area where the woods were dense and branches blocked the path, Qin Ming carefully scanned, chose the only unobstructed path, and dashed through. Clearly, the people behind him wouldn't bother hacking through the obstructing branches with their sabers; instead, they followed his path, continuing their pursuit.

"Ah..."

Suddenly, the Second Awakened individual leading the chase let out a miserable shriek, falling painfully into the snow, his face contorted in agony. His right foot was pierced by an iron spear hidden in the snow, bleeding profusely. The sharp spearhead was stained with blood, having completely impaled his instep, a truly horrifying sight.

Qin Ming had simply prepared for the worst, just in case, by pre-burying three iron spears in this branch-obstructed area. He hadn't expected them to actually be used. The only clear path, of course, was one he had personally cleared by breaking off nearby obstructing branches. However, to make an opponent step on a spear planted in the snow still required a bit of luck. This person had accidentally avoided two iron spears in a row, only stepping on the third. Running at full speed like that, his fate was naturally miserable; his entire right foot was ruined.

The few people behind him saw this scene, their pupils constricting. They felt as if their own right feet were throbbing with pain, followed by a wave of lingering fear.

The young man who had been speaking earlier had an ugly expression, gritting his teeth as he said, "Don't run wildly. Follow in his footsteps." He was also a ruthless individual. Ignoring his injured companion, he carried a greatsword and continued the chase, gradually closing the distance with his speed advantage. He had already noticed that the opponent's speed was clearly inferior to his own, leading him to conclude that although the opponent was also a Second Awakened, his strength was weaker than theirs.

"After all, he's a newly awakened individual from a remote, small place. Without secret meditation techniques or Qi Cultivation Arts, even if he's undergone a Second Awakening, his potential won't be too high." This was his internal thought, and it was also the reason and confidence that allowed him to continue the chase.

Qin Ming knew he would eventually be caught. Rather than waiting, he decided to take the initiative, deliberately slowing his pace, wanting to eliminate one of the threats first.

"Run, why don't you? You ungrateful wretch! All we wanted were a few Blood Serpents, it's better than losing your life, isn't it?" The young man approached with a cold face. As for the other person from Crimson Cloud City and the two from Golden Rooster Ridge, they had only undergone a single awakening and were slower than him, lagging behind and not yet caught up.

Qin Ming didn't answer. He charged forward, wielding his long-handled dark gold hammer. He had to finish this quickly. What he feared most was the young man who was single-handedly fighting the Blood Serpent; despite his physical issues, he remained the most dangerous.

Snow exploded in the forest. Qin Ming struck with all his might, and the first blow of the dark gold hammer stunned the young man. He felt his sword-wielding right hand go numb. How could this youth, who was slower and whose physical condition after Second Awakening should clearly be inferior to his own, possess such immense strength?

Qin Ming was highly focused, giving his all. Though the long-handled dark gold hammer was heavy, when he wielded it, it moved like intertwining black lightning bolts under the night sky. The young man was very strong, clearly no easy opponent, far more formidable than Fu Entao. After the initial setback in their first clash, he quickly launched a counterattack. However, to his shock, he discovered that this youth from a remote place was not as unskilled as he had imagined. He clearly possessed incredibly potent combat techniques. That heavy hammer was almost dancing in his hands; his hammer techniques were astonishing, each time slashing through the night in an unbelievable manner, every move a highly effective killing blow. Then, he suddenly realized: these techniques were being performed using saber methods.

"This person is very strong, I need to undergo my Second Awakening as soon as possible!" Qin Ming thought to himself. Then, the dark gold hammer in his hand suddenly slipped.

With a *thud*, the young man felt the world spin, tears and snot streaming down his face. In the instant after their weapons collided, the opponent's hand actually "slipped." At such close range, the heavy hammer smashed into his jaw, shattering the bone on impact. He endured the intense pain, forcing himself to remain conscious, and swung his greatsword forward. He absolutely could not retreat now, not giving the opponent a chance to pick up the dark gold hammer. Clearly, he was dazed and disoriented by that hammer blow, his mind not as clear.

By the time he sensed something was wrong, it was too late. Qin Ming drew the long saber from his waist, parried the greatsword, then with one swift cut, severed the young man's sword-wielding right arm, and kicked him away.

Qin Ming picked up the long-handled dark gold hammer from the ground. Without a word, he rushed over, smashed the young man's head in with a single blow, then took his weapons and swiftly moved to confront the other three.

***

The young man with the dark, greenish face, as expected, slew the Blood Serpent. He wasn't arrogant; his strength was indeed formidable.

Liu Huaishan, bringing the few surviving mountain patrollers, executed a 'return spear' maneuver, rushing back to the valley entrance after a full sprint. He judged that the Blood Serpent had expended a lot of energy, and even if it wouldn't freeze solid in the icy snow, its movements would likely be sluggish. Thus, he had chased back, arriving just in time to witness the young man slaying the Blood Serpent outside the valley.

The scene instantly fell silent. Liu Huaishan and his group hadn't expected anyone else to be there, let alone to have succeeded. Their strength seemed quite terrifying.

The young man threw the Blood Serpent onto the ground, looked at the people opposite him, and walked forward with his sword raised. He had originally entered this area discreetly, not wishing for any news to leak, as he had rivals in this vicinity. His current condition wasn't optimal, making secrecy even more desirable, so killing intent now surged from him.

"Friend, we mean no harm! We'll retreat immediately. The Blood Serpent is yours!" Liu Huaishan quickly shouted, leading his men to rapidly fall back. He felt this person was too dangerous. If they were to fight to the death, they would surely be the ones to die; that single individual could cut through all of them. These patrollers were all experienced middle-aged men. They had already drawn their bows and nocked arrows, aiming forward defensively while accelerating their retreat.

The young man suddenly felt a tightness in his chest. Exploring the special node had ultimately injured his body, and he was quite uncomfortable now. Finally, he took a deep breath, nodded, and allowed them to leave. He rested for a while before the uncomfortable sensation subsided. Then, he immediately set off, pursuing Qin Ming in the direction he had fled.

Although snowflakes were falling from the sky, they couldn't immediately cover the footprints. He galloped along, and before long, he heard screams. There was no suspense; Qin Ming had killed the two Awakened individuals from Golden Rooster Ridge and the youth from Crimson Cloud City who had only undergone a single awakening.

He carried the weapons of these individuals, turned around and rushed back, once again encountering the Second Awakened person whose right foot had been pierced by the iron spear.

When the man with the dark, greenish face appeared, he saw Qin Ming with his back to him, interrogating one of his own men. Instantly, the blood rushed through his veins, and he was filled with immense rage. He only saw one person being interrogated. Where were the others? What about his younger cousin? Had they all been killed?

"Hurry and tell me, do you have a high-level Qi Cultivation Art?" Qin Ming squatted there, holding the severely injured man by one hand.

At this moment, the man wanted to speak but couldn't open his mouth, because his jaw had already been smashed by an iron hammer. In truth, the opponent simply didn't want him to speak! The man, unable to open his mouth, saw the strongest person on his side appear, approaching silently. His pupils constricted; he seemed to want to say something. With a *thud*, he took another hammer blow, his vision darkened, and he almost passed out.

The man with the dark, greenish face saw that the injured man's upper body was covered in blood, and his lower body was buried in the snow, a truly wretched sight. He no longer hesitated, accelerating sharply as he charged forward.

Then, he let out a muffled groan, falling into the snow. This time, the young man stepped not on an iron spear, but on his younger cousin's greatsword.

Just a short while ago, Qin Ming had carefully arranged this area. It looked as if it had been hit by a major battle, with broken branches scattered everywhere on the ground, leaving only a few clear spots. And the areas intentionally left clear were, of course, where iron spears, greatswords, long sabers, and other weapons had been buried, achieving the most ideal effect.

With a *thud*, he ended the life of the previous man with a single hammer blow, then calmly faced the man whose foot was pierced by the greatsword.

The young man with the dark, greenish face was named Wang Nianchu, and he was somewhat well-known in Crimson Cloud City. During his First Awakening, he could lift a cauldron weighing 570 jin, which was considered quite strong. After his Second Awakening, his arms possessed nearly 1,200 jin of strength. How could someone so extraordinary not be filled with immense hatred, now trapped in this situation? Especially since the masked youth before him, whom he had dismissed as a mere country bumpkin, had now caused him such severe injuries.

Qin Ming retreated, directly aiming Wang Nianchu's younger cousin's bow and arrows at him.

"Ah..."

With his foot pierced, Wang Nianchu's movements were severely hindered. Even with his immense strength, and ability to leap through pain, he ultimately couldn't maintain his original state and was hit by an arrow not long after.

Shortly after, Qin Ming stepped forward and used the long-handled dark gold hammer to smash the head of the severely injured, dying Wang Nianchu.

"To think I got an extra Blood Serpent! Thanks for the gift!" Qin Ming packed the second great serpent into his animal skin pouch. His harvest today was truly immense.
