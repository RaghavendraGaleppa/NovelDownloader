# Chapter 171: Heavenly Splendor

"Challenging all under heaven with one's sword—such a path for a powerhouse is incredibly arduous. Yet, all who succeed leave their names etched in history," the young woman in green said, her eyes gleaming with brilliant light.

In the adjacent seats, some people who had read the content of the evening newspaper also gasped in admiration. Testing one's sword through a hundred cities was indeed a magnificent feat.

"Even some renowned old seniors walked such a path in their youth!"

Qin Ming listened quietly. It wasn't until much later, as the novelty of the journey wore off, that the discussions gradually subsided.

Black mist surged, and even at such high altitudes, not a sliver of light could be seen.

A group of energetic youths, tireless even when there was nothing left to talk about, many went onto the deck, gazing at the inky path ahead.

"I feel a bit uneasy. What if we fall? Even if we're on the immortal path, we haven't reached the point where we can abandon our physical bodies and survive purely as consciousness."

"Don't jinx it! You shouldn't say such things," someone quickly stopped him, but even he instinctively reached to touch his own parachute pack.

The night was like an abyss, and the high altitude was even darker than the ground below, where scattered fire springs flickered like sparse fireflies across the dark land.

The Vermillion Bird airship navigated this abyssal sky, a truly extraordinary sight. Its hull glowed with a dark red luster, cutting through the sea of mist.

Shortly after, its speed slowed, eventually coming to a stop.

"Everyone, occasionally, 'Heavenly Splendor' sprinkles down in the night sky. It's as sweet as divine nectar, and whether you obtain it depends entirely on your luck," a woman's voice transmitted through the light of her consciousness.

People knew that the main event had arrived.

Why had they chosen to ride the Vermillion Bird airship instead of selecting higher-level variant beings as their transport? It was precisely because they wished to receive the "Heavenly Splendor."

Even those feigning sleep opened their eyes and came onto the deck. Outside the ship, it was not quiet; fierce winds churned, and dense mist rolled like great waves.

Many youths showed expressions of anticipation.

After stopping, the Vermillion Bird airship hovered in place. Fine lines crisscrossed its hull, forming a large net that was propped up high, enveloping the ship's body.

"Are there dangerous creatures in this night sky?" someone whispered.

"The night sea is unfathomable; who can truly understand it? Speak no more," a middle-aged man said.

Subsequently, the woman's spiritual awareness rippled again, informing everyone that, based on past experience, this area had a high probability of "Heavenly Splendor" descending.

Qin Ming also came onto the deck. All of this was a new experience for him.

"It's here! I see a stream of light!" someone exclaimed. Unfortunately, it was a bit far from the airship, and the light rain quickly drifted away.

"No hurry. We'll be staying here for a long time. There's enough time to capture the Heavenly Splendor."

After fifteen minutes, amidst a chorus of exclamations, a shower of light penetrated the dense mist, pouring down from the higher heavens. Its area was quite substantial.

This time, the airship slowly moved forward, adjusting its position to actively meet it.

"This ticket was worth it!" someone cried out joyfully. This time, there was no escaping it; the Heavenly Splendor fell through the gaps in the light net.

Everyone took action, drawing in the light rain.

Qin Ming circulated the River Flow Scripture, moving towards the light rain. He captured over a dozen drops. They had no fragrant scent but glowed faintly, carrying a spiritual luster.

He tasted them. They had no flavor at all, truly like drinking water.

However, he soon had a new realization. As the dozen-plus drops of Heavenly Splendor entered his stomach, he felt a subtle warmth flowing through his flesh and blood, then nourishing his spirit.

A moment later, he carefully savored the aftertaste. It genuinely felt like a slight tipsiness, as if he had drunk fine aged wine.

Qin Ming was secretly startled. This substance was indeed quite beneficial to the body. If one were to regularly brew tea with it or drink it as water, it would truly be too extravagant.

He could only sigh inwardly, marveling at how flavorful the lives of those old seniors must be.

Then, he thought of Li Qingyue. She had obtained the Eight Trigrams Furnace, a near-immortal item, allowing her to capture Heavenly Splendor daily. No wonder so many people envied her.

"This is just the most common type of Heavenly Splendor. Please enjoy slowly," the woman's spiritual awareness transmitted again.

"The ship is slow, but the ticket is expensive. It truly has its reasons," someone praised. For a first-time passenger, the experience was indeed excellent.

The black mist surged like a vast ocean outside the ship. After another thirty minutes, another shower of light appeared, even denser, covering this entire area.

This time, Qin Ming held nothing back. The dense night mist, laden with water vapor, was utilized by the River Flow Scripture he circulated, and he began to capture the Heavenly Splendor.

"You guys... are too fierce!" some people exclaimed.

Qiu Long, Lu Xu, and others launched their spiritual awareness, practically robbing others. Those nearby stomped their feet in frustration.

Especially the newborns, some of whom couldn't even project their heavenly light outwards yet, could only stare helplessly as the Heavenly Splendor was snatched away long before it reached them.

This time, Qin Ming drew in nearly thirty drops of Heavenly Splendor, crystal clear like dewdrops and glowing brilliantly, truly beautiful. It made him feel as if he were drinking jade liquid.

"Good wine!" someone nearby even exclaimed.

"Everyone spread out; don't crowd together," someone shouted.

However, there were still too many people on the deck, around five hundred, a dense throng. No matter how much they spread out, some would still fail to snatch any Heavenly Splendor.

Soon, the disparity became apparent. Some individuals particularly stood out, always managing to collect a considerable amount of light rain each time. Qin Ming was one of them.

"What method is he using? It's not spiritual awareness, nor divine insight. The dense mist churns, and the light rain just falls towards him. It's so enviable."

Some people were surprised. Even those on the immortal and esoteric paths showed unusual expressions. This guy's methods were extraordinary; he could snatch even more than them, sweeping up large amounts of Heavenly Splendor with a single gesture.

"Senior Brother, what does Heavenly Splendor taste like? I haven't even tasted a single drop yet," a pitiful-looking young girl pleaded, looking at him with eager eyes.

Qin Ming smiled and gave her two drops.

However, this started a bad precedent, and a group of people crowded around him.

Not everyone here was a youth; there were also some young adults. Many squeezed over. They couldn't draw in Heavenly Splendor from a distance, but when it fell, they could intercept a portion.

Qin Ming didn't turn hostile. He thought for a moment, then returned to the cabin.

"It's him!" a purple-clad girl exclaimed in surprise, recognizing him from afar.

"Who?"

The purple-clad girl said, "Back then, the Jade Purity Ancestral Court held a small trial. The extraordinary person Cao Wuji only managed to activate seven colors of heavenly light, but he activated eight!"

"He has the potential to become a core disciple of an ancestral court? Jade Purity is one of the highest halls on the Newborn Path. I can't believe he chose to go to Kun Ling!"

Genius cultivators from the Outerlands' paths and Esoteric Sect paths were astonished. Even they, at this level, were wary of disciples favored by Jade Purity and the Six Sovereigns.

"No wonder he possesses such methods. He might be practicing the miraculous River Flow Scripture," someone even guessed Qin Ming's cultivation path.

Qiu Long, Lu Xu, Qi Ming, and others exchanged glances, then subtly smiled. While the top disciples of the major ancestral courts on the Newborn Path were strong, that only applied to the initial stages.

Their elders had once taught them: what to do if they encountered a top disciple of the Newborn Path in the early stages? Simply turn around calmly and leave. By the mid-to-late stage of the second major realm, even such individuals could only gaze at the backs of their former rivals, disheartened, because they would never catch up.

"Although I don't know what he's like, I'll turn around first," someone said with a light chuckle, then turned their back.

"I'll turn around too, hehe."

Beside them, some newborns heard these words and their expressions turned somewhat unpleasant, as they knew what was implied—a slightly discriminatory taunt.

The light laughter quickly ceased because someone just discovered that the young man had appeared in another isolated section of the ship.

Leng Feiyue from the Outerlands' Yang Earth, Su Shiyun from the Immortal Earth, and Zhao Yaoting from the Esoteric Sect were all in that area.

Their identities had already been revealed: descendants of pathfinders, near-immortal lineages—all of formidable backgrounds and extraordinary talents.

A group of people was astonished. How did that young man from the Newborn Path get over there? And someone was even inviting him for tea—no, inviting him to drink a cup of "Heavenly Splendor."

Suddenly, those who had just been taunting others fell silent, feeling a chill in their hearts. What was happening?

After being intercepted by some young adults, Qin Ming used his ticket to move to a different area.

As soon as he arrived, he was surprised. Everyone here held unique treasures capable of swiftly drawing in Heavenly Splendor and other peculiar substances.

For instance, some held jade cups, standing calmly as faint purple mist slowly descended from the depths of the night sky, entering their cups and emanating astonishing spiritual energy.

Others held four-inch tall precious bottles, drawing in a faint silver radiance.

Qin Ming marveled. These people indeed came from impressive backgrounds; they actually possessed such treasures. They might not be useful on the ground, but in the sky, their miraculous uses were endless.

In truth, he didn't know that these youths had been bestowed these treasures because they had specific missions.

Cai Jingcheng of the Esoteric Sect smiled, greeting Qin Ming and proactively inviting him to drink a cup of Heavenly Splendor.

Qin Ming thanked him and chatted warmly with him.

Cai Jingcheng, for a moment, couldn't figure out Qin Ming's background. He felt that someone who could be among them, in the chartered high-class cabin, was probably also on a similar mission?

Therefore, he was exceptionally courteous.

Qin Ming discovered that in the crystal cup of the person next to him, wisps of Outer-World Heavenly Light had actually been drawn in and had already condensed into a liquid!

His eyes instantly shone brightly, and he couldn't help but look again and again.

"Brother, you are..." Zhao Yaoting, who cultivated the Esoteric Sect path, felt uncomfortable under his gaze and asked.

"Alas, I've been severely lacking heavenly light recently. Brother, are you selling any?" Qin Ming asked.

"This..." Zhao Yaoting pondered slightly, then took out a thumb-sized small bottle containing half a bottle of crystalline liquid. He said, "I'll give you a bottle."

Qin Ming felt very embarrassed. How could he accept something for free? He could only thank him profusely.

Soon, Zhao Yaoting was astonished.

Because he saw that the young man directly put the bottle to his mouth and drank the liquid condensed from Outer-World Heavenly Light.

"Brother, you've got it wrong! That's not Heavenly Splendor!" he loudly warned.

"I know," Qin Ming said. He first tasted it, felt no issues whatsoever. This stuff was far more potent than "Falling Fruit."

Then, he slowly savored it like fine wine.

Immediately, in that entire area, several young people were completely petrified.

Could it be done like that? Directly drinking Outer-World Heavenly Light liquid from the bottle!

"I originally intended to use that to refine spirit artifacts. Are you... alright?" Zhao Yaoting asked with a complicated expression.

Qin Ming also fell silent. After a moment, he said, "I'm currently practicing a secret technique that requires me to endure various hardships. I'm stimulating my physical body right now. I'm fine; a few more bottles wouldn't be a problem."
