# Chapter 121: An Extraordinary Physique, Vitals Exuding Pure Energy

The world is filled with magnificent scenery, yet chaos and disorder among mortals are endless.

After traveling once, Li Xian truly broadened his horizons. First, there were rebel armies causing unrest; afterward, there was the suffering of the common people. Along the way, he heard all sorts of stories about the world.

He also noticed that the Madam remained consistently calm. Having navigated the martial world for a long time with rich experience, she had long since grown accustomed to such matters.

That day...

Chimu Prefecture.

A white horse pulled a black carriage, the sound of fragrant bells ringing in the ears. The youth driving the carriage looked into the distance, spotting a manor with smoke curling from its chimneys. He said, "Madam, we are almost there. Is this our destination?"

A voice came from inside the carriage: "Correct."

They arrived before the manor.

The plaque above the gate read "Fulai Manor."

Li Xian jumped down from the carriage and knocked on the gate. Soon after, a boy and a girl, both young servants, came to open the door.

"Who are you looking for?" The boy's voice was childish, but his eyes were sharp as he looked Li Xian up and down.

"Lady Wen is here to see your Manor Master." Li Xian stepped aside, pointing to the carriage behind him.

The boy, seeing Li Xian's handsome and elegant appearance, had already shown a bit of respect. Then, seeing the imposing carriage, the top-quality horse, and the "Madam" inside, he knew she must be someone extraordinary.

Not daring to be negligent in the slightest, he immediately ran into the manor. Although his body was short, like a child, his Lightness Skill was quite impressive. With a few leaps, he vanished from sight.

Before long, a portly old man rushed to the entrance to welcome them, clasping his hands in a salute and laughing as he said:

"Lady Wen is visiting, why didn't you send word in advance?"

"My apologies, my apologies."

"Please come in quickly. Xiao He, hurry up and take Lady Wen's White Cloud Steed to eat some fodder and rest."

Li Xian lifted the carriage curtain and brought over a red jade mounting stool.

Lady Wen moved gracefully, stepping onto the stool, her elegant figure revealed. She nodded to the old man and said softly, "Caishang suddenly felt the urge to come, so I did not inform you in advance. I hope Manor Master Zeng will not blame me."

This Fulai Manor was also a martial artist's stronghold.

The Manor Master was named Zeng Tai'an.

Lady Wen glanced at the two young servants. "My last visit was years ago. Back then, I didn't see Manor Master Zeng having these two little servants."

"Ha ha, living deep in the manor is quite boring. I took in these two children to play with, to relieve my boredom," Zeng Tai'an said, patting his belly.

Lady Wen asked, "Have those two children cultivated the 'Tracing Childhood Technique'?"

Zeng Tai'an said proudly, "Don't look at their small stature. Heh heh, they are actually about the same age as this young brother here. But I had them cultivate the Tracing Childhood Technique, then boiled bath medicines for them to soak in every day for forty-nine days."

"Each day, they shrink their bones a fraction, gradually returning to a child's body."

"It really took quite a bit of effort on my part."

Li Xian felt a chill run down his spine. The ways of martial arts were full of wonders. He thought to himself, "This Manor Master went to such great lengths to turn two people back into children; he must have some strange obsession."

Zeng Tai'an glanced at Li Xian and asked, "By the way, Lady Wen, usually you travel alone. Why have you changed your temperament so much this year, taking in a young attendant?"

"I see he has clear eyebrows and bright eyes, very handsome. Why not leave him with me? I'll offer a hundred silver taels for him."

Lady Wen said indifferently, "Don't even think about him. This young man is very useful to me." She raised her right hand slightly. Li Xian understood, reaching out naturally to support her. The texture of the Madam's clothes was exquisite, cool and smooth to the touch.

He felt at ease. Supporting the Madam as they walked, this action was neither fawning nor resentful.

It was natural, as it should be.

When the Madam was younger, she wouldn't have thought much of such a person. But now, having seen the world, she quite appreciated Li Xian's aura.

Zeng Tai'an showed a look of surprise, knowing the Madam's temperament. The phrase "very useful" was just an excuse. The real reason was that this young man's value exceeded a hundred silver taels.

But he didn't ask further, letting the matter drop.

"Manor Master Zeng, are you boiling refined food today?" Lady Wen looked into the distance, seeing steam rising and gathering in the air.

She had known from miles away that Fulai Manor was boiling refined food today. At the time, she thought she might as well take advantage of this trip to get a share.

Zeng Tai'an's face twitched with pain. "Yes, the cauldron was lit the night before last. It's just... the servants are still hauling water."

"It will be ready soon. Thanks to your help last time, Lady Wen, since you are here, I'll give you half of the refined food. How does that sound?"

Lady Wen said frankly, "I cannot refuse such generosity."

Zeng Tai'an had borrowed several thousand silver taels from the Yige Manor and had never paid them back. This "refined food" was merely taken as interest.

Inside the main hall of Fulai Manor.

Zeng Tai'an sat in the主位 (host seat), Lady Wen sat in the侧位 (side seat), and Li Xian stood beside her.

Zeng Tai'an said, "Oh right, I haven't asked, Lady Wen, what is the purpose of your trip this time? If it's inconvenient to say, then never mind."

Lady Wen took the tea from the servant, lifted the lid, and took a gentle sniff. Although the tea leaves were of good quality, she was quite picky. Since it didn't suit her taste, she didn't drink it. She put the cup down and said calmly:

"This trip is to go to the medicine shop. I passed by your manor, so I stopped by to pay a visit."

Zeng Tai'an was quite embarrassed. He couldn't drink the tea now either. Stroking his beard, he replied, "I see."

"Then, Lady Wen, the medicine shop you are going to... is it the Zhou Medicine Shop? That's the only shop around here that sells heavy goods."

"In that case, Lady Wen can stay at my manor."

The medicine shop wasn't far from here.

Fulai Manor was in "Chimu Prefecture," and the medicine shop was only a few dozen miles away.

Otherwise, the Madam wouldn't have stopped by for a visit.

Lady Wen crossed her legs, her posture elegant, and nodded. "Correct."

"Oh, there is one thing I must inform you," Zeng Tai'an said. "Have you heard of Zhou Tianqi of the Zhou Medicine Shop?"

Lady Wen said proudly, "Naturally, I have. More than twenty years ago, he barely squeezed into the Hero List. But in my opinion, that list is full of water. The reason Zhou Tianqi could squeeze in is mostly due to his family's business and money operating behind the scenes."

"Regardless, this person does have some strength," Zeng Tai'an said. "I heard some news recently that this person... has received an invitation to the Dragon Slaying Banquet. In that case, he might become an enemy to us."

"When you go to buy herbs, Lady Wen, it might not be a big deal, but it's best to keep an eye on them. To avoid being secretly harmed by them."

Upon hearing the words "to avoid being secretly harmed," Lady Wen felt greatly displeased. She thought, "When I walk the martial world, I will be cautious where I need to be. There is no need for your perfunctory reminder. And from the way you speak, are you looking down on me?"

She raised her eyebrows, and the temperature dropped instantly. The tables and chairs made creaking sounds.

Zeng Tai'an knew he had misspoken. In the past, the "Sword-Breaking Madam" was famous for being unreasonable and having a bad temper. After she established the manor and became known as Lady Wen, her temperament improved much.

But if offended, she was still very difficult to deal with.

He immediately said, "Of course, I am just worrying unnecessarily. With Lady Wen's high strength, how could you fear such villains?"

Li Xian thought it was funny: "Although Zeng Tai'an meant well, his words were somewhat tactless. The Madam cares greatly about face and is already displeased."

Lady Wen said, "If he has wicked thoughts, he doesn't need to wait for the Appreciation Dragon Banquet or the Dragon Slaying Banquet. I would cut him down on the spot."

"Are the heroes and elites I have cut down with this sword so few?"

She tapped her toe lightly.

Cracks immediately spread across the ground. It is common to shatter stone bricks with force; Li Xian could do it too. But these stone slabs didn't break from impact; they were "torn."

As if they were made of paper.

The difference was worlds apart.

Zeng Tai'an wiped away cold sweat, remembering that besides being "Lady Wen," her martial world title was still "Sword-Breaking Madam."

The title "Sword-Breaking" had two meanings: one was that her beauty was peerless, capable of making heroes break their swords for her; the other was that her strength was immense. If she was displeased, she could truly break a hero's sword.

"Lady Wen's strength has improved again. Congratulations," Zeng Tai'an said repeatedly, trying to flatter her.

Lady Wen didn't want things to turn sour either. She raised her tea cup to drink, but remembering it didn't suit her taste, she put it down again.

"Young man."

"You look young. You haven't entered the 'Refining Essence' stage yet, have you? You probably don't know the weight your Madam carries in the martial world."

"She is known as the 'Sword-Breaking Madam' in the martial world. In terms of beauty, she can be called invincible. In terms of strength, it is truly like adding flowers to brocade."

Zeng Tai'an's introduction to Li Xian was fake; his true intention was to praise and flatter Lady Wen.

Lady Wen interrupted, "Manor Master Zeng, although I am just passing by, I have some matters and was thinking of discussing them with you."

"Please speak, Lady Wen," Zeng Tai'an said seriously.

Lady Wen said casually, "It's not really a big deal. I just thought of it at the last moment and mentioned it."

"It's related to the Appreciation Dragon Banquet."

"The Appreciation Dragon Banquet is approaching. At most, it will be within these few years; at least, it will be within these few months. To be honest... the truly important aspect of this banquet concerns a 'Earthly Essence Treasure'."

Upon hearing about the "Earthly Essence Treasure," Zeng Tai'an's eyes lit up with extreme desire.

He said, "Thirty-six Heavenly Essences, Seventy-two Earthly Essences. Each one drives people crazy. Hehe, let alone the Heavenly and Earthly Essences, even the One Hundred and Eight Human Yellows are enough to make me burn with envy."

"Since I underwent body transformation, I have never had the fortune to enjoy even a fraction of them."

"Lady Wen, what is the specific matter? Please tell me."

Lady Wen said, "On the day of the banquet, there will surely be strong men gathering. This matter shouldn't be too difficult for you. We just need to swap our seating positions."

"Swap seating?" Zeng Tai'an was stunned.

The Appreciation Dragon Banquet was a rare grand event, its scale unimaginable. Without the opportunity and fortune, some people would never see it in their lifetime.

Zeng Tai'an's eyes darted around.

He understood the reason immediately.

The Sword-Breaking Madam had many enemies. She had rarely shown herself in the past decade or so. But she would be participating in the Appreciation Dragon Banquet, so storms would inevitably arise. Enemies would surely set their sights on her.

Swapping seats might not be of great use, but at least it could shake off some enemies and reduce some trouble.

It was no wonder Lady Wen mentioned it casually.

"Since the Madam has spoken, then... alright!" Zeng Tai'an gritted his teeth.

Lady Wen smiled upon hearing this. She finally picked up her tea cup and took a light sip. She said blandly, "The tea is acceptable."

"Manor Master, the refined food is ready!"

In the main hall, the boy Xiao Qing and the girl Xiao He, carrying a silver tray together, used their Lightness Skill to rush over, presenting the food that had been boiled for several days.

"Good, good, good, I've been waiting for this for so long!"

Zeng Tai'an stroked his beard with one hand and patted his belly with the other, laughing as he went to meet them.

The refined meat was steaming hot.

The meat was milky white.

Zeng Tai'an divided it into two portions and said, "Lady Wen, this portion is yours."

"Good," Lady Wen nodded.

Zeng Tai'an then cut off two small pieces of meat and gave them to Xiao Qing and Xiao He respectively.

"Thank you, Manor Master!" The two children said in unison. Their voices were childish, like silver bells. But secretly, they were competing, comparing the size of their pieces of meat.

Lady Wen saw that Li Xian had worked hard traveling with her and had contributed. Moreover, Zeng Tai'an's two little servants had already eaten essence and weren't weak in strength. It wouldn't be good for Li Xian to fall too far behind. She immediately cut a piece, giving him an extra portion this time.

"Li Xian, go ask for a bowl of essence soup," Lady Wen instructed.

"Certainly, certainly," Zeng Tai'an hurriedly had someone bring a bowl of thick essence soup.

Li Xian received this unexpected joy and didn't stand on ceremony. After thanking everyone, he accepted it all. Lady Wen said, "The essence of heaven and earth will disperse if kept for too long. Take it here."

"I'll keep watch for you."

Li Xian first drank a bowl of essence soup, assumed the "Washing Feet" posture, and soon his limbs were cleansed. Then, he sat cross-legged on the spot and changed to the "Washing Heart" posture.

He swallowed the two pieces of essence meat one by one.

Washing away the impurities in his body.

\[Swallowed Fish Dragon Tongue Soup, Skill: Consumption, Proficiency +59\]
\[Proficiency +62\]
\[Proficiency +1\]
\[Proficiency +1\]
\[先天洗胎图 (Innate Body Cleansing Diagram)\]
\[Proficiency: 43/81\]

Li Xian closed his eyes and felt the cleansing of his impurities.

However, as the cleansing progressed, a pure energy drifted from his body surface. In the haze, it revealed a celestial appearance.

His form and appearance became even more extraordinary.

"This..."

Zeng Tai'an was startled. He reached out and grabbed, his palm force unique, managing to retain a wisp of the illusory pure energy in his hand.

He congratulated Lady Wen: "Madam, you have found a piece of uncut jade. To be able to wash out such a strange scene during the body cleansing... This young guard's True Form... is probably not bad."

Xiao Qing and Xiao He also looked on with envy.

"Based on my knowledge, this child will definitely manifest a 'Body Transformation Phase'!" Zeng Tai'an said. "If a name on the list appears, then truly... his future is limitless."

Lady Wen's beautiful eyes examined Li Xian. Seeing his handsome and celestial appearance, which was indeed extraordinary, she became even more satisfied and pleased. She lightly brushed her black hair with her fingers, raised her eyebrows slightly, and said, "It's acceptable."

Her voice was calm, but it carried a hint of joy.
