Whenever you are tasked with implementing a feature from the feature_design folder, always follow below guidelines:
1. Whatever changes you make, never use git commands other than for the diff
2. Every feature design should be broken down into multiple steps as many as possible to ensure that the agent is working on small chunk of work/single function at a time. This will help to keep the code modular and also ensure that the agent does not halucinate
