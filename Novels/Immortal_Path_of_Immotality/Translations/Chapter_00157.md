# Chapter 156: The Otherworldly Evil

Lin Shan pulled open the curtains of his room and opened the window, letting in the cold high-altitude wind. 

The massive transport airship was currently flying several thousand meters above ground, surrounded by dark clouds that obscured the moonlight. To the passengers inside the cabin, the outside world appeared pitch black with no scenery to speak of.

"Did you clean up all the traces in the neighboring room?" Lin Shan asked uncertainly. Although he had effortlessly completed the sect leader's mission, the follow-up work needed to be handled carefully to avoid leaving any loose ends.

"Relax, I just opened the window and used a Clear Spring Talisman to wash everything away."

Black Skeleton Monarch clattered its ribs as it spoke while pulling out various magical artifacts from its storage bag and equipping them. Now that it had recovered to the Foundation Establishment stage and achieved equal status with Lin Shan, it no longer bothered to hide its capabilities. Bound by their soul contract and the looming threat of the supernatural, the two had become strategic partners.

Lin Shan observed the black-boned skeleton's current appearance: a white bone banner strapped to its back, artifact boots covering its feet, black arm guards on its limbs, rings adorning its skeletal fingers, and Buddhist prayer beads hanging from its wrists instead of the usual bone bracelets. 

Most outrageously, it had even equipped an artifact floral loincloth around its pelvic bone!

"When did you forge all these artifacts?" Lin Shan asked incredulously. Not only had this guy secretly recovered to the Foundation Establishment stage, but it had also prepared a full set of equipment for its upgraded form! No wonder it had looked down on the meager spoils from the dull man next door.

But then again, as a master artifact forger with its own resources, crafting some personal equipment wasn't unreasonable.

"Exactly! A skeleton that knows martial arts is unstoppable! A skeleton with a full set never needs to panic!"

With that, it shook its skull and struck a Tai Chi opening stance, grinning eerily at Lin Shan with a clattering sound.

Lin Shan, initially just surprised, grew increasingly alarmed until he suddenly stood up and grabbed the skeleton's scapula when he saw the martial arts pose.

"Where did you learn this from?" he demanded urgently.

He couldn't help but feel excited—this looked exactly like something from his previous world. After over a decade in this world, those memories had nearly faded away.

"Clack?" 

The Black Skeleton Monarch was startled, initially thinking Lin Shan saw it as a threat and wanted to eliminate it now. But remembering their soul contract, it relaxed and disdainfully brushed off Lin Shan's hand before putting on a yellow vest—another high-grade artifact.

"Don't touch me. Our aesthetic tastes differ—I prefer amethyst skeletons!"

"Answer my question first!"

"This Tai Chi? I once visited a broken world where martial arts and witchcraft were prevalent, so I picked up a few moves."

"What was that world called? Did it have planets? A space universe?" 

Lin Shan grew increasingly excited and reached for the skeleton again.

The Black Skeleton Monarch dodged disdainfully and pulled out a black hood to wear—yet another artifact.

"It was called the Lost World. Legend says it was invaded by Otherworldly Evils tens of thousands of years ago, which shattered the world and forced its name change."

"What planets and universe? You've read too many strange tales. Beyond our world lies only the chaotic void."

"The sky is round and the earth is square—that's the mainstream view!"

...

As the Black Skeleton Monarch recounted its experiences in the Lost World, Lin Shan learned that the world's essence had been severely damaged by ancient wars, causing the decline of immortal cultivation due to dwindling spiritual energy. The inhabitants had turned to martial arts and witchcraft instead, a far cry from the technological society of Lin Shan's past life.

"And your Tai Chi...?"

"It's the most popular martial art in the Lost World. According to the locals, its inspiration came from the Otherworldly Evils tens of thousands of years ago."

Lin Shan pondered the information about the "Otherworldly Evils," but the skeleton couldn't pinpoint their origin—only that many worlds had been attacked simultaneously in the distant past. 

These "Otherworldly Evils" seemed distinct from both the "Extraterrestrial Demons" of the cultivation world and the "supernatural" entities. 

Lin Shan recalled the "mirage" he had witnessed in the Poison Burial Great Canyon's miasma winds—a glimpse of a technological civilization's flying saucer. The futuristic sci-fi impression from his past life couldn't have been faked.

Lacking key clues and relying only on the skeleton's fragmented accounts, Lin Shan couldn't piece together a coherent picture and eventually gave up.

...

"Fellow cultivators, this flight from the Bianliang Camp to the Eastern Sea Temporary Headquarters is currently passing over the Silver Spring Market in Huainan."

The airship's announcement updated passengers on their progress, though most travelers ignored it. However, Lin Shan, meditating in his third-floor cabin, suddenly opened his eyes.

"Silver Spring Market?"

He remembered a biography he had obtained from Southern Mage's storage pouch after the battle for the Primordial Vermilion Fruit at Dongting Lake years ago. It detailed the life of a wandering cultivator, "Southern Wanderer," from three hundred years ago.

That had been his first real introduction to the cultivation world, and he had been particularly intrigued by the Southern Wanderer's descriptions of the Silver Spring Market. Later, his journey to the capital and discovery of the Yichuan Market in the northern Yan Mountains had pushed the memory aside.

Now, hearing they were passing the Silver Spring Market, Lin Shan couldn't resist his curiosity and decided to stop by, comparing it to the Southern Wanderer's accounts from centuries ago. He also wanted to visit Elder Zhang, who had mentored him as the chief appraiser at Yichuan Auction House.

It was Elder Zhang who had recommended Lin Shan to Master Zuo, the auction house owner, before his transfer. Lin Shan had even bid him farewell when he left Yichuan. He wondered how the old man was faring in Silver Spring after all these years.

The Black Skeleton Monarch had no objections—it had time to spare and needed rare materials to restore its body to the Golden Core stage. The duo promptly jumped out of the airship's window.

...

The Silver Spring Market in Huainan remained bustling even after the demonic calamity. After the demonic sects seized the eastern territories of the Great Song's Falling Pine Mountains, local sects, cultivation clans, and wandering cultivator organizations had mostly surrendered, leaving the market largely unaffected.

The war's devastation had primarily struck the territories cultivated by righteous sects over the past millennium in the eastern regions, now wiped clean by the demonic tide—a bitter loss for generations of cultivators.

But for the local cultivation world's capitalists, switching allegiances was routine. The new rulers, needing stability, left their foundations intact, allowing business as usual.

The Silver Spring Market, jointly managed by three sects and six cultivation clans from Huainan's six prefectures, had operated for nearly eight hundred years. It now gathered most wandering cultivators in the region, generating staggering annual profits—though the distribution among various parties left much to be desired.

...

On this day, a white-robed youth and a hooded figure in gray robes entered the Silver Spring Market one after the other.
