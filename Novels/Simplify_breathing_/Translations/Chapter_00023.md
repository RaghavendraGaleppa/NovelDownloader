# Chapter 23: Assassination

But Chen Fei, as an alchemist, dealt with these medicinal herbs daily. No matter how fake they were, Chen Fei would still spot them.

"What? More fake herbs!"

Chi Defeng acted as if he had just found out, exclaiming loudly, "Little brother, don't worry. I know that group isn't honest, so this time I specifically had them gather extra. This way, you won't be short on your ten portions of herbs."

As Chi Defeng spoke, he dragged out some more herbs from another room and placed them before Chen Fei.

Chen Fei looked at Chi Defeng. This man had clearly made two sets of preparations: if undetected, he'd profit; if discovered, he had backup herbs.

Chi Defeng was truly a character.

"Let me check again."

Chen Fei stepped forward to inspect the new herbs. A moment later, his expression darkened. There was still a portion of fake herbs mixed in.

Chen Fei stood up and looked at Chi Defeng.

"More fakes? This is outrageous, truly outrageous!"

Chi Defeng shook his head like a rattle-drum, then flipped his hand behind his back, produced a bag of herbs, and handed it to Chen Fei. He said, "Take another look. Fortunately, I prepared plenty."

"This morning, people from the main family came, saying they wanted Steward Sun to go to the Zhang family to discuss something. As a result, Steward Sun tried to run..."

Liu Jun took a few sips of tea, calming himself slightly, and recounted in detail what had happened that morning, explaining to Chen Fei what had transpired.

The Zhang family guards had asked Sun Shu to go to the Zhang family. Sun Shu used the excuse of going back to his room to get something, but then tried to escape through a secret passage in his room.

Yes, Sun Shu had dug a secret passage directly in his room, seemingly long prepared for discovery. However, the Zhang family guards who came this time were very cautious and immediately noticed something was amiss.

They rushed into the room and fought with Sun Shu.

Sun Shu displayed immense strength, killing two of the five guards directly, and then managed to escape.

The Zhang family was enraged, reported it to the yamen, and even put out their own bounty for Sun Shu. They even offered a substantial sum of silver for any information leading to Sun Shu.

As the deputy steward of the medical clinic, Chen Fei naturally had to go there upon hearing of the incident.

"Physician Qin is dead?"

Soon after arriving at the clinic, another piece of news arrived. Physician Qin, who had only come to the North City clinic a few days ago, had just been killed in the street.

The killer wore a bamboo hat, making their face indistinguishable, but Chen Fei knew that the murderer was Sun Shu.

"Steward Sun?"

Chen Fei's pupils contracted slightly. Although the newcomer's face was obscured, Chen Fei recognized him generally by his figure alone, especially since the person made no attempt to hide his voice.

"I'm no steward now, just a stray dog!" Sun Shu chuckled softly, his voice somewhat harsh, like countless fine needles pricking at one's neck.

"Steward Sun, you jest," Chen Fei said, quietly taking a few steps back, his eyes fixed on Sun Shu. "May I ask why Steward Sun has come here?"

"I've been thinking hard today about why the Zhang family discovered my affairs. One reason is that Qin fellow, and the other... is you!"

Sun Shu's cold gaze fixed directly on Chen Fei. "So, before leaving Pingyin County, I had to come see you. Otherwise, I would have been somewhat unwilling to leave."

"Steward Sun, you've misunderstood!"
