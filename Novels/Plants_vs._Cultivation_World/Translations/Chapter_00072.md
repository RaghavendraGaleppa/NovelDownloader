# Chapter 72: Promotion to Outer Sect Disciple  

"I will not disappoint you, Elder!"  

Gu Mo respectfully accepted the token. It didn't appear to be a standard Qinglu Sect elder token but rather a wooden one inscribed with the characters "Shennong Valley" on the front and "Qi Chunde" on the back.  

Considering this Spirit Plant Master Elder's status as a guest elder, Gu Mo surmised that Shennong Valley was likely the elder's original sect. Given the name "Shennong," this sect probably wasn't weak.  

Names of cultivation sects weren't chosen lightly. If someone were to frivolously name their sect "The Number One Sect Under Heaven," they would quickly find themselves in trouble—unless they truly were the strongest sect, powerful enough that no one dared challenge them. Only then would the name be justified.  

Shennong Valley, then, must have inherited some legacy from the legendary Shennong to dare bear his name. It was said that Shennong was the progenitor of Spirit Plant Masters. Even inheriting a fragment of his knowledge would be enough to establish a formidable Spirit Plant Master sect.  

*"Ahem!"*  

Gao Yunrui suddenly cleared his throat, as the situation seemed to be veering beyond his expectations. He had merely intended for Qi Chunde to take Gu Mo as a nominal disciple and leave behind some of Shennong Valley's teachings—after all, as a sect descended from the progenitor of Spirit Plant Masters, their techniques were undoubtedly top-tier.  

But Gao Yunrui hadn't anticipated Gu Mo's astonishing performance, startling Qi Chunde so much that he promised to take Gu Mo as a personal disciple once he reached the Foundation Establishment stage.  

For someone with an inferior spiritual root to reach Foundation Establishment was an immense challenge—unless a Golden Core elder provided full support. Yet, judging by Qi Chunde's attitude, it was clear he wouldn't be offering such assistance. Gu Mo would have to rely on himself.  

As the sect master of Qinglu Sect and a Golden Core Perfection cultivator, Gao Yunrui certainly had the means to push Gu Mo into Foundation Establishment—it would just require expending over ten times the usual resources.  

The problem was, once Gu Mo reached Foundation Establishment, he would become Qi Chunde's personal disciple and thus no longer a disciple of Qinglu Sect. If Qi Chunde ever decided to leave Qinglu Sect and return to Shennong Valley, Gu Mo would have to follow.  

But if Gu Mo didn't reach Foundation Establishment, Qi Chunde clearly had no intention of teaching him any advanced Spirit Plant Master techniques. Either way, it seemed impossible to secure Shennong Valley's legacy for Qinglu Sect.  

*"Sect Master, is something the matter?"*  

Qi Chunde feigned ignorance, though he knew exactly what Gao Yunrui was thinking. However, a sect's heritage couldn't be casually passed on. The techniques he was currently teaching, though not core secrets, were already profound enough—superior to what many sects possessed.  

*"Nothing. Elder Qi, I leave the spirit plants to you."*  

Gao Yunrui waved his hand. If Qi Chunde wasn't willing to pass on his legacy, he couldn't force the matter. With that, he departed gracefully. Now, he needed to focus on preparations for refining the Nascent Soul Pill—the most critical matter for Qinglu Sect at present.

*"Junior Brother Gu Mo, this way!"*  

After descending from the peak of the Spirit Peak, Song Xing and Li Jinmei hurried over to guide Gu Mo down the mountain—just as they had escorted him up earlier.  

*"Junior Brother Gu Mo, to be summoned by an Elder—your future is boundless!"* Song Xing couldn't help but exclaim during their descent. When he and Li Jinmei had become Spirit Plant Masters, they hadn't received such treatment. Gu Mo was the first.  

Of course, Gu Mo's achievement of mastering the Elder's teachings and becoming a formal Spirit Plant Master in just over a month was a talent far beyond theirs. Now, they were eager to know—had the Elder taken Gu Mo as a disciple?  

If Gu Mo had become a Golden Core Elder's disciple, they would have to address him as *Senior Brother Gu* from now on.  

Gu Mo didn't give them a straight answer, leaving them to speculate. All he needed was for others to know he had been summoned by a Golden Core Elder—and that he had even met the sect master. That was enough.  

As expected, Song Xing's expression flickered with doubt at Gu Mo's ambiguous response. In his view, Gu Mo's talent—becoming a Spirit Plant Master in just over a month—would surely earn him a place as the Elder's disciple. Yet, Gu Mo's inferior spiritual root made him hesitate.  

Unable to get a clear answer, Song Xing and Li Jinmei continued addressing Gu Mo as *Junior Brother*. Time would reveal the truth. For now, they simply wouldn't offend him.  

Upon returning to the Spirit Plant Hall, before Gu Mo could retreat to his cottage in the spirit fields, he was summoned to the Administration Hall.  

*"Well? Did the Elder take you as a disciple?"* Unlike Song Xing, Zhao Qiancheng was far more direct.  

*"Elder Qi said he would accept me as his personal disciple once I reach Foundation Establishment."* Gu Mo saw no reason to hide this from Zhao Qiancheng.  

*"Ah..."*  

Zhao Qiancheng sighed softly. To him, this sounded like the Spirit Plant Master Elder’s way of placating Gu Mo. With an inferior spiritual root, reaching Foundation Establishment would be an immense challenge.  

Still, even if Gu Mo couldn’t become the Elder’s disciple, his current achievements already surpassed all other outer sect disciples. Thus, his status as a labor disciple was no longer appropriate.  

*"Here."*  

Zhao Qiancheng handed Gu Mo a new identity token and a set of outer sect robes.  

*"Your application for outer sect disciple status has been approved. From today onward, you are an outer sect disciple of our Spirit Plant Hall."* Seeing Gu Mo’s stunned expression, Zhao Qiancheng chuckled.  

*"Thank you for your guidance, Hall Master!"*  

Gu Mo bowed deeply. Though Zhao Qiancheng was known among the disciples for being somewhat stingy, he was still supportive of talented members of the hall.  

Becoming an outer sect disciple didn’t drastically change Gu Mo’s life—after all, he had already been enjoying outer sect privileges.  

However, there were differences. For one, he could now recruit labor disciples to tend his spirit fields.  

But as he gazed at the Water Spirit Rice in his fields, Gu Mo shook his head. Few labor disciples—let alone outer sect disciples—would be capable of cultivating it.  

Moreover, his fields held too many secrets. He couldn’t risk outsiders entering.  

As for applying for a new spirit field in the valley, Gu Mo had no interest. The valley’s fields had long been divided among the hall’s outer sect disciples. If he applied now, he’d be taking someone else’s land—an easy way to make enemies.  

Besides, the valley was crowded and noisy, making it unsuitable for concealing his Sunflowers. As long as he continued excelling with his Water Spirit Rice, no one would question his outer sect status.  

And now, with his identity as a Spirit Plant Master, Gu Mo could take on specialized missions—missions with exceptionally generous rewards, currently only accessible to three people in the sect.  

News of Gu Mo’s promotion spread quickly throughout Qinglu Sect, partly due to the sect’s deliberate encouragement.  

The sect wanted to show its labor disciples that with enough effort, even they could ascend to outer sect status.  

At the main peak of the sect, when Yao Shifeng learned of Gu Mo’s promotion, he remained silent for a long time.
