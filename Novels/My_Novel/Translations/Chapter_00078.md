# Chapter 78: Blessings and Curses Intertwine, Abundant Prey

Liquor fills a sorrowful gut, bolstering a man's courage, yet it also muddles his thoughts. Pang Long said, "The Madam asked about the matter of Zheng Xuezhang. I cannot hide it, nor dare I."

Li Xian asked, "And?"

"And..." Pang Long took a drink of wine. His appearance was rough, but his capacity for alcohol was poor. After just a few sips, he was already slightly drunk. "You must prepare yourself."

"I went to the Blackwater Gang. The martial world gangs and various sects use cruel methods. Yesterday, I went to the Blackwater Gang to collect a debt and saw a 'human sail'—a thousand bodies. The wailing and screaming were enough to move even me."

Li Xian asked, "Is the Madam handing me over to the Blackwater Gang?" Before he finished speaking, he knew it was impossible. It wasn't that the Madam was protecting him, but rather that there was no profit in it for her.

Pang Long shook his head. "Naturally not. Zheng Xuezhang is severely injured; how dare he bring it up? That night, he injured several of our men and chopped down the gate, so I made him compensate us with nine hundred taels of silver. He didn't dare refuse."

"But..." At this point, Pang Long let out a long sigh. "The Madam is a divine being. To her, we are nothing but specks of mud. Not to mention you, even I am the same."

"I thought that since you showed your talent during the winter hunt and the Madam remembered your name, perhaps she valued you and intended to nurture you a little."

Li Xian thought to himself, *Although Commander Pang is older than me, he is much more naive.*

When Pang Long said this, it sounded more like self-mockery. He set down his wine bowl and said seriously, "The Madam said she wants to send you to guard... Heihe Village."

"So that's how it is," Li Xian said, understanding immediately. His heart actually relaxed.

Heihe Village was a village downstream on the Blackwater River.

Due to water disputes, there were frequent conflicts with the Blackwater Gang. The guards stationed there were in great danger.

Li Xian had a blood feud with Zheng Xuezhang over the death of his son.

Going to guard Heihe Village would bring him closer to the Blackwater Gang, and he would no longer have the protection of the manor. The danger was imaginable.

Heihe Village had been without a guard for a long time. The villagers were bullied, and the water supply was insufficient. The thousands of acres of land in that area had always had poor yields.

What ability or virtue did Zheng Xuezhang have to make the Madam hand someone over? And how could he dare ask the Madam to do so?

The Madam saw that since Li Xian had a grudge against the Blackwater Gang and this incident was caused by him, sending him to guard Heihe Village served as a punishment. Second, he would surely do his best to scheme against the Blackwater Gang.

This was beneficial to her.

That was all.

As for Li Xian's fate, she clearly hadn't thought much about it.

"This matter is settled. Tomorrow, you should go to Heihe Village to take up your post."

"Take care of yourself."

Pang Long shook his head repeatedly, lamenting the loss of a young helper. After this parting, he didn't know if they would ever meet again.

"Alright! I will be careful." Li Xian took a sip of strong liquor. With the matter settled, his heart was unusually calm.

The day he left the manor.

Li Xian carried a backpack on his back, a long sword at his waist, and a large bow on his back.

"This journey will be difficult."

"But..."

"It will also be freer!"

Danger implies freedom, and freedom implies danger.

Guarding Heihe Village... Li Xian was alone, with no one to restrain him, naturally granting him freedom.

However, that area was the most chaotic. The Mountain Wind Stronghold and the Blackwater Gang were both located there. The place was a mix of people from all walks of life, with countless dangers.

"The mountains are high and the waters are long there. If I really can't fight them, it will be more convenient to secretly run away."

Li Xian was not a rigid person.

Heihe Village was about eighty li west of the manor. It required crossing four large mountains, truly a journey of high mountains and long waters.

Noon.

Reaching halfway up a mountainside, Li Xian looked into the distance and saw a winding great river. Because the water was a hundred zhang deep, it looked black, hence the name "Blackwater River."

The Blackwater Gang was built along the river, with well-developed water transport. It was said that they had laid a great formation on the rivers and captured famous martial artists alive.

"Heihe Village is downstream on the Blackwater River."

"But it is not by the river; it is in the mountains."

Li Xian held a simple map. It roughly depicted the Blackwater River, the mountains, and the location of Heihe Village.

He could roughly determine his direction.

After walking another dozen li or so.

Li Xian turned right and saw a hidden path. Entering the path, he looked around and saw nothing but trees. He was now deep in the dense forest.

"The direction should be correct," Li Xian muttered.

Suddenly, he heard a shout.

"Help... Help!"

"A great tiger... It's a great tiger!"

A tiger's roar shook the mountain forest.

Li Xian followed the sound and saw a large tiger chasing three or four men. With a blood-red gaping mouth and a massive body, it moved incredibly fast through the forest.

Just as the man was about to lose his life to the tiger's mouth, Li Xian quickly nocked an arrow and shot it. The arrow pierced through the tiger's mouth, pinning the beast to a tree.

"Are you guys alright?" Li Xian hurried over.

"We're... We're fine..."

One of them had wet his pants. But when he saw Li Xian's attire, his knees went weak, and he knelt again. "G-Guard, you've finally come."

"Oh?" Li Xian was surprised.

"We... We are from Heihe Village. The previous guard was eaten by a big tiger," the man said.

"Are there many tigers here?" Li Xian asked.

"There's more than just many; it's practically a plague," the man counted on his fingers. "Big tigers, big bears, leopards, deer... you can see them often. It's strange, we people have a hard time finding a bite to eat."

"You look at these wild beasts, all fat and strong, but we can see them but can't eat them. If we're not careful, we get eaten instead."

"Alright, where is your village? Take me there quickly."

Li Xian pulled out his bow and arrow, channeled his Internal Qi, and slung the big tiger over his shoulder. Although he hadn't reached the village yet, he had an intuition that although there were many external enemies here, it...

Suited him better.

Before even entering the village, he had already harvested a mountain tiger.

Although he lacked the pills and resources from the manor... but with this mountain tiger, he could skin it, cut the meat, and make soup. The effect on strengthening his body would be tremendous.

If he sold it, he could make a fortune!

"Guard, you're amazing! Amazing!"

The men looked at Li Xian carrying the tiger on his shoulder with envy.

"Lead the way."

Li Xian gave a strong push, carrying the tiger horizontally. The tiger's paw was the size of a head, and its sharp claws could easily tear through skin and flesh with a light scratch.

"Okay, follow me, Guard."

The man walked ahead.

After winding through the forest for more than ten li, they arrived in a deep mountain and saw the true face of "Heihe Village."

"It should be called Black Mountain Village," Li Xian thought to himself.

He didn't see any river, but there were endless mountains and forests.

"Guard, there used to be a river flowing through here. Unfortunately, someone dug a channel and stole the water."

"Now, if we want water, we have to go into the mountains to find a stream."

"But... this water is enough for cooking and starting fires, but it's far from enough for irrigating the farmland."

"We have to take hoes and fight the next village over for it."

"But the next village is protected by the Blackwater Gang. Our guards haven't come for a long time, so we can't win the fights. We can only wait for them to finish using the water before we can use what's left," the man said.

It is common for rural farmers to fight over water. When the fights get fierce, it's not unusual for lives to be lost.

"It's mid-November, the middle of winter, so the fight for water isn't urgent for now."

Li Xian patted the tiger's body.

On the way here, he had also seen traces of wild boars, bears, and other beasts.

This place was abundant with prey.

For a martial artist, eating and training... Here, he had freedom of time and an abundance of prey. Eating and training were not a problem.

The [Four Directions Fist], [Breeze Legs], [Green Luo Palm], and [Great Luo Saber] all still had room for improvement.

It was more comfortable than in the manor!

Blessings and curses are intertwined. This is truly the case
