# Chapter 25: The Divine Son of the Wang Clan

Jianmen Pass.

Stepping once more onto this northern stronghold, Dou Changsheng could clearly sense the difference in the garrison commander's gaze. The broad hand resting on the longsword now held a look of vigilance, wariness, and deep-seated hostility—entirely unlike their first encounter.

This time, the reception was far more ceremonious. The commander himself stood guard, accompanied by a contingent of armored soldiers wielding spears behind Dou Changsheng. Their numbers swelled rapidly, soon surpassing a hundred. 

From a distance, a figure bearing a longbow fixed his gaze upon Dou Changsheng. A towering warhorse, fully armored like a metallic behemoth, loomed over him, its rider exuding an icy aura. The horse's hooves stamped impatiently, poised for a charge. 

These were but a fraction of the many eyes watching him. An unshakable sixth sense screamed of impending danger. Since entering Jianmen Pass, Dou Changsheng's heart had been in his throat, his nerves stretched taut.

Black Eagle Venerable whispered from the side, "The one with the longbow is Changsun Changhong—a captain of a thousand, trusted aide to the Pacify-the-Barbarians Commandant. The fully armored rider is Bai Sutu, commander of a hundred, leading an elite heavy cavalry unit clad head to hoof in black armor. Though only a hundred strong, they are said to be worth ten thousand on the battlefield, unstoppable in their charges."

Dou Changsheng raised a hand to cut him off. Why was he, of all people, receiving such treatment? Merely stepping into Jianmen Pass had drawn the personal attention of the commandant's most trusted officers. With only ten captains of a thousand in the entire garrison, each was a formidable figure in their own right. 

Here, backed by their troops and formations, their combat prowess would be amplified beyond measure. 

He stood no chance.

Black Eagle Venerable, however, seemed unfazed. "The garrison commander deploys his finest not against the barbarians, but to guard against his own people. Disgraceful."

Zhao Manren interjected, "This is hardly surprising. News of Brother Dou's exploits has surely reached Jianmen Pass. Slaying a dragonfly with a single swordstroke, beheading a Xiantian True Realm expert, forcing another to retreat without a fight—such feats are unheard of. Recovering the military payroll single-handedly while enemies dared not strike again... Who wouldn't regard Brother Dou's strength as unfathomable? Even Huoyun Zhenren, a grandmaster ranked on the Earthly List, hesitates to act against him. This reception is well-deserved. I suspect the commandant himself wouldn't dare meet Brother Dou alone now."

Dou Changsheng shot Zhao Manren a sidelong glance. When had these exaggerated tales spread? They'd been together the entire time—since when had he become this legendary figure who could send Xiantian experts fleeing in terror?

Black Eagle Venerable sighed. "A pity." What exactly he lamented remained unspoken.

The commander led them onward without pause. At the main hall, the Pacify-the-Barbarians Commandant stood atop the steps, his portly frame flanked by a man and woman. 

The man had chiseled features, sharp brows, and an upright bearing, a sword at his waist and a folding fan tapping rhythmically against his palm. The woman wore a crimson dress that accentuated her tall figure, her face half-hidden behind a veil. A vivid purple flower adorned her raven hair, drawing all eyes to her as if she were the center of the world.

At their appearance, Black Eagle Venerable stiffened. "Have the Divine Sword Sect and Five Beauty Valley betrayed the Shogunate?"

The commandant remained silent as the woman lifted a flawless hand to adjust her hair, fingers brushing the purple blossom. "The Shogunate grows arrogant," she said coolly. "When did Five Beauty Valley ever swear fealty? For years, we've cooperated out of duty—to resist barbarians, uphold righteousness, serve the Great Jin court, and protect northern lives. Never through oath or decree. How is this betrayal?"

Her frosty gaze swept over Black Eagle Venerable, who promptly conceded, "My words were careless. Five Beauty Valley is indeed a northern orthodox sect."

Five Beauty Valley and the Divine Sword Sect were premier northern sects, their influence surpassing even renowned martial schools like the Heavenly Sword Sect.

Ignoring Black Eagle Venerable, the woman—Zi Wu—stepped forward, her eyes alight with challenge. "The Wang Clan of Xiangzhou," she declared, "a millennium-old lineage famed throughout the land. Their Three Origins Reunion Art is hailed as rivaling the heavens themselves. I am Zi Wu, current inheritor of Five Beauty Valley's Purple Lineage. Sent here on my master's orders, I never expected to encounter the Wang Clan's direct descendant. Draw your sword!"

She advanced to the courtyard's center, unsheathing a slender broken sword.

Dou Changsheng glanced at the commandant, whose silence confirmed this as a planned test—one he couldn't refuse. 

This was Jianmen Pass, the commandant's domain. The duel wouldn't be to the death. The garrison hadn't yet surrendered to the barbarians precisely because doing so would be a last resort. Both sides walked a razor's edge of mutual deterrence.

Five Beauty Valley and the Divine Sword Sect were undoubtedly the commandant's backers here.

Zhao Manren murmured, "Five Beauty Valley is named for its five colors. Their strongest five inherit the purple, white, gold, green, and black lineages. The Purple Lineage is foremost, currently led by Valley Master Zi Tianyi's youngest disciple—Zi Wu here. At twenty-eight, she's just begun her journey to make the Human Ranking before thirty."

Dou Changsheng noted Zi Wu's red attire despite her purple lineage affiliation. He raised a hand to stop Zhao Manren's explanation—knowing their techniques wouldn't help him, an imposter unfamiliar with the Wang Clan's supposed knowledge.

"A correction," Dou Changsheng announced. "My name is Dou Changsheng. I hail from a mountain village, having learned fragments of martial arts from a wandering master. I know only two sword arts—the Xiantian-level Fearless Swordplay and the True Realm's Infinite Sword Canon. I've never claimed to be of the Wang Clan. Should they seek me out, I ask you all to bear witness."

The mention of the Wang Clan made his temples throb. This was his chance to set the record straight, even if none believed him. A prestigious clan like theirs would at least consider appearances.

Zi Wu wasted no time. Her broken sword became a blur, countless afterimages weaving an inescapable net around Dou Changsheng. The commandant watched intently—this test was his idea, though Zi Wu had been eager to prove herself. 

At twenty-eight, her Xiantian True Realm cultivation marked her as Five Beauty Valley's rising star, groomed by Zi Tianyi for greatness. Yet compared to the rumors surrounding Dou Changsheng—the so-called "Divine Son of the Wang Clan" who'd forced an Earthly List grandmaster to retreat—she paled.

The commandant had seen Dou Changsheng before—a youth under twenty already at Xiantian Realm, certainly exceptional. But recent tales of three-zhang sword qi slaying True Realm experts and cowing grandmasters spoke of someone extraordinary.

The sword-wielding man beside him watched keenly. The title "Divine Son of the Wang Clan" now echoed across the land, amplified by an Earthly List grandmaster's reluctant endorsement. Could this youth live up to such praise?

Unaware of their thoughts, Dou Changsheng faced the swordstorm unmoving. His Xiantian qi erupted like a bursting dam, manifesting as countless ethereal sword projections that solidified into crystalline blades midair.

Infinite Sword Canon—Seventh Form: Sixty-Four Swords!

The technique's killing moves began at the seventh form. During his journey, Dou Changsheng had advanced from the fourth to seventh form, mastering its essence—swordless swordplay through pure qi control.

Five successive bursts unleashed three hundred twenty sword qi that drowned Zi Wu's intricate techniques in sheer force. Where she moved with peacock grace, her blade a dazzling fan deflecting strikes, one qi strand slipped through—slicing her veil and drawing a line of blood down her cheek.

Zhao Manren muttered, "To kill you, why draw a sword at all?" Then, realizing all eyes were on him, he blinked. "Wait, that wasn't me..."
