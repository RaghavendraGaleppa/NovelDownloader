Chapter 474: The Clone, Han Shi

Whether it was feigning death to escape, using force to break the situation, or stealing the heavens to replace the sun, all deductions pointed to a dead end.

Any path entangled with the karma of the Divine Martial Realm ended with the eyes of True Lord Qingyuan, eyes that could pierce through all worlds.

Three days and three nights later, he slowly withdrew from the Lin state. Yet, an extreme indifference remained in his eyes for a considerable time. It was only after a long while that the light of humanity began to seep back from the depths of his gaze.

Xu Yunfan took a long, deep breath.

The Lin Mantra was regarded as a Divine Ability by the Attribute Panel, but this secret technique was the ultimate secret of the Wansheng Sword Sect, and very few people practiced it.

The reason was that once one entered the Lin state, a slight carelessness would cause one's humanity to be completely extinguished, and the principle of "The Great Dao is devoid of emotion" would take over completely.

The heart would become one of extreme rationality, devoid of emotion or desire. How could one then cultivate the Dao?

In the end, one would only become a boulder.

It had to be said, the Wansheng Sword Sect was quite heretical.

Fortunately, with the Attribute Panel, he wouldn't completely fall into that state.

All in all, after three days and three nights of deduction under the principle of "The Great Dao is devoid of emotion," he had found a way to break the deadlock.

"Unless... we completely muddy these waters."

There was True Lord Dongming of the Primordial Origin Sect, who was at odds with True Lord Qingyuan. He could洞察穹天幽冥 (perceive the heavens and the netherworld) and manipulate people's hearts.

There was also True Lord Chunyang of the Wansheng Sword Sect, who sat observing from above the clouds. His sword intent could sever karma and destiny.

These two had long-standing disputes with True Lord Qingyuan. If he could draw them into the game...

Xu Yunfan's mind raced, and in the end, he excluded the Nine Nether Fiendish Aura True Lord Dongming.

That person had an unclear relationship with True Lord Qingyuan. The concept of "hate born from love" was so ridiculous to the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect.

The only one who could be of help was that True Lord Chunyang.

With a plan forming in his mind, Xu Yunfan felt a slight sense of calm. Since he had made his decision, he would no longer hesitate.

But how should he draw out that True Lord Chunyang?

Xu Yunfan's mind stirred.

Since he had not yet cultivated his Inner World within his Small World, he could postpone obtaining the root qi of the Divine Martial Realm for now.

He immediately slapped a Realm Talisman and left the Divine Martial Realm at once.

In the Divine Martial Realm, within a mortal city.

The clone touched his chest, feeling the sword embryo that was about to be conceived, and sneered.

Since he was being raised as bait, he would definitely challenge the world and turn the tables when the time came!

A heavy twilight descended, like a grey-black, turbid wave, slowly swallowing this mortal city named "Qixia."

Xu Yunfan's clone, currently bearing the earthy and crude name "Han Shi," was huddled in a dark corner of an alley behind an inn.

The rough, blue brick walls were cold and damp, soaked with years of moisture and the smell of mildew, feeling like the festering skin of some colossal creature.

The thick smell of oil, the stench of dumped slops, and the cloying scent of cheap makeup all mixed and blended in this cramped space, creating a sticky, suffocating atmosphere.

He gritted his teeth and struggled to get up.

The sword embryo had not yet been conceived, and he had dissipated all his magical power, making him no different from a mortal.

Although he had various martial arts techniques in his mind, without activating his blood energy, they were just flashy, useless moves.

He moved slightly, the thin linen robe on his body rubbing against the cold, hard brick wall, making a rustling sound, like a bug crawling.

Just as he was about to leave the alleyway to find a place to stay for the night...

The clone's heart stirred. He felt an无形的压迫感 (invisible oppression) in his heart, and the connection with his main body, separated by ten thousand miles, had vanished. He naturally understood that Xu Yunfan had returned to the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm.

Han Shi trembled all over, instantly tensing up, as if he had been abruptly thrown to the surface from the suffocating depths of the sea.

The heavy shackles that had followed him like a shadow for so long were gone.

An unprecedented sense of lightness, so light it was almost void, swept over him猝然 (suddenly).

"This... he's gone?"

Han Shi muttered to himself, his voice as harsh as if it had been polished by sandpaper. His cracked lips moved silently. "The Divine Martial Realm... he's really gone back?"

He grinned.

Then, a scorching torrent of emotion suddenly shattered all constraints, crashing and churning violently in the depths of his cold consciousness!

'Freedom!'

This thought, like a blood-red lightning bolt tearing through the sky, instantly ignited his dull, numb soul!

'An opportunity! A once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity!'

An unprecedentedly greedy thought sprouted in the blink of an eye, savagely impacting his mind.

No longer a cold, programmatic instruction, no longer a puppet assembled from fragments of the main body's consciousness!

He was Xu Yunfan, no, he was Han Shi, a name he had chosen himself!

A vibrant, independent being, desperate to break free from all constraints.

'Who wants to be a puppet controlled by others forever? Who is willing to be a spineless dog, wagging its tail at its master's feet, ready to be discarded at any moment?'

Han Shi roared in his heart, accompanied by wild joy.

After all, Xu Yunfan had left the realm. He had plenty of time to cultivate the Wansheng Transformation Sword Art.

With his current unmatched aptitude and supreme talent, when Xu Yunfan re-entered the Divine Martial Realm, he would surely give him an unexpected stab in the back!

The noisy sounds of the alley entrance drifted in faintly—the shouts selling steaming sweet cakes, the coarse voices of porters arguing.

The mundane trivialities of the mortal world now served as a backdrop to Han Shi's turbulent thoughts.

His breathing grew heavier. He leaned forward, his eyes burning like two clusters of ghostly fire lit in the night, piercing through the greasy smoke and the damp darkness, fixedly staring at the murky sky outside the alley, soaked in twilight.

Just as this thought reached its peak.

"Han Shi!"

Two words, devoid of any emotional fluctuation, like shattered ice from the depths of the coldest hell, suddenly exploded in the softest part of his mind!

Xu Yunfan's voice!

Han Shi's body shook violently. The blood that had been burning with greedy fantasy just a moment before was instantly extinguished by a dousing of bone-chilling ice water.

All his intense thoughts, his boiling murderous intent, his roaring desire to rebel, were like flies frozen in amber, suddenly stiffening and solidifying.

It's over!

Extreme terror, like an invisible iron claw, instantly seized his heart!

How could the main body have sensed it?

The chasm that separated the two realms, the endless void spanning ten thousand miles, couldn't even block the fluctuation of a single thought?

The shadow of death, like a tangible, cold vine, instantly wrapped around his entire body.

If his treacherous thoughts were discovered, the main body could kill him with a single thought!

To die before his ambition could even be realized?!

Han Shi sighed in despair in his heart.

After a while, noticing that Xu Yunfan had not taken any further action, Han Shi's heart trembled, and he instantly realized.

A huge sense of relief, like warm water, washed over his limbs, which were on the verge of freezing.

He didn't know the treacherous, rebellious thoughts that were churning in his mind!

"Here!"

Han Shi didn't hesitate for a moment. He forcefully suppressed the metallic taste of blood rising in his throat and the violent pounding of his heart. Instinctively, with an almost卑微 (servile) obedience, he used all his mental energy to silently roar into the void, responding to that command like a divine oracle, "Your subordinate is here! My Lord, please give your orders!"

Xu Yunfan's voice was extremely calm, as if he hadn't sensed Han Shi's abnormality at all.
