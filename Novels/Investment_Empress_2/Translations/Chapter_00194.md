# Chapter 194: The Cloud-Piercing... Hammer Mark?!

Cloud-Piercing Sword City.

"Did Elder Zeng miss someone just now?"

"The martial art悟ed by that girl named Ying Bing might be too shocking, so even the Sword City has to keep it secret..."

"Or maybe the assassins from the Rain Pavilion attacked suddenly, and the elders didn't have time to ask?"

"If only Li Jianxian weren't in the Sword Tower. There weren't even eight hundred assassins just now; he could have dealt with all of them with just one sword."

"Naturally, comprehending the strange stone's sword mark is more important!"

The onlookers below were somewhat noisy.

After all, it was well-known that Li Jianxian was a warm and jade-like gentleman who was happy to help others. Over the past three days on the arena, he had frequently produced classic lines.

For example, 'This sword will be very cool,' 'You want to learn? I'll teach you then,' and 'I wish for all swordsmen under the heavens to become Sword Immortals.' These had all been collected in the 'Sayings of Li Jianxian' and were spread by many storytellers.

These classic lines, accompanied by impressive imagery, were widely circulated and enjoyed by many.

Countless swordsmen already regarded Young Master Li as the number one swordsman of the new generation in Yunzhou.

If it were him, having悟ed some martial art from the strange stone, with his personality, he might really share it with everyone.

"Comprehend? That sword mark was drawn by him!"

"Exactly, exactly. Perhaps he has a new insight and is about to leave another mark on the stone!"

"Wait a minute... have you guys noticed something?"

"Hmm?"

"It's daytime, how can we see the stars? And the sky is getting... closer?"

That's right.

At this moment, accompanied by the fluctuations from the strange stone, everyone felt an illusion that the heavens were pressing down, right before their eyes.

Every star was visible in broad daylight, their light flowing as if pulling the firmament down to crush them.

The sky was falling.

Three figures stood on the high platform.

One was a handsome young man, dressed in an extraordinary robe of water-cloud silk. Although he looked to be only in his early twenties, his hair was completely white.

One was an old man with white hair and a childlike face. They looked like a grandfather and grandson, but in fact, both were Law Body experts.

The remaining one was that disciple of the Heavenly Calculation Sect. The vertical and horizontal lines in her eyes were growing increasingly profound, just like the star plate before her.

At this moment.

All three were gazing at the firmament, their expressions grave.

"What is that kid悟ing?" The white-haired, child-faced old man squinted.

They had appeared because the sword mark had vanished, for Ying Bing's sake.

They never expected that after Ying Bing, such a strange phenomenon would occur.

The white-haired young man shook his head:

"I don't know, but... it's definitely not a sword technique."

Before the two could say a few more words.

Suddenly, a mouthful of pale golden blood was spat out. The jade plate clattered as it fell to the ground, tumbling over several times.

"Sigh... she's spitting blood again."

"Sometimes, I really want to advise the people from the Heavenly Calculation Sect to learn a couple of blood-refining martial arts..."

The two Law Body experts were not surprised by this scene.

With a casual wave of their hand, they summoned a chair to catch the woman's body.

Spitting blood at the drop of a hat was an old traditional skill of the Heavenly Calculation Sect.

Rumble—

Just then, the scene of the firmament being pulled down by the stars dissipated.

The earth began to tremble violently once more.

The two Law Body experts exchanged a glance, both seeing the terror in the other's eyes.

Is there more?

We let you comprehend the strange stone, not dismantle the house!

So the two let out a soft sigh. One appeared in the sky above Cloud-Piercing Sword City, while the other appeared deep within the earth's veins.

Both released their Law Bodies, using the self-contained realms within their bodies to support the world of Cloud-Piercing Sword City.

Immediately, the people, who were like startled birds, finally calmed down.

...

At the same time.

In the mental space where his soul will was connected to the strange stone.

The commotion in this wild and ancient world was infinitely more violent than the outside!

"Sky-Overturning Form..."

In a daze, Li Mo understood the incomplete move he had悟ed.

The momentum of this move was clearly unfinished.

---

However, at this moment, his soul will was showing signs of instability.

So Li Mo quickly visualized the diagram of the Ice Cube ascending to immortality and transforming the Dao, to protect his spirit.

The effect was excellent.

But it only prevented his soul will from collapsing; the splitting headache remained, his mind feeling as if pierced by needles.

To continue comprehending further would be incredibly difficult.

"Good thing I saved some martial arts insights..."

Little Li had a good habit: he kept his dreams and life separate.

He had three hundred years' worth of martial arts insights that he didn't use, saving them for emergencies.

This situation was perfect for them!

【One hundred years of martial arts insights successfully injected!】

Rumble—

The vast land beneath the sea of stars trembled at this moment.

Deep within the earth, a heart seemed to be beating, and countless vein-like earth veins contracted and swelled.

The wild land cracked, volcanoes erupted, and all things perished.

The heavens and the earth were now in a state of destruction, like the arrival of a doomsday, a world in the process of perishing.

It became increasingly unbearable.

Even for the one推演ing it.

【One hundred years of martial arts insights consumed. You have悟ed the second form.】

【The Earth emits killing intent, Dragons and Snakes rise from the land!】

"Earth-Overturning Form..."

After悟ing this trace of true intent, Li Mo had already lost some of his clarity.

His mental world had already stirred up a storm.

It was the excited emotion from the Pangu Hammer that gave him a slight boost.

【Two hundred years of martial arts insights successfully injected!】

He wasn't sure how many more insights he needed, so he could only pour in all he had.

The moment the insights were injected.

Li Mo felt the colors of the world fade, and all sounds fall silent.

A tiny figure suddenly appeared in this world on the verge of destruction.

His black hair danced like wild dragons. Although his body was no different from an ordinary person's, it gave people the illusion of being a giant that propped up the heavens and stood on the earth.

His face was blurry.

"I can't see clearly... I really can't see clearly..."

As Li Mo's thoughts gradually blurred.

The figure raised his hammer.

And slammed it down!

The clear and turbid energies of the heavens and earth surged and mixed, then returned to chaos, all split apart by this single hammer strike.

This hammer, split the sky and opened the earth.

This hammer, shattered the universe.

【The Human emits killing intent, Heaven and Earth are overturned!】

【Martial arts insights consumed. You have fully悟ed the true meaning of this hammer technique, completing it.】

【Congratulations, Host, for悟ing the "Heaven and Earth Overturning Human Dao Killing Hammer"!】

"Heaven and Earth Overturning Human Dao Killing Hammer!"

His spirit, like a candle in the wind, completely shattered the moment this thought was born.

Li Mo opened his eyes again.

Then he saw that all the elders of Cloud-Piercing Sword City were surrounding him.

As if they had seen a ghost.

"What's going on?"

Li Mo slowly came to his senses and subconsciously glanced at the strange stone.

Then he was stunned as well.

He saw that the strange stone, which had had its sword mark erased by Ying Bing just moments ago and restored to a flawless state, was now branded with a new mark.

A hammer mark, conspicuously appearing right in the center.

It coincided perfectly with the shape of a certain precious hammer.

It contained an aura of splitting the sky and opening the earth; looking at it made one's spirit feel as if struck by lightning!

It was even more shocking than the sword marks that had once been left upon it!

Li Mo: "?!".
