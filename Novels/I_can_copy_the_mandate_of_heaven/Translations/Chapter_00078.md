# Chapter 78: Massacre of Immortals 1

The sky was high and the clouds were light, with the sun having passed the afternoon mark, casting a warm glow over the landscape. The air was filled with a gentle breeze, making one feel relaxed and at ease. However, this serene scene was marred by the bloodshed on a particular mountain peak.

Li Zhiming's heart was heavy as he prepared to ascend the mountain. He knew that wearing his current attire would make him stand out, so he sought out the body of a deceased Seven Mystic Gate sect disciple. After paying his respects, Li Zhiming took the disciple's clothes and changed into them, rendering himself less conspicuous.

With his new attire, Li Zhiming blended in more with the Seven Mystic Gate sect disciples. Before heading up the mountain, he couldn't help but glance up at the sky, recalling the change in his Heavenly Mandate. It had transformed from a dire prediction of dying at the age of fourteen to a more ambiguous state, oscillating between white and green.

Undeterred, Li Zhiming began his ascent. At the mountain peak, the massacre was nearing its end. The Seven Mystic Gate sect's accumulated wealth and power over the past fifty years had been decimated, with over twenty top-notch martial arts masters meeting their demise. The ground was littered with limbs and bodies, and the air reeked of blood.

Jinguang Monk, who had orchestrated the carnage, felt a twisted sense of satisfaction at having so easily slaughtered these once-renowned martial arts masters. However, his glee was short-lived, as the remaining ten-odd elders of the Seven Mystic Gate sect retreated to a safe distance, beyond the reach of his magical talisman sword.

As Jinguang Monk struggled to maintain control over his magical spell, he grew increasingly frustrated. Su Zongguang, who had been watching from a distance, felt confident that the tide had turned in their favor. Despite having lost several of his own men, he believed that the Seven Mystic Gate sect was on the brink of collapse.

The battle raged on, with Jinguang Monk repeatedly activating and deactivating his "Golden Light Spell" to deter the Seven Mystic Gate sect elders. However, this tactic came at a great cost, draining his spiritual energy. With only three "Golden Light Spell" talismans at his disposal, Jinguang Monk grew increasingly anxious as the fight wore on.

As the standoff continued into the night, Jinguang Monk's situation became more desperate. The Seven Mystic Gate sect elders refused to engage him directly, instead maintaining a safe distance, waiting for his magical talismans to be depleted. With his last talisman on the verge of exhaustion, Jinguang Monk realized that he was on the precipice of disaster.

For the first time, he felt a glimmer of fear, sensing that he might actually fall to the hands of these "mortals." As the moon hung low in the sky, Jinguang Monk stood cold and alone on the mountain peak, surrounded by the unyielding Seven Mystic Gate sect elders, their eyes glowing with an unnatural green light in the darkness.
