# Chapter 106: Dragons United, The Ultimate Treasure!

Chaos erupted once more within the cave realm!  

The twenty-four golden dragons remained out of control, raging wildly and slaughtering indiscriminately! The air was thick with the stench of blood, and severed limbs littered the ground!  

Yet the five Human Immortals and five divine beings had fallen silent.  

Even Li Zhengjing wore an expression of profound complexity.  

Was that man from earlier the third-generation Ten Thousand Realms Crossing World Heavenly Venerable of the Crossing World Golden Ship?  

He had effortlessly taken the opportunity hidden within the Great Zhou's imperial jade seal!  

Was he the Creditor?  

"He is also a Creditor."  

Li Zhengjing glanced at the unconscious dragon girl on the ground and, with a wave of his hand, gathered her along with the fragments of the imperial jade seal into the Parasol Wood Box.  

So the Great Zhou's opportunity had been hidden within the imperial jade seal all along!  

At this moment, the five Human Immortals and divine beings, shaken by the revelation, finally reacted.  

"The Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World Heavenly Venerable of the Crossing World Golden Ship is a Creditor?"  

"Wasn't it already confirmed that the former head of the Ancient Moon Peak in the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect was the hidden Creditor?"  

"Are there multiple Creditors in this world?"  

Awe and terror spread among the gathered immortals and deities.  

Li Zhengjing's heart sank. "Is he the true Creditor? Or... is he like the current head of Ancient Moon Peak, a false Creditor waiting to be harvested?"  

The Thousand Illusions Divine Lord resided in the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.  

This Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World Heavenly Venerable was not the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord.  

In other words, he was another Creditor!  

**BOOM!**  

At this moment, the cave realm began to collapse!  

From his arrival to his departure, the Ten Thousand Realms Crossing World Heavenly Venerable had paid no attention to anyone except the dragon girl during their brief clash!  

He had not regarded any of them as worthy of his notice!  

He had shattered the imperial jade seal, and upon leaving, he had added fuel to the fire of this already devastated cave realm!  

Within the cave, chaos reigned. The flames of the alchemy furnace formation, which had been weakening, now surged violently once more.  

The twenty-four golden dragons had gone completely berserk, rampaging in all directions—even the five divine beings of the Great Zhou were not spared from their attacks!  

"Let's go!"  

The Human Immortals of the various sects wasted no time. Amid the chaos, they gathered their disciples, broke through the cave realm, and fled!  

This cave realm held no further value!  

Among the five divine beings, three also fled the cave.  

They were the foundation of the Great Zhou and could not afford to perish here!  

But two divine beings remained, charging toward Li Zhengjing!  

The first divine being had been the Crown Prince's tutor in life!  

The second was a founding hero of the dynasty, and the Crown Prince's mother was his direct descendant!  

"AVENGE THE CROWN PRINCE!"  

"WHOEVER SLAYS THE IMPERIAL LINE SHALL PERISH!"  

"SCATTER!"  

Li Zhengjing raised his left arm, activating his divine ability to momentarily halt their advance. He opened the Parasol Wood Box.  

The Wall-Climbing Bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree hurried inside, while the dragon girl and the Wave-Severing Gu were already within. Jia Shifang had already been taken away by the chief of the Vajra Temple's Arhat Hall.  

With a fierce strike, Li Zhengjing repelled the two divine beings. Suddenly, he sensed something and turned his head.  

A formidable barrier had appeared at the cave's exit, sealing it completely!  

"Li Zhengjing, you won't escape!"  

The Grand Elder of the Luofu Immortal Sect had, in the blink of an eye, erected a formation at the cave's exit, cutting off the path to freedom!  

"Damn it!"  

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice echoed in his mind. "This formation is no trifle. Breaking it will take time, and those two divine beings are closing in!"  

Li Zhengjing remained calm. Glancing at the golden page's fortune-telling, he thought, "No wonder the Fake Medicine Seller said that bringing the Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns would ensure my survival in the capital!"  

With a grasp of his hand, he summoned a Hall-Pillaring Dragon Column from the Parasol Wood Box, transforming it into a golden dragon to block one of the divine beings.  

He then charged toward the other divine being himself!  

Amid the fierce battle, Li Zhengjing's voice resounded throughout the cave realm:  

"Fellow Daoists, if you wish to live, destroy the twenty-four Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns beside you!"  

"The Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns have already cracked under the backlash of the formation. Work together to shatter them along the fractures!"  

"Once I break free, I can stabilize the cave realm long enough for all of you to escape!"  

With those words, he could spare no further attention, fully engaged in battling the two divine beings!  

The cultivators atop the nine celestial staircases were torn with doubt and fear.  

They feared that destroying the Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns would unleash the twenty-four golden dragons completely, leading to their deaths.  

They feared that once Li Zhengjing escaped, he would abandon them to their fate.  

They feared that risking their lives to shatter the columns would only clear a path for Li Zhengjing alone!  

But now, they had no other choice!  

Finally, a clear-headed elder shouted:  

"Earlier, the Crown Prince treated us as ingredients for his grand elixir! Even the immortals and monks were willing to wait for the elixir to mature to enhance their own power!"  

"Faced with such a divine treasure, Immortal Venerable Zhengjing held fast to his principles, shattered the formation, and gave us a chance to survive!"  

"Immortal Venerable Zhengjing has already saved us once. We owe him our lives!"  

"Now, with no hope of escape, Immortal Venerable Zhengjing offers us another path. Why hesitate?"  

"Without following his instructions, we will surely die!"  

"If we obey, we may yet live!"  

The elder's rallying cry stirred the crowd!  

Energized, the cultivators rushed toward the twenty-four Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns!  

The twenty-four golden dragons tore through countless cultivators!  

Yet many still managed to attack the columns!  

"What are you doing?" roared one of the divine beings. "These are the sacred instruments of our Great Zhou's foundation!"  

"A nation's foundation lies in its people! If you abandon the very roots of the state, what foundation does the Great Zhou have left?"  

Li Zhengjing laughed heartily and hurled his Hall-Pillaring Dragon Column into the sky, shouting, "This so-called sacred instrument—I'll take it for myself!"  

**BOOM!**  

In the southeastern corner, a Hall-Pillaring Dragon Column crumbled. The golden dragon it had manifested flickered uncertainly, on the verge of dissipating without a vessel.  

But at that moment, Li Zhengjing's Hall-Pillaring Dragon Column shone brilliantly, like a dragon's nest!  

The dying golden dragon, now without a home, surged toward Li Zhengjing's column and merged into it!  

"What?!"  

Both divine beings were aghast!  

Li Zhengjing remained unfazed. The golden page's divination had foretold this.  

Eight hundred years ago, when a Creditor had attacked the capital and seized some of the Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns, they had not only erased the "secret activation method" but also added the ability to absorb other golden dragons!  

This was the very method that Creditor had prepared to counter the Great Zhou's twenty-four Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns!  

Thus, Li Zhengjing's Hall-Pillaring Dragon Column could now assimilate the others!  

Perhaps the Fake Medicine Seller had foreseen this, which was why he had advised Li Zhengjing to bring it to the capital for protection.  

Now, two golden dragons worked in tandem to besiege one divine being!  

The divine being locked in combat with Li Zhengjing was more powerful, but not enough to kill him outright.  

Yet as the thunderous booms continued, the number of golden dragons under Li Zhengjing's control grew!  

Meanwhile, the surviving cultivators, witnessing the collapse of the Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns and the rampaging dragons now obeying Li Zhengjing's commands to attack the divine beings instead of them, rejoiced in their salvation.  

The twenty-four Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns were destroyed!  

The twenty-four golden dragons merged into one!  

With a thought, Li Zhengjing unleashed twenty-five golden dragons, encircling the two divine beings in a furious storm!  

"Old Yuan, what now?" Li Zhengjing shouted. "If we kill them, their divine statues will be lost!"  

"If we had a Soul-Severing Whip, we could destroy their inner power while preserving the statues. But we don't!"  

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice echoed from within him: "I, Yuan Zhengfeng, elder of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's Enforcement Hall, command you two to surrender! Your divine statues will be returned to the Great Zhou's State Preceptor! Refuse, and the Great Zhou will lose two more divine beings!"  

"Do you take us for fools?"  

Both divine beings roared in unison!  

"Then we have no choice. Destroy them!"  

At Yuan Zhengfeng's words, the twenty-five golden dragons swarmed the two divine beings. In moments, only shattered stone remained!  

The cave realm continued to collapse. The surviving cultivators panicked, their cries filling the air.  

"Stay calm!"  

Li Zhengjing's voice rang out once more. "Gather in one place!"  

With a thought, he deployed the twenty-five golden dragons to stabilize the ten directions, slowing the cave's collapse.  

The Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns were meant to support great halls. Now, twenty-five golden dragons held up the crumbling cave realm, preventing its immediate destruction!  

Li Zhengjing then commanded one dragon to coil before the crowd.  

"Fellow Daoists, line up in order and ride the dragon out of the cave!"  

His voice was icy. "No pushing. I, Li Zhengjing, will be the last to leave. You aided me today, and I swear to ensure your safe departure!"  

"We obey Immortal Venerable Zhengjing's command!"  

The remaining thousand or so cultivators bowed deeply, their voices united in reverence.  

Having narrowly escaped death thanks to Li Zhengjing, none dared dissent. Those who had once doubted him now held only respect.  

Before, when Li Zhengjing's rapid rise had placed him above them, some had resented his fame.  

But today, he had transcended mortal limits, displaying the power of a Human Immortal and saving them all. To call him "Immortal Venerable" was no exaggeration.  

When someone is only slightly stronger, envy arises. But when they soar beyond reach, only awe remains.  

One by one, the cultivators mounted the golden dragon and were carried to safety.  

But as the final group prepared to leave, Li Zhengjing's golden pupils gleamed, piercing the illusions to fix on a figure in the cave.  

"When did you arrive?"  

"When you sent out the third group."  

The figure emerged, drenched in blood and slumped on the ground—the current Great Zhou State Preceptor.  

Gasping for breath, he shook his head. "I knew a Creditor would come to harvest the opportunity, but I never imagined it would be the Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World Heavenly Venerable."  

He laughed bitterly. "One of the capital's two divine generals was actually a helmsman of the Crossing World Golden Ship..."  

Li Zhengjing was unsurprised. "So your plans were always within his calculations. The Ten Thousand Realms Crossing World Heavenly Venerable took the opportunity with ease."  

The State Preceptor exhaled. "Not all was lost. You disrupted the Crown Prince's scheme. The Great Zhou's opportunity wasn't fully ripe when he took it. I thought that without maturity, he wouldn't appear. Yet he was desperate enough to pluck an unripe fruit..."  

Li Zhengjing pondered. "So why are you here now?"  

The State Preceptor surveyed the ruined cave. "This realm was the Great Zhou's heritage. Its loss is grievous. I never expected you to shatter all twenty-four Hall-Pillaring Dragon Columns, destroying one of our founding emperor's sacred instruments..."  

He met Li Zhengjing's gaze. "The Hall-Pillaring Dragon Column you hold—it's the Creditor's handiwork, isn't it?"  

"Now it's mine."  

Li Zhengjing's tone was calm.  

The State Preceptor slowly rose. "This time, I anticipated much, but never such utter defeat. The imperial jade seal is broken. The cave is lost..."  

His voice grew heavy. "Now, without the jade seal's suppression, the Great Zhou's generals, regional kings, magistrates, and deities will rebel. The empire will fracture, just as the Great Xuan Dynasty did when its opportunity was harvested. Chaos will consume the land!"  

He stepped closer. "In the chaos, the people will suffer. Countless will die, families torn apart. I've seen the paintings of my master from a thousand years ago—the rivers and mountains stained with despair..."  

He extended a hand. "Lend me your Hall-Pillaring Dragon Column. With twenty-five golden dragons, we can stabilize the realm and save the people!"  

---  

Meanwhile, in the Fallen Dragon Cave Realm...  

The Fake Medicine Seller yawned as he watched the scene in his mirror.  

"I told him to bring the Hall-Pillaring Dragon Column to the capital as a bargaining chip for his life... Not to destroy all twenty-four and merge them into one!"  

He scratched his head. "Now, with twenty-five true dragons united, this Hall-Pillaring Dragon Column is second only to immortal treasures in power!"  

"With the imperial jade seal gone, this column is now the Great Zhou's most potent sacred instrument. Whether the dynasty survives depends on whether it can hold the realm together!"  

"Given that, the State Preceptor won't let him keep it..."  

The Fake Medicine Seller sighed. "But with twenty-five golden dragons at his command, the State Preceptor might not be able to take it by force."  

He tapped his chin. "Ah well. Consider this repayment for that favor, Old Zhou."  

With a flick of his finger, a beam of light vanished into the void.
