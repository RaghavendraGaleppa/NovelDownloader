# Chapter 123: Counting the Spoils

The Blood Demon Sect cultivator who appeared clearly had no intention of discussing grand plans with the red-faced cultivator. With a wave of her hand, more than a dozen streaks of blood-colored light flew out, hurtling towards the red-faced cultivator with a tremendous roar.

The red-faced cultivator didn't seem nervous at the Blood Demon Sect cultivator's aggressive attack.

The Jin-surnamed cultivator and the others, however, showed a glimmer of hope in their eyes.

They hoped that the two demons would fight each other, giving them a chance to survive.

But the blood-colored light impacted the altar's protective barrier, scattering light in all directions, but causing no substantial damage to the barrier.

"Fellow Daoist, my Heavenly Fiend Blood Shield can only be broken by a Core Formation stage cultivator. You shouldn't waste your energy," the red-faced cultivator said with a smile, looking at the Blood Demon Sect cultivator with a hint of greed in his eyes.

Zhou Qing was secretly alarmed. Was this barrier so powerful that it required a Core Formation cultivator to break it?

"That's not necessarily true."

Zhou Qing thought of the Spirit-Breaking Arrow in his storage pouch. If he shot the Spirit-Breaking Arrow with the Heaven-Shaking Bow, this barrier might not be unbreakable. However, he wouldn't act now and become someone else's stepping stone.

Although the Spirit-Breaking Arrow was only a mid-grade magic tool, it was a consumable item for one-time use. Zhou Qing had Yuan Mingyue decipher the array patterns on it, and had only temporarily replicated low-grade magic tool level Spirit-Breaking Arrows. He had tried it, and even a low-grade magic tool level Spirit-Breaking Arrow was terrifyingly powerful, even moving him. If he used this only genuine mid-grade magic tool level Spirit-Breaking Arrow, no cultivator below the Core Formation stage could withstand it head-on.

But even the most powerful arrow needed to be aimed, locked on, and hit its target to be effective.

Therefore, the Spirit-Breaking Arrow needed to be used at a specific time to maximize its effect.

The Blood Demon Sect cultivator clearly knew a lot about the Blackwater Sect's demonic cultivators. After being discovered, she didn't waste any words and used all her means.

She was also in the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, but her methods were exceptionally powerful, probably similar to Xu You. She was likely a core disciple. Such an existence was no worse than an ordinary late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

If Xu You hadn't met Zhou Qing, there would be very few people below the Core Formation stage who could kill him.

She immediately released hundreds of Thunder Talismans that restrained demonic cultivators, using both Azure Wood Divine Thunder and Scarlet Fire Divine Thunder, which had the wonders of the Five Elements generating each other, multiplying their power.

This caused Xu You to fall into an absolutely passive position from the start.

But Zhou Qing's physical body had extremely high magic resistance to wood and fire-based thunder techniques, so he was not affected much.

The Blood Demon Sect cultivator ignored the red-faced cultivator's words and took out a blood diamond on her own.

The red-faced cultivator's expression changed when he saw it. "You actually have a Blood Spirit Diamond. Is your master the Sect Master of the Blood Demon Sect?"

The Blood Demon Sect cultivator smiled coldly, without answering.

The red-faced cultivator roared softly, "Go!"

The five skulls around the altar turned into five streams of rolling black smoke, rushing towards the Blood Demon Sect cultivator. But the Blood Demon Sect cultivator's storage pouch glowed, and a shield flew out, dividing into five, blocking each of the five skulls.

The skulls were extremely fierce, but they couldn't break through the shield's defense for the time being.

However, after the Blood Demon Sect cultivator manipulated the shield, she clearly became very strained. Zhou Qing's Eye of Illusion Breaking could clearly see the chaotic aura on her body.

"Her divine sense cultivation is still insufficient to simultaneously use too many powerful methods," Zhou Qing saw the Blood Demon Sect cultivator's weakness at a glance.

If one's divine sense was not strong enough, there would be fewer changes in combat.

The red-faced cultivator clearly noticed this. He smiled coldly, stopped speaking, and sat cross-legged in the center of the altar, quietly waiting for the blood sacrifice to be completed. When that happened, his strength would greatly increase in a short period of time.

Then it would be much easier to capture the Blood Demon Sect cultivator.

But the Blood Demon Sect cultivator spat out an extremely thick mouthful of blood essence onto the blood diamond. The blood diamond immediately expanded to a size of several dozen feet, suspended in mid-air.

The red-faced cultivator revealed an expression of extreme horror. "You spat out so much natal demon blood. Are you courting death?"

Natal demon blood was the foundation of a demonic cultivator. Even a slight loss would cause serious damage to oneself. The Blood Demon Sect cultivator had spat out so much natal demon blood that even if she escaped, her foundation would be greatly damaged.

But in this way, the power of the blood diamond was fully unleashed, rushing towards the altar's barrier with a shocking momentum.

The red-faced cultivator hurriedly retracted the five skulls.

But as soon as he retracted them, the Blood Demon Sect cultivator's pressure was greatly reduced. Her divine sense was freed up to perform more precise control over the blood diamond.

However, the five skulls also took the opportunity to form a ring, trying to trap the Blood Spirit Diamond.

The Blood Spirit Diamond made a rumbling sound, its downward momentum unceasing. It actually carried the five skulls, rotating non-stop in the air, forcibly crashing towards the barrier.

Screech!

The five skulls let out cries of sorrow, while the Blood Spirit Diamond also pierced through the altar's barrier.

At the same time, the Blood Spirit Diamond disappeared, and a blood-colored jade talisman fell into the Blood Demon Sect cultivator's hands.

Zhou Qing immediately understood that this Blood Spirit Diamond was not a magic tool, but a talisman treasure. It was a Core Formation cultivator sealing about 30% of their magic tool's power within it.

The number of times a talisman treasure could be used was extremely limited, generally not exceeding five times.

Moreover, its power would weaken with each use.

The user had to have at least Foundation Establishment cultivation.

The Blood Demon Sect cultivator's natal demon blood had strengthened the Blood Spirit Diamond's power, probably bringing it to 40% of a normal magic tool's power, finally breaking through the five skulls and the altar's barrier in one fell swoop.

With the barrier broken, the blood sacrifice process was interrupted.

Zhou Qing looked at the spiritual herbs planted in the medicine field, and his heart was shaken. This was the medicine field left behind by the Divine Water Palace.

Zhou Qing walked into the medicine field.

He soon realized, "These spiritual herbs are almost all for Foundation Establishment cultivators, but they have been growing in the medicine field opened up by the Divine Water Palace for over a thousand years. Their spiritual energy is shockingly abundant, probably enough to make even Core Formation cultivators covet them."

Zhou Qing suspected that the Divine Water Palace had even higher-level medicine fields.

He still had empty storage pouches, and with his knowledge of medicinal herbs, he used different magic tools to harvest the spiritual herbs in the medicine field, sorting them by type. At the same time, he also found spiritual grains, which were specially for cultivators to consume daily.

Of course, the most important harvest was that Zhou Qing also found a bottle of Longevity Jade Liquid.

This was a spiritual item that aided in Core Formation, increasing the chances of success by half a percent.

If those human Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivators in the Jingyang Domain knew about it, whether they were demonic cultivators or normal cultivators, they would go crazy for it.

"It seems that the news of the medicine field may only be known to the Blood Demon Sect and the Blackwater Sect, but how did they find out?" Zhou Qing was delighted, but also somewhat puzzled.

To prevent accidents, Zhou Qing used Scarlet Fire Divine Thunder without restraint, while also activating Azure Yang Spiritual Fire, completely turning them into ashes, destroying both their bodies and souls.

He collected the red-faced cultivator's storage pouch.

The array patterns on this guy's pouch were even harder and more stable than Xu You's. It hadn't been damaged much, and judging from its material, it seemed to be made of some kind of beast skin, giving off a terrifying aura.

Zhou Qing immediately erased the divine sense imprint on it.

He came to the corpses of the Yuan-surnamed body cultivator and the Blood Demon Sect cultivator. Without any hesitation, he stabbed the Blood Demon Sect cultivator's head with the Azure Myrtle Sword.

"Fellow Daoist, we can cooperate," the Blood Demon Sect cultivator's corpse actually spoke, her voice extremely charming and moving.

It was actually a female demonic cultivator.

When Zhou Qing saw that her corpse didn't turn into a demonic monster like the red-faced cultivator after death, he suspected that she hadn't completely died, so he subconsciously added another sword strike.

Sure enough, this guy wasn't completely dead.

Zhou Qing had learned his lesson from Huang Wenxiang. If Foundation Establishment cultivators in Tianxuan City were like that, let alone demonic cultivators.

Moreover, Xu You had previously been gentle and refined, but he had used demonic techniques to bewitch the Jin-surnamed cultivator and the other two, leading to this calamity.

Zhou Qing understood one thing: cutting the weeds and eliminating the roots was the only way to go.

He didn't think that the other party would thank him for getting rid of the red-faced cultivator.

Azure Yang Spiritual Fire spewed out, burning the Blood Demon Sect cultivator.

"I won't let you go," the Blood Demon Sect cultivator screamed miserably, eventually meeting the same fate as the red-faced cultivator. But her last words aroused Zhou Qing's vigilance.

"Even like this, she's not completely dead?" Zhou Qing swept over with his divine sense, carefully checking everything to ensure that nothing was missed.

"Perhaps it's a life lamp?" Zhou Qing knew that life lamps were the last resort of cultivators in the Jingyang Domain, but what could they do after the true body died? At most, a trace of the true spirit in the life lamp would dissipate, re-entering the cycle of reincarnation.

He found the things in the Blood Demon Sect cultivator's storage pouch.

"Blood Demon True Scripture."

Zhou Qing read through the Blood Demon True Scripture and learned the meaning of her words. It turned out that Blood Demon Sect cultivators were extremely special. After Foundation Establishment, they could leave a drop of True Demon Blood in the sect. If the sect was willing to pay the price, they could use this drop of True Demon Blood to seize a body and be resurrected.

But this kind of price was very difficult for the Blood Demon Sect to bear, far less than re-cultivating a core disciple.

Unless she had a very high status.

"At worst, I'll just change my identity later."

Zhou Qing looked at the Yuan
