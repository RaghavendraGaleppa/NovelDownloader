# Chapter 278: Is the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands Safe? This Battle is Too Tragic!

"This... is the past?"

If not for the cool, small hand in his palm, Li Mo would have almost felt his own existence fade away. The Jade Phoenix God, an existence from a time long vanished from the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, had been stirred into an infinite aura by the countless phantoms—some still existing in the world, others long since annihilated in the river of time.

They had brought forth a sealed segment of the past.

Li Mo saw the aura coalesce into a figure.

It was a figure no different from a mortal. She wore a dress woven from clouds and dawn, her face obscured by a hazy veil, indistinct yet allowing one to feel her pitying gaze.

Before her lay a scarred earth and a dim sun, as if on the verge of extinction.

The sun was about to go out, great chaos was about to rise, and signs of turmoil appeared everywhere in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. It seemed that after one final madness, the world would completely perish into silence.

"This is not a natural disaster, but a man-made calamity."

A gentle female voice flowed like an undercurrent beneath the water's surface, calm yet concealing rage.

"The Nine Heavens and Ten Lands cannot be without a sun."

"I am willing to give up my chance at ascension to shine upon all living beings."

A sighing male voice came from atop a divine tree that reached the heavens.

It was a three-legged divine bird. It moved faster than its words. By the time the sound reached one's ears, it had already spread its wings and charged into the heavens, crashing into the sun that was about to be extinguished.

But how could its power maintain the eternal sun?

And so, Li Mo witnessed a scene he had once seen on a supreme form.

Countless Golden Crows, one after another, flew forth from the divine tree, drawing brilliant trajectories across the twilight-drenched sky. They rushed towards death to reignite the sun.

Crossing a long span of years.

The divine charm Li Mo had never truly understood, he now experienced silently and viscerally.

He also learned the reason for the sun's sudden extinction.

A powerful expert from the myriad races had ascended. In the moment of ascension, they stole the Dao of the Sun which He had been guarding.

He was not the only immortal who, before leaving the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, recklessly plundered the world that had nurtured him.

The 'Dao' would slowly replenish itself, and the world would slowly heal.

But this was far from enough to keep up with the speed of the plunder.

And those who had lost the 'Dao,' or those whose existence was connected to it, would perish, sooner or later.

The woman led her clan, walking between the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, witnessing countless things and clans being destroyed before her eyes.

She preserved each true soul as a seed, engraving them within her own 'God.' Over time, her spirit soul gradually became as translucent as jade.

At some point.

The woman looked up at the Great Yin (Moon), and one could feel that she revealed a gentle smile.

She spoke words difficult to distinguish by syllable, yet their meaning was incredibly clear:

"Existences of the later generations."

"Is the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands safe and sound?"

Muttering this to the moon, she soon continued her journey. Her figure grew distant, finally becoming completely blurred before vanishing entirely.

The scene withdrew from Li Mo's eyes, and he could no longer see the events of those many years ago.

Only an inexplicable emotion remained in his heart, surging.

He slightly raised his head.

Before him was a jade-like brilliance, the very source of those phantoms—the Jade Phoenix God.

"The Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix..."

"Did she leave behind everything she had before 'ascending to immortality'?"

Li Mo couldn't help but fall into deep thought.

It was also possible that she had never left the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands from the very beginning....

So, the sun wasn't formed by the Golden Crows?

Back then, the sun was still a single entity.

Why does history record that the Great Yu Emperor transformed into the sun?

Little Li suddenly felt he had too many questions to ask.

Was this something he should be considering right now?

Shaking his head, he looked to his side. The Ice Cube was still in a daze, having clearly seen the scene just now as well.

Hmm.

Ying Bing indeed found it hard to snap back to reality. She had never seen these things from the Jade Phoenix God in her past life, and the difference from her previous life was...

Her gaze turned profound as she looked at the person beside her.

It was him.

...

While Little Li and the Ice Cube were watching the ancient movie...

---

Outside, the myriad demons, unaware of what they had experienced but unable to see anything, had been staring blankly for a long time. They decided to predict the outcome.

"Rational analysis," said a Great Demon of the Bi Fang clan. "Luan Bing is incredibly fast, and just her combat technique alone is something even we struggle to reach. I think her chances of winning are high."

"Right, if she catches Black Ink and drops him from a high altitude, he'll definitely be smashed to pieces."

"But Black Ink has great strength and strong defense. Didn't you see him clashing head-on with the Splitting Sea Dragon Whale?"

Man Bo expressed his disagreement. No matter how high the technique, it's useless if you can't get a hand on him. By physique alone, Black Ink is definitely a legendary 'King of Endurance.'

The Giant Whale clan agreed. They never used combat techniques, always being very plain and unadorned, yet they still dominated the South Sea. The Bi Fang demon was speechless and turned his head.

"Are all of us in the Avian clan just rookies who aren't skilled in combat?"

"All Water Clan members of the fourth and fifth ranks, come out!"

Wu Qing refused to be outdone. "If he calls the wind and summons the rain, how can the birds fly?"

"I personally saw her traverse the heavens, leaving behind frost that freezes everything in her wake. If she uses this move, how would Black Ink handle it?"

"The True Dragon bloodline can ride the clouds and mist; their speed isn't slow!"

"He's never used that move before. Aren't you just making things up?"

"Mastering frost isn't something a Green Luan clan member, or even a True Phoenix bloodline, can do. Where did you hear such a cheap rumor?"

"I saw it with my own eyes!"

"You've gone blind from your fighting chicken eyes."

"Waah! Elder Shang, say something!"

The Avian clans looked at the Green Luan Clan Elder with aggrieved and furious expressions.

"Hmm..."

Shang Qin Qing spat out a melon seed shell, paused for a moment, and said, "I guess our Green Luan Goddess might get her little foot caught by Black Ink."

"Huh?"

How could you boost the enemy's morale and extinguish your own? For demons, it's roughly the same outcome for a bird to have its foot bitten by a snake.

But before the Water Clan could laugh, she continued, "But it's also possible that, as long as she makes up her mind, she might just grab Black Ink's head and swing it left and right."

Hmm, which 'head' is unclear.

But the Avian clans nodded, finding it very reasonable.

Swing left and right?

Although it's a bit primitive, it's a good way to break free from a hold.

Don't be fooled by Elder Shang constantly eating melon seeds and sometimes talking nonsense; she is an old bird after all, with相当丰富的 combat experience.

"But after hearing Elder Shang's words, it's still hard to tell who will win between them?"

"If they fight like that... *gasp*, it's definitely going to be tragic."

"Who said it wasn't!"

As the demons spoke, they couldn't bear to think further. They felt increasingly nervous, their hearts rising to their throats.

Shang Qin Qing smiled without speaking, as if she had the situation well in hand.

It's just that her smile carried a hint of comicalness.

...

Inside the Jade Phoenix God.

After the scene disappeared, the jade containing the countless true souls still floated quietly there, but its meaning was no longer the same as before.

It seemed to have gained some weight?

"You..." x2

"You go first..." x2 again.

Their eyes met.

The two fell silent simultaneously again.

Waiting for the other to speak first.
