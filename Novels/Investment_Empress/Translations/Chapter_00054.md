Chapter 54: Instant Kill, Have I Underestimated Myself?

In the narrow alley known as Niujiao Lane, a figure leaned against a crooked tree, seemingly waiting for something. Cui Peng, with a hint of anticipation in his eyes, muttered to himself, "After killing Li Mo and staining my Blood Blade with the blood of a genius, my blade art will reach new heights. I just wonder if he has any other experts by his side, apart from the Murong family."

As he pondered, a yellow-haired rat scurried up his pant leg and onto his shoulder. The rat squeaked a few times, and Cui Peng's lips curled into a sinister smile. The little beggar had successfully left a mark on Li Mo, allowing Cui Peng to use the rat as a spy to gather information about Li Mo's skills, companions, and habits.

Cui Peng believed that understanding his enemy was key to an easy kill. With a flick of his sleeve, he revealed a string of copper coins to the little beggar, who had just arrived. However, before he could strike, the yellow-haired rat squeaked again, and Cui Peng's expression turned grave.

To his surprise, a youth in cloud-patterned brocade robes stood before him, wearing a gentle smile. "Cui Peng, you don't look like the portrait," Li Mo said calmly.

Cui Peng's voice was like a cold wind from the underworld. "How did you know?" he growled, his eyes fixed intently on Li Mo.

Li Mo shook his head. "There are many things you don't know about this world." As he spoke, the information about Cui Peng appeared in his mind's eye, courtesy of the Heavenly Fate Divine Eye.

The data revealed Cui Peng's name, age, physical attributes, cultivation level, and a brief evaluation: a cold-blooded and ruthless knife wielder with excellent luck, born to be an assassin.

The atmosphere in the alley grew tense, filled with killing intent. The little beggar, frightened, dropped his sack of rice and fled, stumbling several times due to his weak legs.

Cui Peng, with a Blood Blade in hand, charged at Li Mo, the blade slicing through the air with a mournful cry. Li Mo drew his Chixiao Sword, and the two blades clashed, producing a series of sharp metallic sounds. The Blood Blade, considered a near-mythical weapon, began to crack under the force of Li Mo's sword.

Cui Peng's eyes widened in shock as his Blood Blade shattered, and the backlash of energy destroyed his entire arm. "You... you also know the Blood Blade technique?" he stammered.

Li Mo shook his head. "What is this technique?" With a swift motion, he ended Cui Peng's life.

As Cui Peng's corpse fell to the ground, Li Mo searched through his belongings, finding a silver ticket, a copy of the Blood Blade technique, and some medicinal pills. However, none of these items caught his attention.

Among Cui Peng's possessions, Li Mo found an iron swallow with an inscription that read, "The swallows that once nested in the halls of the Wang and Xie families now fly into the homes of common people." Li Mo recognized this as a token from the Fine Rain Tower, a notorious organization known for its ruthless recruitment methods.

The Fine Rain Tower's initiation ritual, known as the "Wuji Trial," involved a bloody battle among selected candidates, with the survivors being accepted into the organization. Li Mo wondered if the Wuji Trial was about to begin in Ziyang Prefecture.

As he pondered, the little beggar's voice was heard, accompanied by the arrival of Murong Hai and Murong Xiao. Murong Xiao was anxious, but Murong Hai, with his powerful perception as a Shenjing realm expert, sensed that Li Mo was safe.

Upon seeing Li Mo standing over Cui Peng's corpse, playing with the iron swallow, Murong Hai's expression changed.
