# Chapter 231: Interpreting the Painting, a Monkey Brother Actually Appears?!

“Achoo…”

“Why does it feel so itchy right under my nose?”

Li Mo sneezed and rubbed the spot under his nose in confusion. Then, he gathered his spirits and focused seriously on painting.

The wind was strong at this height, and it was the beginning of autumn. The autumn wind made the Green Veined Jade Paper rustle loudly.

However, with every stroke Li Mo laid down on the paper, the ripples on its surface calmed down a bit. The Seven Stars guided his brushwork!

Every stroke poured in a massive amount of his spirit. If not for the fact that he had now opened the Three Apertures of the Divine Aspect and was observing the Divine Form of the Great Dao, his spirit would have already been exhausted.

After the final stroke, the paper felt as heavy as lead, not moving an inch.

“It’s finally done.”

Li Mo opened his eyes wearily. Before him, the strange stone was vividly depicted on the paper, as if he could reach out and touch the weathered texture of its surface. From the fluctuations of its Divine Intent, this should be a Medium-rank Divine Aspect Painting.

To be honest, Little Li Painter felt a bit proud. If it were truly a High-rank Divine Aspect Painting, he might not have been able to finish it in one go. And to copy this strange stone, it had to be done in one breath; if he stopped halfway, he would have to start over from scratch. Even Senior Brother Ouyang probably couldn’t do it.

“Though it was inspired by the strange stone, I’ve drawn my own thing…”

Li Mo gradually understood why painting requires talent. When different people copy the same subject, the resulting images are completely different. For example, if he and Ouyang were to copy the same thing, the results would definitely be different.

“You actually managed to draw it?”

Wei Zhaoliu leaned in to take a look, letting out a soft sound of surprise. While astonished, she also seemed a bit unexpected. “The strange stone is so profound, yet it’s only a Medium-rank?”

Within the Hengyun Sword City, there were naturally many High-rank and even Extreme-rank Divine Aspect Paintings preserved. However, the foundation of the Sword City has always been this strange stone.

“Though it is only Medium-rank, its effects are something that some High-rank paintings cannot compare to.”

“That’s true…”

Wei Zhaoliu looked over. She discovered that although Li Mo had copied the strange stone, the painting differed slightly from the real strange stone not far away. Moreover, it felt unremarkable at first glance, but gradually, it gave one a sense of sudden realization and clarity. This feeling became clearer as time passed…

She had been practicing her swordsmanship diligently recently. Upon seeing this painting, she felt the various insights she had accumulated surging in her mind.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in ‘Wei Zhaoliu’, helping her accumulate strength and break through.】
【Investment Feedback: Bronze Creation Seal.】

“Accumulate strength and break through?”

Seeing Wei Zhaoliu quickly walk over and sit down before the strange stone, Li Mo realized. It wasn’t that the Divine Aspect Painting, with its ink still wet, had such a miraculous effect that it could easily cause enlightenment. The main reason was that Wei Zhaoliu’s accumulation had reached its limit. It was just a spark that ignited the tinder; this painting merely provided that ‘spark of inspiration’.

“I just happened to obtain the Bronze Creation Seal.”
“I also have the Mithril Creation Seal.”

Li Mo held up the Divine Aspect Painting. The Seven Stars inside him were still spinning continuously, transmitting an expectant anticipation to his heart. Regarding comprehension, he had the insights from martial arts. Aside from finding sword practice a bit difficult, he rarely found himself lacking in other areas. Thus, he wasn’t afraid of losing the original effect after deducing the Divine Aspect Painting.

“Let’s use it.”

Li Mo made a decision and took out the small, bronze-colored seal. Without hesitation, he stamped it directly onto a corner of the painting.

Immediately, the tadpole-like patterns on the seal swam onto the scroll and quickly covered it. The scene changed, being rapidly altered. Not long after, the flow of the ink slowed down.

In a daze, Li Mo seemed to see the strange stone in the painting rapidly absorbing the tadpole patterns, gradually cracking open, and soon becoming covered in cracks. It seemed that something was about to be born…

Hum!

The next moment, as the last bit of the tadpole pattern successfully flowed in, the strange stone in the painting exploded.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully using the Bronze Creation Seal, upgrading the Medium-rank Divine Aspect Painting to High-rank.】

【Divine Aspect Painting of the Spirit Stone has been deduced into: The Monkey King’s Emergence!】

“???”

Li Mo focused his gaze. He saw that the original strange stone in the painting was gone. Instead, it was a little monkey… a bare ape standing between heaven and earth. Although it was just a painting, you could vividly see it picking wild fruits in the forests, soaring into the heavens and burrowing into the earth, and even running happily by the seaside…

“Did a Monkey Brother really pop out?”

Li Mo muttered to himself. He seemed to understand something. He took out another Mithril-colored small seal. The seal approached the paper closer and closer, then slowly stamped onto it.

Almost the instant it was stamped, the small figure in his acupoints began to tremble! His body also gradually exuded a profound aura, forming a qi field that enveloped him. It carried the tadpole patterns from the Mithril Creation Seal and钻入 the painting together.

It was the Immortal Body!

Li Mo finally understood. It was the Immortal Body guiding the deduction of this Creation Seal! Allowing an existence that shouldn't exist in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands to descend upon the scroll!

Li Mo suddenly looked up. He saw that on the ever-changing scroll, the ink flowed, outlining something. He couldn’t move his gaze away. His Soul Intent released, enveloping him in a clear light. With tranquility and mystery, it wrapped both him and the scroll together.

Before his eyes, the ink had already constructed a bluestone staircase. The surrounding scenery was blurry and indistinct, but the plaque was exceptionally clear: ‘Waning Moon Three Stars Cave’.

Under the plaque, the ape in the High-rank painting had already changed into a clean Daoist robe. The Daoist-robed monkey stood on the steps and looked back. His gaze crossed endless years and long stretches of time.

In the dead of night, with no one around. One person and one monkey locked eyes.

In the ethereal void, he clearly knew that that gaze was directed at him. It passed through an indescribable barrier, saw him, and could even see the monkey fur under the moonlight, as distinct as flowing morning light. The Daoist-robed monkey was the embodiment of the world’s spirituality; anyone would have this thought in their heart.

Hum—

The resonance of the Immortal Body’s aura grew increasingly intense. It seemed to be establishing some kind of connection借助着 that gaze.

In an instant, the Daoist-robed monkey made an imperceptible nod. He raised his hand, lightly lifted and lowered it three times from afar, towards a certain person’s forehead on the distant shore.

Thump—
Thump—
Thump—
…

These three heartbeats were exceptionally distinct to Li Mo. In an instant, a massive amount of inspiration surged in his mind.

*Somersault Cloud*
*Adamantine Body*
*Seventy-Two Transformations of Earthly Fiends*

…

This enlightenment was too complex and chaotic, flashing before his eyes. Li Mo felt like a frog at the bottom of a well, or a mayfly seeing the blue sky. Apart from shock, he couldn’t comprehend the contents at all, only vaguely knowing the names. These could no longer be described as martial arts; they were Divine Abilities!

Just as Li Mo’s mind was in chaos, like a small boat tossed about in a vast sea, the Clear Lunar Light in his Soul Intent shone brightly once again, liberating him. Thus, the resonating aura of the Immortal Body slowly integrated the insights from earlier, along with the Creation Seal, and branded them into the painting.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully using the Mithril Creation Seal, upgrading the High-rank Divine Aspect Painting to Extreme-rank.】
【The Monkey King’s Emergence has been deduced into: Wukong Seeking the Dao!】

PS: Sorry for being a bit late. I’ve finally slowly started to unfold the settings of the Immortal Body. I was quite careful while writing it. I gave the Immortal Body too early, and I’ve never written a fantasy genre before. Also, due to my personal writing style, I dislike writing settings and items that are used and then discarded, which led to a poor viewing experience. I’m grateful to the readers for your tolerance in reading this far. Please charge and support this author, mwah~
