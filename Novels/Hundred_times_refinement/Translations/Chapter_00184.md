# Chapter 132: The Immortal's Retreat  

The medicinal shop was located in the heart of the market district, exquisitely decorated. Lin Xuan sized it up briefly before stepping inside without hesitation.  

The shopkeeper was a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator. Upon recognizing Lin Xuan’s Foundation Establishment cultivation, his face immediately lit up with a respectful smile as he greeted him, "Esteemed senior, what do you require?"  

...  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan left the shop satisfied.  

Apart from the Seven-Star Grass needed as a catalyst, the ingredients for refining the Meridian Transformation Pill were relatively common and not particularly rare. Thus, Lin Xuan had easily gathered everything he needed.  

However, his next purchase proved far less smooth.  

Lin Xuan visited several talisman-specialized shops in succession but failed to acquire the beast talismans he desired. Not only were there no talismans sealing second-tier demon beast souls, but even first-tier ones were unavailable.  

This frustrated Lin Xuan, who had only recently discovered the jade pendant’s capabilities.  

For a long time, Lin Xuan had wished to freely use such talismans. Controlling beast talismans required only a portion of his spiritual sense and minimal expenditure of spiritual power, making them highly efficient. Against opponents of the same level, they gave him a significant advantage, and even against stronger cultivators, they offered a chance at victory.  

Previously, this idea had remained a mere fantasy. Beast talismans were too expensive, too rare, and consumable—a single precious second-tier beast talisman could only be used a few times. Though Lin Xuan was far wealthier than his peers, even he couldn’t afford such extravagance.  

In theory, he could purify pills to exchange for spirit stones, but that would draw too much attention. Unless absolutely necessary, Lin Xuan wouldn’t take such a foolish risk.  

Now that he had discovered the jade pendant could replenish the soul energy of beast talismans, his concerns vanished.  

Yet reality differed from his expectations. Beast talismans weren’t just expensive—they were practically unavailable on the market.  

Currently, Lin Xuan possessed two beast talismans—the Sky Soaring Bird and the Flame Rhinoceros—but his spiritual sense could simultaneously control five.  

Originally, he had planned to spend heavily to acquire three more to bolster his strength. Yet, even in the largest market in Youzhou, he couldn’t find any for sale.  

Upon reflection, Lin Xuan realized that the beast talismans he currently owned had all been obtained through sheer luck.  

Exiting the last talisman shop, Lin Xuan sighed. According to the shopkeeper, beast talismans were rarely sold in stores; they only occasionally appeared at auctions.  

Standing in place, Lin Xuan pondered for a moment. Though this was useful information, it didn’t help him much. There was no telling when an auction might feature beast talismans, and he couldn’t afford to wait indefinitely.  

---  

Forget it. This matter would have to wait.  

Once Lin Yue'er’s cultivation reached a level equivalent to a human Foundation Establishment cultivator, she could learn the ghost path’s soul-condensing techniques.  

Of course, there would be many challenges ahead, but those were concerns for later. For now, his priority was refining the Meridian Transformation Pill and swiftly improving his own strength.  

Originally, Lin Xuan had planned to return to the Spirit Medicine Mountain immediately after leaving the market to begin secluded cultivation. However, as he passed by a teahouse named "The Immortal’s Retreat," he paused.  

After a brief hesitation, he stepped inside.  

"Esteemed senior, please take a seat."  

Unlike other markets managed by outer sect disciples, this massive market—jointly operated by dozens of sects—employed actual cultivators for even the most menial tasks. The waiter before him, though insignificant in cultivation, was a genuine inner sect disciple of a minor sect.  

Lin Xuan nodded impassively and took a seat by the window, ordering a cup of "Snow Domain Immortal Tea" to sip slowly.  

The tea was said to have calming and mind-stabilizing properties.  

After a few sips, Lin Xuan indeed felt his mind grow more tranquil. He then extended his spiritual sense, eavesdropping on the conversations of the cultivators around him.  

Lin Xuan hadn’t come here just for tea.  

Many cultivators present shared the same goal—exchanging information to aid their cultivation. Thus, his actions were perfectly normal and drew no attention.  

After all, no fool would discuss truly sensitive matters in public.  

The chatter was noisy, but after filtering it with his spiritual sense, Lin Xuan easily found the conversation he sought.  

"I heard that during the Nascent Soul Conference, the Breeze Cloud Sect tried to assert dominance but ended up suffering a hidden loss instead."  

A rough voice reached Lin Xuan’s ears, and he immediately focused. About five or six zhang away sat several cultivators dressed in various styles—clearly rogue cultivators.  

"Oh? Were you there, brother?"  

"Though unworthy, I happened to attend," the voice replied smugly. Lin Xuan used his Spirit Eye Technique to scan the speaker—a rogue cultivator at the third layer of Foundation Establishment.  

"What happened? Tell us!"  

"Yeah, was the Nascent Soul senior present?"  

...  

The group clamored with questions, their faces filled with awe. A Nascent Soul cultivator was a legendary existence to them.  

The rogue cultivator surnamed Yuan was momentarily overwhelmed, unsure whom to answer first.  

"Alright, alright. Let’s take turns, or let Brother Yuan tell the story himself," a beautiful woman interjected. She appeared to be in her late twenties, with striking features, a voluptuous figure, and an alluring charm—likely cultivated through a seduction technique.  

The man surnamed Yuan swallowed hard and began recounting his experience. Lin Xuan already knew the earlier events, so he focused on what had happened at the Breeze Cloud Sect after his departure.  

"After the Nascent Soul Conference ended, many cultivators lingered in the Cloud Sea Plaza. I was negotiating with a sect I favored..."  

"Oh? Brother Yuan plans to abandon the rogue path and join a sect?"  

"Yes," the burly man nodded. The beautiful woman shot the interrupter a glare. "Don’t interrupt. Let Brother Yuan continue."  

Though the interrupter’s cultivation was higher, whether due to lust or the woman’s charm, he obediently fell silent.  

Watching this, Lin Xuan grew wary. He reminded himself to be cautious around female cultivators skilled in seduction techniques.  

The man surnamed Yuan continued, "While I was discussing terms with the Sea Dragon Sect’s representative, the Breeze Cloud Sect suddenly activated the plaza’s restrictions, barring anyone from leaving."  

The others gasped in disbelief. "The Breeze Cloud Sect is powerful, and with their new Nascent Soul cultivator, they’ve surpassed the other two great sects. But to detain fellow cultivators so brazenly—isn’t that too tyrannical? Weren’t they afraid of inciting outrage?"  

"I can’t speak for the other sects, but as a rogue cultivator, I was too scared to protest. To the three great sects, we’re nothing." Yuan Li sighed, his expression self-deprecating. "Later, a Breeze Cloud elder explained that intruders had stolen precious herbs from their medicinal garden and asked for our cooperation."  

The listeners exchanged glances. Who would dare provoke the Breeze Cloud Sect at its peak?  

"What happened next?"  

"Next?" Yuan Li rolled his eyes. "Nothing much. About half an hour later, the Breeze Cloud Sect’s leader returned from the garden, apologized, and let us leave."  

The crowd murmured in disappointment at the anticlimactic ending. Lin Xuan, however, was impressed.  

Restraint—a true leader knew when to yield.  

With no leads on who had taken the Seven-Star Grass, detaining the attendees any longer would have been futile and provoked resentment.  

Relieved, Lin Xuan set down a weight in his heart. Since no investigation had occurred, suspicion would never fall on him. With this reassurance, he resumed drinking his tea, though snippets of conversation still reached his ears.  

"What herbs did the Breeze Cloud Sect lose?"  

"Who knows? They wouldn’t admit such a humiliation."  

"True. But it’s bizarre. With two Nascent Soul cultivators, who would dare challenge them?"  

"Maybe it was the work of the Thundercloud Manor or the Verdant Valley Sect."  

"Shh! Are you trying to get yourself killed? Spreading such rumors—if the three great sects hear, you’ll die without a grave!"  

"What’s there to fear? The odds of a high-ranking member being here are slim. Besides, as a rogue cultivator, I can always flee if things go south. How would they ever find me?" A scholar-robed man smirked arrogantly.
