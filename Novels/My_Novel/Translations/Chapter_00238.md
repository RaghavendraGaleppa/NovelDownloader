Chapter 238: In a Dire Situation, Clad in Rags

The sea of flames raged violently, scorching heat pressing in on all sides.

Zhao Zhiyuan, Qian Jingpeng, Xi Kairen, Su Qiuwu, and Li Quan joined forces to fend off the arrows, focusing their energy. Hearing the screams rising and falling around them and the surging waves of fire, they thought of how they had arrived with such momentum, certain of victory, surrounding their prey with numbers, only to suffer heavy casualties because of a single youth. Their hearts were filled with unbearable frustration and vexation.

Li Quan cursed, "If it weren't for you four being cowardly and unwilling to act quickly with me to capture that boy all at once, how would we have all this trouble?"

The other four remained silent, their expressions indignant, but they knew it was the truth. It was all because they had been calculating against each other, being perfunctory, and afraid of suffering a loss that they had lost their footing at this critical juncture. Li Quan said with a sense of satisfaction, "Su Qiuwu, you said my brother and I were foolish, tricked by a pretty boy. Now that you've personally stepped in, did you manage to capture him easily?"

Su Qiuwu was embarrassed and angry. He glared fiercely but couldn't find a retort. Zhao Zhiyuan cursed, "That damned little bastard! All the disciples I brought have been ruined by him!"

"He's actually quite patient! He's determined to compete with us in endurance!" Xi Kairen said with resentment. "To be held up like this by a little bastard is truly the height of humiliation!"

After the sea of flowers exploded, it had stirred up a raging inferno. Now, thick smoke billowed, obscuring their vision. The cliffs were far away, and they could only catch a faint glimpse of them. To protect their own lives, the five men abandoned the distant target and focused on their immediate surroundings, waiting for the arrows to arrive before countering them.

The arrows came intermittently. After a stalemate of about half an hour, the sky turned dark, and thunder rumbled. "Clatter," rain began to fall.

The coolness gently caressed the众人 (everyone).

The oppressive, scorching heat finally began to subside. Being drenched from head to toe was incredibly refreshing. Su Qiuwu calmed down, his emotions settling slightly. He glanced at the cliff and said, "That boy is still hanging on the cliff. The cliff is extremely high and the surface is smooth. His lightness skill is average, and he's carrying someone. He definitely can't escape easily. Let's take a detour to pursue him, avoiding the range of the arrows, and capture him at the top of the mountain!"

Zhao Zhiyuan, Li Quan... seeing that eighty percent of their accompanying disciples had been killed or injured, felt heartache, regret, rage, and unwillingness. They naturally wouldn't let Li Xian go. All of them said, "That little bastard who kills without blinking an eye, I need to chop him up alive!"

So they detoured around the sea of flowers and climbed the mountain along the path. The mountain was steep and extremely treacherous. The five men had exceptional lightness skills, their figures darting and leaping. They were all afraid Li Xian would escape again, so their speed was incredibly fast.

The mountain was towering. Having just experienced a heavy rain, a mist shrouded the area. At a height of several dozen zhang, water vapor began to condense. A cool breeze blew at the summit, and the air was thick with moisture.

The group reached the mountaintop and saw the mountain peaks scattered about. It was already evening, and the golden afterglow tinted the landscape, creating a magnificent spectacle. But they had no heart to admire the scenery. They all peered downwards. Through the hazy mist, they could vaguely make out two figures. Li Quan was overjoyed and said, "He really hasn't run!"

"Hurry, hurry and bring them up!"

Qian Jingpeng held a soft whip and said, "I'll do it!" He was skilled in the "Grey Eagle Probing the Sky" technique, and the higher the place, the more at ease he was. He was also extremely proficient in "Leaping Up," and none of the others present could match him.

Su Qiuwu said, "Alright, we'll provide support for you!" The other four stood at the edge of the cliff, holding stones, small darts, and other items. If any arrows were shot, they would knock them down.

Qian Jingpeng leaped out, his arms spread wide, exuding the aura of a grey eagle. A great wind swirled around him. He fell about a dozen zhang, threw out his whip, and wrapped it around the two figures. Overjoyed, Qian Jingpeng gave a mighty heave and flung the two onto the cliff top. Then he used his lightness skill to ascend back to the summit.

Su Qiuwu, Li Quan, Xi Kairen, and Zhao Zhiyuan saw Li Xian and Wen Caishang fly up from the cliff and land on the ground with a "thud." They were all excited. Su Qiuwu, in his joy, couldn't help but be suspicious: "Could it really be this easy? That little bastard is so cunning, would he really be so helpless?"

They all surrounded them, slowly closing in. Zhao Zhiyuan held his long sword and gave a light thrust, but it was empty. Everyone thought: "This is bad! It's the Golden Cicada Shedding its Shell!" They immediately moved closer and tore the clothes apart.

Suddenly, a "hissing" sound was heard. Several colorful venomous snakes lunged to bite. Zhao Zhiyuan snorted coldly, "Vermin." He twisted his hand and caught the snakes by the three-inch spot on their bellies, snapping their bodies.

With a "bang," the snake bodies suddenly exploded. Fine, sharp snake bones flew into his face, and two fangs pierced his abdomen. Zhao Zhiyuan let out a惊叫 (cry of alarm), his face covered in bloody gore, looking utterly wretched. He stomped his feet and gave his whole body a shake, sending the snake bones and fangs flying. Although the damage wasn't great, it was extremely humiliating, and he trembled with rage.

"You little bastard! You damned little bastard!" Zhao Zhiyuan stabbed repeatedly with his sword, filled with extreme hatred and annoyance. Su Qiuwu's face was ashen. He prided himself on his superior intelligence, but today he had been thwarted and humiliated, toyed with by someone else, and felt a great sense of defeat.

The five men's hatred for Li Xian now surpassed that for Wen Caishang. Xi Kairen cursed, "Truly from the same mold, what a pain to deal with. In such a desperate situation, he was actually able to escape!"

Li Quan, full of resentment, immediately mocked, "We were huddled together for warmth in the sea of flowers, while that pair of lovebirds had already flown off hand-in-hand, carefree in the world. We really have to thank a certain someone with unparalleled wisdom and foresight for his guidance."

Su Qiuwu was憋得通红 (flushed red), his face twitching. He let out a heavy, cold哼 (snort). Zhao Zhiyuan noticed a piece of paper tucked inside the clothes' lining and said, "There's a note!"

He lifted it with his sword and unfolded it. The note read: "To receive a gift without reciprocating is not polite."

Zhao Zhiyuan was utterly frustrated. He knew it referred to the move "Sacrificing Oneself to Become a Martyr." Wen Caishang's understanding of martial principles was profound; with just one glance, she had managed to achieve a similar effect by taking a different approach.

It then read: "You're nothing special."

Everyone felt their faces burn, as if the words were pointing at them. Below that, it also said: "Shameless."

This had two meanings: After the sea of flowers exploded, the Yang fire had burned them. All five men had burn marks on their skin, their faces unrecognizable, hence they were "shameless" (having no face). The group had围攻 (surrounded and attacked) but still couldn't留下 (leave behind) Li Xian, and hadn't even managed to伤 him (injure him) in the slightest. They had lost all face, hence they were "shameless."

Li Quan, Su Qiuwu, Zhao Zhiyuan, Xi Kairen, and Qian Jingpeng all roared in unison: "You little punk, how arrogant!"

The truth was...

Li Xian's arrows were limited; how could he keep up the stalemate forever? He followed Wen Caishang's guidance, shooting dozens of arrows to instill fear in the five men. At that moment, smoke was billowing, and a sea of fire was before them.

Li Xian slowed his pace, occasionally sending a cold arrow to harass them. At the same time, he thought of a plan to escape using the "Golden Cicada Shedding its Shell." The cliff was smooth, but there were岩蛇 (rock snakes) living there.

Li Xian caught the rock snakes and collected them. Then he said, "Madam, we need to take off our clothes." Wen Caishang knew Li Xian had another ingenious plan and said, "You want to use the Golden Cicada Shedding its Shell?"

Li Xian said, "Yes, the longer we can delay them, the better." Wen Caishang had vast experience and possessed the natural grace of a woman of the Jianghu, yet she couldn't hide her embarrassment. She said, "Given the situation, then do as you must."

They used the black smoke as cover. Li Xian reached out, untied the waist sash, and undid the jade belt, sachet, jade pendant... and other accessories, gradually revealing her soft, delicate skin. In this dangerous place, this scene added an indescribable sense of allure.

Wen Caishang's desires flickered in and out, and she inexplicably thought: "If only we could here..." Fortunately, the situation was chaotic, and Li Xian didn't notice.

They bundled the removed clothes and包好 (wrapped up) the rock snakes. They made the clothes look full and hung them on the silken cord. Li Xian thought again: "I don't know how sharp their eyesight is. If they see through the ruse, all our plans will be ruined." He used his Azure Silk Palm, employing the insight gained from the "Back-Carrying Eccentric." He rotated his hands, gathering the high-altitude water vapor.

With the hazy mist as a barrier, it was foolproof! His plan was meticulous, and Wen Caishang couldn't help but admire him: "In terms of strategy and foresight, he surpasses me."

After all this was done, Li Xian spotted the river in the distance and, timing it perfectly, jumped.

This was the most dangerous moment. Falling from such a height into the water would surely create a huge splash. If they were discovered, all their previous plans would come to nothing. Li Xian used the "Word of Lightness" and the "Seven Star Step" in mid-air. He slowed his descent, trying to land as lightly as possible on the water.

They were not detected.

Adding to this, the heavy rain and the five men's fear of hidden arrows meant no one dared to observe their surroundings. Li Xian, bare-chested and naked, holding the fair and soft form of Wen Caishang, slipped into the river and away.

Their speed was slow, but silent and unnoticed. Su Qiuwu and the others sensed something was wrong, but it was too late. Li Xian had already slipped away, escaping the encirclement and surviving.

The river water was cold. Li Xian felt Wen Caishang's warm, living body, as if he were holding a "warm jade." Being young and full of blood, it was hard to avoid feelings of passion.

Wen Caishang felt the same. After swimming for a long time, they had put a great distance between themselves and their pursuers. But to be safe, Li Xian didn't dare surface, worried that Wen Caishang couldn't hold her breath. He moved his mouth to hers, passing the Azure Water Pearl to her.

They swam like this for half an hour, not knowing where they had arrived. Li Xian treaded water with his legs and surfaced. He saw they were still in the wilderness. It was now deep night. He pondered: "Su Qiuwu is meticulous, but that's all he is. I shouldn't underestimate him, but I shouldn't overestimate him either. I've escaped to this place; he probably won't think of it." He crawled out of the river and lay on the ground, gasping for breath.

He had finally survived.

After resting for a moment, Li Xian carried Wen Caishang and walked into the forest. The sky was dark, and snakes and insects were emerging. It was difficult to find a cave, so he found a "Fragrant Barrier Tree" and decided to spend the night there.

Wen Caishang felt incredibly awkward. Although she had been close to Li Xian before, she had always had her strength to rely on, and her mindset was high and mighty. Now, having狼狈 (wretchedly) escaped, clad in rags and walking in the wilderness, she couldn't help but blush.

"I, Wen Caishang, have fallen several times. It's one thing for my strength to be gone, but now... now I've even lost my clothes. If Li Xian suddenly gets an idea, how could I possibly resist?"

Her thoughts were a mess. Yet, she felt the宽厚 (broadness) of Li Xian's back and felt a great sense of reassurance. When she had been afflicted by the "Energy-Devouring Gu" and her internal energy vanished, she had felt cold all over, feeling that the world was vast but there was nowhere for her to lean, and she was filled with sorrow and irritability. Over the past few days, the situation had changed for better and worse, it was hard to say. But now, feeling she had a place to lean on, amidst her cold and ruthless nature, she felt an added tenderness and dependence.

The Fragrant Barrier Tree was over forty feet tall.

The sap of the Fragrant Barrier Tree had a strange fragrance that insects and pests feared. Li Xian knew this from a young age. He swung his saber several times, and the tree trunk began to流出 (flow with) sap. The Sinking River Sword collected the sap, and then he used the "Yang Extreme Sword芒" to ignite it.

A strange fragrance drifted out, and the insects immediately散去 (scattered).

Sitting on the ground, Li Xian recalled the day's dangers and couldn't help but let out a long sigh of relief. He sighed, "Heaven doesn't绝人路 (cut off all paths for man) after all."

Wen Caishang said shyly, "You... help me take out some clothes and help me put them on."

Li Xian laughed and said, "Alright!" He took out his backpack and rummaged through it, then exclaimed in surprise, "Ah! Madam, you don't have any clothes left."

Wen Caishang's cheeks flushed red, both急 (anxious) and ashamed. She said, "How can this be? I... I have no clothes, what will this become?"

Li Xian found it quite amusing. The great "Madam of the Broken Sword" was actually worried about such a small matter. He suddenly thought: "No matter how powerful a martial artist is, they are still human. The common feelings of humanity cannot be avoided."

Li Xian said, "Then you wait here, Madam. I'll go find you some clothes to steal?" As he spoke, he had already dressed himself completely.

Wen Caishang said, "It has to be this way." Li Xian said, "Then wait here, Madam. I don't know if there are any villages nearby. I'll go look, it might take some time."

Wen Caishang said, "Wait a moment... you're leaving me here by myself?" Li Xian said, "Of course."

Wen Caishang said urgently, "Li Xian, that won't do... I can't even move. Being left in the wilderness, what kind of situation is that?"

Li Xian laughed, "Then should I carry you on my back to go?"

Wen Caishang thought it over carefully and felt it was also inappropriate. What if someone saw them? Even if no one saw them, she would be displeased. If her hands and feet could move, she would have gouged out the eyes of all the men nearby. But now she couldn't order Li Xian around, and he wouldn't help her gouge out eyes.

For a time, she fell into a great dilemma, feeling extremely窘迫 (embarrassed).
