# Chapter 44: Peerless Technique - Thirteen Swords of Geng Metal!

The capital.  
Vermilion Bird Avenue, Prince's Mansion.  

Two pairs of eyes stared intently at a calligraphy painting.  

The characters on it danced like performers, moving effortlessly across the paper, each stroke brimming with vitality and rhythm.  

"Loyalty" and "Monarch"—these two characters seemed to contain boundless magic, holding the gazes of Dou Changsheng and Wang Tianhe, who couldn't tear their eyes away.  

After a long while, Wang Tianhe sighed.  

"This painting... has truly become bewitched."  

"I personally burned it back then, yet here it is again."  

"The handwriting, the martial intent contained within—it's all identical, indistinguishable from the original."  

"This isn't the real thing, just a copy. But the skill of the one who replicated it is extraordinary, managing to imitate even the martial intent of Elder Sanshan."  

"This must be Chen Qingyao—Ghost Valley's Divine Lord, master of music, chess, calligraphy, painting, astronomy, and geography, excelling in all fields."  

"Grandmaster Lin Xuanqi was formidable for his demonic arts and invincible strength, but Ghost Valley's Divine Lord studied a hundred schools, synthesized them, and surpassed his teachers—a true polymath."  

"The Great Jin stands at the forefront of the four nations, thanks to such a prime minister and Yu Yun, the foremost of the Ten Great Generals, allowing it to look down upon all other states."  

"A pity about the late emperor—his grand ambitions unfinished, his path cut short."  

"Four years since the new emperor ascended, the court remains in chaos. Who knows if this empress can cleanse the court and restore its might?"  

Dou Changsheng studied the text behind the painting, committing the peerless technique to memory as he spoke, "The empress harbors ambitions of unifying the land, bringing all under one rule."  

"To achieve unification, she must first strengthen internal governance."  

Wang Tianhe scoffed. "The Liu clan has always been selfish."  

"Grand words are just that—words. Only fools take them at face value."  

"Yu Yun is too focused on resisting the northern barbarians, leaving him vulnerable to manipulation by the empress. Soon, he'll be entirely in her grasp."  

"But it's not all bad. At least the empress understands his value and won't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs."  

"To counterbalance Chen Qingyao, she'll keep elevating Yu Yun."  

"That's why the imperial clan supports Liu Qingzhi."  

"The power of the grassland khan's court grows stronger by the day. Tribes from the far north, the Shamanic Sect, the Western Regions' Esoteric Sect—all their elites now serve the khan."  

"Anyone with vision can sense the storm brewing."  

"At such a critical juncture, the nation needs a steady hand."  

"Liu Qingzhi represents the imperial clan and was one of the late emperor's regents."  

Wang Tianhe sneered. This was purely infighting among the Liu clan, with Chen Qingyao seizing the opportunity to elevate himself as the imperial consort, becoming Prince of Zheng and monopolizing over a dozen provinces.  

Yu Yun, now Prince of Yan, controlled the northern territories—though his imprisonment cost him the people's trust. His military headquarters still existed in name, but his grip on the north had weakened.  

The empress had traded away much to secure her throne, but it was a worthwhile exchange—after all, if she hadn't become emperor, none of it would have been hers.  

A true scion of the Liu clan.  

Yet even with Yu Yun's support, the empress might still lose to Chen Qingyao.  

If Chen Qingyao sought the throne, he couldn't seize it outright. The imperial clan remained strong, and the north was unstable. He'd need to weaken the clan and win over the north step by step.  

Now, as imperial consort, he had the foundation for usurpation—he was part of the imperial clan.  

With Zheng under his control and many northerners already swayed, he could sacrifice one emperor to appease the north, then gradually absorb Liang.  

Chen Qingyao moved steadily, each step calculated.  

But perhaps not—Chen Qingyao's talent was unmatched in centuries.  

Born at the wrong time, he faced the once-in-a-millennium khan and the era-dominating Grandmaster Lin.  

For ordinary men, usurping the throne would be the ultimate ambition.  

But for one like him, seeking eternal fame as a sage—a loyal minister unifying the realm, achieving the three immortalities of virtue, speech, and deed—that held far greater allure.  

Throughout history, treacherous ministers who seized thrones were countless.  

But those who became sages? Few and far between.  

Each one was remembered for eternity.  

Wang Tianhe tapped the painting. "These words—just look at them."  

"You've stepped into the extraordinary, become a grandmaster. Now you must cultivate love."  

"This 'loyalty'—unless absolutely necessary, don't touch it."  

"Loyalty to oneself, love for oneself—these are small loyalties, small loves, not broadly praised by the world. They won't help you reach greatness."  

"Great loyalty, great love—serving the people, loyal to the monarch, devoted to the nation—that's the simplest path."  

"But in recent years, I've pondered: great loyalty need not mean loyalty to the monarch, but to Huaxia itself."  

"With barbarians pressing south, divine lands suffering, and the nine provinces sinking—this is a clash of civilizations."  

"Loyalty to Huaxia carries higher purpose, easier for the world to accept."  

"That will be my moment of enlightenment."  

"My elder brother? A blockhead, ruined by books. I warned him, but he scolded me instead."  

"If you fall for this loyalty trap, whether you live or die is none of my concern."  

"You take your broad road, I'll take my narrow path."  

Wang Tianhe waved dismissively, steering away from heavy topics.  

"This technique is a sword art."  

"When the Boundless Sword Sect fell, its disciples scattered, its techniques lost to the martial world."  

"The Boundless Sword Manual you practice is one of them. This is the Thirteen Swords of Geng Metal—an advanced form of your current art."  

"With your sword talent, mastering it won't be hard."  

"Geng Metal is supremely yang, unyielding. This sword art is vast and overwhelming, crushing foes with sheer momentum."  

"Today, the one who best harnesses the momentum of heaven and earth, gathering the force of hundreds of thousands of troops to dominate the world, is none other than the Grand General."  

"You've aided his headquarters greatly. Later, seek an audience with Grand General Yu Yun and ask him to strike you once. Study that wound daily, and you'll understand how to train."  

"What epiphanies?"  

"The longest road in the martial world is the one paved by these old schemers."  

Wang Tianhe sighed, then tossed the painting to Dou Changsheng without hesitation.  

This painting had ruined countless men.  

In his view, the Wang clan of Xiangzhou needn't study books or letters—the more they learned, the dumber they became.  

Better to be brutes.  

But though he was clan head now, it was only due to his martial prowess. They still saw him as a heretic.  

That foolish elder brother of his—he was the one they recognized as the true Wang clan leader.
