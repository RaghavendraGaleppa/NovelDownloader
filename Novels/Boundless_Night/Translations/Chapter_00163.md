Chapter 163: Truth and Surprise

Deep in the night, blue mist silently permeated the air.

The entire city was empty and silent, devoid of any sound. Qin Ming's forehead was sweating, as if he had entered a dead city, where there was no living creature besides himself.

The fire spring was highly abnormal. Its rich blue color was mesmerizing, drawing one in, making them want to sink into it. It was like a will-o'-the-wisp from an old graveyard, equally eerily blue, quiet and still. Qin Ming's body tensed, and he became highly vigilant. He couldn't understand where all the city's inhabitants had gone. The entire city felt lifeless and extremely oppressive.

Suddenly, Qin Ming sensed something. He looked back and found a dark figure in the thick fog approaching him without any concealment. Faint footsteps echoed on the empty street. The dark figure moved very quickly, arriving in the blink of an eye. He was only about 1.5 meters tall, unusually gaunt, wearing a bamboo hat, an old, tattered straw cloak, and straw sandals. The moment he raised his head, his eyes glowed dark red. He seemed to yearn for the deep blue fire spring, yet also regarded it with reverence. Only then did Qin Ming get a clear look at his appearance. He instantly tightened his grip on his saber hilt. The figure's face was also covered in straw; to be precise, it was a scarecrow.

The scarecrow looked at him, its mouth opening to emit a rustling sound.

"What are you saying? What's going on here?" Qin Ming asked.

"A newcomer who knows nothing?" Intense red light flared in the scarecrow's eye sockets, and waves of consciousness emanated from it. Then, it suddenly charged forward, pulling out an iron saber from behind its back and drawing a terrifying arc, slashing towards Qin Ming's neck.

This was truly a sudden, violent attack! Qin Ming was utterly confused. He had inexplicably encountered a scarecrow, and now it had suddenly attacked him for no clear reason. Since it intended to take his life, there was nothing more to say. He swung his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber, quickly counterattacking. Against an unknown opponent, he always went all out. Thus, the entire saber erupted with incredibly dazzling light, like blazing divine flames dancing.

With a clang, the iron saber was cut in two. Moreover, the Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber possessed extraordinary properties; the brilliant and sacred radiance it emitted caused the scarecrow to shriek in agony even before it was touched.

"Stop! Misunderstanding!" It screamed in terror, retreating rapidly.

Qin Ming ignored it completely. It was the opponent who had suddenly made a killing move; now, seeing the situation turn unfavorable, did it expect him to stop? In combat, even a moment of hesitation could lead to one's own demise. With a *thump*, he bisected the scarecrow with a single slash, scattering straw fragments everywhere. A ball of red light shot up, trying to escape, but Qin Ming's saber struck it, causing it to explode directly, accompanied by a sharp shriek, like a shower of embers scattering in mid-air before extinguishing.

Qin Ming frowned slightly. This Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber posed a fatal threat to abnormal creatures. Was he now embroiled in some mysterious event?

Just then, there was movement in the blue mist again. It was a small beast, floating through the air, riding on an object. It didn't seem to be a physical body, appearing somewhat ethereal and hazy. What it stood on, however, was solid: a two-foot-long fluffy beast tail, glowing faintly.

"A weasel Yin Spirit... riding on its tail?" Qin Ming stood holding his saber. Everything happening tonight was too bizarre. Some in the Outer Lands believed that a certain stage of out-of-body consciousness could be called a Yin Spirit. Of course, most experts in the Outer Lands did not agree with this statement. Those not in this field would find it difficult to perceive Yin Spirits; even if one was right in front of them, they would feel nothing. Qin Ming, however, was highly sensitive to them, viewing them as ordinary objects.

This weasel's Yin Spirit was relatively composed. After glancing at the bisected scarecrow on the ground, it immediately clasped its fist towards Qin Ming, being very polite.

"This place..." Qin Ming mused. He had no idea what was going on and wanted to prompt the other party to explain.

"This place holds both danger and great fortune, worth risking one's life for, and it can accommodate many fellow cultivators. Brother, our paths need not cross," the weasel immediately stated its position.

"Please, you first," Qin Ming calmly nodded, saying nothing more.

The weasel nodded, clearly hesitant, but eventually, riding its tail, it plunged with a *thump* into the deep blue fire spring.

"Ah..." Its pained cries echoed from within the fire spring. It thrashed and tumbled inside, splashing large amounts of blue liquid, accompanied by a dazzling fiery glow. One could see that it was no longer as ethereal; it had solidified slightly. Moreover, the fluffy severed tail, once withered yellow, now glowed with a faint golden hue, having gained a certain spirituality.

Qin Ming was startled. What was this phenomenon? He felt a pang of desire. Should he throw his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber in to test it? However, the next moment he retreated cautiously, because the weasel's Yin Spirit rushed out, still riding that pale golden, real tail, its consciousness in chaos, wildly crashing around and continuously howling.

"Profaning... a god... death!" It was mad, flailing its limbs, roaring and yelling, then its eyes flashed with a vicious glint as it charged towards Qin Ming.

*Splat!*

A snowy saber light sliced through, like a searing hot branding iron falling into dry leaves. Amidst sizzling sounds, Qin Ming's Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber not only bisected the weasel but also incinerated it into ashes. Then, he swung his saber again. When the only physical object, the pale golden tail, fell, it was also easily cut into two sections, unable to withstand the pure white blade.

"The blue fire spring is related to god-like creatures?" Qin Ming frowned deeply. If that were the case, the problem had become serious. He recalled that when he first discovered the blue light, it had shattered the clouds high in the sky, expanding in all directions, and it was because of this that he had been flung down.

A hissing sound came, and a large snake appeared in the night, also a Yin Spirit, flying while riding a shed snakeskin, coiling with black mist in mid-air. Upon seeing the scarecrow and severed tail at Qin Ming's feet, it felt some fear and stopped not far away.

"They provoked me first, which led to their tragic deaths," Qin Ming said.

"I have no grievances with Your Excellency, and I would never dare to offend," the great snake replied, polite and cautious.

Qin Ming nodded. With the tangible "battle achievements" at his feet, this kind of Yin Spirit finally knew how to speak properly. He decided to directly ask about the situation.

"What exactly is going on here?" As he spoke, he kicked aside the bisected scarecrow.

"This place is related to divine grace, containing rich divinity. It can be used to refine various spirit artifacts, rapidly improving their quality. If one dares to risk it, it can also enhance one's own divinity, but it's prone to backlash. The domain of a god contains immense might and is truly terrifying," the great snake patiently explained. It rode its skin, landing by the fire spring, and placed the shed snakeskin into it. Immediately, the dull snakeskin rapidly glowed, its spirituality surging significantly, and then it quickly withdrew it.

"Why didn't you continue?" Qin Ming asked.

"My old skin cannot bear too much divinity; it has reached its limit," the great snake said. Even so, it was very satisfied and quite agitated. It wanted to leap into the pool several times but forcefully restrained itself.

"What's wrong with this city, and where are its residents?" Qin Ming asked.

"This is a divine city. There was a great existence here, on the verge of reaching the threshold of a god, but something seems to have gone wrong. As for the residents, I don't know," the great snake said, appearing very bewildered at this point. It hadn't seen any people here.

Qin Ming's expression was grave. He thought again of the blue light he had first discovered; even from such a distance, he could feel its power, scattering clouds across the sky. Could it actually be related to becoming a god? Seeing his grim expression, the great snake quickly explained: "This divine city appeared suddenly. The great existence probably met with an accident. I haven't seen his subjects, meaning those residents."

Qin Ming was astonished. "You've never seen this city before? It just appeared abruptly in this region?"

"Yes!" The great snake nodded solemnly. It, along with the scarecrow and weasel, were the closest creatures with divinity to this place, which was why their Yin Spirits had immediately manifested and rushed here.

Qin Ming lightly tapped the bluestone ground with his Jade Iron Saber, producing a crisp sound that felt very real. His expression was heavy. Was it truly this terrifying?

"Can my saber be nurtured with divinity?"

"You are a person on the path of nascent cultivation. The weapon you normally use has not been refined through ritual. The effect... might not be very good," the great snake said tactfully. Qin Ming learned that the fire spring was the core of the divine city, containing the rich "divinity" left behind after the "great existence" met with an accident!

The great snake departed, restraining its impulse not to leap into the divine essence pool, and vanished into the night.

Qin Ming walked to the deeply blue fire spring and dipped his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber into it. There seemed to be little change. Soon, he took out a palm-sized piece of tattered cloth. It had metal threads woven into it, embroidered with cloud patterns, and likely other designs, but the cloth was too small to discern the main subject. This was something he had obtained after slaying the young man who could turn into mist at Black-White Mountain. It was extraordinary, as even the Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber couldn't cut through it.

Qin Ming placed it into the blue fire spring pool. Instantly, the pool boiled, as if a brilliant sun had fallen into it, illuminating the area and steaming up a dense blue mist.

"This is too dazzling, something's going to happen! What is this thing?!" Qin Ming was stunned. He had never imagined that an unremarkable piece of tattered cloth could cause such a massive stir. However, this sacred phenomenon lasted only for an instant before quickly calming down, as if the great sun formed by the cloth had extinguished.

Qin Ming's innate intuition was exceptionally keen. He noticed that although the phenomenon had ceased, the rich blue of the fire spring seemed to be very slowly fading. He immediately crouched down to look at the tattered cloth. It had actually grown slightly larger, expanding in parts. Moreover, it now glowed faintly. If it had been lifeless before, now it seemed to have "resurrected."

After staring, Qin Ming's heart trembled violently. The metal threads woven into the cloth were no longer dull, revealing their true forms: some pristine white, others shrouded in purple mist, looking exactly like various "exotic metals"! He gasped, inhaling some of the blue night mist. This was truly beyond his expectations; this palm-sized tattered cloth seemed to have a significant origin. This was because Li Qingyue's quasi-immortal item—the Bagua Furnace—was also forged from various exotic metals.

Qin Ming observed carefully and found that after the tattered cloth grew slightly larger, a fragmented great sun appeared at its edges. He finally understood why the commotion earlier had been so grand. As the tattered cloth was being amplified and repairing itself, the fragmented sun appeared, directly radiating light. The great sun was woven from golden threads. Without a doubt, its material was exotic metal.

Qin Ming carefully sensed and found that the blue fire spring in the pool was indeed slowly fading, while this piece of cloth seemed to be subtly growing larger. This stirred waves in his heart, making it difficult to calm down. At the same time, he was filled with immense anticipation.

At this moment, Yin Spirits began to appear outside the city, drawn by the divine city, all displaying expressions of extreme longing. In the distance, towards Chixia City, several scorching suns seemed to hang in the sky, too dazzling, illuminating the dark world.

"A mere demonic worm dares to fantasize about devouring a city to become a god? We've been waiting for you for days!" Someone spoke from within one of the blazing suns, their voice cold, ruthless, and filled with an indescribable oppressive power that caused many living beings on the ground to tremble involuntarily. Clearly, the "great existence" mentioned by the great snake had met with an accident because there were powerful individuals obstructing and specifically hunting it. The figures within the great suns were not physical bodies, yet they were extremely brilliant, illuminating the night sky.

From within one of the scorching suns, a white-haired elder with eyes like two immortal swords shouted, "Qingxu, you all go! The divine city holds no small fortune; seize the opportunity!"

"Yes, Master!" Li Qingxu responded. A high-grade exotic bird spread its massive wings, carrying a group of disciples from the Outer Lands swiftly into the distance. Some were acquaintances of Qin Ming.

"The fortuitous opportunity is immense; disciples of the Esoteric Sect, do not fall behind!" Someone spoke from another scorching sun. Another colossal fierce bird appeared, carrying the disciples of the Esoteric Sect, charging towards the divine city.

From the third dazzling great sun, the sound of an elephant's trumpet came, accompanied by a roar: "You all quickly follow!" Clearly, other species had also arrived, including the young Four-Tusked White Elephant and the Violet Lightning Beast.

A "great existence" had sought to approach the threshold of a god, but was instead obstructed by various parties, becoming a grand feast.
