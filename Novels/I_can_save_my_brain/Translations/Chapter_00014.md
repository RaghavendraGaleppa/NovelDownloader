# Chapter 14: The Lingxu Battleship  

As Chen Daoxuan stepped out of the cabin, chaos had already erupted on the deck of the *Canglong*.  

The panicked shouts of his clansmen continuously reached his ears.  

"Patriarch! There's a massive ship flying toward us from the sky!"  

"Patriarch!"  

At the bow of the ship, Chen Xianhe remained silent, his expression grave as he looked up at the enormous vessel descending upon them.  

Moments later, he turned to Chen Daoxuan, who had just emerged from the cabin, and said, "Take care of the clan members. Keep them calm. That's the *Lingxu Battleship* from the Zhou Family of Guang'an Prefecture, patrolling the shipping lanes."  

"*Lingxu Battleship*..."  

Chen Daoxuan silently repeated the name before nodding.  

After giving his instructions, Chen Xianhe activated a wind-riding technique and soared toward the colossal ship looming overhead. Compared to the massive vessel, his figure appeared as insignificant as a speck of dust.  

Chen Daoxuan wasted no time and immediately set about calming the frightened clansmen, ordering them to lower the sails and gradually bring the *Canglong* to a stop.  

High above, Chen Xianhe ascended until he was level with the *Lingxu Battleship*. Taking a deep breath, he cupped his hands and spoke solemnly, "I am Chen Xianhe, Patriarch of the Chen Family from Shuanghu Island. We are en route to Guang'an Prefecture to purchase supplies. This is our shipping lane pass token."  

With that, he retrieved a black token from his storage pouch, infused it with Qi, and tossed it toward the *Lingxu Battleship*.  

The battleship was entirely white, constructed from an unknown material. Its exterior was clearly visible, but the interior was shrouded in mist, exuding an overwhelming sense of pressure.  

Chen Xianhe had no idea which Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Zhou Family was commanding the vessel, so he could only follow protocol and present the token.  

After roughly the time it took to drink half a cup of tea, the black token flew back out from the battleship.  

As soon as Chen Xianhe caught it, a voice echoed in his ears: "Fellow Daoist, remember not to deviate from the safe shipping lanes. If you encounter danger beyond them, the Zhou Family of Guang'an Prefecture will bear no responsibility."  

"This junior understands!" Chen Xianhe hastily bowed in acknowledgment.  

With a thunderous roar, the *Lingxu Battleship* swiftly ascended and vanished into the sky, leaving the onlookers in awe.  

"Whew..."  

Watching the massive vessel depart, Chen Xianhe finally exhaled in relief.  

Returning to the deck of the *Canglong*, he ordered, "Raise the sails. We continue onward."  

"Yes, Patriarch."  

Chen Daoxuan nodded and quickly instructed the crew to set sail again.  

Once the *Canglong* was back on course, Chen Daoxuan approached Chen Xianhe, curiosity burning in his eyes. "Thirteenth Uncle, what was that just now...?"  

"That was the Zhou Family's *Lingxu Battleship*," Chen Xianhe replied with a faint smile. "Earlier, you asked me why we haven't encountered any demonic beasts on this journey, didn't you? That's the reason."  

He pointed toward the distant clouds where the battleship had disappeared.  

"You mean... the Zhou Family protects these shipping lanes?"  

"Of course! How else do you think Guang'an Prefecture became so prosperous?"  

Hearing this, Chen Daoxuan finally understood.  

The Zhou Family was the most powerful clan within a hundred-thousand-mile radius of the sea. Rumor had it that their patriarch had reached the peak of the Purple Mansion realm, just one step away from the legendary Golden Core stage.  

A clan of such immense power naturally had the strength to safeguard the shipping lanes from demonic beast attacks.  

Moreover, only with secure shipping lanes could trade flourish, ensuring the Zhou Family reaped the greatest benefits.  

Rulers always sought stability—only ambitious upstarts thrived in chaos.  

Of course, absolute protection was impossible. Low-tier demonic beasts, lacking intelligence and acting on instinct, had no concept of safe zones.  

Even the so-called "safe shipping lanes" meant nothing to them. Some would even recklessly charge toward the Zhou Family's stronghold, Spirit Shell Island, lured by the scent of human blood.  

But such beasts usually ended up as nothing more than meals for mortal martial artists.  

"Purple Mansion clan..." Chen Daoxuan murmured softly. "So impressive."  

"Indeed," Chen Xianhe sighed. "The Zhou Family's ancestors were fortunate. A thousand years ago, during the war when the Qian Yuan Sword Sect seized control of the Myriad Stars Sea, they chose the right side. That decision laid the foundation for their prosperity over the past millennium.  

"Even five hundred years ago, during the Divine Extinction Rebellion that wiped out countless cultivation families, the Zhou Family endured. That alone speaks volumes about their deep-rooted strength."  

When speaking of the Zhou Family—the most powerful cultivation clan in the region—Chen Xianhe's voice was filled with admiration.  

In truth, he wasn't alone. Every cultivation family within a ten-thousand-mile radius regarded the Zhou Family with the same mix of reverence and envy, too intimidated to even feel jealousy.  

"Divine Extinction Rebellion?"  

Chen Daoxuan keenly picked up on this unfamiliar term.  

Seeing his confusion, Chen Xianhe explained, "That was a rogue cultivator five hundred years ago who called himself the Divine Extinction True Lord. Somehow, he obtained a great opportunity and wreaked havoc across the Myriad Stars Sea for a full century. In the end, the Qian Yuan Sword Sect had to step in to eliminate him.  

"It was after this that the Qian Yuan Sword Sect launched their war against the Cloud Nation of Immortal Cloud Continent—a conflict that lasted four hundred years."  

As he spoke of the war between the Qian Yuan Sword Sect and the Cloud Nation, Chen Xianhe's voice gradually faded, as if recalling painful memories.  

Not wanting to press further, Chen Daoxuan remained silent.  

For the next twenty days, their journey was uneventful. They encountered neither the Zhou Family's *Lingxu Battleship* nor any demonic beasts.  

Then, on the twentieth day, an aged voice called out from outside the cabin—Chen Xianhe's voice.  

"Daoxuan, we've arrived at Spirit Shell Island!"  

Hearing this, Chen Daoxuan's heart swelled with excitement.  

After a full month at sea—even aboard the *Canglong*, a modified merchant vessel engraved with wind-gathering and water-repelling formations that made it far faster than ordinary Earthly ships—he had grown weary.  

It wasn't the rocking of the ship or the boredom that bothered him, but the inability to cultivate the *Returning Origin Technique* due to the lack of sufficient spiritual energy. His cultivation had stagnated entirely.  

For a cultivator, nothing was more frustrating than being unable to progress.  

Now, Chen Daoxuan finally understood a fraction of Chen Xianhe's suffering. If a single month without cultivation was unbearable, how much worse was it for his thirteenth uncle, who had abandoned cultivation entirely?  

The thought deepened his respect for Chen Xianhe.  

Stepping out of the cabin, he was greeted by a breathtaking sight—countless white sails stretching as far as the eye could see, blotting out the sky.  

Occasionally, streaks of light flashed across the heavens as cultivators soared on their flying swords.  

Chen Daoxuan knew those were Foundation Establishment cultivators and above.  

As for Qi Refinement cultivators like those of the Chen Family, they had no choice but to wait patiently in their ships, queuing up to enter the harbor like everyone else.
