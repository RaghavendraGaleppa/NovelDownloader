**Chapter 11: An Unexpected Turn**

Chen Fei's peculiar hobby of cooking, especially his fondness for stir-frying pork liver, had slowly spread throughout the medical hall. Stir-frying pork liver was one thing, but he always used only a fingernail-sized amount each time, which was truly baffling. Recently, however, it seemed he had stopped stir-frying pork liver. Perhaps he had grown tired of it, or for some other reason, as he had switched to stir-frying yam and chicken. The only thing that remained constant was the extremely small quantity he used.

Cui Sanjie even specifically came to ask Chen Fei if he wanted a spot reserved for him in the medical hall's kitchen. Chen Fei politely declined. Instead, he spent some money to rent a small house in the county, moving his living and eating arrangements outside. He would only return to the medical hall when he needed to refine pills.

This simple, two-point-line lifestyle, which Chen Fei had loathed in his previous life, was something he now savored in this world. Anyone who saw their efforts consistently yield rewards would likely feel the same way as Chen Fei. Many people weren't born lazy; it was only when their hard work failed to show returns for a long time that they slowly became lax. Chen Fei cultivated, cooked, and refined pills, busy and joyful every day. He even encroached significantly on his night's sleep. Staying up late, too, could be addictive. Time flowed silently, and quickly another ten-odd days passed.

Not only the Azure Mountain Sword, but the Wind Suspension Breathing Technique had also been cultivated by Chen Fei to the Grand Completion stage. The cultivation experience points provided by the Grand Completion Wind Suspension Breathing Technique each day somewhat exceeded Chen Fei's expectations. Originally, he estimated it would take more than two months to cultivate to the Muscle Refining realm. Now, with a careful calculation, he estimated that in just over a month, Chen Fei would be able to break through and become a Muscle Refining realm martial artist.

The Skin Refining realm was at the bottom rung among martial artists, only slightly stronger than ordinary people, and far from impressive within the martial artist community. However, the Muscle Refining realm, while he wouldn't dare make claims about other places, was already considered a core strength level within Pingyin County. For example, Pu Liao, from the medical hall, was only in the Muscle Refining realm, yet his status and position were far superior to that of ordinary guards, and his monthly wages steadily increased. Compared to an alchemist, it was certainly no match, but as long as one didn't spend heavily on elixirs for cultivation, a Muscle Refining realm martial artist could already live a very comfortable life in Pingyin County, enjoying a high social status.

In those ten-odd days, nothing major happened within the medical hall, but outside Pingyin County, trouble arose. A wave of refugees arrived outside Pingyin County. Instead of entering the city, they settled down in a spot outside the city walls. This world was not peaceful. Chen Fei had heard that the current dynasty had endured for over seven hundred years, and some decades ago, various disturbances began to erupt in different regions.

Chen Fei looked at the girl's retreating figure and suddenly realized that this should be Zeng DeFang's second daughter, Zeng Qiling. Zeng DeFang had mentioned this to Chen Fei a few days ago, seemingly intending to set the two of them up. Chen Fei hadn't paid it much mind at the time, not expecting to encounter Zeng Qiling here.

Soon, Miss Zhang Sinan from the Zhang family arrived. Zeng Qiling ran over to her, appearing very affectionate. Zhang Sinan seemed to glance back at Chen Fei, but didn't say anything. A large group of people left the medical hall in a grand procession and headed outside the city. Pots were set up for cooking porridge, while physicians took their seats to provide consultations. Soon, the refugees lined up to come forward. As an alchemist, Chen Fei mostly just lent a hand. The rest was handled by the medical hall and the rice shop's assistants. The aroma of porridge filled the air, and soon it was noon.

"Miss, someone hopes we can make a house call to treat their master."
