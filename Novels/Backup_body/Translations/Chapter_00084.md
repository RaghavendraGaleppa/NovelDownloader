# Chapter 84: A Peak True Qi Expert Can't Handle Him, Send a Human Immortal!

Within the territory of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, turmoil erupted today.

Li Zhengjing of the Ancient Moon Peak, holder of the Gold-Trimmed Silver Token, had stolen from the spirit mine!

During the incident, he killed three inner sect elders, slaughtered thirty-six inner sect disciples, severely injured another elder and a true disciple, and wounded over twenty others while escaping the spirit mine.

The impact of this incident was extremely severe, enraging the sect's higher-ups. Even the Sect Master had ordered all peaks to assist in capturing Li Zhengjing immediately!

Currently, numerous true disciples, inner sect elders, and large numbers of inner sect disciples were scattered around the Xuannan Spirit Mine, searching for him.

"Not long ago, this man killed the Venom King Xin Xuan and was awarded the Hollow Gold Token. Though he hadn't broken through to the True Qi Realm, his status was already comparable to a true disciple or inner sect elder, his fame spreading far and wide, unrivaled in prominence!"

"We thought that by showcasing his prowess with the Venom King's head, our Feather Transformation Immortal Sect would gain another young true disciple with boundless future prospects. Who would have thought he was such a treacherous villain?"

"It's said the Ancient Moon Peak held him in high regard, intending to assign him to oversee the spirit mines. Unexpectedly, they discovered his private hoard of spirit stones. Fearing exposure, he stormed the mine, seized many spirit stones, and killed several elders and disciples."

"After receiving the sect's nurturing, to commit such treason—he truly deserves death!"

Amid the discussions, only Lu Huaiyuan, leading the group, wore a complex expression and remained silent.

This operation included three true disciples, six inner sect elders, and over three hundred inner sect disciples, combing the area around the spirit mine.

"On the surface, he's at the Internal Qi Realm, but he must have concealed his true strength—his abilities are formidable," an inner sect elder said gravely. "All disciples must remember: upon spotting Li Zhengjing, do not act recklessly for merit. Report immediately for a coordinated capture!"

"Understood!" the disciples responded in unison, though some were restless.

Take Pei Ying, for example, who had recently reached the Internal Qi Realm.

Recently, the Chen Family had suffered repeated setbacks. After Chen Youyu's death, several inner sect disciples and Chen Family retainers were killed, with the culprit still unknown.

Elder Chen Xuan died in Shuangjiu City, and now several high-ranking figures had perished at the spirit mine. The Chen Clan in Ancient Moon Peak now had only two elders and seven inner sect disciples left.

From now on, as the Chen Family's son-in-law, Pei Ying would surely receive their support.

"Two months ago, Li Zhengjing hadn't even reached the Internal Qi Realm. His strength was on par with mine. How could he have advanced so rapidly to slay True Qi experts?"

"Still, even if he's a genius, he must have been severely injured in the battle at the spirit mine. If I get the chance, I might be able to kill him!"

Pei Ying couldn't suppress his excitement. "Presenting Li Zhengjing's head would earn me the sect's favor and the Chen Family's attention. My future would be smooth sailing!"

Under Lu Huaiyuan's lead, the group advanced, dispatching members to search outward.

By the time they reached the front, only one true disciple remained by Lu Huaiyuan's side.

"Life is unpredictable. Who would have thought that Li Zhengjing, who recently gained fame as the sect's next true disciple, would now be a fugitive hunted by the entire sect?"

This Junior Brother Zhou sighed. "But he's been with the sect for less than a year. How is he so powerful?"

Previously, when Li Zhengjing killed the Venom King Xin Xuan, many speculated there was more to the story—that his personal strength might not be the sole factor. But his performance at the spirit mine, where he killed three elders, severely injured two, and slaughtered thirty-six inner sect disciples, was undeniably extraordinary.

"His progress is astonishing. Senior Brother Lu, do you think this confirms his guilt in stealing the spirit stones?" Junior Brother Zhou asked. "Without trading spirit stones for rare treasures, how else could he advance so quickly?"

"Not necessarily," Lu Huaiyuan said solemnly. "We've also received the sect's nurturing, yet we haven't progressed like this."

A hint of worry crossed his face. "Consider the Kunlun Young Master. From birth, celestial phenomena marked him as the next sect leader. Since childhood, the entire Kunlun Immortal Sect devoted its resources to nurture him, sparing no expense—yet no one in the sect objected."

He looked at Junior Brother Zhou. "But Li Zhengjing's progress surpasses even the Kunlun Young Master's under such cultivation."

Lu Huaiyuan turned his gaze forward, speaking quietly. "I feel there's more to this."

Junior Brother Zhou fell silent for a moment before continuing, "Regardless, this is ultimately good for you, Senior Brother Lu."

Lu Huaiyuan didn't respond. He understood the implication.

Li Zhengjing's rapid advancement, whether aided by external means or not, was undeniable proof of his unparalleled talent.

Had this incident not occurred, Li Zhengjing would have become a true disciple of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. Soon, he might have rivaled Lu Huaiyuan, even competing for the position of Dao Child—the future Sect Master.

"If he truly surpassed me, I'd accept him as Dao Child," Lu Huaiyuan sighed. "What a pity. The sect is losing a prodigy, a future pillar."

He waved his hand. "Let's split up here. But remember: if you find Li Zhengjing, signal immediately. Don't fight him alone."

Junior Brother Zhou remained silent.

Lu Huaiyuan's expression turned grave. "I know you're proud. As a true disciple with over thirty years of cultivation, you can't accept that Li Zhengjing, with just a year of training, surpasses you. You want to test yourself against him. But his performance at the spirit mine proves he's far stronger. If you see him, flee and signal me. Don't engage."

Junior Brother Zhou nodded reluctantly, and the two parted ways.

Lu Huaiyuan advanced alone but soon halted.

Ahead, leaning against a tree, was a man with a wooden case on his back, a long sword at his waist, and a bag in his hand. He tossed items into his mouth as if eating peanuts.

"Even if you're wrongly accused, wasting the sect's spirit stones like this is a grave crime," Lu Huaiyuan said, his eye twitching. "Stop now. Hand over the stones, return with me, and clarify the truth. There's still hope."

Watching Li Zhengjing swallow spirit stones one after another, even he felt pained.

As the sect's top true disciple, his own spirit stone supply was limited—daily cultivation consumed them.

Normally, one would channel True Qi to gradually absorb a spirit stone's energy, refining it to enhance cultivation.

Who ate spirit stones like snacks?

"You seem convinced there's more to this case—that I'm not the real culprit?" Li Zhengjing tossed a few more stones into his mouth. "We've only met a few times, yet you trust me so much."

"When we first met, you were at the Internal Qi Realm. Now, you're among the upper echelons of the True Qi Realm," Lu Huaiyuan sighed. "Such talent surpasses mine. Without this incident, you'd have become a true disciple, perhaps even contended for the Dao Child position—maybe even the Sect Master's throne. How did it come to this?"

He drew his sword, pointing it at Li Zhengjing. "The higher-ups are furious. The Sect Master himself ordered your capture. This is sect territory. The manpower and scale of this hunt dwarf the operation against the Venom King tenfold. You can't escape. Surrender."

"You want to capture me, but I'd like to test the skills of the sect's top true disciple," Li Zhengjing chuckled, swallowing the remaining stones in his bag before drawing his Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber.

Lu Huaiyuan said no more. He stepped forward, True Qi erupting beneath his feet as his sword swept out.

Li Zhengjing leaped into the air. The tree he'd leaned against shattered instantly, splinters flying.

Lu Huaiyuan closed the distance in a flash, his sword gleaming again.

Li Zhengjing's foot acupoints released True Qi like dragons, propelling him higher. He slashed downward!

True Qi coiled around his blade, unleashing a thunderous roar!

A bolt of lightning descended from the sky, infused with sword intent!

"What?!"

Lu Huaiyuan, about to block, felt a sudden dread and dodged.

The lightning struck the ground.

BOOM!

The earth exploded into a crater, scorched soil smoking, residual power lingering.

Lu Huaiyuan's face paled. "How is he so strong?"

Though he knew of Li Zhengjing's feats at the spirit mine, logic suggested Li Zhengjing had only recently broken through to the True Qi Realm—at most, opening nine acupoints.

Yet this saber strike's power exceeded that of nine acupoints!

"Break!"

On his way back to find Lu Huaiyuan, Li Zhengjing had consumed over thirty grade spirit stones.

He continuously circulated the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, converting the stones' spiritual energy into visceral Internal Qi.

Then, he used the Feather Transformation Dragon Ascension Immortal Art to refine that Internal Qi into True Qi!

Initially breaking through to the True Qi Realm, he had opened thirteen acupoints. Now, he had surpassed twenty!

But he dared not be careless. Lu Huaiyuan had opened all 365 acupoints, achieving Great Perfection!

Though Li Zhengjing cultivated the sect's supreme techniques, so did Lu Huaiyuan.

His advantages were the Great Yan Void-Piercing Myriad Transformations Sword Qi—revered as the world's supreme sword art—and the Divine Fire ability in his left arm.

Lu Huaiyuan's advantage, however, was his vastly superior True Qi reserves—over ten times Li Zhengjing's—and his Great Perfection cultivation, which could overwhelm Li Zhengjing's combat prowess.

Their blades clashed again.

This time, Li Zhengjing was at a disadvantage.

"At equal cultivation, he's no match for you," Yuan Zhengfeng's voice came from the Phoenix Tree Case. "But his cultivation is too high—his True Qi reserves are over ten times yours."

"Master might not lose, right?" Hanging Bird interjected. "At Fengdu Mountain, Master even fought a Human Immortal!"

"Lu Huaiyuan has been famous for years, slaying demons and never losing. The sect's Human Immortal elders have sparred with him!" Yuan Zhengfeng sighed. "In terms of combat experience, Young Friend Zhengjing, with less than a year of training, can't match him."

"But Master has the Great Yan Void-Piercing Myriad Transformations Sword Qi!" Hanging Bird protested.

"Lu Huaiyuan's Feather Transformation Divine Sword is only slightly inferior," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "And his cultivation is higher."

"Master has my White Phoenix Divine Fire!" Hanging Bird insisted.

"Lu Huaiyuan's cultivation is higher," Yuan Zhengfeng repeated.

"Master has the Celestial Azure Dao Treasure and abundant spirit stones!" Hanging Bird pressed.

"Lu Huaiyuan's cultivation is higher," Yuan Zhengfeng said again.

"What's your point?" Hanging Bird snapped. "Why boost his morale and dampen ours?"

"In my view, this battle requires my Immortal-level power!" Yuan Zhengfeng's voice trembled with excitement. "His cultivation is too high. Only my Human Immortal power can let Young Friend Zhengjing surpass him. Use me, and victory is assured!"

"I see..." Five Elements Creation Tree muttered. "You lack a body but crave battle. You're itching to fight using our master's form!"

"Nonsense!" Yuan Zhengfeng retorted angrily.

"Second Brother, don't learn from your eldest brother," Five Elements Creation Tree consoled Broken Wave Gu. "Follow Father's example."

"You—!" Yuan Zhengfeng fumed, then fell silent. "Young Friend Zhengjing... seems to be winning? Was this how the Celestial Azure Dao Lord dominated the world?"

BOOM!

Li Zhengjing was sent flying by a sword strike, crashing into a boulder.

The rock shattered behind him!

He groaned, blood trickling from his lips, but his injuries healed instantly.

He charged forward, saber raised!

Lu Huaiyuan met him with his sword.

This time, both were forced back.

"Success!"

Li Zhengjing's eyes lit up.

He stuffed two more spirit stones into his mouth.

The Celestial Azure Dao Treasure released vitality, healing all his wounds and keeping his True Qi perpetually full.

Meanwhile, Lu Huaiyuan was exhausted.

Though his True Qi reserves dwarfed Li Zhengjing's, he couldn't defeat him quickly.

Every injury Li Zhengjing sustained healed in moments.

They traded blows, wearing each other down.

Li Zhengjing even adopted a tactic of trading injuries.

Initially unfazed, Lu Huaiyuan found his True Qi half-depleted, yet Li Zhengjing showed no signs of fatigue.

"How is his True Qi inexhaustible? Is it because he's consuming spirit stones?"

Lu Huaiyuan was stunned. "Spirit stones must be refined gradually with True Qi. Who can refine them instantly by eating them? Even with many stones, no one can refine them mid-battle!"

He couldn't know that Li Zhengjing didn't need to refine the stones—the golden page converted them into spiritual energy the moment they entered his mouth.

As the battle wore on, Lu Huaiyuan's overwhelming advantage in cultivation was gradually neutralized.

"My turn!"

Li Zhengjing advanced through a sword strike.

The blade pierced his shoulder, drawing blood, but he pressed on, slashing with his saber!

Thunder erupted from the blade.

Lu Huaiyuan blocked with his sword.

But Li Zhengjing struck again!

Lu Huaiyuan parried, but this blow was stronger.

A third slash followed.

Lu Huaiyuan's eyes flickered as he retreated.

The Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Saber Art was a saber technique of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.

Each strike's thunderous power lingered, merging with the next, amplifying its force.

By the fifth strike, its power tripled the first.

The best counter was to disrupt the sequence, preventing five consecutive strikes. Earlier, Lu Huaiyuan could have countered forcefully, but now he lacked the strength.

"Good! I can still block his fifth strike!"

Lu Huaiyuan endured all five thunderous slashes, his body numb, his expression shocked.

But what truly stunned him was Li Zhengjing's current strength and his inexplicable ability to heal instantly.

As the fifth strike passed, Lu Huaiyuan gathered his strength to counterattack.

But Li Zhengjing raised his left arm, unleashing Divine Fire!

Flames infused with sword intent erupted!

BOOM!

Lu Huaiyuan's gathered power met the blast head-on.

The fiery sword intent exploded.

Both figures were sent flying.

Silence fell over the battlefield.

Then, Li Zhengjing staggered to his feet, looking at Lu Huaiyuan thirty yards away.

His injuries healed as he stood.

But Lu Huaiyuan couldn't recover. He panted heavily, his eyes filled with defeat.

"You've been with the sect for less than a year?"

"Yes," Li Zhengjing nodded.

"I'm hailed as the sect's most outstanding disciple of this generation, with over thirty years of cultivation," Lu Huaiyuan sighed. "With your talent, in another year, your cultivation could rival mine, contending for Dao Child..."

"I doubt I can return," Li Zhengjing sheathed his saber.

"You're sparing me?" Lu Huaiyuan looked up.

"You lacked killing intent. Why should I kill you?" Li Zhengjing said coolly. "Don't feel too defeated. Today, I won by relying on my healing ability. It wasn't a fair victory."

"But you still won," Lu Huaiyuan sighed. "Earlier, I warned Junior Brother Zhou not to fight you alone, to signal for help. Yet I overestimated myself, thinking I could capture you. How shameful."

"It seems a peak True Qi expert can't handle me," Li Zhengjing turned to leave. "Either send multiple True Qi elders to surround me, or... bring a Human Immortal."

"..."

Lu Huaiyuan closed his eyes, murmuring to the sky, "After just a year of cultivation, it takes a Human Immortal to suppress him?"

Noises grew around them as people arrived from all directions.

He hadn't used his Gold Token to summon help, but the battle's commotion had drawn nearby sect members.

As they arrived, the scene left them aghast.

Sword energy lingered everywhere—cracked earth, shattered trees.

Thunder's aftermath left flames in the forest, scorched soil, and rising smoke.

Seeing the sect's top true disciple, Lu Huaiyuan, lying on the ground, disbelief filled their faces.

Lu Huaiyuan, at the peak of the True Qi Realm with Great Perfection, decades of cultivation—defeated by a youth who had trained for less than a year and reached the Internal Qi Realm barely two months ago?

"Report to the sect," Lu Huaiyuan said hoarsely. "Request a Human Immortal. He... is too strong."
