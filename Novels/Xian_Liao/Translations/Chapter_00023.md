# Chapter 23: Harvest

A manual and two pieces of silver were all Zhou Qing found on the monk. He glanced at the manual; it wasn't a Buddhist scripture but something more akin to a Daoist text, complete with illustrations. He planned to study it later, as he needed to deal with the body and its aftermath.

He couldn't leave the city at night, and during the day, there were too many prying eyes. He had already offended the Zhang family, and they might have informants watching him. It seemed he had to dispose of the body here.

The monk he killed was most likely sent by that young master Zhang.

"Could the Zhangs be so ruthless as to want me dead?" Zhou Qing wondered. He doubted it, but sending a monk was definitely meant to intimidate him.

When attempts to win him over failed, they resorted to coercion—the behavior of bandits and tyrants.

The Zhang family might appear respectable on the surface, but they must have done plenty of such things behind the scenes to accumulate such wealth. Jiangzhou hadn't produced a single *juren* in the provincial exams for years. Could that be related to the Zhang family, in addition to Jiangzhou's generally low academic standards?

Zhou Qing hadn't even entered the academy yet and didn't know much about the world of scholars.

He wondered if any of the scholars who had entered the academy before him, those with talents like his, had encountered trouble during the provincial exams.

The provincial exam was held every three years. Each time, from the tens of thousands of students in each circuit, less than thirty were selected. Thus, in the past decade, fewer than ninety *juren* had been produced. Changzhou, as the seat of the circuit, was known for its scholarly atmosphere and always took at least ten spots in each exam. Some wealthy families from other prefectures even transferred their sons' household registrations to Changzhou to study.

With so few *juren*, they were incredibly rare in each prefecture.

Even though Jiangzhou's academic level was consistently low, the fact that it hadn't produced a single *juren* in the past decade made Zhou Qing suspicious.

He grew increasingly wary of the Zhang family.

He didn't regret refusing the young master. Agreeing would have meant becoming their dog, and he wasn't that foolish.

No matter how arrogant the Zhangs were, they couldn't openly do anything to him. They could only resort to underhanded tricks like tonight.

He had to continue improving his martial skills to ensure his safety.

Zhou Qing's sense of crisis deepened.

Whether he wanted to earn money or improve his social standing, he would inevitably face struggles and conflicts. He needed to be strong himself.

Without sufficient strength, his ideas would be difficult to implement. He thought of the hand crossbow Miss Lin had given him—a concealed and accurate weapon with deadly power within thirty paces.

If they pushed him too far…

"Hmph."

Zhou Qing snorted and sighed. He still lacked reliable subordinates. He wasn't even sure he could trust Butcher Hu to help bury the body.

It wasn't that he didn't trust him, but the fewer people who knew about a murder, the better.

He first practiced the Tiger Form to generate heat and applied the external medicine to try to heal his left shoulder. After one round, his left shoulder felt a little better.

But the injury was clearly severe and would take at least two days to fully recover.

Fortunately, he had stabilized the injury and could proceed with the cleanup.

Zhou Qing first smashed the monk's face beyond recognition with a stone. Then, he used a shovel to dig a pit next to the mulberry tree. When he got tired, he mixed honey with the black-boned chicken pills and drank water to replenish his strength.

He worked tirelessly for half an hour, finally creating a large pit.

Zhou Qing buried the monk and then found a lot of ashes and charcoal in the kitchen to mask the smell of the corpse.

Afterward, Zhou Qing compacted the soil.

He chose to bury the body next to the large mulberry tree for a reason. He had previously used medicinal dregs to water the tree's roots and found that the tree quickly absorbed them.

Zhou Qing had always suspected that the mulberry tree was somewhat strange and might be able to digest the corpse, which would save him a lot of trouble.

As for whether it would turn the tree into some terrible tree demon, Zhou Qing didn't think a single corpse would be enough. Still, he had to take some risks.

Besides, he believed that the aura of his Tiger Form practice would have some deterrent effect on the mulberry tree.

The tiger was the king of the mountains, in charge of all the plants, trees, and animals, like a mountain god.

It should have some control over the mulberry tree.

Moreover, he felt that if there were truly demons, they would be easier to deal with than humans. Otherwise, the world would already be ruled by demons.

"Mulberry Tree Brother, you have helped me a lot in the past. Today, I offer you blood as a reward." He bowed to the mulberry tree and added, "Enjoy the offering."

He was being very polite.

*Boom!*

A bolt of lightning flashed in the dark clouds.

Summer thunderstorms came quickly.

"Good."

Zhou Qing wasn't afraid; he was slightly pleased. The heavy rain would wash away any traces of the monk, and it wouldn't be so hot after the rain.

"It was so hot yesterday; I knew it would rain."

Zhou Qing returned to the house, and Angri Chicken went back to the woodshed.

The rooster was also a little frightened but stayed with Zhou Qing until the thunder started, then hid in the woodshed.

Fear of thunder was an instinct for most living beings.

Zhou Qing returned to his room. Because he had eaten black-boned chicken pills and a lot of honey, and drank several large bowls of cold water, he didn't feel hungry despite doing a lot of physical labor.

After washing up, he lay in bed, listening to the pouring rain outside, tossing and turning, unable to sleep.

Whether it was killing or disposing of the body, he had tried to remain calm. But now that everything was done and he had relaxed, he felt strange.

He had killed someone.

And it definitely wouldn't be the last time.

Zhou Qing felt like a gate had opened in his heart, and some beast was about to be released.

Since transmigrating, he had practiced the Tiger Form the most. He had imitated its essence the best, far better than the Deer Form.

Black Tiger Steals Heart had also quickly reached the level of proficiency after he had mastered the Tiger Form.

He had used Black Tiger Steals Heart to kill the monk.

The beast in his heart was a tiger.

Thinking of the monk made him think of the effeminate young master Zhang. Zhou Qing felt a surge of killing intent. Only by getting rid of that young master could he sleep peacefully in the future.

The tiger had no intention of harming people, but people had the intention of harming the tiger!

"Kill!"

The more Zhou Qing thought about it, the more violent he felt.

"This person has already made me his mortal enemy with this move. Enmity must be resolved, but it's not something that can be solved easily."

Zhou Qing suppressed the killing intent in his heart and got up to light the oil lamp.

Since he couldn't sleep and the killing intent was difficult to suppress, he might as well do something else to distract himself.

Under the oil lamp, a manual lay before him. The text was familiar; it was the ancient script that Butcher Hu had asked him about.

"Clear Wind Scripture."

Zhou Qing read through it, deciphering the text.

"It's actually a martial skill."

When he saw the name, he thought it was some kind of Daoist talisman technique, but it turned out to be a martial arts manual.

The Clear Wind Scripture had thirteen forms, and its effect was to lighten the body.

To be precise, it was a superb movement technique, inherited from Daoism.

It was strange that it appeared on a monk.

"If it was the monk's sect's inheritance, he would have memorized the manual long ago and wouldn't need to carry it with him. Unless he had only recently obtained it?" Zhou Qing concluded.

He then felt a throbbing pain in his left shoulder.

It was where the monk had scratched him before he died.

Five deep finger marks had dug into his flesh, and even his shoulder blade was injured.

He estimated that with the help of the Five Animal Forms, it would take two days to heal. Without the heat generated by cultivation, it would take several months, and he didn't know if there would be any aftereffects.

Fortunately, he had acted decisively and without hesitation.

If he had given the monk time to react, Zhou Qing's sneak attack would have failed.

Zhou Qing felt a sense of luck.

In this kind of encounter where he didn't know the opponent's cards, skills, and strength, winning was truly a matter of striking first.

If he had asked about the opponent's background, alerting him, the outcome would likely have been different.

"I wonder which sect that monk came from. His finger strength was so powerful."

Zhou Qing had immediately used Finger Flicking Skill to strike the opponent's head, then jumped out the window and struck the opponent's head with a Black Tiger Steals Heart, followed by continuous strikes.

Even so, the monk's instinctive reaction had still managed to scratch Zhou Qing's left shoulder.

If the monk hadn't been repeatedly struck in the head, preventing him from effectively retaliating, Zhou Qing, even if he had won, would have suffered more than just a shoulder injury.

Looking back, his choices had been almost optimal.

"The Zhang family can command monks, which means there are many martial artists stronger than monks. The Zhang family is at most a local tyrant in Jiangzhou, running rampant here, but in the grand scheme of things, they are nothing." Zhou Qing had a clearer understanding of the world's martial power than before.

"Practicing martial arts is not my true pursuit. I still hope that true cultivators exist," Zhou Qing shook his head.

He continued to read the Clear Wind Scripture, memorizing the contents and studying the illustrations to understand it.

The next day, Zhou Qing began to formally practice the Clear Wind Scripture.

This lightness skill would be very useful when combined with the Deer Form.

If he encountered any danger, his chances of escaping would be greatly increased.

As long as he could run faster than his opponent, even if they were stronger, they wouldn't be able to catch him.

Of course, he could also use it to engage in guerrilla warfare, wearing down his opponent's mentality and looking for an opportunity to strike a fatal blow.

Zhou Qing had experience analyzing the ancient script for Butcher Hu, and with a complete manual and illustrations, he understood the contents reasonably well. If he didn't understand something, he could get feedback from practice.

However, compared to the content Butcher Hu had asked him to analyze, the Clear Wind Scripture was clearly much simpler.

He stayed in the courtyard, practicing the Clear Wind Scripture. He didn't pay any attention to the Zhang family.

Remaining still to counter movement was his best option for now.

If he really had to run, he had nowhere to go for the time being.

Zhou Qing completely focused his mind on practicing the thirteen forms of the Clear Wind Scripture, and time passed quickly. Before he knew it, half a month had passed, and everything was calm. The date for entering the state academy was also getting closer.

During this time, Zhou Qing dug up the burial pit next to the large mulberry tree and found that the monk's body had become a skeleton, with no bloodstains left. He was relieved and also somewhat surprised by the mulberry tree's strangeness.

Even so, he still occasionally practiced Finger Flicking Skill on the large mulberry tree.

After all, if he didn't practice, wouldn't it seem like he was afraid?

When it came to ghosts and monsters, he had to be fearless first. He still had the might of the tiger.

…

…

Five Animal Forms (Slight Understanding): Tiger Form (Proficient), Deer Form (Proficient), Bear Form (Slight Understanding), Bird Form (Slight Understanding), Ape Form (Slight Understanding)

Martial Skills: Black Tiger Steals Heart (Proficient); Finger Flicking Skill (Proficient); Clear Wind Scripture (Skilled).

Elementary Alchemy (Crude Understanding).

Literary Courage (Elementary).

Remaining Lifespan (Thirty-eight years).

For the past half month, he had spent most of his energy on the Clear Wind Scripture. Zhou Qing had finally raised this martial skill to the "Skilled" stage.

With a thought, he suddenly darted forward.

A breeze rose.

Zhou Qing almost left behind an afterimage as he arrived under the large mulberry tree.

This was the Clear Wind Scripture activated in conjunction with the Tiger Form.

Zhou Qing turned again, this time also darting forward, his body slightly hunched, his steps light and quiet. If he were running through the mountains and forests, he would easily be concealed.

This was the movement technique of the Clear Wind Scripture fused with the Deer Form.

Because Zhou Qing's Tiger Form and Deer Form had both reached the level of proficiency, it was easy to integrate them into the Clear Wind Scripture.

This was one of the benefits of reaching the level of proficiency.

Zhou Qing gave the two different movement techniques names.

Tiger Pounce and Deer Run.

In essence, they both belonged to the Clear Wind Scripture's movement technique.

Tiger Pounce was faster and more explosive, while Deer Run was more concealed and suitable for lurking.

"If I use Tiger Pounce to launch Black Tiger Steals Heart, anyone within five steps is within my attack range, and even if they are prepared, most people would probably have difficulty reacting."

Zhou Qing was beginning to understand what it meant to be able to face an entire nation within arm's reach.

If he could raise the Clear Wind Scripture to the level of proficiency…

Within five steps, no matter how powerful young master Zhang's forces were, he would be nothing more than a fish on his chopping board, and he could take his life at any time.

No wonder powerful figures cleared obstacles before traveling, and ordinary people couldn't get close.

Those who had mastered literary and martial arts sold themselves to the imperial family.

There must be those with extraordinary skills who sold themselves to powerful families.

Unless they were extraordinary, flesh and blood bodies, no matter how strong, always had weaknesses. There were too many places to scheme against them, from eating and drinking to excretion.

Moreover, with his current martial arts, if someone ambushed him with a hand crossbow from ten steps away, hitting a vital point, Zhou Qing would probably die on the spot.

In any case, the harvest was considerable.

Next, in addition to cultivation, he also had to take care of entering the state academy.

Entering the academy mainly involved participating in a ceremony and didn't require attending classes at the academy every day. However, entering the academy was mandatory; otherwise, he wouldn't be eligible to participate in the provincial exam.

If Miss Lin's information about a special imperial exam next year was true, Zhou Qing should indeed participate. If he obtained the title of *juren*, the threat from the Zhang family would immediately diminish.

Although things had been calm these days, this matter was like a thorn in his back. If it wasn't resolved, he would always feel uneasy.

During this dynasty, one could still participate in the imperial exam even while observing mourning, but one couldn't hold office.

For Zhou Qing, obtaining the title of *juren* was enough. He wasn't really interested in becoming an official. The officialdom was complex and dark, and it would delay his cultivation.

Having the title of *juren* was enough to help him have a stable environment for development before the world completely fell into chaos.

This time, it was just a business deal involving Five Spice Pills that had attracted the Zhang family. In the end, it was because his status wasn't high enough. A top scholar, apart from Magistrate Lu's appreciation, wasn't really worth much attention from the local gentry.

If the Lin family didn't have the problem of passing on their incense, they could have spent money to buy the title of *xiucai*, or at least donate to become a student of the Imperial Academy, which would allow them to participate in the provincial exam. At the very least, they could easily enter the government as a minor official.

In fact, based on Zhou Qing's evaluation of Miss Lin, if she were a man, the Lin family would definitely rise to a higher level.

He felt sorry for Miss Lin, and then there was a knock on the door in the courtyard.

*Dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong!*

Six times in total.

Zhou Qing knew that it was Butcher Hu and opened the door.

He saw Butcher Hu's two apprentices carrying a stretcher. On it lay an injured person, none other than Butcher Hu.

Zhou Qing instantly understood the reason. A sentence flashed through his mind:

"The tree desires tranquility, but the wind will not cease."

A trace of killing intent rippled in his heart.
