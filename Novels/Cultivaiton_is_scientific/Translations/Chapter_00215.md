# Chapter 215: Divine Sense

Li Shiming sat cross-legged in his cave dwelling atop Sword-Holding Peak, the Nurturing Spirit Jade pressed against his forehead. Transforming a Foundation Establishment cultivator's spiritual sense into divine sense was no simple task, and the 'Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Technique' was precisely the secret mental method that allowed Foundation Establishment cultivators to prematurely master divine sense.

Within his soul, a strand of spiritual sense took form as a massive iron hammer, which then struck down upon itself. The impact sent tremors through his entire body. Since spiritual sense contained all five of his sensory functions, the intensity of this strike was no less severe than a direct attack on his soul.

Taking a deep breath, the 'Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Technique' generated a unique energy that began repairing the damaged spiritual sense. When the second hammer strike fell, his face had already turned pale. At this moment, the Nurturing Spirit Jade transmitted another surge of energy, combining with the technique's restorative power to fully restore the spiritual sense.

By the third and fourth strikes, sweat drenched his body, yet a look of excitement appeared on his face. In his first attempt at cultivating the 'Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Technique,' he had withstood thirty-six full-force hammer strikes—far more than he had anticipated. According to the technique's description, an average late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator could endure only about twenty such strikes on their first attempt, making thirty-six an exceptional result.

He paused the hammer strikes to recover his depleted mental energy using the technique. Once restored, he began a second round of hammering to temper his spiritual sense. From then on, he ceased all alchemy work and halted all other cultivation activities, focusing solely on the 'Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Technique' and his daily 'Purple Qi from the East' practice. Only his extraordinarily strong mental resilience allowed him to sustain such intensive training.

Thanks to the benefits of 'Purple Qi from the East,' his mental strength had surpassed that of most late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, accelerating his progress with the 'Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Technique.' Under this relentless tempering, his spiritual sense began undergoing a profound transformation.

"Nine hundred and ninety-nine!" Li Shiming counted the hammer strikes, his joy now outweighing the pain of each impact. He sensed his spiritual sense was on the verge of a qualitative leap, and his mental strength had further increased through the technique's cultivation.

"One thousand!" With the final hammer strike, his mind blanked momentarily, his soul briefly losing the ability to think. When he regained awareness, he felt an unmistakable change—his cognitive speed had increased at least fivefold.

It was as if his brain's processing power had been upgraded, like replacing an old computer's CPU with a cutting-edge model. He even felt his body couldn't keep up with his mind's enhanced speed, as if his physical form was limiting his brain's potential. This likely stemmed from his soul having surpassed the Foundation Establishment stage while his body, though robust, remained bound by its limitations. Even the most advanced CPU required compatible hardware to function optimally—a fitting analogy for his current state.

Li Shiming had now glimpsed a sliver of what Golden Core cultivators experienced—a mind capable of processing vast amounts of information at incredible speeds. This enhancement even affected Li Yuanba, his doppelgänger in the Nether Sect, whose mental acuity also sharpened. The connection between them grew tighter, granting each greater autonomy in their thoughts and actions.

Testing his newly formed divine sense, Li Shiming extended it outward and immediately noticed its stark difference from spiritual sense. If spiritual sense was like a sensory tendril, divine sense was an expansive detection network. Spiritual sense typically manifested as a thin, elongated thread, whereas divine sense spread outward in a spherical web centered around his body.

When he focused divine sense internally, everything within its range became crystal clear. Its sensitivity far surpassed spiritual sense—akin to comparing a two-megapixel camera to a twenty-megapixel one. When condensed into a thread, divine sense proved dozens of times stronger than spiritual sense, capable of severing a Foundation Establishment cultivator's spiritual sense or even directly attacking their mind. However, without specialized divine sense attack techniques, recklessly assaulting another cultivator's consciousness was ill-advised. Countermeasures like protective treasures or mental defenses could backfire, damaging his own divine sense and soul—a risk few Golden Core cultivators took.

With divine sense mastered, Li Shiming no longer strictly needed Master Ma's 'Split Spirit Transformation Technique.' The 'Hundred Thoughts Thousand Returns Technique' he previously acquired was also a spirit-splitting method, though tailored for spiritual sense rather than divine sense. Still, adapting it himself might compromise its efficacy.

"Better to learn Master Ma's 'Split Spirit Transformation Technique'—it's a Golden Core-level method after all," he murmured to himself.

The 'Hundred Thoughts Thousand Returns Technique' was comparatively inferior, and his own modifications might diminish its effectiveness. Moreover, his agenda extended beyond spirit-splitting. After a year of nurturing, the Crimson Sun Spiritual Fire in his spiritual lake had grown substantially, and he had recently begun using it for alchemy. The flame's convenience was unparalleled, especially within his machine room space—no spirit charcoal needed, just replenishing its fire-attribute spiritual energy after each session. Given his ample spiritual reserves, sustaining it was trivial.

Exiting his cave, Li Shiming expanded his divine sense, perceiving the world anew. He could detect spiritual energy in the air, distinguish pollen and other particulates in floating dust, and even manipulate his flying sword with unprecedented precision. The Center Palace Sword, under divine sense control, moved with newfound agility and speed, as if powered by a superior drive.

Familiarizing himself with these enhancements, he soon arrived at Cauldron Peak. With unrestricted access—a privilege even Master Ma's other disciples lacked—he entered the main hall without announcement. This special treatment stemmed from his possession of spiritual fire, marking him as Master Ma's potential successor. Normally, Master Ma would bequeath his spiritual fire to a final disciple nearing his lifespan's end, but Li Shiming's innate flame offered alternative possibilities for the sect's future.

"Shiming, you've developed divine sense!" Master Ma's voice greeted him the moment he stepped inside. Freshly formed divine sense radiated unmistakably from Li Shiming, easily detectable by any Golden Core cultivator.

"Master, I'm ready to learn the 'Split Spirit Transformation Technique'!" Li Shiming exclaimed eagerly.

"Reign in your divine sense first," Master Ma chided with a wave. "If a Golden Core elder mistakes it for probing, even I won't be able to save you." Realizing his overexcitement, Li Shiming quickly complied. Divine sense, like spiritual sense, required discretion to avoid misunderstandings—its heightened sensitivity only increased the risks.

"Here's the 'Split Spirit Transformation Technique,' my notes on simultaneous cauldron alchemy, and nine spirit tool cauldrons. Everything's deducted from your mission rewards," Master Ma said, tossing him a storage pouch. Over the past year, Li Shiming's daily alchemy had amassed staggering contribution points. Standard sect missions required submitting eight portions of pills, with compensation varying by type. Producing five cauldrons daily—all yielding high-grade pills—his earnings dwarfed those of typical Foundation Establishment cultivators. No wonder Master Ma claimed alchemists prospered; skilled ones could accumulate wealth effortlessly. 

Li Shiming hadn't even bothered exploiting his past-life technological knowledge for profit—alchemy alone fulfilled all his cultivation needs. Thus, he didn't bat an eye at the deduction. Besides, Master Ma's alchemy insights were priceless, the kind countless alchemists would fight tooth and nail to obtain.

Retrieving the 'Split Spirit Transformation Technique,' Li Shiming scanned it with divine sense. His experience with the 'Hundred Thoughts Thousand Returns Technique'—a foundational version of this method—allowed him to grasp it within minutes. Daily dual-mindedness from managing his doppelgänger and Nine Palaces Sword Array had honed his spirit-splitting aptitude. He cautiously split his divine sense into ten strands—only one more than his sword array required—enabling independent control of ten flying swords simultaneously, provided he had sufficient spiritual energy.

Master Ma watched approvingly, immensely satisfied with this nominal disciple. If anything disappointed him, it was that Li Shiming remained only a nominal disciple. Next, Li Shiming reviewed Master Ma's simultaneous cauldron notes—mostly for reference, as his IBMz15 had already simulated the process extensively. Confident in handling ten cauldrons post-splitting, he relied on the supercomputer's analytical prowess to ensure flawless execution.

A year of relentless alchemy had made him proficient with all core Foundation Establishment-stage pill recipes, consistently producing high-grade results. "Master, I'll study these and take on more sect missions afterward," he said with a bow.

"How's your spiritual fire progressing?" Master Ma inquired. The concealment technique he'd taught Li Shiming now obscured the flame's status from his perception.

"I've been using the Crimson Sun Spiritual Fire for alchemy lately. It's reached mid-grade tier two," Li Shiming replied truthfully. Master Ma shook his head ruefully—teaching such a prodigy left little room for mentorship. In just a year, Li Shiming had neared the pinnacle of intermediate alchemy, his daily five-cauldron output granting him decades' worth of experience. His mental fortitude enabled this breakneck pace; ordinary alchemists exhausted themselves with a single cauldron, let alone five of the highest-tier intermediate pills.

Now that his spiritual fire had advanced, Li Shiming met the baseline requirements for senior alchemist promotion. "I've taught you little since you joined," Master Ma said solemnly. "Today, I formally pass down the 'Mount Shu Alchemy Canon.' May you soon ascend to senior alchemist. Follow me."

He led Li Shiming to another hall on Cauldron Peak, housing memorial tablets of the sect's past master alchemists. Receiving the canon symbolized inheriting their legacy—a privilege reserved only for spiritual fire wielders with master potential. After paying respects and swearing a soul oath, Li Shiming accepted the transmission.

Master Ma's urgency stemmed not just from Li Shiming's qualifications but also the sect's needs. His prolific output had stockpiled early Foundation Establishment pills, but mid-to-late stage varieties remained scarce. If Li Shiming could advance swiftly without compromising quality, he'd alleviate this critical shortage.

Departing with a golden jade slip in hand, Li Shiming carried the weight of Mount Shu's alchemical heritage—and its future.
