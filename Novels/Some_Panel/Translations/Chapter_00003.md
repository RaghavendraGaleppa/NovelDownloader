# Chapter 3: Plans, The Sea Island

Yang Ji shook his head, putting away the cultivation technique. He couldn't help but recall what Luo Xiong had once told him.

"With a lower-grade root bone, without the aid of pills, spiritual springs, and other cultivation resources, it's absolutely impossible to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm. This is a congenital limitation. Once your appointed time arrived, your lifespan exhausted, you would simply perish. From then on, longevity would become a dusty tale, the path of cultivation forever out of reach."

"Reflecting on it now," Yang Ji mused, rubbing his chin, a flicker in his eyes, "my nominal master’s words back then were clearly meant for me. He must have been displeased with the slow pace of my cultivation due to my lower-grade root bone, and couldn’t help but blurt out his true feelings. He was rather subtle; he didn't outright declare that a lower-grade root bone meant one was trash."

At this moment, looking at his two attributes: [Root Bone: Lower-Grade] and [Lifespan: 18/100].

After a moment of contemplation, he decisively stood up.

"No, the later stages of cultivation are progressively harder. I can feel that if I continue to cultivate arduously within this cave, it will be impossible to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before my lifespan runs out. Furthermore, I don't even possess a Foundation Establishment method yet. It seems I must go out and seek cultivation resources. It would be best to join a powerful sect."

"Before, my nominal master bore the burden for me, but from now on, I can only rely on myself."

With that, Yang Ji abandoned his plan of cultivating arduously within the cave. He put all useful items into his storage bag and walked out.

Following the light out of the cave, what met his eyes were three young maidens, each with a graceful figure, fair skin, and beautiful features. The moment they saw Yang Ji emerge, the three who were resting were startled. They quickly picked up the meal trays placed beside them, held them above their shoulders, and bowed, saying:

"S-Sir, you haven't eaten for many days!"

Although they had never seen Yang Ji before, calling him 'Sir' was certainly correct, given he emerged from the secret cave.

"These are? Servants responsible for their daily needs? Each one so beautiful. My nominal master certainly knows how to enjoy life. Looks like I won't need to burn a Dao companion for him anymore."

Looking at the three maidens whose delicate bodies trembled slightly, with "[Fear]" hovering above their heads, Yang Ji smiled, "You can all leave, go home. From now on, you are free."

"Ah~" The three maidens were startled, then abruptly looked up, the "[Fear]" hovering above their heads slowly transforming into "[Surprise]".

"S-Sir! Is it true?" They excitedly gazed at the young man they had never seen before, their eyes brimming with hope, as they tremblingly confirmed.

"My heart is set on eternal life; women are like passing winds to me. Go, be free," Yang Ji waved his hand.

"But, but!" The three seemed to have concerns, fearfully glancing towards the cave entrance.

"My master is in seclusion; he won't come out for ten or eight years. You can all leave," Yang Ji said.

"Thank you, Sir, thank you, Sir!" Hearing Yang Ji's words, the three maidens excitedly knelt down, kowtowing three times. Like Yang Ji, they had been abducted by Luo Xiong since childhood, and now they finally saw hope. Next to "[Surprise]", "[Profound Gratitude]" immediately appeared.

Yang Ji chuckled softly, and without waiting for them to look up, he activated his Lightness Art and soared into the sky.

"I ride the wind towards the heavens, pursuing the Great Dao towards eternal life!"

He stepped on the clear breeze, his heart filled with exhilaration, flying higher and higher, looking down upon the entire land. Only when he looked back did he realize that for the past eighteen years, he had been living on a desolate, uninhabited mountain peak. Here, mountain ranges undulated, peaks were hazy, the scenery was picturesque, and auspicious clouds swirled. It was, indeed, an unworldly pure land.

However, he had no time to admire it further. His immediate priority was to figure out where he was. After scanning his surroundings, Yang Ji continued to ascend. As he ascended into the clouds, the land below receded, gradually shrinking until the entire expanse came into view. He saw a boundless ocean, and the vast island lying beneath his feet. Yang Ji instantly understood. He was currently on a massive island, and below him were the mountain peaks at the island's edge. It seemed Luo Xiong had chosen his cave dwelling at the island's edge to avoid public scrutiny, so he could implement his cultivation-for-possession scheme. Perhaps there was also the factor of hiding from his enemies. But all that was in the past now.

From his high vantage point, Yang Ji also discerned the island's general topography. Numerous small towns were scattered across it, while a larger city-state was located in the central area of the island. Yang Ji pondered for a moment, then flew towards the central area. Along the way, he continuously used his Lightness Art to fly, constantly appreciating the beauty of the sea island. Beaches, bright sun, coconut trees, sea breeze—everything one would imagine in a sea region.

[You used Lightness Art to fly, continuously gaining insight. Your Lightness Art has become more proficient. Proficiency +1.]
[You continuously used Lightness Art to fly. Proficiency +1.]
[You continuously used Lightness Art to fly, your mind becoming clear and thoughts flowing smoothly, your comprehension deepened. You comprehended the true meaning of stepping on clear wind. Proficiency +1.]
[You continuously used Lightness Art to fly. Proficiency +1.]
[Lightness Art (Beginner): 6/10.]

After half a day of flying, his Lightness Art proficiency reached 6. It wouldn't be long before he reached [Mastery]. Yang Ji now understood: this Golden Finger ensured he wouldn't err, quantifying all his efforts. As long as he put in effort, there would be progress. This was simply terrifying.

Others trying to comprehend Lightness Art would scratch their heads and stumble, perhaps needing ten days to half a month just to grasp a little and become somewhat proficient. But Yang Ji was different. The path ahead was perfectly clear. He just needed to exert himself, and his lifespan would handle the rest. With such a Golden Finger at his disposal, even though his root bone was somewhat inferior, Yang Ji was destined to be exceptionally gifted, capable of competing with any genius under the heavens.

Yang Ji was in high spirits, as light as a swallow, and continued to fly forward.

Two days later, in the early morning, he finally arrived at the central region of the island. Ahead appeared a plain, and upon it stood an ancient, rustic city. A wisp of smoke, a few cock crows—the city before him began a brand new day. Yang Ji felt his mind relax and strode towards the city. The city gates were unguarded, and he walked straight in.

"High-grade magic tools forged from millennium-old sunken stone, come and take a look!"
"Black coral from the deep sea trench, capable of extending life and curing all ailments, come and take a look!"

Inside the city, people came and went, a bustling scene. Shops lined both sides of the street, orderly arranged. On the streets, numerous stalls were scattered, and the shouts of vendors were incessant. With a slight perception, Yang Ji discovered over a dozen cultivators. He inwardly sighed that he had come to the right place; where there were cultivators, there were cultivation resources. He curiously gazed at everything, finding it somewhat novel.

"Fellow Daoist, would you like some immortal tea?" An old man smiled invitingly at him.

"This tea looks quite good," Yang Ji glanced at the stall and casually remarked.

"This is called 'Immortal God Tea,' it naturally carries a rich, refreshing fragrance, capable of invigorating the mind and even boosting cultivation. Fellow Daoist, how about a jin?"

"No, no thank you." Yang Ji saw the four characters "[Black-hearted Merchant]" hovering above the old man's head and quickly waved his hand with a smile, walking away.

"Fellow Daoist, I have a piece of ore here that even a mid-grade magic tool can't cut through, and it's extraordinarily heavy. Come take a look."
[Deep Sea Sunken Stone, can be forged into a low-grade magic tool.]

Looking at the information floating above the ore, Yang Ji's heart stirred. He tentatively asked, "Fellow Daoist, how many spirit stones are you selling this ore for?"

"Three thousand spirit stones, and it's yours."

Yang Ji nodded subtly. It was his first time out in eighteen years, and he wasn't too familiar with the world's prices, so he wouldn't rashly make a move. Of course, the main reason was that he was penniless, not a single spirit stone to his name, rendering him unable to make a move even if he desired.

"Young brother, I have a seed here, from a dried-up spiritual spring on Nine Saints Island. Come take a look."
[Silver Spirit Fruit Seed, perfectly preserved. Has a 98% chance of growing into a Silver Spirit Tree. When it blossoms and bears fruit, each will be a high-grade spiritual fruit.]

Seeing the information prompt, Yang Ji's heart was also stirred. The seed was entirely silver, emitting a peculiar luster, appearing quite extraordinary.

"Brother, I have a Celestial Spirit Peach sapling here. It blossoms in three years, bears fruit in three years, and ripens in three years; its fruits are comparable to sacred medicine. Come take a look."
[Celestial Spirit Peach Sapling, perfectly preserved.]

"Fellow Daoist, high-grade Fire Spirit Fruit, care for some?"

Along the way, Yang Ji saw many strange and peculiar things: seeds, ores, spirit saplings, cocoons, residual artifacts, spirit liquids, and so on. These items were described in glowing terms by their sellers, each proclaiming them to be extraordinary. Although Yang Ji knew that most of them were likely exaggerated, there were still some genuine articles. He thought that if he could use the power of his Golden Finger to resell some rare items and earn some spirit stones, that would be great. But alas, without his first pot of gold, even a clever housewife cannot make a meal without rice!

Yang Ji shook his head, walked around the city, and finally stopped in front of the "most opulent" building in the entire city: the Myriad Treasures Pavilion.
