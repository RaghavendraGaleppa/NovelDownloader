# Chapter 57: The Art of the Heart

Qingmei looked up at Yang Can and suddenly recalled a previous conversation with him.

"Director Yang, you haven't touched the Zhang family's direct relatives because you're waiting for them to make a move?"

"Precisely!"

"But will they... actually make a move?"

"Zhang Dashao and Zhang Yunyi have never had a father-son relationship built on kindness and filial piety. If Zhang Yunyi lives, he threatens Zhang Dashao. But if he kills Zhang Yunyi, he has a chance to live. He will make a move."

"Is their relationship really that bad? Did Leopard Head tell you this?"

"No, Zhu Weipeng told me."

"Who is Zhu Weipeng?"

"He's a chef, a chef in Feng'an Fortress, and also Cheng Dakuan's brother-in-law."

"I see."

"As for that Zhang Xiaomi, he is Zhang Yunyi's uncle. In his early years, Zhang Xiaomi was just a wandering vagrant. He had no land and no house, living a precarious life. He only has his current house and fields, and a life of endless joy, thanks to Zhang Yunyi's help after he became successful. But in recent years, as Zhang Yunyi has grown older and had a house full of children and grandchildren, he hasn't cared for his uncle as much."

Yang Can said meaningfully, "In this world, there are some people who truly embody the saying: 'A peck of rice creates gratitude, but a bushel creates resentment.' When you can no longer endlessly satisfy his demands, he won't remember your kindness; he will only hate you to the bone."

"I understand. So, they... will definitely walk the path you've laid out for them, right?"

"Exactly!" Yang Can snapped his fingers. "I've dug the channel for them. How can the water not flow into it?"

"But, will Zhang Yunyi follow your arrangements?"

"Zhang Yunyi has always considered himself the patriarch of the Zhang family. He is arbitrary, overbearing, and strong-willed, but he also shoulders all the responsibilities of the Zhang family. The entire Zhang family is parasitic on him. He believes that everyone in the Zhang family is grateful to him. If he suddenly discovers that, in order to continue possessing all of this, the Zhang family members would not hesitate to kill him, what do you think Zhang Yunyi would think at that moment?"

Yang Can looked at Qingmei and smiled. "In this world, there is an emotion called 'deep love leads to deep hatred.' Extreme investment and devotion, once met with betrayal, will destroy more than just trust. At that time, a person's emotions will undergo an extreme transformation. He will doubt everything he has done in the past, everything he has given, and everything he has received... and as a result, he will completely deny his past self."

Yang Can tilted his head and thought for a moment, then smiled. "To describe this change of his with a simpler term, I call it... 'falling into darkness'!"

"Falling into darkness?"

"Yes. Of course, if the Zhang Manor Lord doesn't think of this layer, I will kindly help him, guiding him to successfully fall into darkness and transform from a cocoon into a butterfly."

What a terrifying... man!

The previous "Collapsing Brick Tower" was just about adding pressure layer by layer until the opponent's psychological defense was completely destroyed. That was still within the realm of psychology, but now he has ascended to the understanding and manipulation of human nature.

Little Qingmei raised her hand and rubbed her nose with the back of her hand, the corner of her mouth slightly curling up. This bad man, although he has no strength to bind a chicken, has almost completely bound my heart.

On the high granite base, Yang Can propped himself up with his hands and stood up straight.

"Shoot the signal arrow!"

The granary was circular, and the base extended out by more than two feet, allowing people to walk on it. At Yang Can's command, Leopard Head walked over from the base, drew his bow, and nocked an arrow, shooting it into the sky. The arrow vanished into the night sky, instantly invisible. But the ghostly, sharp whistling sound it made instantly echoed through the night sky.

In the darkness, many figures stood silently on the threshing ground. They were the three hundred personal troops gathered by Kang Zhengyang for orders. Everyone was from the same manor, and Kang Zhengyang couldn't guarantee that none of them had been bribed by Zhang Yunyi. So, after gathering them here, he didn't announce any orders; he just waited in the night, not even lighting a torch.

Suddenly, a piercing whistling arrow tore through the air. The two confidants beside Kang Zhengyang immediately lit their torches. The torches flared up, illuminating Kang Zhengyang's face. Kang Zhengyang rested his hand on his sword hilt and shouted sternly, "Director Yang is investigating the affairs of Feng'an Manor under the orders of the Clan Leader. Now, someone is acting like a cornered beast, intending to burn Director Yang, Lord Zhang, and all the stewards to death. You will now follow my orders! First and second squads, follow your squad leaders and control all the exits of the manor. Allow entry but forbid exit. Kill anyone who tries to force their way out!"

The squad leaders under his command were not as difficult to control as Leopard Head's subordinates. When Leopard Head was the guard commander, he was indeed glorious, but he was under the Clan Leader's watchful eye and severely restricted. In contrast, the personal troop leaders in the manor had to be given authority; otherwise, the purpose of setting them up would be lost. Therefore, the personal troop leaders held absolute power over the entire manor's troops. The few squad leaders under Kang Zhengyang were either his brothers or his relatives. At the very least, they were brothers who had followed him for many years, and Kang Zhengyang could command them as easily as moving his own arms.

"Third squad, follow me!" Kang Zhengyang drew his ring-pommel broadsword and shouted fiercely, "Follow me to Feng'an Fortress and control all the exits!"

When the signal arrow shot into the night sky, the hidden Suo family guards lying in ambush made their move. They ran out with panicked expressions, shouting as they ran, "Fire! Fire! Don't let the fire spread!"

This act made the martial arts instructors who had started the fire and then pretended to put it out feel a false sense of security: these people were here to rescue the fire. So they were completely unprepared. As a result, these Suo family guards were utterly unscrupulous. They rushed forward without a word and drew their blades to strike.

"Kill!"
"Slash!"

Sharp blades swung at the unprepared martial arts instructors. Blood splattered, and the instructors realized something was wrong. But by the time they慌忙ly fought back, more than a third of them had already been cut down.

"Kill! Kill! Kill!"

These Suo family guards were all assigned by the Suo family to Suo Chanzhi. The Suo family had hoped to use Suo Chanzhi, the eldest daughter-in-law, to infiltrate the Yu family. So the people assigned to her naturally weren't bad. These Suo family guards were of a higher skill level than the martial arts instructors of Feng'an Fortress. They had the advantage in numbers, the advantage in martial skill, and they had seized the initiative. How could the Zhang family's guards resist?

As the Suo family guards dealt lethal blows one after another, Leopard Head also led some people rushing to the scene and joined the battle. With the addition of this fresh force, the Suo family guards became even more imposing. They chopped down the more than ten Zhang family martial arts instructors like cutting melons and vegetables, quickly slaughtering them all. The martial arts instructors Zhang Yunyi had painstakingly trained were now reduced to just a handful.

Some had been killed by Qingmei on the way to Phoenix Manor. Now, another batch had been killed by Leopard Head and the others at the fire scene. The Zhang family members who had come to put out the fire saw the scene of flashing blades and sword shadows and were terrified. They didn't dare to flee, nor did they dare to fight; they could only stand there stiffly.

At this moment, Zhang Dashao came bustling over. He was originally a noisy and impulsive person, and now, because he was guilty, he acted even more aggressively. "Quick, put out the fire! Father! My father is still in the fire! Dad... my dear... huh?"

Zhang Dashao had deliberately not even put on his shoes. He wore a light inner garment, was barefoot, and had disheveled hair as he rushed over in a great hurry. His wailing, however, came to an abrupt halt when he saw a Suo family guard wiping blood off the bottom of his boot.

"What... what happened here?" Zhang Dashao asked, his expression changing. He felt something was wrong inexplicably. As he spoke, he slowly backed away, then suddenly turned around to leave.

A large hand suddenly reached out from the side and stopped Zhang Dashao. Leopard Head grinned. "Young Master Zhang, your father's life or death is still unknown. Where are you going?"

The great fire at the Zhang family had alarmed the entire Feng'an Manor. However, the villagers found it difficult to carry out a rescue because the Zhang family's manor was inaccessible at night. Moreover, many of them had come only because they had no choice; they had no intention of risking their lives for Lord Zhang. Not to mention that Kang Zhengyang had already sealed off Feng'an Fortress to prevent anyone from taking advantage of the chaos.

Fortunately, when the manor was built, fire prevention had been fully considered. The independent large courtyards were separated by high walls, which served to isolate the source of fire. By dawn, the guest house area in the left wing courtyard had already burned to the ground. Along with it, three granaries in the adjacent granary area had also been destroyed. Those three granaries were precisely the warehouses where Zhang Yunyi and the stewards were being held. The entire east wing guest house had been reduced to ashes. The ash on the ground looked white, but when the wind blew, it would reveal a faint red. Even up close, the temperature was still extremely high. It was difficult to persist for long in such harsh conditions even with a wet towel covering the mouth and nose. So, the Zhang family members could only stand outside this white expanse. Some wept, some wailed loudly, and some cursed loudly, but none dared to approach.

Zhang Xiaomi came trembling on a cane. He had seen the fire in Feng'an Manor from home and naturally thought the grand plan had succeeded. But now that dawn had broken, not one of his three grandsons had come back to report. The old man couldn't hold back any longer and came personally on a cane. At this time, Feng'an Fortress had been completely controlled by Yang Can's people. Kang Zhengyang had received Yang Can's notification, allowing the manor's people to enter and leave the fortress. So now, in front of the fire scene, there were not only the Zhang family members but also many villagers from Feng'an Manor.

"What's going on? Yunyi, is our Manor Lord alright?" Zhang Xiaomi hobbled over and immediately asked anxiously. His old eyes swept the scene and saw that three large granaries were missing from the storage area. He couldn't help but feel secretly delighted. It seemed the great deed had been accomplished. With so many lives sacrificed to the heavens, this disaster could finally be pacified.

Zhang Manor Lord's wives, concubines, and family members were in a state of panic. Seeing the eldest of the family arrive, they felt they had found their backbone and immediately gathered around him. At this time, Zhang Manor Lord, who had been successfully lured by Yang Can into revealing his inner demons and had already fallen into darkness, was also heading this way from the granary area...
