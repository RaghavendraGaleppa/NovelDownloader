# Chapter 184: Four Heavenly Manifestation Dragons

Bang!

At this moment, high above the firmament, amidst the boundless purple mist, an explosion seemed to occur, and crimson blood light shot forth. Soon after, a terrifying bloody hand descended from the sky, crushing many mountains. With a rumbling crash, the very earth began to sink.

"What is that?" someone asked in bewilderment, their face blank with uncertainty.

"This is the remains of a Dao Lord-level creature," Saint Demon said calmly. He could tell this was a partial remains of a Dao Lord-level being, likely a native creature of this world, tainted by the blood rain. The reason the Dao Lord of Abyss Tomb arrived so late was because he had encountered and been delayed by a bloody, ferocious beast of the Dao Lord level. He had slain it, and was now displaying it to assert his might.

"Remains of a Dao Lord!" someone uttered, trembling, recognizing it and feeling deep unease.

Boom! The sky exploded, tearing into pieces, and then another vast, boundless palm descended, striking the earth. Mountains shattered and collapsed. Everyone's hearts trembled once more, as if an ancient colossal elephant was stomping on their very souls.

At this moment, crimson mist shot forth again, dispersing large areas of purple fog. Faintly, one could see blood light splashing in the high sky, as if a crimson galaxy had been severed. Then, the Heavenly Kings felt as if they were suffocating, sensing an indescribable oppression. The sky was heavy and dark, as if something massive was about to fall.

It was... a colossal head, drenched in blood, like a collapsing starry sky, crashing down into the lower atmosphere, shaking heaven and earth. With a deafening crash, a distant mountain range sank, completely severed by the impact. Nearby peaks disintegrated along with it, many exploding, and smoke and dust billowed sky-high.

Half of the head was deeply embedded in the earth, blood gurgling out. The entire area was stained crimson by the blood: the fractured mountains, the sunken earth, and the successive collapsing peaks were all a deep, lurid red. It was an exceedingly grotesque head, as colossal as an ancient divine mountain, with only six blood-red pupils on its face. Four of them were already empty sockets, from which blood continuously gushed.

As the dust settled, everyone saw a figure standing atop the massive head. Though clad in a black robe, it couldn't conceal the radiating brilliant golden light, and stars seemed to revolve within their eyes. With the descent of this head, several weaker Heavenly Kings even spat out a mouthful of blood, injured by the accumulated might of the Dao Lord of Abyss Tomb.

The Dao Lord of Abyss Tomb swept his gaze around and bellowed, "All those unrelated, scram!"

His vital energy surged sky-high, and a sense of oppression echoed in the hearts of the Heavenly Kings. He was overwhelmingly powerful, carrying supreme might, intending to clear the area immediately. Some rogue cultivators felt their hearts turn cold. Knowing they possessed neither strength nor backing to contend with the Dao Lord of Abyss Tomb, they immediately turned and left.

Others, however, had flickering eyes, standing motionless in the void, hoping to profit from the chaos. The Arm-Reaching Golden Ape scratched its armpit, then sniffed it, making a disgusted face, but still didn't move its body. Moments later, only the supreme experts among the Heavenly Kings remained. They were either on the verge of becoming Dao Lords, or possessed extraordinary backgrounds and a few powerful treasures, giving them some confidence to try and seize opportunities amidst the chaos.

"Hmph, skulking around, get out here!" The Dao Lord of Abyss Tomb let out a cold snort, and a black beam of light shot out from beneath his black robe, striking a certain spot in the void.

Ripples appeared in the void, and four figures emerged. All four raised their palms, emitting runes that formed a unique combined attack technique, blocking the dark light. However, this also revealed their presence in the void.

"Could they be the four who opened this tomb?" Zhou Tian felt a surge of surprise and doubt. He had almost forgotten about those individuals. Although this world had been opened by them, they were no longer the protagonists.

"Indeed, it's them. These individuals are not simple," Saint Demon nodded, giving his assessment.

"Didn't you notice them hiding in the void?" Zhou Tian asked.

"I did. I could expose them, but there's no need," Saint Demon said calmly.

Zhou Tian: "..."

The Dao Lord of Abyss Tomb was also somewhat surprised. He hadn't expected these individuals to be able to block his attack, even if it was just a casual one. He grew angry, feeling his prestige had been damaged.

Boom! The void trembled as a hand reached out from beneath his black robe, pulling something out of thin air. A roaring sound filled the air, followed by earth-shattering tremors. A rumbling roar filled the air, for it was the Great Dao itself awakening, vibrating, and resonating. The divine sounds of the Great Dao were incessant. Before anyone could clearly see it, it was enveloped in chaos, and then it quaked violently once more. At this moment, the weapon glowed blindingly bright, and then amidst the resonating Dao sounds, a rectangular object formed before it, radiating terrifying power.

Abyss Tomb truly lived up to its name; even its weapons were so unique. Zhou Tian saw clearly that the weapon was actually a black stone tablet, engraved with mysterious runes. The stone tablet moved, appearing directly above the heads of the four figures, pressing down fiercely. The void shattered, unable to withstand such immense pressure.

The four figures were covered in runes, their expressions indiscernible, but their movements were swift. Each took out a small flag, which then grew larger, flapping in the wind. Earth, Wind, Water, and Fire were summoned and guided, forming a profound array. Runes circulated, surprisingly managing to temporarily block the black stone tablet.

"Lord of Abyss Tomb, although we four brothers are only Heavenly Kings, we have fortunately acquired some fortuitous encounters. I'm afraid it won't be easy for you to subdue us four anytime soon. We, the Four Heavenly Manifestation Dragons, still possess some capabilities. Do not let others benefit as the fisherman," one of the four spoke, his tone respectful, yet clearly conveying a veiled threat.

"They are the Four Heavenly Manifestation Dragons of the Supreme Academy!" Someone, recognizing them, immediately cried out in surprise.

"The Four Heavenly Manifestation Dragons of the Supreme Academy?" Zhou Tian's expression turned strange. "What kind of strange title is that?"

"So it's them. A new variable has appeared, and now there are more competitors for the world's origin," Saint Demon seemed to have heard of them and continued, "The Supreme Academy occupies the tenth spatial node and is among the strongest forces in the Star Realm, recruiting promising talents from various worlds. The Four Heavenly Manifestation Dragons were among the top students of that batch."

"But that 'Four Heavenly Manifestation Dragons' title is too weird, isn't it? Aren't top talents usually singular? What are these four? Top talents in a gang fight?" Zhou Tian was quite puzzled.

"They are quite special. They are quadruplets, and moreover, they possess the Four Extremes Holy Physique of Earth, Wind, Water, and Fire. They cultivate a unique technique, and their combined attack arts are extremely powerful. There were even rumors that they once trapped and killed a Dao Lord," Saint Demon explained.

"Quadruplets? Well, damn, that's truly... impressive," Zhou Tian expressed his admiration from a unique perspective.

The Dao Lord of Abyss Tomb clearly knew this eccentric title. His expression shifted, and he ultimately retracted his stone tablet. His face was extremely ugly; he had intended to assert his dominance with thunderous might, but instead, his face had been slapped, leaving him utterly displeased.
