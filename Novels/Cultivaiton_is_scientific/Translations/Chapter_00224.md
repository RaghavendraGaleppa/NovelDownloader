# Chapter 224: Pursuit  

After spending five days on the battlefield, Li Yuanba decided to return to the checkpoint. He needed to figure out how to meet with his true self, Li Shiming.  

Li Shiming had already been waiting on a mountain peak near the righteous faction's checkpoint for a day. His main purpose was to observe the battlefield and study the grand formation maintained by the righteous faction.  

This grand formation was jointly guarded by three righteous factions: the Shu Mountain Sect, the Thousand Illusions Sect, and the Thousand Leaves Temple. If Li Shiming were to directly enter the checkpoint, he would immediately be detained by the Golden Core elder of the Shu Mountain Sect guarding it.  

As a true disciple and alchemist, Li Shiming was a treasure to any major sect. There was no way they would allow him to take such risks.  

Moreover, this battle between Foundation Establishment cultivators was meant to resolve grievances between the Thousand Leaves Temple and the Netherworld Sect. It hadn’t yet escalated to involve the other two righteous factions.  

For the Shu Mountain Sect and the Thousand Illusions Sect to participate, the Thousand Leaves Temple would first have to extend an invitation.  

Thus, no matter how one looked at it, Li Shiming couldn’t enter the battlefield.  

He remained outside the checkpoint to study the grand formation. As a true disciple of the Shu Mountain Sect, the formation wouldn’t attack him. As long as he didn’t enter and trigger it, there would be no issues.  

He followed the defensive line until he found a weak point in the formation and attempted to identify its vulnerabilities.  

Such a grand formation couldn’t have been entirely constructed by formation masters or high-level formation experts. Typically, it would be designed by a formation master and then assembled by lower-level formation experts, with only the critical nodes handled by high-level experts or masters.  

The weak point he found was likely constructed by an intermediate-level formation expert and contained numerous errors.  

Of course, even with these minor flaws, the overall operation of the grand formation would mask them, making it difficult for even a formation master to exploit them.  

But Li Shiming was different. With the help of IBMz15, he could perform precise calculations to analyze how to exploit these vulnerabilities.  

After several hours of effort, he finally mastered the flaw and could pass through undetected.  

However, Li Shiming didn’t act immediately. He needed to coordinate with Li Yuanba. He couldn’t stay on the battlefield for long—just long enough to exchange supplies before returning.  

He also needed to cultivate the "Purple Qi Comes from the East" technique, so the meeting was scheduled for the next morning.  

---  

Li Yuanba returned to the checkpoint, first submitting the corpses he had collected for verification by the attendant in exchange for contribution points. He then headed to the exchange hall.  

There, he spent all his contribution points on formation knowledge. The Netherworld Sect’s formation system was largely based on yin-attribute spiritual energy, making it a unique inheritance.  

He even came across complete knowledge of the "Netherworld Ghost Formation," but such formations required third-grade materials to set up, which he currently couldn’t afford.  

Formations requiring third-grade materials were strictly controlled by all major sects.  

This restriction applied to all Golden Core cultivators because once such knowledge spread, formation masters would compete with Golden Core cultivators for the already scarce third-grade materials, exacerbating the shortage.  

This was a form of knowledge monopoly, one that all major sects—whether righteous or demonic—participated in.  

Li Yuanba had over ten thousand contribution points, all of which he exchanged for formation knowledge. Due to the variety, the knowledge was stored across fifteen jade slips.  

This was the only knowledge Li Shiming currently needed. Having already exchanged for a considerable amount of formation knowledge in the Shu Mountain Sect, Li Shiming’s understanding of formations was rapidly expanding. He felt that another breakthrough in his "Starlight Sea of Formations" was no longer a distant dream.  

Thus, Li Shiming sought all available formation knowledge to further enrich his understanding.  

Li Yuanba also exchanged some of his spoils for unique second-grade spiritual herbs from the Ten Thousand Mountains. Since the spiritual tools and artifacts of ordinary demonic cultivators and Buddhist monks were useless to him, he might as well trade them for herbs that could benefit Li Shiming’s alchemy.  

After completing these tasks, he left the checkpoint again.  

---  

Elder Lü watched from afar, but this time, he returned to his cave abode and retrieved a puppet. He infused it with a strand of spiritual energy and placed it in his temporary resting quarters.  

With this setup and an identity token in the puppet’s hand, both the Golden Core elders outside and the grand formation would assume he was still present.  

Taking a deep breath, Elder Lü suppressed his aura, rapidly dropping from Golden Core to late Foundation Establishment.  

He tapped several acupoints on his body, activating a secret technique that locked his aura at late Foundation Establishment, preventing detection by the Thousand Leaves Temple’s Arhats or the righteous faction’s Golden Core cultivators.  

Of course, if he exerted power beyond late Foundation Establishment, the technique would automatically deactivate.  

Normally, no Golden Core cultivator would do this, as their defenses would also drop to late Foundation Establishment, leaving them extremely vulnerable.  

If ambushed by a peer, they might not even have time to unleash their full strength before being killed.  

Elder Lü had originally planned to find an opportunity to encounter Li Yuanba. However, Li Yuanba never lingered at the checkpoint. He had only returned twice, each time just long enough to submit tasks and handle affairs before leaving immediately, giving Elder Lü no chance.  

Li Yuanba’s caution forced Elder Lü to take a risk. For the sake of a potential divine ability, Elder Lü deemed it worth it.  

He took out another identity token, this one belonging to a Foundation Establishment disciple of the sect.  

With this new identity, he boldly left the checkpoint and began tracking Li Yuanba’s trail.  

This was possible because he had left a mark on Li Yuanba during their previous encounter—a Golden Core technique that Li Yuanba couldn’t detect. Even after checking his body, Li Yuanba had found nothing amiss.  

Li Yuanba was now heading toward a predetermined meeting spot near the righteous faction’s defensive line.  

Meanwhile, Li Shiming had already passed through the grand formation and entered the edge of the battlefield, waiting for Li Yuanba.  

He was quite comfortable, having set up a formation with seventy-two formation flags to rest.  

---  

"How many Foundation Establishment cultivators has the Netherworld Sect deployed to the battlefield?" Arhat Zhikong asked solemnly.  

"About twelve hundred," Arhat Zhiming replied promptly.  

"Jue Tu’s condition is unstable. He hasn’t killed in too long. If we delay further, he may lose control. Let him loose on the battlefield," Arhat Zhikong said after a moment’s thought.  

"Let’s see how the Netherworld Sect recovers after losing twelve hundred Foundation Establishment cultivators in the next three hundred years," Arhat Zhiming said with a laugh.  

He had full confidence in Jue Tu. The latter’s path to enlightenment through slaughter—"Killing to Become Buddha"—would, upon achieving Arhat status, grant the Thousand Leaves Temple a powerful new Arhat. Once his cultivation reached a level comparable to Sword Elder’s, he might even rival Sword Elder in combat.  

These twelve hundred demonic Foundation Establishment cultivators would serve as the stepping stones for Jue Tu’s ascension to Arhat.  

Jue Tu’s uncontrollable bloodlust would stabilize once he reached the Arhat level.  

A century of effort by the Thousand Leaves Temple would thus be fully justified.  

Arhat Zhiming waved a hand toward the formation behind him. As it opened, a surge of killing intent, no longer suppressed, shot into the sky.  

"Amitabha," Arhat Zhikong intoned, his voice pressing down the killing intent.  

A figure emerged from the formation—a monk clad in black robes, standing two and a half meters tall.  

Such height was exceedingly rare in the cultivation world. While demonic cultivators could temporarily grow taller using secret techniques, a natural height of two and a half meters was almost unheard of.  

Unlike the robust physique typical of Thousand Leaves Temple monks, Jue Tu was gaunt, with sunken eyes, high cheekbones, and crimson irises.  

Were it not for his status as a half-step Arhat, one might mistake him for a demonic cultivator’s corpse puppet.  

His appearance bore a seventy percent resemblance to such puppets, making him seem more demonic than actual demonic cultivators.  

His overwhelming killing intent left no trace of the compassion or serenity expected of a Buddhist monk.  

"Go. This is your path to advancement. Kill a thousand peers to prove your enlightenment," Arhat Zhikong said, pointing toward the battlefield.  

"Elder, I can no longer restrain myself," Jue Tu rasped, his voice strained as if barely contained.  

After bowing with folded hands, he soared toward the battlefield.  

"Namo Amitabha, Namo Amitabha…" Jue Tu chanted the Rebirth Mantra. His killings were for the sake of all beings, for the sake of Buddha—this was his belief.  

As his chanting grew louder, his killing intent didn’t diminish but intensified instead.  

Like spiritual sense for other cultivators, killing intent was his means of perception. Unleashed, it covered an even wider range than spiritual sense.  

A squad of four demonic cultivators was scouting for monks when a chilling, indescribable sense of evil enveloped them.  

Ironically, demonic cultivators—the very source of evil in the cultivation world—found themselves terrified by this malevolence.  

Before they could react, the killing intent overwhelmed their minds and souls, freezing them in place.  

Jue Tu, resembling a demonic ghost, appeared. His towering form lunged at the four, his hands transforming into claws that tore them apart in a frenzy.  

Amid the blood and gore, the four died without understanding what had happened.  

Drenched in blood—something a half-step Arhat could easily avoid—Jue Tu reveled in the scent, his face twisted in ecstasy.  

"Kill!" he howled hoarsely.  

---  

On the Netherworld Sect’s side, a Golden Core elder detected the unrestrained aura on the battlefield.  

"A half-step Arhat! Damn it, why wasn’t there any intelligence about this?" the elder roared.  

He immediately alerted the other Golden Core elders. Soon, two more arrived.  

"Where’s Elder Lü?" the first elder asked, frowning.  

"In his cave abode. He didn’t respond to my message—probably in deep meditation," another replied.  

"How could Elder Lü choose now to seclude himself? The Thousand Leaves Temple has unleashed a half-step Arhat! If we don’t act, our Foundation Establishment disciples will suffer heavy casualties!" the first elder said urgently.  

The other two elders looked helpless. Both sides had four Golden Core cultivators or Arhats, making this a fair, mutually agreed-upon conflict.  

The righteous faction’s nearby checkpoint housed additional Golden Core cultivators from other sects, but they weren’t participating.  

If the Netherworld Sect’s Golden Core elders entered the battlefield, violating the rules, those righteous Golden Core cultivators would use it as an excuse to gang up and eliminate them.  

This was the righteous faction’s open scheme, forcing the Netherworld Sect to choose between saving their Foundation Establishment disciples or risking annihilation by deploying Golden Core elders.  

Either outcome benefited the Thousand Leaves Temple.  

"Order all disciples to retreat immediately!" the elder said helplessly, opting to save as many as possible.  

He knew that without entering the battlefield—and with no formation-based communication coverage there—he couldn’t notify every Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

The battlefield lay at the border between the Ten Thousand Mountains and the righteous faction’s territory, an area both sides deliberately left devoid of formations to prevent remote communication.  

Commands were swiftly issued, but it was still morning, and most demonic cultivators had already entered the battlefield after resting.  

"We can only hope the true disciples can suppress this half-step Arhat," the elder sighed.  

While half-step Arhats were formidable, they weren’t invincible. True disciples carried life-saving treasures like talismanic treasures, which could threaten a half-step Arhat.  

However, the elders didn’t know Jue Tu’s specifics. Had they known he was a half-step Arhat on the path of "Killing to Become Buddha," they wouldn’t have been so optimistic.  

Talismanic treasures and similar items required time to activate.  

Moreover, attacks with power equivalent to a fraction of a magic treasure’s might not even harm Jue Tu.  

Jue Tu wasn’t just slightly stronger than an ordinary half-step Arhat—he was arguably the pinnacle of Foundation Establishment combat power.  

This was why the Thousand Leaves Temple’s Arhats had such confidence in him.  

---  

Li Yuanba lacked the Golden Core elders’ keen perception. He continued swiftly toward the rendezvous point.  

Elder Lü, trailing him, also remained unaware of Jue Tu’s presence—not due to incompetence but because he had suppressed his cultivation to late Foundation Establishment to evade detection by both sides’ Golden Core cultivators.
