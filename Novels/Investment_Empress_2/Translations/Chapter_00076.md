# Chapter 76: Li Mo vs. Wang Hao (Part 1)

On the main peak of Qingyuan.

On the mountain path not far from the议事殿 (议事殿, Hall of Meetings).

"Young Master, Sect Master Shangguan has summoned us to the Hall of Meetings," the Helmsman said, bowing his head.

"Qingyuan Sect... so much has changed," the Blood-robed Young Master of the Red Whale Gang sighed as he gazed out at the misty Qingyuan mountain range.

"Young Master, what do you mean?" the Helmsman asked, slightly puzzled.

The Gang Master had only instructed him to show the utmost respect to this mysterious young master, without revealing much else.

He had naturally assumed the young master was either a scion of a powerful family in the Eastern Wasteland or a noble from another state.

From the young master's tone, it seemed he had been to Qingyuan Sect before?

"In every aspect," the Blood-robed Young Master replied, walking ahead with his hands behind his back. He seemed to be in a good mood today and was willing to say more. "What do you think of the current Red Whale Gang?"

"Our Red Whale Gang has countless disciples, our eyes and ears cover Ziyang Prefecture. Wherever the Red Whale Flag goes, we command the Jianghu. Naturally, we are thriving," the Helmsman said, unable to hide a hint of pride in his voice.

"Heh..." The Blood-robed Young Master made no comment and casually asked, "Then how does it compare to the current Qingyuan Sect?"

"Not far off," the Helmsman replied bluntly.

In terms of influence in the Jianghu, Qingyuan Sect couldn't even compare to the Red Whale Gang. However, after seeing the numerous talents at the Nine Peaks Tournament today, he gave the "not far off" evaluation. Otherwise, he would have said they were evenly matched.

"If I told you that the Qingyuan Sect of the past could crush the Red Whale Gang with a single finger, even from just one of its peaks?"

"That..." The Helmsman was greatly shocked.

He had heard of Qingyuan Sect's former glory, but he didn't think it was to that extent.

The Blood-robed Young Master didn't wait for an answer and pointed casually. "Look at these nine peaks of Qingyuan."

"Forging, Alchemy, Beast Taming, Cultivating scriptures and writing classics, Discipline, Commerce, Cultivation... they have everything."

"Tell me, is there any other sect in the world that is so comprehensive?"

The Helmsman fell into thought.

Sects in the world all have their own specializations.

Those who focus on alchemy are famous for it, those who focus on forging make their name that way; each has its own unique skill.

A sect like Qingyuan, which dabbles in various paths, is truly rare.

Was the young master pointing out the secret to Qingyuan Sect's enduring prosperity? But it didn't seem to be the case.

"We are honored by your presence. Please forgive us for not greeting you sooner," a tower-like giant said, cupping his fists in greeting. It was Futu.

Beside him stood the Prefecture Master of Ziyang and Elder Yin Huaxuan of the Precious Beast Peak.

"It is our Red Whale Gang's荣幸 (róngxìng, honor) to have几位 (jǐ wèi, several) people to greet us. How could you say you were remiss?" The Red Whale Gang Helmsman returned the gesture.

He was a bit flattered, but seeing the Prefecture Master there, he understood.

The group walked together toward the Hall of Meetings.

As soon as they entered, they saw that the members of various large and small sects were already gathered.

Shangguan Wencang sat high in the main seat, still dressed like an old farmer. He was puffing on his long-stemmed pipe, his gaze sweeping over everyone through the smoke, exuding a presence like a deep abyss or a towering mountain.

Once everyone had arrived, he spoke slowly: "You should all be familiar with the Unrestricted Trial of the Drizzle Tower."

"Not long ago, my sect's disciples descended the mountain for a mission and confiscated a 'Hall-front Swallow'."

As he spoke, an iron swallow landed on the long table with a crisp clatter.

Many people in the hall frowned.

Every Unrestricted Trial inevitably causes some chaos. Although it is an activity for the Drizzle Tower to select and train assassins, it always causes significant trouble. There are never a shortage of people who want to take advantage of the chaos.

"This is the matter I reported," the Prefecture Master stood up and said loudly. "The Prefecture City is the throat of the entire Prefecture; it cannot be in chaos. Therefore, I ask for your assistance."

Everyone nodded, willing to help, and then turned their gaze to the main seat.

Shangguan Wencang tapped his pipe, and said slowly, "My Qingyuan Sect will send a few direct disciples and one elder to assist."

"Isn't that... a bit too few people?" a man in a scholar's robe from Fenyu Lin spoke up. "Which disciples and which elder is Sect Master Shangguan planning to send?"

Shangguan Wencang glanced at him. "As for the disciples, we will choose the top few from the Nine Peaks Tournament. As for the elder..."

"Shang Wu has just volunteered."

*Hiss...*

A collective gasp of shock filled the room.

The Prefecture Master of Ziyang's expression froze.

Shang Wu was far more terrifying than the Unrestricted Trial itself.

...

In the afternoon, the Nine Peaks Tournament continued as scheduled.

Li Mo had run into Wang Hao in the cafeteria earlier. The details aren't worth mentioning; it was quite typical.

To put it simply:

"Ever seen a 'black hand'?"

"Don't let me meet you on the arena, or I'll rip that Chixiao Sword right off you!"

That was the gist of it.

Li Mo noticed that Wang Hao seemed to really want the Chixiao Sword, but the guy himself didn't seem to be a swordsman?

And guess what happened.

During the afternoon draw, the first pair of names were called out.

"Wang Hao, Inner Sect Disciple, versus Li Mo, Direct Disciple of the Qunyu Peak!"

Qian Bufan read from the two waist tokens, his voice unusually loud.

Wang Hao was one of the top eight who was closest to the level of past Nine Peaks Tournament champions. His cultivation was also one of the highest in the tournament.

Most disciples at the Divine Observation Realm had long since aged out of the competition.

Not to mention the Divine Observation Realm, even the Profound Core Realm was extremely rare in the tournament.

"Heh..." Wang Hao landed on the arena with a thunderous boom, the aura of a Jade Liquid Inner Qi cultivator surging without restraint, his arrogance soaring.

He looked at Li Mo with icy eyes, his fists cracking audibly.

Opposite him, Li Mo also stepped onto the stage.

The atmosphere in the entire arena grew slightly heated.

Seeing Wang Hao's expression, he looked like he wanted to devour Li Mo whole.

In this situation, connections wouldn't help.

The Li Mo, who had his opponents forfeit three times in a row, would have to fight this round.

Moreover, from the outside perspective:

Wang Hao was at the Jade Liquid Inner Qi Realm.

Li Mo was only at the Blood Qi Realm.

The gap in their realms was a bit too large.

On the high platform, the elders also lowered their gaze, pondering slightly.

They didn't doubt Li Mo's combat prowess, but Wang Hao was a full generation older than Li Mo. It was a bit like bullying a child.

"This won't be easy to fight," one said.

"If Ying Bing used her astonishing bloodline, she could fight a Jade Liquid Inner Qi cultivator with Blood Qi Perfection."

As the elders were discussing, Shang Wu's gaze fell on Li Mo. She hadn't paid attention to her own disciple's progress for a long time.

But she had an inexplicable, indescribable confidence, a feeling that...

Her precious disciple had a huge advantage?

"Go for it, Senior Brother Li! You're the best, Senior Brother Li!" Xiao Qin shouted loudly.

Beside him, Lin Jiang and Murong Xiao felt a bit embarrassed. Xiao Qin's shout had made the three of them the center of attention.

Xiao Qin turned his head and asked, "Why aren't you guys cheering?"

"Brother Li will definitely win, so... there's no need for us to cheer, right?" Lin Jiang whispered.

"It's too eye-catching," Murong Xiao said, wishing he could find a hole to crawl into.

"But if we don't shout, how will everyone know we're not in on a fixed match?" Xiao Qin's words were an eye-opener.

The two leaned back slightly, a bolt of lightning flashing through their minds.

And so...

"Brother Li is mighty!"
"Brother Li will win!"

When the three of them shouted together, it didn't seem so embarrassing anymore.
