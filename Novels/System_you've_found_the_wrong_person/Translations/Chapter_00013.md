# Chapter 13: My Path to Enlightenment Relies Entirely on My Enemies' Praise!

The dead of night.  

Flames roared toward the sky.  

The violently burning fire resembled monstrous beasts, their claws bared and fangs gnashing as they raged and howled.  

Chaotic noises erupted incessantly.  

The mountain village had descended into complete disorder, its former peace shattered.  

Dou Changsheng observed the scene with cold detachment. At first, some villagers had attempted to extinguish the flames, but soon, all efforts ceased. The fire spread unchecked, rapidly growing into an inferno that devoured everything in its path. The scorching heat radiated outward in waves.  

Wave after wave of blistering air lashed against Dou Changsheng's face. Thick black smoke billowed upward, forming towering pillars that blotted out the sky, transforming the village into a hellish abyss brimming with demonic energy.  

The cacophony of screams and wails turned the scene into a living nightmare.  

The sheer scale of the disaster left Dou Changsheng dumbfounded.  

He had only set a few fires, expecting them to be quickly extinguished. His plan had been to divert the villagers' attention, buying Tang He enough time to act.  

Yet now, the flames had spread uncontrollably, devouring the entire village like a ravenous dragon intent on consuming heaven and earth.  

A dreadful thought struck him—what if the Black Eagle Sovereign didn’t die at the hands of his enemies but instead perished in the very fire Dou Changsheng had set?  

The flames seemed almost divinely fueled. Amid the chaos, the distant shouts were barely discernible. As the fire surged toward him, Dou Changsheng had no choice but to retreat step by step.  

From a distance, he watched the burning village, his heart pounding with anxiety.  

*I wonder if the Millennium Earth Pearl is fireproof.*  

*Please, don’t let anything happen to it—*  

*No, no, I mean, don’t let anything happen to the Black Eagle Sovereign!*  

Time crawled by. The towering inferno illuminated the surroundings as if it were daylight, its fury only growing stronger. The fire had swallowed the entire village, roaring defiantly at the night sky as if challenging the heavens themselves.  

Then, suddenly—  

Dou Changsheng saw the flames twist violently. A void appeared within the fire, like a black hole devouring everything in its path. The flames receded, revealing a scorched clearing.  

And from within, several figures emerged.  

Dou Changsheng squinted into the distance—then cursed under his breath.  

His cursed luck had struck again.  

He let out a bitter laugh. *Of course the fire spread so perfectly—nothing good ever happens to me. Now the consequences are here.*  

Among the figures, he recognized one—Feng Zhongyi. The others were unfamiliar.  

But given that Feng Zhongyi, a Xiantian-level martial artist, stood off to the side like a mere underling, the situation was clear—the man at the center was the True Realm Xiantian expert Tang He had warned him about.  

---

### **The Three Realms of Xiantian**  

The first realm—cultivating one Qi.  
The second—two Qi.  
Only after mastering all five Qi and achieving the "Five Qi Converging to Origin" could one reach the **True Realm**.  

The man at the center was of average height, lean but wiry. One of his sleeves hung empty—he had lost an arm. His high nose bridge and square jaw were accentuated by eerie tattoos on his cheeks, resembling clusters of compound eyes.  

His grotesque appearance made him look like a demon clawing its way out of hell.  

A man like this was clearly not someone to be trifled with.  

If possible, Dou Changsheng would have avoided confrontation entirely.  

But fate had other plans. Despite choosing a secluded spot to observe the village, he had somehow stumbled upon the enemy’s retreat path.  

*Just my damn luck.*  

There was no hiding now—the raging fire had turned the night into day for miles around. Even if he lay flat on the ground, his silhouette would be unmistakable.  

*Run?*  

That was his first instinct when he saw the figures emerge from the flames.  

But the thought vanished as quickly as it came.  

Feng Zhongyi was a master of lightness techniques. Dou Changsheng, on the other hand, had never learned such skills. Even if he bolted now, he’d only be humiliating himself.  

The moment he showed weakness, Feng Zhongyi would seize the opportunity. In a drawn-out fight, Dou Changsheng’s limited repertoire—essentially just one sword technique—would inevitably expose his flaws, leading to his demise.  

And that wasn’t even considering the fact that Feng Zhongyi wasn’t alone. He had allies—including a True Realm Xiantian expert.  

*Can’t run. Can’t fight.*  

*What a damn predicament.*  

What should have been a simple arson mission had spiraled into a life-or-death crisis.  

Dou Changsheng’s heart sank.  

If this were the "future" Dou Changsheng, he would have effortlessly rescued the Black Eagle Sovereign and slipped past the enemy unnoticed.  

But now, his only option was to stand his ground and react.  

Recalling his recent encounters, Dou Changsheng steadied himself.  

Since leaving Jun County, he had:  
- Killed Wang Xiong with a single sword strike.  
- Crushed a hundred cavalrymen head-on.  
- Slayed the Earth Walker with another decisive blow.  
- Frightened Feng Zhongyi into retreating.  
- And intimidated Ai Haike with a mere shout.  

Every battle had been swift, decisive, and overwhelmingly one-sided.  

Feng Zhongyi had retreated last time because he was afraid.  

Ai Haike had been fooled into believing Dou Changsheng was a true master—partly because of his terrifying reputation, but also because the name "Xiangzhou Wang Clan" carried immense weight.  

His recent experiences—especially the moment in the forest where a single missed sword strike had still cowed Ai Haike—had sharpened Dou Changsheng’s acting skills to new heights.

### **"If Failure Means Death, Even the Weakest Will Fight Like Beasts."**  

Dou Changsheng clasped his hands behind his back, straightened his posture, and lifted his chin slightly, gazing just above the enemy’s head.  

But before he could fully assume the demeanor of a peerless expert, a startled cry echoed from the distance:  

*"We deliberately took a detour, yet we were still discovered and intercepted!"*  

*"This must be the work of a Yin God—able to monitor all movements, where not even a blade of grass escapes notice!"*  

Feng Zhongyi’s voice was urgent. He halted abruptly, tugging at Long Ying’s empty sleeve as he whispered, *"That man is a direct descendant of the Xiangzhou Wang Clan!"*  

*"How could the Wang Clan dare to let such a prodigy participate in the Northern Rebellion without fear of losing him?"*  

*"Now I understand—the Wang Clan’s movements are being watched, so they can’t act openly. But after centuries of influence, who knows how many allies they’ve cultivated in secret?"*  

*"They could easily have a Pure Yin Grandmaster shadowing him in secret!"*  

*"No matter how much trouble this Wang heir stirs up, he’ll always have an escape route."*  

*"A Xiantian warrior under twenty—no, a True Realm expert who’s mastered the Five Qi!"*  

*"With talent like that, he could compete with the Four Nations’ elites for a spot in the top ten of the Human Rankings!"*  

*"He’s destined for the Earth Rankings—perhaps even the Heavenly Rankings!"*  

*"We… we’re nothing but whetstones for his tempering!"*  

*"How tragic!"*
