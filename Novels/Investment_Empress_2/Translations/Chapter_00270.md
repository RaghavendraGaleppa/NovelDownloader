# Chapter 270: Waiting for Them to Injure Each Other

In the Water Clan’s side hall within the Suspended Temple, the clam clan opened their shells, the luminous pearls casting a soft glow over the rippling river surface. The river was dotted with duckweed, each bearing a variety of dishes in a dazzling display, though it was unclear who had prepared them. The Water Clan was holding a flowing banquet.

When Li Mo arrived, the other demons were already soaking in the water, dining while discussing the matter of the Heavenly Jade.

Tianjiao Xiao Li was a bit curious and reached out to pick up a slice of sashimi.

"Boss Mo, do you eat without washing your claws?"

As a civilized蛟 (Jiao), Wu Dameng always washed his claws before eating.

"There's no need for that."

Li Mo grabbed the slice of sashimi and ate it instantly.

The taste was quite excellent—fresh, tender, and smooth, melting in the mouth. It must be Silver Scale Fish. Even the Silver Scale Clan would praise it.

Hmm...

Li Mo looked at the Silver Scale Fish Demon nearby who was eating voraciously. He thought to himself, *Does this count as a 'Crazy Demon Diary'?*

It seemed that in the demons' understanding, those without awakened spiritual intelligence aren't considered demons, just beasts. There is also another type: Calamity Beasts. Among demons, Calamity Beasts are similar to the wicked among humans. They are not only rejected by humans, but even proper demons are unwilling to associate with them, classifying them as beasts.

The鸣蛟 (Ming Jiao) Clan is often scolded as Calamity Beasts (mainly by the禽族, or Bird Clan), but they are actually not in that category.

The demons sat by the flowing banquet, chatting about everything.

Li Mo had a strong sense of déjà vu, as if he were attending a rural banquet in his previous life.

"If our Water Clan gets the Heavenly Jade, I will definitely be able to return to my ancestral form, the Leviathan. Then, I'll carry a piece of land on my back. If any humans want to live on it, they'll have to pay me rent. I heard human rent is very expensive."

This heroic voice belonged to Guo Jing.

"I wonder what our shrimp clan would become if our bloodline were strengthened?"

"By the way, Wu Mo already has the True Dragon bloodline. If he comes into contact with the Heavenly Jade, wouldn't he really be able to turn into a dragon?"

"If our Water Clan produces a True Dragon, wouldn't we dominate the Southern Border from now on? Wouldn't we be able to walk sideways?"

"Aren't you a Crab Clan member?"

"Don't nitpick the details.总之, we must keep the Heavenly Jade in the Water Clan!"

"Yes, we must unite and fully support Boss Mo!"

The Water Demons grew more and more excited as they spoke. They seemed even more confident than the Tianjiao himself.

Li Mo: "..."

Why did the conversation suddenly circle back to him again?

The Divine Jade...

Even if he obtained the Divine Jade, he wouldn't keep it for himself.

Looking at the Water Clan geniuses, their eyes filled with clear and earnest anticipation, Xiao Li suddenly felt a pang of guilt in his conscience.

He might be destined to disappoint everyone.

Xiao Li suddenly felt the weight of the heavy expectations placed upon him by the demons.

Of course, if he hadn't taken this spot, the Water Clan would most likely have had no chance with the Phoenix Goddess either.

But he had made them hope to see the birth of a True Dragon.

He would find other ways to compensate them later.

Thinking this, Li Mo said, "There are many clans competing for the Heavenly Jade, and the competition is fierce. I don't have a full guarantee of victory."

"I met many powerful demon geniuses today. If you encounter them, be extra careful."

He shared the information he had gathered about the other powerful demon geniuses.

The Water Demons listened intently, feeling more and more that their Tianjiao was not only powerful in bloodline but also a meticulous demon, able to gather such accurate information.

"What about the Green Phoenix Goddess? Do you know anything about her, Boss Mo?"

The Water Clan geniuses felt that the only one who could possibly threaten Li Mo was that woman from the Green Phoenix Clan who is suspected to possess the True Phoenix bloodline.

"A little, but not much."

Li Mo fell silent for a moment, then nodded.

"What aspect?"

The Water Demons were all ears, some even taking out small notebooks to take notes while listening.

"Her footwork is very good."

"?????"

The demons were bewildered.

Does this mean the Green Phoenix Goddess is very fast?

That is indeed true. The Green Phoenix Clan can traverse the 'Azure Void,' achieving the effect of being within reach yet a天涯 (sky's edge) away.

As expected of Boss Mo, the Tianjiao from outside the Southern Border. If they weren't cultured demons, they really wouldn't understand his description.

"By the way, many half-demons have come to the Suspended Temple this time."

Guo Jing took out several jars of wine and poured them into the flowing banquet, letting everyone soaking in the river taste it.

"Is that so?"

Li Mo raised an eyebrow. He had wandered around the temple for a long time, but his Heavenly Fate Divine Eye had not seen any information about half-demons.

"Those half-demons all arrived very late."

Guo Jing, his face flushed with alcohol, said, "You threw me quite far away. I only returned to the Suspended Temple in the evening and happened to see them."

"I felt... none of them are weak."

"Half-demons..."

Li Mo couldn't help but think of the Mu Rong brothers.

Mu Rongxiao was targeted by the Demonic Calling Sect because of his half-demon body and almost became a so-called God Son.

Could those half-demons also be related to this matter?

"I'll know tomorrow when I use the Heavenly Fate Divine Eye."

Li Mo silently noted this down.

Then he took out some fine wine, shattered the jars with a slight tremor of his aura, and let the wine flow into the water.

"This is wine I brought from the human world. Please, everyone, have a taste."

"Thanks, Boss Mo!"

"Tsk, tsk, the aroma. It's time to show off my capacity for alcohol."

The Water Demons' capacity for alcohol seemed to be quite poor.

Before long, a pile of demons with their bellies upturned were floating in the river.

...

At the same time.

In another side hall of the Suspended Temple, there were eight half-demons, including Zhiduo Luo, sitting at the same table. The demonic traits on their bodies were all bizarre. Some had fish gills on their necks, some had tiger stripes all over their skin, some were huge in size, and some had several fox tails...

But they had one thing in common.

Their expressions were extremely indifferent. From them, one could hardly see any of the seven emotions and six desires of humans.

"Is that Wu Mo really a True Dragon bloodline?" asked a half-demon of the Qiongqi beast, licking the corner of his mouth.

Zhiduo Luo narrowed his golden eyes. "Otherwise, it's impossible to explain why his strength is so great."

"If he falls into our hands, for the great plan of our Great Shang to revive the True Dragon..."

"It's not just him. That Green Phoenix is even more important! Her True Phoenix bloodline is more crucial!"

"But they are both dragons and phoenixes among demons, their combat power far exceeding their peers. It's already very difficult to take down just one."

The half-demons fell into thought.

"You don't know this."

Zhiduo Luo curled his lips into a smile and said, "Wu Mo and Luan Bing have already clashed. I personally saw them confronting each other. They are bound to settle a score. They might even fight to the death when competing for the Divine Jade."

"We might as well wait for them to injure each other before making our move. Then, we can take the Divine Jade for ourselves."

"This is the plan of 'killing two birds with one stone'!"

The half-demons all felt that Zhiduo Luo's plan was very reliable.

Let's do it
