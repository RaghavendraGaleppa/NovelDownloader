# Chapter 277: The Divine Phoenix God Selects Two? Warmth Remains Unwavering

Divine light, ten thousand zhang high, transformed the sky of the Five Elements Realm into a canvas. In a daze, it seemed as if endless ages overlapped, and countless clans that had vanished in the river of time surged within it.

All the demon clans who witnessed this scene were momentarily struck dumb, forgetting how to speak.

It felt as if, in the midst of the unknown, there was a connection of bloodlines, a call from the depths of their very souls.

Li Mo also couldn't help but look up.

The divine intents he had inscribed within the Seventy-Two Transformations were all boiling hot at this moment, as if they had awakened.

This was... the Divine Phoenix God?

He even felt a sense of wandering through time and space with his immortal body, just like that day.

"What is going on with the Heavenly Outer Divine Jade?"

"The seniors fought over the Divine Jade, but they never witnessed such a phenomenon, right?"

"I read in ancient texts that that is the Celestial Fox Clan, that is the Winged People Clan... and there are so many more I have never seen before."

The gathered demons whispered amongst themselves, their eyes darting about, their minds captivated.

Among them, there were不乏 those who had once held the Divine Jade within their clans, or had heard of, or seen records regarding it.

The current situation seemed to have far exceeded all expectations.

Previously, the Divine Jade appeared once every sixty years.

Could it be possible...

That this time, it would determine a permanent owner?

Outside.

A sharp, cold wind blew from an unknown origin, causing the fallen leaves in the courtyard to rise and scatter.

Amidst the silence, the same thought floated in the minds of the demons.

Just seven years was enough to turn an obscure clan into a tyrant of a region.

If it were permanently held by a single clan, would that not make them the uncrowned king of the Southern Frontier from then on?

The implications were too numerous.

For instance, if it fell into the hands of a cruel and bloodthirsty clan, not only the Southern Frontier, but even the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands would likely never know peace again...

The demons couldn't help but look at the monk, Huai Kong, on the stage.

Would the Suspended Sky Temple allow such a thing to happen?

Huai Kong put his palms together:

"All things in the world have their own karma. To follow karma is the way."

"This was left behind by our demon clans' ancient ancestors."

The speaker was a Demon King of the Great Peng clan. Their clan had held the Heavenly Outer Divine Jade for seven years, and even his feathers were dyed with pure gold.

"To entrust the Divine Jade to a group of juniors to handle—is this not treating the future of our ten thousand demons as a child's game?"

What kind of bird language was he speaking?

Shang Qing frowned and poked his ear.

The other clans that had held the Divine Jade didn't even get a chance to speak.

The forgetful Huai Kong suddenly had a burning gaze, and a wheel of wisdom seemed to appear behind his head. The calm, glazing light of the琉璃 (liúlí) flared violently.

The demons looked up and saw a statue of a Bodhisattva, devoid of joy or sorrow, standing between heaven and earth, overlooking the myriad rivers and mountains. In the Bodhisattva's hand was the 'Purple Gold Alms Bowl'.

This Purple Gold Alms Bowl was the Suspended Sky Temple. From beginning to end, they had never left Huai Kong's Palm Buddha Kingdom.

The apparition vanished in a flash, like a dream or a bubble.

"Where is Zhiduo Shan?"

The demons woke as if from a dream.

They discovered that the Great Peng Demon King who had just spoken was gone, vanished without a trace.

The Demon Kings and great demons of the various clans couldn't help but swallow their saliva.

Their gazes gathered. The kind-faced Huai Kong smiled and said:

"This old monk has a bad memory. Even if I knew, I've forgotten."

"....."

This was why they said Huai Kong possessed great wisdom.

A silence fell over the scene.

They could only follow Huai Kong's words and go with the flow. Who would dare not? If Huai Kong threw you into his Palm Buddha Kingdom and happened to forget you, you might never get out in your lifetime.

It was just that no one knew which demon clan the Divine Jade would ultimately fall to... No.

To be precise, would it be the Ming蛟 (Ming Jiao) Clan or the Qingluan (Blue Luan) Clan?

---

Just at that moment.

The Heavenly Outer Divine Jade within the light screen suddenly let out a strange hum.

To everyone's surprise, before the young demons could even climb the solitary peak, the true body of the Heavenly Outer Divine Jade, amidst the thousands of phenomena, rose into the air on its own.

It cast down a pillar of light.

And the pillar of light was about to envelop the girl who stood out from the crowd.

"The Heavenly Outer Divine Jade... has it chosen the Qingluan Divine Maiden after all?"

Both inside and outside the scene, all the demons were on tenterhooks, their hearts in their throats.

There were demons who had tried to sneak closer, but were instantly repelled by an invisible force.

Ying Bing's eyes rippled slightly. She felt the pulling force within it and did not resist. However, she suddenly looked back.

She saw the Heavenly Jiao, Xiao Li, standing in place, a smile in his eyes, the corner of his mouth also slightly raised.

The helplessness was because he felt this was, perhaps, probably... not quite his investment.

The happiness was because the ice lump had gotten what was rightfully hers.

Hmm!

After all, he had even given her his silk stockings...

Thinking of this, Xiao Li felt that this trip to the Southern Frontier was completely worthwhile!

Ying Bing quietly looked at his raised lips, then looked up at the Divine Phoenix God she had traveled thousands of miles to find, now right before her eyes.

The two of them had witnessed the fall of the Divine Phoenix God together that day...

She was just about to make a move.

Suddenly, another pillar of light was projected from the Divine Phoenix God.

The object of its envelopment was none other than our peerless Heavenly Jiao.

Li Mo: "???"

What the hell was happening?

Before he could react, the pulling force of the light beam suddenly increased violently.

The Divine Phoenix God trembled gently, drawing both of them up together, bringing the thousands of phenomena before their eyes even closer.

Their figures were gradually swallowed and blurred by the phenomena, becoming indistinct.

They gradually found it difficult to even see each other clearly.

"This is different from the Divine Phoenix God of the past."

A veil of unknown mystery was cast over something she had already understood. Ying Bing's mind rippled, but her hand immediately felt a trace of warmth.

Looking at Li Mo's profile, she suddenly felt an unprecedented tranquility. Everything around her seemed to slow down.

Then, light and shadows flickered, and the world was turned upside down.

A strong sense of vertigo made everything feel unreal.

But the warmth in their palms never wavered.

The demons present: ????

"Why would the Divine Jade choose two demons at the same time?" Guo Jing said, her face full of confusion.

Wu Dameng, on the other hand, let out a sigh of relief. "Fortunately, Boss Mo was also chosen by the Divine Jade. Choosing two is better than not being chosen at all."

This meant that our Ming蛟 Clan's Heavenly Jiao still had a chance!

Was there a possibility that the Divine Jade was afraid the two would fight here, harming the bystanders?

The more he thought about it, the more plausible this seemed.

"But in that case, we can't see their situation."

"Yeah, we were already多余的 (superfluous), and now we can't even be spectators. We seem even more多余 now..."

"Should we leave then?"

"The exit to the Five Elements Realm is too far. It's better to wait here."

"If they face each other alone, how fierce will it be? Won't it cost a demon's life?"

Listening to the buzzing discussions, Zhiduo La's mouth gradually curled up, and a smile returned to his face.

Let them fight. The more miserable, the better.

Who could face such a divine object without desire? Without fighting desperately for it?

Once he successfully controlled the Divine Jade.

Then he would absolutely be the head of the holy sons in the教 (Sect) from then on!
