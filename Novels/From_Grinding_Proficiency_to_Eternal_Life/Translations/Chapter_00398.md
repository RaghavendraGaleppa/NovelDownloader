# Chapter 398: True Qi Transforms into True Essence, The First Step Toward Longevity

Under the internal vision of the Martial Dao Sky Eye, the紫黑色 (purple-black) medicinal power could be seen squirming within the spinal canal like a living creature. For every inch it advanced, a new meridian prototype would wrap around the surface of the bone.

The most intense pain came from the seventh thoracic vertebra, the "Spirit Pivot Node" recorded in the *Hundred Bones Penetrating the Nether Technique*. The medicinal power of the Kai Mai Dan suddenly exploded here, transforming into thousands of hair-thin purple lines that radiated outward like a spider web.

Xu Yunfan let out a muffled groan, his back arching like a shrimp as his spine emitted a creaking sound of unbearable strain. Those purple lines were brutally penetrating the periosteum, building bridges in the void between flesh and blood, forcibly connecting upper and lower sections to form a network capable of circulating energy like True Qi and True Essence.

"Ugh!!"

Blood foam leaked from between his teeth, dripping onto his knees. Xu Yunfan suddenly realized his vision was beginning to distort. In the hallucination brought on by the erosion of the medicinal power, he saw his spine twisting and growing, transforming into a dark purple, demonic tree. Its roots burrowed into his pelvis, its branches pierced through his shoulder blades, and every tip of a branch bloomed with buds made of blood vessels.

"Lin!"

Xu Yunfan instantly entered the Lin state. His originally nearly dazed gaze immediately calmed, and the hallucination vanished instantly. He silently felt the meridins inside his body taking root and sprouting, their roots winding throughout his entire body.

He quickly formed the "Penetrating the Nether Seal" with his hands according to the Hundred Bones Penetrating the Nether Technique. The newly born spiritual seed below his navel trembled, spewing out a pale golden Ten Extremes True Qi. These True Qi acted like whips in the hands of a beast tamer, lashing out at the rampant medicinal power and forcing it back into the main meridian channels.

Under internal vision, as the Hundred Bones Penetrating the Nether Technique operated, three main meridians took shape like pythons in his body. The Ren Meridian started from Huiyin, running straight up the center of the chest and abdomen to the throat. The Du Meridian ran逆冲 (retrograde) up the spine; every vertebra was dyed dark gold by the medicinal power, and the newly formed meridian network wrapped around the bones like vines, forcibly penetrating the previously blocked Jade Pillow Gate. The Chong Meridian coiled around the five internal organs like a giant python; every pulse it made caused the twelve regular meridians to tremble slightly, and a lump the size of a pigeon egg actually swelled up at the location of the Heart Pack.

This was precisely the prototype Spirit Platform recorded in the *Hundred Bones Penetrating the Nether Technique*.

"Success!"

Xu Yunfan’s eyes snapped open, a dark golden pattern flashing deep within his pupils. At this moment, three inches below his navel at the Guanyuan acupoint, the original flesh and meridians had been completely reshaped by the roots of the spiritual seed. A dark purple energy vortex slowly rotated, profound and mysterious like a nebula. Suspended in its center was a crystal nucleus the size of a grain of rice, flickering with the rhythm of his breath, swallowing and spitting the Ten Extremes True Qi in a Zhou Tian cycle.

This was undoubtedly the legendary Dantian Qi Sea!

Although the newly born Qi Sea was still weak, and the rotation of the vortex carried a sense of clumsiness, the pulse of that crystal nucleus was like the first heartbeat at the beginning of chaos. The foundation for the towering skyscraper of Immortal Dao cultivation was quietly cast at this very moment.

Finally...

Xu Yunfan, having released the Lin state, slightly raised the corner of his mouth, a faint smile appearing on his face. Having endured countless trials, even with his current steady temperament, he was still filled with joy. The True Qi within his flesh and blood flowed like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, forming a mighty torrent under the牵引 (pull) of the Dantian Qi Sea.

Every time the dark purple vortex rotated, strands of dark golden patterns spread along the newly formed meridian network, binding all the True Qi wandering in the four limbs and hundred bones. Xu Yunfan could clearly feel that the True Qi, originally drifting like mist, was now turning into liquid mercury, roaring like a surging river within the main channel of the Chong Meridian.

The purple light of the Kai Mai Dan’s medicinal power, which had not yet dissipated, still wandered between the bones. The three main meridians now presented completely different phenomena. The Ren Meridian was like a gold-plated chain penetrating the torso; the Du Meridian resembled a dragon coiled around a pillar,透出 (emitting) a jade luster; while the most bizarre Chong Meridian formed a lump the size of a pigeon egg below the heart. This was the spiritual seed core of the Hundred Bones Penetrating the Nether Technique, serving as the foundation to continuously evolve the meridian system for True Qi flow.

Not delaying any further, Xu Yunfan began to cultivate according to the True武 Swallowing Demon True Scripture obtained from the soul search of the Divine Martial Realman. He sat cross-legged like a bell, fingers interlaced to form the "True武 Seal" according to the cultivation method of the True武 Swallowing Demon True Scripture. The liquid True Qi in his body, guided by the scripture, began to surge and cycle along the newly formed meridian network. With every Zhou Tian rotation, the True Qi became a fraction more solid, gradually condensing fine dark golden crystal grains on the inner walls of the meridians.

"So that's how it is..."

Xu Yunfan’s spirit platform was clear. This technique actually used Martial Dao will as the hammer and the body's blood and energy as the furnace to temper the True Qi repeatedly. He visualized his spirit transforming into a Cauldron of Heaven, and the crystal nucleus below his navel trembled in response, spewing out scorching True Fire. If one did not practice the Martial Dao and condense True Qi, it would be impossible to cultivate this True Scripture. From a certain perspective, this True Scripture was the subsequent Martial Dao path.

As time passed, the True武 Swallowing Demon True Scripture continued to operate and cultivate. The most intense changes began at the Tanzhong acupoint. When the torrent of True Qi passed through this point, it was suddenly compressed into a mercury-like consistency. Xu Yunfan’s chest emitted a rumble like muffled thunder; that mass of liquid True Qi, under extreme pressure, actually began to collapse and shrink.

"Condense!"

As the mantra of the True Scripture was activated, the core of the collapsing True Qi suddenly burst with a blinding golden light. The twelve major meridians trembled simultaneously, pulling all the True Qi scattered throughout the four limbs and hundred bones away, converging toward the heart like a hundred rivers returning to the sea. The Spirit Platform lump at the Heart Pack now acted as a forge, repeatedly refining the influx of True Qi.

When ordinary cultivators practice, using techniques like the *Hundred Desires Swallowing Yuan Great Method*, they need to use visualization methods to stir the hundred meridians in their bodies, gathering True Essence within them, and then finally汇入 (converge) into the Dantian Qi Sea like streams returning to the ocean. However, Xu Yunfan’s situation was vastly different right now. The medicinal power of the Kai Mai Dan was currently reshaping the meridian system, and the newly born Dantian Qi Sea was as fragile as a newborn infant. The pigeon-egg-sized Spirit Platform lump at the Heart Pack had evolved into a special transitional Dantian organ. It both acted as a furnace to refine blood energy into True Essence and served as a transfer hub to coordinate the conversion between the new and old energy systems. Once the Dantian Qi Sea was completely stable and the meridian network throughout the body was fully formed, this temporarily generated lump would naturally dissolve like a cicada sloughing off its shell.

Three days later, during the Yin hour, Xu Yunfan’s body suddenly burst into赤金 (crimson gold) flames. His spine cracked节节 (segment by segment); a crystal with eight faces condensed at the Dazhui acupoint, and all the True Qi flowing through this point was converted into viscous, mercury-like True Essence. The newborn True Essence carried a heavy texture like a mountain, flowing through the meridians with a sound of clashing metal.

If he were to exert his full power now, his pressure would be comparable to the Great Perfection of the Qi Condensation realm. However, under Xu Yunfan’s deliberate suppression, the True武 Subduing Demon method of the True武 Swallowing Demon True Scripture perfectly restrained his aura to the level of just entering Qi Condensation.

This feeling was very marvelous...

Xu Yunfan looked internally at the surging True Essence in his meridians; condensed by the True武 Swallowing Demon True Scripture, every strand was as heavy and solid as molten iron. The most mystical aspect lay in the resonance between the Spirit Platform lump and the True Essence. Whenever his heart beat, the pigeon-egg-sized lump would tremble like a war drum, emitting visible crimson golden ripples.
