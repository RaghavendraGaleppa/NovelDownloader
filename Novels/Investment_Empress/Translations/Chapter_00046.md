# Chapter 46: Li's Modest Fortune, and the Ice Block's Confusion

As Elder Han He's words fell, Shang Wu, without a moment's hesitation, replied with a displeased expression: "Let him stay with you? Old man, are you trying to snatch my disciple from me?"

"Who cares for your disciple! This old man is keeping the ancestral divine weapon!" Elder Han He was uncharacteristically firm. Even if this matter reached the Sect Master, he would be in the right. Furthermore, Shang Wu's concerns weren't entirely unfounded. If a Divine Armament Peak disciple gained the Meteorite Calamity Hammer's recognition, they would be the undisputed next Peak Master.

"Elder Han He wouldn't want to keep me here forging iron, would he?" Li Mo vaguely sensed the underlying intention.

That simply wouldn't do. If he stayed here every day, how could he... *ahem*, how could he snuggle up to the 'ice block's' jade leg?

"If True Disciple Li stays here, Divine Armament Peak will cover all your future expenses." The next moment, Elder Han He's deep, resonant voice drifted over. It was full of tempting allure. Clearly, he was prepared to pay a hefty price.

"Elder, what nonsense are you speaking? My Master has an unyielding spirit; how could she abandon her disciple for mere 'five pecks of rice'?" Li Mo finished speaking with righteous indignation. "Right, Master... Master?"

Turning back, he saw his Master had lost her previous fierce demeanor, her beautiful eyes slightly unfocused, as if she were calculating a carefree future with unlimited fine wine and delicacies. He strongly suspected she could already hear the clinking of silver coins.

Li Mo was speechless. It seemed he had still underestimated his Master's poverty and her penchant for money.

Li Mo lowered his voice, "Master, when has Autumn Water Pavilion ever lacked fine food and wine for you? If I stay on Divine Armament Peak, there'll be no one to cook for you anymore!"

Divine Armament Peak's weapons had extensive sales, truly raking in wealth daily. Yet, it probably couldn't compare to his own method of 'creating something out of nothing' to make money quickly. Furthermore, he never feared being impoverished by anyone; on the contrary, he would only grow wealthier from the investment feedback.

"Hmm, I'm not that kind of person." His beautiful Master's eyes instantly cleared, and she nodded seriously.

"Elder, you worry too much. This disciple still possesses a modest family fortune." Li Mo cupped his hands towards Elder Han He.

"How much can you possibly have..."

*Thud—*

Two large chunks of gleaming, cold metal thudded onto the ground. Immediately, the temperature in the room dropped slightly, as if these two chunks of metal were absorbing all the heat. Elder Han He's smiling expression froze, replaced by deep contemplation.

Iron Essence. Ten thousand *jin* of iron yields merely one *liang* of essence. Even a trace added to ordinary weapons could make them sharp enough to slice hair and shave through iron like mud. These two large chunks of Iron Essence... Divine Armament Peak, even with the help of the Cold Flame Spring water and all its disciples hammering until their mallets smoked, would struggle to produce them in three years.

*Thud—*

Another dull thud echoed. A fist-sized, fiery-red chunk of metal landed on the ground.

"Hsss..." Elder Han He could no longer maintain his composure.

Blazing Rock Copper Ore. Only when a mineral vein happens to be near a volcano, and the ore within is tempered by earth fire for over ten thousand years, can it form. Then, it must be unearthed through a volcanic eruption to be obtained by humans. The legendary Scarlet Sky Sword contained this very material.

"You call *this*... a modest fortune?"

Old Han began to ponder the origins of the inheritance Li Mo had received. Shang Wu was also contemplating this question. The powerful expert who left behind this inheritance, did they perhaps run a merchant guild in their past life? Or were they some notorious brigand who plundered countless riches?

"This disciple is no blacksmith, so these two rare treasures are truly wasted on me, like pearls cast before swine." Li Mo said. "Elder, you are a renowned Grand Craftsman in Ziyang Prefecture; only you can truly make the most of them."

Little Li certainly knew how to flatter old men.

Elder Han He fell silent. After a long moment, he finally sighed: "Shang Wu, your disciple knows how to conduct himself better than you do. This old man is no longer worried about him wielding the divine weapon and causing endless misfortune."

Shang Wu: "...?"

Han He paid her no further mind, turning back to Li Mo, he said in a deep voice: "Li Mo, if you can accomplish three tasks, then this old man sees no harm in helping you achieve your aims."

"Elder, please state them." Li Mo readily assented.
