# Chapter 15: Only to Kill

Amidst the gloomy sky, flashes of blades and glints of swords flickered incessantly. With every collision, blinding sparks erupted. The sounds of battle and screams intertwined, deafening to the ear.

The black-clad figure moved with agility and decisiveness, like a dark phantom weaving through the chaos, the weapon in hand gleaming with a cold light. Although the overseers had the advantage in numbers, they gradually fell into a disadvantage under the protective advantage of the black-clad figure's iron armor. Overseers were injured and fell to the ground one after another, letting out pained moans.

Xu Yunfan moved cautiously through the fray, his footsteps as light as a civet cat's, his eyes scanning the surroundings with vigilance, afraid that a moment of carelessness would drag him into this vortex of frenzied killing. His heart was in his throat, and fine beads of sweat seeped from his forehead. In this environment of cold-weapon combat where death could strike at any moment, only by being doubly careful could one hope to find a sliver of a chance at survival.

Crawling and rolling his way to the edge of the battlefield, Xu Yunfan caught sight of Zhou Feng not far away. The latter was following closely behind a tall, fair-skinned man, his expression tense, sticking to him like glue, not daring to stray even slightly.

He quickly retracted his gaze. Just from this momentary pause, an overseer noticed him and rushed over rapidly. He remembered this overseer; it was the same guy who had tossed out饼子 (flatbreads) like garbage back in the mine.

Carrying Li Haomiao was inevitably a bit ostentatious and drew attention.

Li Haomiao sensed Xu Yunfan's heart beginning to pound violently, the blood and energy within him surging, and said in a low voice, "That overseer has only just stepped into the basics of martial arts. In practice, courage comes first, strength second, and technique third. If you lack courage, even if you possessed peerless divine skills, your martial path would be shattered the moment you encounter the slightest obstacle, leaving no room for progress."

"Advance bravely and resolutely, forge ahead with courage, and maintain the momentum of an unstoppable force. This is a battlefield! Retreat means death. Fight your way out!"

Xu Yunfan forcefully suppressed his turbulent emotions. Reciting the 'Supreme Good is Like Water' mantra in his heart, although the 'Lin' character mantra had not yet truly taken root, it still allowed him to quickly calm down.

He hesitated no longer. One swift step leads to another; his feet seemed to generate wind as he charged straight at the overseer. His 'Flying Leg' technique was pushed to its limit, his form trailing waves of fierce wind.

Seeing this, the overseer's face instantly twisted into a ferocious grin, his thick flesh distorting as if he were a malicious ghost. He swung his long blade fiercely. The body of the sword flashed with a cold light, carving a chilling arc through the air as it hacked down towards Xu Yunfan's head, accompanied by the sound of whistling wind.

Xu Yunfan's entire body was taut, every muscle like a fully drawn strong bow, poised to strike.

Just as the long blade, whistling with fierce wind, was about to cleave him in two in that critical instant—

His soles suddenly exerted force. It seemed as if an invisible force pulled and twisted between his foot and the ground. Immediately after, his ankle twisted sharply, his waist and hips turned, and he sidestepped in a flash.

The movement was light and fluid, as smooth as flowing clouds and flowing water, as if practiced a thousand times, easily dodging this deadly, fierce strike.

Xu Yunfan thought to himself, "Is it that this overseer can't lift his blade anymore, or has my reaction speed increased?"

It was his reaction speed that had increased!

The thought flashed through his mind. Xu Yunfan's eyes were like torches. He stared straight at the overseer's face, where the ferocity had yet to fade and the shock had widened his eyes. The overseer had missed with his slash and was just about to retract his long blade.

Xu Yunfan let out a fierce shout and swung his arm.

The crude iron pickaxe in his hand seemed like a peerless heavy hammer at this moment, whistling as it tore through the heavy air, emitting a sharp "whooshing" sound.

The pickaxe, carrying an aura of advancing without retreat, pierced forward like lightning.

The overseer was terrified. He raised his hand in a panic to block, but it was too late.

The tip of the pickaxe, like an arrow, drew an arc through the air, piercing from back to front with unstoppable force.

With a muffled "thud," it pierced through the overseer's neck.

Blood gushed out, spraying into the air.

Xu Yunfan followed through with a pull and a tug. The overseer's neck was instantly mangled flesh and blood. He didn't even have time to let out a scream before collapsing heavily to the ground, his life extinguished.

In an instant, the smell of blood filled the air, pungent and unpleasant.

Li Haomiao clicked his tongue.

"So ruthless!"

It turned out his own strength had already reached such a level. The overseers who used to make him lower his head and dare not look directly at them couldn't even last a single exchange against him now.

In that instant, the gloom that had accumulated in Xu Yunfan's heart since his transmigration was fully released at this moment. A feeling of exhilaration churned within his chest.

The various hormones in his body rose rapidly, his blood and energy surged, and he quickly adjusted his spirit to its current best state.

The crude iron pickaxe in his hand spun nimbly around his fingers. Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate. He scanned his surroundings. A few overseers not far away saw this scene, their footsteps faltered, they hesitated for a moment, exchanged glances, but ultimately charged over.

That single pickaxe strike from Xu Yunfan was enough to show that he wasn't just at the entry level of martial arts; it was very likely that he had already reached the minor success stage in an external martial art.

If it were a one-on-one fight, they absolutely were not his match.

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't let these few overseers surround him. After clearing the overseers blocking his path ahead, he pushed his 'Flying Leg' technique to its extreme limit.

Watching an overseer rushing towards his side, his gaze turned icy cold. He raised the iron pickaxe in his hand. As the muscles in his arm bulged and veins throbbed, his waist and hips sank down.

Using his body as the bow and his arm as the string, the iron pickaxe in his hand fell like a heavy hammer. The force was swift and heavy, tearing through the air and producing a 'whooshing' sound.

The overseer's expression was one of terror. He truly hadn't expected Xu Yunfan's attack to be so swift and fierce. His weapon had only just been raised halfway when the tip of the pickaxe plunged into his skull, killing him on the spot.

"If only I had a hammer," Xu Yunfan sighed.

Wielding the pickaxe was, after all, somewhat unsatisfactory. The 'Copper Body Art' was a hammer technique; it should be the prerequisite for some kind of hammer-style martial art.

He had scanned the battlefield, yet not a single person was using a hammer-like weapon.

Moving halfway through, Xu Yunfan's eyes caught something. He saw Yang Gan not far away holding an iron whip, wielding it like a snake. For a time, he kept four or five black-clad figures at bay. A single whip strike would send dirt and stones flying from the ground.

With just a slight misstep, one could see a black-clad figure struck by the whip, lying on the ground, the wound a mess of flesh and blood, deep enough to show bone.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan immediately changed direction. This man had already achieved minor success in skin tempering and specialized in hard styles. Moreover, he harbored considerable malice towards him. If Xu Yunfan charged straight into him, it would likely be a dead end.

Xu Yunfan kept his eyes fixed on Fang Mushan, who was galloping ahead. Seeing the other party quicken his pace, he had no choice but to speed up as well.

Fortunately, he had the 'Flying Leg' technique. Although the name sounded rather cheap, it was extremely adept at long-distance travel. With every step, the core muscles of his legs pulled, as if a force was rising from the soles of his feet, propelling him forward like a spring.

Not long after, as they ran one after the other to the foot of a ridge, far from the battlefield, they saw an overseer jump out in front, holding a long whip. He raised his hand towards Fang Mushan and flicked his wrist.

The long whip, like a venomous snake, tore through the air with a 'whooshing' sound, heading straight for Fang Mushan ahead.

Fang Mushan's expression remained unchanged. He raised his hand and caught the whip firmly.

Under Xu Yunfan's gaze, Fang Mushan's arm muscles bulged slightly. With a pull backwards, the overseer was yanked as if by a raging bear, a force of a thousand pounds twisting his entire figure, stumbling and crashing towards Fang Mushan.
