# Chapter 83: No Personal Grudge, Only the Contest of the Great Dao!  

Gu Yuan descended in a flash of light, his footsteps never pausing as he strode through the grand hall and entered the inner chamber.  

In an instant, countless gazes swept toward him.  

The seating in the inner chamber had long been settled—these sixteen individuals had secured their places through fierce competition. Ordinarily, disciples outside the hall wouldn’t dare to intrude so casually.  

Anyone who entered the inner chamber signaled the beginning of a new contest, and thus, the gazes that met Gu Yuan were icy.  

Yet Gu Yuan remained unperturbed. His hands were clasped behind his back, his sleeves swaying gently, and even the corners of his lips curled into a faint smile.  

Such confidence made the others in the chamber frown.  

A few among them, upon recognizing Gu Yuan’s face, wore expressions of indignation.  

"That thief!"  

But when they sensed the profound aura emanating from Gu Yuan, their expressions shifted. They quickly lowered their heads, as if afraid he might notice them.  

This thief had been able to plunder spiritual peaks at the seventh level of Qi Refining. Now that he had reached the peak of the eighth level, how formidable must he be?  

The odd behavior of these few did not escape the notice of the other cultivators in the chamber. The rest frowned deeply, while those seated at the lower end—who had only recently broken through to the eighth level—felt uneasy.  

However, Gu Yuan’s gaze merely swept past them before moving on.  

He had come here today with a plan, and the lowest seats would not serve his purpose.  

With measured steps, he walked forward, passing between the seated disciples.  

Each time he passed someone, that person exhaled in relief.  

Only when he reached the second seat in the front row did he stop.  

At this, the young man seated there—dressed in an eight-leaf Daoist robe, his eyes shimmering with silver light—coldly raised his head. But before he could utter a word, a calm voice reached his ears.  

"The contest for seating is also a contest of cultivation. Senior Brother, you have reached the peak of the eighth level of Qi Refining, as have I. Today, why don’t we exchange pointers to test our respective attainments?"  

"This matter is no personal grudge—only the contest of the Great Dao!"  

Gu Yuan folded his sleeves and bowed slightly to the young man before him.  

The young man was momentarily stunned.  

Had Gu Yuan been disrespectful, arrogant, or domineering, he would have cursed him outright or rallied others to drive him out.  

But Gu Yuan’s words were so openly righteous that he found himself unable to refute them.  

The first seat was occupied by a senior brother at the ninth level of Qi Refining, while the side seats belonged to junior brothers at the late eighth level.  

Only he shared the same cultivation level as Gu Yuan.  

When two were of equal strength, how could one refuse a challenge?  

"Very well," the young man finally said, gesturing with his hand.  

"Please," Gu Yuan replied before flicking his sleeve and pressing a finger toward the young man.  

---  

*Clang!*  

A dazzling sword aura surged forth, coalescing into a delicate peach blossom that bloomed at Gu Yuan’s fingertip.  

*Buzz—*  

At the same time, golden array patterns lit up in the lecture hall, forming an invisible barrier that confined the power of Gu Yuan’s technique to a minuscule space.  

The sword aura was sharp, yet it remained swirling only around his fingertip.  

The young man remained seated cross-legged, flicking his finger in response. A silver falcon, no larger than an inch, shot forth with astonishing speed to meet the peach blossom.  

The falcon cried out, its razor-sharp aura slicing through the pink petals.  

This silver falcon seemed to be condensed from a sword seal, and its power was even greater. The peach blossom wavered, on the verge of shattering.  

A faint smile appeared on the young man’s face.  

But Gu Yuan remained motionless, merely pressing his finger downward. The faltering peach blossom suddenly stabilized, as if forged from unyielding steel, exuding an oppressive aura.  

The young man’s expression changed. He flicked his fingers repeatedly, and around the silver falcon, several dazzling streaks of light emerged—a silver wolf lunging to bite, a crimson fox howling to ensnare souls, a jade wasp darting to sting.  

All were confined within the same tiny space, their power undiminished as they surged toward the peach blossom.  

*Whoosh—*  

But around Gu Yuan’s fingertip, wisps of mist suddenly appeared, carrying a damp, watery energy that enveloped the incoming attacks.  

Though fierce, the beasts were trapped within the mist, unable to break free.  

The young man’s face paled. He was about to unleash another technique when a bone-chilling sensation gripped his heart—as if he had heard the roar of a dragon.  

*Sssk!*  

The peach blossom landed on his shoulder, severing a lock of hair that had fallen by his temple.  

"I concede," Gu Yuan said, withdrawing his finger and clasping his hands within his sleeves as he bowed slightly.  

The young man seemed to awaken from a dream, his fingers instinctively touching his throat.  

For a fleeting moment, he had felt an icy sharpness graze his skin.  

"I… concede," he stammered, hastily rising from his seat under the weight of the surrounding gazes.  

"Many thanks, Senior Brother," Gu Yuan said with a smile, settling into the vacated seat with ease.  

*Gasp—*  

Only then did the disciples outside the inner chamber, who had been watching the spectacle, let out murmurs of awe.  

In that confined space, true skill had been revealed.  

---  

The exchange had lasted only an instant, yet the intensity of their clash within that tiny space had left the onlookers breathless.  

"If that peach blossom had struck his neck instead of his hair, Senior Brother Su would have lost his head…" someone whispered in the hall.  

A new force had emerged in the lecture hall, and from now on, the seating arrangements might shift once more.  

After relinquishing his seat, the young man—Senior Brother Su—gradually regained his composure. He glanced at the side and lower seats, hesitated for a moment, then sighed and departed on a beam of light.  

Those he had glanced at exhaled in relief before turning their gazes back to Gu Yuan.  

*What a line—'No personal grudge, only the contest of the Great Dao.'*  

...  

"Junior Brother, your skills are impressive. Which cave abode do you cultivate in?"  

As the golden array patterns faded and silence returned to the lecture hall, the middle-aged Daoist seated to Gu Yuan’s left—dressed in a nine-leaf robe, with a broad forehead and prominent nose—turned to him with a smile.  

This man was the only disciple in the lecture hall at the ninth level of Qi Refining, though his age suggested he had been stuck at this stage for some time.  

"Greetings, Senior Brother. This junior cultivates in the Qian Yuan Cave," Gu Yuan replied politely.  

"Are you married, Junior Brother?"  

The middle-aged Daoist studied Gu Yuan for a moment before smiling again.  

Gu Yuan was momentarily taken aback, unsure of the man’s intentions, but answered truthfully, "Until I achieve the Great Dao, I have no mind for marriage."  

The middle-aged Daoist nodded understandingly before saying warmly,  

"I have a younger sister—though not a disciple of our sect—who is peerless in beauty and grace. She cultivates at the Celestial Maiden Temple and has reached the eighth level of Qi Refining. If you are interested, do not hesitate to say so."  

"I reside in the Crimson Rainbow Cave. You may call me Senior Brother Li."  

The offer was abrupt, and Gu Yuan, though puzzled, could only nod in response.  

Just then, a heavy presence descended outside the lecture hall, and all fell silent.
