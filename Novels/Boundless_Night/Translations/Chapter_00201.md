Chapter 201: The Best of Times

Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan were both quite old, with sparse hair. They usually smiled, but when serious, they exuded an air of authority.

Zhao Ziyuan said, "Cheng Rui, you will follow Minghui and study in the library from now on."

"Ah," the yellow-robed girl was startled. What was going on? Soon, she nodded like a pecking chick. Since two highly respected seniors had given such an order, she couldn't possibly defy it.

"Why aren't you thanking the seniors yet!" Xin Youdao reminded her, noting it was a good place to be.

Yu Gensheng spoke, "Qian Chuan, Tang Jun, you two go to the misty area behind the mountain."

The two immediately looked bewildered. That was not a safe place; the academy teachers usually warned against entering that area recklessly, as it could easily lead to trouble.

Yu Gensheng said, "Some old fellows live there. Qian Chuan will be responsible for guarding the gate, and Tang Jun will deliver their meals. Whether you can earn their favor will depend on your own abilities."

"Thank you, seniors." Both showed delight upon hearing this, realizing it was a good assignment.

After a brief contemplation, Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan realized the seriousness of the situation. The appearance of a disciple with Grandmaster-level talent on the Novice Path was no small matter. To be safe, they personally "arranged" things. Otherwise, merely telling Zhao Minghui to keep their mouths shut wouldn't be very effective.

"Little Xin, you're also on the Novice Path. If you have any questions you don't understand in the future, just come directly to me," Yu Gensheng said.

"Yes, Teacher!" Xin Youdao immediately performed a grand bow.

Zhao Ziyuan said, "Ling Yu, your senior sister brought you to Kunling primarily for the auspicious beast's blood, and to register you at the Mountain River Academy. You will follow me for now."

"Understood, senior!" Ling Yu also quickly stepped forward to greet him.

These youths hadn't quite grasped the situation yet, only feeling flattered by the seniors' attention, and were very happy. Tang Jin understood that this was to prevent the youths from being unstable and carelessly revealing information later.

"Minghui, take these three and leave first," Zhao Ziyuan said, pointing at Qian Chuan, Cheng Rui, and Tang Jun.

"Alright!" Zhao Minghui led the three away.

Yu Gensheng spoke, "Now to the main business. Recently, some special 'blessed lands,' which can be called Secret Realms, are about to open on the plateau outside the Third Abyssal Zone." He looked at Qin Ming, Wu Yaozu, Ling Yu, and Xin Youdao, solemnly informing them to prepare themselves over the next few days, as the four of them were qualified to enter.

Yu Gensheng said, "Alright, the details will be told to you later." He had called them over, yet his words were surprisingly brief.

Soon, Tang Jin noticed that the two old men's gazes had also fallen upon her.

Yu Gensheng smiled, "Miss Tang, I heard you have a junior brother who possesses true Grandmaster-level talent?"

Tang Jin's pupils contracted. How did he know?

Qin Ming's heart stirred. As expected, this lineage had an even stronger disciple! Clearly, Ling Yu was aware and hadn't been kept in the dark; he wasn't merely a substitute as some might think.

Back on Black-White Mountain, Tang Jin had said, "The person I've chosen is like a blazing sun about to break through dark clouds, but it's not suitable for him to be exposed too early, lest he incur Heaven's jealousy." Yu Que had vaguely overheard this. And not long ago, when Ling Yu was defeated by Qin Ming, he had also mentioned that in his understanding, within the First Realm, Qin Ming was likely among the very best, possessing legendary Grandmaster-level talent. All of this confirmed that there was indeed another hidden disciple in that lineage!

Zhao Ziyuan said, "Your junior brother was suspected when he used your lineage's core scripture during a sparring match with a disciple from the Immortal Land." The so-called hidden disciple wasn't nurtured within the sect's main grounds. This lineage clearly understood how to cultivate wild disciples; that youth was undergoing the baptism of high-intensity combat and was validating the "new method" after combining two paths.

"He's been discovered?" Tang Jin frowned.

Zhao Ziyuan chuckled, "This matter was suppressed. Only a few people witnessed it, just like our current situation here. One of my descendants happened to be present at the time."

"Senior, you mean..." Tang Jin looked at him. Everyone else had been assigned, so this was also out of concern that she might reveal Qin Ming's true potential.

Yu Gensheng said, "It was truly a pity that a Hegemon finally emerged back then, only to be cut short. We don't want such a thing to happen again." The premature strangling of a future new Grandmaster pained many old-timers whenever they thought of it. Unfortunately, no one could do anything about Cao Qianqiu, who was in his "prime."

A warmth flowed through Qin Ming's heart; he was quite moved. The two old men had made these arrangements and said so much, all because they were worried about his Grandmaster-level talent being exposed.

Tang Jin shook her head, her expression sincere. "Seniors, you worry too much. Although we are very close to the Outsider Lands, we are also people of the Novice Path. We would never be so dishonorable!"

The purple-eyed crow also spoke, "I can guarantee this point. We are all on the same side, and the Grandmaster is also pleased to see youths with Grandmaster-level talent appearing on the Novice Path, helping him validate new methods."

"Indeed!" Both old men nodded.

"What was the result of that battle?" Master Wu asked.

"It ended in a draw," Zhao Ziyuan informed them.

"My junior brother has Grandmaster-level talent, dual paths running concurrently, and both have already reached completion in the First Realm. And yet, it could only end in a draw?" Tang Jin was not satisfied with this result.

Zhao Ziyuan informed, "That disciple from the Immortal Land is extremely formidable. Currently, his cultivation realm isn't high enough, but once he steps into the middle to late stages of the Yellow Court Realm, he will undoubtedly become a near-immortal seed." Immortal seeds from the Outsider Lands, with rare exceptions, are generally confirmed in the Yellow Court Realm.

Qin Ming was surprised. Are near-immortal seeds really that strong? He couldn't help but ask about that person's specific cultivation realm.

"He's also at the completion level of the First Realm," Yu Gensheng informed with a smile.

Qin Ming understood. He was currently on his eighth rebirth, with one more opportunity for rebirth still available!

Little Wu patted his chest and said, "That really scared me just now. I thought he was only in the mid-stage of the First Realm." Instantly, the two old men looked at him with strange expressions.

Tang Jin frowned slightly, making a guess. "It seems the Immortal Land has expanded its path again, teaching future immortal seeds in advance. Otherwise, my junior brother wouldn't have used the trump card-level ultimate art taught by our teacher!"

Zhao Ziyuan sighed, "This is the best of times, and also the most cruel and bloody period of competition. All paths are still imperfect, all are being expanded and pioneered. Those who are truly exceptional might very well approach immortality and become ancestors in the future." All paths were still being pioneered. Whether it was Sun Taichu or Cao Qianqiu, who already stood among the clouds, or younger newcomers, everyone had a chance!

Yu Gensheng said, "Since everything has been laid bare, there are no more problems."

In the end, only the two old men, Qin Ming, and Wu Yaozu remained. Soon, Little Wu also received their approval, which greatly surprised Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan. What was happening this year? Such pleasant surprises were suddenly appearing. Little Wu had determined his path: to rigorously cultivate his physical body and never abandon his corporeal form in the future!

The two old men started arguing here because of Qin Ming. Yu Gensheng wanted to secretly cultivate Qin Ming, giving him whatever he needed! But Zhao Ziyuan objected, believing it was not advisable. He worried that it would prematurely ripen him into a "crooked melon and cracked jujube" (a defective product), or even be equivalent to "raising a pig."

Little Wu nearly choked with laughter upon hearing this. Qin Ming glared at him, wanting to give him a couple of punches.

Zhao Ziyuan said, "Even the Tathagatas of this era let their disciples grow freely, requiring them to fight fiercely and strive for resources. And that hidden disciple from earlier wasn't raised in a greenhouse either. How can the two of us compare to Grandmaster-level figures? We are simply not worthy of teaching him!" He believed that a "wild" Qin Ming was the best Qin Ming, one who reached this height through his own efforts. Now, they shouldn't alter Qin Ming's developmental trajectory!

Ultimately, Yu Gensheng was persuaded. "If the Cui family intervenes, or if other old fellows intend to suppress him, we naturally won't stand by idly. Other than that, we won't interfere."

Despite saying so, the two still walked over and handed him a copy of the *Indestructible Butterfly Scripture*. Qin Ming felt as if he were dreaming. This was his "richest" day since embarking on the Novice Path, gaining two wondrous cultivation arts in a single day!

"Child, we cannot compare to Grandmaster-level figures, nor do we have the ability to pioneer new paths..." The two believed that the current Qin Ming was progressing very steadily, similar to historical Grandmasters, advancing with wildness and sharpness, relying on his own initiative. They were afraid that incorrect "feeding" would "cripple" him. The two felt they shouldn't interfere, to prevent him from deviating from his original course.

Qin Ming originally wanted to say something, but in the end, he merely nodded.

"Alas!" Yu Gensheng sighed, then told him about the Secret Realm. That area was jointly managed by Kunling Academy, the Outsider Lands, the Esoteric Sect, and other factions. Over the years, due to the poor performance of those on the Novice Path, the number of entrants had continuously been reduced.

Zhao Ziyuan said, "One cannot blame others. After years of failing to compete effectively, the number of slots for the Novice Path kept decreasing, forming a vicious cycle. We can only blame ourselves for not being strong enough." By now, Novices could only enter by being hired, or by entering as "companions."

"What's a companion?" Little Wu couldn't help but ask.

"You need to team up with others to go in, and you'll have to do some grunt work, such as scouting paths, dealing with emergencies, and so on."

Qin Ming and Little Wu listened, dumbfounded. These were all dirty and arduous tasks!

Yu Gensheng said, "I think if the two of you go in, it shouldn't be a big problem. If worst comes to worst, you can leave the team and act alone; you can still survive and get the benefits you deserve." The key was that to enter the Secret Realm, you either had to be hired by someone or "partner up" with others.

"How tragic!" Little Wu couldn't help but exclaim. This instantly stung Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan's hearts, but reality was indeed this harsh.

"Why has it fallen to such a state?" Little Wu couldn't help but continue his "stabbing" questions.

Zhao Ziyuan said, "For all these years, the Jade Purity Sect has sealed its mountains, the Six Emperors' Grandmaster is dying, and Qingtian also doesn't have much time left. Several major ancestral courts have kept low profiles, with no core disciples coming forth. Relying solely on the Novices from Kunling itself, they simply can't compete." The Secret Realm was extremely mysterious. Its ability to attract near-immortal seeds from the Outsider Immortal Lands, Pure Lands, and Yang Lands to participate was sufficient to illustrate the issue. Most of the time, the divine seeds of the Esoteric Sect would also come. Thus, the Novices from this area indeed couldn't compete. Furthermore, the demons and monsters on the plateau outside the Third Abyssal Zone might also enter, as the Secret Realm was originally taken from them.

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming and Little Wu instantly became energetic. A place coveted by all factions must hold considerable benefits.

Over the next two days, Qin Ming diligently studied the *Dragon-Serpent Scripture*, continuously practicing it. He felt its extraordinary nature; this cultivation method could transform one's root bones, allowing a serpent to become a dragon, which was exceptionally difficult. In a trance, he seemed to see a large serpent, its flesh and blood splattered and its body broken into pieces by lightning on a rainy night. That was the arduous struggle and hardship of an ordinary creature attempting to ascend to the heavens, seemingly separated by an insurmountable chasm.

"This scripture... it's not simple. It would be impressive to master even a part of it during the Novice stage. This is the difference between immortals and mortals, requiring a qualitative transformation. The path is obstructed; this is also about transforming from a mortal body to a divine one." Qin Ming pondered, this scripture was extremely difficult to cultivate!

Little Wu came to call him, saying, "Brother, stop practicing. The two seniors are calling for us; it seems we're about to 'partner up' for the first time." They arrived at the neighboring Flying Immortal Academy, watching Xin Youdao and Ling Yu being practically dragged away, immensely popular. Both were a little dumbfounded. They had even thought of teaming up with those two if things didn't work out.

In fact, those two had already been warned to avoid drawing too much attention and not to form a four-person team with Qin Ming and Little Wu.

"Choose those two!" Xin Youdao immediately told the person beside him. However, that person shook their head, informing him that the team was already full.

"Fairy Zhao, I believe those two have extraordinary strength," Ling Yu also recommended to an acquaintance, but was told that the members had already been decided.

Qin Ming and Little Wu exchanged glances. Were they being looked down upon?
