# Chapter 42: Saddle

Ding Rui had even considered making a carriage and creating a more comfortable space on the backs of the Horse Cultivators. After all, the Horse Cultivators of this world were strong and robust, so they should be able to handle it. However, these things naturally required some adjustments. Features for riders would be kept, while those for ordinary horses would be discarded.

Currently, Ding Rui could only rely on his experience from before transmigrating to create saddles and stirrups specifically for human cultivators. He couldn't account for other types of cultivators for now. There were also horseshoes, but after asking Ma Wen, Ding Rui understood that they didn't need them. The cultivation of Horse Cultivators primarily focused on their legs and hooves. These were not only the foundation of their existence but also their weapons against other cultivators. They had long been cultivated to be incredibly hard, to the extent that many materials in the sect domain couldn't compare.

...

Ding Rui led Ma Wen to a forest. After cutting down some trees, he planned to make saddles out of wood. Once the wood was carved into shape, it would need to be covered with a layer of leather, and soft material would be stuffed inside, making it comfortable for both the horse and the rider. But currently, he couldn't find any leather. As for the soft stuffing, he would have to think of another solution.

This made Ding Rui feel a bit strange. "Brother Ma, have you Horse Cultivators never thought of making something like this? Something that allows others to ride on your backs more securely?"

"Of course not!" Ma Wen shook his head. "We only started this business after coming to your sect more than seventy years ago. My mother told me that in the past, we Horse Cultivators wouldn't let anything on our backs at all, but life was too hard, so we eventually gave up on those principles."

"Alright," Ding Rui nodded, his hands still working, and asked again, "Where were you before you came to the sect?"

"On the other side of Huaqing Realm, but we were hunted by evil cultivators, so we had to migrate. We eventually came here and found it suitable for survival. My mother said that, I'm not too clear myself," Ma Wen replied.

"I see..." Through this conversation, Ding Rui gained a new understanding of the Huaqing Realm: it was vast. The Horse Cultivators of seventy years ago had never met them, and even if both sides had limited living space due to the presence of evil cultivators, it was enough to prove that the Huaqing Realm was indeed not a small place. At the same time, it raised another question for Ding Rui: "Since the Horse Cultivators entered the sect's territory more than seventy years ago, how long has the sect itself existed?" He asked Ma Wen this question, and Ma Wen's answer was, naturally, that it didn't know either. Ding Rui wasn't surprised by this; few cultivators around him valued history.

Carving was precise work. He could manage one with finesse, but using ten would leave him bewildered. In the end, only two of them were actually effective, and even then, they weren't particularly smooth. So, without batting an eyelid, he pretended to retract the other few golden-light spears back into his body, controlling only two for carving. A look of confusion appeared in Ma Wen's large eyes, but it ultimately didn't say anything that would embarrass Ding Rui.

A moment later, a brand-new and immediately usable saddle appeared in Ding Rui's hands. A satisfied smile spread across his face as he placed the saddle onto Ma Wen's back. It fit perfectly!

"Alright, Brother Ma, I'm going to try it out," Ding Rui said.

"Come on!" Although Ma Wen wasn't particularly optimistic about the saddle, it was slightly excited at the moment. What if it actually worked?

Ding Rui flipped onto its back, only to feel as if his entire body was squeezed into a tiny space. It was extremely uncomfortable, and he couldn't sit properly at all.

"Not enough space left for the person," Ding Rui knew where the problem lay. However, he didn't dismount immediately. Instead, he asked Ma Wen, "Brother Ma, how do you feel with this thing on your back? Are you used to it? Does it feel uncomfortable?"
