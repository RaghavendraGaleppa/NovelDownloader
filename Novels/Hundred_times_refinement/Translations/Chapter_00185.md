# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass  
Chapter 133: The Abyss of Extreme Demons  

"Is that so?"  

A cold voice echoed through the air, melodious yet icy to the core.  

Instantly, the entire Xianke Teahouse fell silent.  

Accompanied by light footsteps, a stunning woman appeared from the stairwell. Outwardly, she appeared no older than sixteen, yet her aura was restrained and profound.  

"Immortal Maiden Ouyang!"  

Someone gasped in recognition, and the teahouse erupted in murmurs. Ouyang Qinxin, an elder of the Biyun Mountain Sect—one of the few female cultivators in Youzhou who had reached the Core Formation stage.  

Her weapon was unique as well—an elegant harp. Yet, when paired with her cultivation techniques, it became a deadly instrument, far surpassing others of her level.  

Seeing Ouyang Qinxin again, Lin Xuan's eyes flickered with a hint of surprise, but he remained calm. Unless facing a Nascent Soul monster, no one could see through his Heavenly Demon Disguise Art.  

The teahouse quickly quieted down, the cultivators falling silent. Only the young scholar who had been bragging earlier now trembled, his face ashen.  

"What were you saying just now?"  

Ouyang Qinxin walked toward him slowly, her jade-like face betraying no emotion.  

"I... I..."  

The man stammered, hesitated for a moment, then suddenly formed a hand seal and transformed into a streak of yellow light, darting toward the window.  

Watching this, Lin Xuan's expression turned pitying. A mid-stage Qi Condensation rogue cultivator, relying on a low-grade spirit artifact, thought he could escape from a Core Formation expert like Ouyang Qinxin? It was nothing short of delusional.  

This was the height of foolishness.  

Trouble arises from careless words, and calamity stems from reckless actions. Speaking without restraint was already inviting disaster, and his response only made things worse.  

Had he sincerely apologized and begged for mercy, Ouyang Qinxin, given her status as a Core Formation elder, would likely have let him off with a minor lesson. But now...  

Ouyang Qinxin's delicate brows furrowed slightly, a flash of anger crossing her face.  

Without even lifting a hand, she merely flicked her sleeve, and a needle-thin red light shot forth.  

It struck the fleeing cultivator's escape light with pinpoint accuracy.  

A scream rang out as the scholar tumbled from mid-air, writhing on the ground in agony.  

Lin Xuan scanned him with his spiritual sense and found that the man's cultivation had been completely erased—reduced from a cultivator to an ordinary mortal.  

Ouyang Qinxin had shown mercy.  

Otherwise, given the ruthless nature of the cultivation world, any other Core Formation expert would have annihilated his soul rather than just stripping his power.  

Witnessing the might of a Core Formation cultivator, the others in the teahouse were utterly cowed.  

After Ouyang Qinxin took her seat, many quickly settled their bills and left.  

Lin Xuan hesitated briefly before departing as well.  

Once outside the market's boundaries, he wasted no time and took to the skies.  

Though encountering Ouyang Qinxin had piqued his curiosity—what business did this renowned Biyun Mountain elder have here? Could it be related to the stolen Seven-Star Grass?—as long as she didn't suspect him, there was no need for concern. His priority was returning to the mountain to refine the Yi Jin Pill and advance his cultivation.  

By dusk, Lin Xuan landed in a desolate wilderness.  

With no signs of human habitation for miles, he resigned himself to spending the night outdoors—a trivial matter for a cultivator.  

After scanning the area with his spiritual sense and confirming it was safe, he found a sheltered spot, lay down, and closed his eyes.  

At midnight, Lin Xuan suddenly awoke, his face tightening with surprise and wariness. Without hesitation, he swallowed a Concealing Spirit Pill to suppress his aura.  

He then retrieved an Invisibility Talisman from his storage bracelet and activated it, vanishing from sight.  

Just as he completed these preparations, a streak of white light appeared on the horizon, speeding toward him. Lin Xuan frowned—the aura felt familiar.  

The light landed about fifty feet away, revealing a middle-aged man in moon-white robes.  

His disheveled hair somehow gave him an air of effortless grace, but what stood out most was that he had only one arm—his left.  

The Sword Immortal of Taibai!  

Lin Xuan's heart skipped a beat as his mind raced. Meeting two key figures from Biyun Mountain in less than a day—was this truly just about the stolen Seven-Star Grass?  

Facing a late-stage Core Formation expert, Lin Xuan dared not be careless. He meticulously concealed his spiritual presence. Fortunately, the Concealing Spirit Pill was more effective than the unrefined Red Vine Grass solution, and his Nine Heavens Profound Art also included techniques to suppress one's aura.  

Combined, they ensured he remained undetected.  

After landing, Zhang Taibai sat cross-legged, seemingly meditating. Lin Xuan doubted the man had come to this wasteland to cultivate—he was clearly waiting for someone.  

As expected, about fifteen minutes later, another streak of purple light arrived, revealing a rather unkempt old man.  

The man was hideous—small eyes, a flat nose, large ears, and a grotesque skull emblem on his chest. What stood out most was the overwhelming killing intent radiating from him.  

A demonic cultivator!  

Lin Xuan frowned at the bizarre scene.  

Zhang Taibai, a righteous elder of Biyun Mountain known for his hatred of evil, secretly meeting a demonic cultivator in the dead of night? No one would believe it.  

Lin Xuan inwardly sighed—whatever shady dealings were happening here, he had stumbled upon them.  

The thought made him even more cautious. If discovered, he would undoubtedly be silenced.  

Neither Zhang Taibai nor this demonic cultivator (at the mid-stage Core Formation) were opponents he could hope to escape from.  

"Haha, Brother Zhang, it's been a while."  

Zhang Taibai opened his eyes, displeasure flashing in them as he stood. "You're late."  

"Apologies, I was delayed by some matters."  

Zhang Taibai's expression darkened further, but after a moment, he suppressed his anger. "Enough. Let's get to business. Did you bring it?"  

The demonic cultivator's playful demeanor vanished as he solemnly tossed a storage bag to Zhang Taibai.  

"This item was obtained by the Extreme Demon Venerable himself from the Western Extreme Sea at great cost."  

Ignoring the explanation, Zhang Taibai inspected the contents with his spiritual sense before tucking it away with satisfaction.  

"Brother Taibai, regarding the matter the Venerable entrusted to you..."  

"Relax. I've already arranged to meet Ouyang Qinxin. She'll be here within half an hour. What the Venerable seeks is in her possession."  

"It's truly with her?" The demonic cultivator's eyes gleamed with excitement, but he pressed for confirmation.  

"I've verified it thoroughly. Ouyang Qinxin is the sole survivor of the Ouyang Clan, exterminated three hundred years ago. The Heavenly Extremes Diagram is undoubtedly in her hands."  

"Excellent! Presenting the diagram to the Venerable will earn us great merit. He's promised to appoint you as deputy master of our Abyss of Extreme Demons."  

Lin Xuan's brow furrowed at the name.  

The Abyss of Extreme Demons was a demonic sect, but among Youzhou's factions, it was only mid-tier—nowhere near the Big Three. Why would Zhang Taibai, a high-ranking Biyun Mountain elder, covet such a minor position?  

"I appreciate the Venerable's kindness, but our transaction ends here. I provided the information about the diagram, and he gave me the Oceanic Algae to cure my ailment. As for the deputy position, I must decline."  

The demonic cultivator's face momentarily twisted with anger before smoothing into a smile. "Brother Zhang looks down on our sect? Under the Venerable's leadership these past hundred years, we've grown far stronger than we appear."  

"Oh?"  

"What you've seen is merely the tip of the iceberg. Though we may not rival the combined might of your three sects, one-on-one, even Biyun Mountain would pale in comparison."  

Zhang Taibai's eyebrows rose. His dealings with the Extreme Demon Venerable were purely for the Oceanic Algae to cure his condition—he had no intention of allying with demonic cultivators. Yet the man's boasting gave him pause.  

"Doubt me if you will, but the Venerable's offer stands. The Abyss of Extreme Demons welcomes you anytime. Think it over."  

With a cold snort, Zhang Taibai transformed into a streak of light and vanished into the night.
