# Chapter 103: The Landscape of Great Song

Lin Shan and his companion sped across the vast East Sea in their flying vessel, heading northeast at breakneck speed.  

After fleeing for most of the day without any pursuers in sight, they finally relaxed slightly. Setting the vessel to autopilot, Lin Shan leaned back to rest while Lin Fan replaced another mid-grade wind spirit stone—the third one they had used since leaving the capital.  

Lin Fan couldn’t help but voice his concern. "We’re running low on mid-grade wind spirit stones. Since leaving the capital, we’ve already burned through dozens."  

Noticing Lin Shan’s glance, he quickly added, "I mean, we could slow down a bit when things aren’t urgent..."  

But as soon as he spoke, their vessel passed over another island in the East Sea. A cultivator in demonic sect robes, clearly at the Foundation Establishment stage, immediately shot into the sky upon spotting them.  

"Never mind," Lin Fan sighed, swiftly switching back to manual control as the two resumed their frantic escape.  

---  

Over the next two days, they realized that nearly every island in the East Sea had been occupied by the three demonic sects. The Foundation Establishment cultivators stationed there seemed tasked with guarding their territories—most only gave brief chase before turning back when they couldn’t catch up quickly.  

"The East Sea has fallen completely. This will reshape the entire Great Song’s cultivation world. I must report this to the sect leader immediately!" Lin Fan grew increasingly anxious about the broader implications.  

As a member of the Purple Cloud Sect—the leading orthodox sect in Great Song—he had a vested interest in the balance of power. Lin Shan, however, remained indifferent. As a rogue cultivator, he cared little for the shifting tides of power. If anything, chaos meant more opportunities for him to grow stronger.  

This journey had already netted him an unprecedented windfall of ancient aura—over a hundred points in one go! His priority now was returning to Yi River and figuring out how to maximize these gains. Relying on powerhouses like Thunder Rain Child and Lin Fan was only a temporary solution; true strength had to come from within.  

As they traveled and chatted, another ten days passed before the capital of Great Song, Bianliang, finally came into view.  

---  

Upon arriving at the imperial palace, the two immediately sought out Thunder Cloud Child in the main hall and recounted their experiences over the past half-month.  

To their surprise, despite their haste to deliver the news, Thunder Cloud Child had already been informed.  

"I’m aware of the situation," he said gravely. "The three demonic sects have returned from the distant north with formidable resolve. Not only have they rallied remnants of their old forces within Great Song, but they’ve also allied with the Rain Pavilion from the South Sea. The East Sea is now entirely under their control."  

He explained that the East Sea, with its scattered islands and lack of major spiritual veins, had never been home to a dominant sect like the Purple Cloud Sect. Instead, it was a patchwork of minor factions and rogue cultivators—easy prey for the demonic sects’ coordinated assault.  

True top-tier sects required not only formidable techniques but also the resources to sustain their power—spiritual veins, crystals, and mines to nurture talent and build foundations. The Purple Cloud Sect, for instance, had been built over generations by gathering spiritual veins into a single location, resulting in dozens of spirit mountains that fortified their unity.  

The East Sea, fragmented by nature, had no such cohesion. It was the perfect first target for the demonic sects—a foothold from which to launch their campaign to retake Great Song.  

The ambush half a month ago had been meticulously planned, catching the three orthodox sects completely off guard.  

"What’s the sect’s response?" Lin Fan pressed for details on the high-level strategies.  

Thunder Cloud Child didn’t withhold information, even with Lin Shan listening. He advised Lin Fan to avoid the East Sea for now—the demonic sects’ occupation was a done deal.  

Somehow, they had convinced the Rain Pavilion to pin down the Beast Taming Valley in the inland regions, while the Yellow Springs Sect from the northern Great Yan had moved south, pressuring the Dry Cloud Pavilion.  

That left the Purple Cloud Sect as the only orthodox force capable of action. While they could hold their ground defensively, taking on all three demonic sects alone was impossible.  

With the situation still unclear, Thunder Cloud Child urged caution.  

Lin Fan then asked about his senior sister, Thunder Rain Child. Thunder Cloud Child admitted he didn’t know her whereabouts but assured him that a Nascent Soul elder had been dispatched to retrieve her.  

As for Bianliang, defensive formations had been prepared to withstand even Golden Core cultivators for a day or two if the demonic sects attacked.  

Orthodox sects and noble clans were also fortifying three defensive lines—the East Sea border, the Falling Pine Mountains, and Bianliang—to counter the demonic threat.  

As they spoke, two imperial Foundation Establishment cultivators entered the hall—one the elder who had once apprehended Lin Shan, the other a middle-aged man who had just returned from outside. They joined the discussion, equally concerned about the demonic sects’ resurgence.  

The group talked late into the night before dispersing.  

---  

Back in the side hall, Lin Fan prepared to bid farewell to Lin Shan, intending to return to the Purple Cloud Sect immediately.  

Emotionally, he clasped Lin Shan’s sleeve. "You and I, brothers united, will surely carve out a legend in the cultivation world!"  

Lin Shan recoiled, shaking off his grip. "Spare me the sentiment—I’m not into that!"  

After exchanging farewells, Lin Fan departed the capital that very night.  

---  

Lin Shan, however, lingered with unresolved frustration. The giant Black Lotus Buddha statue from Zangke County, hidden somewhere in the palace, gnawed at him.  

But with two Foundation Establishment cultivators guarding the palace, stealing it was impossible.  

After some thought, he decided to leave as well—lingering for an opportunity was too risky, especially if the demonic sects targeted the capital next.  

Before leaving, however, he made one last stop at the Nightingale headquarters, hoping to gather information on Princess Guo and perhaps find a way to eliminate her.
