# Chapter 47: Dragon Capture

Zhou Qing accompanied Zhishan out of the city, heading towards Qingfu Temple. Along the way, he inquired about Hu the Butcher's situation. Zhishan didn't need to intervene personally—his junior brothers were more than capable of handling it.

Having spent lonely years in the mountains, their fists had long itched for action.

Taoist priests practiced stillness and meditation. Martial training often stirred fiery tempers, and without the tempering effects of stillness and concentration, it was easy to provoke fatal conflicts.

Fortunately, under Zhishan's supervision, his three junior brothers were required to complete their daily meditative practices, ensuring their fiery natures didn't spiral out of control.

The two soon arrived at Qingfu Temple and entered an elegant bamboo cottage—the finest guest room the temple had to offer.

A young attendant opened the door. "Elder Zhishan, is this the physician?" The boy's eyes were dark and bright, like polished lacquer.

Zhou Qing smiled. "Not a physician, but I can treat illnesses."

"Not a physician, yet can treat illnesses?" The boy's small eyes widened in confusion, but he remained polite. "Please come in."

Inside, a burly man with a thick beard lay on the bed. Fusing sat nearby, eyes closed in meditation. He opened them only when Zhou Qing entered.

Zhou Qing noticed Fusing had heavy dark circles and looked exhausted. Surely this wasn't due to creating that palm technique inspired by "Overbearing Dragon Regrets"? Zhou Qing had advised him against it.

No way he'd take the blame for this.

Zhou Qing first greeted Fusing. The bearded man attempted to rise and bow, but Zhou Qing waved him down. "Please, rest."

The man complied, then turned to Fusing. "Elder Fusing, didn't you say your secular brother was a physician? An unordained lay practitioner?"

Fusing nodded. "Indeed, though he's rather young."

The bearded man suddenly felt like he'd boarded a pirate ship.

After a brief examination, Zhou Qing confirmed the man's injuries were severe. He could barely speak before passing out again.

Zhou Qing asked Fusing to step outside. "Who is he?"

"A martial artist from the Immortal Mist Sect—though the sect no longer exists. The boy is the sect leader's grandson. Can you heal him? He promised to teach us the Dragon Capture technique if you succeed."

"Dragon Capture? What kind of martial art is that?"

"The Immortal Mist Sect's signature skill—a grappling technique. Legend says their founder was a Xiantian realm master. Originally called Dragon Subduing Art, it degraded into Dragon Capture over generations. It's a top-tier grappling technique, perfect for refining my Eight Trigram Dragon Subduing Palm."

"So this is for you?"

"Do you want to learn it or not? Can you heal him or not?"

"I do."

Zhou Qing had been lacking a grappling technique to complement his Bear Form. Dragon Capture seemed tailor-made for it—how could he refuse?

"Can you really heal him?"

"He suffered a palm strike to his heart meridian from Iron Sand Palm. The Rejuvenation Manual mentions this. I can treat it, but it's too late—even healed, he'll live only twenty more years at most. If he keeps fighting, maybe ten."

Zhou Qing felt slightly guilty saying this. While theoretically sound, he'd never actually treated such an injury before. In theory, if he executed the treatment flawlessly, this would be the outcome.

But theory and practice were different beasts.

Back in his previous life, certain renowned hospital departments ranked among the world's best precisely because they'd treated countless patients—experience no foreign hospital could match.

Medical skills couldn't advance on theory alone.

Even if unpaid, Zhou Qing wanted to try. Treating a martial artist would provide invaluable firsthand insights into their cultivation—a living specimen.

After discussing with Fusing, Zhou Qing returned and removed the man's upper garments. He inserted needles at four acupoints: Purple Palace, Central Courtyard, Gate Origin, and Heavenly Pool. His Tiger-Crane Strength, incorporating Crane Strength's effects, enhanced the needle technique beyond the original.

Zhou Qing had always wondered why, in dramas, male physicians made female patients disrobe but not males. It made no medical sense. Perhaps due to physiological differences—though he'd never treated a woman.

An image of Miss Lin flashed through his mind. He steadied himself. With a teenager's body and vigorous qi-blood, having only interacted closely with her, such thoughts were natural.

Ah, he'd forgotten about Chunxiang.

His needle technique, practiced countless times in his mind, was executed with steady hands honed by Tiger Form and Tiger-Crane Fist. Even if Fushan were alive, Zhou Qing doubted he could do much better.

Though Zhishan insisted Fushan was merely missing, Fusing maintained he was dead. This second brother spoke fondly of their elder brother but clearly enjoyed being temple master too much to want him back.

As Fusing put it, everyone dies eventually. He wasn't wishing for Fushan's death—just acknowledging its inevitability.

Mid-thought, someone knocked. From his perch on the mulberry tree, Zhou Qing saw it was Chang Wanli.

He descended and opened the gate. "Master Zhou." Chang Wanli bowed, bearing gifts.

Zhou Qing welcomed him in. "You're back in Jiangzhou?"

Chang Wanli explained, mentioning how Squire Zhang returned home, saw it emptied, spat blood, and died on the spot.

Zhou Qing sighed. "The Zhangs were a scholarly family. To end like this... how wonderful."

Chang Wanli initially thought Zhou Qing sympathetic until that last phrase revealed his true feelings—a man of clear grudges and favors.

A true man's way.

Knowing the history between Zhou Qing and the Zhangs, Chang Wanli understood. Squire Zhang had actually praised Zhou Qing during their journey, begging Chang Wanli not to harm him—unaware of his family's fate.

Returning to such devastation proved too much.

Magistrate Feng, far away in Hengbo County, would deny any blame. Knowing Squire Zhang was a vegetarian Buddhist, he'd only served him watery porridge—thoughtful care. How could that be wrong?

If anyone was at fault, it was Buddha for inspiring such faith.

As night fell, Zhou Qing invited Chang Wanli to stay—a rare exception to his no-guests rule.

At midnight, an eerie wind swept through the Zhou residence, filling the courtyard with mournful wails.

In Hengbo County's yamen, Magistrate Feng received a letter and smiled. "Since Master Zhou recommended you, you may stay here. I'll arrange suitable work."

"Thank you, Your Honor."

Chang Wanli and the boy kowtowed.

Magistrate Feng gestured for them to rise. "No need for formalities between us. Given my friendship with Zhou, how could I treat you poorly? Unfortunately, I'm soon to become prefect of Hushan—otherwise I'd assign you a position today."

At "Hushan Prefect," Chang Wanli's eyes moistened.

Asked why, he explained his sect's destruction by Hushan water bandits.

Magistrate Feng sighed. "Such brutality—wiping out entire families. But bandits are fierce; we'll plan carefully. Truthfully, my promotion came from suppressing bandits."

Chang Wanli's heart swelled. This unassuming official was actually a capable bandit suppressor! Zhou's recommendation made perfect sense now.

A perfect match—his desire for vengeance and Magistrate Feng's expertise.

Overwhelmed with gratitude, Chang Wanli asked, "What exactly is Master Zhou's status?"

Magistrate Feng laughed. "You didn't know? He's the new Provincial Champion."

"Provincial Champion? A literary star descended from heaven?" Chang Wanli's mind reeled. A mere martial artist, he'd actually spent time with such an exalted scholar!

And Zhou had been so approachable, showing no official airs.

A Provincial Champion!

He gripped the boy's shoulders. "Young master, you must study hard. You've been touched by a champion's literary aura."

His sect's destruction cemented his belief—only scholarly achievement led to true security.

The Immortal Mist Sect was exterminated without official notice. Had it been a举人's family, the bandits would've faced immediate annihilation.

To the government, martial sects were mere local rich folk—insignificant.

After testing Chang Wanli's martial skills, Magistrate Feng grew more appreciative. With the world growing unstable, Hushan's prefecture would be challenging.

A nominal promotion, but its treacherous waters had sunk several predecessors. As a mere举人, he couldn't be picky.

His handling of Squire Zhang might have offended the Fiscal Commissioner, but in politics, one couldn't please everyone. To advance, one needed clear allegiances.

Supporting Zhou aligned him indirectly with Song He, who'd selected Zhou as champion.

Though Song might not know him yet, initiative would change that.

Yet Zhou seemed disinterested in officialdom—avoiding private visits to Song or Lu, even declaring he'd abstain from the imperial exams for ten years to study.

Why?

Zhou's ways seemed inscrutable.

But he'd offended neither. Song recently praised Zhou's purity at a banquet, while Lu's first act as Chief Justice was finalizing the Zhang servant's case—clear favor.

Unbeknownst to Magistrate Feng, Zhou's championship involved backroom dealings—he was Song and Lu's model scholar, a auspicious sign reported to the emperor. His refusal to network and dedication to study suited their purposes.

Had Zhou been ambitious and flamboyant, they'd have worried.

Magistrate Feng assigned Chang Wanli another task—returning Squire Zhang to Jiangzhou before he died in Hengbo County.

Merchants had described the Zhang family's ruin. After half a year of "medicine," returning home would surely kill the old man.

Dying at home—a fitting end.

The boy remained in Hengbo. Once Chang Wanli completed his mission, they'd all depart for Hushan.

Perched on the mulberry tree, Zhou Qing finally mastered Shadowless Kick.

Tiger-Crane Fist, Shadowless Kick, Rejuvenation Manual—he felt less like a Provincial Champion and more like Jiangzhou's Huang Feihong.

Though Huang's status paled next to a champion's, his fame was immense. Having watched many Huang Feihong films in his past life, Zhou idolized the folk hero.

In looks and skill, he now rivaled Jet Li's portrayal.

Such thoughts immersed him in the martial world he'd once yearned for.
