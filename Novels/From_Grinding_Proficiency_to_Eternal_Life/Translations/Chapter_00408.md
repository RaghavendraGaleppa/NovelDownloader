# Chapter 408: Unreasonable?

The three of them no longer hesitated, moving forward along the shadow of the city wall.

Every hundred zhang or so, they could see the heads of cultivators embedded in the wall, some still gnashing their teeth, crying out, and cursing.

These were the heads of Primordial Origin Sect disciples who had attempted to desert. After having their souls extracted and their spirits refined, they were made into "Warning Monuments."

As a Demonic Sect, it was perfectly normal for there to be deserting disciples, but being caught meant having one's tendons pulled and skin peeled.

When Xu Yunfan passed by a certain head, it suddenly opened its eyes and roared, "Master Hua..."

Before the words could finish, a silver needle shot out from Hua Ling's finger, piercing the disciple's Heavenly Spirit Gate.

"So noisy."

The young girl muttered as she pulled out the silver needle, the tip of which was hooked on a glowing Soul Pearl.

She casually tossed it to Li Ergou: "A reward for you."

Li Ergou hurriedly caught the Soul Pearl, but unable to withstand the resentment within, his palm was instantly covered in purple-black corpse spots.

He gritted his teeth and swallowed the Soul Pearl, a beast-like growl emitting from his throat.

When he raised his head again, his pupils had turned into vertical slits like a snake's. It took a good while for them to return to normal.

This thing was potent; naturally, it wasn't easy to refine.

Xu Yunfan watched coldly from the side. That Soul Pearl was no good thing. Although it could increase one's spiritual sense, the accumulation of resentful and malicious energy within it would inevitably turn one into a madman once it reached a certain quantity.

They traveled for some time longer.

"Ahead is the Demarcation Stele," Li Ergou said, staring at the black mist in the distance. "We can't use communication talismans past there. The Mirror of Detecting Demons from the Mystic Talisman Gate can track the energy fluctuations of us Primordial Origin Sect disciples."

Half of a broken stele could be faintly seen within the black mist.

The left side was carved with the two characters for "Primordial Origin," the strokes as sharp as if hacked by an axe.

The right side bore the four characters for "Ten Thousand Chariots Mystic Talisman," written with elegant grace.

Two completely different wills were clashing at the junction of the inscriptions, and the splashing sparks had burned honeycomb-like holes into the surrounding rocks.

Watching this scene, Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows slightly.

*This is interesting. I wonder how the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Primordial Origin Sect reached an agreement to carve their names on this boundary stele.*

Hua Ling suddenly grabbed Xu Yunfan's sleeve: "Senior Brother, I'm a little scared?"

Xu Yunfan's eyes shifted slightly. He reversed his grip and took Hua Ling's hand, comforting her in a soft voice: "Don't be afraid, Junior Sister. I'll protect you."

Sensing Xu Yunfan's actions, Hua Ling was taken aback for a moment, then broke into a smile through her tears, a hint of shyness on her face.

"It's great to have you, Senior Brother!"

Li Ergou, standing to the side: "..."

Hua Ling was just about to speak when Li Ergou suddenly tensed up: "Mystic Talisman Gate patrol!"

The black mist ten zhang away suddenly dispersed, and five streaks of sword light pierced through the air, arriving instantly.

The leader stood on a green jade flying sword, a standard-issue talisman pendant hanging from his waist.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over them.

One was at the seventh layer of Qi Refining, and four were at the early stages.

"Concealment Talisman!" Hua Ling hissed lowly.

The three of them activated their talismans simultaneously. A layer of clear light immediately covered their skin. Xu Yunfan circulated his true energy within, and under his Dragon Scale Armor, the faint aura of a turtle and snake rose from his skin, making his own presence even weaker.

"Who goes there?"

The Mystic Talisman Gate cultivator formed a hand seal and shouted sternly. Seven phantom light swords appeared behind him. "The Ancient Fly Road is sealed. Leave immediately!"

Hua Ling suddenly stumbled forward, the ruqun under the clear light having changed into coarse linen clothes at some point: "Immortal Master, save us!"

A token for an outer disciple of the Mystic Talisman Gate slid out from her sleeve. "We were gathering herbs when we encountered a Snow Demon..."

Xu Yunfan secretly marveled. *This acting, this pitiable look—if this were my past life, winning an Oscar would be a piece of cake.*

Moreover, the token in her hand was genuine. Hua Ling had actually managed to infiltrate the outer disciples of the Mystic Talisman Gate before.

He cooperatively supported the stumbling Li Ergou. The youth's face was now as pale as paper, and he had even disguised his eyes to look unfocused and injured.

The cultivator scrutinized the token in Hua Ling's hand and saw her pitiable state. He hesitated for a moment, his heart softening, and finally waved his hand to dismiss the light swords. "Leave quickly! Demonic cultivators have been rampant lately. Don't go any further north..."

His words cut off abruptly as he suddenly turned his head to look at Xu Yunfan: "Why is your aura so weak?"

Xu Yunfan was a bit stunned. *Is having a weak aura a crime too?*

*Is this reasonable or not?*

Hua Ling's silver bell vibrated silently.

Xu Yunfan knew this was the signal to attack, but he still tried to reason: "This junior... this junior killed a snow wolf the day before yesterday..."

"Lying!" The cultivator pointed with his sword finger, and seven light swords came howling towards him. "Die, demonic cultivator!"

Xu Yunfan sighed silently and pushed his right palm forward.

In an instant, the clear light on his body's surface turned into a dark golden hue. The True Martial Subduing Demon True Energy surged like a furious tide, and the edge of his palm was wreathed in the phantom of a turtle and snake coiling.

"Break!"

With a light shout, the cultivator's protective clear light shattered piece by piece like glass.

What was even more terrifying was that the Yin煞 True Energy Hua Ling had secretly planted in his body was now being forcibly activated by Xu Yunfan using the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture.

"Ah!"

The cultivator suddenly let out a blood-curdling scream, looking in terror as black patterns spread across his chest. Those patterns writhed like living things and covered his entire body in the blink of an eye.

He tried to form a hand seal to dispel them, only to find that two completely different types of true energy were fighting within his meridians.

One was a righteous, awe-inspiring Subduing Demon True Energy that was suppressing his own vital qi, while the other was a sinister, bone-corroding Hundred Desires True Energy that was frantically devouring his life force.

Hua Ling's face changed drastically.

She hadn't expected Xu Yunfan to turn her own true energy against her, nor had she expected him to be so familiar with the Hundred Desires Peak's techniques that he would detect the wisp of true essence she had planted.

Her heart was shaken, but she didn't dare to hesitate for a moment. As the silver bell vibrated urgently, the remaining four Mystic Talisman Gate disciples suddenly cried out in agony, clutching their heads.

"Go!"

She pulled Li Ergou and charged deeper into the ancient road.

Xu Yunfan followed closely behind, the muffled sound of the cultivator's body exploding echoing from behind.

The three of them ran for several miles before stopping.

Hua Ling's breathing was perfectly steady, and not a speck of dust had landed on her ruqun.

She tilted her head and sized up Xu Yunfan: "That 'Transplanting the Flower and Grafting the Tree' move you just used isn't something a sixth-layer Qi Refining cultivator should be able to do."

Xu Yunfan smiled without answering, merely saying: "Junior Sister's methods are truly impressive. They made even my scalp tingle."

Hua Ling said pitifully: "In the Sacred Sect, if you don't use some tricks, you can't survive."

That was the truth, and Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to reply.

At dusk, following the map they had exchanged for from the Primordial Origin Sect, the three of them finally saw the silhouette of a city wall in the distance.

The mortal city lay in the afterglow of the setting sun like a crouching giant beast, the torches插在 the bluestone city walls forming a winding dragon of fire.

"Frost Leaf City," Li Ergou said. "The northernmost mortal settlement under the jurisdiction of the Mystic Talisman Gate."

In a market outside the city, the silver bell at Hua Ling's fingertip trembled lightly, and immediately a hunchbacked old man emerged from the shadows of an alley.

The old man's palms, covered with age spots, opened up, revealing three bronze talisman tokens glowing with a dim light: "Three Immortal Masters, I have prepared the travel permits."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, unable to help but glance at Hua Ling. *This girl has connections everywhere.*

Subconsciously, he swept the tokens with his Martial Dao Heavenly Eye and discovered that they actually contained living human souls.

Hua Ling noticed his slight frown and her heart stirred. Understanding that Xu Yunfan had sensed something, she covered her mouth and laughed lightly: "Don't worry, Senior Brother. They're all from death row inmates."
