# Chapter 156: Moonlight Heart Seal and Evil-Absorbing Seal!

Gu Yuan gazed solemnly at the Dao statue before him.

"Boom!"

The spiritual energy within the statue surged continuously until, with a resounding explosion, it shattered the bottleneck of the early Foundation Establishment stage and ascended to mid-Foundation Establishment.

The spiritual energy rolled and spread endlessly, but at the same time, a torrent of demonic energy erupted. The statue's hair turned silver-white, its back sprouted vicious bone spikes, its skin became covered in jade-like armor, and its fingers elongated with razor-sharp nails. Its form had completely transformed into that of a half-demon.

"Whoosh!"

The evolution of the statue continued. The Dharma Pill absorbed the essence of the moon, causing the spiritual energy to grow even further while demonic energy poured out incessantly. Eventually, the statue's body expanded, its face twisted into a demonic visage, its muscles coiling like serpents, nearly transforming entirely into a demonic form with only traces of humanity remaining.

"Bang!"

As time passed, the spiritual light within the statue gradually dimmed until, with a final explosion, it shattered completely, turning to dust. All anomalies vanished.

"Truly an esoteric technique. Though the cultivation speed is astonishingly fast, the side effects are far too severe..."

Witnessing the spectacle, Gu Yuan couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh.

"However, it's not entirely without merit."

After the initial shock, Gu Yuan regained his composure, carefully analyzing the phenomena he had just observed.

"Though this method is unorthodox and alters the physical form, it doesn't corrupt the mind or spirit. It isn't an evil or demonic technique. The issue lies in the Dharma Pill's cultivation speed—far exceeding the practitioner's natural pace—causing the demonic energy to overwhelm the balance and induce physical mutations..."

Gu Yuan had scrutinized the test of the Six Ren Dharma Pill Golden Tome meticulously, observing every detail with his spiritual sense. At first glance, the transformation of the Dharma Pill into a demonic form seemed bizarre, but its essence wasn't inherently evil. Rather, it was more akin to an unintended side effect.

"The key is the Dharma Pill's cultivation speed—it's astonishingly swift. Even with just a single Ren Dharma Pill, the speed increases by at least twofold..."

This was the most alluring aspect for Gu Yuan.

With the Dharma Pill, he could save decades of arduous cultivation and countless elixirs—an invaluable advantage in the path of cultivation.

"Perhaps it's precisely because the cultivation speed is so rapid, unlike orthodox methods, that it leads to these side effects and mutations into a demonic form..."

Gu Yuan pondered deeply, lost in thought.

The side effects of the Dharma Pill were evident, but not entirely unacceptable.

"If I could find a way to purify the demonic energy within the Dharma Pill or slow the cultivation speed, perhaps the mutations could be prevented?"

---

A single Ren Dharma Pill already offered such speed—what would happen if all six were activated?

No wonder the golden tome proclaimed, "With the Six Ren perfected, one may form a True Pill, and even glimpse the Golden Core realm!"

At such a pace, reaching the Golden Core realm was indeed within reach.

The only cost was relinquishing one's human form and becoming a half-demon, half-human hybrid.

Setting aside the side effects, this was truly an unorthodox yet uniquely effective cultivation method.

However, Gu Yuan had no desire to mutate his body.

"In that case, I must find a way to refine this technique or use other methods to expel the demonic energy..."

But given his current level, refining the technique was nearly impossible. His only option was to seek a method to purge the demonic energy, offering a slim chance to practice this technique.

"Not only do I need a method to cleanse the demonic energy, but I also require more Daoist statues for further testing to confirm its safety before cultivation..."

After much deliberation, Gu Yuan still found the task daunting.

"Altering one's cultivation aptitude is no simple feat..."

With a sigh, Gu Yuan shook his head slightly and began meditating, setting aside his worries for now.

Brooding was futile—he would explore the market tomorrow and see what he could find.

---

The night passed uneventfully.

After a day of meditation, Gu Yuan opened his eyes and sighed, sensing almost no change in his spiritual energy.

After a brief wash, he set out with Xiang Di to continue exploring the market.

Though he had attended the Myriad Forms Auction the previous day, that had been a curated event. The true market was far more expansive, with countless treasures yet to be discovered.

"Esteemed guest, this is the 'Thousand Techniques Hall,' the largest repository of cultivation methods in the market. The Endless Isles Sea is rife with outlaws—rogue cultivators, exiled sect disciples, and lone survivors of fallen sects all gather here. The techniques available surpass even those of the Western Sea Region, including many rare and forbidden arts."

"Opposite is the 'Mystic Realm Pavilion,' which also houses numerous secret techniques. Beyond these two, there are also stalls run by rogue cultivators, where unusual methods occasionally appear. If you seek rare techniques, this is the place to explore."

Xiang Di enthusiastically introduced the sights as if reciting from memory.

Observing the bustling market, Gu Yuan nodded and handed Xiang Di ten spirit stones before dismissing him.

Though unafraid of rogue cultivators' schemes, he remained cautious, preferring to explore alone.

---

The Thousand Techniques Hall was a grand, towering edifice staffed by charming female cultivators at the Qi Refining stage.

As soon as Gu Yuan entered, a portly elder in luxurious robes sensed his presence and greeted him warmly.

"Esteemed guest, please come this way!"

In the Endless Isles Sea, where Golden Core cultivators were rare, Foundation Establishment cultivators commanded respect. Despite the frequent conflicts and deaths among them, they still received preferential treatment wherever they went.

Gu Yuan followed the elder to an elegant chamber on the third floor, where they sat as a maid served spiritual tea.

"Please, enjoy!"

The elder said cordially.

"No need for formalities."

Gu Yuan declined the tea with a calm tone.

Unfazed, the elder smiled and asked, "What techniques are you seeking today?"

Gu Yuan got straight to the point. "Do you have any methods to expel demonic energy and prevent it from corrupting the body?"

"Expel demonic energy and prevent corruption?"

"Is it from an Earth Demon or an ordinary demonic beast?"

The elder repeated the question thoughtfully before clarifying.

"Earth Demon."

Frowning slightly, the elder quickly retrieved three jade slips and displayed them in the air before Gu Yuan.

"The Endless Isles Sea is frequently plagued by demonic beasts attacking humans. Some possess innate abilities that can corrode or mutate human bodies with mere demonic energy. Over the years, our hall has collected many methods to expel demonic energy, but only three are effective against Earth Demons."

"The first is an elixir method—'Demon-Slaying Pill.' Its potency is fierce, capable of eradicating all invasive demonic energy. However, its effects are short-lived, suitable only for acute cases of demonic corruption."

"The second is the 'Moonlight Heart Seal,' which harnesses lunar essence to purify all demonic energy, gentle yet potent."

"The third is the 'Evil-Absorbing Seal,' a technique to forge a seal that devours demonic energy. Not only can it absorb all invasive demonic energy, but it can also be wielded as a weapon—a truly mystical art."

"These three methods are the finest selections of our hall. Which would you prefer?"

"I'll take the two seal techniques."

Demonic energy corruption was a gradual process. Cultivating the Six Ren Dharma Pill Golden Tome would inevitably generate continuous demonic energy, making the elixir method impractical. Only the latter two seals could potentially purify the energy.

---

Yet, possessing these two techniques alone wasn't enough. Without further testing, Gu Yuan dared not practice them recklessly.

He needed more Daoist statues for experimentation.

Most crucially, after purchasing the two seals, Gu Yuan's purse was nearly empty...

Without funds, progress was impossible.

After a while, Gu Yuan left the Thousand Techniques Hall with the two seal techniques in hand.

Gazing at the bustling market and his depleted storage pouch, he sighed helplessly.

"It seems I'll have to return to my old ways..."
