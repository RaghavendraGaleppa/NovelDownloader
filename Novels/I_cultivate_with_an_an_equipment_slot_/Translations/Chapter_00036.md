# Chapter 36: Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword  

"What?"  

The red-faced cultivator was startled by Zhang Yan's words.  

Before he could react, he saw Zhang Yan point a finger, and a dazzling sword light shot from his hand with astonishing speed.  

Seeing how quickly Zhang Yan had cast the spell, the red-faced cultivator felt a twinge of unease. How could the spell be so fast?  

However, when he clearly saw the spell, he couldn't help but chuckle.  

"I thought it was some powerful spell, but it's just the Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword Art?" The red-faced cultivator almost burst into laughter at Zhang Yan's choice of attack.  

The Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword was indeed famous—  

It consumed little spiritual energy, was fast to cast, could be aimed with pinpoint accuracy, and was practically perfect for exterminating pests.  

But that was its purpose—exterminating pests.  

Using it against a human opponent was almost laughable because all those advantages came at a cost: its power was pitifully weak.  

Even an ordinary person wouldn’t be killed by it unless it struck a vital spot like the neck or heart, let alone a cultivator.  

So when the red-faced cultivator saw Zhang Yan attacking him with the Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword, he nearly snorted with amusement.  

Seems like this kid only knows this one spell!  

"Time to show you the might of a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator!" The red-faced cultivator took out a talisman, which shattered in midair, forming a transparent shield in front of him.  

Though he didn’t fear the Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword’s power, he wasn’t foolish enough to stand there and take the hit. A shield was necessary—what if he got unlucky?  

Now that he had the shield, he could leisurely finish off Zhang Yan.  

"Gotta be careful not to damage the spirit boat when I attack," the red-faced cultivator thought greedily, eyeing the vessel.  

Meanwhile—  

Zhang Yan’s Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword had already reached its target.  

*Pfft.*  

A soft sound echoed.  

The red-faced cultivator stared in disbelief at the hole in his supposedly impenetrable shield—one that could withstand mid-stage Qi Refining spells!  

How could a mere Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword pierce it?!  

"Stone Skin Technique!!!" the red-faced cultivator roared, his skin instantly turning pale and hardening like marble.  

He didn’t know what was wrong with Zhang Yan’s Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword, but he knew one thing—if that sword hit him, he was in serious trouble!  

---  

*Ssshh!*  

After piercing the shield, the Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword continued unimpeded, striking the red-faced cultivator’s chest. His stone-like skin cracked open, blood splattering everywhere.  

Fortunately, the sword’s energy was exhausted, and the strike didn’t kill him.  

But before the red-faced cultivator could even feel relief, he heard the sharp whistling of air. Looking up, his red face turned ashen.  

Zhang Yan’s fingers never stopped moving.  

One after another, Gengjin Grass Pheasant Swords shot toward him like a golden rain of blades. Just the sight of it sent chills down his spine.  

This was another trait of the Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword—  

Its casting speed was absurdly fast.  

It required almost no preparation, allowing rapid successive attacks.  

And Zhang Yan, after firing the first sword, had immediately followed up with thirteen more.  

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*  

Though the red-faced cultivator had barely survived the first strike, the next thirteen were impossible to block. In the end, his body was riddled with holes.  

A late-stage Qi Refining cultivator—dead!  

Though the fight seemed drawn out, it had only lasted a few breaths.  

Just as the red-faced cultivator fell—  

Liu Yiting, lying unconscious on the Greenwood Boat, let out a faint groan, her eyelids fluttering as if she might wake.  

Without hesitation, Zhang Yan kicked her in the head, knocking her out again.  

Then, he turned his attention to the red-faced cultivator’s corpse. With a flick of his finger, another Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword blasted a hole through the man’s skull.  

Only after confirming the kill did Zhang Yan approach to loot the body.  

He took the storage pouch and the paper kite artifact before igniting the corpse with a Fire Snake spell.  

The entire process was smooth and efficient.  

Without wasting time, he boarded the Greenwood Boat and continued toward the market.  

"Lucky that pale-faced cultivator didn’t show up. Fighting two at once would’ve been impossible."  

Despite his victory, Zhang Yan felt no joy—only lingering fear.  

His success had hinged on three factors:  

First, the red-faced cultivator was only at the early stages of the seventh layer of Qi Refining, barely qualifying as a late-stage cultivator.  

Second, he had severely underestimated Zhang Yan’s Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword Art.  

Third—and most crucially—  

Zhang Yan had the advantage of his Equipment Bar.  

To deal with the red-faced cultivator, he had equipped the Golden Bamboo Sword, the Spirit Hoe, the Purple Spirit Hammer, and other items—each enhancing his attack.  

The Spirit Hoe had a *Sharpness* attribute.  

The Golden Bamboo Sword had both *Sharpness* and *Sword Qi* attributes.  

And the Purple Spirit Hammer, though lacking *Sharpness*, had *Brute Force* and *Armor Penetration*.  

With all these stacked effects, his normally weak pest-extermination spell had transformed into something terrifying.  

"Thank goodness I bought the Purple Spirit Hammer."  

The *Armor Penetration* attribute had been invaluable. Without it, breaking through the shield would’ve been nearly impossible.  

"Also, it’s lucky he didn’t use any artifacts." That was another stroke of fortune. The red-faced cultivator had likely held back to avoid damaging the Greenwood Boat.  

Otherwise, killing him wouldn’t have been so easy.  

But in the end—  

Victory was all that mattered.  

The enemy was dead.  

And Zhang Yan was the winner.  

On the way to the market, he remained hyper-vigilant. If the pale-faced cultivator appeared now, he’d be in real trouble.  

Fortunately, his worries were unfounded.  

Only when he finally saw the distant outline of Qingheng Market did his tense nerves finally relax.  

The area within two hundred miles of Qingheng Market was a safe zone, patrolled by guards to keep out bandits and monsters.  

After all, a business had to ensure its customers felt secure.  

Upon arrival, Zhang Yan disembarked, paid Liu Yiting’s spirit stone fee, and hurried straight to the market’s central hub—  

The Qingheng Sect’s outpost, guarded by a Golden Core elder and staffed with inner disciples and Foundation Establishment overseers.  

Presenting his identity token and explaining the situation, the gatekeeping disciple’s face twisted in outrage:  

"Those scoundrels dare attack our Qingheng Sect members? Wait here, junior brother. I’ll report this to the elders immediately—they’ll pay dearly for this!"
