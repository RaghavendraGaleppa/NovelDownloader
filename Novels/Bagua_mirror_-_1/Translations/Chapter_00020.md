# Chapter 20: Cangwu Mountain  

Qin Chong walked back to his residence, feeling deeply frustrated.  

His frustration wasn't about the broken engagement but rather the string of troubles that had befallen him in just two days since his return. He even wondered if he had offended the God of Misfortune this year.  

In his past life, he would have clung desperately to such a beautiful woman who came to him willingly. But now, his mindset had changed. His sole focus was on cultivating his strength and abilities because he understood clearly that only with formidable power could he truly secure everything else.  

Without it, all he had now would be nothing more than fleeting illusions—flowers in a mirror or the moon reflected in water.  

The following days passed peacefully for Qin Chong. During the day, he studied the jade slips in his possession, absorbing knowledge about cultivation—foundational techniques, alchemy, artifact forging, formations, talismans, and even the basics of controlling insects and taming beasts. Though much of it wasn't immediately useful, he knew these skills would be indispensable in the future.  

Preparing in advance was far better than scrambling at the last moment.  

Before he knew it, over a month had passed. Qin Chong rarely left his residence, though Qin Peng visited occasionally, and Qin Fei dropped by twice. This quiet life suited him well.  

Yet, trouble eventually came knocking.  

In the main hall, only Qin Hao and Qin Chong were present.  

"What? The Canglong Valley is issuing another conscription order?" Qin Chong exclaimed in disbelief.  

"There’s no helping it," Qin Hao sighed. "Our family is insignificant to the Canglong Valley, but we must rely on them. Without their protection, we wouldn’t last long here."  

"What do they want this time?"  

"The Cangwu Mine."  

"That cursed place?" Qin Chong muttered reluctantly, though inwardly, he was delighted.  

This was a heaven-sent opportunity. With the Eight Trigrams Space in his possession, wasn’t this akin to someone delivering spirit stones straight to him?  

"I know it’s difficult for you," Qin Hao said apologetically, "but there’s no other choice. Your Third Uncle and Seventh Uncle handle critical family affairs, Qin Peng and Qin Fei are still too young, and your Sixth Granduncle is too old with little lifespan left. As for the two nominal guest elders—they’re out of the question."  

"You’re right. I’m the only idle one left."  

"What pains me most is your cultivation progress. The fact that you’ve been stuck for so long—"  

"Never mind. I’ll go."  

"But you must be cautious. The Cangwu Mine is located in the Cangwu Mountains, at the edge of the Canglong Valley’s territory. It’s not a peaceful place. Focus on self-preservation—don’t provoke conflicts."  

"I’ll remember that."  

As Qin Chong turned to leave, Qin Hao let out a helpless sigh.  

Once back in his quarters, Qin Chong couldn’t suppress his joy and burst into laughter.  

*Heaven is truly on my side!*  

These past few days, he had been racking his brain for an excuse to leave the family. Now, just as he was dozing off, someone had handed him a pillow.  

Though life in the family was comfortable, it hindered his cultivation. To conceal his rapid progress, he had to carefully suppress his aura. But now, after three years away, even if he returned as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he could easily explain it away.  

Thinking of spirit stones, Qin Chong immediately sent his divine sense into the Eight Trigrams Space.  

The low-grade spirit stones he had placed on the golden soil had absorbed more spiritual energy, though they were still far from reaching mid-grade. At this rate, it would take two or three years for them to advance.  

As for using his own mana to accelerate the process, Qin Chong wasn’t inclined to do so yet. He already had a few mid-grade spirit stones prepared for emergencies.  

Using mana to upgrade stones was too taxing at his current level. Once he reached Foundation Establishment, it would be much easier.  

He had also placed a few spirit ores in the golden soil, though their progression was even slower. But Qin Chong wasn’t in a hurry—for a cultivator, time was something he could afford.  

In ten days, he would need to gather in Pingyang City. Qin Chong decided to head there early to make preparations.  

With nearly a thousand spirit stones and some low-grade materials on hand, he had enough to acquire some additional means of self-defense. As for magic tools, he already had one high-grade and two mid-grade ones—one offensive, one defensive—which would suffice for now.  

He planned to stock up on offensive talismans and, if possible, acquire a low-grade concealment and defensive formation. That would make his travels much more convenient.  

However, such formations were hard to come by—either their effects were mediocre or the better ones were exorbitantly priced. Still, if he found one to his liking, he wouldn’t hesitate to spend a few mid-grade spirit stones.  

The next afternoon, Qin Chong arrived in Pingyang City again.  

After browsing the market without success, he decided to try his luck at the Green Cloud Pavilion as evening approached.  

"Ah, Fellow Daoist Qin! Welcome back!"  

Coincidentally, it was Qing’er again—the same attendant from last time.  

"Good to see you."  

"What can I assist you with today?"  

Since Qin Chong had purchased a high-grade magic tool and even provided a century-old Blood Spirit Fruit during his last visit, Qing’er had earned a hefty commission. Naturally, she was even more enthusiastic this time, even lightly looping her arm around his as she led him inside.  

Qin Chong paid it no mind.  

"I’m looking for a low-grade formation—one with
