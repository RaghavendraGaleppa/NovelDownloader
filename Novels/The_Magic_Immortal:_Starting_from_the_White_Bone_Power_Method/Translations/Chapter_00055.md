# Chapter 55: The Auction  

After bidding farewell to the floral-skirted female cultivator, Wang Chan first paid a transaction fee of one thousand fa coins and received a token before preparing to leave the hall.  

The exit was located at the back of the trading hall.  

Wang Chan had initially worried about being followed after leaving, given the underhanded tactics often employed in the rivalry between the trading hall and other shops.  

Although he assumed the trading hall would have considered such risks, making the likelihood low, it was still wise to remain cautious.  

Just as he was about to arm himself fully before stepping out, he was stopped by a guard who invited him to pass through a pale golden formation at the exit.  

Upon closer inspection, Wang Chan saw eighty-one intricate restriction patterns shimmering on the golden formation's light screen.  

This was actually a top-grade formation with a full array of restrictions.  

The trading hall truly had deep pockets.  

After some inquiry, he learned that this top-grade formation was designed to detect any marks or tracking spells.  

Its purpose was to ensure that those who entered the trading hall wouldn't be secretly marked or targeted by other cultivators inside.  

While such actions were strictly prohibited within the trading hall—and anyone caught marking others would face severe consequences—some might still take the risk.  

Though they wouldn’t dare act openly within the trading hall due to its strict rules, leaving marks to track targets outside the black market was another matter.  

Hence, this precaution was in place.  

If the formation detected any marks or spells, the bearer could enter another hidden formation to have them removed free of charge.  

If even that formation failed, experts could be summoned to handle the issue personally.  

Moreover, to prevent traders from being followed after leaving, the exits led to various concealed tunnels that branched out in different directions.  

The service was... impressively thorough.  

An incense stick’s time later, Wang Chan emerged from the backyard of an inconspicuous small shop nearly eight miles away from the trading hall, marking his official departure.  

Despite the trading hall’s formation check, Wang Chan still cast a set of Thunder Sealing Spells on himself and used his Black Needle Qi to scan his body for any lingering marks.  

Only after confirming nothing was amiss did he swiftly leave.  

Soon after, Wang Chan altered his appearance and returned to the trading hall, heading to the consignment area to sell off the items he no longer needed.  

Since consignment took time, he decided to explore other parts of the black market.  

Now flush with fa coins, he didn’t hold back as much as before. If he came across something valuable, novel, or useful, he wouldn’t hesitate to make a purchase.  

For example, a bottle of Hundred Flowers Spirit Wine for thirty fa coins, Clear Cold Spirit Springwater extracted from thousand-year-old profound ice, or mid-grade Jade Fruits.

**The next morning...**  

Wang Chan returned to the trading hall to check on the progress of his consigned items using his token.  

To his surprise, everything had been sold overnight.  

Though he hadn’t set exorbitant prices, the speed at which his items were sold spoke volumes about the trading hall’s efficiency.  

After deducting the 20% commission, he walked away with over nine thousand fa coins.  

He had expected to pay a 30% fee, but transactions worth over ten thousand fa coins were considered merely average here.  

After carefully inspecting the fa coins to ensure they were genuine, Wang Chan clasped his hands in farewell to the plump, richly dressed manager—a refined late-stage Qi Refining cultivator who resembled a wealthy landlord.  

As Wang Chan turned to leave, the manager called out, "Fellow Daoist, wait! Would you like to attend an auction?"  

"Oh?" Wang Chan raised an eyebrow, intrigued.  

Who would’ve thought that a wilderness rogue cultivator like him would one day be invited to an auction—even if it was in the black market?  

"The westernmost part of the black market has a newly opened auction house. Tonight, they’ll be hosting an event with five highlight items, including top-grade magical artifacts, top-grade pills, and mid-grade soul-type artifacts..."  

Seeing Wang Chan’s interest, the manager discreetly produced a dull iron token.  

"For twelve hundred fa coins, this token is yours."  

Twelve hundred?  

Wang Chan was stunned. He actually had one of these tokens in his storage bag.  

He had planned to discard miscellaneous items before leaving the black market, never realizing this token was valuable.  

And that auction—it even had mid-grade soul-type artifacts?  

Wang Chan was tempted.  

Moreover, the fact that the trading hall was promoting the auction suggested they shared the same owner.  

"Fellow Daoist, don’t think it’s expensive. This token is the only way to enter the auction. Only two hundred and seventy seats were available, and most were snapped up early. If not for my friend’s sudden change of plans, this token wouldn’t be here."  

"Is it anonymous?"  

"The auction house only recognizes the token, not the person."  

"Ah..." After a long hesitation, Wang Chan sighed and politely declined, feigning regret as he left.  

---  

The black market had no distinction between day and night—only an eerie, perpetual gloom.  

Having spent less than two days here, Wang Chan already felt stifled.  

To lift his spirits and celebrate his windfall, he splurged over thirty fa coins on a lavish meal at a high-end restaurant.  

As he was about to leave, a handsome young attendant discreetly slipped a stack of jade slips into his sleeve.  

Each slip, about half a palm in size, bore lifelike images of alluring female cultivators. Though dressed modestly, their expressions were unmistakably seductive.  

When infused with a trace of spiritual energy, the images even moved, swaying enticingly.  

Wang Chan retreated to a secluded corner and thoroughly "critiqued" all nine jade slips before crushing them to dust with a single motion.  

Even if the black market’s courtesans paid him, he wouldn’t dare indulge—who knew what dangers lurked behind them?  

---  

**At the hour of Xu (7-9 PM)...**  

After deploying multiple disguise techniques, Wang Chan transformed into an ordinary-looking man with melancholic eyes.  

Holding the iron auction token, he arrived at the auction house entrance.  

Two armored guards—both late-stage Qi Refining cultivators—stood at the door.  

One took Wang Chan’s token and inserted it into a groove on a disc-like artifact.  

To Wang Chan’s astonishment, the previously unremarkable token emitted a strange glow.  

He marveled at the auction house’s methods—despite scrutinizing the token earlier, he hadn’t detected anything unusual.  

"Please," the guard said, returning the token.  

Upon entering the grand hall, a veiled female attendant—an early-stage Qi Refining cultivator—greeted him warmly.  

Despite his low cultivation level, she treated him with utmost respect, guiding him to a private room where premium tea, wine, and pastries were served.  

She even offered a massage.  

Given that his token had cost twelve hundred fa coins, such treatment was expected.  

Wang Chan, deciding to embrace local customs, allowed her delicate fingers to work their magic.  

As the hour of Hai (9-11 PM) approached...  

While the attendant fed him spirit grapes, another maid announced the auction’s imminent start.  

Wang Chan stood, and the attendant naturally linked arms with him, escorting him to the auction venue.  

Only at the entrance did he realize attendants weren’t allowed inside.  

Observing others, he saw cultivators tipping their attendants anywhere from ten to fifty fa coins—some even copping a feel, eliciting coy giggles.  

Following suit, Wang Chan handed his attendant twenty-five fa coins, giving her a light, respectful pat before passing through the entrance’s inspection.  

The auction hall was vast, enveloped by a second-grade formation.  

Over two hundred private booths were arranged in tiered rows, each with its own entrance.  

Inside his booth, Wang Chan discovered the formation-generated light screen provided both defense and privacy.  

Testing it, he found neither spiritual energy nor divine sense could penetrate the screen.  

Even his White Needle technique left no mark.  

Interestingly, he could see out, but outsiders couldn’t see in.  

Whether the hidden second-grade formation was low or mid-tier, its sophistication was undeniable.  

"The first auction item: the mid-grade artifact **Gale Shuttle**, capable of both flight and defense, with twenty-nine restriction layers. Starting bid—four thousand fa coins. Minimum increment—one hundred fa coins."  

As Wang Chan poured himself tea in Booth 96, the auctioneer—a bearded man—cut straight to the chase without preamble.
