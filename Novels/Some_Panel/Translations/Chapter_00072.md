# Chapter 71: I Will Complete Our Sect's Techniques

“Supreme, don't trade with him,” Yang Ji transmitted his voice.

“Little Ji, this is a great opportunity. If we miss it, who knows what harsh conditions he’ll propose next time,” Supreme Whitebrow pondered as he transmitted his voice.

“Supreme, just have him hand over the jade slip for a look,” Yang Ji transmitted. He clearly saw that Supreme Qingyuan’s head displayed he had only brought three scrolls of the Golden Light Traversing Skill. As far as he knew, there were a total of five scrolls of the Golden Light Traversing Skill. This Supreme Qingyuan was clearly looking to take advantage.

If Supreme Whitebrow showed enough eagerness, he would likely haggle for an even higher price.

Supreme Whitebrow understood, smiling, “Brother Qingyuan, please bring out the Golden Light Traversing Skill.”

Supreme Qingyuan smiled, then produced a jade slip with a flick of his wrist. However, he made no further move, instead smiling, “The Golden Light Traversing Skill is right here, Brother Bai. I’ll exchange it for your sect’s Grand Heaven Teleportation first.”

“One jade slip?” Supreme Whitebrow slightly furrowed his brow.

“That’s right. This first jade slip contains the first scroll of the Golden Light Traversing Skill, in exchange for your sect’s Grand Heaven Teleportation. Furthermore, I have two more on me, to be exchanged for your sect’s True Adamant Divine Art and Gui Cang Sword Art, respectively.”

Supreme Qingyuan smiled faintly.

Unseen, Supreme Whitebrow’s expression had already darkened. Years ago, he had said countless good words and promised endless benefits to acquire this Golden Light Traversing Skill, but all had been in vain.

Now that a genius had emerged from the Evergreen Sect, he thought Supreme Qingyuan had finally seen the light and was willing to sincerely exchange techniques for the sake of his disciples.

Little did he know, he still had the same cunning demeanor, only bringing the first three scrolls.

Supreme Whitebrow glanced at Supreme Qingyuan, who showed no blush or racing heart, and smiled meaningfully, “Qingyuan, you want to exchange one scroll of Golden Light Traversing Skill for one of my sect’s profound divine abilities, and three scrolls to exchange for all of them? What a shrewd plan you have.”

“Brother Bai, weren’t these the conditions you proposed? We’re exchanging one for one,” Supreme Qingyuan feigned an innocent, startled expression.

“I abandoned the idea of a trade years ago. Now you’ve come knocking, and I was genuinely willing to make a sincere exchange with you. But you still have this insatiably greedy look. Do you think my Canglan Sect can’t survive without the Golden Light Traversing Skill?” Supreme Whitebrow retorted with a smile.

“Brother Bai, don’t be angry. How can you say I’m insatiably greedy? These were the conditions you proposed yourself. One for one,” Qingyuan chuckled.

Seeing Supreme Qingyuan shamelessly taking advantage, with a thick skin truly rare in the world, even Yang Ji couldn't help but glance sideways.

Supreme Whitebrow merely scoffed inwardly, maintaining his composure as always, and smiled, “The ‘one for one’ I spoke of was one profound divine ability for another profound divine ability, not one scroll of your Golden Light Traversing Skill for one of my sect’s profound divine abilities.”

“Ah, Brother Bai, my apologies, I misunderstood. In that case, I will exchange my sect’s Nine Tribulation Palm for your sect’s Grand Heaven Teleportation,” Supreme Qingyuan said with an embarrassed look, then flicked his wrist and produced five jade slips, appearing quite straightforward.

Misunderstood? It was merely his nature to take advantage, a habit he couldn’t change. No one would believe his nonsense.

Immediately, a True Monarch secretly frowned and transmitted to Supreme Whitebrow, “Supreme, what his Evergreen Sect lacks is a movement technique. His visit this time is clearly not genuinely to exchange the Golden Light Traversing Skill with us, but to exchange the Nine Tribulation Palm for the Grand Heaven Teleportation. This way, he completes his techniques, while our sect still lacks a speed-type divine ability. He gets the benefit.”

“I know,” Supreme Whitebrow had already seen through his intentions. He had still underestimated Supreme Qingyuan’s shamelessness, thinking that by coming to him, he would genuinely trade techniques. He never expected him to still play petty tricks as usual.

He looked at the smiling Supreme Qingyuan, pondered, and calmly said, “If you want to exchange for Grand Heaven Teleportation, you can. Bring all the scrolls of the Golden Light Traversing Skill for the exchange, not just one.”

To complete the sect’s techniques, Supreme Whitebrow still held back his temper and did not try to raise the price or anger Supreme Qingyuan, maintaining his due rationality and responsibility.

But what seemed like a fair exchange, in Supreme Qingyuan’s eyes, was as if he was being greatly taken advantage of.

“Golden Light Traversing Skill for Grand Heaven Teleportation? No!” Supreme Qingyuan shook his head, refusing flatly.

Only he, Qingyuan, could take advantage of others; how could others take advantage of him? Even a fair exchange was unacceptable.

Because once the exchange was made, the Canglan Sect would basically have completed its techniques, and he certainly didn’t want to see the Canglan Sect prosper.

Otherwise, if Supreme Whitebrow had offered so many benefits years ago, he would have agreed long ago. Why wait until now?

“No? Then please leave. I will not accept any other conditions,” Supreme Whitebrow said blandly.

“Heh, Whitebrow, are you trying to spite me? My disciple has a Spirit Physique aptitude. If he enters a Dao Sect, he’ll be valued far more than nephew Changxiao. If he’s taken as a disciple by a great expert, what profound divine ability or technique wouldn’t he have? When the time comes, if he lends nephew Changxiao a hand, how could Changxiao not have a smooth path to immortality? Your Canglan Sect would also receive immense benefits. My visit this time is an opportunity for your sect.”

Supreme Qingyuan deliberately stretched out his words, laughing, as if afraid that the people in the hall couldn't hear him.

It was as if he was saying, “Look! Think carefully about the stakes involved.”

Supreme Whitebrow coldly snorted inwardly, having completely seen through his true colors, and immediately said:

“What? Judging by your words, I have to curry favor first, and offering the Grand Heaven Teleportation would be an honor for my sect? What a joke! Your disciple can obtain Grand Heaven Teleportation if he enters a sect, but why can’t my disciple, upon entering a Dao Sect, also acquire the Golden Light Traversing Skill through his own abilities?”

“So there’s nothing more to discuss?” Supreme Qingyuan did not soften his tone; instead, he lowered his voice.

“If you agree to the conditions stated, I can still make a fair exchange with you. If you harbor other intentions, then please leave,” Supreme Whitebrow stated directly.

“Whitebrow, have you thought this through clearly?” Supreme Qingyuan pressed both hands on the table, his eyes slightly narrowed, faintly gazing at Supreme Whitebrow.

Supreme Whitebrow’s expression also darkened slightly as he said, “Qingyuan, I’ve made myself quite clear. There’s no need for further elaboration, is there?”

“Hmph!” Supreme Qingyuan turned his face away and stood up, flicking his sleeve. With a sullen expression, he said in a deep voice, “Disciple, let’s go!”

The crowd ignored their departure, not bothering to see them off politely.

It wasn’t until the two figures became black dots and disappeared into the distance that True Monarch Guanxiao finally twisted his brow and cursed, “What kind of person is this Supreme Qingyuan? So arrogant, coming to exchange techniques, yet acting as if our sect is begging him.”

True Monarch Qinghe frowned, “I can’t believe Supreme Qingyuan actually found a Spirit Physique. What incredible luck! No wonder he speaks so arrogantly, without any semblance of asking for something. He truly relies on ‘talent’ to be arrogant.”

True Monarch Yunguang shook his head, “Supreme Qingyuan is leveraging the power of a Spirit Physique, his heart filled with self-satisfaction. That brazen attitude isn’t for exchanging techniques; he’s clearly here to ‘bestow’ them upon our sect.”

True Monarch Changye said indignantly, “Hmph! Nephew Changxiao is not bad either. Who knows who will be ahead in the future? Bestow? Does he even have the qualifications?”

True Monarch Shengyu sighed, “With Supreme Qingyuan’s attitude, it will likely be absolutely impossible to exchange for the Golden Light Traversing Skill in the future.”

“Give up that thought, recognize the situation,” Supreme Whitebrow suddenly spoke.

“All Senior Martial Uncles, please rest assured. Senior Brother Changxiao and I will definitely work hard to complete the sect’s techniques and forge unmatched cultivation paths for future outstanding disciples,” Yang Ji suddenly declared.

“Good!” Supreme Whitebrow, hearing these words, a hint of a smile spilled onto his face as he looked at Yang Ji and said, “Little Ji, Changxiao shares your thoughts. The sect will rely on you two from now on.”

“Supreme, please rest assured. We don’t need things we can’t obtain through proper means. I will definitely bring back profound divine abilities and techniques from the Dao Sect, laying a solid foundation for our sect,” Yang Ji affirmed.

With his 'golden finger', his comprehension was astonishing. Though not a Spirit Physique, he was even better than one.

Even if there were countless geniuses in the Dao Sect, he would not be lost among the crowd.

Everyone looked at Yang Ji, smiling with relief. Although the Evergreen Sect had a Spirit Physique, their own sect had two geniuses with outstanding comprehension. Their future was equally boundless.

Thinking of this, the vexation in everyone’s hearts dissipated by more than half.
