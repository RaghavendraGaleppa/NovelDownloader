# Chapter 4: The Eternal Starlight

"I remember now! This is the supreme scripture for cultivating the soul—The Eternal Starlight Visualization Art."

"Time flows like water. In the blink of an eye, life gives way to aging, sickness, and death. Dynasties rise and fall, seas turn to mulberry fields. Yet the vast river of stars continues its endless cycle—within its infinite transformations lies the eternal, indestructible truth. Heaven and earth may perish, but the starlight remains forever!"

"Li Mo stumbled upon The Eternal Starlight Visualization Art by chance. It took him ten years just to grasp the basics, gradually strengthening his soul until he devised a method to control zombies by condensing soul seals, eliminating the need for external magical tools. Ordinary corpse manipulators must use their own essence blood and artifacts as mediums to control zombies. Only those who have cultivated corpse energy can harness it to control the undead, but that method is extremely draining and limited by distance—far less convenient than the soul seal technique."

"Right now, my vital energy is insufficient. How could I spare any essence blood to control zombies? Even if I could, I lack the means to craft the necessary artifacts. As for corpse energy—that's even more impractical. I walk the righteous path of martial arts—how could I cultivate something so grotesque that twists one's very nature?"

"Using soul condensation to control zombies would be perfect. But Li Mo took ten years just to barely grasp the basics, then seventy more to barely manage splitting his consciousness to form seals. I'll be lucky to even reach the threshold, let alone master soul seals—who knows how many years that would take?"

"However, I've merged with remnants of Li Mo's soul. In a way, part of my current soul shares its origin with his. These zombies were initially blood-bound by Li Mo before he switched to soul seals. Perhaps I could blood-bind them like I did with the Corpse Nurturing Ring, achieving some preliminary control?"

Qin Ziling soon shifted his gaze from the Eternal Starlight scroll to the three zombies. According to Li Mo's fragmented memories, the visualization art was notoriously difficult to learn, and this wilderness was no place for study. The zombies, however, could become his hidden trump cards if blood-binding worked—the sooner, the better.

After careful consideration, Qin Ziling willed one of the bronze-armored ape zombies from the ring. Standing three meters tall with arms nearly reaching its feet, its metallic body cast a chilling shadow over Qin Ziling, radiating oppressive gloom.

Guided by Li Mo's memories, Qin Ziling located two eerie runes on the zombie's chest and occiput. He found a chipped bowl and worn brush in the temple, cleaned them, then sterilized his dagger with fire before drawing blood from his wrist to fill the bowl halfway.

Unlike binding the Corpse Nurturing Ring which required mere drops, zombie binding demanded repeatedly tracing the runes until the blood permeated its entire body. True zombie binding required periodic blood rituals to maintain the connection—a process that would drain a man dry.

This bronze zombie already bore Li Mo's soul seals. If Qin Ziling's theory held, a single blood ritual might establish sufficient control without repeated offerings.

Despite his martial training, losing so much blood left Qin Ziling lightheaded and pale. Yet excitement surged as he dipped the brush and began tracing the runes—careful to avoid direct contact with the corpse poison.

After eight full tracings that emptied the bowl, only a faint connection remained. Undeterred, Qin Ziling drew more blood. As the second portion neared depletion, his mind suddenly trembled—a visceral bond snapped into place with the zombie.

"Take three steps," Qin Ziling commanded mentally, suppressing his exhilaration.

The bronze ape complied.

"Lift that boulder and throw it beyond the temple," he ordered next, indicating a fallen stone.

The zombie's massive arms effortlessly heaved the one-ton rock overhead and hurled it thirty meters beyond the wall with a ground-shaking impact.

Qin Ziling's jaw hung open. From Li Mo's memories, he knew bronze zombies matched martial masters in strength—but this exceeded all expectations. A few more tests revealed limitations: control weakened beyond ten meters, and excessive commands induced mental strain.

These constraints didn't surprise him. This zombie bore Li Mo's blood and soul marks—his own control, achieved through merged memories and copious blood, was already miraculous. He couldn't expect Li Mo's effortless mastery.

For now, this was enough—a glimmer of hope in this dog-eat-dog world.

"Binding consumes too much blood, and controlling one bronze zombie strains me. No need to bind the others yet. My priorities are mastering the Starlight Visualization Art to imprint my own soul seals, and accelerating martial cultivation. The imperial court views corpse arts as forbidden—discovery would mean execution. These zombies must remain hidden aces, not replacements for true strength."

After storing the zombie, Qin Ziling departed swiftly. That very night, two gaunt figures in black arrived at Xiaolong Mountain, each followed by a stiff, hooded attendant shrouded in darkness.
