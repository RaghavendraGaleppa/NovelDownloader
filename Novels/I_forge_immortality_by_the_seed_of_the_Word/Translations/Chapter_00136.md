# Chapter 134: Ninth on the True Spirit Ranking

On the spot.

Zhang Jing's figure abruptly vanished without a trace.

In its place appeared a nine-zhang-long pitch-black flood dragon. The ferocious dragon head bore two backward-curving horns that gleamed with a cold light like curved blades. Its entire body was covered in dark scales adorned with intricate dao patterns, faintly exuding an indestructible aura.

An overwhelmingly powerful Taiyin Flood Dragon Dao Intent erupted from Zhang Jing's body, instantly enveloping the entire arena.

The next moment—

Boom!

The shadowy opponent directly exploded under the crushing pressure of the flood dragon's substantialized baleful aura.

"Hmm? This Taiyin Flood Dragon form is indeed powerful. I haven't even used the Taishi True Intent yet. Truly worthy of being a divine seed on par with the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud."

Zhang Jing thought to himself with satisfaction.

In this current form, from inside out, he was completely a juvenile version of a Taiyin Flood Dragon—whether it was the terrifying physical strength, the innate magical abilities of the Taiyin Flood Dragon, or the cold, savage killing intent from the depths of its bloodline.

In short, everything a normal Taiyin Flood Dragon possessed, Zhang Jing had it all.

This was the supreme-grade divine seed—Taiyin Flood Dragon Devours Qi!

However, what Zhang Jing possessed, other Taiyin Flood Dragons certainly didn't. For example, the Taishi True Intent that could be summoned at will, numerous divine seeds, and so on.

To summarize: What you have, I have; what I have, you don't.

Zhang Jing referred to his current form as the Enhanced Juvenile Taiyin Flood Dragon.

It would also be his future alias number one!

He had even thought of a name: Dragon Three-Seven!

"With the Taiyin Flood Dragon Devours Qi divine seed, if there's anything inconvenient for me to do personally when traveling in the Upper Realm in the future, it'll be much easier to handle."

Thinking this, a ferocious-looking smile appeared on Zhang Jing's draconic face.

"Zhang Jing, do you wish to continue your challenge?"

"Continue!"

Outside.

The Flowing Light Immortal Wall rippled with waves of light.

A figure with ordinary features slowly emerged from within, his aura unstable.

Yet in the next moment, the figure froze in place.

"Academy Head, and all Pavilion Masters, you're here too." A trace of surprise flashed in You Yuanming's eyes before he smiled and spoke.

"Yuanming, how did it go?"

The Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master stepped forward with concern.

Hearing this, the Academy Head and the other four Pavilion Masters all turned their attention to You Yuanming.

At the same time, the dozen or so inner courtyard disciples present pricked up their ears, their gazes filled with anticipation as they looked toward You Yuanming.

After sweeping his gaze around, a look of exhilaration appeared on You Yuanming's face as he slowly said:

"Yuanming has not failed the expectations of the Academy Head, the Pavilion Masters, and all my fellow disciples. I am currently ranked 187th on the True Spirit Ranking!"

His voice carried an excitement he couldn't conceal.

"Excellent! With this, Yuanming, you have a chance to enter the powerful blessed lands of the Upper Realm to cultivate. Your path of immortality will surely be smooth sailing."

The Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master shouted loudly and gave You Yuanming a heavy pat on the shoulder.

However, in his excitement, he failed to control his strength and actually sent You Yuanming flying, instantly eliciting exclamations of surprise.

"Junior Brother, you—"

The Academy Head's eyelids twitched violently.

The other Pavilion Masters also looked at the Thousand Techniques Pavilion Master with eyes full of envy and even jealousy.

If only their pavilions had such an inner courtyard disciple...

Not to mention one who had also achieved an Immortal Foundation!

Meanwhile, You Yuanming stood up from the ground as if nothing had happened and walked to the Academy Head's side, asking softly:

"Academy Head, you all didn't come here just for Yuanming, did you?"

Hearing this, the smile on the Academy Head's face grew even brighter.

"Yes, and no. We came here partly for you. After all, Yuanming, you've always been steady in character. Now that you've chosen to challenge the ranking again, you must have been confident."

"And as for the other reason..."

The Academy Head couldn't help but glance at the Flowing Light Immortal Wall.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing?" You Yuanming asked in a tone that suggested he already knew the answer.

The Academy Head nodded slightly.

Upon hearing this news, You Yuanming, who had originally planned to return and recuperate, changed his mind.

His gaze fixed on the Flowing Light Immortal Wall, his eyes unconsciously turning sharp.

"You who possess an Immortal Foundation—just how far can you go this time?"

At this moment.

Inside the擂台 of the Miraculous Dharma Immortal Realm.

Zhang Jing, now fully transformed into a flood dragon, had pupils narrowed into vertical slits, emitting rays of cold light.

Whoosh—

The divine seed, Multitude Treasures River, was activated and rapidly expanded in an instant.

The black flood dragon immediately plunged into the Multitude Treasures River.

In that moment, the innate ability to overturn seas and skies was unleashed by Zhang Jing to its utmost limit.

Boom!

The Multitude Treasures River instantly began to boil, with waves dozens of zhang high, carrying countless shimmering lights floating within the river, threatening to shatter the entire擂台.

Opposite Zhang Jing.

An old man with indistinct features stirred the limit of Foundation Establishment realm mana within him, swiftly forming sword seals with his hands.

Hundreds of sharp sword lights gathered into a great river, their razor-sharp sword intent carving crisscrossing scars across the ground.

The river of sword lights circled once in the air before charging headlong toward the towering waves of the Multitude Treasures River without backing down.

Yet in the next instant.

The Taishi True Intent spread out.

The Multitude Treasures River immediately erupted with radiant light, the dense shimmering lights within it rapidly evolving and transforming.

In just a breath's time.

The aura of the Multitude Treasures River surged by more than tenfold.

Zhang Jing's draconic form thrashed wildly within the river, stirring up waves that grew ever higher, directly smashing both the opponent and his river of sword lights into dust.

As the commotion gradually faded.

On the spot, Zhang Jing's figure, now clad in purple robes, abruptly reappeared.

"Zhang Jing, do you wish to continue your challenge?"

The grand voice sounded once more.

"No." Zhang Jing shook his head in refusal.

To deal with that old man just now, he had already used both the Multitude Treasures River divine seed and the Taishi True Intent.

With barely two trump cards left, there was no need to continue the challenge.

After all, he was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage—the gap in cultivation between him and these opponents was simply too vast.

"Are you willing to leave behind a shadow of your battle?"

"No!"

Zhang Jing's voice was firm.

As his words fell.

A flash of light before his eyes.

Zhang Jing suddenly found himself outside the two bronze doors.

He slowly walked backward.

Not long after.

Taking a deep breath.

Zhang Jing directly raised his head to look at the True Spirit Ranking.

Soon, he found his name upon it.

[Ninth: Zhang Jing (Dragon Lake Academy)]

"Ninth on the True Spirit Ranking—not bad."

A faint smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

Outside.

By now, nearly sixty people had gathered within the hall.

More than half of them were disciples who, upon hearing that two Golden Nature Foundation Establishment cultivators from the academy were simultaneously challenging the True Spirit Ranking, had put aside their affairs to come witness the spectacle.

After all, such an event was once in a lifetime.

How could they miss it?

Time passed bit by bit.

Finally.

Under the gaze of all present.

The Flowing Light Immortal Wall rippled once more with waves of light.

A youthful figure slowly emerged from within, his aura as calm as an abyss.

"He's out!"

The inner courtyard disciples felt their hearts tremble at this sight.

At the very front.

The Academy Head and his entourage quickly stepped forward to meet him.

"Zhang Jing, how did it go?"

The Academy Head at the forefront asked urgently.

"Junior Brother, what's your ranking on the True Spirit Ranking?" You Yuanming walked up to Zhang Jing, his expression complex as he asked.

His current mood was extremely conflicted.

He both hoped that this junior brother Zhang Jing's ranking would be higher, while also somewhat fearing that it might be too high.

Facing the probing gazes of the Academy Head and others.

A faint smile flashed across Zhang Jing's face as he said softly:

"Reporting to the Academy Head, this disciple is currently ranked ninth on the True Spirit Ranking."
