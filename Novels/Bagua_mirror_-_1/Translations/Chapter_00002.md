# Chapter 2: Blood Spirit Fruit  

Qin Chong had spent several years in this world already. At first, he had been filled with endless dreams and expectations about this wondrous world of cultivation. But as time passed, he gradually came to understand the harshness of reality.  

Though cultivators possessed lifespans and strength far surpassing ordinary mortals, the sheer number of low-level cultivators made the competition for scarce cultivation resources especially fierce and brutal.  

Over the years, Qin Chong had slowly adapted to life here and had resolved to strive with all his might—to make up for the regrets of his past life.  

*"In life, be a hero among men; in death, a spirit among ghosts."*  

He often recalled these lines to encourage himself, but to better suit this world of cultivation, he had altered them slightly:  

*"In life, tread the pinnacle; in death, enter the cycle."*  

**"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"**  

With a flick of his wrist, Qin Chong unleashed four or five small fireballs in rapid succession, all aimed at the Ironback Grey Wolf. Though the fireballs seemed insignificant, their power was nothing to scoff at.  

A single hit would ignite the beast's hide, leaving behind a sizable scorch mark. While not fatal, the pain was enough to enrage the wolf—exactly what Qin Chong intended.  

Sure enough, though the Ironback Grey Wolf dodged swiftly, two fireballs still struck its flanks, searing patches of fur and filling the air with the scent of roasted meat. The aroma made Qin Chong, already famished, swallow hard.  

**"Roar! Roar! Roar!"**  

The wolf bellowed in fury, yet still clung to the last shreds of its rationality. Its front claws dug deep, half an inch into the rock beneath, but it refused to charge recklessly.  

*Hmph! Still holding back, huh? Let’s see how long you can endure!*  

The Fireball Technique was one of the most basic spells for cultivators, requiring minimal qi and easily mastered by those at the second level of Qi Refinement. Of course, its power scaled with the user's cultivation—had a Foundation Establishment cultivator cast it, the beast would have been reduced to ashes already.  

But Qin Chong was far from that level. Still, it was perfect for provoking the wolf.  

He hurled another volley of fireballs, streaks of flame streaking toward the beast.  

**"Aooo!"**  

With a piercing howl, the wolf's eyes turned blood-red, its fur standing on end. Its massive tail pressed flat against the ground as its front legs tensed, poised to lunge.  

Qin Chong braced himself—this was the moment he had been waiting for.  

**"Whoosh!"**  

The Ironback Grey Wolf pounced, but this time, it controlled its strength perfectly. Only its front claws reached Qin Chong, slashing downward with brutal force.  

Qin Chong nearly cursed aloud.  

*Damn it! Who said low-level beasts were stupid? I swear I’ll find that liar and make them pay!*  

At the last possible instant, he curled into a roll, dodging the attack and ending up behind the beast.  

This was his chance—the opening he needed.  

**"Clang!"**  

His Flying Dragon Sword shot forth, aimed straight for the wolf’s vulnerable rear.  

This strike prioritized speed over power, and with Qin Chong’s qi nearly depleted, its force was limited. But a hit to such a sensitive spot would still be devastating.  

True enough, the wolf shrieked in agony, its body lurching forward uncontrollably. Its front paws scrambled at empty air before it lost balance entirely, tumbling over the cliff’s edge.  

But Qin Chong, eager to confirm the kill, moved too hastily.  

Suddenly, a dark shadow lashed out—the wolf’s tail—wrapping around him and yanking him over the edge as well.  

**"Ahhh!"**  

As he plummeted, Qin Chong seethed inwardly.  

*You damned beast! Even in death, you drag me down with you! What rotten luck to run into a monster like this!*  

The fall from such a height took several terrifying seconds.  

After a few breaths, the wolf’s tail finally released him.  

Panic gave way to survival instinct.  

*Wind Riding Technique!*  

But mid-fall, the spell was nearly impossible to execute. His first attempt went awry, failing to slow his descent.  

*Am I really going to die here?*  

Just before impact, he spotted the wolf’s body below. Desperate, he hurled fireballs at the cliff face, using the slight recoil to shift his trajectory—landing squarely atop the wolf’s corpse.  

**"Thud!"**  

The Ironback Grey Wolf hit the jagged rocks below, bones shattering, blood gushing from every orifice—instantly lifeless.  

Qin Chong crashed down right onto its abdomen.  

**"Ugh!"**  

The impact deformed the wolf’s carcass, organs spilling out grotesquely. Though he survived, the fall left Qin Chong’s qi in turmoil, his organs jolted out of place, his entire body wracked with pain.  

Broken bones from the wolf had also gashed his skin in multiple places, blood seeping from the wounds.  

For now, he couldn’t move—only lie atop the wolf’s soft belly, gasping for breath as he slowly recovered.  

The spot where he’d landed was several yards from the Flying Cloud Pond, on a steep, rocky slope.  

Through crevices in the rocks, rivulets of blood—mostly the wolf’s, mingled with Qin Chong’s own—trickled downward, pooling near the pond’s edge before something blocked their path.  

Unnoticed by Qin Chong, the blood gathered at a narrow fissure where a small sapling grew.  

The sapling stood about a foot tall, its trunk no thicker than a thumb, with a few sparse branches bearing withered yellow leaves.  

But at its crown grew a single crimson fruit—small as a pigeon’s egg, radiant with a faint spiritual glow.  

This fruit greedily absorbed the blood, its size swelling visibly to that of an egg within moments, its glow intensifying.  

By the time Qin Chong had recovered enough to slide off the wolf’s corpse, a sudden surge of spiritual energy caught his attention.  

He turned toward the pond—and his eyes widened in shock.  

**"Holy—Blood Spirit Fruit?!"**
