# Chapter 5: Fuel for the Fire  

Han Yue couldn't help but recall the terrifying ape and the colossal white elephant he had encountered on his journey.  

Both were undoubtedly among the elite of second-tier demons. They would certainly meet the requirements for the New Year's Feast at Fenshouji.  

In his mind, Han Yue envisioned a mountain-sized beast being thrown onto the square, sliced into strips, and devoured by thousands. The scene would be nothing short of awe-inspiring!  

However, Han Yue couldn't fathom any method to slay such massive second-tier demons at the moment. His mana reserves were severely lacking. While **[Wuxiang—One Slash]** was formidable, it was still insufficient against those two monstrous beings.  

The overwhelming power and sheer vitality they exuded couldn't be overcome by sheer numbers alone—it would require a human warrior of equal strength to stand a chance.  

Fortunately, Fang Yi confirmed that the last time the Ninth Courtyard of the Celestial District had been responsible for hunting second-tier demons was sixty years ago, during her grandfather's era. The next hunt wouldn't be due for another thirty years, so there was no immediate urgency.  

Lying on his bed, Han Yue pulled out the **[Ten Thousand Techniques Compendium]** and checked his status:  

**[Host: Han Yue]**  
**[Realm: First Tier - Body Entry]**  
**[Cultivation Method: None]**  
**[Key Terms: None]**  
**[Divine Ability Extraction: Conditions Not Met]**  

**First Page:**  
**[Divine Ability: Jade Void - Golden Light Flight Technique]**  
**[Quality: Mythic - Gold]**  
**[Proficiency: Beginner (7%)]**  
**[Key Term: Movement]**  

**Second Page:**  
**[Divine Ability: Raiden Shogun - Wuxiang One Slash]**  
**[Quality: Epic - Purple]**  
**[Proficiency: Beginner (13%)]**  
**[Key Term: Severing]**  

Continuous use of divine abilities increased their proficiency, enhancing their power over time.  

Between the two abilities, the higher-quality **[Golden Light Flight Technique]** was noticeably harder to advance. Despite using it more frequently and investing more energy into it, its proficiency lagged far behind **[Wuxiang One Slash]**.  

Han Yue focused his mind inward, where two divine runes hovered at the center of his consciousness, radiating their respective auras.  

The **[Wuxiang One Slash]** rune pulsed with a violet glow. Though dimmer than when he first obtained it, it still retained about twenty percent of its divine energy. The battle at the city lord's manor had drained eighty percent of its reserves, leaving Han Yue unable to unleash such overwhelming force again in the near future.  

Meanwhile, the golden light of the **[Golden Light Flight Technique]** had faded to less than ten percent. His desperate escape from the demon-infested lands had pushed the ability to its limits, depleting its energy drastically.  

Both abilities urgently needed replenishment, especially the **[Golden Light Flight Technique]**. However, due to his limited strength and lack of cultivation methods, Han Yue could only rely on his body's natural recovery to slowly restore minuscule amounts of divine energy.  

Thankfully, Fenshouji provided a safe environment. Han Yue could afford to lay low for now, minimizing his use of divine abilities while he gathered more knowledge and honed his skills.  

After resting until dinnertime, Han Yue felt refreshed, his exhaustion and emotional strain greatly alleviated. He got up and followed the path back to the dining hall, where a lively crowd had already gathered.  

At the center of the room lay two massive ox hearts and livers, still twitching rhythmically as if alive.  

Fang Yi spotted Han Yue and stood up to introduce him.  

"This is our new butcher for the Ninth Courtyard of the Celestial District—Han Yue! From now on, he's one of us!"  

"After discussing with Old Yang and the others, we've decided Han Yue will be our chief butcher—our new 'Han the Blade'!"  

Han Yue's youth and exceptional butchering skills had already won over the courtyard's residents.  

"Han Yue is new here, so if there's anything you can help with, don't hesitate!" Fang Yi continued. "Thanks to him today, we avoided disaster during the butchering. With him here, we won't have any problems next time!"  

"Now, to celebrate our 'Han the Blade'—let the feast begin!"  

Under Fang Yi's enthusiastic direction, the banquet commenced. Han Yue and the other three butchers stepped forward, wielding their tools to meticulously slice the ox hearts and livers.  

Before long, the organs had been transformed into two towering mountains of meat.  

The crowd wasted no time, eagerly lining up with plates to claim their portions before devouring the meat ravenously.  

Following their lead, Han Yue also began eating the raw beef. Thanks to the butchers' precise cuts, the meat's inherent power had been subdued, leaving it tender and flavorful.  

The beef sashimi carried no trace of blood, instead exuding a rich, savory aroma with an unforgettable aftertaste. Without any seasoning, the natural flavor alone made it a delicacy beyond compare.  

Han Yue ate with relish—this was the most delicious meal he'd had since transmigrating. With every bite, his body absorbed vast amounts of nutrients, filling him with warmth and vitality.  

Physical enhancement relied heavily on nourishment. Han Yue had forcefully ascended to the Body Entry Realm through the **[Wuxiang One Slash]**'s tempering of his flesh. While effective, this method had unknowingly drained his reserves. Without timely replenishment, it could have damaged his foundation and stunted his potential.  

Fortunately, this feast of high-quality meat instantly replenished his depleted reserves, boosting his blood and qi while strengthening his body further.  

The beef contained the essence of the Steel Ghost Ox, a first-tier demon beast. As this energy entered Han Yue's body, he channeled his thunderforce to refine it, transforming it into fuel for his physical enhancement.  

Han Yue ate voraciously, shuttling between his seat and the meat piles. His digestion seemed to have been perfectly activated—the more he ate, the more he could consume.  

The others were no different, all seizing the opportunity to gorge themselves. For a time, the dining hall fell silent save for the sounds of chewing and tearing flesh.  

Gradually, the meat piles dwindled. Most people had eaten their fill, slowing down to savor the last of their portions.  

Only Han Yue and Fang Yi remained, still devouring meat at an astonishing rate. It was as if they were locked in an eating contest, each guarding their own meat mountain.  

Han Yue felt the fire of life burning fiercely within him, incinerating impurities and leaving only the purest essence behind.  

And as for demons? They would become the fuel for his ascension—stepping stones on his path to the throne of divine power!
