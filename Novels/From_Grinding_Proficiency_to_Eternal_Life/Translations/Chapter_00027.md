# Chapter 27: Plain Clothes and Gauze

Mentioning this mission, Zhang Shuyang secretly pondered the situation.

Royal affairs had always been complicated. Although he stood on the Empress's side, going to capture Li Haomiao meant that, who knows, some hidden old monster from the Dao Sect or the royal family might emerge to protect him.

If that really happened, his life would likely be forfeit here.

Now that he was severely injured, it would be better to take this opportunity to withdraw to preserve his life.

Li Miaoyun seemed not to hear Zhang Shuyang's words. She quietly gazed at the continuous mountain ridges ahead, a hint of unfathomable depth in her eyes.

After a long while, she slightly moved her eyes and coldly uttered two words.

"Waste."

These two words were like a sharp dagger, piercing straight into Zhang Shuyang.

Zhang Shuyang's face instantly turned extremely unsightly, alternating between pale and flushed, but in the end, he remained silent, gritting his teeth, his heart filled with unwillingness and frustration.

Li Miaoyun didn't linger any longer. With a light step of her lotus feet, she moved forward.

With each step she took, her figure instantly flashed over a hundred meters away, her speed astonishingly fast.

Even more bizarre was that her movement didn't stir up the slightest gust of wind, as if she were just an illusory shadow.

In the blink of an eye, her figure disappeared into the vast snow curtain.

Zhang Shuyang watched the direction Li Miaoyun left, his gaze falling on the snow she had stepped on, and his pupils suddenly contracted.

On the flat snow, there were actually no footprints left at all.

Walking on snow without leaving a trace!

This peerless light footwork made a chill rise in Zhang Shuyang's heart.

He knew well that if Li Miaoyun wanted to take his life right now, with his strength, he wouldn't even have a chance to react.

His whole body was tense, cold sweat unconsciously emerging from his forehead, his back already soaked. After a long while, his tense expression slowly relaxed, and he let out a heavy breath.

A nearby attendant gritted his teeth: "General, we..."

"This matter is now handled by Commander Li, we will no longer participate. Gather the brothers' bodies, we... are going home."

Zhang Shuyang's face was gloomy, his eyes flickering.

"Is it Qingzhou beyond that mountain ahead?"

Xu Yunfan raised his eyes to look at the towering mountain before him, nearly six thousand meters high, and looked around. He saw the mountain ranges on both sides extending into the distance, like two walls piercing the sky, extremely majestic, like a natural Great Wall.

Fang Mushan also looked up at the high mountain, a hint of emotion in his eyes.

Recalling the experiences of the past two or three months, it felt like an unreal dream.

Li Haomiao spoke with a complex expression, carrying an indescribable meaning.

"Northern Qingzhou, it's because this Jiyun Mountain blocks the piercing cold currents from the eight hundred miles of barren ice plains that makes Qingzhou's climate pleasant, earning it the reputation of a small Central Plains. Once we enter, we'll have completely left this eight hundred miles of barren ice plains behind."

Xu Yunfan wore a large knife taken from a soldier at his waist and looked up at the mountain before him. On the summit, the cold wind howled, the raging winds carrying icy breaths. Layer upon layer of white snow covered it, spreading from the mountainside of Jiyun Mountain all the way to the summit, like a white dragon lying horizontally here.

"Let's climb. I want to see what Qingzhou of the Great Zhou Dynasty is really like."

Ever since arriving here, he had been thrown into the mine, living in constant peril day and night. Now that a turning point had finally arrived, he wanted to experience the breath of human life.

The days of living like savages were truly miserable; the roasted meat had nothing but a bloody smell.

Fang Mushan took a deep breath, tightened his fur clothing, his expression firm as he said in a deep voice: "Let's push on with all our strength and cross this Jiyun Mountain!"

The few of them no longer hesitated, stepped forward and began to climb upwards.

Xu Yunfan executed the Fleet Foot technique. With each step, the muscles in his legs instantly tensed and exerted force, his footprints sinking deep into the snow. Then, with a sudden leap, a large stride could cover six or seven meters.

Under the continuous sprinting and rushing of these days, the Fleet Foot technique had already reached a minor success. Every time Xu Yunfan exerted force, it became more relaxed and natural. With each stride, the soles of his feet seemed to resonate wonderfully with the earth. The power of the earth stably supported him, as if a spring-like force propelled him forward.

'Fleet Foot 378/1000 (Minor Success)

Special Effects: Treading danger as if on level ground, body light as a swallow, leg force burst forth, tireless travel, agile posture'

The several special effects of the Fleet Foot technique allowed him to navigate this rugged wasteland even more easily than Fang Mushan.

'You used Fleet Foot, your exertion touched the essence of this technique, proficiency increased.'

'You used Fleet Foot, subconsciously felt that the stride and hip movement could be larger. After trying, you found it more energy-efficient, Fleet Foot proficiency increased.'

"..."

Until late at night, moonlight poured down through sparse clouds.

Xu Yunfan stepped onto the summit and let out a long breath of stale air. In the extremely cold environment, the white breath from his mouth was clearly visible, like a drifting cloud of mist.

He casually took a dried piece of meat from his waist and stuffed it into his mouth, saying indistinctly: "Beyond this summit, we'll have completely left the eight hundred miles of barren ice plains behind, right?"

At this time, Fang Mushan beside him was steaming with heat. Due to the cold air, the top of his head seemed to have wisps of cooking smoke rising, his whole body shrouded in a hazy mist.

He was slightly panting, looking at Xu Yunfan who seemed fine, extremely shocked in his heart. He had thought his endurance was very strong, but compared to Xu Yunfan, it was truly like a speck of dust before a mountain.

Climbing such a mountain, the other party not only had more agile and nimble movement skills, but also passed through dangerous areas with flowing actions, without the slightest stiffness.

Is this really a servant of the Jiang family, not some expert cultivated by a sect?!

Xu Yunfan's gaze came over.

"Are you tired?"

"Tired?! Of course I'm not tired!"

Fang Mushan immediately straightened his body, composed his mood, and replied: "It's just because of the martial arts I practice, my vigorous blood energy surges with every move... We'll be down the summit soon, as long as we carefully avoid..."

"You all... probably won't be getting off the summit."

The few of them were startled and looked up to see a woman in thin gauze standing right there on the snowy summit. Her gaze looked at them as if looking at dead people.

"Li Miaoyun!"

Li Haomiao subconsciously straightened up on Xu Yunfan's back, his expression cold, his eyes filled with gravity.

Xu Yunfan suddenly felt something hard pressing against his butt from behind and quickly said: "Wait, wait, you're poking me. Let me put you down first."

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan quickly put Li Haomiao down.

Li Haomiao was furious with embarrassment. This guy Xu Yunfan was truly a mood killer. If he wasn't missing hands and feet, he would definitely teach him a lesson.

He composed his mood and looked again at Li Miaoyun who still had no expression.

Xu Yunfan saw the atmosphere was off and naturally silently moved the two of them in front of him. If anything seemed wrong, he would毫不犹豫 (without hesitation) activate his sprint and leave.
