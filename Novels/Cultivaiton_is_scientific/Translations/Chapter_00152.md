# Chapter 152: Emerging from Seclusion  

"Shiming, don't tell Lan'er about Zhuge Xuan's death. It might affect her breakthrough to Foundation Establishment. I'll have her go into seclusion to attempt it as soon as we return!" Elder Yin hesitated for a moment before speaking as they made their way back.  

"I understand, Uncle Yin!" Li Shiming nodded in agreement.  

Among the few people Yin Shilan was close to in the sect, Zhuge Xuan was undoubtedly one of them. Zhuge Xuan had guided her extensively in formations. If she learned of his tragic death while attempting her breakthrough, it would undoubtedly be detrimental to her.  

"Good child." A fatherly smile flickered in Elder Yin's eyes before his expression turned serious again. "Your physical cultivation has improved too much, which will affect your Foundation Establishment breakthrough. You should stop studying formations and other distractions, take on more sect missions, exchange for more Foundation Establishment Pills, and prepare thoroughly for your breakthrough!"  

Li Shiming was taken aback. He had always believed that physical cultivation could increase his chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment. He hadn't realized that being too strong physically could also be a problem.  

"Excess is as bad as deficiency. Your physical body has surpassed your Qi Refinement level. Right now, you're only at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement. By the time you reach the peak of the ninth layer, your physique will have improved even further. An overly strong body creates a tougher bottleneck for your breakthrough... Of course, if you do break through under these circumstances, your strength will far surpass that of an ordinary cultivator." Elder Yin pondered briefly before offering further advice.  

His guidance was partly for his daughter's sake and partly because Li Shiming was obedient enough to heed his words.  

As for why the Golden Core sword cultivator had spared Li Shiming, Elder Yin didn't dwell on it.  

From his own perspective, even if he encountered a cultivator from an enemy faction, the most he would do was kill a Foundation Establishment cultivator—and that would only be in extreme anger.  

To a Golden Core cultivator, a Qi Refinement cultivator was no different from an ant, unworthy of their attention.  

Elder Yin fully accepted Li Shiming's explanation of escaping into the sea to survive, harboring no doubts whatsoever.  

Upon returning to the sect, Li Shiming retreated to his cave abode. Elder Yin would handle the aftermath of the attack; there was nothing for him to do.  

Entering the familiar underground space, he recalled Elder Yin's words and something Yun Xingyi had once told him.  

Yun Xingyi had said that, given his talent and aptitude, the Foundation Establishment stage would likely be his limit. At the time, Li Shiming hadn't paid much attention, but now he realized Yun Xingyi hadn't been speaking idly.  

He had been striving to bridge the gap with top-tier talents, even resorting to using his doppelganger to aid his cultivation.  

But this method could only help him reach the peak of Qi Refinement faster. Once he reached Foundation Establishment, it would no longer be viable.  

---  

The Foundation Establishment stage was crucial—a period for laying the most solid foundation.  

After reaching Foundation Establishment, he could no longer practice the same primary cultivation technique as his doppelganger. The doppelganger's talent was too high, and he risked dragging it down, reducing it to mediocrity.  

The doppelganger was essentially another version of himself. If it could advance to higher realms faster, the cultivation resources it could provide alone might compensate for some of the gap in talent.  

"They say my talent is too poor to reach Golden Core? Fine. Then I'll have my doppelganger reach Golden Core first and gather vast resources for me. I refuse to believe that piling up enough resources won't push me to Golden Core. If one Golden Core doppelganger isn't enough, I'll make it a Nascent Soul!" Li Shiming clenched his fists, his eyes burning with determination.  

He thought of the *Ten Directions Sword Art* and the *Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art*, both superior to the sect's techniques.  

He didn't quite understand why Yun Xingyi had carried three complete cultivation manuals—something exceedingly rare among cultivators.  

This was actually related to Yun Xingyi's mission. He had been tasked with crossing the dangerous sea to explore a safe route.  

Before setting out, he had prepared for the worst—if his life was in danger, he needed to be ready for body possession.  

These three manuals were part of his preparations. During possession, memory confusion was possible, so having the appropriate techniques on hand was essential.  

In the end, all these preparations had fallen into Li Shiming's lap.  

Li Shiming was now contemplating his future plans. He had considered this many times before, but without access to high-level techniques, even with IBMz15's analytical capabilities, he couldn't draw any useful conclusions.  

Now, things were different. With two top-tier techniques that could take him all the way to Nascent Soul, he had enough to make a choice.  

He needed to decide whether to become a sword cultivator or a spell cultivator. The *Ten Directions Sword Art* was a pure sword cultivation path, while the *Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art* was a spell cultivation path.  

Yun Xingyi had likely prepared the latter as a contingency in case the body he possessed was unsuitable for sword cultivation.  

Sometimes, possession didn't leave room for choice. For an ordinary cultivator, the path of the sword was far too difficult.  

Li Shiming also knew that, compared to sword cultivation, spell cultivation was much easier.  

This was evident from the numbers—within the sect, only the most talented cultivators chose the sword path, while ordinary cultivators almost universally followed the spell path.  

Of course, this didn't mean spell cultivators were weaker in combat. The *Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art*, which Yun Xingyi—a Golden Core sword cultivator—had favored, embodied the same hallmark of sword cultivation: extreme offensive power.  

---  

Thunder cultivators were the most offensively potent among spell cultivators. If one possessed a Thunder spiritual root, that was the ideal choice.  

Without a Thunder spiritual root, the Metal spiritual root was the second-best option.  

Yun Xingyi's words had made Li Shiming recognize his own limitations.  

Li Shiming was no longer the newcomer who had chosen the most expensive technique, *Sword Control Art*, for its cost-effectiveness.  

While *Sword Control Art* had indeed given him formidable combat strength, that didn't mean the sword cultivation path was right for him.  

Given his mediocre talent, he worried that his aptitude wouldn't support his ambitions if he pursued sword cultivation.  

Of course, his doppelganger practicing the *Ten Directions Sword Art* was, in a way, equivalent to him practicing it himself.  

He could use the doppelganger's magical instruments, and the doppelganger's cultivation was essentially his own consciousness at work—they were one in soul.  

His main body might not be able to unleash the full power of the *Ten Directions Sword Art* through the doppelganger, but the gap could be bridged by the offensive power of thunder cultivation.  

Moreover, Li Shiming felt an inexplicable affinity for the *Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art*, as if it were naturally suited to him.  

Thus, he made his decision: after reaching Foundation Establishment, his main body would practice the *Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art*, while his doppelganger would practice the *Ten Directions Sword Art*.  

It was hard to imagine a cultivator with no background planning his post-Foundation Establishment path so early—a privilege usually reserved for the children of powerful cultivators or those with extraordinary talent.  

---  

"I'm going to attempt Foundation Establishment. I'll be in seclusion for three to six months!" Yin Shilan sent him a message. By the time Li Shiming replied, she had already entered the seclusion chamber.  

Li Shiming silently wished her success, hoping she wouldn't be too distraught over Zhuge Xuan's death when she emerged.  

His doppelganger, in its corpse form, rested for half a day in the ghost realm of the *Netherworld Ghost Formation* before its injuries healed completely.  

Once the doppelganger resumed human form, all traces of injury vanished.  

"Thank you for your hard work, fellow Daoist," Li Shiming said, bowing slightly to his doppelganger.  

"It was nothing—just a minor strike from a Golden Core cultivator," the doppelganger replied with a dismissive wave.  

Both burst into laughter.  

Only after confirming his doppelganger was unharmed did Li Shiming relax. If the injuries had persisted, his cultivation plans would have been disrupted.  

He also examined the condition of his right thumb. Whether it was due to his low cultivation level or the advanced nature of the sword bone, neither his spiritual sense nor IBMz15 could detect anything unusual about it.  

The only difference was its extraordinary hardness, though without a way to measure it precisely, he could only make an educated guess.  

He had no intention of testing its durability by slicing it with a magical weapon. As long as it didn't cause any issues, he would treat it as if nothing had happened.  

"Fellow Daoist, I entrust this sword to you." Li Shiming handed Yun Xingyi's lifebound flying sword, *Unity Sword*, to his doppelganger.  

Aside from helping the main body cultivate the *Five Elements Absorption Art*, the doppelganger couldn't engage in regular cultivation—doing so risked triggering a breakthrough.  

Thus, he gave *Unity Sword* to the doppelganger to carry at all times. Since the doppelganger wouldn't appear before other cultivators, there was no risk of the sword being exposed.  

Having decided to pursue spell cultivation, Li Shiming naturally assigned the lifebound sword of a Golden Core sword cultivator to his doppelganger.  

Because the doppelganger shared Li Shiming's soul imprint and aura, *Unity Sword* accepted it just as it had the main body.  

Of course, this acceptance only granted usage rights—true ownership was still far off.  

Li Shiming's solution was simple: have the doppelganger spend as much time as possible with *Unity Sword*.  

Once the doppelganger reached Foundation Establishment and began practicing the *Ten Directions Sword Art*, it could use sword cultivation methods to nurture the sword, deepening their bond.  

With Yun Xingyi dead, transferring ownership from usage rights would be difficult, but Li Shiming had plenty of time.  

"Don't worry, fellow Daoist. *Unity Sword* will acknowledge us as its master," the doppelganger said, securing the sword at its waist.  

Li Shiming was growing accustomed to these split-consciousness conversations, finding them a small reprieve from the solitude of cultivation.  

In the days that followed, he heeded Elder Yin's advice and took on numerous formation-related missions.  

He avoided the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion—since Zhuge Xuan's death, the senior formation master stationed there had been replaced by a female Foundation Establishment cultivator surnamed Song.  

With Zhuge Xuan gone and Yin Shilan in seclusion, the sect's formation-related workload had increased significantly.  

Li Shiming took on one or two formation missions daily, helping to mitigate the impact of losing a senior formation master.  

His spiritual vortex grew at a visible pace. With a cultivation speed surpassing even Heavenly Spiritual Roots, he reached the late stage of the seventh layer of Qi Refinement in just one month.  

Three months later, he broke through to the eighth layer.  

---  

"Uncle Yin!" Li Shiming received a message from Elder Yin and hurried to the seclusion chambers on Central Peak, where he found the elder waiting.  

Judging by the energy fluctuations from the chamber, Yin Shilan would emerge that day.  

"Shiming, you've reached the eighth layer of Qi Refinement. It seems you've been diligent in your cultivation," Elder Yin remarked, sensing Li Shiming's progress. His tone carried rare approval.  

He hadn't planned to summon Li Shiming, but his daughter had insisted before entering seclusion.  

Recently, he had inquired about Li Shiming's activities and learned of his dedication to formation missions.  

The boy had followed his advice, which slightly improved Elder Yin's opinion of him.  

"Did Lan'er succeed in her breakthrough?" Li Shiming blurted out, his eyes fixed on the seclusion chamber's door.  

His concern clouded his judgment. With Yin Shilan's talent and Elder Yin's preparations, breaking through to Foundation Establishment shouldn't have been difficult.  

"I don't know," Elder Yin replied coldly, his expression darkening.  

Since when had this boy started calling his daughter by her pet name? "Lan'er" was reserved for him and his wife!  

Li Shiming was taken aback by Elder Yin's sudden shift in demeanor, fearing something had gone wrong with Yin Shilan's breakthrough. His worry intensified.  

He stared at the door, imagining Yin Shilan emerging heartbroken—injured, perhaps, or in tears.  

Neither spoke again. Elder Yin was fuming, while Li Shiming was lost in anxiety.  

After what felt like an eternity, the heavy silence was broken as the seclusion chamber's door opened.  

"Lan'er!" Li Shiming and Elder Yin called out simultaneously.  

Yin Shilan stepped out to see Li Shiming's worried gaze and her father's proud smile.  

"Shiming," she murmured, warmth flooding her heart.  

Li Shiming sensed the distinct aura of a Foundation Establishment cultivator emanating from her.  

He glanced at Elder Yin, puzzled. Had the elder been teasing him earlier?  

"Father!" Yin Shilan, unaware of the tension between the two, turned to Elder Yin.  

"Now that you're out, focus on consolidating your realm. I'll go tell your mother the good news," Elder Yin said, hiding his irritation that she had addressed Li Shiming first. He wouldn't take it out on her—Li Shiming would bear the brunt of his displeasure.  

Eager to leave, he soared into the sky and vanished.  

"Shiming, I have good news. Look what this is!" Yin Shilan watched her father depart in confusion before remembering something important. With a hint of pride, she produced a small porcelain vial.  

Li Shiming recognized it instantly—a standard-issue Foundation Establishment Pill container from the sect.  

"You broke through without using the pill?" He was surprised; he had underestimated her talent.  

"I extended my seclusion by a month and saved this pill. You need it more than I do." She placed the vial in his hand, her smile radiant.
