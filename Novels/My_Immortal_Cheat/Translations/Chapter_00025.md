Chapter 25: Curse Kill Again!

The next morning, Zhou Tian was once again roused from his bed. He looked at the young man in front of him, clad in a python-jade white robe, feeling utterly drained, his eyes barely open.

"I say, Zhou Zui, can't you come a little later? I haven't been able to sleep in for days."

The young man before him, with a lewd smile, was Zhou Zui, the son of the Carefree King. He was also Zhou Tian's good friend from the past; the two often frequented the pleasure houses of the Imperial Capital.

"Zhou Tian, you're not being a loyal brother! I only just started 'talking about life' with the ladies at Wutian Hall a few days ago, and you're already engaged! Honestly, was last night exhilarating or what?"

Zhou Zui was actually quite handsome, dashing and elegant, a truly refined individual. But seeing the smile on his face, Zhou Tian could only think of one word: sleazy.

"No, Ling'er is participating in the Youth Competition, so she's been in seclusion for the past two days. She doesn't have time to play with me…" Zhou Tian's face was filled with melancholy as he spoke.

"Youth Competition?" Zhou Zui paused, then continued, "Doesn't your family have a direct admission slot for the Elite Competition? You're useless, so why don't you just give it to your Ling'er?"

"Who are you calling useless?" Zhou Tian looked helpless. Most people tried to avoid mentioning his status as a mortal in front of him, fearing he would feel sad. But Zhou Zui was different from those alluring and cheap hussies; he would rip open Zhou Tian's wound, slash it again, and then sprinkle chili oil mixed with salt on it. However, thanks to him, the old Zhou Tian was no longer sensitive to the words "mortal."

"The Elite Competition is full of perverts. What if Ling'er gets hurt?"

"That's true." Zhou Zui nodded, then a moment later realized that Zhou Tian was subtly calling him a pervert.

Before Zhou Zui could mock him, Zhou Tian asked again, "Why are you out of Wutian Hall? Don't tell me you're worried about me, I won't believe it!"

Zhou Zui's face showed embarrassment. He rubbed his hands and continued, "I was having a good chat with those ladies, but who knew those pedantic scholars from Daluo Academy would arrive so early? You know, pedantic scholars and courtesans are practically protagonists in legends; I have no resistance to them."

Zhou Tian showed a look of understanding. So that was it. He seemed to have heard Emperor Qin mention that people from Daluo Academy had something to discuss with him when he was in the palace. He had thought Daluo Academy was merely a school within the Tianqin Empire, but he hadn't expected it to be a powerful force controlling an entire province.

"So you came to me like a useless person?"

"How could that be? How could I let those ladies be defiled by those pedantic scholars! I competed with them in all aspects of zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting!" Zhou Zui proudly held his head high, like a rooster defending its mate.

Zhou Tian scoffed, "You failed at all of them, didn't you?" Zither, chess, calligraphy, painting? Zhou Zui? Don't be ridiculous! Eating, drinking, whoring, gambling was more like it! How could Zhou Tian not know his true abilities?

"Yes…" Zhou Zui's head drooped.

"So you came to me like a useless person?"

"How could that be!" Zhou Zui raised his head again, his eyes filled with pride. "I beat all of them up!"

"And then your father beat you up!" Zhou Tian said without even thinking. The forces behind those people controlled an entire province. Even if the Tianqin Empire wouldn't hand Zhou Zui over for beating them up, they still had to save face.

"Yes…" Zhou Zui's head drooped again, like a defeated rooster. "My father told me to lay low for a while. After thinking it over, I could only come to you."

"Enough about me. How far have you and your Ling'er gone? Have you been in bed or out of bed?" Zhou Zui changed the subject, leaning in with a lewd expression.

"Get lost! Ling'er and I pursue spiritual love. Physical desires are not yet within our consideration!" Zhou Tian pushed him away with a look of disgust.

"No way!" Zhou Zui cried out exaggeratedly. "You haven't gotten into bed yet?"

"I plan to wait until we get married for that." Zhou Tian said casually.

"Big Brother, have you been possessed? How could you suddenly have such thoughts? Even Imperial Grandfather's generation didn't have such ideas! Are you still the Zhou Tian who fought the heavens with one silver spear in Wutian Hall?" Zhou Zui looked utterly incredulous.

"What nonsense are you spouting?" Zhou Tian said dismissively, then a smile involuntarily appeared on his face. "Life… it always needs a sense of ritual!" At that moment, he remembered yesterday, when Tian Ling, in his arms under the setting sun, looked up at him, her eyes slightly red and swollen, tears still clinging to her bright, crystal eyes. In those eyes, he saw his own reflection… Then why didn't he kiss her?!

"It's terrifying, it's terrifying! I must never get married in the future, it's too terrifying!" Zhou Zui looked at Zhou Tian's face, which shifted from happy to nostalgic to twisted, and couldn't help but exclaim.

Meanwhile, in that same mysterious space, on that same plot of land, the grand array was still carved into the ground. However, this time the array's range had expanded tenfold, reaching a staggering hundred thousand *li* in circumference. Countless亡魂 (wandering souls/ghosts) roared within the array, their numbers nearly ten times greater than last time. Some of them were even a hundred *zhang* tall, shrouded in black mist, with countless ghastly heads writhing on their bodies. They surged against the edges of the array, trying to break free, showing faint signs of nascent sentience. However, with each impact, some black mist was absorbed by the finger-thick array patterns in the void.

The skull altar in the center of the array had also grown to ten thousand *zhang* high and become much thicker. The bones composing the altar were even more meticulously chosen: skulls shimmering with purple lightning, arm bones whose Geng Metal energy could tear space, sword-qi-infused spinal bones, and breastbones radiating milky white light. Angels with twin wings flew about nearby. As the wandering souls approached, the mist around them dispersed, and their faces became serene, only to be instantly corroded by the array, their resentment growing even heavier.

On the skull altar stood the two black-robed figures, but this time they no longer had the easygoing demeanor of last time. The atmosphere was incredibly tense. If they failed this time, they would be eternally damned, with nowhere to run.

Without any unnecessary words, they took out the strands of hair and placed them into the juice of the Heavenly Blood Divine Lotus. This time, the milky white liquid was much larger in quantity than before. White lotuses bloomed in the void, exuding a pure fragrance.

This amount of Heavenly Blood Divine Lotus juice was sufficient for a second verification of whether the divine soul had truly perished!

Following the same steps as last time, the grand array began to operate. Yin winds howled, and ghastly green array patterns flickered. Countless wandering souls roared as humanity's most primal evil thoughts were extracted. As the last super-wandering soul, towering ten thousand *zhang* high, was refined, a fine black needle formed on the skull altar. Just looking at it made one feel dizzy.

One of the black-robed figures gritted his teeth and pulled a mass of black liquid from the void. A low chant resonated through the air—hatred, fury, desire, ecstasy, pain… a multitude of emotions reverberated!
