# Chapter 29: The Cloudwalk Method and the Secret Yuan Decree Arrow  

"Disciple Gu Yuan, bearing the Golden Core Jade Token, requests permission to receive a seal technique!"  

At the base of a seven-story cyan pagoda on Qingfeng Mountain, Gu Yuan held the jade token respectfully and called out.  

This pagoda was the most heavily guarded structure on Qingfeng Mountain, even more so than the Scripture Pavilion. It was the true core treasure of the Qingfeng Dao Academy—the Transmission Hall!  

While the Scripture Pavilion housed many classics, miscellaneous records, and some basic seal techniques, the truly profound and core cultivation arts were almost entirely absent. The Transmission Hall, however, was different. Every technique stored within was a genuine cultivation secret, exceedingly rare. Outside the academy, these techniques could incite bloodshed among rogue cultivators desperate to obtain them.  

Though the Qingfeng Dao Academy had many aristocratic families, each with their own secret methods, none could compare to the academy's deep-rooted heritage. After all, the academy's foundation was truly unfathomable.  

The reason the academy was not called a sect was that above it stood the Dao Palace, and above the Dao Palace was the Celestial Palace! Every founding ancestor of the academy had once been a member of the Celestial Palace, traveling the four realms to establish their legacy, hence the name "Dao Academy."  

In a sense, the academy was an institution under the jurisdiction of the Celestial Palace in the mortal world.  

However, these were merely rumors Gu Yuan had read about in the Scripture Pavilion. As for the actual connection between the academy and the Celestial Palace, no clear records existed.  

But the importance of the Transmission Hall was undeniable.  

This was not a place one could enter simply by paying spirit stones. Only those who had rendered meritorious service to the academy, earned contribution points, or received rewards from competitions like the grand academy tournament could gain entry.  

After all, the Dao was not to be lightly imparted.  

Ordinary seal techniques were abundant in the Scripture Pavilion, and instructors in the Hidden Dragon Hall would occasionally teach a few. But the Transmission Hall was different—its techniques were like dazzling treasures, each one exquisite.  

The seven-story cyan jade pagoda had no visible windows or doors, and no guards stood at its entrance. Yet Gu Yuan could sense an oppressive power permeating the air, making even the whistling wind feel icy.  

**"Buzz!"**  

As Gu Yuan called out, a brilliant light flickered atop the pagoda. Before he could react, a clear force surged from the tower and landed on his jade token. In the next moment, he vanished.  

When Gu Yuan opened his eyes again, he found himself inside the pagoda.  

Countless jade slips hovered in the air, arranged in orderly rows like walls of jade surrounding him.  

**"Jade Harmony True Seal!"**  

*"Once activated, this seal merges the cultivator's mana with the heavens and earth, amplifying it tenfold—even a hundredfold. A single strike carries the crushing weight of the world, unstoppable, capable of grinding an opponent to dust with sheer force alone!"*  

**"Thousand Radiance Gold Seal!"**  

*"This seal transforms the cultivator's mana into golden rays, stirring spiritual energy into razor-sharp brilliance. With each breath of cultivation, the rays accumulate. When a thousand rays are unleashed, their power becomes peerless."*  

**"Dense Cloud Clear Seal!"**  

*"Upon activation, this seal conjures green clouds beneath the feet, granting unparalleled agility and swift movement. Unless bound by a powerful locking technique, none can capture the user."*  

**"Gathering Extinction Seal!"**  

**"Bright Wheel Seal!"**  

**"..."**  

The Transmission Hall truly lived up to its reputation as the core of the Qingfeng Dao Academy. The number of high-grade secret seals was overwhelming, dazzling Gu Yuan’s eyes.  

He did not rush. Instead, he carefully examined each one.  

Before selecting a seal, the jade slips did not reveal the specific refinement methods, but they provided detailed introductions. For Gu Yuan, this was a golden opportunity to expand his knowledge.  

It couldn’t be helped—his previous life had been one of lowly origins, leaving him with scant understanding of many techniques. Now, by learning even a little, he could better prepare for future battles.  

This realization also made him sigh in relief: *Thank goodness I didn’t become a rogue cultivator or join the Demon Slayer Sect.*  

Otherwise, how much suffering would he have endured just to compete with disciples of major sects?  

Especially the true disciples and scions of noble families.  

Just this wealth of "knowledge and heritage" alone could crush a decade of cultivation.  

Gu Yuan also understood why the Golden Core Elder had not simply bestowed two seals upon him but instead granted him the jade token to choose for himself.  

Did a Golden Core cultivator truly lack two Qi Refinement-level seals?  

No—this was an opportunity for Gu Yuan to enter the Transmission Hall, broaden his horizons, and ensure he wouldn’t be caught off guard in future battles, losing his life due to ignorance.  

Thinking of this, Gu Yuan felt a surge of gratitude and silently vowed: *For the next ten days—no, a whole month—I won’t casually speculate about the Elder’s… personal habits.*  

---  

The seals in the Transmission Hall were vast in number. Gu Yuan spent an entire day reading, leaving him dizzy.  

But after this day, there was scarcely a Qi Refinement seal he didn’t recognize!  

"Though there are many seals here, the most superior are undoubtedly the secret seals!"  

"The foremost among them has to be this—the 'Golden Radiance Sword Seal'!"  

Gu Yuan gazed at the four jade slips floating before him, deep in thought.  

The central slip shimmered with golden light, faint sword hums resonating from it, exuding an extraordinary sharpness.  

This was the Qi Refinement version of the Qingfeng Dao Academy’s signature technique—the Golden Radiance Great Sword Seal!  

This sword seal was mighty and domineering, but it could only be mastered by those who had consumed the supreme-grade spiritual water, "Golden Howl Spirit Water."  

This was almost exclusively reserved for Golden Core true disciples.  

Though Gu Yuan had also consumed supreme-grade spiritual water, it was not the "Golden Howl Spirit Water," so he could not cultivate this seal.  

Different spiritual waters and different secret seals were key markers distinguishing the legacies of various sects.  

Yet, to Gu Yuan’s surprise, he was still permitted to choose this seal.  

It seemed the Golden Core Elder’s jade token was even more powerful than he had imagined.  

With a flick of his finger, Gu Yuan dismissed this seal, leaving only the other three slips.  

**"Cloudwalk Method Secret Seal!"**  

*"One of the water-based secret seals!"*  

*"When activated, this seal can manipulate the heavens, summoning torrential rain and dense fog that envelops an area of ten zhang. Within the rain, all other techniques are suppressed; within the fog, all senses are obscured. Only those with immense power can break free."*  

This was the seal Gu Yuan favored the most!  

It could summon rain and mist to suppress enemy spells while also obscuring spiritual senses and confusing perception. Whether for killing, trapping, fleeing, or ambushing, it was an unparalleled choice.  

Moreover, the stronger the spiritual sense and the deeper the mana reserves, the greater the seal’s power. This was a technique Gu Yuan had meticulously selected!  

This single seal alone surpassed the combined utility of several high-grade seals.  

*"This seal is perfectly suited to me. I must choose it!"*  

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan plucked the jade slip from the air.  

**"Buzz!"**  

A profound force descended within the jade pagoda, lifting the restrictions on the slip.  

But at the same time, the glow of the jade token in Gu Yuan’s hand dimmed by half.  

*"Only one more choice left!"*  

Gu Yuan sighed, then turned his attention to the remaining slips.  

**"Nine Elephants Secret Seal!"**  

*"This seal condenses spiritual energy into water, summoning a colossal water elephant to trample enemies. With each Qi Refinement layer, an additional elephant can be summoned. If the seal is reversed, the nine elephants merge into the body, temporarily granting immense physical strength—an extremely domineering technique."*  

**"Secret Yuan Decree Arrow Seal!"**  

*"This seal contains one hundred and thirty-six Dao patterns, like successive waves that grow stronger with each layer. In battle, activating the seal ignites these patterns, releasing a decree arrow. The more patterns ignited, the more powerful the arrow. If all one hundred and thirty-six patterns are lit, the arrow’s force can shake heaven and earth."*  

Of these two, one was a secret seal, the other an ordinary technique.  

But the latter’s concentrated and terrifying power made the choice difficult for Gu Yuan.
