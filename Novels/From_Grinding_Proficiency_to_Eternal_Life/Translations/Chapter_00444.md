# Chapter 444: You Are the Real Demonic Being!

Although Xu Yunfan said those words, he had already begun calculating in his heart. When the Thunder Beads were nearly depleted, perhaps he should proactively pay a visit to the Immortal Palace.

A True Lord never acts without purpose; every step is calculated.

Bestowing this technique meant that extremely difficult tasks would likely be assigned to him in the future.

If he did not find ways to strengthen his own foundation, the one who would end up in an embarrassing position would be himself.

Xu Yunfan let out a breath.

On the path of cultivation, luck and opportunities are equally crucial.

Although he had joined the forces of Qingyuan True Lord, he was still just a newcomer.

The True Lord had few disciples, and those who earned his favor not only needed exceptional talent but also had to be accompanied by great fortune.

If it hadn't been for the invitation from Hundred Peaks True Lord this time, he would likely have met with misfortune the moment he stepped out of the Divine Martial Realm.

Those Foundation Establishment True Lords lurking in the shadows were all eyeing him like tigers, specifically targeting solitary cultivators to strike.

With his meager cultivation, which had not yet reached Foundation Establishment, and without the protection of a True Lord, let alone Foundation Establishment treasures, he probably wouldn't have lasted even half a day.

On the path of cultivation, one wrong step leads to another, and opportunities are fleeting.

Now that he was under the True Lord's command, it was like obtaining a protective talisman; ordinary villains would not dare act rashly.

Xu Yunfan was clear-headed about this. Although this opportunity was good, it was not a long-term plan, and he absolutely could not just settle into comfort.

The Primordial Origin Sect has always followed the principle that the strong are revered. If he did not strive for progress and his value was exhausted, a figure like Qingyuan True Lord would certainly not spare a single shred of sentiment.

This is the rule of the sect, and the True Lord's residence is no charity. Being able to receive temporary protection is already a rare opportunity.

He knew well the cruelty of the cultivation world, or rather, he knew well the modus operandi of the Primordial Origin Sect. There are countless examples of being a guest at the banquet one day and becoming a prisoner the next.

Such things happen all the time, occurring within the Primordial Origin Sect every single day.

Cases of turning the tables and becoming the master are extremely rare.

Although he currently enjoyed temporary stability by leveraging the True Lord's prestige, if he could not continuously demonstrate his value, he would eventually be discarded like worn-out shoes.

This sense of crisis always lingered in his heart, preventing him from slacking off in the slightest.

"The path of immortality is completely different from what I imagined..."

Xu Yunfan let out a breath, suppressed his distracting thoughts, and began to consolidate his realm, diligently practicing his proficiency.

He first practiced the "Tortoise and Snake Coiling" defensive technique from the *True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture*. The phantom of the Black Tortoise appeared around his body. Then, he activated the *Myriad Chariot Transformation Sword Art*, using the power of thunder. His innate Thunder Sword practiced the basic sword forms of the *Myriad Chariot Transformation Sword Art*, causing thunder to crisscross within the cave dwelling. When he had spare time, he would study the *Introduction to Array Formations*.

With the Attribute Panel, the *Introduction to Array Formations* was not particularly difficult for him. Every time he contemplated it and simulated setting up formations, he received information prompts of increased proficiency.

Cultivation knows no seasons; time flies like an arrow. In the blink of an eye, five years passed.

Xu Yunfan was immersed in his cultivation, practicing day and night without rest. With the help of the Attribute Panel, he continuously improved his cultivation.

He diligently practiced the *True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture*, honing the "Tortoise and Snake Coiling" technique. The Black Tortoise phantom around him became increasingly solid. His innate Thunder Sword, driven by the *Myriad Chariot Transformation Sword Art*, grew sharper in its sword intent. As thunder crisscrossed, sword energy surged within the cave dwelling.

Additionally, he did not neglect his study of array formations. Whenever he studied the *Introduction to Array Formations* and simulated setting up arrays, the proficiency on his Attribute Panel steadily increased.

Over these five years, he dared not slack off in the slightest.

However, just as he was immersing himself in cultivation, a sudden disturbance occurred outside True Martial Peak.

A massive commotion instantly awakened him.

Xu Yunfan's expression darkened. He stood up and tore away the concealment array formation at the True Martial Cave. The moment he stepped out of the cave dwelling, the mountain wind, carrying a sharp spiritual pressure, rushed at him.

Looking up, he saw a middle-aged man in black robes standing before his peak.

The middle-aged man in black robes stood with his hands behind his back on a green stone ten zhang away. His dark-colored Daoist robe moved without wind, and the dark red centipede patterns embroidered on the hem glimmered with a blood-like light under the sun.

The man's face was sharp as if carved by a blade, and a dark purple vertical line between his eyebrows flickered with his breath. This was a manifestation of his unique spiritual power; the opponent had clearly cultivated some kind of eye technique.

The middle-aged man in black robes exuded a surging aura. Amidst the swirling gray-white mist, a chilling killing intent was faintly discernible.

Xu Yunfan's gaze narrowed as he carefully sensed the other party's aura. Although the spiritual power was condensed, it had not yet reached the thickness of a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator. Evidently, he was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage.

What was even more noteworthy was that the gray-white mist surrounding him was not ordinary spiritual power but was formed from the condensation of countless souls. Within the strands of mist, distorted human faces were faintly visible, emitting silent wails.

These swirling mists, upon closer inspection, were all forged from living souls.

This was a typical demonic path style.

To cultivate such a aura of life and death, he must have consumed quite a few people.

This kind of sinister method confirmed to Xu Yunfan that the Primordial Origin Sect was indeed the Primordial Demon Sect. The gray-white mist was a soul-refining method commonly used by demonic path cultivators.

Having seen so many Foundation Establishment True Lords practicing grand and righteous methods within the Primordial Origin Sect, he had almost forgotten he was in a demonic sect after all this time.

Xu Yunfan felt a moment of daze.

"Early Foundation Establishment, yet he has cultivated such a sinister technique..."

"Such a heavy blood-slaughter aura."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed as his gaze swept over the defensive array at the mountain gate, which had been broken by brute force.

The "Nine Palaces Array" originally arranged according to the *Introduction to Array Formations* was now in ruins. Three of the eight Blue Dark Stones serving as the array eyes had shattered, and the remaining five were covered in cracks like spiderwebs.

Although this array formation was not top-tier, being able to find the life gate and break it so precisely showed that the intruder had considerable attainments in array formations.

Seeing Xu Yunfan examining the remnants of the array, the black-robed True Lord laughed coldly: "Junior Brother is quite cautious. It's a pity that such a shallow array formation, if said to be exquisite, also possesses a bit of the true essence of the craft. You must have immersed yourself in this array for decades to reach this level, right?"

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. This was a defensive array he had领悟ed after the *Introduction to Array Formations* reached a small success three years ago. Although it was called a defensive array, it focused more on confusion, with slightly weaker defensive performance.

Although this array was casually arranged outside the mountain gate, relying on the array characteristics accumulated over the years, combined with the insight of his Martial Dao Heavenly Eye and the assistance of a Foundation Establishment cultivator's unique spiritual sense, Xu Yunfan was already well-versed in the trends of the mountain terrain and spiritual veins.

With just one glance, he could accurately detect the nodes of the earth's veins and arrange the array at the most critical spiritual pivot.

In this way, even an ordinary "Nine Palaces Array," after his adjustments and arrangements, would see its power increase by at least thirty percent.

As he spoke, the black-robed True Lord suddenly raised his foot and stomped. The remaining array stones exploded with a bang. "It couldn't stop this Lord for even half a quarter of an hour."

Xu Yunfan's mouth twitched slightly upon hearing this.

This was a bit too much of a show-off.

Although he really wanted to plant his fist on the other party's face, the proper procedure still had to be followed. Otherwise, if he accidentally offended some True Lord, it wouldn't be good.

With Qingyuan True Lord standing behind him, but if he sought help too often, it would make him seem like a troublemaker.

That wouldn't be good.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh inwardly. He wondered if he was just unlucky or if his fortune had declined, or perhaps after forging his Dao Foundation and becoming a Foundation Establishment True Lord, he had used up all his luck.

Even when staying behind closed doors, someone came looking for trouble.

"This Senior Brother looks unfamiliar."
