# Chapter 23: A Desolate Mountain Temple

Scarface stared blankly at the broken blade in his hand.

"I feel like I've seen this scene before."

Both Lin Shan and Scarface thought the same thing simultaneously.

...

The situation was extremely awkward.

But what happened next was completely different from before—Scarface decisively threw away the broken blade and turned to flee!

After all, this time he had no teammates around, and there were no weapons on the ground to pick up. Even if he found a new one, it would be useless.

What Scarface didn't know was that Lin Shan's weapon had just transformed into a divine armament. During the enhancement, Scarface only saw a flash of white light and had no idea what changes occurred inside. He merely assumed Lin Shan had unleashed some hidden trump card, like a powerful internal martial technique or secret skill.

Moreover, they had been clashing blades evenly earlier, so he didn't consider the possibility of the weapon itself changing.

But the problem was, his newly purchased broadsword hadn't even warmed up in his hands before it was destroyed again.

"Damn Nightingale logistics! It must be a quality issue! I'm filing a complaint!"

As he fled for his life, Scarface glanced back at Lin Shan, who was hot on his heels, and cursed the Nightingale logistics procurement team in his heart.

"I can accept the canteen being run by some relative's cronies, but weapons too? Are you kidding me?"

Scarface was bitter. He had saved up contribution points for years to exchange for a blade technique and even bought a new sword to avoid a repeat of last time's failure. Despite all his preparations, something still went wrong!

Why? Why was fate toying with him like this?

...

Behind him, Lin Shan pursued relentlessly, the Kunwu Blade in hand radiating killing intent.

Wielding a divine weapon felt incredible!

The Evergreen True Qi continuously repaired his internal injuries, and Lin Shan's condition improved steadily. The advantages of an innate cultivation technique became evident now—its endurance far surpassed that of acquired techniques.

Did Scarface really think he could escape? How naive!

Lin Shan raised his palm toward Scarface and lightly flicked his little finger. A faint mechanical click sounded.

"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"

Hearing the sudden whistling sounds, Scarface looked back and nearly lost his soul in terror.

"Holy shit! Sleeve arrows!"

As a Nightingale assassin, how could he not recognize this vicious hidden weapon that cost 50 contribution points to exchange?

But who in their right mind would spend their hard-earned points on this instead of saving up for cultivation techniques or martial arts? Only a fool would waste points on such things!

...

Scarface dodged left and right desperately, but the plum blossom sleeve arrows fired six shots at once—one in the center and five surrounding it, resembling a plum blossom, hence the name. Despite his serpentine evasive maneuvers, Scarface couldn't avoid them all and took one to his right calf.

"Thud!"

After tumbling to the ground and scrambling back up, Scarface knew his injured leg would prevent escape. Reluctantly, he stopped running and turned around, his face filled with indignation.

"Fine, fine! Xin Twenty-One, I knew I wasn't wrong about you. To think you still had such a trump card up your sleeve. Today, it's either you or me!"

What martial artist didn't know a few fist techniques? Scarface threw himself into a desperate last stand, fists flying.

Lin Shan didn't hesitate either, meeting him head-on with a palm strike.

"Bam! Bam! Bam!"

Their fists and palms collided repeatedly, dull thuds echoing through the air.

After one breath, Scarface's right arm began to feel numb and itchy.

After three breaths, his right arm had shrunk by a full circle.

After five breaths, his right arm hung limp, completely numb.

Scarface stared blankly at his lifeless arm and heaved a long sigh.

"Xin Twenty-One, I knew I wasn't wrong about you. To think you still had such a trump card—"

Lin Shan rubbed his temples in exasperation. "Alright, alright, are you a broken record? Can't you say anything else?"

Scarface gaped at him stupidly. After a while, he opened his mouth again.

"Xin Twenty-One, to think someone as young as you—"

"Enough already!"

Scarface roared, "Can't I even speak now?!"

...

The crisp mountain breeze carried away the scent of blood. Lin Shan buried Scarface in a shallow grave and stuck a few small branches into the dirt as a makeshift memorial.

Scarface had been a true warrior—not a single word of begging for mercy escaped his lips before death. He only lamented his ill fortune and cursed the Nightingale logistics team.

Upon reflection, Lin Shan admitted Scarface's "Three Styles of Tyrant Blade" had been formidable. Without the enhancement panel's last-minute reversal, he might have truly met his end here.

This incident served as a sobering reminder—never underestimate anyone, no matter how insignificant they seemed.

A mere Scarface had possessed such martial prowess and cunning, not only tracking his mission movements in advance and lying in wait at the tunnel entrance but also preparing new weapons and secret techniques. Even a lion uses its full strength to hunt a rabbit.

The world was vast, and talented individuals were as numerous as fish in a river. A single moment of carelessness could lead to an early demise.

With his greatest threat eliminated, the weight pressing on Lin Shan's heart finally lifted, leaving him feeling lighter than ever.

...

"Brother Chicken? Brother Chicken?"

Returning to the mountainside cave, Lin Shan searched everywhere for the rooster but couldn't find it. The clever fowl had vanished without a trace.

"To encounter such an intelligent poultry only to lose it—what a shame!"

As noon approached, Lin Shan realized he'd been operating at peak mental and physical intensity since last night. Exhausted and starving, he eventually descended the mountain alone with his antiques in tow.

...

After a meal in Taoyuan Village, Lin Shan followed the villagers' directions and walked fifty li to a deserted temple.

Night had fallen by the time he arrived. The desolate mountain was eerily quiet, the moonlight casting an even lonelier and more sinister atmosphere over the strange rocks and trees.

But armed with his divine weapon, Lin Shan's courage soared. Even if a Viscera Tempering expert appeared now, he felt confident in his ability to fight!

His purpose in coming here was twofold—to rest for the night and to test a certain hypothesis.

...

Pushing open the temple doors, Lin Shan used a fire starter to light the candles on the altar and around the hall, bringing some warmth to the chilly interior.

Setting down his heavy包袱, he rested briefly on a cushion before the Buddha statue while observing his surroundings. There were signs of recent cleaning—likely from local villagers who still practiced Buddhism despite the Black Lotus Sect's recent encroachment on religious influence.

The golden Buddha statue before him stood about three zhang tall, its benevolent expression radiating compassion for all living beings. Its eyes seemed to hold profound wisdom, having witnessed countless changes through the ages.

"Forgive my impertinence!"

Lin Shan bowed slightly before reaching out to touch the incense burner, wooden fish, and porcelain fruit offerings on the altar. The enhancement panel remained inactive.

"Huh?"

This was strange. Why did items from the Black Lotus Sect carry ancient essence, while those before an authentic Buddha statue didn't?

Could it be...?

Bowing again and silently apologizing, Lin Shan gingerly touched the golden Buddha statue itself. This time, the enhancement panel reacted:

[Buddha's Golden Body]
Quality: Mundane Object
Description: The Dharma Body of the Buddha from the immortal realm, used to communicate across worlds and remotely absorb the power of faith
Ancient Essence: 2 (depleting)

...

Well, well—looks like I've hooked a big fish!

Does this mean the Buddha himself is absorbing ancient essence? Am I stealing food from the Buddha's mouth? The thought startled Lin Shan.

But upon further reflection, he reconsidered.

No, the Buddha must be absorbing the power of faith, while my enhancement panel can absorb not just that but also fortune and cultural essence—all converted into ancient essence.

"What exactly is ancient essence...?"

It could defy physical laws to instantly upgrade items. Ancient essence must exist on a far higher level than the faith power the Buddha absorbed.

Lin Shan felt he'd accidentally stumbled upon an earth-shattering secret!

...

Now came the dilemma: should he absorb these two points of ancient essence or not?

After much deliberation, he made his decision.

Absorb!

First, the Buddha resided in the immortal realm while he was in the mortal world—who knew how vast the distance between them was? The Buddha might not even notice.

Even if he did, would he really intervene across dimensions for a measly two points of ancient essence? The cost wouldn't justify the effort—it'd be a net loss!

Gritting his teeth, Lin Shan selected "Yes" on the "Absorb?" prompt.

...

But the next instant, he felt an indescribable gaze lock onto him from beyond the endless void.
