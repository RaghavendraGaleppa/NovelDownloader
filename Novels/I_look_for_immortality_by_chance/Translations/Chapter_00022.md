# Chapter 22: The Edict of the Dao Academy!

"Screech!"

A falcon's sharp cry seemed to echo through the air as a dazzling talisman ignited the spiritual energy between heaven and earth. Blue lightning crackled into existence out of thin air, tearing through the void and hurtling towards Gu Yuan.

Gu Yuan remained motionless, channeling his own spiritual power to activate an earthen-yellow talisman nurtured within his dantian. A hazy silhouette materialized in the air as mist swirled, revealing a massive black tortoise emerging from the water to shield him.

"Boom!"

Water and lightning clashed violently, instantly drenching the area before the cave abode as if a sudden downpour had passed.

"Buzz—"

Yet the blue lightning proved overwhelmingly fierce, seemingly draining all spiritual energy within several zhang. The scorching thunder surged relentlessly, and despite the black tortoise's desperate resistance, it shattered under the assault. The dimmed talisman retreated back into Gu Yuan's dantian, while the residual lightning continued its assault.

"As expected of a noble disciple from Qingfeng Dao Academy—this 'Falcon Thunder Talisman' is indeed extraordinary," Gu Yuan sighed, seeing his Black Tortoise Talisman defeated in mere moments.

Yet he remained unshaken. With a flick of his sleeve, an ice-blue talisman shot forth from his dantian, harnessing the surrounding spiritual energy to form a frigid chain that collided with the oncoming lightning.

"Crack!"

The weakened lightning shattered upon impact, transforming into shards of icy-blue residue that scattered across the ground, freezing and scorching the vegetation before dissipating into the air.

Though Gu Yuan had blocked this strike, Lan Tianlu's offensive surged forth like a tidal wave.

Combat between cultivators was no rigid turn-based game.

After the initial probing, three radiant talismans erupted from Lan Tianlu's dantian, channeling spiritual energy with majestic force as they pressed down upon Gu Yuan.

Not stopping there, his cloud-patterned boots shimmered as he leaped onto the back of a winged celestial steed. A crimson spear materialized in his grasp, its tip crackling with surging lightning as he charged at Gu Yuan with thunderous momentum.

The Lan Clan bore the bloodline of an exotic lineage, evident in their silver hair and blue eyes. Beyond their affinity for thunder-based talismans, their spear techniques were peerless.

Now, mounted and spear in hand, Lan Tianlu unleashed his full might—this was a battle to the death.

"Earth-Sinking Talisman!"

"Net-Weaving Talisman!"

"Purple Radiance Talisman!"

The earthen-brown Earth-Sinking Talisman invoked spiritual energy, manifesting as a crushing gravitational force that pressed down on Gu Yuan like a mountain.

The Net-Weaving Talisman gleamed silver, spinning layers of ethereal spider silk that ensnared Gu Yuan's limbs.

The Purple Radiance Talisman crackled with lightning, striking like a true thunderbolt—its power the most formidable of all.

And this was without considering Lan Tianlu, mounted on his celestial steed, wielding a top-grade magical spear with dragon-like ferocity.

This coordinated assault showcased Lan Tianlu's determination to win.

Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh deeply, realizing victory was beyond his reach.

Yet his objective here had already been achieved.

It was time to end this farce.

"Suppress!" Gu Yuan uttered softly, yet his voice carried the weight of divine decree.

"Boom!"

A surge of dense spiritual energy erupted from the cave abode behind him. Brilliant formation patterns shimmered into view—some resembling golden swords, others like blazing suns—their resonant hums invoking the most terrifying power within Qingfeng Dao Academy.

The academy's guardian formation—the Molten Sun Golden Light Array.

Though only a sliver of its power was summoned, it was more than enough.

"Bang!"

A razor-sharp sword light descended from the heavens, instantly suppressing the three talismans before Lan Tianlu. The overwhelming force vibrated like a falling mountain.

"Thud!"

Lan Tianlu, powerless to resist, was crushed from his celestial steed. His handsome face was pressed into the mud as if stomped upon by an invisible foot.

"Gu Yuan!" he roared, his voice muffled by the dirt. "This was a Life-and-Death Duel! How dare you invoke the formation?! Coward! Release me at once, or the Enforcement Hall will rain thunderous punishment upon you!"

Lan Tianlu never imagined Gu Yuan would resort to the cave's formation during a duel. This was sheer treachery!

Struggling to lift his head, he could only spew curses into the mud, his appearance utterly wretched.

"Who goes there?!" a stern voice boomed. "Who dares invoke the guardian formation? Are we under invasion?"

In an instant, a streak of light arrived—a white-robed elder hovering mid-air, his gaze icy as it swept over Gu Yuan and Lan Tianlu. In his hand gleamed a golden token, radiant and pulsing with immense power.

As the token appeared, the formation patterns above Gu Yuan's cave stabilized, their terrifying might still firmly pinning Lan Tianlu down.

"Disciples of which lineage are you? What transpires here to warrant the guardian formation's activation?" the elder demanded, his cultivation unfathomable. Clad in white robes, he was clearly no Qi Refining disciple but a Foundation Establishment elder.

"Elder," Gu Yuan clasped his hands respectfully, "this intruder stormed my cave abode, seeking to harm a fellow disciple. I had no choice but to activate the formation in self-defense. I beg for your fair judgment."

"Nonsense!" Lan Tianlu's furious voice rose from the dirt. "You challenged me to a Life-and-Death Duel! That's why I attacked!"

"Life-and-Death Duel?" The elder frowned.

Qingfeng Dao Academy, as a major sect, had its own laws. Internal conflicts were forbidden, and oppression by force was prohibited.

Yet cultivators were inherently contentious, their hearts harboring grudges and their methods ruthless. Suppressing disputes entirely would only breed underhanded schemes.

Thus, the academy permitted three forms of sanctioned conflict:

First, the Duel of Arts—a contest of skill where no lives were lost. The loser would apologize and compensate the victor with spirit stones, settling the matter.

Second, the Duel of Dao—a clash of irreconcilable ideals. The loser would be exiled to the Southern Sea Branch Academy, guarding its waters, never to return to Qingfeng Mountain.

Third, the Life-and-Death Duel—a wager of everything: life, possessions, cave abodes, spirit stones. The loser lost all; the winner took everything.

Typically, disciples engaged in the first two. Life-and-Death Duels were rare, for they ended only in utter defeat or death.

"A Life-and-Death Duel requires petitioning the Enforcement Hall, submitting a golden decree, and sealing the pact in blood," Gu Yuan retorted coldly. "You possess neither decree nor blood seal. This was no duel—just a noble scion bullying a new disciple!"

"By the academy's laws, I invoked the formation to suppress you. What of it?"

With that, he hurled a book at Lan Tianlu's face.

The tome was thick, its cover slate-gray, emblazoned with four stark characters:

**The Edict of the Dao Academy!**
