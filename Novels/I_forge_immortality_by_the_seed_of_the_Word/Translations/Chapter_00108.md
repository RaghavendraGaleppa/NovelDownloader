# Chapter 106: Stirring Up Competition

High in the Sixth Celestial Void.

The familiar jet-black蛟 dragon abruptly appeared, the extreme cold and yin energy emanating from its body astonishingly dense, its roar seemingly capable of piercing the firmament with its murderous intent.

Due to the increased potency of his Dao Intent, the Frost White Wind Banner seemed to tremble with excitement, emitting an unprecedentedly intense fluctuation.

The dozens of丈 jet-black 蛟 dragon swiftly drilled into the seventh step.

In an instant, it flew out again, its massive body sweeping ferociously towards the eighth step.

Eighth level!

Ninth level!

The spirit guardian of these two levels of the Ascension Ladder did not hinder Zhang Jing's progress.

At this moment, his expression was extremely calm.

Just now, within the Myriad God Treasure Trove, Zhang Jing complained, but that was only because he disliked the slow progress of comprehending Dao Intent, not because he questioned its power.

In fact, as Dao Intent, every step forward brought a huge increase in strength.

Especially when there was also an ice-cold attribute magic treasure in the Five Treasures Spirit River.

As if piercing through a barrier, a strange world suddenly appeared before Zhang Jing's eyes.

However, the moment he saw it clearly, he couldn't help but be stunned.

"What the hell?"

In his view, a giant mountain, towering who knows how many tens of thousands of丈 high and spanning who knows how many tens of thousands of miles wide, stood majestically. The thick clouds in the sky only barely reached the mountainside.

The foot of the mountain was buried in a bottomless, dark void.

The summit of the mountain directly pierced into the firmament.

At the point where the mountain peak met the sky, faint, dark cracks could be seen constantly forming, spreading in all directions, but disappearing in the blink of an eye.

The entire Seventh Celestial Void contained nothing but this giant mountain.

"That should be the Ascension Ladder, right?"

Zhang Jing's gaze fell on the nine small platforms that followed the giant mountain all the way up.

The originally vast Ascension Ladder appeared extremely miniature and petite against the backdrop of the giant mountain.

"I'll call you Tongtian Mountain."

He smiled slightly, giving the giant mountain a pleasant name.

Zhang Jing flew straight towards the Ascension Ladder.

First level!

Second level!

It was not until he broke through to the fifth level that Zhang Jing was stopped.

Looking at the terrifying Azure Ox spirit guardian opposite him, he looked as if he was looking at ten thousand Spirit Essence, his face filled with unconcealed excitement.

The Dao patterns in his palm flickered non-stop.

He didn't expect that killing a spirit guardian in the Seventh Celestial Void would yield ten thousand Spirit Essence. Then, killing ordinary demon spirits should yield around ten thousand Spirit Essence.

Zhang Jing confidently guessed.

Compared to spirit guardians, he felt that ordinary demon spirits were easier to bully.

On the opposite side, a hint of solemnity had already appeared in the Azure Ox spirit's eyes, and the fighting spirit on its body began to boil.

It seemed to have sensed the terrifying Dao Intent on Zhang Jing's body as well.

This was a powerful and respectable opponent!

However, the next moment, a flash of rainbow light.

Zhang Jing's figure disappeared instantly, leaving only an afterimage in place.

On the face of the afterimage, a faint smile could be vaguely seen.

Moo!

The Azure Ox's eyes turned red, and two white plumes of air spewed out of its large nostrils.

At this moment, in the Sixth Celestial Void, dozens of gazes remained fixed on the ninth Ascension Ladder, unwilling to move away.

Some time ago, Zhang Jing became famous throughout the Sixth Celestial Void for sitting by the lake for twenty days.

His signature methods had naturally gradually become known to many inner disciples.

Therefore, when these people below saw the jet-black 蛟 dragon coiled around the Ascension Ladder, they instantly confirmed that it was Zhang Jing.

However...

When they saw him break through three levels of the Ascension Ladder in one breath, many inner disciples couldn't help but be stunned.

They had seen people improve quickly, but they had never seen anyone improve so quickly.

In just one month, he could break through three levels, especially including the last level?

One must know that this was the Sixth Celestial Void, not the lower three Celestial Voids, which were like playing house.

Even if he was a monster, this was simply unreasonable!

Thinking back to Zhang Jing's experience of sitting by the lake, a thought flashed through everyone's minds at the same time:

Zhang Jing's strength improved so quickly, it must be related to that lake! There must be some great opportunity hidden there.

Looking at it now, it wasn't that this monster had a problem, it was clearly that they had a problem.

Hundreds of Foundation Establishment inner disciples had been in the Sixth Celestial Void for so long, but not a single one of them had discovered that the lake was not simple.

In the end, they had to rely on a Qi Refining junior brother to discover it.

Of course, they only needed to know the process of this discovery themselves.

In an instant, without any discussion, countless beams of light rose from different locations in the Sixth Celestial Void.

Their target was surprisingly consistent!

The wooden door was pushed open.

Qiū Xiūyún, who saw Zhang Jing's farewell message, had not yet recovered from the shock when he saw dozens or hundreds of beams of light flying away into the distance, a spectacular scene.

His expression changed, and he hurriedly transformed into a beam of light, following them towards the small lake.

The opportunity of the small lake was discovered by Junior Brother Zhang Jing, so it naturally belonged to their Dragon Lake Dao Academy. What right did those inner disciples from the other two Dao Academies have to go there?

What did they want to do!

Thousands of miles were covered in an instant.

When Qiū Xiūyún arrived at the blue lake, he discovered that the lakeside was already surrounded by people from various Dao Academies.

Among them, three figures wearing different colored robes were confronting each other with swords drawn, and a battle was about to break out.

Among these three figures, Hǎo Mùzhào, wearing a yellow robe, had the strongest aura.

Qiū Xiūyún landed on the side of the Dragon Lake Dao Academy, quietly watching.

"Everyone, the opportunity of this lake was discovered by a junior brother of our Dragon Lake Dao Academy. It's not good for you to openly snatch it like this, is it?"

A purple-robed cultivator from the Dragon Lake Dao Academy said loudly.

"Junior Brother Xīn, it's impossible for your Dragon Lake Dao Academy to swallow it alone. Senior Brother won't bully you with strength. Let's divide the shore of this lake into three equal parts, and everyone takes one."

Hǎo Mùzhào said with a smile.

The people from the Divine Firmament Dao Academy did not speak, obviously agreeing with this plan.

On the other side, just as this matter was about to be settled, Qiū Xiūyún suddenly stood up and threatened:

"Senior Brother Hǎo, you are strong and about to enter the Seventh Celestial Void. But don't forget, Junior Brother Zhang Jing is still waiting for you in the Seventh Celestial Void. Are you sure you want to be so excessive?"

Hearing this, Hǎo Mùzhào's expression changed, and his momentum weakened by three points.

"Then what is Junior Brother Qiū's plan?"

"Dragon Lake wants half of the area, and you two can divide the remaining area yourselves." Qiū Xiūyún's voice was firm.

After thinking about it, Hǎo Mùzhào said with a firm expression: "Okay, but the position where Junior Brother Zhang Jing sat at the beginning will be shared by everyone!"

"This is the bottom line!" He added, seemingly afraid that Qiū Xiūyún would refuse.

"No problem."

Time passed slowly.

Half a month later, in the Seventh Celestial Void, a corner of Tongtian Mountain.

Boom—

The jet-black 蛟 dragon simply flicked its tail and directly smashed a demon tiger, which was three 丈 tall, away.

The demon tiger lost its breath before it even landed in mid-air, and its body slowly turned into spiritual light and dissipated.

The spiritual light in his palm flickered slightly.

Spirit Essence plus ten thousand!

[Spirit Essence: 1,654,700]
