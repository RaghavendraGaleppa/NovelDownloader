Chapter 96: Desire to Go Beyond

"If the Mountain Lord were to die in battle, we'd both go our separate ways. Ah, wait a minute, the Golden-armored Guard's head has already fallen?" The Sparrow stared wide-eyed. It exclaimed excitedly, "The Mountain Lord's splendor shines upon the desert today; that was a single saber strike that slayed a Saint!"

The Red Eagle couldn't speak, otherwise it would have retorted long ago, thinking: What are you shouting about? You were just about to run away!

Qin Ming's mouth was full of bloody foam, his internal organs ached intensely, and his hands were swollen like bear paws, covered in tearing wounds that almost exposed his finger bones. Despite the pain, he felt spiritually satisfied. He forced himself to sit up, wiping the blood from his mouth.

"Red Eagle, carry me away!" He knew he couldn't delay. If there were more pursuers, he would certainly perish here. "Fangwai Land, some old acquaintances... I've noted this debt!" Qin Ming swayed as he stood, staggering as he walked, his feet a bloody mess, likely with bone injuries.

"Mountain Lord, truly worthy of divine talent!" The Sparrow rushed over. It wasn't just flattery; it was genuinely astonished. It knew Qin Ming inside out. Only two or three months ago, he had just undergone his first rebirth, surviving in the mountains. Now, this young man could actually slay a Saint! Although it might have been an entry-level New Saint with shallow foundations, a kill was a kill. This was a tangible achievement that no one could erase. The Sparrow was truly amazed and impressed.

Qin Ming, ever frugal and practical, quickly rummaged through the Golden-armored Guard's body, taking some Daylight Gold. He weakly sprawled on the Red Eagle's back as it soared into the night sky. He was covered in blood and extremely weak, completely unable to stand against the wind. Qin Ming activated the Rebirth Method from the silk scroll, recovering his essence, qi, and spirit. Although his body still ached intensely, his strength was rapidly recovering, and his Heavenly Light Energy flowed once more.

"Fly along the edge of the desert and return to Scarlet Cloud City as quickly as possible!" He directed the Red Eagle. The Sparrow also landed on the Red Eagle's back, near Qin Ming. "Aren't you returning to Black and White Mountain?" Qin Ming asked it, expressing his gratitude. Earlier, it had mimicked Qin Ming's speech, demonstrating remarkable coordination. With eyes like black gemstones, the Sparrow replied, "I won't rest easy until I see you safely reach Scarlet Cloud City."

"Thanks to both of you this time, I will repay you in the future by helping you find spiritual substances," Qin Ming said to the Sparrow and the Red Eagle. Under the dark night sky, the Red Eagle pierced through clouds and mist. There were no further incidents along the way, and no other pursuers came after them.

In the eyes of certain "old acquaintances," Qin Ming had only recently embarked on the path of rebirth, his strength limited. He wasn't even qualified to be a Golden-armored Guard and could be easily eradicated. The deployment of a Fangwai individual and an Outer Saint tonight was, in some people's view, akin to using an ox-slaughtering knife to kill a chicken.

Under the night sky, Scarlet Cloud City was a blur. Qin Ming breathed a sigh of relief; he had finally returned.

...

At the City Lord's Mansion, in the quaint living room, Meng Xinghai looked at the blood-soaked Qin Ming and frowned, "You're actually wounded so severely?" "I was pursued and almost couldn't make it back." Qin Ming wasn't sure if killing a Fangwai individual and an Outer Saint would cause a stir, so he came directly here.

"Did you encounter formidable Golden Thieves?" Meng Xinghai asked. Qin Ming shook his head, saying, "Those aging Golden Thieves were nothing; I killed many along the way. This time, I was mainly targeted by Fangwai disciples."

Meng Xinghai had someone clean his wounds and apply medicine, saying, "It's good that you're back alive. You don't need to worry; Scarlet Cloud City is not a place for those juniors to act wildly." He asked Qin Ming how he had shaken off his pursuers. "I couldn't shake them off, so I killed them all." "What level were those people at?" Meng Xinghai asked. Qin Ming replied, "A black-clad girl, probably in the late stage of the Heart Cleansing Realm. And... an Outer Saint."

Initially, Meng Xinghai was still nodding, not feeling surprised. After all, Qin Ming was "somewhat" stronger than the young exceptional talents. However, what did he hear in the latter half of the sentence? There was an Outer Saint!

Meng Xinghai shot to his feet, a clear ripple of emotion crossing his face. Qin Ming knew that overly brilliant achievements could also be troublesome. He explained, "I cleverly survived a fatal tribulation, using the Sky-Hammer to take more than half of his life..."

Meng Xinghai personally examined him, saying, "Your physical body nearly collapsed, and your bones are slightly damaged. I'll prepare a spiritual medicine prescription for you." He was decisive and immediately sent someone to the storeroom to retrieve various precious medicinal ingredients. Qin Ming overheard that "Dragon Blood" was among the ingredients, and was instantly startled.

Meng Xinghai said, "It wouldn't be good if your vital essence was harmed. Rare and precious grand medicines can help you recover quickly." "Thank you, Uncle Meng!" Qin Ming rose and bowed.

Meng Xinghai nodded, saying, "Heal your injuries in the next two days. The spiritual substances and secret manual I prepared for you will also arrive soon. At that time, you can properly enhance your strength." Having nearly been killed by agents of certain "old acquaintances" in the desert, Qin Ming, after his escape, had constantly thought about diligently practicing unique techniques and undergoing rebirth to strengthen himself. Naturally, his mood was somewhat agitated now.

After consuming a dose of the grand medicine, the effects were remarkably evident. Bloody mist steamed from Qin Ming's body. His already healing wounds began to accelerate their recovery, and some minor injuries even saw their scabs fall off, restoring them to their original state. Meng Xinghai was surprised, saying, "Your life vitality is incredibly strong; it seems you'll fully recover within a day or two." Qin Ming felt his essence, qi, and spirit growing stronger every moment, and he would soon be as vigorous as a dragon and fierce as a tiger!

Meng Xinghai finally mentioned that Fangwai disciples were competing for a legendary item. Qin Ming had heard about it before but hadn't expected to be able to contribute to the matter. "I am willing to go!" he nodded, very pleased at the prospect of Li Qingyue obtaining the item that could bring her closer to immortality.

If Qin Ming had the ability to intervene, he certainly wouldn't let people like Li Qingxu, Zheng Maoze, or Zeng Yuan achieve their desires. Not to mention past grievances, just for being pursued and nearly dying this time, he had to settle this score properly. At the same time, he also felt pressure; those people's cultivation realms were definitely very high.

Meng Xinghai chuckled, "It's fine. When the time comes, you'll be clad in golden armor, and Qingyue will protect you thoroughly." Qin Ming's face stiffened slightly; how could that be acceptable? He was someone who had slain an Outer Saint; how could he fall to the point of being protected by a girl!

"Uncle Meng, I'm heading back first!" He didn't even want to sleep; he wished he could stay up all night practicing cultivation. Only when Qin Ming was about to leave did he notice that the living room seemed a little empty, missing some bronze artifacts. He couldn't help but ask, "Uncle Meng, where did your set of chime bells go?" "I have an old friend who has lived in the deep mountains for a long time and is quite lonely, so I lent him the chime bells to relieve his boredom."

When Qin Ming was at Black and White Mountain, he had heard loud bell sounds and seen purple mist soaring into the sky from the peak. Could it be these very chime bells? "Those Golden Thieves..." he whispered, asking. "All resolved."

...

Qin Ming returned to his residence and immediately began studying the *Classic of Li Fire*. However, it wasn't long before drowsiness overcame him, and he had to fall into slumber. Primarily, he had fought multiple battles that day, rushed around, and suffered severe injuries; even an iron body couldn't endure without rest.

In his dream, he felt as if he was once again wearing the "Golden Thread Jade Robe." His entire body was warm, and vibrant life energy flowed profusely throughout. Golden needles moved as if stitching him back together, and silver light, like medicinal paste, covered his entire body. This healing effect surpassed even the restorative medicine Meng Xinghai had prepared for him.

The next day, Qin Ming opened his eyes. His essence, qi, and spirit were exceptionally vigorous, seemingly more abundant than before. He found that all the scabs on his wounds had fallen off, leaving no scars. Yesterday, in the desert, he had been covered in blood from head to toe, enduring unbearable pain. Now, all his injuries were gone; he had fully recovered.

"The *Classic of Li Fire* truly lives up to its reputation as a wondrous technique; it's indeed very difficult to cultivate," Qin Ming sighed. The secret manual Ning Siqi had sent him was quite profound. This was not a single secret method but encompassed Heavenly Light Energy, movement techniques, defense, and the sublimation of consciousness... It was a complete system, worthy of many rebirth practitioners dedicating their entire lives to studying it.

This was not the original text left by the scripture's founder, but a handwritten copy from one or two decades ago, yet it still retained some residual emotions. After resonating with them spiritually, Qin Ming discovered that most were negative emotions like anger and helplessness from those who had failed in their cultivation. He confirmed one thing: there was nothing wrong with the scripture itself; this was a copy personally transcribed by one of the practitioners, meticulously checked against the original text.

Qin Ming studied it carefully. To cultivate this technique, it was best to choose a place with fire. A so-called wondrous technique was no longer limited to individual moves. This scripture, in the end, could cultivate special abilities, such as giving birth to Li Fire, which could protect the body and burn enemies to ashes.

Qin Ming found a suitable place not far from Scarlet Cloud Mountain. There was a volcano there with fissures leading underground, where magma could be seen. "So hot!" He was very unaccustomed to it upon first arriving. Such areas were extremely damaging to ordinary people's bodies and full of harmful substances. However, to quickly grasp the *Classic of Li Fire*, one needed to endure this environment in the early stages. According to the scripture, underground magma was a decent option. Higher-level choices were naturally thunder-fire, otherworldly heavenly light, and so on, but Qin Ming couldn't find them at the moment.

"Difficult to cultivate!" Qin Ming could typically grasp ordinary energy techniques within half a day, and more complex ones in two or three days. But he had been cultivating Li Fire Energy for five days already. He realized this was a super-composite Heavenly Light Energy, incorporating an unknown number of the most basic individual secret energies. Li Fire Energy offered no transition from simple to difficult; it directly presented the highest principles, fused into a single whole, blocking countless cultivators.

Qin Ming cultivated for five consecutive days, his eyes reddened by the heat, and finally a trace of Li Fire Energy was born, making him exhale a long breath. "Truly a wondrous technique. Even the early stages of Li Fire Energy are profound; my time wasn't wasted." Qin Ming was quite satisfied. Li Fire Energy could kill enemies and also form a layer of Li Fire divine light outside the body, providing excellent defensive effects.

"Hmm? It's thundering again!" He abruptly stood up, rushed to the surface, and ran towards Scarlet Cloud Mountain. These past few days, whenever he heard thunder, he would run up Scarlet Cloud Mountain and wait near the Thunder-Fire Refining Gold Palace. However, each time it would just rumble a few times and then stop, with nothing actually falling.

"Lightning is interweaving in the night sky, very close to the mountain peak!" Qin Ming was excited. The thunder-fire heavenly light that others feared was, in his eyes, a great spiritual medicine. This time, there was still no widespread wondrous phenomenon. Only three bolts of lightning ultimately struck, entwined with heavenly light, cleaving the golden palace under the dark night, causing golden radiance to splash and fireballs to roll, illuminating the area completely.

"It really hurts!" Qin Ming stood alone in the Thunder-Fire Refining Gold Palace, finally understanding why many people only dared to try the first thunder-fire of early spring: because it was relatively mild. "The spiritual substances are not as abundant as in early spring, but the heavenly light is much more violent." This was his personal feeling, but he wasn't disappointed. Enduring the intense pain, he revealed a brilliant smile. Because this was immensely beneficial for his cultivation of the *Classic of Li Fire*.

After the three bolts of thunder-fire heavenly light, he stretched his body there. The *Classic of Li Fire* was now fully mastered, and he no longer needed to endure the harsh environment of the magma region. "What a pity, the spiritual substances aren't enough. It would have been great if dozens of thunder-fire heavenly lights had fallen consecutively." Qin Ming, completely blackened but as vigorous as a dragon and fierce as a tiger, disappeared into the heavy rain.

"That kid disguised himself and entered the Thunder-Fire Refining Gold Palace again? He's truly insane!" Meng Xinghai was greatly startled upon receiving the report. He instructed a confidant, "Go quickly and find him. Tell him the wondrous technique and spiritual substances have arrived, and tell him not to mess around anymore."

Qin Ming's killing of the black-clad masked woman and an Outer Saint in the desert naturally did not go unnoticed. In the Fangwai Land, people were discussing it.

"It's probably an expert from Scarlet Cloud City who appeared and saved Qin Ming. There's no need to pay attention to him for now. Next, all parties will be watching. All Fangwai orthodoxies and blessed lands will send people to contend for that item that can bring us closer to immortality. I'm actually a bit nervous." "That's true. In such a remote place, a mere rebirth practitioner who only broke through by bodily mutation will never enter our sight again if we don't pay attention. We are already people of two different worlds. Let's put aside past grievances for now."
