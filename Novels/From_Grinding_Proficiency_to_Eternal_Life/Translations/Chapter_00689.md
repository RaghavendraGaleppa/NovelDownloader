# Chapter 689: The Ancient Light of Truth, the True Lord of Enlightenment

Below the Breaking Realm Platform, three thousand elite cultivators led by over twenty Foundation Establishment true masters stood on the decks of the Void Crossing Ships, their protective spiritual light torn apart by the violent astral winds.

When Xu Yunfan’s fingertips unleashed a purple-gold thunder dragon, the Foundation Establishment cultivators felt their dantian’s spiritual power congeal like lead and mercury, while the Qi Condensation disciples’ souls trembled violently. The weakest among them collapsed to their knees.

Lu Chuan forcefully raised his head, his pupils reflecting the景象 of the thunder dragon tearing through the sea of realms.

He had once followed the True Lord of Clear Source in battle and knew well that the Chaos Birth and Destruction Mystic Light could obliterate Foundation Establishment cultivators. Yet now, he saw that same mystic light melting away like snow before the thunder dragon’s claws.

The improved array patterns on the surface of the thirty Void Crossing Ships flickered frantically, barely managing to withstand the aftershocks spilling from the edge of the channel.

Inside the ships, the array masters stared at the cracked compasses in their hands, their Adam’s apples bobbing in sheer shock.

“To tame the sea of realms with human power... Is this the might of the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit?”

“Void Crossing Ships, set sail!”

At this moment, Lu Chuan, standing rigidly at the bow of the ship, roared the command.

The thirty massive ships, inscribed with improved spatial array patterns, transformed into dark light. They precisely deflected the chaotic mystic light spilling from the channel's edge, carrying the three thousand elite cultivators as they vanished into the channel in an instant, charging straight toward the fissure in the Atila world barrier.

Xu Yunfan watched all of this calmly and did not make another move.

Any single disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect could fight ten opponents. Those who couldn't fight had long since died on the path of cultivation.

Therefore, he had no worries about whether these people would die after entering Atila.

Just as Xu Yunfan was doing all this...

In the West Continent, within the Pure Land of Bodhi, atop the Eight-Treasure Lotus Platform.

The Glass Pagoda in the Bodhisattva of Great Awakening’s palm stalled slightly, his Buddha eyes reflecting the light of the Crimson Sun fire within the channel.

He lowered his brows and chanted a Buddhist name.

“The Divine Thunder Dao Fruit can actually驾驭 the sea of realms to such an extent. This child’s small cave heaven has just formed, yet his destructive true intent is nearly substantial. The Primordial Origin Sect has added another fierce blade...”

He sighed and looked up at the heavens. The failure in the East Wasteland and the fall of a Bodhisattva had once severely damaged the Pure Land of Bodhi.

“The World Honored One Tathagata is above. When will our Buddha be able to establish a Buddha Kingdom?”

“...”

In the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, amidst the sea of clouds of the Twelve Sword Peaks.

Lu Chunyang’s fingertip paused a white Go stone above the board, his gaze piercing through the void to land on the thunder dragon summoned by Xu Yunfan.

“Using the Sword Intent of Anger Killing as the bone and Divine Thunder as the edge, he has actually integrated the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Art into his Dao techniques.”

His tone was flat, revealing no joy or anger.

But anyone with discerning eyes could see the satisfaction in Lu Chunyang’s tone.

Once all the Primordial Origin Sect disciples had poured into the Breaking Realm Channel, Xu Yunfan took a step off the Breaking Realm Platform and stood within the sea of realms.

“Condense!”

In an instant, a ten-thousand-zhang Thunder Manifestation appeared abruptly.

The manifestation had three heads and six arms, its majesty vast and profound.

The left face was furious with bared fangs, holding a Star Spirit Banner, its surface dark and abysmal, with three hundred and sixty-five major stars flickering within.

The right face was indifferent like ancient, profound ice; its eyes opened and closed as mystic light wound around its fingertips.

The central true face’s eyes opened and closed, with purple-gold thunder light containing worlds of birth and destruction.

Ninety-nine thunder dragons coiled around it like a crown, a manifestation of the purple-gold golden core in his dantian.

Flowing around him was the golden core Dao rhyme of “Thunder in the heavens shatters all laws; the undying purple dome carries the heavens and earth.”

The manifestation stepped on the Breaking Realm Platform, actually refining the entire玄 jade platform into a temporary magical treasure. Carrying an unstoppable force to break realms, it charged violently toward the fissure in the Atila world barrier.

“Crack-boom!!!”

Thick, sticky blood light erupted from the fissure in the world barrier.

The remnant will of the Atila Heavenly Dao sent out a silent tremor, gathering the remaining power of the world’s origin to form a giant, sky-covering palm that slammed fiercely toward Xu Yunfan’s manifestation.

This was the world’s counterattack at the brink of death, containing a desperation willing to self-destruct.

Xu Yunfan’s manifestation sneered, and the furious-faced Star Spirit Banner on his left arm grew massively to block it.

The banner frantically sucked the life force from the incoming strike, withering and turning yellow in an instant.

The authority of Great Light erupted with boundless holy light, burning and purifying the surging dark mist with a sizzling sound.

The origin of the Crimson Sun Dao Fruit jumped violently within the thunder net, releasing pure yang fire capable of incinerating all things, burning the mixed resentful thoughts into green smoke.

It was precisely using the opponent’s way to repay them.

The giant palm was firmly held back by the Star Spirit Banner, the world barrier trembled violently, and the edges of the fissure crumbled.

Just as Xu Yunfan was preparing to enter...

However, the Heavenly Dao will transmitted an intent of mutual destruction.

If a True Lord’s main body forcibly entered the world, the heavens and earth would perish together.

A flash of purple-gold thunder light crossed Xu Yunfan’s manifestation’s eyes, and he had to stop his steps.

He decisively retracted the banner and stepped back. A condensed purple-gold thunder light gathered at the tip of his manifestation’s finger, piercing into the fissure in the world barrier to send a thought to Lu Chuan, who had already entered the Atila world.

“Build the guiding array according to the map! This Lord awaits your good news! This world’s Heavenly Dao is dying and mad; True Lords cannot enter lightly. Act swiftly!”

Just as Xu Yunfan’s manifestation retracted its force and the Breaking Realm Platform hovered at the edge of the Atila sea of realms...

“Rip!”

 a pure, condensed light, as if it could freeze time and space, silently tore through the void beside Xu Yunfan.

Where the sword light passed, the violent chaotic mystic light of the sea of realms was instantly frozen, turning into translucent mystic light crystals.

A manifestation, entire body like cast琉璃 (glass/vitreous), exuding an eternal, indestructible aura, stepped onto the frozen crystal path and took a step out from the void.

It was the Ancient Light of Truth, the True Lord of Enlightenment.

He had enlightened the Dao Fruit of the Morning Light of Heaven.

This Dao Fruit and the Great Light authority suppressed within Xu Yunfan’s Star Spirit Banner, which originated from Atila’s God of Light, belonged to a similar category. However, it was purer and more vast, closer to the origin of light, and contained the characteristics of illuminating all worlds and hanging eternally high.

At the center of the manifestation’s forehead, a rotating Heaven Light Dao Seal was its core. Where its light shone, time and space stagnated, and all laws slowed.

This was the manifestation of the golden core from the North Pole Peak’s ultimate art, the *Sword Canon of Eternal Heaven Light*.

Xu Yunfan’s eyebrows raised slightly upon seeing this, and his originally illusory manifestation instantly solidified.

Two ten-thousand-zhang manifestations confronted each other violently within the raging sea of realms.

The purple-gold thunder destructive force field and the white-glass-like Heaven Light stagnation domain collided violently. Silent annihilation occurred at the point of contact, pushing away the chaotic mystic light of the sea of realms and squeezing out spider-web-like spatial fissures.

The Breaking Realm Platform emitted an unbearable hum under the dual pressure.

“Is the Crimson Sun Dao Fruit still scalding?”

The voice of the True Lord of Heaven Light passed through his manifestation, as cold as the collision of jade, devoid of any emotion, yet containing a piercing chill.

His manifestation’s gaze was firmly locked onto the jumping Crimson Sun Dao Fruit within Xu Yunfan’s body, which was still constantly diffusing its aura.

Xu Yunfan’s manifestation’s right arm, with its icy, indifferent face, showed no fluctuation, but the furious face on his left arm suddenly opened its eyes, its voice like a thunderous roar.

“Want it? Bring the Sword Soul of the Profound Mystery to exchange for it.”

This statement was simply shameless.

The Heaven Light Dao Seal on the forehead of the Heaven Light True Lord’s manifestation suddenly blazed with intense light. The power to stagnate time and space increased sharply, attempting to suppress Xu Yunfan’s manifestation’s thunder light.

“When the great calamity arrives, I will surely剖开 your golden core to offer sacrifice to my sword!”

This was the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect’s bone-deep hatred for Xu Yunfan for killing the Crimson Sun, and also their apprehension for the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit.

Xu Yunfan’s growth speed was simply too fast. In just a few hundred years, using a single lifetime, he had enlightened a Dao Fruit and become a Golden Core True Lord.

He was simply a demon.

Especially after killing the Crimson Sun and severely injuring the Profound Mystery, he did not dare to make a move to test him for the time being.

“The Crimson Sun said the same thing before he died.”

Xu Yunfan’s manifestation sneered. The furious face on his left arm lightly tapped the Star Spirit Banner. The Crimson Sun Dao Fruit inside jumped violently, emitting a muffled roar like a volcanic eruption.

“Here, do you want to hear it more clearly?”
