# Chapter 8: The Annoying Wind

“Get out of the way!”

Leaping towards the carriage, Leopard Head spun around violently and slammed into a Su family guard. He drove the hilt of his saber hard into the man’s stomach. The guard’s eyes bulged, and he crumpled to the ground, retching bile.

Leopard Head planted a foot on the man’s back, his bristling hair standing on end as he roared, “Who else~~~?”

“Me!” came a sharp shout as Nurse Tu stepped out.

Nurse Tu was a withered old woman, her unremarkable appearance further diminished when surrounded by several burly men. Yet, the old matriarch possessed an incredibly imposing aura. Surrounded by her entourage of guards, her full-throated roar immediately intimidated the two warring factions.

“Leopard Head, our Su family and your Yu family are related by marriage. What is the meaning of this shouting and killing?”

Nurse Tu shouted sternly while quickly glancing at the guards lying on the ground.

Fortunately, they were merely bleeding; none had lost their lives. The fight had remained somewhat restrained up to this point. Although both sides had sustained injuries, no one had gone for the kill. However, if Nurse Tu had not appeared in time, things could have escalated once true anger flared.

“Nurse Tu!” Leopard Head甩了甩刀, flicking off a spray of blood droplets.

His voice boomed like thunder. “My young master was murdered by bandits. As the commander of the guards for the main branch of the Yu family, I want to interrogate the bandits to uncover their background so I can avenge my young master. This is perfectly justified! Why is the Su family interfering?”

Nurse Tu’s face turned grim as she rebuked sharply, “That survivor was severely injured. It took me a great deal of effort to save his life. He is still on the verge of death. How do you plan to interrogate him? With torture? If he dies by your hands, how will this matter ever be clarified?”

“The one who died is my young master. Shouldn't this man be handed over to us for interrogation? If you dare to stop us today, I recognize you, but the blade in my hand recognizes no relatives!”

Nurse Tu sneered. “Leopard Head, have you forgotten? The one who died is your young master, but he is also the son-in-law of our Su family.”

Nurse Tu swept her gaze over the menacing Yu family guards. “Our two families are originally in-laws, yet we have come to such a state of shouting and killing. It is fortunate that there is no one around in these wilds; otherwise, if word gets out, wouldn't we become a laughingstock?”

Cheng Dakuan slammed his saber into the ground with a clang, glaring as he said, “Cut the nonsense. Hand the man over quickly! I, Cheng, will bear any consequences!”

Nurse Tu was unyielding. “The murderer must be investigated, but we are currently escorting the young mistress of your Yu family's main branch! The bandits roam the lands, never staying in one place. Even if you learn their background now, are you going to abandon your young mistress and chase after them like headless flies?”

Cheng Dakuan said coldly, “Then what do you suggest, Nurse Tu?”

Nurse Tu replied, “I have already sent men to inform the Su and Yu families. Given the distance, the Yu family should arrive first. Once the person in charge from your Yu family arrives, I will hand over the survivor.”

“Fine! That is what you, Nurse Tu, have said.”

Leopard Head raised his arms. “Everyone heard that. If anything happens to this man before our Yu family people arrive, Nurse Tu, I will hold you accountable! Let’s go!”

With a wave of his large hand, Leopard Head led the Yu family guards as they helped their injured comrades and headed down the slope.

Nurse Tu’s expression slowly darkened. “Go, invite Master Yang here!”

Yang Can didn't need to be invited; he was already “panting” as he rushed over, appearing to have just heard the news and hurried there in a panic.

The moment she saw Yang Can, Nurse Tu’s originally amiable face turned terrifyingly dark.

“Yang Can, what does your Yu family want? Are you trying to provoke a conflict?”

Yang Can hurriedly explained, “Nurse Tu, this has nothing to do with me. Young Master Yu is dead, and now the one most worried about being held accountable is Leopard Head. He is just rushing to atone for his fault.”

Nurse Tu didn't think Yang Can had the ability to command Leopard Head, but a stern warning was still necessary.

“I have no intention of stopping you from finding the murderer; I want to find the true culprit as well. But for me, the most important thing right now is to safely deliver my young lady to Tianshui City. She must become the recognized young mistress of the main branch of the Tianshui clan. Before that, I do not want any complications!”

Yang Can said quickly, “Yes, I... will do my best to persuade Commander Cheng.”

Nurse Tu remained displeased. “Yang Can, don't forget that your wealth, prospects, and very life are all tied to my young lady. You and she must work harder. It is proper to have her conceive a child as soon as possible. Everything else must be set aside for now!”

“I understand.”

“You had better understand,” Nurse Tu said, shooting Yang Can a look full of hidden authority before storming off. Yang Can watched her withered back, his gaze sharp as needles.

After Leopard Head’s probing, Yang Can was now certain that Nurse Tu was not only the architect of the insemination plan but also the sole person in charge of this Su family contingent. Therefore, he could begin to contemplate when and by what means to send Nurse Tu to the afterlife. After all, that old woman had already fulfilled her purpose.

On the ancient Tianlong Road in early spring, a procession stretching for miles was slowly heading west.

At the front of the procession were thirty-six cavalrymen clad in black military uniforms, their saddles adorned with copper bells that chimed with every step of their steeds. Behind them were eighteen burly warriors holding long halberds, the foot-long sharp tips glinting with a cold light in the sun. Further back, eighteen maids sat atop tall camels, their slender waists swaying gracefully with the camels' gait.

In the center of the procession was a four-horse carriage painted vermilion with gold trim and a crude, uncomfortable-looking coffin. The coffin held the groom, while the carriage held the bride. The tassels hanging from the roof swayed gently with the carriage's bumps. A thin veil on the window was lifted by the wind, revealing a faint glimpse of a beautiful figure.

Suo Chanzhi had just woken up. She sat up lazily, supporting her sore waist, and casually parted the veil. Outside the window were the rolling yellow earth slopes. Having grown up in Jincheng and rarely left the city, this was the first time she had seen such scenery.

She was still wearing a golden floral crown and a red brocade wedding gown, with a jade belt holding the tassels at her waist. This was because she was a bride; even though the groom was dead, she was a bride on the road to her wedding, and that fact would not change.

However, a white silk ribbon was tied around her waist. She wore wedding clothes because she was getting married, but she wore a mourning sash because the groom was already dead.

Getting closer and closer to Tianshui, according to Nurse Tu's plan, it was almost time to... silence him?

Thinking of this, Suo Chanzhi gently bit her lip.

That damned man... certainly deserved to die, but I haven't even taught him the rules yet. Does he really have to... die now?

The spring wind was not as harsh as that of autumn or winter, but it seemed to carry a unique, irritating quality. Suo Chanzhi lowered the window curtain to block the wind, but her heart remained inexplicably agitated.
