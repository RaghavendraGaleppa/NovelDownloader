# Chapter 49: Alchemy

"Junior Daoist Xiao Ruowang pays respects to Provincial Scholar Zhou and Elder Fushong."

The Taihe Sect had sent three Daoist priests, led by Xiao Ruowang, a handsome man in his late twenties with refined manners. He performed the greeting ritual before Fushong and Zhou Qing.

When Fushong tried to help him up, he found himself unable to lift Xiao—until the younger man gracefully rose with added pressure. Fushong took a step back. "You practice the Taihe Sect's Single Qi Sunrise Scripture?"

Xiao Ruowang smiled and bowed. "Elder Fushong has keen eyes. Had you used the Taihe True Form Scripture, this junior would have been thoroughly embarrassed."

This gentle probing of martial skills was typical among Daoist sects. More aggressive martial artists might test strength through bone-crushing handshakes, while some schools even required visitors to drink scalding "kung fu tea" as a rite of passage.

Fushong shook his head. "Even at my peak twenty years ago, I might not have matched you. Now..." He trailed off, though inwardly he thought, Once I complete my Eight Trigrams Dragon Subduing Palm, it will leave its mark on martial history. Even without reaching the Innate Realm, its perfect synergy with my skills will surpass anything from your Single Qi Sunrise Scripture.

Xiao Ruowang remained silent until Fushong finished his musings, then addressed Zhou Qing: "Provincial Scholar Zhou, we sincerely hope for your success in refining the Heart-Nourishing Pills. Our entire sect would be deeply grateful."

Zhou Qing replied, "With so many experts in your sect having failed, I can only promise to try my best. Now, may I see the formula?"

After receiving the formula, Zhou Qing understood why the Taihe Sect was willing to outsource the alchemy. Several key ingredients were unique to Mount Taihe, and the catalyst required was the vital essence—extracted through fingertips, not directly from the heart—of someone who had mastered the Single Qi Sunrise Scripture. This process significantly drained one's vitality.

Zhou Qing realized the Blood Qi Pills containing five-leaf ginseng could replenish this loss—likely why the Taihe Sect had initially purchased them. Recognizing Zhou Qing's alchemical skill from these pills, they had sought his help.

Zhou Qing didn't understand why his alchemy was rated as "Elementary (Basic)" by the Health Preservation System—the lowest possible rank—yet was considered impressive by the Taihe Sect. Perhaps the system graded by immortal cultivation standards? But he hadn't even encountered that world yet.

While Zhou Qing studied the formula in the alchemy chamber, Fushong had Zhishan host Xiao Ruowang's group. The three junior disciples—Zhishui, Zhijing, and Zhishan—now assisted Butcher Hu with his affairs, though Zhishan mostly stayed at the mountain unless needed below.

Butcher Hu had established the Black Tiger Gang, directly challenging the Fierce Tiger Gang—a clear statement that "two tigers cannot share one mountain." Zhou Qing had given him some Blood Qi Powder to practice Fushong's martial arts. While too old to become a true martial artist, basic self-defense was better than nothing. 

But gang leadership required social skills more than combat prowess—violence was only for when diplomacy failed.

As Zhou Qing meditated on the formula, he noticed similarities to an ancient recipe from his previous life—Six Spirit Pills, better known as Quick-Acting Heart Relief Pills. The Heart-Nourishing Pills followed similar principles but were enhanced by this world's martial and alchemical arts, specifically targeting heart ailments. Clearly, the Taihe Sect needed them to treat someone important.

This explained why they had quickly accepted Miss Lin's terms—desperate enough to grasp at any hope. Unbeknownst to Zhou Qing, they had even consulted a renowned alchemist in the capital, who declared that no contemporary Daoist could refine the pills, as the process required both strong spiritual power and sustained vitality—a rare combination in aged alchemists.

After seven exhausting days, Zhou Qing emerged from the alchemy chamber, pale with dark circles under his eyes. He had underestimated the toll of refining the pills. Had he been greedier, he might not have survived the process—fresh vital essence couldn't be harvested excessively from Xiao Ruowang.

The true reward wasn't the five Heart-Nourishing Pills (of which he kept three), but his alchemy skill advancing to "Elementary (Proficient)." Though a small step, it enhanced his ability to discern medicinal properties—even for unfamiliar herbs. He suspected this would prove invaluable for future herb-gathering expeditions, which would become necessary as his cultivation progressed.

At sixteen, with replenished vitality, Zhou Qing felt less urgency, though Elder Fushan's notes about the golden period before thirty for martial cultivation kept him motivated. Still, he allowed himself occasional breaks—cultivation shouldn't be all tension. He planned to attempt soul projection again once mastering all Five Animal Exercises, a power beyond conventional martial arts.

When presenting the pills, Xiao Ruowang was moved by Zhou Qing's apparent remorse over the small yield. "Five are sufficient—three would normally suffice. Here is the remaining six-leaf ginseng, a rarity even in the imperial palace." Zhou Qing accepted the precious herb, while Xiao departed eagerly with the pills.

Fushong was equally pleased—Xiao had been excellent practice for developing his Eight Trigrams Dragon Subduing Palm. He privately wished his junior brother were stronger to spar with, but as a provincial scholar, Zhou Qing was beyond such duties.

Later, Zhou Qing asked Fushong about the pills' recipient. "Given the Taihe Sect's influence in Xijiang Province, it must be for either their leader's kin or someone from the Qinghe Prince's household," Fushong speculated. "Their leader is elderly and devout—likely no close family. So probably the prince's affair."

The Qinghe Prince, descended from the founding emperor, had tense relations with the current imperial line, making royal assistance unlikely. With princely factions involved, Zhou Qing lost interest—as a scholar, such entanglements were best avoided. For now, he focused on absorbing the six-leaf ginseng to advance his Five Animal Exercises.

Before parting, Zhou Qing gave Xiao Ruowang five Blood Qi Pills (via Fushong) to compensate for the extra vital essence drawn. Grateful, Xiao consumed one immediately, finding his Single Qi Sunrise Scripture refined further—a rare breakthrough at his level. The subsequent sparring with Fushong helped consolidate these gains.

Xiao's companions, meanwhile, enjoyed a rare mountain excursion with Zhishan, even finding a lingzhi mushroom. They avoided the deeper, perilous regions where even experienced hunters ventured at their own risk—a realm of hidden dangers and forgotten hermitages that even Qingfu Temple at its peak had barely explored.

As Zhou Qing relaxed with Fushong, discussing the mysterious patient, he felt content despite his fatigue. The three retained pills would greatly aid his Ape Exercise training. Though weary, his mind remained active, curious about the world beyond—where martial arts might transcend physical limits, and where his alchemy could take him next.
