**Chapter 71: How Much Did You Harvest This Time?**

"Do you think the Meridian-Opening Flower is like spirit rice, where you just follow the steps after it sprouts? Do you know there are many precautions for planting Meridian-Opening Flowers?" Dongfeng asked.

Ding Rui was about to nod when Dongfeng immediately shook his head and muttered to himself, "You definitely don't know."

"No, I..." Ding Rui intended to interject.

"How could you possibly know? You're just a spirit farmer who happened to plant some Meridian-Opening Flowers; how could you know these things?" Dongfeng shook his head with a long sigh, interrupting him. "But it's perfectly normal that you don't know, so it's also perfectly normal that you think you can plant Meridian-Opening Flowers by yourself."

Spirit field cultivators spent their entire days in the spirit fields. Besides farming and cultivating, they had no time for anything else, not even to meet their Dao companions. They knew little about anything other than spirit rice. Dongfeng had gone through the same experience; he knew these things!

"I know, Senior Brother, I know!" Ding Rui said.

"You know?" Dongfeng looked at Ding Rui, somewhat disbelieving. "Then tell me, what do you know?"

"Why?!" Ding Rui asked, puzzled.

Dongfeng looked troubled. "I can't make decisions on such matters. I have to report to the Inner Sect Senior Brother in charge. I wouldn't dare make such an unreliable request to an Inner Sect Senior Brother! Furthermore, you do know quite a bit, but those precautions are truly not something you can easily manage."

Dongfeng said seriously, "Since the sect has made these arrangements, there's a reason behind it. I know that as a spirit farmer, you have a certain degree of pride, but you truly cannot joke around about this. Don't bring this up again. The spirit farmer who will be cooperating with you should be arriving soon. It'll be a good chance to meet and get acquainted. We'll officially start planting Meridian-Opening Flowers tomorrow."

Dongfeng looked at Ding Rui earnestly. "Since you also know the importance of Meridian-Opening Flowers to the sect, then follow the sect's instructions. Don't be wilful anymore!"

Although Dongfeng still harbored a desire to compete and show off at this moment, his words were truly sincere. Almost no cultivator within the sect's domain didn't want the sect's domain to prosper. To them, the sect's domain was a beautiful Peach Blossom Spring, something they absolutely could not lose!

"If Senior Brother doesn't believe me, then after I prove I can manage the spirit field alone, you can go to other spirit fields and fully utilize the manpower there to plant even more Meridian-Opening Flowers! How does that sound?"

Upon hearing this, Shuimen couldn't help but give Ding Rui a strange look. In his opinion, Ding Rui's words were a bit arrogant.
