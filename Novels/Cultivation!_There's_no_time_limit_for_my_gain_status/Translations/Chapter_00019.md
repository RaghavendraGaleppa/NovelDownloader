# Chapter 19: Selecting Another Technique  

"Not bad, not bad at all. I didn't expect you to be such a perceptive and bold disciple," the Transmission Elder remarked.  

Upon reflection, the method Jiang Li had used indeed stemmed from his teachings. With just a few words, he had enabled a disciple with average spiritual roots to surpass several with superior roots. Which other Transmission Elder could boast such teaching prowess? The more he thought about it, the more pleased he became, and his gaze toward Jiang Li grew even more approving.  

"Come, release your spiritual energy for me to see."  

Jiang Li complied, extending his hand and drawing a wisp of spiritual energy from his dantian. A faint blue mist swirled in his palm before dissipating due to his lack of control. The surrounding temperature plummeted instantly, causing Yan Hong, sitting beside him, to shiver involuntarily.  

Seeing this, the Transmission Elder was even more convinced—such refined spiritual energy couldn't be cultivated through mere Qi-Nourishing Pills.  

"Mm, very pure spiritual energy. Your techniques will naturally be more potent than others'. That troublesome graveyard seems to have been quite a boon for you."  

"Your approach was correct and didn’t disappoint my teachings. However, it was still too risky. If you weren’t an internal martial artist, you’d likely be dead by now."  

The elder offered a token reprimand, and Jiang Li adopted a humble posture, further pleasing the elder.  

"All of you, take note. Merely listening to my lectures isn’t enough—you must learn to apply the knowledge flexibly. Jiang Li is the perfect example. In the future, you must think more critically about your cultivation."  

After using Jiang Li as an example to lecture the other disciples, the elder turned his gentle gaze back to Jiang Li and Yu Banxia.  

"Yu Banxia and Jiang Li, since you’ve both reached the Qi Refinement stage, you no longer need to attend these classes. From now on, proceed directly to the Transmission Hall next door."  

"All outer sect disciples who’ve reached Qi Refinement study there. The knowledge imparted there is more advanced and will be of greater help to you. You may even learn some basic techniques for free."  

The "Great Hall" they were currently in catered to disciples who hadn’t yet mastered Qi Refinement—mostly new recruits from this year, with a few from last year who still hadn’t succeeded in drawing in spiritual energy.  

The "Transmission Hall" next door, however, was for Qi Refinement disciples, where they would truly begin learning how to wield spiritual energy and non-combative spells for daily tasks. After all, the gap between those with spiritual energy and those without was vast—like trying to explain ice to a summer insect. How could they possibly attend the same classes?  

---  

In the Great Hall, the Transmission Elders' goal was to help disciples achieve Qi Refinement as quickly as possible.  

In the Transmission Hall, however, the elders aimed for disciples to swiftly master practical skills—cultivating spiritual herbs, reclaiming spirit fields, or mining spirit ores. Only then could they contribute to the sect’s development.  

Jiang Li had anticipated the transition between halls. Still, he’d heard that the top-performing new disciples each year received rewards—and sure enough, the Transmission Elder continued.  

"Every year, the first ten new disciples to reach Qi Refinement are rewarded. Naturally, you two are no exception."  

"Take these talismans. After class, you may use them to select any technique from the first floor of the Scripture Pavilion."  

With a flick of his hand, the elder sent two yellow slips of paper floating onto the table before them.  

"Thank you, Elder!"  

Amidst the envious gazes of their peers, the two bowed and stored the talismans away.  

Hundreds of disciples watched with burning eyes, silently vowing to redouble their efforts. But what use was tenfold effort when their spiritual roots were lacking? These rewards were always meant for those with superior talent and resources.  

After class, their circle of acquaintances swarmed around them, showering them with flattery.  

"Banxia, Jiang Li, you kept us in the dark! When did you two break through without a word?" Lu Qianqian teased, her petite frame making her playful scolding harmless.  

"Don’t get too cocky. I can feel it—I’ll break through in a few days. When I do, I won’t lose to you," Qu Qianfan declared.  

"Brother Yu, Brother Jiang, do you have any tips for us?"  

...  

It took them a while to fend off the well-wishers before they could finally head toward the inner sect together.  

"After selecting your techniques, leave the inner sect immediately. No wandering, no lingering."  

Without an elder to escort them this time, they were stopped at the inner sect gate. Only after presenting the elder’s talismans were they permitted to pass.  

"Tch, acting all high and mighty. I, Yu Banxia, will become an inner sect disciple one day. What’s there to be smug about?" Yu Banxia grumbled about the gatekeepers’ attitude.  

"By the way, Jiang Li, you really shocked everyone this time. What technique are you planning to choose?"  

Jiang Li noticed a subtle shift in Yu Banxia’s demeanor toward him. Previously, as a disciple with average spiritual roots, Jiang Li had been on the fringes of their circle.  

But now, things were different. Jiang Li could cultivate in the outer sect graveyard—a resource that wouldn’t vanish after one use. This meant his cultivation speed would remain high, naturally elevating his status in their eyes.  

"You’re exaggerating. I just got lucky this time. As the elder said, if I weren’t an internal martial artist with strong vitality, I’d have died before even drawing in spiritual energy."  

Jiang Li brushed off the praise modestly.  

"As for techniques, I’m not sure yet. Probably a wood-attribute spell."  

As they chatted, they soon arrived at the Scripture Pavilion. After handing over their talismans, the massive metal doors swung open once more.  

The technique section, like the cultivation method section, was categorized by attribute. Jiang Li naturally sought out the Yin-Wood dual-attribute techniques.  

As expected, Yin-Wood techniques were just as scarce as the cultivation methods. The few available were part of the "Coffin Burial Art" set, contributed by that rogue cultivator family specializing in corpse manipulation.  

Judging by the attributes, these techniques should be compatible with him. But true to their origins, every spell was corpse-related, leaving Jiang Li exasperated.  

Hanging around zombies seemed like a surefire way to court misfortune—just like the unlucky Taoists in past-life movies or that struggling corpse-handling family. Jiang Li was deeply averse to anything that might harm his luck.  

But damn practicality.  

In the end, Jiang Li still selected the most expensive technique from the pile.
