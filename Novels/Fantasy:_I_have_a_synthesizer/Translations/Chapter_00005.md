**Chapter 5: Vice President of the Martial Artist Association, The Assessment Begins!**

Su Yu left, but the group of students gathered at the school gate instantly erupted.

"A martial artist! Our school actually produced a martial artist!" someone exclaimed in shock.

"Hmph, not necessarily a martial artist. If he were, the school would have announced it long ago."

"But didn't Li Hu just say that guy was a martial artist?"

"Li Hu? Li Hu's qi and blood level is probably around a certain point. To defeat Li Hu, one's qi and blood level is likely above that, but that still doesn't prove the opponent is a martial artist!"

"Moreover, if he were a martial artist, Li Hu would have been arrested by the Martial Artist Association by now. Would they still wait until now?" someone said dismissively.

In this world, martial artists are not to be insulted. Once discovered, if someone insults a martial artist, the Martial Artist Association will step in and apprehend the perpetrator. This was why those people just now said Su Yu wasn't a martial artist.

Only Li Hu, standing rooted to the spot, cradling his injured arm, knew the truth. Su Yu's punch just now definitely didn't use full power. Yet, even so, it had caused his fist to explode. Someone who wasn't a martial artist simply couldn't do that.

"It's over, I offended a martial artist!" Li Hu gazed in terror at the direction Su Yu had left.

"No, the direction he's heading is towards the Martial Artist Association. He hasn't officially passed the martial artist assessment yet, there's still a chance!"

However, when Su Yu saw the old man, he was completely stunned.

"Principal, why are you here?"

The old man before him was none other than Wu Ming, the principal of Hengcheng First High School! He was also a martial artist of unfathomable depth!

Wu Ming smiled as he looked at Su Yu. "I watched your fight with Li Hu. Although you've become a martial artist, you're still too green. You must have only recently entered the martial artist realm!"

Su Yu nodded in silence. As expected of an experienced martial artist, his insight was incredibly sharp.

Wu Ming chuckled. "I only came to see the genius of our Hengcheng First High School. You must be heading to the Martial Artist Association to take the assessment, right?"

"That's right." Su Yu didn't know why, but he felt as if everything about him was seen through in front of Wu Ming.

Wu Ming waved his hand, saying, "In that case, let's go together. I also want to see what level the first martial artist genius to emerge from my Hengcheng First High School can reach!"

Su Yu scratched his head, feeling a little embarrassed. But since Wu Ming had already spoken, Su Yu could only agree.

Soon, the two arrived at the Martial Artist Association, which was located in the very center of Hengcheng City.

Indeed, it was Liu Kuang!

Liu Kuang sized Su Yu up, then after a moment of silence, said, "At such a young age, to have entered the martial artist realm... it seems you intend to send him to that place!"

Wu Ming smiled but said nothing. Su Yu, standing to the side, felt somewhat bewildered. The cryptic exchange between the two made it difficult for him to understand.

Liu Kuang sighed, "Very well. It's been a long time since anyone from our Hengcheng has gone to that place. If this boy can succeed, he might just be the hope of our Hengcheng."

"Boy, come with me!"

With that, he led Su Yu deeper into the Martial Artist Association. Su Yu followed behind the two in a daze, walking past long corridors before entering a vast training ground. In the training ground, three colossal machines stood silently. Their dark bodies seemed capable of devouring one's very spirit, making Su Yu involuntarily pause in shock.

However, he quickly snapped out of it.

At this moment, Liu Kuang's voice rang out.
