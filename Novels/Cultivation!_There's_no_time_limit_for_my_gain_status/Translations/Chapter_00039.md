# Chapter 39: The Twin Evils of Jing River  

As the monk Zhengyuan had said, the lands of Yinnan Kingdom were restless these days.  

"Moreover, with so many unconscious children lying in the royal palace today, it must have already drawn the attention of certain individuals. It's possible we're being watched right now. From now on, we must be extremely cautious in everything we do!"  

Jiang Li's warning sent a chill down everyone's spines.  

Over two thousand unconscious children lying in the Yinnan royal palace wasn't just unusual—it was downright bizarre. It wouldn't be surprising if someone connected this to the emergence of demonic creatures. Even if that wasn't the case, a sharp-eyed observer might notice that all these children possessed spiritual roots.  

If word got out, the worst-case scenario wouldn't just be rogue cultivators kidnapping these potential disciples to sell to the Ascension Pavilion. They might also decide to "redistribute wealth" by targeting Jiang Li and his companions.  

"So, what should we do?"  

No one had a clear answer.  

Among the new outer disciples of the Hidden Scripture Valley, they were considered strong—but only by comparison. In truth, they were still just seven early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators and one mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, barely proficient in a few spells. They were complete novices.  

Bullying mortals was one thing, but facing other cultivators would put them at a severe disadvantage.  

"Is Yinnan Kingdom closer to the Compassionate Ferry Temple or the Hidden Scripture Valley?"  

While everyone was at a loss, Jiang Li suddenly posed the question.  

"Of course, it's the Hidden Scripture Valley. Otherwise, this mission wouldn't have been assigned to us in the outer sect," Yu Banxia answered, then immediately realized something.  

"You mean..."  

"Exactly. Though we don't know the full details, this demonic emergence has clearly attracted many cultivators. If even disciples from the Compassionate Ferry Temple are here, it stands to reason that our Hidden Scripture Valley would also send people."  

Jiang Li paused before continuing, "Back at the sect, we heard nothing about this demonic emergence. There are two possibilities: First, the news only spread after we set out. Second, the information was only circulated among the inner sect, and outer disciples had no way of knowing."  

"I lean toward the second possibility. Otherwise, five days wouldn't have been enough for so many cultivators to gather."  

His words lit up the faces of the group.  

"So, you're saying inner sect disciples—or even sect elders—might already be here, possibly even in the city?"  

Lu Qianqian, who had just taken a Qi-restoring pill, looked much more alert now. If a sect elder were present, they could certainly ensure their safety. No ordinary rogue cultivator would dare cause trouble.  

"Not only would it solve our safety concerns, but inner disciples and elders would also have communication spirit stones to contact the sect. If we find them and ask for help, our mission could be completed immediately."  

What they didn't say aloud was that most of the rewards might be taken by those elders. But right now, this was their best option.  

---  

Late at night, four shadowy figures flitted through the Yinnan royal palace.  

Slipping out from a side hall, they moved like ghosts, effortlessly avoiding patrols of guards. With a few nimble leaps, they scaled the palace walls and landed on the streets outside.  

"Stay alert. Prioritize your own safety. Regroup here in two hours!"  

Yu Banxia's voice came from beneath a dark hooded cloak. The four figures then split off in different directions, quickly vanishing into the night.  

These were Jiang Li, Yu Banxia, Qu Qianfan, and Wang Liuliang. After discussion, they had decided that the four strongest among them would scout at night, gathering information and searching for Hidden Scripture Valley elders or inner disciples in the area.  

"Who would've thought that aside from Yu Banxia, the strongest among them would be that scholarly-looking Wang Liuliang?"  

Wang Liuliang was not only nearing mid-stage Qi Refinement but also possessed exceptional martial skills—a valuable asset in the early stages of cultivation when resources were scarce.  

Compared to his agility, Jiang Li's speed was raw and unrefined. As he ran, he made a mental note to acquire a proper movement technique later.  

*Whoosh! Whoosh!*  

Just as Jiang Li passed a street corner, two pitch-black nails—reflecting no moonlight—shot toward him in near silence.  

The running Jiang Li didn't even notice before the nails pierced through both his collarbones with vicious precision. The impact sent him crashing onto the stone-paved road, where he lay motionless.  

"Hah! So much for these so-called elite sect disciples. They're no match for us!"  

"Big brother, sect disciples are always loaded. Let's see what this guy's carrying."  

As Jiang Li fell, two figures emerged from the shadows. They were brothers, identical in appearance and infamous rogue cultivators known as the Twin Evils of Jing River.  

"Wait."  

The elder brother stopped his reckless sibling, then pulled out a few more black nails and hurled them at Jiang Li's prone form, piercing his limbs at the joints. Only then did he relax.  

"Heh, always the cautious one, big brother."  

"Hey, kid! Quit playing dead! You're unlucky enough to run into the Twin Evils of Jing River! Hand over everything you've got—then recite every cultivation method and spell you know! Maybe we'll spare your life!"  

The younger brother grabbed the "severely injured" Jiang Li and flipped him over, revealing the face beneath the hood—a terrifying visage of green skin, fangs, and long black fur!  

"Ah! A zombie!"  

Before the rogue cultivator could react, the fierce black zombie sprang up. Ten inky claws plunged into his chest, yanking him close as the creature's fangs lunged for his throat.  

A single bite would drain his lifeblood in seconds—no power in the world could save him then.  

"Damn it! Let go of my brother!"  

The elder brother whipped out two yellow talismans and charged forward—only to freeze mid-step.  

"Friend, where do you think you're going?"  

A voice laced with amusement sounded behind him. A steely hand clamped onto his shoulder, forcing him to his knees with such force that the stone beneath him cracked.  

It was Jiang Li—who had long since purged his pill toxins, restored his strength, and been quietly following the zombie from the shadows—now making his move.
