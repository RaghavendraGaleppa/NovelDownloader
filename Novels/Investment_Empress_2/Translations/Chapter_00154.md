Chapter 154: Is the Ice Cube Going to the Hot Springs?

Sunlight streamed through the window, casting its rays upon the young man lying in his reclining chair.

He slowly opened his eyes. Every speck of dust dancing in the light was crystal clear, as if he could see through their surface to understand their very essence.

The sun had risen once again.

Li Mo walked down from the attic, squinting slightly as he faced the sun.

He felt his spirit was full, as if he had complete mastery over every inch of his body.

In his Dantian, two Xuan Duan revolved like the sun and moon, breathing in and out his internal energy.

Perhaps, it could no longer be called internal energy.

Li Mo walked to the dining table and asked, "Master, how long was I asleep?"

Shang Wu, who was sitting cross-legged reading the *Nine Heavens Ten Lands Power Ranking*, widened her almond-shaped eyes. "My precious disciple, you're finally awake! You've been asleep for a whole month!"

Li Mo: "!"

He felt as if he had been swept into the river of time, completely unaware of its passage. Had so much time really passed in the outside world?!

Ying Bing glanced at Shang Wu and said softly, "It was only one afternoon."

Shang Wu smiled mischievously, narrowing her eyes. "Silly disciple, if I say it, you believe it?"

"..." Li Mo sighed. "I'm going to cook."

He realized he had overestimated his master's sense of seriousness.

After his awakening, besides the enhancement of his physical strength, he felt the world before him had also changed. He hadn't had the chance to fully explore his new sensations yet.

However, it was almost dinner time. Time to make his investments first.

He went to the kitchen, selecting high-quality ingredients and chopping them for preparation.

Just as he was about to heat the oil in the wok, the corner of Li Mo's eye twitched.

In his vision, a fly was flapping its wings, seemingly about to land on the food.

*Snap—*

A toothpick shot through the fly's wings, pinning it firmly to the wall.

"Strange," Li Mo muttered while stir-frying.

Just now, the possible movement trajectories of the fly had all surfaced in his mind. Was this a benefit of his awakening?

A realization dawned on Li Mo. As he cooked, every drop of seasoning, every splashing oil bead, and the precise heat on every slice of meat was incredibly clear to him.

"What are you making today? It smells so good."

"Oh, it's stir-fried meat with chili."

"You didn't add anything weird to it, did you?"

"Mmm, it's delicious."

Little Li's culinary skills had improved, earning unanimous praise from Ying Bing and Shang Wu.

He himself hurriedly took a couple of bites, then picked up the Chixiao Sword and began practicing his swordsmanship as if no one else were there.

Every sword technique he had practiced in the past surfaced in his mind, flowing seamlessly.

Gradually, he moved from intermediate sword techniques to advanced ones, and finally to the supreme technique, the *Sun Wheel Sword Canon*.

Suddenly, Frostfall came thrusting at him from an angle.

It was Ying Bing.

Her gaze was as clear and calm as ever, but Little Li could read the meaning within it: "Practice."

Under Ying Bing's guidance, a sudden itch appeared between his eyebrows. The countless insights he had gained into the martial path, along with the memories of practicing swordsmanship with Princess Jiang and the Ice Cube, all flooded his mind.

The *Sun Wheel Sword Canon* advanced a step further, faintly approaching the state of perfection.

Li Mo let out a soft breath, a smile curling at the corners of his mouth.

Look at this. Ignoring the martial insights he had spent, he, Li Mo, at sixteen, had mastered a supreme sword technique (almost).

Who agrees, and who objects, to him calling himself a sword prodigy?

"You awakened?"

Ying Bing retracted her sword, her eyes shimmering slightly.

She had only suspected it before, but after exchanging blows with Li Mo, she was now certain.

"Ah, it was because of the celestial phenomenon this afternoon," Li Mo coughed lightly. "The sun and moon swapped places, my mind shook violently, and then I passed out."

"When I woke up, I found I had awakened."

He couldn't very well say he had fainted from looking at the Ice Cube's picture, now could he? As everyone knows, Little Li is an honest gentleman—unless the truth is even more unbelievable.

"..." Ying Bing's gaze wavered.

It wasn't unprecedented to awaken by watching a celestial phenomenon instead of a Divine Manifestation Diagram. However... a solar eclipse, the heavens changing and the moon swapping—such events happened in her past life, and she would surely have remembered them.

"Not bad, my precious disciple, you have the air of your master," Shang Wu gave a thumbs-up.

She had awakened back then after drinking too much and sleeping it off.

"You flatter me, Master..." Li Mo started to say, but Shang Wu continued, "It's quite a coincidence that you awakened now. You've run right into some trouble."

"Huh?"

"For some reason, Yin Huaxuan managed to escape using a Golden Cicada Shedding Shell trick. The sect is on lockdown now; he must still be hiding inside."

Shang Wu grumbled unhappily. She had almost beaten Yin Huaxuan to death back then, but it was all because of Qian Bufan that she had to leave him alive for interrogation.

"Yin Huaxuan escaped?"

Li Mo frowned.

Anyone could guess that the former elder of the Rare Beast Peak would love to tear him to pieces.

"That's right. The Sect Master has ordered that all disciples who have reached the Divine Manifestation Realm or above must form pairs to search for him. Since you've awakened, you count as a Divine Manifestation Realm cultivator now," Shang Wu said, spreading her hands.

Li Mo: "..."

What perfect timing.

And so, Little Li went to the Outer Affairs Hall to report for duty.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes, watching the young man's figure step out the door from the corner of her eye.

She hadn't expected Li Mo to awaken before her.

And moreover, it happened to be the day before the system ranking.

Ying Bing wasn't worried about the ranking. She could awaken tonight as well, so they would still be in the same realm.

What truly puzzled her was today's celestial phenomenon.

Why? Why did the sun suddenly dim and the moon hang high in the sky?

Even with her rebirth, she couldn't have caused such a huge deviation in this world, could she?

"The future of the Nine Heavens Ten Lands may become even more treacherous. There will be more things beyond my expectations from now on..." Ying Bing let out a soft breath and stood up.

Only by being strong enough herself could she handle those changes.

"Little Bing'er, where are you going?"

"To train."

"Then, would you like to try the Misty Flower Spring? The effects are amazing," Shang Wu coaxed.

She felt it was too boring to soak in the hot springs alone, and her precious disciple had to go on a mission.

Ying Bing's footsteps paused.

After a moment of silence, she turned her head. "How... amazing is it?"

"First, it speeds up the absorption of spiritual energy significantly. Then... it also has a soothing effect on the Intent Soul," Shang Wu spilled all the benefits like bamboo tubes dumping beans.

...

On the other side, as Li Mo was on his way to the Outer Affairs Hall, a notification sounded in his ear, nearly making him stumble.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Ying Bing', causing her to soak in the Misty Flower Immortal Spring to increase her power.】

【Investment Feedback: Step Cloud Boots】

【Seven-Star Step Cloud Boots】: "Mid-grade Xuan Artifact level treasure boots, once worn by a world-famous Saint of Thievery. While wearing them, one can walk without leaving a trace on snow and feel as light as a feather. When fueled by Divine Manifestation Realm true energy, one can soar through the air!"

Li Mo: "!"

Shocked.

Rewards aside for a moment... Is the Ice Cube going to the hot springs?!
