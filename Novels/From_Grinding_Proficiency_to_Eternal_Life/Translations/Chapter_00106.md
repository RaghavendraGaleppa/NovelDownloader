# Chapter 106: Approaching

The entire Mechanism City was naturally in an uproar. Although Xu Yunfan did not know what was being discussed, the atmosphere within the city had become noticeably tense. Even the thousand-strong Chuifeng Army, personally commanded by the Sect Master, was patrolling the city.

That day, Xu Yunfan had just finished eating, enjoying the Red Lion Trout fished from Cuibo Lake. From the moment it was caught to the moment it was served on his table, it had been less than two hours, preserving the creature's spiritual essence to the maximum.

After eating and drinking his fill, he soaked in the steaming heat of the medicinal bath. On his vision, the proficiency bar was climbing at a screen-refreshing speed. His Flying Leg Technique was only one step away from perfection.

In less than a month, twenty-seven days to be exact, Xu Yunfan had practiced day and night without rest, accumulating over a thousand proficiency points. With sufficient resources backing him, he was confident that within at most three days, his Muscle Refining would be perfected.

Once Muscle Refining was perfected, manifesting the appearance of golden skin and jade-like meridians, his strength would naturally take a further step forward.

At the edge of the northern peak of Guniu Mountain, a three-finger-wide iron chain bridge was embedded. The bronze wind lanterns of the Cangfeng Pavilion's watchtower swayed in the twilight.

From this location, one could overlook the entirety of Mechanism City. From this cliff face, one could clearly see Xu Yunfan's courtyard within the city, three miles away.

"Is that Xu Yunfan?"

The speaker was a tall young man dressed in white. He looked no older than twenty-five, with a hint of gloom knitting his brows. His movements clearly revealed distinct muscle lines—thick but not bulky.

"It's him. I haven't seen him leave his house these past few days. He hasn't even visited the Langyue Pavilion within Mechanism City. He practices martial arts every day, rising earlier than a rooster and sleeping later than a dog. I calculated it; he sleeps for no more than two hours a day," Yue Shan said in a muffled voice from the side, a look of admiration in his eyes.

Setting aside whether they were rivals or not, within the nine peaks and six divisions of the Tiangong Cave, due to the entanglement of various interests, friction and disputes were inevitable. But the intensity of this guy's training was simply beyond imagination, making his scalp tingle.

One or two days would be fine, but to keep this up for a month straight? Even an iron man would find it hard to bear, yet Xu Yunfan had persisted.

He turned his head to look at the young man.

"Senior Brother Qi, you placed seventh in the Inter-Sect Martial Meet. You should be able to get a spot to enter the mountain, right?"

Qi Huan's eyes flashed with a hint of gloom upon hearing this. He shook his head and said, "I fell short by quite a bit. I'll compete again next year. I came back this time on the Master's orders to participate in the True Disciple Ceremony of the Casting Hall and secure a True Disciple spot for the Cangfeng Pavilion."

Yue Shan fell silent upon hearing this. Anyone with eyes could see that Qi Huan was in a bad mood.

Qi Huan pondered for a moment and was about to speak when his gaze suddenly sharpened, and the hair on the back of his neck stood on end.

Xu Yunfan put down the pure steel chain in his hand and looked at the tall, straight figure in white standing on the distant peak.

As their eyes met, Qi Huan saw a hint of casual indifference in Xu Yunfan's gaze. Xu Yunfan's expression was calm, but beneath it lay a chill.

*A formidable opponent!*

*Absolutely a formidable opponent!*

Qi Huan's heart grew heavy. His thoughts churned as he slowly retracted his gaze.

Only after watching the other party leave did Xu Yunfan withdraw his gaze and shake his head slightly.

With the True Disciple Ceremony approaching, all sorts of ghosts and monsters were emerging. These days, Fu Jin had been visiting more frequently. However, seeing that Xu Yunfan never left his house, staying cooped up in his courtyard training, he couldn't help but relax a bit.

If Xu Yunfan were to get tired of the stillness and go out for a stroll, many would likely seize the opportunity to challenge him.

Xu Yunfan was actually eager to give it a try. But if the opponent wasn't a formidable enemy, or was someone weaker than him acting beyond their means, the proficiency gain would be negligible. It would only be a nuisance without any benefit.

It would delay his training.

These days, under the influence of medicinal pills, dietary supplements, and medicinal baths, his proficiency was increasing rapidly. Under such a pace of cultivation, the daily increase in proficiency gave him a great sense of achievement.

Late at night, Xu Yunfan slowly withdrew his energy. Looking at the attribute panel, he saw that the Flying Leg Technique was only about twenty-five proficiency points away from reaching the perfect five thousand. This made him feel somewhat impatient.

Being right at the threshold naturally made him feel a bit frustrated.

"What a pity..."

Xu Yunfan felt his entire body ache intensely. He didn't even have the strength to lift his arms or move his legs. His body had reached its limit. If he continued training, his body wouldn't be able to bear it.

After soaking in the medicinal bath, two burly, muscular martial brothers massaged his entire body to permeate the medicinal effects. Only after that did he sit cross-legged on the bed, forming the Seal of the Letter 'Lin' (临) with his hands in front of his chest. He silently recited the Heart Mantra of 'The Highest Good is Like Water' (上善若水心咒). His mind quickly sank into a state of seeming emptiness yet not emptiness. His own spirit, emerging from the swirling mist, took residence in his Sea of Consciousness, settling all distracting thoughts.

After mastering the Entry of the Letter 'Lin' Technique, he had hardly stopped. Although the more he practiced, the more vigorous and clear his spirit became, the proficiency growth was barely noticeable day by day, and the small achievement stage seemed distant.

Early the next morning.

Xu Yunfan swallowed two Primordial Candle Pills. Then, from his bosom, he took out a medicinal pill the size of a quail egg, exuding a pungent medicinal odor. It looked like an iron pellet. It was something Fu Jin had brought.

It was a Rising Sun Pill from the Nine曜 Sect. Worth a hundred gold, it was extremely beneficial for martial artists at the Martial Master level. It was a rare item, and just holding it in hand, it felt like it weighed five pounds.

If not for the reputation of Master Zhan Yan, a forging master, Fu Jin wouldn't have been able to obtain this pill.

For ordinary people, this iron pellet would be indigestible and likely fatal if swallowed. But for a martial artist with terrifying digestive capabilities, it was just right.

*Gulp!*

Xu Yunfan swallowed it. He felt an iron gall sink into his stomach, making his body weight down for a moment. He quickly stimulated his stomach muscles, squeezing with his diaphragm to prevent his stomach from prolapsing.

Soon, wisps of warmth began to flow from his abdomen into his limbs and bones.

He exhaled a breath. Barefoot on the bluestone slabs of the courtyard, he moved back and forth. His toes gripped the ground like eagle talons, the muscles of his calves knotting like old tree roots.

The blood and energy within him surged like a river bursting its banks. Every step he took brought forth a whistling wind, causing the fallen leaves in the courtyard to spiral upwards. The Yongquan acupoints in his soles pulsed rapidly, and his tendons tightened and released like bowstrings. He turned into a blur, shuttling through the one-zhang-square area of the plum blossom stakes.

The medicinal power of the Rising Sun Pill boiled in his flesh and blood. As he exerted his strength, he pushed the medicinal power into his major tendons, causing his legs to burn as if on fire.

*Crack!*

Until nightfall, the third plum blossom stake made of fine steel snapped with a sound.

Xu Yunfan's figure came to an abrupt halt. Sweat dripped down his sharp jaw, splashing like blossoms on the bluestone slabs.

He took a deep breath and picked up a stone lock, binding it to his ankle. The various joint movements, force application, hip movement, and posture of the Flying Leg Technique flowed through his mind like a revolving lantern.

When the medicinal power of the Rising Sun Pill burned his entire body's major tendons to the point of sounding like thunder and lightning, he suddenly opened his eyes and leaped into the air!

*Boom!*

The three-hundred-pound stone lock crashed into the ground, creating a deep pit. Yet Xu Yunfan, like a sparrow turning over, vaulted over the wall.

The night wind filled his clothes, making them snap and flutter. Under the moonlight, one could only see his feet lightly tapping on the roof tiles. Before the copper bells at the eaves could even sway, he had already drifted ten zhang away. His figure then suddenly landed on a branch of the old locust tree in the courtyard, motionless.
