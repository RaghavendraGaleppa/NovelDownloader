# Chapter 65: The True Value of His Talent Continues to Rise, and the Loser’s Punishment is Revealed

Although Ying Bing was puzzled in her heart, she still answered the questions on the paper from the shallow to the profound.

"Sword techniques and sword arts are essentially the same thing, nothing more than precision, flexibility, and making them your own. If you practice a superior sword method to the level of perfection, you fall into this category, which is considered passable."

"However, for those who truly possess Sword Qi, Sword Momentum, Sword Intent, and the Sword Path, sword techniques are merely the experience they summarized on their way to the Sword Path."

Li Mo understood this somewhat, but not completely. He could only apply the mathematics and physics from his previous life to it. Comparing the Sword Path to mathematics, sword techniques and sword arts were like formulas. For most people, the way to solve problems was to apply formulas. Where did the formulas come from? They were summarized by those geniuses who truly reached the origin.

Li Mo nodded and took out paper and pen.

"What are you doing?"

"Hmm, I'm taking notes."

Li Mo smiled and began to write rapidly. It was still simple now; if it got deeper later, he was afraid he wouldn't be able to remember it all.

Ying Bing felt a little confused. In her past and present lives, she had discussed the Dao with others, but this was the first time someone took notes while discussing. After all, these weren't things to be memorized by rote; those who understood would grasp it instantly.

After a pause, she spoke again:

"Sword Qi, Sword Momentum, and Sword Intent are indeed three different paths, yet they lead to the same destination. Let's start with Sword Qi. Before the Great Yu, there was the Great Shang. A great scholar read for sixty years, didn't practice martial arts, didn't train in swordsmanship, and only wrote poetry and composed classics. After sixty years, upon entering the Golden Hall, he used his sharp tongue to criticize the emperor and sever the national fortune of Great Shang. This is the transformation of a scholar's full spirit into Sword Qi."

"As for Sword Momentum, it emphasizes following the trend. The rising sun and falling moon are the momentum of heaven and earth; the blooming and withering of flowers is the momentum of nature; the direction of people's hearts is the momentum of humanity..."

Ying Bing gently poured a cup of tea to moisten her throat. Her current appearance made Li Mo think of the young female teachers from his previous life. Usually taciturn, but once they started lecturing, they had a sacred aura of being confident and in control of the truth.

Of course, Li Mo wasn't just listening seriously; his hand was also writing non-stop.

Half an hour later, seven or eight sheets of paper with still-wet ink were spread out on the table. Little Li licked the tip of his pen with satisfaction. As long as he memorized all of this, he would be terrifyingly strong! That little Princess Jiang would be taken down firmly by him!

Just as Li Mo was feeling proud and satisfied, Ying Bing's inquiring voice came:

"Did you understand everything I just said?"

As a genius capable of asking such questions, she thought that after explaining to this extent, he should have understood seventy to eighty percent.

"I understand!" Li Mo nodded confidently.

"Then tell me your insights."

Ying Bing's eyes, like wind and snow, stared directly into Li Mo's eyes, as if waiting for good news.

"Uh..."

Li Mo's expression froze, his smile gradually disappeared, and he fell into thought. *Was I a bit... too carried away just now? How could I have forgotten that Ice Cube would also test me? Oh, right, it was a discussion. Ice Cube talked for so long; I can't just say nothing.*

But to be honest, he was completely confused. Practicing a hammer and practicing a sword are not the same thing at all... After all, have you ever heard of a blacksmith forging iron for sixty years, then going to the court and killing a tyrant with a single hammer strike?

Sensing a hint of confusion gradually appearing in Ice Cube's eyes, Little Li's CPU started running at high speed. Ying Bing really didn't understand. Just asking him to talk about his insights shouldn't be this difficult to think about, right? Or is it...

---

At this moment, the pondering Li Mo finally spoke, smiling apologetically:

"Sorry, I was thinking a bit too deeply just now."

"In my opinion, Ying Bing, you don't need to make it so complicated. The so-called sword practitioner has only three realms."

"One, limited to technique. The hand has the sword, but the heart has no sword. A common man's rage, blood splatters five steps."

"The second, the hand has no sword, the heart holds the sword. What is practiced is the unity of man and sword, capable of using all things as swords."

"The third, the hand has no sword, the heart also has no sword. At that time, your very existence is the Sword Path."

The calm tone fell. The boy who spoke freely and eloquently seemed to care little about the evaluations of others, merely stating the Sword Path he understood.

Opposite him, the jade-like beauty drinking tea had an expression as if the ice and snow were melting, showing a hint of emotion.

After a long while, she parted her lips:

"Good."

"You taught well."

"No, you are right. The great Dao is simple; simplifying complexity is the correct principle."

"You flatter me."

Li Mo smiled on the surface, but he wiped a huge sweat in his heart. Fortunately, he used to secretly read novels during class in his previous life. His teacher caught him back then and said he wouldn't have a future this way. Look, it came in handy perfectly!

However, seeing Ice Cube moved, with a hint of possibly asking another question, Little Li hurriedly asked first:

"If one only practices sword techniques, can one touch the Sword Path?"

Upon hearing this, Ying Bing pondered. After thinking it over, she nodded:

"Yes, but also no."

"What do you mean by 'yes'?"

Li Mo thought to himself, Ice Cube doesn't seem like someone who speaks in riddles.

"Technique approaches the Dao. Theoretically, this is indeed possible."

"But there are so many sword methods in the world. A normal person spends their entire life learning, and what they acquire is just a ladleful from the ocean. They die of old age before achieving it, so no one can do it, unless... forget it, it's meaningless to dwell on this."

Ying Bing had almost said that only the legendary 'Immortals' could live as long as heaven and earth, having enough time to achieve 'technique approaches the Dao.' But the existence of Immortals is itself even more ethereal and unfathomable than technique approaching the Dao.

"I see."

Li Mo took a deep breath, suppressing the anomaly in his heart.

"It's getting late. Thank you for clearing up my confusion today. I'll go rest now."

With that, Li Mo got up and left gracefully, not taking a single cloud with him. He didn't even mention washing the dishes after eating.

As Li Mo's figure departed, a tree leaf fell into the tea bowl in front of the girl, causing ripples in the tea water reflecting her jade-like face.

The more she interacted with him, the more she felt he was vastly different from his previous life. From the initial mediocrity to now being impossible to ignore. Today, Li Mo had come much closer to the world she inhabited, almost stepping one foot inside.

Of course, her strongest aspect wasn't the Sword Path. But relying on this sword talent, he was already able to stand by her side.

"He compared to Jiang Chulong..."

Ying Bing's thought just arose, then she shook her head silently. Jiang Chulong is a natural sword fetus and once possessed sword bones. This isn't the same starting line and cannot be compared.

[System Prompt: The one-month period is approaching. The system will announce the comparison results in seven days.]

[System will rank all genius martial artists in the Eastern Wilderness Domain.]

[The Loser's Punishment has been determined.]

[Punishment Condition]: "Share the same bed for at least one month with the one who defeated you."

Ying Bing didn't even glance at the so-called punishment. Now she is already at the 20th meridian of the Blood Qi Realm. In seven days, she will completely achieve the Great Blood Qi Circulation and step into the Internal Breath Realm!

One month of Internal Breath, or the penetration of 24 meridians, placed within the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, is also unprecedented and earth-shattering!

In the Internal Breath Realm, possessing the Nine-Colored Phoenix Soul, she can utilize the power of the Great Yin, and also possesses the vision and martial arts accumulation of a Nine Heavens existence.

Among her peers, she cannot think of any existence capable of defeating her.
