# Chapter 457: The Arhat from the True Martial Subduing Dragon Temple Arrives at Cold Crow Pass

A single Arhat from the Bodhi Pure Land entered Cold Crow Pass.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes, uncertain whether the visitor had come to procure supplies or to pick a fight.

It wasn't until the man crossed the city threshold that a fleeting trace of his aura sent a slight tremor through Xu Yunfan's mind.

*True Martial Aura!*

This person also cultivated the *True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture*, and he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator!

In an instant, Xu Yunfan's gaze turned razor-sharp.

The moment that thick, potent aura pierced through the city-protecting great array, the龟蛇 (Tortoise-Snake) Dharma Form within his Dantian began to tremble violently, almost beyond his control.

This was an innate resonance born of the same origin!

"The *True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture*?!"

His knuckles turned white as he gripped the railing of the Xuanming Pavilion. The bluestone railings silently crumbled into dust under the immense strength of a Foundation Establishment expert.

The black light pillar rising from the city gate clearly pulsed with the exact same Big Dipper stellar force that he wielded.

What was even more terrifying was that the opponent's aura was as smooth and fluid as mercury. Under the resonance of the True Martial Seven Mansions, it actually manifested a phantom of the Black Tortoise's true form—a clear sign that he had cultivated the scripture to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage!

However, Xu Yunfan relaxed almost immediately. If the man were truly at mid-Foundation Establishment, it meant he had already forged a small Heaven and Earth within him. But since the roots of the Divine Martial World were perfected within Xu Yunfan, even if the opponent had formed a Heaven and Earth prototype, it couldn't be much stronger than his own.

This was a struggle for the Dao!

A chilling killing intent seeped through Xu Yunfan's teeth.

In the laws of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, cultivators of the same origin would inevitably become mortal enemies if their realms were similar.

"Good, very good, Bodhi Pure Land..."

Xu Yunfan suddenly sneered.

The bald donkeys from the True Martial Subduing Dragon Temple had chosen the worst possible timing—right as he was preparing to draw in the World Root—to make their appearance.

How could this be a coincidence?

They had clearly sensed that the root of the Divine Martial World was about to manifest and had come specifically to snatch it!

When Xu Yunfan flashed to the top of the city gate tower, most of the guarding cultivators had already collapsed.

Pale golden Sanskrit characters snaked across the bluestone ground, each stroke writhing like a living creature, devouring the Yin energy of the Nether River inch by inch. The moment the sinister black mist touched the Sanskrit, it melted away like snow under the scorching sun, transformed by the流转 of Buddhist mantras into specks of golden light.

Pure Buddhist energy rose from the scriptures, forming golden lotuses in the air. Nectar smelling of sandalwood gushed from the lotus hearts, illuminating the entire tower as if it were a pure land of the Buddha realm.

Standing in the center of the Sanskrit array was a monk, gently tapping the ground with his demon-subduing staff.

"Homage to the World Honored One, the Bodhi is in the world."

The monk chanted a Buddhist verse in a low voice. His towering figure, a full zhang tall, stood like a mountain. His ochre cassock was stretched taut by his bulging, knotted muscles.

A bronze-colored dragon tattoo coiled around his exposed right arm, moving like a live thing as his muscles flexed. His neck was as thick as a beam, and the hollows at his collarbones could fit a fist. The muscles of his calves, visible below the cassock, were twisted like old tree roots. Every step he took left a crack an inch deep in the bluestone floor.

"Subduing Dragon Arhat?"

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes, his gaze piercing like lightning as he instantly saw through the man's background.

The Abbot of the True Martial Subduing Dragon Temple. He had achieved Foundation Establishment using the *True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture* long ago. After Xu Yunfan had opened the True Martial Peak to extend his own lineage, he had naturally sensed that there was another person who had also built his foundation with the same scripture.

This monk was the Abbot of the True Martial Subduing Dragon Temple, the Subduing Dragon Arhat who had built his foundation thirty years ago with the *True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture*.

When that man had opened the True Martial Peak lineage back then, the heavens and earth had resonated, and Xu Yunfan had sensed it, realizing that a fellow cultivator of the same origin already existed in the world.

Naturally, he had taken this to heart and gathered relevant information. It was said that this man had once taken three strikes of the Great White Sword Qi from an elder of the Wansheng Sword Sect head-on with his physical body and hadn't retreated a single step.

The monk suddenly looked up.

Despite the weather-beaten face, his eyebrows remained lowered, his expression serene and calm, creating a stark contrast with his formidable physique.

He let out a sudden sigh and shook his head. "Does Benefactor Xu know how much suffering and hardship I endured to cultivate the *True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture*? Yet now, the Yuan Demon Sect has produced another Divine Martial True Person."

The Subduing Dragon Arhat clasped his hands together, lowering his eyes. "Since Benefactor Xu cultivates the *True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture*, you naturally have a karmic connection with the Bodhi Pure Land. It is fitting that you join the True Martial Subduing Dragon Temple as a Guardian Arhat."

Xu Yunfan sneered upon hearing this. "People from your Bodhi Pure Land always speak with such high-sounding rhetoric. Three years ago at the Suspended Mountain, your Mingxin Arhat said the exact same thing, but in the end, wasn't he beaten into a broken golden body by the Primordial Origin Sect?"

The Arhat's expression of compassion remained unchanged. "Benefactor, your words are mistaken. The way of True Martial Arts emphasizes the harmony of Yin and Yang, the interplay of hardness and softness. The Yuan Demon Sect acts with extreme bias, straying from the true meaning of True Martial Arts. If Benefactor were to join our Buddhist path..."

If he could convert Xu Yunfan into Buddhism, he would no longer have to worry about a rival on this path. Using the Bodhi Pure Land's method of spiritual transmission, he could seize Xu Yunfan's entire cultivation base. Perhaps then, he wouldn't even need to enter the Divine Martial World; he could directly draw upon its root within the Taihua Spirit Ruins World and step into late Foundation Establishment.

Thinking of this, the Subduing Dragon Arhat couldn't help but sigh inwardly. After three lifetimes of transmigration, he was finally seeing a glimmer of hope.

"You've calculated this quite well!"

Xu Yunfan sneered, cutting him off. "Do you really think this True Person is ignorant? In the laws of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, cultivators of the same origin must fight for the Great Dao. Foundation Establishment is one thing, but to forge a Golden Core and seize the innate golden nature... you are still far from that."

The Subduing Dragon Arhat finally raised his eyelids. A sharp glint flashed through his seemingly peaceful eyes. "Since Benefactor understands this principle, you should understand that this path can only be walked by one person. This old monk has been an Arhat for thirty years, and my Heaven and Earth prototype is already formed. You have just entered Foundation Establishment, I'm afraid..."

"Hahaha!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly laughed, his voice laced with mockery. "What a fine Heaven and Earth prototype! If what you say is true, why have you been unable to break through for thirty years? The root of the Divine Martial World is under the control of my Primordial Origin Sect. You have no hope of perfecting your Heaven and Earth in this lifetime!"

These words were like a sharp sword, piercing straight into the Subduing Dragon Arhat's heart.

The facts were indeed as he said.

Otherwise, after three lifetimes of transmigration, the Subduing Dragon Arhat would not have remained stuck, unable to advance.

His unflappable, ancient-well-like expression finally cracked. The dragon tattoo on his neck began to writhe violently.

"You..." The Arhat's voice was no longer steady. "So what if the Primordial Origin Sect controls the Divine Martial World? This old monk naturally has..."

"Has what?"

Xu Yunfan pressed forward relentlessly. "Your Bodhi Pure Land doesn't even have a decent Heaven and Earth blessed land. What do you use to compete with the Primordial Origin Sect? Just this half-baked *True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture* of yours?"

The Subduing Dragon Arhat's breathing became noticeably ragged. The muscles under his cassock trembled incessantly. The golden lotuses and Sanskrit characters on the tower flickered erratically, revealing that his state of mind was already in chaos.

"Benefactor, do not remain obstinately deluded!"

The Arhat suddenly raised his voice. The dragon patterns on his right arm came completely alive, roaring and swimming beneath his skin. "This old monk has come here today to sever the foundation of your demonic path!"

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan actually relaxed, standing with his hands behind his back. "Finally dropping the act? You bald donkeys, on the surface are compassionate, but behind the scenes are more ruthless than anyone. What a pity..."

He deliberately dragged out his tone. "...You aren't even as good as that old fox Li Wei. At least he knew to grab the spirit stones and run."
