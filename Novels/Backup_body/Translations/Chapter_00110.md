# Chapter 110: Bringing Calamity to All, Feeding on Humans  

Three thousand li southeast of the capital.  

The Zhenggang Gang traveled through the wilderness.  

To avoid exposing their identities and being targeted by the Golden Ship of Salvation, they avoided the main roads.  

More importantly, Ghost Valley Lingguan was lying on a stretcher.  

The Five Elements Creation Tree used its roots as legs and branches to carry the stretcher.  

At the front of the stretcher was Wall-Climbing Bird, with ropes tied to its horns as it flapped its wings vigorously to lift Ghost Valley Lingguan.  

"You, old man, why did you have to provoke that little girl at your age?"  

Wall-Climbing Bird was exhausted and couldn't help but complain, "You’re a full-fledged Human Immortal! How does it make sense for you to get beaten up like this?"  

Ghost Valley Lingguan lay on the stretcher, staring blankly at the sky, somewhat dazed.  

His current injuries weren’t caused by being hunted by the helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation.  

His previous injuries had mostly healed, but then he saw the little dragon girl.  

She was a miraculous creature!  

She appeared human but had half a dragon horn and a dragon tail.  

She seemed to possess true dragon bloodline, and he’d heard she had been encased in what seemed like a seamless Heavenly Domain Divine Stone within the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven.  

This excited Ghost Valley Lingguan so much that he immediately reached out to tug at her dragon horn—and was promptly beaten into this sorry state.  

"Heavenly Domain Divine Stone can be carved but not refined. How was she sealed inside?"  

"I shouldn’t have left the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven so early. Without seeing it firsthand, it’s hard to study properly."  

"And the Great Zhou Dynasty’s imperial jade seal was actually forged from a true dragon’s horn?"  

"That little girl’s horn is a true dragon’s horn. The Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities Salvation pushed her over, breaking off her horn, and then was targeted by the great terror within the capital. What’s the connection here?"  

"This creature looks human but is far stranger, with a stronger physique, greater flexibility, and more perfect in every way. How was such a being born?"  

"I remember flood dragons lay eggs. So if this little girl grows up and marries, would she lay eggs or give birth?"  

Ghost Valley Lingguan muttered to himself, his eyes flickering as he struggled to get a closer look at the little dragon girl.  

"Old man, stop moving! If she beats you up again, you might just die," Wall-Climbing Bird said helplessly. "You don’t want the world to say that the great Ghost Valley Lingguan, a Human Immortal, was beaten to death by a little girl out of curiosity, do you?"  

"To hear the truth in the morning and die by evening is no regret. If I can uncover the mysteries of all things, what does death matter?" Ghost Valley Lingguan declared.  

"But it’s only noon now—not even time to die yet," Wall-Climbing Bird retorted.  

"Huh?" The Five Elements Creation Tree was confused. "What does the time of day have to do with it?"  

"Of course it does. Listen to me explain…" Wall-Climbing Bird perked up, immediately playing the role of a scholar.  

"Second Brother, listen carefully," the Five Elements Creation Tree quickly took out the Wave-Severing Gu and placed it on Ghost Valley Lingguan, letting it listen attentively.  

By the time Wall-Climbing Bird finished its lecture, the atmosphere had turned strange.  

"Master, bad news! Ghost Valley Lingguan seems to have been poisoned by Little Wave-Severer. Wow… it even bit him seventeen or eighteen times…"  

"Don’t talk nonsense, Birdie! My Second Brother is still young. How could he poison the great Ghost Valley Lingguan, whose medical skills are unparalleled under heaven?" The Five Elements Creation Tree immediately defended its child.  

"Don’t try to argue! Do you think just because he’s dead, there’s no evidence?" Wall-Climbing Bird snapped.  

"Take the bug away…" Ghost Valley Lingguan said weakly. "I have no interest in this bug."  

"Stop arguing…" Li Zhengjing sighed, turning to check on Ghost Valley Lingguan and feeding him some pills. "If you’re bored lying on the stretcher, Elder, I have something here you might find worth studying."  

"What is it?" Ghost Valley Lingguan asked absentmindedly, still eyeing the little dragon girl with regret—he simply couldn’t beat her.  

"This Hall-Pillar Dragon Staff…" Li Zhengjing took it out and placed it on Ghost Valley Lingguan. "How does the crafting method of this item differ from the Yin Soldier forging technique we obtained at Fengdu Mountain?"  

"Hmm?" Ghost Valley Lingguan examined it closely before saying, "There are similarities, but fundamentally, they’re vastly different! The essence of this item is a treasure, whereas the Yin Soldiers… are something between a treasure and a living being—no, more accurately, between a treasure and a deity."  

"A deity?" Li Zhengjing looked puzzled.  

"Take the Heavenly Domain Divine Stone—it can contain the power of a Human Immortal," Ghost Valley Lingguan explained. "The forging of Yin Soldiers also bears traces of the Heavenly Domain Divine Stone, but it’s been shattered. Thus, Yin Soldiers can’t become deities. However, as long as a Yin soul enters one, it becomes a Yin Soldier. Yin Soldiers aren’t deities, nor are they living beings. They’re more like treasures, but different from ordinary ones…"  

"But the Hall-Pillar Dragon Staff is a true treasure," Li Zhengjing said.  

"Correct, but it’s among the highest-grade treasures. If the twenty-five golden dragons within it can give birth to a spirit, it could be considered a true immortal treasure," Ghost Valley Lingguan said. "At that point, it would be a unique form of living being."  

"I see." Li Zhengjing thought to himself, *So I could discern the origins of the Yin Soldiers but not this Hall-Pillar Dragon Staff. But if the Hall-Pillar Dragon Staff eventually gives birth to a spirit, I might be able to use the golden page to uncover its foundation…*  

"This treasure is truly extraordinary."  

Ghost Valley Lingguan mused, wondering if he could use the Hall-Pillar Dragon Staff to suppress the little dragon girl and study the dragon race properly.  

No sooner had the thought crossed his mind than Wall-Climbing Bird snatched the staff away, hiding it in its mouth. *This old man clearly wants to take the Hall-Pillar Dragon Staff for himself. I’ll have to guard Master’s treasures for him.*  

The Zhenggang Gang continued onward, with Wall-Climbing Bird growing increasingly exhausted.  

"I don’t want to be a stretcher-bearer anymore, Master. Can’t we get a carriage?"  

"No! Traveling on the main road is too conspicuous. If the Golden Ship of Salvation ambushes us, we can handle it, but we’d just end up destroying another carriage."  

Li Zhengjing sighed. "Besides, last time we traveled, we got a horse killed—it was turned into mincemeat. Don’t you feel bad for it?"  

Wall-Climbing Bird squinted. "Master, are you just too cheap to spend money and using us as free labor?"  

Li Zhengjing waved his hands dismissively. "Me, the illustrious Zhengjing Immortal Venerable, too cheap to spend money? I just left home with pockets full of silver! I’m doing this to train you. Look at you—a mighty White Phoenix Divine Bird, complaining after carrying a stretcher for less than a few thousand li. If you can’t endure hardship, how will you ever become the king of birds?"  

"Wait…"  

Ghost Valley Lingguan’s expression darkened further. He raised a claw weakly and whispered, "Within six hundred li, there’s a helmsman from the Golden Ship of Salvation. I can sense his token—he’s channeling power into it… I feel terrible…"  

He closed his eyes slightly, his breathing growing labored as if he couldn’t catch his breath. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead, and his gaze became unfocused.  

His injuries were severe, and the Golden Ship’s token suppressed him even more intensely.  

He had long since replaced every part of his body, yet he still couldn’t rid himself of the mark left by the Golden Ship of Salvation.  

"The Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities Salvation must have erased my name from the Golden Ship. That’s why I’ve become a drowned ghost again. Even though I have the Boarding Token, it can’t withstand the helmsman’s authority!"  

"He’s nearby?" Li Zhengjing glanced around, his eyes flashing gold—the Clear Radiance Golden Pupils—but found nothing.  

"Not nearby, but within six hundred li," Ghost Valley Lingguan panted. "He doesn’t seem to be targeting me! He must be fighting someone, using the Golden Ship’s decree as a treasure. My injuries are too severe, so the suppression is especially strong…"  

"Which direction?" Li Zhengjing asked.  

"East," Ghost Valley Lingguan replied.  

"Master, should we go kill him?" Wall-Climbing Bird asked excitedly, sensing the Hall-Pillar Dragon Staff stirring in its mouth.  

"Let’s kill him!" The Five Elements Creation Tree abruptly buried the incident of its child poisoning Ghost Valley Lingguan and waved its branches. "Instead of always worrying about being ambushed by the Golden Ship of Salvation, let’s just kill him!"  

"I agree, but on one condition…" Yuan Zhengfeng suppressed his excitement. "In previous battles, you were the one controlling things. This time, relax completely and let me fight… I’ll solo-kill a Human Immortal!"  

"……"  

Li Zhengjing was speechless. He had always believed in the path of steady growth, so why were all his teammates in the Zhenggang Gang so bloodthirsty?  

At least the little dragon girl was well-behaved, which comforted him.  

"Pak si yi!" The little dragon girl waved her arms, her cheeks flushed with excitement—meaning, *Beat the crap out of him!*  

Ever since the Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities Salvation knocked her over and broke her horn, she had harbored a deep hatred for the Golden Ship of Salvation.  

"Honestly, with this little girl backing us up, plus the Hall-Pillar Dragon Staff, we should be able to take down a Golden Ship helmsman," Ghost Valley Lingguan said, clearly resentful after being hunted for so long. He gritted his teeth. "There’s no reason we should always be the ones running from the Golden Ship. Since we’ve run into him, let’s strike first!"  

"Old Ghost is right!" Wall-Climbing Bird said. "In Birdie’s opinion, that bastard was here to kill us—he was lying in ambush ahead but got exposed for some reason. Either way, he’s our enemy. Let’s beat the crap out of him!"  

"Let’s go!"  

Li Zhengjing strode forward. With morale so high, it would be out of place to suggest avoiding the fight.  

Besides, he had never planned to retreat at the sight of a Golden Ship helmsman. Unless the Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities Salvation himself showed up, anyone sent to intercept them was just delivering themselves to their doom!  

Before long, they arrived outside a small town.  

The pressure on Ghost Valley Lingguan grew heavier, but his injuries were healing rapidly, so he wasn’t suffering too much.  

"Is the helmsman in the town?"  

"No."  

Ghost Valley Lingguan’s eyes flickered as he looked past the town. "But this tiny town alone has nearly a thousand drowned ghosts…"  

He turned to Li Zhengjing. "All ordinary people. They must have been victimized recently."  

Li Zhengjing gripped the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Blade and said, "Elder Ghost Valley, your appearance is rather distinctive. Wait outside the town. I’ll go investigate."  

"Very well."  

Ghost Valley Lingguan nodded. "I’ll rest here. My injuries should fully heal within an hour."  

His medical skills were unparalleled. Now that his limbs had recovered and he could move, his injuries were no longer severe.  

Thus, Li Zhengjing slung the Wutong Wooden Case on his back, swallowed the jade fragment housing Yuan Zhengfeng, and entered the town with the little dragon girl.  

Once inside, he took out some silver from the wooden case and easily learned about recent events in the town.  

"Up ahead at Eight-Line Cliff, there used to be a man-eating tiger that preyed on traveling merchants."  

"Recently, not just our town, but people from villages all around have been going into the mountains to worship the Buddha. It’s incredibly effective!"  

"I even brought back a string of prayer beads—they ward off evil. I’ve been feeling great lately, full of energy even when chopping firewood at dawn. That’s a true Buddha!"  

"Outsider, the Buddha asks not where you’re from. Since you’re here, it’s fate. Why not get a string of prayer beads too?"  

After adding another twenty taels of silver, the middle-aged woodcutter reluctantly handed over his prayer beads, saying he’d get another string tomorrow and donate five taels of incense money to atone.  

Li Zhengjing ignored him, taking the beads and leaving the town to hand them to Ghost Valley Lingguan.  

"This isn’t a Boarding Token, but these so-called prayer beads are forged from human bones."  

Ghost Valley Lingguan examined them. "The method used is from the Golden Ship of Salvation. Keeping them on your person for more than ten days will taint you with the Golden Ship’s aura. After a hundred days, you become a drowned ghost! It seems I was wrong earlier—the townsfolk haven’t become drowned ghosts yet, but they’ve been marked by the Golden Ship…"  

"Not medicine—food!"  

A voice spoke up from behind. "Those two bastards have been spreading these cursed beads everywhere to taint people with evil energy, corrupting their flesh. It’s like pickling fresh ingredients… Once the time comes and they’re properly marinated, they’ll be delicious."  

The speaker wore Daoist robes, his features sharp and imposing, his posture upright. He looked at Li Zhengjing and said calmly, "I’ve been waiting for you here for a long time."  

He pointed at the mountain behind the town. "I’ve only recently become a Human Immortal. I can’t handle this alone, so I waited for you to help me exterminate these demons!"
