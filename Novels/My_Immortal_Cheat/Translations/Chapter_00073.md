# Chapter 73: The Auction

"What's there to browse? A bunch of greenhorns, all fidgety and troublesome." Worman waved his hand, a look of disdain on his face.

The Instrument Nation was a federal-like state with a highly systematic, standardized education. Unlike Heavenly Qin, where ancient aristocratic families almost monopolized the peak of power, and different from Great Luo Academy, which appeared to teach everyone without discrimination but actually had significant drawbacks, Instrument Nation was a moderate blend of the two. It boasted both long-standing ancient aristocratic families and brilliant dark horses rising from common backgrounds. Thus, many of those who came with them this time were children from ordinary families. Even members of great clans like Zhou Xun Chuan were utterly shocked by Heaven Pass, let alone those who rose from obscurity. These past two days, they had been chattering endlessly in Worman's ear, asking questions non-stop, much to his annoyance.

Worman found a restaurant and invited them to sit. Zhou Yan declined the invitation, finding it inconvenient with Zhou Tian and the others. He set a time with Worman and then they parted ways.

Heaven Pass was a colossal city, not one that could be easily explored. Many powerful individuals who had lived there for years had never walked its entirety. Even without lingering in one place, they had only explored a small corner of Heaven Pass in a single day. When they returned to the mansion, the sky was already slightly dark. From the general sent by Marquis Wen, they learned that the people from Great Luo Academy had arrived and had already submitted their calling cards, indicating they would visit tomorrow.

Hearing this news, everyone's gaze turned to Zhou Tian.

"Why are you looking at me? They're just here to visit us. What a polite faction! We should learn from them and socialize more," Zhou Tian said, shrugging.

"Are you genuinely oblivious, or are you just feigning ignorance? They're clearly here with ill intentions, definitely coming for you. There's a good show coming," Zhang Yi had a gloating expression, his white robes as bright as snow. He should have exuded an otherworldly aura, yet at this moment, he was as joyful as a mouse that had stolen rice.

"If soldiers come, we'll block them; if water comes, we'll cover it with earth. If they can really kill me, I'd genuinely thank them." Zhou Tian looked indifferent. He naturally knew the other party meant ill. He had just killed several academy students in the Heavenly Qin imperial capital, something that hadn't happened in many years, almost turning Great Luo Academy into a laughing stock among various factions. How could it end with just a "hello and goodbye"?

"No matter. Keep your back straight. We, Heavenly Qin, fear no one." Zhou Yan wore sky-blue treasured robes. Though it was just a calm statement with little fluctuation in tone, it carried an unyielding domineering aura and an extraordinary demeanor, truly befitting his identity as the Second Prince of Heavenly Qin. Everyone smiled. It was indeed true; although everyone was gloating now, if there were any conflicts later, no one would back down an inch!

It was getting late, and everyone returned to their rooms to rest. Heaven Pass had a curfew at night, and there wasn't much to see. Zhou Tian also yawned and entered his room with a weary expression. Tossing and turning in bed until past midnight, Zhou Tian got up, picked up a prepared piece of cloth, and teleported out of the Heavenly Qin residence.

Perhaps because he had collected money yesterday, Zhou Tian waited a long time on the street but didn't see the patrolling soldiers knocking on any building. He pondered for a long time but couldn't discern what was different about the houses on the street. He went to yesterday's house and looked at it again and again, but Zhou Tian couldn't see any special markings. He couldn't go to this house today. He had already been there once yesterday. Those who had a foothold in the dark underbelly here definitely couldn't be underestimated. Yesterday might have been their first time, so they weren't prepared, but today might be different. You can't shear the same sheep indefinitely; something bad will happen sooner or later.

Sighing, Zhou Tian tied on the cloth strip. He could only resort to the clumsy method – trying one room after another. Zhou Tian's figure continuously flickered across the street, the Heavenly Venerate-tier spell formations suppressing him as if they were nothing. Perhaps there were too many such dark gathering places, or perhaps his luck wasn't too bad this time. He had been prepared to search all night, but after only searching a dozen or so buildings, Zhou Tian found one.

He appeared in a corner of the house, a position he had calculated carefully, doing so every time before teleporting into a building. This place was different from where Zhou Tian went yesterday. This one was gorgeously decorated, resplendent and full of spiritual charm. Similarly, everyone was dressed in black robes, their attention fixed on the central platform, with no one noticing him at all.

On the platform was a wriggling mass of black liquid, occasionally extending tentacles. Countless malevolent spirits emerged from it but struggled to break through the limits of a purple crystal lightning shield, triggering dazzling bolts of lightning.

"Fifty Divine Crystals!" someone among the black-robed figures below the platform called out.

"Are there any higher bids?" The black-robed figure on the platform spoke in a high voice. Not receiving a response, he raised the small purple hammer in his hand high and struck the nearby table, crackling with lightning. "This Ghost Evil Spirit, made from the purest souls of tens of thousands of infants, now belongs to this friend!"

A black-robed person came up, carried the black liquid away, and replaced it with a crystal resembling a divine spark, but it was crimson and shimmered with dazzling light.

"This is a Demon God's Divinity from a forsaken land. Heaven Pass has a regulation that all Demon God Divinities must be turned over, so obtaining this item is not easy. It has miraculous effects for friends on the demonic path. Starting bid, 10 Spirit Crystals!" the black-robed figure on the platform announced.

Zhou Tian understood now. This seemed to be an auction, and what was being auctioned were forbidden items from Heaven Pass.

"Fifteen Divine Crystals!"
"Sixteen Divine Crystals!"
"..."

The market for this item seemed quite good, with bids coming in frequently.

"One hundred Divine Crystals!"

A sky-high price drew everyone's attention. When they saw Zhou Tian in the corner, with only a piece of cloth covering his face, the faces hidden beneath the black robes showed some astonishment. The black-robed figure on the platform also froze. The highest bid just now was only 26 crystals. How did it suddenly jump to 100? No one competed with Zhou Tian. This Demon God Divinity was "taken into his possession." Payment was not made on the spot but after the auction concluded.

Next was Zhou Tian's performance time.

"This is lightning..."
"100 Divine Crystals!"
"From..."
"100 Divine Crystals!"
"..."

Everything was called down by Zhou Tian with a single price. No one could compete with him. Everyone's gaze was no longer on the platform but on Zhou Tian. The people present were not foolish and gradually realized that this guy was here to cause trouble, having already splurged nearly a thousand Divine Crystals in a short while. The black-robed figure on the platform had troubles he couldn't voice. He also suspected Zhou Tian, but they were still in the auction phase. He couldn't go down now to verify if Zhou Tian had the money; that would be ruining his own reputation.
