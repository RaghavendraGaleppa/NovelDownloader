# Chapter 48: A Piece to Play, Not a Pawn to Sacrifice

Yang Can wanted to create the curved-shaft plow.

If he truly succeeded in making this plow, it should be named the "Yang Can Plow."

His name, Yang Can, would become famous throughout the world alongside this plow.

Yang Can did not have a deep understanding of the curved-shaft plow.

However, while it played a huge role in increasing productivity, it was not some high-tech marvel.

Yang Can knew the general principles of the curved-shaft plow, and he had Li Yue, a craftsman who had spent his life making agricultural tools.

The two of them worked together, with one responsible for providing design ideas and general sketches, and the other responsible for bringing them to life. This made the task much easier.

Because of this, Yang Can devoted himself completely to the task.

Yang Can had been selected in Grandma Tu’s plan because of the looks his parents had given him.

But his counterattack against Grandma Tu, forcing Chan Zhi to cooperate, and making Yu Xinglong see his value... all of these operations relied on his own intelligence and wit.

Unfortunately, from the series of arrangements made by the Patriarch Yu, it was clear that he was not being treated as a piece to play, but rather as a pawn to be sacrificed.

If you treat me as a piece to play, I would naturally be willing.

Before having the qualifications to be a chess player, becoming a piece is a necessary path.

But if you treat me as a pawn to be sacrificed, then I cannot just let myself be manipulated.

What Yang Can had to face now was not just whether Chan Zhi would give birth to a boy or a girl nine months later.

He also faced the crisis coming from Yu Xinglong.

Yu Xinglong had sent him to the main branch as an steward, handing over the six large manors and three pastures for him to manage.

From the very beginning, this arrangement had determined his ultimate purpose.

In this game of chess, he was a "trading piece" prepared by the Patriarch Yu.

Either, when the Patriarch Yu was preparing to cross the bridge and dismantle it, he would be the one to step forward and turn against the Chan family, then use his death to quell the Chan family's anger.

Or, when the six large manors had a poor harvest and the Patriarch was questioned by the entire clan, he would be pushed out as a scapegoat.

If Yang Can did not want to become a pawn to be sacrificed, he had to make himself increasingly important.

If he could be like Yi She, with an transcendent status, then even as a retainer, the masters would not be able to casually manipulate him.

On the contrary, the various branches of the Yu family would have to work hard to recruit him and win his support.

However... there were only so many positions available.

If Yang Can wanted to stand out, following the conventional methods would take decades, and he simply did not have that much time to operate.

So, he had to find a different path.

He had set his sights on Feng'an Manor precisely because he was scheming to turn it into his own possession.

Then, his importance would grow.

And now, he had discovered another opportunity to make himself significant.

As long as he could create the "Yang Can Plow," he could become famous throughout the world.

Becoming famous throughout the world was also a form of "power."

In the study at night, a nine-branched lotus bronze lamp illuminated the room brightly.

Young Master Zhang sat in a chair to the side, silently letting out a yawn.

He turned his head away and quietly wiped away the tears squeezed out by the yawn.

It was so late, he originally did not want to come, but as the eldest son of the Zhang family, he should bear more of the family's heavy responsibilities.

Although Zhang Yunyi was not very satisfied with this eldest son, he had to grit his teeth and cultivate him.

Tian Jian Peng Jin and the manor head Lai Gulun were led in by the steward Wan Tai.

Lai Gulun presented a piece of paper covered in messy lines to Zhang Yunyi with both hands.

This was the pattern that he and Peng Jin had secretly observed Yang Can drawing on the ground, and then drew from memory after returning.

Zhang Yunyi sat behind his desk, looking at the drawing in his hand filled with messy lines, his brow furrowed into a knot.

"This... is the thing Steward Yang spent half a day working on?"

"Yes, Steward Yang said he wants to change the straight shaft of the plow to a curved one. Steward Yang said that as long as it is changed this way as he said, it will be much lighter, saving both human and animal labor."

"Oh? And do you two think this is feasible?"

As he spoke, Zhang Yunyi handed the "drawing" to Wan Tai, who then passed it to Young Master Zhang.

Young Master Zhang pretended to carefully examine the drawing.

Peng Jin said awkwardly, "Master, although I am a Tian Jian, I do not plow the fields. As for whether this thing Steward Yang is pondering is feasible, even Blacksmith Li isn't sure. I..."

"Hmm," Zhang Yunyi nodded, the knot in his brow relaxing slightly.

That the shaft changing from straight to curved could greatly save human and animal strength was similar to using pulleys during lifting—it fell within the realm of physics.

But a person who does not understand physics, even if they saw this thing, would not understand why it works.

So, many things that modern people find self-evident and can see through at a glance, people in this era might not necessarily understand.

Many craftsmen, although their skills are exquisite, only know *that* their creations work, not *why* they work, making it difficult for them to improve them.

Since even the Tian Jian and Blacksmith Li were not confident about whether this improved plow would be useful, Master Zhang temporarily put the matter aside.

He stroked his beard and said suspiciously, "Steward Yang made such a grand show of coming down the mountain, but in the end... this is it?"

Peng Jin and Lai Gulun exchanged a glance. Lai Gulun said, "Master, perhaps this person never had any intention of making things difficult for us?"

Young Master Zhang crossed his legs and said lazily, "Then what did he come for? Just go back like this? Wouldn't it have been better if he hadn't come at all? How will he report back to the Patriarch and the Mistress of the main branch?"

Lai Gulun said quietly, "Master, Young Master, I heard that when the Patriarch was discussing the establishment of an heir in the Mingde Hall, the Chan family insisted that the Second Master killed the heir. At that time, it was this Steward Yang. He was the heir's advisor then, and he insisted that the Chan family harmed the heir. If not for that, the Second Master might not have escaped unscathed that day. Do you think it's possible that... this Steward Yang..."

Zhang Yunyi understood, his eyes flashing as he said, "You mean, this person intended to serve the Second Master, so he deliberately stirred up trouble that day to exonerate the Second Master. Now that he is inspecting Feng'an Manor, he is deliberately raising the matter high and putting it down lightly, also showing goodwill to our Second Master?"

Peng Jin said, "Master, it's not impossible."

Young Master Zhang curled his lips and sneered, "If that's the case, why did the Patriarch arrange for him to be the steward of the six large manors? You say he leans towards the Second Master, oh! And then the Patriarch hands over the industries the Second Master returned to a person who leans towards the Second Master? Does that make sense?"

Lai Gulun said, "Young Master, do you think it's possible that the Patriarch knew he was unreliable, and also knew that these six large manors wouldn't be received peacefully, so he made him this steward?"

Young Master Zhang glared, "Why? Is the Patriarch sick in the head?"

Zhang Yunyi got angry, slamming the table and scolding, "Why, why, how can you have so many 'whys' all day long! If you have so many 'whys,' why don't you think about the real 'why'! Of course, it's because once the six large manors have a severe harvest shortage, the various branches will make trouble, and they'll use Yang Can to fill the pit!"

Young Master Zhang was scolded until his face was bright red, and he said sheepishly, "Then why..."

"You shut up!"

Master Zhang was so angry his head hurt. Young Master Zhang closed his mouth resentfully.

Although he was unconvinced, he did not dare to anger his father further.

Zhang Yunyi turned to Peng Jin and Lai Gulun, saying solemnly, "Since Steward Yang is determined to improve the agricultural tools, let him be! If he lacks people, we provide people. If he lacks things, we provide things. If he lacks money, we provide money. Give him whatever he wants."

Lai Gulun and Peng Jin hurriedly agreed, secretly delighted.

The Master is being so generous, we can profit from this.

I thought this was a bitter task, but unexpectedly... hehe.

Zhang Yunyi added, "Of course, you must still keep a close watch on him to prevent any accidents."

Zhang Yunyi thought for a moment, then said to Wan Tai, "Steward, have Xiaotan seduce Accountant Li. If Steward Yang harbors ill intentions against me, his methods will surely be directed through this Accountant Li."

The wheat irrigated by the Yinlong River, ground into fine powder with the finest stone mill, then the flour mixed with water was kneaded into a dough, and repeatedly pushed and kneaded on the board.

Finally, it was placed back into the pottery steamer to slowly awaken in the steam. At this time, with just a pair of skillful hands, it could be stretched into silver-thread-like strands.

When it was fished out from the boiling pot and placed into a celadon bowl, a ladle of sesame oil was poured down, and the broth would shimmer with an amber glow.

Freshly brewed soy sauce sauce and chopped spring leeks were sprinkled on the fresh soup, and then slices of fat roasted mutton were layered on top, and the dish was complete.

Chef Zhu placed the noodle bowl, the pepper jar, the dogwood jar, and the salt jar on a serving tray, carried it with one hand, and floated out of the kitchen.

"Steward Yang, this is the noodles you requested."

Chef Zhu placed the noodles in front of Yang Can, then grabbed his apron and habitually rubbed his hands.

Yang Can was sitting, and the aroma of the noodles and the freshness of the soup immediately wafted over him.

"Good, excellent skill."

Yang Can did not expect a bowl of late-night snack to be made so deliciously.

He added some salt, pepper, and dogwood according to his taste, and then gently stirred it with chopsticks.

As he carried out these steps methodically, Chef Zhu stood to the side with his waist slightly bent, his back to the outside.

And his mouth was quietly making sounds: "Steward, Da Kuan said, following your instructions, he has already arranged for people to act, and we will soon obtain the news you want."

Yang Can calmly lifted a strand of noodles with his chopsticks.

The fragrance of wheat flour from the loess land and the aroma of mutton from the Long River shoals,

Combined with the taste of pepper from the Western Regions and the flavor of dogwood from the Helan Mountains,

Made one's appetite surge.

Yang Can listened to Chef Zhu's words without changing his expression, eating the noodles slowly and leisurely.

Chef Zhu was, of course, not his real name; it was just that he had been a chef for so long that his name had not been called for a long time.

His name was Zhu Weipeng, a very resounding and imposing name.

Perhaps his father had hoped that this child would grow up to kill thieves and slaughter enemies, establish merit and career, and become a mighty general.

However, many years later, the blade in his hands did not cut through enemy armor, but rather the spines of pigs and sheep.

The bowstring his arms pulled was not a bow, but the trembling stretched noodles.

The light illuminating his face was not the beacon fires on the watchtowers, but the leaping flames in the stove.

But isn't this also a different kind of battlefield command?

When his ladle clinks against the edge of the pot, the sound is the "General's Order" of a chef.

He is Cheng Dakuan's brother-in-law, the head chef at Feng'an Fortress. His name is Zhu Weipeng.
