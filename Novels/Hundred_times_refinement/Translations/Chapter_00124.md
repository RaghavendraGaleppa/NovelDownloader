# Chapter 74: The Talisman Gathering

Speaking of the pride of their sect, Wang Xin's face was filled with admiration. However, he dared not boast recklessly in front of this senior brother from Piaoyun Valley and answered honestly, "Elder Tianyuan's magic power is profound, and the talismans he crafts are incredibly powerful, as if naturally formed. But that doesn't necessarily mean he can defeat a Core Formation master—it's more that their strengths are comparable."

"Hmm." Lin Xuan nodded. He was only mildly interested in Tianyuan's strength; what truly concerned him was how to purchase high-grade talismans from the elder.

Wang Xin didn't keep him in suspense and proceeded to share the information Lin Xuan sought.

It turned out that Elder Tianyuan was not only a master of talisman crafting, the foremost expert in Daofu Mountain, but also had a rather eccentric temperament...

For instance, the monthly Talisman Gathering was originally intended to provide convenience for low-level disciples. The stalls were primarily run by Qi Refining cultivators. However, as the gathering's reputation grew, more and more cultivators came seeking its fame. Each transaction yielded a considerable amount of spirit stones, and the substantial profits gradually made Foundation Establishment cultivators envious. Yet, mindful of their status, they were too embarrassed to set up stalls themselves. Instead, they handed their talismans to their disciples to sell on their behalf.

Tianyuan, however, was different. As the foremost talisman master of the sect, his status was revered, yet he cared little for matters of face. From time to time, he would personally attend the gathering and even sell some high-grade talismans.

Strictly speaking, this violated Daofu Mountain's rules. But who was Tianyuan? The sect's top expert. Who dared to reprimand him? Even the sect leader could do nothing about this eccentric senior brother.

"So, Elder Tianyuan might appear at the gathering and sell high-grade talismans?" Lin Xuan's eyes lit up.

"Not necessarily. Elder Tianyuan's actions are as unpredictable as a dragon's head and tail—sometimes he attends several gatherings in a row, other times he's absent for months. And even when he does come, he might not sell anything. It all depends on his mood at the time. If Senior Brother Ye wishes to buy high-grade talismans, you'll have to rely on luck."

Lin Xuan fell silent. This master truly had an eccentric way of doing things. Still, having hope was better than none. It all depended on his luck today.

As they spoke, the two reached the mountaintop, only to find it empty.

Wang Xin reached into his robe, took out a talisman, and threw it into the air before them, shouting, "Disperse!"

Instantly, a brilliant silver light appeared in the air, expanding into an arched gateway large enough for a person to pass through.

"Senior Brother, please."

Without hesitation, Lin Xuan stepped into the silver light. Suddenly, his vision expanded—pavilions, towers, birdsong, and fragrant flowers—a scene straight out of an immortal's paradise.

"Senior Brother, I can only accompany you this far. Take this waist token. After ascending the stairs, turn left to the west, and you'll reach the talisman market."

"Thank you, Junior Brother."

"You're too kind."

Wang Xin bowed respectfully. Though he had shared much about Daofu Mountain with Lin Xuan, none of it was particularly secretive for allied sect disciples. In contrast, Lin Xuan's few pointers on cultivation had greatly benefited him.

Taking the waist token, Lin Xuan bid farewell to Wang Xin and followed his directions toward the talisman market.

Along the way, the number of cultivators gradually increased. Apart from Daofu Mountain disciples, many had come seeking the gathering's fame—all from allied sects, of course. No hostile factions or even neutral rogue cultivators were permitted to participate in the trade.

Though it was merely a war of attrition, the conflict between the two major cultivation sects and their allies had already thrown the entire Yanzhou cultivation world into a state of tension.

With an identification spell embedded in his body and the waist token from Wang Xin, Lin Xuan passed through without hindrance, arriving directly at the talisman market.

It was a long street lined with stalls on both sides, with hawking voices occasionally rising. To an uninformed observer, it might have seemed like a mundane marketplace.

Lin Xuan remained expressionless as he browsed leisurely. Unlike before, his cultivation had now reached the Great Perfection stage of Qi Refining, and his strength was incomparable to the past. Naturally, he was no longer interested in low-grade talismans. Even mid-grade talismans were only worth considering if they were defensive in nature. The reason was simple—with his improved cultivation and mastery of Spirit Control Art, his offensive power now relied on spirit tools, making offensive talismans far less appealing.

Unlike low-grade talismans, mid-grade ones, though only a tier higher, cost several times more. Though Lin Xuan was wealthy, possessing over a hundred and twenty low-grade spirit stones, he couldn't afford to waste them. Good steel must be used for the blade's edge, and spirit stones should only be spent where necessary.

Though the stallholders were all Qi Refining disciples, many Foundation Establishment cultivators had entrusted their talismans to their disciples for sale. As Lin Xuan walked, he saw no shortage of fine products.

"Senior Brother, how about buying one? A Flight Talisman—lets you ride the clouds and mist. Even without a spirit tool, you can soar freely through the skies."

A young man in his twenties held out a talisman pulsing with spiritual energy, introducing it to Lin Xuan. It was a mid-grade talisman imbued with the "Flight Technique," a fine auxiliary talisman that had many low-level cultivators eyeing it covetously. But upon hearing the price, they backed away in dismay.

Two spirit stones—far beyond their means.

Lin Xuan, however, was well-off. But now that he had mastered Spirit Control Art and could fly using spirit tools, such a talisman no longer interested him.

Seeing Lin Xuan's lack of interest, the stallholder wasn't discouraged. "What kind of talisman do you need, Senior Brother? To be honest, though my own cultivation is lacking, my master is a mighty Foundation Establishment mid-stage expert. Many of the talismans here were crafted by him."

"Foundation Establishment mid-stage?"

Lin Xuan had been about to leave, but these words made him pause. The works of a Foundation Establishment cultivator might just have what he sought.

"Do you have any defensive talismans?"

"Defensive ones?" The young man scratched his head. "Yes, of course!"

He then pulled out a handful of talismans from his robe.
