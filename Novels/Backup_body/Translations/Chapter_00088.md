# Chapter 88: The Fall of the Debt Master!

Li Zhengjing had gathered his momentum, his external mana swirling like a dragon, his sword intent sharp and overwhelming. With a single step, he soared into the sky, his aura vast and mighty! Facing this overwhelmingly powerful Debt Master, he merely glanced at the fortune displayed on the golden page before charging forward fearlessly.

"Human Immortal?" The Debt Master's eyes flickered with surprise, a faint smile appearing. "You've given me quite the surprise!"

"Then let me show you what true terror is!" Li Zhengjing's sword light pierced through the void in an instant. He slashed with his blade, lightning flashing! The Debt Master blocked the sword light and the thunderbolt, but before he could counter, the Ancient Moon Peak Master attacked again. Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing's blade did not stop—uninterrupted by the Debt Master, he struck again and again. Each slash fused with the residual power of the previous thunderbolt, growing increasingly ferocious.

White Mist Divine Bird, wreathed in flames, lashed out with its claws, aiming to tear the Debt Master apart. Yet the Debt Master merely shook his body, sending the bird flying. Ghost Valley Spirit Official spread his wings, golden light flashing as he struck with a dragon claw. The Debt Master flicked a finger, blocking the attack, but then Ghost Valley Spirit Official's ribs split open, revealing four additional arms! Each arm wielded a divine ability, unleashing a torrent of flames!

The Debt Master's protective mana shield held, but he was still blasted back dozens of miles, his expression shifting slightly. Everyone was stunned, turning to look. Only Li Zhengjing remained calm, thinking to himself, *"I knew it. Ghost Valley Spirit Official, upon seeing the Three-Headed, Six-Armed Dark Execution Ghost King, wouldn't stay idle. To think he grew four more arms in just a few days, each imbued with the Divine Fire ability! But why didn't he grow three heads?"* 

Even as he pondered, he didn't hesitate. Raising his left arm, he unleashed another Divine Fire strike—this one infused with the Great Void Transformation Sword Qi, transforming it into a Divine Fire Sword, its power even greater! The Formation Pavilion Master also seized the moment, his body surrounded by formations that materialized in the air to protect him. With every movement, he hurled one formation after another at the Debt Master—formations of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, endlessly varied. Even the ground beneath them erupted with formations, earthen spikes shooting upward like spears!

But the strongest among them was still the Ancient Moon Peak Master. Now, his hair had turned entirely gray, yet his combat power had only increased. He pressed forward relentlessly, accompanied by the roars of dragons and tigers, wind and rain swirling around him. 

"You no longer have infinite mana!" the Ancient Moon Peak Master said coldly, charging forward, his left hand forming a seal while his right executed a sword technique. 

"Dealing with you lot is more than enough!" The Debt Master remained utterly unshaken. He took a single step, traversing thousands of feet in the sky as he faced the five Human Immortals. Though he remained composed, his fighting style was no longer as unrestrained as before. His divine abilities were no longer casually unleashed, nor did he attempt to suppress the five Human Immortals with brute force. He had begun conserving his mana.

Looking at the Ancient Moon Peak Master, he shook his head slightly. "Your vitality is nearly exhausted. Even if I don't kill you, after this battle, no amount of heavenly treasures will restore you. Worse—under the demonic technique of burning blood to fuel the Dao, if you don't stop now, you won't last half an hour before your life force burns out, and you perish on the spot!"

"As long as I kill you, it doesn't matter!" The Ancient Moon Peak Master's white hair fluttered, but his eyes blazed with determination.

"You wish to kill me and take my place as the new Debt Master?" The Debt Master's voice was calm. "As the Debt Master, your soul will never perish. You can simply take a new body, free from the constraints of lifespan."

In that instant, the atmosphere grew even heavier. Li Zhengjing frowned slightly. Ghost Valley Spirit Official seemed unsurprised—or perhaps indifferent. But White Mist Divine Bird's eyes flickered with uncertainty. The Formation Pavilion Master also shot a suspicious glance at the Ancient Moon Peak Master. With just one sentence, the Debt Master had sown discord among the five Human Immortals, casting doubt on the strongest among them.

"Truly an ancient monster, using a single sentence to break our united resolve," the Ancient Moon Peak Master said flatly, continuing his assault. But the Debt Master suddenly dodged him, turning instead toward Li Zhengjing—the weakest of the five.

"Today's events began with you as the chess piece. Since it started with you, I'll start by taking your life!" The Debt Master's gaze was icy. "If this fruit is ruined, I'll simply find another!" 

He attacked without restraint. By eliminating Li Zhengjing, he could reduce the pressure from one Human Immortal and swiftly crush the remaining four, who were already exhausted.

"Retreat!" Yuan Zhengfeng's voice echoed in Li Zhengjing's mind. But Li Zhengjing focused, glancing once more at the golden page's fortune before his gaze landed on Elder Gu, who lay below, barely alive, his eyes dimming. 

Elder Gu's eyes were filled with worry. 

*I can't retreat.*

"Come fight!" Li Zhengjing surged forward, his external mana transforming into the Great Void Transformation Sword Qi, coalescing into a dragon that charged ahead! His left arm extended, unleashing the Divine Fire Sword—a pillar of flame piercing forward! He raised the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Blade and slashed five times in succession! Five thunderbolts, each stronger than the last, surged forth!

At the same time, the Formation Pavilion Master's formations bombarded the Debt Master's position! White Mist Divine Bird spread its wings, flames billowing to seal off the surroundings. Ghost Valley Spirit Official's eyes gleamed, piercing through the flames with a beam of light that struck the Debt Master directly! The Ancient Moon Peak Master even plunged into the storm of divine abilities, reaching into his robes to grasp the Soul-Slaying Whip he had hidden away!

But at that moment, the dust settled. The residual energy dissipated—and the Debt Master was gone.

"Here." The voice came from behind. 

Li Zhengjing's body turned ice-cold. Then, excruciating pain erupted in his chest. 

The Debt Master's finger struck his back, his mana piercing straight through Li Zhengjing's body! 

"The Evergreen Sacred Body can recover from any injury. Let's see how you regenerate after I reduce you to ashes!" The Debt Master's voice was sinister as his mana flooded Li Zhengjing's body, ready to annihilate him in an instant.

Yet at that very moment, a brilliant light erupted around Li Zhengjing, spanning a hundred feet in radius. The Debt Master's movements froze for the briefest instant.

"You fell for it." Li Zhengjing's voice was low as he opened the acupoints on his back, unleashing a surge of mana. Though he had no time to form the Great Void Transformation Sword Qi, the burst of power was enough to force the Debt Master back! 

Then Li Zhengjing plummeted from the sky.

"Good..." Elder Gu's eyes dimmed as he exhaled his last breath. Around him, arranged in the eight trigrams formation, were eight bronze mirrors covering a hundred-foot radius on the ground, their light shining upward to trap the Debt Master in the air. 

Had Li Zhengjing retreated earlier, the formation would have failed. But because he stood his ground, the Debt Master was now ensnared.

"We've been waiting for you." Formation Pavilion Master panted heavily. The eight mirrors bore his handiwork, but without a way to lure the Debt Master in, he had relied on Elder Gu—who clung to his last breath—to set the trap. And Li Zhengjing had been the bait.

"Kill!" This time, no one held back. 

No longer conserving their strength, they unleashed their final attacks! 

The Ancient Moon Peak Master's white hair fluttered as his skin aged rapidly. Gathering the last of his mana, he summoned the dragon and tiger apparitions, charging into the formation to clash with the Debt Master amidst wind, rain, and thunder! 

White Mist Divine Bird condensed all its remaining mana into its divine ability, unleashing a torrent of Divine Fire into the eight trigrams formation! 

The Formation Pavilion Master activated every defensive formation he had left, transforming them into mountains that crashed down upon the Debt Master. Then he poured his remaining mana into a hurricane formation, amplifying the flames with wind!

Ghost Valley Spirit Official's four arms unleashed Divine Fire, his eyes flashing as he activated his pupil technique. His wings spread, and every golden feather transformed into a blade, piercing forward!

Within the hundred-foot radius of the eight trigrams formation, space itself trembled, nearly shattering. The sky inverted; the earth turned to ruins. That tiny space endured countless attacks, obliterated again and again.

"Under such an assault, who in this world could survive?" The Formation Pavilion Master gasped for breath as he collapsed to the ground, a weak smile on his face. "Even if the Heavenly Azure Dao Ancestor were alive, he wouldn't withstand this!"

White Mist Divine Bird, too exhausted to flap its wings, landed and said, "Unless a true immortal descended, he should be dead."

Ghost Valley Spirit Official retracted his now-bare wings, his expression grave. "At his peak, he once invaded the underworld, rivaling a true god. But this was likely his weakest state in millennia. He shouldn't have survived..."

All eyes then turned to the Ancient Moon Peak Master, who now resembled a withered old man, stirring unease. 

The Debt Master was dead. 

Would the Ancient Moon Peak Master seize the Debt Master's mantle to save himself? 

With his vitality drained, only by becoming the Debt Master could he survive. 

If he intended to do so, how would the others respond?

"Don't let your guard down," the Ancient Moon Peak Master said hoarsely, his voice frail. No longer the immortal sage, he now seemed like a candle in the wind, barely clinging to life. Yet he forced himself up, drawing the Soul-Slaying Whip from his robes.

With a deafening crash, the eight bronze mirrors shattered! 

The storm of wind and thunder dissipated; the flames and smoke cleared. The mountains turned to dust, revealing the Debt Master sitting cross-legged amidst the ruins.

"He's still alive?" Formation Pavilion Master exclaimed.

"No, he's dead," Ghost Valley Spirit Official said, observing the lifeless, broken body. "But to think such an assault didn't reduce his body to ashes..."

Li Zhengjing closed his eyes, sensing the Heavenly Azure Dao Treasure within him repairing his injuries. He swallowed several spirit stones to replenish Yuan Zhengfeng's mana, preventing his soul from dissipating due to exhaustion.

"All of you are spent, aren't you?" 

The Debt Master's voice echoed, seemingly coming from everywhere. 

Dread filled their hearts as they looked around, despair creeping in. 

The Debt Master still lived?

"You're exhausted. But I still have strength left." 

The aged laughter reverberated. 

Amidst the shattered ruins lay a stone statue—one carved from Celestial Domain Divine Stone. 

"Oh no! The Debt Master's soul is indestructible. He abandoned his body and took over the statue to revive himself!"

"There are spirit stones around the statue—he can replenish his mana instantly!"

"We're finished!"

The atmosphere grew suffocating. 

These Human Immortals, who once stood above the mortal world, now seemed utterly helpless. 

Even the Ancient Moon Peak Master showed despair. "Is he truly this unfathomable?"

They had exhausted every means to exploit the Debt Master's weakness, to corner him here. 

Though the ambush had succeeded beyond expectations, they had still won. 

But even in death, the Debt Master could revive through the statue, with spirit stones ready to restore him. 

Though the Debt Master had looked down on them, never truly seeing them as threats until the Golden Pool's lava was exhausted, he had still prepared a contingency.

"Even a lion uses its full strength to kill a rabbit. So did I."

The body that once belonged to Jing Xiao crumbled into dust. 

From it, a golden stream—the liquefied mana of a Human Immortal—flowed toward the statue. 

Just as despair took hold, an enraged roar erupted. 

"Why are these low-grade spirit stones?!"

A thunderous explosion followed as the Celestial Domain Divine Stone statue shattered into rubble. 

Silence fell once more over the Falling Dragon Realm.

"Tree God is amazing!" Li Zhengjing's eyes snapped open in joy. He released the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Blade and beckoned to the Ancient Moon Peak Master. "The whip!"

Without hesitation, the Ancient Moon Peak Master tossed the Soul-Slaying Whip to him! 

The Debt Master's soul was indestructible—only the underworld's Soul-Slaying Whip could erase him!

In an instant, Li Zhengjing lashed out, sweeping the whip in a devastating arc! 

Wherever it passed, the golden liquefied mana vanished, and the Debt Master's furious roars filled the air.

"Impossible! How could I lose?!"

"I've schemed across the ages, unrivaled in this world!"

"I hold the Debt Master's token, overlooking all immortal sects and Buddhist temples! No dynasty can withstand my plunder! No one can defy me!"

The Debt Master's voice was laced with horror. 

Li Zhengjing cleared another swath of golden mana. 

The remnants tried to burrow into the earth, but Li Zhengjing was ready. His external mana formed a dragon, encircling and trapping them!

Just as he raised the whip for the final strike, the Debt Master's golden mana surged along Li Zhengjing's own mana, rushing toward his acupoints to seize his body.

"Sever the connection!" Yuan Zhengfeng shouted. 

Li Zhengjing cut off his mana instantly and swung the whip toward the remnants—one last strike to erase the Debt Master forever!

But then, time itself seemed to slow. 

Li Zhengjing's thoughts remained sharp, but his movements dragged as if weighed down. 

The golden mana hurtled toward him, a radiant object within it illuminating the space. 

A single glance, and Li Zhengjing felt his very soul being pulled toward it! 

Yet at that moment, a hand reached out, taking the whip and striking the golden mana just as it was about to invade Li Zhengjing's body!

The Debt Master let out a final, unwilling roar. 

His last remnants of mana dissipated into nothingness. 

But Li Zhengjing looked down. 

A wisp of golden mana had already entered his body through an acupoint. 

Instantly, he activated the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, channeling the Debt Master's mana into the golden page, where it transformed into spiritual energy to nourish him. 

The Debt Master was truly gone. 

Yet faintly, Li Zhengjing heard a sigh. 

"So it was all... a mistake... a trap..."

Silence. 

It was finally over. 

But Li Zhengjing felt disoriented. 

The strange light from the Debt Master's golden mana had destabilized his soul—after all, he wasn't a true Human Immortal whose soul had condensed into a Yin Spirit. 

"Don't worry! A mere fatal wound—I can heal it!" Ghost Valley Spirit Official's voice reached him. 

Li Zhengjing's vision darkened, but his fading gaze caught sight of the Ancient Moon Peak Master—now ancient and frail—holding an object left behind after the Debt Master's destruction. 

*Is that the Debt Master's token?* 

His consciousness slipped further as voices echoed around him—the Ancient Moon Peak Master, the Formation Pavilion Master, White Mist Divine Bird, Ghost Valley Spirit Official. 

First relief, then anger, then arguments. 

"Will you take the Debt Master's token and become the new Debt Master?" 

Auras flared. Had they not been utterly drained, another battle might have erupted. 

But eventually, calm returned. 

"The Debt Master's token shall be sealed and delivered to the sect, for the Sect Master and Elders to decide its fate!" 

The Ancient Moon Peak Master's voice was weak. "As for the Debt Master's body, it was promised to Ghost Valley Spirit Official. Once he has studied it, he will deliver it to the sect..." 

"Your vitality is exhausted, your foundation ruined. No treasure can restore you. You won't last the year," Ghost Valley Spirit Official said. 

"It doesn't matter," the Ancient Moon Peak Master replied. 

The voices grew chaotic again, debating something else. 

Finally, it was decided: Ghost Valley Spirit Official and Li Zhengjing would remain, while the Ancient Moon Peak Master and the others would return Elder Gu's body to the sect. The previous Sect Master's remains would also be retrieved, and together with the Debt Master's token, handed over to the current Sect Master and Elders for deliberation. 

Then Li Zhengjing lost consciousness entirely. 

In the darkness, only one thought lingered. 

*So it was all... a mistake... a trap...* 

---

When Li Zhengjing awoke, he had no sense of how much time had passed. 

Blinking at the sky, he felt dazed. A dragon claw extended beside him, offering a letter. 

"You've been unconscious for three days. This news is from before." 

Three days ago, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect had sent word to all major factions: 

The Debt Master had appeared! 

His current incarnation was the Ancient Moon Peak Master of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. After his identity was exposed, he had attempted to silence all witnesses. 

Elder Gu Xuan of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect and the Formation Pavilion Master had fallen to his hand. 

The sect's guardian divine bird, the White Luan, had been critically injured and was now missing. 

The former Ancient Moon Peak Master—the true Debt Master—was now at large. 

The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect invited all major factions to discuss his capture! 

On the same day, the Luofu Immortal Sect had been thrown into chaos. After investigation, it was revealed that their Sect Master—one of the world's most powerful cultivators—had been assassinated in his secluded meditation. 

Half of Luofu's ten peak masters were dead or injured. Countless elders had perished. 

The sect's three-thousand-year-guarded opportunity had been stolen. 

The battle had left Luofu's leadership decimated, their foundation shaken. Their status as an immortal sect now hung by a thread. 

The culprit? 

The legendary Debt Master. 

In a single day, the world had been upended. And the blame fell squarely on the former Ancient Moon Peak Master—the current Debt Master. 

"Three days ago, we killed the Debt Master here. At the same time, the Luofu Sect Master was slain, and their opportunity was stolen." 

Ghost Valley Spirit Official's voice was heavy. "Have you ever considered that the so-called Debt Master... might himself have been nothing more than a 'harvest' in someone else's scheme?"
