## Chapter 22: Peak Alchemist, Huo Yuan

With the agreement settled, Yang Ji no longer hesitated. He began a frenzy of pill concoction, earning spirit stones to prepare for future purchases of high-grade spirit herbs.

Jin Dafu delivered various low-grade spirit herbs and pill formulas to him, including more than a dozen types of formulas such as Serenity Pills, Yellow Dragon Pills, Foundation Cultivation Pills, Spirit Lure Pills, and Fasting Pills, along with a vast quantity of spirit herbs.

Yang Ji merely glanced at the spirit herbs required for each formula and a rough outline of the refining method before he began.

One by one, spirit herbs were casually tossed into the alchemy cauldron, and then he manipulated the flames at will.

Beside him, Huo Yuan, who was permitted to observe, gasped in astonishment the first time he witnessed Yang Ji's alchemy.

After a series of operations, Yang Ji's technique deviated greatly from Huo Yuan's expectations; it was riddled with flaws and touched upon numerous alchemy taboos. Was this truly the work of a grandmaster?

If Yang Ji's alchemy method were attempted by an alchemy apprentice, Huo Yuan would have berated them mercilessly.

Who would be so brazen as to directly lift the cauldron lid and casually toss in spirit herbs?
All alchemists worry about heat escaping the cauldron, the temperature losing balance, and ultimately becoming uncontrollable.
So, who wouldn't just slide the lid open a tiny crack, quickly covering it again after adding the spirit herbs?

Only Yang Ji left the cauldron lid suspended in the air, revealing a large opening, and he didn't even flinch as air rushed in.
And for melting spirit herbs, he didn't pre-regulate the heat before directly using intense fire to refine them?
Was he not afraid of the spirit herbs turning into ash in the blink of an eye?

Furthermore, the fusion of medicinal liquids also left him dumbfounded. Yang Ji simply activated the array within the cauldron, and with a swing of spiritual power, he chopped off more than half of a spirit herb's liquid.
Such a brutal operation made Huo Yuan's heart pound in fear.

When fusing medicines, who would operate so crudely? At such a critical moment, who wouldn't carefully remove impurities bit by bit, then slowly proceed while observing the progress of the liquid fusion?
This kind of wild, rough operation belonged to only one person: Yang Ji.
It was utterly inconceivable, making it difficult for Huo Yuan to comprehend or agree with.

Yet, the person before him was a Peak Alchemist, leaving no room for Huo Yuan to question. While staring, his heart was filled with endless doubts.

Yang Ji turned his head to look at Huo Yuan, whose brow was furrowed into the character "川" (river), and said faintly, "Do you have many questions?"

"Reporting, Master, I do have many doubts. The first step, warming the cauldron, greatly puzzles me. Doesn't the pill formula state the time should be one incense stick's worth? Also, the ratio for fusing medicinal liquids differs significantly from what's recorded in the formula." Huo Yuan composed himself and bowed.

"When you normally warm the cauldron for one incense stick's time, do you immediately wrap the first Spirit Radiance Grass in spiritual power to prevent it from being burned by the flames?" Yang Ji asked.

"Yes, if it's not wrapped in spiritual energy, the Spirit Radiance Grass will be burned," Huo Yuan replied honestly.

"If that's the case, why do you need to warm the cauldron for an incense stick's time, allowing the internal temperature to reach such a high level? Isn't that just creating trouble for yourself?" Yang Ji retorted mildly.

"For refining Spirit Radiance Pills, warming the cauldron for one incense stick's time is recorded in the pill formula. It's a rule passed down by elder predecessors, which I must obey," Huo Yuan replied.

"Rules are set by the strong. The reason you dare not overstep them is that your understanding of the Dao of Alchemy has not reached the point where you can break free from its shackles. You can only follow conventions, adhere to the experience of your predecessors, and treat it as sacred scripture."

"My understanding of the Dao of Alchemy is superior to yours. The capable one comes first, so consider me a predecessor. Therefore, if I write down a pill formula, will you follow it?"

Yang Ji swept his storage pouch and slowly handed over a revised pill formula.
He calmly watched Huo Yuan, whose expression shifted repeatedly. The opportunity had been presented; whether he could seize it depended on whether he could break free from the constraints of his predecessors.

The pill formula lay before him, yet above Huo Yuan's head, the words [Discard?] and [Hesitate!] appeared.
At this very moment, Huo Yuan was making a choice, and it was also a contest between Yang Ji and those old predecessors.
If Huo Yuan believed in Yang Ji even slightly more, he would accept the pill formula. But if the predecessors held more weight in his heart, he would feel resistance towards Yang Ji's formula.

Yang Ji waited for his decision. This undoubtedly required him to shatter his past beliefs. It was difficult to establish Yang Ji as a revered figure in his heart!
Huo Yuan was undoubtedly in an intense internal struggle.
Whether he could take this step mentally depended on his own fortune.

What seemed like a simple choice would, if it were an Earthling, undoubtedly result in them clenching their fists and saying, "I want it all!"
But for local cultivators whose ideas are solidified, whose beliefs are like bedrock, and who revere the Dao as it was from the beginning, making it difficult to break once formed:
Making this choice was undoubtedly questioning everything he had learned in the past.

Huo Yuan was different from Jin Dafu. Jin Dafu was a merchant; the alchemy technique wasn't important to him, only the final pill.
Huo Yuan, however, was a devout follower of the Dao of Alchemy; the techniques and experiences of his predecessors were etched into his heart, and he dared not break them.
In fact, true achievers in the Dao of Alchemy are never rigid; their minds are more active and flexible.
Just as Jin Dafu's eyes lit up when he first saw Yang Ji's alchemy, in Huo Yuan's eyes, it was nothing but a string of errors.

At this moment, Huo Yuan's expression shifted back and forth, clearly making a decision internally. Finally, he exhaled, slowly bowed, and took the pill formula.

"Thank you, Master, for imparting the Dao of Alchemy."

"Heh, it seems this old Daoist Huo Yuan isn't so conservative after all. To be able to overcome this mental hurdle, he has potential!" Yang Ji thought with a smile.

On the pill formula Yang Ji gave Huo Yuan, he had written many different solutions in the form of permutations and combinations, including the refining heat required for spirit herbs of different ages, and the ratios needed when fusing spirit herbs of various ages.
This allowed Huo Yuan to follow the formula like applying a mathematical equation. Yang Ji had simplified alchemy.

After receiving the pill formula, Huo Yuan remained by the side, studying it intently with his eyes darting back and forth.
After refining thirty cauldrons of pills, Yang Ji left the alchemy room, handed some pills to Jin Dafu, and returned to his stone chamber to cultivate.

Three days of cultivation quickly passed.

On this day, a sudden excited shout echoed:

"Hahahahaha, I, Huo Yuan, have finally refined a top-grade low-grade spirit pill! I, Huo Yuan, have finally become a Peak Alchemist!"
"Master, Master, I succeeded, I succeeded!"

Huo Yuan rushed impetuously to Yang Ji, holding a pill in his hand, his eyes crinkling with a childlike smile.

Yang Ji had already opened his eyes when he heard the shout, and at this moment, he also congratulated with a smile, "Congratulations, congratulations! From now on, the world gains another Peak Alchemist in you, Huo Yuan."

"My ability to reach this stage is entirely due to Master's guidance. Please accept this bow from your humble Huo Yuan!" Old Daoist Huo Yuan bowed deeply to Yang Ji, his expression unusually respectful.
At this moment, he truly understood the terrifying nature of the man before him; his seemingly crude alchemy techniques had, in fact, simplified complexity.

As Huo Yuan reached the rank of Peak Alchemist, he immediately became the chief alchemist of the Ten Thousand Treasures Pavilion.
Suddenly, the entire Southwind Island learned of Huo Yuan's breakthrough, and for a time, numerous congratulatory gifts were sent.
Everyone assumed the pure pills refined by Yang Ji were Huo Yuan's creations, and for a while, Huo Yuan's prestige was unrivaled.
Yang Ji was also content with this.

At this moment, in the back mountain.
A pile of items lay before Yang Ji, all congratulatory gifts from various cultivators to Huo Yuan, which Huo Yuan had brought before Yang Ji.

"Master, all these treasures are my tribute to you," Huo Yuan said with a chuckle, essentially presenting borrowed flowers to Buddha.
Yang Ji smiled as he glanced at the gifts, a hint of surprise in his eyes. Some of the gifts were quite valuable, worth several thousand spirit stones.
At this moment, he was indirectly enjoying the hidden benefits that an alchemist should possess.

His gaze slowly swept over them, seeing magic tools, spirit herbs, pill formulas, alchemy cauldrons, and more.
Yang Ji smiled faintly and, without ceremony, accepted them all.
