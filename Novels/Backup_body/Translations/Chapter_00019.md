# Chapter 19: Twelve Cuts with One Sword—Helping Elder Chen Die with Dignity!

Bailing Prefecture, Dalao City.

"Elder Chen, the county magistrate invites you to a banquet tonight."

The young attendant bowed respectfully, his eyes filled with reverence.

It was said that this Elder Chen was originally an outer sect deacon of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. Recently, he had violated sect rules and was demoted here, though he had yet to be officially appointed to any position.

However, he was still a cultivator who had achieved internal energy—a rare feat in Dalao City.

Rumors had it that the prefect of Bailing Prefecture had already petitioned the capital to grant Elder Chen an official post, which would likely be approved within a month.

But the petition to the capital was merely a formality, a gesture of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's basic respect for the Great Zhou Dynasty!

"Understood."

Chen Youyu sat in his room, his expression haughty and his tone indifferent.

The young attendant bowed and withdrew, already scheming how to curry favor with this former outer sect deacon. Perhaps he could use the elder's connections to return to the sect.

Years ago, he had spent five years as a menial disciple in the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. When it came time for promotion to the outer sect, he was rejected by the examining deacon and thus lost his chance at immortality.

In the end, he had no choice but to take the "Basic External Refinement Technique" granted by the sect and leave in tears, becoming a mere attendant here.

Now, his only hope was the medicinal bath materials the sect bestowed every five years, which could slightly advance his external refinement cultivation.

And he had heard that within the sect, outer sect disciples received three to five portions of such materials every month!

"Hopeless trash!"

Chen Youyu watched the attendant's retreating back and shook his head. In his opinion, the young man's aptitude wasn't terrible—if he had been more tactful back then, he would have already entered the outer sect. How could he have fallen to such a state?

This train of thought reminded him of another "tactful" menial disciple from years past.

That disciple, while cleaning the courtyard of a deceased elder, had fished an overlooked spirit stone from a pond.

It was a genuine, graded spirit stone—precious even to inner sect elders!

But the disciple, lacking knowledge, only knew it was valuable without understanding its true worth. In the end, he presented it to Chen Youyu, the outer sect deacon, in exchange for entry into the outer sect.

But then Li Zhengjing arrived with Yuan Zhengfeng's token, bypassing the five-year menial period and directly entering the outer sect, snatching away that very quota.

Left with no choice, Chen Youyu had to silence the menial disciple—but he never forgot his grudge against Li Zhengjing.

"Another year or two, once the dust settles, I'll present this spirit stone to the Grand Elder and surely return to the sect!"

"Damn it! I had planned to serve as an outer sect deacon for ten years, using my merits to exchange for spirit pills to cleanse my body and restore my peak internal energy cultivation."

"At that time, I could have used this spirit stone to exchange for a technique to break through to the 'True Qi' realm!"

"But now I can only use it to buy my way back into the sect!"

"All because of that damned Li Zhengjing! He's cut off my path to further cultivation!"

Chen Youyu seethed with anger, but beneath it lay an unspoken dread.

Li Zhengjing had already achieved internal energy—he would inevitably discover that the organ-nourishing internal energy technique he'd been given was flawed. If this came to light, Chen Youyu was as good as dead!

All he could do was pray that Chen Yang—that father-killing bastard—would truly succeed in eliminating Li Zhengjing!

Lost in thought, he glanced around the luxurious mansion and suddenly muttered, "If my cultivation path is truly severed, perhaps living a life of pleasure in the mortal world—indulging in fine wine, delicacies, and the city's most beautiful men and women—wouldn't be so bad. But as long as Li Zhengjing lives, I'll never swallow this grievance..."

Before he could finish, thick smoke suddenly billowed around him, accompanied by a pungent, choking odor.

"Who's lighting fires out there?"

Chen Youyu cursed and moved to open the door.

It had rained today—someone must have set damp vegetation alight, producing this suffocating smoke!

As he opened the door, white smoke rushed in.

And with the smoke came a flash of cold steel!

Chen Youyu's clouded pupils contracted sharply as he leaped back!

But the tip of the blade still grazed his chest, drawing blood!

"Who dares attack me?!"

Chen Youyu roared in shock and fury, his chest burning with pain. Had he been a fraction slower, that slash would have gutted him!

The only answer was more smoke and a storm of blade lights raining down upon him!

"Five Thunder Mountain-Cleaving Saber Technique!"

"You're from the sect?!"

"Do you know I'm a direct descendant of the Chen clan?!"

Chen Youyu was too stunned to speak, retreating until his back hit a table. Seizing it, he flipped it toward the blade lights.

A flash—the table split in two!

The old man rolled aside, hiding in the smoke-filled corner, gasping for breath.

Now concealed within the smoke, he finally had a moment's respite from the deadly blades.

Only then did Chen Youyu slowly rise, circulating his internal energy throughout his body. His blood surged, his skin turned bluish-purple, and his muscles bulged—he seemed to grow a full foot taller, his frame now imposing and powerful!

"Did Chen Yang send you to silence me?"

Chen Youyu's voice was deep and resonant, like that of a man in his prime.

Then, from within the smoke, came a familiar, hateful voice laced with mockery.

"Chen Youyu, you've grown too complacent after years of safety in the sect. Faced with billowing smoke, you just opened the door without a second thought?"

The voice continued, dripping with scorn, "Did you think the outside world was as safe as the sect? Today, I'm sending you to your grave!"

"It's you!"

Chen Youyu's expression shifted briefly before twisting into a savage grin. "You dare come here to die? I'll oblige you!"

He lunged toward the voice, gathering his internal energy for a Bone-Chilling Heart-Piercing Palm strike!

He was certain this palm strike would reduce Li Zhengjing to pulp!

"You're too young," Chen Youyu sneered. "Daring to speak up in this smoke and reveal your position? Be smarter in your next life!"

His palm shot forward, parting the smoke—only to meet cold steel.

His hand struck the blade's edge.

Half his palm flew off, blood spraying!

"Elder Chen, you've wasted all these years!"

Li Zhengjing reversed his grip and slashed again!

Chen Youyu stumbled back in terror, unable to block!

Li Zhengjing pressed forward, strike after strike, overwhelming the elder completely. "You've coasted on your clan name, lazing about in the sect your whole life—when have you ever faced death? In killing, you're no match for me!"

With a final shout, he brought his saber down hard.

Crack!

Something shattered—Chen Youyu's deacon token.

Suddenly, a blinding light erupted from the smoke, searing Li Zhengjing's eyes!

In that instant, a palm strike knocked his saber aside!

"My experience may pale, but the Chen clan's treasures can crush you!"

Chen Youyu clenched something between his teeth—a radiant object—as he closed in, striking with the Bone-Chilling Heart-Piercing Palm!

His body, swollen with internal energy, loomed over Li Zhengjing, his palm like a giant fan descending toward the young man's head!

With no time to reposition his saber, Li Zhengjing abandoned it and crossed his arms, blocking the strike with his own internal energy!

But Chen Youyu's palm carried bone-numbing cold and crushing force—it felt like holding up an iceberg! Li Zhengjing's knees buckled under the weight.

In that moment, their battle became a pure contest of strength.

"Your internal energy has improved," Chen Youyu growled, pressing down with all his might. "But you've only been at this for half a month—still a novice!"

"I've cultivated internal energy for forty years! Even in my weakened state, I'm beyond your reach!"

"Today, I'll teach you the gap between us with four decades of cultivation!"

With a roar, he channeled all his energy into his palm, the cold intensifying until frost formed!

Li Zhengjing remained calm, though his hands were now covered in ice. Were it not for the tyrannical internal energy from his Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique, he would have frozen solid already!

But even his formidable energy couldn't match Chen Youyu's sheer depth of cultivation.

Just then, a white bird darted through the smoke, seemingly coming to his aid.

"Old Chen, today you die by my hand!"

Li Zhengjing's sudden shout made the bird pause, perching on the windowsill instead.

Chen Youyu laughed mockingly. "With your meager strength? I'll crush you under forty years of cultivation! Let's see you withstand this!"

Li Zhengjing didn't reply, but his eyes gleamed brighter.

The sight of the bird had shown him the way out.

In an instant, he withdrew a portion of his internal energy, focusing it around his chest, throat, and mouth.

Only a wisp remained in his dantian.

A wisp of internal energy couldn't harm anyone.

But a wisp of the Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi could kill!

"Go!"

With a thought, the sword qi shot from his dantian, through his organs, up his throat—

He opened his mouth and exhaled.

The sword qi pierced Chen Youyu's chest.

Its remaining force blasted through the elder's back and the roof tiles beyond!

Chen Youyu's massive body was sent flying, crashing down ten feet away.

"This..." The bird stared in shock. "He has an innate divine ability too? Is he not human?"

"Higher cultivation grants advantage, not certain victory. Many tall men have died to shorter blades!"

Li Zhengjing stood, blood trickling from his nose and mouth. His chest and throat burned as if on fire, his organs wracked with pain—injuries that would cripple any normal internal energy cultivator.

But he still had the Five Elements Creation Balm. His wounds would heal.

"Just one wisp of the Great Profound Void Transformation Sword Qi has such power?"

"No wonder when I tried channeling all my energy into it last night, I felt it would kill me first—its force is overwhelming!"

"But with just a wisp, I can avoid self-harm while catching enemies off guard!"

"This technique injures me every time. It's a last resort."

Wiping the blood from his face, Li Zhengjing picked up his saber and approached.

Chen Youyu's enhanced form had shrunk back to a withered old man, his energy spent, blood pooling around him.

He tried to rise, only to vomit blood and collapse, his eyes wide with disbelief.

He had never imagined losing—let alone to a boy who'd only cultivated internal energy for half a month!

That energy that pierced him—it felt like a technique only True Qi cultivators could wield!

"How... how can you... use such arts?" Chen Youyu gasped.

Li Zhengjing didn't answer, dragging his saber closer.

Chen Youyu scrambled back. "I'm a Chen clan elder! Kill me, and the Enforcement Hall will hunt you down! Spare me, and I'll forget this ever happened!"

He tossed a spirit stone forward. "This is a graded stone—even inner sect elders crave it! Take it and go!"

"I wronged you, but I was just following Chen Yang's orders! He's the one who had us alter your manual!"

"Don't come closer!"

With a sudden burst of strength, Chen Youyu turned to flee through the window.

Whoosh!

Li Zhengjing hurled his saber, impaling the elder through the back.

He strode over, pulled the blade free, and placed a foot on Chen Youyu's head. "Don't worry—they'll all join you soon. Consider this a head start."

"Twelve unjust punishments in six months. Twelve cuts in return. We're old friends—I'll waive the interest."

Looking down, he added calmly, "Don't struggle. I'll leave you whole—for dignity's sake. A few extra holes won't affect your burial."

Another stab. "Deep breaths. Dizziness is normal. It'll be over soon."
