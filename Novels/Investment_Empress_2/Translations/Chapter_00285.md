# Chapter 285: Everyone Worries About the Two’s Offspring (1/2)

In the southern part of the Southern Frontier.

High atop a cliff, a chilling wind blew up from the abyss below, carrying a faint scent of blood that made one’s hair stand on end.

“May the Great Wind God bless us with timely winds and rains in the coming year.”

A group of villagers, led by a shaman, knelt before the temple on the edge of the cliff, bowing their heads in worship.

Inside the temple stood a bronze statue, four feet tall, with a human face and a bird’s body. Its wings were exceptionally large, as if a gentle flap could summon fierce gales.

“Offer the tribute!”

A pair of young boys and girls, carrying flower baskets, were pushed into the Great Wind Temple.

The light immediately dimmed, and the statue was shrouded in shadow.

*Splat—*

Crimson liquid splashed out, its color identical to the blood-red light falling from outside.

Han Zhen walked into the temple and couldn't help but cover his nose. He frowned as he looked at the human-faced monster bird not far away.

“Haven't I long since taught you the method of refining Blood Pills?”

“The taste of flesh and blood is better.”

The human-faced monster bird crunched on a bone, making a grating sound, and revealed a chilling smile.

Han Zhen’s frown deepened. Once a totem of the Great Shang Dynasty, it now indulged in raw flesh and blood with relish.

“The Jade Phoenix God has found a master.”

“Hmm?” The monster bird’s eyes lit up, its feathers bristling with excitement. Fierce winds howled within the temple.

“Is the National Teacher finally going to complete the Divine Tree and awaken the true Phoenix?”

However, Han Zhen’s next words made its expression freeze.

“It has fallen into human hands.”

The monster bird fell into deep thought.

“Humans... were able to compete for the Jade Phoenix God?”

“That woman, although human, possesses a天生 Phoenix Body...” Han Zhen narrowed his eyes.

“Even so, how could she defeat the many God-Children like Zhiduo Luo?”

“She didn't defeat them. She killed them.”

Han Zhen fell silent after saying this.

After a long while, he spoke again.

“This arm of mine was severed by her, and she was not alone...”

Han Zhen recounted everything that had happened in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

Finally, his eyes burned with intensity as he said, “She is a disciple of the Qingyuan Sect. The path she walks now is undoubtedly the path of condensing the forms of a hundred birds.”

“I fear that in a short time, she will be able to gather the Phoenix God on her own. By then, the existence of you all...”

“Will be meaningless!”

The monster bird’s blood-red pupils contracted.

“She must not be allowed to leave the Southern Frontier with the Jade Phoenix God.” With these words, the monster bird flapped its wings and transformed into a gust of fierce wind, flying toward the horizon.

***

Suspended Monastery.

Within the Water Clan’s Cavern Heaven, the kings and great demons of various clans gathered together, an unprecedented sight filled with warmth and enthusiasm.

In recent days, every clan had experienced the benefits of the Divine Jade from beyond the heavens.

But gratitude was only part of it.

More importantly, these two young demons, one with the bloodline of a true dragon and the other a true phoenix, both wielding the Divine Jade, had a great future ahead of them and could very well become the leaders of the Southern Frontier’s demon clans.

At this moment, all the demons surrounded Li Mo and Ying Bing.

To be more precise, they surrounded Tianjiao Xiao Li. Ying Bing, expressionless and cold, sat there drinking tea. The demons glanced at her a few times but didn’t dare to get close.

“I will discipline my clan upon returning. I will strictly forbid them from relieving themselves upstream, which affects the living environment of the local water clans.”

“The Great Peng Clan will share the Golden Peng weather phenomena, providing everyone with accurate weather forecasts!”

“Our Purple Electric鳃 Eel Clan... uh, we’ll try not to乱放 electricity in the future.”

The Demon Kings were united in purpose, their enthusiasm running high, their demon hearts burning bright.

Tianjiao Xiao Li looked on with satisfaction, feeling he should say a few words as well.

“Wherever there is a lack of rain, you can also come to the Ming Jiao Clan. We will summon Jiao based on the required precipitation.”

“The Southern Frontier is our home. A beautiful home depends on everyone’s efforts!”

Hearing this, the demons applauded loudly.

In fact, aside from the Calamity Beasts, most demons of the Southern Frontier do not enjoy conflict.

After they return, the Southern Frontier will likely... become more peaceful?

Although many problems cannot be solved immediately, this is a good start.

---

“Doesn't the Guardian King of the South owe me a Civilization Award?”

Xiao Li’s lips curled upwards.

This should count as an investment, right?

After a light cough, Li Mo asked seriously, “Does anyone have any other good suggestions or questions?”

“I do!”

Manbo raised his hand.

“Please speak.”

“I suggest that the Peerless Tianjiao and the Qingluan Goddess have a child soon!”

*Pfft...*

Li Mo was stunned for a moment, spitting out the tea he had just sipped.

“That’s right! The bloodlines of a true dragon and a true phoenix are so powerful separately. If they were to have offspring...”

“Seriously, you have to admit it. The fact that they can jointly wield the Divine Jade means the Jade itself acknowledges them.”

*Gasp... That makes sense!*

“Are they... a good match?”

“The Divine Jade has no objections. What right does a monster like you have to oppose?”

The demons exchanged glances, their eyes filled with wisdom and contemplation.

If true dragons and true phoenixes are already this powerful, wouldn't their offspring be even more heaven-defying?

Li Mo: “.....”

Xiao Li never dreamed that he would experience the pressure of being urged to have children before even being urged to marry.

And it was from a group of demons.

He glanced at the ice sculpture, but saw the young girl was still quietly drinking tea. However, her curled fingers betrayed her...

“So, everyone, are you leaving now?”

Tianjiao Xiao Li forcibly said his goodbyes.

But as the Demon Kings left, they were still discussing it enthusiastically.

“Given time, with the true dragon and true phoenix working together, the Great Yu is nothing to fear!”

“Our demon clans should unite, grow stronger, and create another glorious era!”

“Do you think the bloodline of a true dragon and a true phoenix would be called a Phoenix Dragon or a Dragon Phoenix?”

Urging them to have children seems to be a demon tradition as well.

Probably because demon clans with powerful bloodlines find it difficult to bear offspring?

Uncle Mu’s value continues to rise...

“Brother Li.”

Before Li Mo could return to pack his things, Murong Xiao called out to him. He now had a tonsure mark on his head, so it seemed he had officially become a member of the Suspended Monastery.

“I will be leaving the Southern Frontier with the Suspended Monastery.”

“I didn’t expect this layer of things back then,” Li Mo said, feeling a bit embarrassed.

He had originally thought that with Murong Xiao in the Southern Frontier, he could meet his parents more often. Who would have thought the Suspended Monastery would be moving?

“As long as there is fate, the Suspended Monastery is everywhere.”

Li Mo looked at him, amused. “You haven’t recited many sutras, but you’re already talking like a monk.”

Murong Xiao gave an embarrassed smile. “My master said the Suspated Monastery flies around. Maybe one day we’ll get lucky and run into each other.”

After speaking, he became serious again and lowered his voice.

“Brother Li, when you return to the Qingyuan Sect from the Southern Frontier, you must be extra careful. With the Abbot gone, who knows what chaos might arise in the Southern Frontier.”

“Take this. It was given to me by my master. No matter when or where you are, you can instantly return to the monastery.”

He took out a string of prayer beads. There was a fluctuation similar to a spatial artifact on them, but not exactly the same.

“This was given to you by Master Hengyuan. Will you be reprimanded for giving it to me?”

“I will, but it’s fine. My master can’t scold me anyway.”

“.....”

Li Mo looked at Murong Xiao’s solemn expression, fell silent for a moment, and still accepted it.

“Who knows when we’ll meet again.”

“I have a scroll of sutra that I can’t understand, so I’ll give it to you.”

He took out a scroll of scripture from his sleeve.

*The Sutra of the Past Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, Part One*
