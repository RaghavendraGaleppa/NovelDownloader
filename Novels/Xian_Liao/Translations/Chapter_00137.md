# Chapter 137: Seclusion and Breakthrough

Shang Zijian escorted Zhou Qing back to Luopoling before returning himself, demonstrating utmost courtesy. He also mentioned Zhou Qing's participation in the Tianxuan City market, a suggestion made by Jin Guang.

Zhou Qing delegated these matters to Fu Song for coordination. He had already handed over the contents of the Eight Trigrams Immortal Thunder Formation to Yuan Mingyue for research. With no other pressing matters, he began refining the remaining Geng Metal while simultaneously using his divine sense to melt the essence of the Life-Severing Blade and fuse it into the Green Bamboo Sword.

As the Green Bamboo Sword absorbed the essence of the Life-Severing Blade, it underwent continuous transformation, its material becoming increasingly harder. Being Zhou Qing's life-bound magical artifact, the sword was intrinsically connected to his spirit. During breaks from practicing Lung Metal Thunder, Zhou Qing further refined the sword, ensuring thorough integration with the Life-Severing Blade's essence. With the Tianxuan Patriarch having assisted in refining the Life-Severing Blade, Zhou Qing had no concerns about hidden dangers.

Zhou Qing also meticulously engraved intricate formation patterns onto the Green Bamboo Sword. Fully immersed in enhancing his life-bound artifact and cultivating Lung Metal Thunder, he paid no attention to external affairs. This process helped him ignore the pain associated with practicing Lung Metal Thunder.

During this time, bizarre illusions emerged in Zhou Qing's mind. "Inner demons? Or extraterrestrial demons?" These illusions failed to disturb him. Having watched science fiction films about the Big Bang in his previous life, these visions seemed trivial.

Unconsciously, Zhou Qing entered a deep meditative state, and his divine sense underwent another critical breakthrough. Over this period, he digested the combat experience gained during the beast tide and fully activated the remaining effects of the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir. His divine sense, being his natural talent, was the first to achieve a new breakthrough.

Now, his divine sense was fifty percent stronger than that of Jin Guang, a veteran Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivator. "Not enough yet," Zhou Qing thought. He knew there was still a gap between his current divine sense and that of an Early Core Formation cultivator, so he remained humble. However, the enhancement of his divine sense brought tangible benefits: the Green Bamboo Sword's fusion with the Life-Severing Blade's essence accelerated, as did his cultivation of Lung Metal Thunder.

With stronger divine sense, Zhou Qing gained better control and perception of his body. Additionally, the Life Nurturing Scripture provided more detailed feedback about his condition. Furthermore, his mana circulation became smoother and faster, and the effects of the Pure Yang Heart Method in refining his mana became more pronounced. Zhou Qing's mana continued to purify.

Given that his physical body was stronger than that of a late-stage Crucible cultivator, the amount of mana his Dao Crucible could ultimately contain was truly formidable.

"If my mana increases to the limit my body can hold, it might compare to Core Formation-level power," Zhou Qing mused.

Two years passed in the blink of an eye, and Zhou Qing finally finished refining all the Geng Metal he had. Observing the Life Nurturing Scripture, he saw that his Lung Metal Thunder had reached the "Proficient" level, not far from "Mastery." "With a bit more Geng Metal, I can definitely complete Lung Metal Thunder," he thought.

Zhou Qing wasn't in a hurry. Tianxuan City was already helping him search for Geng Metal. If even Tianxuan City couldn't find it, his own efforts would be even more futile. Besides, even without Geng Metal, he could still complete Lung Metal Thunder with more time—it was only a matter of when. Zhou Qing felt no anxiety or impatience.

Taking advantage of his divine sense breakthrough, he visited the Jiangzhou Herb Garden. Listening to Lin Wan'er play the "Earthly Melody" from the Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture, the music flowed gently into his heart. Under the influence of the scripture, her music carried a unique spiritual resonance that moved him deeply. Zhou Qing's mind grew even calmer.

The Great Mulberry Tree swayed nearby, its branches casting elegant shadows. The parts Zhou Qing had pruned earlier were now thriving. Seeing this, Zhou Qing felt immensely gratified. The tree really owed him thanks—though its excessive growth might attract heavenly lightning prematurely. Zhou Qing's fingers itched to prune it again. He truly worried endlessly for his "family."

During his leisure time, Zhou Qing summoned Butcher Hu. He handed him a bottle of Profound Yang Black Tiger's essence blood. "Brother Hu, this is essence blood from a late-stage Foundation Establishment demon tiger. Refine and consume it slowly to transform your physique using the Tiger Roar Life-Severing Scripture."

This level of demon beast essence blood was more than enough to help break through to the Crucible Realm. However, Butcher Hu had started cultivating late in life, so the effects were uncertain. Still, it would undoubtedly be beneficial. Refining the essence blood would test his willpower. If Butcher Hu could endure this trial, it would lay a solid foundation for his future demon-seeding.

Zhou Qing and Butcher Hu had met in humble circumstances. Since Butcher Hu was determined to pursue higher realms rather than enjoy worldly riches in the mortal domain, Zhou Qing was willing to give him the opportunity. Zhou Qing wasn't a sage, but he wished for those around him to thrive. If one day he reached a sufficiently high cultivation level, he even hoped to return to his previous life's world—though by then, everything would likely have changed.

He recalled an ancient poem:  
*"There once was a bird named Ding Lingwei,  
Who left home for a thousand years before returning.  
The city walls remained, but the people were no more—  
Why not learn immortality and leave graves behind?"*  

The poem told of Ding Lingwei, a mythical figure who returned home after a thousand years of cultivating immortality, only to find the city unchanged but its people gone, with graves everywhere. This cautionary tale about the sorrows of cultivation made Zhou Qing wary. The thought helped calm his mind—he could enjoy the pleasures of cultivation without becoming addicted.

Unnoticed, the beast tide season approached again. By then, Zhou Qing's Spleen Earth Thunder had reached "Mastery," and he prepared to cultivate the Supreme Unity Primal Chaos Divine Light. This time, the beast tide was much smaller, with few Foundation Establishment-level demon beasts appearing. It seemed the demon race was deliberately controlling the scale.

Thus, Zhou Qing didn't need to intervene. He focused on cultivating the Supreme Unity Primal Chaos Divine Light, preparing to unify the five elements and break through to the Dao Crucible. He also gained a clearer understanding of the realms beyond the Dao Crucible.

Zhou Qing had requested to borrow Patriarch Jingyang's cultivation insights. Although the Tianxuan Patriarch advised against exposing himself to high-level cultivation experiences to avoid mental barriers, Zhou Qing insisted. The Patriarch didn't stop him—every cultivator had their own path. Zhou Qing's willingness to challenge the Patriarch's advice reflected his confidence and independence.

Through Jingyang's notes and the principles revealed by the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir, Zhou Qing discerned the realms beyond the Eight Trigrams Dao Crucible. The Dao Crucible differed from Jingyang's Yin-Yang Treasure Vase, and Zhou Qing couldn't simply replicate Jingyang's path. Instead, he found his own way: the Nine Revolutions Golden Core.

In the White Moon Wolf Clan's sacred grounds, the Greed Wolf Holy Son spoke to an elderly man with white hair: "Elder, during the next beast tide, I will personally slay that human cultivator to wash away our shame."

Behind the old man stood a massive divine pillar, its surface covered in chains formed from mystical runes. Inscribed on the pillar were the words:  
*"Jingyang imprisoned Howling Moon here."*  

Howling Moon was the White Moon Wolf Clan's ancestral patriarch—a ninth-rank demon beast at the Nascent Soul stage, a true peerless demon. It turned out Jingyang had not only forced Howling Moon to swear not to attack humans but had also imprisoned him in the wolf clan's sacred grounds before disappearing.

Shang Zijian said, "Master instructed that Tianxuan City should accommodate Daoist Qingling's requests as much as possible. Feel free to make any requests."

Zhou Qing replied, "I need a map of regions rich in earth-attribute spiritual materials." He didn't plan to ask Shang Zijian to help find the Glossy Ganoderma—firstly, because the fungus could earth-glide, making it hard to capture without late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, and secondly, because Zhou Qing intended to tame the Earth Armored Dragon.

With his current divine sense, Zhou Qing could control the Earth Armored Dragon as easily as he did Little Snake, even using its perspective to explore mountainous areas. He could also send out Rooster to compensate for the dragon's lack of offensive power. As for Zhou Qing himself, he would stay safely in his water abode, avoiding any risk of Core Formation demons ambushing him far from Tianxuan City.

The beast tide was no longer a crisis but an opportunity to gain experience. Shang Zijian happened to have a suitable map. After receiving it, Zhou Qing used his powerful divine sense to fully tame the Earth Armored Dragon.

Like Little Snake, Zhou Qing left a portion of his divine sense in the Earth Armored Dragon. The creature was lazy and gluttonous, living comfortably in Luopoling. Even without Zhou Qing's coercion, it showed little desire to leave. Zhou Qing tamed it effortlessly—unlike any other demon beast he'd encountered. During their previous encounter, the dragon had mostly resisted by enduring hits or trying to flee.

As a late-stage Foundation Establishment demon with considerable intelligence, the Earth Armored Dragon had bonded with Fu Song over their shared indolence. Under Zhou Qing's orders, it reluctantly followed Rooster into the mountains to search for Glossy Ganoderma—within a three-hundred-li radius of Luopoling.

Rooster was thrilled to be let loose. Without Zhou Qing's divine sense urging it on, the Earth Armored Dragon would slack off after a few li. Though it loved Glossy Ganoderma, in Luopoling, Fu Song and others fed it regularly, eliminating the need to forage. After a lifetime of hardship as a demon beast, this carefree existence was paradise—though it still feared Zhou Qing too much to disobey.

The Earth Armored Dragon's sense of smell was extraordinarily sharp, capable of detecting earth-attribute spiritual materials dozens of li away. When lesser demon beasts crossed their path, Rooster incinerated them with Solar True Fire, providing the dragon with roasted snacks. Rooster had learned some cooking techniques from Zhou Qing, though without seasonings, the taste was mediocre.

Through the Earth Armored Dragon's eyes, Zhou Qing experienced the demon beasts' perspective—unfettered freedom in nature, unconcerned with life and death. For most demon beasts, survival was paramount after gaining sentience; as long as they lived, they could grow stronger. Only at the Core Formation stage could they escape the constant threat of death.

For low-level demon beasts, Foundation Establishment-level demons were more terrifying than human cultivators. Only sixth-rank Core Formation demons were recognized as true members of the demon race. Below that, unless they belonged to special clans like the White Moon Wolves, ordinary demon beasts were merely food for their stronger kin. However, human cultivators remained the ultimate delicacy in the eyes of demons.

Within days, the Earth Armored Dragon retrieved a Glossy Ganoderma. Naturally adept at earth-gliding, the fungus hid deep in forests, making it nearly impossible to catch—except for the Earth Armored Dragon, its natural predator. The Ganoderma could regenerate after having parts cut off, surviving for long periods despite its lack of offensive capabilities. As a spiritual herb, it was subpar—only the Earth Vessel Cauldron allowed Zhou Qing to refine it into Primordial Mother Qi.

Given its regenerative properties, Zhou Qing could cultivate the Ganoderma using other earth-attribute materials. Typically, only one Ganoderma existed within several hundred li, so Zhou Qing didn't seek another. Instead, he had the Earth Armored Dragon gather ordinary earth-attribute materials to feed it.

Using Green Sun Spirit Fire, Zhou Qing refined the Ganoderma slices cut by the Green Bamboo Sword, gradually producing Primordial Mother Qi. Compared to the torment of practicing Lung Metal Thunder, cultivating Spleen Earth Thunder was pure bliss. The Primordial Mother Qi's abundant vitality entered his body, harmonizing the excessive sharpness of Lung Metal Qi that had caused minor imbalances in his physique.

As Zhou Qing alternated between cutting the Ganoderma and replenishing it with earth-attribute materials, Primordial Mother Qi continuously generated within the Earth Vessel Cauldron. Never had his Five Organs Thunder cultivation proceeded so smoothly—it was sheer delight.

But over time, Zhou Qing realized he needed to guard against becoming intoxicated by this ease. The cautionary thought steadied his mind, allowing him to enjoy the process without losing himself. Before he knew it, the beast tide season neared again, and his Spleen Earth Thunder reached "Mastery." He prepared to cultivate the Supreme Unity Primal Chaos Divine Light.

This time, the beast tide was significantly smaller, with few Foundation Establishment-level demons appearing—likely a deliberate reduction by the demon race. Thus, Zhou Qing didn't need to intervene, focusing instead on unifying the five elements to break through to the Dao Crucible. Through Jingyang's insights and the Jade Liquid Returned Elixir, he had outlined the path beyond the Dao Crucible: the Nine Revolutions Golden Core.
