## Chapter 117: Divine Host Body

"Why did you let Princess Lingyu leave with those two men!"

Zhou Tian and Mu Su were eating the food prepared for them – or more accurately, Zhou Tian was, as his mouth was greasy with oil. Mu Su, on the other hand, just watched. Perhaps due to being overly influenced by the Holy God Cult, he subconsciously harbored a bad impression of the Spider Cult, and thus had many reservations.

A sound of argument drifted from the idol. Zhou Tian and Mu Su exchanged glances; it seemed there was a show to watch. They quickly put down their food and headed towards the source of the sound.

Upon reaching the idol, they found almost all the followers gathered there.

"She is my daughter!" Isha's face was grim, her voice low and suppressing anger.

"She's not just your daughter, but also... Aren't you afraid of the Spider Goddess's wrath?" The person arguing with Isha was unknown. Their words were unclear and vague, as if hiding something.

"Are you questioning me? I am the High Priest!" Isha coldly rebuked, exuding a queen-like aura. Whether it was an illusion or not, Zhou Tian felt as if the idol itself was casting its gaze downwards.

The woman arguing with Isha snorted coldly. Feeling the thick authority enveloping her, her expression turned extremely ugly. "I hope you don't doom us all!"

"I know what I'm doing. The Spider Goddess will watch over me." Isha's eyes flickered, a strong killing intent brewing, but after much thought, she decided against it, as if she had some reservations.

"It seems Lingyu has some secret," Mu Su said in a low voice, standing with his sword held.

Zhou Tian's eyes glinted. This Spider Cult was truly interesting. He also heard it; Lingyu harbored something, and perhaps this was what prompted Isha to seek their cooperation. The woman opposing Isha gave them a sinister glance. Isha and she had naturally noticed their arrival long ago.

"Everyone, disperse!" Isha commanded, and the many followers scattered. Isha then walked towards Zhou Tian.

"My apologies for letting you witness such a scene."

"It's alright. Can we leave now?" Zhou Tian said indifferently.

"Of course. Lingyu is waiting for you." Isha nodded, her face showing no unusual expression when mentioning Lingyu, as if the recent incident hadn't happened at all.

"Alright." Zhou Tian didn't inquire about the specific situation. Zhou Tian and his two companions then departed from the place, with Lingyu following them.

Not long after they left, Isha stood before the idol for a long time, extending her jade hand and murmuring softly. The Spider Goddess's idol emitted bursts of light, sounds of praise rose, and the idol gradually shrunk until it was palm-sized, resting in her hand. She then instructed her followers to also leave the area.

...

"Speak. What other special identity do you possess?" The sound of footsteps on dry branches was particularly crisp in the silent forest. Zhou Tian spoke, questioning Lingyu, who had been quiet ever since they left.

"..." Lingyu glanced at him but didn't speak.

Zhou Tian wasn't angry. He chuckled and said, "That was your base. How could we have heard such a huge secret, even involving the Spider Goddess, without certain people's permission? Tell me, your mother must have instructed you, right?"

Lingyu looked at Zhou Tian in surprise, as if she hadn't expected this lunatic to be so clever. After pondering for a moment, she spoke, "I am the vessel chosen by the Spider Goddess for her descent."

"What?" It wasn't Zhou Tian who spoke, but Mu Su. His face was filled with surprise. He understood very well how precious a divine vessel was.

"Then why would your mother let you follow us? What if you..." Divine vessels are not easy to find. A deity's strongest combat power lies within their domain of faith, their Divine Kingdom. However, in the current God-Forsaken Land, followers are extremely scarce. If a deity's true form were to descend, their power would be very limited, and they themselves would be in immense danger. Thus, they must descend upon another. Furthermore, a host body for a deity's descent is incredibly difficult to find, requiring numerous conditions to be met.

"I don't know either. Mother just told me to follow you, and then instructed me that there's no need to hide certain secrets; if you ask, I should just answer honestly," Lingyu's cherry lips parted slightly as she spoke slowly.

Zhou Tian then thoughtfully asked, "After the deity descends, will your own soul cease to exist?"

"That's right. A deity's consciousness is incredibly powerful; even an avatar is more than I can bear. The moment it descends, my soul will vanish," Lingyu said with a desolate expression. After all, she was just a girl, and due to her mother's influence, she didn't have a strong faith in the Spider Goddess. Therefore, she was quite resistant to becoming a divine host, feeling no honor in it.

It seems Isha is determined to rebel against the Spider Cult and even wants to kill the Spider Goddess. Zhou Tian secretly surmised that revealing this information through Lingyu was Isha's way of expressing her resolve. He wondered how the Spider Goddess had offended her, for Isha, as the High Priest, to go to such lengths. With this current doubt resolved, Zhou Tian felt much more at ease. Although he believed that Lingyu being chosen as a divine host wasn't the sole underlying reason, considering Isha had reached the rank of High Priest, it was unlikely she had never believed in the Spider Goddess at all. Although Isha knew he was an 'outsider' and of no low status, it seemed she was unaware that Zhou Tian himself couldn't currently contact his own people and thus couldn't provide her with immediate assistance.

"Don't worry," Zhou Tian comforted Lingyu. "See this little brother of yours? When the time comes, he'll definitely flip the Spider Goddess onto the ground and save you from your plight."

Mu Su and Lingyu both had black lines over their heads. Why did that sound so strange?

He opened his 'unimpressive' system to check the time and found that it was almost time for the next refresh. Zhou Tian had spent quite a bit of time at the Spider Cult. Just as he was about to take off his clothes, he remembered that it wasn't just two men now, but also a woman. He secretly sighed; having an extra woman around was troublesome.

"Miss Lingyu, would you mind turning around?"

"Why?" Lingyu's face showed a strange expression.

"Because I'm going to take off my clothes."

"..." Lingyu didn't know what to say. Was there something wrong with this person's brain? Why take off clothes for no reason? Seeing Zhou Tian already starting to take off his pants, she quickly turned around.

A moment later, Mu Su's voice came, "He's gone. You can turn back now."

Lingyu cautiously turned around, afraid of seeing a big bare backside. "What's wrong with him?" Lingyu asked speechlessly, even looking at Mu Su with a changed expression. Having spent so much time with such a pervert, surely he hadn't become one too?
