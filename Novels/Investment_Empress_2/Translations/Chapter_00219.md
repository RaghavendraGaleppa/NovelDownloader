# Chapter 219: Warning, Best Actor Golden Statue Award!

“Have you heard? Li Mo has become the top patron of our Drizzle Pavilion.”

“You mean that wealthy tycoon who directly deposited a mountain of gold and various treasures at the Hengtong Mercantile House to put a bounty on the head of the one who accepted the contract to kill him?”

“Exactly! Yesterday, an assassin from out of town, an Inner Scene realm expert, accepted Li Mo’s bounty early on. He didn't know about Li Mo’s situation. Guess what happened?”

“What?”

*Tsk tsk.* “The moment he stepped out with his weapon, he realized he’d been poisoned. Then, over a dozen colleagues swarmed him. The scene... oh, the scene...”

*Gasp...* “I have a friend who also accepted the bounty to kill Li Mo...”

“By ‘friend,’ you wouldn't mean yourself, would you?”

.......

For a time.

Yunzhou was in a state of alarm, and the Drizzle Pavilion was in utter chaos.

Not far from the painted boat, in a secluded private manor.

From a room nearby, the aura of a soul fluctuated, and the faint sound of a celestial maiden singing drifted in with the wind.

The Saintess was cultivating inside.

The madam waited at the gate of the courtyard, vigilant against all directions, appearing extremely tense.

The few people around her were the same.

Suddenly, a disheveled figure tumbled into the courtyard. He wore night-clothes, was covered in injuries, and his face was a dark, greenish-black color—he was clearly afflicted with a potent poison.

The madam recognized this man.

He was also a God-Viewing realm assassin, one of the direct subordinates brought over from other provinces by Yin Mianmian.

“Save... save me...”

The assassin’s breath was weak, his face filled with despair.

Just like many of the targets he had once killed.

However, seeing someone pleading for help from the Saintess’s people, the madam dared not move a muscle, her gaze fixed gravely on the darkness not far behind the man.

“Huapi, you seem to be enjoying quite a leisurely life here. It seems you’ve received quite a few rewards after following the Saintess?”

A man shrouded in a black robe walked out of the shadows.

“Gui Ying, the Saintess is cultivating in seclusion inside. No one is permitted to disturb her.”

The madam tucked one hand into her sleeve, her body tense.

Seeing that the man remained noncommittal, she added:

“The bounty on Li Mo was posted by the Saintess. Yet you are obstructing us in every way, causing heavy losses to the Pavilion’s manpower. Don’t tell me the Yunzhou Branch intends to break away from the Main Pavilion?!”

“There is a bounty, and we take the money to do the job.”

“Is the Drizzle Pavilion now ruled by the Saintess instead of the Pavilion Master?”

The man in the black robe let out a cold laugh.

*Whoosh!*

A black light flashed. Only someone with exceptional eyesight could see it was a fan made of a special metal alloy.

Blood splattered. The assassin on the ground, who was on the verge of death, was sliced in two by the vicious fan. Dark red blood flowed across the ground.

The madam’s expression changed slightly.

When she looked up again, the man in the black robe had vanished. Only his voice drifted in with the wind:

“The Branch Master has sent a message.”

“The Saintess is still young, her wings not yet fully grown, and her actions lack foresight.”

“This piece of land in Yunzhou does not belong to the surname Yin yet!”

The madam’s expression shifted several times.

The corpse on the ground combined with those words was a naked warning.

Not long after.

Footsteps sounded from behind, and she quickly turned around to pay her respects.

“You... have reached the ninth level of the God-Viewing realm?”

Yin Mianmian did not answer.

She still wore a smile on her face, but the killing intent churning in her eyes was impossible to conceal.

She had indeed used the impending storm to plant her own people in Yunzhou.

She never expected the Branch Master of Yunzhou to react so quickly.

She also never expected Li Mo to be able to come up with such a huge sum of money, giving the Branch Master an excuse to eliminate dissent.

“For now, the only way is for Li Mo to die. Only then will the bounty he posted come to an end.”

“But we don’t have many people we can use left,” the madam whispered beside her.

“Heh, I cannot return to the Main Pavilion with my tail between my legs.”

Yin Mianmian’s eyes flashed, as if she had made a decision.

“Help me disguise myself.”

“Ah? You... are going personally?”

.........

Meanwhile.

By the Yulong Lake.

“Big Brother Li, it’s so lively.”

Jiang Chulong, carrying a small basket of vegetables, hid somewhat timidly behind Li Mo.

“Don’t be afraid. These are all our own people.”

Li Mo smiled and patted her head.

The area was originally bustling, but over the past two days, many more stalls had popped up, selling candied hawthorns, and performing acrobatics.

It is worth mentioning that the performers here had changed.

Now, acts like the Iron Crotch Skill, smashing steel plates on the chest, handstand hair washing, and biting fire starters... had been kicked out of the “hardcore” category.

The real hardcore acts included bathing in a pool of poisonous insects, and blindfolded darts where every dart hit the navel...

There was no choice; the street’s performance industry had suddenly become highly competitive. The original group couldn’t keep up even if they risked their lives.

---

When passing by, he would even stop to broaden his horizons.

“Greetings, Master Li.”

“Hehe, to be honest, before I joined this line of work, I specialized in making sweet soups. Would you like a bowl?”

“Polite, very polite.”

“You are now our衣食父母 (bread and butter)...”

Taking the sweet soup, Li Mo took a sip before handing it to the little Princess Jiang, who was looking on eagerly.

As they reached the entrance of a restaurant, a commotion suddenly broke out nearby.

“Something’s wrong, why is that person acting so sneaky?”

“Could he be here to assassinate Young Hero Li?”

“Grab him, interrogate him thoroughly!”

“Big bro... I was just trying to steal some money...”

A group of burly figures surrounded him. The thief trembled, suspecting he had violated some heavenly law.

Looking at the lively and prosperous scene outside, Li Mo couldn’t help but feel a sense of emotion.

Because of him, Yulong Street was even more bustling and prosperous than before.

The public security environment had risen in a straight line.

“If the Governor of Yunzhou knew, he really should give me a Good Citizen Award,” Li Mo remarked with emotion.

“Good Citizen Award... what is that?” Little Princess Jiang looked up and asked.

“It means... well, it’s a form of praise, complimenting you for being a kind and good person.”

“Then... can I... give Big Brother Li... an award?”

Little Princess Jiang felt that Big Brother Li completely met the criteria.

Was the Governor of Yunzhou blind? Why hadn’t he come to praise Big Brother Li yet?

“Haha, then I would be truly honored.”

Li Mo looked flattered.

The two had just entered when he saw everyone from the Qingyuan Sect in the main hall.

Senior Brother Xiao Bao came over and asked:

“What award? Do I have one?”

“Hehe, Junior Brother Li, the other day at the Drizzle Pavilion, my acting was pretty good, right?”

Li Mo thought for a moment.

He figured it was indeed a bother that everyone had helped him, and he should express his gratitude to them.

The assassins who helped him had bounties, so how could he treat his own people poorly?

But handing out benefits to everyone one by one, they might not accept them...

Li Mo’s mind raced for a moment, and suddenly he had an idea.

“Ahem! I think we should hold a banquet.”

“Huh? A banquet?”

Shang Wu narrowed her eyes, suddenly interested.

Xue Jing shook his head and said:

“Little Mo, this matter isn’t over yet. There’s no need to celebrate now.”

“It’s not a victory banquet.”

Li Mo walked over to the Ice Cube, who was drinking tea.

He casually picked up the chibi wooden figure of Little Li by her hand and held it to his mouth like a microphone.

“...”

Ying Bing frowned slightly.

Realizing it was him who had picked up the wooden carving, her jade-like expression turned calm again.

He should be...

That childish streak deep in his bones acting up again, about to do something nonsensical.

“Considering everyone’s performance last time at the Black Pavilion.”

“Life is like a play; it relies entirely on acting skills!”

Li Mo coughed twice, his gaze sweeping over everyone.

“So, I think it’s time to start an acting evaluation.”

“I announce, the first Qingyuan Sect Best Actor Golden Statue Award Ceremony, is now officially begun.”

“This ceremony will announce the Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Actress... and many other major awards!”

Little Li, as the host, was quite capable of driving the atmosphere.

Unfortunately, the others couldn’t catch his vibe and didn’t quite understand what he was talking about.

So, for a moment, the response was lukewarm.

“Tch, boring.”

“I still need to refine pills.”

“I need to go finish my manuscript...”

Everyone was uninterested.

Only the Ice Cube remained seated.

She appeared expressionless.

In reality, she pursed her lips, which were like shattered jade, and subtly tidied up a stray, mischievous lock of hair at her temple...

Best... Actress?
