# Chapter 19: Spirit Seeds  

Coming from a rural background, Gu Mo was quite familiar with farming. With physical strength and spiritual power three times that of an average Qi Refining cultivator, tending to this one-acre spirit field posed no problem for him.  

"After tilling the spirit field, it needs to be nourished with the Minor Cloud-Rain Technique." Gu Mo took out the manual issued by the Spirit Plant Hall, which contained insights on cultivating spirit fields. His farming knowledge might not fully apply to the spirit fields of the cultivation world, so consulting the manual was essential.  

"Minor Cloud-Rain Technique, huh."  

Putting away the manual, Gu Mo stood at the edge of the field and formed hand seals. Instantly, a dark cloud gathered above the field. Since no one was around, there was no need to hold back—he went all out.  

*Pitter-patter!*  

Within moments, a light drizzle of spiritual rain moistened the field, and the ambient spiritual energy grew denser.  

Spirit fields were naturally more saturated with spiritual energy than the outside world, as they were connected to spiritual veins. Moreover, Gu Mo's field was a mid-grade tier-1 spirit field, surpassing the spiritual concentration of low-grade tier-1 fields.  

Unfortunately, this spiritual energy was locked beneath the field by formations, making it difficult for cultivators to absorb. However, spirit plants could draw it up through their roots.  

Gu Mo didn’t mind. His cultivation didn’t rely on spiritual energy—he depended on solar essence.  

But since the field was still empty, he couldn’t plant his Sunflower yet. A lone Sunflower in the middle of the field would be too conspicuous.  

Once he had the funds, he planned to set up defensive formations around the field for added security.  

After mapping out his plans, Gu Mo returned to his small artifact house to cultivate—not to improve his cultivation base, but to cast the perfected-level Cleansing Technique on himself and comprehend the remaining three farming spells.  

As for actual cultivation progress, he would wait until he had a batch of Sunflowers. After learning how slow his inferior spiritual root made cultivation, he had practically given up on self-training.

The next day, Gu Mo set out early to collect spirit seeds from the Spirit Plant Hall. Last time, he had hitched a ride with Mai Yunfa, but now, traveling on foot made him acutely aware of the distance between his field and the hall.  

"I should get a means of transportation soon."  

By the time he arrived, panting, the thought had firmly taken root in his mind.  

His mind wandered—when it came to transportation, flying swords were the obvious choice. They served both as transport and weapons, but their exorbitant price put them out of reach for now.  

A cheaper alternative was the paper crane, the go-to for cash-strapped outer disciples. Though not a true artifact but a talisman with limited uses, paper cranes were affordable and reasonably fast. Of course, they lacked combat capabilities.  

However, with zero spirit stones to his name, even a paper crane would have to wait until his field yielded profits.  

Gu Mo had secured a three-year rent exemption, meaning all earnings from the field during that time were his.  

"Disciple Gu Mo, here to collect spirit seeds!"  

He arrived at the Spirit Plant Hall’s seed repository and bowed to the elderly cultivator on duty.  

"Ah, you're the one who mastered the perfected Cleansing Technique and the Minor Cloud-Rain Technique in three months!"  

The old man scrutinized Gu Mo with interest. A cultivator with such talent yet such poor spiritual roots was a rare sight.  

"Indeed, it is this disciple."  

Gu Mo handed over his identity token.  

"These are tier-1 spirit seeds. Choose for yourself." The elder passed him a thick catalog.  

Gu Mo flipped through the pages respectfully. The first entry was the Spirit Jade Rice, a low-grade tier-1 rice that dominated the Spirit Plant Hall’s cultivation.  

Easy to grow, high-yielding, and harvestable in just six months, it was the perfect starter crop despite its low grade.  

Gu Mo planned to start with it, but he didn’t decide immediately. The catalog listed many other plants, and he wanted to broaden his knowledge.  

Page after page, he encountered various exotic spirit plants, each with specific growing conditions. For example, the high-grade tier-1 Scarlet Grass required a high-temperature environment, necessitating expensive formations to modify the field. Moreover, it didn’t need the Minor Cloud-Rain Technique but daily applications of the Minor Flame Wave.  

Though costly to cultivate, Scarlet Grass promised substantial profits if successful.  

After reviewing several more tier-1 plants—the catalog listed no higher grades—Gu Mo suddenly came across an entry that caught his eye: the Spirit Sunflower.  

To him, it looked strikingly similar to a sunflower—or rather, his Sunflower plant.  

Originally, he had planned to hide his Sunflower among the rice, but this was an even better disguise.  

The Spirit Sunflower had no special growing conditions, but its growth was slow. While Spirit Jade Rice matured in half a year, the sunflower took several years.  

Both were low-grade tier-1, but one took months, the other years. However, the Spirit Sunflower had one redeeming quality—if cultivated long enough, it had a chance to upgrade in grade.  

This slim possibility deterred most, but for Gu Mo, it didn’t matter. His goal was camouflage.  

"Elder, I choose Spirit Jade Rice and Spirit Sunflower!"  

The old man wasn’t surprised. Spirit Jade Rice was every beginner’s first pick, and the sunflower wasn’t uncommon either—its potential for upgrading attracted some.  

Gu Mo’s request for hundreds of sunflower seeds was slightly excessive but still within reason.  

With the seeds in hand, he rushed back to his field and planted them all. The sunflower seeds were placed in a patch near his house, while the rest of the field was sown with rice.  

Once done, he cast the Minor Cloud-Rain Technique to water the seeds.  

Now, all that was left was to wait for them to sprout.
