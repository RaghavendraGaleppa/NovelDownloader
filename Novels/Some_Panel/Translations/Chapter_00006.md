# Chapter 6: Old Man Jin, There's a Great Terror Ahead

The previously calm and sun-drenched sea surface suddenly displayed a terrifying system notification.

[The sea area one hundred miles from here is about to experience a sudden weather change. Extreme Violet Heavenly Lightning will strike in two hundred breaths, covering an area with a radius of one hundred miles.]

Sudden weather change?
Extreme Violet Heavenly Lightning?
A radius of one hundred miles?

What terrible luck!

Yang Ji's hair bristled instantly. Extreme Violet Heavenly Lightning? How could that be? Even Golden Core cultivators would kick the bucket; who could withstand that? He was here to earn spiritual stones, not to die.

Seeing the large ship slowly sailing into the Extreme Violet Heavenly Lightning's coverage area, he immediately darted over to Jin Dafu, his voice trầm, "Old Man Jin, my eyelid has been twitching really badly. There might be a great terror ahead. Why don't we take a detour?"

"What great terror? Don't scare yourself. Do you have thalassophobia? Look how pale you are. Don't be afraid, I'm here," Jin Dafu chuckled indifferently, waving his hand to signal him to sit down. "Come, come, have a drink with me to calm your nerves!"

Seeing that he was unmoving, Yang Ji couldn't help but frown, his tone growing a little heavier as he urged, "Old Man Jin! There's really a great terror. Let's take a detour quickly."

"Young friend Yang, look at the sky. Blue skies, green seas, and a crisp breeze. Where's the great terror? Are you saying a demon king is going to suddenly jump out from ahead?" Jin Dafu shook his head and laughed.

"Old Man Jin, whenever my eyelid twitches, something terrible usually happens. It's been very accurate since I was a child. Believe me, let's take a detour quickly." Yang Ji watched Jin Dafu leisurely sitting in his chair, sipping spiritual wine, and really wanted to choke him.

"You possess such a skill?" Jin Dafu glanced at him, a hint of teasing in his voice.

Seeing that the large ship had already entered the Extreme Violet Heavenly Lightning's coverage area, an urgent feeling rose in Yang Ji's heart. He stared at the man before him, his brows deeply furrowed. This Jin Dafu was truly impervious to advice! Knowing that the more urgent he became, the less likely he would be believed, Yang Ji took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. Then, with a solemn expression, he said in a low voice, "Old Man Jin, do I look like I'm joking?"

"You…" Seeing Yang Ji's earnest face, Jin Dafu frowned, momentarily speechless.

"Don't hesitate any longer. Trust me this once. Quickly turn the ship around, or we'll all die!" Yang Ji urged.

"Hmph! Alarmist talk. Do you still want your fifty spiritual stones?" Old Man Jin widened his eyes, instantly displeased. When a ship sets out to sea, such inauspicious words are the most taboo.

"Fine! Since Old Man Jin doesn't believe me, then I'll have no choice but to jump ship and flee. Please take care!" Everyone has their own destiny. Yang Ji knew he couldn't persuade Jin Dafu and was about to leap into the sky to leave the ship.

"Hey, hey, hey!" Seeing that Yang Ji didn't seem to be joking, Jin Dafu quickly pulled him back, scolding, "Are you crazy? The sea is vast; there's no place to stand for a thousand miles around. Do you want to exhaust yourself and fall into the sea to feed the fish?" He suddenly thought of something, drawing out his words, "Ah! Are you complaining about the spiritual stones being too little? I'll give you ten more. You're so young; don't think about ending your life."

Oh, Jin Dafu, Jin Dafu, if it weren't for those two heartfelt sentences of yours, I really would have turned around and left. Yang Ji turned, grabbed his neck fiercely, and gritted his teeth, "Old Man Jin! Quickly turn the ship around! I don't want my spiritual stones; you can have them!"

"Young friend, have you sensed something?" At some point, Chen De and a group of cultivators, perhaps having overheard their conversation, had arrived on the deck. He saw cold sweat trickling down Yang Ji's temples, his face deathly pale, utterly devoid of color. For a moment, Chen De looked at him with surprise and uncertainty, then turned to look at the sea ahead.

"Senior, my eyelid is twitching terribly. There must be a great terror ahead," Yang Ji said. "When I was five, my eyelid twitched, and hail the size of tables poured down from the sky. When I was ten, my eyelid twitched, and deep-sea whirlpools suddenly appeared in the ocean, swallowing countless ships. When I was sixteen, my eyelid twitched, and a deadly hurricane raged at sea, connecting heaven and earth, sweeping dozens of miles, and wherever it passed, the seawater would sink dozens of feet."

"Now my eyelid is twitching again, and the feeling is exactly the same as before, even more intense," Yang Ji said gravely, his expression exceedingly serious.

"This…" Seeing Yang Ji's earnest appearance, even on this brightly sunlit, clear day, Chen De felt a chill run down his spine. His expression flickered, and he exchanged glances with the other cultivators, whose faces had also grown solemn. He immediately said, "Shopkeeper Jin, let's turn the ship around and take a detour."

They were all people who frequently went out for cultivation and training, extremely sensitive to risks. They preferred to believe it was true than not. They shared the same mindset as Yang Ji: it was acceptable not to earn spiritual stones, but their lives had to be preserved. Even if this was just a false alarm, they had to treat it as real, because they couldn't afford to gamble. Furthermore, having experienced life-and-death situations, they could sense that Yang Ji wasn't lying, which made them take it even more seriously.

"This… taking a detour will waste a lot of time!" Jin Dafu frowned, hesitant and uncertain. Seeing that everyone's expressions had become grave, his heart also began to pound. He quietly looked towards the sea ahead, but there was nothing unusual.

"If Old Man Jin insists on not turning back, then I will have no choice but to leave. I don't want the spiritual stones either. However, if you encounter danger, don't blame me for not warning you then," Yang Ji said, shaking his head helplessly.

"Shopkeeper Jin!" Chen De and the others' voices also deepened. Such intangible things were hard to explain clearly. Chen De and the others would rather give up spiritual stones and avoid risk than venture into danger.

"Then, turn the ship around!" Jin Dafu waved his hand helplessly, not forgetting to give Yang Ji a fierce glare. Instantly, text appeared above his head: [Kid, your spiritual stones are gone]. Yang Ji saw it and couldn't help but chuckle.

"Heave-ho, heave-ho!" At Jin Dafu's command, dozens of Xiantian Realm sailors immediately pulled the sails, adjusting the direction of the large ship.

"Senior, let's quickly go into the cabin and fully activate the formation to make the ship leave this sea area immediately," Yang Ji urged.

"What? Fully activate the formation? How many more spiritual stones will that cost?" A pained expression appeared on Jin Dafu's face.

"Is it absolutely necessary?" Chen De looked at Yang Ji.

Seeing [Extreme Violet Heavenly Lightning will appear in thirty breaths], Yang Ji rushed directly into the cabin, shouting, "Seniors, quick, quick, quick!"

"Let's go, get in!" Chen De was also a decisive and swift person. He immediately led the group into the cabin and fully activated the formation. With the formation fully activated, the large ship instantly transformed into a streak of light, parting the waves with a whoosh, surging several miles forward. Its speed reached its maximum.

Seeing this, Jin Dafu's heart bled, as activating the formation required spiritual stones. The ship moved like a streak of lightning, and one could imagine the rate at which spiritual stones were being consumed.

But before he could feel the pain for long, he saw the sun rapidly disappear into the clouds at a visible speed. In just five breaths, the sky above quickly darkened. Dark clouds gradually enveloped the sky. The previously brilliant sunlit day instantly turned to night.

Whoosh, whoosh! The sound of the waves grew louder, and strong winds and waves suddenly rose. The ship began to rock violently.

"This… what's happening?" Jin Dafu stood on the deck, looking at the sky, his eyes filled with shock.

Suddenly—

Boom!

A clap of thunder roared in the sky. The cultivators in the cabin were immediately startled. Chen De murmured, "Will it rain heavily?" He pulled back the curtain and looked out the window, his face quickly turning grim.

"Senior, what's wrong?" Seeing his expression, everyone looked out the windows. They found that the sky had indeed turned dark.

Just as everyone peered out, another clap of thunder echoed from within the dark clouds.

Boom!

And then another.

Boom!

Outside, the clouds were like ink, and rumbling thunder was brewing.

Crack!

Lightning tore through the dense clouds, and the sea merged with the darkness. The eve of the storm was terrifyingly grim, arriving so swiftly that in the blink of an eye, the weather had changed drastically. Gale-force winds suddenly whipped up on the sea, lightning twisted like snakes, accumulated clouds vibrated with moisture, and droplets splashed on the sea surface. On the dark sea, a lone boat bobbed with the waves. A clap of thunder exploded, and torrential rain immediately poured down. Lightning connected heaven and earth, drawing terrifying arcs, like the end of the world.

*Splat! Splat! Splat! Splat! Splat!*

Fist-sized raindrops hit the deck, creating countless heavy thuds.

*Crackle!*

Lightning as thick as a water bucket streaked across the sky, striking in front of the sailboat, incredibly terrifying. The sailboat rocked violently, seeming as if it could capsize at any moment. In the boundless sea, with the sudden change in weather, all beings felt insignificant, and a sense of terrifying awe arose spontaneously.

"This storm came too quickly! Quick, fully activate the formation, accelerate forward!" Chen De immediately shouted.

It's more than just a storm, it's going to be the Extreme Violet Heavenly Lightning later, Yang Ji thought, his face particularly solemn as he looked at the sky.

"Quick, everyone move! Don't worry about wasting my spiritual stones; open the protective formation together!" At this moment, Jin Dafu actually rushed in, shouting this. Everyone was surprised. Jin Dafu had been so pained about spiritual stones before, but now he had become so generous, even telling them to open the protective formation together. Full of doubt, everyone turned their gaze towards the deck behind him.
