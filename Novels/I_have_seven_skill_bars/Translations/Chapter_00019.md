## Chapter 19: Skill Fusion

Another month passed, and Ding Rui finally cultivated the *Azurewood Technique*. He found that as his mastery of True Essence grew, the speed at which he cultivated new techniques also gradually increased. It was like a driver becoming familiar with a road, speeding up and encountering fewer problems; the same effect applied when one became familiar with their own vehicle. And the unaligned True Essence was the vehicle Ding Rui was increasingly familiarizing himself with.

The task of a cultivator of the *Azurewood Technique* was weeding. Spirit fields were rich in spiritual energy, suitable for plant growth, so weeds were naturally unavoidable. The presence of weeds would seize growth space and resources from the spirit rice, even absorbing the spiritual energy from the rice itself. While this wouldn't put the spirit rice in danger of wilting, it would ultimately affect its yield. Only with sufficient spiritual energy and other resources could the spirit rice produce enough spirit grains. What the sect needed was not just living spirit rice, but spirit rice with massive yields.

As for weeds, violently pulling them out made it difficult to eradicate them completely and could even harm the surrounding spirit rice. However, the *Azurewood Technique*'s True Essence was perfectly suited to dealing with weeds. The *Azurewood Technique*'s True Essence was wood-attributed, very similar to the pure spiritual energy within plants.

Ding Rui sat cross-legged on the bed in his room, looking at the skill panel in his mind. At this moment, his skill slots already contained five skills: [Golden Radiance Technique], [Golden Radiance Spear], [Dewdrop Technique], [Rain Casting], and [Azurewood Technique]. Having cultivated the *Azurewood Technique* and comprehended the [Azurewood Technique] skill, he was left with only two skill slots! If he then comprehended a [Weeding] skill, he would have only one skill slot left.

But he still had two techniques he hadn't learned: first, the *Earth Qi Technique*, and second, the *Condensing Yang Technique*. Ding Rui wanted to become a Spirit Farmer, and to do so, he had to rely on the skill slots to operate cultivation techniques and cultivate muscle memory. However, with only one skill slot remaining, it clearly couldn't support him in doing so. Moreover, as a spirit field cultivator, he couldn't possibly avoid doing work. Even outer sect disciples had mandatory tasks; everyone was busy, and he could hardly expect special treatment in this regard, especially given that he alone could hold multiple positions and almost determine the yield of an entire spirit field. He also didn't dare expose the matter of his skill slots. If this issue couldn't be resolved, he would have no choice but to abandon practical skills like [Rain Casting] to learn all five Five Elements techniques and merge them into one.

The reason was simple. Both the [Golden Radiance Spear] and [Weeding] skills were aimed at individual spirit rice plants. [Rain Casting], however, was for groups of spirit rice. Compared to the scenario of performing insect control or weeding on a single spirit rice plant while simultaneously casting rain over a large expanse of other spirit rice, he found that killing insects and weeding a single spirit rice plant at the same time was considerably less difficult.

Wasting no time, Ding Rui first consumed spirit grains and spent most of the night cultivating the *Azurewood Technique* to the same realm as his *Golden Radiance Technique* and *Dewdrop Technique*. He then rose from his bed, went directly to the spirit fields outside, found a spirit rice plant with tiny new weeds, sat beside it, activated his True Essence, and began weeding for the first time.

A moment later, a familiar prompt appeared in his mind.
