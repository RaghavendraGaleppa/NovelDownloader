# Chapter 75: Jun Feng

“Is this how your Great Qin treats its guests?”

Jun Feng ignored Zhou Tian and spoke directly to Zhou Yan, completely disregarding Zhou Tian.

“That depends on whether the arrival is truly a guest!”

Zhou Yan remained as calm as still water, meeting Jun Feng’s gaze without giving an inch.

“I’ve heard that the Crown Prince of Qin doesn’t think much of those from my Grand Luo Academy in your Great Qin imperial capital?”

A moment later, Jun Feng turned his sharp gaze back to Zhou Tian.

“I don’t keep the Grand Luo Academy in my eyes, but I keep it in my heart.”

Zhou Tian met Jun Feng’s gaze. Although he tried to look serious, the more he looked, the more distracting it became, because Jun Feng’s purple eyes truly resembled colored contacts. There was someone with green contacts last time too, even more alternative than this person.

Jun Feng was silent for a moment, perhaps not expecting Zhou Tian to be so shameless. Even he would find it hard to utter such words as keeping the Grand Luo Academy in his heart.

“As expected, you only know how to rely on glib talk. This is the Eight Continents Grand Competition, not that greenhouse in your Great Qin imperial capital where you’re constantly protected. If all you can do is talk, you won’t survive long!”

Jun Feng changed the topic. He didn't believe the rumors about Zhou Tian "forcing a Saint King to kneel with a single word" in the slightest. Even Academician Li had remained tight-lipped and refused to elaborate. A Saint King was a realm attained only after countless tribulations, possessing the power to overturn heaven and earth. How could such a being be forced to kneel by a mere mortal? It must have been some underhanded trick by the people of Great Qin.

“Whether I live long or not is none of your concern. You should worry about your own people instead. With some people’s intelligence, they might not live long!”

Zhou Tian retorted sharply. When an unwelcome guest arrived, one naturally had to be even more unpleasant to make their position perfectly clear.

“How dare you be so insolent!”

Before Jun Feng could speak, four youths standing behind him sternly shouted, “Whose intelligence do you say won’t let them live long?!”

His eyes burned with fire. Young and impetuous, his face still held a hint of childishness. His parents were both highly respected in the Grand Luo Academy, and his talent was extraordinary. He was one of the standouts of this generation, otherwise, Jun Feng wouldn't have brought him along. Since childhood, no one had ever dared to speak to him in such a snide manner.

“Whoever speaks up is who I’m talking about.”

Zhou Tian showed no fear. So what if your eyes could shoot fire? Who were they trying to scare?

“You… dare to fight me?!”

This kid’s intelligence was clearly much higher. He didn’t bother arguing with Zhou Tian, knowing his advantage, and directly issued a challenge. This was Sky Pass, not the Great Qin imperial capital. No one feared anyone here.

Zhou Yan and Jun Feng both remained composed, as if the matter before them had nothing to do with them.

“Challenge me? Alright, first defeat my little brother.”

Zhou Tian patted Zhou Zui, who was beside him, signaling him to step forward.

“Me? When did I become your…?”

Zhou Zui, who had been watching the show, froze. He was about to retort but saw Zhou Tian’s mouth shape: “Chu~~”. His head slumped, and he stepped forward, speaking weakly, “My big brother is behind me. To challenge him, you must first pass my test!”

“Hmph, petty tricks are useless in the face of absolute strength! Come on!”

The youth’s vital energy surged. His slightly naive face carried unparalleled confidence. Light flickered around his body, his fists clenched, exuding an indomitable aura.

Zhou Tian's face showed a hint of emotion. How wonderful it was to be young! He also wished he could be so full of chuunibyou energy, but alas, the Art of Sloth was simply too good.

“Ze Yuan, don’t be rash!”

Jun Feng frowned slightly, stopping the battle-eager Ze Yuan. This junior brother was good in every way, but he was just too hot-blooded. Didn't he see that the other youths beside them hadn't spoken?

Ze Yuan looked unwilling, but seeing Jun Feng’s sharp gaze, he retreated.

Jun Feng then turned to Zhou Yan and said, “Since when did the Prince of逍遥 become the Qin Prince’s little brother?”

His provocative intent was evident.

Zhou Yan remained unfazed, his demeanor like an immortal. He calmly said, “Since when did a visiting card become a challenge?”

Jun Feng’s expression darkened. This was precisely why he had stopped Ze Yuan. The Grand Luo Academy valued etiquette above all else. To present a visiting card yet come to challenge them would reflect poorly if word got out.

“Then a challenge will certainly be sent another day!”

“Brother Jun Feng, why such a temper? We depart in three days. If anything were to go wrong in a battle now, it would greatly impact our performance in the Eight Continents Grand Competition.”

Zhou Yan was indeed worthy of being the Second Prince. He had received royal education since childhood. Just moments ago, he was clashing fiercely with Jun Feng, but now he addressed him as “brother.”

A purple glow shimmered in Jun Feng’s eyes, but the composure he had when he arrived was gone. He felt as if he had been led by the nose ever since he got here. However, what Zhou Yan said was indeed reasonable. Ze Yuan was one of the Grand Luo Academy’s most promising talents. If anything happened to him in a fight, the Grand Luo Academy would lose a major fighting force.

“Prince Yan truly lives up to his name. I hope you maintain such composure when the Grand Competition begins.”

Jun Feng stood up, and after speaking, turned to leave without another word to Zhou Tian.

The four youths followed. Three of them looked calm, not paying much attention to Zhou Tian. In their minds, dragons did not associate with snakes.

Only Ze Yuan gave Zhou Tian a cold glare, not forgetting to leave a harsh warning: “Don’t let me see you in the Land of the Forsaken Gods!”

After they left, Zhou Yan waved his hand and said, “Don’t just stand here. All of you are a handful.”

Zhou Tian and the others smiled and also turned to leave the great hall.

Now, Zhou Tian just wanted to go back to sleep. He rejected Zhou Zui’s excuse of going to cultivate diligently, which was actually to look at pretty ladies, and returned to his own room to sleep.

He didn't pay much attention to what the others went to do.

He slept until the afternoon. Just after waking up, he received news: the second batch of people from Great Qin had arrived, but they were just some nobodies whose names Zhou Tian had never even heard of. Tian Ling had not yet arrived.

In the evening, Zhou Tian went out to court death again. Like the previous times, he found a dark workshop. However, this time there was an accident. When he instantly teleported in, he was unlucky enough to be discovered immediately.

Then, a silver flash, and a sharp sword directly pinned him to the wall. The sword was no ordinary artifact; its fierce sword energy tore his entire body apart. Bright red blood flowed down the h hilt. Zhou Tian died without even letting out a peep.

However, after this revival, Zhou Tian finally understood a doubt he had: what would happen if he revived while carrying someone else’s weapon? Like in today’s situation, being impaled with someone else’s sword still stuck in his chest.

After this revival, the silver sword that had been impaled in Zhou Tian vanished. He speculated that it must have been destroyed by the system, because the owner of that silver sword spat out a mouthful of blood, looking seriously injured.

The weapon was spiritually linked to its owner, and its destruction caused him heavy injuries. Unfortunately, by the time he recovered, Zhou Tian had already disappeared.
