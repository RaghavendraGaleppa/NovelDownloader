# Chapter 193: My Young Master, Caught in a Crisis

Madam Wen’s whereabouts were unpredictable, and her lightness skill was exceptional. No one knew when she had entered the fray. With one hand gently supporting Li Xian, she pinched the Golden Scale Fish’s tail with the other. The fish flapped a few times before becoming docile again.

She said softly, "Good fish, go play in the water." She bent down and released it back into the lake. The Golden Scale Fish seemed both real and illusory, solid yet void. Though it had the body of a fish, it was not a mere aquatic beast.

Upon entering the water, it swam freely, darting golden light in all directions.

However, no matter how the Golden Scale Fish darted about, it remained within three feet beneath her feet, subtly implying: *Even if the Golden Scale has talent, how could it escape my grasp?*

Madam Wen swept her gaze toward the old matron of the Cao family. With a wave of her sleeve, a powerful Qi force shot out.

The old matron tried to resist with her whip, but it was too late. In an instant, she was pushed into the lake, leaving her boat empty.

Madam Wen retracted her palm,吸 (xī -吸,吸力/suction), and the empty boat drifted slowly toward her. She raised her hand slightly. Li Xian understood her intention, supported her arm, stepped into the boat first, and helped her aboard.

The old matron sank upon hitting the water. As a Second Realm martial artist, she would dissolve instantly upon entering the water, falling into grave danger. Gathering her composure, she pulled an object from her sleeve. It was a long tube; channeling her Internal Qi into it, she shot out an iron nail. The end of the nail was attached to a [Silkworm Thread].

Not long after, the old matron scrambled onto the boat in a wretched state, standing alongside Cao Shuang.

"Are you alright?" Cao Shuang asked gravely. The old matron nodded, intending to say "I'm fine," but suddenly her face turned blue and purple, blood gushed from her nose and mouth, and she collapsed onto the deck.

The elders of the Cao family changed color. Checking her pulse, they were shocked, angry, and terrified. The old matron’s liver and spleen were shattered; her injuries were extremely severe! How or when she had been hurt, they had no idea!

Madam Wen showed no mercy the moment she acted. The Cao, Yuwen, Lin, Chu, and Ouyang Zi families were all intimidated by her aura.

She stood there in a white dress as light as gauze, with gentle eyebrows and eyes, a graceful charm, and a peerless, immortal beauty. How could she look like someone who would use vicious moves?

Zhou Shijie’s mind froze, his eyes wandering. His gaze was drawn uncontrollably to Madam Wen. *Ah! It’s her…* He revealed a痴 (chī - foolish/obsessed) expression.

Although he was痴恋 (chī liàn - obsessively in love) with Gu Nianjun, seeing such beauty delighted him, and unconsciously, he was infatuated with Madam Wen as well.

Seeing Li Xian standing so close to Madam Wen, Zhou Shijie thought, *Ordinary men and women wouldn’t stand this close. Their movements are so intimate, could it be…?* He couldn't help but ask, "Senior, this boy brought this upon himself; why do you need to stand up for him?"

Madam Wen ignored him.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, why have you come?"

Madam Wen patted his hand and said softly, "I had other matters to attend to, but just before finishing, I remembered that today is the Tower Banquet for the prodigies. I came to take a look and happened to see you being bullied. Naturally, I had to speak up for you."

"Thank you, Madam," Li Xian said gratefully. However, he knew he couldn't take her words at face value.

Madam Wen asked, "You are all elders of your respective clans. Surrounding and bullying my young master like this, aren't you ashamed?"

"Ouyang Zi… did you bully my young master just now?"

She called him out by name, showing no courtesy. Ouyang Zi took a half-step back, shaking his head. "Your young master is full of heroic spirit; he is truly a young talent. How could I dare to bully such a prodigy? How could I? It was all a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding."

"Please don't take it to heart, Madam."

Hearing the term "young master," Zhou Shijie’s heart fluttered with envy. *How sweet and honey-like those calls of 'young master' are. If she called me that, how wonderful it would be.*

Madam Wen said, "Is that true? Little Xian, tell me."

"I don't know if Senior Ouyang Zi bullied me or not," Li Xian said. "He spoke to me about 'shallow fate' or something. My cultivation is shallow, so I didn't understand. I was just about to ask Senior Ouyang Zi for guidance."

Ouyang Zi felt a chill down his spine. He laughed awkwardly, "That's right. Nephew, you didn't hear the rest. I hadn't finished. Talk of fate is just superstition. As martial artists, if one believes in fate, that person is incredibly foolish. Their future achievements will be limited."

"Conversely, a young hero like you, who is young yet has soaring ambition and dares to ask how high the heavens are, will surely stand at the very top one day. Haha!"

Madam Wen lowered her eyes. "It's a pity. I actually believe in fate. It seems I am the foolish person Ouyang Zi speaks of."

"But then again," Ouyang Zi said, "upon careful thought, the theory of fate actually has some merit. I also believe in fate. Fate is good, very good…"

As he spoke, cold sweat poured down his face.

"May I ask who you are?" Cao Shuang asked.

Ouyang Zi cursed, "You ignorant old fool! Have you never heard of the Sword-Breaking Madam? Although the Madam has been in seclusion for years cultivating her divine arts, rarely showing her face, and has faded from the Jianghu, you should remember the name for a lifetime, even if you are from a major city."

"Sword-Breaking Madam!"

The Cao, Lin, Yuwen, and Chu clans were all startled. Although the major families of the Prefecture City dominated their regions, they rarely traveled. They had heard of the Sword-Breaking Madam years ago but had never met her.

The Lin family had the best chance to know of her existence; Lin Guolong and Lin Aoshan knew of her. But Lin Guolong’s family status was too low, almost invisible. Lin Aoshan was busy with affairs, rushing back and forth, and had long forgotten about it. No one mentioned it, so she didn't think of it.

Although the Cao family had a grudge, Cao Yuan was unable to speak, suffering from unbearable itching, his mind muddled. The clan soldiers who escorted him back had been killed early on to cover up the scandal. By a twist of fate, they didn't know about the Madam.

"Li Xian is actually the esteemed disciple of the Sword-Breaking Madam," Lin Bei laughed.

"No wonder he is so formidable. I admire him, I truly admire him. What happened just now was a misunderstanding. We absolutely did not intend to bully Li Xian. It's just that some people are impatient and spoke harshly. Please don't misunderstand, Madam."

Ouyang Zi said, "Haha, let's just let bygones be bygones. Let's discuss how to divide the Golden Scale."

Upon hearing they would share the Golden Scale, the prospect of great profit immediately softened everyone's expressions.

The elders of the Cao family looked at Cao Shuang. Cao Shuang pondered for a moment, weighing the relationships: regarding the Tower Banquet, the Cao family had invited Li Xian to draw out the person behind him, intending to take revenge…

With the advantage of the Prefecture City, surrounding and capturing him should have been easy. But they underestimated the enemy, inviting a wolf into the house instead, resulting in someone else taking a share of the profit.

The Cao family was indeed foolish and ridiculous. But upon closer inspection, it was inevitable. The Cao family had been domineering for too long and inevitably became arrogant. It was only a matter of time before they stumbled.

"Master Zhou spoke very reasonably just now. Since the Sword-Breaking Madam is here, she is fated with the Golden Scale," Cao Shuang said. "The Golden Scale with the Pearl, ranked one hundred and six among the Earthly Rankings, is most precious because of the golden pearl in its mouth, which contains immense术蕴 (Shù Yùn - Art/Technique Implication)."

"The Golden Scale was won by the Madam's disciple. Since that is the case, the most precious golden pearl should go to the Sword-Breaking Madam. As for the rest of the body and eyes, we five factions shall divide them. Does anyone have any objections?"

Ouyang Zi stroked his beard. "That is fair."

The Lin, Chu, and Yuwen families all said, "No objections."

Madam Wen smiled. "What Elder Cao says makes sense, but when I arrived, I seemed to hear someone saying that previous agreements were void. If I didn't hear wrong, the division should be decided anew."

Madam Wen glanced at Zhou Shijie and pointed a slender finger at him. "This young master can testify."

"That is true," Zhou Shijie was greatly encouraged. "I said before that whoever takes the Golden Scale gets the pearl. But the elders wouldn't listen. If the previous agreement is to be voided, that is reasonable. It is perfectly appropriate, both emotionally and logically, for the Madam to want to redistribute."

"Young Master Zhou is truly a scholar and a warrior; your view of things is very thorough," Madam Wen's tone turned cold as she admonished, "Little Xian, you are inferior in this regard."

Li Xian said, "I will remember your teachings, Madam." But he thought, *Zhou Shijie changes his face so quickly; I am indeed inferior. The Madam's beauty is captivating, her words are seductive, and her strength controls the situation. She has already mastered it.*

He was young and inexperienced, and many of his habits were learned from the Madam. But he didn't accept everything blindly.

"Sword-Breaking Madam, what do you want?" Yuwen Hou asked.

"Elder, you are being too distant," Madam Wen smiled faintly. "'Sword-Breaking Madam' is just a title given by meddlesome people in the Jianghu. Cai Shang is a weak woman; how could I break another's sword? What Cai Shang does is merely to reason with you all."

"But since Elder asked, I will state my opinion. If you disagree, you can propose yours."

"Cai Shang believes that the Golden Scale is a spiritual treasure of heaven and earth. It should not be decided by humans; it should choose its own master."

"Whoever the Golden Scale chooses as its master will own it completely. No one else may touch it."

Ouyang Zi changed color. This method sounded familiar, but the roles had reversed.

Lin Bei realized Madam Wen intended to swallow the treasure whole. He immediately drafted a sentence, "Madam, I think it is a bit..." Before he finished, he suddenly felt his mouth go numb and a foul fluid surge. Raising his hand to touch it, blood dripped; half his chin had been sliced off.

Madam Wen smiled faintly. "I am just a woman with limited experience. If you have better suggestions, please feel free to voice them."

There was a moment of silence. The elders from the various clans exchanged glances, tacitly thinking: *This Madam Wen is determined to swallow the prize whole; it is hard to change. Although she is powerful, this is the territory of the Prefecture City. If we handle it properly, why should we fear her?*

"I agree," Yuwen Hou said. "I agree with the Madam, but I suggest we disperse to allow the Golden Scale to observe."

Madam Wen looked at him meaningfully and smiled. "Brother Yuwen's words make some sense. Let us disperse and begin!"

She raised her hand and pushed. The Golden Scale leaped out, landing on a wide expanse of the lake surface. The others steered their boats away.

The Golden Scale darted around, shining with golden light.

Li Xian held the oar, rowing the light boat. He rowed to the west side of the lake. Madam Wen saw the lake flowers there were lush and had a unique charm, so she said, "Let's stop here."

The boat stopped. Madam Wen said, "Reveal your Perfect Physique. The Golden Scale will naturally choose you as its master; why fight for it?"

Li Xian heard this and circulated his Qi through his meridians. The red mole between his eyebrows glowed faintly, his aura ethereal and extraordinary.

The Golden Scale flipped in the lake, looking very happy. Suddenly sensing a certain aura, it swam over quickly, leaped out of the water, and landed in Li Xian's arms.

Madam Wen rejoiced, "Good, excellent! Truly a talent worthy of the Golden Scale!"

Whoever the Golden Scale chooses is a "Golden Scale Talent." The [Golden Scale] is a spiritual treasure nurtured by heaven and earth; it likes to eat the talent aura of prodigies and will actively choose its master.

However, Madam Wen wasn't sure if Li Xian could attract the Golden Scale, or if he was a Golden Scale Talent. If he was, that was best. If not, she had other ways to get the Golden Scale.

Madam Wen said, "Little Xian, let's go."

"Hold on," Yuwen Hou said loudly. "Are you determined to swallow the Golden Scale whole?!"

Now that he was far from the Madam, ensuring his safety, he became much braver.

"The Golden Scale chose its master; where is the monopoly?" Madam Wen asked.

"Hmph."

From another direction, Cao Shuang said from afar, "Sword-Breaking Madam, we allowed you to take the pearl, which was generous of us. Since you refuse to appreciate the kindness, don't blame us for being rude. We admit we are not your match, but if you bully us like this, you must pay the price!"

With that, the many Prefecture soldiers hiding in the crowd watching the spectacle revealed themselves simultaneously, holding bows and arrows aimed at the center of the lake.

Ten thousand arrows were poised to strike!
