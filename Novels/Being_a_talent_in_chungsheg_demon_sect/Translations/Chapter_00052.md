Chapter 52: Crushing the Flower

Talisman arts and array formations, though each has its unique strengths, ultimately lead to the same destination. As external tools, they are all means for cultivators to overcome the strong with the weak, to defeat the powerful with lesser might.

A single Ninth-Grade Array Formation was enough for Lu Yang to gain the upper hand in combat. As for a single Ninth-Grade Talisman, even if it couldn't compare to a Ninth-Grade Array Formation, it was still enough to make Yun Miaozhen stand ready, certainly not something to be dealt with casually.

What's more, the talismans Lu Yang scattered with a wave of his hand now numbered nearly five hundred. Activated simultaneously, their power was truly enough to make heaven and earth change color. Although talismans inevitably turned to ash after activation, leaving nothing behind, making them consumables and thus highly cherished by many, Lu Yang was an exception. Ran out of talismans? No big deal; he'd just have the Banner Spirits work overtime and hastily produce another batch.

Boom!

In an instant, sword qi streaked across the sky, thunder rumbled, and countless talismanic lights, swift as lightning, enveloped Yun Miaozhen in their midst, as if ten thousand blades and axes were falling upon her.

Seeing this, Yun Miaozhen could only reluctantly defend. The next second, qi-light surged, transforming into a silver canopy that securely protected Yun Miaozhen beneath it, blocking all the talismans outside. However, this was only temporary. Talismans did not consume Lu Yang's spiritual power, but Yun Miaozhen's use of the "Taiyi Golden Effulgence Scripture" was immensely draining. With one's strength waning and the other's growing, the qi-light around her was instantly shredded and minced by countless talismans. She could only barely summon another wisp of essence-light to protect herself.

"Slash!"

Lu Yang naturally had no thoughts of cherishing jade and pitying flowers. Sword Qi Talismans and Five Thunder Talismans descended simultaneously, instantly tearing apart Yun Miaozhen's protective mist-robe. In an instant, the mist-robe shattered, scattering like rain, revealing large expanses of snowy white skin.

"Ah!"

Yun Miaozhen's pretty face flushed crimson with anger, her lamb-fat white jade-like skin trembling violently. She instinctively wanted to cover herself, but Lu Yang's attacks left her no free hands.

"Demon! You seek death!" Yun Miaozhen's expression twisted. At such a young age, she had already reached the ninth layer of Qi Condensation, cultivated the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion's Great Divine Ability, and ranked among the True Disciples. As a Foundation Establishment seed of the sect, she had always been high and mighty, aloof and arrogant. When had she ever fallen into such a dire predicament?

Upon seeing this, Lu Yang's lips curved into a slight smile. "Daoist friend truly possesses heavenly beauty and national grace..."

Although Yun Miaozhen tried her best to conceal herself, it was merely an act of self-deception, utterly incapable of hiding from his Dharma Eye. He saw everything, what should be seen and what shouldn't. Yun Miaozhen was incredibly sensitive to his gaze and instantly became even more frantic. What enraged her further was that Lu Yang actually displayed a look of disdain: "In broad daylight, what kind of decorum is this? Is this how a righteous sect's disciple behaves, Daoist friend?"

While speaking, Lu Yang continued to control the talismans, attacking Yun Miaozhen. His provocative words were merely a means to disrupt her state of mind; everything was aimed at defeating the enemy. As expected, being humiliated by Lu Yang in such a manner, coupled with previously holding the upper hand only to be stripped of her clothes by Lu Yang's prodigal and extravagant actions, numerous emotions finally ignited Yun Miaozhen's inner fire, revealing a tiny flaw in her Dao heart.

"Now...!"

Lu Yang naturally wouldn't miss the moment Yun Miaozhen's Dao heart wavered and her mind became disoriented. He immediately formed a hand seal, and a circle of light suddenly appeared behind his head. As the circle of light illuminated, the scene in Lu Yang's eyes abruptly changed. The place where he and Yun Miaozhen had just fiercely battled now distinctly showed countless qi-signatures belonging to Yun Miaozhen—traces she had left behind in this location.

"Profound Yin Seizing Form, Nailhead Severing Life..."

With a thought, Lu Yang directed the circle of light onto a wisp of Yun Miaozhen's qi-signature, seizing it. It then projected an image of Yun Miaozhen's graceful figure. The next second, Lu Yang, without hesitation, brought his fingers together and slashed. Still a vertical slash. The circle of light split into two, and the image of Yun Miaozhen within the light was also divided. Subsequently, an invisible force rapidly acted upon Yun Miaozhen's true body.

Crack!

Suddenly, with a soft sound of skin tearing, a clear bloodstain appeared on Yun Miaozhen's snowy white, delicate forehead, which resembled an ivory carving. Immediately after, the bloodstain began to widen...

"...You dare not!"

In an instant, Yun Miaozhen's pupils constricted, her snowy skin became covered in a dense blush, her graceful eyebrows shot up, and a golden light suddenly burst forth from her beautiful eyes. The next second, Yun Miaozhen actually withdrew the 'divine light' that was in a standoff with the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light. She then gathered both her 'qi-light' and 'essence-light.' These three splendors instantly converged into one, transforming into a brilliant golden radiance that rose from the ground, making her appear like the descent of the Nine Heavens Profound Maiden.

Three Lights Unite, Taiyi Golden Effulgence!

At this instant, Lu Yang felt as if Yun Miaozhen before him had suddenly become 'taller'... not in a physical sense, but on a dimensional level.

'This is a Great Divine Ability!?'

If before Yun Miaozhen was merely using a few superior divine abilities that composed the Great Divine Ability, now she was managing to activate the true Great Divine Ability. This was a completely different feeling. Under the blessing of the Taiyi Golden Effulgence, Yun Miaozhen seemed to detach herself from this mortal realm, gradually ascending to a height utterly different from Lu Yang's.

The two, one high, one low. Lu Yang was intimately familiar with this kind of disparity. While nowhere near as terrifying as that day, it still gave him a touch of the dread he felt upon first encountering Daoist Hongyun!

Just then, Yun Miaozhen moved. She lightly raised her delicate hand, and the Profound Yin Seizing Form Great Spell, which had been acting upon her, was immediately and forcibly diverted onto another person with a similar qi-signature.

Her biological sister, Yun Miaoqing!

The next second, the bloodstain on Yun Miaozhen's forehead rapidly healed, while Yun Miaoqing, still unconscious outside the Grotto-Heaven, suddenly split open.

"Ruthless enough, decisive enough..."

Seeing this scene, Lu Yang immediately mocked, "Daoist friend truly acts swiftly. The moment danger strikes, you decisively kill to protect yourself. Is this the righteous path of the Sword Pavilion?"

"This is Miaoqing's tribulation; do not twist facts," Yun Miaozhen's tone returned to indifference. "You harmed her cultivation, causing her to fail her tribulation, which led to today's misfortune. You are the true culprit."

Lu Yang burst into laughter. "Daoist friend's brazenness is quite something. You're wasted at the Sword Pavilion; you should truly join my Saint Sect!"

Yun Miaozhen remained unmoved, but the killing intent in her beautiful eyes grew even more chilling. She coldly stated, "Sharp-tongued demon, today I shall enforce justice on behalf of Heaven!"

The next second, the Taiyi Golden Effulgence manifested by Yun Miaozhen collapsed with a thunderous roar. Like pushing down a golden mountain or toppling a jade pillar, it swept violently towards Lu Yang and all the talismans he had activated. In an instant, Lu Yang's figure, along with hundreds of talismans, were all swept away as if a praying mantis trying to stop a chariot! This transformation was as if words on a book page had been erased by a rubber. There was neither a corpse nor any residual qi-signature; not even a single trace was left behind, as if he had never appeared in this world to begin with.

Immediately after, the Taiyi Golden Effulgence vanished, revealing Yun Miaozhen's staggering figure. However, at this moment, the face of this Heavenly Favored Daughter was ashen to the extreme.

"Pfft! *Gag—*"

The moment Yun Miaozhen landed, she violently spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. Subsequently, the splendor around her body utterly disintegrated, unable to condense even a single wisp of light.

"It's gone... all gone..." Yun Miaozhen's crimson lips trembled slightly, showing no joy of victory. This was the price of forcibly activating the Taiyi Golden Effulgence with a secret art before reaching the perfected stage of Qi Condensation. Her three splendors of essence, qi, and spirit had all shattered, and decades of arduous cultivation were all turned to ashes. Her previously bright path to Foundation Establishment was also covered by a layer of gloom.

Yun Miaozhen sighed mournfully, then prepared to leave the Grotto-Heaven. But just then, she saw an unbelievable figure suddenly appear.

"Daoist friend, the victor hasn't been decided yet. Are you leaving already?"

Lu Yang appeared, handsome and elegant, with his large sleeves fluttering. Although he too had suffered a great loss of true qi and severe spiritual power depletion, there wasn't a single injury on his entire body!

"This is impossible!" Yun Miaozhen's beautiful face turned pale with fright, her normally clear and pleasant voice becoming sharp. "That was the Taiyi Golden Effulgence! How could you possibly block it?"

Lu Yang naturally wouldn't tell her. Indeed, if relying solely on his own divine abilities, Lu Yang could not have withstood that single burst of Taiyi Golden Effulgence. A true Great Divine Ability already possessed some of the might of Foundation Establishment.

What blocked it was his talent.

[Purple Talent: Got a Few Tricks Up My Sleeve]

[Got a Few Tricks Up My Sleeve: No matter how terrifying the attack, as long as it is within your ability's limits, you can effortlessly handle it twice.]

A talent he gained after restarting, from his previous life when he furiously drew his sword and cleaved the Heaven-Mending Peak Master! If Yun Miaozhen could continuously sweep with the Taiyi Golden Effulgence four or five times, he would undoubtedly die. But she could only sweep once... so don't blame him for 'cheating'!

Although it only allows for 'two times,' it truly *does* have 'two times'!

Lu Yang smiled calmly. First, he grabbed the Grand Empyrean Mirror, then walked up to Yun Miaozhen and used its mirror light to fix her entire body in place.

Yun Miaozhen instinctively struggled, glaring at Lu Yang. "What are you going to do!?"

"To be frank, I am quite interested in the 'Taiyi Golden Effulgence Scripture.'"

"I won't tell you anything!"

"Don't worry, you will tell me." Lu Yang sneered, "I am a disciple of the Saint Sect..."

"...Unfortunately, it's not the complete version."

Lu Yang closed his eyes, contemplating for a moment, then shook his head helplessly. "Only one-third. The remaining parts are protected by restrictions, so I couldn't obtain them..."

The next second, he looked at Yun Miaozhen again. Seeing this, Yun Miaozhen gritted her silver teeth, yet dared not show the slightest hint of resentment. She could only force a fawning smile. "You've already obtained the cultivation method; isn't that enough?"

Lu Yang's face showed pure disgust.

Boom!

Before Yun Miaozhen could finish speaking, Lu Yang shook the Grand Empyrean Mirror. In an instant, wind and thunder intertwined, and her graceful body was instantly reduced to dust.
