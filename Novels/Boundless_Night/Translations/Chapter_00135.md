Chapter 135: The Young Grandmaster

In the night mist, a young man appeared. Tall and broad-shouldered, he possessed a sense of power despite not being burly. He approached with unhurried steps, each one resonating with an inexplicable rhythm, as if striking a unique spiritual drum, echoing in the hearts of those nearby. Was he making his move already? Some youths in the vicinity felt their chests tighten, extremely uncomfortable, their hearts seemingly vibrating in resonance with his footsteps. Many realized that the newcomer was far from simple!

Deep in the night, the wilderness, devoid of fire springs, was steeped in ink-like darkness, rendering everything invisible to ordinary eyes. The young man drew closer, his eyes sharp and bright, like two lamps in the darkness. His steps were steady, each one precisely measured, every distance and every landing force perfect. The ground subtly trembled. He arrived, carrying a unique "momentum," causing individual youths watching nearby to feel as if their hearts were gripped, growing increasingly uneasy. With a *clang*, a sword cry pierced the darkness. Qin Ming, standing still, drew his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade slightly, instantly severing the rhythm. The young man opposite was disturbed, his steps faltered, the special resonance vanished, and wisps of Earth Essence Qi dissipated into the night mist.

"Yu Zhuohan!" the newcomer announced his name. The mountain ranges nearby were swallowed by darkness, not even a vague shadow visible—this was the true nature of the night mist world. Qin Ming, possessing exceptional eyesight that allowed him to discern objects in the night mist after his sixth rebirth, gazed forward and stated his own name, "Qin Ming."

Yu Zhuohan had shoulder-length silver hair, each strand luminous and glistening, actually glowing in the deep night. His face was chiseled, sharply defined. The two observed each other, not rushing to act. Where did the Cui family find such a helper? Even Meng Xinghai frowned slightly, finding this silver-haired youth quite extraordinary. He had set down quite "harsh" rules, specifying in advance that external Saints were not allowed to participate, fearing that Cui He would invite assistance far exceeding the allowed cultivation level.

"This is likely not a pure Reborn," Qi Daoming, exuding a certain immortal aura, commented. He was the son-in-law of the Li family, here purely to watch the spectacle. Moreover, direct descendants from the Li family's elder, middle, and younger generations were present, clearly trying to rub salt in the Cui family's wounds. They were happy regardless of who won or lost, all smiling broadly. Cui He and Cui Shuning's expressions immediately turned cold upon seeing the Li family's direct members; there was no warmth or goodwill between the two sides.

Suddenly, both felt something and turned to look, discovering Wang Caiwei's fifth uncle and her elder brother from the same mother had also appeared on the other side, standing there to observe the battle. In the past, the Cui family had been in the wrong for not informing the Wang family in advance about the identity of the fake Cui Chonghe, feeling somewhat guilty when facing the Wang family's direct descendants afterwards. Especially since this fake Cui Chonghe, who had once roamed with Wang Caiwei, had vaguely shown signs of "dragon transformation" since embarking on the Rebirth path. Most critically, the Cui family had abandoned him earlier, sending him with a group of old men nearing the end of their lifespan to draw away the Li family's main forces, to die and serve their last purpose. Even if some within the Cui family wanted to "win him back," they would be apprehensive, believing that an unbridgeable rift existed between them, and that it would be like raising a tiger to cause future trouble.

In the distance, Zheng Maorong whispered threats, saying, "Look at Cui He, Cui Fourth, who practices the Yimu Art—his hair is green, and his face is as pale and ugly as if he'd eaten a dead rat. He actually dared to slap me! I'll definitely pay him back later!" It was he who, relying on his status, hadn't personally acted but had used hints like glances and faint smiles to incite others against Qin Ming. Other peers, both male and female, all from aristocratic families, looked at Qin Ming in the night mist with complex expressions, recalling past events. Some had been very close to him, belonging to Qin Ming's former acquaintances. This time, these aristocratic scions, hearing that many familiar faces would come to watch, swarmed over. More than two years had passed; among them, some naturally disdained associating with the fake Cui Chonghe, but others had once wanted to visit him in the remote region and took this opportunity to come to the scene.

In the distance, black mist swirled as Li Qingyun appeared, holding a wine jar in one hand while sitting on a large bluestone, and raising a wine cup with the other, gesturing for Cui Fifth Master to drink with him. Cui Fifth Master didn't want to bother, finding the offer too strong. He was completely caught up in this. He had already realized that unless Qin Ming entered a sect's ancestral court or joined a higher academy, he wouldn't be able to escape.

Under the night mist, the two youths made their move! Battle erupted, and everyone in the surroundings fell silent, not a sound to be heard.

In the darkness, astonishing Heavenlight Energy flowed over both their bodies, like two bolts of lightning tearing through the night, illuminating the wilderness as they fiercely collided. Yu Zhuohan rapidly retreated, his chest heaving violently, gasping for air. In the brief exchange of punches and palms just now, he had felt a mountain-like pressure. The Cui family members remained calm, showing no signs of worry. The Lu family, who had come purely for the spectacle with no personal stake, now also showed expressions of surprise. It seemed to confirm that Qin Ming was an anomaly! Lu Yuzhi stared, genuinely surprised that Qin Ming, whom she had encountered by chance in Jinrui City, possessed such astonishing comprehension and was potentially an anomaly. With such a foundation, he was absolutely qualified to enter the Yuqing lineage!

"In such a short time, he has grown to this extent?" Zheng Maorong's expression changed, and it wasn't a pretty sight. In the night mist, Qin Ming remained composed, his tall, slender body like a mountain, advancing with oppressive force towards his opponent. He knew this opponent was very strong, capable of taking his punches without injury, and still seemed quite confident. He assessed that the silver-haired youth had an extraordinary physique, possessing over eight thousand *jin* of strength, almost qualifying as an anomaly. If he cultivated his body with the Six Royal Heart Sutra and the Tathagata Sutra, he would surely enter that realm swiftly.

Yu Zhuohan looked up in the night mist, his entire body becoming translucent. Mysterious patterns seemed to spread and expand within his flesh, and a brilliant silver light erupted from his surface. Qin Ming, fearless of whatever confidence his opponent possessed, took a step, traversing the uneven wilderness and instantly appearing before him, pressing a palm forward. Yu Zhuohan's entire body seemed to be engulfed in silver-white flames, his aura completely transformed. This time, he still dared to directly clash with his opponent, unleashing terrifying fist-light. Indeed, his strength had increased significantly. He fought Qin Ming like lightning, continuous collisions occurring, with what seemed like Earth Essence rising from beneath his feet, while his body was bathed in fire.

Qin Ming was deeply surprised. At this stage, Reborns could barely absorb Earth Essence Qi. Had his opponent also practiced the Wu Ji Sutra? He also mastered fist techniques from the fire domain. The combination seemed remarkably powerful. The next moment, the earth beneath Qin Ming's feet trembled, and Earth Essence Qi steamed upwards. His Wu Ji Fist erupted, blasting forward with lightning speed.

The two were like two colliding meteors, erupting in dazzling sparks. Heavenlight Energy surged, and multiple massive collisions occurred. Wherever they passed, enormous rocks in the wilderness shattered, and towering ancient trees exploded. With a *bang*, Yu Zhuohan was sent flying a great distance, smashing through an ancient tree over a hundred years old. He stumbled and landed, gasping for breath.

In the night sky, it was as if a brilliant rainbow had streaked across. Qin Ming gave him no time to breathe, rapidly closing in. His Lihuo Energy erupted, his right palm shining brightly as he pressed it forward, like a golden crow soaring through the sky, incredibly dazzling, shattering all the night mist. With a *boom*, sand and stones flew in the area, ancient trees crumbled, and figures flipped through the air as Qin Ming pressed his pursuit, relentlessly chasing Yu Zhuohan.

The Cui family members' expressions subtly changed, but they weren't yet anxious. Someone remarked, "This Qin Ming... is unimaginably strong at the Rebirth stage. He can calmly suppress such a formidable opponent. This is truly extraordinary." Subsequently, the Wang family members looked towards Cui He, and Wang Caiwei's elder brother asked, "Just how many times has this Qin Ming undergone rebirth?" Many people felt something was amiss. Yu Zhuohan was almost considered an anomaly, yet he was being forcefully suppressed by Qin Ming. As far as they knew, Qin Ming had been on the Rebirth path for less than half a year. One must remember that during this period, there was a red line: rebirths were not to exceed five times!

Meng Xinghai smiled and said, "This child, Qin Ming, has some luck. Back when he was a hunter to avoid starvation, he once dug up an 'Ethereal Bamboo Shoot' in Black and White Mountain. After consuming it, it purified him, and the red line of 'no more than five rebirths a year' lost its restriction on him." Many were astonished. Such luck existed? An Ethereal Bamboo Shoot was priceless, capable of dissolving poisons, curses, and the like—a rare treasure medicine. Of course, if it could grow into Ethereal Bamboo, its value would be even greater; one wouldn't need to consume it, merely carrying it would constantly purify one's flesh and blood. Meng Xinghai had no choice but to fabricate a story; otherwise, the problem would be too severe. Even he, upon learning of Qin Ming's six rebirths and his arms' strength reaching nine thousand *jin*, felt it was too unreal and was utterly bewildered. If this news got out, he feared that some terrifying old grandmasters, not limited to those on the Rebirth path, would personally intervene to study Qin Ming's body. At that point, even if Li Qingyun were nearby, he wouldn't be able to protect Qin Ming.

Wang Caiwei's elder brother, upon hearing this, glanced indifferently at Cui He and said, "He started later, yet he's already more formidable than Cui Chongxuan, whom the Cui family 'nurtured' with the Six Royal Heart Sutra. If this continues, will he be able to rival Cui Chonghe, who possesses near-immortal potential?" Cui Shuning felt a surge of displeasure. She retorted, "How can someone on the Rebirth path compare to a near-immortal seed from the Outer Lands? Even if he's an elite among anomalies, before Chonghe, he's merely a Divine Armor Guard, or at best, a higher-tier follower. That's his limit!" Cui He also spoke, disliking the Wang family's words. "His upper limit is fixed; there are hurdles he cannot overcome. How many Reborns are there, yet how many ultimately become grandmasters like Qingtian, Tathagata, or Six Royal? And even such sect leaders grind their realms up by enduring time..." Meng Xinghai unceremoniously interrupted him, "You two talk too much. Are the incomplete scrolls of the Yimu Sutra and the Zhushi Sutra ready?" "Who wins or loses is still uncertain!" Cui Shuning replied, her face shrouded in night mist, yet her exceedingly cold expression was still discernible.

With a *boom*, as if in response to their words, Qin Ming's body surged with wind energy, like he was soaring through the air. He stepped lightly on the fresh wild grass, chasing after the already-flung Yu Zhuohan. His Lihuo Energy erupted, like raging flames burning the night sky, once again sending his opponent flying. A group of youths were shocked. This former acquaintance, exiled to a remote region, almost suppressed and forgotten, had actually reached this stage on his own?

"You are too conceited and arrogant!" Cui Shuning, seeing that the situation was not in their favor, shouted to the silver-haired youth. Yu Zhuohan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and stood in the wilderness, saying, "I'm not just helping you; I'm also sparring to temper myself." The next moment, the clearly abnormal phenomena on his body became even more pronounced. Silver flames visibly flowed outwards, and his entire body radiated dazzling light. Every luminous strand of his hair seemed to ignite, and brilliant light flames surged from all his pores. In the dense night mist, he appeared to be standing within a burning silver moon!

"A sorcerer from the Outer Lands of Calamity?" Some people showed surprise. As for the group of youths, they were greatly shaken. "He's from the Esoteric Sect, and extremely rare—he's an innate ability user!" Someone spoke, revealing the silver-haired youth's true background. This was quite astonishing. Yu Zhuohan's physical body was already close to that of an anomaly, yet his greatest strength lay in the methods of the Esoteric Sect. This young powerhouse clearly came from no small background.

Qin Ming was fearless. He pressed forward, exuding a calm and composed aura, not caring in the least what domain his opponent belonged to. Yu Zhuohan glowed brilliantly, standing within the burning silver moon. He forcefully waved his hand, and in an instant, a crescent-shaped light wheel flew out, slashing towards Qin Ming. Qin Ming did not pause his steps in the slightest; he merely tilted his head slightly, evading the attack, and continued to advance with powerful Heavenlight Energy fluctuations.

Yu Zhuohan swept his hands across the void, and dense bursts of fiery light bloomed, then transformed into countless silver blades, wreathed in fierce flames, hacking forward with extreme speed. Qin Ming continued to approach, showing no intention of stopping. However, outside his body, a brilliant golden light had already erupted, enveloping his entire form, with Heavenlight Energy extending three inches from him. His protective technique—the Golden Light Shield—had fully expanded. All the flaming spirit blades struck the Golden Light Shield, producing faint metallic *clang*s, but they could not penetrate this defense.

Yu Zhuohan formed a hand seal, rapidly changing his gestures, then condensed a silver spear, flowing with dazzling radiance and bearing flames that seemed capable of incinerating the night sky. He hurled it fiercely. Qin Ming stood firm. The Golden Light Shield receded, and golden threads covered and spread over his hands, extending three inches from his body. He clapped his palms forward, then with a *bang*, clamped down on the dazzling flaming spirit spear. Next, he forcefully twisted his hands, and with a *boom*, the spear shattered, transforming into brilliant streams of light that dissipated directly into the night sky.

Qin Ming steadily advanced, pressing close to his opponent, like a towering mountain arriving! Someone sighed, "So composed! He can effortlessly neutralize such a powerful innate ability user from the Esoteric Sect. Recently, the Night Report often mentions the so-called 'Young Grandmaster' demeanor. I think this young man right before us truly possesses that aura!"
