# Chapter 145: Completion of the Heavenly Artificer's Forging Technique

As he spoke, Mo Shisan's fingers sank slightly. As more than a dozen puppets swung up with the momentum, pores all over their bodies exuded iron sand that rushed toward him. The speed was so great that it produced a "hissing" sound in the air.

Xu Yunfan remained calm. With a slight flick of his fingers, the intricate mechanisms within them moved subtly. A mechanical puppet beside him suddenly burst forward, positioning itself as a shield. Immediately after, the puppet in front of Xu Yunfan opened its abdomen and began spinning frantically, actually sucking the cloud of iron sand directly into its belly.

"You..." Mo Shisan was momentarily dazed. "You fused the Molten Gold Iron Forging Technique into the Coiling Silk Strength?"

*Your Hundred-Refined Coiling Silk Strength has reached入门 (Initial Mastery).*

*...*

*Your Heavenly Artificer's Forging Technique has been completed.*

*Your Heavenly Artificer's Forging Technique (Complete) has reached入门 (Initial Mastery).*

*Heavenly Artificer's Forging Technique 0/500 (Initial Mastery)*

*Special Effects: Thousand Mechanisms Deconstruction, Earth Vein Resonance, Mechanical Puppets, Precision Refinement, Impurity Removal and Essence Retention, Hundred Refinements Condensed Steel, Thousand Hammer Spirit Runes.*

In an instant, a torrent of knowledge that could almost be called vast and boundless flooded into his mind.

Xu Yunfan's temples suddenly bulged with blue veins, and the sound of countless gears meshing roared in his ears, startling him to the point where his brain seemed to be boiling. The memories transmitted by the Attribute Panel in his consciousness were like exploding golden light. The three ancient seal characters for "Heavenly Artificer's Forging Technique" turned into three hundred and sixty golden threads that pierced his Sea of Consciousness.

He clearly saw the founder of the Mo family holding a Heaven Measuring Ruler to survey the earth's veins; he saw the alchemists of the previous dynasty using the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to cast the Armillary Sphere; and he saw the lost "Thousand Mechanisms Hundred Changes Diagram" rapidly disassembling and reassembling before his eyes.

*Crack!*

A sudden, excruciating pain from a dislocated vertebra in his spine made him groan involuntarily.

The red copper patterns of the Molten Gold Iron Forging Technique, the turtle shell patterns of the玄龟驼山劲 (Black Tortoise Carrying Mountain Strength), and the spiral patterns of the Hundred-Refined Coiling Silk Strength intertwined frantically beneath his skin, eventually condensing into the Mo family's "Non-Aggression" totem. This gradually intertwined and merged with the form he had taken after achieving perfection in muscle, skin, and tendon training and transcending the mortal realm.

Before he could react, the muscles and fibers of Xu Yunfan's body emitted a taut, twanging sound, and every muscle bundle was plated with a meteoric iron's cold luster. When the "Black Tortoise Carrying Mountain Strength" was activated with the "Carrying the Mountain" stance, his latissimus dorsi muscles writhed and reorganized like living things, forming a layered armor structure that could deflect ninety percent of the impact.

Tendons as bowstrings, bones as tenons, Qi as the pivot, and blood as mercury.

"So that's how it is..."

The ultimate arts of the three halls of the Heavenly Artifice Cave, under the system's almost brute-force impact, had completely completed the Heavenly Artificer's Forging Technique, reproducing the lost arts of the Mo family.

The Molten Gold Iron Forging corresponds to quenching, the Black Tortoise Carrying Mountain Strength corresponds to forging, and the Hundred-Refined Coiling Silk Strength corresponds to shaping.

However, the Heavenly Artificer's Forging Technique is ultimately not a cultivation method, but a secret martial art similar to the Cicada Linking Body Technique. It is just more inclined toward vast knowledge, utilizing one's known expertise to create objects of miraculous craftsmanship and supernatural workmanship.

"What's wrong?"

Mo Shisan looked at Xu Yunfan in front of him with some confusion. Just moments ago, Xu Yunfan's muscles had been writhing in waves, like a green python crawling under his clothes, which was hair-raising to watch. Mo Shisan had thought Xu Yunfan had been affected by the Heart-Eroding Pill and was about to mutate.

Xu Yunfan casually tossed the mechanical puppet in front of him aside, causing Mo Shisan's eyelid to twitch in distress.

"This is a Grade C mechanical puppet that took me three whole days to assemble. Even a Three-Training Warrior wouldn't be able to handle it easily!"

Mo Shisan hurriedly helped the puppet up, quite displeased.

"Trash!"

Xu Yunfan's words were filled with disdain, making the blue veins on Mo Shisan's forehead bulge in anger. He abruptly stood up, but seeing that Xu Yunfan had already hoisted the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, he forcefully stopped his steps.

"If you've got the skill, make one for me to see."

Xu Yunfan: "Actually, I think the humanoid mechanical armor you were researching before has more potential. Why don't you give it a try?"

Mo Shisan gripped his wrench. The bronze mechanism case抽出 from the puppet made a faint sound of metal squeezing in his palm. As he inspected it carefully, he responded irritably to Xu Yunfan's words.

"Humanoid? Do you think this is a puppet show on the street? The torque a two-legged structure has to withstand is three times that of a four-legged one! Not to mention that the shoulder-axis linkage requires seventeen transmission chains. Pull one, and the whole system moves. The fact that we can make this kind of mechanical puppet now is thanks to generations of disciples from the Mechanism Hall improving it..."

"So you just stuck with the mortise-and-tenon gear linkage structure that hasn't changed in eight hundred years?"

Xu Yunfan suddenly grabbed the mechanical puppet lying on the workbench. Then, under Mo Shisan's shocked and furious gaze, the sound of gears shattering rang out. Xu Yunfan tore open the bronze chest plate of the puppet with his bare hands and twisted the two small-finger-thick springs into a twisted mess.

Mo Shisan's treasured red copper spine was bent into a crescent moon shape under the Thunderfire Qilin Spiked Hammer, and twelve wolf-tooth tenons clattered and rolled all over the floor.

"Such a waste of precious materials!"

Mo Shisan, heartbroken, grabbed the Heaven Measuring Ruler to strike, but the tip of the ruler was gently blocked by a hand in mid-air.

The subtle and insidious Coiling Silk Strength that burst forth was the most sinister, capable of leaving the skin unbroken while turning the flesh and blood inside into a paste.

But when it reached Xu Yunfan, it was like mud entering the sea, unable to stir up the slightest wave.

Mo Shisan's pupils constricted. Although he knew Xu Yunfan's martial arts talent was exceptional and he was at the stage of muscle and skin perfection, he hadn't expected him to reach a level that he himself couldn't fathom.

They were both Three-Training Warrior realm, yet it felt as if they were in two different worlds.

Xu Yunfan stepped on the puppet's remains with one foot, a half scorpion tail hook held between his fingers. "Your iron turtle's tail vertebrae are too brittle. The shock it can absorb is barely enough to let it be a puppet controlled by others."

A surge of strength traveled from Xu Yunfan's fingertips, causing Mo Shisan to uncontrollably stumble back three steps and crash into a whole shelf of component cabinets.

Knowing there was a gap in their strength, in his own professional field, Mo Shisan was naturally filled with unconvinced disdain.

"Humanoid mechanical armor?"

Mo Shisan stepped on the ball bearings rolling all over the floor and sneered.

"Five years ago, the Tang Sect in Yazhou, Lingnan Dao, created a twelve-foot-tall human puppet and specially invited our Heavenly Artifice Cave to observe it. Unfortunately, it fell apart after taking the third step! The joke of it has made the Tang Sect hide their mountain gates to this day."

He picked up two copper tiger claws and gestured. "The balance pivot of a four-legged mechanical beast is at its waist and hips. A humanoid can only rely on its ankle bones for support..."

*Clack-clack-clack—*

Accompanied by an ear-piercing sound of metal meshing, the steel in Xu Yunfan's hands was kneaded like clay into whatever shape he desired, leaving Mo Shisan dumbfounded.

Forging iron into mud—a powerful warrior could easily do that. But for Xu Yunfan to casually knead it into flat or round shapes was simply不可思议 (unimaginable).

Under Mo Shisan's awestruck gaze, Xu Yunfan used the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in an extremely violent manner to forcefully fuse the thirty-six vertebrae into a single whole. With the final hammer strike, the two-meter-three-tall steel humanoid form crashed to the ground, its ankles embedded by Xu Yunfan with two mountain-opening axe blades.

Mo Shisan's wrench clattered to the floor.

He stepped forward, trembling, to touch the curved armor on the back of the mechanical armor. The rotating gears and transmission rods inside were very familiar—they were all the original materials from his own humanoid puppet, but had been deformed by Xu Yunfan's hands.

"The problem of two-legged weight-bearing... Did you use liquid joint cushioning?"
