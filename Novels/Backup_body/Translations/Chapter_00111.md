# Chapter 111: Evil Demons and Hypocrites!

The newcomer had refined features and a tall, upright figure. His bright eyes and dignified bearing exuded a gentle aura. This was none other than the once razor-sharp Young Sect Master of Kunlun, hailed as the strongest beneath the Human Immortal realm!

Now, having transcended to the Human Immortal realm, he stood above the mundane world with a lifespan of a thousand years. His power had grown immensely, his every movement radiating overwhelming might. Yet, he had lost his former sharpness and the domineering aura that once allowed him to look down upon the world.

"Congratulations," Li Zhengjing said, unable to hide a trace of regret.

Had the Young Sect Master not dulled his edge, his past self—with his fearless demeanor—would never have waited for reinforcements. He would have considered how to annihilate the demonic beings in the mountain single-handedly before Li Zhengjing's arrival. Now, having inherited part of Kunlun Immortal Sect's legacy and ascended to the Human Immortal realm, he certainly had the power to wipe out the mountain's evil. But it was clear he no longer sought risk, opting instead for caution.

"Gains and losses go hand in hand. This was the path I chose twenty years ago," the Young Sect Master said calmly, hands clasped behind his back. "Too much rigidity leads to breaking; too sharp a blade is not always good."

Twenty years ago, he had been hailed as invincible under heaven. Yet, in the two decades since, he had deliberately dulled his edge and tempered his sharpness. The Kunlun Immortal Sect had expended countless rare treasures and enlisted the aid of multiple Human Immortal-level experts to achieve this. The final step had been a life-or-death epiphany—only by completely abandoning his sharpness had he finally ascended to the Human Immortal realm.

"It seems you've let go of more than just the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi—you've also abandoned your pride," Li Zhengjing remarked.

"In the past, I might have risked annihilating them before your arrival, but I would have suffered injuries in the process. That was the price of pride," the Young Sect Master replied evenly. "Since I knew you were coming, why take unnecessary risks? Together, we can eliminate them without harm."

"Unbending resolve is admirable, but careful consideration is even rarer. In my youth, I traveled the world with a heart full of passion, wielding my sword to cut down injustice, disregarding life and death, holding honor above all. But such a man is unfit to lead a sect. A sect master cannot afford to act impulsively, placing himself in danger. From now on, I must think twice before acting."

Li Zhengjing shrugged. "People come in all types. You've simply changed from one to another—there's no right or wrong in that. No need to explain. The world's sect leaders are all shrewd schemers; one more makes little difference. It's just a shame to lose a sword immortal who once dared to defy the heavens and eradicate injustice."

The Young Sect Master glanced at him. "You're unaffiliated now, wandering the world alone. You cultivate the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi, yet your edge remains undulled—far surpassing mine. One day, you'll stand above all as a sword immortal in your own right. No need to lament the loss of one."

His gaze then shifted to Ghost Valley Lingguan. "Elder Ghost Valley, long time no see. How many times is it now that you've defected from the Golden Ship of Salvation?"

Ghost Valley Lingguan covered his face with his sleeve, refusing to answer.

"The Ten Thousand Calamities Salvation Heavenly Venerable allows you to return each time—truly, he values you greatly," the Young Sect Master continued. "Twenty years ago, when Mount Fengdu collapsed, you saved 172 inner elders of Kunlun Immortal Sect. I haven't forgotten that debt. And when Li Zhengjing slew the Venom King Xin Xuan, restoring Zhongzhou's dignity—that, too, I remember."

He turned back to Li Zhengjing. "The Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi is a secret technique of Kunlun, sealed away in our archives. I am the only one who practices it. Outside our sect, only one other person has ever obtained it."

That person, of course, was the Debt Collector. But at this moment, Li Zhengjing recalled the fortune displayed by the golden scroll during their first meeting. Had he not disguised himself then, the Young Sect Master would have recognized his connection to the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord through the sword qi. The scroll had not pointed to the Debt Collector—it had pointed to the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord.

"Young Sect Master, do you know that person's true origins?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"The world now calls him the Debt Collector. Four thousand eight hundred years ago, he was known as the Human Dao Ancestor," the Young Sect Master replied calmly. "After nearly five millennia, even Kunlun Immortal Sect has begun to suspect he perished in the river of time, and that the current Debt Collector is merely his successor."

His grip tightened on his sword. "But within Luofu Immortal Sect, Kunlun detected his presence. The Human Dao Ancestor of four thousand eight hundred years ago still lives."

He met Li Zhengjing's gaze. "Rumors say you possess the physique of the ancient Heavenly Azure Dao Venerable—the only person in history to master the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi without suffering backlash. He likely intends to mold you into the next Heavenly Azure Dao Venerable... and then replace you. After all, he is ancient."

With that, the Young Sect Master strode forward, leaving behind a final message.

"Our sect's sword technique being leaked is a grave matter. But I owe you a debt, and you didn't steal it—you were forced into this. I'll bear responsibility; Kunlun won't pursue it. You wish to escape the Human Dao Ancestor, and Kunlun wishes to bury this 'source of evil' hiding in the world. I've asked our elders to transcribe records on the Debt Collector—they'll arrive tomorrow, a gift to you."

"Now, follow me to slay the demons in the mountain. I want to see your skill. Alone, as a mere pawn, if you want Kunlun's cooperation, you must prove you have potential. If you're just a puppet in his hands, Kunlun won't waste effort on you."

With those words, the Young Sect Master vanished into the mountain ahead.

Li Zhengjing swallowed the jade fragment housing Yuan Zhengfeng's spirit, slung the wutong wood box onto his back, and soared into the air on a surge of magic power. Ghost Valley Lingguan spread his golden wings and followed.

The mountain was crowded with pilgrims seeking blessings from the temple. A radiant Buddhist light shimmered in the distance, inspiring reverence.

The Young Sect Master bypassed the temple, heading for the back mountain. Li Zhengjing followed closely, while Ghost Valley Lingguan landed before the temple, surveying the scene below.

In the back mountain, a massive tiger crouched over a half-eaten corpse. Behind it sat the so-called Living Buddha, who had supposedly tamed the beast. The monk sat cross-legged, holding a steamed bun in one hand and a bowl in the other. The bowl reeked of blood—human blood. The "Living Buddha" dipped the bun into the blood and ate with relish, his mouth smeared crimson.

He looked up at the intruders with disdain.

"Great Wrath Heretic Monk, how does human blood taste?" the Young Sect Master asked, drawing his sword.

Li Zhengjing raised an eyebrow as Yuan Zhengfeng's voice echoed in his ear.

"I know this man. He was once the head of the Arhat Hall in Cloud-Sky Temple, one of Zhongzhou's two great Buddhist sects. But his talent was lacking, so he turned to evil—killing to refine elixirs and enhance himself. When his crimes were exposed, he was exiled from the temple. He fled south, joined a Buddhist sect in the Southern Domain, usurped the abbot's position, and spread his heresy, renaming it Southern Sky Temple—a stronghold of evil."

"Two hundred years ago, the Great Zhou Dynasty eradicated Southern Sky Temple. The Great Wrath Heretic Monk vanished—until now."

Yuan Zhengfeng's tone was grave.

The tiger rose, speaking in a human voice. "Young Sect Master of Kunlun, why have you come?"

"To uphold heavenly justice," the Young Sect Master replied coolly.

"I've done no evil. What justice is there to uphold?" the tiger snarled. "I've converted to Buddhism—I am the guardian beast of Southern Sky Temple!"

"No evil?" The Young Sect Master's gaze fell on the half-eaten corpse.

"I became a demon in these mountains. Everyone knows tigers dwell here—yet they still come to worship. Isn't that seeking death? If they seek death, my eating them is a mercy, not evil!"

"Ah, you've grasped the essence of my teachings," the Great Wrath Heretic Monk said, finishing his bloody meal. "Just as these two, knowing there are tigers here, still entered—like the foolish villagers, they came seeking death. They deserve to die!"

The monk was obese, with beady eyes and a smug expression. He struggled to his feet, stretching lazily. "Knowing the mountain has tigers, yet charging in—that's suicide. If they seek death, they deserve to die. The Tiger King merely obliged them. This is great compassion!"

"What kind of twisted logic is that?" Li Zhengjing's temper flared as he drew his blade. "Are you so deluded you believe your own nonsense?"

"I do as I please—what's it to you?" the monk roared. "They deserved to die! If they erred, they forfeited their lives! Anyone could have killed them! I, in my mercy, ate them to spare others the sin! Who are you to interfere?"

Li Zhengjing massaged his temples, turning to the Young Sect Master. "How does a lunatic like this survive so long? With his malice, he must wreak havoc everywhere. How has the Great Zhou Dynasty not captured him?"

"The local officials are his followers—of course they haven't acted," the Young Sect Master said flatly. "Besides... he has allies."

"So the Young Sect Master has noticed me." A yellow dog emerged from the trees, speaking in a cold voice. "Fifth Helm Master of the Golden Ship of Salvation—a dog turned demon, ascended to immortality," Yuan Zhengfeng identified. "Its master was the Martial Combat Divine King under the Great Zhou's founding emperor. After devouring its master, it claimed the title Five Pecks Divine King. It's said to be a master of flattery, a favorite of the current Ten Thousand Calamities Salvation Heavenly Venerable."

"You come in the name of justice, yet we've done no wrong," the dog sneered. "We merely help those who seek death to die. Where is the evil in that?"

The dog's body swelled as it approached. Sensing the阵法 it had laid earlier had yet to activate, it paused, eyeing Li Zhengjing. "Immortal Venerable Zhengjing, I've heard of you. You accused the Great Wrath Heretic Monk of malice—yet look at his Buddhist radiance! Where is the malice? Monks do not lie—he speaks truth."

It strutted forward. "Look at me—a demon immortal, free to roam the world. Where is my malice? You seek justice, yet you invent crimes where none exist!"

It glanced around, sensing its阵法 finally linking, and smirked. "Today, you entered the mountain seeking death. Eating you would be a mercy! Always sympathizing with worthless mortals—you deserve to die!"

**BOOM!**

The entire mountain trembled!

During their exchange, the Fivefold Slaughter Array the dog had laid finally activated. It grinned triumphantly—only to hear a voice from outside.

"I've already broken the array," Ghost Valley Lingguan called cheerfully. "Five Pecks Divine King, don't forget—you learned阵法 from me."

"Old Ghost!" the dog howled in rage, its magic power erupting.

The Young Sect Master was already upon it, sword flashing.

Li Zhengjing faced the Great Wrath Heretic Monk, his killing intent surging at the sight of the spilled blood. "So you and your ilk used 'Buddhist beads' to corrupt villagers, turning them into food?"

Before the monk could reply, Li Zhengjing raised his left arm—the Blazing Sun Divine Sword erupted forth.

The tiger tried to flee, but Li Zhengjing's 200 strands of magic power, shaped by the Feathering Ascension Dragon Celestial Art, transformed into miniature dragons, blocking its escape. The dragons opened their maws, unleashing the Great Yan Void Transformation Sword Qi. In an instant, the tiger was riddled with holes, dead.

Li Zhengjing's blade descended upon the monk's skull.

But Buddhist light flared—the monk's skin turned gold as he activated his Arhat's Golden Body. He clasped his hands. "Vajra's Wrath!"

His eyes blazed with fire.

Li Zhengjing stepped back, his own pupils gleaming—Pure Radiance Golden Eyes met the flames head-on. Their gazes clashed, igniting the air.

Yet Li Zhengjing's blade continued its descent, each strike unleashing thunder.

"The Great Wrath Heretic Monk was to become a new Helm Master of the Golden Ship," the Young Sect Master called, effortlessly pressuring the dog demon. "Kill him today, and tomorrow I'll gift you something. Li Zhengjing, let's compete—whoever defeats their foe first wins. If I win, you join Kunlun."

Li Zhengjing, equally at ease against the monk, shouted back, "And if I slaughter this hog first?"

The Young Sect Master forced the dog demon back, pinning it down. "What do you want?"

"When you become Kunlun's next leader, I want a day in the treasure vault."

"Deal!"

No sooner had the Young Sect Master agreed than a chorus of dragon roars erupted behind him. He turned to see 25 golden dragons coiling around the Great Wrath Heretic Monk. Li Zhengjing plunged into the fray, his blade a whirlwind of death.

"Young Sect Master, I win!"
