# Chapter 42: Profound Yin Shadow Capture, Nail Head Life-Claiming

Rumble!

A violent wail, accompanied by increasingly intense spiritual energy fluctuations, surged from mid-air. Ouyang Haoze's eyes were bloodshot, clearly having gone berserk.

Seeing this, the other two late-stage Qi Cultivators from Divine Martial Sect, Wu Zhichong and Duanmu Yuan, couldn't sit still.

"Senior Brother Ouyang!"

Wu Zhichong stepped forward first, looking at Ouyang Haoze's current disheveled state with some trepidation. He whispered, "The Grand Empyrean Mirror is, after all, of great importance—"

"I understand." Ouyang Haoze glanced back at Wu Zhichong, the rage in his bloodshot eyes quickly subsiding. He calmly stated, "But that devil in the formation is even more important! He's proficient in formations at such a young age, and his cultivation isn't weak. If he breaks through to the perfected Qi Cultivation realm in the future, he might even be able to attempt Foundation Establishment."

"If we can kill a Demonic Sect's Foundation Establishment seed, then a Grand Empyrean Mirror, if lost, is lost!"

Buzz! Buzz!

In mid-air, the Grand Empyrean Mirror vibrated violently, seemingly expressing a differing opinion.

However, Ouyang Haoze turned a deaf ear. It was merely a spiritual treasure. When it's useful, you're called "Grand Empyrean Lord," but when you're not, what are you?

Seeing Ouyang Haoze's resolute demeanor, Wu Zhichong could only sigh and cease his attempts to dissuade him. After all, Ouyang Haoze, a perfected Qi Cultivator, was the primary person in charge of Divine Martial Sect's contingent this time. Since he had made a decision, he would naturally bear the consequences. Wu Zhichong had at least tried to advise him.

Meanwhile, inside the market town.

Lu Yang put away the Blood Sun Sword Pill, which was largely damaged by the explosion, and held the Innate One Qi Ten Thousand Spirit Banner. With an unreadable expression, he gazed at Ouyang Haoze outside the market town.

"Junior Brother Lu, you're not dead?" Immortal Feixia and Lu Yuanchun approached. One's face was filled with surprise, while the other, having survived the calamity, was also full of apprehension towards Lu Yang.

"Brother Lu truly hides his true abilities well!" Lu Yuanchun exclaimed loudly, "Now that Ouyang Haoze has been repelled, the market town can rest easy. It will be able to hold out until the Sacred Sect receives the news and sends reinforcements!"

"Repelled? It's too early to say." Lu Yang shook his head.

"Indeed, looking at Ouyang Haoze's state, his qi and blood are greatly depleted. It's not just a repulsion; he's clearly severely wounded! This counts as a profound lesson for him!" Immortal Feixia clapped her hands and laughed.

Upon hearing this, Lu Yuanchun also quickly chimed in with agreement.

However, Lu Yang scoffed, surprising them with his words: "Simply repelling him won't solve anything once and for all. I've never liked leaving future troubles."

"It's better to kill him. It's straightforward and simple!"

"Kill? Kill whom?" Ouyang Haoze?

For a moment, Immortal Feixia and Lu Yuanchun stood frozen, as such a scene had never appeared even in their most optimistic imaginations.

That was a perfected Qi Cultivator, a true disciple of a righteous path sect! Who could kill him? How could they kill him?

The next second, Lu Yang took out the "Profound Pylon Grand Yin Jade" that Lu Yuanchun had returned to him earlier. He formed hand seals and channeled energy into it, holding it in his palm.

Immediately after, the jade gradually melted under Lu Yang's control, finally transforming into a circular light, like a translucent, bone-white precious mirror. Under the illumination of the circular light, figures quickly appeared in Lu Yang's eyes, each figure corresponding to a residual aura.

From the reactions of others, it seemed only he could see them. Immortal Feixia, Lu Yuanchun, Ouyang Haoze, Wu Zhichong, Duanmu Yuan... everyone who had fought here had their residual aura present.

"This is the Profound Yin Shadow Capture Great Art..."

It was the second divine ability from the *Grand Yin Metamorphosis Corpse Dissolution True Art*. The only difficulty lay in the external object, which was why Lu Yang mastered it in an instant after obtaining the jade!

"Let's test its power." Lu Yang lowered his eyelids and quickly locked onto a residual aura—Ouyang Haoze's—which he then seized using the Profound Yin Shadow Capture Great Art.

"Profound Yin Shadow Capture..." Lu Yang activated the divine ability. The next second, the circular light formed by the Profound Pylon Grand Yin Jade swallowed Ouyang Haoze's aura and then projected his figure.

"...Nail Head Life-Claiming!" Immediately, Lu Yang brought his fingers together and slashed.

With a crisp "Crack!", the circular light split in two, and along with it, Ouyang Haoze's figure was also split into two halves, from head to toe.

To be safe, Lu Yang had sliced vertically.

Almost simultaneously.

Outside the market town, Ouyang Haoze had just finished his conversation with Wu Zhichong. He turned to look at the market town, then raised a hand and threw the Grand Empyrean Mirror into the formation.

Although the Grand Empyrean Mirror struggled violently, his mind was made up; he was about to detonate it.

But the next second, Ouyang Haoze's movements abruptly halted.

Immediately after, a bizarre slash mark appeared out of thin air above his head, then rapidly spread downwards, finally transforming into splattering blood.

He had split apart. His corpse fell from mid-air, only half of his face remaining, still etched with astonishment. His eyeballs subtly rolled, as if he hadn't yet realized what had just happened.

"What... what happened? Am I... dead?" His consciousness dissipated in bewilderment just like that.

And after losing Ouyang Haoze's control, the Grand Empyrean Mirror, which had fallen into the formation, returned to calm. Lu Yang extended a hand, and it voluntarily flew towards him.

Northern Frontier, Divine Martial Sect's main headquarters.

Inside a brightly lit grand hall.

This place was called the "Soul Lamp Hall." As the name suggested, it housed the soul lamps of various high-ranking members within the Divine Martial Sect, including the Sect Master, elders, and even true disciples.

As an old established power in the Northern Frontier, the Divine Martial Sect had ruled the region for over a millennium, its prestige deeply ingrained in the hearts of its people. Deaths among high-ranking members were rare. Thus, the disciples assigned to guard this place were mostly lax, viewing the position as an easy, well-paying job for sectarian subsidies.

Today, as usual, the patrolling disciple routinely checked the soul lamps.

Entering the hall, he scanned with a glance. Lit, lit, lit, lit, extinguished, lit, lit...

"Huh?" The patrolling disciple blinked, then subconsciously turned his head to look, rubbing his eyes afterward. The expression on his face gradually changed from casualness to terror.

"Extinguished! Senior Brother Ouyang's soul lamp has been extinguished!?" The sound instantly spread.

The next second, a middle-aged Daoist priest appeared out of thin air within the hall, his gaze falling upon the extinguished soul lamp, his face a mix of shock and fury.

How many years has it been? How many years since a true disciple of the Divine Martial Sect has died?

"Ouyang... Skeleton Mountain!?" The middle-aged Daoist's face was ashen. He suddenly extended a hand, retrieved Ouyang Haoze's soul lamp, and, channeling his magic power, forcefully reignited the lamp!

Of course, the dead cannot be resurrected. This reignited lamp could not save Ouyang Haoze's life; at most, it could re-manifest the last scene he witnessed before his death.

Soon, the lamp's light projected a scene. The middle-aged Daoist recognized it at a glance as the market town of the Primeval Sacred Sect on Skeleton Mountain. Within the market town, a handsome and elegant young man was gazing into the distant sky.

It was him? He killed Ouyang Haoze? Profound, bone-deep hatred surfaced in the middle-aged Daoist's eyes.

Because Ouyang Haoze was not just a true disciple of the sect; he was also the most outstanding young generation of his Ouyang clan, a junior upon whom he had placed great hopes!

This hatred, this enmity—it would be endless!

"Hmm?" Inside the Skeleton Mountain market town, Lu Yang, who had just put away the Grand Empyrean Mirror that had voluntarily submitted, suddenly furrowed his brow. He looked up at the sky, a chill rising in his heart.

He was very familiar with this feeling. It was the sensation of his karma being stirred by an external force. In his previous life, when the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord had divined his karma, he had experienced a similar feeling.

Could it be that another Foundation Establishment True Person was plotting against him!?
