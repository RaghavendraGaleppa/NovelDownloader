#23, The Note

As Li Zhi ming stood with his hands behind his back, he seemed to be in a trance, staring at a not-too-large and somewhat crude map. Meanwhile, Han Li was meticulously searching the room, his movements exuding the air of a seasoned operative. He examined every detail, from the desk to the books on it, with an intensity that suggested he was searching for something specific.

Before picking up a book, Han Li would carefully observe it, checking for any potential traps or hidden mechanisms. He would gently open the book, verifying that no toxic smoke or hidden objects would spring out. Only after ensuring it was safe would he briefly flip through its pages before carefully returning it to its original position.

Despite his caution, he found nothing out of the ordinary on the desk. The room seemed to have been left untouched for a long time, and Han Li couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something. He continued his search, methodically checking the drawers. His process was tediously deliberate, as he would only open a drawer a crack, then retreat a half meter away before slowly opening it further.

To his disappointment, the drawers contained only a few artifacts, some silver, and scattered notes. Han Li examined them but found nothing suspicious. If anything, his scrutiny only intensified his conviction that there must be more to this room than met the eye.

Undeterred, Han Li began to feel along the walls, searching for a hidden door or compartment. However, given his young age and limited experience, he found nothing after a good half-hour of searching. He decided to focus on the bookshelf, which was packed tightly with about two to three hundred books.

Standing before the bookshelf, Han Li observed the books carefully. What caught his attention was a book with slightly less dust on it than the others. Intrigued, he knelt down to examine it closer. As his hand approached the book, he noticed tiny, poison-tipped spikes on the cover's edge. 

Han Li was taken aback, his heart racing. He took a few deep breaths to calm himself before observing the book more carefully. He discovered an almost imperceptible thread connecting a page in the book to the bookshelf.

Without a doubt, this was the book he was looking for. Han Li gingerly opened the book, revealing not the contents of a typical book but a collection of disorganized notes. The papers were darkened and had been scribbled over in several places, with some sections completely blacked out.

"Little Four, come here!" Han Li called out to Li Zhi ming, who was still engrossed in the map.

Li Zhi ming walked over, curiosity etched on his face. "What's this?" he asked, nudging Han Li with his elbow.

Han Li remained silent, his eyes fixed on the notes. His complexion had turned pale, and his expression was grave. He seemed oblivious to Li Zhi ming's presence.

As Li Zhi ming waited for an answer, Han Li's grip on the book tightened. He slowly turned the page, revealing more notes stuck to the back. The realization of what he was holding seemed to weigh heavily on him, and his body began to sway slightly.

Li Zhi ming's question hung in the air, ignored by Han Li, who was too engrossed in the secrets the notes might hold.
