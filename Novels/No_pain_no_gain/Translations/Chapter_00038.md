# Chapter 38: Dark Spirit Root!

Such a young face, yet a cultivation of Qi Condensation Layer 11. The old man couldn't help but glance at him again. However, there were also cultivation methods in the immortal world that could preserve one's appearance, so the necessary procedures could not be skipped.

"Register your information here. Remember not to falsify anything, lest you win the championship only to be turned away," the old man said coldly. He then took out a jade slip from a bamboo tube, handed it to Han Zhen, and explained how to use it. The Seven Great Sects meticulously investigated and verified the background of every disciple to prevent spies from infiltrating.

Han Zhen followed the old man's instructions, focused his spiritual sense on the jade slip, and then truthfully left his information. "Han Zhen, a rogue cultivator from Caixia Mountain, Jingzhou. Basic cultivation method, Layer 11. Age: twenty."

The old man retrieved the jade slip and scanned it with his spiritual sense. He seemed to have heard of Caixia Mountain. Twirling the jade slip in his hand, he asked, "Is this the Caixia Mountain near the barbarian territory?"

"Yes, senior," Han Zhen replied respectfully.

The old man then motioned for Han Zhen to extend his hand, intending to observe Han Zhen's bone age using a bone-viewing technique. Upon learning that his spiritual power would be used for the investigation, Han Zhen's heart skipped a beat, and he hesitated for a moment. *Heaven Rewards Diligence — such a secret shouldn't be discoverable by Foundation Establishment cultivators, right?* Han Zhen secretly warned himself. Ever since he dealt with Old Man Mo, he had indeed been less cautious in recent years. But at this point, he could only brace himself and let the old man examine him.

The old man's cold finger pressed onto Han Zhen's wrist, transferring a wisp of his spiritual power into Han Zhen's body. Fortunately, this pure spiritual power only lingered for a moment before being withdrawn. The old man nodded with a satisfied expression, and Han Zhen's hanging heart finally settled.

Han Zhen originally thought this was the end of it. It seemed his outstanding talent hadn't moved the old man; he still had to fight for a spot. However, the old man did not tell Han Zhen to leave. Instead, he continued to ask, "Little friend, at such a young age, you've cultivated a basic wood-attribute cultivation method to such a degree. Do you have a master?"

*Sure enough, there was more to it!* Han Zhen pondered for a moment before replying, "This junior has no master. At the age of twelve, I joined the mortal gang, Seven Mysteries Sect. I stumbled upon a cultivation manual by chance and unexpectedly stepped into the immortal cultivation world, cultivating on my own until now." Han Zhen truthfully explained his experiences to date, specifically emphasizing the amount of time he had spent cultivating.

"Oh, so you've only been in the immortal cultivation world for eight years." The old man nodded, then suddenly slammed the table and looked up at Han Zhen as if he had discovered a rare treasure. "What?! You just said you only started cultivating at twelve?!"

Less than eight years, yet Qi Condensation Layer 11!

The old man, moving faster than Han Zhen could react, firmly grasped his arm and investigated him once more. "Have you used any pills, or perhaps accidentally consumed any rare spiritual treasures?"

"This junior has always relied on meditation for cultivation and has not depended on external objects. It was only in recent years that I learned about Tai Nan Valley's location and thus became aware of the existence of spirit veins." Han Zhen had not encountered any bottlenecks in his cultivation so far, so he indeed had not used any pills.

The old man nodded. Under his Heavenly Eye Art, Han Zhen's spiritual power was indeed incredibly deep and pure, clearly not accumulated through external means. "You should know that my Spirit Beast Mountain is near Caixia Mountain. Some things are very easy to investigate thoroughly," the old man said, his spiritual sense firmly locked onto Han Zhen, ready to immediately detect even the slightest abnormality.

"Senior, every word this junior has spoken is true," Han Zhen replied, his expression calm and his tone sincere.

At this, the old man's expression changed from shock to intense elation. He then, in front of Han Zhen, impatiently took out a sound transmission talisman, mumbled a few words, and a white light shot out from the hall. "Little friend, please wait a moment," the old man reassured Han Zhen. His own fingers, however, kept tapping on the table, showing his impatience, and he continued muttering something under his breath. Han Zhen vaguely heard words like "spirit root" and "reward." *Sure enough, his approach was correct.* Han Zhen's mind was filled with various thoughts, but his expression remained calm, devoid of joy or sorrow, as he waited in the hall.

The hall became incredibly quiet for a time. The old man's face returned to its usual composure, though the occasional fervent glance he cast towards Han Zhen revealed that he was still in a state of excitement.

A moment later, a bearded man, similarly dressed, rushed to the outside of the hall in a hurry, nearly knocking over several cultivators waiting to register. Upon seeing who it was, everyone became as quiet as cicadas in winter. Only after the bearded man entered the hall did they start discussing what was happening inside and why the person before them hadn't come out for so long.

As soon as the bearded cultivator entered the hall, he loudly called out to the old man, "Chen, is this the kid you said might have a Heavenly Spirit Root?"

Han Zhen's heart tightened. Although he had suspected he might possess a Heavenly Spirit Root, hearing it spoken by someone else felt different.

"I can't be certain, but at the very least, his spirit root talent won't be too bad." The bearded man and the old man seemed to have a good relationship, which was why he addressed him that way. The bearded man came to Han Zhen's side, scrutinized him from head to toe, then chuckled and patted his storage bag. A transparent, crystal-like magical artifact appeared in his hand. "Come, slowly transfer your spiritual power into this sphere until it glows."

The bearded man held the artifact in his hand and said to Han Zhen. Han Zhen complied. The bearded man mumbled incantations as he cast a spell, and then the artifact successively lit up with green, red, and blue lights. The old man surnamed Chen and the bearded man's expressions instantly turned to profound disappointment. They shook their heads and looked at Han Zhen with regret.

Just then. The three colors of light began to mix, once again drawing the attention of all three.

"Variant Spirit Root!" The bearded man seemed to have witnessed similar situations before, as he instantly blurted out the reason for the change within the spherical artifact. Ultimately, the transparent crystal artifact was stained a profound black, captivating to behold.

"This is...!" The old man surnamed Chen looked at the big bearded man with a hint of contemplation.

"If I'm not mistaken... this is the extremely rare Dark Spirit Root in the immortal cultivation world!!"

"Formed by the fusion and mutation of Water, Fire, and Wood spirit roots!" No sooner had the bearded man finished speaking than the old man surnamed Chen erupted in ecstasy once more. For Spirit Beast Mountain, the value of a Dark Spirit Root was no less than that of a Heavenly Spirit Root.

Han Zhen's heart surged with emotion for a moment. The question that had troubled him for eight years finally had an answer. But then, Han Zhen's heart sank, and he felt a little uneasy. Other spirit roots were fine, but this was a Dark Spirit Root—the best physique for cultivating demonic cultivation methods! However, this was Spirit Beast Mountain's home ground! Han Zhen thought of a crucial point: Spirit Beast Mountain itself originated from a major demonic sect. Furthermore, unlike the Masked Moon Sect which sought to separate from the Joyous Union Sect and become independent, Spirit Beast Mountain had always been a branch of the Spirit Controlling Sect, never severing its ties with them.

The most important thing for a variant spirit root was to have a matching cultivation method; otherwise, it would only offer faster cultivation speed and wouldn't allow one to contend with several cultivators of the same rank. Joining Spirit Beast Mountain would resolve this problem effortlessly. As for the Masked Moon Sect, they certainly had demonic cultivation methods, but Han Zhen couldn't quite agree with the sect's style. Even thinking of the appearance of Old Demon Yunlu, Han Zhen suddenly felt a chill.
