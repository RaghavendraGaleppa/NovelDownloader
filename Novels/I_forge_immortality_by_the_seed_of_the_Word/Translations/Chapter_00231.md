**Chapter 229: Nine Stellar Heavenly Stellar Dao Tablet**

“By Master’s command, construct the main peak’s Clear Scenery Palace first!”

Upon receiving Zhang Jing’s order, the Great Might Heavenly Artisan Ghost God numbered twenty-four, who had spoken first, instantly let out a loud roar.

In an instant, four massive, sky-obscuring figures slowly rose from the ground and walked directly towards Spirit Pivot Mountain’s highest peak, right beneath Zhang Jing.

*Thump! Thump!*

The ground began to tremble incessantly.

On the peak, Zhang Jing withdrew his gaze, a hint of paleness visible on his face. The strike he had used earlier to forcefully break through the newly formed spiritual land’s protective array, while terrifyingly powerful—even transcending an entire major realm—had consumed an equally astonishing amount of energy. Even the thirty-six layers of illusory worlds within his innate divine ability, the Grand Unity Heavenly Stellar Gods’ Natal World, visibly withered and dimmed.

Carefully sensing his internal state, a helpless smile surfaced on Zhang Jing’s face.

“Even with the Primordial Immortal Cores and Void Furnaces in the thirty-six layers of illusory worlds operating at full capacity, churning out a mana torrent hundreds of times greater than a typical Core Formation realm cultivator’s total mana, it was still completely drained by that single strike I unleashed.”

“This…”

Zhang Jing was somewhat at a loss for words.

Among the contributing factors, the Immortal Binding Chain indeed consumed a vast amount of energy. However, he felt that the fundamental reason for the extreme depletion was likely the forceful activation of the Grand Pure Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade, a great divine ability.

“Perhaps only when the first layer of my Natal World fully manifests will I be able to act without restraint, unconcerned about consumption,” Zhang Jing mused to himself, a hint of longing flashing in his heart.

At this moment, he couldn't help but recall his master’s teachings on the path of cultivation and gained a deeper understanding of the phrase, ‘I behold Heaven and Earth.’

Zhang Jing knew that his current awkward predicament was essentially due to his cultivation failing to keep pace with his mastery of various Dao laws and principles. Logically, the Grand Pure Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade was a terrifying divine ability that Core Formation cultivators should not even be able to cultivate. The Dao laws and principles contained within it were too profound and vast. For a Core Formation cultivator, merely comprehending them was as difficult as ascending to heaven, let alone sensing or cultivating them.

After all, the cultivation path of this world—Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Dharma Idol, Dao Integration—these cultivation realms essentially represent different ways and depths of ‘observing’ the various operational principles of Heaven and Earth.

The higher the realm, the more intuitive and closer to their original form the Dao laws and principles a cultivator ‘sees’ become. Under normal circumstances, higher realms naturally imply a more terrifying mastery of Dao laws and principles. However, there is no absolute causal relationship here. In other words, a higher realm merely allows cultivators to ‘see’ various Dao and principles more clearly and profoundly. But the actual extent to which one can comprehend and master them still depends on individual fortune. This is one reason why two cultivators of the same realm can have vastly different strengths.

According to his master, the true cultivation realm divisions were: Mortal, Heavenly Immortal Dao Fruit, Golden Immortal Dao Fruit…

Anyone who had not attained the Heavenly Immortal stage was merely mortal. Once their great limit arrived, they would have to endure the suffering of reincarnation, adrift in the sea of suffering among all beings!

***

An unknown amount of time passed. Zhang Jing slowly came to his senses. Under the operation of the thirty-six Primordial Immortal Cores and Void Furnaces within the illusory worlds behind him, his mana had now fully recovered.

Shifting his gaze, he saw the four Great Might Heavenly Artisan Ghost Gods still busily working, either diligently constructing the magnificent palace that was nearing completion or continuously transporting immortal materials from the void. Zhang Jing nodded in satisfaction. Employing these Heavenly Artisan Ghost Gods had cost him a full eighty million points of luck, making his heart ache. But now, it seemed, while they were indeed expensive, they were worth the price.

***

A bright streak of light suddenly flashed across the sky. About fifteen minutes later, Zhang Jing’s figure gently landed on another peak thousands of miles away. Only then did he recall that, after the Spirit of the Flowing Light Immortal Realm announced Spirit Pivot Mountain had become his Daoist sanctuary, he had subtly gained a special sensation.

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing closed his eyes and concentrated. At the center of his brows, the Chaos Dao Seal, glowing with a faint purple hue, involuntarily reappeared. Immediately after, he perceived a mysterious connection suddenly forming between himself and Spirit Pivot Mountain, which stretched for a hundred thousand miles beneath his feet.

It was an extremely peculiar feeling. The entire Spirit Pivot Mountain presented itself vividly before him. From immortal peaks that pierced the clouds to grains of sand and dust—anything within Spirit Pivot Mountain, or rather, within his Daoist sanctuary—Zhang Jing could know with a single thought. It was incredibly miraculous.

And there was more—

The massive amounts of immortal qi and spiritual energy pervading the Daoist sanctuary also seemed to be at his command.

“Nearly absolute control, is this the power of a Daoist sanctuary master? No wonder the Spirit of the Flowing Light Immortal Realm made that special declaration at the end.” A hint of astonishment flashed in Zhang Jing’s eyes. At this moment, he instantly understood why establishing a Daoist sanctuary was a unique privilege of Dao Sect true disciples, and why Senior Brother Feng Wuyu had repeatedly emphasized the importance of establishing one. Compared to the immortal island within his master’s cave-heaven, the Daoist sanctuary was undoubtedly the most suitable place for true disciples to cultivate, especially a Daoist sanctuary established within a prime spiritual land!

Wait! Is that—

As if discovering something, Zhang Jing suddenly opened his eyes, a look of excitement flashing across his face. The next instant, his figure flickered, and he appeared directly before a three-foot-long and wide stone tablet several thousand feet away, which emanated profound and ancient aura.

The tablet was entirely interwoven with black and white, emitting wisps of crystalline immortal light. Etched on its surface was a miraculous pattern composed of thirty-six vast stars. As the stars rotated, they subtly revealed some extremely profound Dao and principles.

“This is the innate divine object that is the source of the grand array enveloping Spirit Pivot Mountain?” Zhang Jing thought to himself, a look of certainty in his eyes. Without much hesitation, he extended his hand and gently placed it on the stone tablet, his immense divine sense permeating his body and instantly covering it.

Time passed by. Perhaps because it was an ownerless divine object, or perhaps because it was within his own Daoist sanctuary, Zhang Jing effortlessly refined the stone tablet this time. The moment the refinement was successful, a piece of information suddenly appeared in his mind.

A short while later, “The Nine Stellar Heavenly Stellar Dao Tablet, born from the core of innate stars in the Nine Stellar Realm, contains the innate Heavenly Stellar Dao principles, subtly drawing immeasurable Primordial Stellar Power…”

Zhang Jing’s eyes suddenly gleamed. The Nine Stellar Realm! Yet another unfamiliar world. And for it to appear within the Clear Heavens Profound Brightness Heaven, there was only one possibility—it was captured by a great power of the Dao Sect and transformed into a secret realm.

It seemed his previous thoughts were indeed correct. Zhang Jing let out a light breath. The Spirit Pivot Mountain spiritual land should be one of the many products of this Nine Stellar Realm, which had been transformed into a secret realm, completely integrating into the Clear Heavens Profound Brightness Heaven.

“Clear Heavens Profound Brightness Heaven, and even the Human Race’s Seven Great Heavens, and the Eleven Vast Heavens of the Myriad Spirits Faction of All Heavens, the most magnificent Chaos Profound Yellow Heaven… With so many heavens, how many worlds has the Profound Yellow Realm captured over countless eons?”

Zhang Jing exclaimed in his heart. As he was pondering, a strange sensation suddenly arose in his mind. That was! He instantly snapped back to attention. He then discovered that, at some unknown point, the thirty-six layers of illusory worlds behind him had begun to tremble incessantly, as if something were attracting them.

In just a flash, he cast his gaze upon the Dao tablet he had just refined. The Nine Stellar Heavenly Stellar Dao Tablet!

“It can actually cause a phenomenon in the Grand Unity Heavenly Stellar Gods’ Natal World. Is there some connection between the two?” A thoughtful expression flashed in Zhang Jing’s eyes.

Then, he took a deep breath, and the thirty-six layers of illusory worlds behind him instantly burst forth with brilliant light, engulfing the Nine Stellar Heavenly Stellar Dao Tablet in an instant. After two or three breaths, the Dao tablet, which had been standing perfectly fine before him, had vanished. In contrast, within the first layer of his Natal World, a Dao tablet emitting crystalline immortal light quietly appeared, standing serenely.

Tens of thousands of streams of rich Primordial Stellar Power continuously appeared out of thin air around the Nine Stellar Heavenly Stellar Dao Tablet, then slowly diffused throughout the Natal World. The speed of the first layer of the Natal World’s evolution visibly accelerated in an instant.

“This—” Witnessing this astonishing scene, Zhang Jing’s eyes suddenly froze.
