# Chapter 16: The Righteous Sun Spell

Mid-Shen hour (around 4 PM).  
Courtyard No. 1.  

Ning Jingming examined the white-robed man lying on the jade bed and couldn't help but ask, "What kind of ghostly entity did Fellow Daoist Zhao encounter? To be contaminated with such potent yin energy..."  

The white-robed man was as pristine as snow, his peach-blossom eyes carrying an ineffable melancholy. His face, more delicate than a woman's, had skin like congealed jade. A faint, bitter smile played on his lips, evoking an eerie sense of pitiable fragility.  

*This man is unnervingly enchanting,* Ning Jingming thought.  

Not only were the two female cultivators—one in a yellow dress with an oval face and the other in a black dress with a瓜子脸 (melon-seed face)—attending to him with deep affection on either side, but even Ning Jingming, a man himself, felt momentarily dazed. He had to circulate his spiritual energy to calm himself.  

Had it not been for the fact that the white-robed man and the two women were all at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement and wore the outer disciple tokens of the Hundred Talismans Sect—one of the seven great sects of the Misty Cloud Kingdom—Ning Jingming might have suspected they were demonic cultivators.  

The Hundred Talismans Sect was the only eclectic major sect among the seven, renowned for its foundational inheritance—the *Eight Desolations Talisman Scripture*.  

"A ghostly fan," the white-robed man said with lingering fear. "It could transform into a spectral wind, striking unpredictably. My companions and I had been traveling day and night to get here, exhausted and off guard. That's how I fell victim."  

"The injury is severe, and your body is extremely weak. Moreover, the yin energy seems to be draining your vitality and spiritual power. We can't delay treatment." Ning Jingming pondered briefly before continuing, "My *Righteous Sun Spell* is too forceful. Let's have someone restore your vitality first. Once your condition stabilizes slightly, I'll use the spell to purge the yin energy."  

"Fellow Daoist Ning, please proceed as you see fit," the white-robed man said magnanimously.  

Ning Jingming nodded and turned to the three junior physicians behind him. Among them was a sweet-faced female physician in a green dress and short skirt, resembling the girl next door. She was newly recruited, possessing a rejuvenation spell with sixteen layers of spell restrictions—a decent finger technique. Whenever male cultivators needed recovery, Ning Jingming would assign her to the task.  

Afterward, she would offer subtle fingertip massages, providing just the right touch of human warmth to elevate the service.  

Of course, if the patient was a female cultivator, he would summon Wang Chan instead.  

Since the incident some time ago, Ning Jingming had realized a simple truth—men and women working together made labor lighter.  

What had started as an experiment unexpectedly attracted more patients.  

The green-robed female physician had been stealing glances at the white-robed man. When Ning Jingming looked her way, she was on the verge of eagerly accepting the task.  

But then Ning Jingming noticed the subtle displeasure in the expressions of the two women beside the white-robed man. Changing his mind, he turned to the braided female cultivator instead.  

"Yizhi, please go fetch Fellow Daoist Wang."  

"...Understood!" The braided woman, Qi Yizhi, hesitated briefly before hurrying off.  

---  

At the thatched stall.  

A burly man with a short, flat haircut and a thick beard approached, complaining of disrupted qi flow during cultivation. He wanted Wang Chan to perform acupuncture to regulate his energy.  

Though this was only the second patient of the day, Wang Chan was reluctant to take the case. Treating qi disruption required full-body acupuncture—a time-consuming process of at least an hour, demanding immense patience.  

Glancing at the sky, Wang Chan noted it was already mid-Shen hour. At this time of year, dusk would fall by mid-You hour (around 6 PM). He had no intention of traveling home in the dark—it was far too dangerous.  

Moreover, patrols would clear the market at the start of Hai hour (9 PM), forbidding cultivators from staying overnight to ensure smooth operations the next day.  

Every rule here had been forged through countless lives and bloodshed over the years. Disobedience was not an option.  

"Your condition isn't severe. Why not return tomorrow morning? I have urgent matters to attend to and must take my leave. My apologies."  

Wang Chan clasped his hands in apology.  

The bearded cultivator sighed in disappointment, returned the gesture, and left.  

Packing up, locking the stall, and hanging the sign—all done in one smooth motion.  

As Wang Chan dusted off his hands, preparing to leave, Qi Yizhi arrived, her braid swaying.  

"Fellow Daoist Wang, Physician Ning requests your assistance with a treatment."  

Lately, Ning Jingming had summoned him often—sometimes two or three times a day when busy.  

Of course, the compensation wasn't always two spirit coins. The beauty-mark incident had been a special case.  

Now, depending on the situation and effort required, payment ranged from twenty to thirty spirit pearls, with a maximum of fifty.  

Even so, the income was far better than what he earned from his stall.  

Given Ning Jingming's patronage, Wang Chan usually obliged.  

But now, with daylight fading, getting home safely took priority.  

Still, Wang Chan didn't refuse outright. He inquired about the case and learned it involved rejuvenating a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator. The treatment would likely take at least half an hour.  

"Fellow Daoist Qi, treating a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator will take considerable time. My home is far from the Black River, and I must return before nightfall. Traveling after dark is unsafe."  

Qi Yizhi didn't press him. She asked him to wait while she consulted Ning Jingming again.  

Soon, she returned.  

"Physician Ning says your *Rejuvenation Needles* work quickly. If all goes well, the treatment will take less than an incense stick's time. Afterward, you may leave immediately. The payment is fifty spirit pearls."  

An incense stick's time (about five minutes) wouldn't delay him much. Wang Chan nodded and followed.  

---  

Later, by the jade bed.  

Seeing that Wang Chan—a handsome young man—would be performing the rejuvenation, the two female disciples of the Hundred Talismans Sect relaxed slightly. In looks and bearing, this physician wasn't much inferior to their senior brother.  

Noticing this, Ning Jingming smirked inwardly. *Ah, women.*  

After assessing the situation, Wang Chan greeted Ning Jingming and the white-robed man courteously before getting to work. He took out three *Withering-Life Needles*, activated their thirteen artifact restrictions, and channeled the rejuvenating power of verdant wood essence through precise insertions.  

As expected, within half a cup of tea's time, the pale-faced man's cheeks regained color—a sign of restored yang energy warming his chilled body.  

"That's enough, but don't remove the needles yet!" Ning Jingming said gravely.  

Wang Chan nodded and stepped aside.  

Ning Jingming approached, channeled his spiritual power, and began reciting incantations. A series of hand seals sent golden ripples into the white-robed man's body, enveloping him in a sacred glow.  

Simultaneously, wisps of smoke-like yin energy were expelled from his body.  

The golden light radiated warmth. Standing nearby, Wang Chan felt as though he were beside a furnace. The glow dispelled his fears and worries.  

*Is this the mid-tier spell—Righteous Sun Spell?*  

Wang Chan envied silently. Mid-tier spells not only had stronger restrictions than low-tier ones but also higher ceilings—up to fifty-four layers.  

Judging by the ripples, Ning Jingming had unleashed about forty-two layers effortlessly.  

After a dozen breaths, the golden ripples cycled repeatedly through the white-robed man's body, driving the last remnants of yin energy toward his face. The pale smoke, now spent, wouldn't last much longer.  

Wang Chan sighed in relief. Barring surprises, he could leave soon with his payment.  

Just as the golden light neared completion, the white-robed man's face suddenly turned ashen. Gray yin patterns, like birthmarks, spread from the corners of his eyes to his mouth.  

In an instant, he looked as ghastly as a vengeful spirit.
