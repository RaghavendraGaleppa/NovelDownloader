# Chapter 43: Provincial Champion  

Today was the day the examination results would be announced. As usual, Zhou Qing practiced the Five Animals Exercise and the Tiger-Crane Double Form Fist. His skills grew increasingly refined with each session.  

Even if the evaluation from his cultivation manual, *The Art of Nurturing Life*, did not immediately improve, Zhou Qing's powerful spiritual sense allowed him to keenly perceive the subtle enhancements to his physical constitution brought about by these exercises.  

Seeking scholarly honors was to establish his standing in society, and establishing his standing was to pursue longevity.  

With the provincial examination concluded, all that remained was to await the results.  

The waiting period was best spent practicing martial arts and studying.  

Moreover, time passed quickly when immersed in training and reading.  

In the first few days, Zhou Qing had considered asking his senior brother, Fu Song, to spar with him and demonstrate the power of Gang Qi. However, Fu Song adamantly refused, explaining that Gang Qi consumed vital energy and, if used excessively in a short period, could even shorten one's lifespan.  

If one were young and brimming with vitality, there would be less cause for concern—so long as the expenditure was not excessive, recovery would be swift.  

When Zhou Qing inquired about how to cultivate Gang Qi, Fu Song merely advised him to continue practicing the *Spring Revival Scripture* and recited a mantra:  

*"The heart aligns with intent, intent aligns with qi, qi aligns with strength. Internal yin and external yang merge into a single breath."*  

In essence, understanding would come naturally when the time was right. Before then, comprehension alone was useless.  

Zhou Qing realized that his senior brother simply thought his skills were not yet sufficient.  

However, Fu Song did praise Zhou Qing's footwork, remarking that if it had been three or five years earlier, Zhou Qing might have been able to assassinate him without him realizing it.  

The implication was that Fu Song's spiritual perception had grown stronger over the years, and while Zhou Qing's footwork was impressive, it still had flaws detectable by Fu Song's heightened awareness.  

Zhou Qing agreed with this assessment.  

Although his Ghost Steps had reached a proficient level, they had not yet fully integrated with the *Breeze Scripture*. Thus, this combined movement technique had yet to achieve the "formless and shadowless" realm.  

Early in the morning, Fu Song recited a line from the *Book of Changes*:  

*"The ninth line, fifth position: The dragon soars in the heavens, favorable to meet great men."*  

Zhou Qing thought to himself, *Senior brother really knows how to speak—no wonder he’s the head of Qingfu Palace.* After passing the provincial examination, he had half a mind to suggest reorganizing Qingfu Palace’s structure, though he wasn’t sure if Fu Song would agree.  

Zhi Shan and the others were still relatively young and skilled—they shouldn’t remain in the mountains forever.  

The fifth line of the Qian hexagram in the *Book of Changes* carried excellent symbolism.  

The first part meant that the time was ripe—if one was a dragon, they should ascend to the heavens. It was no longer a time to lurk in the depths. He needed to seize the moment to fully realize his talents and ambitions.  

The latter part, *"favorable to meet great men,"* indicated that while he was in a favorable position, he must remain cautious and value the power of teamwork. No matter how capable an individual was, they could not succeed without external support.  

For instance, managing the foundation of his livelihood, gathering cultivation resources, and defending against potential threats and enemies all required external aid.  

Take the incident with Zhang Shen, for example—without Martial Escort Leader Wu’s involvement, Zhou Qing would not have been able to cleanly resolve the matter.  

Zhou Qing concluded his training.  

"Then I’ll take your auspicious words to heart, senior brother. Once I return home as a provincial graduate, I’ll have Zhi Shan and the others come down the mountain to celebrate with me."  

Fu Song smiled. "Even if you hadn’t mentioned it, I was planning to send them down. From now on, those lads will need your guidance."  

Zhou Qing laughed. "If I hadn’t passed, would they have stayed in the mountains?"  

Fu Song chuckled. "How could you possibly fail?"  

The two exchanged knowing smiles.  

However, neither went to check the results in person. Escort Leader Wu had insisted on being the first to bring the good news, believing it would bring him luck for the year ahead. Those in the escort business placed great faith in fortune.  

Wu was convinced that delivering the news of Zhou Qing’s success would ensure smooth journeys for his escort missions throughout the year.  

*The year’s fortune is determined by its beginning—it must start auspiciously!*  

Of course, it wasn’t just about luck.  

Being the first to announce Zhou Qing’s success would also signal their close relationship to the martial and official circles, where information traveled fast. This would bring tangible benefits.  

Zhou Qing was still young. Passing the provincial examination now meant he would eventually take the metropolitan examination and become a high-ranking official.  

A forty-year-old second-tier metropolitan graduate could reasonably expect to rise to the highest echelons of government—let alone Zhou Qing, who was not yet sixteen. His future was boundless.  

However, Zhou Qing had no intention of sitting for the metropolitan examination anytime soon.  

As the saying went, *"A provincial graduate is gold, a metropolitan graduate is silver."* For him, this held true.  

But given his youth, even if he waited eight or ten years before attempting the metropolitan examination, people would only praise his patience, enhancing his scholarly reputation.  

After all, a young provincial graduate abstaining from the metropolitan examination meant one less formidable competitor. The elder scholars would surely heap praise upon him, urging other young graduates to *"leave opportunities for their seniors."*  

Hence, the elders often admonished the young not to be too aggressive—this was likely the reason.  

Before long, the sound of firecrackers erupted in the inn’s front courtyard.  

Fu Song rose excitedly, while Zhou Qing remained seated, calmly reading a volume of the *Analects*. Reading nurtured the spirit—even after passing the provincial examination, he had no intention of stopping.  

Fu Song went to the door and listened intently with his heightened senses before returning with a curse. "It’s just a wedding."  

Today was the day the provincial examination results were announced—naturally an auspicious occasion.  

A wedding held today was doubly fortunate.  

The wedding night was also called the "minor ascension," while passing the metropolitan examination was the "grand ascension." Still, becoming a provincial graduate was akin to a carp leaping through the Dragon Gate.  

---

Outside the inn, gongs and drums clamored, firecrackers boomed, and the clip-clop of hooves echoed from the front courtyard to the rear where Zhou Qing and Fu Song resided.  

"Someone has passed! It’s our inn!" the innkeeper and waiters exclaimed excitedly.  

Children outside gleefully scrambled to pick up scattered coins, cheering, "Someone’s passed the provincial exam!"  

The inn’s main hall buzzed with excitement. Onlookers crowded into the rear courtyard, accidentally knocking over wine jars. The yellow clay seals cracked, and liquor seeped through the paper, spilling across the ground.  

The innkeeper winced at the loss but rejoiced nonetheless—his establishment was about to gain fame.  

"Master Zhou, please open the door! Congratulations on your success!" It was Escort Leader Wu knocking.  

He was more exhilarated than on his own wedding night—because this was the *provincial champion*!  

Hearing this, Fu Song grinned. "Junior brother, this time it’s real."  

He hurried to open the door, but in his excitement, he accidentally tore the door off its hinges.  

Zhou Qing remained composed as he stood to receive the news.  

Then—*crack!*  

Lately, he had been practicing Ghost Steps too diligently, and his training shoes had just split apart.  

*So much for dignity.*  

But no one cared. The crowd surged in jubilantly.  

Escort Leader Wu, clutching the announcement, stammered excitedly, "You passed! Congratulations, Master Zhou!"  

Moments later, a dozen yamen runners rushed in, announcing the magistrate’s arrival.  

Commoners and merchants, fearful of officials, hastily made way.  

Magistrate Feng of Hengbo County, clad in his seventh-rank blue official robes, arrived with a procession bearing the champion’s plaque and ceremonial attire.  

Entering the courtyard, he beamed at Zhou Qing. "I, Feng Zhiyuan, Magistrate of Hengbo County, congratulate you, esteemed brother, on achieving first rank in this year’s provincial examination. May your name grace the golden list in the capital!"  

The assembled officials echoed the sentiment.  

Song Hecai’s expression softened as he smiled. "A youthful provincial champion is a rare marvel. Those of us who witness it may earn a footnote in history. Especially you, Brother Fengxian—as the talent scout, you are truly enviable."  

Chief Examiner Lu chuckled. "You are the chief examiner, my lord. If I am the talent scout, you are even more so."  

The two shared a knowing smile.  

This incident had forged an unspoken bond between them.  

After all, it was a minor scandal—one that would reflect poorly on both if exposed.  

Naturally, Zhou Qing would need careful guidance moving forward. His literary talent was undeniable, but Chief Examiner Lu worried that the young man’s exuberance might lead him to attend literary gatherings and produce subpar work, inviting criticism.  

The day after the results were announced, a celebratory banquet—the "Deer Cry Feast"—would be held.  

Once Zhou Qing paid his respects today, he would need to be reminded to prepare diligently and avoid any missteps.  

*Youth is so worrisome.* Chief Examiner Lu feared Zhou Qing might become complacent and reckless.  

The matter of the provincial champion was settled beyond dispute.  

Soon, the thirty successful candidates were finalized.  

In this world, the number of provincial graduates was far fewer than in Zhou Qing’s previous life, where a single province might produce eighty.  

Thus, the title held greater prestige—though this was partly due to the influence of military nobles in court.  

Political power was finite—more for civil officials meant less for military nobles.  

But with fewer provincial graduates, their local influence grew disproportionately.  

Many who had no hope of becoming metropolitan graduates—or even county magistrates—remained in their hometowns, exploiting the common folk and transforming ordinary families into local magnates.  

---

Early that morning, Magistrate Feng waited in the yamen’s main hall. Once the provincial champion’s name was announced, he would lead his runners to present the plaque and ceremonial attire, escorting the new champion to the examination hall to pay respects to the chief and deputy examiners.  

But there was an unfortunate complication.  

Old Scholar Zhang, a provincial graduate from Jiangzhou, had learned of his son’s death and rushed to Changzhou on horseback. Leveraging his family’s connections, he even produced a name card from the Transport Commissioner of Tiannan Circuit to gain an audience.  

Faced with a superior’s name card, Magistrate Feng had no choice but to receive him.  

Zhang began cordially, "Esteemed brother, though I seldom travel far, I regret not having visited sooner. Please accept this humble gift."  

Magistrate Feng waved it off. "Master Zhang, we are not examination-year peers. There’s no need for such courtesy."  

Zhang’s expression darkened, but he pressed on. "That servant boy was always honest and dutiful. I refuse to believe he harmed my son. I implore you to investigate thoroughly and deliver justice. My family would be eternally grateful."  

Magistrate Feng replied, "The evidence clearly points to the servant. Do not be deceived, elder."  

Suppressing his anger, Zhang retorted, "I’ve already reported the matter to the Transport Commissioner. That Zhou Qing is highly suspect—and merely a lowly licentiate. Summon him for questioning and see if he has a guilty conscience!"  

Magistrate Feng demurred, "Today is the results announcement. I must soon fetch the provincial champion."  

Zhang sighed. "You fear he might pass, complicating matters? Very well—once the results confirm his failure, issue a warrant for his arrest."  

Magistrate Feng frowned. "Why are you so certain he won’t pass?"  

Zhang scoffed. "Zhou Qing was Chief Examiner Lu’s top candidate in the preliminary exams. At barely sixteen, granting him a provincial degree would tarnish Lu’s reputation. Besides, having just passed the preliminaries, how could he possibly succeed now?"  

He added, "I’ve also heard he’s obsessed with martial arts, neglecting his studies. His chances are nil."  

Magistrate Feng hesitated. With the Transport Commissioner’s name card in play, if Zhou Qing remained a licentiate, refusing to summon him would be difficult.  

But he feared Zhang had further schemes.  

For now, he could only stall until the results arrived.  

The names were announced from lowest to highest—twenty-five on the main list, five on the supplementary.  

As name after name was read without Zhou Qing’s, Magistrate Feng began to doubt Escort Leader Wu’s claims.  

*Had Zhou Qing truly failed?*  

Enduring the Transport Commissioner’s pressure to reopen the case and exonerate Zhou Qing would be arduous—and costly.  

Finally, only the champion’s name remained.  

Zhang smirked. "You see now? Zhou Qing couldn’t have passed—unless he became a provincial champion at fifteen. With Chief Examiner Lu as deputy, do you really think that possible?"  

Magistrate Feng sighed but before he could respond, a distant runner announced:  

"Master Zhou Qing has achieved first rank in the Bingzi Provincial Examination, topping the list. May his name grace the golden list in the capital!"  

Instantly, Magistrate Feng changed his tune. "Master Zhang, the provincial champion is a reincarnated Star of Literature. How could he possibly harm your son? Do not delude yourself."  

Old Scholar Zhang spat a mouthful of blood and collapsed unconscious!  

Without a second glance, Magistrate Feng rose. "Come, let us greet the new champion."
