Chapter 131: The Yellow Dragon Approaches, Yihe Manor in Danger

That late night, Li Xian felt his physical strength was abundant. He practiced with blades and spears, threw punches and palms, and executed several martial arts techniques, yet his energy showed no signs of depletion.

Instead, he felt increasingly exhilarated and comfortable.

A martial artist's strength comes from physical power and the Qi from the Qi Lake. These two complement each other and are rarely distinguished in daily life. Only when practicing unique martial arts are they differentiated.

Physical power refers to strength purely burst forth from flesh and blood. Ordinary people plowing fields, carrying firewood, pushing mills, and pulling carts use physical power. This power is simple and unadorned, yet it is the foundation.

The Qi from the Qi Lake is the extension and divinity of physical power, adding bricks and tiles, or "icing on the cake." Relying solely on physical power, it is difficult to lift huge stones or raise giant tripods. However, a martial artist with refined internal Qi, by utilizing internal Qi and combining strength with Qi, can achieve such feats.

Li Xian's physical power had increased significantly. His energy was vigorous, like a young dragon. His foundation was solid, and he was less prone to fatigue. The combination of Qi and power came naturally.

[Proficiency +2]
[Proficiency +2]

[Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword]
[Proficiency: 3569/6000 Minor Accomplishment]

[Great Luo Blade]
[Proficiency: 15/10000 Perfection]

Although Li Xian intended to slow down his practice of the Great Luo Blade, because martial arts境界 never regress, he would occasionally execute it slightly, and his proficiency kept accumulating. As natural as water flowing, he broke through to the realm of Perfection.

The blade technique returned to its original simplicity, and his blade momentum surged freely.

"With such diligent and arduous practice, one day I will be able to glimpse a higher realm!"

Li Xian was full of ambition. Seeing the night was deep, he poured clear water over his body to wash away the sweat.

Just as he was about to sleep comfortably.

This residence was near a lake. The disadvantage was that the humidity was too heavy, but the advantage was that it was cool at night. For Li Xian, the disadvantage could be ignored. After circulating Qi through the meridians, ordinary water vapor could not invade his body.

Lying in bed to rest, his mind relaxed.

He thought of his younger brother making a name for himself and having already obtained destiny. He was not inferior to himself as the elder brother, and Li Xian was filled with pride.

He also heard that... his younger brother's master seemed to be named Fu Haoran, a very powerful figure. Although he did not practice martial arts, even the Madam had to respect him somewhat.

He had asked the Madam about the matter of destiny. The Madam only casually mentioned it, but it gave Li Xian a rough understanding.

Destiny has two sources.

Seizing the world's destiny with literary Qi.

Inheritance from family and sect through the generations.

Each is hard-won. Even in these chaotic times, as long as one grasps a single strand, it is enough to ensure one's family is worry-free, with enough food and clothing, and a place to live.

He closed his eyes, about to sleep.

Suddenly, he felt the bed board tremble slightly. Li Xian frowned and placed his hand on the bed board. He confirmed it was not an illusion; the tremor was rising and falling. Left and right shaking could be a natural earthquake. Rising and falling... it seemed like... a thousand troops and ten thousand horses were rushing over.

"Could it be that my words came true? Has the Yellow Dragon Army truly arrived?"

Li Xian immediately put on his clothes and summoned the guards, staff, and servants of the manor.

Because they had been on guard early on, although everyone was panicking, they did not lose their discipline.

Li Xian said loudly, "The Yellow Dragon Army is brutal by nature. Wherever they pass, all living things are scorched. Our manor is located in a remote place. I reckon they might not easily discover it. Everyone, do not panic."

"Each of you, go out of the manor and block some key roads. Ding Hu, you bring the tenant farmers into the manor as quickly as possible. Distribute weapons to them."

"Gather all our strength. If it really comes to the final stage, we will fight the Yellow Dragon Army head-on!"

Li Xian already had a plan.

Although the manor had high walls, they could not compare to city gates. It naturally could not stop a thousand troops and ten thousand horses. If he abandoned the manor and entered the county... heh heh... the Madam's methods were not more merciful than the Yellow Dragon Army.

The only option was to hide. That was why he had long ago moved roads and transplanted trees, hiding the manor deep inside.

If they could not hide, they had to rely on the mountain and forest terrain to fight with them. At least until the Madam finished her seclusion, then listen to her opinion.

Li Xian pondered and personally sat in command, arranging the manor's affairs properly.

Not long after, the tenant farmers from various villages arrived at the manor, also bringing grain.

Li Xian said, "Now the rebel army is causing chaos. Wherever they pass, they burn, kill, and loot. Only by joining forces with us can you survive this calamity!"

When he was at Black River Village, he had already shown a hint of leadership. Now, he revealed his [Heavy Pupil Appearance]. Even though he intentionally hid his heavy pupils, his temperament still convinced everyone.

In times of chaos, when people are panicked and confused, they seek to attach themselves to the strong.

Li Xian displayed the posture and will of a strong man, so he was not afraid of not being able to subdue everyone.

The many guards of Yihe Manor, having experienced various events, were increasingly convinced by Li Xian. Now, seeing the sudden chaos and Li Xian shouldering the great responsibility, looking divine and mighty, they all obeyed his orders without question.

Li Xian mobilized everyone, arranging for people to keep watch, dig traps... and so on. He himself was not idle either. Traveling lightly, he left Yihe Manor.

Yihe Manor was dozens of miles away from Qingning County. Qingning County's terrain was full of mountains and forests, with many obstacles, so it might not be discovered.

Li Xian knew that the Yellow Dragon Army must be heading for Qingning County. He did not dare to get too close. After walking more than ten miles, he saw a high mountain peak.

An idea struck him: "My eyesight is extraordinary. With the high vantage of the mountain peak, I can see the situation in Qingning County. And I won't be afraid of being discovered!"

He immediately leaped up and climbed the steep mountain path. The higher the mountain, the fewer the paths.

In the latter half, he could only grab protruding rocks and climb up. Li Xian circulated Qi to his hands, firmly sticking to the rock face, and nimbly climbed to a high place. The temperature was already extremely cold, and the wind was very strong. Frost formed on his eyelashes.

Clouds and mist shrouded the area.

The Heavy Pupil Appearance manifested.

His gaze pierced through the clouds, and indeed, he saw the Yellow Dragon Army surrounding Qingning County.

The Yellow Dragon Army wore yellow armor, and their flags were embroidered with a yellow true dragon, its five claws spread out, imposing and awe-inspiring. The leading commander was even more mighty and extraordinary. The horse he rode was neither a horse nor a deer, somewhat like a Qilin, but definitely not a Qilin.

Legend has it that those who are kings, supported by the masses, will also manifest unusual signs. A commander of an army gains无形 martial power加持.

"The scale of this Yellow Dragon Army is quite large. Such a riotous army is like a mudslide. Although they are fighting under the banner of overthrowing the Great Wu, in reality, even the commander does not know what he wants. He is purely charging forward with a fierce aura."

Li Xian raised his internal Qi to disperse the cold from his body.

He also saw that the Yellow Dragon Army was large in scale, but their formation was loose and their morale was poor.

Qingning County.

Lin Guolong was well prepared, the city gates were tightly shut. Standing on the city wall, he shouted loudly, "You rebellious traitors, do not harbor unrealistic fantasies. You cannot capture this city!"

The Yellow Dragon Army general, Qi Biao, frowned upon hearing this.

The Yellow Dragon Army originally looked down upon "Qingning County." They had marched eastward earlier, suffered several defeats, and fled here in a mess.

The army had little food left. They must quickly capture a city, use it as a base, and then plan further.

Qi Biao said, "A small city like this dares to resist in the face of my army? Listen, soldiers in the city! My Yellow Dragon Army is a righteous army, forced to rise in rebellion by the oppression of the Great Wu."

"The Great Wu is guilty, but the common people are innocent. If you capture the county magistrate, open the city gates, and welcome us in, I, Qi Biao, guarantee that no innocent person will be killed!"

Qi Biao's voice boomed.

Lin Guolong trembled with anger. "Nonsense! Your Yellow Dragon Army captured several cities, burned, killed, and looted without restraint. Is there really no innocent person among you?"

Qi Biao said coldly, "If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a reason. Besides, how many county soldiers does your small city have? Can you stop my thirty thousand troops?"

"Quickly open the city gates. This is your only way to survive!"

Qingning County was a small city. In the eyes of the impoverished region, it was already a remote place. Including county soldiers and constables, there were only a few thousand people at most.

Most of the county soldiers were supported by the county government. Although they mobilized the common people, the total number of people was not small either.

But facing tens of thousands of troops, facing a brutal army that had killed and seen blood, with neat formations, it was inevitable to feel intimidated.

Lin Guolong's scalp went numb. "Li Xian, you bastard! I knew I shouldn't have listened to your deception and defended some damn city. I should have taken my ten wives and fled back to my family to live off others and wait to die for the rest of my life."

It was his first time seeing such a scene.

The dark mass of troops made his legs go weak.

Lin Guolong forced himself to say, "I don't care how many troops you have! Stop talking nonsense. If you have the ability, come up to the city wall and chop off my head!"

"Listen up, Qingning County! Fight them! After this is over, I'll reward each of you with a hundred taels of gold!"

He certainly could not afford such a reward.

Qi Biao's face darkened. He had suffered losses in sieges before. He knew it was difficult to attack cities. It would be best if they could surrender without fighting. Such remote counties and towns lacked troops, and the county magistrate was timid. Just by showing his might, he could scare them out of their wits.

But there were always hard bones among them.

Encountering one was very troublesome. Qi Biao thought: "This county magistrate has a hard bone. But after all, it's remote, so the troops won't be many. It's best to take it in one go!"

He immediately ordered the left and right guards to lead troops to attack the city.

The drums beat to boost morale, and the soldiers charged forward. Various heavy siege engines advanced.

"Oh my, they're really coming," Lin Guolong trembled. "Shoot arrows, shoot arrows!"

The soldiers shot arrows in defense, but the enemy came in great numbers. A few waves of arrows failed to stop their advance. With the stacking of lives, the siege engines had already pushed to the bottom of the city.

Cloud ladders were hung on the city walls.

Some soldiers eager for military merit, eyes full of excitement, risked their lives to climb the walls. On the Qingning County side, they dropped giant stones and poured hot oil to fend off the attack.

"Light the fire!" Lin Guolong roared.

They set the hot oil on fire. The cloud ladders were made of special materials, sturdy and not afraid of fire. But the soldiers climbing the city were afraid, and for a time, they could not succeed.

Lin Guolong roared, "Shoot! Shoot hard for me!"

The people behind helped transport stones and wood, their resources endless. Although Qingning County had few troops, they mobilized the people in the county, so their power to defend the city was not weak.

Rolling logs crashed down...

Screams echoed one after another.

Qi Biao's face was unsightly. "A bunch of trash! Attack fiercely! Attack fiercely!"

He kept sending people forward.

After the initial fear, Lin Guolong now found that although the enemy had many people, it was not easy to take him down. He was no longer afraid and began to command boldly.

They fought like this for several hours.

Thousands of casualties. Qi Biao knew this siege had failed. His military supplies were insufficient. If he surrounded the city without attacking, it would be unfavorable for him.

This consecutive defeat was truly not good.

"General Qi, we can't attack forcefully anymore!" The left guard of the Yellow Dragon Army saw the bad situation and reminded him.

"Retreat!"

Qi Biao's face was grim. He ordered the entire army to retreat more than ten miles and camp in a forest.

"Damn it! Damn it!"

Inside the military tent.

Qi Biao was furious. The Yellow Dragon Army's consecutive defeats first greatly reduced their morale; second, their military supplies were exhausted. In the final analysis, it was due to his incompetent command and reckless指挥.

"Hu Fang, what do you think of the current situation?" Qi Biao asked a strategist beside him.

The strategist Hu Fang said, "Reporting to the General, based on the current situation, attacking the city is no longer possible. It would be better to retreat and seek the next best thing: plundering the surrounding villages."

"Take rice if there is rice, take grain if there is grain, take money if there is money. If there is no rice, grain, or money, aren't there people? When everyone is starving, they need to eat some meat, right?"

"After eating and drinking their fill, we can rebuild our morale!"

Qi Biao nodded, having no other choice. "Alright, let's do as you say! Tomorrow, have the elite soldiers lead some troops to go to the surrounding villages to scout and plunder."

"Search thoroughly like a carpet. Take everything that can be eaten. Not a single dog or person should be spared!"

Li Xian witnessed the battle situation, feeling both joy and worry. The Yellow Dragon Army's great defeat meant the people in the county avoided a massacre, which was naturally good. But in this case, the Yellow Dragon Army would inevitably shift their target.

Qingning County could withstand the siege because the city gates were towering, and when the city gates were built, there was no cutting corners.

Yihe Manor did not have city gates.

Inside the manor, there were thousands of people, mostly tenant farmers, maids, servants, and miscellaneous workers, most of whom had no combat effectiveness. If they really had to fight, they would be crushed instantly.

"If the Yellow Dragon Army finds us, it will be bad," Li Xian thought to himself.

One person's strength is difficult to oppose an army. If the Yellow Dragon Army charged together, even the Madam would have to avoid their锋芒.
