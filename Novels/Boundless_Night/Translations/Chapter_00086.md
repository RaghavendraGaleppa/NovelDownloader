**Chapter 86: Honor and Disgrace Drift with the Wind**

Qin Ming, without a word, pulled out ten daygold coins and quickly tucked the ancient tome into his embrace.

The mountain monster, covered in black fur from head to toe, was quite discerning. Its eyes weren't solely fixed on the Purple Lightning Beast; it also engaged Qin Ming in conversation, "Customer, aren't you going to examine this book carefully before buying it directly?"

Qin Ming stroked the stubble on his plump face and said, "I buy ancient books purely out of a desire to appear refined. They're just old objects with a sense of history to display on my bookshelf. I don't read much normally; I'm just making up for what I lack, using them to decorate my study and make it seem like I have some depth."

The mountain monster vendor chuckled along, "You're too humble, esteemed guest. All lovers of books are cultured individuals."

Qin Ming played along, though he felt as if he had daggers in his back. Staying in such a place, constantly subjected to the scrutiny of various fiends, felt like being on the verge of disaster at any moment.

He wanted to leave immediately, but then, what did he see? On a stall further away, there was actually a large pile of books!

He was a lover of books, and he truly couldn't tear his eyes away, couldn't move his feet. His heart was in agony, struggling immensely.

"I'll risk it!" Qin Ming thought. Since he had already come and stumbled upon them, he would surely regret it for years if he didn't check out a pile of ancient secret tomes.

Besides, did he really lack a mere quarter of an hour? This place was full of mutated creatures after all. If an accident truly occurred, he could bathe in their fiendish blood and fight his way out.

Qin Ming felt a bit nervous, while some of the other fiends also felt pressure. Could a person personally escorted by a noble lady from a Blessed Land have a simple identity?

Especially with the Purple Lightning Beast walking so close to him and looking incredibly serious, it was clear at a glance that this human man had a grand background.

Many fiends noticed that even the Purple Lightning Beast's two retainers were perched on the human man's shoulders, giggling incessantly, as if clinging to this man meant embarking on a path to heaven. They seemed to have forgotten their own master, laughing so hard they looked utterly undignified!

In fact, the two birds were bitter inside. Who the heck wanted to laugh? They were forced! Stuck to his shoulders, there was no escaping. If they dared not cooperate, they would be flattened into a meat patty!

Before entering, they had been ordered to wash the bloodstains off their wings. Now, when folded, nothing could be seen anyway.

Qin Ming looked at the pile of books, all showing signs of age. He touched them one by one, then casually flipped through a few pages.

He felt a bit suspicious. Why was there no spiritual resonance?

He quickly realized: this was large-scale counterfeiting!

Qin Ming looked up at the honest and foolishly grinning fiend and secretly sighed, *Is competition so fierce in the mountains? This bear-like mountain monster isn't a good sort; he's clearly trying to scam humans.*

"These were all left by my father. I don't know what they are exactly; I can't read this script," the fiend said, grinning wide. The stench from its gaping maw was pungent, but it had already cleared itself of responsibility.

Qin Ming didn't want to waste words with it. Time was tight. He could fall into a bloody battle with numerous mutated creatures at any moment, so he had to quickly scout around.

He was focused on finding old artifacts, hoping to acquire rare inheritances.

Qin Ming felt no guilt. The relationship between humans and fiends was complex; sometimes they coexisted peacefully, but often they tricked and killed each other. When encountered in the mountains, they would hunt each other whenever the opportunity arose.

Any book that ended up here surely had a bloody story behind it.

Qin Ming finally made another discovery: it was actually a secret manual on leg techniques. This greatly pleased him; it was the first time he had gained an inheritance of this category.

The Purple Lightning Beast, serving as a background prop, accompanied him throughout. This fatso was clearly acting big by borrowing its prestige, shamelessly milking the situation dry here. It was utterly detestable!

"Gah-gah..." The Speech Sparrow and Myna bird giggled even more gleefully after Qin Ming made his new acquisition.

They felt that their master's expression management was poor; he was too serious. The two of them were now terrified of death and worried about any slip-ups. They were helping the Purple Lightning Beast cover its tracks, hoping no problems would be exposed immediately, fearing that the fatso might kill them to silence witnesses or lead to a mutual destruction.

At first, Qin Ming was so nervous his palms were sweating. After all, more and more mountain monsters were looking at him with fiery gazes. But as time passed, he began to understand the situation: this group of fiends had gotten the wrong idea!

Because he noticed that the mountain monsters' gazes towards him were also very unusual.

"This lord is a close friend of our master!" the Speech Sparrow declared firmly while giggling foolishly.

Some fiends sneered, *This thieving bird must have already switched allegiances and gone to follow that human man.*

Qin Ming quickened his pace. This feeling of shamelessly exploiting the situation was quite pleasant; the more he did it, the more inwardly satisfied he felt.

"Boss, I saw a book at your place from quite a distance away just now. Why is it gone?" Qin Ming asked, stopping before a peculiar stall.

This wasn't an ordinary ground stall, but a large tent made of beast hide, shimmering with silver light. One look, and it was clear this mountain monster was quite wealthy, selling extraordinary items.

This was a third-generation beast scion, who had come out from the deep mountains to relax and occasionally exchange special items with humans based on personal preference.

"You saw us coming, so you deliberately hid it?" Qin Ming directly pointed out. Anyway, even if there were issues, all the karma would fall on the Purple Lightning Beast.

This humanoid fiend had long silver hair flowing down, with two jade horns on its head aligned on a central axis, one in front and one behind, one long and one short. They looked exactly like rhino horns.

The Purple Lightning Beast squinted, somewhat displeased. *Is it because it saw me coming that it started hiding things, like guarding against a thief?*

It recognized this white rhinoceros; it was the grandson of the psychic jade rhino from the deepest part of the mountains. *Did it have a prejudice against me?*

When White Stream saw its gaze, sweat immediately beaded on its forehead. Although it came from one of the most powerful and renowned clans in the area, a descendant of the awe-inspiring old rhino, it couldn't compare to this one from the Blessed Land.

"It's here. I saw some dust on it just now, so I took it to wipe it clean," White Stream said with a smile, retrieving the golden beast-hide bound book from the silver tent.

Qin Ming took it with a slight air of composure, displaying great presence. The surrounding mountain monsters watched with some trepidation, for this person dared to put on airs even in front of White Stream.

Qin Ming had now fully immersed himself in the role. He was a close friend of the immensely important Purple Lightning Beast, so he had to show some "flair."

He focused his mind and only flipped open two pages, immediately knowing that this book was extraordinary. No wonder the rhino fiend put it away instantly; such a book would certainly not be given away for free.

"How many daygold coins?" Qin Ming asked indifferently.

"Talking about daygold is too vulgar. I, White Stream, am willing to befriend a brother like you. It's a gift!" White Stream said grandly. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to sell it at a high price to this person anyway, so it was better to forge a good relationship.

Qin Ming said, "I am Zheng Maorong. When I have leisure, I will certainly visit Brother Bai in the deep mountains."

Only then did the Purple Lightning Beast realize: *So my single displeased glance indirectly helped this fatso!*

In the depths of his heart, Qin Ming indeed felt pressured. Having encountered this situation today and come this far, it was like a big ship that couldn't turn around easily. He could only bite the bullet and try to exploit the situation a bit more.

At this moment, he arrived at another stall with a tent, but unfortunately, there were no secret tomes here.

"Boss, do you have any spiritual substances?" Qin Ming casually asked.

Inside the tent, on a lounge chair, a woman with a figure as soft as a willow, dressed in a black gown, had an exquisitely delicate, pale, oval face. Her expression stiffened upon hearing his question. *Was he trying to fleece her now? She thought there wouldn't be any trouble since she had no secret manuals.*

Only then did Qin Ming notice that her lower body wasn't legs, but a segment of black snake tail.

"Do you have any spiritual substances that can allow for six or seven rebirths?" Qin Ming felt that this one must also be a third-generation beast scion from the deep mountains.

Upon hearing this, Wu Yiyi wanted to whip him with her tail. This was truly a grand demand, and the key was that he wasn't genuinely buying, but trying to forcibly demand it.

She shook her head calmly and said, "No, I only had one level five spiritual substance, which a friend pre-ordered last month and picked up this morning."

Qin Ming expressed deep regret.

"Level five? Forget it, the grade isn't high enough," he said blandly. Although he didn't get it, he had to maintain his demeanor. After all, he was now a close friend of the Purple Lightning Beast.

"Then there's nothing I can do. I only have level two spiritual substances left here," Wu Yiyi said with a faint smile.

Qin Ming remained calm, saying, "Bring me a level two one to look at. I just remembered, I need to empower some birds recently, so it might come in handy."

Wu Yiyi's face stiffened. *This brazenness is too ugly! Where was your grand demeanor from before?* Even the Purple Lightning Beast felt embarrassed, forced to stay by his side, losing so much face!

Qin Ming contentedly bought a jar of spiritual substance at cost price. Even a tiny mosquito is meat, and what did demeanor and face have to do with him? Let all honor and disgrace drift with the wind. Even if there were storms, let them fall upon Zheng Maorong and the Purple Lightning Beast.

He knew he had thoroughly offended the Purple Lightning Beast today, so he might as well let it contribute a bit more, and then quickly escape!

"Something's wrong!" Qin Ming was very alert, noticing that some mountain monsters were still quite perceptive, like the snake woman Wu Yiyi, whose eyes held a strange glint.

"Boss, give me a stack of waterproof oil paper." Before leaving, Qin Ming wasn't trying to fleece them; this paper was genuinely useful to him.

That mountain monster was dumbfounded.

The Purple Lightning Beast felt he had gone crazy with poverty, starting to fleece even such mundane items.

"Let's go, it's quite boring here, nothing precious to be found!" Qin Ming suppressed his inner desires; he couldn't browse any longer.

He decisively walked out, bringing the Purple Lightning Beast and the two birds with him, exiting the black market in the night mist.

"My lord, it's over so soon?" the Speech Sparrow asked.

"Haven't you heard the ancient saying? 'He who knows contentment suffers no disgrace; he who knows when to stop meets no danger, and can endure long.' " Qin Ming finished, flipped onto the Purple Lightning Beast's back, and urged, "Hurry, give me a ride!"

The Purple Lightning Beast was about to explode on the spot. It was a mount again!

"Faster!" Qin Ming urged, feeling that something might happen.

Indeed, riding on the Purple Lightning Beast's back, he had only galloped out for about a *li* when a thick fog inexplicably rose in the forest, making it very dark and chilling.

Qin Ming took a deep breath of the early spring air, scented with tender grass and fresh shoots. *What kind of monster did he run into? Why does it seem like a technique used by those from beyond the mortal realm?*

A white owl stood on a large tree, very anxious. Its species preferred to sleep in shallow night and be active in deep night. It had only taken a nap while its master was soaking in the hot spring, and this happened!

If the guardian, "Four-Tusked Old Elephant," returned from drinking in the depths of the mountain range and learned of this, it would surely put all the blame on it.

The owl's eyes glowed, and it opened its mouth to exhale a thick fog, pressing it towards that part of the forest, wanting to quickly subdue the audacious human.

Qin Ming felt as if large mountains were pressing in from all directions, making him suffocate. He knew he had encountered someone from beyond the mortal realm.

The two birds had already rolled their eyes and passed out.

Qin Ming didn't make things difficult for them. He unbound them and threw them onto the ground, setting them free.

He glanced down. The Purple Lightning Beast was unaffected in the slightest. The black mist was only frantically surging towards his physical body.

*Smack!* He slapped the Purple Lightning Beast's back.

"If you don't stop, I'll kill it!" Qin Ming threatened, drawing his blade defiantly.

The hidden transcendent seemed unfazed by the threat, continuing to urge the black mist, which transformed into a black mountain range, pressing down on his flesh and blood body.

Qin Ming's bones crackled, enduring immense pressure.

His entire body burst forth with Heavenly Radiance, brilliant light tearing through the night. Originally, he wanted to wield his Mutton-fat Jade Iron Blade, but now he found that his fused Heavenly Radiance Force actually dispersed the black mist. He swung out a full-force palm.

The area was struck as if by a bolt of lightning!

The black mist was actually beaten into surging like terrifying waves, violently surging and snapping many trees.

Seeing its effectiveness, Qin Ming continuously swung his palms, shattering one black mountain after another in his vicinity!

Previously, when he encountered that young man who could turn into mist, his Heavenly Radiance Force had no killing power whatsoever. He had only escaped that predicament by relying on the element of surprise with his Mutton-fat Jade Iron Blade.

Now, after fusing various energy techniques, his full-power Heavenly Radiance Force could actually counter some of the methods of those from beyond the mortal realm!

As the black mist dispersed, the white owl's figure was revealed on the ancient tree opposite.

It was very surprised, saying, "Whose Heavenly Radiance Force is this? It's actually so domineering."

"Let me go!" Qin Ming held his blade to the Purple Lightning Beast's neck.

"Alright, as long as you don't harm it!" The white owl was surprisingly direct. It didn't try to capture the human immediately; it dared not take the risk.

A moment later, Qin Ming appeared in the Red Mist Cave, only two *li* away. Days ago, he had come here with Xu Sheng and Sister Fangfang to fish for Spirit Eels, and had been "beaten" by an overwhelming swarm of Fire Bats.

He stood there, patted the Purple Lightning Beast, and said, "As the saying goes, 'A thousand *li* journey ends with a farewell.' You may go back."

The Purple Lightning Beast gnashed its teeth, feeling utterly exasperated, its eyes practically spitting fire.

Qin Ming looked at it suspiciously, "Why do you look somewhat familiar? That baring-teeth and glaring expression is exactly like the previous Purple Lightning Beast. Could it be the same beast? Did you follow me all the way here from Black and White Mountain?"

"Get lost!" The Purple Lightning Beast exploded, unable to endure any longer, and actually spoke human words.

"You can speak human language!" Qin Ming was greatly astonished. He slapped it out of the Red Mist Cave, then quickly detonated the area, drawing out an overwhelming swarm of Fire Bats.

He turned and ran towards the cold pond, wrapping several ancient books in waterproof oil paper on the way, then plunged into the icy water.

Qin Ming resurfaced in a lake about twenty *li* away. By now, he had already torn off his fake beard, stripped off his voluminous clothing, and his body was no longer plump, having slimmed down.

He was still wearing a set of loose clothes underneath, which he now dried with Heavenly Radiance, instantly making his wide sleeves billow. He had reverted to a graceful young man.

Qin Ming didn't rush back. He hunted in the mountains, and when the time was about right, seeing people emerging from the forest, he also began his journey home.

"You big fat man with a beard, come over here!"

"You hairless fat man, stop first! Did you temporarily shave off your beard?"

At the necessary road junction leading to Scarlet Cloud City, plump individuals suffered severe verbal abuse, being repeatedly called "fat man" by a group of birds and terrifying mountain monsters, and all were stopped for questioning.

Qin Ming's robes fluttered, his dark hair lifted by the spring breeze. On his clear, handsome face, his eyes were pure and untainted by worldly smoke and dust. He entered the city with elegant grace.
