# Chapter 75: The Cicada Gate

Taoist Priest Qixia hastily grabbed two disciples to shield himself.

When the heavy hammer pierced the first body, its momentum did not减. The second person was sent flying through the air, his back crashing into an incense burner before finally stopping.

The bronze incense burner was dented from the impact, and the ash mixed with blood splashed onto the banner that read "The Evil World Must Be Destroyed."

Xu Yunfan took a step forward, cracking the floor tiles with each stride.

The remaining disciples, intimidated by his aura, could not stop their hands from trembling as they gripped their weapons.

Suddenly, a young disciple threw down his steel knife and ran crying toward the mountain gate.

"Useless!"

Taoist Priest Qixia swept his horsetail whisk; the steel needles at the end pierced the deserter's skull.

But when he turned around, he found Xu Yunfan right before him. The smell of sweat mixed with the scent of blood rushed at him.

"Wait, wait!"

Taoist Priest Qixia suddenly tore open his Taoist robe, revealing a dense map of acupoints tattooed on his chest. "If you kill me, the thirty-seven places in Qingzhou..."

The dull sound of the heavy hammer smashing through the skull interrupted his threat. Xu Yunfan stepped on the head embedded in the floor tile and shook the sticky red and white matter off the hammer's face.

"Noisy. Boring."

In just a few breaths, there was no one left standing in the entire Qixia Taoist Temple. Those who had taken drugs had their bones shattered by his heavy hammer, lifeless.

The night wind swept the smell of blood over the mountain ridge.

Xu Yunfan bent down and picked up the blood-stained banner, casually wrapping the Wengjin Hammer in it and slinging it over his back. By now, the disciples in the Qixia Taoist Temple had long since scattered in fear, disappearing without a trace.

As he turned, Xu Yunfan spotted half a ledger in Taoist Priest Qixia's lap. He flipped through it casually. On one page, it clearly read: 'On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, send twelve boys and twelve girls to the Cangwu Residence.'

Various other supplies were recorded in detail, mostly destined for the border between Qingzhou and Wuzhou, a place called Lianshan Town.

"The Incense Fire Sect..."

Xu Yunfan pondered for a moment. Instead of throwing the half-ledger into the fire basin, he tucked it into his chest. He picked up the merit box and turned to leave.

This was all money. Roughly estimated, the silver notes and silver coins added up to perhaps three to four thousand taels.

He placed the slightly heavy merit box on the horse's back. The sorrel horse snorted outside the temple gate. Xu Yunfan mounted the horse and rode away.

Three days later, in the state city of Qingzhou, Changyi City, at the Changfeng Tavern—which shared the same owner as the Changfeng Wine Shop—the half-open carved wooden window of the private room on the second floor allowed a few rays of twilight to fall slantingly on the green jade table.

Xu Yunfan looked at the cup of clear wine before him.

"Brother Liu, try this steamed spirit fish. Although I've only had it a few times, the taste is exceptional."

When the dishes were all served, he lifted the bamboo cover. A mist carrying a strange fragrance rose into the air.

The perch on the plate glowed with a jade-green luster, and cloud patterns were faintly visible seven inches along its body. It was the famous local product of Changyi, the "Green Cloud Crossing"—this fish lives in the depths of the Crossing Sea in Qingzhou. Eighty taels of silver will only get you four taels of its fine meat. It is an excellent tonic for martial artists.

It is extremely beneficial for those at the Martial Master realm; it can strengthen bones and cleanse blood Qi. Consuming it over a long period can subtly change one's aptitude.

Unfortunately, such excellent spirit fish are extremely rare. You can only eat them in the Crossing Sea, and even there, you might only see one occasionally. They cannot survive more than two hours after leaving the Crossing Sea. Today, Xu Yunfan was lucky.

"Good, good, good!"

Liu Tianyun was overjoyed. "I've served my master for a long time. It's been four or five years since I last ate this spirit fish."

Liu Tianyun picked up the tenderest part of the fish belly. As it entered his mouth, the fresh, sweet spiritual energy rushed straight to the top of his head. Just as he was about to praise it, he saw the young man across from him rubbing the cup with his fingertips, his eyelids lowered, his mood not very high.

"Did you run into some trouble?"

Liu Tianyun put down his wooden chopsticks.

He remembered when they first met in the forest two months ago. Although this young man's aura was weak, and his skin had bloodlines from overexertion that nearly caused his body to burst, his spirit was incredibly eye-catching. Now, he seemed somewhat dispirited.

After several rounds of toasting and drinking, and after the dishes had been tasted and the wine had gone around three times, leaving only the fish bones of the spirit fish, Xu Yunfan placed his cup on the table and let out a breath.

Seeing this, Liu Tianyun couldn't help but ask, "We haven't seen each other for a few months, little brother. Why do you look so worried?"

"In the past few months, I've visited seven or eight sects within a five-hundred-mile radius of Changyi. Without exception, they all turned me away."

Xu Yunfan rubbed his temples, somewhat helplessly. "Either they disliked that I've practiced other martial arts, or they were arrogant and thought that since I'm a Second-Stage Martial Master, I must have ulterior motives for joining their sect. They said a Second-Stage Martial Master coming to pay respects at their mountain gate probably meant he wanted to step on their plaque to enter..."

"Pfft..."

Liu Tianyun choked on a mouthful of wine, a silver line of liquid划过 the air. If he hadn't turned his head in time, the entire table of dishes would have been sprayed with his saliva.

He abruptly stood up, his black brocade robe knocking over a wine pot. The liquid dripped down the corner of the table, blooming like red plum blossoms on the floor.

He slammed his cup heavily on the table, supporting himself with his hands.

"You're actually a Second-Stage Martial Master?!"

Xu Yunfan nodded, a bit surprised. "Brother Liu didn't know?"

"How could I possibly know!"

In the sudden silence of the room, the bronze bells at the eaves clanged in the night wind. Xu Yunfan nodded blankly, a few strands of hair falling over his forehead. In the candlelight, the youthful immaturity between his brows was still faintly visible.

Liu Tianyun stared at this face, which was at most twenty years old. He suddenly recalled that it was only after ten years of hard work, when he was already thirty, that he finally touched the threshold of the First Stage. Now, he is only at the mid-stage of Muscle Refining and the early stage of Bone Refining, still far from the late stage.

And he couldn't even find a master?

Those sects were truly wasting resources, rejecting such a genius. They must be blind.

"Those old bastards..."

His knuckles cracked as he clenched his fists. Suddenly, he grabbed a wine jar and drank from it deeply.

This scene made Xu Yunfan's lips tremble. This wine jar was medicinal wine, brewed from rare herbs that replenish Qi and blood. It was the signature product of the Changfeng Tavern, and many martial artists flocked to it.如果不是 for Liu Tianyun's relationship, he wouldn't have been able to get it. Just this cost him thirty taels of silver.

The amber nectar soaked his collar as it ran down his neck, but it couldn't extinguish the anger in Liu Tianyun's heart.

To think such a world-shocking talent was turned away at the door. The elders of those sects must have had their eyes blinded by miasma!

"Alright, alright, Brother Liu, don't get angry. I'm fine, I'm fine!"

Xu Yunfan hurriedly stepped forward to snatch the wine jar. He glanced at it; half of the five-jar had been drunk by Liu Tianyun.

"Sigh, if only..."

Liu Tianyun let out a long sigh and sat down. He scratched his head, pondered for a moment, and said, "Little Brother Xu, do you know what sect I come from?"

"Please enlighten me, Brother Liu."

"I come from Wuzhou. What I practice is the Cicada Strength, a lost art of the Cicada Gate. For someone like you... to go to the sects in Qingzhou is truly a waste of talent. The Cicada Gate in Wuzhou was once a first-rate sect renowned throughout the Great Zhou..."

As he spoke, Liu Tianyun took a token carved with thundercloud patterns from his chest and handed it to Xu Yunfan.
