# Chapter 637: Just a Foundation Establishment Late Stage Cultivator

For him at this moment, it was just right.

He did not choose to fuse it with his own body.

In this world, if a deity fully fuses with a divine core, they become enslaved by the Heavenly Dao. This is a taboo for cultivators.

They are all people who pursue an unbridled love for freedom; how could they be restrained by others?

Especially by the Heavenly Dao.

Cultivators walk against the heavens; their very existence is a defiance of the Heavenly Dao.

After a moment of thought, he finally sat cross-legged on the ice cliff and operated the *Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Script* once again.

Eight-colored cloud qi rose and churned from his palm. The Li Fire Cloud burned away the residual will imprints on the divine core, the Kan Water Cloud washed away the dregs of impure faith, and the Yin-Yang spiritual soil reshaped its foundation...

After nearly twenty days of continuous refinement, the divine core gradually lost its wildness and eventually condensed into a pure blue crystal containing liquid lightning within.

Xu Yunfan gazed at the diamond-shaped Thunder Divine Core in his palm, stripped from Tatus. Blue and white lightning arcs danced restlessly on its surface.

At this moment, he flipped his hand and took out a Nine-Aperture Nurturing Spirit Jade obtained from the ruins of the Heavenly Realm, along with a massive amount of rare materials.

The Eight Sceneries cloud qi rose again, forging its shape with Li Fire, cleansing impurities with Kan Water, and molding its veins with Zhen Thunder...

As the cloud qi intertwined, a simple and unadorned three-legged small cauldron slowly took form.

Thunder patterns faintly appeared on the cauldron's body, containing a strange space within.

This cauldron could gather the mixed incense and wish-force of believers, using the evil-expelling power of thunder as the fire and the Creation Cloud qi as the furnace to repeatedly temper and purify it. It would transform the flood of faith into pure divine power, and then condense it into an immortal golden nature.

"I shall call you the Divine Thunder Refining World Cauldron."

Xu Yunfan lightly tapped the cauldron body with his fingertip, and the thunder patterns glowed faintly.

A functional, low-grade magic treasure. With his current attainments in artifact refining, as long as the concept was clear, he could produce as many as he wanted.

The barbarians of the Frost Skull Tribe below were still prostrating themselves before the altar, completely unaware that deep within the thunder clouds above, the Thunder God they had worshipped for generations had been replaced.

Priest Barutu presided over the blood sacrifice ritual. In his perception, the majesty of 'his god' remained as before, but he did not detect the new trace of orderly aura deep within the divinity.

The true god, Tatus, only knew how to demand blood sacrifices and had absolutely no patience to guide the barbarian tribe to build cities or cultivate the frozen soil.

Xu Yunfan looked at the phantom of Zhang Ziyang beside him and handed over the small cauldron. "Does the Sect Master need this item to purify the wish-force?"

Zhang Ziyang stroked the silver star mark on his brow and probed it, then shook his head. "In this world's incense and divine path, the mixed thoughts and prayers of believers are also the source for tempering divinity and strengthening divine power. Purification would lose its authenticity. I need to merge with it to comprehend its subtleties."

His gaze swept over the expanding barbarian city on the ice plain.

"The more believers, the more abundant the wish-force, that is the right path of the divine path. As for the subsequent methods to peel away the control of the Heavenly Dao, I have my own ways."

Xu Yunfan did not insist. He flipped his hand and completely refined the Thunder Divine Core into his own foundation.

The moment the divine core fused in, the subtle rejection and hostility that permeated the heavens and earth, like ice and snow melting, vanished. His body and mind felt a sudden clarity.

The Aitila Heavenly Dao finally regarded him as one of its own. It had issued him a green card.

Zhang Ziyang spoke at the right moment. "Since that is the case, I shall hang this investigation divine position under your Thunder Divine System."

A divine light flashed faintly. An invisible thread of faith extended from the silver star between his brows and merged into the divine core mark within Xu Yunfan's body.

This was a contract of attachment to a divine system.

A subordinate god could enjoy the protection of the main god, and the main god could also extract a portion of the wish-force from the subordinate god.

Xu Yunfan naturally had no objection; the two of them were on the same path to begin with.

Xu Yunfan felt the smooth sensation of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth actively converging, and his spiritual sense resonated faintly with the law network of the凛冬 Northern Plains.

He looked at the Divine Thunder Refining World Cauldron. Inside, a milky white flame of wish-force was slowly burning the divine core.

This three-legged small cauldron was the key tool for him to manipulate the rules of the Heavenly Dao and steal the resources for immortality.

Xu Yunfan flipped his hand and put away the divine core, casually trying out a few divine decrees.

After resting for a few days, his gaze fell upon the Frost Thunder City below, protected by divine power.

Zhang Ziyang said, "That God of Winter, Lockman, has probably noticed."

"No matter. It's a good opportunity to use this mark to meet this Lord of Winter. Is the channel for incense and faith still smooth?"

Since Tatus was a mid-tier god, his realm was comparable to a Foundation Establishment Mid-Stage cultivator.

By analogy, a high-tier god was most likely at the Foundation Establishment Late Stage.

He, a cultivator who had reached Foundation Establishment Perfection and was invincible in the same realm, would he still fear the other party?

Zhang Ziyang closed his eyes and sensed for a moment.

"The faith threads of the 170,000 barbarians in Frost Thunder City have all been transferred to the divine core you refined. The morning prayers presided over by the priests have just ended, and the generated wish-force is being purified through the 'Divine Thunder Refining World Cauldron' you refined in advance. The efficiency is thirty percent higher than when Tatus was in power."

He paused, a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth.

"However, that High Priest named Barutu seems a bit confused by the sudden addition of farming regulations in yesterday's divine decree."

"Tatus never cared what mortals planted."

"No matter."

Xu Yunfan didn't care at all.

"The summons from a high-tier god is the top priority. Have the three strands of immortal golden nature been completely refined?"

He sensed that Zhang Ziyang's aura was more harmonious and reserved than a few days ago.

"Thanks to you, the weak god spirit in the Star Spirit Banner cooperated in sorting out the wish-force, and the extracted divine power is much purer."

Zhang Ziyang nodded. "Now, my divine core foundation is stable. As long as I don't leave the range of the Northern Plains, I can still exert about seventy percent of my investigation authority while attached to your Thunder Divine System."

Three days later, a sharp cold wind carrying ice crystal fragments swept over the sky above Frost Thunder City.

The will contained in the wind was cold and majestic, directly imprinting itself into the core of the Thunder Divine Core refined by Xu Yunfan.

"God of Thunder, Tatus, come here immediately!"

The command was brief and不容置疑 (unquestionable).

Xu Yunfan and Zhang Ziyang exchanged a glance, and the space around them distorted slightly.

Zhang Ziyang's figure became ethereal, turning into a silver stream of light that merged into Xu Yunfan's brow. His investigation divine core mark was attached to the Thunder Divine Core, like a satellite.

Xu Yunfan then drew upon the power of the Thunder Divine Core. Fine blue and white thunder patterns appeared on his body's surface, and his aura was identical to Tatus's, just more reserved and profound.

He took a step forward, his figure merging into the howling north wind. Following the guidance of the divine sense mark, he sped towards the extreme north.

The thousand-mile ice plain raced past beneath his feet. The cold air contained in the howling wind was enough to freeze fine steel, but it was easily dispersed by the thunder patterns on Xu Yunfan's body's surface.

The further north he traveled, the more active the ice-attribute energy between heaven and earth became, until a magnificent mountain range of glaciers came into view.

In the center of the mountain range, a massive palace carved from ten-thousand-year-old profound ice floated amidst the blizzard. It was the divine kingdom of Lockman, the God of Winter and a high-tier god of the Natural Divine System—the Eternal Frozen Court.

Before the palace gates, two ten-zhang-tall Frost Giants slowly opened their icy blue eyes, their chilling gazes sweeping over Xu Yunfan.

An ice crystal staircase extended from the palace gate, landing right in front of Xu Yunfan.

On either side of the staircase, various forms of ice elemental spirits floated silently, emanating an aura comparable to the late stage of Qi Condensation.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged as he walked up the steps.

The moment he stepped through the palace gate, it was as if he had passed through a curtain of invisible cold water. The howling of wind and snow from the outside instantly vanished.

Before him was a vast and unnervingly empty ice dome hall. The dome hung with countless icicles, reflecting a幽蓝 (幽 blue) cold light.

At the end of the hall, seated upon a throne constructed entirely of deep blue profound ice, was a figure shrouded in hazy ice mist.

His mere presence caused the surrounding space to freeze slightly, making everything feel at a standstill.

This was the supreme ruler of the Natural Divine System of the Northern Plains, the God of Winter, Lockman.
