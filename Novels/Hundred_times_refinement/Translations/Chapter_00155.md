# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass  
Chapter 103: The Ghost Cultivator  

Youzhou consisted of eighty-one cities, and "Tianshui" was one of the largest in its southern region. Located at a crucial transportation hub, it thrived with commerce and a dense population.  

Three days later, Lin Xuan arrived at the outskirts of Tianshui City. Recalling the information he had gathered about the city, he nodded in satisfaction. This would indeed be an excellent place to attempt his Foundation Establishment breakthrough.  

Most cultivators chose secluded locations for their closed-door cultivation, as disturbances during practice were highly undesirable. Some even went to extremes, setting up their retreats in perilous places like the Ghost Valley or the Ten Thousand Demon Mountains—only to end up as meals for demonic beasts rather than achieving undisturbed cultivation.  

When refining his top-grade pills previously, Lin Xuan had similarly chosen a remote wilderness. Despite his careful concealment, unexpected visitors still found him. Though he escaped unscathed, the encounter had left him drenched in cold sweat.  

Now, attempting Foundation Establishment would be even riskier. After careful consideration, Lin Xuan devised a foolproof plan.  

The best hiding place was in plain sight. While most cultivators sought solitude in desolate lands, he would do the opposite—choose a bustling metropolis.  

Cultivators pursuing the Dao rarely lingered in mortal cities. Thus, the likelihood of encountering danger during his breakthrough here would be minimal.  

The sun was still high, so Lin Xuan took his time strolling toward Tianshui.  

The city's sturdy walls were built from massive stones weighing hundreds of pounds each. A wide moat surrounded it, and a squad of imposing guards stood at the gate.  

Entering Tianshui, Lin Xuan marveled at the densely packed buildings and the bustling crowds. Since embarking on his cultivation path, he had rarely ventured into the mortal world.  

Pursuing immortality didn't mean severing all worldly ties—it was merely a means to achieve longevity. Spotting a restaurant named "Xiang Ji Fu" nearby, Lin Xuan headed straight for it without hesitation.  

After indulging in a lavish feast, he summoned the waiter. "Do you know of any high-quality properties for sale in Tianshui?"  

"Looking to buy, sir? Absolutely! There's the Li family's estate in the south, or Squire Zhang's in the eastern suburbs..."  

Lin Xuan waved his hand. "I need a quiet place, preferably one where I won't be disturbed."  

The waiter hesitated. "Well... there is one, but..."  

"Speak plainly. If it meets my needs, price isn't an issue," Lin Xuan said, tossing him a silver ingot.  

The waiter's eyes gleamed—such generosity was rare. "Thank you, sir! About ten li north of the city, there's a fine estate spanning several acres, complete with pavilions, gardens, and a small lake. It belonged to Master Chen, the city's wealthiest man. The place is secluded, just as you requested, but..."  

"But what?" Lin Xuan frowned. "Does Master Chen refuse to sell?"  

"No, he's eager to offload it. It's just... the estate is haunted. Those who stay there either fall gravely ill or suffer bizarre hallucinations. Some say ghosts roam the grounds."  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan arrived at the northern outskirts. Before him stood an exquisite yet eerie mansion—the so-called haunted estate. Surveying the surroundings, he nodded in approval. Not only was it quiet, but it also sat atop a minor spiritual vein, making it perfect for cultivation.  

As for the rumors of hauntings? Lin Xuan wasn't concerned. The "exorcists" hired by locals were mere charlatans in the eyes of true cultivators.  

Knocking on the estate's gate, he waited until a hunched, white-haired old man emerged.  

"You...?"  

"I'm here to purchase the estate."  

The old man's face lit up. "One hundred taels of silver."  

A paltry sum for such a property, but its haunted reputation had driven the price down. After completing the transaction, Lin Xuan began inspecting his new residence—where he would attempt his Foundation Establishment.  

Unlike advancing his cultivation level, breaking through to Foundation Establishment represented a qualitative leap. Success would not only transform his spiritual power but also cleanse his marrow, doubling his lifespan.  

But first, he had a minor matter to attend to. Closing his eyes, he extended his spiritual sense. Moments later, he smirked and headed to the rear garden.  

There stood an unassuming pavilion. The door, unlocked, creaked open at his touch.  

Despite the daylight, the interior was dim and chillingly cold.  

A woman's sobs echoed from the corner, and the furniture trembled inexplicably.  

Lin Xuan had no patience for such theatrics. Channeling his spiritual power, he flicked his sleeve, releasing a streak of white light that morphed into a giant hand, grasping toward the corner.  

The sobs ceased abruptly, replaced by a panicked shriek. A shadowy figure darted toward the door.  

"Trying to flee?"  

With a thought, the spectral hand transformed into a glowing rope, binding the figure.  

"Spare me, Immortal! Please!"  

Lin Xuan examined the ghost—a girl of sixteen or seventeen, delicate and fair. But his interest wasn't in her appearance; he had recognized her as a Pure Yin Spirit.  

In the cultivation world, such spirits were rare treasures. Unlike vengeful ghosts doomed to lose their minds over time, Pure Yin Spirits could become Ghost Cultivators—retaining their intellect and even solidifying physical forms at higher realms, akin to how cultivators ascended to immortality.  

Encountering one was akin to finding a mortal with spiritual roots—except far rarer.  

The ghost, Lin Yue'er, trembled under his gaze. She had heard tales of cultivators using spirits to forge sinister artifacts.  

"What's your name?" Lin Xuan asked.  

"Lin Yue'er."  

His eyebrow rose at the shared surname. "You want me to spare you?"  

"Yes! I've done no harm!"  

"Then swear allegiance to me."  

"Allegiance?"  

"Become my servant, and I'll not only spare you but teach you ghostly cultivation. In time, you may even manifest a physical form and ascend."  

Lin Xuan's offer wasn't born of mercy but calculated benefit. A Pure Yin Spirit was a cultivator's boon—a self-improving servant requiring no maintenance, effectively doubling one's strength.  

Such opportunities were so rare that even Core Formation experts might search for centuries in vain.  

Lin Xuan's luck was exceptional indeed.
