# Chapter 38: Divine Martial Gate

It was dusk, inside the Blood Robe Tower.

The setting sun was like blood. As another grand circulation of cultivation concluded, Lu Yang slowly refined the spiritual qi of heaven and earth into his Dantian, transforming it into True Qi that flowed through his limbs and meridians.

His Qi circulated through his meridians like a dragon returning to the sea.

"Soon. Once I cultivate the final Flying Fish Transformation and merge the nine transformations into one, I will completely refine the third-grade True Qi, 'True Dragon Malice,' from the *Nine Transformations Dragon Arts*."

"By the time I achieve 'True Dragon Malice,' it will be roughly when the Righteous-Demonic War begins. The timing will be perfect, allowing me to contend for the Foundation Establishment opportunity at Skeleton Mountain in my strongest state. Only a Foundation Establishment opportunity is worth risking my life for; everything else is fleeting."

Having finished his cultivation for the day, Lu Yang emerged from his quiet chamber.

Outside, a woman with a proud bearing and sharp brows had been waiting for a long time. Upon seeing Lu Yang, she immediately stepped forward and handed him a jade slip.

"Dao Brother, today's movements of the corpse tide have been delivered."

Lu Yang took the jade slip and smiled faintly. "Thank you, Daoist Friend Yun."

This woman was none other than Yun Miaoqing.

She was originally a disciple of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion. Although Lu Yang had already learned the *Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art*, he had bought her due to their connection in a previous life.

To be fair, his original intention was that since they had shared a bond in a past life, he didn't mind doing something good for her if it didn't hinder him. Following him was better than being bought by other Saint Sect disciples, having her cultivation plundered as a "talent," and being reduced to human refuse.

However, he hadn't expected this decision to give him an unexpected surprise.

Perhaps because he hadn't cultivated with Yun Miaoqing in this life, but instead treated her with mutual respect, focusing solely on his arduous cultivation, Yun Miaoqing's favorability towards him had greatly increased.

"Dao Brother, you are a good person. Why stay in the Initial Saint Demonic Sect?"

Yun Miaoqing walked closer to Lu Yang and whispered, "The corpse tide is erupting now. Senior Brother, why not feign death and come with me to the Sword Pavilion to convert to the righteous path?"

As she spoke, Yun Miaoqing looked at Lu Yang, her beautiful eyes subtly conveying affection.

When she was at her most desperate and helpless, it was the man before her who rescued her from a sea of suffering. He not only treated her with utter respect, not harming a single hair, but also provided her with a place to stay.

Though he hailed from the Demonic Sect, he was a true gentleman.

Not to mention, over the past decade, she had personally watched him grow step by step. His cultivation was high, his talent strong, and most importantly, he was very handsome.

If he could join the Sword Pavilion, perhaps he could be with her...

Lost in her thoughts, Yun Miaoqing's pretty face suddenly flushed crimson, though she didn't know what she was thinking.

This expression made Lu Yang recall how she had stubbornly called him a "demon" in previous lives, and for a moment, he found it quite amusing.

Of course, he had no interest in romantic affairs.

What truly mattered to him was that Yun Miaoqing's status within the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion seemed to be quite significant; she claimed that with her recommendation, the Sword Pavilion would surely accept him.

"Cultivating in the Saint Sects is like treading on thin ice. If possible, I'd still prefer to go to a sect with a better reputation."

Yun Miaoqing might just be the stepping stone for him to switch to the righteous path in the future.

"How are Senior Sister Feixia and the others?"

"Those demonic cultivators severely defeated the corpse tide at Jueyin Ridge a few days ago. A mysterious powerful expert also made a move but was repelled by them, and they pursued him."

Yun Miaoqing handed him another jade slip.

Lu Yang took the jade slip, and with a sweep of his spiritual sense, all the scenes of that day immediately imprinted themselves upon his mind.

"So that's it... It seems there truly is a mastermind behind the early outbreak of the corpse tide. Disciples of the Divine Martial Gate? And the wondrous treasure they used to catalyze the corpse tide..."

At this point, Lu Yang was suddenly stunned, then abruptly stood up.

"Profound Origin Grand Yin Treasure Jade!?"

Indeed, the intelligence report clearly showed that the mastermind behind the corpse tide's outbreak, a disciple of the Divine Martial Gate, possessed a thumb-sized Profound Origin Grand Yin Treasure Jade!

"If I can obtain this treasure jade, I can immediately cultivate the Profound Yin Soul Absorption Great Method. Given enough time, even the *Grand Yin Form-Shedding Corpse Dissolution True Method* won't be a dream. Considering the rarity of the treasure jade, this is probably my only chance in this life. If I give it up, I'll most likely miss it forever."

"However... if not in this life, then in the next. If I miss it, I miss it!"

Lu Yang's expression darkened, and he sat back down. Despite unexpectedly discovering the long-sought-after Grand Yin Treasure Jade, he felt not the slightest joy.

He only felt a bone-chilling coldness, and his heart was filled with vigilance.

"Whatever I want, it's just delivered to my doorstep? How could there be such a lucky thing in this world? After all, I'm not a Son of Destiny like Xiao Shiye."

What's more, Xiao Shiye's luck was also bestowed by others!

"Could it be that Daoist of Great Fortune again?"

The thought that all of this might again be a Foundation Establishment True Person manipulating karma and secretly scheming made Lu Yang immediately make up his mind.

"I'm not going out!"

The current situation at Skeleton Mountain was treacherous. Staying in the market city and presiding over the array was the safest option. As long as a Foundation Establishment True Person didn't make a move, he would be as stable as Mount Tai.

"Besides, even if I don't go out, it doesn't mean I won't have a chance to get the treasure jade."

Aren't Senior Sister Feixia and the others still there?

After all, the intelligence said they had pursued the enemy. As long as they could seize the treasure jade and escape back to the market city, wouldn't his chance arrive?

Thinking of this, Lu Yang couldn't help but genuinely cheer for Senior Sister Feixia from the bottom of his heart.

Time flew by.

Another day, inside the Blood Robe Tower.

Lu Yang was meditating and refining Qi when he suddenly felt something. He conjured an escape light and arrived outside the tower, gazing into the distance towards the outskirts of the market city.

"Boom! Rumble!"

In the distant sky, thunderous explosions accompanied by spreading clouds of dust rapidly approached the market city from the horizon. It was clearly a pursuit battle with escape lights, and leading the charge was Senior Sister Feixia's extremely distinctive colorful cloud escape light.

"One missing?"

Lu Yang raised an eyebrow. Including himself, there were four late-stage Qi Refining cultivators in Skeleton Mountain's market city: Senior Sister Feixia, Lu Yuanchun, and an unnamed Senior Brother.

However, at this moment, Lu Yang only saw the figures of Senior Sister Feixia and Lu Yuanchun.

"Activate the array."

Lu Yang, unhurriedly, gave the command. The Saint Sect disciples within the market city immediately arranged themselves. Array flags fluttered, and in an instant, a magnificent array was erected.

The Myriad Bones Reversion to True Grand Array!

This array ranked seventh-grade and was a top-tier array for the Qi Refining stage. With Lu Yang presiding over it, he could even contend against a cultivator at the Great Perfection of Qi Refining.

However, the very next second, an unexpected change occurred!

Lu Yuanchun suddenly took out a token, forming hand seals to activate it. He actually directly opened the originally closed grand array, causing a gap to appear.

"Now!"

Almost simultaneously, an extremely excited shout echoed from outside the market city. Following this, several spiritual lights soared out, transforming into array flags distributed in the four directions.

Immediately after, a miniature array appeared in the gap opened by Lu Yuanchun, fixing it in place, so much so that Lu Yang couldn't even close it!

"Divine Martial Gate..."

Lu Yang's brows furrowed slightly. He immediately recognized the attacking party. Clearly, the Divine Martial Gate had been ambushing outside the market city for a long time, just waiting for such an opportunity.

Now that the array had been forcibly propped open with a gap, the Divine Martial Gate could completely use this to break into the market city!

Yet, Lu Yuanchun, the culprit behind all this, merely cast a cold glance at the market city, then soared away in an escape light in the opposite direction!

He clearly understood what he had done, but he didn't care. In fact, he had done it intentionally, treating the market city as an expendable pawn so he could escape with his life. After all, for the Divine Martial Gate, rather than continuing to pursue him, it was better to seize this great opportunity to destroy Skeleton Mountain market city in one fell swoop.

As for the fellow disciples of the Saint Sects within the market city?

Consider them unlucky!
