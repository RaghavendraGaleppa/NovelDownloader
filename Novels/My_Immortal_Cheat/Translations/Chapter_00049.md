**Chapter 49: Dignitaries Arrive**

Most of what happened in the Imperial Capital couldn't escape the notice of these powerful individuals. Prince Qin's Manor's actions in the past few days hadn't been overly concealed, so with a little investigation, they could uncover all the underlying connections and even the subtle maneuvers of the Grand Luo Academy. Although Zhou Tian hadn't invited them, they were idle anyway, so they might as well come and see what kind of trouble this brat from Prince Qin's Manor could stir up.

Entering the VIP exclusive passage, Zhou Tian was directly teleported into his private VIP room. Tian Ling didn't follow; she had a fight today and needed to prepare before the match.

Once inside the VIP room, Zhou Tian realized that it wasn't just the Imperial Capital's big figures who had come today; representatives from the other eight states were also present.

The State of Weapons, the Dao Alliance, the Fools, the Light Sect, Luotian Temple, Gathering Treasures Pavilion, and the Grand Luo Academy—all eight state forces had arrived. This left Zhou Tian slightly bewildered. He wasn't surprised by the Grand Luo Academy's presence, as they had been plotting against him for a long time, specifically to make him lose face, so they would naturally come to watch. But why were the other states here to join the fun? It truly seemed like onlookers didn't mind a big show.

A moment after he sat down, the door to the VIP room knocked. Zhou Tian opened it to reveal Zhou Zui's grinning face, looking nothing like a royal heir, but more like a street hooligan.

"Not bad, Zhou Tian, raging for a fair maiden, huh?" Zhou Zui chuckled, teasing him. Without waiting for permission, he walked in as if it were his own home, flopped onto the sofa, plucked a golden exotic fruit resembling a grape from a nearby table, and popped it into his mouth, a look of satisfaction on his face.

"Our Carefree Prince's heir certainly has excellent sources of information. It seems nothing in the Imperial Capital can escape your notice, old man," Zhou Tian said sarcastically, pushing Zhou Zui's feet off the table.

"How can I compare to Prince Qin's heir? When you make a move, it's always a big one, grabbing people by the handful!" Zhou Zui wasn't one to back down and immediately retorted.

"We call it 'inviting.' They were all carried back by Blue-Eyed Golden-Eyed Beasts. Our Prince Qin's Manor never bullies people by relying on power!" Zhou Tian also plucked a golden exotic fruit and put it in his mouth. It was sweet and sour, quite good.

He knew Zhou Zui was referring to the close relatives of those whom the Grand Luo Academy had contacted. Over the past few days, Prince Qin's Manor's people had brought them all back. They certainly hadn't "grabbed" them, as those people hadn't committed any crimes. Prince Qin's Manor would never do something that would invite public criticism.

"Yes, yes, you are today's protagonist, old man. Whatever you say goes..." Zhou Zui said, flattering him perfunctorily.

"Alright, alright, why are those old geezers so free? What are they doing here joining the fun? Don't tell me there's something else happening today that I don't know about?" Zhou Tian was too lazy to argue with him and changed the subject. He still didn't believe those old geezers were merely here to watch the show.

"Who knows?" Zhou Zui was addicted to the fruit, and a pile of pits had already accumulated beside him.

"I'm going to tell Liu Yan right now that you've had a crush on her for a long time and fantasize about her projection every night!" Zhou Tian said ominously, watching Zhou Zui's nonchalant expression.

Zhou Zui almost tumbled to the ground, his face full of helplessness. "My dear brother, what are you talking about?! Those old geezers are really just here to watch the show. At least, I don't know of anything else happening today."

"Alright," Zhou Tian stared at him for a long time before finally nodding.

Just then, the door to the room knocked again. Zhou Tian gestured with his eyes for Zhou Zui to open it. Under the threat of Zhou Tian's words, Zhou Zui could only obediently stand up and open the door.

This time, it was Liu Yan and Zhou Xunchuan. Liu Yan was clad in crimson, with a melon-seed face and a graceful, curvaceous figure. Her head was slightly tilted, truly the embodiment of a queen. Zhou Xunchuan smiled, dressed in a white robe embroidered with golden divine dragons, looking elegant and handsome.

Seeing these two, Zhou Tian finally nodded. *Now this is the right vibe*, he thought. *What was Zhou Zui anyway?*

Zhou Zui, seeing Liu Yan, remembered what Zhou Tian had just said and nervously shuffled aside.

"Oh~ Isn't this the Carefree Prince's heir? Why aren't you at the Sky Dance Pavilion?" Liu Yan said sarcastically, all traces of her queenly demeanor vanishing, replaced by the look of a neglected wife.

"Hehe..." Zhou Zui's sharp tongue seemed to have been blunted when encountering Liu Yan; he could only offer an awkward laugh.

"Zhou Tian, are you confident about today's events?" Zhou Xunchuan played the role of peacemaker, changing the subject.

"Not entirely confident, but at least eighty percent..." Zhou Tian pondered before replying. Every matter had variables; despite extensive preparations, he couldn't guarantee everything would unfold exactly as planned.

"Eighty percent is enough..." Zhou Xunchuan nodded and continued, "Go all out. This is Heavenly Qin. If anything happens, someone will back you up. Don't worry!"

As they spoke, the room door was knocked on again. This time, it was Zhang Yi, the disciple of the Imperial Preceptor, who arrived. As the door opened, his laughter filled the air: "I cast a divination today and deduced that something significant is bound to happen here!"

Zhang Yi's smile was quite infectious, like a sunny boy from Zhou Tian's previous life. No wonder he had so many infatuated fans in the Imperial Capital; it was said that even some ladies past fifty years of age had long coveted him.

"What a charlatan! Zhou Tian's actions are already known to everyone; do you still need to divine it?" A mocking voice came from behind. It was Sun Dao, the son of Duke Wei. He was also skilled in strategy and calculation, having a love-hate relationship with Zhang Yi. It was rumored that some secret texts circulating in the market, supposedly co-written by them, had even sold out.

One after another, Wu, Zhao Yuan, Li Xuanyi, and Gu Zhen arrived in Zhou Tian's room. Fortunately, the room had an automatic space-expanding array, otherwise, there wouldn't be enough space.

As golden light runes danced everywhere, the space within the room blurred, continuously expanding in length and width. Moments later, the VIP room, nearly ten times larger, reappeared.

More seats also appeared, all made of purple sandalwood dragonwood chairs, incredibly luxurious and possessing various mystical properties. These individuals could now comfortably sit down, each finding a spot. They sat in a row facing the viewing window, through which they could clearly see the situation in the competition venue.

The central area now consisted of only one massive white arena; all other stages had vanished. The surrounding seats were packed with people. If the room couldn't filter noise, they would likely have their eardrums shattered.

A faint, ethereal sound of war drums drifted from an unknown corner. Golden patterns surfaced on the entire building's exterior, emitting shimmering rainbow light with the sounds from the audience, as if breathing. The war drum sounds emanated from these patterns.

As the war drums rumbled, the chaotic sounds from the audience slowly faded. They all knew this was the signal that the competition was about to begin. Although the drums roared, they carried a subtle power to calm the mind. After all, this was a youth competition, not a bloody arena like the Imperial Capital Coliseum, so no hoarse shouts were needed!
