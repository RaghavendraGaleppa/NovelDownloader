# Chapter 92: Madness

He completely ignored the torches of the Xuanjia Army encircling him from the mountainside. The muscles in his calves suddenly tensed, and his entire body shot forward like a stone from a catapult, shattering the condensed clouds and mist before him.

Two Xuanjia soldiers slid down the slope to intercept him, but before their blades could reach, the heavy mace, filled with the howling mountain wind, whipped past and struck them.

The crisp sound of the heavy mace shattering a faceplate mixed with a scream as blood sprayed, dyeing the entire stone steps scarlet.

"You've got nerve, daring to come back up the mountain!"

A校尉 (Captain) wielding a Dragon-Tiger Greatsword, clad in heavy armor, charged forward. The blade, polished like a mirror, reflected his twisted face.

The long sword fell but suddenly halted. Xu Yunfan's muscular right hand had clamped onto the back of the blade.

The captain's pupils constricted violently. He felt the pain of his虎口 (tiger's mouth) tearing as the hundred-refined steel blade was bent by Xu Yunfan's fingers.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained as calm as water, though the veins on his collarbones bulged like earthworms. Swinging the mace in a full arc with a whistling sound, he smashed the fully armored captain into a concave shape, sending him flying off the cliff like a ragdoll and disappearing into the mist.

Three breaths.

Xu Yunfan didn't even wait for the sound of the body hitting the bottom before he had already shot out ten丈 (zhang) away.

The entire process took less than three breaths.

As a fellow Three-Training Martial Master, the force the captain exerted was far too weak in Xu Yunfan's eyes; he couldn't even take a single blow from his mace.

Dark clouds gathered over the peak of Thunder Accumulation Mountain. The Thunder Pagoda stood like a giant black sword piercing the churning thunderclouds.

*Boom!*

A bolt of thunder suddenly fell from the thick clouds, crashing to the ground along the lightning rod of the pagoda.

The iron walls on the surface of the pagoda flickered with a dark blue electric glow, and living things seemed to crawl within the cracks, making a faint "popping" sound.

Entering the peak, Xu Yunfan flared his nostrils. The mountain wind swept over the scorched ground, the air filled with the smell of burnt ozone.

Looking left and right to confirm no one was around, Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate and charged straight into the Thunder Pagoda.

It was dim inside the pagoda, with only a few rays of light penetrating through the gaps at the top.

Relying on the faint light, Xu Yunfan saw a bookshelf ahead. A three-tiered circular bookshelf stood like a coiled snake skeleton, with a yellowed ancient book slanted on the top layer. Xu Yunfan's fingertips brushed over the spine.

Above it were books collected by the Cicada Gate over the generations. These books, whether tattered or brand new, were scattered haphazardly on the shelves.

At first glance, Xu Yunfan saw a book on the desk ahead that had been casually flipped through a few pages. The Cicada Robe manual sandwiched between the pages made him hold his breath. The meridian diagram drawn on the shark silk trembled slightly amidst the thunder's shock, as if a real human skin membrane was covering it.

Xu Yunfan's spirit lifted. Although this martial art wasn't considered top-tier, it was unique in the Muscle Refining Realm. Once mastered, one would possess a true Hardened Body. Moreover, the Cicada Robe, aided by the Cicada Qi, could be compatible with other martial arts without conflict.

This was the main reason he had schemed to obtain this technique.

He flipped to the first page, which recorded the general principles of the Cicada Robe cultivation in ancient characters.

It was the genuine article.

He didn't hesitate anymore, tucking the Cicada Robe into his inner lining. As he turned to leave, he suddenly heard a slight movement from the top of the Thunder Pagoda.

The sound of dragging chains suddenly came from the pagoda's peak, and the smell of rust mixed with blood drifted down the spiral staircase.

Looking back, he saw Chen Tiangang holding a burly old man with white hair and beard, his eyes wide open, walking slowly down the stairs, looking at Xu Yunfan with a smiling expression.

That old man was the Cicada Gate elder who had been living below the Thunder Pagoda. He hadn't expected him to be personally killed by Chen Tiangang.

"Good disciple, do you want to learn the Cicada Robe early?"

Chen Tiangang's voice was laced with a metallic friction-like noise.

He walked down the stairs slowly. His newly regenerated skin had a jade-like luster, and cicada wing patterns appeared on his body, winding and twisting, almost covering his entire body.

What was most terrifying was his right eye. The originally cloudy eyeball was now covered with bloodshot patterns, flickering in sync with the electric arcs on the pagoda walls.

Xu Yunfan's pupils trembled violently.

Chen Tiangang's originally missing right leg was now completely intact.

The only thing that eased Xu Yunfan's mind slightly was that the other party's aura was somewhat unstable.

He maintained a calm expression and said, "Master, regenerating a severed limb must require some cost, right?"

"Of course!"

Chen Tiangang answered without any concealment: "Everything in the world involves gain and loss. To regenerate a severed limb, besides true blood, one needs a foundation of one's own background."

Xu Yunfan fell silent. He didn't want to confront him. The other party was powerful. Even if his strength had dropped significantly due to regenerating his limb, he still had the strength of the Muscle Refining Realm at the very least.

Crossing two major realms to fight an enemy, unless he entered the Linzi State and held the divine weapon, the Gilded Mace, he might have a chance of fighting within three breaths.

After three breaths, if he couldn't achieve an effective result and continued to drain his own potential...

He would lose his lifespan.

Xu Yunfan said, "Since Master still needs to rest, I won't disturb you. I'll take my leave first."

Seeing Xu Yunfan about to leave, Chen Tiangang said calmly, "Now that the secret powers of heaven and earth are gone, aside from true blood and divine weapons, there is no transcendent state. The original cultivation of the Cicada Gate required the entry of the Primordial Spirit to succeed. Although it has been revised by the ancestors over the generations, to cultivate the Cicada Robe now, one can only rely on the Cicada as a guide."

He looked up at Xu Yunfan, who had stopped, and a smile appeared on his face.

"You still want to leave?"

Xu Yunfan remained silent for a moment before speaking: "The Cicada Gate... has already been destroyed."

Chen Tiangang's expression twisted instantly. The cicada wing patterns on his neck suddenly swelled, and the sound of dense chitinous friction came from under his skin. The muscles on his body actually formed lump-like shapes, writhing incessantly beneath the skin, like a swarm of insects.

Xu Yunfan's soles violently kicked the bronze floor of the Thunder Pagoda. Subconsciously activating his Flying Legs, the three-inch-thick metal plate was actually stamped with spiderweb-like cracks. The powerful recoil shot him forward like an arrow, instantly reaching the Thunder Pagoda's gate.

"As long as I am here, as long as I live, how can the Cicada Gate be destroyed? I *am* the Cicada Gate. What can those hundred thousand elite Xuanjia soldiers do? There are thousands of sects, big and small, across the sixty-nine states of the Great Zhou Dynasty's Six Paths. How could they tolerate that witch acting so unscrupulously?

Now that I have repaired my deficiencies and have true blood entering my body, I will surely reach the peak of the Ninth Realm as an ultimate Qi Refining Grandmaster in the future. At that time, I just need to find another place and reopen the mountain gate. The Cicada Gate will naturally rank among the top in the world."

Chen Tiangang casually threw the old man in his hand away. As he let go, Xu Yunfan saw clearly that wisps of blood were sliding from the old man's body, flowing along Chen Tiangang's fingertips into his body, absorbed by the cicada wing patterns.

He's gone mad.

There's no saving him.

I have to leave first. This guy is too bizarre.

His heart shaken, Xu Yunfan secretly shook his head, not wanting to say another word to Chen Tiangang.

"Rebellious disciple!"

As Xu Yunfan turned to leave, Chen Tiangang's cold voice suddenly sounded right beside his ear.

Chen Tiangang's right trouser leg suddenly exploded. His newly grown skin was covered in the tender oil of medicinal soaking.

He exerted force through the arch of his foot, shattering the three stone steps. The load-bearing pillars of the entire Thunder Pagoda made a sound like wood snapping.
