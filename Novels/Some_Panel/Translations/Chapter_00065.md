# Chapter 64: Let Him Fight

Sword qi howled, interweaving with the azure axe light. Two different colored glows clashed amidst a dense crackling sound. Countless rays of light scattered outwards, forming a luminous orb that shimmered with alluring yet perilous colors.

Clang, clang, clang!

A cacophony of metal on stone rang out, sparks flying everywhere.

Just as the two were locked in a stalemate, Yang Ji suddenly amplified his sword intent. With a thunderous boom, sword qi erupted, sending Man Kui flying back, axe and all.

At this moment, Man Kui's heart pounded wildly, his eyes filled with disbelief. This person's sword intent seemed bottomless. How was that possible?

Before his shock could subside, Yang Ji moved abruptly. He ascended like a graceful swan, drifting lightly to land on Man Kui's shoulder under the astounded gazes of the crowd.

Before Man Kui even landed, he felt a weight on his shoulder. Looking up, he saw Yang Ji stomping down.

Boom!

His body plummeted like a stone, and with a "Thud," half of Man Kui's body sank directly into the ground. A flicker of pain crossed his eyes. Man Kui felt his internal organs churning, and a muffled groan escaped his lips.

"Senior Brother Man Kui was suppressed?" the crowd gasped in surprise.

"You lost!" Yang Ji said calmly, standing on his shoulder.

"No! My beast blood hasn't been activated yet! I can still be stronger! I can't lose!" Man Kui's tiger eyes widened, and he roared in defiance. As he bellowed, crimson patterns on his body glowed with blood-light, his beast blood activated with a rumble, and he tried to surge upwards.

But Yang Ji merely gave him a cold glance, his flying sword pressed against Man Kui's neck, not uttering a word. If he were to rise, the sword would undoubtedly pierce his neck.

"Hmph! Don't embarrass me anymore," Granny Tianshang suddenly snorted coldly at Man Kui.

Seeing this, Man Kui reluctantly reined in his surging beast blood. Yang Ji withdrew his sword and slowly walked to the side.

He now realized that the gap between a genius and an ordinary person was simply too vast. He hadn't even unleashed ten percent of his sword intent, yet he had already suppressed Man Kui. If he had gone all out, Man Kui would likely have died a million times over with a single sword strike.

"Junior Brother, well done. You know how to hide your strength," Li Changxiao transmitted to him, without avoiding Jian Yuanzi.

Jian Yuanzi chuckled softly, transmitting, "Hiding your strength isn't necessarily bad. If people can't fathom your true depth, you're safe."

"Granny Tianshang, it seems we've won this first match," Jian Yuanzi smiled.

"Hmph! It doesn't count. My disciple-grandson Man Kui hasn't unleashed his full strength, so it's not a loss. We'll send someone else," Granny Tianshang snorted, glancing at the person behind her.

Immediately, a young man with a long saber on his back stepped forward, his expression solemn, and declared, "Ren Jingtian, here to experience fellow Daoist's sword techniques!"

"Granny Tianshang, are you trying to renege?" Jian Yuanzi's expression hardened. His robes fluttered without wind, and wisps of sword qi diffused outwards, filling the air with sharp edges.

"Jian Yuanzi, do you intend to fight me?" Granny Tianshang's face changed, and her voice suddenly became sharp.

"Master, don't be angry. If they want to fight, we'll just fight them," Yang Ji suddenly smiled and stepped forward again.

"I'll only make one strike. This strike contains my lifelong understanding of the saber dao. If it cannot defeat you, then I lose." Ren Jingtian's eyes gleamed sharply, his aura surged, and the long saber on his back trembled violently, activated by his qi.

With a dull "hum" of the saber, it automatically unsheathed with lightning speed. By the time Ren Jingtian held it and unleashed a thirty-meter-long, unparalleled saber light, barely a breath had passed. It was truly done in a single flow.

Boom!

Raising the long saber above his head, Ren Jingtian was decisive, fearlessly slashing downwards at an angle. The unparalleled saber light erupted with a piercing shriek, accompanied by a mind-shattering sound-killing power that struck at the soul and enveloped all directions. One strike unleashed, containing two killing moves, as swift as thunder, dazzlingly fast.

Yet, Yang Ji remained unmoved. With the same simple posture, he raised his hand and drew his sword, unleashing a move that intertwined two sword intents, a crushing strike imbued with an inexplicable colossal power, fearlessly meeting Ren Jingtian's domineering saber.

This very saber strike once boasted the glorious record of slaying a wounded demon commander. Yet, facing Yang Ji's sword, the saber light instantly annihilated, crushed and extinguished by endless sword qi, vanishing into thin air.

The sword qi's momentum remained unchecked, transforming into a pale blue flying sword that hovered before Ren Jingtian's brow. It wasn't until a drop of blood seeped from his glabella that Ren Jingtian, drenched in cold sweat, realized he had been defeated.

He considered himself a genius, having observed the battle for a long time, convinced that Yang Ji could never withstand the saber strike he put his full effort into. He never imagined he would be defeated so quickly, so thoroughly. If this were a life-and-death battle, the sword qi before him would undoubtedly pierce his glabella, obliterate his soul, and extinguish his life in an instant.

He was defeated, by a single sword strike, a strike unleashed by someone only in the Middle Foundation Establishment stage. He felt boundless loss in his heart. Such a gap was like an unbridgeable chasm, difficult for him to accept. He still held onto the hope that it was due to the low-grade nature of his technique.

He slowly lowered the long saber in his hand, his expression complex, holding onto a sliver of hope as he quietly asked, "Fellow Daoist, what grade of sword technique did you use?"

"As you guessed!" Yang Ji saw through his thoughts and said calmly.

"Indeed..." Ren Jingtian took a deep breath, the stone in his heart settling. He could accept defeat, but not such a crushing one; his pride wouldn't allow it.

But looking at Yang Ji's confident gaze, he still smiled bitterly. He knew that the higher the grade of a technique, the harder it was to comprehend. He had delved into the top-tier technique, "Falling Heaven Saber," for over twenty years, yet had only just barely touched upon mastery. Yet, the person before him was younger than he was, and the grand divine ability he wielded was far more practiced and terrifying than his own saber technique. A person with such outstanding comprehension, even if they cultivated the same technique, the one before him would still be ahead, and he would ultimately be the one defeated. This was a dimensional reduction strike delivered by innate comprehension talent.

Realizing that both his comprehension and techniques were inferior, Ren Jingtian sighed wistfully, yet paradoxically felt relieved.

At this moment, as they looked at Yang Ji standing imposingly, another person emerged from behind Granny Tianshang. This person had a solemn expression, his eyes devoid of any prior contempt. He spoke in a deep voice, "My name is Jian Chuan. Like Junior Brother Ren, I will only unleash one sword strike. This strike encompasses all the profound mysteries of my sword technique. If fellow Daoist can withstand it, then I concede defeat."

"Be careful!"

Jian Chuan covered the distance in two steps as one, instantly darting forward. At the same time, with a flick of his wrist, the flying sword behind him was violently drawn.

Clang!

A sword hum rang out, like the lingering call of a bird from the Ninth Heaven, reaching one's heart, making one feel as if they had fallen into a peach blossom paradise, forgetting all danger. Jian Chuan's sword was very peculiar: very round and thin, like a spear, yet only as thick as a thumb, with an incredibly sharp tip.

Whoosh!

As the sword thrust forth, the air was immediately torn open. A point of white light suddenly appeared at the sword's tip, brilliant and dazzling, making it impossible to look directly at. In an instant, it reached several zhang away from Yang Ji.

Facing this sword, Yang Ji was somewhat surprised. Perhaps as a fellow swordsman, he made a rare comment. "Your sword technique not only possesses an illusionary attribute and dazzling sword light, but most fatally, it has extreme speed and contains unparalleled sharpness."

"The sword's extreme speed is concentrated to a point; the smallest point minimizes resistance."

"Once this sword is unleashed, it's a sure-kill for most late Foundation Establishment cultivators, leaving them no room to resist."
