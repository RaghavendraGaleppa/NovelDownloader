# Chapter 77: Divine Abilities

Zhou Qing examined Yuan Mingyue's condition with a thoughtful expression before placing his hand atop her head.

Yuan Mingyue felt a warm energy emanating from her master's palm, which quickly grew intense, dispelling the chill from her body. The entire room became comfortably warm.

But soon, the heat became unbearable.

"It's too hot, too hot," Yuan Mingyue screamed inwardly, though no sound escaped her lips.

Moments later, the warmth turned scalding.

Just as she was about to faint, she heard a soothing deer call, like celestial music. Every pore in her body opened, filling her with indescribable comfort.

Then her master withdrew his hand. His body radiated heat like a furnace, drying her sweat-drenched clothes instantly.

"Get up."

Yuan Mingyue obediently rose. Her master patted her shoulder, sending a surge of energy through her body, followed by a shiver.

After the shiver passed, the sticky sensation from her earlier sweat vanished, leaving her feeling clean and refreshed.

"Thank you, Master. Was that some kind of magic?" Yuan Mingyue asked curiously. From ancient texts, she knew that those who reached the Xiantian realm possessed extraordinary abilities—divine arts and spells.

"When martial arts reach an extremely high level, one's body becomes like a lotus leaf, untouched by dust. I merely let you experience this. It's nothing extraordinary. If you must call it magic, it's akin to a 'Dust-Cleaning Spell.'"

The ability to instantly cleanse and refresh her body filled Yuan Mingyue with longing. "Master, how high must one's martial arts reach to achieve this?"

Zhou Qing pondered briefly. "About as high as Old Zhang's level."

"Old Zhang? You mean Zhang Zhenren?"

Zhou Qing nodded.

Yuan Mingyue: "..."

Speechless, she couldn't help but wonder—did her master consider himself superior to Zhang Zhenren? After a moment, she composed herself and asked, "Master, were you treating me just now? But my illness is already cured."

Zhou Qing: "You weren't ill—just special."

"Special?"

"Your physique is too weak, yet your soul is far stronger than an ordinary person's. As a result, your body's qi and blood can't sustain your soul, causing your health to deteriorate. The heart, being the hub of qi and blood circulation, was the first to fail. After taking the Heart-Nourishing Pill, your heart recovered. Combined with your growth and the rare medicinal herbs and supplements provided by the prince's household, your condition was delayed. But this only treats the symptoms, not the root cause. If this continues, you'll likely die young."

Zhou Qing couldn't help but reflect on life's unpredictability.

Fushan and Fusong had broken through to the Xiantian realm but went mad due to insufficient soul refinement. Yet here was someone born with an exceptionally strong soul who, even without cultivation methods, could naturally reach the soul-refinement level required for Xiantian breakthrough as she aged and gained experience.

What Fushan and Fusong lacked most was what Yuan Mingyue possessed innately. But Yuan Mingyue lacked their abundant qi and blood.

Zhou Qing, however, had both, allowing him to smoothly break through to Xiantian.

"So if I train under you, Master, can I compensate for my qi and blood deficiency?"

"Yes and no."

"Why?"

"Cultivation is a lonely path. It requires unwavering dedication, always prioritizing practice above all else. Can you do that?"

"I don't know. I can try." She believed she could endure—her long illness had taught her patience and solitude. But she wouldn't claim certainty without proof.

"Indeed, cultivation requires proof through practice. Only by trying can you know. For now, don't dwell on the esoteric scriptures I deciphered. At your current level, you can't harness them." Zhou Qing's tone was solemn, a clear warning.

From a cultivation standpoint, Yuan Mingyue was the most talented disciple he'd encountered besides himself. Countless people trained their qi and blood, but few were born with such a strong soul.

Based on his own experience, Zhou Qing knew a powerful spirit greatly aided breakthroughs to Xiantian and beyond. A strong mind also brought calmness and clarity in crises.

Moreover, Zhou Qing sensed something deeper during his examination. Yuan Mingyue's body harbored a pure yin energy, more refined than even the Great Mulberry Tree's. If disturbed, it could kill her instantly, so he refrained from probing further.

"This must be a unique constitution. Pity I know so little about such physiques." Drawing from his cultivation insights and medical knowledge from the "Spring Return Scripture," Zhou Qing believed Yuan Mingyue's pure yin energy would eventually aid his own cultivation.

As her nominal master, he had a month to study her while improving her qi and blood—lest she perish prematurely.

Unconsciously, he'd adopted a paternal mindset.

---

Days later, Fushan and Fusong briefly regained sanity. Seeing Zhou Qing achieve Xiantian without enduring heavenly tribulation—and remaining sane—Fusong fell into silent despair.

After a few words, he went mad again.

Whether feigned or genuine, madness was his fate.

No wonder myths spoke of the Queen Mother's Peach Banquet, where immortals gathered. Surely, tales of cultivators had inspired such legends.

Immortals needed immortal fare—only the finest would suffice.

A month passed. Zhou Qing neared proficiency in the "Fierce Tiger Slaughter Scripture" and checked Yuan Mingyue's progress.

"I thought you'd either overexert yourself or struggle with the hardships. Yet you've patiently practiced the Crane Form I taught you, neither rushing nor slacking."

Zhou Qing's gaze held rare approval.

Haste or laxity ruined cultivation. Steady, measured effort brought true progress—neither too fast nor too slow.

Yuan Mingyue brightened at his praise, though sadness tinged her joy. Her time with Zhou Qing had ended, and she'd miss his guidance.

Her health had undeniably improved under his care. Even her monthly cycles, once agonizing, were now bearable.

Suffering taught her to cherish her body, driving her to nurture it with remarkable will and wisdom.

"Thank you, Master." She bowed sincerely.

Zhou Qing smiled. "Rise."

His strong hand rested on her head once more—a master's blessing, imparting longevity.

Time was on his side. Building influence and nurturing talent could proceed gradually.

Though his qi and blood could banish cold, sustaining it was impossible—one man's strength had limits.

Yet cultivation's allure lay in pursuing the infinite through the finite.

The path was arduous, not to be traversed hastily.

Patience sufficed.

During his stay at Taihe Sect, Zhou Qing networked with powerful families and local factions. Now, even his sharp senses detected no malice.

Elevated status surrounded him with goodwill, making past friendships—forged in humility—all the more precious.

Thus, he'd continue aiding Miss Lin and Butcher Hu—so long as it didn't hinder his own cultivation.

Once left far behind, they'd never catch up.

But Zhou Qing wouldn't slow his stride.

How far must this path stretch? He knew only to walk it steadfastly, giving his all.

After recent tumult, tranquility returned.

Between teaching Miss Lin and Yuan Mingyue, Zhou Qing delved deeper into the "Fierce Tiger Slaughter Scripture."

The tiger bones gifted by Prince Qinghe proved invaluable—originally from a Tibetan monk, they resonated mystically with his practice.

The bones carried an enigmatic soul resonance.

Chanting esoteric mantras, Zhou Qing's training alternated between tiger roars and thunderous tones—now piercing, now imperious.

Within his meditation chamber, an aura of domineering ferocity erupted.

Outside, Fushan and Fusong stirred, eyes blazing with fury—until Zhishan's calming mantra soothed them.

Even Zhang Jingxiu now treated Zhishan as an equal.

When the two mad daoists obeyed only Zhishan, none dared provoke them—especially Zhang, who knew Xiantian's terrors.

Against Fushan alone, he stood no chance.

Fushan's Xiantian transformation was complete; his qi and blood surpassed even Zhang's.

Zhou Qing admitted that facing both, he'd lose.

The "Fierce Tiger Slaughter Scripture" exuded killing intent, agitating the daoists. But with Zhishan present, Zhou Qing feared no mishap.

Moreover, his Soul Suppression art could restrain Fushan. As for Fusong—when had he ever feared him?

Opening his eyes slowly, Zhou Qing's spirit gathered the tiger bones' essence, weaving it into a translucent "Fierce Tiger Robe" that draped over him, radiating majesty.

His journey had begun with Tiger Play, visualizing the beast's spirit. Now, the "Fierce Tiger Slaughter Scripture" felt fated.

The robe's emergence instilled a ghost-subduing aura. In battle, it would amplify his divine presence, intimidating foes.

He dismissed it swiftly—maintaining it drained his spirit.

Next, he perused ancient bamboo scrolls from Prince Qinghe, penned by a sage whose words enlightened generations.

Under Zhou Qing's spiritual gaze, the text shimmered with undying radiance.

"Another path to immortality—but not mine." The sage's wisdom only fortified his resolve.

Consulting his "Health Ledger," he noted:

Fierce Tiger Slaughter Scripture (Beginner).

Proficiency would come in time, but mastery required greater spiritual strength.

Post-Xiantian, his qi and blood had strengthened slightly, marginally accelerating his qi refinement.

"Self-refinement is too slow. Pills are the answer."

Alchemical cultivation was orthodox—extracting essence from pills rather than one's own vitality. Moreover, pills far outpaced absorbing meager natural energies.

"Spirit herbs aiding Xiantian cultivation are rare, but my expanded influence can uncover them. Previously, Miss Lin and Butcher Hu couldn't access such secrets. Now, higher-tier resources are within reach."

After seizing the Shang Family's vault, Butcher Hu found two useful herbs: a spiritual snow ginseng from the Great Snow Mountains and a millennium-old fleeceflower root bestowed by the emperor.

Other herbs, though precious, were only fit for pre-Xiantian warriors or pill-making—like fasting pellets. While beneficial for bodily purification, overconsumption of grains now harmed Zhou Qing's refined constitution.

Occasional indulgence sufficed.

His heightened palate found common fare bland.

No wonder myths spoke of celestial banquets—cultivators' feasts must have inspired mortal imaginations.

Immortals demanded immaculate cuisine.
