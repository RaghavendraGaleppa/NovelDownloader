# Chapter 354: The Fierce Demon Cultists and the Art of Battle (1/2)

“Can you continue tracking?”

“Hall Master, this technique is affected in areas with too many people. I cannot sense it precisely.”

A group of merchants dressed as Demon Cultists had already blended into Qingmu City.

Luo Yexian wanted his subordinates to use their secret technique to track the direction of the Power of All Living Beings, but the gaunt middle-aged man shook his head, indicating he could not do it.

At most, he could confirm that the existence absorbing the Power of All Living Beings was within Qingmu City.

“Hall Master, why don’t we just turn Qingmu City upside down? That will force the thief who stole the Power of All Living Beings to come out!”

A buck-toothed priest snorted coldly, his face full of killing intent.

“Are you a Patrol Sky Guard?”

“!! Hall Master, I am loyal to the Holy Church, as clear as the sun and moon! You know this!”

“Then why are you shouting so loudly? Do you think you’re a Patrol Sky Guard? We are the Demon Cult, the Demon Cult!”

“Turning Qingmu City upside down? The tens of thousands of soldiers and armor in the Qingmu Camp would send you flying instead!”

Luo Yexian’s eyelids twitched slightly. He had a clear understanding of his identity.

This was also why he could become a Hall Master and a confidant of the Holy Son.

It had absolutely nothing to do with him being a relative of the Holy Son.

The buck-toothed priest shrank his neck, thinking to himself that the Hall Master’s voice seemed quite loud too.

Hearing this, the Demon Cultists recalled the terror of the Qingmu defenders during the city attack that day, like wolves and tigers, as well as the fear brought by those two geniuses ranked in the top five of the Hidden Dragon List.

Back then, with over a hundred thousand men, a group of high-level Disaster Beasts, and the National Teacher personally commanding them, they still failed to capture Qingmu City.

Obviously, they did not have the ability to cause trouble in Qingmu City now.

Hmm!

The Hall Master was indeed steady. No wonder the Holy Son entrusted him with all matters.

The gaunt middle-aged priest asked, “Hall Master, what should we do next?”

“Do nothing.”

“????”

“Since we cannot determine the other party’s whereabouts, we will just stay in the city and wait for changes.”

Luo Yexian narrowed his eyes and said slowly:

“The other party will eventually leave Qingmu City. Only then will we naturally find this so-called Celestial Sovereign. Why should we alert the snake?”

The cultists listened and felt that what Luo Yexian said made sense.

So, after discussing it, they decided to find an inn to stay in Qingmu City first.

As they walked, they inexplicably smelled a familiar aroma.

Looking up, they saw a bustling restaurant. It was late at night, yet many people were still queuing. There was a large wooden sign at the entrance:

‘Same Secret Recipe as Xiao Li Overlord BBQ!’

“Hall Master, is this the BBQ that made many brothers feel dizzy with fragrance that day?!”

“Why don’t we just stay here!”

“I wanted to know what that BBQ smelled like back then... Ahem, let’s check it out so we won’t be fooled in the future. Slurp...”

Luo Yexian’s expression changed, and he gritted his teeth, snorting coldly:

“Hmph, little BBQ, I’ll eat you to death today.”

This group of Demon Cultists, brimming with ferocity, rushed toward the BBQ stall in front of the inn.

However, just as they passed through the crowd, before they could even order—

“What are you cutting in line for? What kind of people are you? Don’t you have any public order or civility?”

“So uncultured, these people. They look uneducated.”

“It’s one thing for one person to cut, but so many of you? Do you have any public morality? I have to go to work tomorrow morning!”

The martial artists and commoners who had their line cut pointed fingers at this group of Demon Cultists.

Luo Yexian gritted his teeth. He was the mighty Hall Master of the Hundred Beasts Hall, the terrifying Demon Cult Star, ranked seventy-ninth on the Earth Ranking, yet he had to queue for BBQ?

He took a deep breath:

“Fine! We’ll queue!”

He was mainly enduring this humiliation for the sake of the Church’s grand plan!

The group of Demon Cultists lined up with fierce expressions again.

........

Inside the inn room.

Most of the cake was left. The Ice Cube used ice to make a box to store it, putting it into the spatial artifact. The next time they ate it, it would probably be an ice cream cake.

Shang Qin returned to the Green Luan Clan territory. Originally, she wanted to follow Li Mo and Ying Bing all the way back.

But on second thought, with Shang Wu’s personality, she might come to meet them halfway. The probability of them meeting was not high, but it was not impossible.

Meanwhile, Li Mo was in the room, discussing the art of battle with the Ice Cube.

Hmmmm.

It couldn't really be called a discussion.

It was more like the Ice Cube teacher imparting knowledge unilaterally. Xiao Li student even felt the same feeling as when he asked her about swordsmanship back then.

Don't let the Ice Cube's cold and beautiful, fairy-like appearance fool you; she is no vase.

Her attainments in fighting might be on par with Shang Wu.

Of course, if fighting required keeping one's mouth shut and not using underhanded tricks, fighting fair and square, the Ice Cube was more powerful.

Shang Wu focused on the principle that warfare is about deception.

While the Ice Cube turned battle into art.

And, the Ice Cube knew better how to be a good teacher.

Night gradually deepened.

In the quiet room, the Ice Fairy’s soft voice could be heard. The soft light of the night pearl cast their shadows onto the window screen.

It was clearly time to rest, but Li Mo’s eyes were shining with fighting spirit.

“I understand it all. I’ll try it out in the dream later.”

He had mentioned earlier that relying on a strange treasure, he could project his opponent in a dream.

“Then I will practice too. If you have any more questions, ask me.”

“I won’t. That little Golden Crow, I will definitely take it down tonight!”

Li Mo was filled with the Queen of Phoenixes’ art of battle.

“Then go ahead, Celestial Sovereign.”

Ying Bing’s slender brows drooped slightly, helplessness in her eyes.

He probably thought he understood a lot, but in reality, he still had a lot to learn.

How could a fighting spirit be cultivated overnight? It requires experiencing many life-and-death baptisms.

......

Inside the World Seed.

“Battle is an art.”

“Did you understand everything I just said?”

The Celestial Sovereign’s tone was light and indifferent, exuding an air of confidence in commanding the situation. If the Ice Cube were here, she might find it somewhat familiar...

“I understand, Teacher... Teacher is much more comprehensive than I thought.”

Jiang Chulong’s eyes behind the cloth shone brightly.

She had been summarizing things on her own after waking up yesterday, but what she came up with was still not as much as the teacher’s.

Teacher is indeed Teacher.

Soon, the Celestial Sovereign’s mini-class ended.

Little Princess Jiang threw herself into the intense and exciting practical combat session. It was evident that she was truly quick to grasp. Her performance today was clearly much better than yesterday.

From being crushed at the beginning, she had now started to find opportunities to counterattack.

“This is probably what the Ice Cube meant by the rhythm and cadence of battle?”

“Being weaker than the opponent means falling into their rhythm, becoming increasingly passive and suppressed.”

“What I need to do now is to get familiar with the Golden Crow projection’s rhythm first, then slowly find my own rhythm, until I drag the opponent into it.”

Li Mo had a hunch.

He might have quite a harvest tonight.
