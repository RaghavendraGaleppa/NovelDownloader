# Chapter 18: Hello, Brother Ma

"Of course, but you'd need to reach the Foundation Establishment stage, become an outer sect disciple, and then you could join any hall you wish. Also, you'd have to ensure your spirit field's yield is sufficient for the sect." Liu Yun continued to explain.

Ding Rui finally understood. "So it seems spiritual farmers have quite a bit of autonomy."

"Naturally. If a spiritual farmer truly wants to achieve something, their autonomy and benefits aren't much worse than an outer sect disciple's. After all, resources are something the sect will always need, and spiritual farmers are a rare type among excellent disciples."

...

After Old Huang left, Spirit Field 377 returned to its quiet state.

Ding Rui was solely responsible for pest control, meaning he would receive two shares of resources at harvest time. With him eradicating the giant aphids, this batch of spirit rice in Spirit Field 377 suffered virtually no losses, and the harvest was bound to reach a new high.

Besides dedicating more time to cultivation and occasionally going out to help other spirit fields deal with giant aphids, Ding Rui also had another task: feeding the Azure Bee Knight. The Azure Bee Knight still hadn't awakened its intelligence. According to Mi, it could take as little as a year for a bee cultivator to awaken, or as long as two to three years. Mi had no better suggestions, so Ding Rui could only wait.

A month later, Liu Yun successfully cultivated the Earth Qi Art. This displaced another cultivator who was practicing the Earth Qi Art to a different spirit field.

Ding Rui also took the time to visit the logistics department to claim his reward for successfully cultivating a second cultivation technique. The logistics manager was somewhat surprised to see Ding Rui again. He had heard about Ding Rui's ability to kill giant aphids and was happy for him, but he never imagined Ding Rui could cultivate a second technique. After all, the talent for the Golden Radiance Art and general cultivation talent weren't the same. But when Ding Rui indeed displayed the True Essence of the Rain Dew Art, the manager was instantly stunned.

After processing Ding Rui's reward with a bewildered expression, he couldn't help but ask, "Junior Brother, did you gain some profound insight after cultivating the Golden Radiance Art last time? Otherwise, how could you possibly..."

Ding Rui naturally knew the manager was referring to how he had cultivated a second technique in less than the usual two years. Of course, he couldn't mention skill slots. After a moment of thought, he said, "Actually, I only recently discovered I have a certain talent. I call it 'Accumulate and Burst Forth.' Perhaps it's this talent at work." Having said that, Ding Rui quickly took his leave to avoid further questions.

The spirit field manager watched Ding Rui depart, his face even more puzzled. "'Accumulate and Burst Forth'?"

This time, Ding Rui received a greater reward than the first time.

"Why should we become like you humans? Can you also become like us horses?" Ma Wen asked, a bewildered look on his face.

Ding Rui finally understood that there seemed to be no concept of 'transformation' for animals in this world. He thought for a moment, then asked, "Brother Ma, what do you horse cultivators become when you reach the highest realm?"

"How would I know?"

"How could you not know?"

"I've never seen it! There aren't any horse cultivators that powerful in the Huaqing Realm. Do you even know what you human cultivators become when you reach the highest realm?"

"Uh... I don't know either..." Ding Rui replied, feeling a bit awkward.

As a transmigrator, he knew almost nothing about the history or current state of this world. He had spent nearly all his time cultivating, and he noticed that no one around him seemed to care about such things either.

"Do the beings of this world not care about history?" Ding Rui wondered, feeling puzzled. He then asked, "Brother Ma, do you know how big our Huaqing Realm is?"

"No idea."

"Brother Ma, how can you know nothing, just like me!"

"So you admit you're just like me? Can you even leave the sect right now?" Ma Wen rounded a bend, then turned his head to roll his eyes at Ding Rui. "There are so many evil cultivators outside. Anyone who goes out dies. Living well here, who cares how big the Huaqing Realm is?"

Evil cultivators!

Ding Rui heard that term again.
