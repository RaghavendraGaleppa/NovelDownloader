# Chapter 58: The First Ambush Falls Short

**[Liang Region Upheaval (Part 1): First defeating Jin Sanming, then slaying Wang Chongguang—the news shook the northern lands. Firecloud Zhenren, fearful of your growing power, attempted a surprise attack under cover of night. By the Blackwater River, he unexpectedly encountered Night Princess Tang Qingyan.]**

Tang Qingyan had come to the Blackwater River late at night, intending to admire the moon's reflection in the water to aid her enlightenment. Little did she expect to cross paths with Firecloud Zhenren. Recalling how her clansman, who had escorted military provisions across thousands of miles, had been hunted down by Firecloud Zhenren's men, old grievances and new hatred flared within her.

A fierce battle erupted between them. Firecloud Zhenren had no choice but to fight back. After over a hundred exchanges, he found himself outmatched and fled in disarray. Tang Qingyan pursued relentlessly, their clash spanning over a hundred li, stirring towering waves. The battle between these two Earth Ranking grandmasters shook the world.

Three years after returning to the northern lands, Firecloud Zhenren had barely made a move before being chased down by Tang Qingyan. He barely escaped with his life, losing an arm in the process, only saved by the intervention of Golden Feather Guard Commander Lin Sanxing.

Unaware of these events, you departed the northern lands, passing through Liang Region on your way back to Xiangzhou. The brewing storm had dissipated before it even began.

During your journey, you arrived in Daliang City, where you encountered an elder—Du Changwang, leader of the Daliang Du Clan and a Pure Yang grandmaster.

The two of you conversed amiably. He advised you to leave Liang Region promptly, as unrest was brewing. Gongshu Duwang, master of the Mechanist Sect, had long since restored the ancient blueprint for the Colossus and spent years secretly constructing it. In recent years, he had been maneuvering within the city, aiming to dominate Liang Region entirely.

With the wealth of Liang Region, he sought to build a mechanical city—dubbed the Celestial Palace.

Hearing of the Colossus, you couldn't help but recall the Changzhou Ghost Incident. Back then, while investigating the cannibalistic culprit, you had stumbled into a mysterious place and obtained a fragment of a blueprint—one that depicted the Colossus.

Intrigued, you decided to seek out Gongshu Duwang.

**[One Month of Hard Training Reward: Sword Flight (Basic Version)! (Completed!)]**

As evening fell, Dou Changsheng glanced at the system interface and was greeted by this display of absurdly fortunate developments.

*Is this even human?*

Firecloud Zhenren, a grandmaster of the Earth Ranking, had merely entertained thoughts of killing you—and as a result, he was hunted down by Tang Qingyan, nearly losing his life and sacrificing an arm in the process. Such injuries were irreversible; his combat prowess would diminish drastically, making him prime prey for other grandmasters seeking to climb the rankings.

Many would surely challenge him now, hoping to trample over his reputation to elevate their own. Whether Firecloud Zhenren could maintain his position on the Earth Ranking was now in question.

*What a tragic figure.*

*Now this is what I call living.*

Dou Changsheng couldn't help but marvel at the spectacle. Yet his thoughts soon turned to the Colossus. *What exactly is this thing?* With so little information, his mind drew a blank. Even his imagination failed to conjure an answer.

He reviewed the Earth Ranking, searching for Gongshu Duwang. *Dominating Liang Region, constructing a mechanical city called the Celestial Palace—such ambition and vision couldn't belong to an ordinary figure.* Only someone of Earth Ranking caliber would dare such audacity.

He quickly found the entry. While the northern lands boasted five Earth Ranking experts, Liang Region had three. Gongshu Duwang ranked twentieth on the Earth Ranking, bearing the title "Divine Craftsman of a Hundred Forges."

The world had never known peace, not since ancient times. Ambitious schemers rose and fell like actors on a stage. First the northern lands, now Liang Region—the Northern Jin Dynasty was in chaos. Other regions were likely no better. Wherever power and ambition converged, turmoil followed.

*This level of strength is about right.* Those in the top ten of the Earth Ranking were monarch-toppling figures, while the top twenty could easily overturn entire regions. Dou Changsheng understood this well.

Take Chen Qingyao and the Demonic Master, for instance—neither gave a whit about emperors. Chen Qingyao at least pretended; the Demonic Master didn't bother. If displeased, he'd march into the palace and slap the emperor, then sleep in the imperial bed at night. The most ruthless part? He never bothered controlling the palace. He let the emperor scurry about, recruiting warriors and summoning experts, only to crush them all in the end.

*Thanks to Future Dou—at least when he feasts, I get to sip the broth.*

Casually, Dou Changsheng claimed his mission reward. A mental chant surfaced in his mind, followed by a flood of memories—scenes of diligent practice. His first attempts at sword flight, the early failures, the gradual progress until he could soar hundreds of meters with ease. Eventually, he mastered it completely.

*Sword Flight.* A useful ability indeed, perfectly compensating for his current shortcomings.

At the Innate Realm, one could only leap briefly into the air. True flight required reaching the Mystic Marvel Grandmaster stage, and even then, speed barely surpassed that of an ordinary horse—though the ability to travel in straight lines made it far more efficient. Only upon reaching Pure Yin or Pure Yang did flight speed increase significantly.

This basic version of Sword Flight wasn't true sword manipulation—just a means of aerial movement using external objects. But Dou Changsheng was content. *As long as I can fly, anyone below the Grandmaster level can forget about catching me.*

The only drawback was the heavy consumption of Innate Qi. For most, it would be a last-resort skill, with horseback remaining the primary mode of travel. But for Dou Changsheng, his recovery rate outpaced the expenditure.

His recent training had doubled his reserves of Innate Qi, making them even more formidable. Combined with his Divine Intent Slash, anyone below the Great Completion stage of Innate Realm—lacking supreme techniques—would fall to a single strike.

The *Triple Origin Return Qi Art* fostered an unshakable confidence, a pride that elevated his combat prowess far beyond his apparent level. This was the true strength of a supreme technique—unassuming yet foundational, the bedrock of all his abilities.

On the official road, dust swirled into the air like a coiling dragon, fierce and untamed. A lone rider galloped at breakneck speed, his passage thunderous as an army's charge.

Dou Changsheng watched as the rider shot past, his Innate Qi forming a barrier against the dust. Suddenly, the rider yanked his reins, forcing his steed to rear up before landing heavily, hooves carving craters into the ground. The man turned his mount, glaring down at Dou Changsheng with cold recognition.

"I thought I'd mistaken you earlier," the rider sneered. "But it really is you—Dou Changsheng."

"You killed my brother, Jin Sanming."

"This grudge cannot coexist under heaven."

"By rights, we should duel to the death."

"But meeting you here, under these circumstances... something's amiss."

"The road is wide—let each go their own way."

"If fate brings us together again, we can settle old scores then."

"Or perhaps laugh them away and join forces for survival."

"Farewell—hopefully forever!"
