# Chapter 52: The Nectar of Precious Medicine  

"Brother Dao, you're standing up already!" Xiao Liu rushed to Han Yue's side in astonishment.  

"My silver hairpin contained pre-prepared healing medicine. After taking it, my injuries are no longer a concern," Han Yue replied.  

"That medicine works wonders! It'll save Sister from worrying."  

"Brother Dao, why do you suddenly seem so... delicious?"  

Han Yue rubbed his nose and remained silent.  

He was continuously channeling his magic power into his [Nectar] ability, steadily producing the miraculous liquid. By his calculations, in just half a day, not only would his injuries be fully healed, but his physical constitution would also improve.  

Under Han Yue's magic circulation, he could condense about a hundred drops of [Nectar] per day. Yet, healing his severe injuries required less than half of that. Once fully recovered, he would have plenty of [Nectar] left to enhance his body further.  

Han Yue couldn't help but feel confident in his physical cultivation. If he could sustain long-term refinement with [Nectar], his physique would undoubtedly surpass that of his peers.  

Sitting cross-legged, Han Yue silently cultivated, continuously generating [Nectar] to restore his body. He felt like a shattered mirror—each drop of [Nectar] meticulously pieced his fragments back together, miraculously filling and smoothing every crack until he was whole again, flawless and complete.  

The healing process, infused with the nourishing essence of life, was incredibly soothing, lifting his spirits and easing his mind.  

As his condition improved, the rate of [Nectar] production finally outpaced his needs. A single drop of [Nectar] remained intact in his body, circulating with his blood.  

When it passed through his dantian, the dormant [Heavenly Origin Imperial Lotus] unexpectedly stirred, its leaves curling to draw the [Nectar] in. The droplet settled on a leaf like a glistening pearl.  

Han Yue was astonished—the [Heavenly Origin Imperial Lotus] could absorb [Nectar]! He sensed that the lotus's energy production had slightly increased, albeit by an almost imperceptible margin. But since his [Nectar] supply was limitless, over time, the lotus would undoubtedly grow significantly stronger.  

---  

A beneficial synergy had formed between the [Heavenly Origin Imperial Lotus] and [Nectar]. Han Yue envisioned his path to the Dao like a mountain, where [Nectar] was a small stone tumbling down from the peak, gathering snow into a growing snowball.  

The lotus generated primal energy, converting it into [Nectar], which in turn nourished the lotus. The result? An ever-increasing supply of [Nectar] and an ever-strengthening lotus.  

Soon, Han Yue produced another drop of [Nectar]. This time, the lotus did not intervene—the previous drop was still being absorbed. Now, Han Yue had a drop entirely at his disposal.  

He guided it to his fingertip, where a crystalline bead of dew emerged, hovering above his finger. A refreshing vitality radiated from it, invigorating the senses.  

Han Yue examined its properties and found that even outside his body, [Nectar] could persist indefinitely. With a flick of his finger, he sent the droplet toward Xiao Liu, who eagerly swallowed it.  

The [Nectar] dissolved instantly, transforming into a surge of life energy that spread through Xiao Liu's body, mending hidden injuries and refining his physique. Even outside Han Yue's body, its potency remained undiminished.  

This discovery vastly expanded [Nectar]'s potential applications. Han Yue now possessed a self-sustaining, premium-grade elixir—a thrilling realization.  

However, [Nectar] came with a minor side effect: its rich life energy was irresistibly alluring to all living beings. To others, Han Yue exuding this energy would seem like a delectable feast.  

If some female demon were to abduct him as a living elixir dispenser... that would be an unfortunate fate.  

To mitigate this, Han Yue confined [Nectar] within his dantian, masking it with thunder-nurturing runes. While he still carried a faint, sweet fragrance, it was far less conspicuous than pure [Nectar].  

From now on, he resolved to tread carefully. He would scrutinize any unexpected kindness and, if necessary, flee without hesitation.  

Though [Nectar] was the lowest-tier ability Han Yue had acquired, its value was no less than his other divine powers.

Just then, Xiao Liu finished absorbing the [Nectar] and exclaimed excitedly, "Brother Dao! This elixir is incredible! Not only did it heal all my accumulated injuries, but it also refined my body, saving me a month of hard training! What's it called? When I'm rich, I'll buy loads of it and drink it like water!"  

Han Yue chuckled. "Xiao Liu, you sure know how to exaggerate. This [Nectar] isn’t something money can easily buy."  

At that moment, a tall figure entered the cave—Fang Yi, returning from outside. Seeing Han Yue awake, her face lit up with joy.  

Before she could speak, Han Yue flicked a drop of [Nectar] toward her. Sensing its energy, Fang Yi instinctively swallowed it, her eyes widening as she immediately sat down to meditate.  

Han Yue smirked—[Nectar]'s allure was truly irresistible.  

Soon, Fang Yi finished absorbing the droplet, her body revitalized and enhanced just like Xiao Liu's.  

"Han Yue, with such a treasure, I won’t need to search for other remedies," she said. "I just returned from Fenrou Market—it’s safe now. The Qinglian Sword Sect has arrived and is gathering survivors to clear the ruins."  

"If you’re recovered, let’s head there together. For now, we have nowhere else to go. Our next steps depend on the Qinglian Sword Sect’s arrangements."
