**The Precious Pig in My Palm**

“Chonghe, why don’t you come back with me? There might still be a turning point in this matter,” Cui Hong said.

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming immediately retreated several steps. The dark wasteland seemed to swallow him, obscuring even his outline.

How could he possibly go to the Cui family? The two years after his memories faded had allowed him to discard all his previous thoughts and re-examine the past. Now, his perspective and judgment were entirely different from before.

It was as if he had leaped out of his original life trajectory, breaking free from a turbulent and dangerous river that had swept him forward. Now he had a brand new beginning, and he would never step back into it.

Retreating again and again in the wasteland, this was Qin Ming’s instinctive reaction. He absolutely could not fall back into the muddy swamp of the Cui family, or he would truly be in peril.

“Chonghe, why are you reacting and looking like this?” Cui Hong sighed, seeing him as if facing a formidable enemy, constantly retreating.

It was obvious that Cui Chonghe, standing before him, regarded the Cui family as a monstrous flood beast, something he wanted no part of, no contact with. He had already declared that he would only live for himself.

“Are you trying to force me?” Qin Ming asked, drawing his mutton-fat jade iron blade. “Even if I’m not your match, I won’t just stand here and wait for death.”

“Hmm?” Cui Hong was surprised, because the blade stance Qin Ming adopted exuded the aura of a grandmaster of the blade, quite extraordinary.

He even had an illusion that, regardless of the youth’s true strength, he vaguely possessed the demeanor of a blade grandmaster!

“Oh?” On the rugged mountain path, Meng Xinghai, shrouded in mist, revealed a look of surprise. Looking ahead, it was just a sixteen or seventeen-year-old boy. How could he possess such an aura in the domain of the blade?

Cui Hong did not unleash his Heavenly Light. He merely extended his long arm, casually striking forward. He wanted to see if Qin Ming truly had some achievements in the domain of the blade.

The mutton-fat jade iron blade, coated with mineral pigments and slightly shorter than his arm including the hilt, traced a blade light in Qin Ming’s hand accompanied by the sound of wind and thunder, like a blinding lightning bolt suddenly tearing through the night sky as a dark, rainy night descended.

*Chila!* A section of Cui Hong’s robe was cut off, fluttering down onto the yellow sand, leaving him somewhat stunned.

Although he had restrained his Heavenly Light, extended his hand casually, and suppressed his own power, fearing to injure the young master before him, the other party should by no means have been able to cut him.

What level of person was he? To have a corner of his sleeve cut off by a youth who had only recently stepped into the Newborn Realm—if word got out, no one would believe it.

Cui Hong looked with a complex expression at the slender figure completely hidden in the darkness ahead.

In the distance, Meng Xinghai also showed a look of surprise, muttering, “The people of the Cui family are truly extraordinary. I thought I was mistaken, but I didn’t expect that, purely in terms of blade technique, this youth can indeed be called a master. His comprehension of the Blade Dao is extremely profound!”

Li Qingyue was astonished. She knew very well that Meng Xinghai himself used a blade as his weapon, so to receive such an evaluation from him meant he was truly outstanding.

She recalled that night when Qin Ming single-handedly flattened Golden Rooster Ridge, killing two Fourth Newborn Realm bandits. Afterwards, an old patrolman analyzed the scene, saying that at least three people were involved, each skilled in using a blade, a spear, and an arrow.

Li Qingyue realized that the word “skilled” was an understatement to describe Qin Ming’s mastery in the Blade Dao.

“Chonghe, you’ve greatly surprised me. Come back with me and give it a try,” Cui Hong said.

“Give it a try?” Qin Ming would absolutely not entrust his fate to the “goodwill” of others now. The people in the Cui family could end his path to new life with a single thought. Why would he risk it?

He spoke, “You’ve already acknowledged that even if I cultivate the method in the silk scripture, it would be useless, let alone this small achievement in the Blade Dao. I won’t go with you.”

Cui Hong said no more. He intended to take Qin Ming first. Staying in this dark wasteland made him feel uneasy; he didn’t want to violate any taboos or attract any “legends.”

“Stop!” Meng Xinghai cried out, his figure flashing as he appeared in the wasteland, intending to block him.

Li Qingyue also appeared nearby, stepping on the yellow sand like a celestial maiden on rippling waves.

Cui Hong had already sensed them and, not wanting any complications, swiftly reached out to grab Qin Ming.

As Meng Xinghai moved to intercept, he suddenly withdrew his hand, revealing a strange expression, and retreated several steps.

“Aren’t you supposed to repay my kindness? I’m about to be crippled, and you’re not going to help me?” Qin Ming quickly whispered in the dark wasteland.

*Bang!*

Cui Hong felt an intense pain in his right hand, as if he had been kicked by a savage dragon. His footing became unstable, and he slid back more than ten meters through the yellow sand.

“Hiss!” He gasped, inhaling a cold breath mixed with dust. His right hand was numb with pain. This feeling was very much like the time he was kicked by a donkey when he was a child.

He lowered his head to look at his right hand. With his powerful perception, he could see things at close range even in the wasteland. His right hand looked as if it had been stamped, turning so red it was almost bleeding.

Cui Hong looked closely and found that it was actually a hoof print.

“This hand is really hard.” A grunting sound came from the darkness, followed by the creature speaking again: “How do you humans describe this situation? Something about a stone in an outhouse, right?”

Qin Ming remained silent, offering no comment.

After all, Cui Hong had saved his life once, regardless of whether it was part of his duty.

Cui Hong stared into the darkness, seeing a mini wild boar, slightly longer than a palm, resting on Qin Ming’s right hand. He had clearly been kicked by a pig!

Li Qingyue gazed at the small mountain pig with special pupil techniques, feeling it was extremely dangerous, as if a colossal beast was lurking in the night mist.

“The Mountain Lord of Black-White Mountain?” Meng Xinghai asked.

Cui Hong’s expression changed abruptly. It was actually that Mountain Lord! He had come here with a request, and now it had transformed into a precious pig in the palm, appearing here.

The mountain pig spoke, “Alas, what a shame! I’m already the former Mountain Lord. You must have met the new Mountain Lord, right? He’s unfathomable, isn’t he? He’s already taken my place, just without making a fuss or publicizing it.”

Qin Ming’s reason for standing here and conversing with Cui Hong naturally came with some confidence.

Last night, although this mountain pig’s snores were deafening, it had also spoken to him: “Since we’ve met by chance, I’ll repay the kindness along the way and settle a karma from the great mountains.”

To this day, Qin Ming didn’t know what kindness it was repaying, but since the other party could change its size and speak human language, it must be very powerful.

If it weren’t for this mountain pig, he would have had to fight with all his might, resorting to extremely drastic measures and “offending” this terrifying wasteland.

“Mountain Lord, are you going to interfere with my Cui family’s affairs?” Cui Hong asked.

The old mountain pig said, “How dare I? A thousand-year aristocratic family, renowned throughout the vast, boundless dark world, deterring all beings. How could I overestimate myself? It’s just that I promised to ensure his passage through this section of the road.”

Cui Hong’s expression fluctuated between light and shadow. He knew he was no match. Moreover, old mountain lords who had lost their territory were the most difficult to deal with. If he truly showed no respect and angered it, it could do anything. After all, it no longer had a territory, and afterwards, it could simply disappear into the depths of the dark earth, making it hard to pursue.

He nodded and said, “Alright, since the Mountain Lord has spoken, then let’s wait until we pass this section of the road.”

Meng Xinghai said, “Brother Cui of the Cui family, how should I address you? Such a prodigy of the Blade Dao, and you’re willing to cripple him? If you don’t want him, name your conditions. How about I take him away?”

Soon, Cui Hong knew the other party’s identity, no wonder he had the confidence to speak like that, because he also came from a thousand-year aristocratic family.

Furthermore, Cui Hong recognized the young woman opposite him, Li Qingyue.

He remembered clearly that years ago, when some top aristocratic families’ descendants waited in a giant city for outsiders to choose disciples, this Li Qingyue was eventually taken away by a very famous figure.

Meng Xinghai showed a strange expression. At this moment, he already knew who Qin Ming was. He had heard bits and pieces about the turmoil two years ago, and now he was actually meeting this Cui Chonghe.

“I’ve heard snippets. If your Cui family suppresses him in this remote place, if word gets out, you might get a reputation for being callous and ungrateful, which wouldn’t be good,” Meng Xinghai said.

At the same time, he pointed at Li Qingyue and said, “Your Cui family surely can’t silence both me and her, can you? After all, we’ve both seen it.”

Cui Hong’s expression changed. A thousand-year aristocratic family engaging in bloody conflict, even warfare—what was he thinking? That would cause big problems.

In Qin Ming’s fragmented memories, scattered and broken threads were now connecting. He quickly said, “From now on, even if I die, I will never again claim to be a member of the Cui family, nor will I enter your circle. From now on, I am only Qin Ming.”

Two years ago, he couldn’t understand or see through certain things, but now he was different. Even if he only caught tiny clues, he had become aware.

Now, what Qin Ming most wanted to do was to reach the Fourth Newborn Realm as soon as possible, see through all the mist, and know his past experiences without having to ask anyone else.

Cui Hong said, “When has the Cui family ever been callous or ungrateful? I have a premonition that in a few years, Young Master will be invited back.”

Qin Ming heard these words and had nothing to say.

Meng Xinghai said, “In that case, you can send a flying beast back to consult your Cui family. It wouldn’t be good if people knew you acted this way; it would harm the reputation of a thousand-year aristocratic family.”

Then, he looked at Qin Ming and said, “I once heard that about two hundred years ago, an incredible prodigy of the Blade Dao appeared in this region. Unfortunately, he didn’t obtain a suitable Newborn Realm cultivation method in his early years, and he wasted half his life. Even with grandmaster-level blade techniques, that senior could not remain in the world for long. I observe in your Blade Dao aura what seems to be a hint of that senior’s Sky-Shattering Blade Intent.”

Qin Ming bowed to him, thanking him for speaking on his behalf, then informed him, “That is my master.”

Instantly, the scene grew quiet.

Meng Xinghai felt that this youth was full of wild tales, a bit unreliable!

According to his understanding, although that Blade Dao Grandmaster had gone into reclusion and disappeared after his vitality withered, he was not expected to live many more years.

Li Qingyue also showed a strange expression, looking at this former friend. How much had he changed in two years?

“Chonghe, don’t speak nonsense,” Cui Hong said.

“Although my master lost an arm back then, after creating his Sky-Shattering Blade Intent, he personally cut down all his opponents, and from then on, he had no more obsessions in his heart. In his later years, he went deep into the mountains and unexpectedly discovered rare spiritual substances, which allowed him to extend his life and embark on the path of new life again. He truly lived until now, though he is indeed in his twilight years once more.”

Qin Ming calmly spoke, revealing some of the real scenes he had seen in the blade manual, reproducing many of the one-armed elder’s words, and even describing his appearance.

The old mountain pig was the first to be stunned, saying, “Is it really that person?!”

Meng Xinghai was also somewhat lost in thought. He remembered some former sages who, if they had no path forward or saw no hope in their later years, would choose to enter deep mountains and vast swamps to seek opportunities. Did this Blade Dao Grandmaster have such a wondrous encounter?

Cui Hong was also startled. If it were true, a Blade Dao Grandmaster over two hundred years old would be truly extraordinary!

Qin Ming didn’t care whether they believed him or not. His current situation was so bad; he might as well bluff as much as he could—what was there to lose?

“How about we just let this matter go for today?” the old mountain pig said. It leaped from Qin Ming’s hand to the ground and called for him to set off together.

Cui Hong watched silently, planning to take the young master once they passed this section of the road.

However, the next moment he was no longer calm; he caught a familiar, pungent, animalistic odor.

Meng Xinghai and Li Qingyue also frowned instantly, held their breath, and then retreated.

In the depths of the darkness, Qin Ming witnessed with his own eyes the precious pig in his palm, after reaching the ground, urinate a large puddle, turning a patch of yellow sand into a big water pit.

*Boom!*

The entire wasteland erupted again, black mist churning violently.

“Let’s go, what are you still gawking at? I’ll see you out.” The old mountain pig looked back, nudging Qin Ming with its snout, gesturing for him to follow.
