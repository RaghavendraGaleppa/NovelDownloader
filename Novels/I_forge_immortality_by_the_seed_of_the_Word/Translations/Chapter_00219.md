# Chapter 217: Meeting Master Again

Time flowed by leisurely.

In the high-level void.

As a place infinitely close to the core of the Crimson Bright Great Clarity Cave Heaven, a massive amount of immortal spiritual energy surged forth every moment, gathering here before gradually diffusing outwards.

Moreover, various profound Dao principles occasionally manifested, dazzling the eyes and making complete comprehension impossible.

Nine vast immortal islands continuously floated and sank amidst this, absorbing endless immortal opportunities, their immortal light dazzling beyond measure.

At this moment, within one of these immortal islands, a clearly more recently formed one:

"Senior Brother Zhang Jing, this junior will take his leave now."

A low, slightly reserved male voice suddenly emanated from within a palace.

Not long after, the palace doors slowly opened, and two figures emerged. The one leading the way was none other than Zhang Jing, his aura as profound as a deep ocean, making it impossible to discern his true depth. The man following him was clearly enveloped by a powerful aura unique to the Dharma Idol Realm.

A moment later, Zhang Jing stopped, watching the departing man with a gentle smile. "Take care, Junior Brother. I won't see you out."

He was meeting this person for the first time. However, in recent times, a continuous stream of disciples from the Nine Domains lineage, similar to this junior brother, had come to visit his immortal island. Many of them were Dharma Idol Realm cultivators, so Zhang Jing had grown accustomed to it.

Across from him, the man couldn't help but glance at Zhang Jing's calm expression, a faint shock uncontrollably flashing through his eyes. Although it had been a while since he learned of Zhang Jing becoming a True Disciple, and he was mentally prepared, standing before the man now, surging waves of astonishment still rose uncontrollably in his heart.

So young! Barely fifty years old, yet he had already become a True Disciple of the Daoist Sect, and was even exceptionally taken as a formal personal disciple by True Monarch Yuanming, the Master of the Cave Heaven, while still in the Foundation Establishment Realm.

One must know that becoming a True Disciple was already an unattainable dream for them, let alone a True Monarch's personal disciple?!

"Just how terrifying is this person's talent?" the man thought secretly.

Moreover, he could clearly sense that although Senior Brother Zhang Jing's cultivation was only at the Golden Core Realm, there was a faint yet powerful and sacred aura emanating from within his body. Even he, a Dharma Idol Realm cultivator, couldn't help but feel a sense of threat.

More importantly... that sacred and dignified aura was still slowly growing, as if without end.

At this moment, he couldn't help but suspect that perhaps he was cultivating a fake cultivation method. How else could he explain feeling threatened by a Golden Core Realm cultivator as a dignified Dharma Idol Realm cultivator?! This was completely illogical. It seemed the insurmountable chasm between the Dharma Idol Realm and the Golden Core Realm simply didn't exist for Senior Brother Zhang Jing.

"Hmph—, as expected of someone who could become a True Disciple of the Daoist Sect while in the Foundation Establishment Realm. After entering the Golden Core Realm, he has become even more terrifying."

Exhaling lightly, the man snapped back to his senses, a hint of reverence unconsciously appearing in his complex gaze.

"Senior Brother, you are too kind. Please stay. This junior will visit again another day."

With that, the man transformed into a streak of light, and after flying out of the immortal island's bounds, instantly turned and swept downwards. In just a blink, the light disappeared from Zhang Jing's sight.

*Thump-thump—*

A faint sound of footsteps echoed.

"Thirty-Eight, including today's junior brother's gift, how many Immortal Root Seeds do we have now?" Zhang Jing asked without turning his head, a faint smile on his face.

As his voice fell, Lu Sanshiba's voice, trembling with excitement, came from behind him. "Reporting, Master, in total, we've received ninety-seven Immortal Root Seeds during this period, covering various types such as cultivation, immortal materials, Dao comprehension, and longevity. Among them, there are five top-tier Immortal Roots, twenty-seven high-tier Immortal Roots, and sixty-five mid to low-tier Immortal Roots."

Zhang Jing nodded, then instructed, "I understand, Thirty-Eight. For now, don't touch these Immortal Root Seeds. When Master returns to the Cave Heaven, I will request to establish a Daoist cultivation ground. These Immortal Roots can then be planted there."

"Understood, Master," Lu Sanshiba nodded vigorously.

Just as the master and his mount were speaking, two more streaks of light flashed from below, then gently landed outside Zhang Jing's immortal island.

"Junior Brother Jun Shanqi respectfully apologizes to Senior Brother regarding the Immortal Welcome Banquet matter. I hope Senior Brother, with your magnanimity, will not hold this junior's impolite actions against him."

"Junior Brother Qing Fang is here today to apologize to Senior Brother for my previous rash actions."

On the spot, Zhang Jing's eyes flashed. "It's them?"

...

Not long after, "Take care, Junior Brothers. Do come often if you have time." Zhang Jing said with a beaming smile, his cordial voice instantly echoing throughout the entire immortal island.

Upon hearing his words, the two streaks of light that had flown out not far suddenly paused, then abruptly accelerated, as if a bone-gnawing demon's den was behind them.

Witnessing this, an inscrutable expression appeared on Zhang Jing's face. It was nothing more than expending a trivial amount of fortune. If he hadn't considered the Heavenly Immortal True Monarch ancestor behind them, how could this matter have ended so simply?

"It's still about cultivation!" Zhang Jing sighed in his heart.

...

Below, on a certain immortal island:

"Senior Brother Jun, although Zhang Jing is a True Monarch's official personal disciple, you are not inferior! Why would you willingly offer yourself up to be slaughtered by him?" Qing Fang asked, his face aching with regret, his voice full of unwillingness. "We lost big this time."

Hearing this, Senior Brother Jun turned his head and said helplessly, "You don't understand. That Zhang Jing isn't just backed by Master True Monarch Yuanming."

"The legendary Revered Lord of Seven Desires is also his master. That is a notorious Immortal Golden Immortal Dao Lord. My clan's ancestor cannot afford to provoke him!"

"What?!" Qing Fang cried out in shock. His eyes widened instantly, and his pupils uncontrollably constricted slightly.

...

Three months later.

Inside the cultivation chamber.

A faint, ethereal pull and call suddenly appeared in Zhang Jing's mind. He quietly opened his eyes, a thoughtful expression flashing across his face. This feeling—Master! Had he finally returned to the Cave Heaven and remembered to see him?

The next moment, without a moment's delay, a streak of light ignited, instantly flying out of the palace. Then, guided by that faint, ethereal pull, it swiftly ascended directly upwards.

In the blink of an eye, Zhang Jing arrived in a deep, secluded void. A mighty void storm seemed to eternally lash against a bronze Daoist palace covered in the marks of time and decay directly ahead. In his perception, every wisp of this storm contained an unimaginably terrifying void power. Should it leak out into the external world, it would instantly unleash boundless catastrophe.

"How do I enter that bronze palace?" Zhang Jing stared unblinkingly at the boundless, raging void storm, a dilemma in his heart. He knew his Master was in the bronze palace about a hundred *zhang* away. Yet, this short distance seemed to become an uncrossable chasm between Zhang Jing and the bronze palace.

After a moment's thought, "Is this a small test?" Zhang Jing suddenly looked up, a hint of a smile flashing in his eyes.

In an instant, from the center of his brows, a Golden Core, appearing like a scorching sun, its exact form unclear, suddenly leaped out. A heavy, vast aura instantly pressed down in all directions. Simultaneously, innate primordial immortal light, one strand after another, burst forth from the Golden Core, with the four colors of earth, fire, wind, and water immortal light swirling indeterminately.

*Thump—*

Zhang Jing took firm steps, inching towards the bronze palace. Wherever he passed, even a force as strong as the void storm was directly suppressed by Zhang Jing's formidable Golden Core, which had already transcended a barrier of the Primordial Origin Realm's derived worlds. It had no power to resist whatsoever.

...

Not long after, within the bronze palace.

"Zhang Jing respectfully greets Master!" Zhang Jing bowed deeply forward, calling out respectfully.

Above the main hall, True Monarch Yuanming, whose form seemed to overlap and flicker with countless silhouettes, showed an expression of extreme satisfaction in his profound eyes.

The next moment, "Rise. There is no need for such formalities with me, your master," a gentle voice softly resonated beside Zhang Jing's ear.
