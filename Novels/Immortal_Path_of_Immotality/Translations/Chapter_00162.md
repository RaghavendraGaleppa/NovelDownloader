# Chapter 161: Strengthening the Void Star Compass

Ten years passed in the blink of an eye.

Lin Shan felt the abundant spiritual energy within his body. Having reached the peak of the early Foundation Establishment stage with no further progress possible, he knew continued cultivation would be futile. Only by breaking through the Xuan Guan acupoint could he advance to the next stage.

With a flip of his hand, he produced the Purple Heart Pill. The enhancement panel instantly appeared before his eyes.

[Purple Heart Pill]  
Quality: Dharma Pill  
Description: Assists in breaking through bottlenecks at the Foundation Establishment stage (early and mid-stage), increasing breakthrough probability by 20%.  
Enhancement Cost: 32 points  

"Twenty percent..."  

Lin Shan gazed at the purple pill in his hand, recalling the Foundation Establishment cultivation manual "Wind Thunder Technique" he was practicing. This dual-element wind and thunder technique, created a thousand years ago by Ouyang Feng, a former disciple of the Zixiao Sect, provided detailed explanations of the Foundation Establishment cultivation process.

Breaking through bottlenecks in the early and mid-stages of Foundation Establishment required not only immense external force to overcome barriers but also the further harmonization of qi and spirit. Ultimately, spirit and qi would merge, refining the body like jade liquid and forging an immaculate form in preparation for condensing a flawless Golden Core in the future.

If the harmonization of qi and spirit was interrupted during a breakthrough attempt, the attempt would fail, resulting in a regression in cultivation. More critically, it would leave behind Dao marks, not only increasing the difficulty of future breakthroughs but also potentially leading to qi deviation.

"The Purple Heart Pill significantly aids the harmonization of qi and spirit and contains vast spiritual energy. However, a twenty percent increase is still insufficient, and the risk of failure remains too high. This is unacceptable!"

Since entering the cultivation world, Lin Shan had always advanced courageously and diligently, never experiencing cultivation regression from a failed breakthrough. Yet, in the cultivation world, breakthrough failures were common, and many cultivators had to start over. No one could claim to be consistently lucky, only learning from each attempt before trying again.

"Lifespan is determined by heaven, and wasted time cannot be reclaimed. A failed breakthrough not only squanders resources but also requires waiting countless years to try again."

"I've accumulated ancient charms for so long—it's time to put them to good use."

"Enhance!"

In the cave abode, the purple, longan-sized pill flashed with light. Amid swirling purple mist, it instantly transformed into a fist-sized, purplish-black pill.

Lin Shan's hand suddenly felt heavy—the enhanced pill now weighed over a hundred pounds. Thick, fragrant purple mist filled the chamber, some even seeping through the door into the courtyard outside.

Black Skeleton Demon Monarch, who had been left outside to roam freely for the past decade, abruptly opened his eyes while meditating in the courtyard. He glanced suspiciously toward the chamber.

"What is that kid up to in there? That seems like the fragrance of a newly refined pill... Is he a pill-refining master?"

---

Inside the chamber, Lin Shan sat upright as the panel before him transformed, revealing new information.

[Purple Dust Pill]  
Quality: Treasure Pill  
Description: Assists in breaking through bottlenecks at the Foundation Establishment stage (early and mid-stage), increasing breakthrough success rate by 90%. Also provides minor benefits to Golden Core cultivation.  
Enhancement Cost: 64 points  

"Ninety percent! Combined with my original one percent chance, doesn't that make it 99.9 percent?"

"It's practically a guaranteed success, as long as I don't do anything reckless."

"This is a Treasure Pill! Comparable to a magic treasure, leagues beyond Dharma Pills."

Lin Shan eagerly held the fist-sized purplish-black pill, sensing the spiritual energy within—ten times denser than the original Purple Heart Pill—and inhaling its intoxicating fragrance.

His mind, however, was preoccupied with a practical concern: his mouth wasn't that big. Should he force himself to swallow it whole or take bites?

But when he placed the pill to his lips, he realized his worries were unfounded—the pill melted instantly upon contact. Before he could even taste it, it transformed into a torrent of heat that surged into the Xuan Guan acupoint in his dantian.

To his astonishment, the bottleneck of early Foundation Establishment shattered instantly under the impact.

The vast purple current rushed forth, expanding his dantian space while simultaneously raising his spiritual energy concentration. Wisps of purple auspicious clouds assisted in harmonizing his qi and spirit.

In less than half an hour, crackling electricity enveloped Lin Shan's body as the wind-thunder vortex in his dantian expanded several times over. His spiritual energy surged more than tenfold. The potency of the Treasure Pill made breaking through a mere Foundation Establishment barrier effortless—like crushing an ant with a mountain.

The remaining medicinal energy not only ensured his breakthrough but also filled a significant portion of his newly expanded dantian space.

His cultivation had now soared to one-third of mid-Foundation Establishment, making him seem not like a newcomer but someone who had cultivated for years. However, the forcibly infused energy felt unstable, requiring further compression and refinement to fully integrate.

"Incredible! *Burp*—"

Lin Shan marveled at the pill's potency while involuntarily releasing a belch, expelling a ring of undigested purple mist.

After consolidating his new realm and compressing his spiritual energy to one-fourth of mid-Foundation Establishment, Lin Shan didn't rush to leave seclusion.

He still had 96 ancient charm points remaining. After setting aside 32 for future bottlenecks, he had 64 points to enhance his other capabilities.

His options were twofold: split the points for two enhancements (yielding minor divine abilities or magic treasures) or go all-in with 64 points to enhance a single spirit treasure.

After careful consideration, Lin Shan leaned toward the latter. Compared to magic treasures he couldn't fully utilize, he was more intrigued by spirit treasures.

His current magic treasures—Severing Water Sword and Void Star Compass—were limited in use: one served as a melee weapon, the other as a compass. The former could catch opponents off guard but became less effective once they adapted, while the latter had even fewer applications. It was frustrating to possess such treasures yet be unable to unlock their full potential.

"Minor divine abilities can wait. I already have two magic treasures—adding another unusable one would only be frustrating. Why not go all out for a spirit treasure? Fortune favors the bold!"

Lin Shan steeled his resolve. With so many ancient charms at his disposal, there was no point hoarding them. Now was the time to acquire a spirit treasure—something even Nascent Soul cultivators might not possess.

If the legends about spirit treasures he'd heard from Luan Chun held any truth, he might finally overcome the limitations of magic treasures.

After deliberation, he retrieved the silver compass.

The Severing Water Sword, at least, had the advantages of sharpness and durability. Even without channeling magic power, it could serve as a melee weapon, and Lin Shan had some martial arts training. In contrast, the Void Star Compass was in greater need of enhancement.

"Don't let me down..."

With a mental command to "enhance," Lin Shan felt the compass tremble in his hand. Through his rudimentary spiritual sense, he detected a monumental transformation within.

The materials of the compass were entirely upgraded, its thirty-six magic restrictions reorganized. It realigned with the celestial stars of the Northern Dipper and connected with terrestrial mountain ranges and sea veins. Its tracking and locking capabilities evolved, and its ability to analyze and decipher formations and restrictions advanced.

In an instant, he sensed the birth of a nascent spiritual awareness within the treasure—a consciousness that progressed from confusion to curiosity, then to an affectionate attachment to him, its master. A soul-deep bond formed.

"Whoosh—"

Before Lin Shan could examine the enhanced spirit treasure's new features, he noticed a five- or six-year-old girl clinging to him, her large, timid eyes gazing up at him.
