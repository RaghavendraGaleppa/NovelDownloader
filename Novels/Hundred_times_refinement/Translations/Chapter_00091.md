# Chapter 41: The Cultivation Clan  

Using his waist token to dispel the restriction and returning to his room, Lin Xuan's expression immediately darkened. He stood silently by the bed, lost in thought. Initially, he had only intended to pass the time at the tavern and perhaps gather some useful information, but he hadn't expected to stumble upon such significant news.  

When he first learned from the jade slip that four intermediate-level cultivation techniques would be sold at the afternoon trading session, Lin Xuan had been quite pleased. His goal was merely the Spirit Control Technique included in one of these manuals. The quality of the technique itself didn't matter much to him—after all, intermediate-level techniques were only used at the Foundation Establishment stage, which was still far off for him.  

His plan was simple: learn the Spirit Control Technique now and worry about the intermediate-level technique for Foundation Establishment later. With this mindset, he believed acquiring one of the four techniques shouldn’t be a problem.  

But now...  

According to the old man he had overheard, three of the four intermediate-level techniques had already been reserved by cultivation clans in advance, leaving him with only one option. Unlike the low-level techniques used by Qi Refinement cultivators, intermediate-level techniques rarely appeared on the market and were highly sought after. There were more than three cultivation clans attending this gathering, and other clans—even rogue cultivators—might also be eyeing the last remaining technique, making it much harder for him to acquire.  

In terms of pill reserves, Lin Xuan was confident he could match anyone. But doing so would come with risks...  

After a long silence, Lin Xuan gritted his teeth and made his decision. No matter what, he wouldn’t back down—he *had* to obtain an intermediate-level technique.  

Though Lin Xuan was usually cautious and preferred to plan carefully before acting, that didn’t mean he was timid. His caution stemmed from a desire to avoid unnecessary trouble. But when circumstances demanded action, he wouldn’t hesitate. A true man knew when to stand firm and when to let go. Fear and indecision would only hinder his path to greatness.  

Since he was determined to secure the intermediate-level technique, there was no need to hold back.  

With this resolve, Lin Xuan sat cross-legged, first restoring his stamina and spiritual power to their peak condition. If a conflict arose over the technique, being at his best would increase his chances of success.  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan opened his eyes and left his room for the plaza. Nearly a hundred cultivators had already gathered, eager to secure their desired treasures before others could snatch them away. Most were from cultivation clans, with only a handful of rogue cultivators among them.  

Lin Xuan secured a spot near the front and quietly observed the crowd. Unfortunately, no one seemed inclined to chat, so he couldn’t glean any useful information.  

---  

After a while, a cultivator dressed in the attire of the Lingyun Sect stepped forward and clasped his hands in greeting. "Fellow Daoists, welcome. The afternoon trading session will now begin..."  

But the cultivators, eager to acquire their treasures, had no patience for formalities. As soon as the plaza’s entrance restriction lifted, they surged inside.  

Lin Xuan wasted no time. Following the directions from the jade slip, he headed straight for the southern section where the intermediate-level techniques were being sold.  

"How much for *The Iceheart Mantra*?" Seeing the jade slip still on the stall, Lin Xuan inwardly sighed in relief—he wasn’t too late. Outwardly, however, he remained composed.  

The stall attendant, a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, gave Lin Xuan a curious look. After all, intermediate-level techniques were typically used by Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Lin Xuan had no intention of explaining himself. He tilted his chin slightly and repeated, "How much?"  

His aloof, slightly arrogant demeanor made the attendant hesitate. Though Lin Xuan appeared to be a rogue cultivator, his bearing was extraordinary—perhaps he had a powerful master backing him.  

Considering that he was interested in an intermediate-level technique, the attendant’s attitude softened. "One hundred and fifty low-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills," he said with a polite smile.  

Lin Xuan suppressed a smirk. This was exactly the reaction he wanted. Since the last remaining technique was likely to attract competition, acting humble would only invite trouble. Instead, projecting arrogance made others wary, deterring them from scheming against him.  

To his relief, no other buyers had shown up yet—his early arrival had paid off.  

Just as Lin Xuan reached into his robe to retrieve the pills, a mocking voice rang out from behind:  

"One hundred and fifty low-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills? I’ll take *The Iceheart Mantra*."  

Lin Xuan’s heart sank. Despite his efforts, trouble had still found him. He turned slowly to see a young man in lavish robes, around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, with the bearing of a noble scion—clearly a member of a cultivation clan.  

*Thud! Thud!*  

Two jade bottles landed on the stall, and the young man reached for the jade slip.  

"Hold it," Lin Xuan blocked his path.  

"What?" The young noble sneered, eyeing Lin Xuan’s rogue cultivator attire with disdain.  

"Do you not understand the principle of first come, first served?" Lin Xuan had no patience for pleasantries—it was clear this confrontation would escalate.  

"First come, first served?" The young man laughed derisively. "A rogue cultivator like you can afford an intermediate-level technique? Even if you could, do you dare compete with the Yan Clan?"  

*The Yan Clan*—a mid-sized cultivation family with only a dozen or so cultivators, but their patriarch was a peak Qi Refinement expert, just a step away from Foundation Establishment.  

Lin Xuan recalled the information but didn’t waste words. Instead, he took out his own pills.  

"One hundred and sixty Marrow-Cleansing Pills. I’ll take it."  

He offered more because, at equal prices, the stall owner would undoubtedly favor the cultivation clan over a rogue cultivator—unless Lin Xuan revealed his identity as a disciple of the Drifting Cloud Valley, which was out of the question.
