Chapter 35: Senior Brother Zhao and I are Destined!

In the previous-previous life, approximately twenty years from Lu Yang's current point in time, the Saint Sect would launch a sect-destroying war against a righteous sect. That righteous sect, which was destroyed, was called the "Divine Martial Sect."

In that same previous-previous life, Zhao Xuhe eventually cultivated to the Grand Perfection of Qi Condensation and, together with Fairy Feixia, became an overseer of the Saint Sect's external market city. That market city was located on Skull Mountain, bordering the Divine Martial Sect.

Before the war, the Saint Sect transported large quantities of supplies, using the market city as a cover. It was said that during this period, the two of them discovered a wondrous item for Foundation Establishment. Afterwards, as the war began, both distinguished themselves, accumulating considerable merit. They then exchanged for another Foundation Establishment wondrous item from within the Saint Sect and invited an alchemist to combine the two wondrous items into a single "Foundation Establishment Pill," thus gaining the opportunity to attempt Foundation Establishment.

Although they ultimately failed, the fortuitous opportunity was real. "I, like Zhao Xuhe, cultivate the Nine Transformations Dragon Art. If he could attempt Foundation Establishment, then perhaps I also have a chance. In any case, it's worth a try!"

Three more days passed. Lu Yang was meditating in his cave abode when, suddenly, a human-faced owl flew to its entrance. Its lips parted, emitting a clear and pleasant voice: "Junior Brother Lu, please come to my cave abode for a meeting." It was Fairy Feixia. Seeing this, Lu Yang's eyes flickered slightly. He immediately soared on a sword light towards Fairy Feixia's cave abode and was subsequently guided to a tea pavilion amidst mountains and waters.

Inside the tea pavilion, Fairy Feixia was brewing tea. Her delicate hands moved gracefully, pouring spirit water, igniting true fire, moistening the tea leaves, and steeping the brew. Her movements were a joy to behold. Lu Yang, witnessing this, felt an ethereal tea fragrance waft towards him, invigorating his spirit and even enlivening his spiritual sense. "Junior Brother, please be seated." Fairy Feixia finally raised her brows to look at him. Once Lu Yang was seated, she directly got to the point: "The reason I sought you out this time, Junior Brother, is that the society's reply has arrived."

"Oh?" Lu Yang intentionally showed excitement: "Has my divine ability arrived?" "Indeed." Fairy Feixia smiled faintly: "Second Senior Brother has already sent the list of divine abilities. Junior Brother can now choose any one to cultivate from the list." "Thank you, Senior Sister!" Lu Yang cupped his hands, took the jade slip containing the list, and opened it. He was immediately dazzled by the dense array of divine abilities, and upon careful perusal, he cursed inwardly.

Because most of these divine abilities were ones he had seen in the Mending Heaven Peak's scripture pavilion. However, those in the scripture pavilion were truncated versions, their power far inferior to the complete versions on this list. While seemingly similar, the two were as different as heaven and earth, revealing the extent of the Saint Sect's control over resources. It was simply outrageous. If he hadn't joined the Three Rivers Society and signed a servitude contract, gaining a True Inheritance background, he might never have come into contact with these complete divine abilities in his entire life.

A moment later, Lu Yang's eyes suddenly lit up. He actually saw a familiar phrase on the list: Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light—or, more precisely, the complete version of the Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light! It was the 《Grand Yin Corpse Severance Transformation True Art》!

"The Grand Yin refines the body, surpassing the nine-revolutions elixir, form dignified and solemn, face like spirit clouds, ascending to the Grand Ultimate Palace, receiving records as a True Immortal."

This was a great divine ability! The Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light was merely its first step. Once fully mastered, one would be beyond the five elements, impervious to blades and weapons, and even be known as a "Corpse Severance Immortal."

"This is it!" Lu Yang immediately decided, copied the contents of the 《Grand Yin Corpse Severance Transformation True Art》, then turned to Fairy Feixia and solemnly cupped his hands: "Now that this matter is settled, Senior Sister, do you have any other important matters to instruct?"

"To be frank, Junior Brother." Fairy Feixia chuckled softly: "I recently plan to request an external transfer to take charge of the Skull Mountain market city, and I happen to be short of a few satisfactory assistants..." As expected! Lu Yang wasn't surprised by Fairy Feixia's invitation. After all, with a carrot comes a stick; since the Three Rivers Society had given benefits, how could they not expect him to do tasks?

"If Senior Sister doesn't mind, I am willing to accompany you." Lu Yang nodded without hesitation. After all, it concerned a Foundation Establishment opportunity. Even if Fairy Feixia hadn't actively invited him, Lu Yang had already planned to take on a mission from the Merit Hall to go to the Skull Mountain market city.

Seeing Lu Yang's decisiveness, the satisfaction in Fairy Feixia's eyes grew deeper: "Junior Brother truly is as I thought, a person with a firm Dao Heart. If we ordinary disciples indulge ourselves and stay within the Saint Sect, it's destined that we'll never stand out. Only by venturing out to seek opportunities will there be a sliver of hope."

"Only by burning one's bridges and disregarding life and death can there be hope for Foundation Establishment!" After a series of conversations, Lu Yang found that Fairy Feixia's gaze towards him had become much warmer; she clearly regarded him as someone with similar aspirations. Disregarding life and death wasn't wrong, indeed. But it wasn't because he was burning his bridges; it was because he had the [Book of a Hundred Lives]. He wasn't afraid of failure at all. If he died, he died. He could just start over again!

Ten days later, aboard the Sky-soaring Flying Ship bound for Skull Mountain. Lu Yang arrived on a streak of light, steadily landing on the ship's deck. After greeting Fairy Feixia, he discreetly blended into the crowd below. On this trip to Skull Mountain, he didn't intend to be too conspicuous. Rather than being the center of attention, he actually preferred to be unremarkable, ideally the kind who could quietly retreat behind the crowd with a mere frown.

Soon, many cultivators gathered on the flying ship. Besides Fairy Feixia, two other Qi Condensation seventh-layer cultivators were among the leaders. One of them, he even recognized: Lu Yuanchun, a disciple under the Mending Heaven Peak Master. "Hmph, I'll deal with him sooner or later." A cold glint flashed in Lu Yang's eyes, then vanished. He then looked around. Since Lu Yuanchun was here, would Zhao Xuhe also come? This life's Foundation Establishment opportunity might very well fall to him!

Indeed, after Lu Yang scanned the area, he truly found Zhao Xuhe silently drinking spirit wine in a secluded corner of the flying ship, amidst the crowd. However, the current Zhao Xuhe was several times more dejected than in previous lives. Lu Yang wasn't surprised; after all, in this life, Zhao Xuhe couldn't find him, his fated opportunity vanished, his speculation on Substitute Death Yin Puppets led to him losing everything, and his mistress, Fairy Qingchen, had surely left him. He had lost both wealth and companion.

That he hadn't jumped off Mending Heaven Peak yet, Lu Yang already found quite admirable. "Senior Brother Zhao? Is that Senior Brother Zhao?" Lu Yang proactively stepped forward, intentionally putting on a surprised expression: "I never expected to meet Senior Brother Zhao here! Senior Brother, you and I are truly destined!"

"Huh? You are..." Zhao Xuhe was stunned for a long while before his cultivator's memory finally recognized Lu Yang. He immediately gaped: "...Junior Brother Lu? You're already at mid-stage Qi Condensation?"

Zhao Xuhe was indeed down and out; he couldn't see through Lu Yang's Qi Concealment Art and naturally had no way of knowing his true cultivation realm. Yet, even so, mid-stage Qi Condensation was enough to greatly shock him, as Lu Yang, just ten years prior, had been an insignificant nobody in his eyes. Thinking of this, Zhao Xuhe instantly became even more depressed.

"Heh, are you here to mock me too? Get lost!" "Senior Brother, why do you say that?" Lu Yang feigned confusion, then quickly said: "I have always remembered Senior Brother's past kindness; how could I have any intention of mocking you?"

Kindness? What kindness? Zhao Xuhe was stunned again, then he recalled that he did seem to have helped Lu Yang with a loan back then. Was that considered kindness? Was there really such a fool? Thinking this, Zhao Xuhe was about to open his mouth to sneer... "I see that Senior Brother's cultivation seems to still be stuck at the sixth layer of Qi Condensation. If Senior Brother doesn't mind, I have a spirit pill here that can enhance cultivation."

"Isn't this... inappropriate?" Zhao Xuhe bewilderedly took the spirit pill that Lu Yang practically forced into his hand. For some reason, looking at Lu Yang again, he actually felt a genuine sense of familiarity! It was as if the two of them had interacted in a previous life. Could it be that they truly were destined?
