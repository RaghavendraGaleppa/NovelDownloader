# Chapter 54: Xin Xuan's Severed Head, Two Thousand Merits—Can It Atone for Three Crimes?  

The eastern sun had just risen, casting light across the sky.  

The city was littered with insect corpses—poisonous worms, venomous insects, and even ordinary ants.  

At this moment, the elders of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect stood outside, directing their disciples to assist hundreds of elite soldiers in cleaning up the aftermath.  

Amidst the ruins of what was once a grand platform, four figures now stood facing each other.  

"The Star-Shifting Grand Formation—a secret technique of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect."  

"This formation requires gathering the light of seven nights before it can be activated!"  

"Once used, anything within its range is instantly transported three hundred miles away."  

The young master of the Kunlun Sect spoke coldly, "Lu Huaiyuan, what do you have to say for yourself?"  

Before Lu Huaiyuan could respond, the military general of the Great Zhou Dynasty interjected, "Seven days ago, the Venom King Xin Xuan was still hiding in the capital, yet this formation in Four-Leaf City had already been prepared!"  

The Buddhist disciple from the Vajra Temple clasped his hands and murmured, "It seems that before Xin Xuan plotted against the Crown Prince, someone had already prepared an escape route for him here!"  

Commander Zhou said indifferently, "Judging by the current evidence, it appears this person is from the Yu Hua Immortal Sect!"  

Lu Huaiyuan did not deny it. He replied calmly, "This person should be Elder Zhou Li from our Formation Hall. I should have arrived in Four Leaf City before the three of you, but I was intercepted by him along the way..."  

Commander Zhou frowned. "I've heard of him. His cultivation is mediocre among the True Qi realm, with fewer than two hundred opened acupoints. How could he be a match for you?"  

Lu Huaiyuan shook his head slightly. "He must have been concealing his true strength. His cultivation has reached the peak of the True Qi realm—all three hundred and sixty-five acupoints are fully opened, completing the Great Cycle. Moreover, he is well-versed in our sect's secret techniques, no less skilled than I am. Our battle ended inconclusively. When he sensed changes in Four Leaf City, he withdrew..."  

Rubbing his brow, Lu Huaiyuan added, "I was in a hurry to pursue the Venom King Xin Xuan and did not give chase."  

The Vajra Temple disciple mused, "It seems Elder Zhou Li intercepted you because you arrived too early. He held you back until all of us were lured into Four Leaf City before releasing you."  

The Star-Shifting Grand Formation could transport the Venom King Xin Xuan three hundred miles away, making his direction unpredictable!  

If they had not all gathered, Xin Xuan might have been sent away earlier under Lu Huaiyuan's pressure. If luck was against them, he might have run into one of them!  

"Regardless, you must give us an explanation today!"  

The young master of Kunlun stared directly at Lu Huaiyuan. "We mobilized all our forces to surround and kill him, yet he still escaped, mocking the Central Plains for having no worthy opponents and turning us into a laughingstock! Even if we set that aside, do you not know who stands behind him?"  

Among the four present, one was the young master of Kunlun, another the chief disciple of Yu Hua, the third a Buddhist disciple from the Vajra Temple, and the last a military commander of Great Zhou royal blood.  

They had come not just for the Venom King Xin Xuan, but for the hidden "Creditor" behind him!  

"Gentlemen..."  

Lu Huaiyuan stood up. "Seventeen years ago, the previous sect master of Yu Hua Immortal Sect perished together with the 'Creditor' in Fengdu Mountain. Now, perhaps the Creditor still lives, but our former sect master is truly dead."  

His expression solemn, Lu Huaiyuan declared, "The Yu Hua Immortal Sect shares a blood feud with the Creditor. There is no possibility of any collusion between us!"  

"If not for that, we would not be speaking so politely now."  

The young master of Kunlun said coldly, "Today's events have humiliated us all. The more renowned we are in the Central Plains, the more ridiculous we appear. If Xin Xuan does not die, we will forever be a joke..."  

He turned to the Vajra Temple disciple. "Monk, come with me to track Xin Xuan."  

The disciple bowed. "This humble monk shall accompany you."  

The Great Zhou commander paused before speaking. "Four Leaf City is under Great Zhou's rule, and its people are our subjects. Now, it stands empty. Since this matter involves an elder of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect, we demand that your sect investigate thoroughly and provide an explanation to the court!"  

While these four peak True Qi realm experts negotiated, hundreds of elite soldiers and two hundred disciples of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect worked to clean up the aftermath. The elders of each peak also tallied their losses.  

"Seven dead and twelve wounded across all peaks."  

"In addition, forty-three spirit beasts and one hundred seventy-six exotic birds from the Beast Taming Hall perished or were injured."  

"After the golden decree was issued last night, all peak elders gathered, and disciples arrived one after another. However, as of dawn, six were still missing."  

"Five arrived before noon and have been punished."  

"The last one—Li Zhengjing of the Ancient Moon Peak—was assigned to investigate disturbances in the southwest of Xuanling Prefecture. But according to my spirit beast's tracking..."  

The Beast Taming Hall elder looked at Chen Xuan. "He never reached the southwest of Xuanling Prefecture."  

Chen Xuan's face darkened with fury. "A coward who fled from battle, unworthy of being a disciple of our sect! Pass my order—search for Li Zhengjing and capture him. If he resists, kill him on the spot!"  

Beside him, Chen Yang bowed and declared loudly, "Yes! This disciple will execute the traitor to uphold our sect's laws!"  

The elders of the other peaks remained indifferent, turning a blind eye.  

After today's events, everyone was seething with anger.  

In their fury, killing one cowardly inner disciple was nothing.  

Just as the order was issued, a figure slowly approached the city from outside.  

A disciple immediately reported to the elders.  

"Li Zhengjing of the Ancient Moon Peak has appeared outside the city!"  

"Seize him!" Elder Chen Xuan roared, flicking his sleeve. "If he resists, kill him!"  

"This disciple obeys!" Chen Yang responded immediately.  

"Wait!" A young female disciple from the Beast Taming Hall stepped forward. "Elder Chen Xuan, since Li Zhengjing is coming to Four Leaf City, it proves he is answering the summons, not fleeing in fear. Let him enter and explain himself!"  

"Helian Qingyu, what concern is this of yours?" Chen Yang snapped.  

"Whether it's the Ancient Moon Peak or the Beast Taming Hall, we are all part of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect," Helian Qingyu replied. "As fellow disciples, how can I remain silent?"  

"Enough! Since he's here, he's not running away..."  

The Beast Taming Hall elder raised a hand, shooting Helian Qingyu a displeased look but ultimately choosing to protect his disciple. "Let him enter and explain himself."  

"Fine, as you say."  

Chen Xuan waved dismissively. "No need to capture him. Let him come in."  

Since another elder had spoken reasonably, he saw no need to argue further.  

Li Zhengjing's appearance meant he could not escape punishment. Once inside the city, he would be at the mercy of the elders.  

Executing him publicly under sect law would be more appropriate!  

The discussion also reached the ears of the four powerful figures, who turned their gazes toward the city gate, where a young man walked in slowly.  

"Him?"  

The young master of Kunlun and the Vajra Temple disciple exchanged surprised glances.  

Lu Huaiyuan frowned, never expecting that the coward who had fled the battle and humiliated the sect in front of all these forces was the young man he had once held in high regard.  

Only the Great Zhou commander remained expressionless.  

The young man walked through the city gates.  

Everywhere he passed, whether soldiers or disciples, all eyes were on him—filled with anger, pity, but mostly disdain.  

Li Zhengjing met their gazes, fully aware of what awaited him.  

As he entered the inner city, a voice thundered.  

"Li Zhengjing, do you admit your crimes?"  

"What crimes?" Li Zhengjing countered.  

"You were assigned to investigate the southwest of Xuanling Prefecture but never arrived—dereliction of duty!" Elder Chen Xuan barked.  

"That charge I admit," Li Zhengjing said calmly.  

"Last night, the golden decree summoned all disciples, yet you arrived only now—desertion and cowardice!"  

Elder Chen Xuan's voice was icy. "For these two crimes, death is too light a punishment! Today, before all our fellow disciples and esteemed guests, I shall execute you to uphold sect law! Come forth and accept your fate!"  

"You can add another charge—disrespecting elders!"  

Li Zhengjing untied the bundle on his back and pulled out an object. He looked ahead and said coolly, "You blind old fool, as useless as Chen Yang..."  

His voice echoed, chilling the air.  

In an instant, all eyes turned to him in shock.  

Under the sect's strict laws, disrespecting elders was a grave offense!  

Yet here he stood, not begging for mercy but facing death with defiance.  

If he had such courage, why had he fled in the first place?  

"Good! Good! Good!"  

Elder Chen Xuan spat out three words, his face twisted with rage. "For these three crimes, I shall execute you myself!"  

He strode forward, murder in his eyes.  

But Li Zhengjing remained unperturbed.  

With a casual flick of his wrist, he tossed the object in his hand.  

It rolled to a stop at Chen Xuan's feet.  

The elder halted abruptly.  

Then, Li Zhengjing's voice rang out clearly.  

"Xin Xuan's severed head—two thousand merits. Is that enough to atone for three crimes?"  

Pausing, he looked at Chen Xuan's stunned face and added calmly, "What you failed to obtain, I brought back."  

Then, locking eyes with the elder, he said earnestly, "Elder Chen Xuan, you truly are useless."
