# Chapter 90: Refining the Dharma Protector Deity

Prime Saint Sect, Firmament-Mending Peak.

The moment Xiao Shiye drew the multicolored merit fish and began refining it, Yu Suzhen made her move, activating Heaven's Thieving Mechanism. The immense cultivation qi-flow of the multicolored merit fish, capable of elevating a mortal to the Great Circle of Qi Condensation overnight, was naturally absorbed by Yu Suzhen with ease. In an instant, Yu Suzhen's cultivation surged!

It all happened too quickly for Yu Suzhen to even react, but it didn't hinder her ecstatic joy. Could this be her fortuitous encounter?

"Am I about to ascend to heaven in one step?"

The very next second after this thought arose in Yu Suzhen, a familiar sensation suddenly spread from her Dantian, rapidly sweeping through her entire body.

This is Heaven's Thieving Mechanism?!

Instantly, Yu Suzhen's beautiful face changed drastically as she incredulously sensed her qi-flow, which should have been breaking through to Qi Condensation Completion, begin to recede even faster. She knew this feeling all too well. She had controlled countless disciples and created countless puppets during this period, but only at this moment did she realize that she herself was someone else's puppet! But when? Who had acted upon her without her own knowledge?

Soon, a sense of weakness emerged in her heart. Her joy turned to sorrow, and horror replaced ecstasy. The feeling of her cultivation being slowly plundered twisted Yu Suzhen's pretty face, and she couldn't help but cry out:

"Wait, wait a moment..."

Before her words finished, the suction force suddenly doubled. The next second, Yu Suzhen's qi-flow plummeted to the bottom. All her true qi, cultivation, qi-flow, and even her very soul were drained, flowing out of the Saint Sect.

Almost simultaneously, two fissures suddenly appeared within Yu Suzhen's immortal's cave. Following closely, two figures, one after the other, stepped out from the fissures, their gazes immediately falling upon Yu Suzhen's corpse.

"One step too late..." Daoist Hongyun's expression was calm, yet only his icy, bone-chilling eyes revealed his true fury at this moment. The next second, he turned his head, his gaze fixed directly on the Firmament-Mending Peak Master: "Chen Taihe, do you wish to fight me?"

Throughout the entire Saint Sect, his condition was widely known. Whoever dared to snatch the bait he used to fish for qi-flow was effectively cutting his lifespan, and would inevitably face his most ferocious retaliation. For this reason, even True Monarch Chongguang, who had the most conflict with him, dared not make a move. After all, his status was too high. Even if he was not as formidable as in the past, he was still not someone an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator could compare to.

Yet, Daoist Hongyun never expected that the Firmament-Mending Peak Master, who he merely had some minor disputes with, would actually conceal karma and do something so significant!

"Fellow Daoist Hongyun, calm yourself." Compared to the furious Hongyun, the Firmament-Mending Peak Master appeared quite calm: "The one who acted is the junior who previously took the karma of the Coiling Dragon inheritance. Following this qi-flow, you and I might be able to chase back that multicolored merit fish. Although it will inevitably be damaged quite a bit, it's still better than nothing... Of course, if fellow Daoist insists on fighting me, I wouldn't mind witnessing the demeanor of a former True Monarch."

The Firmament-Mending Peak Master likewise did not intend to utterly offend Daoist Hongyun. After all, he merely wanted to do Chongguang a favor, so simply reducing Daoist Hongyun's gains would suffice; there was no need to truly make him gain nothing. In this way, he wouldn't be seen by Daoist Hongyun as an eyesore or a thorn in his side. At most, their relationship would worsen, but it wasn't good to begin with, and with Chongguang as a major enemy ahead, it actually didn't matter much. Everything was within his plan.

The Firmament-Mending Peak Master smiled faintly, then performed a quick divination, quickly locating Lu Yang's direction. He immediately took a step, crossing the void to pursue. Daoist Hongyun gritted his teeth slightly, but could only follow closely behind.

Meanwhile, within the Witch Ghost Secret Realm.

As a stream of light streaked through the void, Lu Yang suddenly opened his eyes, showing joy but also looking gravely in the direction of the Prime Saint Sect.

"Old fellow... as expected, he's plotting against me!"

Lu Yang exhaled, but did not panic. The Firmament-Mending Peak Master and Daoist Hongyun pursuing him was within his expectations; rather, it was exactly as he wished! Thinking of this, Lu Yang looked at the Innate Primal Chaos One Qi Divine Talisman in his embrace. The next second, he took off this supreme treasure that could obscure karma, voluntarily leaving its protection, and instead shot it into the Witch Ghost Secret Realm!

"At this point, there's no meaning in hiding my karma anymore. Instead, it's the karma of the Witch Ghost Secret Realm that needs to be concealed... Once the Firmament-Mending Peak Master arrives and fails to divine that this is the Witch Ghost Secret Realm, if he opens it rashly, the Golden Core sword qi within the secret realm can give him a harsh blow..."

A trace of ruthlessness flashed in Lu Yang's eyes at this thought. "Although the Saint Sect's foundation is far beyond what the Witch Ghost Dao can compare to, and the Firmament-Mending Peak Master is a peak master, he might have life-saving items at the Golden Core level. But with one Golden Core sword qi strike, he won't be unscathed. At that time, if I can refine a Foundation Establishment Dharma Protector Deity, I can conveniently beat him when he's down, and wash away the shame of being pressed to death by his single finger in my previous life..."

Thinking of this, Lu Yang dared not delay. "Begin refining the Dharma Protector Deity immediately!"

Heaven's Thieving Mechanism operated, and the flowing light in his hand dispersed, revealing Yu Suzhen's bewildered soul, along with the immense cultivation and qi-flow belonging to the multicolored merit fish. The next second, Lu Yang unfurled the Myriad Spirits Banner. Black light shimmered on the banner, and thousands of witch ghosts roared in unison, among them the eight red-clothed ghosts required for cultivating the [Xuanming Underworld Lord's Soul-Seizing Position]. As the banner swayed, the [Yama Hall] that Grandmaster Tingyou once displayed reappeared.

"Great Avatar Universal Gathering Divine Art!"

Lu Yang formed hand seals, his movements ceaseless. His vast spiritual sense transformed into a large hand, enveloping Yu Suzhen's soul. He grabbed it, refining it in an instant.

"Ah—!"

Yu Suzhen's wail immediately sounded, but quickly weakened, then transformed into a ball of spiritual light, re-condensing into a new soul. The brand new soul was identical to Yu Suzhen, yet it had been refined anew by Lu Yang, inside and out. At this moment, it looked at Lu Yang with vacant eyes.

Soon, the soul gradually solidified. The originally bare delicate body was finally covered by a thin veil. Her snow-white dress bloomed like a lotus, and a pair of small, exquisite bare feet dangled in mid-air.

Originally, at this step, the Dharma Protector Deity would be considered refined. However, Lu Yang was still not at ease. After all, he intended for the other party to feign Foundation Establishment. But what if it became too strong and broke free from his control? Such a thing could not be unguarded against. After all, he didn't want to one day hear "What a Yu Suzhen, indeed there are countless heroes in this world" – that would truly be a huge joke.

Therefore, he didn't stop. Instead, he shook the Myriad Spirits Banner, drawing the Dharma Protector Deity back into the banner. At the same time, he engraved a large number of self-destructing restrictions onto Yu Suzhen's soul, creating triple insurance. As soon as the other party had any thought of betrayal, they would immediately suffer eternal damnation, ensuring Lu Yang would not be backlashed.

And so, a moment passed.

As Lu Yang formed a hand seal, Yu Suzhen's vacant eyes suddenly lit up, like a dragon being given its eyes. Her stagnant thoughts began to function again at this moment. The next second, she looked at Lu Yang. Her voluptuous, delicate body slowly knelt, her fair forehead pressed firmly against the ground. Her crisp, pleasant voice was filled with obedience: "This servant greets master."

Lu Yang nodded with satisfaction upon seeing this: "You are no longer the soul of the past. From now on, you shall be called Sunü."

As a Dharma Protector Deity, with the Myriad Spirits Banner and self-destructing restrictions in place, Sunü's life and death were now in his single thought, so he had no need to worry about her stabbing him in the back during battle.

"...Return to your post."

With a thought from Lu Yang, Sunü, now refined into a Dharma Protector Deity, floated up gracefully and landed within the [Yama Hall], seating herself on the main throne. Immediately after, Lu Yang injected the qi-flow of the multicolored merit fish into the [Yama Hall]. He saw the qi-flow, like fire, tempering refined iron, gradually forging the [Yama Hall], which was originally just a simple patchwork, into a unified whole.

However, at this very moment—

"Boom!"

Hearing a loud bang, Lu Yang abruptly looked up, his gaze piercing through the Witch Ghost Secret Realm, seeing above Skeleton Mountain a spatial fissure suddenly appear out of thin air.

The Firmament-Mending Peak Master and Daoist Hongyun stepped out.

The great enemy had arrived!
