# Chapter 232: As Expected, Penalty Grades Never Have Normal Rewards

"Junior Li... Junior Li?"

Wei Zhaoliu's voice reached his ears, pulling Li Mo out of his dizziness. When he opened his eyes, it felt as if an entire lifetime had passed.

The Slanting Moon Three Stars Cave was gone. He was still at the top of the Sword Pavilion.

The strange stone remained the same, and the scroll lay quietly where it was.

Wei Zhaoliu asked with a mix of surprise and doubt, "Master was also at fault for not telling you that this strange stone shouldn't be touched casually. Are you feeling better?"

"I didn't faint because of the stone..."

Li Mo picked up the scroll. Inside was precisely the Slanting Moon Three Stars Cave he had just seen. The divine intent within it shook his mind with a single glance. His Intent Soul showed signs of being awakened, so he quickly suppressed it.

One cannot speak of ice to summer insects, nor speak of the Dao to mortals. He currently lacked the foundation to fully comprehend the divine abilities depicted in the God Observation Diagram. But one day in the future, once his Intent Soul grows stronger, the abilities on the diagram would eventually be his to command!

Looking at the God Observation Diagram, Li Mo couldn't help but feel his heart surge with passion, his gaze burning.

Then he noticed Wei Zhaoliu's strange expression.

"What is it?"

"Why are you staring at a strange monkey and grinning foolishly?"

"...This is the God Observation Diagram."

Li Mo was momentarily confused.

Wei Zhaoliu seemed to understand something and said, "Yes, yes, yes. If Junior Li says it is, then it is."

"It's perfectly normal to fail when copying the strange stone. There's no need to feel ashamed."

She assumed that Li Mo had failed to draw the God Observation Diagram and, being a proud youth, couldn't bear to lose face, which was why he said that. After all, how could a perfectly good stone turn into a monkey?

Fortunately, Junior Li was just saving face, not suffering from a head injury.

"..."

Li Mo seemed to understand now.

The divine intent in this diagram did not belong to the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. In the eyes of others, this was just a slightly more exquisite painting. He was able to observe it because he possessed a Celestial Body.

......

The sun slowly set.

In the vast Sword Pond, all the Sword City disciples, and even several elders, stood up to pay their respects. The object of their salutations was a girl who looked to be of a young age.

If this scene had occurred in the past, it would have left countless people dumbfounded.

Ying Bing was momentarily speechless.

Hmm...

In the past, facing such a scene, she would have simply ignored it. After all, she had observed the Sword City's strange stone and, in return, preached the Dao here, settling the debt between them.

But now, looking at the various gazes below—some looking at her as if she were a deity, others filled with gratitude—she felt a momentary daze.

Is this why he always likes to help others?

If it were him, he would probably say something like...

Ying Bing spoke softly, "No need for thanks. I hope everyone remains sincere in the future, and all may touch the profound mysteries of the Sword Dao."

It was the moment when the sun set and the moon rose.

The swords nurturing in the Sword Pond all stirred with spiritual energy, and the sound of their clashing and鸣(ringing) filled the air, as if responding to her words.

Most of these swords had been used by generations of Sword City swordsmen, and they contained lingering wills within. Now, they all manifested, turning into pure divine intent and converging towards the platform.

The girl stood alone there, a sword in her right hand and a large-headed doll in her left. She wore a goose-yellow dress today, but it couldn't conceal her fair, luminous skin. Her eyebrows were like distant mountains, her eyes held the moon within, her bones were made of bright jade, and her spirit was like autumn waters. Surrounded by divine intent, she looked even less like a person of this world.

Under the gaze of the crowd...

"Has Lady Ying broken through again?"

"I almost forgot, she's only sixteen years old..."

"Isn't the very reason our Hengyun Sword City stands to this day, inviting martial artists from all over to observe the strange stone, based on her words back then?"

"No wonder she could elicit a response from the lingering divine intent of the ancestors."

"The Hidden Dragon List was released too early. If it were a bit later, Lady Ying would surely be ranked higher than eighteenth."

"I still find it a bit unbelievable. To make the Sword Pond boil with just a few words, it's too incredible."

"Don't forget, Junior Li is a 'Wang Qi Dou Hun' (a term implying he brings good fortune to his wife). I have a bold conjecture..."

......

"?"

Ying Bing herself hadn't expected the breakthrough to come so suddenly, nor that it would cause such a huge commotion.

"It is a blessing for these dusty swords to be able to help Lady Ying break through," said Elder Zeng. For some reason, there was little surprise in his eyes, but rather a lot of curiosity.

"This is a joyous occasion worth celebrating. Why doesn't Lady Ying stay for a banquet tonight?"

"No, I prefer simple food."

Ying Bing's gaze softened as she looked into the distance.

She said no more and stepped down from the platform.

Elder Zeng raised an eyebrow, following her gaze.

He saw a young man crouching under a tree at the entrance of the Sword Pond. He was holding a twig, drawing something on the ground for Jiang Chulong, who was beside him.

Ying Bing walked up to the young man and crouched beside him for a while.

Then, the three of them left together. With their backs to the setting sun and facing the new moon, their figures gradually blurred.

The elders fell into deep thought.

What were they here for again?

Suddenly, they felt as if they were just a bunch of dogs watching a show.

......

The night was cool as water.

In the courtyard of the tavern.

Li Mo sat cross-legged in his room, the God Observation Diagram resting on his knees. The small figure in his Dantian glowed with a faint light, but unlike before, it wasn't the mysterious and noble moon patterns that lit up. Instead, it was the divine intent slowly flowing out from the God Observation Diagram before his eyes.

"Phew..."

After a long while, Li Mo let out a long breath.

Even though the divine ability within was presented to him through the God Observation Diagram using the methods of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, it still put considerable pressure on his spirit. Observing the "Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao" was even more difficult than observing the Extreme Form he had done before.

Of course, if he could complete the observation, the benefits would be unimaginable.

"This is only the Extreme Form."

"What would it be like if it became a Great Dao Divine Form one day?"

Unfortunately, he currently lacked the Golden Creation Seal. So far, that item only appeared as a reward when he invested in the Ice Cube.

"She broke through today, so she should be consolidating her realm, right?" Li Mo shook his head and continued his comprehension.

......

On the roof of the tavern.

Sitting on a massage chair, Ying Bing observed the forms of the hundred birds imprinted in her mind. She was always serious when practicing.

For some reason, she felt a bit restless today...

Was it because she had grown accustomed to dual-cultivating with him?

But she and Li Mo hadn't even said much to each other today.

Suddenly, illusory text appeared before her eyes.

[You have a Grade B reward waiting to be claimed.]

It was the reward for the penalty grade...

No.

It was hard to call this a reward.

Ying Bing's footsteps paused.

Even if she didn't want it, the system would definitely issue it...

As expected.

This time, the system didn't even bother to pretend, or perhaps it had sensed her thoughts.

[This Grade C reward is: Kiss Li Mo.]

Ying Bing: "..."

She began to suspect that penalty grades fundamentally never have normal rewards.
