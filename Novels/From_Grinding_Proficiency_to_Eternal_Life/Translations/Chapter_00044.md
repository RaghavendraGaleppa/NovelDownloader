# Chapter 44: Disposal

He concealed his presence and moved without a sound, arriving at the inn.

Since he had already killed Qin Bo, leaving this maiden, Fei Yao, alive was a hidden danger. If he didn't deal with her early and she managed to send a message, the Jingtao Sect might send people over. He would have to find a new place to settle down and change his name and identity again, which was far too troublesome.

Beiye City was located on the borderlands. Many centralized imperial systems were difficult to implement here, which was why the trade of household registrations could openly occur in the brokerage houses. In other places, even if one tried to use money to pave the way, one would still need connections in high places.

"Why hasn't Senior Brother returned yet?"

Fei Yao, who had been sitting at the table lost in thought while propping her chin up, straightened her body and muttered to herself.

Qin Bo had said he was going to visit the martial artist who had taken his ancestral home again, telling her not to wander around and to wait for his return. But a whole day had already passed.

She slowly stood up and walked to the window, pushing it open to look at the situation outside.

Before she could react, a large face suddenly appeared before her, mere inches away, so close that she could clearly feel the breath exhaled by the other party.

She instinctively wanted to scream, but she saw a large hand sweep over like lightning, firmly covering her mouth.

Immediately after, a heavy, muffled sound came from the back of her head. A sharp pain followed, her vision went black, and she lost consciousness completely.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the bloodstains on the iron hammer. His gaze fell on the back of Fei Yao's head, which had been crushed flat by the blow, leaving her completely lifeless.

He moved silently, sweeping his eyes around the room. From the two of them's bundles, he finally found a martial arts manual.

"Jingtao Palm."

Xu Yunfan looked at the three bold, flamboyant characters on the cover of the manual, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes. This was the first time he had looted equipment from someone. Without any further hesitation, he picked up the two bundles with one hand and Fei Yao's corpse with the other. With an agile figure, he vaulted out of the window again.

The night was as dark as ink, and all was silent. Under the guidance of his Hunting skill, he moved without a trace, returning to the Qinghe Courtyard without any obstacles.

On Fei Yao's body, Xu Yunfan found nothing else of value. Aside from a bag of gold leaves he found in the bundle, he came up empty.

With the experience of dealing with Qin Bo, he handled Fei Yao's corpse with practiced ease. He tied several heavy stones to the body and, following a pre-dug sewer channel, sank it to the bottom of the Clear River River. The fish and shrimp at the bottom of the river would naturally help him cover his tracks.

He gathered the two's clothes together and set them on fire.

After finishing everything, Xu Yunfan straightened his body and clapped his hands. He drew several buckets of water from the well nearby to wash himself completely clean before walking into the room.

He gently placed the wooden statue of the Power-Awareness Bodhisattva, which he had previously wrapped in coarse cloth, on the desk.

As for the Jingtao Palm, he skimmed through it and found it was a technique for training the muscles, so he set it aside for now. He would study it seriously after he had perfected the Swift Shadow Leg.

Under the flickering candlelight, the shadow of the wooden statue was cast onto the wall, appearing magnified dozens of times, almost covering half the room.

As the candlelight flickered continuously, the shadow of the Power-Awareness Bodhisattva statue seemed to come alive, twisting and changing, creating a terrifying atmosphere.

Xu Yunfan's expression was calm, without a trace of fear.

He slowly formed the Hand Seal of the First Word in front of his chest and silently recited the Upper Good Like Water Mantra in his mind.

Gradually, as time passed, his mind was pulled by the lingering scripture, entering a wonderful state that was neither empty nor void.

Deep in his mind, the statue that had taken countless mental efforts to gradually form was now clearer than ever before. Although the facial features were still indistinct, the body and the corners of the clothes were gradually showing clear outlines.

As Xu Yunfan closed his eyes and recited the scriptures, the wooden Bodhisattva statue before him, under the faint candlelight, made its three faces appear increasingly sinister and evil.

In a way that the naked eye could not detect, Xu Yunfan faintly heard waves of roars. The sound was grand and vast, like rolling thunder, shaking his spiritual world.

However, the deity visualized by the First Word Seal stood like a sea-stabilizing needle, firmly guarding his Sea of Consciousness.

No matter how many chaotic shocks came from the outside, they were like a breeze brushing over the lake surface before reaching him, unable to stir a single ripple.

"You have encountered缠绕 (entwining) of an ominous aura."

"You are practicing the First Word Seal and unexpectedly discover that it can融 (merge with) the ominous aura. You feel your spirit has become stronger, and the proficiency of the First Word Seal has increased."

"You recite the Upper Good Like Water Mantra, cleansing all the ominous aura lingering around you. It has consumed a great deal of your spirit, but as a result, you can visibly feel your spirit becoming more resilient, and the proficiency of the First Word Seal has increased."

'...'

Half an hour later, Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were filled with exhaustion, but deep within them, there was an irrepressible excitement.

This was the first time since he began cultivating the First Word Seal that he had broken through his cultivation time limit and reached one hour.

His gaze fell on the Power-Awareness Bodhisattva statue on the desk. He understood in his heart that it was this wooden statue that had almost doubled his cultivation time.

Originally, after cultivating for about half an hour, his spirit would become extremely exhausted, but today he had forcefully pushed past the one-hour mark.

"Hm?"

Xu Yunfan suddenly noticed a fine crack on the wooden statue on the table.

"Was it caused by my cultivation of the First Word Seal?"

Xu Yunfan pondered this internally and vaguely understood the reason.

This Power-Awareness Bodhisattva wooden statue clearly did not just have an ominous aura lingering around it; it also possessed a divine quality he couldn't detect. He even suspected that there might be a spirit residing within the statue.

"Mount Ji Cloud, Thousand Buddha Temple. I must find a chance to go and take a look; there might be unexpected gains."

With this thought in mind, Xu Yunfan could no longer hold on. He walked straight to the bed, lay down, turned over, and fell into a deep sleep.

On the desk opposite the bed, the Power-Awareness Bodhisattva statue was placed quietly in the center. Under the candlelight, the shadow that had originally covered half the room was now visibly much smaller, and even the sinister and evil energy on the three faces had dissipated slightly.

Early the next morning, sunlight shone through the window and fell upon the Qinghe Courtyard.

Xu Yunfan had already eaten several large bowls of noodles at the morning market. Now, he stood in the courtyard, wearing only a pair of shorts, revealing an extremely robust body with muscles bulging like mountain peaks and clear lines.

The Swift Shadow Leg had just over thirty points of proficiency left to reach perfection. Today was the day it would naturally come to fruition.

He took a deep breath and tensed all the muscles in his body.

From the outside, one could see Xu Yunfan's muscles surging like turbulent waves, constantly rising and falling, full of power.

Then, he slightly bent his body, lowering his posture, and slowly accumulated strength in his legs.

At this moment, it was clearly visible that the muscles on his legs were like taut steel cables, each distinct and stretched straight, every muscle accumulating astonishing power.

*Whoosh!*

The tendons snapped, producing a loud sound, like a thunderclap and the twang of a bowstring suddenly exploding within the courtyard. Immediately after, the whistling sound of wind breaking filled the air.

As a light-body technique, the Swift Shadow Leg did not have any offensive moves. Once mastered, it was best suited for long-distance travel with enduring stamina.
