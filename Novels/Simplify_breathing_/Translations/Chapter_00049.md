**Chapter 49: Mountain Village**

“Yan Qing, Yan Ding, Twin Swords!” A husband and wife revealed their longswords.
“Chi Defeng, Staff Arts.”
“Feng Yu, Crutch!” An old woman tapped her crutch. Chen Fei glanced at the old woman, his nose twitching slightly. A faint, cloying scent wafted to his nostrils—the smell of potent poison.
“Chen Mu, Archery!” Chen Fei patted the longbow on his back.

“Alright, it’s getting late, let’s go. From here to Xingfen City, it should take about five days if all goes well.” Qian Jijiang nodded and led the way, with the others following in turn. All of them were martial artists; their stamina and movement techniques far surpassed those of ordinary people. While they couldn't compare to horses, their speed was certainly not slow.

Chen Fei looked back at Pingyin County. Being several li away, he could only see a blurry outline at this moment. After spending several months in this county town, transforming from a menial laborer who couldn't even afford meat to someone skilled in an art, Chen Fei couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion. He lowered his gaze to the mark on his arm. The further they moved from Pingyin County, the less active the mark became.

Dozens of meters away, Chen Fei returned from relieving himself and watched Chi Defeng and Qian Jijiang whispering to each other, feeling a slight sourness in his teeth. Although he didn't know what they were discussing, money was definitely involved. Chen Fei had originally suspected they knew each other because Chi Defeng had paid so readily then—that wasn't something a greedy person would do. However, Chen Fei didn't feel any heartache over the money. Compared to leaving Pingyin County, that sum was negligible. With alchemy mastered, earning that amount back would only take a few batches of pills.

After a brief rest, the group resumed their journey. Initially, there was a main road to follow, but the further they went, the more blurred the road's demarcation became. Clearly, it had been too long since any merchant caravans had passed, and many paths were already overgrown with weeds. The group pressed on without incident, although they encountered refugees several times along the way, always keeping their distance.

“There should be a dilapidated temple nearby. We can rest there tonight,” Qian Jijiang said, surveying their surroundings and discerning their location. In his younger years, Qian Jijiang had been a member of a bodyguard agency, traveling extensively across the land, only retiring in recent years. He had expected to enjoy his golden years in Pingyin County, but so many things had happened that he was forced to venture out again. If he exhausted the food in his spatial grid by then, Chen Fei estimated he'd be circling aimlessly in the wilderness.

“We’ll be spending the night in the forest tonight, everyone pick up the pace, it’s getting dark.” Qian Jijiang glanced at the sky and urged them on. The others remained silent, unconsciously quickening their steps. Everyone obediently followed Qian Jijiang’s commands.

“Lights ahead.” Under the cover of night, Yan Qing surprisingly pointed forward. The group looked up and indeed saw faint lights flickering in the distance.
“A village nearby?” Chi Defeng turned to Qian Jijiang.
“I don’t remember.” Qian Jijiang frowned slightly. It had been many years since he’d been out, and he only remembered general landmarks; it was impossible to recall every detail.
“Should we ask to stay in the village?” The old woman Feng Yu asked softly. A village was undoubtedly much safer than the wilderness. Given the choice, they would, of course, prefer the village. The others looked at Qian Jijiang, awaiting his decision.
