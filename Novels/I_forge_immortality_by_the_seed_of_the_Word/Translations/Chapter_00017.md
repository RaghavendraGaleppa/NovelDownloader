# Chapter 17: The Struggle for Top Ten, Undercurrents Surging (Combined)

"Indeed, the top ten receive fifty Dao Merits per month for a full year, distributed monthly," Ji Bochang confirmed emphatically.

Zhang Jing's expression turned serious.

Fifty Dao Merits per month.

At first glance, it didn't seem like much—unless one knew the true value, which Zhang Jing now did after inquiring with Senior Brother Liu about mid-grade cultivation techniques.

This reward was substantial.

Fifty per month meant six hundred Dao Merits in a year.

Nearly equivalent to half the cost of a mid-grade cultivation technique.

According to Senior Brother Liu, this represented twenty to thirty years of savings for an ordinary outer sect disciple.

And how many thirty-year lifespans did outer sect disciples have?

"Calculating this way, it's essentially the Dao Academy covering all cultivation resources for top ten examinees during their early years in the outer sect. They can focus solely on cultivation without worrying about Dao Merits."

Zhang Jing exhaled deeply.

He could imagine how frenzied those 'Class B geniuses' would become upon hearing this news. Especially since the first and second places were virtually reserved for the two 'Class A freaks', leaving precious few spots available.

At this moment, Zhang Jing recalled Senior Brother Liu's advice: strive to officially guide qi into the body and enter the Qi Refinement Realm before the thirty-day examination period ends.

A flash of fervor crossed his eyes.

These six hundred Dao Merits were crucial for him too, especially since he coveted the [Ocean-Overturning Dragon Devouring Void True Method].

He had to compete for them.

"Brother Ji," Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed, "did your esteemed senior sister mention how the rankings are determined?"

Hearing this, Ji Bochang's face fell.

"Who knows which idiot—" he began, then quickly covered his mouth before continuing sheepishly, "I mean, which benevolent, kind, and wise immortal elder designed these rules where each examination's ranking method differs. My senior sister told me they've used everything from spirit chess tournaments to strength contests, cultivation level rankings, spiritual sense evaluations, and so on."

"Our previous cohort three years ago determined rankings through combat."

Zhang Jing stared in astonishment.

"Combat? Strength contests? Cultivation levels?" he asked incredulously. "Doesn't that disadvantage those who only master the visualization method later in the examination?"

"Disadvantage?" Ji Bochang shook his head bluntly. "Brother Zhang, you're too polite. It's not just a disadvantage—it completely excludes them."

Gradually, Zhang Jing understood.

Regardless of the ranking method, participants' cultivation levels would be decisive. Combined with rewards only going to the top thirty, this system indeed left little room for Class D examinees, with only slight hope for Class C candidates.

This was the Dao Academy's consistent approach—no pretense of 'fairness'. Resources were allocated purely based on talent, fortune, ability, and cultivation.

Zhang Jing's gaze fell on the虚幻玉符 before him:

[Five Organs Water Origin Method·Uninitiated (0/50)]
[Pure Essence Breathing Visualization·Level 1 (19/100)]
Skill Trait: Primordial Yuan Gathering Light (Low-grade)
[Low-grade Dharma Seed: Mind's Eye (Cannot be upgraded)]
[Dark Python Devours Void Dao Rhyme·Fragment (Cannot be upgraded)]

"With Mind's Eye enhancing comprehension, the Dark Python Fragment assisting qi absorption, and Primordial Yuan Light improving refinement speed and purity... I should have a chance at top ten," Zhang Jing thought privately.

Before he realized it...

"Brother Zhang, we're here!" Ji Bochang called from ahead.

Zhang Jing looked up to see two small courtyards spaced about 150 paces apart, flanking a small pond about ten zhang across. The half-acre courtyards appeared constructed from some hardened earthen material, forming seamless structures.

The evening scenery unfolded before him—birds returning to forests, their calls rising and falling; golden light dancing on rippling water.

"Rich spiritual energy, tranquil environment—what a wonderful place!" Zhang Jing exclaimed, taking a deep breath.

"Naturally, my taste is impeccable," Ji Bochang said smugly, pointing to the rear courtyard. "That one's yours, Brother Zhang."

"Many thanks."

Shouldering his belongings, Zhang Jing approached the unoccupied courtyard and pushed the door open.

Creak—

As the door opened slightly, a head suddenly poked through the gap.

"Brother Zhang, may I come in?" a timid voice asked.

"You... already have," Zhang Jing said flatly, eyeing Ji Bochang's intruding head.

"Hehe, you didn't lock the door," Ji Bochang chuckled, then raised a hand solemnly. "My apologies for the intrusion. I swear upon my Dao heart—never again."

'You've barely begun cultivating—what Dao heart?' Zhang Jing thought, suppressing an eye twitch while vowing internally: 'I must lock doors in future.'

Turning, he met Ji Bochang's eager gaze and instinctively stepped back. "Brother Ji, what is it?"

"Well, you promised to advise me on my fan painting earlier... No time like the present? I'm quite anxious."

Zhang Jing nearly sighed in relief—he'd feared something else entirely. "Ah, that's simple enough."

Soon, Ji Bochang's exclamations and peculiar, unsettling chuckles intermittently filled Zhang Jing's quarters.

Later, while seeing Ji Bochang out, Zhang Jing asked curiously: "Brother Ji, why the urgency over such... unconventional art? Shouldn't cultivation be your priority now?"

"Brother Zhang, you wouldn't understand my senior sister's pleasures," Ji Bochang said meaningfully. "Besides, this is my cultivation."

"Wait—" Zhang Jing's expression turned odd. "Which mid-grade method did you choose?"

"[Fish-Dragon Harmony Manual], of course."

"That dual cultivation technique?!" Zhang Jing recognized the name, staring at Ji Bochang in disbelief—was he serious?

Ji Bochang merely smiled mysteriously, flourishing his spring-themed fan. "It's about affinity—not my choice, really."

Watching Ji Bochang's retreating, somewhat unsteady figure, Zhang Jing felt strangely... envious?

"Brother Ji, you're going the wrong way!" Zhang Jing called as Ji Bochang wandered off.

Waving without turning, Ji Bochang replied: "I'm visiting senior sister's cave tonight—terrifically rich spiritual energy there, superb for cultivation. I'll likely break through to Qi Refinement in two days. Do keep up, Brother Zhang!"

After Ji Bochang left, Zhang Jing took several deep breaths to calm himself. "Perhaps it's better this way—I prefer quiet for cultivation."

Night deepened.

In the cultivation chamber, candlelight flickered.

Zhang Jing had upgraded accommodations—his courtyard contained reception rooms, bedrooms, study, and this dedicated cultivation chamber complete with a high-quality meditation mat woven from mind-calming grass.

A small label beside it read: 'Spirit-Converging Mat, woven entirely from Mind-Calming Grass. Soothes the spirit, slightly improves cultivation efficiency. Value: 15 Dao Merits. Three-day trial. Purchasers must repay 1 Dao Merit to the Artificer Pavilion every three months.'

The Artificer Pavilion's thoroughness was almost impressive. After learning mid-grade technique prices and top-ten rewards, Zhang Jing found this mat almost affordable.

Seated cross-legged, Zhang Jing closed his eyes and slowed his breathing.

A虚幻心眼 materialized, emitting a faint glow before settling into a half-closed state under Zhang Jing's control.

"About 15% enhancement—this level of activation balances spiritual sense consumption nicely," Zhang Jing assessed contentedly.

He then immersed himself in the [Five Organs Water Origin Method], contemplating its principles.

In his consciousness, the phantom of a raging river emerged—simultaneously conveying boundlessness and overwhelming power.

Hours passed until mental fatigue set in.

[Five Organs Water Origin Method·Uninitiated (15/70)]

"Enough for now. Next, the [Pure Essence Breathing Visualization]—can't neglect cultivation."

As Zhang Jing shifted focus, wisps of spiritual energy gathered around him, entering his body along specific pathways that gradually accelerated.

His entire being underwent subtle transformations—skin, meridians, organs, even hair strengthening progressively.

"I'm nearing true qi introduction into the body—the threshold of Qi Refinement," Zhang Jing realized.

Suddenly recalling something, he awakened the dormant Dark Python Devours Void Dao Rhyme within.

Roar—!

As the python's roar echoed mentally, Zhang Jing's spiritual sense tinged with a wild, devouring essence. Spiritual energy converged rapidly—50% faster than before.

Within his dantian, the pure white Primordial Yuan Light shone like a miniature sun.

Zhang Jing estimated five more days until full bodily transformation—coinciding perfectly with mastering the Five Organs method.

His understanding of cultivation deepened daily.

"Visualization initiates spiritual transformation; qi introduction transforms the body. Only a sufficiently strong body can withstand massive spiritual energy conversion into pure qi—which in turn enhances bodily affinity with qi."

"This reverse process resembles the legendary 'Return to Primordial' state," Zhang Jing mused, feeling strong enough to "punch through an ox"—not metaphorically, but literally.

Recalling a story where a mortal assassinated a sleeping immortal, Zhang Jing nearly laughed. Now he understood—even a passive Qi Refinement cultivator would be invulnerable to ordinary weapons.

Mortals and cultivators existed on entirely different planes.

The thought made Zhang Jing shudder—hadn't Instructor Wang (now Senior Brother Wang) restrained his strength when patting Zhang Jing's shoulder? Otherwise...

Next day, at the Inheritance Pavilion.

A graceful figure in emerald robes emerged, her flawless face flushed with excitement.

"Mid-grade method with three chi three cun affinity. I'll become the first Chu clan woman to enter the legendary inner sect!" Chu Lingyun vowed passionately. "If only I'd been born nine years earlier—I might've been first overall."

A green-robed man astride a spirit sparrow landed before her. "Junior Sister Chu Lingyun?" he inquired, admiring her beauty.

After confirming, the man produced a jade key, small vial, and bronze bracelet. "Your cousin is on a mission, so he asked me to deliver these. The vial contains ten Purple Spirit Pills to aid cultivation; the key leads to his cultivation cave; the bracelet is a low-grade protective artifact."

When Chu Lingyun questioned whether this violated academy rules, the senior laughed: "Not at all. Many outer sect teams are already competing to recruit your cohort's talents—especially for those two Class A monsters. The top teams are practically at war!"
