# Chapter 86: The Head of the House Descends the Mountain, Qingfeng Reaches Perfection

The sky was pitch black.

On the return journey, the seven or eight burly men accompanying Li Xian hid their sabers, spears, and staves under their clothes. They looked around nervously, afraid of encountering mountain bandits on the road again.

Li Xian led the way in front. For the remaining ten miles, there were no further disturbances.

They arrived at an open field outside the village. Li Xian said, "Dig a pit here and bury the weapons."

"Master, why not bury these weapons together with the bandits' corpses?" a villager asked.

"That place is too far away. Although these weapons are buried in the ground, they aren't completely useless," Li Xian said calmly. "If our deeds are exposed in the future, we must have swords and spears to pick up and fight back at any time."

"Ah!"

Everyone was terrified. Now that their blood had cooled, they thought about fighting the bandits to the death. How could they remain calm?

Li Xian said, "Your life is your own."

"The only one who can truly save you is yourselves. You can't rely on anyone else, and neither can I. I'm telling you, if the situation turns bad, I will return to the manor. No matter how powerful the Shanfeng Stronghold is, they wouldn't dare go to the manor to seek revenge."

"But you all cannot leave. So, if you harbor any侥幸 (luck), you will surely end up with your bones not even rotting together. You should think this through."

Everyone fell silent. Uncle Fu, being the oldest, understood things most clearly. He said, "Master is right. We have been bullied by the Shanfeng Stronghold for decades."

"We swallowed our anger and endured it every time, yet we were still bullied. They didn't kill us out of mercy; they didn't kill us because if they did, there would be no one left for them to bully."

"This time, people have died at the Shanfeng Stronghold. If this gets out, they will surely massacre the village..."

"Please instruct us on what to do, Master."

Li Xian said, "Being mentally prepared is a good thing, but there is no need to be overly nervous. Act as if nothing has happened. Go back and distribute the rice. Use the silver to buy more grain."

"Eat your fill, drink your fill, and sleep warmly. The Shanfeng Stronghold might not suspect us."

"If anyone asks, just say you know nothing about it."

Back in the wooden house.

The bright moon hung high.

Li Xian let out a soft breath of turbid air. The courtyard, stripped of the game he had hunted, looked empty. He calculated his silver; including what he had gotten before and after, he now had "nine taels."

The harvest was plentiful.

"The Shanfeng Stronghold has lost people; they will surely come down the mountain to investigate."

"I should keep a low profile recently and temporarily stop going up the mountain to hunt. I don't want to run right into them."

Li Xian looked out over the village. He saw a single lamp shining brightly. Clearly, Village Chief Uncle Fu was holding a village meeting regarding this matter.

"No matter what, only by increasing my strength can I escape this crisis."

Although it was late at night, Li Xian was still buzzing from the bloodshed, his mind stimulated, and he had no trace of sleepiness.

\[The silver moon reflects the frost and snow; the youth practices his art bitterly. Proficiency +3\]

The next day.

The sky had just brightened when suddenly, the sound of hoofbeats came from the direction of the east entrance. Li Xian had already gotten up and was practicing his fist techniques. Hearing the commotion, he immediately jumped onto the roof to look out.

Vaguely, he saw eight people arrive at the village entrance. The leader was dressed in cloth clothes, had a rough face, and carried a large saber on his shoulder. It was undoubtedly the Shanfeng Stronghold.

The Fourth Master, Lu Heng, shouted loudly, "Get up! Get up!"

A subordinate next to him immediately took out a gong and banged it vigorously. The sound of the gong shook the heavens, disturbing people's peaceful sleep.

The Black River Village had over a hundred households. The men of the house came out one by one, locking their wives and children inside, and gathered at the village entrance.

Uncle Fu, leaning on a crutch, arrived late, smiling. "Oh, it's the Fourth Master. Hello, hello." He cupped his fists and bowed, fawning as he approached the horse.

Lu Heng frowned his thick brows and looked down from his horse. "Xiao Fu, do you know why I'm here?"

"Fourth Master, everything our village could give, we've already given!" Uncle Fu said.

"Hmph!" Lu Heng said angrily, "Still playing dumb with me!" His words carried a force that shook people's minds, forcing their consciousness. Those with slightly weaker willpower wouldn't dare speak a lie.

Although Uncle Fu's legs were trembling, he had been frightened by this kind of intimidation countless times and was somewhat numb to it. He gritted his teeth and said, "I... I really don't know."

Lu Heng thought to himself: "These lowly peasants. Even if they had the heart, they wouldn't have the胆 (courage). A group of old, weak, sick, and disabled—how could they possibly deal with Fang Yaozi?"

"Fang Yaozi's disappearance probably has nothing to do with this place."

But since he was already here, he might as well ask. "Have you seen Fang Yaozi?"

"No, no," Uncle Fu shook his head vigorously.

"Alright, you're wasting my time." Lu Heng kicked Uncle Fu away and rode off into the distance.

Uncle Fu and the others breathed a huge sigh of relief.

"They really did come down the mountain," Li Xian, hiding in the shadows, had witnessed the entire scene.

If he were exposed, he had only two paths to take: fight back desperately with the villagers, or flee far away immediately.

"Uncle Fu just now had a huge flaw. Before Lu Heng even described Fang Yaozi's appearance, he shook his head immediately. It was like saying 'There is silver buried here'—he confessed without being tortured."

"But this Fourth Master is just a brute; he didn't notice at all."

Li Xian analyzed this secretly in his heart.

For now, the situation was generally trending toward the good.

"I wonder how long they will pursue this matter."

"Never mind..."

"Every day I delay is a day gained. I need to increase my strength as soon as possible!"

Three days passed in a flash.

It was a snowy, freezing day.

Snowflakes filled the sky. At the wooden house in the west of the village, Li Xian was bitterly practicing [Qingfeng Leg]. His leg technique was approaching perfection. When he kicked, his intent was profound, possessing an indescribable aura.

[Qingfeng Leg] was created by an ordinary martial artist who, resting by a lake and looking up at the sky, saw green willows gently stroking the water's surface and suddenly felt a sense of inspiration.

Later, because the leg technique was a foundation, it was easy to learn and spread quickly. Improved and refined by different martial artists through generations, it has become a common leg technique.

"The green wind caresses the green willow, lightly touching the lake's surface."

The essence of this leg technique lies in the word "Light."

In the early stages of practice, the word "Light" is superficial. It means kicking while retaining strength, not using up all the force, so that one can be as continuous and smooth as the wind.

In the mid-stage of practice, the word "Light" deepens slightly, referring to "light legs," where the force penetrates the body's surface. In the late stage, it advances further, referring to "light body."

Li Xian practiced the leg technique and suddenly felt an epiphany. In a daze, it seemed as if he was stepping on the wind and snow, actually lifting several feet off the ground. He felt a sense of natural elegance and grace.

\[Qingfeng Leg\]

\[Proficiency: 4999/5000 Great Mastery\]

Li Xian swept his leg horizontally. The wind from the leg swept up the snowflakes, spiraling upwards, and finally fell down one by one.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Qingfeng Leg has advanced to Perfection\]

\[Proficiency: 1/10000 Perfection\]

The second "Perfection" level martial art was achieved today. Between his bones and flesh, Internal Qi rapidly grew, converging into his Dantian. It was vigorous and refined, like a lake or a sea.

Li Xian rolled up his trouser leg. He saw the muscles of his calf twitching, as if sore and painful. His bones and tendons seemed to be stretched and straightened, whipping repeatedly.

\[Description: You practiced tirelessly, your leg technique gradually grew, reaching perfection. You can achieve leaving no tracks in the snow, running with the wind, legs light as the wind, and grasping the mystery of the word "Light".\]

Suddenly, he saw a frozen fruit hanging on a tree. He jumped up, gently pinched it with his fingers, plucked it, and then floated down lightly.

His body was like a feather.

In mid-air, he executed Qingfeng Leg and actually managed to hover for several breaths.

It was extremely miraculous!

After Li Xian cycled his Qi through his body, he used his full strength to jump and could reach over three meters high. After grasping the mystery of "Light," on top of that foundation, he could jump another half meter higher.

And his leg strength had increased significantly.

"Someone like me, who has brought two basic martial arts to Perfection, is probably very rare."

The Qi in his Dantian became increasingly thick.

Li Xian manipulated his Internal Qi. The blood flow in his body seemed to solidify, and his breathing became long and steady. Qi permeated his entire body, and his tiny pores opened and closed...

After "Blood Solidification," naturally, he gradually touched the level of "Closing the Orifices."
