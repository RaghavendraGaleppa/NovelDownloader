# Chapter 42: Xiao Ji's Slight Misunderstanding About Foundation Establishment

**[Disguised as an Immortal Master: A Bear Demon in Disguise]**

"How bold," Xiao Ji thought as he observed the sedan chair's roof. "Parading openly into a human town in broad daylight under the guise of a disciple recruitment ceremony—this reeks of foul play."

Xiao Ji continued probing the demon's information without alerting it.

**[This is a Level 10 Bear Demon in disguise. Though not yet at shapeshifting stage, it has consumed Human Form Pills to maintain human appearance for several days.]**

**[The bear demon is coated with Human Aura Ointment and sprayed with Qi Suppressant (to prevent demonic aura leakage). Those below its cultivation level cannot detect its true nature.]**

**[Its purpose in Willow Town: abducting people under the pretense of disciple recruitment.]**

**[The sedan carriers and ceremonial attendants have been drugged with Soul-Dazing Soup, their actions no longer their own.]**

**[Deep Perception Obtained: Cultivation +9]**

Abducting people openly under the guise of recruitment was more despicable than human trafficking—it didn't even require spending money.

To ordinary folk, having their child noticed by an immortal sect was like their ancestors' graves emitting auspicious smoke—a divine blessing. Of course, this didn't include mundane sects dependent on townships, like the Original Divinity Temple.

Only families who couldn't afford three meals would consider sending children to such marginal places—not for cultivation, but simply to keep them fed. Everyone knew such places couldn't produce real cultivators, offering at most some physical conditioning.

Thus, public disciple recruitment by proper cultivation sects always caused a stir. Commoners rarely witnessed cultivators demonstrating their powers—someone spotting a sword-riding cultivator chasing demons could boast about it for months.

Town officials welcomed visits by genuine cultivators—in Xiao Ji's terms, it boosted local GDP and slightly improved feng shui. But there were always frauds posing as masters.

Clearly, Willow Town's administrators had been fooled, otherwise they wouldn't have allowed a bear demon entry. The demon was bold, composed, and highly skilled at deception.

In the ongoing human-demon conflict, human cultivators developed new artifacts and specialized techniques based on demonic traits. Meanwhile, intelligent demons constantly innovated their human-hunting methods, incorporating sophisticated strategies that often caught humans unprepared.

The scene before Xiao Ji illustrated this perfectly.

Soon, his attention shifted from the bear demon to himself. The nine cultivation points obtained from the demon, added to his previous 111, should have maxed out his Qi Refinement stage at 120 points.

"I should have advanced by now," Xiao Ji mused. Yet nothing happened—no steam, no torn clothes, not even fainting—standard advancement phenomena that would have been embarrassing in public, potentially ruining Original Divinity Temple's hard-won reputation.

Checking his status panel:

**[Name: Xiao Ji]**  
**[Age: 20]** (He'd recently celebrated quietly with homemade longevity noodles and two eggs)  
**[Affiliation: Original Divinity Temple]**  
**[Spiritual Roots: Intermittent, quantity variable]**  
**[Cultivation: Qi Refinement Layer 12 (120/120)]**  
**[Technique: "Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Purple Gold Art"]**  
**[Perception Range: 100 zhang]**  

His cultivation was maxed, yet his perception range hadn't increased—a first. Further inspection revealed:

**[You've reached Qi Refinement perfection. To advance to Foundation Establishment, you require a breakthrough package.]**

"So I do need assistance for major breakthroughs," Xiao Ji reasoned. "Makes sense—major realms shouldn't come too easily."

The package was surprisingly sparse:  
**[Foundation Establishment Pill & Foundation Establishment Liquid]**  

But obtaining them proved complex:  

**[Foundation Establishment Pill]** required:  
- 1 Bear Demon Gallbladder (Level 9-12)  
- 1 Carnivorous Mountain Flower Spirit  
- 300 Low-Grade Yellow Spirit Stones  
Plus auxiliary materials: 10 Illusory Mushrooms, 6 Scented Insects...  
All must be mashed together and refined in a Low-Grade Mystic cauldron for 49 days until pills turn glossy black.  

**[Foundation Establishment Liquid]** required:  
- 3 taels Spirit Snake Blood  
- 6 drops Mind-Condensing Dew  
- 2 jin ordinary water  
Mixed and stirred, then boiled in a Mystic-grade vessel using Level 9-12 Wood Demons as fuel for seven days and nights. After adding the pill, simmer for another 49 days before reducing to one bowl's worth.  

**[Add salt for better flavor.]**  

The process was daunting, requiring many unfamiliar ingredients. Just the direct costs totaled 300 spirit stones—nearly all Xiao Ji possessed—not counting auxiliary materials or the Mystic-grade vessel needed.  

"Quite the shopping list," Xiao Ji sighed. But for Foundation Establishment, no price was too high.  

Back on the street, the bear demon paraded arrogantly—a seasoned predator confident in its Level 10 strength. In towns without official demon suppressors, such demons were formidable; local constables stood little chance even with anti-demon tools.  

As the saying goes: "Fortune favors the bold." But people often forget the rest: "Fortune is sought in danger, but lost there too—gained one in ten attempts, lost nine." Recklessness wasn't advisable—Xiao Ji believed in acting only with 80% certainty.  

"Brother Bear Demon seems rather careless with his gallbladder," Xiao Ji mused, eyes gleaming as he envisioned the creature becoming part of his Foundation Establishment ingredients.
