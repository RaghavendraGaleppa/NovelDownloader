Chapter 464: The Contest of Endurance

Fulong Luohan gazed deeply into the Black Crow Pass, where the figures of demonic cultivators patrolling the city walls were as insignificant as ants. "…This child's fate is now tied to mine. I cannot kill him today, but we shall meet again in the next life."

As the final word fell, the dragon patterns on his neck faded completely, extinguishing like an ancient lamp running out of oil.

Chimu and Cihang exchanged a glance, understanding flashing in each other's eyes.

The Buddhist light surrounding Fulong Luohan gradually dimmed. The patterns that once coiled around his neck like golden dragons now lost all their brilliance, leaving his skin withered and wrinkled like the bark of an old tree.

This old Luohan, who had cultivated for nearly four hundred years, was decaying at a speed as swift as autumn leaves meeting frost, revealing the signs of a lamp burning out in an instant.

The vajra staff in Chimu Luohan's hand trembled slightly. Though his temperament was fierce, he understood the situation.

The reincarnation edicts of the Puchan Pure Land were always transmitted only to the individual involved.

Such matters concerning the secrets of samsara were not to be heard even by close relatives or fellow disciples.

Buddhism emphasizes "bearing one's own karma." Even if a Bodhisattva, in their compassion, bestows an edict, the recipient must face the green lamp alone and receive it with their innate Buddha-nature.

While a Luohan can reincarnate autonomously, having a Bodhisattva's edict provides a greater guarantee for the path of reincarnation.

A Bodhisattva's edict acts like a beacon in samsara, guiding the direction of reincarnation and allowing the cultivator to avoid lowly realms such as the animal realm.

For those with shallow merit and heavy karmic obstacles, a single edict is the key to being reborn as a human.

In the Puchan Pure Land, there are few, if any, monks with negative merit, but the situation within the Primordial Origin Sect is entirely different.

A True Lord's edict is a priceless treasure there, as it not only protects the process of reincarnation but also paves a smooth path for cultivation in the next life.

Demonic cultivators who have committed excessive slaughter and carry heavy karma often spare no expense, seeking only a single True Lord's edict to avoid falling into the evil realms.

"Senior Brother… I will personally guide you into the Dao in the next life."

Cihang Luohan's white eyebrows drooped, and the knuckles of his clasped hands turned slightly white.

He clearly saw specks of golden blood seeping from beneath Fulong Luohan's monk robes, a sign that his innate Buddhist essence was leaking.

The old Luohan was currently forcing his ailing body to drive them away because he feared the two would witness his withered state and inadvertently damage their own Buddhist hearts and cultivation.

The mountain wind rustled the prayer flags, as if urging them on.

Chimu Luohan suddenly plunged his vajra staff heavily into the rock, sending shattered stones flying, which stopped abruptly three inches before Fulong Luohan's monk shoes.

This was the Buddhist "Halting Step," signifying that they would not advance further.

Cihang understood the meaning and silently stepped back to Chimu's side. The two chanted the Rebirth Sutra in unison, their voices like the lingering resonance of a golden bell, echoing through the mountains three times before ceasing.

By the time the final verse of the sutra faded, a faint smile had appeared on Fulong Luohan's gaunt face.

He tremblingly raised his right hand, and a faint Buddhist light bloomed from his fingertip, drawing a Buddhist golden seal in the air.

The seal hung in the air for three breaths before scattering like fireflies.

This was the Buddhist "Departure" ritual.

Chimu and Cihang clasped their hands in a salute once more. When they turned, their monk robes billowed like clouds, and they never looked back.

Fulong Luohan watched the two figures disappear, his head drooping slightly.

His withered body stood silently on the mountaintop like an ancient pine, his turbid gaze fixed on the direction of Black Crow Pass.

One incense stick's worth of time later, the pass remained as silent as ever, with only the Yin evil energy surging upon the city walls.

The faint dragon patterns on his neck completely vanished. His Dharmakaya began to crack, and golden blood seeped through his monk robes, casting a desolate, beautiful glow under the setting sun.

"What a demonic sect…"

The old Luohan's hoarse voice was mixed with blood foam. Twenty years of patient waiting had not yielded a single flaw from his opponent.

He couldn't help but curse internally. If not for his dignity, Fulong Luohan would have shouted insults; the other party was simply too good at hiding.

Chimu and Cihang had already left, leaving him alone, yet Xu Yunfan still remained unresponsive.

The innate Buddhist light in his Niwan Palace was now like a candle in the wind.

If he did not receive a Bodhisattva's edict to guide him within three days, he would have to reincarnate immediately.

He had already undergone three cycles of reincarnation, and each time it became harder to awaken his past life's wisdom. Without a Bodhisattva's edict, it would be very difficult to awaken his past life's wisdom in this lifetime.

"Forget it…"

He could just start over in the next life. Once he returned to the True Lord position, he would find a way to kill that man.

The True Martial Subduing Demons Scripture was originally a Bodhisattva position decreed by the Wondrous Truth Bodhisattva, but the Primordial Origin Sect had snatched it first. He could only scheme slowly over time.

The old Luohan's sigh had not yet fallen when a piercing rainbow light suddenly erupted from his body.

The withered flesh and blood gradually faded within the rainbow light, leaving only a dragon-shaped golden shadow that shot through the sky. This was the "Rainbow Transformation Escape Method" secretly passed down by the Puchan Pure Land.

Although this technique could travel ten thousand miles in an instant, it burned his remaining innate Buddhist essence. He would not have taken such a risk unless driven to a dead end.

As the rainbow light crossed the sky, Xu Yunfan, who was inside his cave dwelling in Black Crow Pass, suddenly opened his eyes. The vertical mark on his brow opened slightly, emitting threads of flowing light.

With the Divine Eye of Martial Dao, he could naturally sense the disappearance of Fulong Luohan's aura.

The True Martial Sword trembled slightly in its scabbard, its blade reflecting the cold smile at the corner of his mouth. "Old bald donkey, you couldn't hold out in the end."

To try and lure me out was wishful thinking. He has finally been unable to endure it.

He will surely find a way to kill his reincarnated body later!

With this thought, Xu Yunfan slowly stood up, finally moving his buttocks from the meditation cushion he had sat on for nearly twenty years.

After stretching his muscles and bones, he was finally preparing to leave the cave dwelling to get some fresh air.

After twenty years of sitting silently in the cold pass, the three great divine arts within his body had reached perfection. The True Martial Subduing Demons Scripture was also mastered to the point where he could use both the positive and negative aspects properly. Now, he only needed the final trace of Heavenly and Earthly Evil Energy to step into the mid Foundation Establishment realm.

As a Foundation Establishment True Lord, using the method of projecting his consciousness, Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense could now reflect the aura within a radius of ten thousand miles.

At this moment, he closed his eyes and focused. The Divine Eye of Martial Dao in his Niwan Palace opened slightly, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth within a thirty-foot radius of his body rippled like waves.

The distinct Clear and Turbid Qi unique to the Taihua Spirit Ruin World flowed around him, resonating with the three great divine arts in his body, forming a subtle harmony.

He lightly pinched a hand seal with his fingertips, and his spiritual sense spread out like a spider web.

The unique spiritual intuition of a Foundation Establishment cultivator allowed him to clearly perceive all the aura fluctuations within this world that were compatible with his own Dao Foundation.

Those faint牵引 forces were the guidance of heaven and earth to the cultivator. At this level of cultivation, as long as he was not blinded by heavenly secrets or obstructed by others from interfering with karma, he would have an innate sense of opportunity.

"The intersection of the northern continent's earth veins has three locations with Heavenly and Earthly Evil Energy."

Xu Yunfan silently recited the results of his deduction. Wherever his spiritual sense passed, the trends of mountains and rivers and the flow of earth veins were as clear as lines on his palm.

The unique "Heaven-Man Resonance" of a Foundation Establishment cultivator was fully displayed at this moment, allowing him to clearly distinguish the positions of Heavenly and Earthly Evil Energy most suitable for his own Dao Foundation.

Suddenly, he frowned slightly.

He closed his eyes and focused, the Divine Eye of Martial Dao on his brow opened slightly, and his spiritual sense spread out like ripples, deducing the location of the opportunity in the void.

"Eh?"

The map of the Heavenly and Earthly Evil Energy in the northern continent, which should have appeared in his deduction, was now like looking at flowers through fog.

There was no Heavenly and Earthly Evil Energy that matched the True Martial Subduing Demons Scripture?

Xu Yunfan realized instantly. There was no Heavenly and Earthly Evil Energy he needed in this Taihua Spirit Ruin World. If he wanted to continue cultivating the True Martial Subduing Demons Scripture, he would likely need to enter the Divine Martial World again to search for it.
