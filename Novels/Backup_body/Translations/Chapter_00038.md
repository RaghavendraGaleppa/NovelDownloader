# Chapter 38: Yuan Zhengfeng's Past!

By the side of Yuan Zhengfeng's coffin, Li Zhengjing stood motionless, frozen in place.  

Seeing this, Gao Changhe stepped forward to console him. Noticing Li Zhengjing's pale and slightly greenish complexion, he sighed and patted his shoulder. "Don't be too grieved," he said.  

"If Elder Yuan could see how outstanding you've become, he would surely be overjoyed in the afterlife," Xie Changqing added, also moved by the sight.  

This young man was so heartbroken upon seeing Elder Yuan's remains that he seemed lost in sorrow—truly a man of deep sentiment.  

"..."  

Li Zhengjing's cheek twitched slightly.  

If only Elder Yuan were truly in the afterlife.  

But now, it seemed he wasn't in the underworld—he was inside this fragmented jade disc.  

His thoughts raced as he glanced at the golden page in his mind. For a moment, he considered ignoring it and letting the jade disc be buried along with Yuan Zhengfeng's remains, sealed beneath the earth.  

Yet an uneasy feeling rose within him.  

The guidance of the golden page could never be wrong!  

After a pause, he reached into the coffin and retrieved the fragmented jade disc.  

"Elder Gao, I'd like to keep this piece of jade," Li Zhengjing said, lifting his head.  

"That appears to be a fragment of a treasure, but it's already broken and useless. The Public Affairs Hall has already returned it to you," Gao Changhe sighed. "What use is keeping such a broken item?"  

"Elder Yuan is being buried here today. This is the last time I'll see him," Li Zhengjing said wistfully. "I'd like to keep a memento of his, something to remember him by."  

"Grieving over objects only deepens sorrow," Xie Changqing remarked, though he couldn't help but add, "But you're a sentimental person. If you wish to keep it as a keepsake, then do so."  

"Very well. His belongings were meant to be inherited by you anyway. How you handle them is your decision," Gao Changhe said with a slight shake of his head, making no further objections.  

Li Zhengjing then placed the fragmented jade disc inside his robes and glanced again at the golden page.  

The line regarding his fortune remained unchanged.  

Clearly, this jade disc posed no immediate threat to his life.  

But whether it would be useful to him in the future remained uncertain.  

The coffin was then sealed and buried, incense was burned, and the final rites for Elder Yuan Zhengfeng were completed.  

"Traditionally, there should be a banquet tonight, but Elder Yuan had no close friends in the sect. At most, it would just be the three of us," Gao Changhe said.  

"Besides, he didn't just pass away—we've known of his death for some time now. Today was only about bringing his remains back. Since the Peak Master gave no instructions, let's keep things simple."  

The three agreed and soon went their separate ways.  

As Li Zhengjing walked away, he could feel the weight of the jade disc against his chest, his mind swirling with thoughts.  

"Elder Yuan Zhengfeng—is he alive or dead?"  

"Can he be considered alive within this jade disc?"  

"Is there a chance he might awaken and return?"  

"If he is alive... that would be utterly shocking!"  

"Even those who have transcended mortality—Human Immortals—cannot survive after their physical bodies perish. How did he manage it?"  

Lost in these thoughts, Li Zhengjing murmured softly, "Elder Yuan, can you respond?"  

The jade disc remained silent.  

Sighing, he decided to set the matter aside for now.  

Upon returning to his inner sect residence, it wasn't long before the fake elixir peddler arrived, delivering five spirit cauldrons.  

"These five spirit cauldrons are different from before," Li Zhengjing remarked, surprised.  

He noticed that the low-grade spirit stones embedded in them contained purer spiritual energy than usual.  

"Senior Brother must know that even low-grade spirit stones come in different qualities," the peddler explained.  

"Most are impure, their spiritual energy muddled. But a rare few are actually fragments of mid-grade spirit stones—scraps from mining or cutting, irregular in shape and low in spiritual energy..."  

For high-ranking cultivators, such stones were neither useful enough to keep nor wasteful enough to discard—a true dilemma.  

Yet in alchemy, artifact forging, talisman crafting, formation setting, and beast taming, their effectiveness was no different from ordinary low-grade spirit stones.  

Thus, they were still classified as low-grade—just a rarer, higher-quality variant.  

"Upon hearing that Elder Yuan Zhengfeng's remains had returned to the mountain today, I figured Senior Brother might be feeling down. I thought a little surprise might help ease your sorrow."  

The peddler spread his hands. "Spirit cauldrons embedded with mid-grade stones are already considered magic artifacts—something beyond my reach for now. But these low-grade ones? I can manage."  

"You're quite thoughtful," Li Zhengjing praised, pleased. Then he added, "What about the information on Elder Yuan Zhengfeng? Did you find anything?"  

"Indeed. It's all here."  

The peddler reached into his robes and handed over a scroll.  

Li Zhengjing didn't shortchange him, paying an extra hundred taels of silver.  

The peddler left in high spirits, though not before casting a seemingly casual glance at Li Zhengjing's chest. With a smile, he waved and departed.  

Once the courtyard gate was closed, Li Zhengjing sat down and began reading the records of Yuan Zhengfeng's life.  

**Yuan Zhengfeng** – Upper-level Qi Refinement cultivator, inner elder of the Ancient Moon Peak under the Feather Immortal Sect.  

Standing over eight feet tall, he was powerfully built, with exceptional bone structure.  

Once hailed as the strongest in the Feather Immortal Sect's outer sect!  

After mastering external martial arts to their peak, his blood and qi surged like a tempest. His fists were like giant fans, and his punches carried the force of blades—capable of shattering stone slabs into rubble!  

It was said that at the height of his external cultivation, even early-stage internal energy practitioners treated him with respect!  

Later, after cultivating internal energy, he became renowned within the inner sect.  

By the time he reached the peak of internal energy cultivation, his formidable physique and mastery of heavy swords allowed him to hold his own against Qi Refinement elders for a hundred exchanges without defeat!  

Yet as time passed, he gradually faded into mediocrity.  

At fifty, he finally broke through to the Qi Refinement stage, unlocking his acupoints and earning the title of True Disciple.  

At this level, cultivation focused on refining Qi, and his once-vaunted physical strength became far less significant.  

Yuan Zhengfeng's progress in Qi Refinement was unremarkable. By sixty, he had barely advanced to the mid-tier of the Qi Refinement stage.  

That same year, having crossed the age threshold, he was stripped of his True Disciple status and reassigned as an inner elder.  

From then on, he no longer stood out, his brilliance dimming as the years passed.  

Twenty years ago, he broke through to the upper tier of Qi Refinement. The following year, he left the mountain to seek opportunities in the wider world.  

Three years ago, his life flame within the sect's Qi Lamp Hall extinguished.  

Yuan Zhengfeng had fallen, his path of cultivation cut short at the age of eighty-two.  

"Once hailed as the strongest in the outer sect, a legend in the internal energy stage... yet in Qi Refinement, he became ordinary, lost among the masses..."  

Li Zhengjing sighed, his gaze drifting to the final lines—where he finally understood why Elder Yuan Zhengfeng had made so many enemies in the sect and almost no friends.
