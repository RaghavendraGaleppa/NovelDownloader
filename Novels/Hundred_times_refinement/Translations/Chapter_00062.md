# Chapter 12: The Mysterious Light Points

Lin Xuan shifted his gaze to the remaining books and continued his search. After a while, he stopped and pulled out a black-bound volume from the shelf. Large characters on its cover read *Records of Cultivation Anomalies*.  

Skimming through it, he found it was a cultivator's journal—not containing any cultivation techniques, but rather documenting the author's travels and anecdotes from various places.  

This entire shelf held similar books. Perhaps some clues could be found here. Lin Xuan carefully sifted through them and selected two more: *Strange Tales of the Nine Provinces* and *Legends of Gods and Ghosts*.  

Three books were the maximum a low-ranking disciple like him could borrow. After completing the formalities, Lin Xuan carried them back to his room, sat down, and began poring over them intently.  

As the sun set, painting the sky with golden hues, Lin Xuan finally finished reading all three books, rubbing his sore neck and dry eyes. The strange tales and legends within had broadened his horizons, yet there was still no trace of information about the blue starry sea inside his body.  

The books did recount many fortuitous encounters from the immortal realm. For instance, two thousand years ago, the Flying Crane True Man consumed a Mystic Heaven Ice Fruit atop the northernmost peak, which granted him divine assistance in mastering water-attribute arts. He later became a revered grandmaster and founded the Tian Shan Sect.  

Another tale spoke of the Demon Path's infamous Ghost Corpse Sovereign, who was bitten by a strange serpent in his youth. Instead of succumbing to the venom, he gained immense benefits—his techniques thereafter carried the serpent's deadly poison, making him nearly invincible.  

And then there were...  

While the books detailed many such encounters, not all were blessings. Far more cultivators had perished from consuming bizarre fruits or encountering venomous beasts.  

In other words, these encounters were double-edged swords. Whether one reaped benefits or met with disaster depended entirely on luck.  

Lin Xuan, however, wasn't worried about this. Zhou Yan's act of killing his master proved that the seashell was a beneficial treasure. His current frustration lay in figuring out how to use it—unfortunately, the books contained no mention of the blue starry sea.  

It seemed he would have to rely on his own exploration.  

Lin Xuan sat cross-legged and activated his inner vision once more. The starry sea in his dantian remained unchanged, distinct from his spiritual energy and unaffected by it.  

After observing it with his spiritual sense for about half an hour, he decided to take a risk. Using his sect's cultivation method, he attempted to gather the blue light points forming the starry sea, just as he would with spiritual energy.  

---  

The process was perilous. The blue light was an unknown entity, and the dantian was the foundation of a cultivator. A single misstep could invite disaster.  

Yet, nothing ventured, nothing gained. If he wanted rewards, he had to take risks. Moreover, after careful observation, Lin Xuan felt reasonably confident. He was never one to act rashly—this experiment was the result of meticulous deliberation.  

Soon, beads of sweat formed on his forehead. Compared to spiritual energy, the blue light points were far harder to control. But Lin Xuan had anticipated difficulties. He remained calm and persistent, methodically working through the challenge. After repeated attempts, the blue points finally coalesced.  

Wisps of white vapor rose from Lin Xuan's head as he struggled to manipulate the light like spiritual energy. The process was excruciating—every movement of the blue light felt sluggish and unyielding. Fortunately, no adverse effects manifested.  

He pressed on.  

Time passed...  

"Hmm?" Lin Xuan's brows lifted slightly as a flicker of surprise crossed his composed face. When the light points traveled through his meridians to his right palm, instead of cycling back to his dantian like spiritual energy, they escaped his body.  

Though he had considered various possibilities beforehand, this outcome still caught him off guard.  

Unexpected, but Lin Xuan remained unfazed. He halted his cultivation and slowly opened his eyes. Sure enough, clusters of blue light points hovered before his chest, identical to those in his dantian.  

He reached out to touch them, feeling a warmth akin to sunlight. Yet, he couldn't reabsorb them. After a while, the light dimmed and eventually vanished.  

Sitting cross-legged again, Lin Xuan used his inner vision to inspect his dantian. The starry sea had shrunk slightly.  

Lying on his bed, he pondered. His deduction seemed correct—the light points could circulate like spiritual energy. But why were they expelled at his palm? Further study was needed.  

After analyzing the day's findings, exhaustion set in. Manipulating the light points through his meridians was more taxing than nine full cultivation cycles. Only someone as tenacious as Lin Xuan could have endured it.  

---  

The crow of a rooster heralded dawn.  

Awakening refreshed, Lin Xuan didn't head to the training hall as usual. Instead, he sat cross-legged on his bed. Yesterday's progress had been significant, and he was determined to continue his experiments.  

Activating his inner vision once more, a faint smile touched his lips. The state of his dantian matched his expectations.  

After losing some light points the previous day, the starry sea had diminished. But now, after a night's rest, it had fully replenished.  

Lin Xuan had theorized that since the light points had merged with his body, they shouldn't be a one-time resource. If consumed, they ought to recover somehow—otherwise, Zhou Yan wouldn't have prized the seashell so highly.  

Though confident in his hypothesis, it had remained unproven until this morning's discovery, which finally put his mind at ease.  

Better yet, the replenishment required no special conditions. The light points had seemingly become part of his body, much like physical strength—depleted energy could be restored naturally with rest.  

No longer fearing exhaustion of the light points was another breakthrough in Lin Xuan's exploration. Now, the pressing task was uncovering their purpose.
