Chapter 100: Blasphemous Words

"Just give them this piece of cloth to save them?"

Zhou Tian squinted at the blood-colored silk cloth in Anduin's hand, wondering how a single drop of blood could stain so much of it.

"Precisely. This cloth carries a wisp of divine blood. My believers will naturally find you by following this scent."

"And then you can get out?"

Anduin shook his head. "I have my own methods, of course."

It seemed he was unwilling to elaborate, but Zhou Tian didn't mind. Even partners couldn't reveal all their trump cards.

"Then what do I get?"

"Didn't you also get out?" Anduin countered.

Zhou Tian shook his head. "Not enough. Even without your help, I have ways to get out."

Anduin frowned, unsure whether to believe him. After a moment, he spoke, "What else do you want?"

A smile appeared on Zhou Tian's face as he pointed out all the people from Jiuzhou. "I want you to rescue all of them!"

This included even those bald monks. After all, they were all people from Jiuzhou. Those two seniors abandoning them back then must have been a last resort. If there was a chance, Zhou Tian didn't mind saving them.

"No, too many people. The Holy God Cult isn't made of fools; they have their own trump cards. It would be very difficult to save so many." Anduin flatly refused. There were more than a dozen people in total, which would heavily drag him down. If he were that powerful, he wouldn't have fallen into the Holy God Cult's hands in the first place.

"Alright then, you must save these two people. As for the others, save as many as you can." Zhou Tian shrugged, pointing to Mu Su and Zhang Yi. As for the bald ones, he could only offer his apologies; he couldn't be blamed for not helping them in their dire straits.

"That can be arranged." Anduin nodded. He was confident he could manage two people.

"When can we start?"

With the private deal struck, Anduin asked, eager to begin. He had been trapped here for some time.

"Whenever." Zhou Tian said indifferently. He had nothing to prepare. Plans often couldn't keep up with changes. In fact, he had originally prepared a comprehensive plan, and his purpose in coming here was to coordinate with Zhang Yi.

But he hadn't expected to suffer a Waterloo right at the start. Mu Su had somehow gotten unreliable information, and Zhou Tian still couldn't pinpoint the location of this Inquisition. He feared that if he teleported randomly, he might end up behind a wall in a spatial turbulence, which would truly be "game over." He would be trapped there forever, so he didn't dare to try it easily.

However, unexpectedly, a new path emerged, as he encountered Anduin, a Divine Son. This seemed quite promising and looked like it would save Zhou Tian a lot of trouble.

"Good, let's start now. But, my friend, there's one thing I must emphasize," Anduin's expression turned serious. "Friend, in this place, all transcendent power is sealed. Although, due to the peculiar nature of divinity, it can be barely utilized, my mastery of divinity is not pure, nor can I forge any contracts. The agreement between us is fragile. If you uphold your promise, I will spare no effort to fulfill your demands!"

"Don't worry, I'm a man of my word." Zhou Tian patted his chest.

Their collaboration had its pros and cons. Zhou Tian had the initiative in getting out himself, but once he handed the blood-stained silk to the other party, the initiative would shift. Hence, their verbal agreement was truly fragile.

However, Zhou Tian didn't plan to break the contract, nor was he particularly afraid of Anduin breaking it. At worst, he could turn traitor and assist the Holy God Cult. He didn't believe that with fifteen chances for attack reflection, plus his [Blazing Burst] and the Holy God Cult's power, they couldn't deal with a mere Divine Son.

"Good, come here and take the blood-stained silk." Anduin nodded, motioning for Zhou Tian to come and get the item.

Zhou Tian's figure flickered, appearing inside Anduin's cage. The moment he appeared, Anduin exclaimed in surprise, "You have no divinity on you? You are not a god!"

Earlier, separated by two layers of cells, he hadn't sensed it. But now that Zhou Tian was right in front of him, he could clearly perceive that Zhou Tian didn't possess a single trace of divinity.

"I'm not, I'm from... oh... I said that was a joke, don't pay too much attention to details." Zhou Tian waved his hand, taking the blood-stained silk from Anduin. It didn't feel damp from being soaked in blood; instead, it had a smooth, silky texture, and a warm, comfortable sensation welled up in his heart.

Anduin's eyes grew even more curious. Lava-like cracks appeared in his pupils, glowing intensely red. This was power augmented by divinity, as he probed Zhou Tian's body.

No matter how he looked, Zhou Tian showed no sign of transcendent power. It wasn't due to the cage's suppression, but because he inherently had none.

However, Anduin understood that this concerned Zhou Tian's secrets. Asking would be pointless, so he saw no need to speak.

The moment Zhou Tian looked up, the red light in Anduin's eyes dissipated.

"Why do I feel like some pervert is peeking at me?" Zhou Tian muttered under his breath.

Anduin's mouth twitched, but he didn't respond.

"Wait for me a moment, I need to explain something." Zhou Tian asked Anduin to wait, then flashed to Zhang Yi's cell.

Zhou Tian briefly explained the deal he had just made with Anduin to Zhang Yi. Only Anduin could hear and transmit sounds through the seal; others could not.

Zhang Yi listened and nodded. "I've seen records of this Ashen Lord. He was a powerful deity in the ancient divine realm, but he didn't establish a pantheon and doesn't belong to the scheming and treacherous lineage. He should be trustworthy."

"When the time comes, act according to the situation. Keep an eye on Mu Su; I owe him this much." Zhou Tian didn't give too many further instructions; Zhang Yi wasn't a novice.

Zhang Yi indicated his understanding.

Zhou Tian then flashed into Mu Su's cage. Zhou Tian's previous conversation with Anduin had taken place inside his (Mu Su's) cage, so he didn't need to explain too much.

"Mu Su, you're here because of me. Don't worry, I will definitely get you out."

"..." Mu Su's face displayed a complex array of emotions, which Zhou Tian found utterly speechless. A grown man acting like a resentful woman trapped in her chambers. Zhou Tian said no more, returned to his own cell, and signaled to Anduin that they could begin.

Anduin nodded, exhaled, and positioned his hands in a very strange posture before his chest. A faint golden light emanated from him, and an extremely blurry figure appeared behind him. It was immensely tall, almost touching the ceiling of the cage.

The figure was predominantly reddish, with a pair of broad wings like flowing lava extending to their tips. Its head bore two thick purple horns. The specific details were hard to discern.

Although the figure felt somewhat evil, Zhou Tian actually sensed a sacred aura from it.

Anduin's lips moved, but no sound was transmitted. White flames ignited in the nearby cells. All the imprisoned beings, except for the people from Jiuzhou, clutched their heads and slammed into their cage walls, seemingly in extreme agony.
