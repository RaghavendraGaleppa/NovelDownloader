# Chapter 619: Sword One – Piercing Illusion

He looked at the expression on Xu Yunfan’s face—one that said, *So that’s it, you’re just a thief too*—and the killing intent in his eyes was no longer concealed.

Xu Yunfan’s demeanor made him feel that continuing the act was meaningless.

“Good, very good!”

The faint immortal aura between Qingyuan True Lord’s eyebrows was instantly replaced by a chilling, murderous intent. The warmth vanished completely from his eyes, and he no longer bothered to refer to himself as ‘This Sovereign.’ “You are correct. This time, I, Qingyuan True Lord, owe you.”

He looked at Xu Yunfan indifferently, his gaze like that of someone shooing away a beggar.

“Once I personally ‘send’ you into the cycle of reincarnation, in your next life, I will personally guide you back onto the path of cultivation. How about that?”

The words had barely left his mouth; the lingering tone of the final syllable hadn’t even faded yet.

A sudden change occurred!

A sword light burst forth brilliantly from Xu Yunfan’s magical body.

Without warning, without any discernible trajectory, it was a sword light that seemed to pierce the boundary of reality from the void itself.

It was utterly unadorned, possessing only the purest form of *Piercing Illusion*, a will that approached the truth and stripped away all disguises.

Sword One – Piercing Illusion!

Qingyuan True Lord’s expression changed drastically.

“Pure Yang True Lord?!”

Xu Yunfan remained silent, merely unleashing the full force of the Piercing Illusion Sword Intent.

The sword intent did not attack Qingyuan True Lord’s protective immortal palace pure qi, nor did it directly pierce his physical vital points.

This Golden Core sword intent, personally refined by the Ancestor of Pure Yang, Lü Chunyang, under Xu Yunfan’s long-gathered mental activation, had an incredibly precise target.

It struck directly at the final spiritual link Qingyuan True Lord was using to silently obliterate Xu Yunfan with his soul power.

The words “send you into the cycle of reincarnation” had not yet dissipated, but the invisible, fatal strike of “killing with a single glance” was already severed in half by the Ancestor of Pure Yang’s “Sword One – Piercing Illusion.”

“Pure Yang!!!”

A roar of disbelief erupted for the first time from Qingyuan True Lord’s mouth.

The blood drained instantly from his ancient, unadorned face, replaced by shock and fury.

He never imagined that Lü Chunyang would value this tiny Foundation Establishment cultivator so highly, not only bestowing a life-protecting sword intent but also granting it such a powerful self-counterattack capability.

And this first sword had precisely shattered his prideful, invisible technique of spiritual annihilation, tearing away the pure qi of his immortal palace along with it.

In the blink of an eye, just as the Piercing Illusion Sword Intent was about to cut into the core of his consciousness, Qingyuan True Lord had no time to spare for anything else.

He clapped his hands together in front of him and drew them apart.

*Boom!*

The vast immortal palace pure qi flared brightly.

The entire sky above the East Sea seemed to be instantly pulled into another dimension.

Infinite Kunlun pure qi condensed into layer upon layer of magnificent jade pavilions and palaces, jade steps and terraces, as thick and heavy as walls forged from ancient, dark iron. It was vast, solemn, and sacred.

This was the manifestation of his Golden Core Dao Domain, the Qingyuan Immortal Palace.

In an instant, the pure white, flawless sword light that could pierce through all illusions and obstacles crashed violently into this world formed of immortal palace pure qi.

There was no earth-shattering explosion, only a sharp, soul-piercing sound of annihilation.

*Screech!*

The moment the Piercing Illusion Sword Intent came into contact with the immortal palace pure qi, countless seemingly unbreakable hall illusions, talisman seeds, and法则 chains dissolved and collapsed silently, like snowflakes falling onto a scorching hot blade.

The characteristic of the Piercing Illusion Sword Intent was pushed to the extreme here, specifically targeting all illusory obstacles. No matter how grand the obstacle, if its foundation originated from the evolution of pure qi, its core was ultimately a combined form of energy and laws.

Xu Yunfan saw clearly that the aura of the Piercing Illusion Sword Intent was being worn down and consumed as it broke through Qingyuan True Lord’s immortal palace.

Though the sword light was weakened layer by layer, its momentum was not exhausted.

The piercing will, sharp enough to penetrate anything, forcibly bored a cone-shaped tunnel through the ocean of barriers formed by the immortal palace pure qi.

The immortal palace pure qi churned violently, its light flickering, emitting groans of unbearable strain that shook the entire East Sea.

Finally, the sword light exhausted its last vestige of power and dissipated just a foot away from Qingyuan True Lord’s brow.

The sword energy dissipated.

The vast immortal palace pure qi contracted rapidly, once again enveloping Qingyuan True Lord.

His face was so dark it seemed to drip water, his eyes filled with killing intent as he stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan. The lofty, transcendent immortal aura was completely gone.

What enraged him even more was the sound.

*Crack!*

*Hiss!*

The protective pure qi barrier surrounding him, which was usually strong enough to withstand a full-force blow from a fellow Golden Core cultivator, was now silently disintegrating. It flickered like a dying candle in the wind before finally turning into specks of light and vanishing completely.

That single Sword One – Piercing Illusion, though ultimately blocked by the immortal palace pure qi he had summoned through his Dao Fruit, had completely shattered his permanent protective barrier. He tried to restore it but found a sword intent clinging to him like a附骨之蛆 (a grub stuck to the bone), constantly blocking the recovery.

The scene fell into a deathly silence.

Xu Yunfan held the Star Spirit Banner, with Ye Xuan immobilized by his side. His chest heaved violently. To withstand a direct blow from a True Lord, even if it was just passive defense, the soul tremble brought by the difference in status made him want to vomit blood.

But thankfully, the Ancestor of Pure Yang was reliable.

The combat results brought by this sword intent exceeded his imagination.

This is the power of a Golden Core Sword Cultivator.

Now, one of his three life-saving sword intents was gone.

But Xu Yunfan did not regret it.

Qingyuan True Lord stood in mid-air, his protective pure qi completely gone. The hem of his luxurious Dao robe was torn in several places by the residual sword energy.

The shock and fury in his eyes burned like tangible flames, locking onto Xu Yunfan, the killing intent almost condensing into ice spikes.

But he did not attack again immediately.

The power of Sword One and the imprint of Lü Chunyang’s signature aura made him extremely wary.

A thousand years ago, every time the Pure Yang True Lord fought against a True Lord of the same level, he would unleash three swords: one to pierce illusion, one to calamity-destroy, and one to no-return.

These three sword styles had left many True Lords under the great tribulation severely injured.

He could naturally sense that there were still two equally dangerous auras faintly waiting to be unleashed from Xu Yunfan’s sleeve.

Sword Two – Calamity-Destroy?

Or Sword Three – No-Return?

Even for him, taking two more sword intents head-on would be far from pleasant.

As a early Golden Core cultivator, taking them head-on would likely damage his immortal palace.

More importantly, although the qi in this East Sea region was chaotic, the commotion caused by his earlier mobilization of a vast amount of immortal palace pure qi to block Sword One was far greater than before.

Would Pudu True Lord, or even people from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, sense it?

Would they track the traces and investigate?

Suppressing his boiling killing intent, Qingyuan True Lord stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan, his gaze icy cold, as if trying to carve Xu Yunfan’s appearance into the depths of his soul. “Xu Yunfan… you are good! Very good!”

Every word seemed to be squeezed out from between his teeth, filled with deep-seated hatred. “I have remembered today’s matter!”

With that, he gave Xu Yunfan one last, deep look. The gaze was complex and hard to read, filled with hatred, anger, wariness, and a hint of imperceptible solemnity.

Then, his figure suddenly faded and dissipated like ink blending into water, leaving no spatial fluctuations behind, vanishing silently from the spot.

It was as if he had never appeared at all, leaving only the even more chaotic and shattered void of the East Sea, the thick, lingering aura of a Golden Core, and the chilling Dao rhyme after the shattering of the immortal palace pure qi.

The heavy pressure vanished abruptly.

Xu Yunfan’s body swayed, almost falling from mid-air.

He forcefully swallowed the fishy sweetness in his throat, gasping for breath, his back already soaked in cold sweat.

However, just as he let out a sigh of relief, a white jade palm suddenly appeared behind his head, fingers spread, pressing down toward him.
