# Chapter 2: Following Heaven is Easy, Defying Heaven is Hard

To cultivate, or not to cultivate, that was a truly vexing question.

However, Lu Yang's dilemma quickly vanished.

Because he had no power to refuse. In broad daylight, under the clear sky, Yu Suzhen directly made her move!
Alas, Lu Yang's current body was already suffering from depleted essence and was terminally ill, his will far exceeding his strength.

"What a waste."

Seeing this, Yu Suzhen cursed impatiently, "You have such a beautiful face, yet so little essence."

As her words fell, Lu Yang's face instantly turned pale.

Following this, he discovered that his meager remaining essence was flowing into Yu Suzhen's body, and his already frail physique became even more emaciated.

"The Yin-Yang Grand Joyful Rhapsody?"

The cultivation method distributed during the allocation flashed through his mind, and Lu Yang suddenly understood: the so-called test of the Joyful Union Palace was likely to have registered disciples compete against each other through the Yin-Yang Grand Joyful Rhapsody, like a Gu-raising ritual. Only those who survived to the end could be promoted to formal disciples.

"Congratulations, Senior Sister Yu!"

At the same time, several registered disciples approached, their faces fawning, "With the last person's essence plundered, Senior Sister should be able to begin Qi Refinement."

"Once Qi Refined, no longer mortal!"

"Please take care of us in the future, Senior Sister. We are willing to serve you diligently..."

Watching this scene, Lu Yang suddenly laughed.

"Heh heh..."

A depleted, useless dreg of a person suddenly laughing immediately drew everyone's attention. Yu Suzhen glanced at Lu Yang, then said indifferently:

"Why are you laughing, Junior Brother?"

"I am laughing for Senior Sister," Lu Yang said sincerely. "I was worried about Senior Sister's health, but now it seems I was worrying needlessly."

"Worried about my health?" Yu Suzhen was startled.

"Yes." At this point, Lu Yang sighed with emotion, "Before I entered the sect, Junior Brother here suffered from a severe illness. Senior Sister was too hasty just now, and I didn't have time to mention it. But since Senior Sister is about to enter Qi Refinement, I'm sure a small illness like mine won't be a problem for you."

Yu Suzhen: "..."

[The enraged Yu Suzhen killed you.]

[Current remaining pages of the Myriad Lives Scroll: 99]

[Restarting a life, you can choose one of the following gains from your previous life:
One: Treasure.
Two: Cultivation.
Three: Lifespan.
Four: Forfeit all gains and randomly awaken a talent based on your previous life's experience.]

"Those whose names are called, step forward."

Lu Yang opened his eyes and looked at the black-robed Daoist on the platform, realizing that he was back at the allocation square when he first entered the Primeval Saint Sect.

Although the previous experience had been undeniably real, and the taste of the demonic woman was still vivid, now he was starting all over again, all past events like a phantom dream. This huge contrast left Lu Yang stunned for a while before he recovered, feeling both感慨 (deep emotion/reflection) and secretly delighted. His Myriad Lives Scroll was indeed a miraculous treasure!

Steadying his mind, Lu Yang lowered his gaze to the Myriad Lives Scroll's options.

He skipped the first three options. After all, he was plundered of his essence and died by Yu Suzhen before he even began formal cultivation. The only viable choice was the fourth one.

[Calculating your previous life's experience...]

[After plundering your essence, Yu Suzhen broke through to the Qi Refinement Realm. However, she contracted a severe illness, her true qi difficult to purge, and was bedridden for several months before succumbing to her illness and dying.]

[From ancient times, following Heaven is easy, defying Heaven is hard.]

[Martial arts are no match for divine abilities, and the gap between mortals and cultivators is even greater than the difference between heaven and earth.]

[Yet, you willingly entered the situation, skillfully employed heterodox arts, and, as a mortal, slew a cultivator. This can be called 'winning half a move against Heaven,' for an act of defiance could be no more!]

[You have awakened the White Talent: Heterodox Prodigy.]

[Heterodox Prodigy: Your comprehension of heterodox cultivation methods is exceptionally high. No cultivator of the same realm can plunder you.]

Following this, the illuminated text on the panel changed again.

[Name: Lu Yang]
[Age: 18]
[Cultivation: None]
[Talent: Heterodox Prodigy (White)]
[Cultivation Method: Yin-Yang Grand Joyful Rhapsody (入門 -入門: Introductory/Entry-level)]
[Divine Abilities: None]
[Treasures: None]
[Myriad Lives Scroll Pages: 99]

Lu Yang exhaled deeply, feeling a surge of qi and blood rush straight to his Dantian. Instantly, his strength was complete, full of vigor, and his originally weak body gradually recovered.

"This illness... it doesn't seem to be completely gone, but I can last longer now."

Lu Yang carefully sensed his state.

Aside from the physical recovery brought by his talent, Lu Yang also gained significant insight into the Yin-Yang Grand Joyful Rhapsody, the cultivation method distributed by the Joyful Union Palace.

After all, practical experience was more important than pure theory, especially with the added talent bonus.

Thereafter, everything unfolded without change.

Due to his naturally handsome face, Lu Yang was still assigned to the Joyful Union Palace, and still met Yu Suzhen at the entrance, instantly catching her eye.

However, this time Lu Yang no longer resisted.

The next second, Lu Yang felt his essence, qi, and spirit merge with that single strand of primal qi, then a thunderous tremor, as if an invisible gate had been thrown open.

Lu Yang instantly felt enlightened: "I've broken through!"

When spirit and qi merge, it is called "Qi Refinement"!

Yu Suzhen, as a veteran registered disciple of the Joyful Union Palace, was only one step away from Qi Refinement.

In the previous life, she had drained him to complete that last step, successfully reaching Qi Refinement. This life, however, she was counter-attacked by him, and all her accumulated power benefited him instead.

From today onwards, he was a cultivator at the first layer of Qi Refinement!

Breaking through in one fell swoop, being promoted to a formal disciple, was akin to a sudden leap to heaven in status. Though it seemed simple, it had blocked countless registered disciples for untold years.

"How delightful, Senior Sister Yu. I will probably never forget you in this life."

Lu Yang stood up, looking at the now lifeless Yu Suzhen on the ground, and couldn't help but sigh with emotion.
