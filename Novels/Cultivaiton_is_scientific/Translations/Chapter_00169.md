# Chapter 169: Encountering Immortals

Li Shimin applied a 'Primary Lightness Talisman' to himself—more for show than anything else. Given his physical cultivation level, his natural speed already surpassed the effects of the talisman. 

This was purely for appearances. Since he knew nothing about this land, if he encountered other cultivators, the faint green glow around his legs might mislead them about his true abilities. 

He harbored deep reservations about the North Shu Continent. Until he became thoroughly familiar with the region, he intended to keep a low profile. 

After traveling about a hundred li from the coast, the scenery ahead became clearly visible. His persistent navigation over the past days had been correct—he had indeed reached North Shu. 

By comparing the distant mountain ranges with the map provided by Yun Xingyi, he pinpointed his current location. 

His spiritual sense traced the jade slip's map, searching ahead for landmarks. Yun Xingyi's map only covered the Ten Thousand Mountains and the North Sea. Moving forward would take him into the heart of the Ten Thousand Mountains. 

The region was currently in turmoil as the Nether Sect sought to unify the area, eliminating all opposing forces. 

As a mere Qi Refinement cultivator, Li Shimin wasn't overly concerned about being caught in the crossfire. 

His immediate priority was integrating into North Shu's cultivation world. His speech and mannerisms, if scrutinized, would reveal subtle differences from local norms. 

Having interacted with North Shu cultivators before, he recognized their distinctive accent. With his learning ability, exposure to locals would quickly resolve the language barrier. 

He decided to first blend in with mortals, perhaps even temporarily live as one to assimilate into North Shu's society. 

The nearest city, marked on the map, was called Stone Gate City—his first destination. 

With a goal in mind, Li Shimin moved swiftly, his feet barely touching the ground as he bounded forward. 

"The spiritual energy here surpasses that of Great Xia," he mused while observing his surroundings. "I wonder what it's like near the city?" 

The two most critical factors were spiritual energy levels. He couldn't determine whether this area was unique or if North Shu's ambient energy was universally richer than Tianhai Island's. Without sufficient data, no definitive conclusion could be drawn.

Three days later, the window of a premium room in Stone Gate City's largest inn creaked open. 

Li Shimin gazed at the orderly streets below. Stone Gate, with nearly 300,000 residents and nearly a million in its jurisdiction, would be considered a major city even in Great Xia. 

Yet on the map, it was merely an ordinary border town of the Ten Thousand Mountains. 

Dressed as a scholar with a sword at his waist, Li Shimin showed no trace of being a cultivator. Though twenty years old, his youthful appearance—thanks to cultivation—made him seem no older than when he first entered his sect at sixteen. 

The loose scholar's robe concealed his muscular frame, which would otherwise betray his identity. 

Three days prior, he had stealthily entered the city using 'Escape Art,' then spent hours observing with his spiritual sense before targeting the local magistrate's secretary. 

Using hypnotic techniques, he obtained a complete identity package. Despite regional differences, bureaucratic procedures remained similar. 

His new identity retained his name—Li Shimin—as a scholar from the now-destroyed Shanshi Village, conveniently eliminating any verification risks. 

The secretary had completed all documentation flawlessly within three days. Choosing a scholar's identity allowed Li Shimin the freedom to travel under the guise of academic pursuits. 

After erasing the secretary's memory, he settled into the inn. 

"Master Li," a servant announced, "the merchant caravan to Guanquan City departs tomorrow at sunrise. The innkeeper has arranged everything—just meet Head Escort Zhao at the gate." 

"Your reward," Li Shimin tossed some coins dismissively. 

Over three days, he'd gathered fragmented intelligence about North Shu. Stone Gate's remoteness limited local knowledge, but he learned that Guanquan City nearby had legends of immortals sighted on its mountains, making its temples popular pilgrimage sites. 

With no urgent need for spiritual energy—his current cultivation focused on compressing existing qi—he decided to proceed with his mortal immersion plan, using Guanquan Mountain as a potential gateway to North Shu's cultivation circles.

At dawn, Li Shimin joined a caravan of forty cargo wagons, five carriages, and forty guards. 

"Thank you, Head Escort Zhao," Li Shimin greeted with scholarly courtesy. 

"Master Li, rest assured—this route is well-traveled and perfectly safe," Zhao assured. 

Assigned the third carriage for security, Li Shimin traveled alone, his wealth ensuring comfort. North Shu's currency—gold and silver—was plentiful in his storage bag from past spoils. 

Amused, he noted three cultivators hiding among the caravan. Their presence—a rarity in Tianhai where cultivators avoided mortals—suggested an eventful journey. 

The strongest, at Qi Refinement sixth layer, posed little threat to Li Shimin, whose spiritual sense gave him an edge in this realm. 

As the caravan wound through terraced mountains, Li Shimin monitored the tense, silent trio while enjoying the scenery.

A day into the mountains, four mid-Qi Refinement cultivators blocked the path, their auras flaring. 

"Guan brothers! Surrender the Nether Token and we'll spare your lives!" they demanded, ignoring the panicked mortal escorts. 

The Guan brothers emerged, defiant but outmatched. 

Li Shimin, initially disinterested, perked up at the mention of the Nether Token and Nether Sect—the powerful force that had driven Mingxin Sect into the sea. 

After discreetly moving the caravan to safety, he observed the lopsided battle. North Shu's rogue cultivators proved impoverished, their techniques and artifacts rudimentary by his standards. 

"Friend!" Guan's eldest suddenly shouted toward Li Shimin. "Aid us, and the Nether Token is yours!" 

Caught off guard but quick to react, Li Shimin released his ninth-layer Qi Refinement aura. 

"Scram," he ordered the attackers. "These three are under my protection." 

The assailants paled and fled. Guan's gamble had paid off—halfway, at least. The rest depended on Li Shimin's intentions.
