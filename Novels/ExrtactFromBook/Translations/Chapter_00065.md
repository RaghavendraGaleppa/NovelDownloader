# Chapter 65: The Grandeur of a Major Sect

Though Han Yue had effortlessly refined his second true seal rune, this was merely the first step of a thousand-mile journey! 

Each subsequent true seal rune would require progressively more mana expenditure. Even if the incremental increase seemed modest, when multiplied across the 729 runes needed for Nine Transformations, the total became an astronomical figure. It was clear that refining these two magical artifacts would consume vast amounts of Han Yue's time and energy in the years to come.

Yet compared to other cultivators, Han Yue possessed an innate advantage—the supreme divine ability [Heavenly Origin Treasure Emperor Lotus], which endlessly supplied primal qi. His true path forward lay in continuously converting this primal qi into combat power.

With the empowerment of his two major artifacts—[Demon-Slaying Sword] and [Dutian Seal]—Han Yue's divine abilities had reached unprecedented heights. Within his dantian, the [Heavenly Origin Treasure Emperor Lotus] now generated primal qi at an even more vigorous pace, while his [Sweet Dew] ability produced its essence at accelerated rates. Both abilities significantly deepened his foundational reserves.

Though these lineage artifacts now resided within his dantian, providing substantial enhancement, fully unleashing their power remained challenging given Han Yue's current cultivation level and the artifacts' refinement stage.

"Since you're awake, focus on the task at hand. We've arrived." Li Changle's voice interrupted Han Yue's contemplation of the artifacts' functions.

Opening his eyes, Han Yue found the golden eagle descending slowly through the clouds. The view from above left him awestruck—an expansive plain stretched before them, flanked by two towering ten-thousand-zhang mountains rising abruptly to east and west. Their peaks pierced the clouds, their lower halves obscured from view below. Each mountain extended into sprawling ranges, while between them surged a mighty river originating from their junction, its turbulent waters flowing southward.

Most astonishing was the floating isle suspended mid-air between the mountains—a several-kilometer-wide landmass that would be considered imposing elsewhere, yet appeared diminutive in this grand landscape. A colossal black dragon coiled around the floating mountain, its head resting upon the summit with closed eyes and gaping maw resembling a cavern. The isle itself teemed with intricate architecture—carved beams, painted rafters, pavilions and towers—while both flanking mountains bore similar signs of civilization with orderly pathways connecting various structures.

This majestic vista of mountains, river, and the coiling dragon exuded the grandeur of a supreme sect—they had reached the Divine Thunder Palace, Han Yue's long-awaited sect home.

Li Changle guided the golden eagle toward the floating isle. Mid-flight, he released a crackling arc of electricity—a unique communication method among Divine Thunder Palace disciples, encoding complex messages through personalized mana fluctuations. This single pulse conveyed Li Changle's identity, his three-century imprisonment under a demon saint, recent liberation, and acquisition of a new disciple.

Had Han Yue mastered this communication method, he would have seen his own details included—name, appearance, cultivation level, techniques—along with Li Changle's personal evaluation: "Exceptional aptitude, extraordinary divine abilities, true disciple candidate. Blessed by the God of Wealth, remarkably adept at resource management. Already possesses two third-tier primary materials and has forged a Dao-bearing artifact!"

While exceptional talent wasn't rare in Divine Thunder Palace, being "blessed by the God of Wealth" was practically unheard of in the northern wilds of Luzhou—especially the emphasized "two" materials. Thus Han Yue gained renown before even setting foot in the sect.

Thirty-four responses returned from the three mountains—three from the central isle, one from the western peak, and thirty from the eastern. The sparse response from the vast western mountain puzzled Han Yue, but he remained silent as they proceeded.

Passing through an invisible barrier—the sect's protective formation—Han Yue was immediately enveloped by vibrant primal qi, so rich it made his body feel weightless and his mana flow effortlessly. The qi density here surpassed Fenrou Village's by at least tenfold, where even commoners would enjoy extended lifespans and cultivators progressed exponentially faster. Han Yue now fully grasped the chasm between a top-tier sect and the outside world.

Li Changle provided brief introductions: "This is Luzhou's northernmost region, source of our Inner Realm's greatest river—the Sky-Reaching River. The central floating isle, Feilai Peak, houses our sect's core heritage and facilities along with true disciples' abodes. The western Wuhui Peak and eastern Canglang Peak accommodate inner disciples below true disciple rank—western for the three thunder method practitioners, eastern for others. Yuanchu, you'll likely spend years cultivating on Wuhui Peak."
