# Fever, Taking a Sick Day

Sorry, everyone. I'm not sure if it's COVID, but I'm feeling completely drained. I originally planned to write a bit tonight if I felt better, but now it's clear that won't happen—I'm just too dizzy and out of it. My apologies for taking the day off!

There's been a lot of illness going around lately, so please take care of yourselves too!
