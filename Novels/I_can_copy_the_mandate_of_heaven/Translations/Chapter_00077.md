#77, Seeking People

To be fair, Zhang Li hadn't taken Li Zhi Ming lightly. As someone who walked the rivers and lakes, he knew that underestimating a child could be fatal. He had managed to survive this long because he was cautious. The previous conversation was just a tactic to make Li Zhi Ming let his guard down. However, despite his careful preparation, it was still not enough.

When the sword almost reached his throat, Zhang Li was sweating profusely. At that moment, he had used all his skills, but he still couldn't protect his head. Li Zhi Ming, who had mastered several top-notch martial arts, was too fast for him to see. In an instant, Li Zhi Ming changed his move. Zhang Li felt a flash of cold light, and his vision was temporarily blurred. The next thing he knew, his head had already left his neck.

The "Wind" scripture, a sword art mastered by the Sword Maniac, was executed to perfection. Zhang Li didn't even see it coming before his head rolled to the ground.

The other two were shocked. They had thought that Zhang Li's skills were far superior to theirs, but he was killed in one exchange. They couldn't believe that Li Zhi Ming was just a "little divine doctor." They didn't dare to be careless anymore. They knew that running away was impossible; if they turned around and ran, they would probably die without knowing how. As people who walked the rivers and lakes, they knew this much. They threw Su Kui's words out of their minds and joined forces to surround Li Zhi Ming. One wielded a meteor hammer, and the other used a broadsword. They attacked Li Zhi Ming without holding back.

"Ha!" One of them shouted, releasing the meteor hammer at Li Zhi Ming. The hammer flew quickly, followed by a chain, which could entangle Li Zhi Ming and drag him down if it missed. The other person used a broadsword to attack Li Zhi Ming from behind, aiming directly at the back of his neck.

In the narrow mountain path, the two had maximized their combined strength. Han Li watched calmly, but he found that Li Zhi Ming was still not in danger. With a twist of his hips, Li Zhi Ming drew his sword and lightly knocked against the meteor hammer, deflecting it. Taking advantage of the momentum, he kicked off the ground, using the strength from his ankles to drive his waist and abdomen, and then his entire body. He unleashed a fierce slash.

As the blade cut through the air, flames erupted on its surface - the "Break" scripture, a skill mastered by the "Fierce Blade King" after thirty years of practice. With this skill, the Fierce Blade King had killed seventy-four martial arts experts and earned a fearsome reputation. No one dared to challenge him.

In that instant, Li Zhi Ming's slash unleashed the peak power of the Fierce Blade King. The person wielding the broadsword was struck, his chest and abdomen shattered, and his internal organs were severely damaged. He fell backward, dead.

Without even looking, Li Zhi Ming turned to the last person. The latter was sweating profusely, his meteor hammer still not fully retracted. Li Zhi Ming had already reached him. Abandoning his meteor hammer, the man switched to a pair of short double daggers, holding them in a reverse grip to engage Li Zhi Ming in close combat.

However, the gap in their martial arts skills was too vast. Li Zhi Ming, a master of martial arts, was also an expert in using double daggers. The man's moves were full of flaws in Li Zhi Ming's eyes. Without even taking a closer look, Li Zhi Ming punched out with the "Five Thunder Fists." The man, with his center open, was hit by Li Zhi Ming's seemingly ordinary punch. However, the internal energy invaded his chest, causing five explosions of internal energy within.

The man's body flew backward, crashing into the rock wall, spewing out a mouthful of blood. On the surface, it looked like just a fist mark, but internally, his organs were shattered, and he was already dead.

Li Zhi Ming withdrew his fist, took a breath, and the three people were killed in less than five breaths.

"Let's go," Li Zhi Ming said, continuing down the mountain.

Han Li watched, stunned for a second, before quickly following.

After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, several experts followed, seeing the corpses of Zhang Li and the others. They were shocked, examining the bodies, and then cursed angrily.

"Dammit, these useless people can't even catch two children?"

They had heard that the "little divine doctor" had run down the mountain, so they chased after him. Who would have thought that they would find their own people's bodies instead?

This was absurd. Three people with some reputation in the martial arts world couldn't catch two fourteen-year-old children and were killed instead?

The leader kicked one of the corpses' heads flying down the cliff in anger.

"Chase!" He waved his hand, and they continued to chase down the mountain.

Along the way, there were constant fights, and there were countless corpses by the roadside. Li Zhi Ming protected Han Li as they went down the mountain. Whenever they encountered martial arts experts, Li Zhi Ming killed them instantly. The experts couldn't withstand his skills, and Han Li was shocked by Li Zhi Ming's prowess.

After an hour, they broke through the encirclement.

"Ahh."

They were now three miles away from the Seven Mystic Gate. They stood under a tree, catching their breath, looking back at the gate. The mountain was filled with the sounds of fighting and fire.

Li Zhi Ming was lost in thought, his hand resting on the tree, gazing in the direction they came from. He was filled with a sense of loss, thinking about the people still fighting at the top of the Seven Mystic Gate. His heart ached.

Li Zhi Ming clenched his fist, and Han Li was also gazing in the same direction, filled with the same confusion. Just that morning, they were still receiving the master's crown.

Thinking about it, Han Li touched the black cloth crown on the back of his head.

He also thought about his master, who was still in Lan Zhou, living a precarious life. The world was truly not peaceful.

"Han Li, we'll part ways here," Li Zhi Ming said, catching his breath. "You go back to the Medicine Valley and find Jiang Yun and the others. I'll go back up the mountain to find Da Niu."

Han Li hesitated, feeling that the plan was too dangerous. However, he knew Li Zhi Ming's character and that he wouldn't give up on Da Niu. "Alright, be careful," Han Li said, nodding, and looked deeply at Li Zhi Ming.

After Han Li left, Li Zhi Ming gazed at the Seven Mystic Gate, which was now a mess. There were over ten paths up the mountain; which one had Da Niu taken? In the chaos, he hadn't had time to think about Da Niu's whereabouts. Going back up the mountain without a clear direction was like looking for a needle in a haystack.

"Wait, Da Niu is already a disciple of the 'Break' Peak. He must have taken the path closest to the 'Break' Peak."
