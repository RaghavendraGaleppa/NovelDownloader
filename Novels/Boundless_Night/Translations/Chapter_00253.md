## Chapter 253: The Silence of Prodigies

Inside the vast azure-gold palace of the Flying Immortal Academy, lights blazed brightly. Black and white light erupted simultaneously from Qin Ming's body! In an instant, the venue fell silent, and many gazes converged on him.

This place could truly be described as "a gathering of esteemed guests"; possessing extraordinary talent was merely the threshold to enter. Tonight, renowned disciples from various paths were gathered, their discerning eyes incredibly sharp, and many immediately noticed something unusual. Qin Ming was a newcomer, and his presence, comprehending the ancient texts of a Divine Immortal Dojo, already felt somewhat out of place. Now, with black and white qi coiling around him, he became even more conspicuous.

"Black and white mists rising? That doesn't look like a bluff." Many were astonished; he seemed to have comprehended some profound truth. One had to understand that some of the "young celebrities" present had gained nothing, finding the scriptures as incomprehensible as ghost scribbles. Yet, a newcomer had instead comprehended a portion of the profound meaning, which truly caused many to lose face.

Someone spoke up, "Did he cultivate the wrong path? Everyone else has vibrant, colorful immortal mists, but his black and white light is too plain." Many nodded in agreement. Looking around, Leng Feiyue, covered in Pure Yang Spiritual Light, and Cui Chonghe, enveloped in five-colored immortal haze, among others, all displayed wondrous phenomena. There was also Cheng Sheng, a "Great God" from the Esoteric Sect, who had already reached the perfected Third Realm, with surging tides of light mist, appearing quite divine. Who were these people? All had extraordinary backgrounds, having made their names in the Night Mist World long ago. After comprehending the Immortal Skin, they all seemed to have the blessing of immortal light upon them.

"Could he have mistaken it for a Heavenlight Energy Art to cultivate?" Some showed peculiar expressions. However, there weren't many who agreed; not everyone believed Qin Ming had cultivated the wrong path. Even the few praised individuals furrowed their brows, looking towards the youth on the newcomer's path, wanting to thoroughly investigate the matter.

Soon, people noticed that the Near-Immortal Seeds, Esoteric Divine Seeds, and others were mostly silent, their expressions somewhat serious. The most outstanding disciples from various paths had all gained insights and felt they had benefited immensely, without straying onto the wrong path. Yet, they clearly remembered that the cultivation diagrams on the Immortal Skin were all depicted with black and white lines. Therefore, upon seeing Qin Ming's state, their expressions grew somewhat solemn.

Chu Pianran spoke, "In this scripture, different people will perceive different 'scenes.' Those with superior talent will all gain their own unique insights." Instantly, many let out a sigh of relief. After all, for a youth on the newcomer's path to cultivate black and white light was truly unique. If he were to monopolize the glory, it would truly be "defying the heavens."

"I knew it, a newcomer cultivating the technique from the Immortal Skin would definitely have issues," someone smiled. A few people echoed, nodding along. However, Chu Pianran spoke again, causing their expressions to freeze. "The cultivation method recorded on the Immortal Skin was originally named the 'Black and White Scripture'."

Instantly, all the Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds revealed astonished looks, their eyes deep in thought. The others were in an uproar. Could it be that the method comprehended by the youth on the newcomer's path was the one most aligned with the original scripture's true meaning?

Sun Jingxiao, the Immortal Seed from the Pure Land, found it hard to believe, thinking it absurd. That youth wasn't even from this path, so how could he succeed in cultivation? Earlier, he had scoffed, feeling that the other party was indulging in flights of fancy, like a mere martial artist insisting on engaging in scholarly pursuits and competing with others in literary talent. However, the current situation taught him a harsh lesson. If Qin Ming were a prodigy on the Immortal Path, Sun Jingxiao would have been convinced. But for him to "exchange" across domains with them, and achieve extraordinary success, was simply too much. Sun Jingxiao was almost petrified, thinking it was utterly outrageous. One must know that he had diligently comprehended for a long time without any internal stirrings. Only at the very last moment did a faint light emerge from his body, almost yielding no results.

At this moment, some heaven-defying prodigies felt quite embarrassed. Because their gains were limited; conversely, the youth on the newcomer's path seemed to have comprehended the "orthodox meaning of the scripture."

"He actually... succeeded?!" The white-clad maiden Luo Yao widened her beautiful eyes. She felt truly shocked; earlier, she had thought he was boasting, but now he had actually achieved it. "He emerged from Black and White Mountain, as expected..." In an instant, she began extensive "filling in the blanks" mentally, finding the black and white light perfectly "logical" when paired with Black and White Mountain.

This moment, all the Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds had no choice but to stare at Qin Ming's black and white light mist, their emotions incredibly complex. Even the confident Cui Chonghe couldn't help but frown at this moment; this situation had exceeded his expectations. His expression was indifferent as he looked forward. That youth on the newcomer's path was merely his stand-in in the past!

Zhao Shuyu, from the ancient Divine Immortal Dojo, had a gaze like a sharp sword. He had even slashed that youth several times; in his eyes, the other party was merely a strongman. Yet, a wondrous book from their era had actually been partially comprehended by this youth, leaving his heart feeling empty and making it difficult for him to accept. No one understood better than him the true value of this book. Even Chu Pianran, who was said to have surpassed all contemporary prodigies of an era, had been stumped by it. "This..." He wondered if he had been born in the wrong era, feeling a sense of temporal dislocation. Were strongmen about to rise?

A few heaven-blessed figures from the Ghost Path were also profoundly shaken.

"Why are you all staring at me?" Qin Ming felt fortunate and reined in his power, not letting the black and white light fully erupt, but only allowing it to subtly emanate from his body.

"How did you comprehend such an abstruse scripture?" Chu Pianran personally inquired. Instantly, everyone fell silent, wanting to hear his insights. Primarily, many still refused to be convinced. Why could someone from the newcomer's path comprehend it?

"Is this difficult?" Qin Ming asked with a surprised expression, immediately delivering a "group damage" blow. Even figures like Leng Feiyue, descendant of a Path-Opening Old Monster, and Cheng Sheng, one of the Esoteric Sect's young standard-bearers, found their expressions strained. Cui Chonghe also remained silent, staring at him again and again.

Chu Pianran's eyes held a strange glint, her feelings complex and hard to discern. She said, "The 'Black and White Scripture' demands exceptional talent, having stumped too many people. I, too, have been blocked by it."

Qin Ming said, "Is that so? Is it because my talent is too high?" Instantly, the place became so quiet that a pin drop could be heard. Everyone's gaze was profound; he truly wasn't humble. What a situation for the Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds present to be in?

Qin Ming chuckled and said, "Actually, this has nothing to do with talent. You all cultivated in the wrong direction. I feel this is a Heavenlight Energy Art."

Could it get any more outrageous? Many didn't believe him! This guy actually wanted to transform an immortal scripture into a newcomer's technique. Someone spoke up, "I cultivate both the Immortal Path and the Newcomer's Path simultaneously, and I use Heavenlight Energy to push it, yet I still gain nothing?"

Qin Ming asked, "Has your Heavenlight Energy reached the Three-Imperial Force level?" He almost said it needed to reach the Four-Imperial Force level, but changed his words at the crucial moment. For a time, many who wanted to inquire further and seek guidance fell silent.

Chu Pianran said, "Legend has it that in very ancient times, someone successfully cultivated it, and that person was an ancestor on the Divine Immortal Path. He had never cultivated Heavenlight Energy."

"Perhaps all paths lead to the same destination. He probably cultivated a special Pure Yang Consciousness Spiritual Light, which was already similar to the supreme Heavenlight Energy," Qin Ming mused, not entirely speaking nonsense. Prodigies from other paths fell silent.

"Could this really be a scripture left behind by an unparalleled powerhouse among strongmen?" Even Zhao Shuyu had this thought. Otherwise, it simply couldn't be explained. He refused to believe that a youthful strongman could comprehend an immortal technique.

Qin Ming ignored them, once again experiencing the insights, feeling immensely satisfied. Although it was only twelve pages of scripture, it was comparable to a top-tier wondrous art. Moreover, there was clearly more to come! The Black and White Scripture, with its considerable number of pages, was invaluable! He believed there would definitely be opportunities to access the rest later, as Chu Pianran highly valued this scripture, and there would surely be times for discussion and exchange in the future.

Qin Ming rose, in a joyful mood, naturally carefree and elegant. His wide sleeves fluttered, and he seemed ethereal and otherworldly, possessing more immortal aura than even an outsider disciple.

"Qingyue, I'll teach you," he transmitted to Li Qingyue.

"Let's find another place later."

Qin Ming nodded, this place was indeed unsuitable. Afterwards, he went to find Luo Yao. He approached and smiled, "Let's exchange for the 'Eight Sceneries Scripture'."

The white-clad maiden regained her composure, a bit conflicted. She truly wanted to exchange for this scripture, but she also feared responsibility, as it was an important component of the 'Immortal Combat Scripture'. Earlier, she had impulsively agreed, mainly because she thought the other party wouldn't be able to comprehend the method on the Immortal Skin.

Qin Ming understood the situation at a glance and said, "So you were just boasting, you don't have the qualifications to exchange any scriptures at all!"

"Can't you just... see through it without saying it?" Her skin was quite thick. Then she whispered, "Later, I'll go ask for instructions and tell my sister. She doesn't need to have any reservations. I think she'll definitely be very interested in the Black and White Scripture."

Qin Ming turned away, not wanting to speak with her anymore.

Li Qingyue walked over and said, "No worries, the 'Eight Sceneries Scripture,' right? I know her sister. I'll help you exchange for it with the 'Black and White Scripture' later."

"Good!" Qin Ming indeed valued the 'Eight Sceneries Scripture' greatly; it was a wondrous art he deeply cared about on his planned cultivation path.

The subsequent exchange meeting wasn't as eventful; there were no more scriptures as eye-catching as the 'Black and White Scripture'. In fact, it wasn't long before people started leaving the gathering. In less than two months, Wu Yaozu had already integrated well into the Night Mist World, engaging in pleasant conversations with all parties. When Qin Ming withdrew, Little Wu was still reluctant to leave.

"Then I'll head back first."

The next day, Qin Ming approached Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan, informing them of his desire to enter the Heaven-Connecting Tower. There were three tall towers in the Mountain River Academy. During thunderstorms, they could draw in Heavenlight and thunderfire from the outside world, which could be used for refining artifacts, brewing special elixirs, and more. Qin Ming intended to test his hypothesis, to see if the path for the Second Realm was feasible. In any case, he was very much looking forward to it. Entering a place like the Thunderfire Alchemy Hall would at least allow him to accumulate even denser Heavenlight. He could use this to cultivate his wondrous art and push it towards grand accomplishment.

Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan were stunned upon hearing this. To directly withstand external Heavenlight with a body in the early Second Realm—had this child gone mad?! Qin Ming patiently explained to them, telling the two that he was not afraid of Heavenlight erosion and had done so long ago.

"It's not spring now; summer thunder is destined to be incredibly violent!" Both initially strongly objected. However, they were eventually persuaded. Qin Ming stated that he would face it cautiously and not act rashly.

That day, he successfully entered a Heaven-Connecting Tower.

"During the rainy season, lightning strikes often occur. I shouldn't have to wait long." Qin Ming had everything ready.
