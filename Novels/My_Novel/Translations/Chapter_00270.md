Chapter 270: Entering the Registry

The river shimmered with green waves under the warm spring sun. Amidst the surging currents, Li Xian found himself trapped on a pirate ship, surrounded by a hostile crowd. The enemies were numerous and strong, forming a tactical array, their eyes gleaming with malice like tigers and wolves.

It all started when...

Li Xian had been leaping and rushing beneath the riverbed, but the river's veins were complex. Winding and twisting with countless branches and forks, he had unknowingly entered a tributary of the Azure Water River. Swept by the current, he drifted north and then west...

After much twisting and turning, he ran into the "Flower Cage Gate" pirates. Previously, between Chongling Prefecture and the South King City, there had been a faction of Flower Cage Gate bandits.

They had captured the "Niece of the South King," prompting the South King to set up a "Hero's Banquet," calling upon righteous martial artists to help capture them. The campaign was massive, aiming to execute the flower bandits. However, the Flower Cage Gate was extremely adept at fleeing; even the tightest dragnet found gaps, and there were always those who slipped through the net.

Disguised as "merchants," they sailed along the river. Their leader was named "Ye Cheng." He looked like a middle-aged man, handsome and refined in demeanor, yet his methods were decisive and ruthless.

Leading a group of Flower Cage Gate disciples, he had safely crossed the river, thinking the crisis was behind them, when suddenly he saw Li Xian pop up. Without a word, he ordered him executed.

Li Xian's mind was sharp. The moment he was surrounded, his thoughts raced. He first heard them mention "captains" and "movements," among other things. He deduced they must be fugitives.

And there were many of them. The scale of their pursuit must be enormous. Li Xian recalled his own flight and immediately thought of the South King's Hero's Banquet. He began to suspect that the people on the ship were from the Flower Cage Gate.

However, he couldn't be certain based on that alone. The martial world was vast and ever-changing. Li Xian observed his surroundings further and faintly saw the disciples' formation, which subtly contained the wonder of the "Eight Trigrams." It was consistent with the "Coiled Intestine Step."

His suspicion grew more certain. At this moment, the Flower Cage Gate bandits prepared to strike and kill him. Li Xian had to take a gamble. If things really didn't work out, he would break all pretenses and find another way out.

As soon as he spoke, the bandits' faces filled with doubt, but the killing intent immediately ceased. They merely surrounded him and circled. There were seventeen people in the encirclement; their footsteps were chaotic yet followed a pattern, the sound of their treading frequent.

It vaguely had the effect of confusing the mind. Li Xian saw their figures shifting, and before his eyes appeared afterimages, one turning into three, three into ten, ten into hundreds... In the haze, it felt as if he were surrounded by hundreds of people. Someone with slightly less courage, seeing this situation, would certainly surrender without a fight, afraid of dying under a hail of random sticks.

This was the "Flowers in Profusion Formation," possessing the subtleties of "Blinding Flowers" and "Confusing the Heart with Flowers." Relying on this formation, even ordinary disciples, secretly scattering poison and setting up the array, could capture female heroes.

Li Xian also felt confused. He secretly played the "Body Guarding Sound," guarding his mind tightly, and stood his ground.

Ye Cheng stood with his hands behind his back and said, "Oh? You say you are a disciple of the Flower Cage Gate. Do you have proof? What is your name?"

Li Xian said, "My surname is Hua, named Wucuo (No Mistake)."

He intended to use a fake name. But in his haste, he couldn't be bothered to think of another surname, so he used "Hua." But if he used "Manlou" (Filling the Building) for his name, he might be investigated thoroughly. That would invite trouble, so he casually said "Wucuo."

"Hua Wucuo." Ye Cheng pondered it carefully and clapped his hands in approval. "Hua Wucuo, Hua Wucuo... Good! A good name. Our Flower Cage Gate, how could there be any mistake? Hahaha."

The bandits all laughed heartily. Their hostility toward Li Xian decreased immediately. Ye Cheng continued, "How can I be sure you are not a captain?"

Li Xian said, "I and the captains have always been irreconcilable. To be honest... I am being hunted down, fleeing desperately into the river. That is how I met you brothers."

"Think about it, brothers. Our Flower Cage Gate's escape methods are peerless. If I were a captain, could I really be found? Even a divine captain would find it difficult, right?"

"And if I were a captain, coming aboard alone, wouldn't that be seeking my own death?"

Ye Cheng nodded and said, "There is reason in your words, but this only proves you are not a captain. However... it is still hard to prove you are a member of my Flower Cage Gate."

"I will give you another chance. Please find a way to prove yourself. If you cannot prove it clearly, even if there is a possibility of killing you by mistake, I cannot spare you."

Li Xian said, "Please look at the token." He took out the "Flower Cage Gate" token from his chest. This item came from the Flower Cage Gate disciple "Gu Shuntong."

In the past... Li Xian, as a Martial Captain, was extremely glorious. The young matriarch of the穷天林氏, Lin Aoshan, to gain merit, invited him to suppress the remnants of the Flower Cage.

Among them was a Flower Cage Gate disciple with great talent and a [Snake Bone Physique]. Li Xian struck and killed him, searched his corpse, and obtained items like "Gang Thunder Finger" and "Flower Cage Token."

He carried them with him, and now they proved useful. Ye Cheng raised his hand and sucked, catching the Flower Cage Token in his palm. He inspected it closely and confirmed it was genuine.

He tossed it back and said indifferently, "Although you hold the token, it is still hard to prove yourself. Have you practiced our school's martial arts?"

Li Xian bowed and said, "This disciple had just entered the sect when I was hunted down. I hadn't learned the essentials before I was separated from the others. I barely made it onto this merchant ship with my life. If the token is not enough to prove my identity, then... I have nothing to say."

He yielded to advance.

The Flower Cage Gate disciples nodded secretly. Since entering the Flower Cage Gate, sleeping in the open and eating in the wild, suffering from pursuit and suppression, had become the norm. The situation Li Xian described was something the bandits had all experienced to some extent.

Ye Cheng still found it hard to determine if Li Xian was real or fake. But observing the disciples' expressions, he thought to himself: "This boy may not be a disciple of my Flower Cage Gate, but he likely isn't a captain. His words just now resonated with the disciples. If I kill him now, the disciples might wonder... if they ever ask fellow sect members for help in the future, would they be killed on the spot if they couldn't prove themselves?"

"He is not a captain, and he is being hunted. That should be true. In this situation, it wouldn't hurt to let him stay for a while."

He said loudly, "Very well. Although you have the token, you have just entered the sect. I will keep the token. You are considered a half-disciple-in-name. Qiao Sanyan, take him to his quarters, change his clothes, and let him rest well."

Qiao Sanyan said, "Yes!" He was tall and broad-shouldered, with a strong voice. He gave Li Xian a friendly smile.

Li Xian returned the gesture calmly, thinking to himself: "These bandits are quite particular." At least he had some arrangement. Once the ship docked, he would immediately escape. He was at the Second Stage of martial arts; once he entered the water, he would sink. His flexibility was far inferior to that of a First Stage martial artist.

Qiao Sanyan laughed and said, "Brother Hua, being hunted is a normal occurrence for us Flower Cage Gate disciples. There is no need to be sad."

Li Xian said, "I have calmed down. Heaven has blessed me to meet you all." Qiao Sanyan laughed heartily, patting Li Xian's shoulder, saying, "Indeed, you have survived a great disaster and will surely have good fortune later. Don't think too much about it."

As they talked, they arrived at a cabin. The door was low, and the oil lamp flickered. The mottled wooden walls grew mold, and the air was extremely damp and stifling.

Li Xian was tall and had to bow to enter. Inside was a wooden bed and a wooden table. With the river current slapping against it, the ship swayed left and right, making the bed and table creak and groan.

Li Xian tried lying on the bed. He had to curl up his body; the board was very hard. It was no different from sleeping on the floor.

Qiao Sanyan laughed and said, "This is the treatment for a disciple-in-name. When you become a token disciple, you can move to a big room."

Li Xian said, "Brother Qiao, I was hunted down just after entering the Flower Cage Gate. I haven't had time to understand the sect's rules. Could you please tell me?"

Qiao Sanyan said, "Sure, sure. Eh... Brother Hua... you seem quite handsome." By the candlelight, he could see Li Xian's face clearly.

Li Xian was drenched, his hair scattered. It was hard to see his face. Now that he had escaped danger, he combed his long hair back, revealing his facial features completely. Qiao Sanyan gradually noticed.

Li Xian said, "Just a皮囊 (skin bag)." Qiao Sanyan clicked his tongue in amazement and said, "Our Flower Cage Gate, when you think about it... is truly a super sect that shakes the Great Wu!"

Li Xian thought: "I'm afraid it's notorious." Qiao Sanyan said, "Look at the disciples of ordinary sects; who isn't from a famous family? Ordinary poor families' children, it's hard for them to reach the Refining Flesh realm in their lifetime. It's not that they lack ability, but that they have no path to find."

"But our Flower Cage Gate advocates teaching without discrimination. Anyone who enters our sect, regardless of background or status. We, who come from the grass roots, if we want to seek a path upward, we can only take this route. So... Brother Hua, you should cherish it."

Li Xian, with his weak body, had knocked on the door of the martial path and experienced countless dangers. He somewhat agreed with this. Although the Flower Cage Gate was shameful, the path for ordinary mud-legged people to seek progress was scarce. This path, though evil and crooked, was still a "path."

Qiao Sanyan continued, "I know you just entered the Flower Cage Gate. Knowing what we do, you probably feel very unhappy. But I have a secret to tell you, then you will understand... In this martial world, there is no such thing as right and wrong."

Li Xian asked curiously, "Brother Qiao, please speak."

Qiao Sanyan sat on the bed, lightly patting Li Xian's shoulder. The cramped room could barely fit the two of them. He said, "Do you know why, despite being suppressed repeatedly, our Flower Cage Gate always manages to escape? It is indeed because we are extremely adept at fleeing. But... there is another reason."

"Sometimes, those who hire us, on the surface, are the ones hunting us. Their pursuit seems strict, but they intentionally leave gaps. We always slip through, which is why the Flower Cage Gate continues to exist endlessly."

"The famous orthodox sects, dignified on the outside, are extremely disgusting on the inside. We, born from humble origins, are born villains. Since that's the case, let it be so. What's wrong with being a little villain!"

Li Xian said, "Brother Qiao's words make sense." He thought to himself: "The martial world is like this big river; on the surface it is glorious, but in reality, mud accumulates. Stir it up with a hand, and the river water becomes turbid... How can we distinguish who is good or bad, who is clear or what is muddy. All I can do is stick to my bottom line and forge ahead."

"As for being a good person... I'm afraid I can't claim that either."

Qiao Sanyan said, "I suppose Brother Hua doesn't understand the Flower Cage Gate's rules yet. I'll tell you, you must remember."

He immediately detailed the sect rules, order, and hierarchy... Li Xian didn't intend to stay here long, but to play along, he认真记下 (memorized them seriously).

The Flower Cage Gate has four ranks: "Miscellaneous," "In-name," "Token," and "Seal."

Li Xian belonged below "In-name." His status was very low. Qiao Sanyan said, "Brother Hua, don't worry. If you perform well, you will soon be recorded in the registry and become an in-name disciple. As for becoming a token disciple, it's not really difficult. But becoming a 'Seal' disciple is a bit harder."

The two talked for a while. Qiao Sanyan had other business and took his leave. Two maids came over and delivered change of clothes. Li Xian laughed and said, "Thanks!" He took the clothes.

The maids stood to the left and right, guarding outside the room.

Li Xian closed the door. He lightly patted the clothes; they were ordinary cloth garments, the material was quite rough, with no craftsmanship to speak of. To be safe, fearing the clothes might be poisoned, he gathered the Three Flowers atop his head and spat a breath of pure air.

The pure air washed away the filth; the clothes were quite new. Confirming there were no poisons or mechanisms, he put them on. He sorted out all the miscellaneous items on his body.

Li Xian calmed his mind and looked around. He pondered his current situation. Far away, Wen Caishang was seeking revenge, yet he was deeply trapped in the Flower Cage Gate. The situation was extremely bad.

The cabin had no windows. Li Xian opened his Heavy Pupils. Through the wooden walls, he saw the turbulent river surface. He vaguely knew the flower ship had weighed anchor and was sailing again.

"If the timing is right, I can dive into the river again and escape this ship. But this cannot be rushed and must be hidden. Otherwise, the experts on the ship will jump into the water to catch me. It would be hard to escape."

Li Xian frowned, looking at the swaying oil lamp. Half an hour passed, and Li Xian pushed open the door, intending to use the excuse of getting fresh air and resting to choose a good opportunity to escape.

The two maids extended their hands, blocking his way. They said in unison, "Go back. Without Elder Ye's order, you are not allowed to go out."

Li Xian said, "Why can the other disciples..." One maid said, "Although you have a token, you don't know our sect's martial arts. This is suspicious. Elder Ye does not fully trust you."

Li Xian fell silent. This was done in a hurry; even with a glib tongue, he couldn't cover all the flaws. There must be many loopholes. Ye Cheng was very cautious and naturally didn't believe him.

He closed the door.

Knowing that panic was useless, Li Xian silently played the "Body Guarding Sound," which lingered in his mind, calming his breath and extinguishing his thoughts. He sat cross-legged, moving the filth in his five organs, internally practicing the "Five Organs Expelling Filth Meeting Yang Meridian."

[You expel filth from the five organs, Proficiency +1]

[Five Organs Expelling Filth Meeting Yang Meridian]

[Proficiency: 656/800 Beginner]

Li Xian was naturally carefree, and he had completely calmed down at this critical moment. His soul drifted, roaming heaven and earth. He watched the green mountains and the river water, infinitely relaxed.

Another hour passed.

The proficiency of the Five Organs Expelling Filth Meeting Yang Meridian had accumulated to [668], showing significant progress, his blood abundant and energy vigorous. Just at this moment, the door was knocked.

A maid said, "Hua Wucuo, Elder Ye wants to see you."

Li Xian frowned. Maintaining his composure, he pushed the door open and said, "Please lead the way." Two maids, one in front and one behind, led the way.

Li Xian secretly guarded himself, wary of the two maids attacking. He observed closely and saw that the two women's footsteps were synchronized, and their breath was the same. They must have practiced a certain martial art together.

The merchant ship was very large, with four floors. Li Xian was on the first floor. After turning a narrow corner, he saw the living quarters of the ordinary disciples.

In a row, there were more than ten rooms on the left and more than ten on the right... Each room housed two people. The space was relatively spacious. The doors were all open, and the smell of tobacco, foot odor, armpit odor, and feces and urine drifted out.

It was mixed with the unique salty and fishy smell of the river. Li Xian peered into the rooms and saw several people gathered, playing tiles, playing cards... all kinds of gambling for fun.

It was extremely noisy.

Suddenly, a shout was heard. The several people playing tiles cursed and yelled; someone cheated, leading to an argument. They used fists and feet against each other, wrestling into a fight.

Li Xian sighed: "For a sect that claims to be famous, how can the disciples under it be like this."

They walked to a staircase. The maid behind pushed Li Xian's shoulder and said, "Go up quickly." Li Xian frowned and went up the stairs along the steps.

The second floor was filled with a faint incense smell. The environment was several times better, with very few people, and the doors were all closed. The maid in front said, "Walk lightly. This is where the token disciples live. If you disturb their practice, be careful or they will kill you."

Li Xian said, "Alright." He lightened his steps and looked around. The corridor on the second floor was spacious, and in the corners were placed jade porcelain and other items, showing elegance.

He wanted to take the opportunity to familiarize himself with the ship's layout. If there was an extreme emergency, he would have to jump into the river to escape and risk his life. However, the corridors on the ship were winding, like a maze, similar to the "Lu Dong's" tomb hidden in the mountains, which had a winding intestine design.

If he wandered around randomly, he would surely get lost and walk right into a trap.

Li Xian secretly guarded himself, knowing that this ship contained a hidden universe. He quickly reached the third floor. Here, there was only one residence, extremely luxurious, like a mansion courtyard. Flowers, trees, and plants were planted, a pond was dug, and golden carp were raised.

Ye Cheng was enjoying the service of women. Rubbing his shoulders, kneading his legs, loosening his waist, massaging his head, feeding him fruits, strumming the zither... Not a single part of him was idle.

The two maids knelt on the ground and said respectfully, "Master, the person has been brought."

Ye Cheng looked up. The women immediately stopped their movements and helped him put on his clothes. They skillfully stepped aside. Ye Cheng said, "Hua Wucuo... come in."

Inside, a lingering fragrance floated. Ye Cheng looked him over and was quite surprised; he didn't expect this boy to be so handsome.

Li Xian bowed and said, "Elder!" Ye Cheng said, "The past is懒得追究 (I can't be bothered to investigate). You are definitely not a disciple of my Flower Cage Gate, I can see that."

Li Xian said calmly, "Then why, Elder Ye..." Ye Cheng said, "You are being hunted, I can see that too. Let me ask you, I am giving you a chance now to join my Flower Cage Gate. Will you join or not?"

Li Xian had always disdained the Flower Cage Gate's actions. Usually, if he saw Flower Cage Gate bandits, he would strike and kill them. But fate plays tricks, and now a huge dilemma is placed before him.

Ye Cheng said, "If you join, you will be recorded in the registry. If you don't..." He didn't finish.

But the women who had been serving him had all secretly circulated their Qi. If Li Xian dared to shake his head, they would launch a continuous attack. Li Xian had experienced the Flower Cage Gate's "formation" and knew deep down that although this sect committed many evils, their martial arts were quite profound. This array of women was definitely stronger than the earlier "Flowers in Profusion Formation."

He knew his strength was not bad. But the对手's capabilities were still unclear. And Ye Cheng was definitely extremely powerful. If they really fought hard, the chances of death were high.

Li Xian thought: "I will pretend to join the registry first, then find a way to escape later." He said, "I would be honored, of course I will join."

A maid in a colorful skirt took out a registry. It was made of "Green Bamboo," very thin and short. She carved the words "Hua Wucuo" onto the bamboo booklet.

Then she blew a soft whistle, and a colorful pigeon flew to her hand. She tied the bamboo booklet to the pigeon's claw. She cupped it with both hands to the window and let it fly out.

Ye Cheng nodded and said, "Actually... whether you join the Flower Cage Gate or not makes little difference to me. But I like the look of you, kid. I always feel you can achieve something and make a name for yourself."

"I don't mind giving you a leg up."

A maid said, "Thank the Master quickly."

Ye Cheng shouted, "Noisy, when men are speaking, what are women interrupting for?"

The maid said, "Yes, yes, it's the lowly servant's fault." She quickly knelt down, her whole body trembling.

Ye Cheng laughed and said, "Hua Wucuo, perform well. If you really achieve something in the future, you can pick one of my many maids to take away."

Li Xian said, "Thank you for your favor, Elder." Ye Cheng said, "You said you were being hunted, but since you are on my flower ship, I'm afraid that person won't be able to catch up."

Li Xian asked, "Why?"

Ye Cheng laughed and said, "My flower ship looks ordinary on the outside. Like a merchant vessel on the river, but it contains the mystery of the universe, involving the杂学 of geomancy. Alas, telling you this, you surely wouldn't understand. It's useless to say, useless to say. Go back to your room."

"At the Yin-Mao time (3-5 am) tomorrow, you need to gather on the deck. Since you have joined my Flower Cage Gate, you need to learn the methods. You will follow the others to practice for three days."

Ye Cheng laughed and said, "I see your footwork. You should have martial arts skills. Let it be, I can't be bothered to investigate your past. The disciples on this ship are mostly those who brought their own teachers to join. Our Flower Cage Gate teaches without discrimination. Whether you can climb up depends on each person's ability."

"In our Flower Cage Gate, there are no lack of geniuses who rose from poverty. As long as you work hard and endure hardships, anything is possible."

"Go now."

Li Xian said, "Yes!"

Two maids led the way back and forth, guiding him back to his room. Li Xian settled his mood and clarified his current situation. He was in the midst of two great dangers: Wen Caishang and the Flower Cage Gate.

If he escapes now. The two great dangers will come together, a situation far more dangerous than being pursued by "Su Qiuwu" and others. If he stays on the ship, he is already registered. Ye Cheng might not move him.

And what Ye Cheng said... this ship contains a universe and can shake off pursuit. Wen Caishang has strange and great abilities; the ship's universe might not be able to stop her. Whether she can find him is hard to say.

But... Li Xian thought. Even if he ran alone, it would be hard to be faster than the ship. Weighing the benefits... it was indeed the best choice to stay on the ship temporarily and work with the Flower Cage Gate.

Li Xian wanted to cry but had no tears: "I originally wanted to join the Yueshan Sword Sect, an orthodox path, elegant and romantic, respected by others. How did I, by a twist of fate, become a disciple of the Flower Cage Gate?"

"Never mind... as long as I keep to my bottom line. No matter where I am, I am just me. If my original heart is settled, any road is smooth."

He thought no more of it. He moved the filth, nourishing his blood and strengthening his body.

[You move the filth, Proficiency +1]

In the blink of an eye, it was the Yin time (3-5 am). The ship was in an uproar. The disciples dressed and gathered on the deck. Li Xian also followed the crowd, standing in a corner.

During the day, the flower ship needed to be disguised. There was no place for everyone to practice martial arts, so they waited until night to come out on the deck to practice.

Qiao Sanyan said, "Brother Hua, you just entered the in-name rank. I'll teach you the 'Coiled Intestine Small Step' first. Remember it well."

He demonstrated it several times. The "Coiled Intestine Step" is not a martial art, but a way of walking. Through body movements, it makes it seem like you are walking left when you are actually walking right.

It is used flexibly.

In a dense forest, with vegetation blocking the view. He would move left and right, east and west... If others were distracted for a moment, they would surely lose his trail.

Li Xian practiced according to the method. He was very smart and quickly grasped the essentials. His steps were extremely confusing, even stronger than many senior disciples.

He mastered the technique and used it flexibly. He even incorporated his understanding of the "Four Directions Fist," making the Coiled Intestine Step even more confusing. Here on the ship's deck, it was open and unobstructed.

Others couldn't see the trick.

But if it were in a forest. If Li Xian fled like this, it would be enough to confuse others into a daze. Qiao Sanyan asked in surprise, "Brother Hua, have you practiced Coiled Intestine Step before?"

Li Xian said, "Someone taught me once, but I didn't have time to practice it."

Qiao Sanyan praised, "Then you are amazing! This Coiled Intestine Step, it's not hard to say it's hard, not easy to say it's easy. But there are people who can't learn it all their lives, and people who master it at a glance."

Li Xian said, "Brother Qiao, are there other martial arts you can teach me?" Since he decided to stay on the ship temporarily, he intended to get as much martial knowledge as possible.

Even basic martial arts were precious. Qiao Sanyan hesitated, "This... this might not be appropriate. Even basic martial arts need to..."

Ye Cheng said, "It's fine, make an exception and teach him one first."

Qiao Sanyan heard this and immediately taught Li Xian the "Flying Snake Hand." Although it was a basic martial art, Li Xian still practiced seriously, training on the deck for two hours.

[Flying Snake Hand]

[Proficiency: 369/500 Beginner]

The Mao time (5-7 am) had just passed. The disciples returned to the cabin, and the flower ship sailed quietly.

Early morning.

Fog locked the river surface. On the first floor, stoves were lit to cook. It was all ordinary dishes: boiled beans, pumpkin soup, shredded meat with cauliflower... Li Xian held a wooden bowl, simply filling his stomach, asking for nothing else.

"That... new guy, are you done eating?"

The token disciple "Wang Zekai" waved to him.

Li Xian said, "Yes."

Wang Zekai said, "Good... you look quite handsome. Take these two bowls of soup and go feed those two women."

"Don't say I didn't warn you. Those two women are beautiful, but don't get lustful. Although they can't move, hehe, their temper is very fierce. If they bite your ear off, hehe, you'd have to accept your bad luck."

"If you have the ability to make them take a single bite, then you are impressive. I'll reward you with one tael of silver."
