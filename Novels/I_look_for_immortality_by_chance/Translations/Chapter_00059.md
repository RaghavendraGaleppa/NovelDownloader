# Chapter 59: Testing the Seal, An Unexpected Surprise  

"Farming truly is the most comfortable path after all!"  

Watching the perfectly formed Minor Titan Seal effortlessly merge into his dantian, Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh in admiration.  

Under normal circumstances, cultivation required comprehending Dao patterns, repeated trial and error, and the consumption of numerous spiritual materials before one could refine a seal. It was an incredibly painstaking process.  

But with the "Body-Seeding Seal," he achieved three benefits at once. All he had to do was sit cross-legged, and the seal naturally integrated into his body. Truly miraculous.  

*Buzz!*  

Now that the seal was complete, it was time to test it.  

With a thought, Gu Yuan activated the Minor Titan Seal with his spiritual energy.  

*Whoosh!*  

In an instant, his body swelled like an inflating balloon. In the blink of an eye, he transformed into an enormous, towering figure—a muscular giant over ten feet tall. His bulging muscles and piercing gaze exuded an overwhelming sense of pressure.  

*Crack!*  

With a casual wave of his hand, the air split with a sharp crack, as though his immense strength had torn through it.  

"Is this the amplifying power of the Minor Titan Seal? The weak become strong, and the strong become peerless?"  

Feeling the endless surge of power in his body, Gu Yuan clenched his fists tightly.  

The Minor Titan Seal itself did not possess combat abilities, but it could amplify all of Gu Yuan's capabilities, including his physical strength.  

If he had been a "frail scholar" before, with a punch strength of a few hundred pounds—enough to bully ordinary mortals—now his strength had skyrocketed to several thousand pounds. He could tear apart tigers and leopards with his bare hands or shatter stone tablets with ease.  

However, such strength was still far from sufficient to contend with cultivators or demonic beasts.  

In this world, cultivation was unique. While a cultivator's spiritual energy couldn't directly manipulate the spiritual forces of heaven and earth, the energy itself contained immense power, capable of endless transformations.  

A seventh-level Qi Refining cultivator possessed spiritual energy equivalent to tens of thousands of pounds of force. With just their spiritual energy, they could part waters, split mountains, or move massive boulders—truly formidable.  

Precisely because spiritual energy itself held such might, the path of physical cultivation was even more challenging.  

Physical strength had to far surpass spiritual energy to be effective in combat.  

To contend with a seventh-level Qi Refining cultivator, one needed at least a hundred thousand pounds of brute strength, along with specialized physical cultivation techniques. Otherwise, it would be impossible to rival a fellow spell-cultivator of the same realm.  

That said, physical seals were still part of spell cultivation. Ultimately, the two belonged to the same school—there was no separate path purely for physical cultivation. Both were intertwined with spiritual energy, forming a multifaceted whole.  

"Several thousand pounds of strength isn't particularly useful, but what about tens of thousands?"  

Gu Yuan suddenly smiled faintly, then activated the Cold Rhinoceros Dragon-Elephant Star Spirit, which merged into his chest.  

*Rustle!*  

In an instant, the Star Spirit and the Minor Titan Seal shone simultaneously. Gu Yuan's body expanded once more, swiftly growing to a staggering thirty feet tall. His muscles bulged like forged steel, radiating an aura of indomitable might.  

Even his hair shimmered with an eerie luster, carrying a tangible, weighty presence.  

*Boom!*  

Gu Yuan threw a punch, and the sheer force generated a sonic boom. A terrifying shockwave erupted, sweeping through the cave. If not for the protective formation, the cliff walls would have been blasted apart.  

With both the Star Spirit and the Minor Titan Seal amplifying him, Gu Yuan's strength surged to over a hundred and fifty thousand pounds in an instant. The icy, sinister energy in his abdomen could even freeze mid-grade magical artifacts solid.  

"With just my physical strength, I can surpass a seventh-level Qi Refining cultivator. Even against an eighth-level opponent, I can put up a fight!"  

His thirty-foot-tall frame exuded overwhelming pressure. Even his soft murmurs rumbled like thunder, echoing through the cave.  

"Not only that—my seals and spiritual sense have also been enhanced."  

With another thought, all the seals in his dantian flew out, orbiting around him.  

Each seal shimmered with a strange radiance, as though wrapped in golden light, exuding an explosive aura.  

Even the most basic "Mystic Turtle Seal" now appeared profound, its turtle-like form clearer than before, as though a real divine turtle lurked within, ready to block all attacks.  

*Roar!*  

In his sea of consciousness, the dragon-like spiritual sense seemed to have feasted on a potent tonic, swelling in size and brimming with ferocity, as if eager to devour someone.  

An unprecedented sense of power surged through Gu Yuan's entire being, filling him with an urge to seek out an opponent and test his newfound might.  

*Haaah...*  

But he took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the impulse.  

Because he had discovered something even more exhilarating.  

*Rustle!*  

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan sat cross-legged and began meditating.  

The spiritual energy in the air rushed into his body at an astonishing rate, replenishing his reserves and amplifying his spiritual energy.  

After a long while, he opened his eyes, brimming with joy.  

Still uncertain, he repeated the process several times before finally relaxing.  

"So it's true!"  

"The Minor Titan Seal doesn’t just amplify my physical strength… but also my innate talent and potential?"  

"During the activation of the seal, even my aptitude and qualifications are enhanced?"  

"Did the Luoxia Sect discover a legacy of physical seals in the Thunderpeal Mountains, allowing someone to break through to Foundation Establishment because of this?"  

Gu Yuan recalled the information he had obtained from the Southern Mountain Pavilion and began to speculate.  

The wonder of Body-Sealing lay in its ability to alter one's innate talent and reduce bottlenecks in breakthroughs.  

But now it seemed that strength-enhancing seals—or unique seals like the Minor Titan Seal that amplified the body—had similar effects.  

"In that case, this is truly an unexpected surprise!"  

A smile curled at the corners of Gu Yuan's lips.  

He remained still, carefully sensing the flow of his spiritual energy.  

After a full incense stick's worth of time, the glow of the Minor Titan Seal dimmed, and his spiritual energy was completely depleted.  

"At most, it lasts for the duration of an incense stick. If I want to activate it again, I’ll need at least two hours to recover."  

After estimating his limits, Gu Yuan understood the constraints.  

While the duration wasn’t long, it was sufficient for combat or critical breakthroughs.  

He then returned to his original size, sat cross-legged, and meditated for a long while. Only after his spiritual energy was fully restored did he open his eyes again.  

"Now that I’ve broken through to the seventh level of Qi Refining, I can take a break from intensive cultivation. It’s time to think of ways to earn more spirit stones and cultivate the 'Heaven-Piercing Spirit Eyes.'"  

Over the past year, Gu Yuan had trained relentlessly, rarely leaving his cave, focusing solely on cultivation.  

While this approach was safe, he wasn’t a disciple of a noble family with a clan backing him. Without venturing out or taking risks, he had no way to earn spirit stones.  

After purchasing the Minor Titan Wood, his reserves were nearly exhausted.  

Though he later killed the Water Ape and the Beast Taming Youth, the gains weren’t substantial—only a little over a hundred spirit stones and a few magical artifacts.  

Among them, the three artifacts from the Beast Taming Youth weren’t for sale.  

With the Eight Winds Treasure Ring in hand, Gu Yuan could counter any Qi Refining-stage magical artifact—meaning he could attack others with artifacts, but they couldn’t do the same to him.  

Thus, every artifact in his possession was an additional trump card.  

The cultivation world was far from peaceful, and the more hidden cards one had, the better. Gu Yuan wouldn’t part with any useful artifacts.  

Only the Water Ape’s trident, despite being a top-grade artifact, was crafted for demons and didn’t suit him. He had already listed it in the Black Star Market and sold it for three hundred and fifty spirit stones.  

Since it was a demonic artifact, the price was suppressed—otherwise, it would have fetched at least four hundred spirit stones.  

This brought his total to nearly five hundred spirit stones—a considerable sum.  

Yet the cost of cultivating the Heaven-Piercing Spirit Eyes was higher than he had anticipated.  

The technique required three types of spirit flowers, ground into liquid and mixed with spiritual water to bathe his eyes for forty-nine consecutive days.  

Each day demanded one of each flower and a portion of spiritual water—totaling one hundred and forty-seven flowers and forty-nine portions of water over the entire period.  

Each flower cost at least four spirit stones. Even after deducting the eighteen flowers seized from the Water Ape, he still needed one hundred and twenty-nine, amounting to five hundred and sixteen spirit stones.  

Adding the cost of spiritual water, the total would exceed seven hundred spirit stones.  

Moreover, even with the funds, gathering so many flowers would take time—it couldn’t be done overnight.  

Once the Spirit Eyes cultivation began, it couldn’t be interrupted. Thus, Gu Yuan had to collect all the flowers beforehand.  

So far, he had gathered a hundred flowers and enough spiritual water, with leads on the remaining flowers—but no money to pay for them.
