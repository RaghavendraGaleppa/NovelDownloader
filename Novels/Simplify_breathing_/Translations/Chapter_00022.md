## Chapter 22: Startling Suspense Force

Chen Fei felt dizzy reading the cultivation manual. Many passages seemed highly logical, yet he had no idea how to begin practicing them. An hour later, Chen Fei put down the manual. His only conclusion was that the manual likely contained something valuable, but cultivating it directly would probably lead to qi deviation at best.

"'Startling Thunder Sword Art' simplifying... Simplification successful... 'Startling Thunder Sword Art' → 'Jing Character Art'!"

"As expected, there was something!"

Chen Fei's eyes lit up. As the contents of the 'Jing Character Art' appeared in his mind, Chen Fei became immersed. Another half an hour passed before Chen Fei finally came to.

"'It really is a part of the Startling Thunder Sword Art. This is a huge gain.'"

Chen Fei's lips curled into a smile. If he could successfully comprehend the complete Startling Thunder Sword Art, not only would his cultivation speed be incredibly fast, but his techniques would also possess the might of thunder. The 'Jing Character Art' didn't carry the power of thunder, but it inherited the advantage of rapid cultivation speed. Of course, since it was only a part of the Startling Thunder Sword Art, the 'Jing Character Art' wasn't without its flaws. If one wasn't careful during cultivation, it was very easy to injure oneself.

Therefore, for martial artists who reach a certain realm, stronger cultivation techniques are undoubtedly one of their goals. For instance, disciples of large aristocratic families or powerful sects begin with superior cultivation techniques and naturally have no need to switch. It was only someone without any background like Chen Fei who needed to seek opportunities to acquire stronger cultivation techniques.

"'After merging and simplifying, the silver cost was much lower, likely because I already mastered many of its components. A brand new, second simplification, like 'Immortal's Guidance,' would require ten times the silver. Knowledge truly is expensive!'"

Chen Fei muttered to himself, then sat cross-legged to cultivate. A night passed in the blink of an eye.

The next day, Chen Fei refined pills in the medical hall as usual. In the evening, Chen Fei changed his appearance and appeared in the night market. This time, Chen Fei adopted a new identity, completely different from his previous ones. He appeared strong and burly, and even with a mask, a scar near his eye was visible.

"'Do you buy pills?'" Chen Fei approached a stall and asked in a hoarse voice.

That disguise technique was truly miraculous. After Chen Fei cultivated it to the Grand Completion realm, he could freely change both his face and voice, and even make minor adjustments to his physique with ease. With a mask and a bamboo hat, he truly became one of a thousand faces, with no need to worry about being recognized.

"'Depends on the quality of the pills. If they're good, naturally, I'll buy them,' the stall owner said unhurriedly, glancing at Chen Fei and noticing the scar near his eye."

"'Ah, don't be hasty, the price is negotiable,' the stall owner said, startled, quickly stopping Chen Fei."

A moment later, Chen Fei left the night market. The final price settled at eight taels of silver. While not entirely satisfied, it was acceptable. Compared to what he earned at Qingzheng Medical Hall, this was already a significant amount for Chen Fei.

Refining pills, cultivating, and grinding proficiency – Chen Fei's life seemed to return to tranquility. However, on the fifth day, Chen Fei saw Physician Qin in the medical hall. Physician Qin walked around the medical hall a few times. Sun Shu appeared, and the two conversed for a bit, seemingly enjoying their chat. Half an hour later, Physician Qin left the North City Medical Hall.

Chen Fei's expression remained calm. He knew that Zhang Sinan was about to make his move, and the next few days would likely be troublesome. Chen Fei pondered for a moment and decided not to come to the medical hall for the time being. It was a good opportunity to diligently raise the proficiency of his 'Startling Suspense Force' at home, and also to explore Pingyin County. Having been in this world for so long, he was initially busy making a living, and then continuously cultivating. Chen Fei actually knew very little about the city he lived in. His previous self was a mere handyman, so naturally, there weren't many opportunities.
