# Chapter 28: Cultivating the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit  

Over the next few days, Chu Ning's cultivation became highly focused.  

Previously, he had divided his time between practicing life-saving techniques like Golden Sword Art, Thorn Art, and Vine Armor Art. Now, he set all those aside. After all, for the foreseeable future, he had no plans to leave the sect's protective boundaries. He could safely stay within the sect's territory, tending to his fields and cultivating in peace.  

His sole task was to relentlessly practice the Verdant Spring Art.  

Chu Ning spent his days almost entirely in the Ink Spirit Bamboo fields, and his nights sitting in the courtyard filled with Ironvine, continuously honing the Verdant Spring Art. When his spiritual energy was depleted, he would switch to cultivating the Evergreen Wood Art to recover, then return to practicing the Verdant Spring Art. If he grew too exhausted from either, he would perform a cycle or two of the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique, instantly restoring his body to peak condition before resuming his training.  

Of course, when he felt his body had truly reached its limit, Chu Ning would allow himself to sleep, ensuring full recovery.  

Through this relentless, day-and-night cultivation regimen...  

Seven days later.  

Upper-grade Spirit Field, Zone D.  

Chu Ning stood before the Ink Spirit Bamboo, not forming any hand seals. With a casual wave, he cast a spell directly onto several stalks of bamboo. A smile soon spread across his face.  

"Verdant Spring Art—instant casting!"  

The long-mastered Verdant Spring Art had finally been perfected, reaching the level of instant casting and becoming an innate divine ability!  

Without hesitation, Chu Ning dug up a large amount of spirit soil from the field and hurried back to his courtyard, heading straight for a secluded corner in the backyard.  

This corner was already enclosed by a canopy of woven Ironvine. After preparing the spirit soil, he carefully retrieved the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit sapling from its jade box and planted it. Then, with rapid hand seals, he cast the Verdant Spring Art ten times in succession onto the sapling.  

Only after finishing did he pause.  

Half an hour later, the Verdant Spring Art took effect, drawing spiritual energy toward the sapling in visible waves. Seeing this, Chu Ning finally relaxed.  

He stepped out of the Ironvine canopy and inspected it carefully, satisfied that unless someone deliberately searched, no one would notice this rare spirit plant hidden in his backyard.  

As for why he hadn’t planted it in the spirit field—first, the fields weren’t technically within the sect’s protective formation.  

Second, Zhuang Yunde had mentioned that He Changyou, the supervisor of the Spirit Plant Hall, occasionally inspected the Ink Spirit Bamboo. Chu Ning worried that planting it there might draw unwanted attention.  

In contrast, his backyard was rarely visited. Aside from Qiu Shunyi and Zhuang Yunde, few ever sought him out. His neighbor, Qi Chongmao, was often around, but their interactions were limited to the fields or outside their courtyards. Neither had ever entered the other’s residence.  

Cultivators, it seemed, naturally preferred to keep their training spaces private.  

In the following days, Chu Ning lived a reclusive life, shuttling only between his courtyard and the spirit fields. He devoted himself to nurturing the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, tending to the Ink Spirit Bamboo and spirit rice, and cultivating the Evergreen Wood Art, Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique, and a few spells.  

Three months passed in the blink of an eye. During this time, Qiu Shunyi invited him on several outings, all of which Chu Ning declined. Zhuang Yunde visited once to inform him that his recommendation had been approved and handed him a manual on talisman paper crafting. Once the Ink Spirit Bamboo matured, Chu Ning could begin producing talisman paper.  

Meanwhile, his two spirit plants were nearing harvest.  

One morning, after completing his daily cycles of the Evergreen Wood Art and Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique, Chu Ning inspected the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit tree.  

The tree now resembled the one he had seen in Old Man Sun’s yard. Its leaves displayed vivid rainbow hues, and small green fruits had begun to form—seven in total, as was characteristic of the species.  

Unlike Old Man Sun’s tree, however, these fruits were smaller but more intensely colored. Chu Ning could clearly sense their superior quality, likely due to the Verdant Spring Art’s early and consistent application.  

For a hundred days, he had cast the Verdant Spring Art ten times daily on the tree, never using it for his own cultivation despite its superior spiritual energy absorption compared to the Ink Spirit Bamboo. Instead, he practiced in another corner of the courtyard, relying on the Ironvine.  

"Another three months, and the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit should ripen," Chu Ning estimated.  

With that, he headed out. While the spirit fruit still needed time, the spirit rice and Ink Spirit Bamboo were ready for harvest—especially the rice, which could wait no longer.  

As he walked, Chu Ning checked his cultivation progress in his mind:  

**[Evergreen Wood Art (Yellow Grade, Low Tier), Second Layer (167/900)]**  
**[Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique, First Volume, Indestructible Skin (97/300)]**  

Three months of dedicated practice had yielded clear advancements in both his cultivation and body refinement. The Evergreen Wood Art progressed steadily, with Chu Ning now in the late stages of the fourth level of Qi Refinement. He sensed that reaching 200 proficiency in the second layer would mark the peak of the fourth level, preparing him for the breakthrough to the fifth.  

"The second layer’s progression isn’t as evenly distributed as the early stages. Could it be 200 for the fourth level, 300 for the fifth, and 400 for the sixth?" he mused. The total would then neatly add up to 900. Only time would tell.  

Surprisingly, the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique proved less challenging than expected. Despite spending less time on it than the Evergreen Wood Art—and lacking the boosts from his Yin Wood Spirit Body and Verdant Spring Art—his proficiency increased by nearly one point per day.  

"Am I naturally suited for body refinement?" Chu Ning wondered briefly before dismissing the thought. Aside from his affinity for wood-element techniques, he saw no exceptional talent in other areas.  

His Thorn Art and Vine Armor Art had reached instant-casting levels, but progress in other spells was sluggish. The Golden Sword Art advanced at a snail’s pace, making him consider abandoning it as inefficient.  

Basic spells like Nourishing Rain Art, Blade Edge Art, and Fireball Art—along with the newly learned Drying Art for talisman paper—remained at rudimentary levels. With limited energy, Chu Ning prioritized only the essentials, focusing more on the Drying Art for future use.  

After checking the Ink Spirit Bamboo (which needed a few more days), Chu Ning moved on to the middle-grade spirit field where his Scarlet Spirit Rice grew.  

Just as he left the upper-grade field, he encountered a group of people on the path, pausing in surprise.
