# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass  
Chapter 134: Soundwave Technique  

Gazing at the retreating figure, the Dwarf Sage Miao revealed a mocking smile. Twirling a strange plant in his hand, he sneered coldly, "Zhang Taibai, do you really think you can walk away unscathed after making a deal with us? Especially since the Seaweed of Endless Blue has already been taken by the Demon Lord..."  

Under the moonlight, his grotesque face grew even more sinister.  

After a brief contemplation, the Dwarf Sage took out a formation disk and formation flags from his robes and began setting up an array around him.  

In less than fifteen minutes, an eerie formation took shape.  

Though it hadn't been activated yet, Lin Xuan could already sense the dense, malevolent aura emanating from it.  

This was undoubtedly an evil demonic formation!  

Pleased with his handiwork, the Dwarf Sage smirked before retrieving a peculiar orb from his storage pouch. He exhaled a breath of spiritual energy onto it.  

Instantly, several beams of radiant light shot from the orb and merged into the newly laid formation. A surge of mist billowed forth, concealing all traces of the sinister aura.  

The Dwarf Sage then formed hand seals and began chanting incantations under his breath. Gradually, his figure faded into obscurity...  

Witnessing this scene and recalling his earlier conversation with the Taibai Sword Immortal, Lin Xuan had no trouble deducing that the Dwarf Sage was planning to ambush Fairy Ouyang.  

What should he do?  

Lin Xuan's initial instinct was to flee as far as possible—whatever conflicts existed between the Bìyún Mountain and the Extreme Demon Cave were none of his concern. He had no desire to get entangled in a battle between Core Formation cultivators.  

Yet, leaving now was not an option. If he tried to escape, he would undoubtedly be discovered, and the demonic cultivator would not hesitate to silence him permanently.  

After a moment of hesitation, Lin Xuan decided to wait and observe.  

Soon after, a streak of blue light appeared on the horizon, swiftly approaching.  

Within the radiance was Fairy Ouyang Qinxin, her peerless beauty unmistakable. She glanced around, a flicker of doubt crossing her face. Her senior brother Taibai had summoned her here for an important discussion, yet he was nowhere to be seen.  

After a brief hesitation, she descended and began walking forward cautiously. Seeing this, the hidden Dwarf Sage's face lit up with glee—she was about to step into his "Bone Yin Malice Formation."  

Lin Xuan also saw this and quickly weighed his options. In an instant, he made his decision and called out, "Fairy Ouyang, be careful! Don't take another step forward!"  

The sudden warning startled Fairy Ouyang, freezing her foot mid-step.  

A moment later...  

Eerie wails erupted as thick mist surged from the ground ahead. A massive skeletal hand emerged from within.  

---  

Witnessing this, Fairy Ouyang's delicate brows arched, but she remained composed. Opening her lips, she expelled a streak of cold light that struck the skeletal hand while she swiftly ascended into the air.  

Lin Xuan exhaled in relief and immediately fled his hiding spot. Almost simultaneously, a dark green energy ball crashed into the boulder behind him, reducing it to rubble.  

*Thank goodness I reacted quickly,* Lin Xuan thought, heart pounding.  

His decision to warn Fairy Ouyang wasn't driven by righteousness or some foolish sense of chivalry—it was purely self-preservation.  

After careful consideration, Lin Xuan realized that since he had stumbled upon this situation, remaining completely uninvolved was impossible.  

Attempting to sneak away would expose him.  

The alternative was to stay hidden and watch the battle unfold. But both Fairy Ouyang and the Dwarf Sage were Core Formation experts, capable of earth-shaking feats. Once they clashed, the aftermath would be catastrophic.  

Given how close he was, avoiding collateral damage would be nothing short of a miracle.  

If he were forced to reveal himself later, both sides would view him as an enemy, sealing his fate.  

Thus, it was better to pick an ally now.  

The demonic cultivator was out of the question—he would never let a witness to his schemes live.  

As for Fairy Ouyang, though Lin Xuan didn't know her well, they had crossed paths before. She struck him as proud but fair—someone who would remember a favor.  

Warning her about the ambush should earn him enough goodwill.  

---  

Furious that his plan had been ruined, the Dwarf Sage's face twisted with rage, his eyes bloodshot as he glared at the cultivator who had foiled his scheme.  

A mere Foundation Establishment youth, barely twenty years old.  

Amid his anger, the Dwarf Sage was also puzzled. The boy must have been hiding here before his arrival—how had a Foundation Establishment cultivator evaded his spiritual sense?  

*Damn it! Just one more step!*  

Because Fairy Ouyang hadn't fully entered the Bone Yin Malice Formation, the skeletal hand had only manifested a fraction of its power. Otherwise, she would have been trapped already.  

Though the Dwarf Sage was at the mid-Core Formation stage—a tier above Fairy Ouyang's early Core Formation—he had heard of her formidable Soundwave Technique, which far surpassed others of her rank.  

Not daring to underestimate her, he had set up the ambush. Now, Lin Xuan had ruined everything.  

---  

In contrast, Fairy Ouyang was deeply relieved. Glancing at the sinister formation beneath her, she shuddered. Though she didn't recognize the demonic trickery, the overwhelming malice radiating from it spoke volumes about its lethality.  

She cast a grateful glance at the young man beside her before hardening her expression and fixing her gaze on the ugly old man rising from below.  

A demonic cultivator!  

Upon sensing his cultivation level, her eyes flickered with surprise, and her expression grew graver.  

No words were exchanged—the ambush had already shattered any pretense of civility.  

The Dwarf Sage shot Lin Xuan one last venomous look before focusing entirely on Fairy Ouyang. To him, the boy was merely an annoyance—a Foundation Establishment ant he could crush at his leisure.  

With his ambush foiled, he had no choice but to attack head-on.  

Reaching into his robes, he summoned a bizarre treasure shrouded in black mist, its true form obscured. The pressure it exuded made Lin Xuan's heart race—this was the might of a magic treasure, leagues above mere spirit artifacts.  

Lin Xuan quietly retreated further, layering himself with defensive measures: a spiritual shield, several mid-grade talismans, his flower-patterned defensive artifact, and a small bell he had looted from the Spirit Medicine Mountain's treasury.  

The dazzling display briefly drew the attention of both combatants before they refocused on each other.  

Now shielded, Lin Xuan settled in to watch the battle unfold.  

Fairy Ouyang's killing intent swelled as she faced the demonic cultivator.  

Taibai Sword Immortal was absent, replaced by a powerful demonic ambush. Though she couldn't be certain her senior brother had betrayed her, something was clearly amiss.  

With a frosty expression, she flipped her palm, summoning an exquisite golden harp.  

Seeing this, the Dwarf Sage formed a hand seal, and the mist-cloaked treasure emitted a mournful wail. The black fog expanded rapidly, engulfing a radius of several dozen feet.  

Fairy Ouyang wouldn't let him act unimpeded—she was facing a mid-Core Formation opponent, after all!  

Cradling the harp, her jade-like fingers plucked the strings, filling the air with enchanting music. Yet Lin Xuan had no mind to appreciate it—his face paled with dread.  

This was the legendary Soundwave Technique!  

Beneath the melody lay deadly intent. As the music played, countless golden needles materialized in the sky—not light, but spiritual energy condensed into tangible projectiles.  

Tens of thousands of them!  

Lin Xuan inhaled sharply. His own Ice Needle Technique paled in comparison—this was child's play next to Fairy Ouyang's mastery.  

*Pluck!*  

Another note rang out, and the golden needles surged toward the Dwarf Sage like a tempest.  

Yet the demonic cultivator showed no fear. Forming an intricate seal, he pointed at his treasure and shouted, "*Strike!*"  

The black mist churned violently, spinning like a tornado and unleashing countless wind blades.  

Golden needles and wind blades collided midair, filling the sky with a cacophony of metallic clashes.  

Light flashed wildly as spiritual energy erupted in all directions. Witnessing the battle between two Core Formation experts, Lin Xuan's eyes gleamed with fascination.  

Yet as he studied the Dwarf Sage's twisted expression, an uneasy premonition crept into his heart—though strangely, the foreboding didn't seem to stem from the demonic cultivator before him.
