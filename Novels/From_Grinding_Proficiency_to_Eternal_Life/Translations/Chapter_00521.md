# Chapter 521: The Path to Proving the Dao with Golden Core

Above Cold Crow Pass, the insidious and sharp killing intent of Nirvana was suddenly cleared.

This marvelous technique was executed with such finesse that it dissolved the Great Awakening Bodhisattva’s finger strike into nothingness. This was enough to show that True Lord Qingyuan’s cultivation was a notch above that of the Great Awakening Bodhisattva.

On the Eastern Wasteland, the Great Awakening Bodhisattva’s expression shifted slightly. He hadn't expected True Lord Qingyuan to strike first despite acting later, blocking his Flower-Plucking Finger.

“Bald donkey, picking on the weak—is this how your Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land teaches you?”

True Lord Qingyuan’s expression was icy cold. Immortal Palace’s pure qi swirled around him, making him look like a banished immortal descending to the mortal world.

He said coolly, “Bald donkey, picking on the weak—is this how your Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land teaches you? A mere competition for the Golden Core throne, and you, of such seniority, must personally descend to tear all pretense aside?!”

Facing True Lord Qingyuan, the flicker of displeasure at being blocked on the Great Awakening Bodhisattva’s face instantly vanished, returning to the tranquility of an ancient, undisturbed well.

His opponent was stronger than him, but the Great Awakening Bodhisattva was not made of mud either.

Killing a Golden Core True Lord was no easy feat.

He chanted a Buddhist name, his voice grand and solemn, rumbling through space.

“Amitabha, this fiend is a demon of the Primordial Demon Sect, harboring malicious intentions. He now seeks to steal the Dao Fruit, and his demonic flame burns even fiercer. To slay this fiend and cleanse the cosmos, to return a clear and bright world to the heavens—this is an act to uphold the righteous path of humanity. To speak of picking on the weak is merely the sophistry of a demon! To slay demons and eliminate evil, what does it matter who is senior or junior?”

His words were filled with righteous indignation, as if he himself were the embodiment of justice. Any means used against the Primordial Origin Sect were endowed with unquestionable legitimacy.

“Hahahaha!”

True Lord Qingyuan, upon hearing this, was not angered but laughed in exasperation. His laughter was filled with undisguised mockery and disdain.

“A clear and bright world? The righteous path of humanity? Wonderful! Truly wonderful!”

He clapped his hands lightly.

“The world says my Primordial Origin Sect is selfish, believing in the law of the jungle, that the strong prey on the weak. Indeed, our sect puts profit first in all our actions, seizing the opportunities of heaven and earth to benefit ourselves. Our methods may be considered ruthless. But at least we know what we are doing. Whether we are demons or on the Dao, we are open and aboveboard—we own it.”

His tone shifted. “But you bald donkeys of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land… hehe, chanting Amitabha with every mouth, speaking of compassion in every sentence, yet doing the most insidious and vicious things. You point fingers and call others demons, forcibly imposing karma and forcibly delivering all living beings, carving the words ‘hypocrisy’ into your very bones. When it comes to crooked paths and evil ways, when it comes to those twisted, filthy, and sinister thoughts, this Lord believes your Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land is the undisputed champion. The more you pretend to be dignified and solemn on the surface, the more likely it is that you have already entered the demonic path without realizing it. My Primordial Origin Sect should take your Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land as the Demonic Land. You claim to be building a Buddhist kingdom on earth, but what you truly want is a demonic kingdom on earth.”

These words, which struck at the heart, pointed directly at the hypocritical nature of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land’s foundation, piercing through the naked掠夺 intentions beneath their banner of morality.

Under True Lord Qingyuan’s sharp, almost venomous curses, the Great Awakening Bodhisattva’s expression finally ceased to be like an undisturbed well.

However, it did not show a trace of anger, but rather a deeper, colder hue, as if the disguise of a Buddhist statue had been stripped away, revealing a hard, non-gold, non-stone essence within.

There was no change of shame or anger on his face at being exposed. Only a deep chill, enough to freeze the soul, brewed within his emotionless tranquility.

“Demon, with your clever words, slandering the Buddha and blaspheming the saints—your sins are compounded!”

The Great Awakening Bodhisattva’s voice lost its previous grandeur and solemnity, becoming unnaturally flat and devoid of emotion, yet it carried a heart-palpitating pressure.

“Today, I shall send you to the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss to atone for your sins!”

It was somewhat improper for him to be talking while the other Bodhisattvas were fighting desperately against the True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Before his words had faded, the Great Awakening Bodhisattva struck with ferocious resolve.

He raised his withered hand and pressed it flatly towards True Lord Qingyuan’s position.

*Boom!*

It was like a silent thunderclap exploding on the level of rules.

The sky over the entire Eastern Wasteland battlefield suddenly darkened. The wind and clouds were instantly torn and kneaded by an invisible, great force. The long sky detonated, groaning under the unbearable strain.

Centered on him, a terrifying aura that suppressed heaven and earth and made all things bow their heads swept out.

*Om! Ma! Ni! Ba! Mi!吽!*

A grand Sanskrit chant that shook the universe rang out, as if thousands of Buddhas were speaking at the same time.

In the center of the churning weather, behind the Great Awakening Bodhisattva, ten thousand zhang of golden light shone, and a colossal phantom of a Buddha, which seemed to prop up the sky and support the earth, suddenly manifested.

The Buddha’s eyes were cast down, his face a weave of compassion and majesty. The endless Buddhist light contained the terrifying power to forcibly convert and erase self-awareness, pouring down like a celestial river reversing its flow.

The phantom of the Buddha slowly raised its palm, chanting boundless Buddhist sounds, carrying the supreme will to convert all, to make all beings submit.

“Lay down the butcher’s knife, and you shall become a Buddha on the spot!”

Facing this terrifying Buddhist light and Sanskrit chant, which were enough to twist one’s will and forcibly wash away the soul’s true self, the pure qi of the Immortal Palace around True Lord Qingyuan surged violently. The misty immortal light condensed into a solid form, transforming into a pillar of pure qi that connected the heavens and the earth. It firmly protected the space around him, completely blocking the power of conversion that sought to erode his mind.

Within the pillar of light, True Lord Qingyuan’s face was as cold as ten-thousand-year-old ice.

“Demonic monk, these petty tricks—you dare to show off your skills before an expert?”

A furious shout, like a command from heaven and earth.

True Lord Qingyuan said no more. The magical power within him erupted without reservation, stirring the winds and clouds for ten thousand miles. With a lift of his hand, he unleashed a peerless immortal light, so condensed it almost tore through the void. Carrying the supreme will to purify all laws and bring order to the cosmos, he fiercely bombarded the giant, sky-shrouding Buddha’s palm.

At the same time, above Cold Crow Pass.

Within the core of the Xuanhuang pillar that drew upon the ten thousand earth veins and surged with turbid malevolence.

Chu Chengnan seemed completely unaware of the dangers outside. His aura was undergoing a terrifying transformation.

The Xuanhuang turbid malevolence pillar surrounding him contracted and solidified. It was no longer gaseous, but seemed to transform into a liquid, flowing Xuanhuang琉璃 (glass).

Behind him, a massive, indistinct mountain phantom, radiating an aura of boundless heaviness and eternal stillness, was rapidly coalescing.

The silhouette of the mountain gradually became clear, formed by the superposition of countless miniature mountain shadows.

It was the condensed will of the ten million peaks whose earth-vein essence he had shifted and extracted.

This was the nascent form of his Dao Fruit, the “Immovable Xuan Mountain” Dao Fruit.

Beside him, Xu Yunfan had already completely put his mind at ease. Since the power at the Golden Core True Lord level had been intercepted by a True Lord from the Primordial Origin Sect, he only needed to ensure that this sword light did not break free from the缠绕 of the Eight Scenery Primordial Qi.

If any other power were to come, Xu Yunfan could only say he was powerless to help.

He was no peerless genius who could fight multiple opponents alone.

In this way, he had plenty of spare attention to focus on Chu Chengnan’s quest to prove the Dao with a Golden Core.

“Can he really prove himself a True Lord…”

Xu Yunfan couldn’t help but mutter to himself.

Having spent so many years in the Taidang Spirit Ruins World, he was naturally aware that the last time someone proved the Dao and became a True Lord was a thousand years ago, with the Pure Yang Ancestor of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

From then until now, there had indeed been many Great Realists at the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm who intended to seek the Golden Core and prove the Dao, hoping to attract the grace of a Dao Fruit.

Unfortunately, without exception, they had all failed.
