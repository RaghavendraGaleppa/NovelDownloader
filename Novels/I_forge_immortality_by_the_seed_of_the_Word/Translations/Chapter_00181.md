# Chapter 178: Ninth-Grade Foundation Establishment, Comparable to Royalty

A vast expanse of darkness stretched before Zhang Jing's eyes.

The black Xun wind had solidified into an ink-like sea, its roaring waves rising to terrifying heights as they surged toward him. The air was filled with the most piercing, mournful howls.

Within his protective glow, Zhang Jing's eyes flickered slightly as his gaze swept over a struggling cultivator not far away. Like him, this person had just entered this black Xun wind sea, yet their protective spiritual light was already flickering precariously.

"Such powerful Xun wind! These cultivators are clearly not weak, yet they're struggling so miserably against it," Zhang Jing mused.

The moment he had entered the sky, he had sensed something unusual. After just a few blows from this black Xun wind, his own protective spiritual light had begun to waver and dim rapidly.

This wasn't Zhang Jing's first encounter with Xun wind. Whether it was when Feng Wuyu had brought him from the lower realms to the Qingxiao Xuanming Heaven or during his subsequent training within the Dao Sect, he had experienced all kinds of Xun winds. Logically, Xun wind of this level shouldn't have been able to shake his protective light.

Of course, Zhang Jing wasn't worried that this Xun wind would hinder his progress. In truth, if he mobilized his various Dao Intentions, this seemingly boundless Xun wind would be nothing more than a gentle breeze to him—completely harmless.

But...

What was it that made this Xun wind so peculiar, displaying power that defied all reason?

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened as curiosity arose within him.

With this thought, his figure came to an abrupt halt. Slowly, he extended a hand beyond his protective light, reaching toward a wisp of black Xun wind. His fair, slender fingers shimmered with the four Dao Intentions of earth, fire, wind, and water, instantly forming an indestructible cage.

At this moment, the terrifying black Xun wind that others feared and avoided became nothing more than a pitiful, feeble little snake in Zhang Jing's grasp. The snake writhed desperately, but its struggles were in vain.

*Boom!*

His fingers clenched.

Within his palm, the four Dao Intentions merged, giving birth to a faint trace of chaotic energy that instantly crushed the black Xun wind.

Wisps of profound meaning began to emanate.

Behind Zhang Jing's head, a hazy, illusory cloud of auspicious light slowly rose, its five-colored radiance swirling around him. Compared to before, this auspicious cloud now bore a faint golden hue.

...

An unknown amount of time passed.

The Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud behind Zhang Jing's head had long since dissipated. Slowly, he opened his eyes, a glimmer of enlightenment and joy flashing within them.

"This Xun wind actually contains a trace of water-attribute Dao Intention," he realized. The combination of wind and water had endowed the Xun wind with the penetrating, erosive power unique to water, amplifying its might exponentially.

"Wind begets water, water rises with wind!" Zhang Jing felt as though a new door had opened in his mind.

This was different from his previous method of forcibly merging Dao Intentions using the jade talisman. Instead, it was another path to Dao Intention fusion—one that didn't rely on the jade talisman's power but rather on a cultivator's deeper comprehension and understanding of Dao Intentions.

Or perhaps, it was a profound grasp of the principles governing heaven and earth.

The fusion of wind and water within this Xun wind alone struck Zhang Jing as incredibly profound.

Suddenly, he looked up, his gaze seemingly piercing through the endless sea of Xun wind to the layers of Yin fire, scarlet lightning, and yellow sand above.

"By that logic, those layers must also contain different paths of Dao Intention fusion," he mused, his eyes brimming with anticipation.

These layers of obstacles were, in Zhang Jing's eyes, the best teachers—ones that would unreservedly reveal the deeper principles hidden within Dao Intention fusion.

With this thought, he transformed into a streak of bright light, shooting upward.

The Yin fire layer!

The scarlet lightning layer!

The yellow sand layer!

Just as Zhang Jing had predicted, the essence of the power permeating each layer was the interweaving of multiple Dao Intentions and principles. This was why their might far exceeded their inherent limits.

And these realizations brought Zhang Jing endless inspiration.

A thousand zhang above the Human Talent Island, tens of thousands of cultivators stood silently in neat formations, as if separated by an invisible wall. Their eyes were fixed on the dozens of figures ahead, their gazes filled with deep wariness.

"Something's wrong. They followed that woman's path exactly, so why did they still get lost halfway?" someone exclaimed, their voice tinged with disbelief.

"Could they have remembered it wrong?" another muttered nervously.

The situation wasn't unfolding as they had imagined.

At that moment, a dazzling golden streak of light shot up from below. Without slowing in the slightest, it plunged into the thousand-zhang stretch of bizarre space beneath Human Talent Island.

To everyone's astonishment, the golden light traversed the distance effortlessly before vanishing into the island. Its aura was no less imposing than that of the mysterious woman from before.

For several breaths, the crowd stood frozen in stunned silence.

"Who... was that?" a hoarse voice finally broke the stillness, but no one answered.

In a
