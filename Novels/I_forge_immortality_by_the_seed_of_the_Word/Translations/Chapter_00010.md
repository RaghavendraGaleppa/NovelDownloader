# Chapter 10: Well Done!

The warm current in his abdomen gradually dissipated.

To confirm it wasn't just his imagination, Zhang Jing picked up another piece of translucent spirit beast meat from the jade plate before him.

That indescribably wondrous aroma wafted out again, making his mouth water uncontrollably.

Perhaps this meat had been steeped in spiritual energy for long, or maybe the Spirit Canteen had some special technique—the texture was now exquisitely tender, as if it would melt into rich juices with just a touch of his tongue.

After a few chews, the spirit beast meat transformed into sweet liquid that Zhang Jing swallowed easily.

"So it's true!" Zhang Jing's eyes lit up.

As expected, another warm current rose in his abdomen, continuously replenishing his vital energy. In moments, he felt his depleted mental energy recover significantly.

"Brother Ji, do you usually eat this spirit beast meat?" Zhang Jing asked while wolfing down large mouthfuls, suppressing his astonishment.

"Indeed. Does Brother Zhang find it to his taste?" Ji Bochang nodded, his lips curling into an unconscious grin as he answered with feigned nonchalance. His painted fan, now inexplicably open, fluttered gently—exuding an air of affected elegance.

"Very much so!" Zhang Jing replied without looking up, as if oblivious to Ji Bochang's mannerisms. His chopsticks became a blur.

"Good to hear."

With that, Ji Bochang also picked up his chopsticks—only to freeze mid-motion the next second.

His small eyes fixed on the nearly depleted spirit beast meat, facial muscles twitching involuntarily. Finally, he chuckled wryly and put the chopsticks away.

Opposite him, Zhang Jing wiped his mouth and sighed, "No wonder Instructor holds you in such high regard. With daily spirit beast meat and your existing familiarity with visualization practice, passing the assessment would be harder to fail."

"Brother Zhang, passing through sheer talent alone is already remarkable," Ji Bochang consoled.

"Speaking of which," Zhang Jing's tone turned serious as he eyed the remaining meat, "how much are you planning to increase the wager in spirit stones?"

Ji Bochang gave him a surprised look before replying thoughtfully, "That depends on how much Wu Mingyuan—ahem, our generous patron—can offer. Rumor has it he's quite wealthy. I estimate we could push it to thirty spirit stones."

"Thirty stones..." Zhang Jing murmured, recalling the meat's price earlier. His expression turned pensive. "Fifteen for me would suffice for spirit beast meat, but time is of the essence..."

Now certain that the meat could restore mental energy, it meant more daily proficiency gains—possibly enough to master visualization within seven days. Provided he had the stones.

After a moment's deliberation, Zhang Jing said solemnly, "Brother Ji, I've an imposition to ask."

"Name it. If within my means, I shan't refuse," Ji Bochang replied earnestly, snapping his fan shut.

"You mentioned splitting the wager earlier. How about this—lend me ten stones today, and you can keep all future winnings."

Ji Bochang's face fell. "By rights, this favors me, and I shouldn't decline, but..." He smiled ruefully. "Truth be told, I forgot to bring stones when coming to the academy. The few I had went to lodging and meals here. That's why I sought you today—to recoup losses from Wu Mingyuan."

Scratching his head, he added, "Perhaps wait until after the assessment? My family can send more then."

After the assessment? That'd be too late. Concealing his disappointment, Zhang Jing rose. "No matter. Thank you regardless. I'll take my leave."

"Safe travels," Ji Bochang stood.

Back in the canteen, watching Zhang Jing depart, Ji Bochang ordered another serving of spirit beast meat and mused, "Why the urgency for stones? The meat?" Suddenly, realization dawned. "He's confident of passing yet needs the meat... meaning he aims for a Grade C evaluation?!"

A sharp inhale. "His talent exceeds my estimates. Well, the gap between Grades C and D is vast—no wonder. In that case..." His eyes gleamed. "But who has stones to spare now?"

"Wu Mingyuan!"

"Why bring me here? I've no appetite," Chu Lingyun said coolly to Wu Mingyuan.

"Lingyun, I procured some Green Immortal Sparrow meat—a spirit beast—and had it specially prepared," Wu Mingyuan explained, wounded.

Sighing, Chu Lingyun demurred, "Mingyuan, my focus is cultivation now. Oh? Is that Brother Bochang?"

Spotting Ji Bochang, her pace quickened. Wu Mingyuan trailed behind helplessly, watching his 'future partner' rush to his rival.

Left with no choice, he followed—only to scowl as the two conversed animatedly. Suddenly, he exclaimed loudly, "Ah, Brother Bochang! About our wager—given today's lecture, your 'Brother Zhang' seems unlikely to pass. Admit defeat now, and I'll void it. What say you?"

Ji Bochang froze. He'd been pondering how to broach the subject and raise the stakes without suspicion—yet here was Wu Mingyuan serving it up on a platter, complete with perfect timing.

Well done indeed!

Eyes glinting, Ji Bochang glanced 'furtively' at Chu Lingyun before declaring, "Lose? Never!" Then, as if steeling himself, he gritted out, "Let's raise it to fifty stones!"

"Fifty? That's two Pure Essence Pills!" Chu Lingyun gasped.

"Done! You can't back out now!" Wu Mingyuan crowed, convinced it was a bluff.

"Brother Wu, could we—"

"No! Would you go back on your word?" Wu Mingyuan's triumphant grin was unmistakable.
