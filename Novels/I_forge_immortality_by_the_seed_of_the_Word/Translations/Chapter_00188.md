# Chapter 185: Dao Intent Fusion, Mountains and Rivers in Splendor

"G-g-great... Fellow Daoist, please enlighten me!" The burly man, transformed from the Goat Demon, nervously looked at Zhang Jing opposite him, forcing down the fear in his heart. He gritted his teeth and spoke in a deep voice.

Only when truly standing before the opponent did the Mountain-Bearing Mighty Goat Demon finally understand why the Crimson-Eyed Golden Roc had warned him so. Unlike humans, the Myriad Spirits Faction of the Heavens, though called myriad spirits, actually comprised tens of thousands of races. Internal conflicts had almost never ceased. This environment also made them extremely sensitive to danger. Just like the current Mountain-Bearing Mighty Goat Demon. At this moment, it felt its heart and liver trembling. For no other reason. The Goat Demon perceived an extremely terrifying sense of danger from the human named Zhang Jing opposite him. All the brave words it had spoken before the Crimson-Eyed Golden Roc were now long forgotten.

Across from him, "Fellow Daoist, you are too kind," Zhang Jing said with a slight smile.

*Maaa!* The instant his voice fell, the Goat Demon, compelled by the pervasive sense of fear, reluctantly transformed into a yellowish-brown goat, ten zhang tall. The goat's back was highly humped, resembling a towering mountain, emitting waves of heavy aura.

*Thump! Thump! Thump!* Almost the instant it revealed its true form, the Goat Demon lowered its head, exposing its long, knife-sharp horns. A glint of madness flashed in its demonic eyes, and then it swiftly charged towards Zhang Jing, transforming into a dark yellow blur too fast for the eye to follow. In just a blink, the opponent had already crossed the less-than-thousand-zhang arena, appearing before Zhang Jing, stirring up gusts of fierce wind.

Standing still, Zhang Jing slightly raised his head. In his deep, unmoving black pupils, the silhouette of a gigantic goat rapidly expanded. Another powerful creature from the Myriad Spirits Faction of the Heavens. And... it seemed to be a race naturally aligned with the Dao of Earth and the Dao of Strength. No! It seemed there was also the Demonic Dao within it.

"A good research subject," Zhang Jing mused. "Perhaps by studying this fellow's power, it could help me integrate earth-attribute Dao Intent and related Dao concepts!" A hint of excitement flickered in his heart. As for the faint trace of true intent from the Demonic Dao lingering around the opponent, he simply ignored it. The Progenitor Demonic Sect delved deeply into this Dao. However, within their Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect, there weren't many related inheritances. In fact, among the three hundred and sixty-five basic Dao Intents, none were related to the Demonic Dao Intent.

His thoughts returned to reality. Zhang Jing's mind stirred. The River of Many Treasures appeared before him. He directly grabbed one end with his hand. In an instant, the Dao Intents of Kun (Earth) and Gen (Mountain) from the Eight Trigrams diffused out, merging with each other, completely dyeing the River of Many Treasures a muddy yellow.

*Whap!* Zhang Jing gave a light flick. The River of Many Treasures immediately stretched horizontally before him, like a majestic mountain range rooted in the boundless earth, exuding an indestructible aura.

Opposite him, the madness in the Mountain-Bearing Mighty Goat Demon's eyes intensified. The fleshy mountain on its back instantly manifested interwoven yellow and black Dao patterns, emitting strands of formidable Dao Intent woven from chaotic demonic intent and boundless, weighty mountain intent. It was as if a true demonic mountain had descended. The next moment, the Goat Demon, carrying boundless power weighing tens of millions of jun, like a rapidly moving mountain, crashed straight into the River of Many Treasures.

*Boom!* A deafening roar instantly echoed in all directions. The River of Many Treasures snapped into two sections. A rainbow light flickered. Zhang Jing, as if performing a shifting-form technique, instantly moved to the opposite direction. He raised his head. His gaze lightly fell upon the two broken sections of the River of Many Treasures, then shifted to the Goat Demon which was shaking its head in place, preparing to turn around.

Zhang Jing's brows furrowed slightly. The Dao of Mountain, the superior Dao of Earth, plus that faint trace of Demonic Dao Intent, and the strange Dao Intent related to strength. After fusing with each other, could such a monstrosity actually appear? A simple fusion of just the Kun and Gen Dao Intents alone was indeed insufficient. What if the Dao Intent of the Five Elements' Earth was added?

After some thought, Zhang Jing slightly beckoned. The two broken sections of the Many Treasures River instantly transformed into a stream of light and returned before him. The river water continuously flowed, instantly restoring it to its original state. However... as if sensing something, Zhang Jing's eyes narrowed slightly. This time, the breaking of the River of Many Treasures seemed to have caused varying degrees of damage to the magic treasure embryos within it.

While he was thinking, the entire arena began to shake violently once more. Zhang Jing couldn't help but look at the opponent. He saw that after the Goat Demon turned around, it was charging towards him again, and the momentum it carried was even greater. It seemed the previous attack had greatly boosted its confidence.

"Interesting!" A faint smile immediately flashed in his eyes. He then no longer concerned himself with the damage to the magic treasure embryos in the River of Many Treasures. At worst, he would just replace them with a new batch after returning. After all, these things weren't particularly valuable in the Dao Sect.

Zhang Jing gripped the River of Many Treasures once more. Above it, the three Dao Intents of Kun, Gen, and Earth began to slowly intertwine, emitting waves of profound aura.

...

Time slowly passed. On the arena, the terrifying clash continued, its momentum incredibly alarming. However, neither side seemed able to prevail over the other. The situation surprisingly reached a subtle stalemate.

At one point, the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud behind his head suddenly burst forth with five-colored spiritual light, scattering golden radiance. Zhang Jing seemed to have understood something. His eyes instantly became exceptionally bright.

"That's it, I've been too stubborn after all. Why have I been blindly trying to accumulate and fuse earth-attribute Dao Intents? What is too rigid easily breaks; only the balance of Yin and Yang constitutes the Great Dao."

"Didn't that Goat Demon also rely on the central Demonic Dao Intent to mediate, only then fully unleashing the profound grandeur of earth and mountain?"

"So... Kun, Gen, Kan, and Ze should complement each other!"

The next instant, Zhang Jing recalled the battered River of Many Treasures. The two Dao Intents of Ze (Marsh/Lake) and Water quietly spread, instantly intertwining and merging with the Kun, Gen, and Earth Dao Intents already present.

"Earth bears all things, mountains rise above it, water resides without bounds, and marshes nourish all living beings."

*Buzz! Buzz!* A hint of nimble and harmonious intent suddenly appeared within the River of Many Treasures. As the river water surged and flowed, it faintly revealed a splendid panorama of the earth's mountains and rivers.

"It's done!" A hint of joy flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. His gaze fell upon the Goat Demon, whose fighting spirit was growing even stronger. He lightly swung the River of Many Treasures in his hand.

In that instant, it was as if a region of mountains and rivers had transformed into a long whip in Zhang Jing's hand, lashing directly towards the opponent.

*Boom—* The air collapsed inch by inch. In a flash of lightning, the River of Many Treasures, spanning hundreds of zhang, lightly landed on the opponent. It appeared nimble and gentle, yet was impossibly heavy.

Under the intense crisis of death, the madness in the Mountain-Bearing Mighty Goat Demon's eyes faded, replaced by a deep fear. A white light flashed. The Goat Demon's figure quietly vanished. Seeing this scene, Zhang Jing was not surprised. He directly retracted the River of Many Treasures, then stood in place, closed his eyes, and quietly savored the insights he had just gained.

On the other side, a portion of the cultivators below, who had finished their arena battles and were watching, couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief. It was finally over! But the next moment, a hint of doubt arose in their hearts. While that Mountain-Bearing Mighty Goat Demon was indeed terrifyingly strong, Zhang Jing, as one of those three individuals, should by no means have been locked in such a drawn-out battle with the opponent. Compared to the other two, whose performances in the arena were practically overwhelming, Zhang Jing's battle here seemed much more 'difficult'.

"Could it be that he has a weakness, and is not skilled at dealing with opponents like the Mountain-Bearing Mighty Goat Demon?" Everyone secretly speculated. A strange light flashed in their eyes.

...

Not far away, the utterly disheveled figure of the Mountain-Bearing Mighty Goat Demon, upon landing, was immediately surrounded by several other creatures from the Myriad Spirits Faction of the Heavens. Their words were quite eager.

"Barbarian, you're good! To be able to entangle with that person for so long! Did you discover his weakness? As brothers of the Myriad Spirits Faction, don't be secretive about it."

"That's right, Goat Demon, tell us quickly!"

"Perhaps when we face him, we can be as impressive as you! Maybe even use this weakness to defeat him!"

Hearing this, the Goat Demon shook its head, the fear in its eyes lingering stubbornly. After some time to compose itself, it said with lingering trepidation: "Don't even think about it. This person's strength is extremely terrifying. We cannot be his opponents. As for defeating him, that's pure delusion!"

"And he—" The Goat Demon hesitated, wanting to speak but holding back. It couldn't help but recall Zhang Jing's terrifying speed of improvement during their recent battle, feeling a succession of incredulous shocks in its heart. How could someone possibly comprehend and fuse such terrifying Dao Intent in the span of a single battle?!

"He must have been toying with me," the Goat Demon thought, somewhat uncertainly.
