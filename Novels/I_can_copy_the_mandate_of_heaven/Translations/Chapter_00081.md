Here is the translated and consolidated chapter:

As I prepare to take my novel, "Cultivating: I Can Copy Fate," to the next level, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my journey as a writer. It's been over a decade since I first started writing on Qidian, and I've come a long way since then. I remember my first time signing a contract with Qidian, and I wrote in my感言 (author's note) that writing had brought color to my gray world and had changed my life.

Ten years later, I've decided to start anew on Qidian, and I'm excited to share "I Can Copy Fate" with my readers. The original title of this book was going to be "Knowing Heaven's Mandate," and it's a story that I've been wanting to tell for a long time. It's not just about a protagonist who gains the ability to copy fate and becomes invincible. Instead, it's a slow-burning story that explores the world of cultivation and the complexities of fate.

The first volume of the book is nearing its end, and I wanted to take a moment to discuss its design and my reflections on the writing process. Some readers have criticized the pace of the story, feeling that it's too slow and that I'm focusing too much on the mundane aspects of the protagonist's life. I understand these criticisms, and I've been reflecting on how to balance the pace of the story with the need to build a rich and immersive world.

The first volume is essentially a story within a story, with a "heaven's mandate" nested within another "heaven's mandate." It's not just about the protagonist's harem or his cultivation journey; it's about the intricate web of fate that connects the characters and the world they inhabit. I've included many details and foreshadowing that may seem unnecessary at first but will become important later on.

One of the key themes of the book is the concept of fate and how it shapes the characters' lives. The protagonist, Li Zhiming, is on a journey to understand his fate and to resist the constraints that it imposes on him. The female characters, including Jiang Yun and Han Li, play important roles in this journey, and their stories are intertwined with Li Zhiming's.

As I look back on the first volume, I realize that I've been trying to create a sense of immersion and authenticity, drawing inspiration from classics like " Mortal Cultivation" and "Great Dao". However, I've also been aware that the pace of the story has been slow, and I've been working to balance the need for detail with the need for momentum.

The second volume will be set in the "Rotating Light Sect," and the third volume will explore a unique "zombie apocalypse" scenario in the cultivation world. The fourth volume will be set in the "Linhai Sect." I have a clear outline for the next four volumes, and I'm excited to see where the story will take me.

As I move forward, I want to assure my readers that I'll be maintaining a consistent update schedule, with a minimum of 8,000 characters per day. I'm committed to telling a compelling story, even if it means taking the time to get it right. As I always say, "True sincerity injects warmth into cold words, and an extraordinary story will transcend the limitations of technique."
