# Chapter 696: Interweaving Thunder and Fire, Dual Paths Achieved

The怒相 (Furious Aspect) on the left had a ferocious expression, its killing intent soaring to the heavens.

It held the Star Spirit Banner, on which the constellations of the heavens flickered and dimmed.

At this moment, the Great Radiance Infinite Dao Fruit already refined by Xu Yunfan within the banner was activated.

A pure and vast holy radiance flowed out from the banner, acting as the most tenacious harmonizing agent and buffer layer, forming a resilient barrier of light within the core region where the thunder and blazing sun collided.

This barrier was essentially the qi of yin-yang harmony, constantly smoothing out the destructive energy turbulence caused by the collision of thunder and fire, neutralizing its violent nature. Meanwhile, the Star Spirit Banner drew in the abundant fire-element essence qi from the Divine Misty Mountain's underground fire eye, continuously replenishing Xu Yunfan's consumption of magical power and sustaining the foundation of this prolonged refinement.

As for the Ice Desert Aspect on the right, its expression was indifferent, embodying the aloofness of the Supreme.

Mystical runes circulated endlessly at its fingertips as it formed the Seal of Lin (Stationarity).

After a Golden Core True Lord manifested their Dharma Form, the Lin state could be independently accessed by Xu Yunfan. He could then use it as an external consciousness, equivalent to attaching a supercomputer. His consciousness transcended the physical, allowing for microscopic control over his own body, the intent-images radiating from him, and by extension, a portion of the surrounding heaven and earth.

In this state, he discarded all emotional interference. His mind became the most precise instrument, using near-cold rationality to precisely regulate the output intensity of every wisp of magical power, the angle and timing of every bolt of thunder, the intensity shifts of the light barrier, and the absorption rate of the underground fire element and the lightning from the ninth heaven.

This ensured that the entire refinement process maintained a ferocity sufficient to melt the Dao Fruit, yet avoided losing control and rebelling against its master.

Every minuscule imbalance in energy was captured and corrected in an instant.

The entire space of the underground fire eye was illuminated with a fantastic, grotesque light.

Outside, there were rolling golden-red molten rocks; inside, there were the purple-gold thunder serpents and crimson tongues of flame that逸出 (emanated) and intertwined around Xu Yunfan's body.

The deafening roars did not come from external sounds, but were the echoes in the void of the terrifying Dao sounds produced by the collision and fusion of the Dao Fruits within his body. They continued day and night, as if forging a star with dual thunder and fire attributes.

Time passed, years flew by.

In this isolated earthly furnace, Xu Yunfan forgot the disputes of the outside world, dedicating all his mind to this refinement, which was fraught with both danger and opportunity.

One year, ten years, thirty years...

The resistance of the blazing sun orb, from its initial violent frenzy, gradually became sluggish and weak.

It was repeatedly forged by billions of thunderbolts. The imprints belonging to the Blazing Sun True Lord and its origin were slowly ground away and purified by the destructive power contained within the Divine Misty Thunder.

During this process, Xu Yunfan could clearly feel the massive amount of merit he had accumulated being consumed, and the favor of the heavens and earth toward him seemed to be declining.

If it were quantified, it would have been around eighty before, but now it was about seventy-five.

In the forty-seventh year of refinement, the red orb finally gave up its struggle in form entirely, transforming into a docilely flowing, golden-red liquid containing exceptionally pure pure-yang fire intent and a portion of the light laws, like molten solar essence gold.

At this moment, the refinement entered its most critical stage.

Deep fusion, where thunder and fire give birth to each other.

The Divine Misty Thunder no longer focused on destruction, but instead drew upon the power of creation, permeating the golden-red liquid thread by thread.

Simultaneously, the pure Li Fire essence and Great Radiance qi within the liquid, guided by the *True Scripture of the Divine Misty Nine Chen Mysterious Firmament Immortality*, actively nourished and strengthened the creative power within the thunder's origin.

Within his Dantian, the purple-gold thunder sea and the golden-red fire sea no longer collided distinctly, but began to slowly rotate and merge. A shadow of a thunder-fire Golden Core, more condensed and brilliant, with its power暴涨 (soaring), gradually became clear. It had the Divine Misty Dao Fruit at its core, wrapped externally by Blazing Sun power, appearing as purple-gold with crimson patterns.

The fiftieth year.

*Hum!*

A clear, resonant Dao sound, as if from the dawn of creation, rang out from within Xu Yunfan's body, instantly spreading throughout the entire Divine Misty Mountain's underground veins. It was about to spread beyond the mountain, but one by one, great arrays were invisibly activated, constantly dissipating and concealing the spreading aura.

The figure sitting cross-legged in the void suddenly opened his eyes. A purple-gold divine light flared within his pupils, and a cluster of golden-red Blazing Sun True Fire flashed and vanished in the depths of his left eye.

A vast, mighty pressure, carrying the might of thunder from the heavens and the aura of burning the eight wastes, erupted like a slumbering ancient fierce beast awakening.

The molten rock within the entire underground fire eye space instantly calmed, as if suppressed by an invisible great force.

The purple-gold, crimson-patterned lightning radiating around his body slowly retracted, eventually completely converging within him.

Xu Yunfan slowly rose, his figure as straight and upright as a pillar supporting the heavens.

The qi around his body was perfectly round and flawless. Beneath his skin, faintly visible purple-gold arcs and Blazing Sun True Fire flowed. With every movement, it seemed as if he contained the power to shatter the heavens and split the earth.

Most importantly, within his inner heaven, the Luminous Flame Blazing Sun Dao Fruit had been completely tamed by him, transformed into his own shape, soaring together with the Divine Misty Dao Fruit.

Because of this, the inner heaven, due to its dual thunder and fire attributes, had become even more violent.

Although the toughness of the inner heaven had advanced to a higher level, Xu Yunfan knew in his heart that if the next Dao Fruit wasn't of a yin attribute to harmonize yin and yang, and he refined another yang attribute Dao Fruit, it would definitely blow him apart.

As for the Great Radiance Infinite Dao Fruit, Xu Yunfan had already treated it as a disposable fuel, adding it to this refinement process.

The result was very satisfactory.

He considered it a lubricant.

With a slight thought, the information from the Attribute Panel appeared in his consciousness.

‘Cultivation Level: 2600

(Remark: The theoretical limit for the early Golden Core stage is approximately 3000-3500, depending on the difference in foundation and cultivation methods.)

Current Stage: Early Golden Core (approaching perfection)’

“Two thousand six...”

Xu Yunfan looked at the number on the panel, feeling the magical power within his body, which was several times more雄厚 (abundant) than before his seclusion, and the more condensed and powerful Dao Fruit origin, and he couldn't help but click his tongue in astonishment.

Furthermore, the Attribute Panel's function of 'once proven, forever proven' allowed him to sense the various subtleties of the Golden Core with every step he took.

With his current strength, he could completely thrash his former self, even two of them.

“It's very impressive... but where exactly is the peak of the early Golden Core stage? It seems I haven't touched that invisible boundary yet.”

He clearly felt that his cultivation level was still slowly increasing with the blending and circulation of the thunder and fire Dao Fruit's power within his body, and he hadn't encountered the so-called bottleneck.

According to the information revealed by Dongming True Lord and his own insights, the true peak of the early Golden Core stage should reach a theoretical limit threshold, and it could not increase further without breaking through to the next realm.

This undoubtedly indicated that he still had a considerable distance to go before reaching that limit.

“No wonder, the path of cultivation is truly more difficult the further one goes. Each increase in realm is like crossing a great chasm between heavens.”

Just the span of a small Golden Core stage was so vast.

He wondered what the mid and late Golden Core stages would be like.

Xu Yunfan felt a sense of awe, but also a longing for higher realms.

He retracted his aura and took a single step, moving from the underground fire eye back to the deepest hall of the Divine Misty Palace.

Xu Yunfan's emergence from seclusion was not deliberately publicized, but the vast aura that erupted briefly and was quickly retracted, though blocked by the great arrays within the Divine Misty Mountain, was enough to make every disciple of the mountain feel it, and all were inexplicably excited.

It seemed the strength of the Divine Misty True Lord had increased once again.

The True Lord's progress in strength meant the foundation of the Divine Misty Peak was more stable, and their backing was more powerful.

The Primordial Origin Sect was like this; everyone was superficial and didn't bother with too much hypocrisy.

Several days after leaving seclusion, Xu Yunfan was in the hall, sorting through the gains from his fifty years of seclusion and planning the next step: to enter the Samsara Sea of Bitterness to seize the Dao Fruit of the Taiyin Dark Flood Dragon.
