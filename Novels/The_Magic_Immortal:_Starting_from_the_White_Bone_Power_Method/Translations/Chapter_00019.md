# Chapter 19: Mid-Grade Artifact Restrictions

The moon waxed and waned.

Over two months had passed.

After arranging with Ning Jingming at the Black River Market to visit Green Bamboo Mountain for medical practice at noon the next day, Wang Chan hurried home.

He bathed, changed into fresh clothes, and groomed himself meticulously. Standing before the mirror, he gave a composed smile—quite dashing indeed.

Then he shut all windows and doors tightly, retreating to his bedroom. After calming his mind, he slowly consumed the [Spirit Nourishing Elixir] and entered deep cultivation.

Three hours later.

Wang Chan's eyes gently opened.

[You cultivated diligently for three hours today. Experience +1]

The virtual notification appeared right on time. Grinning, Wang Chan licked his lips and opened his virtual panel.

Experience: 63  
Artifacts (1/3): Minor Withering-Blooming Needles (Low-grade, Restrictions: 21/21, Restrictions Perfected, Can Be Divinized)

Unable to contain his excitement, he focused his consciousness on the artifact section, immediately prompting a message:

[Minor Withering-Blooming Needles' restrictions have been perfected. Spend 63 experience points to divinize?]

Without hesitation, Wang Chan chose to divinize.

After a delay of two or three breaths, the needle case in his storage bag began to tremble violently and persistently.

Holding his breath, Wang Chan waited, his mind racing.

"Could divinization be about increasing the restriction limit of the [Minor Withering-Blooming Needles]? For example, raising the restriction layers to twenty-seven, reaching the maximum for a low-grade artifact?"

Artifact restrictions, talisman seals, pill patterns, divine marks, and formation arrays—all had upper limits: twenty-seven for low-grade, fifty-four for mid-grade, eighty-one for high-grade, and one hundred eight for supreme-grade.

Within the same grade, more layers meant greater power or effect. Across grades, higher grades naturally surpassed lower ones in power and efficacy.

"Or does it alter or enhance the artifact's abilities?"

"Could it transform the [Minor Withering-Blooming] restrictions into something else?"

Unnoticed, the commotion in the storage bag ceased. Wang Chan's heart suddenly leaped into his throat. His earlier eagerness now gave way to hesitation.

Taking two deep breaths, he slapped the storage bag and retrieved the needle case. With a flick of his sleeve, the case opened, and nine long needles flew out.

They still gleamed silver, their tips sharp as ever.

But upon closer inspection, the silver glow seemed purer and brighter than before.

Their size remained unchanged.

Squinting, Wang Chan picked one up and was immediately surprised.

The needle... was noticeably heavier.

Had the artifact's material changed?

Upon closer examination, it was true—the needle's quality now rivaled that of a mid-grade artifact!

Wang Chan's breathing grew rapid as his divine sense effortlessly penetrated the needle's interior.

Inside, he saw twenty-one alternating green and yellow restrictions, with faint undulations of verdant wood essence and grave yin energy. The restriction patterns appeared no different from before, still at the low-grade level.

"Two months and sixty-three experience points, just to improve the material?"

Wang Chan felt like crying but had no tears. His heart ached unbearably.

Superior material without corresponding restrictions meant the artifact remained low-grade, merely more durable than others of its class.

Gritting his teeth, Wang Chan exhaled slowly and was about to withdraw his divine sense when he froze. Beneath the twenty-one green and yellow restrictions, faint black and white patterns flickered into view.

Startled, he focused—only for the patterns to vanish.

Anxious, Wang Chan waited.

After a couple of breaths, the black and white patterns reappeared.

His divine sense pounced on them like a starving dog on meat.

"This is..."

Instinctively merging his divine sense with the black and white patterns, he channeled three strands of magic power into them. Instantly, the black and white patterns fused with the green and yellow ones, releasing a terrifying pressure from the needle, which abruptly turned black and white.

"Mid-grade artifact restrictions!"

Wang Chan shot to his feet, wanting to shout but momentarily speechless.

...

A sleepless night passed.

By mid-morning the next day, Wang Chan stood in his bathroom, splashing icy spiritual spring water over himself. The chill refreshed him, washing away his fatigue.

Wiping his face, he saw his bloodshot eyes and weary expression in the mirror. Yet, he couldn't help but grin.

He felt terrifyingly strong now—a cold shower was nothing.

Remembering his impending journey, he gulped down another [Spirit Nourishing Elixir] and hurriedly finished washing.

At noon, he was to accompany Ning Jingming to Green Bamboo Mountain for medical practice. From Ning's demeanor, this was an important task.

Yet, since last night, Wang Chan had been utterly absorbed in experimenting with the [Minor Withering-Blooming Needles], losing track of time.

Now pressed for time, he dressed in new green robes and shoes, then dashed down the mountain.

Just a few miles from Black River Market, a black unicorn goat charged toward him. Its blood-red eyes and swift hooves kicked up a gust of wind as it skidded to a halt.

Wang Chan stopped short, sleeves billowing as he stepped back, squinting through the dust.

The goat was a low-grade spirit beast—[Blood-Eyed Goat]—an excellent long-distance mount known for its endurance. Its grilled testicles would probably taste great with spices.

A woman in luxurious court robes sat astride the goat, her beauty mark shining like a star when she smiled.

It was the Beauty Mark Guard. Without her official white armor, she clearly wasn't on duty.

Wang Chan's right sleeve drooped subtly.

"Fellow Daoist Wang!" the beauty mark greeted warmly.

"Fellow Daoist Tian!" Wang Chan replied, inwardly puzzled. The wilderness was vast—why did they keep meeting? Was there some unspeakable fate between them?

"Are you heading to Black River Market to practice medicine?" she asked, shifting back on the goat and patting the space before her in a tantalizing tone. "Come up. I'm tired and visiting Lotus Mountain. Since you live there, why not relax at your cave first? Skip the market."

Wang Chan couldn't believe his ears.

This woman was elegant and dignified, a direct descendant of the Tian family—one of the six major foundation-establishment clans in White Mountain Range.

Her partner, the white-robed cultivator he'd met before, was the heir of the Bai family—the only foundation-establishment lineage in the region.

Foundation-establishment lineages differed from clans in that they had late-stage foundation-establishment experts for generations, with profound heritage. Given the chance, they could ascend to Nascent Soul families.

After discreet inquiries, Wang Chan had broken into a cold sweat. Thankfully, he'd kept his composure that day—otherwise...

Last time, she'd subtly tempted him to remove her armor. Now, she was outright inviting him to sit in front of her—practically in her lap. What kind of man would take such a submissive position?

If anything, he should sit behind her.

More importantly, once they reached his cave alone, with dry wood meeting fierce fire...

Prim and proper in public, wild and uninhibited in private—this woman, tsk tsk... Her background was impeccable, but what was her game?

Wang Chan admitted some temptation, but he knew his place. Even with decent looks and certain... assets, how could he catch the eye of someone like her?

Given her status, she'd seen countless handsome, well-born male cultivators. Why favor a wilderness rogue like him?
