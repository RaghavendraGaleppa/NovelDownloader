# Chapter 201: Falling from the Ninth Heaven!

He stood still on the scar-like mountain path of the rift valley. His tiger's mouth, covered in cracks, stroked the nine-ring mountain-shaking hammer at his waist. Six pairs of the Xuan steel rings had already shattered, and the remaining ring hooks were like the shed fangs of a giant beast. Embedded in the mottled hacking marks on the hammer head were a few pieces of dark blue scales, emitting a cold light in the twilight.

The team behind him wound through the twilight like a dying giant snake.

Twelve wandering swordsmen on the left and right carried丈二 (twelve-foot) beheading sabers. Dark red blood scabs seeped out from under their Xuan iron armor. In the middle, an octogenarian old man leaned on a vulture-wood cane; every three steps, he had to press his hand against his festering waist wound to catch his breath. A woman bringing up the rear held a sleeping infant in her arms.

Apart from the crisp sound of straw shoes crushing gravel, the entire team was silent to the point of being unsettling.

Even a three-year-old child bit hard on the coarse cloth swaddling clothes. Only when the mountain wind passed through the tattered armor would it bring about a few mournful clangs of iron pieces colliding.

Fu Jin looked back, sighing inwardly. He should have gone all out to head to the Divine Weapon Ridge in Qingzhou. At some point, however, he had become the backbone of this group.

He hoped, hoped that the disciples of the Great Roc Squadron of the Sky-Crafting Cave could deliver the message and that someone from the sect would come to support them.

The next moment, Fu Jin dismissed that thought.

Now, aside from the core three provinces of the Nine耀 Sect, most of the other areas of Yanbei were under the control of the Great Qian. Even Yanbei City was in imminent danger.

As the last ray of twilight was swallowed by the depths of the rift valley, the crisp sound of a dry branch snapping suddenly came from somewhere. The cold light of twenty beheading sabers being unsheathed simultaneously startled the ghost-faced bats sleeping on the rock walls.

In the instant the dry branch snapped, Fu Jin's hands had already taken the twin hammers from his waist.

The nine-ring mountain-shaking hammer emitted a buzzing sound as his wrist trembled slightly. The bulging blue veins on Fu Jin's knuckles pressed against the hammer handle, making it creak.

The cold light from the twenty beheading sabers being unsheathed startled the owls perched in the rock crevices.

Fu Jin did not raise his twin hammers; instead, he let them hang at his sides, swaying slightly. The crisscrossing hacking marks on the hammer heads precisely covered his throat and vital points of his heart.

"Commander Lu's snake-shaped sword is half an inch too slow."

Fu Jin stared at the Xuan iron figure walking out of the mist. Three claw marks on the other's left face were a dark red in the twilight, and his eyes held a hint of emotion.

"Back in the Xuan Yue Sect on Cangwu Mountain, the sword in your hand could pierce through three layers of rhinoceros armor. Today, it seems a bit softer."

A light click came from the机括 (mechanism) under Lu Zhaoyang's Xuan iron wrist guard. Seven tungsten steel chains with barbs shot out from the rock walls on both sides. The ends of the chains were not common flying claws used in the martial world, but armor-piercing spikes, standard military equipment.

He took off his crimson cloak and threw it onto the pile of gravel, revealing the Bì'àn纹 (mythical beast) pattern bestowed by the emperor on his chest. He looked at Fu Jin before him, whose face was weathered and hadn't slept for several days.

"Brother Fu, long time no see. I thought you had already died at the Divine Weapon Ridge. When I passed by a few years ago, I even made a special trip to pay my respects."

A hint of a smile appeared on Fu Jin's face. "You were mistaken in your emotions. I'm living quite well."

Lu Zhaoyang was speechless for a moment, then let out a laugh and shook his head slightly. His expression quickly cooled down.

"Brother Fu, the Great Qian controls the territory and has issued a law prohibiting martial arts, forbidding the common folk from possessing martial prowess. The only way out for us martial artists is to join the Great Qian's Net of Law to have a chance at survival. If Brother Fu is willing to hand over this pair of mountain-shaking hammers, the position of the Net of Law's Chief Commander..."

The nine-ring hammer suddenly shot out. The shattered hammer head grazed past Lu Zhaoyang's ear and smashed into a granite rock three zhang away, creating a spiderweb-like crack.

Fu Jin took a half-step back into a horse stance. The hammer handle groaned under the excessive force. "So that's why you slaughtered the martial arts clans of seven provinces? You even count an eighty-year-old woman's foot-binding cloth as a weapon?"

Lu Zhaoyang, who had dodged the hammer head sideways, shifted his feet.

The cold light of the snake-shaped sword being unsheathed was like a viper's tongue, reaching Fu Jin in an instant.

As Lu Zhaoyang stepped forward to attack, the flaw of his slightly lame left leg made Fu Jin's pupils contract sharply. He suddenly remembered the scar left on Lu Zhaoyang's body when they had chased down a pair of bandits together back in the day.

The sword and hammer clashed in an instant.

The sparks from the sword blade scraping against the hammer handle illuminated the bloodshot veins in the corners of his eyes. "The 'Memorial on Prohibiting Martial Arts' personally approved by the Great Qian Emperor is clear: for every blade collected from the common folk, one less battalion of soldiers will die at the border! The world will be a bit more peaceful!"

A cold sneer curled up at the corner of Fu Jin's mouth.

"When did you, Lu Zhaoyang, become a lackey of the Great Qian, speaking with such self-righteousness?"

"Brother Fu, a wise bird chooses its tree to perch on, and a wise man conforms to the times. The current Demon Emperor of Great Zhou has harmed so many common people. Now, the Great Qian has come to cleanse the world and sweep away evil demons. This is what I wish for!"

The next moment, as Lu Zhaoyang's snake-shaped sword got stuck in a crack on the hammer handle, Fu Jin suddenly let go and abandoned the hammer.

The blood-rust-covered nine-ring mountain-shaking hammer fell to the ground. His calloused right hand, however, was like a venomous dragon emerging from its cave, his two fingers precisely jabbing into the Huantiao acupoint of the other's old leg injury. The weak point left by that wolf-tooth arrow years ago was known only to the two of them.

The Xuan iron general grunted and fell to one knee. Fu Jin spun and caught the falling iron hammer. The remaining barbs on the hammer head were already pressed against Lu Zhaoyang's throat.

Twenty paces away, six wandering swordsmen lay dead in a pool of blood. They died still maintaining the posture of holding their beheading sabers crossed. The remaining swordsmen were still roaring, raising their blades to fight the black-armored soldiers of the Great Qian.

"The 'Seven Forms of Breaking the Edge' that you taught me, it seems you haven't forgotten it all."

Fu Jin gasped for breath and tore off half of his tattered shirt, binding the mountain-shaking hammer firmly to the tiger's mouth of his right hand.

Without the slightest hesitation, he swung it down towards Lu Zhaoyang's head.

Clang!

A giant axe flew out from the depths of the forest, cutting down several trees as thick as a person's embrace.

As the tungsten steel axe blade split the air, Fu Jin's arms had already formed a 'Supporting the Heavens' stance, raising the mountain-shaking hammer to meet it.

The two weapons collided, exploding with a muffled sound like a meteor hitting the ground. The muscles on Fu Jin's arms instantly swelled with blood vessels as thick as green pythons. The linen wrist guards tore apart piece by piece. The remaining steel rings on the nine-ring hammer suddenly exploded collectively. The mountain-shaking hammer emitted a deathbed hum.

The hammer handle bent into a hideous arc under the heavy pressure of the axe blade. The one hundred and twenty catties of Xuan iron was actually shaken out of his hand and flew sideways. It crashed through three rock pillars along the way before violently embedding itself into the mountainside. The cracks on the hammer head were like lightning tearing through the night sky.

Fu Jin stumbled back seven steps, his back plowing a half-foot-long trench in the rock wall.

Black blood mixed with fragments of his internal organs gushed from his throat and splattered all over the ground.

When the dust settled, the宣花 giant axe wrapped in an iron chain was stuck in the rocky ground ten paces away.

Standing on the end of the axe handle was a giant of a man wearing only half a body of iron armor. The exposed muscles on his right shoulder were knotted like the roots of an old tree. Every time a muscle contracted, it emitted a sound like a bowstring being pulled tight.

When he landed on the axe handle, the gravel within a three-zhang radius actually jumped up half an inch.

"Damn it, you've delayed me for so many things."

Tuoba Lie looked at Lu Zhaoyang lying on the ground, trying to struggle to his feet, and spat on the ground, his words full of grumbling.

"I don't know what the Emperor is thinking, actually wanting to recruit these martial artists who are as weak as chicken chicks."

He slowly straightened up, looking at Fu Jin, who had completely lost his fighting ability at his feet, and curled his lip. As the宣花 giant axe in his hand was about to fall, his expression suddenly changed.

He looked up towards the sky above.

A sharp, roaring sound suddenly exploded from overhead. Then, they saw a figure as red as a meteor rapidly falling downwards.
