# Chapter 17: Master Huoyuan

Yang Ji's intention to buy an alchemy furnace and spirit herbs immediately made Jin Dafu's face light up with a smile again. Yang Ji naturally knew what was on his mind. A battle of wits and words ensued, and their exchange quickly concluded.

It was a low-grade alchemy furnace named Four Directions Furnace. Its front, back, left, and right sides each had a smooth, reflective surface made from high-temperature resistant Celestial Crystal Stone. Celestial Crystal Stone could absorb the high heat of flames, increasing the success rate of concocting pills, and its polished surface allowed one to observe the pill refining process inside the furnace. If any issues arose, adjustments could be made in time. The Four Directions Furnace was decent and cost a total of one thousand spirit stones. Yang Ji also purchased ten sets of spirit herbs for refining low-grade Spirit Radiance Pills, each costing two hundred spirit stones, totaling two thousand. Adding the one thousand spirit stones for the furnace, and deducting another one thousand for the Water-Striding Boat, Yang Ji now had three thousand six hundred and fifty spirit stones remaining.

With everything prepared, Yang Ji followed Jin Dafu's directions and walked alone towards the cave behind Myriad Treasures Pavilion. After walking about a li along a path paved with bluestone, Yang Ji arrived at the foot of a cliff. At its base was a stone cave about a zhang high, with faint red light flickering within, and the air blowing out carried a trace of heat. It clearly contained terrestrial fire, just as Jin Dafu had described. Yang Ji's expression brightened, and he walked towards the cave.

Just inside the entrance, he discovered a carved-out stone room on the right-hand wall. It contained simple furnishings. Currently, a gaunt old man sat on a stone stool. His face was sallow, and he appeared to be about sixty years old, with two wispy, unruly mustaches that curled slightly upwards, as if singed by the terrestrial fire. He was currently engrossed in a book titled "How to Become an Alchemy Master," his brows deeply furrowed, clearly grappling with some difficult problem. Faintly, Yang Ji could hear him muttering through gritted teeth.

"That brat He Gu actually became a Peak Alchemist before me! Damn it, I can't do it, how could he? No, I must be able to do it."

This must be the Master Huoyuan that Old Jin mentioned. He seemed a bit agitated and angry? Yang Ji's eyes flickered slightly as he glanced at the man.

"Who's there?"

Perhaps sensing Yang Ji's gaze, Huoyuan suddenly looked up. Seeing Yang Ji, whom he had never met, he immediately snapped, "This is a restricted area for alchemy! What are you doing here, young one? Get out, quickly!" He let out two heavy breaths, stood up angrily, and impatiently waved his hand.

"Greetings, Master Huoyuan! I am the Ship Guardian of Myriad Treasures Pavilion, here to use the terrestrial fire to refine pills." Yang Ji cupped his hands in a respectful bow and smiled slightly.

"Ship Guardian?" Huoyuan frowned, sizing up Yang Ji.

Yang Ji knew he was perplexed by this unfamiliar title, so he exaggeratedly described the identity and status of a Ship Guardian. As expected, after listening, Huoyuan's expression became slightly more polite. Although his anger had receded, he still maintained a stern face, hands clasped behind his back, and sneered, "You, a mere child, aren't cultivating diligently. Why are you learning alchemy? Do you think everyone can become a distinguished Senior Alchemist like me?"

Yang Ji saw his disdainful expression but didn't get angry. Instead, he calmly smiled: "This junior recognizes a few spirit herbs, so I just want to give it a try. What if, by some chance, I really do become an alchemist?"

"Hmph, merely recognizing a few spirit herbs makes you harbor such unrealistic ambitions. Young people nowadays are truly growing more arrogant." Huoyuan raised an eyebrow, glanced sideways at Yang Ji, swept his storage bag, and immediately pulled out a flame-shaped spirit herb. He said coldly, "Then let me ask you, what spirit herb is this?"

"This is a forty-three-year-old Flame Grass," Yang Ji replied with a smile.

Hmm? He wasn't surprised that Yang Ji recognized Flame Grass, but being able to tell its exact age with a single glance, that astonished Huoyuan.

"Then what about this spirit herb? And how old is it?" Huoyuan swept his storage bag with the back of his hand, pulling out a green, fruit-like spirit herb.

"This is a fifteen-year-old Azure Nether Fruit, which can be used to refine Azure Origin Pills," Yang Ji stated.

"Then what are these?" Huoyuan's brows furrowed slightly. He glanced at Yang Ji and, in one go, pulled out twenty-eight different spirit herbs.

"Thirty-six-year-old Wind Spirit Flower, twenty-eight-year-old Sky Azure Grass, seventy-two-year-old Vermillion Lotus, fifty-three-year-old Silver Horn Tree Leaf..."

As Yang Ji precisely and effortlessly stated the names and ages of various spirit herbs, the sneer on Huoyuan's face slowly faded, and a glint of surprise flashed in his eyes. The young man before him had, with just a glance, casually stated the exact ages of all the spirit herbs, not missing a single year. This greatly astonished him.

The most fundamental aspect of alchemy was learning to discern the age of various spirit herbs. Only by doing so could one know what intensity of fire to use when melting the herbs and how much medicinal power to extract during the refining process. This was the fundamental skill of alchemy, and also the most crucial one. Some even intermediate alchemists were still unable to accurately determine the age of spirit herbs merely by sight; they needed to combine sniffing their scent and sensing the spiritual energy within the herbs with their hands. Even then, some alchemists couldn't achieve Yang Ji's level of accuracy, often failing to properly adjust the heat during alchemy. Even if they eventually got it right, it was often after burning several spirit herbs. However, the astonishing young man before him clearly had a very solid foundation.

Yang Ji found it amusing to see the `[Astonished]` tag above his head. With his "golden finger" assistance, nothing could escape his perception with just a glance. Huoyuan's expression flickered slightly. He was somewhat unwilling to believe that this young child before him had such a solid foundation. Immediately, he swept his storage bag and pulled out a box of spirit herb powder. He said coldly, "This powder is ground from how many spirit herbs? And what are their ages?"

"There are three spirit herbs in here: a sixty-year-old Luoyun Fruit, a fifty-eight-year-old Snowy Moonflower, and a sixty-one-year-old Jueyan Grass." Yang Ji leaned closer, sniffed the scent, observed the color, and smiled faintly.

"Wrong! There's clearly no Luoyun Fruit in here, but rather the similar Zilu Fruit. Furthermore, the Snowy Moonflower's age is incorrect; it's only forty-six years old," Huoyuan chastised in a low voice.

"Oh?" Yang Ji's expression flickered, then he chuckled, "Then it seems this junior made a mistake."

"Hmph, you young one do have some skill, but there's still much to learn. You must be humble and strive for progress," Huoyuan said, hands clasped behind his back, his face stern, looking exactly like an old scholar.

"This junior has just begun delving into alchemy, and there is indeed much to learn. I hope senior will not hesitate to offer guidance in the future." Yang Ji smiled slightly, cupped his hands in a bow, and asked, "Then, may this junior enter now?"

"Mm, go on in," Huoyuan said, waving his hand impatiently.

Watching Yang Ji's retreating back, his brows furrowed deeply. He muttered, "This kid has such keen eyesight; he actually got everything right."

"His foundational skills are quite strong, but I wonder about his alchemy techniques?" Huoyuan's small eyes flickered. At this moment, he resembled a cunning old rat that had gained sentience, and he quietly followed Yang Ji.
