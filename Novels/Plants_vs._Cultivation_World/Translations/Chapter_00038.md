# Chapter 38: Fire Spirit Root  

Breaking through to a new cultivation realm meant undergoing a complete marrow cleansing and muscle reforging process. Gu Mo had already been using his perfected-level Cleansing Technique to purify his body, making his physique inherently stronger than that of ordinary cultivators. With this breakthrough, his body was further enhanced.  

"Still three times the norm," Gu Mo murmured.  

Three hours later, the effects of the breakthrough faded. Assessing his condition, he found that upon reaching the second level of Qi Refining, his spiritual power and physique remained three times that of his peers. This meant his current combat strength was at least equivalent to the third level of Qi Refining.  

Maintaining three times the spiritual power and physique at both the first and second levels didn’t mean he hadn’t improved—quite the opposite. Being able to sustain such an advantage over his peers was already an extraordinary feat.  

Without this enhancement, his breakthrough to the second level would have only granted him double the spiritual power and physique of an average cultivator at the same level.  

Considering that Gu Mo practiced the relatively ordinary *Gathering Qi Art*, achieving this result proved the significant benefits of his perfected-level Cleansing Technique.  

"That was a bit reckless just now," Gu Mo admitted to himself as he stood up and stretched, feeling a faint stinging sensation in his meridians.  

After mastering the *Breath Concealment Technique*, he had chosen to complete a full minor cycle in one go, allowing him to break through to the second level of Qi Refining in an extremely short time. However, this had placed immense pressure on his meridians.  

Fortunately, the strength of his meridians, enhanced by the perfected-level Cleansing Technique, far surpassed those of other cultivators, enabling him to succeed. Had it been anyone else, their meridians might have torn apart, causing spiritual energy to run rampant and inflict severe injuries.  

Though his robust meridians prevented any serious consequences, the sudden strain had caused minor damage. Still, such injuries would heal quickly.  

After familiarizing himself with his newfound power, Gu Mo activated the *Breath Concealment Technique*, causing his second-level aura to swiftly drop back to the first level.  

He had waited a long time for this breakthrough, but for a sect laborer, his progress was still unusually fast. Gu Mo planned to reveal his second-level cultivation only after a small portion of his peers had also reached that stage.  

Why only a small portion? Because not all labor disciples could reach the second level within a few years—many would take over a decade or even two to achieve the same.  

With luck, some might accumulate enough resources to attempt breaking through to the third level in their lifetime, but that was already the limit for most labor disciples.  

Spiritual root aptitude and cultivation resources were the greatest obstacles for labor disciples. Only through rare opportunities could they hope to break free from these constraints and reach higher realms.  

This was also why many cultivators were willing to risk their lives for such opportunities—most deaths in the cultivation world occurred during struggles over rare fortunes. Gu Mo’s caution was precisely to conceal his own extraordinary luck.  

"To celebrate your master’s breakthrough, you get an extra serving of Solar Essence today," Gu Mo said, glancing at the koi in the water tank. For now, this fish was the only one with whom he could share his joy.  

After days of feeding, nearly half of the koi’s scales had turned gold. As the golden scales increased, Gu Mo noticed the fish had grown noticeably more intelligent—a sign it was evolving into a true spirit beast.  

*Splash! Splash!*  

The koi happily flicked its fins at the sight of the two portions of Solar Essence in Gu Mo’s hand. After feeding it, Gu Mo stepped out of his hut.  

"The harvest is smaller this time," he observed, looking at the mature Spirit Jade Rice in the fields. During this season, he had been fully absorbed in mastering the *Breath Concealment Technique*, neglecting the fields slightly. Minor pest infestations had gone unchecked, leading to reduced yields.  

Still, he estimated a harvest of around six hundred pounds. Thanks to the illusion array and the Peashooter guardians, which had blocked eighty to ninety percent of pests and rodents, the loss wasn’t severe.  

Had any other farmer been as lax, their yield would have dropped by seventy to eighty percent.  

*Swish! Swish! Swish!*  

With swift movements, Gu Mo harvested the Spirit Jade Rice. His increased cultivation level had multiplied his spiritual energy, making spellcasting far more effortless.  

After gathering the crops, he stored the ten Sunflowers, five Peashooters, and the koi into his Black Mist Space before riding his crane to the Spirit Plant Hall to report his yield.  

**Spirit Plant Hall**  

Zhao Qiancheng, who rarely made appearances, stood beside a young woman with an enthusiastic smile. "Junior Sister Yuan, what took you so long to visit me?"  

"Senior Brother Zhao, I’ve been busy with my cultivation and only now found time to come," the girl replied politely.  

Though they addressed each other as senior and junior, this was only their second meeting—the first being months ago during the inner disciple initiation ceremony.  

In the Green Dew Sect, only inner disciples received formal initiation rites. Outer disciples and laborers had no such privileges.  

As a steward of the Spirit Plant Hall, Zhao Qiancheng enjoyed the same status as an inner disciple, hence the familiar address based on seniority.  

As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Zhao Qiancheng had no reason to be so warm toward a newly initiated inner disciple—except that this particular disciple possessed a rare Fire Spirit Root.  

Most cultivators had balanced five-element spiritual roots, but a rare few had one element dominating over fifty percent of their spiritual affinity. These were known as "attribute spirit roots."  

Depending on the dominance percentage, attribute spirit roots were graded as follows: fifty percent (low-grade), sixty percent (mid-grade), seventy percent (high-grade), and eighty percent (peak-grade).  

A ninety-percent dominance was nearly unheard of—such extreme elemental imbalance often led to early death. Only infants born into powerful sects with deep resources had any chance of survival.  

This was why the few legendary single-attribute cultivators in history all hailed from top-tier sects.  

The girl beside Zhao Qiancheng possessed a mid-grade Fire Spirit Root. While attribute spirit roots weren’t necessarily stronger than balanced ones—sometimes even weaker overall—they provided unparalleled advantages in cultivating corresponding elemental techniques.  

For example, this girl’s mid-grade Fire Spirit Root allowed her to master fire-attribute techniques as efficiently as someone with a high-grade spiritual root.
