# Chapter 19: Master, Please Teach Me

As soon as the cauldron lid was lifted, a dense cloud of white pill mist billowed out with a rumble.

Yang Ji took a deep breath, inhaling the rich aroma of the pills, and instantly felt refreshed and invigorated.

"I wonder what the quality of these pills is?" His eyes flickered slightly, a hint of anticipation in his heart.

If pills could be successfully formed, their quality, based on impurities and potency retention, could be categorized into low, medium, and high grades. Although all were Low-Grade Spirit Pills, their differing qualities led to vastly different prices. High-grade pills contained purer spiritual qi and fewer impurities, allowing for faster cultivation, hence their higher price, usually around five hundred spirit stones per bottle. Conversely, low-grade pills were cheaper, typically around two hundred spirit stones per bottle.

By now, the pill mist had dispersed, revealing ten thumb-sized pills lying quietly within the cauldron. Their surfaces gleamed with a white jade luster, each one perfectly round and plump, indicating excellent quality—clearly rare and good pills at a glance.

Yang Ji smiled faintly, immediately reached out, pocketed nine pills, and left one for inspection. He opened his palm to look, "The quality of these pills..."

"The quality of these pills—" Just then, Huoyuan walked in, his eyes wide, staring intently at the pill in Yang Ji's hand.

"Is this...? My alchemist ancestor! Is this actually a high-grade Low-Grade Spirit Pill?" Huoyuan was so shocked he nearly bit off his tongue. He leaned closer to the pill, sniffed it deeply, then his small eyes suddenly bulged, and he cried out as if mad, "No, no, that's not right! This color, this rich pill aroma, it far surpasses a high-grade Low-Grade Spirit Pill! Could this possibly be a peerless-grade Spirit Pill?"

He suddenly looked up, his beard bristling. Taking a deep breath, he questioned with a tone lacking conviction, "This... are these pills really refined by you?"

The pills still retained some warmth; the evidence was right before him, yet deep down, Huoyuan was unwilling to believe, still holding a skeptical attitude. This discovery overturned his pride, his understanding, his decades of effort, and everything he held dear. Various emotions erupted in his heart. Huoyuan's expression was incredibly complex. Looking at Yang Ji now, he resembled an old child who had suffered immense grievances, wishing to hear that this wasn't real.

"Uh?" Seeing Huoyuan's aggrieved expression, Yang Ji coughed lightly and merely said, "I suppose I refined them."

Huoyuan exhaled deeply, his face crestfallen, and asked, "Young friend, is this truly your first time refining pills?"

"Probably... not," Yang Ji glanced at him, smiling. "Actually, I've been studying alchemy for many years."

"At such a young age, to already be a quasi-alchemy master, what a true genius!" Huoyuan sighed with sorrow, and in his dejection, he seemed to age ten years in an instant. Looking at Yang Ji before him, a flicker of painful struggle crossed his eyes, then it transformed into firm resolve filled with hope. He suddenly bowed deeply and called out, "Master, please teach me, teach me how I can become a peak alchemist."

"Hm?"

This deep bow truly surprised Yang Ji greatly. He had never imagined that an old fossil like Huoyuan, a man who thought so highly of himself, would make such a gesture and say such words in an instant. He had truly underestimated Huoyuan's dedication and craving for the Dao of Alchemy.

"Master Huoyuan, you don't need to do this. This junior's knowledge is shallow; how could I possibly teach an elder like you?" Yang Ji said, finding it both amusing and exasperating, and could only lift his hands up.

"Master, this old man is dull-witted and has been unable to reach the peak alchemist realm for decades. Please, teach me," Huoyuan pleaded in a low voice.

Seeing Huoyuan's thirst for knowledge, Yang Ji was slightly moved. He then said, "The path of alchemy is vast and boundless. We can discuss it together and make progress together."

"Ah, thank you, Master!" Hearing this, Huoyuan's face lit up with joy, his beard bristled again, and he quickly bowed once more.

"This junior cannot bear the title of 'Master,' so please, stop calling me that. We share the same earth fire, so we can still discuss things when we have time," Yang Ji said.

"Yes, Master!" Huoyuan nodded excitedly, a flush appearing on his old face.

"..." Yang Ji felt helpless. He merely wanted to keep a low profile, but it seemed Huoyuan truly didn't want him to.

"Master, please continue with your work." Huoyuan glanced at the nearby cauldron, his small eyes darting around intelligently, then cleverly retreated. Clearly, he saw that Yang Ji was going to continue refining pills.

"This little old man is quite shrewd, but since he can humble himself like this, what harm is there in giving him some pointers later?" Yang Ji turned his head, watching his small, thin back, and murmured softly. However, at present, he had no time.

Looking at the pills in his hand, it would be a lie to say Yang Ji wasn't pleased. These ten pills could be divided into two bottles. The high-grade Low-Grade Spirit Flower Pills refined by Hegou could sell for five hundred spirit stones per bottle, so the peerless-grade Spirit Flower Pills in his hand could probably fetch at least seven to eight hundred spirit stones per bottle. Indeed, alchemy was the true path.

However, Yang Ji wouldn't sell them now. With these pills, he could accelerate his cultivation. Reaching the tenth level of Qi Condensation within ten years would no longer be a pipe dream.

When he entered the sect and obtained the Foundation Establishment method, if he succeeded in Foundation Establishment, he would transform into a Venerable with a lifespan of three hundred years, taking a step closer to becoming an immortal, eternal being. Thinking of this, Yang Ji's heart swelled with excitement.

After that, he looked at the cauldron again. Pill refining couldn't stop. One batch after another, pills were continuously refined by him. Whenever he heard the sound of pill mist rushing out of the cauldron, Huoyuan would feel an unbearable itch in his heart, always unable to resist glancing inside, truly wanting to witness that person's alchemy techniques. However, each time, he wisely restrained himself.

Three days passed quickly. Yang Ji had already refined all the spiritual herbs he possessed into pills. Out of ten portions of spiritual herbs, two portions of Spirit Flower Grass were ruined, and the remaining herbs could only be set aside for now. One portion had burned away during the fusion of the liquid medicines. Thus, Yang Ji only succeeded in refining seven portions, obtaining a total of seventy pills. The pill success rate reached an astonishing one hundred percent; even a Grandmaster Alchemist couldn't do better than this, right?

Yang Ji was in a very cheerful mood. He then left the cave, went to the Myriad Treasure Pavilion, and once again purchased ten portions of spiritual herbs and two stalks of Spirit Flower Grass. He planned to refine more, then enter secluded cultivation.

When Jin Dafu saw him come out to buy spiritual herbs, his face was wreathed in smiles, as he had already anticipated such an outcome. When Yang Ji returned to the cave, he didn't forget to offer a comforting smile: "Brother Yang, take your time. Alchemy can't be rushed. It's difficult to achieve anything without over a decade of effort. This old brother has plenty of spiritual herbs here. If you're short, just come and buy. If you buy a thousand portions, I'll definitely give you a discount."

Yang Ji turned back, smiled at him, and naturally said nothing more.

Back in the cave, Yang Ji used the earth fire to refine all twelve portions of spiritual herbs again. At this moment, he had refined a total of nineteen batches of pills, possessing one hundred ninety Spirit Flower Pills in all. If calculated at five pills per bottle and six hundred spirit stones per bottle, that would be worth over twenty thousand spirit stones. In just a few days, he had doubled his resources. Alchemists truly deserved their reputation as the foremost among the hundred cultivation arts.

With pills in hand, he could now cultivate with peace of mind. Yang Ji put away the cauldron and moved to walk out of the stone chamber. Just as he reached the cave entrance, he saw Huoyuan approaching with a smiling face, saying ingratiatingly, "Master, I've carved out a stone room for you. You can rest here when you're tired from refining pills."

Following his gaze, Yang Ji saw a stone room on the left, opposite Huoyuan's own stone room. The furnishings inside were simple, but the four stone walls were polished smooth and bright; Huoyuan had clearly put effort into it.

"Master, the bedding is all new, you can rest assured and use it," Huoyuan said with a smile, at this moment truly resembling a rat spirit begging for sesame oil.

Yang Ji understood his intention and smiled, "Thank you. If I get tired from refining pills in the future, I'll rest here." However, he wouldn't stay here at the moment. For secluded cultivation, it was better to return to his own small hut.
