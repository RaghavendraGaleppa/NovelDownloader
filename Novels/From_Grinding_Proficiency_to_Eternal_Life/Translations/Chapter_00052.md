# Chapter 52: Killing Intent in the Snowy Forest

The man was stunned for a moment before quickly realizing the situation. Even with his face covered, the joy on his face was unmistakable.

Once the exchange of money for goods was completed, the youth in hemp clothing turned and left without hesitation.

Xu Yunfan looked at the dark silk cloth in his hand and immediately turned to leave the black market.

The stone bridge was covered in a thin layer of frost. The lame Taoist, wrapped in a shiny cotton robe, sat there calmly.

As Xu Yunfan walked across the bridge, the lame Taoist, sitting on a broken stool by the side, extended a wooden pole to block his way.

The pole stopped right in front of Xu Yunfan's knees, kicking up tiny ice chips.

"Ten taels for the entrance fee."

Xu Yunfan was speechless. After a moment of silence, he reached into his pocket, took out some silver, and casually tossed it to the lame Taoist.

The lame Taoist caught it and weighed it in his hand. It was the exact amount, making him grin and reveal his few yellowed teeth.

Seeing Xu Yunfan about to leave, the lame Taoist spoke up.

"Young man, since you're so straightforward, let me give you a piece of advice. If you want to leave, do it quickly. Don't go钻进 the mountain forests, or you might twist your ankle. The snow rats in the forest are rampant right now. If you step on a trap, don't blame anyone."

Xu Yunfan paused for a moment, then continued walking.

"Thank you, Taoist."

He suddenly accelerated, quickly vanishing into the darkness and disappearing from the lame Taoist's view.

The lame Taoist chuckled, shaking his head. He swayed on his broken wooden stool, which creaked incessantly, creating a particularly eerie atmosphere in the silent night.

Xu Yunfan didn't stop along the way, heading straight into the mountain forests and making constant detours. Finally, he stopped.

"Come out."

For a long while, the surrounding forest remained silent, with only the swaying branches stirred by the cold wind.

Xu Yunfan slowly drew his War Drum Gold Hammer, removing the black cloth cover.

His gaze shifted to a corner, and then he strode forward, exerting force under his feet. He kicked up a flurry of snow, shooting out like an arrow released from a bow.

Xu Yunfan instantly arrived in front of a large tree in the corner, bringing his hammer down with full force.

In an instant, it was like thunder cracking across the sky. The heavy hammer stirred the air, creating a deafening hum.

*Boom!*

With a loud crash, the tree, thick enough for three people to wrap their arms around, was shattered by the hammer.

A black shadow immediately darted out from behind the tree, moving as lightly as a wild cat as it rolled to the other side.

Xu Yunfan didn't give chase immediately. Instead, he stood still and coldly watched the figure darting through the forest.

Seeing that Xu Yunfan wasn't taking the bait, someone finally stepped out from the shadows.

The first thing Xu Yunfan saw was a man with an iron mask, holding a Judge's Writing Brush in his hand. There was a hint of surprise in his eyes.

"Skin Tempering perfection. I didn't expect you to be a martial artist. We were blind."

A slightly breathless voice came from the side. Xu Yunfan glanced over and saw an elderly woman in a purple shirt holding a wooden stick, walking out from the shadows while coughing.

"You're fast, young man. I almost couldn't keep up."

As she spoke, she turned her head to look at the black shadow hiding in the shade of a tree. Xu Yunfan's sharp eyes identified him as the youth in hemp clothing.

"Chen, did you see the silver notes on him clearly?"

The youth in hemp clothing nodded repeatedly, his eyes filled with greed as he stared at Xu Yunfan.

"I saw it clearly. There must be at least ten thousand taels of silver. This guy is a fat sheep!"

"Ten thousand taels?!"

A tall, burly figure holding a large saber walked out. It was the one-eyed man. His only remaining eye was now filled with excitement.

"After this job, I'll wash my hands and retire, find a place to marry a few wives and live out my days."

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes as he looked at the people who had appeared one after another. He hadn't expected them to all be in cahoots.

It was only then that he suddenly understood.

"So, the ones selling martial arts manuals in the black market are all from the same family."

"The same family?"

The iron-faced man showed a hint of a smile, but his eyes were terrifying.

"Indeed, the same family. One big family."

The iron-faced man made the first move with his Judge's Writing Brush. The steel tip spun out seven cold stars, aiming for Xu Yunfan's vital acupoints.

Before the brush tip reached him, Xu Yunfan's back muscles writhed like a living python. The War Drum Gold Hammer swept up in a crescent arc from below. The heavy hammer whistled, making a terrifying *whooshing* sound.

The moment the hammer and brush collided, the iron-faced man's pupils constricted.

What immense strength, what ferocious power.

He could barely hold onto his brush. Seeing the hammer's momentum was unstoppable as it was about to smash down, he decisively retreated.

His expression changed drastically. This guy in front of him was definitely not just a martial artist at the Skin Tempering level. With his own skill at Muscle Tempering perfection, he couldn't even hold him back for a moment.

He was definitely a Bone Tempering martial artist!

We've kicked an iron plate!

He already had the thought of retreating.

"What powerful strength!"

Before he could speak, the old woman shrieked and threw three bone-piercing nails. The sound of the hidden weapons cutting through the air was drowned out by the roar of the hammer wind and was immediately deflected by the heavy hammer.

The veins on Xu Yunfan's neck bulged, and his muscles swelled. As the blood and energy in his body boiled, the various hormones in his organs surged rapidly at this moment.

The heavy hammer drew a phantom trail. Xu Yunfan, holding the hammer handle with his rear hand, thrust it forward. The iron-faced man's entire right arm armor was torn apart like thin paper.

With a muffled sound of the hammer embedding into flesh, the Judge's Writing Brush flew into the night sky along with half of a severed finger.

"Ah!!!"

Amidst the iron-faced man's scream, the one-eyed man's large saber had already arrived. The nine-ringed saber swung with the momentum of splitting a mountain.

When the blade was three inches from the top of Xu Yunfan's head, a lump of flesh the size of a bowl mouth suddenly swelled up on his left shoulder.

*Clang!*

The sound of metal clashing shook the snow off the pine branches. The blade scraped across the bronze-colored skin, sending out a string of sparks. The one-eyed man's single eye widened as he looked at his own distorted face reflected in the bent blade.

"Body Tempering?!"

The one-eyed man abruptly turned his head to look at the iron-faced man, who was clutching his mutilated arm. His eyes were full of resentment.

We've definitely kicked an iron plate!

"It's my turn."

A low, thunderous roar rolled from Xu Yunfan's throat. The vertebrae of his spine cracked one after another.

The Ninth Form of the Red Lasso Cloak Hammer Technique was unleashed fiercely. The heavy hammer swung out numerous phantom shadows above his head. The hammer handle, as thick as an infant's arm, seemed as light as a wooden stick in his hand.

The moment the one-eyed man blocked with his saber, the force accumulated by the heavy hammer made his expression change drastically.

How could there be such terrifying power?

The thought had just crossed his mind when the saber and his chest bone caved in simultaneously. His entire body was smashed into the mountain rock like a torn sack, shaking off the rustling snow.

The three-hundred-pound strong man was actually sent three feet off the ground by the hammer force. The sound of his chest bones caving in was like a string of firecrackers. When his back broke the ancient pine, the blood mist he spat out dyed the three-zhang-wide snowfield red.

The remaining few were greatly alarmed. Although the one-eyed man hadn't reached the level of a martial artist, his strength was considerable. He could have held his own against a martial artist for dozens of moves and escaped unscathed.

This hammer-wielding man in front of them was definitely not at the first level of Body Tempering. He was at least at the second level or higher!

Xu Yunfan turned his head to look at the old woman in the purple shirt. The snow under his feet suddenly exploded, and he shot forward like a meteor.

The old woman's expression changed drastically. She tapped the ground with her wooden stick, borrowing the force to retreat quickly. Then, she raised her stick, and a large handful of cowhair needles shot toward his face.

Xu Yunfan didn't dodge or evade. His neck took on a brass-like color. The cowhair needles struck his skin, actually producing a sound like metal clashing.

Body Tempering could reach such a level. Which school trained him?!
