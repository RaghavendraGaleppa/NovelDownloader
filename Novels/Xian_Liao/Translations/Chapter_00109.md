# Chapter 109: The Jingyang Cave Abode (Part 2)

With a single punch from Flying Bear, in an instant...

All light, color, sound, and even spiritual perception vanished before Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song's eyes. An overwhelming martial intent filled the ritual platform.

"Later generations, this is the martial will my master left within my soul, now blossoming for you." Flying Bear paused, then added, "Its name—Ephemeral."

Ephemeral as a fleeting bloom.

Zhou Qing instantly understood the nature of this trial.

It was the Jingyang True Person using his disciple's soul as a medium to imprint his own martial will, unleashing it through the puppet body of a demon bear.

Waiting for centuries, just for this fleeting moment.

This was Flying Bear's purpose.

And the final brilliance of his existence.

Yet the overwhelming martial fist intent couldn't drown Zhou Qing's spiritual sense.

Terrifyingly vast vital energy surged forth, creating waves of horrifying power—like ocean tides Zhou Qing had comprehended from the sea.

Vital energy like tides, accompanied by roars of tigers and dragons that shook the ritual platform.

Flying Bear used his fist like a spear, carrying ultimate killing intent and ruthlessness, his murderous aura spreading without reservation. Piercing through the tide of vital energy, crushing everything in its path.

Zhou Qing intercepted with a palm strike, crimson lightning erupting.

The Heartfire Thunder-enhanced palm lightning met Flying Bear's fist head-on.

In that instant.

Images of mountains of corpses and seas of blood flashed through Zhou Qing's mind, his entire body's vital energy seeming to ignite.

Meanwhile, Flying Bear moved, suddenly disappearing from Zhou Qing's spiritual perception.

Like teleportation, Flying Bear appeared behind Zhou Qing.

Boom! Another unreserved punch.

Zzzt!

Electric sparks remained where Zhou Qing had been, but his figure had vanished. He reappeared above the ritual platform, though not too high—an invisible barrier of formation restrictions prevented further ascent.

Flying Bear tapped the ground with his toes, the tremendous force causing the ritual platform to crack. Using this explosive power, he shot upward like an arrow.

His eyes were cold, expressionless, as if returned to his days of battle—once engaged, it was life or death.

This was an extremely cruel trial for challengers.

Because Flying Bear was ephemeral—win or lose, he would perish.

Thus he fought without regard for his own life, unleashing ultimate martial power.

In the air, on the ground.

Their figures clashed everywhere.

Elder Daoists Zhang and Fu could only observe from a corner, using their utmost perception to follow this earth-shaking battle.

Direct perception was impossible, so they tracked the battle through air currents, shattered ground, and fleeting glimpses of figures.

The battle was like a bold ink landscape painting.

A crane's cry rang out.

Sound waves reverberated.

The Green Wood Sword streaked like a rainbow through the air.

Flying sword—

Moon Piercer!

Suddenly, light erupted, illuminating the entire platform.

Zhang Jingxiu was deeply shaken. No matter how keen his premonitions, facing this sword would be like a mortal unable to resist the underworld's soul-reaping emissaries.

"Heavenly Descending Immortal!" Fu Song marveled.

This was how he imagined himself to be—cutting through clouds, bearing the sky, a sword descending from heavens like an immortal.

For Zhou Qing, the Flying Crane sword intent finally pierced through the martial will Jingyang True Person had left in Flying Bear's soul.

Flying Bear crashed heavily to the ground, his chest pierced through. Clear light rippled from his body—his soul was dispersing.

"How could you break my master's martial fist intent?" He was puzzled, confused.

Zhou Qing landed slowly on the platform and spoke: "Because it lacked variation. You were remarkable, but you couldn't comprehend fist intent in life, let alone in death."

"This trial wasn't for me—it was for you."

Zhou Qing added another sentence.

"For me?"

"You relied on Jingyang True Person's fist intent to maintain your remnant soul in this world. Had you truly comprehended some heavenly truth from it, you could have merged completely with the bear's body, living anew as a demon. But you failed."

"I did fail."

Zhou Qing clasped his hands behind his back: "After all, you're just a remnant soul. What you couldn't achieve in life, how could you after death?"

"True, true." Flying Bear murmured these words before his soul completely scattered.

Zhou Qing fell silent.

Without a physical body, a soul in this world is like floating in a sea of suffering, full of dangers. Even the esoteric sects' worshiped deities required continuous offerings to maintain their existence.

The physical body is truly the raft that ferries one across the sea of suffering to the shore beyond life and death. To lose or damage it is a devastating blow to any cultivator.

This was Jingyang True Person's way of reminding later generations not to neglect the physical body.

Yet even someone as formidable as Jingyang couldn't truly guide his disciple to higher realms.

Cultivation depends on oneself, not others.

Zhou Qing didn't search Flying Bear's body for spirit stones. Instead, he bowed slightly in respect.

"Senior Brothers, let's go."

...

The next ritual platform was vast, shrouded in dense dao mist. As Zhou Qing stepped in, he whispered:

"Morning Sun, go."

Morning Sun flew up, continuously spewing Solar True Fire to burn away the mist.

The thick dao mist began dissipating.

A sharp crane's cry pierced the air, accompanied by thunderous rumbles.

A pitch-black demon crane dove down, its sharp beak piercing through air with explosive sounds.

Zhou Qing had already drawn his bow, firing at the crane.

Speed against speed!

Arrow against crane.

The bow arched like a full moon, the arrow condensed from Zhou Qing's true qi and vital energy.

The power of the Heaven-Shaking Bow erupted instantly, generating tremendous force channeled into the qi arrow.

The arrow shot faster than sound, the air not even having time to explode before—

The qi arrow met the descending black crane.

Two mighty forces collided, creating continuous thunderous explosions.

The crane's beak emitted sharp energy, generating an indescribable power that shattered the qi arrow.

Air currents howled as the crane's wings flapped like twin blades slashing toward Zhou Qing.

But Zhou Qing had already discarded his bow after firing.

Qi, body, and spirit united.

Threefold Primordial Qi.

A terrifying qi cannon formed instantly in his hands, rippling like clouds and frost.

The black crane's wings met the Threefold Primordial Qi head-on.

An unstoppable force erupted.

Boom!

Dust flew as violent winds howled across the platform.

Meanwhile, Zhou Qing unsheathed his flying sword, slashing the crane countless times in an instant.

When the dust finally settled...

The crane's body lay in pieces.

A spirit stone flew into Zhou Qing's palm via his Dragon-Catching Technique. Rich spiritual energy made it pleasant to hold.

Zhou Qing guessed the demon beast puppets were only activated when they stepped onto platforms, with spirit stones remaining dormant otherwise. His keen spiritual sense detected the stones could slowly absorb ambient spiritual energy—so slowly it would be imperceptible without his micro-level perception.

After some adjustments, Zhou Qing said softly:

"Continue."

...

The fifth platform.

A massive shadow came from a white狂暴猿 (violent ape), exuding terrifying presence.

Zhou Qing said gravely: "Foundation Establishment."

This was beyond the ninth level of Qi Refining, beyond the third level of Body Refining—a Foundation Establishment level demon beast.

Jingyang True Person had a Foundation Establishment beast guarding the final trial?

Was he determined to prevent anyone from passing?

Zhou Qing was slightly shocked.

But having come this far, retreat wasn't an option.

A Foundation Establishment aura didn't mean invincibility. Zhou Qing was a unique Innate Perfection expert, also transcending conventional limits.

Under Zhou Qing's gaze, the white狂暴猿 stretched, its blood flowing like roaring rivers.

Unlike the demon tiger, crane, or deer, this was likely a living demon beast—its consciousness imprinted by Jingyang True Person to guard this trial.

Behind the platform stood a peach tree before a cave abode, bearing huge peach fruits that looked bloody and translucent, with visible veins.

Zhou Qing suspected the tree itself was demonic. Having eaten pine nuts from the great pine and mulberries from the great mulberry—both with unique effects—he wondered about the blood peaches' properties.

The white狂暴猿 likely fed on them.

Zhou Qing likewise stretched, his joints emitting thunderous cracks, terrifying vital energy radiating like a furnace's heat.

He stood at the platform's center like a blazing sun.

Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song found even breathing scorching.

Morning Sun, however, basked comfortably.

"If we reach a stalemate, Elder Zhang will attack its weak point." Zhou Qing knew even this beast couldn't fortify every vulnerability.

Entering Jingyang's cave abode today was epoch-making for this mortal realm.

Who else but Zhang Zhenren of Taihe Mountain could bear such responsibility?

Receiving Zhou Qing's mental message, Zhang's mouth twitched.

But he didn't protest—at the final hurdle, hesitation wasn't an option.

Zhou Qing's heart pounded like thunder, Solar True Fire erupting as he advanced.

Like a blazing sun, he made the狂暴猿 momentarily dazed, unable to look directly at him.

The vital energy furnace and Solar True Fire represented ultimate yang power, showcasing Zhou Qing's current dominance as an Innate Perfection expert.

Crack!

From Zhou Qing's feet to the ape's, the platform cracked.

Zhou Qing exhaled like releasing stagnant air—a fiery dragon erupted.

The explosive vital energy and Solar True Fire made him seem like a human-shaped demon wielding divine powers. Terrifying!

The fiery dragon's emergence seemed to flip the entire platform.

The white狂暴猿 met this ultimate yang power with a thunderous palm strike, creating massive shockwaves.

The explosion's ripples spread from their clash.

Zhang and Fu were aghast.

The platform beneath them undulated like waves—even this formation-reinforced structure couldn't withstand their battle's force.

Zhou Qing fought unreservedly.

Clashing directly with the狂暴猿!

Exhilarating.

This was his first full-power display since reaching Innate Perfection.

Without such intense release, he couldn't have imagined how dazzling his life force had become.

Platform stones shattered under their blows.

The protective formation wavered.

Zhou Qing focused completely, his vital energy growing ever more vigorous. Heartfire Thunder unleashed without restraint, testing his limits.

Hummm!

His entire body resonated like a giant bell.

Every movement released ultimate power, attacks raining on the ape like tidal waves. The狂暴猿's own vital energy surged endlessly in response.

No tricks.

Pure physical collision.

Fist winds exploded, air tore.

Eventually, blood seeped from Zhou Qing's brow—his vital energy pushed beyond control.

The狂暴猿 fought tirelessly, its controlled mind knowing no fear of death, attacking relentlessly despite mounting damage.

"I'm human—I fear death. Its consciousness is controlled, forgetting mortality. Even as its body fails from overexertion, it fights endlessly." Zhou Qing realized continuing was pointless.

Flying sword—unsheathed!

With a thought.

Sun Splitter!

Instantly, the Green Wood Sword emitted dazzling sword light.

The狂暴猿's eyes were dazzled, but it instinctively blocked with its arms—only for Morning Sun to seize the moment, claws piercing its eyes.

Morning Sun's ambush was instinctive perfection.

Zhang Jingxiu struck simultaneously, his spear thrusting like a dragon into the ape's vulnerable point.

Fu Song unleashed "Leaderless Dragons"—countless palm strikes assaulting the ape's ears.

Though the狂暴猿 had spiritual sense, Zhou Qing's Soul-Stabilizing Technique combined with猛虎杀生经 (Fierce Tiger's Killing Scripture) stunned its demon soul.

Finally, Zhou Qing delivered the killing blow.

The massive狂暴猿 collapsed.

Zhou Qing retrieved its core and approached the cave abode.

The peach tree with human-head-sized blood peaches was the only spiritual plant there.

Ancient seal script above the entrance read "Jingyang," with no couplets. Inside, the cave was inexplicably bright despite no light sources.

Words appeared on the stone wall behind the stone bed:

"The universe is a furnace, creation the smith; yin and yang are the coals, all beings the bronze."

Side walls bore eight murals each.

Zhang and Fu Song were instantly entranced—these weren't mere paintings but supreme techniques pointing to the Vital Energy Furnace realm.

A thunderclap snapped them from their trance.

They'd nearly exploded from attempting techniques beyond their capacity—had Zhou Qing not intervened, they'd have died from qi deviation.

Zhou Qing's gaze fell on the stone bed.

Another painting—of a dao furnace.
