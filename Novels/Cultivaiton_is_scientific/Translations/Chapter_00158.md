# Chapter 158: The Battlefield

Elder Sheng's flying boat was astonishingly fast—the fastest Li Shiming had ever experienced.  

Not without some mischief, Li Shiming wondered if Elder Sheng had acquired such a speedy vessel solely to facilitate quick escapes.  

The thought had barely formed in his mind when he dismissed it.  

He was still aboard Elder Sheng's flying boat. If she knew what he was thinking, she might just toss him overboard.  

As they approached the Seven Stars Islands, Li Shiming sensed the tense atmosphere.  

The islands' formation arrays were glowing brightly—a full activation that consumed vast amounts of spiritual energy, far beyond what the spiritual veins alone could sustain.  

In other words, the formations were being powered by spirit stones.  

Across the sea, four massive flying boats hovered in the air, their ten Golden Core auras soaring skyward.  

The two sides were clearly in a standoff, yet neither seemed eager to strike first.  

Elder Sheng's arrival didn't provoke any reaction from the opposing side, as if an additional Golden Core cultivator was of little consequence.  

The flying boat landed on Tianji Island, one of the Seven Stars Islands. As Li Shiming disembarked, he immediately sensed the overwhelming auras on the islands.  

"One, two, three..." He counted silently. Just the Golden Core auras he could perceive exceeded twenty, outnumbering the enemy two to one.  

Yet, judging by the islands' defensive posture, the Seven Sects' Golden Core cultivators had no intention of leaving the islands to engage the ten enemy Golden Cores.  

"All Foundation Establishment cultivators participating in the battle, gather here!" an aged voice called out.  

"Stay coordinated and watch each other's backs," Elder Sheng instructed Li Shiming and the other two before waving them toward the assembly point.  

Li Shiming mounted his flying sword, followed by He Chuan and Shang Haoquan, all heading toward the source of the voice—Yaoguang Island, the foremost of the Seven Stars Islands, directly facing the enemy.  

Upon arrival, Li Shiming spotted an old acquaintance—the monk Du Yuan, accompanied by a younger monk, Master Du Hai.  

Foundation Establishment cultivators from each island were converging, typically two from each sect.  

Except for the Holy Ice Sect, where Li Shiming had replaced Du Bingyan, leaving them with only one representative.  

Li Shiming truly grasped the depth of the Seven Sects' foundations. Among the thirteen other Foundation Establishment cultivators present, all were peak ninth-level cultivators with perfected physical bodies.  

In terms of innate spiritual roots, Li Shiming was undoubtedly the weakest here. The others didn't even possess dual spiritual roots, let alone triple ones like him.  

But since learning of Li Shiming's spiritual sense, He Chuan and Shang Haoquan had treated him with great respect.  

In the world of cultivation, strength commanded reverence. A Foundation Establishment cultivator with spiritual sense was in a league of their own.  

Though He Chuan and Shang Haoquan didn't know Li Shiming also possessed spiritual sense attack techniques, merely having spiritual sense alone granted him absolute initiative in battle.  

The thirteen Foundation Establishment cultivators exchanged nods. Clearly, these elite talents from the Seven Sects were familiar with one another.  

Some eyed Li Shiming curiously, unfamiliar with his background and naturally inquisitive about his inclusion among them.  

"I am Du Hai. Before you enter battle, I have some words for you," Master Du Hai intoned solemnly, scanning the group.  

He didn't know how many would survive this battle, but it was a necessary first clash—a probing of each side's strength.  

If their performance was lacking, it would signal weakness to the enemy.  

In truth, the Seven Sects' Golden Core elders had little confidence in their own strength, especially those who had faced the sword cultivator Yun Xingyi.  

Though they had severely wounded Yun Xingyi, it was only because he had recklessly entered the Seven Stars Islands' formation and been ambushed by seven Golden Core cultivators leveraging the array's power.  

Yet even then, Yun Xingyi had broken through the formation and escaped.  

His combat prowess far surpassed even Elder Yin's mid-Golden Core strength.  

If all ten enemy Golden Cores were of similar caliber, the outcome of this battle was a foregone conclusion.  

The enemy Golden Cores were also assessing their opponents. Their strongest combatant had mysteriously vanished near the Seven Stars Islands, forcing them to reconsider the Seven Sects' hidden strength.  

Moreover, large-scale battles didn't begin with all-out clashes between top-tier fighters.  

Typically, they started at the Foundation Establishment level, escalating gradually. The dominant side aimed to crush the enemy's morale early, often achieving victory without full-scale conflict.  

Golden Core battles were costly for both sides.  

The northern Shu cultivators, having fled their homeland, couldn't afford further losses.  

Likewise, the Seven Sects couldn't easily replace their Golden Core cultivators, with each sect boasting only about three after centuries of accumulation.  

"This battle is of utmost importance. Fight with all your might, and the Seven Sects will richly reward outstanding performers," Master Du Hai declared gravely.  

The significance of the battle was evident from the dense Golden Core auras surrounding them.  

None of the Foundation Establishment cultivators were fools; they understood the stakes.  

"Hold nothing back. Your enemies are unimaginably strong. As the elite of your sects, unleash your full power and annihilate them!" The words sounded incongruous coming from the kindly old monk, but the cultivators listened solemnly.  

If even Golden Core elders spoke thus, the enemy's strength was beyond doubt.  

"Children, come back alive," Master Du Hai said softly, his expression gentle.  

With a wave of his hand, formation light lifted the fourteen Foundation Establishment cultivators and carried them toward the sea.  

"Elder Xie!" Master Du Hai turned to the Holy Ice Sect's Elder Xie.  

Elder Xie began weaving intricate spell sigils, a process that took five full breaths—an eternity for a Golden Core elder, indicating a spell of tremendous power.  

Li Shiming felt an intense chill as the sea beneath the formation light began to freeze.  

He could scarcely believe his eyes—a three-kilometer radius of ocean surface was solidifying into ice.  

From the enemy's four massive flying boats, fourteen Foundation Establishment cultivators were also being dispatched.  

Simultaneously, earth spiritual power surged across the frozen surface as the northern Shu Golden Cores conjured a thick layer of soil atop the ice.  

Elder Xie's expression darkened. He felt he'd been outmaneuvered.  

Of course, both sides were engaging in psychological warfare. Spells like these were impractical in actual combat—who would give an opponent the time and space to prepare such lengthy incantations?  

A single interruption could disrupt the spell and backlash onto the caster.  

Thus, unless a spell could be cast instantly, most cultivators relied on talismans rather than direct spellcasting in battle.  

Li Shiming felt the formation light beneath him weakening, as did the energy carrying the northern Shu cultivators.  

He understood: once both energies dissipated and the cultivators landed on the makeshift battlefield, the battle would begin.  

He wasted no time, using both his eyes and spiritual sense to survey the newly created terrain below.  

The Golden Cores on both sides had deliberately created chaotic spiritual fields, making it nearly impossible for Foundation Establishment cultivators to set up formations.  

Nearly impossible—for most.  

Among the gathered elite, few specialized in formations, if any. At most, they might activate pre-made formation plates with spirit stones. But even that was questionable under these conditions.  

Formation plates were designed for versatility, capable of self-adjustment and autonomous deployment—but only in relatively stable environments.  

This makeshift battlefield, deliberately engineered by Golden Core cultivators, was anything but stable.  

Yet among them was an exception: Li Shiming, a hidden master of formations.  

No faction would normally send a formation master into frontline combat—their value lay in support roles far from the battlefield.  

When Li Shiming unleashed his spiritual sense, Golden Cores on both sides took notice.  

It was unclear how many other Foundation Establishment cultivators possessed spiritual sense, but none had revealed it as openly as he did.  

The formation light vanished, and the fourteen cultivators began their descent.  

Their fourteen counterparts from the north did the same. None attempted to fly—in high-level Foundation Establishment combat, fighting grounded offered the greatest advantage.  

Foundation Establishment cultivators had limited spiritual energy and focus. Aerial combat, while agile, required diverting attention and energy to flight artifacts, leaving less for offense and defense.  

As he descended, Li Shiming retrieved thirty-six formation flags from his storage bag and began tossing them onto the ground below.  

His actions drew startled glances from both sides. None had expected such swiftness.  

Those with some knowledge of formations were particularly astonished.  

"Elder Liu, how skilled is he? Can he really set up a formation mid-battle?" Elder Sheng asked Elder Liu of the Water Cloud Sect, who was versed in formations.  

"Elder Sheng, the Heavenly Sea Sect is wasting talent! To send such a formation prodigy into battle... His skill approaches mastery. His deployment is extraordinary," Elder Liu lamented.  

Elder Sheng's expression tightened. She hadn't realized Li Shiming's formation skills were so advanced.  

Had she known, she'd never have allowed him to participate. But it was too late now—she could only hope he survived.  

Just then, a formidable aura approached from afar, drawing the attention of all Golden Cores.  

"Elder Yin has returned!" someone exclaimed joyfully.  

Elder Yin had arrived just in time, bolstering the Seven Sects' forces.  

His gaze swept the battlefield, immediately spotting Li Shiming.  

"Why is Li Shiming in this battle?" he demanded, his voice thick with anger.  

Regardless of his personal opinion of Li Shiming, he had publicly acknowledged their relationship.  

For Li Shiming to be sent into such a battle in his absence was unacceptable.  

"Elder Yin, Li Shiming is no weakling. He slew Du Bingyan and five of his disciples. With Du Bingyan dead, Li Shiming taking his place is only fitting," Elder Xie of the Holy Ice Sect said coolly.  

Though Elder Bai had pulled strings to pressure the Heavenly Sea Sect, with Elder Yin absent and the battle imminent, Elders Sheng and Gu had compromised to avoid disrupting the larger conflict.  

To ensure Li Shiming's safety, the sect had provided significant resources: five second-grade elemental formation materials and the Foundation Establishment secret technique, *Hundred Revolutions Spirit Mind Method*.  

"If anything happens to Li Shiming, I'll make sure Elder Bai joins him in death," Elder Yin said coldly, his displeasure evident.  

His words carried weight—a public vow from someone of his stature was no idle threat.  

Elder Xie fell silent, realizing the depth of Elder Yin's regard for Li Shiming.  

Elder Bai had acted without consulting the sect, creating fissures in the Seven Sects' unity at a time when solidarity against external threats was paramount.
