# Chapter 387: Xiao Li's Birthday Gift (Part 1)

In the room on New Year's Eve.

Li Mo gazed at the night sky outside, his eyes illuminated by the dazzling fireworks. From the moon's position, it was not yet midnight.

But this world had no restrictions on setting off fireworks and firecrackers. The sky was filled with a dense barrage of silver and golden blooms, the continuous explosions so loud they drowned out even his own voice.

"Two lifetimes lived, and I'm still celebrating a birthday?"

即将 turn one year older, Xiao Li shook his head and submerged his consciousness into the World Seed.

The world instantly fell silent.

The quiet little world had already been transformed into the image of an immortal sect in Li Mo's mind. All around stood magnificent, ethereal, and otherworldly wonders, standing tall under the quiet moonlight.

It seemed to transcend the mortal world, sealing out all the clamor.

The Heavenly尊 Teacher was once again sitting on his Yin-Yang Dao Field, taking out the Kongming Wanse Pagoda.

"The power of the common people within the Eight-Armed Bodhisattva statue has been almost completely purified."

"The twelfth layer can manifest two Supreme Forms, but the Divine Form of the Great Dao requires thirty-six layers... only one-third."

Li Mo was not in a hurry.

At the very least, the Southern Frontier was still continuously providing him with the power of the common people, and on New Year's Day, the supply was particularly abundant. For a short time, the power from there would not be an issue, and it should be enough to fully charge the Kongming Wanse Pagoda.

Besides, he had only just barely defeated the先天 Golden Crow.

To face the projection of the Great Sage at his peak?

The gap was likely not just a little bit.

"Teacher, Happy New Year..."

Just as he was thinking, Jiang Chulong entered the World Seed. She was also wearing new clothes today, the ones bought back from Yunzhou.

In her hands, she carried a lunch box and a small bundle.

"Haven't you eaten yet?"

"I... I have. This... is for the Teacher to eat."

Jiang Chulong opened the lunch box, inside were dumplings, looking a bit clumsy.

Her small hands were twisted together as she stammered, "I... I learned to make dumplings for the first time... they're not very good-looking..."

"I'll eat them properly. By the way, what's this?"

The Heavenly尊 Teacher was more curious about the bundle.

"That's for Big Brother Li..."

Jiang Chulong hugged the bundle, her speech suddenly becoming clear as she lowered her head. "Big Brother Li said his birthday is on New Year's Eve. Everyone else is celebrating the New Year, so wouldn't Big Brother Li have no birthday gifts?"

"Teacher, could you please give him this birthday gift on my behalf?"

She opened the small bundle, inside was a belt. The craftsmanship was exquisite, embroidered with flowers, birds, insects, and fish. It was clear the embroiderer had put a lot of thought into it.

"!"

Xiao Li Heavenly尊 leaned back slightly.

Chulong, she's really... I could cry.

Not only did Little Princess Jiang remember his birthday, but she might have started preparing it a long time ago?

Yet he didn't even go to see her and the little kids from Nijiao Alley during the New Year...

He rubbed Little Princess Jiang's head and said softly, "Ahem, actually, Big Brother Li has a gift for you too."

"What is it?"

Jiang Chulong's eyes behind the cloth band lit up instantly.

"He also asked me to wish you a Happy New Year."

Li Mo found a piece of red cloth from his system space and wrapped some silver bills inside.

Watching Little Princess Jiang treat the red envelope like a treasure, stuffing it into her怀里 and patting it gently as if afraid of dropping it, Li Mo's conscience ached a little.

He had only acted on a whim, but Little Princess Jiang took it so seriously.

Hmm, he would seriously prepare a New Year's gift for her later...

After receiving the gift, Little Princess Jiang's rigorous training began again tonight. She seemed even more serious than usual.

In just one hour, she challenged the Golden Crow projection three times.

And!

In the last attempt, she seized a faint opportunity in the midst of a narrow escape, finally finding a flaw in the Golden Crow projection. She was only a hair's breadth away from victory.

***

"Once Chulong breaks through the Observation of the Divine, she will definitely be able to登上 the潜龙 list," the Heavenly尊 Teacher muttered to himself, a sense of pride welling up in his heart.

It was like finding a seed by accident, which has now blossomed, borne fruit, and grown freely.

But it's the New Year.

Why has Little Princess Jiang been working so hard recently?

Too much of a good thing can be counterproductive. The Heavenly尊 Teacher felt the string in her was pulled a little too tight; it should be relaxed at times...

Just as he was thinking this.

A fluctuation suddenly came from the outside world.

***

Xiao Li's soul was still in the small world. Li Dalong and his wife, who had just finished giving out red envelopes to the servants in the estate, had also just finished cleaning the kitchen and come out.

Considering that last time, the young master Li Mo was full of nonsense, the couple exchanged a glance and saw the same thought in each other's eyes.

"By the way, our son's birthday is today."

"Let's have the kitchen make a bowl of noodles.顺便... go check on him?"

"Okay, he'd better be in his own room."

Not long after, Li Dalong and Gu Xueqin, who was holding the noodles, arrived at Xiao Li's door.

Sometimes, things are just this coincidental.

The couple ran into a certain ice lump head-on.

Good news: They caught the culprit.

Bad news: This time, it wasn't Xiao Li.

"Little Bing'er?"

"..."

Ying Bing was still wearing that white cat fur hat, holding a large box in her arms. The color of the night and fireworks seemed to dye her face with a fiery hue.

She paused, her eyelashes trembled, and after a moment of hesitation, she pretended nothing had happened and said seriously, "I... I went into the wrong room."

"..."

Gu Xueqin was stunned for a moment, as if thinking of some past memory, and looked at her husband beside her.

She remembered that year, she was returning from out of town and traveled with the then-young Li Dalong. At night, they stayed at an inn together.

At that time, they already had feelings for each other, but the relationship hadn't been explicitly stated yet, so they stayed in two separate rooms.

As a result, in the middle of the night, Old Li, in a daze, entered her room, smelling of alcohol.

The next morning, he said he was drunk and went into the wrong room...

Sensing his wife narrowing her eyes, Li Dalong let out a heavy cough.

"Oh, you're here for Little Mo's birthday too, Bing'er? Then I'll have to trouble you to bring this bowl of noodles in."

"I haven't set off the firecrackers I bought yet; I won't make it in time if I don't hurry."

"?"

Ying Bing watched as Li Dalong left, followed by Gu Xueqin. Her gaze finally fell on the bowl of noodles.

Li Mo was lying on the bed, his soul having entered the World Seed.

But with the commotion outside, he naturally wasn't completely unaware. When Ying Bing ran into his parents at the door, he had already sensed it.

He had already opened his eyes by now.

He had just sat up when the door was pushed open with a *clatter*.

"Ice lump? Did you think I wouldn't come find you today, so you came yourself? Actually, I was about to..."

"It's not for dual cultivation."

"Huh?" Li Mo was taken aback.

"Happy birthday."

Ying Bing put down the noodles and opened the box in her arms.

Inside were many things: a摩羅 (Mara) top... a tangram... marbles...

And a small wooden sword, still carrying the fresh scent of wood, clearly made not long ago.

If you were to count them...

There were exactly seventeen gifts.

The same number as Xiao Li's age.
