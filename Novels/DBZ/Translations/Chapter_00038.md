# Chapter 38: The Secrets of Core Formation and the Patriarch's Favor

Several streaks of light descended from the flying vessel of the Ten Thousand Stars Sect. Among them, Wei Qian recognized two familiar figures—the Li Family's Ancestor and Li Wanlong. 

There was also an elderly man with white hair whose face remained indistinct. Wei Qian dared not scrutinize him carelessly. Yet it was from this man that an overwhelming aura of terrifying mana emanated.

"This person isn't a Golden Core True Master—he's either a False Core cultivator or a Dead Core cultivator," Wei Qian surmised. 

Though the white-haired elder's presence far surpassed that of Foundation Establishment cultivators, it still fell short compared to the Wandering Soul Mountain's Impermanence True Master he had encountered years ago.

Core Formation was the cultivation realm above Foundation Establishment. 

A cultivator condensed their mana into an inner core—this was Core Formation. However, Core Formation had significant variations, primarily categorized into three types: False Core, Dead Core, and Golden Core.

A "False Core" was formed when a Foundation Establishment Great Perfection cultivator refined a third-grade demon beast's core to achieve Core Formation. However, after forming a False Core, the cultivator's realm could no longer advance. Moreover, False Core cultivators, who relied on demon beast cores, not only possessed weaker divine abilities and mana but also gained only half the lifespan extension of ordinary Core Formation cultivators.

A "Dead Core" occurred when a Foundation Establishment Great Perfection cultivator made a mistake during their breakthrough, resulting in a core that was brown, gray, or black in color—lacking the touch of immortal golden essence. 

Dead Core cultivators enjoyed the same lifespan extension as ordinary Core Formation cultivators, but like False Core cultivators, their cultivation realm became permanently stuck at the early Core Formation stage, never to progress further.

Only by forming a "Golden Core" could one be considered a true Core Formation cultivator. 

Such cultivators were respectfully addressed as "True Masters" because they still had room for advancement and the potential to ascend further—perhaps even reaching the Nascent Soul True Lord realm!

Among Core Formation cultivators in the cultivation world, at least seventy percent were False Core or Dead Core cultivators. The remaining thirty percent were genuine Golden Core True Masters.

Yet for low-level cultivators—those who couldn't even glimpse the threshold of Core Formation—whether False Core or Dead Core, these cultivators still stood above them. When meeting them in person, they would still respectfully address them as "True Masters."

This led Wei Qian to a pressing question: "How did the Li Family establish a connection with a Core Formation cultivator from the Ten Thousand Stars Sect?"

If the Li Family had long been acquainted with this Core Formation cultivator, why would they have ever worried about pressure from the Wang Family? Wouldn't the Wang Family's patriarch have rushed to seek reconciliation long ago?

Wei Qian's intuition told him there was more to this story. 

But he didn't care. 

As a cultivator at the fifth level of Qi Refinement, what use was there in knowing the intricacies of these matters?

"Now, I just need to pass the next three days peacefully."

Three days slipped by quietly. Shortly after the Dragon Pearl fulfilled Wei Qian's wish, the Ten Thousand Stars Sect's flying vessel atop Mist Ridge Mountain once again soared into the clouds, disappearing to parts unknown.

Wei Qian's spirits lifted. He waited another two hours to confirm the vessel had truly departed before heading toward Mist Ridge Mountain.

The Li Family cultivators guarding the mountain were surprised to see him and didn't immediately let him pass. Instead, they said they needed to report to the family head.

Before long, Wei Qian was escorted to meet the patriarch.

Mist Ridge Mountain, Assembly Hall.

When Wei Qian entered and saw the person seated in the patriarch's chair, he froze momentarily.

The figure at the head wasn't Li Wanlong—it was now Li Wanqing!

"This makes sense," Wei Qian thought. "Li Wanlong successfully reached Foundation Establishment and must have been elevated to Elder status. I wonder who took over Li Wanqing's previous position."

The new patriarch, Li Wanqing, studied Wei Qian before speaking slowly, "I thought you had met an unfortunate end. Yet here you are, alive and well."

"You truly are as the Ancestor said—blessed with good fortune."

Wei Qian quickly replied, "This junior merely got lucky. Any fortune I have comes from Mist Ridge Mountain's auspicious energy. I've only borrowed a sliver of it. Elder Wanlong is the one truly favored by heaven."

Indeed, breaking through from Qi Refinement Great Perfection to Foundation Establishment extended one's lifespan to over two hundred years—comparable to the duration of an entire dynasty in Wei Qian's previous life. How could that not be considered heaven's favor?

"Haha, you certainly know how to flatter," Li Wanqing chuckled, shaking his head before dropping the subject.

In this world, there were countless cultivators with great opportunities and immense luck. Wei Qian's two narrow escapes from death might sound impressive, but in reality, they weren't particularly remarkable. 

If one were to scrutinize it, hadn't his own son and brother Wanhai also narrowly escaped death twice?

"It's good that you've returned. For now, I'm still overseeing the herb garden and peach grove. You may resume your duties tending the peach trees," Li Wanqing said.

Having ascended to the position of patriarch, his responsibilities now encompassed all aspects of the family's affairs. His burdens had only grown heavier.

Just as Li Wanqing picked up his teacup to signal Wei Qian's dismissal, the young man suddenly spoke up.

"Patriarch, during my escape, I was pursued by two Wang Family cultivators. In self-defense, I was forced to kill them. From their storage pouches, I discovered this. I present it for your review."

With that, Wei Qian produced a jade slip—the very one Lu Ping had given him.

Wei Qian intended to use this opportunity to "legitimize" the jade slip.

Li Wanqing summoned the slip with a wave of his hand but didn't examine it immediately. Instead, his attention remained fixed on Wei Qian's opening statement.

"You killed two Wang Family cultivators? Do you have proof?"

Wei Qian tossed over two storage pouches.

Li Wanqing channeled his mana into them, ignoring the other contents as he sifted through until he retrieved two jade tokens. Each bore the engraved character "Wang."

"Good. Very good. Excellent!" Li Wanqing nodded with evident satisfaction, his tone noticeably warmer than before.

"Take a seat," he instructed.

Only then did he begin examining the jade slip.

"Hmm, a pill-making inheritance and two pill recipes..." Li Wanqing tossed the slip back to Wei Qian. "To be honest, our family already possesses a similar pill-making inheritance."

"Nevertheless, you've eliminated Wang Family cultivators and presented this inheritance. Your loyalty is commendable and deserves reward."

"Each Wang Family cultivator counts for five hundred contribution points. The pill-making inheritance is worth a thousand. As for the two pill recipes, since the family already has them, but considering this is your first offering, I'll grant you a hundred points."

"That totals twenty-one hundred contribution points. Later, you may seek out Elder Wanhai."

"He now oversees the family treasury and contribution exchanges."

Not only had Li Wanqing been promoted, but Li Wanhai had also ascended to elder status, joining the ranks of the family's senior members.

Li Wanqing then kept Wei Qian in the hall for an extended conversation. 

As Wei Qian prepared to leave, the patriarch asked meaningfully if he might consider socializing more with other Li Family cultivators on Mist Ridge Mountain—particularly the female ones.

Stepping outside, Wei Qian felt a twinge of unease. "Is he trying to play matchmaker?"
