# Chapter 7: Qi Refining Second Layer  

The next day, after some careful disguise, Lu Xu transformed himself into a burly man and arrived in front of a tall building in the market.  

**Hundred Herbs Pavilion!**  

This was the most reputable large shop in the market, specializing in elixirs, medicinal herbs, and the like.  

Compared to talisman-making, alchemy was an art with an extremely high barrier to entry.  

Setting aside the raw materials and cauldrons, the issue of alchemical flames alone was enough to deter most people.  

Whether it was earth flames or demonic flames, both were exceedingly difficult to obtain.  

The Green Lake Market had only one earth flame vein, which was monopolized by the Mo Family.  

Thus, aside from the Mo Family and the Hundred Herbs Pavilion, very few in the market could practice alchemy.  

"What elixir does the esteemed cultivator seek? The Hundred Herbs Pavilion’s products will never disappoint!"  

As Lu Xu looked around, a figure approached him.  

A clear, melodious voice sounded by his ear:  

"This humble one is Miao Fangxuan, well-versed in all the elixirs of the Hundred Herbs Pavilion. If the esteemed cultivator has any needs, please let me know, and I can recommend suitable elixirs!"  

The woman had bright eyes and white teeth, with a rather delicate and beautiful appearance.  

"I need some elixirs to enhance my cultivation," Lu Xu replied, withdrawing his gaze to look at her.  

"For your current cultivation level, the most suitable elixir would undoubtedly be the low-grade first-tier *Qi-Nourishing Pill*. This pill strengthens the foundation and significantly increases the cultivation speed of low-level Qi Refining cultivators!" Miao Fangxuan said after a brief moment of thought.  

Lu Xu nodded. The *Qi-Nourishing Pill* was a renowned elixir among low-level Qi Refining cultivators.  

Seeing that he seemed inclined to purchase, Miao Fangxuan’s smile grew even more enthusiastic:  

"The *Qi-Nourishing Pills* from the Hundred Herbs Pavilion are undoubtedly the best you can buy in the Green Lake Market!"  

"What’s the price?"  

"One bottle contains ten pills, priced at sixty spirit stones!"  

"Can you make it cheaper? I’ll take it for thirty spirit stones!"  

Miao Fangxuan’s smile stiffened slightly. "Esteemed cultivator, you jest. The Hundred Herbs Pavilion is not some roadside stall—we don’t haggle over prices!"  

*"Big shops sure are something, huh?"* Lu Xu grumbled inwardly.  

But he also knew that the Hundred Herbs Pavilion had the right to be firm—few could compete with them in alchemy.  

Seeing his silence, Miao Fangxuan added,  

"Sixty spirit stones is actually quite reasonable. Taking one pill every nine days, these ten pills will last you three months. Over this period, your cultivation progress will easily double compared to before!"  

"Might I ask what grade of spiritual root the esteemed cultivator possesses?" she inquired.  

Lu Xu hesitated briefly before lowering his spiritual root by one grade: "Upper-lower grade wood spiritual root."  

"Upper-lower grade? With that level, progressing from Qi Refining first layer to second layer typically takes two to three years. However, with ample *Qi-Nourishing Pills*, that time can be reduced to about a year!" Miao Fangxuan said, studying Lu Xu with keen eyes.  

Lu Xu shook his head. "That may be true, but who can afford to consume so many elixirs? Fine, sixty spirit stones it is. Give me one bottle of *Qi-Nourishing Pills*."  

After receiving the pills, Lu Xu tentatively asked,  

"I’ve long heard of the esteemed alchemists of the Hundred Herbs Pavilion. Would it be possible to meet one of them?"  

Miao Fangxuan was taken aback, then shook her head.  

"Esteemed cultivator, that request is too difficult for this humble one. Those alchemists are extremely busy and elusive—meeting them is harder than ascending to heaven!"  

*"It seems copying an alchemist’s experience will be much harder than copying a talisman master’s,"* Lu Xu thought.  

Alchemists were generally held in higher regard and were far more valuable than talisman masters, so major factions took great care to protect them.  

Realizing that meeting an alchemist this way was impossible, Lu Xu didn’t linger. He took the pills and left.  

*"Next time, I’ll have to change my disguise again."*  

Back at home, Lu Xu opened the jade bottle to find ten yellowish, bean-sized pills inside.  

A faint fragrance wafted from them, and just the scent alone made him feel refreshed and invigorated.  

*"With a mid-lower grade spiritual root, progressing from Qi Refining first layer to second layer usually takes about a year. With these pills, that time should be significantly shortened!"*  

He planned to follow Miao Fangxuan’s advice—taking one pill every nine days to rapidly boost his cultivation.  

Of course, this wasn’t the most optimal method. The best approach would be taking one pill daily, which would multiply his cultivation speed by seven or eight times.  

But who in the cultivation world could afford to treat pills like candy?  

Even the children of wealthy cultivators didn’t enjoy such luxury.  

A few days later, Lu Xu tilled his spirit field, sowed the seeds, and then began his secluded cultivation.  

Days passed one after another.  

Half a year later, on a quiet night—  

*"Hah... I’ve finally reached Qi Refining second layer!"*  

In the meditation room on the second floor, Lu Xu opened his eyes, exhaled deeply, and smiled with satisfaction.  

After six months of arduous cultivation and consuming two bottles of *Qi-Nourishing Pills*, he had finally broken through.  

*"Hello everyone, I’m a talisman apprentice with two and a half years of cultivation experience..."* he joked inwardly.  

Closing his eyes, he turned his senses inward and observed the green qi in his dantian—originally the size of a bean, it had now grown to the size of a peanut.  

*"My spiritual power has surged!"*  

Shifting his focus, his spiritual sense entered a mysterious space within his body, where a green stone tablet stood. Inscribed on it were glowing lines of text:  

**[Name: Lu Xu]**  
**[Lifespan: 17/107]**  
**[Cultivation: Qi Refining Second Layer]**  
**[Spiritual Root: Wood (Mid-Lower)]**  
**[Cultivation Art: Green Wood Technique (Novice) 50/100]**  
**[Replication Points: 0]**  

**[Skills – Spells]:**  
- Minor Cloud Rain Technique (Novice): 98/100  
- Gengjin Sword (Novice): 91/100  
- Sharpness Technique (Novice): 77/100  

**[Skills – Talisman Crafting]:**  
- Low-Grade First-Tier Talisman Master: 27/100  

His lifespan had increased by four years.  

His talisman-crafting experience, however, hadn’t changed.  

*"I’ve used over a thousand talisman papers, yet my progress hasn’t budged. My talent for talisman-making really is lacking,"* Lu Xu thought wryly.  

But it didn’t bother him. Whether he had talent or not made no difference—he didn’t need to be a genius himself.  

As long as there were geniuses in the world, he could simply *"copy"* their hard-earned experiences with a snap of his fingers!  

The next day, Lu Xu went outside the market to harvest spirit rice.  

A voice suddenly called out to him.  

*"Huh? Little Lu, you’ve reached Qi Refining second layer already?"*  

Turning toward the voice, Lu Xu saw an elderly man with a slightly hunched back, rough and dark skin, and deep wrinkles etched into his face.  

*"Old Zhang! It’s been a while!"*  

Lu Xu smiled. This was Old Zhang, the man who had mentored him for half a year when he first started.  

*"You come early and leave early—I usually arrive around noon, so of course you haven’t seen me!"* Old Zhang slowly walked over.  

*"Didn’t you used to tend the fields early in the morning too? I picked up the habit from you. Why the change?"* Lu Xu asked curiously.  

*"It’s too quiet in the mornings now. The situation isn’t safe, so I’ve been going out later,"* Old Zhang replied, his expression grave.  

*"What do you mean?"* Lu Xu frowned, immediately serious.  

*"Rumors say bandit cultivators have appeared again,"* Old Zhang whispered.  

*"Bandit cultivators?"* Lu Xu’s heart skipped a beat.  

*"Is the news reliable?"* he asked instinctively, lowering his voice.  

*"Very. There have been too many deaths around the market lately—people with decent wealth and no known enemies."*  

*"Last month, seventeen people vanished without a trace, including a seventh-layer Qi Refining expert like Daoist Baishan. Whoever these bandits are, they’re no ordinary threat,"* Old Zhang said worriedly.  

Lu Xu’s brows furrowed. *"No wonder people have been buying more talismans lately. Did they catch wind of this?"*  

*"What’s the Mo Family saying? Have they investigated?"*  

*"No word yet. The Mo Family’s patrols are still looking into it. But we’ve seen this before—everyone knows the drill. These bandits target those with decent savings. How do they know who’s wealthy? They must have accomplices inside the market!"* Old Zhang’s voice was thick with concern.  

*"I’ve only been in the cultivation world for a few years, and already I’m caught up in this mess,"* Lu Xu sighed.  

*"You’re still new, so you don’t realize—turmoil is the norm in the cultivation world. Peaceful times are the exception. You’ll get used to it."*  

*"As spirit farmers like us, we don’t have much to steal. Bandits won’t bother with us as long as we’re careful,"* Old Zhang reassured him.  

*"How ironic—being poor is actually an advantage now,"* Lu Xu said helplessly.  

*"Is there any way to leave the spirit farming life behind?"* he asked after a moment’s thought.  

Now that he knew bandit cultivators were active, he no longer wanted to be a spirit farmer.  

With talisman-making providing enough income, why stay tied to the land?  

*"You want to quit farming? Ah, right—I heard you took out a spirit stone loan to focus on talismans."*  

*"That’s the problem. You haven’t farmed for twenty years yet—you can’t just walk away from this life,"* Old Zhang shook his head.  

*"What a pain,"* Lu Xu sighed.  

When he first started cultivating, he had signed a contract with the Mo Family—twenty years of farming in exchange for being selected from the mortal world, granted cultivation techniques, and taught the path of immortality.  

*"My advice? Stick it out for the full twenty years. You’ve only done two and a half so far. If you quit now, you’ll owe the Mo Family compensation for the remaining seventeen and a half years—six hundred pounds of spirit rice every half year. Do the math—that’s a fortune in spirit stones!"*  

Old Zhang patted Lu Xu’s shoulder, urging him not to dwell on it.  

In truth, Old Zhang had already completed his twenty-year contract but continued farming for the Mo Family afterward.  

After two decades, he was bound to the land—farming was all he knew.  

*"Sigh... I was just venting. I’ll keep farming,"* Lu Xu conceded.
