Chapter 80: The Toad Demon

The situation unfolded rapidly, and the two other Tianxing Zong disciples were caught off guard. They tried to flee, but Senior Brother Zheng let out a cold laugh, and the red glow flew towards them, trapping them in place. By then, Lin Xuan had seen that it was a burning Wu Gou sword.

"A spiritual artifact!" The two Tianxing Zong disciples turned pale, their bodies trembling.

"Senior Brother, please take the thousand-year-old lingzhi and the corpse of the mountain-eating beast. We'll say nothing about this, and you can spare our lives," they begged.

However, Senior Brother Zheng was unmoved. He operated his spiritual energy, and the artifact transformed into a swift streak, piercing through the two disciples.

With a flick of his sleeve, he collected the lingzhi and the corpse into his storage bag and vanished.

The mountain wind blew, leaving the three corpses lying forlornly on the ground.

After a while, a youth emerged from the tall grass, his expression grave. It was Lin Xuan.

Lin Xuan's brow furrowed as he gazed at the corpses. The situation seemed ordinary - a murder and a robbery, common occurrences in the cultivation world. Yet, he sensed something amiss, a hint of conspiracy in the air.

The Xiyue Jian was more treacherous than he had anticipated, and he needed to be extra cautious.

Meanwhile, the slaughter intensified, with even Foundation Establishment cultivators clashing. A fire spirit gate's two Foundation Establishment experts ambushed an elder of a certain cultivation family.

"Why are you attacking me?" the silver-haired elder exclaimed, shocked and enraged. "Our Song family has always been respectful and submissive to your gate. Have you made a mistake?"

"Ask the King of Hell in the underworld," one of the attackers sneered.

The cultivator on the left wielded a massive axe, its attacks straightforward, while the other used a soft whip, flexible and unpredictable. They worked in perfect harmony, leaving the Song elder struggling to defend himself.

As the battle raged on, the elder grew increasingly desperate. He didn't understand why they were attacking him; he had no feud with them. Was it the Fire Spirit Gate's doing?

Just then, a scream echoed as the whip bound the elder's spiritual artifact, and the axe struck, shattering his protective shield.

The elder was cleaved in two, his body bathed in blood.

In another part of the Xiyue Jian, a Fire Spirit Gate Foundation Establishment expert slaughtered over a dozen loose cultivators with ease.

Unlike those unfortunate cultivators, Lin Xuan had sensed something was off and had been cautious. His spiritual awareness was comparable to that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, allowing him to evade danger.

However, he now faced a formidable foe - a hideous toad-like creature, its body larger than a human. It emitted a cacophonous "ribbit."

"A poisonous toad, a first-rate demon beast, skilled in virulent toxins and having thick skin," Lin Xuan recalled, his expression turning grave.

The toad had been drawn to a thousand-year-old ginseng growing in the area. While ginseng wasn't rare in the cultivation world, a thousand-year-old specimen was valuable, and this one was at least three thousand years old.

Lin Xuan wasn't tempted, as he could obtain the ginseng essence using his refining method. He intended to leave, but the toad blocked his path.

The toad saw Lin Xuan as a nourishing meal, rich in spiritual energy from his frequent consumption of spiritual pills.

"Ribbit!" The toad's cry was unpleasant, and Lin Xuan's expression darkened. A first-rate demon beast was equivalent to a peak Spirit-Attuned cultivator.

Though confident in his ability to defeat the toad using his numerous magical artifacts, Lin Xuan hesitated. The Xiyue Jian was fraught with danger, and he didn't want to waste his energy or attract the Fire Spirit Gate's cultivators.

As he pondered his next move, the toad blocked the entrance, its intentions clear. Lin Xuan's expression turned grim.
