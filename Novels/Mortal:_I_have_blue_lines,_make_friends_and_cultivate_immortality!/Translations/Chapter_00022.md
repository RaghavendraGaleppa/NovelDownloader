# Chapter 22: The Congenital Dungeon Wipes Out the Sacred Body Han Laomo!

On the road to Tianwutai, Dong Xuan'er buzzed around Lin Yun like a chattering bird.

Han Li cast a resentful glance at her. Not only did he find her annoying, but what irritated him more was how their pace had slowed considerably to accommodate her. "Women are such trouble!" Han Li muttered under his breath.

What frustrated him even further was that Lin Yun seemed to be indulging her, laughing and chatting as if they were on a leisurely sightseeing trip—stopping here and there without a care.

The three of them arrived at a small hill and paused to rest.

"Brother Lin, my feet are so sore from walking. Will you carry me later?" Dong Xuan'er rubbed her ankle and leaned toward Lin Yun with a pitiful expression.

Her exaggerated demeanor was clearly an act. Seizing the opportunity to mock her, Han Li remarked, "Miss Dong, if you can't even handle this short distance, what will you do if enemies chase you in the future? Just surrender?"

"My master is the number one Golden Core cultivator in Yellow Maple Valley! No one would dare harm me!" Dong Xuan'er retorted, hands on her hips.

Unlike the bickering pair, Lin Yun remained composed, meditating with his eyes closed before calmly mediating between them.

"Little sister Xuan'er, Brother Han has a point. Let's not argue anymore."

"Brother Han, be careful—someone has been following us."

At Lin Yun's whispered warning, Han Li stiffened and scanned their surroundings warily. Apart from the intermittent chirping of insects, the area was eerily silent.

"Brother Lin, how did you know?"

"I noticed something was off when we left the Tai Nan gathering. That's why I planted detection talismans in hidden spots along the way. Several have already been triggered and burned out. There are likely six enemies."

Han Li finally understood—he had misjudged Lin Yun. The slow pace wasn't due to distraction but careful reconnaissance. He had assumed Lin Yun was swayed by beauty, but in reality, he was being vigilant.

"Han Li, you're still far too inexperienced compared to Brother Lin!"

"Brother Lin, what should we do now?"

"We can't let them keep following us. Let's deal with them here."

The moment Lin Yun finished speaking, a white ice spear erupted from the ground, aimed straight at Dong Xuan'er's head.

As the spear loomed larger in her vision, Dong Xuan'er froze, her mind blank.

"Am I going to die?"

---

"Why is this happening?"

"I'm still so young—I haven't even met my master, Grandmaster Hong Fu!"

"No—I don't want to die!"

Her survival instincts snapped her back to reality, but it was too late.

Just as the ice spear was about to pierce her skull, Lin Yun snatched it out of the air.

"Phew—"

The frigid chill of the spear brushed against her skin, and for a moment, she had glimpsed death itself. Trembling with fear, she swallowed hard before finally regaining her composure and casting a grateful look at Lin Yun.

Before she could voice her thanks, over a dozen white streaks shot from the ground, closing in instantly.

But Lin Yun was prepared. A small yellow shield materialized in front of them, effortlessly blocking the attacks—revealing them to be ice spikes.

"Little sister Xuan'er, you're far too careless. The cultivation world is fraught with danger at every turn. Your master, Grandmaster Hong Fu, won't be able to protect you forever." Lin Yun chided gently.

"You're right, Brother Lin. I understand now." Dong Xuan'er nodded obediently, promising to train harder in the future.

Watching this exchange, Han Li couldn't help but roll his eyes internally. "This woman..."

"Brother Lin's words are always wise and reasonable. But when I speak, it's just because I'm a False Spiritual Root!"

He had nothing more to say. Women!

"Why did you ambush us?" Han Li demanded coldly.

The yellow-robed attacker sneered, his eyes glinting with malice. 

"You'll find out—in your next life!"

"Scoundrels! Do you know who my master is? She's Grandmaster Hong Fu, the strongest Golden Core cultivator in Yellow Maple Valley! If you harm me, she'll hunt you down!" Dong Xuan'er threatened from behind Lin Yun.

"Hahahaha—" The yellow-robed man laughed heartily, utterly unfazed by the threat.

"A Golden Core cultivator's disciple? I've never tasted one before! Today, I'll savor the flavor!"

As the man sneered, Lin Yun flicked his wrist, sending dozens of talismans flying toward the attackers. The speed was blinding—before they could react, the talismans were upon them.

Their faces twisted in horror as they realized escape was impossible.

"Boom! Boom! Boom—"

A series of explosions erupted—flames, lightning, wooden spikes, boulders, water arrows, and ice spikes tore through the air, reducing the attackers to scattered fragments along with their terror.

---

"Brother Lin, you're amazing!" Dong Xuan'er gazed at Lin Yun with starry-eyed admiration, her gratitude and awe deepening after witnessing his power.

**[Ding! Dong Xuan'er's favorability +10. Current favorability: 75 (Deep Affection).]**

"Only five were dealt with. There's still one hiding!" Han Li remained vigilant, scanning their surroundings.

Suddenly, a golden streak shot toward him.

"Boom—"

"Ugh—!"

Han Li was sent flying, crashing through several trees before slamming into a boulder, which cracked under the impact.

"Guh—"

A trickle of blood escaped his lips.

His heart pounded violently, his face pale with lingering fear. Glancing down, he saw his chest had caved inward.

"Phew—"

Han Li shuddered in relief. Fortunately, after the incident with Lu Yunfeng's ambush, he had traded for a high-grade defensive artifact—Chainmail Armor—from Lin Yun. Without it, that strike would have killed him instantly.

Looking up, he spotted the golden ring that had struck him.

"Oh? Surviving a hit from my Crimson Gold Ring? You must have at least a high-grade defensive artifact." A lanky, middle-aged man in yellow robes emerged from the ground.

When Han Li got a clear look, his expression darkened further, his voice trembling. "A Foundation Establishment cultivator!"

Dong Xuan'er was equally terrified. Never had she imagined their ambushers would include a Foundation Establishment expert. Panicked, she tugged at Lin Yun's sleeve.

"Brother Lin, let's run! He's a Foundation Establishment cultivator—we're no match for him as Qi Condensation cultivators!"

"While he's focused on Han Li, we can escape!"

She hadn't whispered, and Han Li overheard, his expression darkening.

"Will Brother Lin abandon me?"

"Probably. Survival comes first."

"If it were me, I'd run too."

"Tch—scared by a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator?" Lin Yun scoffed. "Brother Han and I are sworn friends. How could I abandon him?"

"Wait, why did the ambushers escalate to a Foundation Establishment expert?"

"Could it be because..." Lin Yun glanced subtly at Han Li.

"This guy really is a congenital dungeon team-wiper!"

---

"Luckily, I'm tough and capable!"

"Brother Lin is so heroic! Even in such danger, he refuses to abandon his friend. What a man!" Dong Xuan'er gazed at Lin Yun with infatuation.

**[Ding! Han Li's favorability +10. Current favorability: 80 (Deep Brotherhood).]**

**[Ding! Dong Xuan'er's favorability +5. Current favorability: 80 (Genuine Affection).]**

**[Ding! Dong Xuan'er's favorability has reached 80. Reward available for extraction.]**

Ignoring the system prompts for now, Lin Yun stepped forward boldly. "A Foundation Establishment cultivator? I'll crush him!"

"You've chosen death!"

"Hahahaha—" The lanky Foundation Establishment cultivator roared with laughter at Lin Yun's audacity.

"A mere Qi Condensation cultivator dares to boast about killing me?!"

"What a joke!"
