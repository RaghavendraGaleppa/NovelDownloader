# Chapter 99: The Emperor Cannot Become Immortal!

The screams finally subsided after a long while.

Jia Shifang, his face swollen and bruised, hurriedly covered it with his monk's robe.

"If you're so good at naming things, why not call yourself Li Erbi?"

"Second Brother, how did you know the backup name I picked for you?"

"..."

"Besides Li Erpu and Li Erbi, there's also Li Erniu... I was even considering changing your identity to our Jia family lineage and naming you Jia Zhengjing."

Jia Shifang said seriously, "Actually, back then, my aunt was deeply favored by the family and was supposed to take in a son-in-law. Unfortunately, she fell for my uncle instead. Since the Li family was a prominent clan, the marriage wasn't matrilocal, so my aunt married into their family. My father often says you should have been surnamed Jia... Ouch... Second Brother, stop hitting me!"

After a while, Jia Shifang's face was swollen like a pig's head, and his speech was slurred. "Second Brother, there's one more thing. If you really don't like the name, you don’t have to take it. No need to hit me again... because you might not be a fugitive anymore."

"What do you mean?" Li Zhengjing was stunned.

"The new master of Guyue Peak in the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect announced yesterday at noon that there were hidden circumstances in the Spirit Mine case. They’re reinvestigating it. Though not explicitly stated, the implication is that you were likely framed. The sect has temporarily revoked the bounty on you!"

Jia Shifang rubbed his swollen face and added, "If that’s the case, you won’t have to keep hiding under a false identity as a sect traitor."

"Really?" Li Zhengjing was surprised. "Since when did Chen Zhu become so kind-hearted as to clear my name?"

"Not so fast..." Yuan Zhengfeng interjected. "Even if your initial charges were false, you still took hundreds of spirit stones—reported as three thousand—and consumed them all. The charge of embezzlement is still valid..."

"Then what’s Chen Zhu’s game?" Li Zhengjing asked. "You’ve dealt with him for decades. Any idea what he’s scheming?"

"Chen Zhu isn’t a magnanimous man. I suspect the main peak pressured him." Yuan Zhengfeng continued, "Chen Zhu has only just become a Human Immortal and barely entered the sect’s upper echelons. His authority is still shaky, and many are dissatisfied with him. He’s the perfect scapegoat."

"Scapegoat?" Li Zhengjing raised an eyebrow.

"The sect publicly declared you a traitor for stealing spirit stones. That verdict was final—no room for reversal."

"Before, even if you were innocent, the theft charge was already publicized. You’d have carried that stigma forever because it concerned the sect’s reputation."

"But now, reopening the case damages the sect’s credibility. It’s a self-inflicted blow to their dignity."

Yuan Zhengfeng explained, "Since the new announcement comes from Guyue Peak under Chen Zhu, he’s the one taking the heat. Given his pride, he’d never do this unless forced."

He sighed. "Truth is, your talent is too extraordinary. Cultivating for just a year, you defeated Lu Huaiyuan and revealed the potential of the Azure Dao Body."

"For the sect, your future is limitless. Recruiting you back means gaining another Human Immortal—possibly even the next Azure Dao Sovereign, an unrivaled genius who could lead the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect to supremacy."

"Compared to that, what’s three thousand spirit stones, a minor disciplinary action, or Chen Zhu’s pride?"

"If you return now, you won’t be punished. Instead, you’ll receive more resources than even Lu Huaiyuan. Once the storm passes, you’ll become the true Dao Child—the sect’s heir apparent."

"Of course, it’s not that simple. To the higher-ups, your theft and desertion prove disloyalty. They’ll find ways to bind you to the sect."

As a former enforcer, Yuan Zhengfeng was all too familiar with such machinations.

Hearing this, Li Zhengjing sighed. "In that case, I’d rather keep wandering the world."

After resting overnight, he set off for the capital.

But Jia Shifang insisted on joining him.

"Why are you going?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"The Crown Prince is dead," Jia Shifang said. "The Emperor is old, and the princes are vying for the throne, recruiting talents. Many rogue cultivators are heading to the capital to back a contender, hoping for future rewards—just like the current State Preceptor."

"What does that have to do with the Diamond Temple?" Li Zhengjing glanced at him.

"Second Brother, you don’t understand. The imperial court rules the Central Plains. Even the three immortal sects and two Buddhist sects nominally submit to its authority." Jia Shifang lowered his voice. "Every faction wants to infiltrate the capital, secure high positions, and funnel benefits back to their sects..."

"You’re too conspicuous as a monk," Li Zhengjing said wryly.

"No worries. I’m a new Diamond Temple disciple. Since cultivating Buddhist techniques, I’ve grown robust, my complexion darkened—nothing like the elegant youth I once was. Plus, I’m not as flashy as you. Few would recognize me."

Jia Shifang added, "There are countless Buddhist cultivators—wandering monks, temple disciples—no less than Daoist practitioners."

"Let’s go." Li Zhengjing waved dismissively, then murmured, "People keep saying the Emperor is old. Hasn’t his reign been relatively short?"

"He ascended at thirty-four and is now seventy-six—forty-two years in power," Yuan Zhengfeng replied.

"The supreme ruler of the Central Plains, and at seventy-six, he’s on death’s door?" Li Zhengjing was surprised. "He’s not a Human Immortal?"

"Since the Great Zhou Dynasty’s founding, only the founding emperor reached Human Immortal realm. In the centuries since, spanning twenty-odd emperors, none surpassed the True Qi stage."

Yuan Zhengfeng said, "Some say the Creditor left a curse—emperors cannot become immortals. Others claim the three immortal sects and two Buddhist sects suppress them."

He lowered his voice further. "The Great Zhou’s founding emperor controlled the Central Plains’ territory, wielding imperial fortune so mighty even the three sect leaders feared him. Only the hidden Creditor could restrain him."

"If later emperors reached such heights, how could the sects hold their heads high?"

"Though I don’t know the truth, I’m certain the Great Zhou emperors’ inability to become Human Immortals is the only way the factions remain at ease, maintaining the world’s balance."

"Did you know? During the founding emperor’s reign, imperial authority was absolute. Even the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect’s six-thousand-li jurisdiction had court-appointed officials—the sect couldn’t interfere."

"Only after his death, with the court weakened, did they concede. Since then, the sect governs its own territory, appointing officials without court oversight."

"Now, with the Floating Mist Sect’s troubles, the court clearly aims to reclaim authority."

Yuan Zhengfeng mused, "Still, though the Great Zhou emperors are only at the True Qi stage, the founding emperor left behind imperial treasures only the royal bloodline can wield—enough to awe the world."

Li Zhengjing understood. "Like the method to activate the Palace Pillar of Suppression, passed down only to the royal family."

"Exactly. There are other imperial treasures too. Moreover, the emperor, blessed with imperial fortune, can command them effortlessly."

Li Zhengjing vaguely grasped that figures like the Southern Domain’s Divine Mother, though sustained by imperial worship, were also under the court’s control—specifically, the emperor’s.

Though the current State Preceptor killed the Divine Mother, his fame stemmed not just from his Human Immortal cultivation but also the imperial fortune bestowed by the emperor—which the emperor could revoke at will.

"This is the Great Zhou emperor’s supreme authority. Though he can’t become a Human Immortal, he commands all cultivators—Human Immortals and deities alike. Even the three immortal sects dare not openly defy imperial decrees."

Yuan Zhengfeng said, "In essence, the Great Zhou Dynasty is mightier than the three immortal sects. And the sects’ greatest relief is that the emperor, though supremely powerful in authority, isn’t the strongest in cultivation."

Li Zhengjing realized, "If the Great Zhou emperor were invincible and ruled eternally, with the Central Plains’ fortune at his command, the entire mortal world would bow to him."

Yuan Zhengfeng agreed. "The current system—where the throne changes hands every few decades—is the most stable arrangement for all cultivation factions."

Li Zhengjing nodded and continued toward the capital.

Originally, he planned to change his appearance under a new identity. But since the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect had temporarily lifted his traitor status, there was no need.

"Second Brother, the capital’s crawling with all sorts. Your reputation precedes you. Three thousand spirit stones are enough to tempt even Human Immortals. Sure you don’t want a new identity?" Jia Shifang leaned in. "Li Erpu has a nice ring to it..."

"No need." Li Zhengjing was calm. "Since I’m no longer a sect traitor, I’ll be fine in the capital. As for afterward, I have plans."

"Alright. But that little girl..." Jia Shifang hesitated. "She looks about four or five. Did you father a secret love child at twelve or thirteen, hiding her from Uncle and Aunt? No wonder I didn’t know..."

"This monk seems brain-dead," the wall-clinging bird muttered. "Tree Lord, he’s dumber than you."

"Obviously. Since returning from Fengdu Mountain, I’ve grown a brain—much smarter than this fool." The tree waved its roots smugly. "Haven’t you noticed I haven’t been beaten lately?"

"True." The bird nodded. Since returning from the underworld, the tree had grown stronger, beating the bird regularly, and seemed to have gained intelligence—as if the underworld’s Yin energy had gifted it a brain.

"Second Brother, shouldn’t we hire a carriage? Walking’s tiring." Jia Shifang complained.

"Waste of money. It’ll probably get wrecked soon anyway," Li Zhengjing grumbled.

"Really?" Jia Shifang perked up. "I bought treasures before leaving, with no chance to use them. If someone attacks, I can enlighten them!"

After half a day’s travel, no ambush came—perhaps because Li Zhengjing had kept a low profile lately.

But nearing the capital, cultivators grew more numerous, their attire and speech varied, hailing from all corners.

Many were at the True Qi stage, but more were at the Internal Qi stage, even some body refiners seeking imperial service—hoping for rewards, techniques, or resources to advance their cultivation.

"Many are from sects, hiding their identities," Yuan Zhengfeng noted. "Even among the same realm, their auras vary wildly. Some with two or three hundred True Qi apertures seem weaker than newly ascended True Qi cultivators from our sect."

"Some rogue cultivators have their own fortunes," Li Zhengjing observed. "See that youth? Internal Qi peak, but his foundation’s solid—no weaker than sect disciples. And he carries a fierce killing intent..."

"His clothes and accent suggest the southeast region," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "But how do you know he’s a rogue cultivator?"

"I can tell."

Li Zhengjing glanced at the youth, sensing his sharp aura. With his superior cultivation, he didn’t need to expend much energy to discern the details.

**Shi Yuan, 17.**
**Cultivation: Internal Qi Peak.**
**Origin: Hongshan Town, Southeast Region. Rogue Cultivator.**
**Fortune: At eight, swept away by a tidal wave, saved by a sea creature and left on a deserted island. There, he obtained the White Deer Sovereign’s cultivation manual, mystic sword art, and thirty-two body-refining pills. After seven years of training, he reached Internal Qi Peak and returned home.**
**Two months ago, hearing of the capital’s recruitment of talents, he set out to break through to True Qi and secure future resources.**

"Elder Yuan, ever heard of the White Deer Sovereign?" Li Zhengjing asked suddenly.

"A Human Immortal from a thousand years ago. Founded a sect with an ancient manual." Yuan Zhengfeng said. "After the Great Zhou unified the Central Plains, his sect collapsed. He fled eastward overseas and never returned. Why?"

"Because—" Li Zhengjing began, then paused, looking ahead.

A hundred imperial guards stood in formation. Among them, a young officer was bound, his armor still on, hair disheveled.

"Second Brother..." Jia Shifang whispered. "Isn’t that Eldest Brother’s trusted subordinate, Li Yun? If he’s arrested, where’s Eldest Brother?"

"Find out." Li Zhengjing ordered.

"On it!"

Jia Shifang hurried off and soon returned with news, bought from locals with silver.

"After the Crown Prince’s death, the capital’s in chaos. Rules are strict, especially with so many outsiders arriving—many with skills. They say martial prowess breeds defiance, so disorder’s inevitable. Eldest Brother was recently transferred to the imperial guards. Today, he sent Li Yun on patrol. They spotted someone suspicious, but the man died during capture..."

Li Zhengjing frowned. "Who was it?"

Jia Shifang looked uneasy. "That official from the Court of Judicial Review—Guo Xinnu. The one I argued with before. Word is his entire family was slaughtered this morning."

Li Zhengjing’s voice turned grim. "They pinned it on Li Yun?"

Jia Shifang shook his head. "Li Yun confessed outright—said Eldest Brother ordered it."
