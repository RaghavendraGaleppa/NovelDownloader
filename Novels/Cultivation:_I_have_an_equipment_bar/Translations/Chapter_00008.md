# Chapter 8: Spirit-Devouring Flower and Rewards

Cultivation knows no calendar, and time passes unheeded.

In the blink of an eye, seven days had already passed.

Although he had achieved Qi Condensation and become a cultivator, he still hadn't neglected his work in the spirit fields. He toiled during the day and cultivated at night. It was a life of hardship, yet peaceful.

Over these past few days, Elder Lin had witnessed Zhang Yan's terrifying talent.

Elder Lin knew that Zhang Yan had learned Wood Origin Art from Enlightenment Peak. Wood Origin Art was a common spell for spirit plant masters. However, because everyone's comprehension varied, the extent of their cultivation differed. Elder Lin himself had also cultivated Wood Origin Art, taking a full three years just to achieve minor mastery.

Yet, now he stared blankly at Zhang Yan.

Zhang Yan merely extended a hand, and a wisp of emerald green light instantly condensed in his palm. With a light tap of his finger, the green light burst forth, drilling into a spirit rice plant. The effect was remarkably potent. The spirit rice visibly grew taller by several inches, and the almost fully developed rice ears miraculously became plumper.

Wood Origin Art, minor mastery!

Elder Lin couldn't believe it had only been seven days.

"Even a single spirit stone would be good, ah. There's no helping it, when one is poor, one's ambitions are limited, that's just how it is," Zhang Yan muttered, perhaps reflecting on his situation. "It's a shame, though, my current cultivation level is too low, only first-layer Qi Condensation. I can't cast spells more than a few times. Otherwise, I feel my spell progress could definitely be even faster."

Hearing this, Elder Lin expressionlessly turned around and walked away. *This person is showing off too much!* He thought. *After seven days, he's achieved minor mastery in a spell and he's still not satisfied.*

"However, my daughter hasn't been over in a while, has she? I should call her back for a visit," Elder Lin mused to himself, looking at Zhang Yan's youthful face.

After finishing weeding the fields, Zhang Yan checked the time and headed straight for Enlightenment Peak. Today was the Wood Origin Art class. Since Zhang Yan had learned this spell, he naturally wanted to attend the lesson properly.

Arriving at Enlightenment Peak and entering the Enlightenment Hall, he immediately spotted Mu Sen. At this time, quite a few people had already gathered inside. Mu Sen also gave Zhang Yan a slight nod. Ordinary disciples might not catch Mu Sen's attention, but Zhang Yan was simply too easy to recognize.

"When Wood Origin Art reaches grand completion, it can even instantly cultivate a mature plant, like this." Mu Sen took out a seed from his hand. As he channeled his spiritual energy, the seed quickly rooted, sprouted, grew branches, and spread leaves. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a flower with a large mouth and sharp teeth inside. The flower flailed its petals like claws, letting out a silent roar at its surroundings.

"This..." The crowd gasped in astonishment at this sight. They had never imagined that a single seed could burst forth with such potent battle power in an instant.

"This is a Spirit-Devouring Flower," Mu Sen explained. "It possesses no sentience but will attack targets that possess spiritual energy. Its battle power isn't high, only reaching the late-stage Qi Condensation at its strongest. However, because it can be rapidly cultivated using Wood Origin Art, it's very practical."

"Whoever among you can achieve initial mastery of Wood Origin Art first, I will reward them with 10 Spirit-Devouring Flower seeds," Mu Sen said with a smile, looking at everyone present.

"Initial mastery of Wood Origin Art grants Spirit-Devouring Flower seeds?" Zhang Yan's eyes lit up upon hearing this.
