Chapter 394: Thousand Forms Manual, Justified and Righteous

Li Mo emerged from the main peak's great hall carrying a vegetable basket, intending to return to Autumn Water Pavilion first. But as soon as he descended the main peak, he saw Xiao Qin waiting for him not far away.

A scar now ran through the corner of his eye, adding a touch of weathered experience to his steady features. Yet upon seeing Li Mo, he still revealed that familiar smile.

"The Wind-Slaying Broken Sword?" Li Mo teased with a laugh.

The once outer disciple on the verge of being expelled from the sect, Old Xiao, was now a genius on the Hidden Dragon List. Although Li Mo's own ranking was high, that was only because he had a system. Making it into the top hundred young talents of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands was no easy feat.

Xiao Qin tossed over a wine gourd and replied with a smile, "The Wife-Blessed..."

"Cough, cough!"

"Uh, the Divine Hammer..."

"Forget it, just call me by the first one."

Li Mo took a couple of gulps of wine, looking at Xiao Qin with some envy.

Look at this guy, why are his nicknames so pleasant to the ear? Although Old Xiao barely made it onto the Hidden Dragon List, from now on, when he travels the Jianghu and announces his name, the whole crowd would have to treat him with solemn respect.

As for himself... the moment he announces his nickname, the whole crowd bursts out laughing...

"It's just empty fame, Brother Li, why bother caring about it? Those two nicknames are actually... also quite nice to hear," Xiao Qin said.

"Old Xiao, it's hard to hold it in. If you want to laugh, just laugh," Li Mo sighed.

Old Xiao had a somewhat serious personality and usually wouldn't laugh.

Unless he really couldn't hold it in.

A moment later, Xiao Qin wiped the tears of laughter from the corners of his eyes. He laughed for a while, then fell silent. He had just been to the main peak's great hall and happened to know what had happened.

The two of them took turns taking sips, silently drinking.

Until they were flushed with heat from the drink, Xiao Qin finally let out a long breath of white vapor.

"You're really foolish, truly. Even if that wasn't Little Jiang today, you probably wouldn't have just stood by and watched."

"There are so many injustices in the Jianghu. If you try to handle every single one, how could you possibly manage? You even dared to strike the Crown Prince."

"I didn't actually strike him, did I?" Li Mo shrugged.

Xiao Qin sighed, helpless. "If you hadn't truly intended to make a move, that Seventh Realm掌玄 (Palm Profound) expert wouldn't have shown himself."

"A Palm Profound... when they fight, it's enough to destroy heaven and earth."

"Having gone out and seen the Jianghu, you're still the same..."

Xiao Qin suddenly frowned and spat. "Where did this broken gourd get sand from!"

He put away the wine gourd and pulled out a booklet from his robe.

"If you really do plan to leave, I know of a route in the Western Regions that the Great Yu can't control. The local customs and geography are all written in here. Take it back and have a look."

Leaving the booklet behind, he waved his hand and turned to leave.

Li Mo flipped through the booklet and couldn't help but laugh.

Xiao Qin seemed to have changed, but he was still that same Old Xiao, still so bad with words.

In his heart, he was probably dying for the day Li Mo would pull Jiang Yu down from the top of the Hidden Dragon List.

On the cover of the booklet was clearly written:

*Thousand Forms Manual*

Li Mo tucked away the first true divine art he had obtained, not relying on his system, and then returned to Autumn Water Pavilion.

Autumn Water Pavilion had already been cleaned until it was spotless, everything exactly as it had been when they left.

The beautiful master in her palace gown lay reclining on a lounge chair, squinting as she drank. There was no sun today, so it was unclear what she was sunbathing.

The ice sculpture, clad in silver, became the touch of snow within Autumn Water Pavilion. She lowered her eyes to drink tea and read, serene and tranquil.

"You're back," Shang Wu said, bouncing up from the lounge chair to look inside the vegetable basket.

Ying Bing raised her eyes, looked at Li Mo for a few seconds, and then asked softly, "Something happened?"

Li Mo: "!"

He hadn't even said anything yet!

Even the Heaven's Fate Divine Eye wasn't this fast!

"Yeah, and the trouble I stirred up isn't small," Li Mo nodded honestly.

"Oh?" Shang Wu's flower-like face lit up with excitement, and she looked at her disciple with a hint of approval. It gave the feeling of a child growing up.

"What kind of trouble did you stir up? Tell your master about it."

"......"

Li Mo glanced at his carefree master and recounted the events.

Shang Wu leaned back slightly, gave a thumbs-up, and poked her disciple's shoulder with her elbow.

"Not bad, kid. I thought you didn't like to stir up trouble, but you gave me such a big surprise all at once. Truly worthy of being my disciple."

"Don't get arrogant, now." It had the vibe of a gang leader praising a subordinate.

Li Mo coughed lightly and naturally replied, "Alright, I'll keep up the good work..."

"Hm?" Ying Bing's serene gaze fell upon him, her delicate brows slightly furrowed.

"Cough..." Li Mo came to his senses, realizing his words were inappropriate. He had almost beaten up the Crown Prince, and now he was talking about "keeping up the good work"?

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and pondered for a moment before saying softly, "You did well."

This time, it was Li Mo's turn to be stunned. When had the ice sculpture ever started praising him for stirring up trouble, just like his master?

Ying Bing set down her teacup and said calmly, "Many things that are inevitable are troublesome. If you have to stir them up, then stir them up."

Just a Crown Prince.

She had beaten up more than just him.

"!" Li Mo hadn't seen that hint of domineering aura from Ying Bing in a long time.

"Right, for example, the matter of raising the banner of rebellion," Shang Wu said, stroking her chin and squinting her almond eyes, like a dog-headed military advisor. "The time is ripe. Why don't we take this opportunity to ambush a troop on the main peak tomorrow, get rid of姜禹 (Jiang Yu), and then raise the banner of rebellion!"

"You have money and grain, you're the Divine Hammer Little Tyrant, and you have Little Bing'er to assist you. How could the great cause possibly fail?"

"So, Master, what part will you be mainly responsible for?" Li Mo's mouth twitched.

Shang Wu said matter-of-factly, "Don't you know that rebellions need to be justified?"

"And so?"

"I'll be your Grand Emperor, and then you'll be justified!"

"......"

Li Mo suddenly felt that Elder Han He's suggestion to get the master drunk and lock her up wasn't entirely due to personal grudges.

He silently took out two bottles of Immortal's Drunk and handed them to Shang Wu.

"I'm a little hungry," Ying Bing said, and only then did a hint of seriousness appear on her jade-like face.

The kitchen of Autumn Water Pavilion once again welcomed its Chef Li.

She watched the cooking smoke rising from the kitchen, her ice-mirror-like eyes narrowing slightly.

"The Crown Prince has two sword maidens by his side, one is青雀 (Green Sparrow), the other is丹枝 (Cinnabar Twig). Both come from the Heavenly Mountain Sword Manor, understand combined attack techniques, and are ranked on the Human List."

"If she were to fight them two at once, how many moves could they withstand?"

"My current realm is still too low... there are still many things I can't do..."

Ying Bing picked up Frost and Moon's Yin, and began to dance lightly in the courtyard under the newly fallen moonlight.

The sword techniques she used in her left and right hands were completely different, like two paths diverging.
