# Chapter 2: This World is Full of Dangers

Lu Jinyin had come to burn incense.

After donating some silver fragments to the donation box, he watched as the master and disciple searched everywhere for incense sticks. 

It was his first time seeing such an unprofessional Taoist temple. But considering this was the Yuanshen Temple, he calmed down—everyone in Willow Town knew the priests here weren't very capable.

Still, since he was already here, he might as well wait.

Xiao Ji rummaged through a box and pulled out a bundle of incense sticks.

[These are damp sandalwood incense sticks, but they can still burn.]

His master also found a fire starter. After some effort, they barely managed to light the incense and handed it to the worshipper.

This was the first person to come burn incense and make wishes since the Yuanshen Temple's reputation had declined. The last time they saw a worshipper's silver was probably three months ago, so they were indeed a bit rusty in their duties.

Lu Jinyin was quite patient. Taking the incense, he maintained his politeness and made his wishes before the temple's ancestral statue. 

Taoists in this world didn't worship the Three Pure Ones—after all, their mythological origins were different, a topic Xiao Ji had once researched.

"I've even come to Yuanshen Temple to pray—that's sincere enough, right? I've visited every Taoist temple, Buddhist monastery, and cultivation sect big and small inside and outside Willow Town. I just beg the heavens to let my poor wife give birth soon and spare her further suffering..."

After muttering to himself for a while, he opened his eyes to place the incense—and was startled.

The young Taoist was standing extremely close to him, barely three inches away.

[Lu Jinyin has visited all thirty-two cultivation sites in Willow Town, hoping his wife—pregnant for three years and six months—can finally give birth. He wishes to move heaven and earth with his sincerity...]

[Burning incense is just his first step. Over the next three days, he plans to spend a considerable sum to invite skilled practitioners to his home to solve the problem, as his wife can't hold on much longer.]

[Deep perception gained. Cultivation +3.]

Xiao Ji received this information.

Through this close encounter, he gained further insight into his abilities.

The conclusion was: initial perception provides general information. If interested in the target, deeper perception yields more details.

This was well demonstrated with Lu Jinyin.

He learned why the man had come to the ineffective Yuanshen Temple—it was all about childbirth.

But upon reflection, the situation was bizarre. What kind of pregnancy lasts three years and six months without delivery? Even Nezha would have been born by now.

Of course, the key point here was the money. This Mr. Lu intended to spend heavily to solve his problem.

And the Yuanshen Temple was running low on funds. Without income from worshippers, the temple would eventually have to be sold. A wealthy family had already taken an interest in the location and made an offer, though the master was still considering it.

"Little Taoist, what are you...?" Lu Jinyin was puzzled by the priest's behavior.

Xiao Ji straightened his robes and put some distance between them, solemnly saying, "I observed that you, kind sir, are shrouded in sorrow, so I approached to discern the cause."

Hearing this, Lu Jinyin's eyes widened. "Did you discover anything?"

Xiao Ji curled his lips and made a calculating gesture with his fingers. "Heaven's secrets..."

Before he could finish, Lu Jinyin was already stuffing silver into the donation box—he'd seen this routine many times before and decided to cut to the chase.

"How is your wife's emotional state?" Xiao Ji got straight to the point.

The mention of his wife shocked Lu Jinyin. He hadn't breathed a word about his troubles, yet the priest had pinpointed them directly.

"To be frank, I've been visiting temples and donating silver everywhere for my wife's difficult pregnancy... Her condition is worsening, and she's in great pain," Lu Jinyin tearfully explained his plight. "Do you have any solutions, Reverend?"

Lu Jinyin remained somewhat cautious, having encountered many charlatans before. Even renowned mystics near Willow Town and midwives boasting unparalleled delivery skills had failed him.

Those people had also acted mysteriously and spoken profoundly, but in the end, it had all been for nothing.

"I wouldn't dare claim to have a solution. To understand the essence of any matter, one must observe it closely before drawing conclusions," Xiao Ji said.

Not wanting to miss any opportunity, Lu Jinyin invited Xiao Ji to his home in three days. That day, he would gather all the experts he could find to collectively address the childbirth issue.

Xiao Ji expressed his willingness to help.

After all, if he couldn't solve it, there'd be no loss.

Escorting the worshipper to the main hall's entrance, Xiao Ji watched him leave as dusk deepened into twilight.

He looked up at the sky, wanting to express his feelings.

[Year 10086 of the Great Li Dynasty, early winter. Willow Town in Longxiang County will experience light snow turning to heavy snow from this evening until tomorrow afternoon. The snowfall will last three days with a sharp temperature drop. Please keep warm and prepare firewood...]

"Even this works?"

Though he'd begun understanding his abilities, getting a weather forecast from a single glance at the sky made him realize he'd underestimated his potential.

A snowflake descended from the heavens, landing on Xiao Ji's fingertip with the wind.

[This is a snowflake with six petals. Its life will end in two breaths, after which it will cease to exist in this world.]

It melted in an instant.

"The universe is indeed changing—it's snowing," Xiao Ji murmured. "This year's first snow has come much earlier than usual."

Closing the temple doors to block the incoming cold wind, he turned to look at his master.

The old Taoist was already asleep in his recliner.

In fact, he'd begun dozing off before Lu Jinyin left. Age indeed brought drowsiness.

Xiao Ji found a thick coat to cover his master, then lit a brazier and moved it near the recliner for warmth.

As he adjusted the coals with an iron hook, Xiao Ji pondered the strange case of Lu Jinyin's wife and her three-and-a-half-year pregnancy.

He suspected supernatural interference. Superficially, it seemed the womb likely didn't contain a human child. If it was some sinister fetus, his second-level Qi Refining cultivation might allow him to identify the problem but probably not overcome it.

The specifics would require on-site observation. If his perception revealed something manageable, he'd handle it himself; otherwise, he'd reconsider.

Supernatural incidents weren't uncommon in towns, as this world was inherently unstable.

The land teemed with demons and monsters, ghosts and evil spirits, with numerous dark sects. Beyond the mundane world's schemes and machinations, consider the evil dragons of the Eastern Sea, the ancient giant tribes of the Northern Sea, the demonic lands of the West, and the fiends of the Eternal Dark Realm—all masters of wreaking havoc...

Even among human cultivators, turmoil reigned. Many mighty figures would move mountains to crush foes, boil rivers for fish, or part seas for meat based on mere pride...

Recalling the stories he'd heard, Xiao Ji found it all terrifying.

This world was full of dangers.

But now things were different. He could discern fortune from misfortune. With sufficient caution, he could continuously grow stronger while avoiding disasters.

"Now, no one can make me submit easily," Xiao Ji imagined various dramatic confrontations with evil forces.

"I'm hungry—make dinner!" His master stretched and woke up.

"Right away, Master." Xiao Ji headed to the kitchen.
