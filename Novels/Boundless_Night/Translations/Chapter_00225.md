Chapter 225: The Truth Behind the Kunling Quasi-Divine Records

In the Desiccated Hall, an elder with a nearly rotten physique sat high upon a stone platform. He expounded the Desiccation Scripture, which encompassed the true meaning of everything from the sun setting at noon to the decline of all things from prosperity to decay. As he lectured, the aura of decay on his body reached its peak, as if he could perish at any moment and turn into dust. Behind him, a sickly tree also changed accordingly, its green leaves yellowing, its bark cracking, until finally its withered leaves fell, its branches bare, becoming a dead tree.

Qin Ming showed surprise. Although the elder resembled a ghost, he wasn't speaking nonsense. This was a very important scripture, worth serious study. He suspected that it might be related to the Desiccation and Flourishing Scripture he longed for, covering a large part of it. Qin Ming sat quietly on a meditation cushion, silently memorizing the scripture. With his comprehension, even though the Desiccation Scripture was extremely profound, he could still "take it in." He wasn't the only one sitting in meditation; dense figures, as if from different times and spaces, were present. Some pondered deeply, some scratched their ears and cheeks in frustration, and some sighed bitterly. Clearly, with the elder only lecturing the Desiccation Scripture once like this, many found it difficult to grasp its true essence.

The lecturer, whose aged skin clung to his face, seemed deeply surprised by Qin Ming's comprehension. His murky eyes turned towards him, and he bared his teeth in a smile. Such a sideways smile was quite eerie; the shriveled flesh on his face almost fell off in large chunks, already crumbling. Qin Ming had been on guard, fearing that this lecturer might eventually become a malevolent ghost and claim his life. How could one obtain a scripture without paying a price?

"Just now, I lectured on the core of the Desiccation Scripture. By understanding the changes of prosperity and decay, and evolving it to the highest level, one can also obtain the Flourishing Scripture." The elder demonstrated on the spot. His aged state instantly changed; his decaying body began to show vitality. Behind him, the dead tree came back to life, also reviving. He began to lecture again, but Qin Ming couldn't hear it. These profound meanings were only for some blurry figures on the meditation cushions. Qin Ming felt restless, itching for more. He was not among the "listeners."

"If no one can comprehend it, then so be it." The elder suddenly stopped. His body remained withered, and the sickly tree was about to sprout new buds but held them back. "Above Desiccation and Flourishing, there is an even greater 'Waxing and Waning Scripture'. If one can comprehend it, what is there to fear from ghostly attacks? One can go anywhere in the world."

Qin Ming was instantly shaken upon hearing this. From this tone, wasn't the elder the same as the malevolent ghosts lurking in the black mist? At the same time, he remembered the Waxing and Waning Scripture. It surpassed the scope of top-tier profound arts like the Desiccation and Flourishing Scripture; it was its higher-level continuation, an extraordinary secret tome. The elder spoke of the origin of the words 'Waxing and Waning': "The I Ching records: 'The sun declines when it reaches its zenith, the moon wanes when it is full; heaven and earth wax and wane...'" Clearly, the Waxing and Waning Scripture could rival the World-Preserving Scripture, a secret tome from after the B-Wood Scripture. The World-Preserving Scripture still belonged to the wood domain, but the Waxing and Waning Scripture was no longer in this category.

Qin Ming secretly drew his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber because, according to rumors, he had to be ready for a great battle with this unfathomable old ghost at any moment! However, after the lecture, the elder showed no further intentions. Qin Ming saluted and then retreated from the Desiccated Hall. Nothing happened at all. Little Wu said, "Brother, are you too weak? Does he not fancy your meager flesh?" Qin Ming remained cautious, retreating several hundred meters before saying, "What kind of blunt truth are you spouting?"

Boom! From afar, a tremendous commotion was heard. Sand and stones flew, and a rare stone mountain in the Gobi Desert had its cliff face pierced through, large chunks breaking off. The two immediately hid, wanting to observe quietly. However, the next moment, their expressions changed; the dust cloud was heading towards their area. It was as if a giant beast was stirring up a sky-filling sandstorm in the vast, desolate Gobi. The two turned and ran, but behind them, grains of sand blew, engulfing them.

At the same time, the two smelled blood and saw a white-haired elder rushing past them. With a flicker of divine consciousness, he flung blood from his body onto them. Qin Ming and Little Wu couldn't block it at all; their protective light was pierced, and their skin and flesh ached terribly. "This old fellow wants us to be scapegoats!" The two instantly understood that the elder was being pursued by a malevolent ghost and, upon seeing them along the way, had conveniently dragged them down. Behind them, the ground cracked. A disheveled monster, human-shaped, skin and bones like a corpse-ghost, was chasing them in large strides.

The two turned and fled towards the edge of the Gobi. As long as they left the black mist area and returned to the outside, the malevolent ghost wouldn't follow. The monster's speed far exceeded their imagination; it was too fast, as if flying across the ground, arriving in the blink of an eye. Its withered hand, carrying dark light and flowing mist, struck forward. A dull thud sounded like thunder striking flat ground. Qin Ming had no time to dodge; when he was swept by the dark light, his body flew horizontally, coughing up large mouthfuls of blood. Moreover, his flesh ruptured, and his physical body nearly exploded. This made him feel the threat of death. Just one blow, not even a direct hit, had severely wounded him. This monster was at least in the Third Realm. Little Wu also screamed. Although they ran separately, he was still hit, covered in blood.

"The old fellow in front is your target!" Qin Ming shouted. Little Wu also cried out, "Exactly! How much meat do we two have? Our cultivation is low, not enough for you to eat!" Both were filled with immense hatred. The old fellow who had dragged them down might actually escape smoothly by using them to slightly delay the pursuer, as they were not far from the outside world. They dared not delay, fleeing desperately while spitting blood.

The gaunt monster, with its messy, straw-like dry yellow hair, stiff face, and empty eyes, nevertheless targeted them specifically for attack. When the dark light swept over for the second time, Qin Ming blocked it with his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber. The saber body vibrated violently, and he was sent flying by the dark light, as if struck by a mountain. Qin Ming's arms were ruptured, especially the hand holding the saber, which was completely fractured. Facing a Third Realm monster, he had no power to retaliate.

"You..." In front, the elder who had dragged them into danger screamed. He was blocked by the nearly rotten 'lecturer'. Within the black mist, a terrifying scream echoed. The elder's body rapidly decayed; his flesh detached and shattered on the spot, even his bones rotted away, turning into dust in the wind. Before his death, his chilling scream resounded throughout the area. His divine consciousness was like lamp oil burned dry; his essence, qi, and spirit were all absorbed and refined by the lecturer. He suffered unimaginable pain. Qin Ming and Little Wu initially felt a sense of relief, but immediately their hairs stood on end. The lecturer was indeed even more terrifying.

Beside the two, the monster with the dry yellow hair, sensing the aura ahead, seemed extremely afraid. Finally, it slapped each of the two youths once, then turned and fled. Even though Qin Ming used the flat side of his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber to block and wrapped his head with torn cloth, he was still sent flying by the impact of the residual dark light. Moreover, his body was rupturing. He felt this monster was even more powerful than the old woman from the Cui family who had caused him to be 'shattered for peace'.

Recently, he had undergone his ninth rebirth, greatly increasing his strength, and had defeated Cao Qianqiu in the same realm, brimming with youthful vigor. However, the cruel reality soon dealt him a heavy blow. There was no 'same level' fight here; he rapidly disintegrated. If not for his cohesive force, his body would have scattered in pieces across the Gobi Desert. As for his internal organs and all his bones, they were shattered and broken, his injuries extremely severe. Little Wu also screamed, but his condition was better than Qin Ming's because the plaque hanging on him, carved with his grandmother's image, emitted a mysterious radiance, blocking the dark light.

"Brother Ming, are you okay?" Little Wu rushed over quickly. He knew his own situation; having cultivated for over ten years, he possessed his own secrets and simply couldn't die. He knew clearly that Qin Ming had been on the Path of Rebirth for less than a year, and receiving such a blow from a Third Realm master should, by rights, be fatal. However, Brother Ming didn't explode, which was unusual, hinting that there might still be hope.

"I'm fine, run!" Qin Ming, after landing, stabilized his cracking body, his face pale, and looked behind Little Wu. Little Wu turned around, instantly losing all color in his face, saying, "Senior, we aren't even enough to fill your teeth. Our blood, flesh, essence, and qi are limited; you wouldn't enjoy eating us." The lecturing elder's footsteps were silent as he gazed at the two. He looked at Qin Ming and said, "You comprehended the Desiccation Scripture in the shortest time. Very good, you may leave." Then, he looked at Little Wu, revealing a dangerous aura. "Senior, I can also comprehend it!" Little Wu immediately shouted. He stared at the plaque on Little Wu's chest, looking at it repeatedly, and finally said, "You may also leave."

At this time, the lecturer's condition was noticeably better. His flesh had a faint spirituality and vitality, no longer nearly rotten, but still seemed as if he had just crawled out of the netherworld. "Senior, what exactly is your condition? Are you human or ghost?" Qin Ming asked. The elder said, "I was originally a disciple of the Waxing and Waning Palace. I strayed from the path for longevity, stepping onto the ghost path. You two must leave quickly, or I fear I won't be able to resist devouring your flesh and blood!" He was different from ordinary malevolent ghosts; his consciousness was very clear upon his revival. The two turned and ran, not daring to ask any more questions.

Qin Ming left bloody footprints with every step, staining the sandy ground. Little Wu quickly helped him, letting him focus on healing his injuries. "Brothers, you came out really fast!" Outside, someone saw them and couldn't help but joke; they had just exchanged words not long ago. The two were in no mood to respond and immediately rushed to the city ahead, intending to find an inn to recover.

On the way, Little Wu was indignant, saying, "The rules these people summarized are useless! Encountering high-realm individuals, we instantly become their cannon fodder. That dead old man was too shameless." Qin Ming became a 'blood gourd' (covered in blood). After reaching the inn, he immediately focused all his efforts on healing. Fortunately, he had resolved the hidden dangers of the Silk Scripture Art, otherwise it would have been another 'chaos' that might have led to death. This time, he used the newly cultivated Golden Cicada Scripture for healing, which was most suitable. Because the true meaning of this scripture was to tear apart the old body, undergo tribulation for rebirth, and seek life from death, imbued with strong Zen implications. Within the Golden Cicada Scripture, there was destructive force for enemies and beneficial vital force for oneself, with endless marvelous uses.

Qin Ming recovered quickly. His flesh underwent tribulation, a cicada's chirp sounded within his body, life and death interchanged, his entire body's tendons and bones resonated and vibrated, and his five internal organs all shone brightly. After nine rebirths, his physique was incredibly strong. After one night, his problems were largely resolved. Two nights later, Qin Ming was even stronger than before. This tribulation and revival brought forth endless active power. He meditated silently, causing his Golden Cicada Force to transform again, reaching its current limit. Moreover, he cultivated the ultimate killer move recorded in this profound art – Golden Cicada Transformation. A golden cicada formed by heavenly light could, within a limited range, flap its wings and attack opponents, possessing characteristics such as life-death interchange, indestructible Zen aura, and thunderous cicada chirps.

At the same time, Qin Ming also used this Golden Cicada metamorphosis to see the end of his Path of Rebirth. These two days, as he practiced the Golden Cicada Scripture, after his torn body healed and revived, wisps of warm current appeared again in his flesh and blood – the vital energy of rebirth. He had a vague realization that his ninth rebirth was accumulating power again, and this would be the last time, because he vaguely saw the door to the Outer Saint realm. Qin Ming had originally felt regret, suspecting that his ninth rebirth was completely over. Now that he saw it clearly, he felt that with his innate talent and a foundational root deeper than even the patriarchs, reaching this point was well worth it. Only prodigies could undergo nine rebirths, and on top of that, he had accumulated power twice consecutively, achieving 'relay rebirths', going even further! He thoroughly understood his condition. He would undergo his final 'relay rebirth' soon, and at the same time, he planned to bring the Indestructible Butterfly Scripture to great accomplishment.

"Five Elemental Profound Arts plus the Dragon-Snake Scripture, Golden Cicada Scripture, and Indestructible Butterfly Scripture. I've cultivated eight profound arts during the Rebirth stage, which is pretty good." He felt there was no need to force himself to cultivate a ninth profound art. He was already complete now; everything was just right. Throughout history, patriarchs typically cultivated around six profound arts during the Rebirth stage to become Heaven-Shaking Experts and wielders of the Three Imperial Forces. Qin Ming believed his current state was sufficient. Afterward, he felt a pang of melancholy. He could no longer undergo rebirths in the future. Starting from the Outer Saint realm, it would be a completely new cultivation method, fraught with difficulties. After the Second Realm, if each major realm were subdivided, there would only be early, mid, and late stages, plus a stage of accumulation to completion awaiting breakthrough. "Only by entering the Second Realm will I be close to those Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds. I'm about to achieve it soon!" Qin Ming looked back at his journey. Achieving this within less than a year was more than enough!

Little Wu appeared, bringing him the latest news: "Brother Ming, those weren't true malevolent ghosts at all. They're all living people, originating from a certain path." Some masters had captured some of the 'malevolent ghosts', studied them carefully, and then searched through various ancient texts local to Kunling, diligently reading and investigating, clearing up many clues. The so-called malevolent ghosts, in ancient times, were a type of evil cultivator universally condemned. They devoured the blood, essence, qi, and spirit of other living beings, indeed as cruel as malevolent ghosts. Therefore, some also called them ghost cultivators, but they were definitely not spirit entities. They all possessed flesh and blood bodies, and due to the characteristics of their path, their lifespans were relatively long. Masters from other paths, in their later years, would sometimes be unable to resist actively turning to the ghost path for longevity. The ghost path was one of the most detested evil paths in ancient times, thus it aroused public anger and was ultimately suppressed by multiple parties.

"So, the previous external conjectures were inaccurate and untrustworthy? Those nearly decaying malevolent ghosts, when they devoured people from the outside, weren't trying to find scapegoats or replace them, but merely to restore themselves?" Little Wu nodded, saying, "That's right. According to records, their ancestral ground was sealed in the netherworld, buried somewhere beneath Kunling. Now they have broken out of the seal." The reason these ghost path practitioners weren't rushing out now was that their own condition was extremely poor, and they couldn't leave the nourishment of the netherworld soil yet. The netherworld soil was bone-chillingly cold, allowing those malevolent ghosts to slumber. Having been sealed for so long, they had not died out completely, and now they had re-emerged into the Night Mist World.

Moreover, this time, the major dao lineages, in order to investigate the past, had thoroughly examined dozens of miscellaneous books, including the Kunling Quasi-Divine Records and the Land Approaching Immortality, uncovering some truths. The Kunling region had at least nine forbidden lands, and the netherworld soil where the ghost path practitioners resided was one of them. Little Wu explained, "In fact, there are even more forbidden lands than the nine we thought. In the earliest times, they were actually a single entity, but as the primordial Kunling shattered, each fragment became a forbidden land." These were all recent research findings from the great sects. Furthermore, they believed that those patriarchs should not be dead. It was just that during the great war, for some unknown reason, certain seals were accidentally opened, and they were temporarily trapped themselves. The current situation was extremely dire. Everyone believed that they must contact the vanished patriarchs and quickly seal this region. If more forbidden lands appeared, the consequences would be unimaginable.

"In the past, quasi-divine beings and near-immortal creatures once opened all the sealed lands, wanting to approach the legendary Jade Capital. But facing that city, something happened to them. They hastily sealed Kunling and then fled far away." Upon hearing this, Qin Ming completely understood the contents of the Kunling Quasi-Divine Records. Those past events actually held such hidden details. Immediately, he felt a chill, inhaling a mouthful of the night mist, because the mistakes inadvertently made by the patriarchs at the current stage were equivalent to repeating the old path of the quasi-divine and near-immortal beings! This time, if the Jade Capital reappeared, who knew what would happen? After all, even the legendary beings of that time had fled. Qin Ming believed that even with the cultivation of the Path-Opening Patriarchs, it would be difficult to seal the Kunling region a second time.
