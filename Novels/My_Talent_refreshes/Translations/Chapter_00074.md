# Chapter 74: Twenty Acres of Spirit Fields (Please Subscribe!)

Chu Ning and his companion traveled by wind-walking, making decent progress. The journey of over ten li took them only half a ke (approximately 7.5 minutes). The twenty acres of spirit fields were nestled between two small valleys, relatively isolated.

At first glance, Chu Ning was thoroughly pleased. This secluded location suited him perfectly—while tending the fields daily, he could also cultivate using the Verdant Spring Technique. His only concern was security.

Turning to Du Han, Chu Ning asked, "Senior Brother Du, these fields are over ten li from the market. Are the surroundings safe?"

Seeing Chu Ning's cautious demeanor, Du Han frowned slightly but answered nonetheless. "Rest assured, the surrounding valleys are also spirit fields owned by the Sun and other cultivation families affiliated with our Qingxi Sect. They have patrols making rounds daily."

Chu Ning nodded and pressed further, "So, I don’t have to worry about anyone stealing my spirit plants at night?"

Du Han’s frown deepened. "As I said, there are patrols. Besides, everyone in the Yanji Market area knows these fields belong to Qingxi Sect. No rogue cultivator would dare target us." He glanced at Chu Ning. "Moreover, doesn’t your Spirit Plant Hall have protective formations here?"

Chu Ning nodded slightly. The fields indeed had simple formations, similar to those in the sect—basic deterrents that could be breached with a single talisman, effective only against low-level cultivators or mortals. Hence his thorough questioning.

As Chu Ning retrieved the formation token to enter the fields, Du Han spoke up, "I’ll head back if you’re staying."

"Aren’t you going to inspect them?" Chu Ning paused.

Du Han waved dismissively. "Cultivation methods are your Hundred Arts Hall’s concern. Stay if you wish, or return with me now."

After a moment’s thought, Chu Ning replied, "You go ahead. I’ll decide what to plant first."

Without another word, Du Han turned and left. Watching him disappear, Chu Ning sighed softly. He missed the camaraderie with Zhuang Yunde and He Changyou back in the sect—colleagues from the same hall shared a bond, however slight.

Shaking off the nostalgia, Chu Ning reminded himself that even within the Spirit Plant Hall, there were figures like Cao Dongxin and Qi Chongmao. Everywhere had its politics.

Entering the fields, Chu Ning carefully assessed their quality. Though he hadn’t seen the sect’s Class B fields, these were undoubtedly richer in spiritual energy than the Class C plots he’d previously tended. Now, what to plant across twenty acres?

First priority: spirit bamboo for talisman paper. Given the field quality, he could upgrade from Ink Spirit Bamboo to Purple Crystal Bamboo—a superior material yielding 50-70% more pulp with fewer impurities. Though harder to cultivate, it posed no challenge for Chu Ning.

"Ten acres for Purple Crystal Bamboo to meet my talisman needs," he decided. He’d brought seeds for both varieties, and the fields’ quality justified the premium crop.

As for the remaining ten acres, Chu Ning hesitated. Most Spirit Plant Hall disciples grew Revitalization Grass for alchemy, but he needed to confirm whether Gu Xiaoqing still required it for her pills. "I’ll consult Senior Sister Gu. If she needs Revitalization Grass, I’ll plant that. Otherwise, I’ll choose something else."

With the bamboo plot settled, Chu Ning immediately set to work. Purple Crystal Bamboo took months to mature even with the Verdant Spring Technique, so time was of the essence. Though its seeds were trickier to germinate than Ink Spirit Bamboo’s, they were easier than Blood Sandalwood’s—another option he’d considered but dismissed due to slow growth and poor energy absorption efficiency for cultivation.

Using telekinesis, Chu Ning evenly sowed the seeds before activating germination spells. Soon, tiny purple shoots emerged. Within an hour, three acres were planted—far quicker than his previous efforts with Ink Spirit Bamboo.

By noon, Chu Ning paused for lunch. Diligence was vital, but so was sustenance; Qi Refining cultivators couldn’t yet abstain from food.

Returning wind-borne to the market, he noted neighboring fields presumably belonging to the Sun family. Back at his shop, before he could unlock the door, two creaks sounded—Luo Yiping and Lu Miaoying from the Spirit Beast Hall next door, and Gu Xiaoqing across the street emerged simultaneously, all clearly waiting for him.

After exchanged glances, Luo Yiping—the most impatient—spoke first. "Chu Ning! We’ve been waiting."

Suppressing irritation at the familiar address, Chu Ning asked neutrally, "Senior Brother Luo, what brings you here?"

"Let’s talk inside," Luo Yiping said, prompting Chu Ning to unlock the shop. The group filed in, soon joined by a curious Shen Zhengquan, completing the unexpected gathering.

Silent, Chu Ning waited. Whatever their purpose, they’d reveal it soon enough.

Sure enough, Luo Yiping began, "Chu Ning, we need to discuss something."
