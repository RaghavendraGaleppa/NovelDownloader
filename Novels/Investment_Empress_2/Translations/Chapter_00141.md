Chapter 141: Zhou Tian Xing Dou Xuan Dan Jing, The Ice Cube’s Soup

The morning birdsong pierced through the window paper of the side chamber, waking Li Mo to the sound of a system notification.

Bathed in the morning light, he blinked, recognizing the familiar ceiling. He let out a long yawn. "It's been a long time since I slept so soundly."

He had never pushed his potential to such a limit before. His internal energy had been completely drained, leaving not a single drop. The mental toll had been immense, causing him to pass out directly.

Li Mo checked his Dantian and found that a small amount of internal energy had actually recovered. Did he practice in his sleep?

Unable to figure it out, he turned his attention to the culprit behind his interrupted dream.

**[Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'Qian Bufan,' saving him from an ambush by the Demon Summoning Sect.]**

**[Investment Feedback: Eight Treasures Devouring Gold Art]**

**[Eight Treasures Devouring Gold Art]:** "Rooted in the Qi of treasure, it belongs to the Metal element and possesses extremely strong offensive power. However, the cost is immense. Those without substantial wealth should practice with caution."

"The Elder Qian's martial art?"

Li Mo had thought earlier how nice it would be to get his hands on Qian Bufan's martial art. He didn't expect the system to drop one right after.

However, he already had a main cultivation art, and he wasn't sure if he could practice this one.

The feedback wasn't limited to Qian Bufan.

**[Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'He Chen,' saving him from an ambush by the Demon Summoning Sect.]**

**[Investment Feedback: Startling Cloud Sword Manual]**

**[Startling Cloud Sword Manual]:** "A sword technique passed down through the Hengyun Sword City lineage. It was领悟ed by the Bai family ancestor after observing the sword clouds. It cannot be learned by anyone other than direct disciples."

**[Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'Zhou Tu,' saving him from perishing in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.]**

**[Investment Feedback: Red Ganoderma Wine.]**

**[Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'Yao Feng,' saving him from perishing in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.]**

**[Investment Feedback: Eight years of martial arts insight.]**

...

A long list of investment feedback left Li Mo's head spinning.

There were quite a few valuable items among them. There were a total of thirty martial arts, the lowest of which were high-grade, and there was no shortage of supreme techniques.

Unfortunately, the supreme techniques were only of the lower grade; not a single mid-grade one was among them.

There were three Ancient Bronze Heavenly Book Seals and one Ancient Bronze Creation Seal.

The Creation Seal seemed much rarer than the Heavenly Book Seal. The former is used to deduce Divine Manifestation Diagrams, while the latter deduces martial arts. It was unclear if this was due to probability or if Divine Manifestation Diagrams were simply more precious than martial arts of the same level.

"Divine Manifestation Diagrams are extremely rare in the Scripture Pavilion. It's probably the latter."

He pushed the martial arts-related feedback to the side. The system space was currently a mess.

The little "Master Li" happily began to categorize his assets.

Two million taels of red gold, three hundred thousand taels of gold, silver... the amount of silver was unclear, but a full box of silver bills could be cashed out for several million.

Forty-plus pieces of玄晶 (Mysterious Crystals).

This item needs no explanation; it's even more valuable than red gold.

"Just the Eight Treasures Devouring Gold Art? If I wanted to practice it, wouldn't that be a piece of cake?"

Li Mo decided to change his self-introduction in the future. From "of modest means" to "of some assets."

Other treasures, such as minerals, jewels, herbs, fine wines, and precious teas, had also increased in variety. The system space had become one-third fuller.

It was all the harvest from this Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

"Good heavens."

"This secret realm visit was worth it."

Based on the feedback, Li Mo had essentially saved the majority of people in the secret realm. He saved some by acting chivalrously on the first floor, and later, he shattered the secret realm, which also seemed to count as his investment.

It meant that if he hadn't been there this time, a major incident might have occurred in the secret realm. The Demon Summoning Sect had no intention of letting any of the trial participants leave.

"I was only trying to invest in the Ice Cube..."

Li Mo sighed a couple of times.

Speaking of which, he suddenly remembered that he hadn't had a chance to look closely at the feedback from the Ice Cube.

His consciousness sank into the system space again.

A golden page and a golden seal.

This was the feedback from the Ice Cube.

**[Gilded Heavenly Book Seal]:** "When stamped onto a Divine Manifestation Diagram, it can cause it to deduce, perfect, and raise its grade. It can be used on Extreme Form Divine Manifestation Diagrams at most."

Li Mo had read *Chronicles of Divine Forms*. Coincidentally, that book was written by Han Zhen.

---

The fact that it could be used on Extreme Forms meant that the Gilded Creation Seal could upgrade a Divine Manifestation Diagram from Extreme Form to a Great Dao Divine Form.

He currently possessed several Divine Manifestation Diagrams: the Night Ghost Statue, the Flesh-and-Blood Buddha, and the Golden Crow Turning into the Sun.

The first two weren't very useful. Whether they made one powerful or not, they weren't exactly righteous paths. Once practiced, one would likely become a pariah of the Jianghu.

The Golden Crow Turning into the Sun Diagram—he once thought it was a Great Dao Divine Form, but later discovered it was merely an Extreme Form.

"I don't have a deep understanding of the Divine Manifestation Realm yet. I'm not in a rush to use the Gilded Creation Seal."

"This thing can only be dropped by the Ice Cube for now."

Li Mo suppressed the urge to obtain a Great Dao Divine Form right now.

**[Zhou Tian Xing Dou Xuan Dan Jing (Mysterious Pill Scripture of the Zhou Tian Stars)]:** "A supreme technique. It records the great secrets of the Zhou Tian stars. One can transform pills into stars within their own inner world. Only when the number of stars reaches the Zhou Tian count will it be complete. At that time, one can use the mysterious pills to evolve the myriad phenomena of all realms!"

Li Mo: "Huh?"

He was stunned.

The Zhou Tian stars number three hundred and sixty-five.

Doesn't that mean he has to condense three hundred and sixty-five mysterious pills?

Master Li thought his eyes were playing tricks on him, but they weren't. There were no words on the golden page; the information of this martial art went straight to his soul.

He could be certain that this *Zhou Tian Xing Dou Xuan Dan Jing* could no longer be评定ed as a Divine Art. Or rather... it had long since departed the realm of martial arts.

"But... can my Dantian hold that many?"

Li Mo still couldn't imagine it.

"Wait..."

"These mysterious pills aren't in the Dantian, but in an inner world."

Li Mo realized this.

This simply wasn't something for the Internal Energy Realm to practice.

A self-contained world within the body is the standard characteristic of the Sixth Realm, the Law Body Realm.

It would be barely understandable for a Law Body Realm expert to possess three hundred and sixty-five mysterious pills.

But...

"I don't have an inner world."

"Would a small world... work?"

An idea flashed through Li Mo's mind.

He silently sensed his current state. After the extreme depletion, every cell was crying out for nourishment. His meridians were dried up and knotted, requiring slow recuperation.

After recovering his vitality, there was a high chance he would make further progress.

"That's probably when the opportunity to break through to the Mysterious Pill Realm will come."

Li Mo took a deep breath.

He prepared to get out of bed but felt he had no strength.

The mighty Hammer King of the Northwest almost stumbled and fell to the floor.

I say "almost" because he fell into a cold, jade-like fragrance.

Hmm... onto Ying Bing's shoulder.

"You're awake."

A voice like falling jade sounded by his ear.

Li Mo looked up and met the Ice Cube's downward-gazing eyes.

She had changed into a home-style dress and was holding a bowl of medicinal soup.

Little Master Li was usually eloquent, but now he was at a loss for words. He stood up straight after a long while and nodded. "Thanks."

"I should be thanking you."

Ying Bing sat at the antique-style red sandalwood table, placing the items on the tray down properly. She then lightly patted the stool beside her. "Come here, sit."

"What's this?"

Li Mo looked at the items on the table and felt that something was wrong.

"Medicine."

Ying Bing stirred the soup with a spoon, then tapped the edge of the porcelain bowl. "Drink it."

"I'll help you regulate your meridians afterward."

Li Mo: "!"

He looked at the girl's clear eyes, then at the bowl of soup on the table.

The Master Li who had once fought valiantly against two opponents and wielded his divine weapon against the Inner Scene shivered.

Folks, what's the way to break the "Big Brother drinks the medicine" situation?

Waiting online, it's urgent.
