# Chapter 181: Preparations

Li Shiming's consciousness entered the machine room space, where he opened the five storage pouches he had acquired that day. The spiritual artifacts belonging to Yi Lingling had already had their spiritual imprints erased by Li Yuanba's sword intent during the battle.

Yi Lingling's storage pouch contained no more spiritual artifacts—just a pile of miscellaneous items, mostly women's personal belongings, some spirit stones and pills, and only one Northern Shu Merchant Guild jade token with 350,000 low-grade spirit stones recorded on it.

He remained wary of the pills. He estimated that he was among the few Three Spiritual Roots cultivators who had never consumed pills since beginning their cultivation.

During the Qi Refinement stage, his cultivation speed had been relatively ideal—far surpassing that of his peers—so he never felt the need for pills to aid his progress. Later, he discovered an even better cultivation method: Li Yuanba, with his Heavenly Spiritual Root, cultivated on his behalf. He hadn’t even needed a Foundation Establishment Pill when breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage.

But after reaching Foundation Establishment, he clearly felt the slowdown in his cultivation speed, which made him extremely uncomfortable. Even so, he still had no intention of consuming pills—at least not until he joined a sect and gained access to relevant knowledge about them. Only a sect could provide high-quality pills; low-grade ones had too strong a resistance effect.

Among the remaining four storage pouches, only the one belonging to the old mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator contained a relatively substantial amount of resources. Unfortunately, none of it caught Li Shiming's interest. Although the resources of Skysea Island couldn't compare to those of Northern Shu, and the combined wealth of its seven sects was only on par with a mid-sized sect in Northern Shu, after all, they had controlled Skysea Island for ten thousand years. Their resources far surpassed those of ordinary forces in Northern Shu.

The spiritual artifacts Li Shiming had obtained on Skysea Island were either top-tier rewards from the seven sects or looted from the genius disciples of the Mingxin Sect. The old mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator had only a little over ten thousand spirit stones and a few relatively ordinary spiritual artifacts. The other storage pouches contained even fewer spirit stones—just a few thousand each.

In comparison, Yi Lingling's wealth was astonishing. Considering she had been able to bid for a spiritual artifact like the "Earth Tone Annihilation Zither" at an auction, it was clear she had substantial capital.

Finally, he examined Yi Yi's items. The talismanic treasure was undoubtedly the greatest find. It depicted a longsword, but unfortunately, it only had two uses remaining. It was evident that Yi Yi had been far from a peaceful individual.

Li Shiming now possessed three talismanic treasures but had yet to use any of them. This was largely due to his wide array of techniques—he rarely found himself in situations where he needed to resort to a talismanic treasure. Moreover, in moments of danger, the activation time for talismanic treasures was too long.

Even with only two uses left, the value of this talismanic treasure was incalculable.

He opened the storage bracelet. Unsurprisingly, its internal space was identical to the two storage bracelets he already owned. Li Shiming began to suspect that these bracelets were mass-produced by some faction specifically for the descendants of Golden Core cultivators. Otherwise, how could he have obtained three nearly identical bracelets from killing three Golden Core descendants?

The bracelet contained a vast number of items. There were eleven longsword spiritual artifacts alone, all uniformly extravagant in design, adorned with various colors and gemstones that made them appear extraordinary. Next were the spiritual artifact robes—eight in total—and to Li Shiming's surprise, their colors matched those of the longswords. It seemed Yi Yi had commissioned them to coordinate aesthetically. Despite having seen many storage spaces, Li Shiming was still taken aback by Yi Yi's taste. It was as if, while most people were concerned with mere survival, Yi Yi was preoccupied with refinement.

In the cultivation world, spiritual artifacts were far from common. Most rogue Foundation Establishment cultivators possessed very few. Even among the Foundation Establishment cultivators accompanying Yi Yi, only the old mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator had a relatively abundant collection—the other three had only one offensive and one defensive artifact each.

Beyond the longswords and robes, there were three defensive spiritual artifacts: a shield, a bell, and a pearl. Each was imbued with potent spirituality, undoubtedly top-tier defensive treasures. Li Shiming sighed regretfully—if not for the risk of being recognized by the Baozeshan faction, he could have put these artifacts to good use.

There was also a massive spiritual furnace, which he quickly determined was not an alchemy cauldron, given its completely different design. He skipped over it for now and turned his attention to the jade slips. There was only one—a purple one.

With slight disappointment, he probed the purple jade slip with his spiritual sense: *Baozeshan Refining Record*. It was a forging technique, explaining the purpose of the spiritual furnace—it was a forging furnace, a tool for artificers. The pile of unfamiliar materials beside it also made sense now; the *Baozeshan Refining Record* detailed their names and properties.

The *Baozeshan Refining Record* was the forging heritage of the Baozeshan faction, and Yi Yi had likely been training to become—or already was—an artificer.

"What an unexpected delight!" Obtaining the *Baozeshan Refining Record* delighted Li Shiming more than acquiring a powerful cultivation technique.

The science of his previous life required the knowledge of this world's cultivation to be truly effective. He had previously studied formations, which had indeed provided solutions for many scientific problems. But many of his ideas were related to artifact forging, especially weapons, which required artifacts suited to his current cultivation level.

Take the mid-grade Gatling artifact, for example. When he had crafted it during the Qi Refinement stage, it had significantly boosted his combat power. Even peak Qi Refinement geniuses had struggled to withstand its barrage. But after reaching Foundation Establishment, its power no longer matched his level—his enemies were now at least Foundation Establishment cultivators. Even the high-grade Railgun artifact would see a substantial increase in power if upgraded to a spiritual artifact.

Many of his past research projects had been limited by material constraints. This world, however, had innate advantages in materials—spiritual materials were naturally superior to the best synthetic materials of his previous life. But the forging methods of his past life couldn't process spiritual materials. In this world, only artificers could work with them.

Li Shiming glanced at the spiritual furnace. He decided to hold off on refining it for now. If he could obtain another furnace elsewhere, he wouldn't need this one. Besides, he hadn't yet settled down, and becoming an artificer required a suitable environment.

"Fellow Daoist, while sword cultivators don't need many artifacts, as we saw in this battle, facing multiple enemies alone can be troublesome," Li Shiming said to Li Yuanba after withdrawing his consciousness from the machine room.

"Your point is valid. I did struggle against multiple opponents," Li Yuanba agreed.

This kind of dialogue between Li Shiming's two consciousnesses kept him from feeling lonely. Even if they were separated by thousands of miles in the future, this connection would likely continue.

A day later, Li Shiming entered a large market. This time, he was fortunate enough to avoid trouble. His status as a Foundation Establishment cultivator proved useful—when he entered a shop exuding a chilling aura, he was immediately escorted to the second floor. Typically, only the second floor catered to Foundation Establishment cultivators, as their spending power and status far exceeded that of Qi Refinement cultivators.

This shop specialized in demonic cultivation materials. Even Li Shiming found the first floor difficult to endure—corpses of cultivators were openly sold, along with dismembered body parts used as materials for refining corpse puppets. The other bizarre materials, typical of demonic sects, emitted peculiar odors and had grotesque appearances. The air was thick with these mingling scents, something only demonic cultivators could tolerate—perhaps even enjoy.

The second floor was much better. No materials were displayed; customers simply made requests to the attendant.

The attendant serving Li Shiming and Li Yuanba was a gaunt old cultivator, whose aura revealed him to be at the early Foundation Establishment stage. To avoid trouble, Li Yuanba wore a mask—a magical artifact that blocked spiritual sense scans. His face was a weapon, but it could also attract unwanted attention. Li Shiming wore a wide-brimmed hat that similarly blocked spiritual sense. Such disguises were common in markets.

"How may I assist you, Fellow Daoist?" the old cultivator asked with a smile that resembled a skeleton's grin.

There was no tea service on the second floor—not that many would dare drink tea in a demonic shop anyway.

"Do you have these materials?" Li Shiming tossed over a jade slip.

The old cultivator placed it against his forehead and quickly understood their needs. "Our shop has a comprehensive selection of corpse refinement materials. However, the second-grade main material you requested won't come cheap," he said, his wrinkles bunching up as he grinned.

His meaning was clear: they had the materials, but did Li Shiming have the spirit stones?

"Don't worry, the spirit stones are ready. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here," Li Shiming replied coolly.

"Our shop accepts Northern Shu Merchant Guild storage jade tokens," the old cultivator added with a resigned shrug. "It's their rule—we have to say it, or we can't process transactions through their channels."

Li Shiming chuckled. Despite his frightening appearance, the old man was quite honest. It seemed the saying "the face reflects the heart" wasn't always true.

He took out one of his anonymous Northern Shu Merchant Guild tokens, which held over 200,000 spirit stones, and placed it on the table.

"Would you like a high-quality furnace? We have Dual Spiritual Roots furnaces in stock. If you're willing to place an order, we can even procure a Heavenly Spiritual Roots furnace," the old cultivator said after handing the jade slip to a servant.

"No need. I already have a corpse," Li Shiming replied bluntly.

In demonic sects, though their actions were unrestrained, many aspects followed strict rules. For example, corpses used for refining corpse puppets were euphemistically called "furnaces." Li Shiming had no such considerations—all the corpses in his possession were enemies he had slain personally.

The old cultivator's eyes gleamed with insight. From Li Shiming's reply, he deduced that the corpse in question must be of exceptional quality—likely a Heavenly Spiritual Roots Foundation Establishment cultivator. Otherwise, why use second-grade main materials? First-grade materials were sufficient for refining Foundation Establishment corpses. Only if the corpse was extraordinarily valuable, meant to maximize its latent potential, would one resort to second-grade materials.

"We also purchase corpses. Foundation Establishment corpses are priced according to quality," the old cultivator added.

Li Shiming didn't respond. He had collected many corpses but hadn't disposed of them, as they might serve as repair materials for corpse puppets in the future. Selling corpses for spirit stones wasn't his style—they fetched too little and invited too much trouble.

Soon, the servant returned with a storage pouch. The old cultivator inspected it before handing it to Li Shiming.

Li Shiming scanned the pouch with his spiritual sense, meticulously checking every material, especially the second-grade ones. He couldn't afford carelessness—failure in corpse refinement would be a significant loss.

"Fellow Daoist, the total is 15,000 spirit stones," the old cultivator reminded him with a smile.

Li Shiming handed over the Northern Shu Merchant Guild token, curious about how the transaction would proceed.

The old cultivator produced a formation disk, activating it with a tap. Though Li Shiming didn't probe it with his spiritual sense, his advanced formation mastery allowed him to sense that the disk was connecting to an external formation. It seemed the Northern Shu Merchant Guild had established a communication network across Northern Shu, at least covering major markets.

After operating the disk, the old cultivator returned the token to Li Shiming, now depleted of 15,000 spirit stones.

Li Shiming refrained from asking questions. The old man's sharp wit would likely suspect his origins if he showed too much curiosity.

He didn't spend any more spirit stones. Though 15,000 wasn't an exorbitant sum, many Foundation Establishment cultivators had limited wealth. Further spending might draw unwanted attention.

After leaving the market, he carefully checked for tails, even deploying drones with thermal imaging to confirm no one was following him. Only then did he relax.

His caution wasn't unwarranted. In his short time in the cultivation world, he had already encountered countless troubles and slain numerous cultivators!
