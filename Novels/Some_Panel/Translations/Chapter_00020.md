Chapter 20: Level Six Qi Condensation

Bidding farewell to Huoyuan, Yang Ji left the cave. In a wooden house south of the city, at the foot of Green Mountain, Yang Ji sat cross-legged. He appeared not to be cultivating, but in truth, the spiritual energy vortex in his dantian was constantly spinning. A circulative force was generated within his meridians, automatically absorbing the free-floating spiritual energy in the air and refining it into pure spiritual power. Although exceptionally slow, his cultivation was indeed increasing every moment. This was the marvel of cultivation techniques: with just a slight mental guidance, the internal vortex could automatically absorb and refine spiritual energy. However, this method was not as fast as focused cultivation.

Yang Ji inwardly observed the limited spiritual energy in his dantian. With a sweep of his storage bag, he produced a Spirit Blossom Pill and consumed it. A wave of medicinal power immediately dispersed within his body. His cultivation technique began to circulate, refining and absorbing the spiritual energy from the Spirit Blossom Pill, thread by thread. The spiritual energy from a high-grade Spirit Blossom Pill was quite pure; the amount processed in one go, even with his low-grade root bone, was more than five times that of absorbing the chaotic spiritual energy freely floating in the world. The vortex instantly refined a wisp of spiritual energy, converging it into the spiritual sea in his dantian.

Gazing at his spiritual sea, which was merely a small puddle, Yang Ji was instantly filled with hope. Although cultivation became harder to break through in the later stages, if he had ample pills to continuously supply pure spiritual energy, the small puddle would slowly fill up. His cultivation would break through layer by layer until the small puddle completely transformed into a vast spiritual sea, at which point he would reach the peak of Level Ten Qi Condensation. However, limited by the cultivation speed of his low-grade root bone, this process could potentially take a long time – ten, twenty, or even thirty years – it was unknown. But now, with a sufficient supply of pills, he believed this process would be significantly shortened.

Yang Ji sat cross-legged in the small house, fully dedicated to refining the pills. Two days passed swiftly.

[Name: Yang Ji]
[Root Bone: Low-Grade]
[Lifespan: 18/100]
[Realm: Level Five Qi Condensation (15/1600)]
[Cultivation Technique: Ling Shui Art]
[Spells: Water Tracing Sword Art (Mastered), Light Body Technique (Mastered)]

After two days of cultivation, Yang Ji discovered that one Spirit Blossom Pill could sustain his cultivation for two days. He briefly sensed that he could gain approximately 5 cultivation points per day. Currently, he possessed one hundred ninety Spirit Blossom Pills. Theoretically, after refining and absorbing all of them, they could provide him with 1900 cultivation points. This meant that in just one year, he could successfully break through to Level Six Qi Condensation. Yang Ji's heart swelled with joy; this cultivation speed was far superior to merely absorbing spiritual energy from the heavens and earth.

He resolved to cultivate with all his might, vowing not to leave the house until he had refined all the pills in his possession. Cultivation knew no time. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months. Spring faded into autumn, winter gave way to spring. A year passed in a flash. On this day, in the small house at the foot of Green Mountain, Yang Ji circulated the last wisp of medicinal spiritual energy within his body. The spiritual energy performed a Grand Cycle within his meridians, drawn into the spiritual energy vortex by the circulative force, then quickly refined into pure spiritual power and merged into his spiritual sea. His spiritual sea was now noticeably more than twice as vast as before. As this final wisp of spiritual energy merged, the spiritual sea vibrated slightly, and a faint spiritual pressure emanated from his body. Yang Ji's robes immediately billowed and spread out, fluttering in the breeze. As the spiritual pressure dissipated, even the surrounding air rippled with tiny, visible waves. With spiritual pressure naturally generated within him, Yang Ji was no longer the minor cultivator of Level Five Qi Condensation; he had now reached Level Six. The nearly doubled spiritual power significantly enhanced his strength compared to when he was at Level Five.

[Realm: Level Six Qi Condensation (300/3200)]

"In just one year, my cultivation has advanced by a whole level. The difference in cultivation speed with and without pills is simply immense. As expected, consuming pills is the true path," Yang Ji mused, feeling the abundant spiritual energy within him. A look of joy spread across his face, slowly followed by a hint of confidence. "With my pill refining technique, refining mid-grade and high-grade spiritual pills should be no problem. The cultivation speed with those pills ought to be even faster."

Yang Ji smiled faintly, then rose and walked towards the Myriad Treasures Pavilion. He planned to purchase some high-grade spirit herbs to refine mid-grade spiritual pills, which would further accelerate his cultivation. In the main hall of the Myriad Treasures Pavilion, at the innermost counter, Jin Dafu saw Yang Ji approaching with a smile and quickly gestured for him to sit down.

"Brother Yang has arrived! Please, have a seat, have a seat!" Jin Dafu poured spiritual tea and arranged spiritual fruits, offering a warm welcome. Yang Ji, not one to stand on ceremony, took a seat.

"Haha, Brother Yang. I haven't seen you in a year, and your complexion has improved significantly. Have you been exploring the sea again? I presume you've acquired quite a few resources," Jin Dafu said with a beaming smile. "Pill refining can't stop, you know. It requires a lot of practice. So, how many sets of spirit herbs are you looking for this time?"

"Indeed, I want to buy some spirit herbs." Yang Ji took a sip of spiritual tea and smiled faintly. "Elder Jin, please get me a few sets of spirit herbs for refining mid-grade spiritual pills."

"Spirit herbs for refining mid-grade spiritual pills?" Jin Dafu raised an eyebrow and kindly advised, "Brother, pill refining is not something to rush. You need to take it one step at a time. I believe your current goal should be to become a junior alchemist first. Mid-grade spiritual pills—those are only refined by alchemy masters."

"I know that, Elder Jin. Just provide the spirit herbs. Are you saying you won't earn spirit stones?" Yang Ji raised an eyebrow and chuckled.

Jin Dafu eyed him suspiciously, then suddenly shook his head. "None."

"None?" Yang Ji was startled.

"Truly none!" Jin Dafu stated. "Our Myriad Treasures Pavilion only sells spirit herbs for refining low-grade spiritual pills. We don't have any for mid-grade or high-grade spiritual pills."

"Why?" Yang Ji asked, puzzled.

"It's not just our Myriad Treasures Pavilion; no other shops on Nanfeng Island have spirit herbs for refining mid-grade or high-grade spiritual pills either," Jin Dafu added.

"Why is that?" Yang Ji wondered, surprised.

"Spirit herbs for refining mid-grade spiritual pills are all over a hundred years old. Ancient spirit herbs are quite precious and hard to find. After countless cultivators have searched for so many years, there are probably only a few left," Jin Dafu slowly explained.

"Has the conflict between cultivators' resource acquisition and resource regeneration become this severe?" Yang Ji frowned slightly.

Noticing Yang Ji's slightly disappointed expression, Jin Dafu took a sip of spiritual tea and smiled again. "Although ancient spirit herbs are scarce, they can still be found if one looks hard enough."

"Oh?" Yang Ji's eyes lit up when he saw the "[Playing hard to get]" indicator above Jin Dafu's head. "Elder Jin, with your vast connections, you must have a way. Could you help me find some?"

"I can, but what exactly do you need those spirit herbs for?" Jin Dafu asked, still perplexed.

"To refine pills," Yang Ji replied with a smile.

"Refine pills?" Jin Dafu was taken aback, shaking his head with a thought of "[This kid is acting strange.]" He immediately tried to dissuade him, "Brother, pill refining isn't something that happens overnight. It's best not to get stuck in a dead end."

Yang Ji smiled faintly, then released his spiritual pressure. "Elder Jin, sense my cultivation."

"Isn't this Level Six Qi Condensation?" Jin Dafu casually said, then suddenly froze. "Wait, you've reached Level Six Qi Condensation? I remember a year ago you were still at Level Five. With your low-grade root bone talent, it's impossible to cultivate that fast!" He seemed to have realized something, and his expression became troubled. "Ah, Brother, did you buy pills from other shops? Are you no longer looking after your elder brother's business?"

"Of course, I'll look after your business, and it'll be a big one. It's time we discussed helping you clear out your spirit herb inventory and splitting the pills fifty-fifty," Yang Ji said with a laugh.
