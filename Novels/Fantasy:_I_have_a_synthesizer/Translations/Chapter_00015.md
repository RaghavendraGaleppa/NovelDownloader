# Chapter 15: Talent Test, Only Blue Talent?

This person was named Bai Zhan, an instructor from the Jiangnan Province's Prodigy Camp. There weren't many instructors in the Prodigy Camp, only five. However, each of these five was a Golden Body Realm martial artist. Furthermore, there were even Flying Sky Realm powerhouses presiding over the Prodigy Camp. One must know that a Flying Sky Realm powerhouse was considered a strong individual even when looking at the entire Jiangnan Province. This clearly showed how much the Jiangnan Province Martial Artists Association valued the Prodigy Camp.

Bai Zhan sat on the sofa, crossing one leg over the other, and said indifferently, "Give me that kid's information. I don't want to waste too much time."

Upon hearing this, Liu Kuang quickly handed Su Yu's dossier to Bai Zhan. Bai Zhan slowly flipped through the pages. "Just entered the Qi-Blood Realm? Broke through 3 points of qi-blood in a few days?" He paused. "An orphan? Insufficient clearance for background information?" Bai Zhan's pupils constricted slightly as he looked at Liu Kuang. "What's going on? Even you, the Vice President of the Hengcheng Martial Artists Association, don't have enough clearance?"

Bai Zhan's words were spoken lightly, but to Liu Kuang's ears, they were filled with overbearing authority. Liu Kuang let out a bitter smile and remained silent. Bai Zhan stretched lazily and said indifferently, "Alright, call that kid over. This talent is enough to warrant a test from me."

"But it's already evening..." Liu Kuang felt a bit troubled, but then he heard Bai Zhan's cold chuckle. "What, do you think I have a lot of time? There are so many prodigies in the Prodigy Camp waiting for me to instruct them. If not for your guarantee as Vice President, do you think I would come?" His voice hardened. "Let me tell you, even the weakest prodigies in my Prodigy Camp possess 5 points of qi-blood. Which one of them isn't a monstrous talent under eighteen?"

Facing Bai Zhan's merciless mockery, Liu Kuang felt incredibly aggrieved but could only endure it. He pulled out his phone and sent a message to Su Yu.

At this moment, Su Yu, who had just finished adjusting his state, slowly opened his eyes. "Finally stabilized. My current strength should exceed nine thousand kilograms, right?" Just as Su Yu was about to rest, he heard his phone vibrate repeatedly. Picking up his phone, Su Yu glanced at it, a little surprised. "That big shot is here? So fast?"

Bai Zhan's cold voice rang out. "No need to ponder. This is a storage ring, comparable to a Level 1 spirit tool. Do you want it?"

Su Yu hesitated for a moment, then nodded cautiously. A slight curve appeared at the corner of Bai Zhan's mouth. "Alright, if you can achieve the Viscera Tempering Realm before you turn twenty, I'll give you one!" Anyone could tell that these words were meant to taunt Su Yu. However, Su Yu took it seriously. His eyes lit up, and he quickly said, "Is that true?" Su Yu was indeed quite interested in this so-called storage ring. Now it was Bai Zhan's turn to be dumbfounded. *Good heavens, give them an inch and they'll take a mile, won't they?*
