# Chapter 123: The Center of All Eyes

When Li Qingyue was in combat, she exuded an incredibly formidable oppressive aura. Now, after ceasing her movements, she reverted to her elegant and refined demeanor. Her black hair cascaded like a waterfall, her eyes were bright, and her teeth like jade. A faint smile, like a blossoming immortal flower, radiated brilliant light, instantly making people feel gentle and approachable.

She had elite disciples step forward to help treat the wounded. Some core disciples had suffered severe damage to their spiritual light of consciousness, with half their bodies already stained red with blood. This was mainly because Jiang Shengyu, Su Jingzhu, and Hu Tingwen had fought to the death, gazing at the nearby Eight Trigrams Furnace. They unleashed their strongest killer moves, hoping to make one last desperate attempt, but were met with a forceful counterattack, even having their bodies pierced through.

Qin Ming watched Li Qingyue from afar, wondering when they would meet again. Seeing her surrounded by elite disciples, busy and unable to break free, Qin Ming turned and walked in another direction.

"Everyone, we're all on the same path, we're all our own people. Especially now that the contest for the near-immortal item has concluded, there's no need for us to fight anymore," Qin Ming said, smiling and greeting some of the outer saints.

A group of people instantly tensed, becoming wary of him. They all knew he had a formidable background, possibly a descendant of the "Six Supremacies" lineage. More importantly, he was Li Qingyue's partner, and the Eight Trigrams Furnace was currently in his hands! A small fraction of people, upon realizing who he was, felt their hairs stand on end, for they had encountered him in the White Bamboo Forest and had jointly ambushed him. When Qin Ming's Heavenly Radiance Energy was released, it was just a thin layer, but in that area of the White Bamboo Forest, he not only broke through their encirclement but also pierced through them, killing many gold-armored guards.

Qin Ming continued, "This contest among the outer disciples has left a deep impression on me. All kinds of methods were used; regardless of victory or defeat, after recovering from injuries, everyone will surely improve significantly. We should also exchange insights."

The group retreated further. Was this descendant of the Six Supremacies here for revenge?

Qin Ming smiled and waved his hand, "Please don't misunderstand. I'm talking about exchanging cultivation techniques and secret texts. We can share what we have." As these were all outer saints, their Heavenly Radiance Energy techniques should be quite good, and he sincerely wished to exchange with them.

However, many didn't quite believe him, some even thinking he was extorting them. Qin Ming felt utterly helpless; his sincerity was met with suspicion, and progress was very difficult. Even when someone did exchange a secret manual with him, they were extremely nervous, reciting and demonstrating with various complex emotions, making it difficult to fully convey the true essence of the text.

A long time passed before Qin Ming finally acquired a complete movement technique, "Leaping Movement Art." That outer saint sighed, saying that his ancestors had also produced great figures, once possessing the "Cane-Crossing-the-River Technique," but unfortunately it had been lost. Qin Ming's spirit immediately perked up, asking where his hometown was, hoping to visit someday. He mused that if any ancient artifacts were left behind, he might be able to restore the "Cane-Crossing-the-River Technique," which clearly surpassed the scope of ordinary cultivation methods.

Subsequently, Qin Ming also acquired a "Tiger Roar" technique. It didn't sound extraordinary, but it could cultivate a special energy that vibrated one's body, strengthening the internal organs. "Alas, whose ancestors haven't been prosperous? Above my family's Tiger Roar skill, there was once the 'Five Thunder Organ Refining Art,' and above that, it's said there was an 'Eight Sceneries Divine Illumination Art'."

Qin Ming earnestly asked him to elaborate. "The Eight Sceneries Divine Illumination Art, that's about refining a visible but intangible lamp in your chest and abdomen, using it to illuminate the entire body, fire-refining the internal organs, and even burning and forging the consciousness. The effects… I don't know, it's been lost for a long time."

Qin Ming sighed inwardly, truly there were many wondrous techniques in this world. Just hearing about them made one yearn, and if one could learn them, it would be truly thrilling. But he could only shake his head. This outer saint had already said that his great-grandfather's generation had moved countless times, changing many cities, and the family's roots were long forgotten.

Li Qingyue gracefully walked over, seeing Qin Ming exchanging Heavenly Radiance Energy techniques with others. With a gentle smile, she said, "When we return, I'll help you find a cultivation method. It should be very valuable."

Qin Ming handed her the Eight Trigrams Furnace, then walked aside with her, conversing in low voices. "You obtained the near-immortal item. Won't some old fogey disregard the rules and take it from you in the end?"

"No!" Li Qingyue shook her head.

"That's good." Qin Ming pulled out the furnace lid from his embrace, along with a large handful of colorful, crystal-clear "exotic gold" pieces, all accompanied by wondrous phenomena. Some flowed with a hazy purple mist, others were covered in mysterious patterns that could calm the mind. Then, he also handed her the half-page of metallic paper that flowed with auspicious light, only a corner of which remained.

Li Qingyue showed surprise; these items all had significant origins. She did not decline, accepting them all. This was because those old seniors had already entered and possessed Pure Yang spiritual light of consciousness; they surely knew what was at the bottom of the pit. Now, whether it was her or Qin Ming, the best choice was to take all the artifacts out and absolutely not keep them privately.

"This torn page... what a pity," Li Qingyue sighed softly.

Qin Ming said nothing. He planned to find an opportunity to pass on the two mysterious scriptures to her after this entire commotion had completely subsided. Because telling her now might carry unpredictable risks. He was deeply wary of the methods of those from outside the realm, such as possession. If someone were to probe Li Qingyue's spiritual light of consciousness, he naturally wouldn't be able to escape. Those domineering old seniors were all unfathomable, like ghosts and gods. Qin Ming didn't want to face them, and absolutely couldn't take risks right now. He could only comfort her, saying, "Perhaps it can be completed in the future. Things from a true transmission page aren't so easily lost."

"I hope so," Li Qingyue nodded. Before leaving, she sat quietly in the giant pit for a long time, refining her spiritual light of consciousness with Heavenly Radiance. "Those seniors told us to contend here, probably wanting us to cultivate by using this place."

Finally, a large group of people began walking back the way they came.

Li Qingxu gritted his teeth, supporting himself with his spiritual light of consciousness, and stood up alone.

"I'll carry you back," Zeng Yuan stepped forward.

"No need!" Li Qingxu shook his head, refusing, and then quickly moved away. However, it wasn't long before he returned. He was inherently cautious, fearing that someone might secretly follow him and kill him on the road while he was heavily injured.

Zeng Yuan and Zheng Maoze supported each other; they could be called comrades in misfortune. Both had touched the near-immortal item, having briefly possessed it, but had also been severely injured because of it.

"Junior Sister, earlier when we ganged up on you... sigh, I'm truly sorry," Tang Xumi grimaced, enduring the pain, wanting to explain to Li Qingyue, but ultimately said no more. He greatly admired Li Qingyue and wished to get closer, but he felt there would likely be no more opportunities from now on, and he felt a sense of melancholy.

Li Qingyue said, "Everyone used their means for the near-immortal item, there's nothing wrong with that. Once we leave this place, it'll be just like before, we're still fellow disciples." In truth, she knew that during the encirclement, Tang Xumi had left her an opening at the last moment, allowing her to break through and escape, but she had instead chosen to heavily injure Ren Yiping from another direction and fought her way out.

On the way, Qin Ming dug out his Overlord's Spear. "I'll hold it for you," Li Qingyue took it, to prevent anyone from Li Qingxu's lineage from being sore losers.

"Wang Caiwei might have recognized me," Qin Ming secretly informed her of this on the way.

Li Qingyue's steps paused for a moment, then she said simply, "It's fine."

"There's a result, they're coming out!" Outside the ruins of Luofu Immortal Mountain, many people were waiting. They already knew that various accidents had occurred in this contest, with the near-immortal item changing hands several times. Tang Xumi had even seized it twice, but regrettably lost it. In fact, those truly in the know were very clear that Li Qingxu had almost succeeded, with the cooperation of a young man from the Yin-Yang Temple, and Li Qingxu secretly helping Tang Xumi, then having Lu Zhen betray them in the end. This amounted to the combined efforts of three people, and if Li Qingxu had grabbed the Eight Trigrams Furnace even once, he could have quickly escaped with a mysterious遁法 (escape technique).

The Cui family's expressions were grim. They knew very well that if Cui Chonghe's spiritual light of consciousness had possessed a body without incident, he probably would have dominated. However, he was discovered twice in succession. Clearly, Cui Chonghe's second encirclement by the six core disciples was due to Li Qingyue secretly finding trustworthy people to leak the information to Tang Xumi and others.

"It truly was Li Qingyue who obtained the near-immortal item. She cleanly and beautifully defeated all her competitors. Such a result is well-deserved!" an old senior nodded, smiling as he spoke. This was a significant figure, someone who dared to argue fiercely with Li Qingxu's master. With his endorsement, who would dare to disagree?

Immediately, outside the ruins, many people began to praise Li Qingyue, believing she had the potential of a near-immortal and that resources should be allocated to her for focused cultivation.

While some were happy and excited, others were disappointed and indignant. Many disciples participated in this contest, backed by orthodoxies from outside the realm and even thousand-year-old aristocratic families. "Is Li Ye really Li Qingyue's cousin? He took the Overlord's Spear and killed many people..." someone said discontentedly.

"Shut up. When our Qingyue was surrounded by many people, our Li family didn't say anything. If you're looking for trouble, you can go to the reclusive Li family..."

It was only at this moment that someone from the family behind Li Qingyue stepped forward. It turned out to be a reclusive great clan. Although not as populous and vast as thousand-year-old aristocratic families, they were all true masters! Clearly, at such a critical juncture, no one would genuinely cause trouble, and those who had just intended to stir up muddy waters immediately shut up.

At this moment, Li Qingyue became the center. All eyes were on her, and she had no choice but to bow to some seniors, responding humbly and gracefully. Afterwards, a group of young people came forward, surrounding her like stars around the moon.

Undoubtedly, the struggle for the near-immortal item this time had a huge impact. In the Outer Realm Pure Land, ancient orthodoxies and powerful lineages all had representatives present. Because, in a sense, whoever obtained the near-immortal item was bound to rise rapidly and was destined to become a significant figure in the Outer Realm in the future. Now, some heirs of orthodoxies and even some renowned prodigies from the Outer Realm had arrived at the scene.

"Isn't that Senior Brother Pei? His talent is unparalleled, and he's not even twenty-five yet, but he can already discuss the Dao with some seniors. He's an immortal seed in our Pure Land!"

"Senior Brother Pei is as graceful as jade, refined and handsome, and he possesses such an otherworldly aura. He hasn't sought a Dao companion, standing there, he looks so well-matched with Junior Sister Li!" a woman couldn't help but exclaim.

"Oh, Senior Brother Zhuo has appeared too. Not only is his talent astonishing, but he has also opened his divine eye in his forehead, capable of perceiving immortal charm. His future achievements are unimaginable. His divine eye, compared to Junior Sister Li's spiritual pupil, is absolutely not inferior; they can be said to complement each other."

...

Qin Ming slowly retreated, as there was truly no place for him there. He was gradually squeezed out. Li Qingyue was surrounded by renowned talents from the Outer Realm, the worst of whom were in the Yellow Court realm. Some of them were destined to become sect masters in the Outer Realm Pure Land in the future, and they were already showing their prominence, their status already quite distinguished.

Li Qingyue, the center of all eyes, conversed with those people, smiling. It was clear that some were deliberately arranged by their families and the orthodoxies behind them. Li Qingyue had only recently embarked on the path of cultivation, making her suitable to approach, befriend, or even take things further.

Meng Xinghai came to Qin Ming's side and said, "You helped a great deal, why are you retreating?"

Qin Ming shook his head, "As a gold-armored guard, I stood out like a sore thumb there. Qingyue is surrounded by a gathering of heroes, either descendants of sect masters or some heaven-defying prodigies. The followers behind these people are jade-armored guards, or even... divine-armored guards." He could only sigh. He wanted to say goodbye before leaving, but he couldn't even get close; he would be blocked. The disparity in their statuses was too great, and the distance between them seemed to have suddenly widened.
