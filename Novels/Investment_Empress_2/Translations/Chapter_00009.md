# Chapter 9: Li Mo: “I Must Be a Fake Disciple” — Life Under the Same Roof with the Ice Cube

The entrance ceremony had concluded.

Two geniuses had reached the summit of the Ascension Stairway, an unprecedented event since the founding of the Clear Abyss Sect.

News spread like wildfire, quickly becoming known throughout the sect.

**Main Peak, Clear Abyss Mountain, Internal Affairs Hall.**

“We’ve gained four true disciples this year.”

“I heard the Old Master hasn’t taken a disciple in fifty years. Could it be that he’s finally thinking of cultivating a successor?”

“You weren’t there. That girl is as beautiful as a celestial being... *cough*, that’s not the point. The main point is she reached the top of the Ascension Stairway in mere dozens of breaths! She’s a monster.”

“Didn’t someone else reach the top too?”

“Ah, that one became a disciple of Elder Shang Wu.”

“*Gasp!*”

Several inner disciples in the Internal Affairs Hall were drinking tea and chatting excitedly.

When they heard one had joined the Ninth Peak, they all leaned back in their chairs with strange expressions, their eyes filled with a hint of pity.

*This kid is done for.*

“Sigh, if it weren’t for being in the same cohort as that girl, he might have been cultivated as a seed for the Sect Master position too.”

“He has great talent, but bad luck.”

Someone sighed at this.

The other inner disciples nodded deeply in agreement.

Just as they were talking, they suddenly all put down their tea bowls and stood up straight, shouting respectfully:

“Greetings, Elder Qian.”

A short, plump elder nodded.

“I’m here to bring a few new true disciples to collect their items.”

“Also, distribute the first month’s stipend early. Just follow the standards set for each peak.”

The elder’s name was Qian Bufan, the Elder of Internal Affairs for the Clear Abyss Sect.

Within the sect, he was one of the highest-ranking elders.

Because Internal Affairs also included finance.

*He’s doing this to curry favor, mostly because of Ying Bing...* Li Mo understood this but still bowed to Qian Bufan.

“Thank you, Elder.”

“Ah, you don’t need to thank me.”

Qian Bufan turned his body to the side, not accepting the bow.

Li Mo was confused.

But he would find out the reason soon enough.

The entrance items were distributed quickly: two sets of exquisitely made cloud-patterned robes and a red copper identity plaque, standard issue from the sect.

The monthly stipend, however, was another story.

“Mu Xiaoxiao, residing in the Divine Weapon Peak. Monthly silver: five hundred taels. One hundred-reforging forging hammer. Two bottles of Jade Bone Pills.”

“Lin Ye, residing in the Ruyi Peak. Monthly silver: three hundred taels. Two bottles of Calming Mind Pills.”

An inner disciple brought out two trays.

Then he looked at Ying Bing, his expression becoming much more respectful.

“Ying Bing, entering the Clear Abyss Main Peak. Monthly silver: one thousand taels. One superior grade寒 iron sword. Two bottles of Pure Yang Pills. Ten stalks of Vein Cleansing Grass...”

The inner disciple rattled off a long list in one breath.

Other disciples passing by looked on with envy.

The treatment of the Sect Master’s true disciple was drool-worthy.

It wasn’t over.

The disciple continued, “The Sect Master has ordered that you may choose another courtyard as your residence, exclusively for your use. You may select it yourself.”

A private courtyard!

This was a treatment reserved for stewards.

And not just any steward; one had to have made contributions to the sect.

Besides having excellent training conditions, it was also a symbol of status.

“Autumn Water Pavilion.”

Ying Bing answered without hesitation.

“Uh, alright, I’ll record that for you right away, Senior Sister.” The inner disciple was stunned for a moment but nodded.

“What about me?”

Li Mo pointed to himself, thinking he had been forgotten.

“Junior Brother is from the Qunyu Peak. Hmm, the resources your peak prepared for a true disciple...”

The inner disciple took out a thick ledger and handed it over.

*Could this be a secret manual or something? It’s way too thick...*

Li Mo flipped it open in confusion and saw written on it:

“162nd Year of Jingtai, 2nd Month: Qunyu Peak advanced 3,000 taels of silver.”

“162nd Year of Jingtai, 3rd Month: Qunyu Peak advanced 10 jars of Apricot Blossom Wine.”

“164th Year of Jingtai, 9th Month: Destroyed the Beast Cage on the Precious Beast Peak, causing the escape of various beasts. Total loss of 52 beasts.”

...

It was densely packed, and it was clearly a ledger of debts and IOUs.

Li Mo: “?”

A string of question marks appeared over Little Li’s head.

“Is this not a mistake?”

“No mistake.”

Elder Qian Bufan sighed and said, “The resources for the true disciples of each peak are provided by the peak itself, not distributed by the sect.”

“The Qunyu Peak has not provided any resources to its true disciple.”

“Not only that, but your Senior Shang Wu has also advanced many things from the Internal Affairs Hall. When you have time, take this ledger to her and tell her to pay off her debts early.”

“This whole thick book... is all IOUs?”

Little Li’s mouth twitched.

So, while everyone else gets benefits, I have to take on debt?

Qian Bufan nodded and gave a friendly reminder: “By the way, there shouldn’t be a residence for you on the Qunyu Peak. You’d best plan ahead and build yourself a thatched hut or something. For materials... you can ask the Internal Affairs Hall.”

“A thatched hut?”

Li Mo fell into deep thought.

He never imagined that after joining the Clear Abyss Sect and becoming a true disciple, he would end up homeless.

*I must be a fake disciple!*

“Stay with me.”

Suddenly, Ying Bing’s red lips parted.

Li Mo’s body trembled. He turned around in a daze, but he couldn’t see any unusual expression on that cold, clear face.

*Is this still the Ice Cube I know?*

“The Autumn Water Pavilion has excellent surroundings. You two would make a fine immortal couple,” Qian Bufan said, strobing his belly, a hint of a “shipping” smile appearing on his face.

It seemed Elder Qian was quite the shipper.

“Uh, Elder Qian, you’re thinking too much into it.”

Li Mo shook his head.

---

“Huh? You two little ones aren’t a couple?”

Old Qian was stunned.

He had heard they were childhood sweethearts, entered the Clear Abyss Sect together, and were both true disciples. Today, Ying Bing had specifically said for Li Mo to stay at her place. They were practically living together.

In this day and age, who of the opposite sex share a living space if they’re just friends?

“Uh...”

Li Mo hadn’t even opened his mouth.

Ying Bing’s voice rang out from the side.

“Not.”

Her tone was casual, but it made one feel a chill.

“You’ve misunderstood.”

Li Mo waved his hands repeatedly.

Then neither of them said anything more.

The atmosphere in the hall became somewhat strange for a moment.

“I’m old, I love to gossip. Please forgive me,” Qian Bufan laughed it off, smacking his lips, looking a bit disappointed.

Li Mo gave a bitter smile and retracted his gaze from Ying Bing.

Was the Ice Cube beautiful?

One could say she was a beauty that could topple cities and kingdoms.

But... she was too cold.

Cold in both personality and physically.

Thinking of this, Li Mo couldn’t help but sigh.

Compared to admiration, he felt more pity for this cold, clear childhood friend.

In his memories, she hadn’t been like this from the start. Her personality changed after a family tragedy.

If he were in her shoes, Li Mo doubted he could remain optimistic and gentle.

Across from him.

Ying Bing shook her head imperceptibly.

*Heaven and Earth are ruthless; the path of martial arts is long.*

*In her previous life, countless outstanding men had pursued her.*

*But if she hadn’t severed her seven emotions and six desires, focusing all her spirit on flowing upstream against the river of martial arts, she could not have reached the pinnacle.*

*In this life, she maintains the same unwavering heart on the path.*

...

...

**Autumn Water Pavilion.**

Located not far from the Qunyu Peak.

It was nestled by the mountains and beside the water, with beautiful scenery.

The pavilion was three stories high and came with a separate courtyard. A clear spring flowed through the middle. It was quaint, elegant, and possessed a natural beauty, standing out from the other pavilions.

At this moment, the gate of the Autumn Water Pavilion was opened.

Two people walked in, one after the other. The少年 (young man) was carrying large and small bags.

“This house is built quite well.”

Li Mo was very satisfied with his new living environment and felt a bit of emotion.

In the past, Ying Bing had stayed at the Li Mansion, living under someone else’s roof.

Now, the roles were reversed.

He turned his head, but saw Ying Bing staring at the courtyard, lost in thought.

“It seems no one has lived here for a long time. Let’s clean it up first,” Li Mo said, looking around.

He walked around for a bit but couldn’t find any cleaning tools.

Ying Bing suddenly said, “The broom is under the stone bench in the flower bed.”

Li Mo bent down and, sure enough, found a broom.

“You go boil some hot water.”

Ying Bing tied her black hair up with a simple band and said naturally.

It was as if she had lived here for a long time, seamlessly taking on the role of the lady of the Autumn Water Pavilion.

She wasn’t doing it on purpose.

But the way she swept the floor had an air of calm and composure, as if she were used to being in a high position.

*Great, I’ve become a hard-working little nanny.*

Li Mo pouted and saluted. “I obey the superior’s instructions.”

Although he knew the Ice Cube was always like this, he still felt a little不甘 (unwillingness) in his heart.

*Hmm, as a male with a very strong self-esteem, this is normal.*

...

Steamy hot water was ready. Li Mo poured it into a large mahogany tub.

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested a bucket of bathwater, helping your investment target clean her body.】

【Investment Feedback Received: One gold bar.】

The gold bars from the system’s feedback were all very heavy.

Li Mo was silent for a moment, then shouted towards the yard:

“Is one bucket of bathwater not enough? I’ll boil some more for you!”

...

...

Night fell.

The next day.

Li Mo woke up as usual. He glanced at the room next door, which was frozen solid, then went into the kitchen to make breakfast.

He had cast a wide net with his investments recently, which had provided him with many strange items, including a lot of food that could be eaten after being heated.

By the time the sun had fully risen, Li Mo came out with soy milk and steamed buns. The Ice Cube was already sitting there.

Her lips were still colorless, and her face was whiter than snow.

The phrase “beautifully freezing” suited her perfectly.

Not long after breakfast, a powerful shout came from outside.

“Is Senior Sister Ying Bing here!”

Li Mo opened the door.

An elder was sitting on a simple and grand carriage. The four eaves of the carriage were carved with the Four Symbols, exquisite and unpretentious.

“I am the Sect Master’s driver,” the elder said with a smile. “By the Sect Master’s order, I am here to guide you up the mountain. In the future, I will be the one to pick you up. There are many buildings on the Clear Abyss Peak, so I’m afraid you might get lost.”

*Wow, the Sect Master’s carriage.*

Li Mo thought to himself, *no wonder it looks so grand.*

*Look, this is the treatment of a true disciple.*

*I’ll probably have to walk up the mountain.*

“Thank you.”

Ying Bing nodded and got on the carriage. Then, she lifted the curtain and said:

“Li Mo, before you go to the Qunyu Peak, you should prepare a few pots of good wine.”

With that, the carriage sped off, leaving a trail of dust.
