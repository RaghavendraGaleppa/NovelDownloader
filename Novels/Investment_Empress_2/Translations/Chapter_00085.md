# Chapter 85: Shang Wu’s Special Teaching

“You should sleep in my room from now on.”

Li Mo suddenly said.

*Clatter—*

Along with his words, the chopsticks in Ying Bing’s hand fell.

The chopsticks shattered on the frozen ground.

Ying Bing was caught off guard, her breathing becoming slightly hurried.

Li Mo was speechless and said helplessly, “Look at this place. Is it even livable?”

“......”

Ying Bing didn’t speak. She lowered her eyes and saw the state of the room.

It was a mess.

Even the bed she slept on was currently supported by unmelted solid ice. Once the ice melted, it would probably collapse.

“You move to the隔壁 room; the side room is quite comfortable for me to sleep in,” Li Mo added.

“Okay.”

Ying Bing nodded. She picked up another pair of chopsticks and began eating her food slowly, her movements still a little stiff.

Li Mo didn’t know what had happened to her, nor did he know what to say.

Perhaps she wanted to be alone right now?

...

It wasn’t even halfway through the afternoon.

The ice lump had switched rooms and continued her isolation, not wanting to speak or even practice her martial arts.

However, Shang Wu returned first. Her beautiful face was filled with confidence.

“Master, did you go to the Scripture Pavilion to read?” Li Mo asked.

“Mm.”

Shang Wu nodded high-spiritedly, as if she had already grasped the truth.

“Have you thought about what to teach me?” Li Mo raised an eyebrow.

Thinking about it, it made sense. The Master was so young yet held the position of Elder with such profound cultivation; she was indeed a dragon among men.

She just lacked the method to teach disciples.

After learning a little, teaching him would be more than enough.

“I saw a book that said a master should teach their disciple the things they are best at,” Shang Wu said, raising her chin.

“That’s right,” Li Mo felt that made sense.

“I thought about it. The three things I am best at are simply these,” Shang Wu held up three fingers.

Little Li Mo adopted a posture of listening attentively.

Then he heard the Master say proudly, “Fighting, drinking, and gambling.”

Li Mo: “.....”

It seemed there was nothing wrong with that.

But why did it feel so strange?

“That book also said that to teach a disciple, one must lead by example. Let’s start with the first one,” Shang Wu looked at Li Mo, her almond eyes narrowing and the corner of her mouth curling up. “Come, fight me first.”

“We’ll teach you what you need to learn while we fight.”

Li Mo: “?”

What a perfect example of teaching through words and actions.

“Can we not fight?”

“No, I must be a qualified Master.”

“Wait!”

“What is it now?”

“Before we start, please tell me which shelf that book is on in the Scripture Pavilion...”

Little Li Mo swore to himself that he would go burn that book.

Shang Wu’s narrowed almond eyes flashed. “I’ll tell you after the fight.”

“.....”

Li Mo said no more, a small fire igniting in his eyes.

Although the Master was known by many Elders as a先天 Fighting Saint Body and had a fierce reputation in the Qingyuan Sect, capable of stopping children from crying at night, he wasn’t exactly weak now, was he?

He was someone who had exchanged blows with the Daughter of Destiny!

And he had broken through to the Internal Breath realm last night, making him stronger than before.

Li Mo felt a bit inflated, thinking that even if he faced his Master, he wouldn’t lose too badly.

He followed the Master out the back door to the empty ground behind it.

Then.

Just as he stepped out the back door.

*Hum—*

A hum sounded, and an endless sea of fire spread from Shang Wu’s surroundings, completely enveloping the area within a hundred meters.

Instantly, everything fell silent.

Surging heat swept in from all directions.

In a flash, Li Mo felt as if he were inside a pill-refining furnace, unable to perceive anything from the outside world.

Inner Scene.

This was the effect of an Inner Scene expert influencing the heavens and earth with the scene in their heart, creating a domain-like effect.

This... this isn’t right.

“Master, aren’t you going to suppress your cultivation?” Li Mo asked in confusion.

“The first rule of fighting is to bully the weak with your strength if you can. Never do anything flashy,” Shang Wu was seriously teaching.

Li Mo: “!”

How am I supposed to fight you like this?!

I forfeit!

I want to forfeit!

But obviously, forfeiting was impossible.

The beautiful Master was itching for a fight.

...

Half an hour later.

---

“*Hiss*...”

Li Mo stumbled backward, covering his reddened forehead.

Alright, although the Master didn’t suppress her cultivation, she did hold back.

Every time he launched an attack, she countered with a flick of her finger.

That jade-like finger seemed like an insurmountable mountain.

No matter how he attacked, it would flick his forehead the next second.

“That’s it?” Shang Wu rubbed her fingertip and chuckled.

“.....”

Li Mo clenched his fists.

*Wind Shadow Step!*

His figure suddenly split into eight, attacking Shang Wu from different directions.

However, Shang Wu just snorted lightly.

*Bang—*

The next moment, he flew back even faster.

“Don’t get carried away when fighting. Always stay calm.”

“You aren’t the hot-blooded youth from a storybook. Anger will only make you lose your composure in front of enemies you could have originally defeated.”

“A true fighting king can even find the time to provoke the opponent while fighting,” Shang Wu’s words fell.

Li Mo’s head was dizzy from the flicking and didn’t think too much about it.

His mind short-circuited, thinking he had grasped the essence of what the Master said.

Heh, isn’t it just about having a sharp tongue? I’m an expert at that!

He instinctively followed her lead and said, “Old woman?”

Shang Wu’s smile suddenly froze.

The air instantly solidified, only the scorching heat slowly rising.

“Hehehe... there’s one more thing I didn’t tell you,” Shang Wu’s beautiful face wore a nuclear-level smile, the words popping out from between her teeth. “Don’t provoke an existence you can’t defeat.”

Li Mo: “!”

A fierce wind brushed against his face.

It felt as if an ancient giant beast was slowly waking up.

At this moment, Little Li Mo’s scalp went numb.

His instinct for survival made him draw upon the power of the World Seed.

The Pansha Meteor Hammer appeared in his hand.

The first stance of the Mountain Stabilizing Hammer, Mountain Stabilizing.

*Hum—*

The air solidified. Everything in the surroundings trembled violently and blurred. The sharp, tangible aura of war and slaughter ran rampant.

Shang Wu, in her state of fury, raised an eyebrow slightly.

*Boom!!*

The earth trembled, and the sun dimed.

This was the first time Li Mo had used a Divine Weapon.

Terrifying power filled the entire domain, even spilling out to the outside.

This hammer strike was like a rumbling thunder, like a divine punishment, overwhelmingly fierce.

However.

The terrifying hammer met the woman’s pink-white palm, and its momentum came to an abrupt halt.

Even the immense force was instantly dissipated into nothingness.

“You小子,” Shang Wu’s hand held the vibrating Pansha Meteor Hammer, her almond eyes filled with shock.

Of course, Li Mo couldn’t unleash the full might of the Divine Weapon, nor was it possible.

But just being able to swing it roughly was enough to be shocking.

Even she had to use a bit of strength to block it.

“I’m not fighting anymore. I really can’t.”

“Just flick me to death,” Li Mo lay on the ground, drained of energy, turning into a salted fish.

I’m done trying to be a master.

“How did you do that?” Shang Wu reached out and poked his face, looking at her precious disciple as if he were a rare animal.

Li Mo recalled his hammer and grinned. “Anger doesn’t necessarily lead to a power-up.”

“But the will to survive can.”

What kind of answer was that?

Suddenly.

Li Mo’s expression changed to one of shock again. “Elder Qian, why have you come to my house? Are you here to collect a debt?”

Shang Wu was also startled, whipping her head around in the direction Li Mo was looking.

There was nothing there.

Where was Elder Qian?

When she turned back, Li Mo was gone, having fled somewhere. She couldn’t even sense him with the domain she had released.

This was something Little Li Mo had just领悟ed.

If you can’t win, don’t fight to the death.

Of the thirty-six strategies, the best is to slip away.

“How did he get out?” Shang Wu narrowed her almond eyes, examining a corner of the domain thoughtfully.

She found the reason.

There was a hole there不知何时, as if burned out by a certain kind of fire.

“Shang Wu’s domain is projected from the Southern Ming Li Fire.”

“He can not only use a Divine Weapon but also break through an Inner Scene domain?”

Upper Floor.

By the window.

Ying Bing silently watched everything unfold.

The eyes that had finally calmed down couldn’t help but ripple once more.
