# Chapter 147: The Decisive Battle at Bianliang

After thoroughly looting the belongings of Qi Zhong, the elite disciple of Dry Cloud Pavilion, Lin Shan and Black Skeleton Demon Lord divided the spoils.

They counted over twenty thousand spirit stones, hundreds of low-grade magical artifacts, more than a dozen mid-grade artifacts, and four remaining high-grade artifacts, along with various cultivation manuals and techniques. Most importantly, they discovered over a dozen bottles of "Emerging Cloud Pills"—special cultivation aids for Foundation Establishment cultivators from Dry Cloud Pavilion.

These pills were equivalent to the "Azure Fall Pills" of the Black Lotus Sect, each capable of accelerating a Foundation Establishment cultivator's progress by half a month. Such pills were exclusive benefits for disciples of top-tier sects, never shared with outsiders.

Lin Shan was overjoyed—this was exactly what he needed to boost his cultivation. The more, the better.

The core cultivation techniques of Dry Cloud Pavilion were nowhere to be found, likely passed down orally or through divine sense transmission. Even soul-searching wouldn't reveal them, as they were probably protected by self-destructing contracts and oaths to prevent leakage.

Among the remaining items were numerous forging manuals and personal notes, evidence of Qi Zhong's dedication to artifact crafting. However, Lin Shan had no interest in these.

He claimed the four high-grade artifacts—a jade ring, a teacup, a thumb ring, and a miniature pagoda—which Qi Zhong had abandoned in his escape and were later seized by Lin Shan's tree demons. The other high-grade artifacts had either been destroyed by Luan Chun's whistling arrow or shattered by concentrated fire from the "Bean Soldiers" and "Rune Ballistae."

Lin Shan gave the dozen or so mid-grade artifacts to Black Skeleton Demon Lord, who intended to arm his skeleton army. Observing this, Lin Shan considered adopting a similar strategy, equipping his "Water Bear Chieftain" and "Bean Soldiers" with artifacts. However, his proficiency in divine sense control paled in comparison to the demon lord's effortless multitasking. In battle, he preferred to let his subordinates act freely rather than divide his attention.

Of the remaining spirit stones, Lin Shan took fifteen thousand, leaving five thousand for Black Skeleton Demon Lord. After some thought, he decided to give the demon lord some autonomy, recognizing its value as a key combat asset.

As for Qi Zhong's spiritual donkey, it had barely regained its freedom after its master's death before being captured by Luan Chun. Unlike righteous cultivators who would form a "Beast Companion Contract," the little demoness forcibly imposed a "Master-Servant Contract" on the creature. The former allowed the beast to serve future disciples after its master's passing, while the latter—typical of demonic cultivators—ensured the beast's death upon its master's demise.

Having expended her whistling arrow against Qi Zhong, Luan Chun deserved the spiritual donkey as compensation. Lin Shan didn't object, though he lamented the loss of the three high-grade defensive artifacts.

Lin Shan also inspected Princess Guo's storage pouch but found nothing of particular value compared to his current wealth. He handed it over to Luan Chun, reasoning that it might serve as an explanation if Elder Yan inquired about the expended arrow.

---

After retrieving the materials from the two great formations, the sounds of battle outside had ceased. The righteous faction's camp had fallen, and demonic cultivators were pillaging everything in sight, stuffing their storage pouches like locusts stripping the land bare.

By nightfall, Yan Yuanchun returned from afar. Lin Shan and the others learned that she had severely wounded the Golden Core cultivator from the Azure Origin Sect stationed there, though the enemy had ultimately escaped.

She also brought news: three days prior, the demonic forces had breached the Eastern Gate Pass. A day later, they had reached Bianliang, the capital of the Great Song Dynasty, where the battle had raged for a full day and night.

Yan Yuanchun tallied her remaining forces—just over two hundred, all exhausted. She allowed them two days of rest, her intentions clear. This vanguard unit, though cannon fodder, had not only crossed the Poison Burial Great Valley but also captured an enemy camp—a remarkable achievement. There was no need to rush to the capital's battlefield to meet certain death. While their current engagement had involved a thousand combatants, the capital's battle numbered in the tens of thousands—a决战 where survival was far from guaranteed.

That night, the camp celebrated around bonfires. Luan Chun paraded her newly acquired donkey, showing off the poor creature—now toothless from its earlier beating by the Water Bear Chieftain—around the flames. Surprisingly, Old Man Zhong emerged from the Misty Wind Illusion Zone on his own and was soon laughing conspiratorially with Black Skeleton Demon Lord. The other underlings also reveled, having plundered the camp's resources.

As the saying went, "Three years without a windfall, but a windfall feeds three years." What could compare to the spoils of robbery?

Lin Shan sat apart, the firelight flickering eerily across his face, masking his turbulent thoughts. Princess Guo's enigmatic smile before her death replayed in his mind, especially her final words:

—"That esteemed master was right. It seems you are the tribulation of my life."

—"When we meet again, let this end."

"Esteemed master"? The so-called Holy Maiden? Could she truly have foreseen Princess Guo's destined tribulation?

More unsettling was the princess's confident demeanor, as if their next encounter would bring closure. What gave her such arrogance? The jade talisman? What incredible opportunity did it conceal to inspire such faith?

Lin Shan had bested her in every encounter. Even without Luan Chun and Black Skeleton Demon Lord's aid, he could have worn down Qi Zhong gradually—his storage bracelet contained over a hundred thousand spirit stones left by Elder Tortoise, dwarfing Qi Zhong's meager reserves.

The more Lin Shan pondered, the more perplexed he became. Had Princess Guo truly obtained some extraordinary legacy? Or was she simply unable to fully unlock its potential yet, confident that time would grant her supremacy over Lin Shan?

Then there was the Holy Maiden of the Enchantress Palace, who had left a teleportation array to reclaim the jade talisman. This suggested Princess Guo's role as a furnace was far more critical than implied. If she were truly insignificant, why would the Holy Maiden predict her tribulation and entrust her with such a great opportunity and a split soul?

Alternatively, perhaps the jade talisman had been unclaimed until Princess Guo obtained it, slipping from the Holy Maiden's control. Only with the princess's death could the Holy Maiden reclaim it.

Lin Shan's speculations led nowhere, and he eventually set aside the mystery. Looking beyond the present, he was more confident than anyone about the future. No matter how great others' opportunities, could they possibly rival his enhancement panel?

His thoughts turned to ancient charms and the colossal Black Lotus Buddha statue in the capital. Who would claim it after the battle's conclusion?

The night echoed with laughter, though some minds churned with unspoken tides.

Two days later, Yan Yuanchun led the remaining forces to Bianliang. After flying over a thousand miles west, they arrived at their destination late at night.

The ancient capital, ablaze for three days and nights, illuminated the surrounding hundred miles. Six dazzling stars—representing six Nascent Soul experts locked in combat—dominated the night sky. Around them, hundreds of smaller lights—Golden Core experts—clashed in a spectacular display of magical artifacts.

Lower in the sky, Foundation Establishment cultivators darted like oversized fireflies, some engaging peers, others pillaging the city or sabotaging defensive artifacts on the walls.

The true brutality unfolded on the ground, where countless Qi Refining cultivators advanced like ants, wave after wave assaulting the city gates. Siege engines—rune-carved catapults, ballistae, battering rams, and scaling ladders—lobbed streams of multicolored light into the city.

From the darkness, reinforcements streamed in from all directions, converging like rivers into the sea. The demonic faction's numbers swelled, mirroring the forces Yan Yuanchun had brought. Simultaneously, righteous sects mustered their own reinforcements. This决战 wasn't limited to the three great orthodox sects—dozens of smaller sects and hundreds of cultivation families had joined the fray.

In the western lands of Great Song, demonic cultivators had long been vilified as heinous villains who slaughtered cities and dyed rivers red. Faced with this once-in-a-millennium demonic calamity, even rogue cultivators and reclusive sects answered the call to defend.

The battle had drawn all forces from the central warzone, with the Black Lotus Sect and Violet Thunder Sect at the forefront. Both sides' numbers had surged past two hundred thousand. After three days and nights of carnage, corpses piled within and beyond the walls, and shattered artifacts littered the ground.

The millennium-old capital lay in ruins. Under relentless siege, countless buildings had collapsed and burned, with civilian casualties in the millions.

The orthodox sects hadn't anticipated the demonic faction's rapid breach of the Falling Pine Mountain defenses. Once the Eastern Gate fell, the demonic forces had stormed the capital with unstoppable momentum, leaving no time for evacuation or reinforcement.

Orthodox sects imposed strict recruitment criteria, accepting only young disciples with clean backgrounds or exceptional talent. Demonic sects, however, welcomed all comers as cannon fodder, offering meager rewards in exchange for service.

Thus, while orthodox forces boasted higher-quality low-level cultivators, their numbers paled against the demonic hordes. At the higher levels, the balance was more even—but when elite forces reached a stalemate, the tide of battle hinged on the low-level combatants.

Though orthodox low-level cultivators were elite, few could contend with four or five opponents simultaneously. The决战's outcome was all but decided: while the eastern gate held, the northern and southern gates had fallen, and demonic cultivators had plunged into street fighting.

Across a hundred-mile radius, demonic fires—nearly inextinguishable—scorched the land, driving the environment toward desertification. Reinforcements continued to arrive, with some demonic units ambushing orthodox relief forces, steadily eroding their strength. With the orthodox waning and the demonic waxing, the capital's fall seemed inevitable.

When Yan Yuanchun and Lin Shan arrived, they found the situation unlike their expectations. Though the capital hadn't fully fallen, the perilous siege phase had ended, giving way to looting and hunting within the city. Their timing was perfect—neither too early nor too late.
