# Chapter 648: Ninety-Nine Strands of Golden Nature

"Be sure to provoke Bael's fury."

The two upper gods felt their hearts tremble.

This scheme was too vicious.

It was aimed at completely igniting the flames of war between the two factions of the Natural God System. Especially by pointing out the theft of the Thunder Authority, this was practically provoking the逆鳞 (inverse scale) of Bael, the Thunder's Fury. The other party would surely attack without hesitation.

And Lord Orion would absolutely not tolerate such a challenge to his authority. Once the Lord God's will descends and dispatches a powerful god system, the scale of the war would instantly escalate, sweeping through the entire northern territory of the Natural God System.

By then...

"Lord Xuan."

Lockman's voice was hoarse. "If the Lord God personally descends to investigate."

"Rest assured."

Xu Yunfan interrupted him.

"Lord God-level existences rarely make a move lightly. They are more accustomed to dispatching their subordinate powerful god systems as extensions of their will. I want them to send troops, the more the better. As for investigation, as long as you don't actively draw the Lord God's direct gaze upon this place, the术 I've laid down is enough to temporarily block investigation from upper gods and below. Remember your identities and your words. Don't reveal any flaws."

He paused, his gaze sweeping over the two upper gods.

"After the matter is done, your divine kingdoms and believers will still be under your own rule; I will not interfere. Even more so, if this battle can draw out Bael, his divine core might help you take a step further."

Xu Yunfan drew a tempting饼 (cake/bait).

Although this cake could be retracted at any time.

Lockman and Buthes exchanged a glance, seeing the helplessness and a faint glimmer of hope in each other's eyes.

Under absolute control and the threat of death, they had no other choice.

Especially Buthes; if he could take this opportunity to eliminate Buthes, a potential rival, a fierce light flashed in his eyes.

"We obey the Lord's decree!"

The two upper gods bowed simultaneously to accept the order.

"Buthes, you go first. Return immediately to the Storm Divine Kingdom and act according to the plan. Lockman, you stay. There are some details regarding Anya."

Xu Yunfan waved his hand.

Buthes' soul phantom bowed again, not daring to delay for a moment. The green light around him flickered slightly as he transformed into a slightly dim stream of light, carefully circumventing the edge of the Zhou Tian Xuan Qiong Lock Boundary Array, and rushing towards his Storm Divine Kingdom.

He had to appear in his divine kingdom in a severely injured state as soon as possible to gain Buthes' trust.

Watching Buthes disappear into the horizon, Xu Yunfan waved his hand and withdrew the Zhou Tian Xuan Qiong Lock Boundary Array.

The violent energy turbulence on the ice plain gradually subsided, leaving only a scene of devastation and countless believers and warriors who had lost their divine guidance,茫然无措 (at a loss). Their life or death was no longer within Xu Yunfan's concern.

Xu Yunfan looked at Lockman. "She sat by and watched us fight with Buthes, even remaining indifferent as her subordinate gods were reaped?"

Lockman said solemnly, "Yes. Anya has always been like this, as if standing by. Her territory, the Eternal Silence Glacier, is itself a forbidden land, naturally isolating the inside and outside. Subordinate suspects she might be in a critical state, such as attempting to break through the limit of an upper god? Or truly attempting her crazy Eternal Freezing. At this moment, her divine kingdom's defense must be raised to the extreme, and her perception of the outside world might be at its lowest."

Xu Yunfan's eyes narrowed slightly.

Whichever it was, it meant Anya was temporarily unable to pay attention to other matters, or her sensitivity to external changes had decreased.

This was also an opportunity for him.

"Don't move on her for now."

After much deliberation, Xu Yunfan finally gave up on the idea of capturing Anya and made a decision. "Let her continue to slumber. Our goal is to provoke a larger war. By the time she is awakened by the raging flames of war outside, or forced into it, that will be our opportunity. By then, she will either have already consumed a great deal."

He needed Anya to remain until the end, as bait to attract larger prey, or to deliver a fatal blow in the most chaotic moment.

"You, return immediately to the Eternal Frozen Court. According to the plan, seek help from the upper gods you are familiar with. Remember, be sorrowful and indignant, be tragic. Make them feel that the Winter God System is facing a disaster of annihilation, make them feel there is an opportunity to be seized. Go."

"Yes!"

Lockman dared not to delay. He bowed deeply, and the ice mist around him surged, raising a gust of cold wind as he flew towards the Eternal Frozen Court.

After all, being severely injured meant a large area of belief land was likely to be emptied. As long as one felt their strength was sufficient, no one would refuse.

On the ice plain, only Xu Yunfan remained standing alone in the wind and snow.

He raised his hand and recalled the Star Spirit Banner, his divine sense sinking into the space within the banner.

After the frantic reaping just now, the stars within the banner were brilliant, the trajectories of the Zhou Tian Star Dou Array clearer and more profound, and its aura had clearly increased by a large margin.

But there was still a way to go before the 365 Star Lords were complete.

[Zhou Tian Star Dou Array (79/365)]

The number in his vision jumped silently.

Xu Yunfan calculated in his heart.

Seventy-nine banner spirits at the Foundation Establishment level, including several at the peak of the Mid-tier Gods. The power gathered, combined with the Star Dou Array, was enough to pose a huge threat to a single Foundation Establishment perfection.

But facing a Golden Core True Lord, it was still far from enough.

In the complete version of the Zhou Tian Star Dou Array, every Zhou Tian star has a Star Lord stationed, allowing it to display extreme power, capable of trapping and killing a True Lord.

Xu Yunfan flipped his hand and took out the Divine霄 Refining World Cauldron.

Inside the cauldron, a milky white flame of belief burned fiercely, refining the dozens of divine soul remnants newly incorporated and the mixed belief force stripped from shattered divine cores. Strands of pure divine power origin were extracted, slowly nourishing the thirty-four strands of immortal golden nature floating within his Dantian cave heaven prototype.

Although the speed was much faster than before, it still needed some time to reach the ninety-nine strands of immortal golden nature he envisioned.

Next time, it should be completed.

Ninety-nine strands of immortal golden nature, combined with his own Divine霄 Thunder and the imagery of the Profound Void Undying.

Even in the Taihua Spirit Void World, this is unprecedented throughout history.

Praise this land.

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly.

But right now, time is precisely what he lacks the most.

It's uncertain if the True Lord of Qingyuan could appear at any moment. Once discovered by the Taihua Spirit Void World, the three Lord Gods of this world would likely not be able to resist soon.

True Lord of Qingyuan...

The other party commands the Wonder Dao of Primordial Qi, and their ability to track causality is no small matter.

Although Xu Yunfan has laid down three layers of causal secret techniques and the Erosion Heaven Restriction to conceal it, and the Star Spirit Banner also blocks most of the aura of the Taiyin Mirror Dao Fruit, these can only delay, not absolutely guarantee safety, in front of a prepared Golden Core True Lord.

"Must speed up."

Xu Yunfan muttered lowly.

Ninety-nine strands of immortal golden nature, supporting the condensed imagery and the cave heaven achieved, is thrilling to think about.

Putting away the Divine霄 Refining World Cauldron and the Star Spirit Banner, his figure turned into an inconspicuous streak of thunder, quietly blending into the wind and snow, and fled towards the direction of the Frost Thunder City Divine Kingdom.

He needed a brief rest, to refine the gains from this battle, and at the same time, closely monitor the progress of Lockman and Buthes seeking aid.
