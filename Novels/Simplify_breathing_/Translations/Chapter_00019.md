**Chapter 19: Breaking a Promise**

Chen Fei and Chi Defeng haggled a few more times, finally settling on a price 10% above market value, with pickup scheduled for six days later.

Leaving the black market, Chen Fei returned to his rented courtyard, a smile playing on his lips. In truth, even if the price of medicinal herbs had surged by tenfold, it wouldn't have been a huge deal for Chen Fei. After all, once refined into pills, the profits would have already multiplied dozens of times over. However, in business, one couldn't simply agree to any price offered. The other party wouldn't think you generous; rather, they'd assume you were easily fooled, which would inevitably lead to all sorts of future troubles.

He pulled a movement technique manual from under his bed and began to study it. River Cloud Crossing had already integrated thirteen manuals. The time it took to cultivate it to Grand Completion was getting shorter and shorter, indicating that new manuals were offering diminishing returns in supplementing the movement technique. A quarter of an hour later, he finished reading the new manual, and information for "Swallows Flying in Pairs" appeared on his panel. Chen Fei then integrated the Grand Completion River Cloud Crossing with Swallows Flying in Pairs.

[Cultivation Technique: River Cloud Crossing (Grand Completion 7325/10000)]

Immediately after integration, it was already close to Grand Completion, signifying that the room for improvement was rapidly shrinking. The day it reached Grand Completion immediately upon integrating a new manual would mean that the technique had no further potential for advancement. Chen Fei's original idea of continuously improving and creating stronger techniques by integrating various low-tier cultivation methods now seemed a bit fanciful.

Chen Fei maintained a routine of alchemy, cultivation, and face-scrubbing. His cultivation had already reached a critical threshold, and his movement technique manuals, after integrating sixteen of them, could no longer progress. So, Chen Fei simplified a high-tier movement technique manual he had specifically collected, obtaining a skill called "Leaping Sprint." It wasn't a complete movement technique manual, but merely a segment of skill. Based on Chen Fei's understanding, using this technique would temporarily increase his running speed. Afterward, he would feel some fatigue, but there were no other severe side effects.

Chen Fei was overjoyed and integrated this skill into River Cloud Crossing without hesitation. After integrating over a dozen movement techniques, River Cloud Crossing was now exceptionally comprehensive. Integrating Leaping Sprint didn't make River Cloud Crossing an awkward hybrid; instead, it gained a burst secret art. At the same time, its proficiency dropped to Grand Completion (8123/10000). At Chen Fei's current rate of cultivating movement techniques, it would only take him a day or two to cultivate it back to Grand Completion.

"Since River Cloud Crossing integrated over a dozen cultivation methods, it can perfectly accommodate high-tier movement technique secret arts. Then, if my sword technique wants to perfectly integrate a sword move like 'Immortal Pointing the Way,' besides secondary simplification, fully integrating foundational sword techniques is also a path?" A thought involuntarily popped into Chen Fei's mind, but he immediately dismissed it.

Chen Fei picked up his longsword, opened his door, and walked directly into the courtyard, as if he were someone who couldn't sleep at night and had come out to relieve boredom.

"Swoosh!"

Chen Fei's body shifted to the left, a cold glint flashed, and a flying dagger grazed the courtyard wall. Simultaneously, a dark figure leaped from a corner onto the wall, staring coldly at Chen Fei. The black-clad assailant said nothing, their body swaying before vanishing from the spot.

Chen Fei watched the retreating figure. Lately, he had always felt like he was being secretly followed and observed. He initially thought it was someone sent by Sun Shu. But today, this person had hidden within his courtyard, and upon being discovered, immediately made a move. This was clearly not simple surveillance.

Leaping Sprint!

As the qi and blood within his body circulated along a specific path, Chen Fei felt his body suddenly lighten, and his surroundings seemed to slow down. As the breeze ruffled, and tree branches swayed, Chen Fei could clearly see the trajectory of each leaf. The next moment, Chen Fei pushed off his right foot, appearing behind the black-clad assailant in an instant, his longsword already thrusting out.

The black-clad assailant sensed something amiss behind him and instinctively turned his head, only to see the longsword coming. His eyes filled with terror and disbelief—how could Chen Fei be so fast?! The intelligence he had received clearly stated that Chen Fei had only recently broken through to the Skin Refining Realm. And to be cautious, he had even shadowed Chen Fei for several days, confirming his cultivation level and finding no other protectors. That's why he had decided to act today, to kill Chen Fei and conclude the assignment.

The sword light flashed, and the tip of the sword pierced through the black-clad assailant's heart. The assailant looked at Chen Fei in disbelief, slowly falling backward.
