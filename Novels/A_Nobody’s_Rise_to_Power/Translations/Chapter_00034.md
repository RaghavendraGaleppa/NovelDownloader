# Chapter 34: Jing Zhe

Su Chanzhi pondered for a moment before slowly saying, "I brought more than just Nurse Tu, but only Nurse Tu was given to me by the main branch."

The implication was that the other nurses were from her own branch and could be trusted.

She had spent nine months completely capable of controlling the inner residence; there was no problem.

Su Chanzhi spoke while caressing her belly, a maternal tenderness rippling across her face.

The gender of the fetus in her belly was not yet determined, so for the next nine months, she could "hold the hostage to command the lords."

Yang Can nodded; he believed Su Chanzhi had this ability.

The struggle for power in the household was a trial innate to those women born and raised in the boudoir.

Born into silk and brocade, fighting silently, strategizing within a confined space, weaving a survival net with resilience—this was an ability etched into their genes.

The two discussed the matters they might face in the future and the stances they should maintain in public, conversing in detail for a while.

Finally, Yang Can said, "That's all for now. In short, we'll adapt as the situation demands. Perhaps this child will be promising enough to be born a boy, then we can win without lifting a finger."

"I know, hurry back now."

Su Chanzhi didn't want to drive him away; she even wanted Yang Can to hug her gently.

Ah, if he were to grab her ankles and domineeringly throw her onto the bed, that wouldn't be unacceptable either...

But her rationality told her that at least before she fully controlled the inner residence, she had to avoid private contact with Yang Can as much as possible.

Su Chanzhi stood up: "It would be terrible if someone found out, hurry and go."

Su Chanzhi had a slender and graceful figure with an excellent body proportion, and her face was incredibly charming and beautiful.

There is a saying that "beauty is a feast for the eyes," and the face before Yang Can was the kind that would make an anorexic patient regain their appetite upon seeing it.

Yang Can lowered his eyes to look, not just at the face that captivated the world, but also at the snowy jade peaks reaching into the clouds.

Yang Can suddenly felt a stirring of desire. Su Chanzhi immediately sensed his change and warily took a step back.

Su Chanzhi had just developed a mother's consciousness, and the instinct to protect her fetus had rapidly formed.

"Don't act recklessly, it's not possible right now."

Yang Can suddenly let out a strange laugh, because he heard Su Chanzhi say, "Not possible right now."

*Sir, sir, sir, it's not allowed,*
*Sir, sir, sir, where are you,*
*Sir, sir, sir, I miss you!*

It was just like that.

The news that the young mistress of the main branch of the Yu family was pregnant was quietly spread through a rather appropriate method.

The Yu family did not hold a grand celebration for this, because according to ritual propriety, the joy of a new life does not surpass the sorrow of a funeral.

However, the fact that the eldest son of the main branch had an heir was also a very, very significant matter, so it still had to be publicized.

And Yang Can, three days after the news of Su Chanzhi's pregnancy spread, went to see Li Youcai.

The spring sunlight slanted through the carved window lattices, casting mottled light and shadow on the blue brick floor.

Yang Can wore an indigo long shirt today, which made him look even more handsome as jade in the bright spring light.

Young Mistress Wan couldn't help but feel her appetite whetted upon seeing him; this little heartthrob was just too much to her taste.

The thought that Li Youcai was about to leave the manor to inspect the Lingszhou salt ponds and the Heishui iron smelting workshop came to mind. By then...

Young Mistress Wan's eyes shimmered as if about to flow, and her full thighs under her skirt couldn't help but press together.

"What, you said... those account books have all been sorted out? Accountant Li helped you sort them?"

Li Youcai frowned; what was going on with Li Damu? Hadn't he instructed him? How could he...

Yang Can smiled slightly and shook his head: "To be honest with you, Brother, Accountant Li is too busy and hasn't had the time. I sorted out the accounts myself."

Hearing this, Li Youcai immediately breathed a sigh of relief.

With those messy accounts, even finding an old accountant, it would take more than a month to sort them out clearly. And Yang Can had done it in just a few days?

Li Youcai laughed in amazement: "Huoshan, I know you're eager to make a mark as a new official, but don't be in such a hurry."

Li Youcai took a sip of tea and said slowly: "As for new officials, if they don't make a move, that's fine; but if they do, they must be sure of success. Have you really sorted out your accounts clearly?"

Yang Can smiled slightly and took a booklet from his sleeve.

His table format couldn't be seen by others, so after sorting it out clearly, he specifically made a proper account book.

"Brother, please take a look. This is the problem I have sorted out."

Li Youcai took the account book and flipped through it carefully, growing more and more surprised as he read.

He had been an executive for many years and was naturally no stranger to account books.

He could see that Yang Can had truly sorted things out clearly and had indeed found the problems.

Li Youcai hesitated and said: "Huoshan, how do you plan to handle this matter?"

The manors and pastures returned by Yu Huanhu were under Yang Can's responsibility.

If he offended someone because of this, it would be Yang Can offending them; Li Youcai didn't care much about that.

But he was afraid that Yang Can would cause trouble, and then he would have to clean up the mess.

Now that the young mistress has confirmed her pregnancy, the main branch has at least a nine-month period of stability.

He intended to use this time to consolidate his own foundation: the salt ponds and iron smelting.

That way, no matter whether the main branch could stand firm completely after nine months or was to be scattered, he, who had already made preparations, could seize more benefits.

As for his good brother Yang Can, who had long been pushed into the pit...

Yang Can was originally the type used to fill the pit and take the blame; a shovelful of loess would bury him when the time came.

But he discovered that with the young mistress pregnant, this Second Executive seemed to want to struggle a bit?

Yang Can said: "The accounts have been sorted out. I think I should go to those manors and pastures to take a look. It's better to inspect the actual situation."

Li Youcai's heart sank; the thing he was most worried about had finally arrived.

Wouldn't it be better to just wait here quietly to be buried? Why struggle?

Li Youcai's gaze sharpened: "Huoshan, you want to go inspect the manors and pastures?"

Young Mistress Wan, upon hearing this, couldn't help but cast a resentful gaze toward Yang Can.

That old thing was just about to leave the manor; she had thought this was a golden opportunity. How could you also be leaving?

Yang Can nodded: "Yes, I plan to first inspect the three manors closest to Phoenix Manor. Hmm, mainly these three places: Feng'an Manor, Qingyuan Village, and Lupo Ridge."

Li Youcai pondered for a moment and said: "You are in charge of these manors; it is proper to go and inspect them. However, although the stewards of these manors and pastures are all old hands from the second branch, it is currently the critical period for spring plowing. I think, as long as they know the rules and are willing to obey, we should prioritize stability and not make drastic changes."

Yang Can smiled: "Brother is right; I thought the same. Those who need to be warned should be warned, but I didn't intend to overhaul them completely. After all, we are here to share the burden for the Clan Master, not to cause trouble for him. What the Clan Master needs is what we, his retainers, should consider."

Young Mistress Wan curled her lips upon hearing this; she was dissatisfied with Yang Can leaving the manor, so she spoke with a double meaning.

"Is what Uncle said true? Only someone who is truly understanding can go further and longer. But I'm afraid that some people, when it comes to reasoning, are articulate, but when it comes to action, they can't even see the people right in front of them."

Yang Can glanced at Pan Xiaowan.

Pan Xiaowan had her hair done in a fallen horse bun today, and a gold hairpin swayed gently with her娇 laughter. Her beautiful eyes glanced at him with a mix of怨 and嗔, like threads, as if they were about to entangle his soul.

Li Youcai held his teacup and smiled approvingly; he quite agreed with his wife's words: "Hehe, my dear, Huoshan is a smart man; he will know what to do."

He casually praised Yang Can, then added: "Huoshan, if you want to establish authority, you must know how to bestow favors. Show kindness to the obedient and warn those who don't listen well. Using both soft and hard tactics is the way to use people."

"Brother's valuable advice, I will remember it."

Li Youcai nodded: "I am planning to go to Lingszhou and Heishui. Let's leave the manor at slightly different times. Otherwise, it would look like we brothers have discussed it beforehand. I'm afraid the young mistress might have some unfavorable thoughts if she finds out."

"Brother is very thoughtful; let's do as you say." Yang Can smiled brightly.

After all, he had received generous gifts from Steward Zhang; Li Youcai was the type who, after accepting gifts, did help people out.

He wasn't sure if Yang Can really understood his meaning.

Because... Yang Can's bright smile was really unsettling.

That smile was too bright!

That gaze was too clear!

It was just like the donkey in the stable.

Li Youcai had a sudden idea and finally thought of a way to remind Yang Can more explicitly.

He turned to Pan Xiaowan and said: "My dear, when Steward Zhang of Feng'an Manor came to pay respects a few days ago, didn't he give me a pot of nourishing medicinal wine? Later, take half of it and give it to Huoshan."

Madam Pan glanced at Li Youcai's face with the corner of her eye and let out a "tsk": "Husband, this habit of yours of always giving away your things never changes. I think Uncle is very young; this medicinal wine was originally Steward Zhang's heartfelt gift to you. Should we really give it to someone else?"

Li Youcai looked a bit embarrassed: "Ahem, what are you talking about? Who is the outsider? Huoshan is my dearest friend and brother. Besides, is Huoshan young? Am I not getting on in years? Find that bottle of medicinal wine and give it all to Huoshan!"

Li Youcai then turned back to Yang Can and said with a smile: "Huoshan, I'm not saying you're weak, but..." He chuckled twice and winked at Yang Can: "Steward Zhang is an extremely generous and hospitable man. You should take care of your health when you go."

Madam Pan snorted coldly, propped herself up on the small table, and walked gracefully into the bedroom.

It seemed she was a bit angry because her husband was being so generous.

However, her full hips swayed all the way, swaying with only charm, not anger.

Li Youcai said somewhat awkwardly: "Your sister-in-law has been spoiled by me. After all, she's much younger than me and not very sensible. Please don't mind, my good brother."

Yang Can收回 his gaze from that fullness.

*Tsk!* Just like a ripe pod of beans; it seems like if you touched it lightly, it would burst with a "pop." It really looks exciting.

Yang Can smiled slightly at the Great Executive Li: "Brother, rest assured. I think Steward Zhang is also a sensible person. The 'favor' in 'using both soft and hard tactics' would be very well used on him!"
