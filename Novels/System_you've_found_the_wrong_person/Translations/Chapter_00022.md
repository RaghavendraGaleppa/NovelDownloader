# Chapter 22: Why Need a Second Sword to Kill?

The northwest wind howled as it blew across the land.

Wild grass swayed and undulated endlessly under its force.

Long Ying rode atop a pure white stallion—flawless without a single blemish—galloping like the wind, an exceptionally divine and majestic sight. To arrive ahead of time and rescue the three escorts transporting the military payroll, Long Ying had been whipping his beloved horse relentlessly, urging it forward at full speed.

Under normal circumstances, he would never dream of whipping his prized steed—even prolonged galloping would pain his heart. One should never underestimate a fine horse's allure to a man.

But priorities dictated actions. Survival came first now, and cherished possessions had to take a backseat.

However, as he charged toward the battlefield and caught sight of his target from afar, Long Ying realized in an instant that he had acted rashly.

He had witnessed Dou Changsheng's sword strike—the one that had slain the black-robed, emaciated martial artist. The blade's momentum had been fierce, its aura extending a full zhang in length. Even among the Xiantian True Realm, such an attack was formidable.

Given Dou Changsheng's strength, the schemes and tricks he had employed that day were undoubtedly the right choice. There had been no benefit in engaging in a bloody battle with a scion of a great clan—it simply wasn't worth it.

Yet now, Long Ying felt nothing but regret.

Why had he spurred his horse so urgently? Why had he arrived so quickly?

Had he been just a little later, everything would have been settled, and none of this would have concerned him.

Despite his inner turmoil, Long Ying betrayed no emotion on his face. He raised his whip high once more and brought it down hard on his horse's flank. The steed, stung by the pain, surged forward with even greater speed.

Fighting Dou Changsheng to the death simply wasn't worth it.

The military payroll was the priority. Secure it, mount his horse, and leave—that was all he needed to do.

The galloping horse kicked up a storm of dust, its approach impossible to miss from a distance.

Dou Changsheng noticed the reinforcements as well. Recognizing Long Ying, his heart settled slightly.

Even if Long Ying was a Xiantian True Realm expert who had achieved the Five Qi Convergence, Dou Changsheng knew him inside out. Though they had only met recently, Dou Changsheng was no longer the inexperienced novice he once was.

Dou Changsheng felt at ease—and so did the purple-robed man.

"Lord Long Ying is here!" the latter cried out in elation. "He has mastered the Five Qi Convergence—he is a Xiantian True Realm expert!"

"And his arrival is only the beginning. Reinforcements will pour in endlessly after him."

"If I were you, I'd abandon the payroll right now and flee while you still can. That way, you might just keep your life. Otherwise, you'll die under Lord Long Ying's whip, your head severed from your body, your corpse left in pieces."

The purple-robed man gripped his broadsword with both hands but made no move to advance. Instead, he began retreating toward the blue-robed middle-aged man. There was no need to hold the line now—delaying was enough. Soon, Lord Long Ying's strength would ensure these enemies were wiped out.

Even if this young man before them was strong, Lord Long Ying could hold him off.

They were close to Chen Family Fort. Countless reinforcements would arrive, leaving their enemies with only one possible outcome: death.

Dou Changsheng glanced toward Long Ying. The man's horse was fast—already, he had closed the distance from the horizon to within a hundred meters. Forced to act, Dou Changsheng abandoned the purple-robed man and charged straight for the blue-robed middle-aged one.

Killing was secondary. The military payroll was what truly mattered.

By the time Dou Changsheng reached Zhao Manren's side, Long Ying was nearly upon them—barely a dozen meters away. The white stallion's momentum carried it forward, and that short distance vanished in an instant.

Long Ying lashed out with his whip. It coiled through the air like a serpent, its body twisting, its crimson tongue flickering.

The weapon tore through the air with a piercing whistle, each crack like the hiss of a venomous snake, stinging the eardrums and unsettling the body.

*The seven-inch mark—the weak point. Strike there, and the whip's power shatters. Then, the kill is effortless.*

The thought flashed through Dou Changsheng's mind. He also understood that this martial artist's whip technique was serpent-inspired. The seven-inch point was a snake's vital spot—its heart.

And that made it the flaw in his opponent's technique. A single precise strike would dismantle the whip's power.

The whip snaked through the air, infused with boundless Xiantian True Qi. Strands of energy clung to it like scales, reinforcing its might while also serving as a protective layer.

The weapon writhed unpredictably, making it nearly impossible to strike its seven-inch weakness.

But Dou Changsheng could.

The reason was simple: this one sword was eight.

Dou Changsheng swung the Hero's Sword. Its sword aura blazed like a rainbow, indomitable.

Then, in an instant, the single aura split—one became two, two became four, four became eight.

The fourth stance of the *Boundless Sword Art*: **Sword Eight**!

The Boundless Sword Art was a Xiantian True Realm sword technique, its forms deceptively simple. Knowing Dou Changsheng's limited time, the Mu Clan had taught him this straightforward method—one that relied on solid fundamentals for rapid mastery.

The first stance: **Sword One**.  
The second stance: **Sword Two**.  
The third stance: **Sword Four**.  

Each subsequent stance doubled the previous. The technique began simply, but its later forms grew exponentially more complex. Four became eight, eight became sixteen, sixteen became thirty-two. On the surface, it was mere multiplication—but the sheer number of sword auras unleashed was terrifying.

At its peak, a single slash could unleash hundreds of sword auras—an overwhelming, nightmarish assault.

The Boundless Sword Art was easy to learn but difficult to master.

Nine swords were not the limit. Legends spoke of a tenth, even an eleventh stance.

Dou Changsheng had only skimmed the manual a few times, yet he had already grasped the fourth stance—**Sword Eight**.

One after another, the sword auras streaked toward the whip's seven-inch mark. The weapon twisted and writhed, shifting its position, but its movements were no match for the eightfold assault.

Finally, a single concentrated aura struck true. Like a crumbling dam, the Xiantian True Qi shattered instantly.

For a practitioner of Xiantian Internal Qi to breach the defenses of Xiantian True Qi across a whole realm was unthinkable—yet here, it happened. And why not? Dou Changsheng wielded the Hero's Sword, a weapon of peerless sharpness.

Low consumption, high power—these were but secondary traits. The sword's true strength lay in its unmatched edge.

Even channeled through Xiantian Internal Qi, the Hero's Sword's sharpness remained absolute.

The moment the seven-inch mark was struck, the ferocious whip went limp, as if drained of all strength. Seizing the opening, Dou Changsheng swung again.

**Fearless Sword Art**.

This slash blazed like a falling star, its aura stretching a full zhang and two chi.

It crossed several meters in an instant. By the time the sword light faded, Long Ying's head was already soaring through the air.

His headless corpse lashed out instinctively with the whip one last time before blood fountained forth, splattering in all directions. The once-pristine white stallion was drenched crimson on one side, its appearance now that of a demon freshly crawled from hell.

The blue-robed middle-aged man's joy died in his throat. His smile froze. Lord Long Ying—slain in a single stroke?

"How...?" he wailed in despair. "How can he be this strong?!"
