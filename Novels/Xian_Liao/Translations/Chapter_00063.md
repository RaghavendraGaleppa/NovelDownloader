# Chapter 63: Lightning Attraction

The story of Fushan's breakthrough to the Xiantian realm had a profound impact on Zhang Jingxiu. Although historical records mentioned Xiantian masters and some still existed in the world, Zhang had never encountered one in person. This naturally made him skeptical—was the path ahead truly attainable?

Now, Zhou Qing had informed him that Qingfu Temple housed a living Xiantian master. For Zhang, confirming this would be an unimaginable source of motivation.

Seeing Zhang's determination to meet Fushan, Zhou Qing didn't hold back and explained Fushan's current condition in detail.

"So, he truly succeeded in attracting heavenly lightning," Zhang murmured.

Xiao Ruowang, standing nearby, explained to Zhou Qing that Zhang also planned to attempt attracting lightning soon. Fushan's achievement brought Xiao great relief, as it provided a concrete example that might dissuade his master from taking such risks. He earnestly pleaded with Zhou Qing not to refuse Zhang's request.

Zhou Qing found it hard to decline Xiao's plea, especially since the usually accommodating Daoist had rarely asked for favors. Besides, Zhou had no intention of refusing in the first place. However, he warned that Fushan's mental state was unstable, and interactions with outsiders could lead to unpredictable and potentially dangerous outcomes. Even though Zhou's Soul Calming technique could influence Fushan and trigger some ingrained memories, the risk remained.

Zhang, fully aware of the dangers, solemnly declared, "Scholar Zhou, as the saying goes, 'Hearing the Dao in the morning, one could die content in the evening.' If I can see the path ahead, death would hold no regrets."

Attempting to attract heavenly lightning was akin to a suicide mission. Having a living Xiantian master to observe would provide invaluable insights, increasing his chances of success. No amount of written descriptions could compare to witnessing the real thing.

At Qingfu Temple, Fushan was surprised to see Zhou Qing return with another elderly Daoist in tow.

"Daoist Fushan, it's been many years," Zhang greeted him. Decades ago, during his youth, Zhang had met Fushan when the latter was still a young disciple, barely noticeable beside his senior.

"Who might you be?" Fushan had long forgotten their brief encounter, as Zhang had been merely a disciple of Taihe Mountain back then, less prominent than even Xiao Ruowang had been during his earlier visit to Qingfu Temple.

"Zhang Jingxiu of Taihe Mountain."

"What?" Fushan's eyes widened in alarm, wondering if the elder had come to challenge the temple. Then he relaxed—he was no longer the abbot, after all.

"Senior Brother! Great Senior Brother!"

A disheveled old Daoist suddenly appeared, his movements so swift that even Zhang couldn't discern how he had arrived. An overwhelming pressure emanated from him, causing Zhang's hair to stand on end. Determined to test the elder's strength, Zhang deliberately provoked a hint of hostility.

Danger surged.

Boom!

Their fists collided like two grinding stones, sending sparks flying as Zhang's cloth shoes scraped against the stone floor, tearing apart. The impact left fine cracks in the ground, dust swirling in the air. In the blink of an eye, they exchanged three fierce blows. Zhou Qing could hear the faint cracking of Zhang's knuckles, yet the elder managed to withstand the onslaught—a feat Zhou doubted he could replicate at his current level.

Zhang's explosive power was astonishing. Still, Zhou remained confident that he would reach such heights in time, as his Five Organs Thunder Resonance was still incomplete, and his body had yet to fully mature.

Zhang's sleeves shredded as his muscles twisted with exertion. Finally, he was sent flying back over ten feet. Zhou quickly intervened with a tiger's roar using his Soul Calming technique, halting the deranged elder's pursuit. Relieved, Zhou explained, "Senior Brother, Abbot Zhang has come to visit you."

Fushan realized the misunderstanding—or rather, the lack thereof. It was simply a demonstration of the gap between Zhang and their senior brother. Zhang hadn't lasted ten moves, just like Fushan himself. The former abbot of Qingfu Temple felt a smug satisfaction—he and the Taihe Sect's leader were evenly matched.

Zhang exhaled, his arms numb but his spirits high. "What a magnificent Great Smashing Stance—truly the most formidable palm technique in the world."

Back at his courtyard, Zhou Qing cultivated under the great mulberry tree, its yin energy balancing his yang-infused thunder resonance. The tree thrived from his presence, its leaves flourishing while emitting an increasingly potent chill. Even in summer, the courtyard remained refreshingly cool.

Hu the Butcher, who periodically reported to Zhou, marveled at the tree's mystical aura, believing it blessed the scholar with fortune. He always paid his respects to the tree before conducting business.

One day, Fushan visited Zhou's home. "Junior Brother, Zhang and I have decided—we must attempt to attract heavenly lightning. Otherwise, breaking through to Xiantian is impossible."

"Are you certain?" Zhou asked, concerned.

Fushan sighed. "What other choice do we have? We can only hope for a minor lightning strike to aid our breakthrough. Though Zhang stands a far better chance than I."

"A minor lightning strike?" Zhou's mind raced until inspiration struck. "Senior Brother, perhaps I can help you harness a weaker form of lightning."

"How?" Fushan gasped.

"Have you heard of the Kui Niu, the thunder beast? It generates lightning. Though not as potent as heavenly lightning, the essence is the same. I may be able to create a device that mimics its ability."

Later, Zhou questioned Zhang's willingness to share his sect's secrets. "Abbot Zhang, though I vow never to disclose your techniques, why trust me so readily? Is it solely because of my senior brother's breakthrough?"

Zhang pondered before replying, "Scholar Zhou, what have you witnessed on your travels between Taihe Mountain and Qingfu Temple?"

"Banditry, famine, plague. The northern provinces are nearing devastation. Without a savior, chaos is inevitable."

"Precisely. History shows that in such times, without a destined leader, turmoil is unstoppable. The Emperor is aged, the Crown Prince weak. My disciple Ruowang is kind-hearted but lacks decisiveness. You, however, are a true scholar of ancient virtue—righteous yet ruthless when necessary. Should Ruowang face adversity in the future, I hope you'll aid him."

Their bond was that of father and son, and Zhang sought to secure his disciple's future. Zhou wondered why the ailing young master of Qinghe Palace wasn't sent to Taihe Mountain for blessings but kept the question to himself. Some secrets were better left untouched.

Zhang admired Zhou's principled nature—his ability to distinguish gratitude from grievance. If he couldn't break through to Xiantian, Zhou would be a reliable ally for Xiao. In fact, Zhang believed Zhou would make an excellent Taihe Sect leader, were he not already a lay disciple of Qingfu Temple and a provincial scholar.

He lamented the downfall of the Tang family's prodigy, whose arrogance had led to ruin. Unlike Zhou, who navigated dangers with wisdom, the Tang heir now feigned madness to survive. Only the retired Minister Shang could possibly salvage his fate.

The next day, Zhou returned to his courtyard. Fushan had discerned the deranged elder's pattern—he recited scriptures every five days, just as he had during his tenure as abbot. Zhou only needed to visit the temple accordingly.

Zhang, having provoked Fushan's attack intentionally, now knew to avoid hostility. With Fushan present, the elder remained calmer. Zhang also possessed secret Taihe techniques that allowed him to escape if necessary. He stayed at Qingfu Temple to study the elder's thunderous chants, hoping to unravel the mysteries of the Xiantian realm.

Zhou, meanwhile, sought the great mulberry tree's yin energy to balance his thunder resonance. "Brother Mulberry, let us support each other and progress together," he said with a bow.

The tree's leaves rustled, less in joy and more in trepidation—whenever Zhou bowed, it rarely boded well. Yet it eagerly awaited the scholar's next offering of elixirs.

Beneath the tree, Zhou practiced his thunder resonance. His yang energy infused the tree, which in return channeled cooling yin energy back into him. This symbiotic exchange accelerated his progress, particularly in the Deer Play segment of his training. Though slower than listening to Fushan's thunderous chants, it was a steady, sustainable method.

As summer approached, the courtyard remained an oasis of coolness. The mulberry tree flourished, its yin energy intensifying with the heat. Hu the Butcher, visiting periodically, regarded the tree with reverence, convinced of its divine protection over Zhou's fortunes. Each time, he paid his respects to the ancient tree before conducting his business.
