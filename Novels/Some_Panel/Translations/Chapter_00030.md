# Chapter 30: Qi Condensation Ninth Layer, Demonic Core Pills

Splash!

The sea parted as Yang Ji burst out.

Seeing the familiar figure, Huoyuan, who had been pacing back and forth on the large ship, lit up with joy and rushed forward to greet him.

"Master, you're finally back."

Yang Ji smiled at the sight, treading on clear wind, and slowly landed on the ship.

"Where are they?" he asked, looking around.

"Chen De and Chang Lin were the first to come up and also the first to leave. After that, Xu Xiangsong and four others rushed up, waiting here with grim expressions for a while. After I paid them half of the spirit stones, they also left without a word," Huoyuan explained.

"Master, did you manage to get the Emberflame Beast?" he asked in a low voice.

"It fell into Chang Lin's hands," Yang Ji said, shaking his head and looking to the side.

"I knew there was something off about that Chang Lin. I didn't expect him to be so despicable as to snatch someone's opportunity!" Huoyuan said, quite annoyed. "It must have been Chen De's doing. Damn them!"

"It's just that my strength wasn't enough," Yang Ji said calmly, then his tone turned slightly cold. "If given the chance, what he took today, I will make him repay tenfold in the future."

"Although I lost the Emberflame Beast fire, I also gained something. I refined a wisp of Earth Fire down there, just like the one behind Wanbao Tower. From now on, I won't go to the back mountain cave to occupy the Earth Fire. You can practice well on your own."

Yang Ji spun a pretext for Huoyuan.

"It's always good to have gained something. Congratulations, Master," Huoyuan said, cupping his hands and smiling.

"All the benefits were taken by others, so I can't really smile at your congratulations," Yang Ji said with a bitter laugh, his expression unchanging. "Let's go, we're heading back!"

A day later, Yang Ji and Huoyuan returned to Wanbao Tower by boat.

This time, apart from not obtaining the Emberflame Beast fire, they did recover a good number of Flame Serpent corpses. The materials and demonic cores sold for a total of eighty thousand spirit stones, a truly considerable harvest. This was arguably the only good thing Chang Lin had done.

Yang Ji converted all of it into spirit stones, then spoke with Jin Dafu about the ship escorting duty. He intended to decline the work. In the past two years, he had been out at sea no less than ten times, which was certainly fair to Jin Dafu. Now that he had obtained the Earth Spirit Fire, he decided to no longer go out to sea and instead dedicate himself to cultivation.

Jin Dafu thought for a moment and nodded in agreement. Although their connection through ship escorting was gone, their pill refining transactions would continue. This was a substantial source of income that Yang Ji wouldn't let go of, and Jin Dafu certainly didn't want to miss out on having him as a peak alchemist.

Aside from his dealings with Jin Dafu, Yang Ji also asked Huoyuan to help him keep an eye out for high-grade spiritual herbs in other shops. Huoyuan was a well-known peak alchemist throughout Nanfeng Island, so if any high-grade spiritual herbs were for sale, other shops would likely be happy to trade with him.

After completing these matters, Yang Ji finally returned to the foot of Green Mountain, south of the city.

Inside the wooden house, Yang Ji swept his storage bag and took out a Flame Fruit. The spiritual fruit was fist-sized, like a red ruby, with intricate patterns inside and a red glow emanating from its surface, resembling burning crimson flames. The Flame Fruit appeared extraordinary at first glance. Yang Ji took one look and swallowed it whole.

Once the spiritual fruit was consumed, the immense medicinal power it contained immediately dispersed, and its cultivation effect was immeasurably better than that of a Spirit Splendor Pill. Yang Ji felt a surge of joy, but at present, he didn't sit down to cultivate with full effort. Instead, he allowed the spiritual energy vortex to refine and absorb it, while he swept his storage bag and took out his pill cauldron.

With the Earth Spirit Fire, his first thought was to refine Spirit Origin Pills. As he spread his palm, the Earth Spirit Fire shot forth. Because the Earth Spirit Fire regarded him as its progenitor, he could summon it at will, controlling the heat with absolute precision. Previously, when using Earth Fire, he had to adjust the flame size through a hidden opening at the bottom of the cauldron, but now such complex operations were unnecessary.

The Earth Spirit Fire hissed from his fingertips into the cauldron. Once the cauldron was properly heated, Yang Ji poured out the Spirit Origin Fruit liquid that he had previously stored in a vessel and hadn't fully melted. The spiritual fire coiled around it, enveloping and melting it. The fruit liquid sizzled and instantly boiled. The evaporating medicinal liquid tried to escape, but it was entirely intercepted by the spiritual fire. Meanwhile, the useless impurities were completely incinerated into ash under the high temperature. With a flick of the spiritual fire, it shook them off, letting them fall to the bottom of the cauldron.

Yang Ji saw it clearly and understood why it was said that only spiritual fire melting could preserve the full medicinal power of spiritual herbs: because any medicinal power that tried to evaporate would be swept back down by the spiritual energy within the spiritual fire. Earth Fire, on the other hand, contained less spiritual energy, so it couldn't preserve all of the medicinal power. Precisely because of its lesser spiritual energy, it couldn't fully unleash the spiritual herb's entire potency.

One batch of Spirit Origin Fruit liquid was quickly refined. While joyful, Yang Ji couldn't help but marvel at the power of the Earth Spirit Fire. He quickly followed suit, controlling the size of the spiritual fire, and melted all the other ingredients for the Spirit Origin Pills, one by one. The Spirit Origin Pill involved a step where two medicinal liquids were fused together. However, with the aid of his golden finger, this was no problem, and the fusion was quickly completed. Next, all the medicinal liquids began to merge. Then came solidification, pill separation, pill rotation, nurturing, and finally, pill formation.

After several consecutive steps were skillfully executed, a batch of Spirit Origin Pills was finally complete. Yang Ji patted the pill cauldron, and a surge of medicinal qi, far more potent and concentrated than that of the Spirit Splendor Pills, rushed out. He reached out and, with a swirl of spiritual energy, ten pale yellow pills landed in his palm. Yang Ji held them in his hand and felt the powerful medicinal energy contained within, knowing immediately that these Spirit Origin Pills were three times more effective than Spirit Splendor Pills. In other words, one pill could sustain his cultivation for about three days, providing him with roughly 15 cultivation points per day.

However, this was still far inferior to the Flame Fruit. The Flame Fruit was currently being refined within his body, and he could feel the immense and pure medicinal power, which could provide him with roughly 50 cultivation points per day. But the medicinal power contained in a single Flame Fruit was ultimately limited, capable of sustaining his cultivation for about five days. This meant that the five Flame Fruits he obtained could collectively sustain his cultivation for twenty-five days, providing him with 1250 cultivation points. Such a cultivation speed truly delighted him. If he could continuously consume Flame Fruits, he would reach the tenth layer of Qi Condensation in just a few years. However, such spiritual fruits were rare and difficult to come by. Who wouldn't keep them for themselves if they obtained one? Even high-grade pills were rare on the market, let alone such spiritual fruits.

Yang Ji entertained beautiful fantasies, but they remained just that—fantasies. His thoughts returned to reality, and he resumed pill refining. He refined all forty portions of Spirit Origin Pill ingredients into pills within two days. With the pills ready, he began to cultivate with peace of mind.

Cultivation knew no time. Spring departed, autumn arrived; spring departed, and autumn arrived again. Time flew by. Amidst swirling fallen leaves, three years passed in a flash.

In three years, Yang Ji had refined and absorbed all five Flame Fruits and four hundred Spirit Origin Pills. Now, his spiritual energy was robust, and his cultivation had reached the early stage of the Ninth Layer of Qi Condensation.

[Name: Yang Ji]
[Root Bone: Inferior]
[Lifespan: 24/100]
[Realm: Qi Condensation Ninth Layer (500/25600)]
[Cultivation Method: Water-Rippling Art]
[Techniques: Water-Following Sword Art (Proficient), Light Body Technique (Proficient)]

His age had reached twenty-four. In other words, more than six years had passed since he emerged from Luo Xiong's cave. With less than four years remaining, it would once again be time for the three major sects to recruit outer disciples. If he had a sufficient supply of Spirit Origin Pills and managed to acquire some spiritual fruits like Flame Fruits within these four years, he would absolutely be able to reach the tenth layer of Qi Condensation.

Hope was within reach! Yang Ji's mood at this moment was quite pleasant. Sensing the robust spiritual energy within his body, he realized that, without knowing it, he had grown to this extent. If he were to go out, among the numerous rogue cultivators, there would likely be few with higher cultivation than his. This was because rogue cultivators generally had inferior root bones, and for those with inferior root bones to cultivate with such an ample supply of high-grade pills, like him, was almost impossible. In other words, among rogue cultivators, only some elderly cultivators might have higher cultivation than him.

Reaching such a cultivation level at this age was largely thanks to his extraordinary alchemy talent. It truly was a case of making up for insufficient root bones with resources. He believed that if he continued to have an ample supply of pills for cultivation, even those with average or superior root bones would probably only be on par with him. Only now did he realize how wise it was to choose to become an alchemist back then.

Super alchemy talent + inferior root bone = supreme root bone. This equation held true at this moment! Of course, all of this required a prerequisite: a sufficient supply of high-grade spiritual herbs for him to refine into pills. Otherwise, it was all for naught.

Yang Ji smiled faintly. After thoroughly sensing the increased spiritual energy within his body, he slowly stood up. His pills were all used up. He prepared to go to Wanbao Tower to see if Jin Dafu had collected more high-grade spiritual herbs for him over the years. Only by possessing high-grade spiritual herbs could he be linked to a supreme root bone. This link must not be broken.

But things rarely go as planned; there are too many things in this world that often turn out unsatisfactorily. Now at Wanbao Tower, Yang Ji looked at the ten portions of Spirit Origin Pill ingredients before him and couldn't help but frown deeply.

"Elder Jin, in three years, you've only collected ten portions of ingredients? Are you not even bothering to earn spirit stones anymore?" He didn't mean to blame, but there was considerable disappointment in his heart.

"Hey, what are you saying? Who wouldn't want to earn spirit stones? I wanted to get more from you, but it just won't let me!" Jin Dafu spread his hands helplessly.

"Cough, cough, Master, I only managed to collect three portions from other shops. That's even worse than Shopkeeper Jin," Huoyuan said awkwardly from the side, presenting the three portions of ingredients in his hand.

In three years, only thirteen portions had been collected. This was simply not enough. Yang Ji was truly plunged into worry. If he had sufficient pills, he could reach the tenth layer of Qi Condensation in the remaining four years, but now...

"Little Brother Yang," Jin Dafu consoled, "cultivation isn't something achieved overnight, and neither is alchemy. Who doesn't spend decades accumulating knowledge? You've only been at it for a few years. Don't expect to become a grandmaster alchemist so quickly."

"You're not anxious, but I am," Yang Ji sighed softly in his heart. He had concealed his cultivation at this moment, so Jin Dafu couldn't detect it at all and thought he was buying spiritual herbs for extensive practice, aiming to become a grandmaster alchemist. Little did he know, Yang Ji was buying them for cultivation.

"Master, these high-grade spiritual herbs are indeed excellent cultivation resources, and difficult to find. However, have you heard of Demonic Core Pills?" Huoyuan suddenly asked.

"Demonic Core Pills?" Yang Ji was startled. He really hadn't heard of them.

At this moment, Jin Dafu chuckled, "The main ingredient for refining Demonic Core Pills is a demonic core. It requires powerful beast fire and spiritual fire to refine them. You only have Earth Fire, which doesn't meet the refining requirements at all."

A pill with a demonic core as the main ingredient? Yang Ji's heart stirred. Ignoring Jin Dafu, he looked at Huoyuan and repeatedly asked, "Are these Demonic Core Pills also for advancing cultivation?"

"Yes, they are also pills that enhance cultivation. However, very few can refine them. Only alchemists who have refined powerful beast fires and spiritual fires can. Such alchemists all come from the three major sects and some larger cultivation families. The reason the three major sects can dominate the Thousand Island Sea Region is partly due to these Demonic Core Pills. Such cultivation-benefiting pills are never circulated outside the sects, so few people know about them," Huoyuan slowly explained.

Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump! Hearing these words, Yang Ji could almost hear his own strong, excited heartbeat at that moment.

At this moment, Demonic Core Pills were linked to hope!
