# Chapter 709: So This Is How He Dies?

Above the Sea of Bitterness, where gray mist churned violently, three auras intertwined like venomous snakes.

True Monarch Tongxuan’s Sword Soul tore through the dead space, while the True Monarch with white hair locked down the path of retreat with his chilling divine sense. Far away, deep within the White Bone Island, two scarlet, blood-moon-like pupils of the Flood Dragon had fully opened. The dragon’s might, mixed with the chilling Dao rhythm of the Taiyin Dao Fruit, pressed down upon the entire Blood Sea, causing spiderweb-like cracks to spread across its surface.

"Xu Yunfan, are you looking to die faster by getting distracted at a time like this?"

True Monarch Tongxuan sneered. Nine玄冰 (mystic ice) Sword Souls trembled and hummed before him, the Xuan Shu Sword Intent slicing through the surrounding dead energy, causing it to hiss and disperse. The sword body formed from his soul was slightly unstable due to him severing his own cultivation, but the edge honed by hatred burned even brighter.

Xu Yunfan controlled his clone, Sun Wukong. His molten golden eyes swept over the white-haired True Monarch, but he didn't respond to True Monarch Tongxuan immediately. Instead, he stared intently at the white-haired True Monarch.

"A coward who hides his head and tucks away his tail—how dare you covet the Dao Fruit?"

The white-haired True Monarch’s gray robe stirred without wind, his hoarse voice laced with mockery.

"Death is upon you; stubbornness is not a wise choice."

He wasn't afraid of Xu Yunfan, but he was wary of the Starry Banner that had abruptly appeared in Xu Yunfan's hand. The Sea of Bitterness of Samsara isolated all laws; even a Spirit Treasure’s power was barely thirty percent of its usual strength. Yet Xu Yunfan was able to summon his Lifebound Spirit Treasure. This method far exceeded expectations, which was why he hadn't made a move immediately.

"Enough noise!"

True Monarch Tongxuan’s killing intent surged. He had waited for this moment for too long—the humiliation of the Boundary Sea, the grudge of the Cave Heaven—today, he would wash it all away with his sword.

"天玑殒，剑魄燃! (Tianji Perishes, Sword Soul Burns!)"

With a fierce shout, the nine Sword Souls suddenly collapsed and merged into one, transforming into a gray, massive blade that spanned the Sea of Bitterness. This strike exceeded the limits of the early Golden Core stage. Before the Sword Intent even arrived, the stone body of Sun Wukong began to crack with fine fissures.

"周天星斗，镇! (Celestial Stars, Suppress!)"

Xu Yunfan showed no fear, wielding the Starry Banner with force. The 365 main stars on the banner surface lit up one after another. Massive starlight pierced through the barriers of the Sea of Bitterness and poured down. Though weakened by nearly seventy percent due to the laws of Samsara, it still formed a starry vortex to meet the blade.

"Boom!!!"

Starlight and Sword Soul collided. The dead silence of the Sea of Bitterness erupted with a deafening roar for the first time. The blood waves were evaporated into a ten-thousand-zhang void, and the gray mist rolled back like a tide.

True Monarch Tongxuan’s blade suddenly stalled. The starlight gnawed at his Sword Soul like a parasite stuck to bone, emitting a grating "hiss."

"Impossible!"

True Monarch Tongxuan’s soul trembled violently. His sword, fueled by burning a Spirit Treasure, was actually being held back head-on.

"Under the suppression of Samsara, your ten percent of strength is barely three," Xu Yunfan’s voice came through the Starry Banner, cold as eternal ancient ice. "But I... am ten percent."

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but glance at the attribute panel in his vision.

**[Divine Thunder Dao Fruit (Early Golden Core)]**
**Status:** Peak (Cross-Realm Transmission in Progress)
**Output Efficiency:** 100% (Attribute Panel exempts Sea of Bitterness suppression)**

True Monarch Tongxuan dared to use his own soul to condense his Sword Intent and enter the Sea of Bitterness of Samsara. His fate was already sealed.

The white-haired True Monarch’s pupils constricted.

"Roar!!!"

The roar of the Flood Dragon interrupted the stalemate. The White Bone Island completely shattered, and a thousand-zhang-long skeletal dragon burst out of the sea. Its body was stacked from billions of枯骨 (dry bones), its eye sockets filled with blood-red flames that reached the sky, and its claws were entwined with purple-black lightning from the Sea of Bitterness.

It was the Sea of Bitterness Flood Dragon born alongside the Taiyin Mingqiu Dao Fruit. Its pressure reached the early Golden Core stage. Before its claws arrived, the reef beneath Sun Wukong’s feet had already turned to dust.

"Ants, do you think you can take the Dao Fruit?"

The Flood Dragon’s blood-red eyes locked onto the three, speaking the human tongue. It possessed high intelligence and knew well that the Dao Fruit was the focal point of the deadly struggle between the three parties.

The white-haired True Monarch suddenly moved. His figure merged into the gray mist like a ghost. When he reappeared, he was above the Flood Dragon’s back. His枯瘦 (withered) hand grabbed at the逆鳞 (inverse scale) on the dragon's neck, the very spot where the Taiyin Mingqiu Dao Fruit was attached!

"幽泉噬魂! (Dark Spring Devours the Soul!)"

Countless chains of resentful souls shot out from his sleeves. The ends of the chains actually manifested twisted Samsara runes, tearing through the Flood Dragon’s protective dead energy.

"Seeking death!"

The Flood Dragon roared in anger, its tail sweeping across with a surge of blood waves. However, the white-haired True Monarch retreated like a paper kite, using the force to pull the chains back, actually tearing off a piece of bone scale.

The clear radiance of the Dao Fruit trembled slightly.

Reversing life and death required profound mastery of Samsara. Xu Yunfan hadn't read those classics for nothing over the years; this method indeed matched the characteristics of a traitor from the Primordial Origin Sect. There was indeed a record of the Nine Nether True Monarch betraying the sect ten thousand years ago.

At this moment, how could True Monarch Tongxuan allow someone else to lay their hands on it?

His Sword Soul forcibly shook off the entanglement of the starlight, and three strands of dividing sword threads shot straight toward the back of the white-haired True Monarch’s heart.

"Get lost!"

The white-haired True Monarch slapped back, sending out a gray-white palm print. Samsara runes circulated within the palm print, actually grinding the sword threads into nothingness. But this delay allowed the Flood Dragon’s claw to tear through space and strike down.

The three-way chaotic battle erupted instantly.

The Starry Banner rolled, forming a river of stars to protect Sun Wukong. Xu Yunfan’s voice sounded within the clone’s Sea of Consciousness.

"The Flood Dragon’s inverse scale is the hub of the Dao Fruit, and also its fatal weakness. However, Tongxuan’s Sword Soul is about to collapse. Kill him first."

True Monarch Tongxuan had also reached his limit. Severing his own cultivation to enter the Sea of Bitterness meant his foundation was unstable to begin with, and burning the Spirit Treasure for a fierce attack had further exhausted his soul. Now, the starlight was eroding him like a tide, and his Sword Soul showed signs of shattering. Blinded by the calamity qi, he didn't think of escaping and was intent only on killing Xu Yunfan.

"Xu Yunfan! Even if my soul is shattered and body destroyed, I will drag you into Samsara!"

True Monarch Tongxuan went completely mad. The Sword Soul blade exploded with a bang, transforming into billions of ice crystal sword rains, covering the entire Blood Sea indiscriminately.

This was the ultimate killing move of the Xuan Shu Sword Soul, "Myriad Souls Return to the Void." Every ice crystal contained the Sword Intent of destruction. The blood waves froze upon contact, and the gray mist shattered upon meeting it.

"Lin! (Presence!)"

Xu Yunfan activated the Nine Words True Seal. Controlling the Sun Wukong clone, he instantly entered a state of absolute rationality, entering a mental flow of "Tai Shang Wang Qing" (The Supreme Void). The Starry Banner spun wildly, the main stars on the banner surface exploding one after another, transforming into a miniature star domain to protect his surroundings.

The sword rain struck the star domain, stirring up a sky full of light fragments.

"Ugh!"

The white-haired True Monarch was caught off guard, pierced by three sword rains. His gray robe was stained with blood, and the circulation of his Samsara secret technique slowed slightly.

The Flood Dragon was focused on heavily, its body blown open with dozens of holes, bone fragments flying everywhere. It roared in fury, spewing the Sea of Bitterness origin it had accumulated for a long time from its mouth. A紫黑 (purple-black) lightning that annihilated life force struck straight down at True Monarch Tongxuan.

"Now!"

Xu Yunfan’s eyes flashed with brilliance. The Starry Banner abruptly turned, not to defend, but to pour all remaining starlight into Sun Wukong’s right fist. The stone body of Sun Wukong bloomed with molten gold brilliance, and the shadows of eight layers of Yunji Dao Scenery appeared behind him.

This punch ignored spatial distance, striking fiercely into the core of True Monarch Tongxuan’s Sword Soul, which was on the verge of shattering.

"Crack!"

The Sword Soul shattered like glass. True Monarch Tongxuan’s soul let out a piercing shriek.

"Xu Yunfan..."

Before he could finish, the Flood Dragon’s purple-black lightning had already submerged his remaining soul.

True Monarch Tongxuan of the Tianji Xuan Shu Sword Soul, soul and body destroyed in the Sea of Bitterness.

So this is how he dies?!

Taking advantage of the moment the white-haired True Monarch’s mind was distracted, Xu Yunfan detonated his final trump card!

"Banner, Offer!"

The Starry Banner exploded with a bang. Countless star fragments, carrying the embers of the Chiyang (Scarlet Sun) Dao Fruit, turned into a rain of fire that blazed the sky, rushing toward the Flood Dragon’s inverse scale. This strike was not just to injure the enemy, but also to use the explosion to disrupt the area.

Within the Sun Wukong clone, a point of indestructible golden nature suddenly ignited. Xu Yunfan’s main body, separated by the barrier of the Sea of Bitterness, poured all his Divine Thunder power into it from afar.
