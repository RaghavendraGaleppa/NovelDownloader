# Chapter 111: The Mysterious Helmsman

The Crown Princess of Yunhai Kingdom knelt before a eunuch—a sight that shocked Xiao Ji, who was hiding in a concealed corner of the princess's residence. 

Soon, he understood the reason. 

The Crown Princess was actually a member of the Gate of Life and Death. This organization was not only shrouded in mystery but also immensely powerful. 

The eunuch turned out to be the mastermind behind the hunt for Young Master Wuyou in Redcloud City. 

His identity as a eunuch was merely a disguise—his true status was that of a helmsman overseeing one of the Gate of Life and Death's branches. His position was neither low nor insignificant in authority; otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to command such an operation.
