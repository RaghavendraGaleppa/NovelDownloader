# Chapter 145: Soul-Stabilizing Pearl, Breakthrough to Perfection

Upon hearing Chu Ning's agreement, Jiang Hongguang was overjoyed.

At his fervent invitation, Chu Ning stayed as a guest in his immortal's cave for another half-day before departing Flying Rainbow Island.

Jiang Hongguang and the others, with Chu Ning's addition, temporarily decided not to go to Thousand Illusions Island.

The two parties arranged to meet at the Thousand Illusions Island dao arena ten days later.

After Chu Ning left, Jiang Lan immediately spoke:

"Brother, this Chu Ning, although his cultivation appears to be at the eighth level of Qi Condensation, looks a few years younger than me. I wonder if he's truly capable. Is inviting him to join us really useful?"

Jiang Hongguang glared at Jiang Lan upon hearing this. "How many times have I told you not to judge a book by its cover? I see that while Daoist Chu is young, his disposition is quite steady. I believe he has experienced much. He's not like you, who has been confined to an island cultivating since childhood."

Hearing Jiang Hongguang's words, Jiang Lan said with some resentment, "Hmph, who are you looking down on? When someone really comes to challenge us, who knows who will be more formidable?"

Listening to Jiang Lan, Jiang Hongguang helplessly shook his head.

It was Yu Yuanxiu, standing nearby, who chimed in, "Xiao Lan, your brother invited Daoist Chu to join us as a precaution. Daoist Chu is, after all, only young and already at the eighth level of Qi Condensation. Having him here will be an invisible deterrent to others who might want to challenge us. This is much more effective than having just one more cultivator at the seventh level of Qi Condensation."

Jiang Hongguang smiled upon hearing this. "See? Your sister-in-law understands me. I'm also planning ahead. However, the news of our second-tier spirit vein has been kept very confidential. Logically, no one outside should know. I hope no one jumps out to interfere in the end. That way, we can cultivate here peacefully for a few more years."

...

As the three on Flying Rainbow Island discussed, Chu Ning had already returned to Thousand Illusions Island.

Since he had found an island to join, Chu Ning naturally didn't need to go to the dao arena anymore. Instead, he continued heading towards the gathering place for rogue cultivators.

The Thousand Islands Competition was about to begin, and recently, the atmosphere here was noticeably livelier, with many more people buying and selling. Chu Ning, of course, wouldn't miss such an opportunity to earn spirit stones. He even took out two mid-grade low-tier talismans, and one was quickly bought. However, the other temporarily remained unsold.

By noon, Chu Ning packed up his stall, ready to return directly to his stone chamber at the inn.

After a few steps, Chu Ning's gaze suddenly fell upon an item at a rogue cultivator's stall: a dark, black bead.

"A Soul-Stabilizing Pearl?" A hint of surprise flashed in Chu Ning's eyes. He quickly composed his expression and casually walked up to the stall.

Behind the stall stood a tall, thin cultivator, around thirty years of age. Seeing Chu Ning approach, he offered no greeting, letting Chu Ning look at his leisure.

Chu Ning picked up two or three magic tools with interest, all mid-grade. After asking for the prices, he shook his head and put them down. Perhaps because there were many rogue cultivators here, or because there were no major sects, the mid-grade magic tools sold here were priced at seven or eight hundred spirit stones, much more expensive than the ones Chu Ning bought near Qingxia Mountain Range.

It was then that he picked up the dark, black bead with some curiosity.

The feel of it in his hand was very familiar to Chu Ning. He then swept it with his divine sense and immediately had a rough idea. This bead was, astonishingly, identical to the Soul-Stabilizing Pearl he had bought for ten thousand low-grade spirit stones back in Fengxia Market. Recalling the introduction given by the female cultivator surnamed Zhang back then, this bead should be part of a larger magic tool.

Chu Ning then casually asked, "Daoist, what is this bead used for?"

"I don't know!" The tall, thin cultivator, clearly impatient after Chu Ning had inquired about several magic tools without buying any, replied. "I got it inadvertently from someone else; I haven't found any special use for it."

Chu Ning secretly smiled. To use this bead, one must be able to project their divine sense outwards. An ordinary Qi Condensation cultivator like him naturally wouldn't discover its mysteries.

"Then, how many spirit stones for this bead?" Chu Ning asked.

"Ten spirit stones. Take it if you want it."

The tall, thin man's next words caused Chu Ning's mouth to drop open.

The tall, thin man, seeing Chu Ning's expression, thought Chu Ning found the price too high. Frowning slightly, he continued, "Although this bead isn't very useful, its quality is good; it's very hard. It's not bad for decoration. Ten spirit stones isn't very expensive. How about this, if you want it, eight spirit stones will do."

Hearing this, Chu Ning secretly thought he had struck gold. Yet, at this moment, he still hesitated, saying, "Is that so? Eight spirit stones, alright then."

With that, Chu Ning directly placed the bead into his storage bag, then handed eight spirit stones to the other party. After thinking for a moment, Chu Ning added another question:

"Daoist, do you have any more of these beads? If I want to use them for decoration, a pair would be better."

"No more," the tall, thin cultivator quickly took the spirit stones, as if afraid Chu Ning would go back on his word.

Chu Ning said nothing more upon hearing this, turning and leaving.

As Chu Ning walked away, the tall, thin cultivator's face revealed a delighted smile, and he softly muttered, "I never thought a bead I casually found by the lake on Water Cloud Island could sell for eight spirit stones. I should have looked around more carefully back then to see if there were more of these beads."

Chu Ning, who had already walked some distance, did not stop. He was secretly pondering. "Water Cloud Island!" With his current divine sense strength, he naturally heard every word the tall, thin cultivator said.

Chu Ning committed this to memory, then returned to his stone chamber at the inn with a normal expression.

He did not immediately begin cultivating. In his hand, Chu Ning now held a jade slip. It was the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art cultivation method he had brought from the sect.

"The peak of the ninth level of Qi Condensation has been refined over the past three months, coupled with nearly twenty days of consolidation since arriving here. My previous issue of an unstable realm due to excessive use of elixirs has completely disappeared. It's time to break through to Qi Condensation Perfection!"

In fact, Chu Ning had long since memorized the cultivation method within this jade slip, but he still took it out to review it once more. He not only carefully read the cultivation method for the Qi Condensation Perfection realm but also the Foundation Establishment method that followed. After all, the Qi Condensation Perfection realm is essentially preparation for subsequent Foundation Establishment.

To establish one's foundation, cultivators actually need to meet several conditions. First, a strong physique. If one has severe injuries, qi and blood deficiency, or insufficient vital essence, it is difficult to establish a foundation. Therefore, the older a cultivator is, the harder it becomes to establish a foundation. Generally, if a cultivator does not establish their foundation before the age of fifty, the difficulty increases significantly afterward. If they haven't established it by sixty, there is basically no hope.

Second, abundant mana. Mana liquefaction cannot be achieved without sufficient mana. Third, strong divine sense. In fact, ordinary cultivation methods also have some effect in strengthening divine sense, but it is quite slow. Thus, Foundation Establishment Pills have become highly sought-after elixirs in the cultivation world. A major function of this pill is to strengthen divine sense and invigorate the physique, clearing away hidden old injuries and any pill toxins or impurities left behind from consuming elixirs. Conversely, in terms of increasing mana, the Foundation Establishment Pill's effect is not as significant.

As an important transitional stage from Qi Condensation to Foundation Establishment, the Qi Condensation Perfection realm's most crucial aspect is to increase mana, allowing the mana within the dantian to be filled to its absolute maximum.

Chu Ning reviewed all this information one by one, then placed the jade slip back into his storage bag. He casually took out a mid-grade spirit stone. Simultaneously, he inwardly observed the state of the mana within his dantian.

Inside his dantian, nine distinct mana rings were visible, layered one upon another.

"Nine mana rings merge into one, forming a spherical shape, signaling entry into the Qi Condensation Perfection realm..." Chu Ning muttered to himself, then began cultivating the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art.

Three days passed in cultivation. Chu Ning used three mid-grade spirit stones before opening his eyes in the stone chamber.

"Qi Condensation Perfection!" Chu Ning smiled faintly and leaped to his feet.

He suddenly raised his right hand, and three fireballs appeared simultaneously. As soon as they appeared, the three fireballs instantly merged into one. With a flick of Chu Ning's wrist, a single fireball flew out into the air and impacted the wall.

*Boom!*

As an explosion rang out, waves of mana fluctuations echoed through the stone chamber. Seeing the three fireballs, which he had never been able to merge before, now effortlessly combine, Chu Ning felt a great sense of satisfaction. Indeed, after reaching Qi Condensation Perfection, his control over mana had become much stronger.

At this moment, Chu Ning's heart stirred, and he took out a long spear from his storage bag. This spear was obtained in the Spirit Domain from Shang Rui, a cultivator at the Qi Condensation Perfection realm. The other party called it the Fire Phoenix Feather Spear, a top-tier magic tool. Chu Ning had tried it before, but since it could not be activated with wood-attribute mana, he had kept it in his storage bag. And after returning to Azure Stream Sect, he was afraid someone in the sect would know that Shang Rui died by his hand, so he dared not take it out.

Now, holding the long spear, Chu Ning infused it with mana. The Fire Phoenix Feather Spear instantly became scorching hot, with flames condensing around its body. Chu Ning casually brandished it, and a sweep of flames immediately burst forth. Observing its might, it was considerably more powerful than the two fireballs Chu Ning had just conjured.

"This top-tier magic tool can indeed be used!" Chu Ning's eyes shone brightly, and its power greatly astonished him. He even had a faint feeling that if he fully activated it, the commotion would be so great that the stone chamber might not be able to conceal it.

Thinking of this, Chu Ning naturally would not easily attempt it. Putting away the Fire Phoenix Feather Spear, Chu Ning then checked his storage bag.

The Thousand Islands Competition was only a few days away, so he naturally had to prepare to represent Flying Rainbow Island in battle. Besides having many talismans at his disposal, he also needed a magic tool. The Fire Phoenix Feather Spear was not suitable. Like the dark short blade, this top-tier magic tool would not be easily used unless absolutely necessary.

He also had the Blazing Flame Bracelet, but he needed another spare. Most importantly, he had tried the Blazing Flame Bracelet before. The talisman seed condensed from his Crimson Flame Talisman, and the Crimson Flame Art, could not be cast using this magic tool. The same was true for the fireballs formed by his Blazing Fire Flame Art. The Blazing Flame Bracelet seemed only able to exert its own inherent attack. In that case, his Noon Fire Spirit Physique's ability to double the power of fire-attribute spells would not be utilized.

What made Chu Ning frown slightly was that among his high-grade magic tools in his storage bag, none were fire-attribute. When he killed several cultivators from the Yin Demon Sect in the Spirit Domain, he gained several high-attribute magic tools; among them were earth, wood, metal, and water, but no fire-attribute ones.

"Could it be that I can only use this long blade..." Chu Ning picked up the wood-attribute long blade. He frowned slightly; a targeted spell like the Verdant Wood Sword Art didn't seem appropriate to use with it. As for body cultivation, a life-saving technique, he certainly wouldn't use that either.

"Eh!"

At this moment, Chu Ning suddenly took out a spike from his storage bag. This item was obtained when he killed the effeminate youth during the fierce battle in the Earth Spirit Spring cave. Since it was a low-grade magic tool, Chu Ning had never paid much attention to it. Now, he suddenly recalled that the effeminate youth seemed to have used fire-attribute spells.

Chu Ning now held it in his hand and sensed it. Indeed, it was a fire-attribute magic tool. When Chu Ning tried to activate the Crimson Flame Art and the Blazing Fire Flame Art, he was surprised to find that both could be used. Although it was a low-grade magic tool and thus offered little amplification, both spells were inherently powerful, coupled with the bonus from Chu Ning's Noon Fire Spirit Physique. When stacked together, their combined power was even slightly stronger than the spells cast by the Blazing Flame Bracelet.

"You're the one!" Chu Ning smiled faintly, holding the spike.

After three days in seclusion, Chu Ning left the stone chamber at the inn again. He returned to the rogue cultivator gathering place to sell talismans, and also wandered around, hoping to find opportunities for picking up overlooked treasures. Unfortunately, such opportunities were not common, and Chu Ning found nothing after several days of searching.

However, the time for the Thousand Islands Competition quickly arrived.

This morning, after completing his cultivation, Chu Ning directly left the stone chamber at the inn. He then headed straight for the island's dao arena.

Arriving at the high platform reserved for Flying Rainbow Island, Jiang Hongguang and his wife, along with his sister Jiang Lan, had already arrived.

"Daoists, you're quite early." Chu Ning entered the platform and clasped his hands in greeting. The others returned his salute. Jiang Lan, however, looked at him with a hint of challenge in her eyes, which slightly surprised Chu Ning.

Jiang Hongguang also noticed Jiang Lan's gaze and immediately glared at her, then turned to Chu Ning with an apologetic expression. "Daoist Chu, my sister is reckless by nature, please don't take offense. This girl, seeing you so young yet already at the eighth level of Qi Condensation, feels a bit unconvinced. She's single-mindedly hoping that if there's a combat trial, she can perform better than you. She's truly a frog in a well, overestimating herself."

Hearing Jiang Hongguang speak so sincerely, Chu Ning instead chuckled lightly. "Daoist Jiang Lan's concern is not without reason. I usually don't engage in much combat, so I am indeed a bit lacking in that regard. If there truly is a combat trial, I am indeed a bit worried."

Upon hearing Chu Ning say this, Jiang Lan immediately cast a triumphant glance at Jiang Hongguang.

Jiang Hongguang, however, showed no concern, but rather a profound smile. This made Jiang Lan quite puzzled. She didn't know that Jiang Hongguang's thoughts at the moment were: "This Daoist Chu, so young yet already at the eighth level of Qi Condensation, is nevertheless so modest and steady in character. In my estimation, he must possess extraordinary qualities."

Subsequently, Jiang Hongguang began chatting with Chu Ning again. However, for most of the time, Jiang Hongguang spoke, and Chu Ning listened. When cultivators from other islands appeared, Jiang Hongguang would briefly tell Chu Ning about their identities and general strength. This gave Chu Ning a rough understanding of the strength of these islands.

Among the Thousand Lakes and Islands, there were approximately fifty islands with second-tier spirit veins. However, only twenty islands had relatively large second-tier spirit veins. These twenty islands each had a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. The other thirty islands had, at most, early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. As for the remaining islands, none had Foundation Establishment cultivators. While some island masters were at Qi Condensation Perfection or the ninth level of Qi Condensation, there were also quite a few cultivators like Jiang Hongguang, who were at the eighth level of Qi Condensation. Therefore, although there were many cultivators in the Thousand Lakes and Islands, their overall strength was not particularly strong.

Just then, several figures suddenly appeared on the large platform at the very front, successively taking seats in six chairs.

"These six are the Alliance Leaders of the Thousand Islands Alliance. The position of the main Alliance Leader of the Thousand Islands Alliance operates on a rotating basis," Jiang Hongguang began to explain. "It is held by the family heads of the various Alliance Leader families. They are the nominal controllers of the Thousand Islands Alliance."

"However, these individuals are not necessarily the strongest members within their respective families. It is said that within these few families, there are cultivators at the late-stage Foundation Establishment realm. Therefore, even the top ten islands with mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators dare not have any ill intentions towards the Thousand Islands Alliance. There is also a saying that these top ten islands are actually intricately connected to these six families."

Hearing Jiang Hongguang's words, Chu Ning felt that this possibility was very high. After all, if it were anyone else, they would likely try to control the islands with higher-grade spirit veins.

"It's Fairy Cen of the Cen family!"

"It really is Fairy Cen!"

...

At this moment, a clamor from below reached Chu Ning's ears. The Thousand Islands Competition was, after all, a major event in the Thousand Lakes and Islands, so in addition to the island masters, many other cultivators also came to watch. These people, unlike the island masters who had elevated platforms, were all gathered below. The clamor at this moment came from their mouths. While the platform's restrictions could block sound from escaping, they did not block external sounds from entering.

Hearing the commotion, Chu Ning looked over curiously. He saw that on the large platform at the very front, after the six family heads had taken their seats, more people walked out successively, appearing to be the juniors of each family. Behind the central figure, there was a woman in white, her face covered by a veil, making her true appearance unclear. However, her figure was graceful and lithe, and her temperament was ethereal, indeed possessing a certain fairy-like charm.

"It really is Fairy Cen!"

At this moment, Jiang Lan, standing next to Chu Ning, also spoke. Even as a woman, her eyes were fixed on the woman in white, with a hint of envy in her gaze and tone: "I heard that Fairy Cen is not only as beautiful as a celestial maiden, but her cultivation talent is also exceptionally outstanding; she has already successfully established her foundation. Moreover, she has inherited the essence of the Cen family's array formations, and her attainments in array formations are among the best in the entire Cen family. She is known as the number one Array Master in the Thousand Lakes and Islands."

Hearing this, Chu Ning couldn't help but feel curious about Fairy Cen. He couldn't resist asking, "How old is Fairy Cen?"

Jiang Lan looked at Chu Ning and replied with a somewhat complex tone, "If what is rumored outside is true, she is eighteen years of age!"
