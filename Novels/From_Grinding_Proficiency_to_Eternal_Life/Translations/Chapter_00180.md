# Chapter 180: The Emergence of Demons

The pupils of Xu Yunfan’s eyes contracted slightly. As the little figure struggled within the silk net, the pale golden ginseng threads around its wrists writhed as if they were living creatures.

What was even stranger was that where its feet touched the ground, several withered grasses sprouted new shoots at a speed visible to the naked eye. This was clearly the "Stepping on Earth to Generate Spring" anomaly of the Ginseng King recorded in the Hundred Herbs Sutra within the Heavenly Work Cave’s library.

This was a phenomenon unique to a thousand-year-old ginseng after it had transformed. Even in an era where the Primordial Spirit was flourishing, with an endless stream of experts breaking through their limits, this would still be considered a rare treasure.

Watching the little baby emerge from the rock layer as if using an evasion technique, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but exclaim in shock.

"This is the ginseng you were talking about?!"

The Ginseng Baby suddenly let out a sharp cry resembling an infant's wail. Three of the ginseng threads snapped taut, and the silk net binding it seemed on the verge of bursting apart.

"The Golden Silk Phoebe Cage!"

There was no time to answer Xu Yunfan's words. With a low roar from Zhangdeng, four Mang Mountain disciples carried out a hollowed-out wooden cage half a man's height.

The inner walls of the cage were covered in copper spikes, each tip coated with a layer of amber-colored viscous substance. Xu Yunfan smelled the pungent scent of Sichuan aconite juice, his eyes fixed intently on the Ginseng Baby.

Zhangdeng threw out seven bronze bells. The clappers inside were made of magnetite, and when they hit the ground, they formed the shape of the Big Dipper.

The baby suddenly stiffened in the net. The originally agile ginseng threads were pulled straight by the magnetic force. This thousand-year Ginseng King had its roots deeply buried in an iron mine and had long since conceived magnetic essence within its body.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes flickered, his heart surging with emotion. He did not step forward to stop them but watched everything silently.

The rock layer suddenly exploded with spiderweb-like cracks, and the bronze bells in Zhangdeng's hands split into seven pieces with a crisp sound.

The baby pushed off the ground with its feet, actually leaping into the air by stepping on the falling stones. The ginseng threads on its wrists shot out like silver needles, embedding into the rock wall, preparing to use the leverage to escape.

"The Dui position!" Zhangdeng shouted loudly. The four Mang Mountain disciples pulled on hidden stakes simultaneously. Eight copper pillars wrapped in red ropes suddenly rose from the ground, and the magnetite lanterns atop each pillar lit up instantly.

The Ginseng Baby slammed into the web wall woven by the red ropes. The ginseng threads touched the knots soaked in sulfur water, and smoke immediately rose.

In the next instant, seven red ropes soaked in red nitrate water suddenly sprang out from the rock crevices, grabbing the Ginseng Baby that was about to burrow into the ground. Two Mang Mountain disciples pulled the ropes and walked rapidly in circles.

Each knot was adorned with bells polished from magnetite. As the rope net contracted, the collision of the bells produced infrasound waves that shook the Ginseng Baby’s form.

This was the "Earth Dragon Lock" passed down through generations of the Mang Mountain tomb raiders, specifically designed to break the ear-bone positioning ability of earth-traveling spiritual beings. With the splashing of the Primordial Spirit, it had finally recovered some of its power.

The Ginseng Baby cried out "squeak squeak," its limbs struggling continuously, its round little face showing a pitiful, human-like expression.

"Don't be fooled by how pitiful this ginseng looks. A ginseng that can transform is a fierce character that dominates the mountains!" Zhangdeng said quickly, fearing that Xu Yunfan might suddenly feel pity and step forward to ruin their plan. However, while speaking, he saw Xu Yunfan standing by with a cold expression, looking calm and composed.

His heart tightened slightly; he recognized that Xu Yunfan was waiting to reap the benefits as the fisherman.

Even so, Zhangdeng was unwilling to give up. Since the Empress had shaken the Primordial Spirit of the earth veins, a trace of spiritual energy had returned to the world, causing the spiritual beings hidden deep within the earth to awaken passively.

To catch this Ginseng Baby, this group of people had hardly left the mountains, turning into wild men; how could they give up now?

"Wrap the ginseng threads!" Zhangdeng threw out three red rope darts, the knots at the tails spinning in the air.

These red ropes were woven from the shed skin of a century-old female python from southern Sichuan, soaked in a solution of rooster blood mixed with cinnabar for forty-nine days. Now, encountering the juice seeping from the Ginseng Baby's wrists, they acted like living things, wrapping around the ginseng threads.

The baby's left foot had just touched the ground when the ginseng threads沾上 (stained) with the red rope suddenly stiffened. It turned out that the magnetic powder wrapped inside the rope core repelled the magnetic essence within its body, severing its connection to the earth veins.

"Locked! It's locked!!!" A Mang Mountain disciple couldn't help but shout out, overjoyed.

As long as they could capture it, this group of people would have their names recorded in the annals of the Mang Mountain sect, and their status would naturally be different.

Xu Yunfan watched clearly as the Mang Mountain disciples held thirty-six red ropes, weaving a net according to the nine-palace formation. Whenever the red ropes crossed, magnetic powder mixed with sulfur was sprinkled at the knots, forming "red sand" on the ground that blocked the earth's energy.

The Ginseng Baby tried to shrink the earth several times but was bounced back to the center by the red rope boundaries. The red nitrate on its feet gradually hardened, turning it into a headless fly, shaking around constantly and crying out "squeak squeak," wanting to escape. But no matter how it struggled, it couldn't escape the increasingly dense red rope enclosure.

The most ingenious was the red ribbon coiled at Zhangdeng's waist. This rope, woven from hemp from the Miao region and magnetite ore silk, softened and hardened with the twitch of his wrist.

When the baby tried to钻向 (钻向) the Xun position, Zhangdeng甩绳成圈 (swung the rope into a loop), and the copper weight at the rope end accurately struck the反骨 (counter-bone) behind its head. The juice of datura seeds sealed inside the copper weight seeped into the ginseng body, instantly delaying its movements for three breaths.

In those three breaths, the thirty-six red ropes had already woven a dense net.

The disciples suddenly turned their wrists in unison, and all the red ropes instantly straightened into a hexagram formation, suspending the baby three feet off the ground.

The ginseng threads could not touch the soil and stones, and its earth-traveling magic was completely sealed. It could only kick futilely at the red ropes covered in magnetic powder. Every time it struggled, the Sichuan aconite juice soaked into the ginseng body a little more.

"Cage!"

The four disciples standing by lifted the cage full of copper spikes. Hearing the command, they moved swiftly, opened the cage door, threw the Ginseng Baby inside, and sealed it shut. Then, the outer layers of the wooden cage peeled away section by section, leaving only a bronze cage the size of a birdcage to firmly lock this Ginseng Baby.

"Success!"

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows and placed his hand on the Thunderfire麒麟 Hammer (Qilin Hammer). He glanced at Zhangdeng, and their eyes happened to meet. Zhangdeng looked as if he knew exactly what Xu Yunfan was planning to do.

Xu Yunfan grinned, revealing white teeth.

*If heaven gives it and you do not take it, you will suffer the blame.*

These tomb raiders from Mang Mountain were all grave robbers destined for early deaths; today, he would count it as eliminating harm for the people.

The strongest among them was merely Zhangdeng, at the Flesh Refining Realm. Although Xu Yunfan did not know exactly what level his own strength had reached, it definitely could not be measured by common sense.

Finding an excuse for himself, Xu Yunfan prepared to make his move.

"Wait, I have something to say!"

Seeing Xu Yunfan raising his hammer to charge, Zhangdeng hurriedly shouted, not daring to neglect. Just as he was about to speak, the ground suddenly shook.

A sinister and evil aura rose abruptly from an unknown source, instantly invading everyone. Even Xu Yunfan couldn't help but change his expression slightly. The pure Yang internal energy dormant deep in his flesh and blood, stimulated, began to reactivate, driving away the cold and阴冷 (yin-cold) aura within his body.

Deep within the cracked earth surface, two glowing red lanterns lit up. They were the eyes of a腐尸虎妖 (Corpse Tiger Demon) three zhang long. Those bloodshot eyes trembled constantly, sweeping over the people present. Then, its gaze fixed on the Ginseng Baby locked in the wooden cage.
