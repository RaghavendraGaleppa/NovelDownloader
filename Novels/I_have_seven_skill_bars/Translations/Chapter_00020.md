# Chapter 20: Failed Attempt?

Ding Rui was already accustomed to such partings. Although his friends in Spiritual Field 377 were very close, having spent days and nights together, farewells were inevitably tinged with sadness. Yet, such separations were also very common. Perhaps tomorrow, when he went to help eradicate the large aphids, he would see them again. However, their departure not only provided a new force for another spiritual field but also made Ding Rui's burden heavier! He now had to take on half of the weeding work, in addition to pest control and rain-making. He also had to find every possible way to combine the [Golden Ray Spear] and [Weed Eradication] skills into one.

Ding Rui sat by the spiritual field and found a spiritual rice plant surrounded by weeds. He placed one hand on the spiritual rice and the other on the weeds, simultaneously activating both the [Golden Ray Spear] and [Weed Eradication] skills in his mind. Two types of True Essence, Metal and Wood, immediately flowed out from his acupoints, splitting into two paths. The Metal-attribute True Essence entered the spiritual rice plant, condensing into a Golden Ray Spear, while the Wood-attribute True Essence, guided by his other hand, moved into the weeds and began to absorb their spiritual energy. Ding Rui also controlled the Golden Ray Spear within the spiritual rice, locating and killing the newly emerged aphids. When the Metal-attribute True Essence completed its task and returned to his body, the Wood-attribute True Essence had also fully absorbed all the spiritual energy from the weeds. It then detached itself from the withered weeds, floated to the spiritual rice stalk, and gently seeped into it.

He desperately wanted the two types of True Essence to synchronize their rhythms, but ultimately, they could only enter one after the other, a stark difference from the perfectly synchronized feeling when using skills. Yet, Ding Rui calmly continued to manipulate them. The Metal True Essence condensed into a Golden Ray Spear within the spiritual rice, while the Wood True Essence slowly traveled to the root of the weed and attached itself. The difficulty lay precisely here. If he were using a skill, none of this would be Ding Rui's concern. The True Essence would automatically condense into a Golden Ray Spear, automatically find the right location, and automatically absorb the spiritual energy from the weeds. Ding Rui's only real concern would be controlling the Golden Ray Spear to search for aphids within the spiritual rice. If none were found, the Golden Ray Spear would return; if found, the aphid would be killed. If it was a large aphid, he would use the [Golden Ray Spear] skill a few more times, then expend more mental effort to eradicate it. But without a skill, Ding Rui had to do everything himself. The moment he fully focused his attention on searching for and killing insects in the spiritual rice, the Wood True Essence in the weeds would stop absorbing spiritual energy. The moment he fully focused his attention on absorbing spiritual energy from the weeds, the Golden Ray Spear in the spiritual rice would fall into an uncontrolled state.

"Host has comprehended a skill! Please choose whether to place the skill into a skill slot and name it!" Although he had comprehended a skill, its speed was more than a hundred times slower than when Ding Rui used the two skills simultaneously. Naturally, he immediately discarded this newly comprehended skill. Ding Rui had concluded from his experience that skill slots only offered functionality, not intelligence. Any operation of True Essence could be condensed into a skill by the skill slots. However, which operations could be condensed into usable skills and which could not—these were things Ding Rui had to figure out himself. "Hoo..." Ding Rui opened his eyes and exhaled a long breath, finding himself completely drenched in sweat.
