# Chapter 32: Astonishing the Crowd  

"Free your heart from women, and your sword shall move with divine grace!"  

"The first page of the sword manual teaches: forget the one who holds your heart!"  

Lin Shan resisted the urge to glance at the beauty beside him, silently reciting a mantra to calm his mind. It wasn't that he lacked desires of the flesh—he simply felt that his time for cultivation was already insufficient. The bottleneck from the early to mid-stage of Qi Refining alone would take a decade to overcome naturally. Who knew how long it would take to reach the peak of the ninth layer? Moreover, his search for ancient charms had to be prioritized.  

Bringing a mere ornament along would only complicate matters. Even if he didn't keep her by his side, she might become a liability in the future.  

Lin Shan had no intention of allowing past romantic entanglements to become flaws in his mental fortitude. After all, mortals lived for no more than a century, while cultivators could extend their lifespans as their power grew.  

Of course, the lifespan limit for Qi Refining cultivators remained a hundred years—no different from mortals—so wasting time on romance was out of the question.  

"Though if a female cultivator took a liking to me, I wouldn't necessarily refuse..."  

Lin Shan's thoughts drifted, his mind conjuring visions of future romantic encounters. Unbeknownst to him, he was currently penniless, only capable of casting a basic Wind Blade spell, and his cultivation level was at the very bottom of the immortal world.  

Yet, with the enhancement panel at his disposal, he held a sliver of confidence in his future prospects.  

By now, the banquet had reached its peak. Master Zhao personally descended to the floor to toast the guests on behalf of his mother, the matriarch of the Zhao family, in honor of her birthday.  

Glasses clinked as the crowd reveled, while the dancers tirelessly poured wine and brewed tea, bustling about in a flurry.  

...  

Finally, after nearly completing his rounds, Master Zhao reached the back row and stopped before Lin Shan. Smiling, he raised his cup toward the young man seated at the table.  

The white-robed youth, however, remained motionless. He merely toyed with his wine cup, a faint smirk playing on his lips, making no move to rise.  

Master Zhao suppressed his displeasure. At first glance, the man before him seemed familiar, but he couldn't quite place him. A flicker of suspicion arose—just who had his steward invited?  

Truthfully, it was no fault of Master Zhao. Their previous encounter at the antique shop had been brief, and at the time, Lin Shan had been nothing more than a lowly early-stage Houtian martial artist. Even if he had invoked Protector Jiang's name, he was merely an errand boy—hardly worth Master Zhao's notice.  

Now, a year and a half later, Lin Shan had transformed into a third-layer Qi Refining cultivator. His entire demeanor had changed, and his cultivation level was unfathomable to ordinary eyes. No wonder Master Zhao failed to recognize him immediately.  

"Young Master Zhao has a short memory, it seems. Has it really been so long that you no longer recognize me?"  

Lin Shan's words weren't entirely unreasonable. To him, the past year and a half of secluded cultivation had passed in a flash—the night of the ambush felt like yesterday.  

"And you are...?" Master Zhao wondered if he had offended this man somehow. But with so many eyes upon him, he maintained his composure, though a sense of unease gnawed at him.  

"That antique golden bell of mine, worth three thousand taels of gold—Young Master Zhao has withheld it for over a year now."  

Lin Shan leaned forward slightly. "When do you intend to return it?"  

"It's you!"  

Master Zhao's memory snapped into focus. He had scoured the city for this very man a year prior but had found no trace of him and eventually given up.  

Now, not only had this audacious youth appeared before him in broad daylight, but his aura was also disturbingly elusive.  

Yet, as the head of a prominent family in Zangke City, Master Zhao was no fool. Lin Shan's cunning and caution had left a deep impression on him before. For the young man to appear so brazenly now, he must have some formidable backing.  

Realizing this, Master Zhao immediately retreated, putting distance between them.  

Though he was a first-rate expert himself, a wise man did not stand beneath a crumbling wall. At the same time, he barked orders to his men:  

"Seize him!"  

The guests in the courtyard, witnessing the sudden conflict, quickly cleared the area, eager to watch the spectacle unfold.  

The Zhao family's guards, long indebted to their masters, drew their blades without hesitation and lunged at Lin Shan.  

Lin Shan smiled faintly, not even bothering to raise a hand. After a year and a half of practice, his Wind Blade technique had reached perfection. With a mere thought, two crescent moons of cyan light—each three feet wide—materialized before him in an instant.  

"Whoosh! Whoosh!"  

The twin streaks of light sliced through the air with a whisper. Before a single scream could escape, over a dozen guards collapsed.  

"Clang! Clang! Clang!"  

The crisp sound of weapons hitting the ground echoed as severed limbs and blood painted the floor in a grotesque display.  

The women among the guests shrieked in horror.  

The onlookers, no longer entertained, scrambled away in panic. At the center of the carnage, the white-robed youth remained spotless, still idly twirling his wine cup. He even had the leisure to motion for a nearby dancer to refill it.  

"Gulp."  

Someone's loud swallow of fear went unchallenged, for among the guests were those with keen eyes and worldly experience. One of them gasped:  

"True Qi Externalization! A Xiantian master!"  

At this exclamation, the crowd gazed at the solitary drinker with awe. Motionless, he had slain his enemies with a mere thought, his robes unstained, his demeanor transcendent under the moonlight.  

A Xiantian master!  

To mortals, such figures were legends of the martial world—capable of turning petals into blades, unleashing sword qi at will, and achieving the impossible. Even armies could not subdue them, and nobles treated them with utmost respect!  

It was no surprise they lacked knowledge of cultivators, for immortals rarely revealed themselves to mortals. Their numbers were as scarce as grains of sand in the vast ocean.  

Most spent their days secluded in remote mountains or blessed lands, too preoccupied with refining their meridians to bother with the mortal realm. Unless they had nothing better to do, why would they wander among ordinary folk?  

Moreover, the Wind Blade technique perfectly matched the legends of Xiantian masters' True Qi Externalization. Having witnessed its might firsthand, the crowd had no reason to doubt their judgment.  

At the same time, they wondered—when had the Zhao family grown so bold as to provoke a reclusive Xiantian master, inviting his wrath upon their doorstep?  

"This does not bode well for the Zhao family," many silently lamented.  

...  

Master Zhao was stunned.  

Had this brat truly reached Xiantian in just a year and a half?  

In all his years, he had never heard of anyone advancing from Houtian to Xiantian in such a short time.  

"Impossible! He must have already been at the Xiantian or half-step Xiantian level before! But then why did he invoke Protector Jiang's name? Why did he flee that night and abandon the golden bell?"  

Master Zhao's mind was in turmoil, unable to make sense of it.  

Meanwhile, the elderly matriarch of the Zhao family, seated on the high platform, fainted from shock. Hearing the commotion, the rest of the Zhao clan rushed from the rear courtyard.  

"What's going on?!"  

A white-haired elder, unaware of the earlier events, led a group of clansmen forward.  

He took in the scene—scattered corpses and blood, guests cowering at the edges, and a lone white-robed youth seated at a table, embracing a dancer as he drank.  

Master Zhao stood frozen opposite him, while the matriarch lay unconscious.  

"Outrageous! How dare you wreak havoc in the Zhao family, you insolent brat!"  

The elder's fury blazed. Without pausing to consider why Master Zhao was hesitating, he charged at Lin Shan, intent on ending the troublemaker with a single palm strike.  

"Second Elder, no!"  

Master Zhao's warning came too late.  

A crescent of light flashed through the air. The elder collapsed mid-charge, his head separating from his body even as his enraged expression remained intact.  

"Gasp!"  

The crowd inhaled sharply. This elder was none other than the infamous head of the Zhao family's disciplinary hall—a first-rate expert! Yet he had died in his own courtyard without even realizing his fate.  

Now, even those who had doubted before were convinced—this white-robed youth slaughtered first-rate experts as easily as butchering livestock. He was undoubtedly a Xiantian master!  

A deathly silence fell over the gathering.
