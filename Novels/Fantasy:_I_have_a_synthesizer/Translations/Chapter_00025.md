**Chapter 25: The Illusion Pagoda, Su Yu Underestimated**

"Illusion Pagoda?" Su Yu's expression shifted slightly.

The surrounding prodigies were also eager to try, and under the bald man's lead, they slowly arrived before a massive stone pagoda. Faint spiritual energy fluctuations emanated from around the pagoda, and intricate runes were carved into its surface. Beside the stone pagoda stood a colossal stone tablet.

"This is the Prodigy Ranking. The higher the floor one breaks through in the Illusion Pagoda, the higher one's rank on the Prodigy Ranking will be," the bald man said indifferently.

Everyone looked, and saw the words clearly inscribed on the stone tablet:

"Prodigy Ranking!"
"First Place: Wang Lin, Early Viscera Refinement Realm, 70th Floor!"
"Second Place: Li Xianzong, Early Viscera Refinement Realm, 69th Floor!"
"Third Place: Ouyang Ningxue, Early Viscera Refinement Realm, 65th Floor!"
"Fourth Place: Lin Feng, Early Viscera Refinement Realm, 64th Floor!"

Indeed, there were seventy or eighty names on the Prodigy Ranking, all of them repeat students from the Prodigy Camp. Even the worst among them was at the Mid-Blood Refinement Realm, having cleared forty floors in the Illusion Pagoda.

Su Yu took a deep breath. "So these are the prodigies from Jiangnan Province? They're truly terrifying!" he thought.

After a slight sigh of amazement, a series of exclamations suddenly rang out. "Oh my god, it's only been a few seconds, and Yang Xiao has already broken through to the second floor! As expected of an orange-tier genius, truly terrifying!"

Just then, the light on the first floor of the Illusion Pagoda faded, and the light on the second floor lit up. This meant Yang Xiao had cleared the first floor. Even the bald man beside the Illusion Pagoda couldn't help but nod.

"Not bad. At this speed, breaking through thirty floors won't be an issue. The question is whether he can clear forty floors. If he can surpass those repeat students, this year will be interesting!" The bald man smiled faintly, a hint of expectation in his eyes.

As time passed, soon, the fortieth floor of the Illusion Pagoda lit up.

"Hiss, Yang Xiao actually did it! Truly worthy of being the most outstanding prodigy of our generation!"
"Indeed, it seems Jiangnan Province is about to produce an unparalleled monstrous talent this year!"

The smile on the bald man's face deepened considerably. He had personally brought Yang Xiao here, and the better Yang Xiao performed, the more glory it brought him. Soon, Yang Xiao stopped at the forty-fifth floor and emerged from the Illusion Pagoda.

The bald man, his attention now shifting, mumbled as his gaze fell upon a list. "Su Yu!" The bald man's eyes lit up. "So this is the golden-tier prodigy that Old Bai and the President spoke of! I hope he can give me some surprises!"

A moment later, a dazed prodigy emerged from the Illusion Pagoda, having stopped at the thirtieth floor. And he was even a Blood Refinement Realm expert. The bald man snorted coldly. "The first thirty floors are designed for Qi-Blood Realm martial artists. You, a Blood Refinement Realm expert, couldn't even clear the first thirty floors? Useless!"

The man's face turned unpleasant, his fists clenched, a hint of resentment flashing in his eyes. But, due to the bald man's strength, he could only stand to the side, filled with indignation, and remain silent. The bald man eyed the youth coldly, then pulled out the list and announced loudly.
