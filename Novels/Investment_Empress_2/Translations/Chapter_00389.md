# Chapter 389: Returning to Ziyang Prefecture City (1/2)

The Ying family's old residence was now a landscape of broken walls and collapsed structures, with only the ancestral hall retaining a semblance of its original appearance.

However, a large hole had been torn through the ancestral hall's roof, allowing a beam of sunlight, accompanied by drifting snow, to fall upon the statues of the ancestors.

In front of the statues, the incense burner remained, though two additional memorial tablets now sat on the shelf.

"Son, come offer some incense to your Ying family uncles and aunts."

"Coming."

Li Mo lit the incense and bowed to the tablets. Suddenly, he felt a sensation and looked up at the statue of the Ying family's ancestor.

Just a moment ago, there was clearly a fluctuation of the Power of All Living Beings that flashed and vanished, but now it seemed to have returned to an ordinary state.

The Nanyang Witch Spirit Statue?

At that time, in the dream, a huge question mark had floated in Li Mo's mind.

Even for commoner families or major clans, the ancestor statues they enshrined could not possess the kind of divine power seen in the dream—one that could even disperse the Nian Beast...

Li Mo stared intently at the statue. Its face gave him a sense of familiarity... but searching his memories carefully, he could find no trace of it.

At this moment.

Footsteps suddenly came from behind.

"Master?" came Li Dalong's voice.

"Hm?"

Li Mo turned around and saw Xue Jing standing at the entrance of the ancestral hall in the snow, dressed like an ordinary apothecary, a smile on his face.

Xue Jing naturally hadn't come alone.

Since Li Dalong's master had arrived, Li Mo's master naturally came as well.

Shang Wu stood with her arms crossed, her chin slightly raised.

"Master, why have you personally come here?" ×2

"The Crown Prince of the Great Yu arrived in Yunzhou yesterday. It won't be long before he reaches Ziyang Prefecture to personally commend Xiao Mo and Xiao Bing'er," Elder Xue said cheerfully.

"!"

Li Dalong froze, his back suddenly straightening.

Gu Xueqin pinched her husband's waist, feeling as if she hadn't fully woken up yet.

The Crown Prince of the Great Yu, the next Emperor of the Great Yu, personally coming to their doorstep to offer commendation.

The impact of this was evidently different for the couple.

The Crown Prince of the Great Yu, number one on the Prodigy List, the one who took away Chu Long's Sword Bone... his elder brother?

Li Mo narrowed his eyes and walked to his master's side.

Shang Wu turned slightly to the side:

"I'm just out for a stroll with Elder Xue. You're the prodigy of the Prodigy List; how could we possibly be worthy of your company?"

"Master, all the soldiers in Nanyang know that the reason I could defeat the enemy army was entirely due to the winning secrets you taught me. Although you didn't accompany me there, the reputation of the 'Rules of Fighting King' has undoubtedly spread throughout all of Nanyang."

"Hmph..."

"By the way, Master, I have a constructive suggestion."

Li Mo took out a bottle of Golden Wind Blade and a thick red envelope from his System Space, saying with a serious expression:

"Let's join forces and take out that so-called Crown Prince of the Great Yu."

"As expected of my precious disciple. If we take him out, I'll be the master of the number one prodigy on the list!"

Shang Wu took a sip of the wine and felt that her disciple's thoughts aligned perfectly with hers. Only then did her beautiful, flower-like face stop looking so displeased.

The master and disciple huddled together, whispering and plotting.

Occasionally, they let out eerie "hehehe" laughs.

Xue Jing: "....."

Li Dalong flicked his son on the head, but it only made his own fingers hurt. This brat's head was truly as hard as iron.

"You unfilial wretch, that's the Crown Prince, the Emperor's eldest son. What you just said is enough to get you sentenced, you know that?"

"So what if he's the Emperor's eldest son?"

Li Mo, who grew up under the red flag, muttered to himself: "Who could cut off the supply lines to the Qingmu City army? Who could recall the urgent orders of the King of the South back to the Imperial Capital?"

Li Dalong's face stiffened instantly.

After thinking about it for a moment, Old Li seemed to deflate like a punctured balloon. He opened his mouth to say something but stopped himself.

He could only look at Ying Bing:

"Bing'er, do you think what he said is appropriate?"

"The Crown Prince of the Great Yu..."

---

The Ice Cube pondered for a moment and said coldly:

"Him? Commend me?"

Li Dalong: "???"

Wait, I'm asking you to talk some sense into that disrespectful Li Mo.

I'm not asking you to give a textbook example of how to be even worse!

Bing'er isn't the type to be like this. Although she is proud and aloof at heart, she wouldn't speak recklessly. How could she...

Li Dalong and Gu Xueqin exchanged a glance.

Could it be that she's been corrupted by that good-for-nothing son?!

Elder Xue was already familiar with Shang Wu and Li Mo's master-disciple antics. He coughed lightly:

"We can say these outrageous things in private, but on the surface, the Qingyuan Sect is still nominally bestowed a title by the Taizu Emperor. Although we don't submit to the court, we cannot ignore them completely."

"The Crown Prince is coming, so we must observe basic etiquette."

"At the very least, we need to be present to save face. We should set off today."

Anyway, New Year's Eve and Li Mo's birthday had passed. The next few days would just be a matter of relatives and friends visiting and the annual mutual showing-off between his parents.

Furthermore, it wasn't a good thing to have special effects bombarding the Broken Axe Mountain every day.

So, after lunch that same day, the group prepared to return to Ziyang Prefecture.

"We're in a hurry, so I borrowed Elder Qian's warship."

Xue Jing tossed out Elder Qian's precious warship in the Li family's backyard.

"There's no need for that."

Li Mo smiled slightly and summoned the Somersault Cloud.

Now, as long as he didn't use the "Ten Thousand Li Teleportation" function, the Somersault Cloud could easily carry more than a dozen people.

"What kind of martial art is this??"

Xue Jing's eyes widened slightly. Although he was惊诧 internally, he calmly nodded on the surface.

The Somersault Cloud rose into the air and flew towards Ziyang Prefecture.

The waving parents became blurry, and soon even Qinghe County became small and gradually disappeared from sight.

The Somersault Cloud gradually flew above the clouds, and even the snowflakes brushing against their faces were gone.

Three suns hung high in the sky, scorching the sea of clouds beneath their feet, giving people a feeling of having nowhere to hide.

"I wish I had a pair of sunglasses," Li Mo thought to himself.

By the way, Princess Jiang's eyes couldn't look directly at the sun, which was somewhat similar to an eye disease from his previous life.

It's quite inconvenient to always wear a cloth band. If it were replaced with sunglasses...

He didn't know how big Chu Long's head was; he should go measure it later.

"Xiao Mo, Xiao Bing'er, the anomalies at Broken Axe Mountain are astonishing. You must have heard something about it."

Xue Jing suddenly transmitted his voice.

At high altitudes, it's impossible to transmit sound by opening one's mouth.

"..."

Li Mo remained silent for a moment, then nodded and said: "I know a little, what about it, Elder Xue?"

The Ice Cube pursed her lips, glanced at Li Mo, and sat quietly beside him without saying a word.

Xue Jing said earnestly:

"The anomalies at Broken Axe Mountain are so astonishing. Whatever is inside the mountain is definitely not trivial. As a result, it has already attracted many major sects. Quite a few state-level sects, hidden sects, and formidable wandering martial artists are now flocking to it..."

"You mean, our Qingyuan Sect is a small sect. If we get involved, we might easily get caught in the crossfire?"

"..."

Old Xue was choked. This brat sure knows how to speak the blunt truth.

"Our sect's origins are also quite profound..."

"Back to the main point. The sect has discussed it, and we still need to go to Broken Axe Mountain. Are you and Ying Bing willing to investigate it?"

"Of course. For the sake of the sect, it is my unshirkable duty."

Li Mo nodded seriously and solemnly. He leaned back slightly, his hand naturally sliding down to hold the Ice Cube's small hand.

Xue Jing was very satisfied with his answer and smiled:

"Broken Axe Mountain is a mixed bag. If the two of you go alone, the Sect Master and the elders would be uneasy. So, after some discussion, we have a convenient plan to ensure your safety."

"Taking advantage of the Crown Prince's personal visit, we can ask him to take you along."
