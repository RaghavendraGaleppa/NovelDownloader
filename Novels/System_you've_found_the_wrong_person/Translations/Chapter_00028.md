# Chapter 28: Three Suns Mountain, Heroes' Gathering  

At dawn, Dou Changsheng faced the rising sun.  

Seated cross-legged on a bluestone, he diligently practiced the *Triple Origin Qi Art*. This supreme martial technique was a rare opportunity—one that countless wandering cultivators might never obtain in their lifetimes.  

Take Ironclad Lion King Xiong, for example. He had risked life and limb repeatedly, all for the chance to acquire a martial art that reached the Xiantian realm. Knowing how precious this opportunity was, Dou Changsheng treasured it deeply.  

Since obtaining the *Triple Origin Qi Art*, he had practiced it daily. The technique filled the gaps in his cultivation, providing him with an internal energy method and teaching him how to condense the Five Qi.  

The cultivation of Five Qi converging toward the Origin involved tempering the five viscera: the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. Each completed stage would refine his Xiantian Qi once, eventually transforming it into Xiantian True Qi.  

After a day of intense cultivation, Dou Changsheng felt his Xiantian Qi increase by another thirty percent.  

A hoarse voice suddenly spoke: "After days of rigorous practice, you've fully adapted to the *Triple Origin Qi Art* and can now control the vast Xiantian Qi within you. With the power of this technique, your Xiantian Qi is no weaker than ordinary Xiantian True Qi."  

"With such profound Xiantian Qi, you can already overpower an average Xiantian True Realm martial artist in a direct confrontation."  

"But that only applies to ordinary martial artists—like the Xiantian True Realm expert you previously killed. Against the disciples of great sects or the direct heirs of noble clans, attempting to defeat a higher realm opponent would be futile."  

"Among the Five Qi, the heart resides in the chest, between the lungs, above the diaphragm, protected by the pericardium. Its shape is round at the top and pointed at the bottom, like an unopened lotus."  

"It is the sovereign of the body, the root of life!"  

"Ordinary cultivators follow the principle of starting easy and progressing to the difficult, but the *Triple Origin Qi Art* does the opposite."  

"The first step is to cultivate the heart."  

"Near the capital lies Three Suns Mountain. Within it, there is a clear spring called the Azure Sun Spring. Its waters are icy cold, emitting a chilling aura that freezes the ground for three feet around it. Even in the scorching summer, the area feels like the depths of winter."  

"This spring is a holy relic for healing, renowned for its ability to protect the heart meridian. The spring water produced each year is monopolized by nobles and aristocrats, making it priceless."  

"By my reckoning, this year's opening of the Azure Sun Spring is approaching."  

"I have some small influence and can secure you a spot. Take this letter, and you may enter Three Suns Mountain to compete for the Azure Sun Spring. With its protection for your heart meridian and the aid of your vast Xiantian Qi, you should be able to complete the first refinement of your Xiantian Qi in a short time."  

Dou Changsheng watched as a letter materialized before him, hovering in the air.  

He accepted it solemnly with both hands and carefully tucked it into his robes.  

"If you fail to obtain the Azure Sun Spring, our connection ends here. Farewell."  

The hoarse voice gradually faded until it disappeared entirely. Dou Changsheng scanned his surroundings but saw no trace of the speaker.  

Over the past days of cultivation, Dou Changsheng had not only trained diligently but also immersed himself in the knowledge of the martial world. He now understood that beyond the three Xiantian realms lay the Divine Marvel Realm—a major threshold where one could be called a Grandmaster upon entry.  

Those who reached this realm possessed extraordinary abilities, hence the name "Divine Marvel."  

For example, a Pure Yin Grandmaster could project their Yin Spirit, travel a thousand miles in a single night, or even possess another's body—abilities so mystical they resembled immortal arts.  

If one had not yet nurtured their spirit or if their spiritual will was weak, even if a Grandmaster stood before them, they would remain unseen by mortal eyes.  

To have a Grandmaster personally guide his cultivation was nothing short of a divine blessing.  

Without wasting words, Dou Changsheng rose, grabbed his Hero's Sword, and walked to his white horse. Untying the reins, he mounted and rode south toward Three Suns Mountain.  

The northern lands were embroiled in chaos, and it was best to stay far away.  

He understood that this trip to Three Suns Mountain was the Wang Clan Grandmaster's way of pulling him out of the whirlpool.  

Yes.  

Though Dou Changsheng couldn't discern the Grandmaster's identity, he knew that mastery of the *Triple Origin Qi Art* meant this person had to be a high-ranking member of the Xiangzhou Wang Clan.  

The Grandmaster's appearance also eased Dou Changsheng's worries—at least the Xiangzhou Wang Clan did not hold his actions against him.  

That they didn't directly bring him to Xiangzhou was understandable. After all, the overwhelming destiny that the "future Dou Changsheng" possessed was not his.  

In the northern conflict, the "future Dou Changsheng" had been insignificant, drawing no attention. But he was different—he was too deeply involved.  

His name was already known to the Demon Minister.  

The Xiangzhou Wang Clan couldn't openly bring him into Xiangzhou, which was why the Grandmaster had appeared under the guise of the military advisor's faction. This thin veil of secrecy wouldn't fool the observant, but as long as no one spoke of it openly, there was still room for maneuver.  

---  

Three Suns Mountain was a renowned peak in the world.  

Azure Sun Peak was its main summit.  

The Azure Sun Spring, revered as a holy relic, attracted martial artists like moths to a flame. Though its output was considerable, demand far outstripped supply—after being divided among many, how much could remain for each?  

The current sect master of the Three Suns Sect was frowning in distress.  

His yellowish hand repeatedly stroked his goatee, occasionally tugging so hard that a few carefully trimmed hairs snapped off. Normally, he would have been heartbroken, but now he didn't even notice.  

Holding a letter in his trembling hand, he sighed deeply.  

"The opening of the Azure Sun Spring is imminent, and all the spots are already allocated. How can we possibly produce another?"  

Purple Sun Daoist, holding a horsetail whisk, flicked it lightly. A teacup on the Eight Immortals table rose into the air, its contents floating gracefully into his mouth. After swallowing, he shook his head.  

"Those who have secured spots are not to be trifled with—they are either scions of noble houses or direct disciples of great sects."  

The sect master said bitterly, "They may be untouchable, but is Nine Heavens Cloud Crane any easier to deal with?"  

"I must have been blind to ever want this position. Every year, I have to endure the arrogance of these people."  

Purple Sun Daoist sighed. "Blame the fact that Three Suns Mountain is too close to the capital."  

"Nobles and sect heirs are everywhere here. This is the capital of Jin, the foremost of the Four Kingdoms. Every martial artist in the world must come here if they wish to compete with the world's heroes."  

"Since we have an extra spot, let them settle it with a duel."  

"The loser leaves, and this Dou Changsheng takes their place."  

"A fair contest—if they lose, they can only blame their own lack of skill. If they resent it, let them direct their anger at Nine Heavens Cloud Crane."  

The sect master sighed again. "I fear they won't dare to hate Nine Heavens Cloud Crane. Instead, they'll hate us."  

"Ever since he entered the northern lands, the simmering tensions there have abruptly calmed."  

"Such influence—how many in the world possess it?"  

"A great king has fallen, only for a young king to rise."  

"The Xiangzhou Wang Clan has gained another divine heir in this generation."  

"The fortunes of this era truly belong to them."  

"What does he need the Azure Sun Spring for? It's just an excuse to make a name for the Wang Clan's divine heir."  

"If he wants to climb the Rankings of Heroes, let him go to the capital, to Xianyang, to Linzi, to Jiangdu!"  

"Why bully us?"
