# Chapter 406: The Second Mural (Part 1/2)

The underground palace finally fell silent.

The swordsmen looked at the hammer in Li Mo’s hand, then at the "Nian Gao" not far away, and the tension in their hearts finally relaxed slightly.

This damn sense of security.

"Did you cut down that Human-Faced Bat, Old Bai?"

Li Mo sized up the swordsmen for a moment, finding that most of them were just breathing erratically and looked a little pale.

Only Bai Jinghong’s face was completely green, blood seeping from his chest, looking a bit more wretched.

"A slight effort... yue~~"

Bai Jinghong stood up, raising his chin slightly, not wanting to lose the imposing aura of a carefree swordsman. But before he could finish showing off, the movement agitated the poison in his system, and he bent over to vomit a rainbow.

He vomited until even his bile came out.

After finishing, he straightened his waist again. With tears and snot all over his face, even though he could barely stand steady, he said with an air of indifference:

"Just a slight effort."

Li Mo: "..." 

As long as his mouth is tough, the problem shouldn't be too big. It's good that he isn't stiff all over.

He took out Antidote Pills and Healing Medicines from his System Space and distributed them to the swordsmen:

"First take the Seven-Striped Decontamination Pill, then apply and take the Hundred-Flower Condensed Dew Cream externally and internally."

Cao Mu, however, put away the pills Li Mo gave him. His injuries and poisoning weren't severe, so he should save where he can and spend where he must.

Truly rich... handing out life-saving pills like pouring beans from a bamboo tube.

"The Elders?"

"This underground palace has a maze formation; we got separated from the Elders."

Wu Chushu held the medicine bottle, glancing at Li Mo and Ying Bing, his heart filled with mixed feelings.

Meeting again, he is already the fourth on the Hidden Dragon List.

So many of them are in a sorry state, yet the other person hasn't even dirtied the hem of his clothes, strolling casually as if out for a spring outing.

The gap between people is sometimes greater than the gap between people and dogs.

"Showing off in front of people again..."

"What are you mumbling about, Old Wu?" Li Mo asked, puzzled.

"Thanks for the pills!!"

"Just say thanks, why did you shout so loudly..."

Li Mo scratched his ear.

"Brother Li, what are these?"

"Tomb Guardians. They grew from the spiritual evil spirits and Yin energy nourished deep underground."

As Li Mo explained, he couldn't help but think of the scene just now.

It was the black Nian Beast again.

And... why did it recognize Bing Dui?

Just as he was pondering, Tian Miao's shout came from not far away:

"Come quickly, there's a new discovery here!"

"I'll go take a look," Li Mo said to the Hengyun Three Heroes, then牵着 Bing Dui towards Tian Miao.

Bai Jinghong, Wu Chushu, and Cao Mu watched their backs disappear into the light, and the surrounding darkness immediately became deep and eerie again.

They looked at each other and swallowed involuntarily.

When Li Mo was around, it felt like there was an invisible wing shielding them.

Now it was gone with a snap.

"Should we... go take a look too?" Cao Mu said.

Bai Jinghong raised his chin: "How can I, Bai Jinghong, fall behind others in my lifetime? Let's go!"

Wu Chushu touched his nose: "I've always had a keen interest in archaeology; I'm quite curious about what they found."

Cao Mu was speechless: "Stop talking nonsense, they are almost out of sight."

Thus, the group of swordsmen followed suit.

They finally arrived at the end of this underground palace. There stood rows of bookshelves, some already rotten and collapsed. The ground was covered in thick ash, likely the result of weathered pages, as not a single intact book could be seen on the shelves.

---

"This place is like a library."

"Mm."

Ying Bing nodded lightly, feeling a bit regretful.

Finally, they saw Tian Miao's figure ahead. She was standing before a huge mural.

The protagonists of the mural were still those nine figures descending from the heavens. They and their followers were currently battling a group of terrifying creatures.

Some creatures were like mountains, standing on one leg, covered in black scales, with wind and thunder spewing from their nostrils.

Some had bodies made of fierce winds, heads like lions, leaving nothing but black sandstorms wherever they passed.

Others had bizarre bodies, dark red scales, winding for thousands or tens of thousands of miles. Wherever they passed, everything turned to darkness. Only when they opened their eyes did the heavens and earth light up with the sun again.

However, that sun was scarlet and terrifying.

"Is all of this... real?"

Wu Chushu couldn't help but gasp, unable to imagine it.

Bai Jinghong, Cao Mu, and the other swordsmen looked completely bewildered; this exceeded their worldview.

Even among the Demon Race...

"According to my understanding, the content above should be like this..."

Tian Miao calmed the excitement in her voice and explained slowly.

"Legend has it that in ancient times, when the human race was still extremely weak, the masters of the heavens and earth were still various innate creatures. The powerful ones among them were like gods and demons."

"The Divine Intent we perceive originated from the initial worship of their power by the human race, and the derivation of learning from them."

Li Mo nodded. To this day, pictographic boxing is still widely circulated and is the mainstream of martial arts.

Later, the Literary Path and Sword Path appeared, likely because the innate creatures had already vanished, and the human race derived them by perceiving the heavens and earth on their own.

"So, it was the Nine Heavens who killed the gods and demons?"

"Innate creatures cannot be killed."

Tian Miao shook her head and said: "They have already merged with the 'Dao'. As long as the 'Dao' in the heavens and earth exists, they are immortal. It's just that after being reborn, it may not necessarily be the original 'it'."

Her meaning was: if you kill a Ming Jiao symbolizing wind and rain, the wind and rain still exist, and a new Ming Jiao will still be born, but it won't be the original one.

There were quite a few murals in this underground palace. They walked further back with the light and saw new content.

"These should be records of the innate creatures being temporarily eliminated."

In the picture, the human race began to increase in number.

Led by the Nine Heavens and their followers, the humans prayed to the heavens and earth, and new innate creatures were born.

But this time, different from before, they lost their original ferocity and became totems of the human race!

"The Power of All Living Beings!"

These four words appeared in Li Mo's mind.

"The Power of All Living Beings was initially used by the Nine Heavens to control the innate creatures, or rather, the 'Dao'... a shackle?"

Ying Bing narrowed her ice-mirror-like eyes slightly while also looking at Li Mo.

The two of them thought of the same thing in默契.

"Those priests who led the human race in praying to the heavens and earth, or rather, a part of them, were the predecessors of the Summoning Demon Sect?"

So, the Ancestral God of the Summoning Demon Sect was indeed a Nine Heavens Immortal, or at least a few of them.

The Dream God...

Being able to wander through the dreams of countless living beings, it must have played an important role among them.

The people of Hengyun Sword City were dumbfounded.

The infamous Demon Sect of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths actually had such origins.

No wonder it has such a long history to this day, and even though the Great Yu Dynasty cannot tolerate it, it remains so active.

It turns out that a dying camel is still bigger than a horse!

*Rumble—*

Suddenly, the entire underground palace shook again at this moment, with a movement that shook the heavens and earth.
