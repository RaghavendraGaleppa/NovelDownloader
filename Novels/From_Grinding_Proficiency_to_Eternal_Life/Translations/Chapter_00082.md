# Chapter 82: The Sky Cicada Gate

The water in the ditches beside the fields flowed gently, reflecting the light of the sky and the shadows of the clouds. Wildflowers bloomed on the ridges, egrets danced gracefully, and farmers worked among them, accompanied from time to time by birdsong. It was a scene of pure tranquility.

This place was a world apart from the north of Wuzhou.

Thundercloud Mountain was shrouded in mist day and night, as if overlooking the vast earth. The mountain’s terrain was perilous, with peaks stacked upon peaks, and cliffs as sharp as if carved by an axe or chisel, piercing straight into the clouds.

Thunder and lightning raged in the mountains throughout the year, and the name "Thundercloud Mountain" originated from this awe-inspiring power of nature.

Above the mountainside, jagged rocks loomed, mist swirled, and a biting chill filled the air, as if it had severed all connection with the noise of the mortal world, becoming an isolated secret realm.

After entrusting his bay horse to a farmer's family at the foot of the mountain, Xu Yunfan followed the stone steps leading upward. He passed through the dense, ascending forest and arrived at the waist of Thundercloud Mountain, where his vision suddenly opened up.

The dark red rocks on the mountainside looked as if they had been split open by a giant axe. Seven hundred and thirty stone steps had been carved out of the thousand-ren high cliffs. Each step was soaked in the dark brown of the years, and from time to time, one could see green moss covering the broken bronze cicada sculptures beside the steps.

When Xu Yunfan stepped on the final bluestone step, he suddenly saw a torii-style gate. Above it were written the three words "Sky Cicada Gate," the gilded color of the characters long since faded by the passage of time.

Even this gate, Xu Yunfan could see clearly, was a mix of old and new, clearly rebuilt upon the original broken foundation.

"Halt."

A sudden iron caltrop shot out from a crack in the rocks. As Xu Yunfan sidestepped, the tip of a sword, cold as ice, pricked the back of his neck.

A woman wielding a sword as thin as a cicada's wing stood there, dressed in a tight-fitting uniform with cicada patterns. Her left eye was covered by black silk, and a burn scar on her right cheek stretched down to her collarbone.

Xu Yunfan didn't move, allowing the sword to remain pointed at the back of his neck.

*This sword is flexible enough, but lacks toughness. It can't break my hardened body.*

"I am here to become a disciple," Xu Yunfan said.

"A disciple?"

The woman was surprised. She didn't move her sword away, but instead sized up Xu Yunfan.

"You already possess martial strength, at least the level of a martial artist who has tempered his body. Why would you come to the Sky Cicada Gate to become a disciple?"

"I have a Sky Cicada Gate token here. It was Liu Tianyun who sent me."

Xu Yunfan reached into his chest and pulled out a token, passing it behind him.

"A Blood Cicada Token?"

The tip of her sword hooked the token with precise, silent force, but the missing joint of her thumb exposed an old injury.

After confirming it was genuine, she finally moved her sword away, her expression complex as she fiddled with the token in her hand.

Xu Yunfan turned to look, seeing the complicated expression on the woman's face quickly settle.

"I am Lin Hanyi. Come with me to see the Master, and we will decide then."

Passing through the gate and crossing the training ground, Xu Yunfan saw three少年 sparring. Bronze chains, worn with age, were tied to their ankles, pulling taut like bowstrings when they threw their punches.

The thinnest one was suddenly thrown toward a stone pillar, but at the moment of impact, he curled his body and rolled, the muscles on his bruised back twisting like old tree roots.

These few young men had quite good potential. At such a young age, they had already entered the path of martial arts, their blood and energy active.

With a single glance, Xu Yunfan stopped paying attention and followed Lin Hanyi across the training ground.

Lin Hanyi suddenly grasped Xu Yunfan's wrist, the calluses on her tiger's mouth scraping painfully. "Don't speak much when we meet the Senior Brother later. I will handle the talking."

Xu Yunfan had no objection, but he continued to observe the Sky Cicada Gate.

Although it was kept clean, it still couldn't hide its dilapidation, shabbiness, and coldness.

Back when he was at the Xuan Yue Gate in Cangwu Mountain, the gate alone was made of cast copper, the plaque used gilded characters, and the large gates painted vermilion.

Disciples were everywhere in groups of three or five, calling out to each other.

When Lin Hanyi saw Xu Yunfan looking around, a flicker of discomfort crossed her face. "My Sky Cicada Gate does not pay much attention to outward appearances. Practicality is enough."

They walked past the main hall and into the back courtyard. A lotus pond that looked rather fitting came into view. A man in cyan robes by the pond heard the movement and turned back. The jade pendant at his waist complemented the book in his hand.

"Senior Brother!"

Lin Hanyi stepped forward and paid her respects, explaining Xu Yunfan's origins and handing the token to the Senior Brother.

"This is Senior Brother, Ning Wuque."

Xu Yunfan followed suit, cupping his fist in salute. "Greetings, Senior Brother."

Ning Wuque smiled like a warm, smooth ink jade, rubbing the token in his hand.

"So it was Senior Uncle Liu who recommended you to become a disciple. I haven't seen him for many years. I wonder how he is doing."

"He is doing quite well," Xu Yunfan said.

Ning Wuque nodded slightly. "That is good. It just so happens that the Master is adjusting his breathing. It will be about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea. Why don't we sit for a while?"

Xu Yunfan glanced at Lin Hanyi. She was silent for a moment, then nodded in agreement.

*It seems the atmosphere in this Sky Cicada Gate is a bit off.*

"Little Junior Sister, serve our guest some tea."

When Ning Wuque turned to call out, a silver chain on his wrist jingled softly. A figure in goose-yellow, who had been hiding behind a tree, emerged in response. Under her skirt, a dagger was strapped to her calf.

Chu Xuan came over with a clay bowl, smiling sweetly. As her fingers brushed the rim of the bowl, half a fingernail's worth of medicinal powder dissolved into the tea.

She looked up, her apricot eyes shimmering with moisture. "Senior Brothers, you work so hard practicing, so I specially added some astragalus. Sir Guest, please have a drink."

Lin Hanyi suddenly snatched the bowl and drank it all in one go. As she swallowed, the muscles on the side of her neck bulged.

The porcelain bowl shattered on the bluestone. Her single eye stared at the packet of medicinal powder that fell from the Junior Sister's sleeve.

"This is the fifth time."

"It wasn't on purpose..."

Chu Xuan looked as if she were about to cry, tugging on Ning Wuque's sleeve. However, the left hand hidden behind her back made a throat-cutting gesture at Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan's expression didn't change at all, but he found it strange that this Junior Sister's hostility was so inexplicable.

Ning Wuque smiled helplessly. "She is the Master's youngest daughter. She's been spoiled since she was a child, but her nature isn't bad. Brother Xu, please don't take it to heart."

"Brother~"

Chu Xuan pouted and pushed Ning Wuque's shoulder, acting spoiled. In a place Ning Wuque couldn't see, she raised her chin, looking triumphantly at the unhappy Lin Hanyi and the expressionless Xu Yunfan.

*Too much of a green tea bitch.*

"..."

The time it took to drink a cup of tea passed in a flash. Most of the talking was done by Ning Wuque. Lin Hanyi would occasionally interject a sentence, and Chu Xuan's words carried a hint of needles, clearly targeting Xu Yunfan.

Lin Hanyi checked the time and spoke up. "Senior Brother, isn't it about time?"

Ning Wuque nodded slightly and handed over the token. "Just take him there."

Lin Hanyi nodded, said nothing, and led Xu Yunfan directly past the two of them, through the corridor.

Watching Xu Yunfan's retreating figure, Ning Wuque slowly stood up. A strange light flashed in his eyes, and his ever-smiling expression settled down.

"Brother, that guy picked quite a time to come over."

Chu Xuan was a bit distressed. "We have to find a way to drive him away."

"He is a man recommended by Senior Uncle Liu. Don't say any more."

"..."

Passing through the corridor, Xu Yunfan finally met the current master of the Sky Cicada Gate, Chen Tiangang, in the back hall of the gate, before a hanging portrait of the founder.
