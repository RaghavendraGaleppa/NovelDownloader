# Chapter 314: The Ice Cube Lulls Him to Sleep, The Peerless Hero

Ying Bing had been contemplating the Divine Will until evening.

She was now only a hair's breadth away from the Five Apertures of Divine Observation, having fully grasped three-tenths of the Hundred Birds Divine Form.

That might sound like little, but each of those thirty-plus extreme forms was something an ordinary person would spend a lifetime comprehending. Yet, she did not feel this was particularly fast.

In this life, her path had been far less winding.

But some obstacles, as long as she intended to move forward, she would inevitably have to face.

For instance, the Jade Phoenix God.

That was an object the Demonic Summoning Sect was determined to obtain, and it was also something she could not give up.

"Why hasn't he returned yet?"

Ying Bing looked at the empty tables and chairs, rubbing the big-headed doll at her waist, then pushed the door and went out.

But before she could go down the stairs, her footsteps suddenly halted.

Most of the patrons at Jiawei Tavern were soldiers, but for some reason, business was unusually slow today.

By the corner's wine table, he sat quietly, like a soulless sculpture.

On the table before him, making him stare blankly, was a letter that could never be sent, along with half a string of copper coins.

He was originally a high-spirited, valiant youth.

Now, his solitary, wavering back looked like that of a lost, drifting wanderer.

"Heavenly Fairy Sister, your husband has been sitting there all afternoon."

"We say, quarrels in the bedroom are made up in the bed..."

The tavern's proprietress thought they had had a quarrel and spoke a few words of advice with the tone of someone experienced.

"You're back early?"

Ying Bing's ink-black eyes seemed to hold a hint of something inscrutable.

She understood him very well. Even if she didn't want to know, she could tell what was on his mind the moment she saw him.

He wasn't the type to laugh and joke while hiding another face in his heart, nor was he a difficult person to understand. Sometimes he was quite childish; his joys and sorrows were usually written all over his face.

He always makes things I like to eat...

In the end, Ying Bing gave up on the idea of cooking and quietly sat down beside him, accompanying him in his silence.

After a long while, Li Mo muttered:

"Ice Cube, the father of Fuying'zi, the one I've been looking for, is dead."

"Because a war is about to break out, he died on the road while delivering military intelligence."

Growing up in peace in his previous life, Little Li's understanding of the word 'war' was limited to books. What he saw were the heroic deeds of famous generals and sages building their merit and fame.

He never knew that behind the numbers glossed over in history were countless letters that would never reach their destination.

Lu Yi was just one of those who happened to be by his side.

The true war had not even begun yet.

Many more would die in the chaos of war.

Moreover.

This chaos was inseparable from him.

"Ice Cube, should we... not have come to the Southern Frontier from the start?"

"We never did anything bad, so why must so many people suddenly die?"

Li Mo called out to her, but it seemed he wasn't really asking anyone, as if he were asking himself.

These questions tugged at Ying Bing's heartstrings as well.

For a moment, a pain that felt both foreign and reasonable pierced her heart.

She lowered her eyes, gently took his hand and placed it in her palm, and said softly:

"The grand trend is like this. For instance, war, there is no right or wrong, only 'should' or 'should not'."

"Perhaps it is only because someone arrived earlier or later."

In her previous life, the beast tide orchestrated by the remnants of the Great Shang Dynasty had also erupted, but it was after the fall of the Qingyuan Sect.

Not to mention Qingmu City, even the Southern Pass was breached, and the beasts ran rampant all the way to Yunzhou.

"A family of some means... a young hero..."

Li Mo glanced at the dozens of copper coins, then at the already opened letter.

The letter was long, but the meaning was simple; it asked for nothing more than safety.

"But I can't even protect the safety of a single small family..."

Ying Bing 'en'-ed, gazing into the youth's eyes, and said:

"Words are pale and powerless. What passes is called experience."

"Once experienced, one learns to grow up."

The girl's voice was soft and slow.

Li Mo opened his mouth as if to say something, then turned his head to look at her. She seemed to make one see moonlight flowing in this night shrouded in dark clouds.

He had wanted to ask Ying Bing if she had long known a war would break out, if she had long known what would happen in the Southern Frontier.

But upon seeing those eyes, he felt there was no need to ask anymore.

She knew.

Ever since he made his wish for peace and happiness to the Jade Phoenix God, she knew.

Li Mo finally understood that at that moment, she had understood the weight of that wish better than he did.

She was waiting for him to grow up.

"Ice Cube, what do you plan to do?"

"The same as you."

"Ice Cube, I'm so tired."

"Then sleep. Just sleep peacefully."

In the cold, quiet tavern.

Suddenly, a song like an orchid in a secluded valley began to flow, graceful and melodious.

"The sky is dark, dark, as if rain is about to fall..."

"The sky is dark, dark, dark..."

The night sky, covered by dark clouds for so long, seemed to want to listen, as the moon peeked through a sliver of clouds.

The ray of moonlight that secretly shone through happened to illuminate her, who was singing the nursery rhyme, and him, who was sleeping on her lap.

...

The next morning.

In front of a sugar painting stall, Tiger was no longer the king of the kids, but he occasionally managed his grandfather's sugar painting stall, giving him control over the pot of syrup. His status needed no further explanation.

He was crouching seriously in front of a stone slab, practicing sugar painting with a small pot of syrup, surrounded by a group of little kids waiting for candy.

"Tiger-ge, you said our big brother is a famous hero on the Hidden Dragon List?"

"Number eleven? What was his name... The 'Wife-Pampering Fighting Soul'?"

"Is that really our big brother? Big brother is truly big brother, even his nickname is so unique."

"Is it true or false? Big brother didn't trick us, did he?"

Hearing the doubts, Tiger immediately became displeased.

He pointed at the drawing on the stone slab and said:

"Big brother was so awesome back then, can't you tell from my drawing?"

The little kids shook their heads; all they could tell was that it looked delicious.

After all, Tiger had just started learning to draw. His scribbles were barely recognizable as a candy figure with a big head and a small body. It wasn't awesome at all; in fact, it looked a bit comical.

"I'm friends with your big brother, can I get some candy for free?"

A voice suddenly came from the side.

No need to look; someone who could be this broke could only be our Mount Brother.

Actually, Huang Donglai wasn't poor; he just never kept money. He meticulously converted all his money into practical items, after all, money can't be eaten, nor can it knock someone out.

"You're big brother's friend?" Tiger looked at Huang Donglai with suspicion.

"He is."

Hearing this familiar voice.

Tiger and the group of little kids, including Huang Donglai, were all stunned.

They turned around and saw not far away, Li Mo, with a smile on his face, as sunny and cheerful as ever, but with an added sense of restraint and gentleness.

"Big brother!"

"Brother Li?"

"Donglai, you know a war is about to break out, yet you're still staying here? That doesn't seem like you."

Li Mo greeted the little kids and asked casually.

Huang Donglai took the candy ball Tiger offered him: "I wanted to try the taste of candy... Aren't you the same?"

"I plan to leave."

"Huh?"

Huang Donglai looked at Li Mo.

A war is imminent; it's human nature to protect oneself. Yet, he felt this didn't seem like Li Mo either.

"But I'll be back soon, so I have a favor to ask you."

Li Mo's voice suddenly became inaudible; it wasn't that it got quieter, but he was using voice transmission.

"Fill it up? The whole thing? How much money would that take..."

Huang Donglai's eyes widened.

"Heaven has given me talents for a purpose; a thousand gold scattered will return."

As the words fell, clouds and mist instantly arose.

Mist swirled and enveloped, instantly hiding the youth's figure. When it dissipated, he was gone.

The Somersault Cloud does not value lightness of the body, but lightness of the heart.

If the heart is light, the world is vast; where can one not go?

"Tch, the syrup really is quite sweet."

Huang Donglai looked at the spot where he had vanished and muttered to himself.

Tiger, on the other hand, widened his eyes and waved his fists, shouting:

"What did I tell you? What did I tell you!"

"Big brother rides a seven-colored auspicious cloud, how could he not be a peerless hero?"
