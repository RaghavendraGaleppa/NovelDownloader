# Chapter 206: What Kind of Sword Genius Are You? A Delayed Reputation Collapse?!

The young woman’s crimson skirts fluttered like a peony about to bloom, with the occasional glimpse of her shapely legs visible beneath the fabric.

Her willow-leaf brows were furrowed as she scanned the area, looking as though she was itching for a fight.

She was not alone; several familiar faces trailed behind her.

Hmm?

Shang Wu’s gaze stopped.

“My precious disciple?”

“...Master.”

Li Mo knew who it was the moment he heard that tone, though he had a moment of doubt.

“Master, where did you get the money to rent out the entire restaurant?”

“Naturally, the Sect paid for it.”

Qian Bufan and Xue Jing also walked up the stairs, and Tang Xiaobao even waved a greeting to Li Mo.

“So it’s you guys.” Shang Wu frowned, looking somewhat disappointed.

“...” Ignoring his beautiful master who was in a bad mood because there was no fight to be had, Li Mo turned his head.

“Elder Qian, Elder Xue, the Ziyang Mansion is far from Yunzhou. How did you arrive so quickly?”

Xue Jing chuckled, “You two little rascals caused such a huge stir. Our Qingyuan Sect doesn’t have a foundation in Yunzhou. Even though Hengyun Sword City isn’t far, this old man couldn’t rest easy.”

“We rode the war chariot, traveling day and night, burning two whole Xuan Crystals just to arrive this morning.”

Qian Bufan seemed a bit heartbroken over the cost.

“I see.”

Li Mo and the fellow disciples present felt a warmth in their hearts, deeply moved.

When it came to major matters, the elders were still quite reliable.

Although our Qingyuan Sect isn’t a grand faction like Hengyun Sword City, we possess bonds that they lack!

“Master, didn’t you say there was another reason?”

Tang Xiaobao asked somewhat confused.

“You said our Qingyuan Sect hasn’t had such a moment to shine in years. How could we not be present to act cool when we’re shocking the world and showing off our prestige...”

*Slap—*

Elder Xue, his face expressionless, gave Tang Xiaobao a light rap on the head.

The latter covered his head aggrievedly. That was exactly what the Master had said when they set out, after all.

He still needed to open the last orifice to achieve perfection and mature his mind.

Tang Xiaobao felt that the adult world was too complicated.

Li Mo: “...”

Everyone: “...”

It was rare for them to be moved, and it was ruined just like that.

The elders took their seats, and everyone tacitly ignored the minor awkwardness from earlier. The atmosphere became harmonious once again.

After taking a couple of sips of tea, Xue Jing said casually, “I originally intended to have Xiaobao notify you. I didn’t expect you to pick such a perfect spot.”

“I spent a great deal of money to rent out this restaurant.”

Qian Bufan looked at the shimmering lake, taking the Dragon Gate entirely into his view, and no longer felt the pain of spending the money.

“A poor family should prepare rich for a journey. Since we have a disciple about to make the Hidden Dragon List, we can’t lose face.”

He then snorted, “It’s just that the owner here isn’t very honest...”

“That’s right!” Shang Wu nodded and called over the waiter. “Get your boss over here!”

The waiter scratched his head and ran to Li Mo’s side. “Boss, she’s calling for you.”

Shang Wu: “?”

Qian Bufan: “...”

Why hadn’t he taken Li Mo as a disciple back then? Was it because the direct disciple slots were full?

Why didn’t he just kick one out?

Right at that moment.

The lively shores of the Fish Dragon Lake erupted with a series of gasps.

Li Mo looked toward the sound and saw the magnificent Dragon Gate emitting a faint, multicolored light.

The light wasn’t blinding, and the seal script on it remained clearly visible, gradually forming a screen of light.

Its presence was no less imposing than the three great suns hanging in the sky.

“This doesn’t seem like a method a martial artist could possess.”

Li Mo sighed.

It was no wonder that throughout the vast Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, everyone trusted the news from the Heavenly Derivation Sect.

This scene made it hard not to be convinced.

---

Once the Dragon Gate entered Ying Bing’s view, she suddenly no longer found it so grand and magnificent.

She stared at the seal script on it, calm and composed, yet deep in thought.

It looked somewhat familiar?

Jiang Chulong pinched the corner of her clothes, her gaze wandering aimlessly for a moment before she finally gathered the courage to look up.

The elders and the others were all somewhat tense.

They all knew that the two little ones were guaranteed to make the list, but they didn’t know what rank they would hold?

Not long after.

Words began to flicker on the screen of light, written with vigorous and flowing strokes, sharp as hooks and iron.

**[Hidden Dragon List, Rank 100: Huang Donglai.]**

**[Martial Arts: Five Orifices of the Observing God Realm, Great Mastery of the Wind and Cloud Legs, Great Mastery of the Five Poisons Scripture. Also领悟了 Hengyun Sword City’s Vertical Cloud Movement Technique, and trained a high-grade body-refining method, the Xuan Turtle Body, to perfection. Exceptional movement technique, strong physical body, and formidable poison arts.]**

**[Battle Record: Has exchanged blows with numerous experts in the Eight and Nine Orifices of the Observing God Realm, such as the River-Interval Spear and the Ten-Thousand-Mile Eagle... etc., and escaped unscathed from all. Has neither won a clear victory nor suffered a defeat. Has killed many opponents of lower realms, and holds multiple identities...]**

**[Title: Flying Poison Twin-Faced Turtle.]**

“...”

The bustling shores of the Fish Dragon Lake fell silent for an instant.

It was well-known that those who could登上 the Hidden Dragon List were all prodigies.

But upon seeing Huang Donglai’s nickname, everyone felt that his existence had lowered the prestige of the Hidden Dragon List.

However, there was no denying it...

The guy was indeed quite strong; even experts in the Nine Orifices couldn’t do anything to him.

But the way he was strong was a bit strange...

Li Mo: “...”

What the hell is a Flying Poison Twin-Faced Turtle.

“Hahahahaha...”

Shang Wu laughed until her body shook like a flower in the wind, then asked, “My precious disciple, did you meet this person at the Martial Arts Summit?”

“I did. We even exchanged blows.”

Li Mo recalled the other party’s slippery movements.

“How would you rate him?” Shang Wu said.

“Annoyingly tanky while also incredibly fast. As for damage... the Summit banned the use of poison, or I would’ve lost my patience and smashed him with my hammer.”

Li Mo said seriously.

“You defeated a Five Orifices expert using only your sword?”

Xue Jing and Qian Bufan exchanged a glance.

They weren’t unaware of what had happened in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.

But while Li Mo’s swordsmanship was exquisite, it shouldn’t be enough to defeat a prodigy on the Hidden Dragon List by five orifices, right?

What if he used his divine weapon?

Xue Jing suddenly remembered that they still didn’t know what Li Mo had领悟ed at Hengyun Sword City. They had even planned to visit to thank him.

“Xiao Mo, what martial art did you悟after observing the sword mark?”

“...”

Li Mo blinked, thought for a moment, and said, “I was just a step away, truly only a step away from becoming a Sword Genius.”

Unfortunately, the elders and ancestors of Hengyun Sword City didn’t agree.

“Hmph, isn’t the Sword Genius little Bing’er?”

Shang Wu thought her precious disciple was bragging. “What kind of Sword Genius are you?”

“Naturally, I’m not a Sword Genius. I’m ashamed to say, but the people in the city now call me a Sword Immortal.”

“You... Sword Immortal...”

Shang Wu’s almond-shaped eyes were full of suspicion.

“Sigh, why did I just rent out a restaurant? There should be plenty of good wine here...”

Shang Wu’s face lit up with a smile. “To be honest, the title of Sword Immortal is well-deserved.”

There you have it.

When you eat someone’s food, you’re soft-hearted; when you take someone’s gifts, you’re weak-handed.

Her master’s dignity was barely hanging on...

Li Mo was laughing, but suddenly his expression froze.

Wait.

The Hidden Dragon List was so detailed; it would announce the greatest strength of those on the list.

His greatest strength wasn’t his swordsmanship.

Doesn’t this mean that the reputation collapse might be delayed...

But it was bound to happen?!

In the flickering light of the Dragon Gate, it had already announced the eighty-fifth name.
