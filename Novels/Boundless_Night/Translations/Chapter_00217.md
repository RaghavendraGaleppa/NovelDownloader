# Chapter 217: Pummeling Old Cao

Li Qingxu's scalp tingled with dread. That was his master, Cao Qianqiu, revered by all for a generation. Yet someone dared to be so disrespectful and challenge his authority. For a moment, he wanted to rush forward to defend his sect's honor and prevent anyone from offending them. However, reality was cruel. He was no match. Even his master, who had mimicked the Heavenly Radiance Energy for his attack, couldn't block the opponent's fierce hammer technique. He could only force himself to remain calm, standing still where he was.

Cao Qianqiu spoke with extreme indifference, "It's been many years since anyone dared to challenge me. Youth is truly wonderful; always so vigorous, full of fearlessness. But you also die very quickly."

If Qin Ming had been at a disadvantage, his mind might indeed have been unsettled. However, he had just shattered Old Cao's great hammer and was in a position of strength, a smile on his face. He said, "I finally understand. Your lineage is very good at 'mouth-hammering'—all talk, no action—and quite skilled at putting on airs!"

For many years, Cao Qianqiu had maintained a high-and-mighty demeanor, arrogant, overbearing, and ostentatious. He had acted without restraint his entire life, possessing the capital to make most of his words come true. His disciples, however, were merely swinging empty hammers. In the distance, Li Qingxu's face alternated between ashen and pale. He was powerless to step forward and refute with actions, leaving it to his master to personally intervene.

The half-shattered hammer handle in Cao Qianqiu's hand erupted with a bang. Runes expanded outwards, re-forming into a great hammer, enveloped in the Pure Yang-attributed "Heavenly Radiance Energy," appearing exceptionally intimidating. His dominance had become an instinct. For years, he had traversed the world, always piercing through various opponents, never knowing the taste of defeat. Thus, he once again wielded his hammer for battle. He did this, naturally, to suppress his opponent in the very domain they excelled at.

Qin Ming said nothing, gripping his Dragon Serpent Hammer as he advanced. To deal with this old lunatic, the best response was to pummel him into submission in actual combat. Cao Qianqiu's spiritual body seemed weightless, but once it moved, its power was unmatched. A slight tremor of his great hammer instantly caused the air to explode. In an instant, he traversed the air, as if carrying a colossal mountain, its hammer body emitting terrifying roars with every slight sway.

At this moment, Qin Ming deeply "respected" this elder. He had to use all his strength to pummel him, his entire body's Heavenly Radiance Energy surging through his skin, as if burning, its light intensely brightening. With a single leap, he covered over twenty meters, arriving in an instant, swinging his hammer to strike. He met Old Cao in mid-air, like a meteor hurtling down.

"Clang!"

A deafening sound erupted in this area. Not to mention the Heavenly Radiance Energy, the sheer impact of the air currents alone shattered the surrounding remnants of the forest.

"Elder, I respect you greatly. Have a hundred of my hammer strikes first!" Qin Ming declared.

In an instant, the two rapidly clashed, neither giving ground. This entire area suddenly seemed like two colossal mountains colliding, shaking the earth and mountains. Heavenly Radiance Energy intertwined, as if countless bolts of lightning were being unleashed. In a flash, they exchanged over a dozen hammer blows. As Qin Ming landed from mid-air, Cao Qianqiu immediately dove down, following up with another strike. The ground could be seen cracking open, massive fissures half a foot wide spreading in all directions.

The two fought at an incredible pace, moving like lightning. Most critically, their strength was incomparably fierce, their destructive power astonishing. Wherever they passed, boulders shattered, and the remaining trees turned to dust. They fought their way to the hillside, where the slopes were completely torn apart. The ground resembled a spiderweb, crisscrossed with cracks. Any obstacle they encountered was obliterated.

"Elder, your strength is considerable! How exhilarating! Don't stop, that's only forty-something strikes, let's go again!" Qin Ming declared, wielding his Dragon Serpent Hammer, his Heavenly Radiance Energy boiling as he leapt high into the sky, smashing towards his opponent.

Cao Qianqiu's face twitched slightly. His great hammer had shattered again.

"Weren't you going to counter-attack me in the domain I'm most proficient in? Please, don't waste time!" Qin Ming shouted after landing, raising his hammer.

Cao Qianqiu dove down. This time, he landed on the ground, re-forming his great hammer with runes, and fiercely clashed with his opponent. But this time, it lasted even shorter; after only a dozen or so strikes, his weapon completely shattered.

"What's happening? They're fighting fiercely again! Is that Li Qingxu's Pure Yang Conscious Spiritual Light? Why is it so powerful?!" Within the Secret Realm, people on various peaks were all shocked. On the Immortal Path and God Path, besides Li Qingyue, the seeds of various paths like Cui Chonghe and Su Shiyun all showed grave expressions, already suspecting that the light was Cao Qianqiu.

"Don't run, again!" Qin Ming bellowed, pursuing him with his great hammer.

Cao Qianqiu's silver hair flew, his aged face utterly cold. How many years had it been since his dominance was overturned, and by a mere youth wielding Heavenly Radiance Energy at that! For years, he had harbored thoughts of capturing the Patriarch of the Neo-natal Path as a laborer once he made another breakthrough. Yet, now, in a clash at the same level as a 'newcomer', he was actually struggling. This caused his facial muscles to twitch.

Cao Qianqiu's silver hair fluttered. His great hammer began to exhibit lightning, wind, fire, and earth energies. His aura surged, and this entire area seemed to resonate with him. Around him, winds and clouds stirred, fine rain drizzled, and lightning intertwined. Qin Ming sighed inwardly. This was the Hegemon's secret technique, one Old Cao had studied, and now he was actually using it. He didn't know whether to laugh or to feel sorrow for the Hegemon. At this juncture, there was nothing more to say. He was going to pummel Cao Qianqiu with all his might!

Qin Ming fought like a madman. Although he was circulating the "Dragon Serpent Scripture," he was using the Silk Scroll Method to unleash numerous fused Heavenly Radiance Energies, erupting completely. After multiple collisions, Old Cao's hammer had shattered for an unknown number of times. Moreover, this time he didn't dodge, taking a hammer blow from Qin Ming. His Pure Yang Conscious Spiritual Light violently trembled, his entire body twisting and blurring as he was sent flying. Normally, if he had a flesh-and-blood body, his injuries would undoubtedly be far more severe than this.

Qin Ming moved like lightning across the sky, pursuing him. His Dragon Serpent Energy burst forth, like a dragon soaring, allowing him to fly for brief periods.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

In that instant, he continuously swung his great hammer, repeatedly smashing Cao Qianqiu. For a time, Old Cao was incredibly disheveled; even his hammer handle was gone. No matter how strong or overbearing he was, he had to grudgingly admit that by only using "Heavenly Radiance Energy," he was no match for this youth.

"Don't retreat! We haven't reached a hundred strikes yet, again!" Qin Ming, caught up in the thrill of the fight, used his "adhesion energy" to grab the large sleeve that Old Cao had formed from his Pure Yang Conscious Spiritual Light, pulling him closer. At the same time, his other hand, wielding the Dragon Serpent Hammer, forcefully smashed forward.

Li Qingxu was shocked. He watched as his master took four consecutive hammer blows from his opponent, sending him flying and dimming his entire body. At the last moment, Cao Qianqiu severed his large sleeve, sacrificing a portion of his Pure Yang Conscious Spiritual Light. Even so, that arm of his was still smashed apart. At the same time, the youth delivered a follow-up hammer blow with utmost speed, sending him flying dozens of meters away, his entire body splitting apart. Fortunately, this was his Pure Yang Conscious Spiritual Light; it could reassemble after shattering.

His face was grim. Even in his youth, he had never suffered such a defeat, always sweeping aside opponents. How was it that in his old age, fighting someone on the same level, he was repeatedly pummeled by the youth before him? His combat experience, wisdom, understanding of various scriptures, and his Pure Yang-attributed Conscious Spiritual Light should have made him inherently undefeated. However, reality was this absurd. The youth before him countered all techniques with sheer force. That kind of Heavenly Radiance Energy was too overbearing; in this First Realm, it very likely surpassed the Three Imperial Energies.

Qin Ming called out, "Elder, you must keep your word! You said you'd shatter me in the domain I'm most proficient in. Come on, we're only a dozen or so strikes short of a hundred."

Cao Qianqiu's face was utterly cold. He said, "In this domain, you have won."

Li Qingxu felt as if the sky had fallen. His master, who had been invincible his entire life, making enemies from all directions bow their heads, was actually being pummeled by a youth here today. The crucial point was, this demonic youth was an opponent *he* had provoked!

"Master!" At this moment, Li Qingxu felt like a sinner for having caused his master such humiliation and a devastating loss.

"What's the situation? That battle just now was so intense, I can't quite believe that was Li Qingxu!" Many on the various peaks were skeptical, yet deeply shocked. Li Qingyue secretly sighed in relief, then couldn't help but smile. Cao Qianqiu was actually being pummeled. Cui Chonghe, Cai Jingcheng, Su Shiyun, and others, after guessing it was Old Cao, saw the result of this initial battle and their expressions all became incredibly serious.

"Then use your Immortal Path methods!" Qin Ming said directly.

Li Qingxu clenched his fists. The demonic youth's tone was so aggressive after confronting his master.

Cao Qianqiu spoke blandly, "Heh, in some eras, there were indeed some latecomers who sought to make a name for themselves through me, Cao Qianqiu. But in the end, they were all turned to dust by me." Immediately after, dense runes appeared before him, forming a precious mirror. In an instant, Pure Yang energy boiled.

Just then, Cao Qianqiu's expression subtly changed. His body was descending, landing on the ground, unable to float in mid-air anymore. He gazed at the void, speaking coldly, "You dare interfere with this old man's affairs?" Clearly, if he had a physical body, he wouldn't be able to fly in mid-air in the First Realm at all. He was now being restricted by the Heavenly Demon Mirror.

Qin Ming smiled, then directly charged forward.

Cao Qianqiu's expression was indifferent. The mirror he had condensed with runes in his hand erupted with a dazzling beam of light, shining towards Qin Ming. This was the Body-Illuminating Mirror. Its surface had tens of thousands of runes, using Pure Yang as blades, specifically designed to slay the physical bodies of demons and 'newcomers'. Heavenly Radiance flowed in Qin Ming's left hand. He emulated his opponent, forming a mirror from Heavenly Radiance, incorporating divine wisdom and conscious spiritual light within it for defense. This mirror was like a golden blazing sun, exceptionally brilliant. It instantly blocked the opponent's Pure Yang light, transforming the sharp blades into flames that burned in place.

"Hm?!" Cao Qianqiu's brows furrowed deeply. He had forgotten that he was currently in the First Realm, and facing such Heavenly Radiance Energy, which surpassed the Three Imperial Energies, it was indeed difficult to pierce through.

Qin Ming held the Blazing Sun Mirror in his left hand and his great hammer in his right, stomping the ground into shards as he charged forward at extreme speed. The Body-Illuminating Mirror in Cao Qianqiu's hand continuously shot out terrifying beams of light. Their Pure Yang attribute was incredibly intimidating; anyone else would have been directly pierced by these beams. However, Qin Ming either used the mirror surface as a shield to block them or directly shattered them with his great hammer. He reached close quarters. In a series of clashes, he shattered the Body-Illuminating Mirror and once again smashed Old Cao with his Dragon Serpent Hammer.

Cao Qianqiu was enraged. When had he ever suffered such a setback? Runes bloomed all over his body, and he moved like a Pure Yang Phoenix, engaging Qin Ming at extreme speed. However, as the strong winds blew, the youth swung his great hammer, actually making him struggle to cope. The youth in the First Realm was incomparably divine and courageous. Wherever his great hammer struck, Cao Qianqiu's Pure Yang Conscious Spiritual Light trembled, cracking open multiple times.

Boom!

Cao Qianqiu was sent flying. The youth pursued, smashing down hammer blow after hammer blow.

Li Qingxu's eyes nearly popped out. That was the invincible master in his heart! Today, he had been pummeled repeatedly, and now, he was even smashed in the chest, sent flying dozens of meters away. Cao Qianqiu's face was as cold as frost. His body had already shattered before. He realized that if he had a physical body and lacked Pure Yang consciousness, he would be in grave danger! His gaze was chillingly cold. He believed this youth could not be left alive! With a thud, his head took a heavy hammer blow, rapidly splitting open.
