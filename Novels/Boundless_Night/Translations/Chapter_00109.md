# Chapter 109: Refining the Golden Cicada with Lihuo

The youth possessed large, fan-like hands, feet over a foot long, legs as thick as pillars, a waist comparable to a bear's, a neck like a tree stump, and a head as big as a basin. His black hair was as stiff as steel needles, and he had thick brows, big eyes, a wide mouth, and a square nose.

Qin Ming, holding his great pike, had just sent a man flying when he saw the oddly-featured youth emerge from the snow-white bamboo forest.

“Great, come help!” Qin Ming wasn't sure if the youth was speaking to him, but it cost nothing to reply. He was already seeing red from all the killing.

The surrounding golden-armored guards immediately became highly vigilant of the youth. Some nearby even launched preemptive attacks.

The burly youth was truly formidable. With a sweep of his fan-like hand, an Outer Saint rushing him was instantly sent flying, shattering a large bluestone.

“Everyone, don’t be so aggressive. We all rely on physical mutations to increase our strength. We’re all cultivators of the same path, so why start fighting and killing right away?” the youth advised.

Then, with a loud *smack*, his fan-like hand slapped another Outer Saint, who was swinging a blade at him, sending him flying.

“Pfft!”

The Outer Saint who crashed into the pristine white bamboo forest coughed up blood, his face deathly pale. If not for his protective golden armor, he would surely have been blown apart.

“Are you all sick?! I told you not to be so impulsive, yet you’re still rushing me?!” The thick-set youth was extremely indignant.

With a *crack*, his right foot lashed out with lightning speed, kicking a spear that was thrusting at him, breaking it and sending its wielder flying twenty meters away.

A large patch of snow-white bamboo was shattered. The expert holding the broken spear vomited blood, staining many of the pure white bamboo leaves red. His chest glowed, mystical patterns flowing across it.

Clearly, his protective armor had worked, otherwise he would have been utterly annihilated, torn to shreds by a particularly powerful Heavenly Radiance Energy.

“This is a decisive battle between core disciples from the Outer Realm, it has nothing to do with you guys. Can’t we all just be a bit more civil?” the youth complained again.

Then, swift as lightning, he leaned back, slamming into another approaching expert, whose face distorted, blood oozing from his seven orifices. The man crashed into the pristine white bamboo forest, unable to get up.

Everyone looked at him differently. He spoke of civility and not being aggressive, but his attacks were remarkably heavy. Without special life-saving armor, anyone hit by him would have exploded into pieces.

“Brother, thanks for the help,” Qin Ming said, secretly asking for his name.

“Xiang Yiwu,” the burly youth replied.

Qin Ming had a deep impression of this person because his physique was too unique.

From head to toe, there was no part of Xiang Yiwu that wasn’t thick. He was as wide as two people, not fat, but excessively sturdy.

They had even exchanged words back in Luofu Immortal Town. Qin Ming had once asked him who the Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata was, who the Yuqing Energy successor was, and if any disciples of the Five Elements Palace were present.

Xiang Yiwu had shaken his head then, claiming he didn’t know.

Now, Qin Ming strongly suspected that this person was either the Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata or the Yuqing Energy successor!

“Brother, I’m not actually a pushover. Everything depends on fate,” Xiang Yiwu said, rubbing his hands, a bit embarrassed.

The two now stood together, temporarily deterring the group of golden-armored guards. Although they were surrounded at the edge of the bamboo forest, no one launched an attack.

In fact, the group retreated, not daring to get too close.

Qin Ming naturally understood that a mere acquaintance wouldn't offer help for no reason.

He said, “Just tell me what you need.”

Xiang Yiwu nodded. “Brother, you’re straightforward, so I’ll be direct too. I once saw you fighting Cui Chongxuan from afar. I truly desire and long for your special energy art.”

Qin Ming’s pupils constricted slightly. This burly youth had too big an appetite.

“Don’t misunderstand, I’m not trying to kick you while you’re down or take advantage of your predicament.” Xiang Yiwu waved his hand. “I can exchange it with a cultivation art of the same level. To be honest, I really need the Lihuo Scripture.”

Qin Ming was surprised. The burly youth had extraordinary insight; Qin Ming had already integrated the Lihuo Energy, yet this person could still recognize it.

Seeing Qin Ming didn't deny it, Xiang Yiwu immediately became excited. “You really have the Lihuo Scripture? Don’t worry, I won’t let you suffer a loss.”

Qin Ming asked, “You must have mastered Tathagata Energy or Yuqing Energy, right? With such legendary cultivation arts, why would you still need the Lihuo Scripture?”

Xiang Yiwu frankly replied, “I cultivate the Golden Cicada Art. Currently, I need a fire-attribute miraculous art to assist me. My sect elders helped me deduce that, at this stage, refining the Golden Cicada with Lihuo is the best. It symbolizes breaking out of the shell, being reborn, soaring to the sky, and also has the auspicious effect of nirvana through fire.”

Qin Ming’s gaze changed as he looked at him. The cultivation art this person practiced was definitely not simple. And as the other party said, he only needed the Lihuo Scripture for now; he would certainly integrate other miraculous arts later.

“Acquaintances call me Golden Cicada Son,” Xiang Yiwu smiled.

“Which core disciple are you helping?” Qin Ming asked him.

“An elite disciple. He tricked me; the fire-attribute scripture he gave me was very ordinary,” Xiang Yiwu said, sounding indignant.

“Then forget about him. How about we cooperate?”

Qin Ming was very worried about Li Qingyue now; she was being besieged by five core disciples.

Moreover, judging by the way these people had intercepted him, they clearly intended to kill both him and Li Qingyue outright.

Xiang Yiwu nodded. “I’ve already sent that elite disciple away.”

Qin Ming was startled. “You killed him?”

Xiang Yiwu shook his head. “I just knocked him out.”

Qin Ming realized that this person likely had a significant background and practiced a special cultivation art, meaning he shouldn't be weak in the second major realm.

“Help me save someone, and I’ll give you the Lihuo Scripture!”

“You want me to provoke five core disciples? That’s too dangerous.” Xiang Yiwu didn't agree.

“Just open a gap, help her break through the encirclement!” Qin Ming told him that he possessed more than one miraculous art.

Xiang Yiwu said, “I only need the Lihuo Scripture. Let me go take a look. If there’s an opportunity, I’ll act; if not, don’t blame me.”

He quickly departed, disappearing into the bamboo forest.

Qin Ming suspected that the Golden Cicada Art this person cultivated might be a part of the Tathagata Energy or Yuqing Energy, and he was currently expanding his scripture collection.

The Yuqing Energy, Qingtian Energy, and Tathagata Energy had never stagnated. It was said that they were constantly being improved and enhanced, and the contents on the true inheritance scrolls were not immutable.

“If Xiang Yiwu is truly a successor of such an ancient orthodoxy, he shouldn't fear Outer Realm disciples in the first two major realms.”

Qin Ming’s own situation was precarious. The golden-armored guards were pressing in from afar, tightening their encirclement.

“Gentlemen, why go to such lengths? Perhaps we can sit down and talk…”

Soon, Qin Ming stopped speaking. He lacked deterrent power, and the people surrounding him saw that his Heavenly Radiance Energy couldn’t be projected outward, so they wanted to capture him.

Most importantly, there were organizers among them, and a few were death-seekers. He had to kill this small group for the crisis to be resolved.

“Since someone wants to die, I’ll grant their wish!” Qin Ming was enraged.

The battle erupted once more!

…

At this time, the outside world was abuzz with discussion, speculating that Li Qingyue might acquire the near-immortal artifact.

Night reports were commenting on her, praising her, and even building momentum around her.

Meng Xinghai’s heart sank. He knew the inner workings of such things: the more intensely something was hyped, the more likely something would go wrong. Li Qingyue might be “dealt with.”

“Someone wants to eliminate Qingyue and coincidentally make a profit on the betting table?”

Earlier, Meng Xinghai had been intoxicated by Qin Ming’s achievements, as if drinking fine wine, but now he felt that both of them might be in danger.

…

Qin Ming was injured. Among the golden-armored guards of the five core disciples, there were indeed experts. Their Heavenly Radiance Energy projection was astonishing, like raging flames burning, or a scorching sun radiating light.

He was shaken, his qi and blood surging, blood trickling from his mouth. His opponents were suppressing him with higher realms.

“Tan Yu!” Qin Ming recognized this person.

Back in Luofu Immortal Town, people had discussed this man. He was from Luoyue City, and it was rumored that he had integrated more than ten types of Heavenly Radiance Energy even in the nascent stage.

“Outer Saints who are talked about are indeed very dangerous!” Qin Ming wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.

At present, not only Tan Yu was attacking, but others were also besieging him. Qin Ming’s great pike was even knocked to the ground.

Tan Yu found it unbelievable. He was stronger than ordinary Outer Saints and wanted to crush a nascent cultivator with his higher realm, yet his palm was pricked and oozing blood.

Qin Ming took a deep breath. He didn’t pick up the pike or draw his blade. All the Heavenly Radiance Energy arts he had learned appeared one by one in his sea of consciousness.

He was proficient in blades, spears, arrows, hammers, and pikes, but he was actually more adept at Heavenly Radiance Energy arts, and his combat skills were no weaker than those who had left behind secret manuals.

Qin Ming activated his Wind Energy, his feet seemingly not touching the ground as he swept across the grass blades, striking at Tan Yu.

In the instant of approach, he transformed from being light as wind to erupting like thunder, blasting towards his opponent with Hammer Energy, causing the bamboo forest to resonate with terrifying sounds of wind and thunder.

Tan Yu sneered. He precisely intended to suppress Qin Ming with his higher realm. As the saying goes, one strength conquers ten techniques. This was exactly it.

In addition, an expert no weaker than him followed closely, and others also attacked simultaneously, wanting to quickly deal with this strange nascent cultivator.

Qin Ming instantly changed trajectory, brushing past Tan Yu’s fist, which was like a small sun. He applied Binding Silk Energy to his palm, touching Tan Yu’s arm, and with a sudden pull, made his opponent stumble.

Of course, Qin Ming himself wasn’t feeling good either, because the opponent’s protective Heavenly Radiance Energy was too intense. When he broke through, he was constantly impacted.

With a *bang*, as Tan Yu stumbled, Qin Ming launched a high roundhouse kick, using Whip Energy, striking towards his opponent’s head.

Tan Yu turned his body, dodging the blow to his head, but his shoulder felt as if it had been struck by an iron whip, making him even more unstable.

When others attacked, strands of golden light appeared on Qin Ming’s body. That was the Golden Silkworm Energy in operation, allowing him to forcefully withstand the fists and kicks of four people. He continued to relentlessly attack Tan Yu.

Of course, he avoided the terrifying palm of the expert whose strength was similar to Tan Yu’s; this person’s Heavenly Radiance Energy was surging, making him a dangerous individual.

Qin Ming’s Binding Silk Energy and Sticking Energy never left Tan Yu, making him extremely uncomfortable, as if he were trapped in a swamp, unable to exert the full effect of his immense strength.

A moment later, Tan Yu grunted. A large piece of flesh and blood from his palm was torn off by the Sticking Energy.

Moreover, his facial protective gear was inexplicably knocked open, and with a *boom*, his face was hit by a punch. Heavenly Radiance Energy surged in, leaving half his face a bloody mess.

Qin Ming himself was also pale, his hands dripping blood. He was being besieged, focusing solely on attacking Tan Yu. It was impossible for him not to pay a price.

His golden armor was already partially shattered, because its protective runes had been activated once. This was definitely a life-and-death battle.

Half an hour later, Qin Ming drew his blade. The mutton-fat jade iron blade pierced Tan Yu’s armor, whose protective runes had also been activated and had since dimmed.

“You…” Tan Yu was horrified, but powerless to struggle. His heart was pierced, and he quickly died.

Qin Ming swayed as he looked back. After such a long clash, many of the opponents’ armors had also activated those runes, and they had all extinguished.

He roared and charged forward.

Ultimately, the expert whose strength was similar to Tan Yu’s was beheaded by him. With the two strongest individuals dead, the true organizers and death-seekers here were gone. The others turned and fled, no longer fighting to the death.

Qin Ming had gone berserk. Dragging his tired and injured body, he began to pursue, his blade striking true, killing those who had just围攻 him. Not until silence completely settled here, with the dead lying still and the living having fled, did Qin Ming gasp for air, then collapse onto the ground.

His armor was shattered, and he was covered in blood. If anyone delivered a fatal blow now, he would surely die.

As for the dead, the runes on their golden armor had also been activated.

“The battle in the distance isn’t over yet?” Qin Ming gazed into the depths of the bamboo forest.

“Brother, hurry!” Soon after, Xiang Yiwu rushed over, saying, “They’ve gone crazy! Core disciples almost died!”

“Where’s Li Qingyue?” Qin Ming asked.

Xiang Yiwu quickly replied, “She’s gravely wounded. She used a secret technique that almost killed two core disciples, making the others extremely wary.”

“I’m asking you where she is, how she is, and if you made a move?” Qin Ming asked urgently.

“I didn’t have time to get involved. Everyone there had gone completely insane, using forbidden arts from the Outer Realm. Six clusters of colored light were fusing together; it was a desperate, mutual destruction of conscious spiritual light. If I had charged in physically, their combined spiritual light would have annihilated me,” Xiang Yiwu said, ashamed.

He quickly added, “Don’t worry, Li Qingyue escaped. She actually managed to break through the encirclement in the end. The remaining few were very wary of her, and since they believed she was severely injured and couldn’t contend for the near-immortal artifact, they didn’t pursue.”

Qin Ming immediately got up and chased in the direction Xiang Yiwu indicated.

At the same time, he speculated that Li Qingyue might have fled towards the place with abundant vitality. Earlier, when they passed through there, she had mentioned that her ancestor had made some arrangements there a thousand years ago.

…

Indeed, Qin Ming found traces of Li Qingyue’s blood in the place of abundant vitality. He softly called her name there.

“I’m here.” Li Qingyue was very weak. Her powerful divine sense had allowed her to detect Qin Ming, who had been searching for her.

“Qingyue, how are you?” Qin Ming quickly rushed over and supported her arm.

“It’s bad. If another core disciple appears, we’ll both die,” Li Qingyue said, extremely weak, leaning against a large tree.

Her silver armor was already shattered, and her body was covered in blood.

“Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata, stay away from here. Come back in half a day,” Li Qingyue said, looking at Xiang Yiwu in the distance.

“Don’t misunderstand, I’ll leave immediately. I’ll come find Brother Li in half a day to exchange miraculous arts,” Xiang Yiwu said decisively before departing.

Li Qingyue’s face was pale, with a frail, delicate beauty. She secretly transmitted, “Search carefully in this area. There might be a special ‘Mountain and River Spirit Nest.’ My ancestor discovered and arranged it. If it’s still there, it can help us heal, and even advance further.”
