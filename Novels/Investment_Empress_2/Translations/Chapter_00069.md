# Chapter 69: Star Child Pestle, Li, the Time Management Master, and Mo (1/2)

“That’s all for now. Thank you for your help.”

“Alright. I suggest you eat these fresh, Junior Brother. Don’t store them for too long.”

“Oh? Executive, you have such insights? It seems we are kindred spirits.”

“You flatter me.”

“I’ll go back to cook now. Let’s have hotpot together when we have time.”

Li Mo cupped his fists toward the Executive.

And so.

Amidst the stunned gazes of everyone present.

Little Li, carrying two baskets of exotic beast meat, casually walked out of the Outer Affairs Hall.

“Senior Brother, how did you know which exotic beasts are delicious?”

An Outer Sect Executive mused thoughtfully.

The Inner Sect Executive who had recommended so many things to Li Mo earlier gave him a profound look.

“You’re asking too many questions today.”

........

Autumn Water Pavilion.

By the time Li Mo returned, it was already noon.

Time was tight, but he was skilled in the kitchen, and the Ice Cube hadn’t returned yet; only Shang Wu was in the pavilion.

After feeding his Master, he went to the front of the waterfall.

“玄兵器胚 (Xuan Weapon Embryo).”

Li Mo looked at the soft metal sphere in his palm, bouncing like a slime.

It could replicate a weapon based on a template, and it would definitely be an ultimate-grade Xuan Weapon.

If he used the Panjie Meteorite Hammer as a template, it would likely be an extremely weakened version.

Perhaps something like the Chixiao Sword compared to the Fankong Sword?

But it should be more powerful than the Chixiao Sword; he had heard others mention that the Chixiao Sword is a high-grade Xuan Weapon.

Thinking of this.

Li Mo took out the Chixiao Sword and walked behind the waterfall.

“Fire Crane Thousand Feathers!”

He swung his sword at the thick rock wall.

The sword technique at the Mastery level paired with a Xuan Weapon had an exceptional effect.

It cut through the rock like tofu. The cut stone materials were directly stored in his Little World, and a ‘cave dwelling’ was quickly carved out.

“Hoo...”

“I’m much stronger than when I first applied the World Seed.”

“After taking it out, I should have enough energy to put it back.”

Li Mo took a deep breath.

There was no other way; the physical changes granted by the Little World couldn’t be applied to the outside world.

He couldn’t train with the Panjie Meteorite Hammer inside the World Seed.

He had to take it out.

*Hum—*

The surrounding air vibrated.

In that instant.

The divine strength that made one resent the heavens for lacking a handle reappeared.

Compared to the first time, Li Mo was much more proficient.

The cave he had carved was instantly filled with the sharp aura of weapon killing, leaving traces of sword and blade cuts on the granite walls.

Without wasting a moment, he immediately took out the Panjie Meteorite Hammer.

Holding the divine weapon again, a strong throb resonated from the bottom of his heart.

Instinct made him want to vent the primordial power immediately.

But Li Mo held back.

Reason told him that he would have a hard time bearing the consequences of swinging this hammer.

He gently placed the hammer on the ground before canceling the World Seed’s enhancement.

“Hoo...”

Li Mo was drenched in sweat and let out a long breath.

A sense of weakness came from his body, but it was better than fainting directly like last time.

*Hum—*

The Panjie Meteorite Hammer vibrated twice, excited to come out and play like a child.

“Beat...”

Getting excited.

It wanted to hammer something.

Activating the Mastery-level *Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body*, Li Mo wiped his sweat and said:

“Be good, we need to be a civilized divine weapon.”

“A civilized divine weapon shouldn’t strike easily. It’s one thing if it hurts people, but it’s bad if it hurts the flowers and grass too.”

*Hum—*

The Panjie Meteorite Hammer responded with short, rapid vibrations.

As Li Mo’s realm deepened, the Little World’s area grew larger. Aside from lacking living beings, it was much more comfortable than the Divine Blade Cave.

“Don’t move around randomly.”

Li Mo nodded in satisfaction.

After speaking, he covered the Panjie Meteorite Hammer with the Xuan Weapon Embryo.

*Hum—*

The mercury-like liquid metal enveloped the entire hammer and began to vibrate violently.

---

The Xuan Weapon Embryo was simulating and imprinting the form, spirit, and aura of the Panjie Meteorite Hammer, bit by bit.

Of course, it was limited to the level of a Xuan Weapon.

“Hope it doesn’t disappoint me.”

Li Mo watched for a while, then sat down cross-legged.

It had been a long time since he practiced the *Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body*.

Now that he could take the divine weapon out and put it back, tempering his physique would naturally be an indispensable part of his daily routine from now on.

Hammer techniques place extremely high demands on physique and vital energy.

Unknowingly.

The sunlight outside the window dimmed.

A figure walked out from behind the waterfall. The crashing waterfall water steamed into rolling white mist on his body, making him look like a freshly forged weapon.

After becoming the master of a divine weapon, training with the Panjie Meteorite Hammer again yielded progress visible to the naked eye.

His physical body was already moving toward the next level.

But having applied the World Seed twice, he was exhausted all over.

“Luckily, I cooked dinner at noon.”

Little Li let out a long breath.

He didn’t stop. He dripped a drop of Millennium Earth Vein Spirit Milk into the pool.

After lying down in it,包裹ed by the Earth Vein Essence, the fatigue in his body finally eased.

He activated the Fire Heart Lotus Bloom Method.

Only then did Li Mo have the time to take out the newly imprinted hammer for a close look.

“The appearance isn’t much different from the Panjie Meteorite Hammer.”

“The aura is quite similar, just much, much weaker.”

“Hmm...”

“The Panjie Meteorite Hammer Youth Mini Edition?”

Little Li felt this name was a bit too long.

On second thought, wasn’t this just the son of the Panjie Meteorite Hammer?

“I’ll call you the Star Child Pestle from now on.”

.....

Five days passed in a flash.

Little Li has been very busy recently.

Training himself, tempering his body, and refining his vital energy.

He also had to find time to feed the Ice Cube and the beautiful Master in the Autumn Water Pavilion.

At night, he couldn’t rest either; he had to satisfy the tireless Princess Jiang.

From time to time, he also had to have in-depth exchanges with the Ice Cube... about the Way of the Sword.

“I’m a damn time management master.”

One evening, Li Mo dragged his weary body back to the Autumn Water Pavilion again.

He poured a pot of water and gulped it down.

He sat down at the stone table and sighed:

“I don’t want to move. I really don’t want to cook today...”

“A man is iron, and food is steel. My dear disciple, how can you not eat when you’re so tired?”

Shang Wu supported her chin with one hand, speaking righteously.

Li Mo glanced at her. *Then would you mind doing it, Master?*

Shang Wu raised her chin, proud as can be: “Your Master knows nothing about cooking.”

?

So what are you proud of?

At that moment.

The Ice Cube spoke up:

“Then how about I go...”

“No need! x2”

Master and disciple spoke in unison.

Shang Wu, who was on her deathbed, sat up in shock. Li Mo’s physical fatigue was instantly swept away as he dashed into the kitchen with a flash.

The Wind Shadow Step finally had its use.

“Little Bing’er, didn’t you practice in the Ice and Fire Pool all day today? You should rest well.” Shang Wu was afraid she might actually go.

Ying Bing, who was sitting quietly drinking tea, furrowed her delicate brows:

“I meant we could ask the Inner Affairs Hall cafeteria to send some food over.”

The highest alert in Autumn Water Pavilion was lifted.

Shang Wu breathed a sigh of relief and looked Ying Bing over, suddenly noticing something was off. She said in surprise:

“Little Bing’er, the vital energy in your body has become perfectly unified.”

“Are you about to break through?”

She meant a major realm.

Ying Bing nodded slightly. Her jade-like face showed little fluctuation, her tone as light as the tea in her cup:

“Tonight.”

Many martial artists are stuck at the Internal Breath Realm for their entire lives, unable to enter the next stage.

But for a path she had already walked in her past life, she wouldn’t encounter any bottlenecks.

It was nothing more than completing the great circulation of the twenty-four meridians’ vital energy and borrowing the power of the Great Yin to break through the Internal Breath Realm.

To her, it was just a trivial bit of progress, nothing worth mentioning.

She was breaking through tonight to prevent any unforeseen circumstances.

She had to be ranked first on the System’s list.
