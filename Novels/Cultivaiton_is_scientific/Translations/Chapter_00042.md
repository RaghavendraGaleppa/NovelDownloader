# Chapter 42: Warning

Li Shiming carefully organized all his items into his machine room space. The storage bags had limited capacity—each could only hold about one cubic meter of items.

His current priority was processing the spiritual plants he had purchased. This was the most crucial matter.

The chances of survival for these root-only spiritual plants were already slim. Any further delay would eliminate even that small possibility.

Within the machine room space, his consciousness focused on the plant roots and two branches. The branches had no leaves, only five protruding buds. Based on these characteristics, he couldn't identify the plant species—it wasn't mentioned in the "Basic Spiritual Farming" book he had.

From the size and shape of the roots, he guessed it was likely a shrub-type spiritual plant. Drawing from the IBM z15 mainframe's database, he found information on soilless nutrient solutions for shrubs and grafting techniques.

First, he prepared a sterilizing solution using chemical methods, thoroughly cleaning the roots—especially the broken sections. Then he placed the roots in a shrub-specific soilless nutrient solution and cast the "Spring Rain Technique" to nourish them.

Next, he grafted the two branches onto the root stumps. Within the controlled environment of his machine room space, he could manually create sterile conditions for the plants through conscious control.

After completing these steps, whether the spiritual plant would survive was now up to fate.

Just as he was about to study his newly acquired spells, footsteps approached outside his study.

"Siqin, what is it?" Li Shiming asked with a slight frown. He had given strict orders not to be disturbed while in his study.

"Young master, Elder Gu is waiting in the reception hall," Siqin replied softly.

"I'll be right there!" Li Shiming quickly stored his items and stood up to leave. He had instructed everyone in the household that Elder Gu was to be admitted immediately without announcement—he didn't want a repeat of last time when a respected sect cultivator had to wait outside the gate.

"Greetings, Elder Gu!" Li Shiming bowed respectfully upon seeing Gu Jia.

"Seeing you safe puts my mind at ease," Gu Jia replied with a smile. After Li Shiming took his seat, he continued, "There was trouble at the market today—two Hao family cultivators were killed. Avoid going to the market for the time being."

Gu Jia had received a message that a powerful cultivator had killed two Hao family members outside the market and left without difficulty. While he would normally intervene if such incidents happened inside the market (as he was responsible for its security), matters outside were none of his concern.

However, remembering that he had just told Li Shiming about the market, he had come personally to warn the young man, fearing he might encounter the dangerous cultivator.

"Thank you for the warning. Actually, I don't have much spirit stones to spare anyway—I only wanted to visit the market to broaden my horizons. Given the danger, I'll stay away," Li Shiming said with an expression of shock.

"Next time I go to the market, you can accompany me," Gu Jia offered after some thought.

"Elder Gu, this Hao family you mentioned—are they very powerful?" Li Shiming asked curiously.

"The Hao family? They're barely considered a low-level cultivation family. Their strongest member only reaches the sixth level of Qi Refining. To my knowledge, they had seven cultivators—well, five now. Their main business is making talisman paper, with some low-level talismans as a side product," Gu Jia replied with slight disdain.

"Are there many such cultivation families in Zhongdu?" Li Shiming pressed.

"Only five qualify as cultivation families. The rest are just independent rogue cultivators. The spiritual energy around Zhongdu is too sparse—any cultivators living here can't be very powerful. The strong factions are all in areas with richer spiritual energy," Gu Jia explained.

This gave Li Shiming a clearer picture of Zhongdu's cultivation scene. It made sense—without his Spirit Gathering Plate, he could barely cultivate at all. Areas further from human settlements might be slightly better, but the spiritual energy would still be lacking. Cultivators living in such places were practically surviving in the secular world—it would be strange if they were powerful.

He then asked Gu Jia several questions about spiritual energy usage—all critically important to him. Gu Jia, who seemed to think highly of Li Shiming, answered each question in detail. Of course, Li Shiming avoided asking anything too secretive, sticking to general applications of spiritual energy.

After Gu Jia left, Li Shiming couldn't hide his excitement. The elder's answers had been immensely helpful.

Standing in the center of his room, Li Shiming struck out with his palm toward a paperweight on his desk. As he did so, he channeled spiritual energy from his energy vortex through his palm. His hand remained a full meter away from the paperweight, yet the released energy transformed into a gust of wind that blew the object off the desk—shattering it into wooden fragments before it even hit the ground.

Li Shiming stared at his palm in astonishment. He hadn't used any spell—this was purely the result of manipulating raw spiritual energy. It seemed cultivators didn't necessarily need spells—their spiritual energy alone possessed formidable destructive power.

Similarly, channeling energy into his legs didn't match the speed boost from a "Lightfoot Talisman," but it still multiplied his running speed several times over.

Of course, these were the most basic applications of spiritual energy. Spells and magical artifacts could unleash its full potential. Magical artifacts, for instance, were inscribed with special rune arrays that produced specific effects when activated by spiritual energy.

Understanding and activating these rune arrays wasn't something that could be explained in a few sentences—it required formal sect training. While Gu Jia was optimistic about Li Shiming's future, he wasn't his master and wouldn't impart such specialized knowledge. That he offered any guidance at all was already a significant favor.

Unaware of cultivation society's norms, Li Shiming didn't realize how precious knowledge was in their world. Until he formally joined the Tianhai Sect, such teachings would remain out of reach.

This knowledge gap explained why sect cultivators were typically far stronger than rogue cultivators. While equipment and spells played a role, rogue cultivators' lack of foundational knowledge was equally important—the same artifact might perform very differently in the hands of a sect cultivator versus a rogue one.

In the following days, Li Shiming divided his time between monitoring the spiritual plant in his machine room space and studying his new spells. The three technique manuals purchased for twenty spirit stones—"Lightfoot Technique," "Fireball Technique," and "Telekinesis Technique"—required repeated attempts. Using the IBM z15's vast video and image database as sensory playback devices, he gradually grasped the essence of each spell.
