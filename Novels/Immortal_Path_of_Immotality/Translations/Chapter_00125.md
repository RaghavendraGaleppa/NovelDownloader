# Chapter 124: The Lotus Hermit

In the following days, Lin Shan performed his curses punctually every day.

He had to admit—this was truly addictive.

Three curses a day simply weren't enough! After exhausting his daily quota, he'd itch all over, eagerly awaiting the next day.

To his surprise, Bear Mountain Master, being at the mid Foundation Establishment stage, narrowly escaped death each time yet stubbornly survived. Lin Shan couldn't help but admire his unyielding willpower.

Through his pre-curse observations, Lin Shan noticed that Bear Mountain Master kept flying over the vast ocean as if heading toward a specific destination. After repeated sightings, Lin Shan deduced it was likely to the southeast.

No matter how tenacious Bear Mountain Master was, the relentless daily curses gradually wore him down. Lin Shan, ever the opportunist, always timed his curses for midnight when the man was stealthily traveling. Each time Bear Mountain Master barely suppressed the curse's effects, he'd find his flying spiritual tool had already fallen into the sea.

In just ten days, he lost ten mid-grade spiritual tools—amounting to two or three thousand spirit stones! Soon, he faced the predicament of lacking suitable flying tools. With all his mid-grade tools lost and low-grade ones unable to sustain sword flight, he had no choice but to resort to standing on his set of flying needles.

Bear Mountain Master was truly resourceful. While only high-grade tools could change size, he managed to balance on needle-thin flying tools for another ten days despite the curses, losing and replacing them along the way.

By then, his aura had drastically weakened. Red fur covered his body like steel needles, and dozens of purple tentacles flailed wildly. Passing cultivators and demonic beasts took one look and fled in terror.

Yet, after persisting for so long, he finally reached his destination.

Bear Mountain Master wasn't a fool. When the curses first appeared, he realized someone was targeting him from afar. With his long history as a pirate leader, his enemies were countless—Lin Shan didn't even rank among them.

But he knew how insidious these curses were. Even his backer, the Golden Core protector of the Black Lotus Sect, likely couldn't help. As a last resort, he flew desperately toward the southeast.

"Bitter Vine Island."

This island was home to the only Nascent Soul-stage rogue cultivator in the Eastern Sea—the Lotus Hermit.

If anyone could break his curse, it was this five-hundred-year-old legend, before whom even the four-hundred-year-old Turtle Sage paled in comparison.

On the twenty-first day, Bear Mountain Master, driven by sheer willpower, finally glimpsed Bitter Vine Island in the distance. Knowing the dangers of trespassing on a Nascent Soul cultivator's domain, he had no choice—without taking this risk, death was certain.

Staggering, he flew into the island and collapsed beneath a bodhi tree, where a gray-robed elder calmly watered vegetables.

...

Back in his cave, Lin Shan, after his usual cultivation session, drew the curtains and prepared for another round of curses. Humming, he nocked an arrow—only to find Bear Mountain Master no longer flying over the sea.

"Strange..."

Had he run out of tools? Unlikely—Lin Shan had meticulously calculated the man's possessions. Even if he'd lost all his flying needles, shouldn't he still have his Six-Petal Plum Blossom Nails? And that half-broken spiked club could've lasted another day!

Had Bear Mountain Master heard Lin Shan's thoughts, he might've throttled him for such callousness. But now, he lay unconscious on a straw mat in a thatched hut—miraculously free of red fur and tentacles.

Lin Shan was stunned. Over twenty days, he'd witnessed how tenacious those afflictions were. For them to vanish entirely... Bear Mountain Master was full of surprises.

Just as Lin Shan prepared to resume his curse—

*Clang!*

The arrow bounced off harmlessly. Lin Shan's consciousness snapped back to his cave. The arrow hadn't struck the straw effigy.

"What just happened?"

He hadn't noticed anything obstructing the shot earlier. Puzzled, he tried again—this time watching closely. As the arrow flew, a yellow barrier materialized and deflected it.

*Clang!* The arrow clattered to the floor.

Lin Shan experimented repeatedly, confirming the issue wasn't with the tools. Whenever he targeted Bear Mountain Master, the effigy developed a protective barrier.

"A shield against curses?" 

The *Seven Nails Arrow Book* wasn't some minor technique—it was a sect-suppressing divine ability! In the cultivation world, only another divine ability could counter one at the same level.

"Did Bear Mountain Master learn a sect-suppressing technique? Impossible. Or does he have a protective treasure? Consumed some miraculous elixir? Entered an isolation array? Or... encountered a Nascent Soul expert?"

Lin Shan's mind raced. Bear Mountain Master had stubbornly flown southeast despite near-certain death. Was there something—or someone—there that could save him?

Consulting his Eastern Sea map, Lin Shan's gaze landed on an island in the far southeast.

"Bitter Vine Island!"

His expression darkened. The island was infamous—home to the Eastern Sea's only Nascent Soul rogue cultivator, the Lotus Hermit.

A legend shrouded in mystery, even the three demonic sects tread carefully around him. The Hermit practiced Buddhist arts without taking monastic vows, dwelling in seclusion on Bitter Vine Island.

Lin Shan's heart pounded. Why would a Nascent Soul expert help Bear Mountain Master? What was their connection?

After pacing anxiously, Lin Shan steeled himself. Regardless of their ties, he still had one curse left for the day—he'd use it now!

Drawing his bow again, his consciousness returned to the thatched hut. This time, besides the barely conscious Bear Mountain Master, a gray-robed elder stood there calmly.

The elder seemed to anticipate him, addressing the empty air with measured words.

"Fellow Daoist, mercy begets mercy."
