# Chapter 41: No Refunds

But whether it was for Jian Liang's vendetta or that piece of kraft paper, Ling Hanjun had to find that person and kill him.

"Disguise techniques, huh? That could be a bit troublesome."

Zhao Chengji thought for a moment and said, "However, I can introduce someone to Brother Ling. He has extensive research into disguise techniques and might be of help to Brother Ling."

"Oh, who is it?" Ling Hanjun showed some interest.

"Xing Wenxiang, the former constable of Pingyin County," Zhao Chengji said with a smile.

The Zhao family's banquet soon concluded, and everyone departed.

The positions within the North City Medical Hall remained unchanged. Chen Fei was still the deputy manager. It seemed the Zhao family didn't have a suitable person to manage it, so it was better to keep things as they were. In the Zhao family's view, under the current circumstances, no one dared to act cunningly. The Zhang family's fate was still a clear warning.

Days passed. To everyone's surprise, after acquiring sufficient supplies, the rebels did not leave Pingyin County; instead, they stayed. The county yamen existed in name only, and the rulers of Pingyin County became the rebels.

The various aristocratic families in Pingyin County were in a predicament. They had originally thought the rebels would leave after a while, as the rebel forces in Pingyin County were just one contingent, with the main army elsewhere. No one had imagined this outcome. And due to previously annexing other aristocratic families, Pingyin County, which was not strong to begin with, was now even weaker. Resistance, naturally, was out of the question.

Move their entire families out of Pingyin County? No aristocratic family dared to do so. It would be like a household slave trying to escape—if caught, they would be beaten to death. If an aristocratic family dared to leave Pingyin County at this time, the consequences if caught would be the same. The guards at all four city gates had been replaced by rebel soldiers. Within Pingyin County, anyone with a skill or specialty was not allowed to leave. Only ordinary people with no particular skills could enter or exit Pingyin County.

The rebels seemed to be treating Pingyin County as a logistics base, or perhaps an experimental ground. After all, to grow stronger, one couldn't constantly be destroying.

The Zhao family began to station personnel in the medical hall, urging them to provide elixirs. Chen Fei's tasks became extremely numerous, and the money he received was no longer the usual share; it was only the most basic wages. The aristocratic families themselves now had reduced incomes, so how could they give more to others? The rebels squeezed them, and they, in turn, squeezed everyone else.

Chen Fei did not resist and cooperated readily with alchemy. Whenever someone from the Zhao family came and saw Chen Fei, he always appeared utterly exhausted.

Chen Fei had been staying in Pingyin County recently, where there were no ominous entities, yet his bone-deep affliction manifested such symptoms, making Chen Fei feel a tightening in his heart. Previously, Chen Fei had even thought of changing his appearance and blending in with the rebels to seize the opportunity to leave Pingyin County. He hadn't expected the rebels to stay, directly disrupting his plans.

"Have the ominous entities outside the city increased recently?" Chen Fei asked Chi Defeng in the black market.

"Yes, things have been a bit off lately." Chi Defeng nodded. He couldn't even hire refugees to go outside the city anymore. Besides the aristocratic families offering more money, many people simply no longer dared to go to Pingyin Mountain. The rebels organized teams and entered Pingyin Mountain several times but achieved no significant gains.

"If this continues, something bad will happen, won't it?" Chen Fei said gravely.
