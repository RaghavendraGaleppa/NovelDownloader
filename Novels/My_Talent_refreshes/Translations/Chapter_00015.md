# Chapter 15: The Path of Talisman Crafting

He Changyou instructed Zhuang Yunde to record the land allocations for each person on a jade slip, clearly marking the assigned spiritual fields. He then distributed seeds from his storage pouch to everyone.

However, when it came to Chu Ning's turn, He Changyou paused. "I didn't anticipate anyone choosing to cultivate Ink Spirit Bamboo, so I didn't bring the seeds with me. Come with me to fetch them."

As the two departed, the remaining disciples began murmuring among themselves.

"Chu Ning actually chose to grow Ink Spirit Bamboo!"
"Indeed, that's even harder to cultivate than Senior Brother Yuan's Purple Sweet Potatoes!"

The comments visibly irritated the usually aloof Yuan Guang. "A mere second-level Qi Refining cultivator daring to choose Ink Spirit Bamboo? Overestimating himself!"

Curious, the others pressed for details. Yuan Guang, noticing Zhuang Yunde still present, quickly composed himself and asked respectfully, "Senior Brother Zhuang, if I recall correctly, Ink Spirit Bamboo requires consistent application of the Verdant Spring Technique to meet talisman paper standards. Am I mistaken?"

The portly Zhuang Yunde nodded with a smile. "You're correct, Junior Brother. Ink Spirit Bamboo differs significantly from Red Spirit Rice. While the latter has limited quality improvement from the Verdant Spring Technique, the former shows drastic differences between treated and untreated specimens. Though it's not absolutely necessary for talisman crafting—a skilled artisan can still produce paper from lower quality bamboo—the yield would be much smaller. Thus, poor quality bamboo means submitting more to the sect, leaving little for personal use. As for Junior Brother Chu at second-level Qi Refining choosing this path..."

Zhuang Yunde trailed off meaningfully. Yuan Guang needed no further explanation, turning to the group with a triumphant look. The disciples immediately began praising his wisdom while speculating about Chu Ning's motives, all except Qiu Shunyi who appeared concerned, and Zhuang Yunde who wore a thoughtful expression.

"Let me show you to your respective fields and residences," Zhuang Yunde soon announced, redirecting the group.

Meanwhile, Chu Ning was fully aware of the challenges. His choice stemmed from his refreshed spiritual affinity for talisman crafting—he needed to establish connections in this field. As for the Verdant Spring Technique requirement, he'd prepared an explanation about his compatibility with the Evergreen Wood Technique. Surprisingly, He Changyou asked no questions, simply handing over the bamboo seeds before dismissing him.

Reflecting on the encounter, Chu Ning realized he'd been overly cautious. As a veteran overseer, He Changyou had seen countless disciples with varying talents. A second-level Qi Refining outer disciple mastering a basic technique wasn't extraordinary. While Ink Spirit Bamboo was challenging, it wasn't exceptionally rare. His current priority was determining how to access talisman crafting knowledge while maintaining low profile.

Returning to find the group dispersed, Chu Ning headed to Cao Dongxin's residence to gather his belongings. Qiu Shunyi awaited him anxiously outside. "Chu Ning! Do you realize how difficult Ink Spirit Bamboo is?" He relayed the earlier discussion hurriedly.

Chu Ning remained calm. "Thank you for your concern, Shunyi. I'll try my best. If it doesn't work out, I'll accept lower yields this season."

Sighing, Qiu Shunyi added, "Senior Brother Zhuang asked you to wait here. He'll guide you after settling the others."

As Chu Ning packed, Shang Zhaoxiang and Cao Dongxin returned from the fields. "Congratulations, Junior Brother Chu," Shang Zhaoxiang said warmly. "Your upper-grade fields exceed ours by two acres." The comment deepened Cao Dongxin's conflicted expression—their own allocation included lower-grade plots.

Chu Ning bowed politely. "I'm grateful for both seniors' guidance these past months." While Shang Zhaoxiang exchanged pleasantries, Cao Dongxin remained awkwardly silent. Chu Ning harbored no resentment—though strict, Cao Dongxin's demands had inadvertently helped him discover the cultivation benefits of the Verdant Spring Technique.

When Zhuang Yunde arrived, Chu Ning bid farewell to the trio. En route to his new fields, the rotund senior brother asked knowingly, "Choosing Ink Spirit Bamboo suggests you've mastered the Verdant Spring Technique?"

Chu Ning admitted freely, "Only preliminary mastery, requiring further practice."

Zhuang Yunde nodded approvingly. "Your proficiency with growth and cleansing techniques indicates strong wood affinity. Does your choice reflect interest in talisman crafting?"

Caution flashing through his mind, Chu Ning deflected, "Why do you ask?"

"Few choose this difficult crop," Zhuang Yunde chuckled. "As a newcomer, you must have specific motivations."

"I merely heard about its profitability for talisman paper," Chu Ning replied neutrally. "I know nothing of the craft itself."

"Patience," Zhuang Yunde said cryptically. "Let's first see how your bamboo fares." Changing subjects, he detailed solitary farming considerations before finally showing Chu Ning to his new ten-acre plot and private courtyard.

Watching Zhuang Yunde depart, Chu Ning surveyed his domain with satisfaction. "Finally, my own land—no, my ten acres of opportunity!"
