# Chapter 82: Eighth Layer Peak, Lecture Hall  

Time flowed like water.  

In the blink of an eye, three years had passed.  

The ripple effects of the true dragon's demise continued to spread, leaving the entire Eastern Mountain Domain in turmoil. Undercurrents surged as numerous sects grew restless, clashing fiercely with the demonic beasts occupying the spiritual mountains and mineral veins.  

The conflict between Luoxia Sect and the Violetgold Six-Winged Eagles escalated, drawing in multiple neighboring sects. Though both sides had their victories and defeats, Luoxia Sect held the upper hand, having conquered nearly half of the Thunderclap Mountain Range.  

Amidst the fierce battles, a Foundation Establishment cultivator from Luoxia Sect successfully formed a golden core, ascending to the rank of Golden Core Master. The event shook the land for thousands of miles, and even the Qingfeng Dao Academy sent congratulatory gifts.  

The outside world was in upheaval, anything but peaceful.  

Fortunately, the Qingfeng Dao Academy had deep reserves of strength, and within its territory, everything remained under control.  

The Hidden Dragon Courtyard, in particular, was a haven of tranquility.  

Inside Qian Yuan Cave, Gu Yuan sat barefoot and disheveled beneath the towering form of the Little Giant Divine Tree.  

The tree had grown even more robust, resembling a coiled ink-black dragon. Its thick trunk now seemed too large for the ten-zhang-high cave to contain.  

From its gnarled branches spread broad, umbrella-like emerald leaves, dozens of them layered like a jade pagoda, shimmering with a faint glow.  

Among the verdant leaves, three green fruits trembled slightly, as if eager to drop from their branches.  

"Whoosh!"  

At that moment, a sharp inhale sounded beneath the tree. One of the green fruits abruptly fell, transforming into a streak of green light that flew straight into Gu Yuan’s mouth.  

"Boom!"  

The surge of spiritual energy roared like a mighty river, reverberating endlessly through the cave. The entire chamber seemed to tremble.  

Yet the bottleneck he sought to break remained stubbornly resilient. Though the fruit’s energy was potent, it fell just short of breaching the barrier completely.  

"Ah..."  

A sigh escaped Gu Yuan’s lips. Then, another green fruit silently detached from the branch, transforming into a streak of light that vanished into his belly.  

"Boom!"  

"Crash—"  

With the second fruit consumed, the surging spiritual energy reached its peak, finally shattering the bottleneck.  

The cave’s spiritual energy churned violently, pouring into Gu Yuan like a tidal wave.  

His aura skyrocketed, his skin glowing faintly with power.  

Yet he did not open his eyes. Instead, he inhaled deeply, his mouth gaping like a whale swallowing the sea.  

"Rustle, rustle, rustle!"  

The entire Little Giant Divine Tree trembled as over thirty of its broad leaves shook free, cascading down in a dense stream of green light that Gu Yuan devoured whole.  

His already surging aura erupted once more. His spiritual energy flowed like liquid silver, thick and heavy, rolling ceaselessly until, in the blink of an eye, it reached the peak of his new realm.  

But sensing the lone remaining green fruit on the branch, Gu Yuan resisted the urge to consume it and finally opened his eyes.  

"Eighth Layer of Qi Refinement—Peak!"  

"Just one step away from the ninth layer... but that step won’t be easy."  

Feeling the dense spiritual energy within him, Gu Yuan couldn’t help but sigh.  

The further one progressed in cultivation, the more arduous the journey became.  

Since the elixirs for the seventh layer were cheaper than those for the eighth, Gu Yuan had refrained from consuming the divine tree’s leaves over the past three years. Instead, he purchased elixirs regularly and combined them with diligent cultivation to reach the peak of the seventh layer.  

His original plan had been to use one divine fruit to break through to the eighth layer, then devour all the accumulated leaves in one go, followed by two more fruits to push straight into the ninth layer.  

But reality proved uncooperative. The bottlenecks in the later stages of Qi Refinement were far more stubborn than before. A single fruit wasn’t enough to break through to the eighth layer, forcing him to consume two in succession.  

After that, he swallowed all the stored leaves in one go, finally reaching the peak of the eighth layer.  

But attempting the ninth layer’s bottleneck was out of the question for now.  

The final barrier of Qi Refinement was even more formidable than the eighth layer’s. Even with all three fruits intact, Gu Yuan wouldn’t dare to recklessly challenge it.  

"It seems I’ll need another approach."  

"At least my resources are still plentiful..."  

Gu Yuan gently rubbed the bulging storage pouch at his waist, feeling no urgency.  

Before his trip to Feilang Mountain, he had possessed eight hundred spirit stones after accounting for the purchase of golden talismans. The expedition to Feilang Mountain had yielded substantial gains, and after selling off unused items, his total had reached nearly three thousand spirit stones—a sum that would shock any ordinary disciple of modest means.  

But three years of cultivation had taken their toll.  

Daily consumption of Gathering Spirit Pills, Jade Void Pills, and Green Spirit Pills had cost him nearly eight hundred spirit stones. Without these elixirs, his five-aperture constitution would never have allowed him to reach the peak of the seventh layer in just three years.  

During this time, Gu Yuan hadn’t focused solely on cultivation. In his spare moments, he had also mastered the "Gale Seal" and "Lotus Seal" left behind in Yun Hanxiu’s storage pouch.  

These two seals alone had cost him over four hundred spirit stones.  

Yet despite the expenses, Gu Yuan still had income.  

Though he hadn’t visited Green Moon Peak this year, his trips in the previous two years had netted him seven hundred spirit stones from selling his harvest.  

After all was said and done, he still had nearly twenty-four hundred spirit stones remaining.  

This was his confidence in breaking through to the ninth layer—and even daring to glimpse the threshold of Foundation Establishment.  

"But spirit stones alone aren’t enough. Without the right method, they’re useless..."  

After a moment of contemplation, Gu Yuan summoned his jade shuttle and first visited the Heavenly Star Black Market for supplies before setting off for another destination.

**Hidden Dragon Hall, Lecture Hall**  

Though disciples of the Hidden Dragon Courtyard lacked personal mentors, they weren’t entirely without guidance.  

The Lecture Hall periodically hosted senior Qi Refinement cultivators or Foundation Establishment overseers to impart knowledge. On rare occasions, even Golden Core Masters would personally teach.  

Since the academy divided into "Offensive" and "Defensive" factions during the external campaigns, more Foundation Establishment overseers had begun frequenting the Lecture Hall. They would periodically offer insights to resolve the disciples’ doubts.  

Those who impressed the overseers or passed the hall’s trials might even receive seals as rewards.  

As a result, the Lecture Hall had been packed to the brim in recent years, with a constant stream of visitors.  

By the time Gu Yuan landed, dozens of disciples were already waiting.  

The Lecture Hall was nestled within a bamboo forest, where a babbling brook added to the serene atmosphere. Inside the hall, only sixteen meditation cushions were arranged.  

The outer chamber held seventy-two more.  

However, an unwritten rule dictated that only those seated in the inner sixteen cushions could pose questions to the instructors.  

Even among the defensive faction, competition thrived—cultivators were never truly without ambition.  

When Gu Yuan entered, all sixteen cushions in the inner hall were already occupied.  

Every single one was taken by a cultivator at the eighth layer of Qi Refinement or above.
