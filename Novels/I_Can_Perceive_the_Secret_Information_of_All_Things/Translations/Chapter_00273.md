# Chapter 273: First Trace of the Thunder Pool Sword, Entering the Illusory Long Street  

After a day and night of investigation, Xiao Ji finally identified the two individuals in question.  

He recalled reading a notice at the Eight Trigrams Square in Taigu City—two Nascent Soul cultivators had vanished without a trace while fighting over a weapon called the Thunder Pool Sword. Many had searched for them but found nothing, eventually concluding that both had departed for lands beyond the sea.  

The Thunder Pool Sword was one of the Nine Treasures. It had once been obtained by two tomb-raiding brothers whose luck had been both extraordinarily good and catastrophically bad. These two Qi Refining tomb raiders had stumbled upon fragments of the Thunder Pool Sword one after another, eventually piecing them together to restore the complete weapon.  

From the day the fragments merged, their luck ran out. They began quarreling over ownership of the sword and eventually sought judgment from two Nascent Soul experts… only to be killed by them on the spot. Thus, the sword passed to two new contenders.  

"So they ended up here," Xiao Ji mused.  

The two Nascent Soul cultivators hadn’t come here willingly—they had been brought by the Thunder Pool Sword itself. This spoke volumes about the sword’s power and danger.  

The Nine Treasures sword had once belonged to the master of this secret realm, the Hundred Weapons Realm. Its owner had met his end because of it, ambushed and killed outside the realm, with the Thunder Pool Sword shattered into fragments.  

This was also why the Hundred Weapons Realm had been abandoned—its master was gone.  

From this, it seemed the Thunder Pool Sword had deliberately lured the two Nascent Soul cultivators into this death trap, further proving that the sword possessed a unique consciousness—one distinct from human thought, a spiritual awareness unique to magical artifacts.  

Stumbling upon the Thunder Pool Sword here felt like fate to Xiao Ji, and fate was something to be cherished.  

He had been wondering where to find the next fragment of the Nine Treasures, and now it had practically fallen into his lap.  

Truly exhilarating.  

"Taoist Master, could you stop looking at me like that? Honestly, my courage isn’t that great," Fan Dali said nervously. "Before we came in, I already said I only need a few magical artifacts from this realm to grind into medicine. If you’re unwilling to spare even one, I’ll leave now."  

A Golden Core cultivator wouldn’t dare harbor even a hint of greed in front of a Nascent Soul expert.  

Xiao Ji adjusted his expression and said apologetically, "Brother Fan, don’t be afraid. I was just thinking of something amusing."  

The Hundred Weapons Realm had its own weather system. At the moment, it seemed to be autumn, with a cool breeze brushing past—neither too cold nor too hot, just right.  

Zhao Jiuzhou caught a falling leaf and said, "Brother Xiao, there are nine paths ahead, all leading to that small city. Shall we take the middle one?"  

Now, whether it was a major or minor decision, Zhao Jiuzhou always sought Xiao Ji’s advice.  

"Take the rightmost path," Xiao Ji instructed.  

"But all nine paths seem viable, and the middle one is the shortest. Why not take it?" Fan Dali was puzzled.  

Though his cultivation was inferior to Xiao Ji’s, he was still a Golden Core cultivator—a level that would earn him at least an elder position in any sect.  

Golden Core cultivators weren’t exactly common, but Xiao Ji now moved in higher circles where Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators would only be walking to their deaths. In smaller places like the Nine Nether Valley, Qi Refining cultivators dominated, with few even reaching Foundation Establishment.  

Before Xiao Ji could answer Fan Dali’s question, Zhao Jiuzhou tossed out a small magical tool. The device clattered and transformed into a mechanical cart, rolling forward along the middle path.  

Not far in, a barrage of deadly traps and hidden weapons struck the cart, shattering it before a series of explosions finished it off.  

"The Hundred Weapons Realm was clearly the work of an ancient master of artifact forging. These people don’t just refine weapons—they set traps too," Zhao Jiuzhou explained knowingly, as he was also an artifact refiner.  

Witnessing the scene, Fan Dali began regretting his decision to seek out this realm. The still-smoking wreckage on the middle path made him fear the same fate.  

He had heard of secret realms being guarded, but seeing it firsthand was terrifying.  

As Xiao Ji and Zhao Jiuzhou headed for the rightmost path, Fan Dali called out anxiously, "What if there are traps on that path too?"  

"There won’t be," Zhao Jiuzhou replied without looking back.  

"Why not?"  

"Because he chose it," Zhao Jiuzhou said, pointing at Xiao Ji’s retreating figure before following without another word.  

Fan Dali hesitated but ultimately decided to stay. Secret realms were rare, and being among the first to enter the Hundred Weapons Realm was an opportunity—even if he gained little, it would make for a great story.  

The three proceeded in silence, reaching the city gates unharmed.  

The gates were sealed, protected by a formation.  

For a Nascent Soul cultivator like Xiao Ji, bypassing the formation would be easy, but Zhao Jiuzhou and Fan Dali couldn’t. So Xiao Ji had to force an opening.  

With a thunderous crash, Xiao Ji blasted the gates open.  

"Forgive the rudeness, but this was the only way in," he explained mildly.  

Stepping inside, they surveyed the city.  

Every building was a blacksmith’s forge, filled with the clanging of metalwork.  

"This realm’s architecture is… monotonous," Fan Dali remarked.  

"Expected, given its master’s craft," Zhao Jiuzhou said.  

"Strong demonic aura," Fan Dali noted, sensing something amiss.  

Xiao Ji remained silent. He had already discerned the city’s nature before entering.  

The Hundred Weapons City had been masterless for countless years. The artifacts forged here had developed spiritual awareness over time, and some had mutated.  

Thus, a rusted sword growing legs and attacking made sense.  

A sword suddenly leaped from the ground, charging at Xiao Ji—running, with legs but no arms, stabbing with its blade.  

Xiao Ji flicked a strand of spiritual energy, shattering the sword into scrap.  

Nearby, a spiked mace hesitated, then flopped back down, playing dead.  

**[This sentient mace is desperately hoping you don’t notice it, repeating internally: Don’t see me, don’t see me…]**  

Xiao Ji stomped, snapping the mace in two.  

The spiked end writhed on the ground.  

Another stomp flattened it completely.  

A wisp of demonic energy dissipated.  

Silence fell over the city. The clanging ceased, leaving an eerie stillness.  

"This realm is too bizarre," Zhao Jiuzhou muttered. "Swords growing legs, weapons developing souls… How do we take these things? Even if we do, they’re unusable."  

"Agreed," Fan Dali said, eyeing the twitching remains of the mace.  

Xiao Ji glanced at it. "No matter. The Hundred Weapons Realm has become corrupted, its artifacts demonized. We just need to crush their twisted spirits. Besides, you only need the materials, not their forms. We can melt them down for you to reforge later."  

Fan Dali’s eyes gleamed at the sheer confidence in Xiao Ji’s words—melt them down? The man spoke of reshaping the entire realm’s artifacts as if it were nothing.  

But where did this confidence come from? Nascent Soul cultivators were formidable, but even they couldn’t casually dominate a secret realm. These were treasures left behind by ancient powerhouses, filled with untold dangers.  

Take the Thousand Lakes Realm, developed by the Dao Alliance two centuries ago. Three Nascent Souls and a Soul Transformation expert had worked together, deploying hundreds of disciples and countless artifacts over thirty years to fully explore it.  

Now, it served as a training ground for new Dao Alliance members.  

But that was beside the point.  

Secret realms weren’t simple. Early entry only meant first pick of the treasures.  

"Where do we start?" Zhao Jiuzhou asked, lost.  

Xiao Ji pointed down a street. "To catch the thief, first catch the king. The same applies here. Though the realm has no master, the corruption has a source."  

"At the end of this street is the lead demon of the Hundred Weapons Realm."  

"To reach it, we’ll face three obstacles. But it’s manageable."  

Xiao Ji waited for their input.  

After a pause, Zhao Jiuzhou said, "Brother Xiao, why not just cut through with a single strike? Faster cleanup means fewer competitors. We only need the materials, not the intact artifacts."  

Destroying the city from the outside was an option, but not now.  

Each forge housed demonic artifacts, forming an intricate formation. Destroying it would erase everything.  

They were here for treasures, not to leave empty-handed.  

In Xiao Ji’s eyes, at least ninety percent of the realm’s artifacts were worth taking. The demonic spirits could be purged, leaving usable materials.  

Zhao Jiuzhou glanced at Fan Dali, expecting him to contribute.  

"I’ll take whatever you spare," Fan Dali said, sticking to his earlier stance—take only a few, or risk death.  

Ancient realms weren’t meant to be conquered lightly. Xiao Ji alone understood the connections between the forges. The only way to claim everything was to follow the intended path.  

Every secret realm had one—its creator had to leave a way in and out.  

Unless, of course, the creator had sealed it as their tomb. But that was rare.  

"This street may seem short, but once inside, it’ll feel endless," Xiao Ji warned. "It’s an illusory path. Three barriers await. Break them, and we’ll reach the end."  

With that, he stepped forward.  

The clanging resumed as they entered the street.  

To Xiao Ji, the true danger lay in the forge at the end—where the two Nascent Soul cultivators who had fought over the Thunder Pool Sword now resided, their minds enslaved by the realm.  

For him, this wasn’t a concern. But Zhao Jiuzhou and Fan Dali wouldn’t survive it.  

They would inevitably fall into the illusions. He’d rescue them when needed.  

Once inside the final forge, all would be resolved.  

Xiao Ji was confident. He had already analyzed the realm and predicted its dangers.  

Entering the street meant entering the illusion.  

Xiao Ji found himself alone in a vast kitchen, his companions gone.  

Since it was an illusion, there had to be a way out. Just as he began searching, a burly chef barged in.  

"The customer wants fried rice with scallops. Hurry up," the chef snapped.  

The man was clearly unnatural. Xiao Ji’s first instinct was to obliterate him and shatter the illusion.  

**[You could kill the chef, but you’d be trapped here for a thousand years.]**  

Too costly.  

"Just a thought," Xiao Ji muttered, turning his attention to the fried rice.
