Chapter 219: Approaching Perfection [Two Chapters Merged]

Cao Qianqiu broke the restrictions of this place, intending to kill the young prodigy before him.

The Heavenly Demon Mirror immediately reacted, as if a blazing sun had exploded, blinding golden light blasting downwards. Cao Qianqiu seemed to be traversing space-time, actually evading this heaven-punishing blow. In this mountainous region, large expanses of rock were torn apart like paper, turning into scattered debris.

Cao Qianqiu's silver hair fluttered, his Pure Yang Feather Robe rustled, murderous intent surged from his heart, and his power rapidly soared. His gaze was like divine flames, captivating and awe-inspiring. Then, two golden beams shot out, forming tangible immortal swords that hummed and vibrated, aiming to slay the youth whose talent seemingly surpassed that of the Patriarch.

In the sky appeared a broken mirror with a missing corner, etched with intricate patterns, radiating brilliant light, yet covered by white mist, making it hard to see clearly. In an instant, winds roared and thunder boomed. The void was filled with characters, descending with a sky full of golden light, crushing the two immortal swords formed from his gaze.

"You dare obstruct this old man's actions!" Cao Qianqiu waved his large sleeve, his silver hair flying, his eyes like lightning, inscribing runes in the air. In an instant, the entire void roared and trembled, as if it would collapse at any moment.

One had to admit, as a great villain of the Immortal Path generation, who had intimidated the Nightmist World for so many years, Cao Qianqiu's Dao arts were indeed heaven-reaching. A mere wisp of his Pure Yang light could manifest such power. However, the Heavenly Demon Mirror's origin was unfathomable, suspected to be related to the creatures described in the "Kunling Divine Records." In an instant, it continuously unleashed golden light. For a moment, the area was as if ten suns hung in the sky, golden crows cried, and in the blink of an eye, Cao Qianqiu's might plummeted; the characters he had inscribed in the void were erased. After all, he was not his true body; for a wisp of spiritual light to possess such means was already defying the heavens. With a bang, he himself took several hits, then was submerged by the golden light.

"Opposing me, do you wish to summon this old man's true body and sink this Secret Realm?" Cao Qianqiu continuously teleported, but it changed nothing. Wherever he appeared, he would be submerged by the light beams emitted by the broken mirror. Even a Pure Yang spiritual body could not withstand such an attack. Amidst sizzling sounds, he seemed to be corroded, his conscious spiritual light shattering, burning, and rapidly dimming.

At the crucial moment, he split off a faint wisp of light, flying towards Li Qingxu, wanting to tell him some truth and carry the message out. Cao Qianqiu, at this last juncture, vaguely sensed through his Pure Yang body that the youth whose talent seemingly surpassed that of the Patriarch might stir up endless storms in the future, proving detrimental to him.

However, the Heavenly Demon Mirror acted according to rules. Though mechanical and dull, its execution power was formidable, and it coldly and mercilessly obliterated this wisp of light.

"Qingxu, your master..." Cao Qianqiu transmitted his voice, but his faint figure directly exploded.

"You are very good... If my true body arrives, let alone a broken mirror like you, even if you were whole and undamaged, you would be smashed into collapse." Old Cao's faint figure reappeared.

Qin Ming's heart trembled greatly. Cao Qianqiu's Pure Yang conscious spiritual light almost possessed an immortal quality; even after suffering such attacks, it could reappear and was not completely obliterated. From this perspective, a Patriarch at the forefront of the Immortal Path was extremely terrifying and difficult to destroy; it would require multiple bombardments to truly eliminate them.

"Local rules: protect descendants who bravely forge new paths, eliminate all invaders," the Heavenly Demon Mirror's indifferent voice rang out.

"Master!" Li Qingxu had never seen such a battered and tragic side of his teacher, who was now being executed. The next instant, he disappeared from here, landing in the Secret Realm, sent away by the Heavenly Demon Mirror.

Qin Ming was somewhat dissatisfied but also helpless. Anyone who embarked on a path would be protected by this place. Just as now, when the "over-the-limit" Cao Qianqiu tried to kill him, it immediately triggered the Heavenly Demon Mirror's interception and counter-elimination.

The broken mirror hung in the air, and another golden light descended. Cao Qianqiu's immortal quality was severed, and he became so faint that a gust of wind could dissipate him. His silver hair stood on end, and his eyes were icy, but at this moment, he was truly helpless; his Pure Yang essence was almost completely depleted.

"Descendant who bravely forges new paths, do you wish to study his Pure Yang conscious spiritual light?" The Heavenly Demon Mirror actually asked this.

"Good!" Qin Ming immediately nodded and rushed over.

Cao Qianqiu's murderous aura surged, but he couldn't change anything; he was now like a tiger fallen into a flat land. A dragon saber appeared in Qin Ming's right hand. In an instant, he turned Old Cao into "Cao Shiqiu" (Cao Ten-Autumn), beheading him on the spot. However, the old madman's spiritual will was like iron, completely undisturbed, unable to be resonated with by emotions. Qin Ming frowned. Even as the opponent was about to dissipate, his mind remained so cold, hard, and unperturbed, which was truly terrifying. After his ninth rebirth, hot currents surged in his eyes, allowing him to observe minute details. At this moment, he carefully gazed at the spiritual body, analyzing the secrets of Pure Yang.

Cao Qianqiu sneered, saying, "This old man's path leads directly above the Nine Heavens. Do you newcomers also dare to peek? What virtue or ability do you possess? Even if you reach the end, you'll be nothing but mere strongmen!" The next moment, he became "Cao Gongqiu" (Cao Labor-Autumn), missing half his body. Then, he became "Cao Qianhuo" (Cao Thousand-Fire), and was split vertically. This was Qin Ming's retort. Then, he once again stared carefully at his Pure Yang conscious spiritual light.

Cao Qianqiu stood with his hands behind his back, his expression indifferent, saying, "Even if a heaven-reaching grand path is laid before you, you newcomers won't be able to walk it. In the end, you'll just be laborers!" Immediately, he turned into "Cao Gonggong" (eunuch)!

Qin Ming naturally wouldn't indulge him. What old senior, what undefeated master – if he deserved a beating, he'd be beaten; if he deserved to be chopped, he'd be chopped; if he deserved to be missing parts, he'd be missing parts!

Cao Qianqiu was utterly enraged, unable to remain calm this time! He hadn't expected this brat to be so daring, so lacking in morality. His Dao heart was originally like iron, but now, being humiliated by a junior, he couldn't hold on. He had no masochistic tendencies and didn't want to stay here anymore.

With a thud, before he could make a move, his head took another hammer blow and exploded.

"Wait for the future, and pray, don't let my true body encounter you..." After Cao Qianqiu reappeared, his eyes were chillingly cold. With a bang, he exploded himself.

"Residual conscious spiritual light detected." The Heavenly Demon Mirror emitted a cold voice, then spewed out a sky full of golden light, illuminating a phantom figure. Old Cao was very cunning, still wanting to lie low and take the message away. However, he ultimately couldn't escape the Heavenly Demon Mirror and was directly incinerated into ash. This wisp of Cao Qianqiu's Pure Yang conscious spiritual light was completely annihilated.

Qin Ming breathed a sigh of relief. Cao Qianqiu must have seen through his essence; if he had been able to return to his true body, Qin Ming's future path would have been all but cut off.

On various paths, other Immortal Seeds, God Seeds, and so on, watched quietly. After realizing it was Cao Qianqiu, seeing such a result, everyone was somewhat lost in thought.

Li Qingxu landed on the ground, feeling deeply humiliated. He had been knocked off the Immortal Path, felt he had let down his sect, and had even implicated his teacher. He truly had no face to return. He looked up at the sky and saw that the demon path was widening and expanding!

"Ah..." Li Qingxu, disheveled and covered in blood, roared in a low voice: "Break and then build! Sooner or later, I will wash away all this humiliation!"

In the Secret Realm, people debated heatedly. The disciples of the Immortal Path all felt complex emotions. Their side had lost, and that demon was simply too powerful. Those who disliked Li Qingxu gloated, saying, "What did I say? I predicted early on that he would be knocked down. Didn't it come true?"

"Li Qingxu is no good, truly the weakest Immortal Seed!"

Some people's expressions were grave, having guessed that Cao Qianqiu had appeared at the end, yet he still lost! Someone said in a deep voice, "Say no more. This matter is far more serious than you imagine; it could cause massive waves!"

Someone asked, puzzled, "Why?"

"Don't you even think? Could Li Qingxu really master the Runic Golden Rope, the Soul-Fixing Bell, and the Pure Yang Grand Sun Support at his current stage?"

"Hiss!"

Immediately, those Immortal Path disciples dared not say more. On the demon side, it was a boiling cauldron of excitement, praising the youth "Yao Yi" to the heavens, considering him one of the strongest Demon Race seeds of this era, likely ranking within the top five in the Nightmist World. As for this plateau, he was absolutely the top-ranked Demon Seed, in a class of his own!

"You don't understand, you underestimated Yao Yi. He even mastered the legendary Dragon-Snake Scissors; his value is higher than you imagine!"

"Such a generational prodigy, only our Demon Race princess can be worthy of him, right?"

"Heavenly Demon is within reach!"

Many demons spared no praise. The people of the Esoteric Sect were also discussing, relatively more peacefully, as this battle didn't involve them. Regardless of hostility or praise, all parties had a consensus: Yao Yi reigned supreme on the demon path and could threaten various seeds on other paths.

...

In the sky, the fragmented pieces of Li Qingxu's broken Immortal Path all flowed towards the demon path, instantly making the demonic aura there sky-high! All sides were shaken. Had the youth on the demon path truly embarked on a heaven-reaching grand path?

"He will benefit greatly from this and become even stronger!" someone said with a solemn expression. The demon path, shrouded in blood mist and purple qi, was now a smooth expanse, having turned purplish-gold, stretching into the distance, then disappearing under everyone's shocked gazes.

Qin Ming experienced an initial surge of euphoria, then quickly calmed down. He knew his performance was brilliant, but thinking of Cao Qianqiu, his heart grew heavy again. A mere wisp of the old madman's Pure Yang conscious spiritual light was already so terrifying; to what extent would his true body be strong? Unfathomable!

The Heavenly Demon Mirror spoke: "Descendant who bravely forges new paths, your potential is boundless, like a rising sun dispelling the night mist over the sea. Given that you severed an Immortal Path, you are specially rewarded: your fragmented Demon Seed shall be made whole. May you continue your efforts and illuminate this era!"

Qin Ming's apprehension towards Cao Qianqiu was instantly swept away. He revealed a look of joy. This battle was worth it! In an instant, two fragmented Demon Seeds, one golden and one silver, appeared before him, causing the three shattered Demon Seeds within his body to stir, eager to merge with them.

Qin Ming smiled. He naturally didn't need to form a complete Demon Seed, but he could refine them, thereby cultivating the "Golden Cicada Scripture" to a great accomplishment, and his ninth rebirth, which wasn't yet complete, could also continue. Earlier, he hadn't touched those three fragmented Demon Seeds for fear of affecting his progression on the demon path. Now, he had no qualms. This meant his strength could be further enhanced!

Subsequently, he appeared in a palace. Here, there was a futon and two unlit incense sticks, identical to those he had obtained from Li Qingxu. These could allow one to enter an enlightenment state!

"A single battle, so much gained, all resources!" Qin Ming's face was wreathed in smiles.

Outside the Secret Realm, demonic qi surged, and a giant demon arrived. Upon hearing the latest report, it burst into hearty laughter, shaking the heavens and causing the boundless night mist to dissipate. Pu Heng was on his way, already very close. After learning the latest developments, he was instantly shocked: his master was very likely involved in that battle?!

...

"Our Immortal Path lost so badly, is no one going to step forward? Fight another battle, otherwise, if this gets out, what face will we have?!"

"Leng Feiyue, Cui Chonghe, Su Shiyun, Sun Jingxiao, you must go and fight! Otherwise, if the news of Immortal Path disciples losing to demons spreads everywhere, it will be too embarrassing!"

Outside, people were debating fiercely. Especially, with the old seniors about to bloodbath the plateau, sweep away all old demons, and hunt auspicious beasts, how could the younger generation possibly lose in such circumstances? In fact, some people on the Immortal Path truly had thoughts. They not only understood cultivation but also the general trend. If they remained indifferent and ignored the situation, would the old fellows of the Immortal Path blame them for not taking responsibility?

"Sun Jingxiao from the Outsider Pure Land has issued a challenge to you." At this moment, the Heavenly Demon Mirror transmitted its voice. Qin Ming knew this person, having seen him on the Vermilion Bird spacecraft.

"No time!" He said without thinking. He was about to begin cultivating remarkable techniques and push his ninth rebirth towards perfection, not wanting to be distracted.

"He does not wish for actual combat with you," the Heavenly Demon Mirror informed him. The opponent wanted to compete with him on comprehension. After embarking on such a path, the evaluation received was related to actual combat, comprehension, physical foundation, the path-breaker's vision, etc. The opponent had chosen one of these aspects.

Qin Ming paused, then asked, "It won't affect my quiet cultivation and enlightenment here, will it?"

"Generally, no," the Heavenly Demon Mirror responded.

"Alright, I accept!" Qin Ming nodded, still hoping to obtain more rewards.

The Heavenly Demon Mirror said, "Descendant who bravely forges new paths, it is recommended that you first enter enlightenment, adjust your body and mind to their optimal state, and then merge the complete Demon Seed. That way, the effect will be best."

"Hmm, I'll listen to you." Qin Ming followed the advice. He wasn't preparing to merge a complete Demon Seed, but rather wanted to cultivate a trump card technique. Among all his techniques, naturally, the strongest was using the silk scroll's profound principles to control various methods and unleash the merged and unified Heavenlight Energy. However, this also consumed a vast amount of energy. He needed other, diverse means to better cope with various crises. For instance, after comprehending and sublimating the "Dragon-Snake Scripture," he cultivated the Dragon-Snake Scissors, which could break Cao Qianqiu's Runic Golden Rope. He was quite moved by this. Even if his Heavenlight Energy was astonishing, he still needed various wondrous methods to display it, allowing him to maximize his combat power.

"If I light that incense stick for the comprehension competition, would that be considered cheating?" Qin Ming asked.

"No, I will convert to an equivalent environment before estimation. Moreover, he has already lit a similar incense stick."

"That works then," Qin Ming nodded.

This palace, with its golden bricks and jade tiles, was very quiet. Qin Ming sat cross-legged on the futon shrouded in purple mist, having already lit the incense stick on the jade table. Instantly, his eyes cleared, his entire body glowed, as if Dao charm circulated within him. From head to toe, he felt light and comfortable, his mind becoming utterly clear and empty.

Outside, people were surprised, for they saw an Immortal Path emerge, approaching the demon path and eventually merging with it. Two colossal palaces materialized, both flowing with spiritual radiance. Vaguely, chanting sounds emanated from there, quite mystical. Some people speculated, "Is this another battle? Otherwise, how could the two paths meet?"

Instantly, waves rose again in the Secret Realm. Everyone understood: a Seed-level figure on the Immortal Path was unconvinced and went to challenge the young demon. Unfortunately, they didn't know it was a comprehension competition and couldn't see the situation inside the two colossal palaces, so they could only stare blankly.

"In a moment, we'll see which path gets damaged, and we'll know who won and who lost!" people from the Esoteric Sect said with a laugh, uninvolved and enjoying the spectacle. Some demons were displeased, saying, "Is this going to be a wheel battle? Is one Demon Seed of our Demon Race going to fight against multiple Immortal Path Seeds?!" At this moment, the people of the Immortal Path had extremely serious expressions. If they lost to the demons again, it would truly be very embarrassing.

In the Great Demon Hall, Qin Ming followed his own rhythm, cultivating a trump card technique from a remarkable art, starting with the original demon race version of the "Golden Silkworm Scripture." In the first stage, his Heavenlight Energy was like silkworm threads, forming a cocoon of light outside his body, with astonishing defensive power! Next, he advanced to a more profound realm, using offense as defense. He seemed to absorb the golden essence qi from heaven and earth, and the golden silkworm threads emerging from his body hummed and vibrated, becoming extremely tough.

In fact, after reaching this step, it became very difficult to cultivate further. This was because it placed extremely high demands on the cultivator's talent! Only those possessing Three Imperial Energies or Heaven-Shakers could continue on this path; ordinary demon races simply couldn't study the profound levels of this scripture's trump card techniques. Under the enhancement of the enlightenment state, Qin Ming gradually achieved success. Densely packed golden silkworm threads emerged from his body, all transformed from Heavenlight Energy, seemingly distorting space. This was the Golden Silkworm Force Field!

The golden silkworm threads danced chaotically, capable of tearing apart others' Heavenlight, weapons, etc., and could also destroy conscious spiritual light, divine wisdom, and so on, while also providing self-defense. If he were to step into the third realm — Spiritual Field — the power of this trump card technique would surge greatly at the corresponding realm! Because it was most compatible with the Spiritual Field realm. Even now, it had become one of Qin Ming's trump card techniques.

Previously, Qin Ming had already dabbled in the Golden Silkworm Force Field, but he hadn't delved deeply into it because it was a technique of the second realm. After his battle with Cao Qianqiu, he was deeply moved. The opponent unleashed profound arts and killing moves with every lift of a hand, so now he urgently wanted to master several such techniques. And with his foundation and comprehension, after his ninth rebirth, he could actually attempt to cultivate them. As he continuously comprehended, he felt he had almost grasped it. Soon after, he stood up to practice, becoming more proficient as time passed!

Furthermore, when Qin Ming activated the Golden Silkworm Force Field, combining it with Old Cao's Runic Golden Rope, all the silkworm threads merged into one, manifesting a tough golden rope that could bind people or pierce opponents. However, his Heavenlight Energy couldn't yet extend far, only being useful in close-quarters combat.

"After the Dragon-Snake Scissors, the Golden Silkworm Force Field I've cultivated can also be put into practical combat; its power is immense!" Qin Ming was quite satisfied after testing the technique. If he cultivated a trump card technique from each remarkable art, it would be enough for him. "Unfortunately, there's no opponent for actual combat to test it now." As for other remarkable arts, Qin Ming briefly attempted them but put them aside for now, saving them for later, as cultivating trump card techniques also required insight, accumulation, etc. This was in the Enlightenment Hall on the demon path, naturally most suitable for cultivating the trump card techniques recorded in the "Dragon-Snake Scripture" and the "Golden Silkworm Scripture."

Afterwards, he began to consider the Demon Seeds, directly crushing and refining two of them, then proceeding to cultivate the "Golden Cicada Scripture."

"Heaven envies the talented. Heaven bestowed upon you bone structure and talent brilliant enough to illuminate an era, yet also made your fate fraught with difficulties. In the realm of enlightenment, you once again damaged your foundation and shattered your Demon Seeds..." The Heavenly Demon Mirror spoke, as if sighing in lament.

Qin Ming was speechless. The Heavenly Demon Mirror saw that his Demon Seeds not only hadn't healed but had exploded again, so it thought he was envied by heaven?

"Perhaps this world is fair; there is no such thing as perfection. Every path and every technique has flaws. Ultimately, all things manifest as a beauty of incompleteness," the Heavenly Demon Mirror said calmly.

Qin Ming immediately agreed: "That's right. Can you see if I can still be saved? Give me two more fragmented Demon Seeds, and perhaps I can approach perfection!"

"Don't waste time. In the enlightenment state, practice your techniques," the Heavenly Demon Mirror said. Clearly, it believed this was a balancing rule within the Nightmist World: Yao Yi's talent was too exceptional, thus envied by heaven, making it difficult to condense a perfect Demon Seed.

The "Golden Cicada Scripture" that Qin Ming cultivated had two versions, both learned from the elder Wu Chengwang of the Mountain River Academy. At that time, he was willing to be "fleeced" and comprehended the entire scripture for six hundred day-gold! The two versions had already been unified by him. He had almost fully comprehended them before. Now, after refining the Demon Seeds, his body was full of vitality, making it most suitable to cultivate this scripture.

The Demon Seeds were mercilessly crushed and exploded by him. After extracting their essence, his flesh and blood also ruptured, covering his entire body in blood.

"The 'Golden Cicada Scripture' you are cultivating is not the original demon race version; it can be completed," the Heavenly Demon Mirror spoke. Qin Ming had already anticipated this. Just like the "Dragon-Snake Scripture" and "Golden Silkworm Scripture" before, their original demon race versions were completed on this path. A moment later, Qin Ming felt as if he had been enlightened, with some original demon runes being transmitted into his sea of consciousness. He instantly obtained the complete cultivation method.

"I wonder if this cultivation method is related to the ancient cicada recorded in the 'Kunling Divine Records'?" He didn't get distracted and began to comprehend the technique and cultivate. Soon, Qin Ming's body was covered in blood scabs. The true essence of the Golden Cicada Scripture was for the golden cicada to emerge from its shell, tear apart its old body, and undergo tribulation for rebirth. It could be said that it carried a strong Zen profoundness, capable of extending lifespan and seeking life from death. Qin Ming, during his enlightenment and cultivation, was once almost in a state of nirvana, with no life fluctuations throughout his body.

Not until a long time later, from deep within the blood scabs, came the sound of a cicada's chirp. This wasn't an actual sound, but rather more like the vibration of Dao charm. In an instant, Qin Ming tore open the blood scabs, and a layer of old skin peeled off his body, truly like a cicada shedding its shell, obtaining an even more powerful physical body! He noticed that the incense stick on the table had burned down to its end. He didn't care, because he still had stock, and even more spoils of war obtained from Li Qingxu.

"Has a long time passed, it seems?" Qin Ming asked.

"Half a day," the Heavenly Demon Mirror informed him.

Qin Ming perceived that he was undergoing changes; his flesh and blood were hot. His ninth rebirth had indeed continued, and his physique was strengthening. After cultivating the Golden Cicada Scripture, absorbing the essence of the Demon Seeds, his body was full of vitality.

"You have emerged from seclusion. This comprehension competition has a result," the Heavenly Demon Mirror informed him.

Sun Jingxiao had waited for a long time. After his incense stick burned out, he surprisingly still hadn't received a result, which puzzled him, making him wonder if something had gone wrong. At this moment, the broken mirror on this path spoke: "You have lost. The opponent has cultivated a trump card technique and a remarkable demon race art. Your achievements, compared to his, are somewhat dim."

"I actually lost! In such a short time, he actually made two significant breakthroughs?" Sun Jingxiao was shocked, then fell into a daze.

People saw that in the sky, parts of the Immortal Path had shattered, and the fragments recombined onto the demon path. Afterwards, the Immortal Path faded into the distance.

"Holy moly, the youth on the demon path has won again!"

Instantly, there was an uproar in the Secret Realm, causing a huge stir.

Qin Ming was very calm, experiencing the changes within himself. He felt that his transformation through the "Golden Cicada Scripture" was no less significant than the rebirth he underwent after mastering the "Dragon-Snake Scripture." While waiting for this rebirth to conclude, he continued to study the "Golden Cicada Scripture." This was the seventh remarkable art he had cultivated! Without a doubt, his Heavenlight Energy would undergo a qualitative change because of this!

"Golden Cicada Energy possesses destructive power against enemies, and beneficial life-force for oneself, with infinite wondrous uses!" he exclaimed. For a moment, he was enveloped in two types of light. Clearly, this also involved the changes of Yin and Yang. If combined with the Dragon-Snake Scripture, his grasp of Yin and Yang transformations would further deepen! At the same time, the trump card technique within the Golden Cicada Scripture – the mutual transformation of life and death, the indestructible Zen charm, the cicada's thunderous chirp – was also carefully pondered by him.

"My ninth rebirth is very strange. It's happening in two parts, each no less significant than a true rebirth. Will it completely end after this one?" Qin Ming murmured to himself. For him, such rebirth was of great significance. He gained an additional opportunity for transformation, cultivated another remarkable art, and became even stronger than before.

"Cui Chonghe has challenged you. Do you accept?" The Heavenly Demon Mirror suddenly spoke, delivering such news.
