# Chapter 102: It Had to Be You, Senior Brother Zhao

The plan was perfect, but reality was cruel.

"I didn't choose to inherit my cultivation from the previous life, so the two great divine abilities, Corpse Deliverance True Method and Heavenly Silkworm Secret, also have no progress inherited. Re-cultivation will take time."

Fortunately, with the Dharma Protector Deity Su Nu, he no longer needed to go through all sorts of difficulties like in his previous life. He could directly cultivate divine abilities with the Foundation Establishment rank's blessing. In just a few months, he could re-refine his Foundation Establishment spiritual sense and the rank of [Corpse Deliverance Immortal], restoring his cultivation to its peak state from the past life.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang was no longer in a hurry to execute his plan.

After all, this was about adding sand under the nose of a Foundation Establishment True Person. To be safe, it wouldn't be too late to execute the plan after he recovered to his peak.

He walked out of his cave dwelling and met with Liu Xin. From Liu Xin's hands, he obtained half a volume of the Innate Daoist Scripture.

After watching Liu Xin depart, Lu Yang used an illusion spell to conceal his figure. After a quick calculation with his fingers, he then arrived at a remote cave dwelling on Mending Heaven Peak.

At this moment, angry roars emanated from within the cave dwelling:
"My fortuitous encounter! That was my fortuitous encounter, but someone stole it... Rationality? How can you expect me to be rational? What do I have left to be rational about?!"

That was Zhao Xuhe's voice.

As expected, with his appearance and the disappearance of True Person Panlong's legacy, Zhao Xuhe had once again fallen into a low point in his life, currently standing there, cursing profusely.

Before long, the cave dwelling's door opened, and Zhao Xuhe's old paramour, Fairy Qinghe, walked out with a cold, pretty face. She turned back and simply said, "Zhao Xuhe, we're breaking up," then strode away without a trace of reluctance. Lu Yang calculated with his fingers; she was likely heading towards Liu Xin's cave dwelling.

Sounds of smashing and crashing came from within the cave dwelling once more.

Lu Yang opened his Dharma Eye and quickly saw Zhao Xuhe venting his anger inside the cave dwelling. He then smiled faintly: "Senior Brother Zhao, it really has to be you!"

In this life, his greatest enemy was undoubtedly Fú Lóng Arhat.

He didn't plan to disperse his cultivation and re-cultivate. After all, Rank Three True Arts were inherently rare, and apart from the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art," the rest were all Holy Sect cultivation methods.

But the Holy Sect's cultivation methods... felt even more unstable.

At least for the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art," he already knew what the hidden danger was. As for the Holy Sect's Rank Three True Arts, they were still like flowers seen through a fog to him.

Therefore, it was better to find a solution for the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art."

"Although the cultivation method indeed has a hidden danger, this danger should only target Qi Refinement cultivators. Otherwise, why would Fú Lóng come to stop me just as I'm breaking through to Foundation Establishment?"

"If he came to harvest me after I had established my foundation, wouldn't the gains be greater?"

"But he didn't do that... The only possibility is that once I successfully establish my foundation, I can escape his control, which is why he has to stop me in advance!"

In other words, as long as he could break through to Foundation Establishment despite Fú Lóng's obstruction, he could break the deadlock!

That being said, Lu Yang was very self-aware. Fú Lóng Arhat had already forged a Heavenly Gang and was at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage of cultivation, which was absolutely not something he could contend with.

At least not in his current state, before establishing his foundation.

So he couldn't fight head-on; he could only outwit him.

"Although in this life I plan to try and secure a position as a Holy Sect True Disciple to protect myself, I can't put all my hope in the Holy Sect."

After all, that was the Holy Sect.

And a cunning rabbit has three burrows, let alone a human?

Therefore, Lu Yang must have one, or even several, backup plans to ensure he could cope when Fú Lóng Arhat eventually came for him.

And Zhao Xuhe was one of the backup plans Lu Yang had chosen.

The next second, Lu Yang directly circulated his spiritual sense, roughly pouring into Zhao Xuhe's mind.

As the effects of drunkenness faded, Zhao Xuhe suddenly opened his eyes. Half-awake, fragmented memories abruptly surged into his mind.

"Where am I...?"

Zhao Xuhe looked around blankly, taking a long time to come to his senses. Only when the fragmented memories in his mind gradually became clear did he show a look of realization.

"...These are my memories from a past life!"

In his memories, Zhao Xuhe saw a young man who was eight parts similar to him in appearance, soaring on the wind, laughing proudly at the world, truly full of vigor and ambition.

"So that's it... My past life was actually True Person Panlong!"

Zhao Xuhe understood.

"No wonder I had an affinity with True Person Panlong's cultivation method; it was originally mine! As for the merits of three lifetimes, those were accumulated by me when I was a True Person."

"As for why I don't have more memories, and don't possess the talent expected of a True Person's reincarnation... that's also normal. The Fruit of a True Person is severed after five lifetimes, and I am already True Person Panlong's fifth incarnation. My great limit is approaching, and many profound abilities have been lost. Otherwise, how could I have fallen to such a state?"

Zhao Xuhe had not the slightest doubt about these memories.

After all, the memories were well-reasoned, interconnected, and even some seemingly flawed parts could be logically explained with a little thought.

More importantly, there was one thing in the memories that was undeniably real.

"The 'Nine Transformations Dragon Art'!"

Zhao Xuhe concentrated on recalling, and the contents of the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art" immediately appeared in his mind, word for word, even with corresponding insights and annotations!

No doubt about it, these must be my insights into the cultivation method from my past life!

Moreover, even the "Myriad Chariots Imperial Dragon Ascension Scroll" was present, making Zhao Xuhe ecstatic, almost dancing with joy inside the cave dwelling.

However, soon, his expression grew solemn again.

"In this life, someone must be secretly plotting against me!"

Zhao Xuhe pondered for a moment, and his clever mind quickly pinpointed the mastermind:

"The Mending Heaven Peak Lord!"

If before, as a disciple of the Mending Heaven Peak Lord, Zhao Xuhe had some reverence for him in his heart, now only resentment remained.

"That old geezer is also a True Person, so why did he take me, a True Person's reincarnation, as his disciple? He was clearly taking advantage of me, and the legacy I left for myself suddenly disappeared. When I asked that old geezer, he actually said that my affinity with the legacy was over? Clearly, he was spouting nonsense..."

Could it be that he took a cut of the legacy I left for myself?!

The more Zhao Xuhe thought about it, the angrier he became. It took a long time for his mood to gradually calm down: "...That old geezer is powerful; I can't let him discover that I've awakened my past life memories."

Endure this momentary humiliation!

Wait for the opportune moment!

Zhao Xuhe's gaze was firm, as if he had truly become True Person Panlong, who could summon wind and rain in his memories: "In this life, I will definitely return to Foundation Establishment!"

"Even if there are thousands of difficulties and dangers, I will defy the heavens!"

Watching Zhao Xuhe swear to the heavens and regain his spirits within the cave dwelling, Lu Yang smiled with satisfaction.

The so-called "past life memories" were, of course, entirely fabricated by Lu Yang. With Su Nu's blessing, he could now subtly influence others' thoughts.

Strictly speaking, Zhao Xuhe had now become Lu Yang's bait.

And the big fish Lu Yang wanted to catch was Fú Lóng Arhat!

"In this life, I will first help Zhao Xuhe attempt to break through to Foundation Establishment, letting him draw all of Fú Lóng Arhat's attention, and then I will attempt my own breakthrough."

This way, he could buy himself time for his breakthrough.

To put it bluntly, it was using Zhao Xuhe as a shield.

"Senior Brother Zhao, just rest easy and go forth. If you can help me block this calamity in this life, I won't count the interest on the contribution points you owed me from your life before last..."
