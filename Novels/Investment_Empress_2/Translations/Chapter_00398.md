# Chapter 398: Purple Gold Crown with Phoenix Wings, Extreme Form of the Crimson Dragon (1/2)

In the small world, the light of the Great Yin cast the shadows of two intertwined figures upon the Yin-Yang Arena.

The legend that once hung high in the heavens once again accepted the challenge of that little girl. Princess Jiang had lost many times, but it seemed that each time, she grew even stronger.

Jiang Chulong's body was soft and delicate.

Yet the tone in which she just declared that she would win this time was without the slightest wavering.

Just like the peach blossom branch in her hand.

"She will definitely win this time," Little Li Tianzun said, seemingly calm, but cheering for her in his heart.

After a moment of thought, the Tianzun teacher seemed to remember something:

"Oh, right. Your Big Brother Li said."

"If you break through to the Divine Observation Realm, he will give you a gift."

"!"

Visibly, the effect was immediate.

The beautiful eyes behind Princess Jiang's blindfold suddenly brightened several degrees.

"I will definitely... definitely win!"

As her words fell.

The projection of the Golden Crow suddenly blurred. Facing the suddenly surging sword light, it once again used that technique to hide within the light.

The battle instantly entered a white-hot frenzy.

"She's putting in格外 effort today. There's quite a chance she might actually succeed," Li Mo thought, watching the high-spirited Princess Jiang with a look of approval. But then he fell into thought, and the warning—or rather, the caution—from the green-robed sword maid during the day surfaced in his mind.

To stop Chulong from practicing martial arts?

In the display of the Heavenly Fate Divine Eye, it was clearly written on Jiang Yu's Tianzun Emperor Sword Bone that it had not yet been refined.

If one day, Chulong truly surged against the tide and rose up...

The Sword Bone might return to its true owner.

Was Jiang Yu afraid?

*Zheng—*

Suddenly, a clear and resonant sword cry echoed across the sky of the Yin-Yang Arena.

The peach blossom branch fell. It was like tender green grass sprouting from snow-covered ground after lying dormant for an unknown length of time, or like a summer cicada buried deep underground breaking out of its cage, letting out the first cry of its life.

This sword defied reason, piercing through layers of light and shadow, and waves of heat.

The primordial Golden Crow had already dived into the light and shadow, waiting for its chance.

And wasn't Jiang Chulong doing the same?

She too was waiting for the Golden Crow projection to reveal itself!

Golden light like an arrow, sword light reaching the body.

To an outsider, it seemed the two were about to inflict mutual destruction.

But excitement surged in Li Mo's heart, and he almost failed to maintain the cold and aloof aura of a Tianzun.

"We won!"

"Chulong's sword is faster!"

Even if she would be injured after stabbing her opponent.

Even if this sword was incredibly risky.

But no matter how you looked at it, Chulong was the absolute victor.

*Pfft—*

A soft sound. The Golden Crow projection lowered its head, looking somewhat disbelievingly at the sword that had pierced through its chest. Then, it seemed to become somewhat gratified.

Well, the gratification was something Little Li had imagined on his own...

"Teacher, I... I won."

Jiang Chulong's pale little face flushed red, her hairline damp with sweat and sticking to her neck.

But her eyes were shining with light of anticipation and joy.

"Excellent!!"

"Teacher... I... I seem to... be full of energy now."

"Quick, sit down. You're about to break through."

Li Mo took out a meditation cushion for the dizzy-headed Princess Jiang, having her sit cross-legged. Then, he took out a pile of bottles and jars.

He first lit three sticks of fragrant incense. As the smoke curled around, he had her take the pills with dew.

Bright Spirit Incense... Morning Dew... Seven-Striped Questioning Dao Pill...

All the rare treasures needed for the best breakthrough to the Divine Observation Realm were here, all rewards from his previous investments.

After all, he and the ice lump no longer needed them.

Could it be called a waste to use them on Princess Jiang?

After a full round of feeding her the medicine, Jiang Chulong sat herself down properly and began to circulate her self-created martial art.

Within her small body.

It seemed that some kind of divine potential was growing vigorously!

At the same time, a prompt sounded in Li Mo's ear:

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Jiang Chulong', causing the Sword Bone within her to sprout and the Wild Grass Sword Bone to take shape.】

【Investment Reward: Crimson Dragon Divine Fire Observation Diagram.】

【Crimson Dragon Divine Fire Observation Diagram】: "An Extreme Form Observation Diagram, within which is contained the scene of a Crimson Dragon birthing divine fire."

All the dragons in the Great Yu Dynasty should be Golden Dragons of Fortune, not inherently superior or inferior to this Crimson Dragon.

Of course, neither of them is the Dragon of Providence, the one and only true dragon born to fate.

---

Otherwise, the Dragon Diagram would not be an Extreme Form.

This will probably be the sparring partner for himself and Princess Jiang for the next while.

And it will also be the opponent they will defeat in the near future.

"Sweating profusely now, aren't you, Your Highness the Crown Prince?"

Li Mo was looking forward to the day Princess Jiang would slay the Crimson Dragon with her sword.

Not long after.

Another prompt sounded:

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Jiang Chulong', causing her to break through to the Divine Observation Realm.】

【Investment Reward: Purple Gold Crown with Phoenix Wings!】

【Purple Gold Crown with Phoenix Wings】: "Divine Grade. When worn, based on the wearer's progress in the Will to Fight Against the Heavens, greatly ignores pressure, and can inflict a powerful mental oppression on the opponent. Can enhance the压制力 of one's own domain."

Is this the genuine article?

Li Mo had a tiny bit of doubt at first.

Well, actually, Divine Weapons are almost the pinnacle of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. Above them are the Dao Instruments of Heavenly Fortune, which fundamentally cannot belong to a single person.

Usually, only the few great sects in the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths possess them.

According to his knowledge, only the Great Yu Dynasty possesses two at the same time.

"Wait."

Li Mo suddenly noticed there was another line below the description.

"Note: One of the Great Sage's Armors. If the complete set is gathered, it becomes a Dao Instrument of Heavenly Fortune!"

"So that's how it is."

Li Mo's brow smoothed.

He focused his mind.

A Purple Gold Crown with soaring Phoenix Wings, a marvel of craftsmanship, quietly appeared in his palm. Two long whiskers almost poked the Tianzun's eyes.

It wasn't as exaggerated as in the TV shows he'd seen; its design was restrained, even ancient.

But at the same time, it was very heavy.

The moment it appeared in his palm, he seemed to hear a sound that was not human, yet the thought was crystal clear in his mind.

"Successor, you cannot yet bear this weight."

"Your will to fight is not strong enough."

Li Mo had no choice but to put it away. He sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion, quietly waiting for Princess Jiang to complete her breakthrough.

At the same time, he took out that Crimson Dragon Divine Fire Observation Diagram.

The Golden Crow projection had not dissipated. His current power of all living beings was enough to condense one more projection.

Not long after.

Jiang Chulong opened her eyes. Just as she was about to say something, her excited little face froze.

"Chulong, there's no time to rejoice in your breakthrough."

"Your next opponent is it."

A Crimson Dragon soared through the air, coiling in the sky. Scorching dragon might rained down like a shower. Within its vertical pupils, the ferocity of wanting to burn mountains and boil seas was clearly evident.

This was also Li Mo's next opponent.

...

The next morning.

On the second floor of the Autumn Water Pavilion.

The ice lump, her black hair tied up and a plain robe wrapping her delicate figure, pushed the door and went downstairs to the courtyard.

"Bing'er, you're up so early," Shang Wu said with a yawn.

Ying Bing nodded: "Mm, you too."

"No way, I was at Sunset Peak yesterday, drinking with Elder Su all night. I didn't sleep."

The beautiful master, her arms crossed, laughed with a humph: "Elder Su threw up like a dog. I wish I had brought Little Mo along. It would've been fun to draw a picture of her like that."

They weren't allowed to use their qi to disperse the alcohol during their drinking contest. So, the outcome for the equally beautiful Elder Su when pitted against Shang Wu was easy to imagine.

"By the way, where's Little Mo?"

"He..."

Ying Bing hadn't had a chance to answer when a flicker of surprise flashed through her clear eyes.

Just now, a ripple came from upstairs. It was clearly someone breaking through.

Who else could it be besides a certain Little Li?

A certain ice lump's realm hadn't even led for two days before she was caught up again.

Ying Bing's eyes trembled slightly. She bit her lip and murmured:

"It really doesn't give anyone a day's rest..."

"???"

Shang Wu leaned back slightly.

As everyone knows, Li Mo and Ying Bing practice a dual-cultivation technique.

This morning, Li Mo broke through, yet Little Bing'er said she didn't get a day's rest...

Shang Wu felt as if struck by lightning.

Had the pig she raised been mounted by the cabbage?!
