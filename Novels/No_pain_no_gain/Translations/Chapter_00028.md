**Chapter 28: Layer Nine of Qi Condensation**

Han Zhen incidentally inquired about Zhang Tie, but among the new faces in Tai Nan Valley over the past year, there seemed to be no one matching his description.

Following the Tai Nan Valley steward's directions, Han Zhen found the pavilion he had rented in the peripheral area of the complex. Even those in the outer areas were constructed from exceptionally precious timber and large blocks of bluestone. Dragons and phoenixes were carved into the details, making them incredibly exquisite and instantly giving off an aura of an immortal dwelling. The spiritual energy in the small pavilion was certainly not comparable to that in the central area, but its advantage lay in its affordability.

Han Zhen took out the spirit talisman, his long-term residency permit for Tai Nan Valley. The yellow talisman paper shimmered with silver light, adorned with a spell Han Zhen couldn't decipher. Standing before the steps outside the pavilion's main door, Han Zhen gazed at the building using his Heavenly Eye Technique. A faint layer of azure light enveloped the pavilion, like a bowl inverted over it. The unseen underground area was likely protected in the same manner. Whether Han Zhen reached out to touch it or probed with his spiritual sense, he was blocked by an invisible barrier. It was impossible to peer into the pavilion from the outside, but Han Zhen wouldn't fully trust Spirit Beast Mountain to always act properly. On someone else's territory, he still needed to guard against revealing certain things.

Han Zhen took out the spirit talisman, and as instructed by the steward, he pressed it against the light barrier. Ripples immediately spread across the barrier, and an oval entrance appeared before him. Han Zhen stepped through, put away the talisman, and looked back to see the entrance in the light barrier perfectly sealing itself. The pavilion's front door opened with a light push, unobstructed.

The interior of the pavilion was simple yet elegant, with two floors reaching over ten zhang in height, spacious enough to accommodate several people comfortably. Han Zhen toured the pavilion, discovering that the first floor seemed primarily for receiving guests, while the second floor was divided into living quarters and a private cultivation chamber.

Han Zhen changed into a white satin robe, shedding all his disguises. The Immortal Ascension Token and the Talisman Treasure, being sensitive items, were kept close to his body. He opened his cloth pouch to inventory his supplies. Eighteen low-grade spirit stones were acquired from trading the century-old Polygonatum. The six spirit stones he obtained after interrupting Mo Juren's array activation were used to pay two years' rent for this small pavilion. Two Vajra Talismans, one Soul-Stabilizing Talisman, and the useless Soul-Guiding Bell artifact constituted Han Zhen's entire current fortune. As for mundane gold and silver, they held no value in Tai Nan Valley. In the mortal world, Han Zhen frequented the finest taverns and rode the best horses, but in the cultivation world of Yue State, he was merely at the lowest rung.

To save a spirit stone or two, he had to curry favor with the Han siblings. Han Zhen couldn't help but sigh, life was truly hard when one was poor; he wished he could split a single spirit stone into pieces.

Han Zhen took out the Soul-Stabilizing Talisman, contemplating his future plans. Apart from improving his cultivation realm, the most pressing matter was to find a way to earn spirit stones, and then acquire a suitable artifact for unexpected situations. Han Zhen hadn't forgotten the gaze that had spied on him when he first entered Tai Nan Valley. Yue State was no safe haven; besides numerous demonic sect factions, the Black Fiend Sect, lurking in the shadows of Yue State, was an existence Han Zhen couldn't afford to provoke. Although he possessed the Talisman Treasure, it gave him the confidence to protect his life even against Qi Condensation cultivators several layers higher than himself. However, repeated use of the Talisman Treasure would deplete its power. At the Qi Condensation stage, he could only unleash one or two tenths of its true might, which was not much stronger than a top-tier artifact. Han Zhen hadn't used it since he mastered its control with the Object Manipulation Technique. Only Foundation Establishment cultivators could fully unleash the Talisman Treasure's power using the Mind-Spirit Condensation method, allowing it to scorn all other artifacts. Therefore, Han Zhen decided to honestly stay within Tai Nan Valley for the next two years and go nowhere else.

...

...

Several days later, Han Zhen successfully broke through to the ninth layer of the Evergreen Cultivation Technique. After stabilizing his realm, he was about to take out the Soul-Stabilizing Talisman to meditate on it. Suddenly, a sound transmission talisman flew in. After receiving it and learning its contents, Han Zhen pondered for a few seconds before deciding to go out and see.

Outside the pavilion, stood a cultivator in his twenties, dressed as a Daoist priest. He was pale-faced and beardless, with well-defined features. A whisk hung over his arm as he waited outside the pavilion. Han Zhen observed him with his Heavenly Eye Technique, noting that his spiritual energy cultivation was considerably higher than his own, at least an expert at Qi Condensation Layer Ten or above. He opened the pavilion's restrictions and stepped outside.

"Fellow Daoist, what business do you have with me?" Han Zhen asked, his expression blank and his tone cold.

Seeing the elegant Han Zhen emerge from the pavilion, a hint of surprise flashed in the pale-faced Daoist's eyes; he almost thought he had come to the wrong place. "Haha, Fellow Daoist, no need to be nervous. I bear no ill will. I merely happened to move into the adjacent pavilion and came to greet you," the Daoist explained with a smile.

*Heh, what a coincidence!* Han Zhen sneered inwardly, but outwardly his expression softened as he looked at the pale-faced Daoist: "So that's how it is. I am Han Zhen, a rogue cultivator. Pleased to meet you, Fellow Daoist."

Upon hearing Han Zhen's introduction, the Daoist's face instantly lit up with joy: "So Fellow Daoist is also a rogue cultivator! I am a rogue Daoist from Wolong Mountain, my Daoist name is Qingwen."

"I wonder, Fellow Daoist, if you would be interested in joining our rogue cultivator group?" Daoist Qingwen asked with a look of anticipation.

Upon hearing the other party introduce himself, Han Zhen instantly understood his purpose! He also realized the meaning behind the hidden gaze that had spied on him when he first entered Tai Nan Valley. He hadn't expected to be targeted by the Black Fiend Sect; this Daoist Qingwen was the person in charge of the Black Fiend Sect in the vicinity of Tai Nan Valley! The Black Fiend Sect captured rogue cultivators throughout Yue State for blood sacrifices and cultivation. Han Zhen, appearing to be a novice rogue cultivator, was precisely the type they would target immediately.

Before Han Zhen could refuse, Daoist Qingwen hastily explained the benefits of joining a rogue cultivator group. In one or two years, Tai Nan Valley would host the Tai Nan Minor Gathering. In previous years, rogue cultivators who attended the trading fair alone were often bullied by those from cultivation families due to their lack of influence. This was why rogue cultivator groups like Daoist Qingwen's appeared, intentionally recruiting rogue cultivators to form a united front against external conflicts. Of course, he also specifically stated that during peaceful times, members were free to act according to their own preferences, without any coercive restrictions.

Han Zhen didn't immediately refuse after listening; instead, he feigned thoughtful consideration. Daoist Qingwen did not press him, as typically, those who didn't refuse immediately would, without exception, join their group. However, a moment later, Han Zhen's reply was beyond Qingwen's expectation.

"Thank you for your kind offer, Daoist. I'm accustomed to acting alone and have no intention of joining any group."

The smile on Daoist Qingwen's face faltered: "Ah, that's truly a pity. If Fellow Daoist changes his mind in the future, you can always find this humble Daoist next door."

After a polite farewell, the pale-faced Daoist drifted towards the adjacent pavilion, seeming as if he had merely been visiting a neighbor. Han Zhen scoffed. If he hadn't known the other party's true nature, he might genuinely have agreed to join.

Han Zhen returned to his cultivation chamber in the pavilion, took out the Soul-Stabilizing Talisman, and continued to meditate on it. As long as he remained unmoving, no matter what schemes the other party had, they wouldn't fall upon his head.
