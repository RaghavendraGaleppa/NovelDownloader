# Chapter 46: Mid-Grade Magic Sword  

"The current intensity is already quite high," Gu Mo said with confusion as he looked at Yuan Niya. Undergoing the Cleansing Technique once a month was already considered quite intensive, and Gu Mo had only settled on this frequency after thoroughly assessing Yuan Niya's physical condition.  

Any higher intensity could pose risks. The principle of the Cleansing Technique was to refine the body's meridians and marrow through vibrations that affected the muscles, bones, and skin. If the intensity were too high, it could cause damage instead of benefits.  

"I'm about to break through, but the progress of the Cleansing Technique isn't keeping up," Yuan Niya explained, stating her reason for wanting to increase the intensity.  

"So soon!"  

Gu Mo was shocked. Was this the talent of an inner sect disciple? She was already on the verge of breaking through from the first to the second level of Qi Refinement. Though it was just a minor breakthrough, the speed was astonishing.  

"Fast?"  

Yuan Niya shook her head. Her reaction stemmed from a newly admitted inner sect disciple—a rare upper-grade spiritual root talent discovered by an outer sect deacon during a mission in the mortal world.  

Yuan Niya possessed a mid-grade fire spiritual root, which only rivaled an upper-grade spiritual root when cultivating fire-attribute techniques and spells. However, this new junior brother had demonstrated upper-grade aptitude in all aspects, along with corresponding comprehension.  

When he was admitted, several Golden Core elders had competed to take him as a disciple, but the sect master ultimately claimed him as a personal disciple.  

Being the sect master's personal disciple meant he was practically guaranteed a spot as a true disciple, further reducing the already limited number of available positions. For other inner sect disciples, especially Yuan Niya, who had only entered the sect a few months earlier, this was not good news.  

Thus, Yuan Niya had been cultivating with exceptional diligence. With her mid-grade fire spiritual root and the abundant resources available to inner sect disciples, her efforts soon bore fruit.  

However, she chose not to break through immediately because the effects of the perfected Cleansing Technique had not yet reached their peak. For inner sect disciples, breaking through a minor realm was trivial—what truly mattered was building a solid foundation. The stronger the foundation, the greater their combat prowess within the same realm, and the higher their chances of reaching greater heights.  

Understanding Yuan Niya's situation, Gu Mo felt a headache coming on. In his view, if the Cleansing Technique's progress was insufficient, she could simply wait. There was no need to take unnecessary risks. Gu Mo himself was in a similar situation—his Cleansing Technique progress lagged behind his cultivation—but he had chosen to halt his cultivation and focus on catching up.  

"Increasing the intensity isn't impossible, but if something goes wrong, I won't take responsibility. Also..." Seeing Yuan Niya's unwavering expression, Gu Mo knew he couldn't persuade her, but he had to make his stance clear.  

---  

"No problem. If anything happens, I won't blame you. So, what else?" Yuan Niya nodded. Taking risks was unavoidable on the path of cultivation, especially when competing for a true disciple position—one had to charge forward without hesitation.  

"Of course, there's the matter of payment," Gu Mo said matter-of-factly.  

"Fine!"  

His words made Yuan Niya pause briefly. After a moment of thought, she took out a magic sword. Gu Mo's eyes lit up at the sight—it was a standard-issue weapon from the Artifact Peak, similar to the one he had seen in Mai Yunfa's possession. However, the one Yuan Niya produced was of superior quality—a mid-grade magical artifact. Such a sword was far from cheap.  

"This is my spare sword. Will it suffice as payment?" Yuan Niya handed the sword to Gu Mo. It was part of her benefits as an inner sect disciple, but her master had gifted her an upper-grade fire-attribute magic sword, so this mid-grade one had become a backup.  

"Deal!"  

A mid-grade magic sword was more than satisfactory as payment. After all, flying on a sword was undoubtedly more impressive than riding a crane. "Does it come with a sword-flight technique?" Gu Mo asked as he accepted the weapon.  

"No. If you want one, exchange for it yourself." Yuan Niya shot him a glance. Within the sect, techniques, spells, and secret arts could not be privately taught. Disciples had to exchange sect contribution points to learn them.  

Of course, as an inner sect disciple, Yuan Niya had access to most common techniques without spending contribution points. However, that didn't mean she could freely teach them to others—otherwise, the sect's contribution system would collapse.  

"Fair enough."  

Gu Mo thought for a moment. The sword-flight technique wasn't too expensive, and since he didn't need to exchange for the Concealing Qi Technique right now, he had enough contribution points to spare.  

"Well then, Senior Sister Yuan, are you ready?" Having accepted payment, Gu Mo was now obligated to provide the service.  

"Go ahead!"  

Yuan Niya nodded.  

"Ah!"  

The moment she spoke, a cry of pain escaped her lips—Gu Mo's intensified version of the Cleansing Technique had already taken effect.  

Glaring at him, Yuan Niya steeled herself against the amplified pain.  

It was excruciating—as if her body were being hammered on an anvil—but the effects were undeniable. Impurities were being forcibly expelled from her body.  

But the pain was unbearable!  

"This really is too much." Gu Mo observed Yuan Niya's condition. As time passed, blood began seeping from her nose, mouth, and skin—a sign that the enhanced Cleansing Technique was damaging her body, which went against its intended purpose of refining the meridians and marrow.  

---  

Yuan Niya was well aware of her body's condition, but she had come prepared. As an inner sect disciple, she had no shortage of healing pills.  

Gritting her teeth, she quickly swallowed one. However, her expression soon changed—the pill's effect was weaker than she had anticipated.  

Her injuries weren't ordinary internal or external wounds but deeper damage that ordinary healing pills couldn't easily address.  

The only option was to stop the Cleansing Technique immediately. Even then, she would need time to recover, which meant her attempt to accelerate her progress had backfired. Frustration welled up within her.  

"I—"  

Just as she was about to tell Gu Mo to stop, a warm, life-infused energy enveloped her. The energy merged with the healing pill's effects, rapidly repairing her injuries.  

"This is..."  

Yuan Niya's eyes flew open as she stared at Gu Mo in disbelief.  

"What? Is it so strange for a spirit farmer to know the Minor Restoration Technique?" Gu Mo said flatly. He had noticed Yuan Niya's predicament and could have chosen to do nothing—after all, she had brought it upon herself. But in the end, he decided to intervene.  

She had just given him a mid-grade magic sword as payment, after all. He had to make sure she felt it was money well spent.
