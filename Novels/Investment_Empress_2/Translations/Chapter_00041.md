# Chapter 41: The Ice Cube Teacher Goes Online, Li Mo’s Strange Talent

After Elder He鹤 left.

“Elder Shang Wu, do you have any arrangements for Li Mo these next few days?” Ying Bing asked.

Shang Wu slightly narrowed her almond-shaped eyes, thought for a moment, and said: “Nothing much, other than him cooking.”

“Then I’ll trouble you to lend him to me for three days.”

“I want him to learn sword arts with me for three days,” Ying Bing said softly.

After all, she wasn't Li Mo’s master. If she wanted to teach him something, she had to ask the ‘real master’ for permission.

“I trust your sword arts, Xiao Bing’er, but three days... what can he really learn?” Shang Wu nodded in agreement, yet was somewhat curious.

“I have this.”

Ying Bing took something out from her sleeve.

Three sky-blue incense sticks.

“Spiritual Rhinoceros Incense? The Sect Master actually gave you this? So generous...” Shang Wu’s almond eyes widened, clearly knowing the value of this item.

This was not a product of the Eastern Wilderness Region, but from the Central Divine Continent. It was ground from a rare treasure called the Spiritual Rhinoceros Wood, then refined with other precious materials.

Burning this item to comprehend martial arts could double one’s wisdom. However, the Spiritual Rhinoceros Wood grows slowly, taking three hundred years to grow an inch, making the yield extremely scarce.

The amount left in the sect shouldn't be much; it was left by the First Generation Ancestor, saved up by successive Sect Masters. To give Ying Bing three sticks at once was enough to show how much they valued her.

Shang Wu scratched her head, feeling somewhat embarrassed. It seemed that aside from giving her disciple two martial arts manuals, she had just been mooching meals off him...

“Wait, you mean, you want to use the Spiritual Rhinoceros Incense on Xiao Mo?” Shang Wu came back to her senses.

“Hmm, this item is useless to me,” Ying Bing nodded.

“Good, then I’ll be troubling you.”

“Tsk tsk... this kid is quite lucky,” Shang Wu smiled and nodded in agreement. Good stuff she couldn’t use, but it was the same if her disciple used it.

...

“Learn sword from you?”

Li Mo happened to have just opened another meridian. Eleven meridians; his small world expanded by a few more feet. Then he saw Ying Bing push the door open.

“Hmm, come down with me,” Ying Bing said with a calm expression, then turned and went downstairs.

“What’s going on all of a sudden...” Li Mo scratched his head, seeming to understand.

The Ice Cube isn’t a character good with words. She didn’t say anything about the matter at Clear Abyss, but she definitely remembered it in her heart.

It’s fine. With the Ice Cube around, he could save a lot of martial arts comprehension.

Knowing he isn’t a talent for sword training, Li Mo didn’t intend to give it up completely. Besides, he didn’t have any other martial arts to practice right now.

...

In the open space of the Autumn Water Pavilion.

Inside the copper furnace, green smoke curled up. The smell of this incense, upon smelling it, gave one a sense of clear-headedness and active thinking. Li Mo knew this was a good thing.

“From Great Completion to Perfection, it means you have truly turned the martial art into your own thing, no longer bound by forms,” Ying Bing said.

“Even, there is no need to rely on sword forms. Similarly, any sword form is a step closer to the true meaning of a sword path. Once you understand one, you understand a hundred.”

Ying Bing put two fingers together and gently wiped them over the bamboo beside her. Immediately, the trace of a crane feather appeared, but it wasn't fiery red; it was ice blue.

Li Mo widened his eyes slightly, inevitably amazed. The ‘Fire Crane Thousand Feathers’ had actually been turned into ‘Ice Crane Thousand Feathers’ by the Ice Cube. It showed that this high-level sword art had been completely understood and digested by her. He hadn't seen her practice it at all.

“The Transcendent state of your sword art should allow you to freely control the timing, quantity, and position of the force explosion. Even able to turn a thousand feathers into one, concentrating on a single point, dripping water pierces stone.”

As soon as the voice fell—

*Snap—*

One of the feathers suddenly exploded, its power actually ten times stronger than a single explosion.

“What you need to do now is to forget ‘forms’.”

“Pick up the sword.”

“Okay.”

Li Mo took out the chipped Blue Steel Sword. He was just about to make a move when a cold, soft, small hand grabbed his, followed by the fragrance of a young girl rushing at him.

Ying Bing tightly grasped his hand.

Li Mo: “!”

This felt different from when he jumped off Clear Abyss. Then it was free fall, his mind blank, how could he think of anything else. Now...

“Don’t get distracted, I’ll only lead you through it once,” a clear voice sounded in his ear.

Truly, teaching hand-in-hand. Even for her past disciples, there were many who were brilliant geniuses, she would at most give a pointer or two. Ying Bing had never taught someone so seriously.

“Okay.”

Li Mo calmed his mind and learned seriously.

A quarter of an hour later.

Ying Bing let go of his hand and silently stood to the side.

---

She held a ruler she seemed to have gotten from nowhere, looking at him with a calm gaze, her red lips slightly parted: “Practice.”

Li Mo: “.....”

The Ice Cube’s meaning, if he practices wrong, she’ll hit his palm with a whip?

Five minutes later, Li Mo got his answer.

It wasn’t the palm.

“I’m already this old, and you’re still hitting my butt!” Li Mo covered his rear in protest.

It didn’t hurt, but it was embarrassing!

“Hahahahaha!” Shang Wu laughed so hard she rolled back and forth on the lounge chair, tears flying out.

Ying Bing remained unmoved, lowering her eyes: “You forgot the form, but you just used a sword move again. Force comes from the ground, emitted from the meridians. You can do it without using sword forms.”

She didn’t mention the butt thing at all. There was no room for discussion.

Fine, fine, fine. If this Young Master Li doesn’t open the cheat a little, you really won’t treat me like a cheater, huh.

Martial Arts Comprehension, activate!

【Five years of Martial Arts Comprehension injected successfully.】

【Year 1: You accepted Ying Bing’s guidance, gained inspiration, and began striving to pursue the sword art’s essence, forgetting the existence of the sword forms.】

...

【Year 5: Through hard practice, you forgot half of the sword forms; the first three stances are no longer bound by shape.**

Damn.

With the Ice Cube’s guidance, after five years of comprehension, there’s only this much progress. If I had to grind it out by myself, who knows how much it would cost.

“I’m ready,” Li Mo picked up the sword and started demonstrating again.

“Really got it?” Watching him wield the sword, Ying Bing’s eyes showed a hint of surprise.

However, after a few moves, Li Mo stopped.

“Uh... can you lead me through it once more?”

“.......Okay,” Ying Bing paused for a moment, then nodded in agreement.

Thus, the Ice Cube Sword Art Class opened again.

...

“Wait a moment...”

“I got it! Let me practice with you again.”

...

This scene repeated itself.

Ying Bing felt an indescribable strangeness. It felt like Li Mo... was both smart and stupid?

He was very clumsy when being taught, often needing her to adjust and guide, even frequently making mistakes she considered very low-level.

But if he closed his eyes and thought for a bit, it was like an epiphany; all those flaws and mistakes disappeared.

After a while, he would ask her to teach the later parts again.

She didn’t know that Little Li was saving his Martial Arts Comprehension.

...

Three days later.

The Ice Cube, who had just broken through to the Twelfth Meridian, had a dream again that night.

She dreamed of the time when she was in charge of the Osmanthus Palace, before she had ascended to the Phoenix Heaven.

At that time, the Orthodox and Demonic paths of the Central Plains were fighting intensely. The Imperial Court watched the tigers fight from atop the mountain, adding fuel to the fire, wishing for the sects to mutually destroy each other.

The Osmanthus Palace was neither purely righteous nor purely evil, rarely intervening in the affairs of the Jianghu, yet it gathered nearly half of the powerful female cultivators from the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. Thus, both sides were trying their best to win it over.

But the Great Yu Dynasty obviously didn't want to see the Osmanthus Palace join either side, upsetting the balance.

Thus, the Prince Regent at the time prepared countless betrothal gifts that would make major forces envious and went up to the Osmanthus Palace.

“This Prince is willing to form a marriage alliance with the Palace Master of Osmanthus,结成永好 (forming eternal friendship/marriage).”

This wasn't the first time someone came to propose, but it was the one with the biggest fanfare. However, the outcome was no different. The opponent didn't even block three swords.

“This Lord has no interest in the weak.”

There were always people coming to disturb her, making her extremely annoyed. She actually had no interest in imperial hegemony or fighting and killing. Aside from stabilizing the peak of martial arts, there was nothing else she put in her heart.

So, she should have said that at the time. But later, through word of mouth, it changed into:

“The Palace Master of Osmanthus likes men stronger than her.”

This rumor persisted until she became the Phoenix Heaven Empress, but no one dared to challenge her anymore...

“Lately, I often dream...”

“Without reaching the Divine Observation Realm, I still can’t control my spirit,” Ying Bing got up, brushing off the frost on her shoulders.

The sound of sword dancing came from outside the window; she propped open the window. Under the sunlight, a少年 (youth) was wielding a sword.

The sword shadows would sometimes turn into hundreds and thousands, sometimes merge into one. Controlling them freely and smoothly, it was like a crane stretching its body.

Ying Bing watched quietly, the corner of her mouth curling up into a arc she herself didn't察觉 (notice).

She should be, quite a good teacher. Of course, it was also related to Li Mo’s talent.

It was strange. When someone taught him, he improved by leaps and bounds; when no one taught him, he was mediocre. But in any case, through ups and downs, he actually reached the Transcendent state with this high-level sword art.

Originally, Ying Bing thought it would be good if he reached Perfection. It could be said to have far exceeded expectations.

After half a month, when the system ranks the geniuses within the Eastern Wilderness Region, perhaps she might really see him in the middle of the list?
