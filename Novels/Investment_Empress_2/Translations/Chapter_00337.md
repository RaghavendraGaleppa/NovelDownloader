# Chapter 337: The Latest Foot Massage Techniques, and Best Wishes for an Early Birth of a Noble Son

Crackle—

The charcoal fire roasting skewers made a crisp sound, especially clear in the quiet tent.

“??”

Li Mo finally saw what had almost been stuffed into his mouth.

Actually, what he meant earlier was: Ice Cube, couldn’t you just grip the skewer tighter with more strength?

As everyone knows, he is a true gentleman, a fact known to all the soldiers of the Greenwood Camp.

“Ice Cube, you...”

“Want more?”

Ying Bing lightly pursed her lips, asking with a blank expression. However, the small foot on his face was clearly curling up slightly for some reason.

“.....”

The Little Li who supported his wife with his fighting spirit put on a serious expression.

Has this bad Ice Cube been... acting a bit too naughty recently?

“Are you still hungry, Little Brother?”

Seeing that he wasn’t speaking, her mirror-like eyes relaxed slightly.

Actually, she had been acting on a whim just now...

The thought had barely formed in her head before her little foot extended out. She wanted to withdraw it but couldn’t, leaving her in a somewhat awkward situation.

As long as Li Mo said, “I don’t want to eat anymore,” she could retract her foot and pretend nothing happened...

Li Mo straightened his body slightly, his loosely clenched fists tightening a bit.

Outside was a world of silver, yet Ying Bing wore a black *Liuxian* skirt, mysterious and noble, while the snowlight gave her a touch of holiness.

The Ice Cube seemed completely unaware of one thing.

Now that her little foot was extended and she called him “Little Brother” so casually, paired with her stunning face trying to maintain a calm demeanor, the deadly contrast was absolutely fatal.

“I’ll eat, but I won’t eat the skewers (breathy voice).”

“?”

“Ice Cube, you’ve been... way too bad these past two days! Ow...”

Little Li let out a heavy breath and suddenly reached out to grab her ankle.

He opened his mouth wide!!

However, the startup animation was a bit too long. His breath passed through her silk socks, making the Ice Cube shiver and reflexively kick out.

It’s just that Little Li’s hands still lacked strength.

He was just a tiny bit short.

He failed his sneak attack.

“Tsk tsk tsk, ‘Are you still hungry, Little Brother’?”

Just as Shang Qinqing flew into the tent, she saw their Green Phoenix Goddess attacking the Peerless Flood Dragon with the sole of her foot.

The latter leaned back tactically, but ultimately, due to his injury, he was slightly inferior and failed to catch that little foot.

Unfortunately, she didn’t know how to draw; otherwise, she would have definitely captured this scene on paper.

“Elder Shang, what brings you here?”

The gentlemanly Little Li sat up properly immediately, picking up the skewers as if nothing had happened, only for the skewers to slip out of his palm again.

“Aren’t you going to say hello?”

Ying Bing looked as if she had amnesia, her expression serious as she lightly hooked her boots with her feet.

“Oh, oh, oh, I wasn’t even talking about that yet.”

Shang Qinqing was displeased and spoke righteously: “Last time at the Void Suspension Temple, forget about saying hello, you two secretly watched for so long and even bumped your heads together. I didn’t want to call you out on it.”

“What’s wrong with me bumping heads now?”

Elder Shang felt perfectly justified in her head-bumping.

Li Mo remembered what happened at the Void Suspension Temple last time.

So, when a person is embarrassed...

“Ice Cube, how do you feel about the latest foot massage techniques?”

“Not bad.”

“Hmm, I will continue my research and strive to bring the foot massage techniques of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands to a brand new level...”

“.....”

Shang Qinqing watched the two of them talking nonsense with such seriousness and lightly rolled her eyes.

Then she sat to the side, supporting her chin with one hand, smiling, not eating anything, just drinking water and laughing.

She even let out occasional bursts of “kuku ku” laughter.

---

It was Li Mo who was curious about her purpose and asked:

“So, Elder Shang, you came to...”

“Oh, I was having too much fun head-bumping, I almost forgot.”

Shang Qinqing slapped her forehead:

“Wu Qing and the others are still waiting outside the city.”

Greenwood City had methods to detect demon clans. That crocodile head on the city wall, refined by a master, was extremely powerful. Usually, not even a Demon King could sneak in silently.

Shang Qinqing’s bloodline power was special, allowing her to traverse the void, which was how she could cross the city wall.

But Wu Qing and the others couldn’t do that.

So Li Mo needed to go inform Qu Sheng; otherwise, while everyone was eating dumplings, the highest alert might suddenly sound...

“I’ll go inform Commander Qu.”

Li Mo went outside the tent.

Commander Qu was in a great mood today. He, who hadn’t drunk alcohol for years, was celebrating with his soldiers, his laughter hearty and uninhibited.

“Commander, I have a few friends. Can they come join us for dumplings?”

“Oh? Friends of Young Hero Li, of course they can.”

Commander Qu agreed without hesitation.

Li Mo, afraid of causing a misunderstanding, said:

“It’s just that their identities might be a bit special...”

“How are they special?”

“They practice mimicry martial arts quite well.”

“???”

Little Li decided to tell the truth and told Commander Qu the real situation. Unexpectedly, Commander Qu agreed very readily.

This border army commander, who had been stationed in Greenwood City for a long time, actually understood the various tribes of the Southern Frontier quite well. He didn’t排斥 (reject) normal demon clans much and even cooperated with them occasionally.

For example, the fields around Greenwood City were plowed by the Green Ox demon clan.

After getting the permission.

Li Mo also went to the kitchen to tell them to send more skewers and dumplings.

When he saw Shang Qinqing, he roughly understood.

When he and the Ice Cube returned to Greenwood City, they hadn’t encountered high-level disaster beasts. It was very likely that those demon clans had helped by holding back the disaster beasts.

Regardless of the reason, it was a huge help.

Moreover.

He had a favor to ask, regarding the Power of Faith.

Many disaster beasts had died in the Southern Frontier, meaning many towns had lost their ‘Witch Spirit Masters’.

The experiences along the way taught Li Mo that simply killing the ‘gods’ before their eyes was useless. The ignorant people still had a statue of a god in their hearts, a statue that couldn’t be toppled in a day.

It could only be done slowly.

So, during this process, it was reasonable for him to collect some Power of Faith...

Not long after.

The military tent was filled with a group of ‘warriors’ who practiced mimicry martial arts quite well.

The great demon kings and grand demons, aside from Wu Qing who already knew, all felt a bit complicated.

After all, these two little guys had taken the Heaven-Extending Divine Jade right under their noses, and they were even regarded as the future hope of the demon race.

“Sigh, Wu... Li Mo, Ying Bing...”

The middle-aged man of the Giant Whale clan sighed.

“There were reasons for what happened, please forgive us. However, everything I said before came from the heart.”

Li Mo’s expression was serious as he brought over a large pot of dumplings.

“From now on, I will still share the Heaven-Extending Divine Jade with everyone regularly.”

“Wow, these dumplings are really delicious, how did you research them?”

Guo Chuan slurped a mouthful, drinking a bowl of dumplings directly like soup.

“Tsk, what a pity, still a pity.”

The bald Peng Lingyuan ate skewers, tears streaming down his face as he muttered to himself:

“I’ve thought about one question for a long time. What kind of offspring would be born from True Phoenix and True Dragon bloodlines.”

“But you guys are actually humans...”

“Didn’t I already wish you an early birth of a noble son?!”
