# Chapter 46: You Fight Above Your Level While I Take It Easy  

Deep within the Black Snake Abyss, at a certain fork in the path.  

Qi Chuan leaned against the stone wall beside him and merely nodded in response to Murong Fan's suggestion.  

He had no intention of taking the lead.  

Since Murong Fan had volunteered to deal with the stronger female snake, Qi Chuan naturally went along with it—it saved him the trouble.  

"Shall we get started, then?" Murong Fan glanced at Qi Chuan, seeking his opinion.  

"I'm fine with anything," Qi Chuan replied with a nod.  

"Then let's begin!" Murong Fan said in a low voice.  

With that, he dashed forward first, heading toward the leftmost path ahead.  

"Hiss—"  

The moment he revealed himself without concealment, the pair of black jade spirit snakes—one male, one female—nesting midway down the leftmost path immediately became alert. Their slender black necks arched high, their forked tongues flickering, and their vertical black pupils glinted with a cold, menacing light as they fixed their gaze on Murong Fan.  

With a sharp flick of their tails, the rocks beneath them shattered into dust with a loud *crack*, sending up a cloud of debris. Amid the swirling dust, two black shadows darted forward at incredible speed, charging straight for Murong Fan.  

Seeing this, Murong Fan let out a low shout and pulled out a small cyan-black umbrella artifact from his robes. Channeling his spiritual energy, the umbrella instantly expanded, forming a canopy-like shield above his head. Rings of light radiated from it, creating a protective barrier around him.  

The edges of the umbrella were lined with sharp, blade-like protrusions, gleaming with a razor-sharp edge.  

*Boom!*  

A black shadow shot out from the dust, its tail slamming heavily against the barrier conjured by the umbrella. The shield flickered unsteadily under the impact.  

Since Murong Fan had charged directly at the female snake, she was the first to attack him.  

When her initial strike failed to break through, the female snake's cold eyes flashed with malice. Her maw gaped wide as demonic energy surged within, and she spat out a thick, black mist that enveloped the barrier. A potent corrosive force spread across the shield, causing it to flicker even more violently.  

"This female snake's strength is already bordering on the early fifth layer of Qi Refinement—almost comparable to a mid-stage fifth-layer cultivator!"  

Inside the protective barrier, Murong Fan's expression darkened.  

His cyan-black umbrella was a top-grade first-tier artifact, formidable in its own right. But facing a demon beast with strength nearing the fifth layer of Qi Refinement still posed a significant risk.  

Moreover, the corrosive mist the female snake had spat out was unusually potent, weakening his barrier further.  

"Still, this alone won't be enough to break my artifact."  

Murong Fan remained composed. With another surge of spiritual energy, the umbrella began to spin rapidly, its bladed edges whirling like a storm of blades, slashing toward the female snake.  

Sensing the lethal threat, the snake recoiled, retreating slightly to avoid the onslaught.  

"Tsk, another high-quality top-grade artifact."  

Not far away, Qi Chuan had already moved into action. A gray shadow whirled around him at high speed, forming a protective barrier while simultaneously intercepting the male black jade spirit snake.  

As he engaged the male snake in battle, his gaze occasionally flicked toward Murong Fan's fight with the female.  

The female snake was clearly formidable, her strength approaching that of a fifth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator.  

Yet, despite being at the fourth layer, Murong Fan was holding his own.  

This not only spoke to Murong Fan's deep reserves of spiritual energy for his level but also indicated that his cyan-black umbrella was an exceptionally strong artifact.  

It reminded Qi Chuan of the golden ring artifact he had seen Qi Chan'er use back in the Cloudrise Mountains—another versatile, high-grade treasure.  

In comparison, his own top-grade artifact, "Flying Ash," seemed rather mediocre.  

"Such is the disparity of background..."  

Qi Chuan sighed inwardly.  

Qi Chan'er had the backing of her grandfather, a revered elder in the Red Maple Valley, who had undoubtedly gone to great lengths to procure such a fine artifact for her.  

Similarly, Murong Fan likely owed his impressive umbrella to the generosity of his own elders.  

Meanwhile, Qi Chuan's "Flying Ash" had been a reward from the Qi family after he secured an inner sect position in the Breeze Moon Sect—undoubtedly inferior to artifacts personally selected by powerful mentors.  

"Still, even with such a powerful artifact, Murong Fan is struggling against the female snake, whose strength borders on the fifth layer. The risks are high."  

"Indeed, crossing realms in battle is generally unwise."  

Watching the sweat beading on Murong Fan's forehead, Qi Chuan shook his head slightly.  

That said, Murong Fan wasn't in immediate danger of losing.  

Turning his attention back to the male snake before him, Qi Chuan noted the stark difference in strength.  

This male was noticeably smaller than the female and only possessed the standard power of a fourth-layer Qi Refinement beast.  

Given Qi Chuan's fifth-layer cultivation, handling it was effortless. He fought with ease, even sparing the focus to observe Murong Fan's battle.  

"No need to stand out by finishing too quickly. Murong Fan seems to be managing, albeit with difficulty. He shouldn't need my help."  

"Taking it easy benefits everyone."  

With that in mind, Qi Chuan deliberately prolonged his fight with the male snake.  

Meanwhile, Murong Fan, fully engrossed in his own battle, remained oblivious to Qi Chuan's relaxed approach.  

As time passed, Qi Chuan decided it was time to wrap things up. With a slight increase in spiritual energy output—  

*Whoosh!*  

"Flying Ash" accelerated abruptly, slicing through the air and cleanly severing the male snake's neck.  

*Thud!*  

A thin red line appeared on the snake's throat before its head toppled to the ground, blood gushing from the severed stump.  

Only then did Qi Chuan glance back at Murong Fan and call out, "Brother Murong, need any help?"  

"No need. I'm almost done," Murong Fan gritted out between strikes.  

Clenching his teeth, he pushed more spiritual energy into his artifact, eager to end the fight.  

After all, Qi Chuan had already finished his battle. Lingering too long against a beast that barely surpassed his own level would be embarrassing.  

Yet, even with his renewed effort, it still took him some time to finally slay the female snake.  

*Thud!*  

The massive female snake, its neck half-severed, collapsed lifelessly to the ground.  

Murong Fan exhaled heavily, his tense body slumping against the cave wall as he finally relaxed.  

Sweat drenched his forehead, and his breathing was ragged—clear signs of exhaustion.  

Fortunately, when he looked over, Qi Chuan showed no intention of approaching, merely standing at a distance, waiting for him to recover.  

"Still... Brother Qi seems to have dealt with his snake rather effortlessly."  

Observing Qi Chuan's calm demeanor and steady breathing, Murong Fan's brow furrowed imperceptibly as a thought crossed his mind.
