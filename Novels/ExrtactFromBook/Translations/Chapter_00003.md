# Chapter 3: The Meat Distribution  

A streak of golden light flashed across the sky as Han Yue appeared above the clouds at an altitude of five thousand meters.  

Here, the fierce winds howled, a place where neither man nor beast could easily reach. Han Yue’s already tattered clothes were completely shredded by the gales. All that remained on his body was a white fox-fur bundle, which he used to cover his vital areas, barely preserving a shred of dignity.  

The bamboo basket and provisions he had carried on his back earlier had long since been scattered to who knows where. Han Yue hadn’t expected the natural environment of this otherworld to be so savage. Even at just a few thousand meters in the air, the force of the winds was enough to be fatal to an ordinary person.  

Fortunately, Han Yue had already reached the first stage of cultivation—the Body Entry Realm. His physical resilience was no longer what it used to be, strong enough to withstand these violent winds.  

By now, Han Yue had long since left the City Lord’s estate far behind. Along his journey, he had traversed countless mountains and rivers, experiencing firsthand the madness of this world.  

In just the past half-day, Han Yue had lost count of how many times he had used the **[Earth-Traversing Golden Light Technique]**. Each time he transformed into light and fled, the distance he covered ranged from several kilometers to several dozen. The farthest leap had taken him from a ten-thousand-meter-high mountain, crossing over three hundred kilometers in an instant, only to reappear atop an even more colossal peak.  

Han Yue reveled in this sensation of lightning-fast speed! The sheer exhilaration of extreme velocity had him utterly enthralled. It was far more thrilling than piloting an airplane in his past life!  

What was even more astonishing was that, despite Han Yue’s perception of having traveled over a hundred thousand kilometers, the landscape beneath his feet remained unchanged—an endless expanse of dense, primordial forest.  

A superforest stretching far beyond a hundred thousand kilometers, teeming with countless savage beasts and demonic creatures! The mere thought of it sent shivers down Han Yue’s spine.  

Along the way, he had witnessed all manner of bizarre and ferocious beasts thriving in the jungle, living and breeding in the ruthless competition of survival of the fittest.  

Han Yue had once observed a battle between two monstrous creatures.  

One was a giant ape, massive as a mountain, wielding an unsharpened stone axe. It had hacked a slightly smaller white elephant into a bloody mess before finally snapping off its tusks and carrying them away.  

That battle had left an indelible impression on Han Yue.  

The mere shockwave from the stone axe slamming into the elephant’s head had shattered the sound barrier, wreaking havoc on the surrounding environment.  

The giant ape and the white elephant were undoubtedly demonic beasts of at least the second rank or higher. Han Yue, like an insignificant ant, had hidden at a distance, terrified of being caught in the crossfire of their battle.  

After careful consideration, Han Yue realized that only by unleashing the full accumulated energy of his **[Thoughtless Slash]** could he possibly inflict any damage on such monstrous beings.  

He was still far too weak.  

Without sufficient strength, there was not a shred of security in this world overrun by demons. The desire to grow stronger took root in Han Yue’s heart, steadily sprouting and flourishing.  

Of course, the most pressing matter for Han Yue now was finding a safe place to rest.  

The continuous use of his divine abilities had left him physically and mentally exhausted. More importantly, the **[Earth-Traversing Golden Light Technique]** talisman in his consciousness was rapidly dimming as its energy reserves dwindled.  

With this in mind, Han Yue steeled himself and transformed into golden light once more, streaking toward the horizon.  

---  

At the edge of the Spirit Sword Gorge in Guizhou lay a massive, never-ending marketplace known as the **"Meat Distribution."**  

Legend had it that the entire market was home to a hundred thousand Body Entry Realm cultivators. In reality, the number was likely even higher.  

The core of the marketplace was laid out in a grid pattern, divided into four distinct sections: **"Heaven," "Earth," "Mystic," and "Yellow,"** covering an enormous area.  

Each section was further subdivided into a hundred plots, arranged in a ten-by-ten grid. Each plot covered exactly fifty acres.  

Though the plots were uniformly distributed, the buildings upon them were scattered like stars, each unique in form.  

The **"Heaven," "Earth," "Mystic," and "Yellow"** sections each had ninety-nine independent plots, with one corner missing. The central plot of each section was combined with the open space at the crossroads of the grid, forming a massive square plaza.  

And at this very moment, a frenzied and bustling feast was underway in this plaza.  

A colossal bovine carcass lay sprawled across the square, surrounded by a team of people working feverishly.  

The carcass stretched fifty meters long—more like a mountain of meat than an animal.  

A highly skilled team was in the midst of butchering it. They wielded massive enchanted saws, gutting the beast, skinning it, and extracting its organs with practiced efficiency.  

After a full hour of labor, the carcass had been reduced to nothing but fresh meat and bones. The entire process was smooth, efficient, and strangely beautiful.  

Then, the team set up large tables at the four cardinal directions of the plaza. The butchered meat was placed atop them.  

Next, a person stepped forward at each table and began slicing the meat into thin strips.  

The residents of the **"Heaven," "Earth," "Mystic," and "Yellow"** sections began gathering around the tables nearest to them.  

No one needed to organize them—they formed orderly lines of their own accord.  

Each person in line would take their share of meat before turning and leaving.  

Many others, however, didn’t join the queue. Instead, they stood by, watching the spectacle of the meat distribution unfold.  

Everything proceeded smoothly—until an issue arose.  

The speed of the meat distribution couldn’t keep up with the growing line!  

The reason? Though there were four tables, only three butchers were working.  

Three butchers divided the meat, with assistants transferring portions from their tables to the fourth.  

This ensured the work continued, but the process was significantly slowed.  

More and more onlookers noticed the problem. Murmurs spread through the crowd as if they had been waiting for this very moment.  

Then, someone in the line couldn’t take it anymore.  

A muscular young woman—or perhaps a maiden with the build of a titan—leapt forward and shouted:  

**"Heaven Section, Plot Nine, is hiring a butcher!"**  

**"Generous pay! Join us and you’re family!"**  

**"No matter which section or plot you’re from, no matter your past or your sins!"**  

**"If you dare to come, Heaven Section Plot Nine will take responsibility for you!"**  

Her voice, infused with spiritual energy, carried far and wide.  

This was the same woman who had been wielding the massive saw earlier.  

With her declaration, the problem was laid bare.  

Everyone now saw the butchers’ predicament—yet no one stepped forward to help.  

Instead, many who had been watching joined the meat line, adding even more pressure.  

As time passed, the situation only worsened.  

The woman grew increasingly anxious.  

Then, a voice rang out:  

**"I’ll apply for the butcher position! Can I give it a try?"**  

The speaker was a young man with a gentle, amiable face and a shy smile.  

In one hand, he held a kitchen knife. On his back, he carried a white fox-fur bundle.  

It was Han Yue, who had crossed thousands of miles to get here.  

The woman didn’t even bother scrutinizing him. She immediately dragged Han Yue to the empty table.  

Han Yue set down his bundle, picked up a two-meter-long slab of meat, and unsheathed his dark golden kitchen knife.  

Then, he began to slice.
