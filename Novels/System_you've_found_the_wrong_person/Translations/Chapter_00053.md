# Chapter 53: Enough Talk, Let's Fight!

The Northern Sun King's residence.

Dou Changsheng stood facing the wind, watching as a young man stepped down from a carriage. The youth was the same age as him—eighteen. Having ascended the throne four years ago, that meant he had become emperor at the tender age of fourteen. In just four short years, despite conspiracies and covert manipulations, losing the loyalty of the imperial clan, regional factions, and even the military marked him as a true prodigy of self-destruction.

However, this Northern Sun King was a deposed emperor, a figure of extraordinary significance. Even confined to his residence, never stepping beyond its gates, his mere existence ensured that whenever the Empress enacted policies, those whose interests were harmed would resent her and rally behind the young emperor. And even if no one did, there was always Chen Qingyao—this former ruler was bound to stir the winds of change once more.

Dou Changsheng studied the young emperor, who also raised his head to meet his gaze. The emperor's face was deathly pale, as if untouched by sunlight for far too long, and his eyes gradually filled with malice as they locked onto Dou Changsheng.

A sinking feeling settled in Dou Changsheng's chest.

Damn it.

He's marked me.

This guy's beyond saving.

Dou Changsheng understood all too well. The young emperor, having fallen to such depths, refused to reflect on his own failures and instead blamed everything on external conspiracies—with Dou Changsheng undoubtedly cast as the mastermind. Even if the emperor didn't believe Dou Changsheng was involved, he would still resent him for exposing Qingyang Daoist's fake death. If only Qingyang Daoist had succeeded, the emperor could have shouldered the blame—wouldn't that have been better?

As the young emperor paused mid-step, Ma Liren approached and urged him forward. The emperor finally tore his venomous gaze away and continued toward the residence, though not without one last glance at Dou Changsheng—a silent promise that this wasn't over.

How I'd love to run him through with my sword.

Dou Changsheng suppressed the impulse. The young emperor's status was too sensitive; no one could afford the consequences of killing him.

It all came down to insufficient strength. If he were ranked first on the Earthly Rankings, the Great Jin court wouldn't dare utter a word. The official narrative would simply declare that the young emperor had "dissolved in water."

After exchanging a few final words with Ma Liren and declining his invitation, Dou Changsheng let out a quiet sigh of relief. The task assigned by Grand General Yu Yun was now complete. Whether the adopted son was truly a spy or not, Dou Changsheng didn't care—he had already relayed the information through the covert channels provided by the military command. Verifying its authenticity was Yu Yun's problem. After all, Dou Changsheng trusted that Dou Taizhen wouldn't feed him false information.

His gaze swept the surroundings, landing on his nominal younger sister standing nearby. Just as he was about to approach to bid her farewell, a dark-skinned, burly man strode toward them with purposeful steps.

The man was clad in black, his piercing eyes sharp and alert. His pronounced temples and unnaturally protruding knuckles—resembling ghostly claws—marked him as someone not to be trifled with. 

Stopping before Dou Changsheng, the man clasped his fists and announced, "I am Wang Chongguang of the Northern Sun King's faction. Hearing that the Infinite Sword Lord escorted the Northern Sun King to his fief, I came to pay my respects at the residence gates. I wish to invite the Sword Lord into the manor so our local dignitaries may witness your esteemed presence."

Wang Chongguang, the Divine Marvel Grandmaster.

Dou Changsheng immediately recognized the name—this was one of the unfortunate souls who would meet their end at the hands of Future Dou. However, Wang Chongguang was no weakling. The fact that Future Dou hadn't even attempted a direct confrontation but instead resorted to using a divine weapon spoke volumes about the man's strength.

Still, Dou Changsheng didn't consider Wang Chongguang an enemy just because of their future conflict. That was a timeline three years from now—one where the young emperor had already been deposed. With each passing day, Dou Changsheng's influence grew, ensuring that their paths would inevitably diverge.

His gaze shifted to Dou Taizhen, who now appeared meek and delicate in public—a stark contrast to the woman who had recently lectured at the Jixia Academy, an honor reserved only for Earthly Ranking grandmasters. Her face was veiled behind a white silk scarf as she spoke in a gentle tone, "The journey has been tiring. A short rest would be welcome."

Wang Chongguang seized the opportunity. "Hot water has already been prepared in the manor. I recently acquired some rare eastern Qi tulips—perfect for a bath to wash away the dust of travel. They would suit the Sword Lord and his sister well."

Dou Taizhen bowed gracefully. "Many thanks, Elder Wang."

At the same time, a cold voice whispered into Dou Changsheng's ear: "This is no friendly banquet—it's a trap. A Divine Marvel Grandmaster wouldn't personally invite you without ulterior motives. The only things of value you possess are limited. His foundations are already set—the Three Origins Unity Art is useless to him. He specializes in palm techniques, not swordsmanship. The Hero's Sword and the Thirteen Golden Swords techniques hold no appeal. His internal injuries prevent him from advancing further, stalling his ascent to Pure Yang enlightenment. His goal is obvious: the secret technique to condense Rebirth Mystic Water. When a senior discards all dignity on the martial path, how will you handle it?"

Dou Taizhen stepped into the carriage, her eyes alight with amusement as she observed Dou Changsheng and Wang Chongguang, eager to see how events would unfold for her entertainment. If Dou Changsheng died? So be it. Geniuses were a dime a dozen—she could always find another. The top spot on the Human Rankings would never stay vacant for long.

Upon arriving at the manor, Dou Changsheng noted its emptiness—no other guests in sight. Wang Chongguang couldn't even be bothered to put on a pretense anymore.

Not surprising.

This was the same Wang Chongguang, a Divine Marvel Grandmaster a full realm above Future Dou, who had shamelessly waited until Bloody-Handed Jin Sanming was defeated before launching a sneak attack. The fact that he resorted to ambush tactics instead of facing his opponent head-on spoke volumes about his character.

The manor gates slammed shut.

Wang Chongguang's expression turned grave as he declared, "I had planned to negotiate properly—offer you something in exchange for the Qingyang Secret Art and the method to condense Rebirth Mystic Water. That way, you'd gain benefits, I'd obtain the mystic water, and everyone would be happy. But heaven favors me. You brought your sister along. Hand over the secret technique, and I'll spare her. Otherwise..."

His grotesque claw of a hand reached toward Dou Taizhen's pale neck as he leered, "She won't live to see another day. Such a pretty face—I might not be able to control myself. Then we'd truly be family."

Before Wang Chongguang could finish his threats, Dou Changsheng cut him off coldly: "Enough talk. Let's fight! Your wealth is already mine!"
