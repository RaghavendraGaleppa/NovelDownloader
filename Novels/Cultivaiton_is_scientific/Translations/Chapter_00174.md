# Chapter 174: Reaping Benefits  

"I'll cultivate here for a while. Ideally, I should reach Foundation Establishment!" Li Shiming thought to himself.  

Having unexpectedly obtained the Wei Clan's stronghold, protected by such a formidable formation, he decided to stay and cultivate.  

Joining the Thousand Illusions Sect required traveling there first, but given the current situation, crossing the Hundred Thousand Mountains would be extremely troublesome. If he became a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he might have a better chance of protecting himself along the way.  

Moreover, he was already at the ninth level of Qi Refinement. If not for the invasion by the Northern Shu Mingxin Sect, he would have likely applied for a secluded cultivation chamber in the Tianhai Sect—just like Yin Shilan—to cultivate for several months before attempting his breakthrough to Foundation Establishment.  

Foundation Establishment held immense allure for Qi Refinement cultivators, and Li Shiming was no exception.  

The lifespan of a Qi Refinement cultivator was 150 years, while a Foundation Establishment cultivator could live for 200 years. In terms of life essence, Foundation Establishment cultivators were a higher form of existence and a necessary step toward the Golden Core stage.  

Why had Li Shiming abandoned the luxuries of mortal life to pursue the path of cultivation? It was all for the hope of longevity. Having reincarnated into this world, he might as well chase an extraordinary dream.  

He summoned the main spirit of the *Soul-Splitting Control Technique*, which then split into ten smaller spirits that scattered to the surrounding mountaintops to monitor the area.  

As for the Tie Clan cultivators attacking the formation outside the valley, he paid them no mind.  

There was no need. He was now in control of the formation. If a high-level formation master like him, with such favorable conditions, allowed mere Foundation Establishment cultivators to breach the formation, he would be a disgrace to his knowledge of formations.  

His only concern was powerful Golden Core cultivators. Releasing the split spirits was a precaution against that slim possibility.  

Now, he finally had time to examine the cave dwelling. The dwelling wasn’t luxurious but was exquisitely crafted, clearly built with great care.  

He stood in the main hall, where the upper-grade spiritual vein was located—an unusual arrangement, as most cave dwellings would channel the spiritual vein into a cultivation chamber rather than leaving it in the center of the hall.  

The dwelling had three additional rooms. Extending his spiritual sense, he inspected the first room.  

Inside were wooden shelves lined with jade boxes, each labeled with the name of the spiritual herb it contained.  

Li Shiming found over fifty types of spiritual herbs, all second-grade—materials required for Foundation Establishment-level pills.  

Though the number of jade boxes seemed substantial, they were actually quite limited. Crafting a single type of pill required over a dozen herbs, so the collection here was only enough for a few batches.  

Having no expertise in alchemy, he swept his spiritual sense over the room and stored all the jade boxes without opening them.  

The second room was a library. Inside, he found all the books sold in the market outside, though these were preserved in jade slips.  

Additionally, there was a cultivation manual that could lead to the Golden Core stage, three combat techniques, an alchemy manual, and a talisman-making manual.  

"Why aren’t there any formation jade slips?" Li Shiming muttered with slight disappointment.  

Truthfully, he was quite surprised. The Wei Clan was just an ordinary cultivation family, yet they possessed a Golden Core-level manual—something even the seven major sects of Tianhai Island guarded closely.  

Of course, he wasn’t particularly interested in it. He had better options.  

For now, he didn’t have time to study them. He would scan these jade slips into his IBMz15 later and review them at leisure.  

With another sweep of his spiritual sense, he emptied the Wei Clan’s library.  

The third room stored spirit stones. Li Shiming collected them without much excitement—less than 200,000 stones weren’t particularly impressive.  

He shook his head. He wasn’t sure if this was the Wei Clan’s treasury or the personal stash of the early-stage Foundation Establishment elder. If it was the clan’s treasury, their wealth was rather meager.  

What he didn’t know was that the Wei Clan had to support the cultivation of several Foundation Establishment cultivators, which consumed vast resources. Being able to save any spirit stones at all was already an achievement.  

The library he had dismissed so easily was the result of generations of collection.  

The second-grade herbs had only been gathered in the past year. Once enough were accumulated, they would be used to refine pills for the clan’s Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

As for other treasures, they were in the hands of individual Foundation Establishment cultivators—why would they be left to gather dust in storage?  

Li Shiming then examined the storage pouch of the early-stage Foundation Establishment elder. It contained no spirit stones or many treasures.  

Aside from the self-defense spirit artifact, the *Red Copper Fire Refining Bell*, the elder only had one offensive spirit artifact—the *Red Copper Heaven-Earth Staff*.  

What Li Shiming didn’t know was that this elder was the oldest and most respected figure in the Wei Clan, as well as a talisman master capable of crafting Foundation Establishment-level talismans. Naturally, his personal wealth was the richest in the clan.  

In his old age, he had left most of his possessions to the clan, keeping only one offensive and one defensive spirit artifact.  

Even these two artifacts were meant to be inherited by clan members after his death.  

Aside from these, the storage pouch contained a talisman brush. Its spiritual glow far surpassed any of the brushes Li Shiming had used before.  

There was also an ordinary jade slip. Placing it against his forehead, he found it contained a talisman inheritance—the elder’s personal legacy.  

Unfortunately, Li Shiming wasn’t yet at the Foundation Establishment stage and hadn’t learned Foundation Establishment-level spells. He would have to wait until his breakthrough to study this inheritance.  

The rest of the pouch contained second-grade talisman materials, which still held some value.  

Thinking of the various buildings in the stronghold, Li Shiming sent his avatar to search them.  

As he went through each one, his disappointment grew. The outer buildings also had storage rooms, but they only contained Qi Refinement-level materials—nothing particularly valuable.  

The storage pouches of Wei Lin and Tie Laosan didn’t contain any spirit artifacts. Tie Laosan, in particular, had no super-grade magical tools left after self-destructing his own.  

Wei Lin wasn’t much better off. His only super-grade magical tool had been damaged in the battle with Tie Laosan’s self-destruction, and in Li Shiming’s eyes, it wasn’t worth repairing.  

However, he did find a secret manual in Tie Laosan’s pouch—the technique that allowed him to self-destruct his super-grade magical tool.  

The technique wasn’t particularly complex. Tie Laosan had a passion for artifact refinement, and though his skills weren’t exceptional, he was clever enough to discover a way to destabilize a magical tool’s internal structure.  

The technique inflicted significant backlash on the user, but the explosion’s power was equally formidable—its strength depended on the tool’s quality and the amount of the user’s blood essence sacrificed.  

Earlier, Tie Laosan had spat three mouthfuls of blood essence in desperation, causing his super-grade magical tool to explode and severely injure Wei Lin, who was of the same cultivation level.  

Even with his considerable wealth, Li Shiming couldn’t help but wince at the technique. It was essentially throwing money at an enemy.  

But in a life-or-death situation, it was an excellent last resort.  

What interested him wasn’t the technique itself but its underlying principle. Once he had time to study artifact refinement, he might refine the technique to reduce backlash while increasing the explosion’s power.  

After scouring the entire Wei Clan stronghold, the only valuable find was a massive alchemy furnace.  

The furnace burned a type of spiritual charcoal, stored in a fifty-cubic-meter storage pouch beside it—completely full.  

Li Shiming collected everything of value, including gold and silver. With plenty of storage pouches, he didn’t mind the hassle.  

"Avatar, go check that spot," Li Shiming said from the formation’s control core. While reviewing the complete formation schematics provided by IBMz15, he noticed an anomaly.  

The handsome-faced avatar smiled faintly and walked toward the location—about thirty meters from the cave dwelling.  

The spot was peculiar because it was a blank area in the formation.  

The avatar’s spiritual sense swept over it but found nothing unusual.  

Yet, the absence of any anomaly was the greatest oddity. Since he was deliberately searching with his spiritual sense, this wall—located inside the formation—should have shown some reaction to the formation’s energy.  

The avatar lightly tapped the stone wall and found it solid.  

He then meticulously inspected the surrounding area with his spiritual sense, refusing to believe no traces could be left.  

He already suspected the purpose of this spot, so he searched with intent. Soon, he noticed faint friction marks on an inconspicuous stone on the ground—marks so subtle they could easily be overlooked.  

Following the direction of the marks, he twisted the stone. It rotated effortlessly, and after a full turn, the stone wall suddenly receded, revealing a hidden passage.  

"What clever craftsmanship!" Li Shiming couldn’t help but praise.  

This was a secret tunnel, constructed from a material that blocked spiritual sense. Instead of relying on cultivation techniques, it used mortal engineering.  

If the Wei Clan’s formation were breached, clan members could escape through this passage.  

Invaders, unable to control the formation core immediately after breaking the formation, wouldn’t notice the tunnel’s existence.  

By the time they repaired and reactivated the formation, the Wei Clan members would have long since fled.  

The avatar followed the tunnel and found its exit at the bottom of a river outside the valley.  

Li Shiming felt relieved. With this escape route, he no longer had to worry about being trapped if the formation fell.  

Meanwhile, in the valley, the two Tie Clan Foundation Establishment cultivators and over thirty Qi Refinement cultivators had been attacking the formation for a long time—to no avail.  

Tie Laoda’s expression darkened. Not only had they failed to breach the Wei Clan stronghold, but they had also lost Tie Laosan.  

Leaving now would be bitter, but what else could they do? Stay here indefinitely?  

"Contact the Hu Clan. Tell them we’re willing to split the spoils fifty-fifty if they help us break this formation," Tie Laoda ordered a Qi Refinement clansman after a moment of thought.  

The clansman bowed and left, while the others ceased their attacks and rested.  

Li Shiming left his avatar in the cave dwelling’s main hall and moved his true body to the stronghold’s entrance.  

He took out the Mount Shu Seal and, from behind the formation’s protective barrier, activated it to fly outward.  

One advantage of formations was that outsiders couldn’t observe the inside—neither attacks nor spiritual senses could penetrate unless the formation was broken.  

The Wei Clan cultivators hadn’t been able to attack from inside the formation due to their lack of formation knowledge.  

Li Shiming had no such limitations. He activated the Mount Shu Seal, which had been fully recharged since its last use.  

Instead of targeting the Foundation Establishment cultivators—a futile effort—he aimed at the group of resting Qi Refinement cultivators.  

The Mount Shu Seal transformed into a mountain and crashed down on the unsuspecting group.  

The cultivators, relaxed with their clan’s Foundation Establishment experts nearby, never expected an attack.  

As the mountain descended, its restraining force immobilized the Qi Refinement cultivators within its range.  

With a thunderous crash, twelve Tie Clan Qi Refinement cultivators were crushed into paste.  

The mountain swiftly shrank back into a beam of light and returned to the formation.  

The entire sequence happened too quickly. The lengthy activation of the Mount Shu Seal had been done inside the formation, while the actual attack and retrieval took less than a breath.  

By the time Tie Laoda and Tie Laoliu reacted, it was too late.  

"Fall back! Now!" Tie Laoda roared in fury.  

The loss of twelve Qi Refinement cultivators was a devastating blow.  

Though cultivation families recruited children with spiritual roots from outside their bloodlines, nurturing them into combat-ready mid-to-late Qi Refinement cultivators required immense resources and effort.  

This single strike had wiped out a third of the Tie Clan’s future talent.  

He glared hatefully at the formation, unable to see who had attacked. His hatred for the Wei Clan reached new heights.  

Li Shiming smiled as he put away the Mount Shu Seal. The artifact was incredibly useful, and he had maximized its potential in both uses.  

The only downside was its lengthy recharge time. Without sufficient spiritual power, its effectiveness would drop significantly.  

His attack had killed four late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators—he had targeted the area with the highest concentration of them.  

He hadn’t used sword intent or any unconventional methods, relying solely on his ninth-level Qi Refinement cultivation and the seal’s power.  

With any other super-grade magical tool, he would have been lucky to kill one or two late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators in a single strike.  

"Another group of cultivators is coming," warned one of the monitoring split spirits.  

Through the spirit’s shared vision, Li Shiming saw a group of cultivators approaching.  

After a quick assessment, he confirmed none exceeded mid-stage Foundation Establishment—let alone the dreaded Golden Core cultivators.
