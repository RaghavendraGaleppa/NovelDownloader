# Chapter 3: Five Top-Grade Spirit Stones! What Official Could Resist Such a Test!

Han Li, like other cultivators, walked slowly while examining the items on each vendor's stall one by one.

Along the way, Han Li carefully observed the roadside stalls. He discovered that Lin Yun hadn't deceived him—although there were many stalls, few actual transactions took place. Moreover, just as Lin Yun had said, most exchanges were barter trades. As for the so-called spirit stones, Han Li hadn't seen a single one yet.

Unlike Han Li, a complete novice to the cultivation world, Lin Yun had long lost interest in these things. His main purpose in proposing to accompany Han Li was to reap benefits from him. Right now, Han Li was new to the cultivation world, ignorant and naive—the perfect time to befriend him (or rather, the perfect time to take advantage).

If not now, then when? And the rewards from Han Li were simply too tempting—he had already obtained an immortal artifact. Who knew? Maybe he could get some spirit treasures or even Xuantian treasures next! The potential gains were staggering!

While Han Li was curiously browsing around, Lin Yun diverted his attention and thought, "System, open my personal panel."

(Note: Since this is the first appearance, later entries will be simplified. Unimportant people and artifacts will not be displayed.)

After glancing at his system panel, Lin Yun thought, "Might as well clean out my inventory during this Tai Nan gathering. Otherwise, these things will just collect dust."

Over the past decade, he had been actively making friends and forming connections to extract rewards from them. Although he hadn't obtained anything particularly valuable, the sheer quantity made up for it. 

"Quality may be lacking, but quantity compensates," he mused. By selling off the unusable items for spirit stones, he had accumulated quite a sum. After deducting expenses, he still had over 2,300 spirit stones left (though the system only displayed the rounded number).

His gaze lingered on the entries for his spiritual roots and physique, and he couldn't help but grimace.

Originally, he had been a True Spiritual Root cultivator with three elements. But when he received the newbie gift pack, he inexplicably obtained something called the "Pseudo-Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Body," which turned his spiritual roots into five elements!

He was aware of the Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light—one of the five mountains in Han Li's Primordial Unity Five Extremes Mountain was precisely this. Moreover, the Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light was reputed as the "Mother Qi of All Things." Not only could it accelerate cultivation, but it could also be fused into spells and divine abilities to enhance their power.

There had once been a Demon Realm overlord who possessed the Yin-Yang Great Five Elements True Light. This overlord was incredibly powerful and had nearly unified the Demon Realm at one point. The True Light Han Li obtained from the Demon Realm played a crucial role in allowing him to skip thousands of years of arduous cultivation, rapidly advancing from the Unity Stage to the peak of the Body Integration Stage and eventually reaching the Great Ascension Stage.

Yet, after twenty years, Lin Yun still hadn't figured out what use his "Pseudo" version had!

And if not for this damned True Body turning his spiritual roots into five elements, his cultivation speed wouldn't have been so agonizingly slow!

To think that after finally getting isekai'd, he'd end up losing so thoroughly!

"Damn it!"

"Ah, whatever. Just my luck," Lin Yun sighed, consoling himself with some AQ-style optimism. "At least I won't have to supplement my spiritual roots when advancing to the Void Refining Stage in the future. That's one less hassle."

"Thanks a lot, you stupid system!"

Han Li glanced at Lin Yun from the corner of his eye and, seeing that the latter didn't seem suspicious, relaxed slightly.

He then took the initiative to strike up a conversation to build rapport. "Brother Lin, are spirit stones really that rare? I haven't seen a single loose cultivator use them for trade this whole time."

Hearing Han Li's question, Lin Yun snapped out of his thoughts and nodded. "Spirit stones, as the name suggests, are stones imbued with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. The spiritual energy they contain is extremely nourishing for cultivators."

"If we can absorb spiritual energy from spirit stones while cultivating, it naturally doubles our results with half the effort."

"Additionally, the primary use of spirit stones lies in formations. Whether a formation can be successfully set up—and how much power it can unleash afterward—depends on the quantity and quality of spirit stones used."

"Another function of spirit stones is replenishing a cultivator's expended mana. This might even allow some cultivators to unleash spells beyond their current cultivation level—something impossible with their own spiritual power alone!"

"Who would've thought such a small stone could have so many uses? No wonder they're so scarce," Han Li said, enlightened. He then asked, "Brother Lin, do you know how spirit stones are classified by grade and type?"

"That's simple. Based on the amount of spiritual energy they contain, spirit stones are divided into four grades: low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, and top-grade."

"Furthermore, depending on the spiritual energy's attribute, spirit stones can also be categorized into metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—the five elemental types. There are also rare variants like wind, lightning, and blood spirit stones."

"Thank you for the explanation, Brother Lin," Han Li said gratefully.

"Don't mention it, Brother Han. These are just basic facts in the cultivation world. Once you've been a cultivator a bit longer, you'll naturally learn them. It's nothing special," Lin Yun waved it off.

At that moment, another notification sounded in his mind.

[Ding! Host has enlightened friend Han Li, triggering "Cast a Peach, Receive a Plum in Return."]

[Ding! Congratulations, host has obtained: Low-Grade Spirit Stones*5, Mid-Grade Spirit Stones*5, High-Grade Spirit Stones*5, Top-Grade Spirit Stones*5 (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth).]

"Huh?"

"Wait—"

"What?!"

"What are you doing?!"

"Trying to bribe me with spirit stones?!"

"Testing an official like this?!"

"What official could resist such a test?!"
