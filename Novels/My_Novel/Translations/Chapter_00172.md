# Chapter 172: The Silkworm’s Deception

Qiu Yue’s jealousy ran deep. More than ten days ago, after being scolded by the Madam, she realized her position was in peril and that Li Xian would eventually replace her.

Once that happened, her situation would be miserable, and no one would care about her. The sudden fall from grace was something she couldn't accept. In her anxiety, she thought of the considerable wealth she had amassed over the years. If she left the manor and settled elsewhere, she could still live a comfortable life.

And so, the idea of escaping took root.

Having served the Madam for over a decade, Qiu Yue was privy to many of her secrets. She actually found an opportunity, taking advantage of the Madam's seclusion to leave silently without a sound. If she hadn't run into the Flower Cage Gate, she might have truly escaped to a distant place.

However, Qiu Yue had been confined to the manor, her perspective narrow. She only knew the Madam was formidable, but not the extent of her power. Isolated from the world and accustomed to a life of luxury, she had gradually forgotten the dangers of the outside world. Her martial prowess was mediocre, and her temperament was nothing special.

This act of hers seemed like a bold gamble, but in reality, it was a dead end. Even if she hadn't encountered the Flower Cage Gate, there would have been other obstacles. And if the Madam wanted revenge, no matter how far she fled, she was doomed to die. She was simply too foolish to realize this, taking one wrong step after another.

Her luck was also terrible, as she was captured by the Flower Cage Gate precisely at that moment.

Li Xian took Qiu Yue to a secluded spot, ensuring no one was around. He frowned, fixing his gaze on her. "You ran away on your own?"

"Yes." Realizing she had been exposed, Qiu Yue admitted dejectedly.

Li Xian asked, "With your level of martial arts, how could you dare to escape? What secrets do you know?"

Qiu Yue said vaguely, "If I tell you, will you let me go?" Li Xian fell silent. If Qiu Yue had betrayed the Madam, she was already a dead woman. Even if Li Xian didn't make a move, someone else would. Qiu Yue couldn't see the bigger picture; her womanly perspective was incredibly foolish, making her believe she still had a chance to live.

Li Xian thought of how she had served the Madam for many years, appearing respected but actually pitiable. His own situation was similar. Though he despised Qiu Yue, he felt a moment of pity and said, "I can let you die a painless death."

"You... you're so ruthless!" Qiu Yue trembled all over. "Are you really... really... unwilling to let me go?"

"It's you who is too foolish!"

Li Xian said, "I would actually be happy to see you escape successfully. But... could you really escape the Madam's pursuit? If I let you go, you would be in the Madam's hands within three days. How could you die a painless death then? The Madam's methods... I have witnessed them. Letting you die a painless death is my mercy."

Qiu Yue's legs went weak, and she collapsed to her knees on the ground. Filled with regret, the heat of her impulsive moment had faded, and she now felt as if she were in an ice cave.

Knowing she couldn't survive, she went mad for a moment. Afterwards, she looked at Li Xian, recalling his words, and her eyes flickered with a strange light.

"Alright, I will tell you the secret. I beg you to give me a painless death," Qiu Yue said. "The reason I dared to escape at this moment is entirely because... right now, the Madam is completely immobile."

"Immobile?" Li Xian thought of the initial state of the "Jadeite Green Palm."

Qiu Yue said, "Hmph, you pretty boy, after I die, it will surely be you who takes my place, helping the Madam cultivate the 'Silkworm Silk Deceit Jade Art'."

"It doesn't matter if I tell you. That Silkworm Silk Deceit Jade Art is a martial art that surpasses even supreme martial arts. It's a strange and powerful technique, but its method of cultivation is extremely peculiar."

"It doesn't require tempering the hands and feet, nor does it require practicing forms. It is cultivated entirely through 'internal training'. However, without external aid, this art will not progress but rather regress."

"It truly is a strange art," Li Xian muttered to himself. Like a silkworm spinning silk, locking the body to practice internally, this art could progress. The Jadeite Green Palm was named after "River," but its method of circulating Qi could be traced back to the "Silkworm Silk Deceit Jade Art." It condensed Qi into threads, coiling and interlocking.

Qiu Yue continued, "The Madam obtained this strange art, and I assisted her in its cultivation. Using a special silkworm rope, I bound her entire body. Her body became like a silkworm cocoon, practicing internally to refine her martial arts. But the deeper one cultivates this art, the more difficult it becomes. When the Madam was practicing the first layer, she could easily break free. Later, as her realm deepened, it became increasingly difficult to escape, and her movements were not as free. Although she deliberately hid it, after being with her for so long, I had my suspicions."

"It's just like the silkworm. When it first spins its silk, the cocoon isn't tightly entangled, and it can give up at any time. But... as it continues to spin and wrap the cocoon, it becomes tighter and denser, eventually trapping itself in its own cocoon. It becomes impossible to break free."

"She is in a dilemma. If she gives up on her cultivation, her progress will surely decline, and it will be difficult to maintain. If she continues to cultivate, the cocoon will bind her entire body."

At this point, Qiu Yue said with envy and hatred, "If it weren't for you, I could have been carefree in the manor because of this special role. But recently, you... you were able to bathe with the Madam. The Madam and you no longer mind physical contact. The next step... it must be you... Thinking of this, how could I not flee?"

"Do you really think that once I am useless, I will just be ignored? The Madam will cut out my tongue, cripple my feet, and leave me in the manor!"

Qiu Yue shrieked hysterically, "I am not betraying the Madam; I was forced to. You are the one who is driving me to my death!"

Qiu Yue said in despair, "My fate is sealed. Li Xian, what I am today will be you tomorrow. Since you know this secret, you will one day repeat my mistakes."

Li Xian said, "What you say makes sense. Although you hate me for driving you to your death, I am no longer angry with you. I am not letting you go today only because I am afraid that after the Madam captures you, you will bite me back. Otherwise... I would really like to see if you could truly escape."

"No need," Qiu Yue said. "I have figured it out. I cannot escape. I forgot the Madam's abilities and foolishly tried to escape while she was in seclusion. Just give me a painless death."

Li Xian said, "Alright. This is a poison that kills on contact with blood. I will use my Qi to accelerate it. Relax your mind. You will be dead in three breaths."

Qiu Yue nodded and accepted her fate obediently. As the poison entered her body, her eyelids grew heavy, and she died just like that. Li Xian let out a long sigh, filled with emotion. Since entering the manor, Pang Long had disappeared, and Qiu Yue had died...

The One-Combined Manor had already changed dramatically.

"Qiu Yue's death cannot be entirely blamed on her foolishness. One thing she said was not wrong. What she is today, I might be tomorrow. If I do not wish to repeat her mistakes, then... I must do my best to increase my strength and look for opportunities."

"But Qiu Yue hated me to the core. How much of this conversation was true and how much was false, I must carefully consider. I cannot believe it all."

"Her corpse must be disposed of properly," Li Xian thought.

***

The Abandoned Mansion.

Yesterday's intense battle resulted in the complete annihilation of the Flower Cage Gate's villains, but seven constables were injured. Purely in terms of martial arts, each of the Flower Cage Gate villains was more skilled than any single constable.

However, the Wushao Hall had the advantage of numbers, and the constables were equipped with armor. They worked in coordination and struck first, which led to their great victory.

The villains' heads were all severed. Lin Aoshan stood with her hands on her hips, a playful smile on her face. This was a great merit. She had just inherited her title, holding a high position but lacking real power and prestige.

Although the merit was small, it was still precious.

"Brother Li, many thanks for this!" Lin Aoshan said with a smile.

"To eliminate the wicked is my duty. It is also my obligation to cooperate with the Heaven's Patrol to wipe out the bandits' nest," Li Xian replied with a smile.

By now, dawn had broken.

The grass was stained with blood, and corpses were strewn everywhere. Li Xian knew there were many tigers in the mountains. If the corpses were not dealt with, they would benefit the beasts, making them fat and strong, which would eventually harm others.

So, he ordered them to dig a pit on the spot and bury the dozen or so corpses. Gu Shuntong's corpse, however, was burned to ashes. This man had already reached the "Food Essence" stage; burying his body would still attract demons.

After dealing with the scene, they crossed the wild mountains and headed towards Qingning County. The constables took off their armor, their clothes completely soaked with sweat. Luo Xia was in a fine mood; she was born this way, loving blades and blood. With a grand wave of her hand, she rewarded each constable with one tael of silver, igniting their fighting spirit.

She was generous, but it was Li Xian who paid the bill.

Lin, Luo, Zhao, and Wang, the four women, returned with them to the Wushao Hall. They drank water and ate flatbread. Their emotions gradually stabilized, and their messy hair was combed smooth.

Li Xian sent someone to notify the four great families to come and pick up the women.

The four women looked at each other, hesitating to speak. It seemed they were unwilling to go home, but they had no choice.

Lin Qingwan's eyes were red as she bowed and said, "Master Li, this young woman... this young woman does not wish to return home. I beg you to take me in. I know some embroidery. I can cook and sweep the floor. I just don't want to go home."

Li Xian asked, "Why?"

Lin Qingwan sobbed softly. Lin Aoshan said, "I know about this. For a noble family, interests come first. The Four Surnames of Qingning, while having some local influence, are small fry when compared to the families in the prefectural city."

"The family's resources are limited, so only the direct sons of the family can access the martial path, wash their fetal nature, and eat essence, hoping to transcend the mortal realm. These daughters, though beautiful as flowers, cannot decide their own fates. After experiencing the Flower Cage Gate incident, they will find it hard to stand in the family, and their future will not be easy."

"I see," Li Xian understood. "You seem to know this well."

"Of course," Lin Aoshan said. "I am the Little Ancestor Grandma of the Lin family. I know all the ins and outs. Many young talents in my family are famous in the prefectural city. But when they see me, they have to lower their heads and call me Grandma? If I want to lecture someone, even their father and grandfather have to listen carefully."

Hearing this, the other women couldn't help but feel envious. Li Xian said, "This is simple. How about this... I will personally escort you home with Sister Lin."

"At that time... I'll have to trouble you, this Lin family Ancestor Grandma, to say a few words. I will also add a few words to ensure the family doesn't dare to cause any trouble."

"Later, if you are truly unhappy, you can come find me. I have some shops and can arrange some positions for you. Or you can truly come to the Wushao Hall to boil water and cook. That's also possible. But this is hard work, and as you have been raised in luxury, I'm afraid it won't be easy to adapt."

The women were immensely grateful. Lin Qingwan's beautiful eyes were moved, yet also filled with sorrow. Lin Aoshan嗔道 (chided), "You really know how to use someone else's flowers to make an offering to the Buddha." But she agreed.

And so, the group visited each family one by one, personally escorting the women home. Very few people knew about the Flower Gate incident. With Li Xian and Lin Aoshan speaking on their behalf, the families were happy to let the matter rest.

When they arrived at the Wang family and returned the Wang Madam home, the concubine happened to be there. She stared at Li Xian and Lin Aoshan's figures and suddenly let out an "Ah," saying, "Female..."

Lin Aoshan stepped forward and covered her mouth. The Wang family head, Wang Shiping, asked in confusion, "Lord Xuanhou, what is this..."

Lin Aoshan said, "I feel an instant connection with this sister. You all may withdraw. I wish to have a private chat with her."

Wang Shiping was overjoyed and couldn't agree more. "Good, good, please chat. Ah Yue, treat our guest well."

The beautiful concubine was named Xiuyue, and she nodded blankly. After everyone had dispersed, Lin Aoshan let go of her mouth and explained the situation.

When Xiuyue learned that the culprits were actually these two, she was both ashamed and shocked. She glanced at Li Xian several times, her expression gradually becoming shy and joyful. Recalling that night, the taste of it seemed to have changed.

"Brother Li."

"I think you should just accept your reputation as the lecherous thief. From my perspective, it seems quite suitable for you."

Lin Aoshan said meaningfully.

"It's not impossible. In the future, when traveling the Jianghu, I could enjoy beautiful women while also getting money. The feeling of it... would be quite good," Li Xian said with a laugh.

"Pooh, pooh, pooh. Do you really want to be a lecherous thief?" Lin Aoshan said. "Be careful, or I'll have someone capture you to earn a merit."
