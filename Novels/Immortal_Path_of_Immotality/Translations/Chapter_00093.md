# Chapter 93: Blazing Skies

Zen Master Xingtai's face twisted into a ferocious expression, a far cry from his usual dignified and benevolent demeanor. Standing atop his golden wheel, he retrieved his golden needle cylinder while pulling out a silver foil from his storage bag.

The foil was densely inscribed with Sanskrit characters that burst into silver flames under the sunlight. Yet the foil itself remained untouched by the fire, its engraved Sanskrit characters floating in the surrounding void like musical notes.

Inside the flying vessel, Lin Fan stopped his taunts. He too sensed the unusual nature of this silver foil—it was likely Zen Master Xingtai's trump card. Immediately, he went on full alert, his expression grave as he stared at their pursuer.

Zen Master Xingtai made no further moves. Holding the silver foil, he began chanting scriptures in a voice no different from any ordinary monk's recitation—unremarkable at first. But after nearly an incense stick's worth of pursuit, the situation gradually changed.

His chanting grew faster and more fervent, rising from murmurs to impassioned, rhythmic intonations. Inside the vessel, both Lin Shan and Lin Fan began to feel a suffocating pressure in their chests, their moods turning irritable. An overwhelming urge to vent their frustrations built up within them.

"Huh? What's happening to me?"

Both sensed something was wrong but had no idea how to respond. As Zen Master Xingtai's chanting grew louder, their spiritual senses began to sting. Lin Shan's vision blurred, and his hands controlling the vessel became unsteady.

"Damn it! This is Buddhist mantra—it attacks the mind! Help me!"

Lin Fan seemed to want to say something to Lin Shan, but a sudden, needle-like pain in his head sent him to the ground, writhing and clutching his skull in agony.

Countless Sanskrit characters now flooded into the vessel from behind, swarming the cabin like a plague of beetles. Their buzzing seemed to carry demonic whispers. Lin Shan, still at the helm, had already activated a Mind-Calming Talisman, but it only slightly alleviated the pain. His mind remained in a daze, flickering between clarity and confusion.

Zen Master Xingtai's Buddhist mantra was extraordinary. Combined with the silver foil, its power was formidable—far surpassing the Soul-Startling Bell used by Princess Guo. Lin Shan's Mind-Calming Talisman, though crafted by a Foundation Establishment cultivator, was inscribed on low-grade paper. Under the relentless mantra assault, it began to burn at the edges, clearly unable to last even the time it took an incense stick to burn.

Zen Master Xingtai's plan was obvious: attack their souls until they lost consciousness, causing them to crash from the sky. Then, retrieving the ancient map from their corpses would be effortless.

Lin Fan, rolling in pain inside the cabin, seemed desperate to speak but couldn't utter a word. The chanting in their ears now felt like the buzzing of countless mosquitoes, pushing them to the brink of collapse.

"Fine! I'll trust you this once!"

Seeing the dire situation and recalling Lin Fan's earlier expressions, Lin Shan knew he must have an ace up his sleeve. Tearing off his half-burned Mind-Calming Talisman, he slapped it onto Lin Fan. Without the talisman's protection, Lin Shan's consciousness began to fade again, and the flying vessel wobbled precariously.

With the talisman's aid, Lin Fan regained some control. Gritting through the pain, he pulled out a red incense stick from his storage bag, lit it, and placed it in the cabin. The fragrant smoke brought a momentary coolness to their minds.

Next, he produced a fiery-red talisman, his face twisting in reluctance. "This is such a waste! This was the key to unlocking Flame True Person's cave—I never even got to explore it! Using it as a one-time spell against a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator is beyond wasteful! But life comes first..."

Glancing at the gray-robed monk still chanting over his silver foil, Lin Fan's eyes hardened with resolve. He activated the talisman and hurled it backward.

Instantly, the spiritual energy within a one-mile radius erupted into chaos. Both Lin Shan's vessel and Zen Master Xingtai's golden wheel lurched violently, their controls failing.

Zen Master Xingtai finally looked up from his silver foil, his pupils shrinking as he recognized the fiery talisman at the heart of the maelstrom.

Lin Shan, now regaining some clarity, saw the monk had stopped chanting. But the vessel's controls remained erratic. He turned to look behind them.

All fire-attributed spiritual energy in the vicinity surged toward the talisman, expelling other elements. Even a wisp of true fire seemed drawn from the sun itself. Countless fiery threads converged, swirling in mesmerizing patterns.

---

A wild grin spread across Lin Fan's face, reminiscent of his early days in the Lin Family of Qinghe County. Through some means, he remotely activated the talisman at the heart of the inferno.

"Fire spirits of heaven and earth, heed my command! Gather the true flames, scorch the skies—by the decree of the law!"

After this improvised chant, Lin Fan's hands wove a series of intricate seals—though he soon admitted, "I made those up too," before giving up the act entirely.

Outside, flames engulfed the sky. The flying vessel, now uncontrollable, bobbed helplessly in the sea of fire. The talisman had seized command of all spiritual energy in the area.

This was the power of a divine ability—to command the forces of nature, rendering human effort insignificant.

"Boom!"

The flames reached critical mass. A deafening explosion erupted, sending a visible ring of fire expanding outward. Lin Fan hastily activated the vessel's defensive barrier and his own Five-Elements Robe, which shimmered with water energy as he fed it spirit stones.

Still unsatisfied, he hurled out a barrage of defensive talismans—earth shields, golden barriers, wooden walls, water screens, ice mirrors, wind barriers, lightning nets...

Lin Shan watched in awe as Lin Fan's seemingly bottomless storage bag disgorged an endless stream of treasures. Layer upon layer of defenses stacked before them—only to shatter like paper as the fiery waves crashed through.

---

The deafening explosions lasted five breaths before fading. The scorching heat dissipated, leaving only the half-burned incense stick emitting a cooling aura. The Five-Elements Robe lost its glow and fell onto the deck.

The brothers stepped out of the cabin, gazing at the retreating flames across the kilometer-wide sky. A sense of insignificance washed over them—they had survived a catastrophe.

"Did that old monk Xingtai die?"
