# Chapter 237: Conclusion and Enlightenment

"Father, during the Immortal Ascension Banquet at the City Lord's Mansion, this child didn't know his identity then, so... so I inadvertently spoke disrespectfully and might have offended that esteemed senior."

"Now, if I go to listen to the sermon, I'm afraid it might—"

Inside the cultivation chamber.

Li Jie looked at his father, hesitating to speak.

Since learning the significance behind the words "Dao Sect True Disciple" from the Young City Lord last time, he had been filled with anticipation for this sermon.

A disciple of a legendary Celestial Immortal True Lord, one who lives long, observes, and reclines high above the clouds! How profound must the cultivation path they expound be?

However, the deeper his anticipation, the heavier the apprehension in Li Jie's heart became. The words he had exchanged with that individual at the Immortal Ascension Banquet still echoed in his ears from time to time, even keeping him awake at night.

Opposite him, Li Jiu pondered for a moment, then smiled faintly, patting his son's shoulder reassuringly.

"Jie'er, so much time has passed, and aren't you doing just fine? Although I don't know what exactly you said to that esteemed senior, I imagine it wasn't overly offensive, otherwise—"

He didn't continue speaking. Instead, he paused, then sighed meaningfully, "Jie'er, would you care if an ant on the roof cursed at you a few times? Go. What is that esteemed senior's status, and what is yours? Would he bother to stoop to your level? Don't think too highly of yourself!"

In front of the Lingxu Mountain Daoist Temple's main gate.

At this moment, tens of thousands of cultivators, densely packed together, had gathered. Their cultivation levels varied, but even the lowest among them had reached the Foundation Establishment realm.

With countless streams of spiritual energy intertwining, the immortal spiritual energy pervading the area became turbulent and chaotic. A restless aura quietly spread.

Without exception, all eyes were fixed with fervent anticipation on the majestic mountain gate, several hundred zhang high, in the distance. The expectation in their gazes seemed to condense into tangible light.

Not long after, *Boom, boom—*

Accompanied by a earth-shaking rumble, the gate of the Lingxu Mountain Daoist Temple slowly opened.

A figure, entirely forged from ice, suddenly appeared before everyone's eyes.

In an instant, an aura of extreme cold emanated from the figure. Wherever it passed, mountains, rivers, the pervading immortal spiritual energy, and even... everyone's vision, were frozen.

Silence!

The originally bustling mountain gate now became as still as death!

"By the Lord's decree, everyone may now enter the Daoist Temple. No one is to cause trouble without reason."

A detached voice suddenly resounded in every cultivator's ears. The boundless icy coldness within it caused those who heard it to involuntarily shiver.

After a moment of silence, the next moment:

"We understand, thank you for the warning, esteemed one!" everyone respectfully shouted in unison.

Not to mention that the Lingxu Mountain Daoist Temple represented a True Disciple from the immortal orthodoxy, the Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect, the mere fact of their obvious Dao Integration realm cultivation was enough to command respect and awe from these people.

After all, a Dao Integration realm existence was known as a True Immortal, an undisputed major figure no matter where they were.

***

Amidst the sea of people.

"Is this what the True Disciples' Daoist Temple looks like? It's much grander and more magnificent than our Yellow Sand Dharma Realm."

Upon entering the Daoist Temple, Qiu Han couldn't help but be stunned, then exclaimed in admiration.

As far as his eyes could see, immortal light soared, and spiritual energy shimmered. White jade bricks, immortal gold masonry, jade palaces radiating splendor, spirit cranes and rare birds singing immortal music – truly a blessed land of immortals.

"Haha, Junior Brother, you jest. How can our mere Yellow Sand Dharma Realm compare to a True Disciple's Daoist Temple?" the man beside him said with a chuckle. A deep sense of awe unconsciously flashed in his eyes as well.

"I heard that when the True Disciple first established this Daoist Temple, he directly commanded thousand-zhang ghost-gods to labor for him, carving mountains to build halls, and paving roads to construct bridges. That's how it achieved such a prosperous and magnificent scene in such a short time." the man explained.

"Thousand-zhang ghost-gods?" Qiu Han clicked his tongue, finding it hard to imagine such a grand scene.

Just then, "Junior Brother Qiu?" a certain voice rang out not far away.

Hearing this, Qiu Han couldn't help but turn his head. The moment he saw who it was, a hint of pleasant surprise and excitement unconsciously appeared in his eyes.

"Senior Brother You Yuanming?"

Time slowly passed.

Inside an expansive, boundless square within the Daoist Temple, which stretched as far as the eye could see, cultivators of all kinds were already seated.

Powerful Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits stood guard, maintaining order. Of course, this was mostly unnecessary, as no one would be foolish enough to cause trouble in a Dao Sect True Disciple's Daoist Temple.

However, Han Sheng still insisted on mobilizing all of his Dharma Idol realm clansmen. This was necessary to demonstrate the authority and prestige of the Daoist Temple!

***

At the very center of the square, a hundred-zhang Dao platform had appeared at some unknown time, with a purple-gold meditation cushion resting quietly upon it.

Roughly dozens of zhang from the Dao platform, thanks to their status as Dao Sect disciples, Qiu Han and You Yuanming, despite only being at the Golden Core realm, were still seated there, drawing countless gazes of either envy or jealousy.

"Senior Brother, I never imagined we would meet again here after our farewell in the Lower Realm," Qiu Han said with a smile.

"Indeed. If it weren't for this True Disciple's sermon, who knows how long it would be before we, senior and junior brothers, would meet again," You Yuanming nodded, his voice tinged with unconcealed joy. In the vast Qingxiao Xuanming Heaven, in the vast Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect, it was truly rare to encounter someone from one's hometown.

"By the way, Senior Brother," Qiu Han looked at You Yuanming, as if remembering something, "Junior Brother Nong Xingzhou seems to be in a Dharma Realm in the Southern Chan Immortal Continent. Have you had a chance to visit him?"

Hearing this, You Yuanming shook his head and sighed, "Alas, this place is too far from the Southern Chan Immortal Continent, so this Senior Brother is willing but unable. It's a pity; I've failed the Dean's expectations. Before I came to the Upper Realm, he repeatedly urged me to look after Junior Brother Nong Xingzhou if I had the chance."

"But it's difficult! The competition in the Upper Realm is so fierce!"

"Speaking of which, Senior Brother, as a Blessed Land disciple, do you have any news of Junior Brother Zhang Jing? Someone as monstrous as him shouldn't be unknown. Not to mention, a Dao Integration True Immortal personally guided him to cultivate in the Dao Sect back then." Qiu Han's eyes flickered as he continued to ask.

"Junior Brother Zhang—"

You Yuanming's words were cut short. He seemed to suddenly sense something, quickly raising his head and looking towards the high platform.

At the same time, the many cultivators seated in the white jade square, like You Yuanming, involuntarily looked towards the hundred-zhang Dao platform in the center.

In their line of sight, a streak of light flew out from the peak of a magnificent, ten-thousand-zhang towering divine mountain not far away. It instantly streaked across the sky and landed directly on the hundred-zhang Dao platform in the center of the square.

The light slowly dissipated, revealing a young figure enveloped in wisps of chaotic immortal light.

Under the gaze of tens of thousands of fervent eyes, this figure sat down as if no one else was present. Behind his head, a six-layered mystical auspicious cloud suddenly rose, six-colored immortal light continuously swirling, emitting profound and extraordinary Daoic principles and truths.

Simultaneously, layer upon layer of vast void immortal rings were suddenly propped up, their immortal light as brilliant as the great sun.

***

It was so bright that people couldn't look directly at it.

"I am Zhang Jing, a True Disciple of the Chimin Taihao Grotto-Heaven of the Dao Sect. According to Dao Sect custom, I shall now expound the Dao for all of you to complete the karma. All of you must listen quietly and not cause any trouble."

A gentle voice suddenly resounded in everyone's ears across the square.

As the words fell, *Boom—*

The sky over an area of one hundred thousand li suddenly changed color. The thick clouds turned black and white, churning with endless, icy killing intent.

Suddenly, a strange sense of great terror appeared in everyone's hearts.

"We thank the Upper Cultivator for his great benevolence! We wish the Upper Cultivator immortal blessings forever!" Everyone shuddered in unison, then said gratefully.

"Good! Now, let the sermon begin..."

***

As Zhang Jing began his sermon, beneath the Dao platform, whether they were Dao Sect disciples or rogue cultivators, Dharma Idol realm cultivators or Foundation Establishment realm cultivators, all wore expressions of enchantment.

Some even felt a faint loosening in their cultivation.

This was because everyone was surprised to find that the cultivation path expounded by this True Disciple of the Dao Sect, Zhang Jing, encompassed all principles such as Yin-Yang, Five Elements, the Universe, and the Four Symbols, and all of them were profoundly deep.

Practically everyone could find their own path of cultivation within his sermon.

"Is this... the terror of a Dao Sect True Disciple?"

Someone unconsciously looked up at the figure enveloped in the immortal light and auspicious cloud, a look of shock flashing in their eyes. What kind of terrifying monstrous existence was this?

He understood all the Great Daos, excelling in every one. In just a few words, he could fully describe the mysteries of various Daos, reaching straight to their fundamental core.

And at this moment, unlike the other cultivators who were immersed in the various profound cultivation principles expounded by Zhang Jing, Qiu Han and You Yuanming's expressions had long since frozen.

Who knew how much time had passed?

"Senior Brother You, this True Disciple is actually... Junior Brother Zhang Jing?" Qiu Han unconsciously swallowed, turning his head stiffly to stare straight at You Yuanming, asking in disbelief.

Meeting Junior Brother Qiu's gaze, You Yuanming nodded woodenly.

Clearly, compared to Qiu Han, who was seeing Zhang Jing for the first time in Qingxiao Xuanming Heaven, You Yuanming was not faring any better.

Even though he had witnessed the monstrous and abnormal aspects of this junior brother from the same Daoist Academy in the Proud Cloud Secret Realm in Dongzhen Huamiao Heaven, monstrosity was still merely talent.

However, to become a Dao Sect True Disciple—

You Yuanming's heart instantly felt a sense of unreality.

***

Time flowed by rapidly.

At a position very close to the Dao platform, Huang Jiulong, a Dharma Idol realm cultivator, opened his eyes, a flicker of unwillingness suddenly appearing on his face.

"The fusion of the original Dao intent, the Dao of Innate Primordial Taiyi—such a heavens-reaching Dao is right before my eyes, yet I cannot comprehend it at all! I hate it!" he roared in his heart.

His hands unconsciously clenched into tight fists.

But the next moment, his fists loosened powerlessly.

*Huu—*

Huang Jiulong sighed dejectedly, knowing that he was ultimately fated to be without such a Great Dao. But even if his heart was unwilling, what could he do?

"That's right, if I could easily comprehend it, I would probably have entered a Grotto-Heaven to cultivate long ago," Huang Jiulong said with a bitter smile, shaking his head. His gaze then swept over the other Dharma Idol realm cultivators seated around him. When he saw that every single one of them had a blank expression, he finally felt a little better.

A faint smile unconsciously curled at the corner of his lips.

Sure enough, it wasn't that he was useless, but that the Great Dao expounded by this True Disciple of the Chimin Taihao Grotto-Heaven was too profound.

At this moment, streaks of divine light quietly passed through the Daoist Temple gate, then appeared above the square, transforming into five figures enveloped in immeasurable, terrifying immortal light, standing quietly in a corner.

Leading them was Feng Wuyu. The remaining four figures were none other than the four registered True Disciples of the Chimin Taihao Grotto-Heaven.

After listening to the sermon for a moment, "Reversing all acquired Great Daos, returning to the origin of innate primordiality! What a terrifying Dao! Junior Brother Zhang Jing, he—"

A look of shock appeared on all four faces in unison. They then looked at Feng Wuyu at the very front, their gazes carrying a hint of inquiry.

"Indeed!" Feng Wuyu said without turning his head, "Junior Brother Zhang Jing follows the Way of World Derivation, and his talent in this Dao is extremely terrifying; even Master is full of praise."

Hearing these words, "*Hiss—*"

The four couldn't help but look at each other. At this moment, they suddenly understood, and that trace of dissatisfaction in their hearts instantly vanished.

No wonder Master accepted him as a formal personal disciple!

***

Time flew by like a shuttle.

One day, ten days, ... one month!

On the sermon platform, Zhang Jing's eyes were half-closed, divine light vaguely brewing within them. Words containing various profound cultivation principles continuously flowed from his mouth, resonating throughout the entire Daoist Temple.

The process of expounding the Dao was also a rare opportunity for Zhang Jing to organize his own cultivation. Countless new insights emerged in his heart.

As time passed, his comprehension of the Dao of Primeval Origin World Derivation became increasingly profound.

At a certain moment, divine light burst forth from Zhang Jing's eyes.

"Golden Core, the Dao of Divine Abilities! Engraving various divine ability imprints into the Golden Core until it forms a complete divine embryo, which then gives birth to a Dharma Idol—this is the Dharma Idol realm. A Dharma Idol is a Dao God. The God of my Dao, connecting with heaven and earth, integrating with principles, every move possesses the power to move mountains and fill seas."

"And my Dao, no matter how it changes, is nothing more than opening up the chaotic void with Innate Primordiality, deriving all realms with Taiyi, where myriad Daos and myriad spirits are born and perish without end; it is the beginning and the end, it is one, and it is myriad!"

"Ultimately, it cannot escape the word 'Creation' itself."

His heart suddenly became clear. The path he was to take in the future had become distinctly clear.

***

Another ten-plus days passed.

The sermon, which lasted for one and a half months, had finally concluded.

As the numerous cultivators departed, news of tens of thousands of cultivators achieving breakthroughs in comprehension during the sermon by the master of the Lingxu Mountain Daoist Temple also spread wildly in all directions.

For a time, this caused those cultivators who had not attended the sermon at Lingxu Mountain, either due to distance or because their affairs were too important, to stamp their feet and beat their chests in regret.

But that was a story for later.

Inside the Lingxu Daoist Temple, in the main hall of the principal peak.

Zhang Jing was seated in the host's chair, with the five Grotto-Heaven True Disciples, including Feng Wuyu, seated in order below him. Bing Liangliang led more than ten Ice Crystal Immortal Spirits, carefully standing guard beside them.

"Haha, this sermon truly surprised this Senior Brother. I didn't expect that even though Junior Brother's cultivation is only at the Golden Core realm, his comprehension of various Dao principles is not far from mine." One of the True Disciples complimented.

"Indeed, Junior Brother's spiritual land and Daoist Temple are truly extraordinary! It shows that Junior Brother must possess great fortune, otherwise, it would be impossible to find such a Daoist Temple," another quickly added.

Hearing this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but smile faintly, then humbly replied, "Senior Brothers praise me too much. Compared to you all, this Junior Brother still has a long way to go. As for this Daoist Temple, it was merely luck, nothing worth mentioning."

Unexpectedly, as soon as Zhang Jing spoke, Feng Wuyu's voice immediately followed.

"Haha, Junior Brother, your Lingxu Mountain Daoist Temple is indeed remarkable, even surpassing my Golden Rooster Mountain's Green God Palace by a few points. This cannot simply be explained by 'luck.'"

As they were talking, an Ice Crystal Immortal Spirit quickly walked in from outside, seeming to have something to report. Seeing this, Bing Liangliang hurriedly went to meet it.

Three to five breaths later, "My Lord, there are people outside claiming to be from Taiyi Pavilion, Dongming Blessed Land, and several Dharma Realms of the Dao Sect, wishing to pay you a visit." Bing Liangliang whispered into Zhang Jing's ear.
