# Chapter 243: The Beauty Bows to Serve Wine

Early February saw heroes gathering at the Crossing River Gathering. By late April, the Crimson List was scattered in flight a thousand miles away.

Su Qiuwu and the others, having heard a clue about Li Xian, arrived at Peace Village two days later.

Surrounding the earthen hut, Li Quan cursed, "Damn it! We’ve exhausted ourselves searching without a trace. We thought he was some immortal who vanished into thin air. Who knew he’d be holed up here comfortably with a beauty, even tending to flowers and plants? It drives me mad!"

Zhao Zhiyuan said coldly, "A lone man and a woman sharing a room, lovebirds enjoying themselves... tsk, tsk, tsk, truly enviable."

Su Qiuwu suddenly realized, "What a cunning brat! I wondered why he vanished without a trace no matter how we searched. It turns out he settled down in a fixed location. We searched further and further away, thinking he had fled far into the distance. We were anxious and helpless, never imagining we’d find them in such a remote village!"

Zhao Zhiyuan said, "If not for Brother Su’s brilliant, wicked plan, it would have been difficult to deal with this kid." Su Qiuwu replied, "It also required Brother Zhao’s full assistance." The two exchanged glances, hiding sharp intent beneath their words. The plan was effective but utterly dishonorable. Both wanted to wash their hands of the blame, yet their words prodded at one another.

A moment of silence followed.

Li Quan kicked the wooden door open and smashed the flowers and plants in the courtyard.

Suddenly, Li Quan cried out in terror, "Quick... come look! She... she..." He pointed at the yellow mud wall, trembling all over, his legs shaking.

Eight characters were glaringly written: *Dog lives spared for now, will be taken later.*

Li Quan and Zhao Zhiyuan’s faces turned ashen in an instant. Su Qiuwu’s eyes filled with bloodshot veins, his eyelids quivering, his nostrils flaring... for a moment, he was lost in helpless despair.

"Wait..." Su Qiuwu said, "Wait... look at this sword mark. It’s very light. Wen Caishang probably hasn't fully recovered. And if she had fully recovered, she wouldn't have left. With her temperament, she would have waited for us to come knocking!"

Li Quan said, "Heh, Su Qiuwu... even if that woman hasn't fully recovered, killing you and me would be as easy as turning her hand." Su Qiuwu snapped, "You dog! You boost the enemy’s momentum and crush your own morale. If this were a war, I’d have your dog head!"

"Hahaha!"

Suddenly, a loud laugh was heard.

A clear voice said, "The Seven-Heart Sword Mind of the Sword Rain Pavilion, Su Qiuwu, and the Mundane Celestial Dog of the Taixin Sect, Li Quan. What fierce argument is this, exposing each other's flaws? Interesting, interesting. Care to tell me about it?"

The Sword-Seeking Alliance consisted of five major sects: Yellow Sand, Taixin, Sword Rain, Shiluo, and Wujidao... Although they formed an alliance, the sects were far apart and usually had no contact, so they rarely met.

At the village entrance, the背刀客 (sword-carrying guests) of the Wujidao Sect approached. The leader was young in appearance, short but very burly.

His name was Qi Beidao.

Suddenly, the ground trembled. Everyone looked sideways to see water splashing in the vast paddy fields, rice stalks falling... A row of people was hopping forward in unison. They jumped about half a zhang high with incredible speed, exuding a chilling yin energy wherever they went.

In no time, they had hopped to the front of the earthen hut. The arrivals were actually "zombies," about a dozen of them, cold and numb, gloomy and chilling. The zombies carried two coffins on their shoulders.

One of the coffins slowly opened, and a man crawled out, stretching lazily. "Splendid, splendid, everyone is here! Gentlemen, we meet again!"

This was Shen Pingping from Shiluo Village. The elite masters of the Sword-Seeking Alliance had all gathered here.

Su Qiuwu cupped his hands. "Brother Shen, Brother Qi, long time no see!" Xi Kairen, Qian Jinghao, Zhao Zhiyuan, Li Quan... all bowed in greeting.

Qi Beidao asked, "Brother Li, where are your three brothers? It is said that the Four Heroes of Taixin are of one mind and inseparable. Why are they not seen?"

Li Quan looked embarrassed. Su Qiuwu and Li Quan were at odds. Seeing that Wen Caishang seemed to have recovered, he hoped to use Li Quan, so he took the initiative to smooth things over and change the subject.

The group chatted for a while and entered the earthen hut together. Seeing the sword mark on the mud wall, Qi Beidao asked curiously, "Just a sword mark, without hidden sword energy,看不出 (can't see) any skill. Why are the two of you arguing over it?"

Li Quan said, "You haven't fought her, so you don't know..." Su Qiuwu interrupted, "Actually, we weren't arguing about the sword mark. It's just... sigh... I, Su, used to be arrogant and looked down on Brother Li. We had many conflicts, which led to resentment."

"I've now come to my senses and realized I was very wrong. Please forgive me, Brother Li. I... apologize here!"

Li Quan was very surprised. Seeing Su Qiuwu's sincere expression, it was rare for him to take the initiative to show weakness. He also saw that the masters of the Sword-Seeking Alliance were all present and needed to show his magnanimity, so he asked, "Are you sincere?"

Su Qiuwu nodded. "Absolutely sincere!"

Li Quan said, "Alright, let's put the past aside for now. Let's discuss how to capture Li Xian and Wen Caishang!"

Su Qiuwu's mind raced. He had suddenly apologized to use Li Quan as a tool, and secondly, to divert the topic. Li Quan was simple-minded and had almost blurted out how terrifying, powerful, and dangerous Wen Caishang was. If Qi Beidao and Shen Pingping knew, they would surely have second thoughts. If they found out that the Sword Rain Pavilion, Yellow Sand Sect, and Taixin Sect had suffered heavy losses without any gain, they would inevitably be intimidated and might even withdraw halfway.

Li Quan walked into the room. He saw a bedroom and a stove, both showing signs of life. There was a lingering scent of hair on the bed. He sniffed repeatedly, his eyes wandering. He was incredibly envious and jealous.

Why did Wen Caishang favor that小子 (brat) so much?

Meanwhile, on the Wei Hu River, the character "Tiger" in the name comes from a landscape: Tiger Jumping River.

Every April, tigers gather on the river bank and jump into the great river with a mighty spectacle. No one knows the reason why.

It was evening. Li Xian and Wen Caishang were walking on the road, nearing the river. They figured that once they crossed this area, the Sword-Seeking Alliance would have a hard time catching up.

Li Xian said, "My Lady, do you know? Behind the Wei Hu River, there is a Tiger Cry Ridge. It is a place of fierce evil spirits."

Wen Caishang chided playfully, "You've learned a little and want to show off to me? You..." She said softly, "Then tell me about it."

As they talked, a strange sound came from ahead. Faintly, there were roars of tigers, trumpeting of elephants, and shouts of people. Li Xian thought, "In an unfamiliar place, I should be more vigilant." He calmed his mind and listened, activating his "Hearing in All Directions" trait. He discerned that the strange sounds came from a nearby grove.

Li Xian whispered, "Let's look from a distance to see if there's anything strange." Wen Caishang nodded. Li Xian used his lightness skill, channeling his internal energy into Wen Caishang's body. They floated swiftly and lightly. Soon, they saw the source of the sound: two groups of beasts were fighting.

Tigers roared in the mountains, elephants shook the earth.

The tigers had thick claws and arms, the red elephants were huge and powerful. The tigers had formations, the elephants had shapes. The tigers pounced and clawed, the elephants swung their trunks and stomped... it was a grand sight.

Looking further into the distance.

Two groups of people were cheering them on. Li Xian thought, "This is rare." He focused his gaze.

The battle was thrilling. Li Xian didn't want to add trouble, so he gestured to leave. Wen Caishang nodded. They used their lightness skills to retreat.

Wen Caishang smiled. "It's my turn to test you. What are the origins of those two groups of people just now?" Li Xian said, "They must be from a sect."

Wen Caishang rolled her eyes. "Obviously. I'm asking which sect." Li Xian said, "The Evil Tiger Sect and the Great Elephant Sect?" Wen Caishang娇嗔ed (coquettishly scolded), "Nonsense."

Li Xian stopped jokinging and asked honestly. Wen Caishang said, "It's the Tiger Arak Sect and the Elephant Arak Sect." Li Xian suddenly tensed and hurriedly asked, ", "My Lady, you didn't pick a fight with them, did you?"

Wen Caishang said, "Naturally, I did. I killed the Tiger Arak Sect Master's wife and child. I wiped out the Elephant Arak Sect's beloved disciple..." Li Xian said, "If you are lying to me, I must punish you."

"You dare!" Wen Caishang realized she was weak, like a fish on a chopping block, and was truly helpless. She said softly, "You are audacious. Fine. I was just teasing you. I have only heard of the Tiger Arak and Elephant Arak Sects, never interacted with them. How could I have a feud?"

Li Xian said, "That's good." Wen Caishang said, "These two sects originated from the same sect. Later they split apart, and tigers and elephants have been fighting endlessly. I didn't expect them to be located here."

Li Xian said, "Whatever sect it is, we are just passing through. Once we board a boat and leave, it has nothing to do with us."

They quickened their pace and entered the city at night. The city was named White Tiger City. The city head was carved with a white jade tiger statue, baring its teeth and claws, exquisite and majestic.

As soon as they entered the city.

Waves of noise hit them. The city seemed to be celebrating a festival. Red lanterns were bright, and colorful scenery was continuous. Local customs and folklore offered a unique experience. Seeing that they had escaped their predicament, Li Xian's idle heart suddenly stirred. He asked a local, "Old man, what festival is today?"

The old man said, "A stranger? Today is the Tiger God Festival. We pray for peace, offer sacrifices to our ancestors, and appease the Tiger God."

Li Xian asked a few more questions. He only knew it was an ancient festival. He asked Wen Caishang, "My Lady, do you think there is really a Tiger God?"

Wen Caishang pondered for a moment and said, "Not necessarily!" Li Xian marveled at the vastness of this world. Walking down the street, he suddenly heard a commotion... a group of people pushing wooden carts carrying tigers that had been gutted and opened.

Local residents came out to pay respects. They offered incense, which was quite strange. Li Xian heard that further away, there seemed to be a grand ritual where crowds were gathering.

Although he was curious, he ultimately sought safety. He found an inn to stay in nearby. Li Xian calculated his remaining money; after paying for the boat fare, he still had a little silver left.

He asked, "Do you have anything good to eat here?"

The waiter said, "Yes, tiger whip, tiger kidney, tiger bones, tiger meat... all rare delicacies." Li Xian said, "Oh? Don't lie to me. I've eaten many tiger beasts. Whether the taste is fresh or beautiful is hard to say, but the meat is tough and hard to chew."

"Hey, customer," the waiter said. "How can tigers from other places compare to ours? Do you know of Tiger Cry Ridge?"

Li Xian said, "I've heard of it. Is the tiger meat there delicious?" The waiter said, "Not exactly. It's just... Tiger Cry Ridge connects to an endless mountain range. It's a place of fierce evil spirits, full of strange fruits and herbs. The tigers of Tiger Cry Ridge eat these fruits to grow. When they reach a certain age, they jump into the river."

"The drowned tigers naturally become food. The Tiger Arak Sect skins and sells them, and the meat is sold to to us. If they are lucky enough not to drown, they become厉害 (formidable)."

"It's like a python becoming a dragon after a water walk. A tiger that crosses the river is a 'River-Crossing Tiger'! The Tiger Arak Sect treasures them greatly. Ha... saying so much is just to tell you, customer, that our tiger meat is fed on heavenly treasures and spiritual herbs, so the meat is sweet and tender. Hehe."

Li Xian thought, "Endless mountain range? I really did inquire about it. The Fuhua Merchant Group often travels this water route, but they have encountered bizarre things. Several merchant teams entered the mountains to explore the path and disappeared forever."

Li Xian said, "Alright then, send the wine and dishes to the room." He smiled at Wen Caishang. "My Lady, let's go upstairs."

The room was simple but had a bed and table. The waiter brought the dishes one after another. First, two jars of "Tiger Cub Wine." The waiter had特意 (特意) made it very strong, hoping to help the lone man and woman open their hearts. Then came "Crispy Beans," "Soy Meat," and other common side dishes for drinking.

"Customer, hot Tiger Meatballs. Enjoy them while they are hot." The waiter brought a porcelain plate. The lid was lifted, and a fragrance drifted out. Two tiger meatballs were covered in sauce.

Once all the dishes were served, the table was full of delicacies, and two jars of fine wine. No one disturbed them anymore. Wen Caishang was in a very good mood. She rolled up her sleeves and poured wine, the aroma of wine overflowing.

She filled the cup to the brim. A hint of shyness flashed through her eyes as she handed it over with a thousand charms. "Didn't you ask me to serve you? Your girl is bringing wine. Are you satisfied?"

She was captivatingly beautiful.

Then, she leaned in and said, "Good Li Lang, please drink." When had she ever treated someone like this?

Li Xian was flattered and drank several cups. They drank and chatted happily until late at midnight. A beauty serving wine, incredibly joyful.

The Lady serving wine, it felt unreal. Their interest grew stronger and stronger...
