# 36, Little Divine Doctor

Li Zhiming and Han Li cried for a long time in the room, their voices completely hoarse. Looking at the relics their master had left behind, they each held onto the items given to them, at a loss. Han Li, especially, stared blankly at the family letter left to him.

With their master's death, their world in this valley had collapsed. Finally, the two could only stop sobbing. The two twelve-year-olds looked at each other, seeing the same bewilderment in each other's eyes.

When their master was alive, they could ask him anything they didn't understand. But now that he was gone... Looking at Mo Daren lying motionless and breathless on the bed, Li Zhiming was completely lost.

What were they supposed to do next?

Even the usually precocious Han Li was stunned, only managing to choke back sobs.

Faced with the constraints of the world, Li Zhiming and Han Li were completely inexperienced. Now that their master was gone, what should they do next? Burial? But according to what standards, what rituals?

Where should their master be buried? Could they bury him in the valley? Who should they ask to make a coffin? Surely they couldn't just wrap him in a straw mat? Should they hire people to play music and mourn? If so, where should they even find them?

Now that he had to take charge, Li Zhiming felt a whirlwind of thoughts in his head, unable to grasp any single important point.

These problems seemed small and trivial, but upon closer thought, there seemed to be answers to them all. However, for Li Zhiming and Han Li, they were left feeling somewhat helpless and at a loss.

Li Zhiming stood up, wiped away his tears with his sleeve, and composed himself. In that moment, he matured as if overnight.

"Han Li."

"You stay here and sort through Master's belongings. Until you have inventoried everything clearly and properly, do not allow anyone into this room, no matter who they are!"

Li Zhiming paused, carefully considering his words. Looking at the items on the ground, he carefully picked up the fragments of the 'Mafeisan' prescription their master had left him, folded them neatly, and tucked them into his chest.

Then, he noticed the book containing the evil techniques lying on the floor.

"Burn this!"

Li Zhiming stepped on the book and said calmly, "I will go and inform the head of the Seven Mysteries Sect."

Han Li had just nodded when they heard a commotion outside the valley. It seemed a large group of people had arrived. Li Zhiming listened intently, his expression becoming serious and solemn. "I'll go greet them."

With that, he strode towards the entrance.

Soon, dozens of stretchers were carried into the valley, carrying a strong stench of blood. Leading the group was a martial arts master in a red robe, gripping his saber, his face anxious. In their latest conflict with the Sea Shark Gang, they had suffered heavy casualties, with over a hundred brothers killed or wounded. If the 'Nether' Hall hadn't passed by and helped, almost all of them would have been lost!

Luckily, they had managed to rescue a large number of the wounded! So, without a word, they headed straight for Mo Daren's medicinal valley! If Mo Daren's intervention was even a little slower, who knew if half of them would have survived!

And so, Gao Changdong rushed into the valley for only a hundred steps when he saw a boy in a black robe approaching with a sorrowful expression. Li Zhiming bowed to him, but Gao Changdong had no time to pay attention to his expression. He waved his hand impatiently and said, "Where's Mo Daren? My brothers are dying!"

"Senior, my master has passed away," Li Zhiming said solemnly, standing at the entrance of the valley and bowing respectfully.

"What!?" The words were like a bolt from the blue. Gao Changdong staggered in place, then pushed past the boy impatiently and rushed into the house. Soon, he found Mo Daren, truly lifeless, his hair white, his face gray and frozen.

He was really dead!

Gao Changdong's expression was one of anguish. With Mo Daren's death, what would happen to his brothers!

He walked out of the house, lost and disoriented, unsure of what to do.

He never imagined that he would finally manage to bring his brothers back only for Mo Daren to pass away first!

As Gao Changdong was lost in thought, he heard one of the boys say in a very calm voice, "I can heal them."

Those three words caused both Gao Changdong and Han Li to look at him in disbelief. Li Zhiming raised his head, his expression devoid of joy or sorrow except for the lingering tears in the corners of his eyes. His demeanor, despite his young age, was remarkably similar to Mo Daren's!

It was as if he were a child version of Mo Daren.

Han Li was completely stunned.

This companion always had a side to him that he couldn't fathom.

Of course, Gao Changdong couldn't believe such an absurd thing. How old was this boy! Even if he was Mo Daren's disciple, how much skill could he possibly have? There was no way he could believe him! But the following events would force him to believe it. Especially since his brothers were barely clinging to life. With Mo Daren dead, regardless of whether this boy was boasting, what else could he do but treat this as a last resort?

Take them back and let them die?

It would be better to let this child stitch them up, maybe he could save one!

Even if it was just one! That would be good enough!

"Alright," Gao Changdong nodded, slightly irritated.

Li Zhiming ignored what Gao Changdong was thinking and turned back to the room, then asked Han Li to stay and watch the others.

Back in the room, Li Zhiming found the medicine chest that Mo Daren usually used to treat patients, packed some things, and then carried it out. Gao Changdong watched coldly from the side, wanting to see what this child could do. He had seen Mo Daren's medicine chest, of course.

Even if the boy was just mimicking his master, with the courage to try but without even half of his master's skill, Gao Changdong could only rely on him for now.

Touching the medicine chest, Li Zhiming took a deep breath, as if touching a medicine chest he had known for decades, and then opened it calmly.

Looking at the gauze, acupuncture needles, and various bottles and jars inside, Li Zhiming's eyes stung again, and he almost shed tears.

These were all Master's things!

Now that he was gone, these had become his relics, and it was up to him to inherit his legacy!

Outside the valley, more and more people arrived, including the wounded and several branch masters from the Seven Mysteries Sect's nine main branches. They peered into the valley, watching a child taking action.
