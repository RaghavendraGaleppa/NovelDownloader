Chapter 98: Viewing the Divine Fundamental Diagram, the Enraged Disciples of Thorne Jade Forest

"Who are you?"

"Picking... picking up trash."

"But I haven't left yet."

"Hammer King... doesn't seem... bad."

Jiang Chulong first poked at Liu Heng with a small branch, confirming that he was indeed dead like a lump of mud, and then let out a sigh of relief.

If he was dead, and no one wanted his belongings, they would be considered trash.

She could pick them up.

Jiang Chulong timidly raised her head, her small eyes filled with hope.

"... Go ahead and pick them up."

Li Mo's lips twitched as he asked, "Aren't you afraid of me? Don't you fear encountering other bad people?"

"I've... encountered them before..."

"Bad people... I just use this... to hit them."

Jiang Chulong shook the branch in her hand and used it to pick out the items from Liu Heng's embrace, one by one. She seemed quite excited.

After all, she didn't usually come across so many things to pick up; usually, she could only gather a few unwanted fragments.

Li Mo fell silent.

So, this was how she practiced her swordsmanship while picking up trash.

It was a wonder she hadn't gotten into trouble until now.

Wait a minute...

It wasn't just good luck, was it?

After a moment of contemplation, he spoke in a deep voice, "You shouldn't come out to pick things up for a while; the city is not at peace."

"But if I don't pick things up... I won't have... any money."

"What do you need money for?"

"To buy... fabric... to make clothes."

"Is this enough money now?"

Li Mo saw that she had retrieved a few torn silver notes from Liu Heng's body.

"Enough... enough."

Jiang Chulong nodded seriously.

"Then go home quickly."

After a pause, Li Mo added, "I won't give you this item."

With a surge of internal energy, he retrieved the statue that Jiang Chulong had just touched.

"Thank you... Hammer King..."

"I'm leaving now."

Jiang Chulong was delighted, even waving her small hand lightly twice before tiptoeing away.

Her slender back disappeared into the night, like a small piece of grass blown away by the wind, vanishing from sight in an instant.

"I should go see her too."

Li Mo thought to himself.

Tomorrow, perhaps?

He exited the alley.

Behind him, Liu Heng's corpse, with its internal organs smashed and lying like a muddy mess, silently caught fire and quickly turned into white ash.

He hadn't withstood the hammer, and it seemed he couldn't withstand the destructive internal energy either.

If he were still alive, he would probably feel regretful.

Upon returning to the hot pot restaurant, on the second floor...

[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Loyao' and saving their life.]

[Reward: Jade Sword Peach Blossom Branch.]

[Description of Jade Sword Peach Blossom Branch: A powerful swordsman once gained enlightenment by observing a peach blossom forest, and by folding a branch into a sword, it became a renowned weapon.]

In his palm, a jade-colored branch appeared, adorned with three peach blossoms, as if freshly plucked.

Upon infusing it with internal energy, strands of sharpness emerged.

This peach blossom branch wasn't forged by a blacksmith; it seemed to be a natural creation, likely an upper-grade renowned weapon.

"It suits Chulong quite well."

"I'll give it to her when she's about to break through the Internal Energy Realm."

Li Mo couldn't help but smile.

After putting away the Jade Sword Peach Blossom Branch, he retrieved another object from his bosom.

It was a terrifying ghost bat statue with a horrible face and four wings.

It possessed a certain divine aura, and upon gazing at it for too long, one felt their consciousness being drawn into it.

In a daze, it seemed as though the ghost bat came to life...

"This object is quite strange."

Li Mo focused his mind and calmed his energy before detaching himself from the trance-like state.

"This statue contains the Night Ghost Fundamental Diagram."

Just as he finished speaking, a cold voice came from the doorway.

Li Mo looked up.

There stood Ying Bing, dressed in night attire made of the same material, fitting closely to her body...

'A great craftsman could possibly craft a fishing net shape or more styles out of the black cloud yarn...'

Li Mo discreetly pinched his thigh.

"You recognize this object?"

"Yes, it's used to comprehend the Divine Observation Realm."

Ying Bing nodded slightly. "The so-called Divine Observation involves observing objects, living beings, and even the divine aura of heaven and earth to temper one's spirit."

"Over time, as the spirit connects with external substances, the玄丹 (Xuandan) can be broken through, marking entry into the Divine Observation Realm."

"When the spirit is strong enough to form an internal heaven and earth and project the inner scene onto the outside, one achieves the Internal Scene Realm."

The ice cube rarely spoke so much at once, but the information was substantial, covering the specifics from the Internal Energy Realm to the Divine Observation Realm and then to the Internal Scene Realm.

It sounded as though she had experienced it herself...

Li Mo recalled Liu Heng's attempt to cultivate, conjuring virtual yet real yin winds and ghostly shadows.

It seemed he was observing this 'Night Ghost Statue' to progress from the Internal Energy Xuandan Realm to the Divine Observation Realm.

If Li Mo hadn't undergone Shang Wu's special training, he would have likely defeated Liu Heng with brute force.

"You practice the Fire Lotus Method; you can first learn the 'Extreme Yang Fire Lotus Technique' from her, and then have her paint a South Ming Fire Lotus Diagram..."

Ying Bing's words trailed off as she furrowed her brows.

Shang Wu didn't seem like someone who would draw fundamental diagrams or engage in sculpture.

"If directly observing physical objects is better, why not?"

Li Mo asked.

"Of course." Ying Bing nodded.

Whether it was a statue or a painting, it ultimately couldn't replicate the divine aura perfectly.

After a moment of contemplation, Li Mo asked, "What about directly observing the sun?"

The sun hung in the sky; one could observe it at will.

Moreover, everyone under heaven could do so.

"It's not just about having an object."

"Firstly, you need the corresponding martial arts."

"Secondly, you must be able to withstand it. Under the heavens, apart from the royal family of Dayu, no one can observe the divine aura of the great sun; otherwise, before achieving it, their spirit would be destroyed."

Ying Bing was observing the Taiyin (Great Yin), which was the moon, at the Divine Observation Realm.

This was possible because her physique was extraordinary, allowing her to endure the cleansing power of the Taiyin.

Li Mo looked up, gazing out the window.

He wasn't practicing the Extreme Yang Fire Lotus Technique.

When the time was right and safety was guaranteed, he could try observing the divine aura of the great sun.

If that didn't work, he could observe the Hammer of the Pangu Ruins to enter the Divine Observation Realm through body tempering.

"I'm still at the Internal Energy Condensation Realm; there's no rush."

"Let's go see Chulong together tomorrow?"

"Alright."

The conversation ended, and the two fell into silence.

Li Mo sat down on the bed.

Ying Bing remained silent, merely pursing her lips.

The much-anticipated dual cultivation session was about to begin.

However...

Today was a test for Li Mo.

The ice cube hadn't changed her clothes.

It was common knowledge that, in cold conditions, male genitalia tended to shrink.

However, it was also known that Li Mo was resistant to both cold and heat, practicing yang-positive martial arts, making him less susceptible to the cold.

It was a challenge...

Meanwhile...

A certain girl, disguising herself as a young侠客 (chivalrous knight) and running away from home, slunk back to the government office.

"Big brother, I was bullied, and I almost died! Waaahhh!"

Her voice was extremely loud.

"What?!"

"Which scoundrel! I'll chop him into pieces and feed him to the dogs!"

"They're causing trouble, and it's landed on our Thorne Jade Forest!"

The true disciples of Thorne Jade Forest were enraged.
