# Chapter 63: Dou Changsheng, Why Did You Run?

The conflict ended abruptly.

A tall, burly middle-aged man appeared. His skin was rough and dark, his narrow eyes tinged with a sickly yellow hue that made people reluctant to look at him for long. But the most striking feature was his right arm—a metallic limb that gleamed with a cold, steely sheen. The mechanical arm was unusually thick, even bulkier than an average man's thigh, making his slender frame appear disproportionately thin and unsettling.

Jin Wuming stared coldly at the newcomer and said indifferently, "So it's the deputy sect master of the Mechanism Sect—Saint Fist, Leng Wuye! What honor do we have to be personally invited by a Pure Yang Grandmaster like you?"

Leng Wuye smiled and replied, "You, Jin Wuming, are the direct disciple of the Divine Blood Sect and ranked nineteenth on the Human Ranking. Mastering divine intent and breaking through to the Divine Transformation Realm is a foregone conclusion for you."

"And this Dou Changsheng—making his debut on the ranking at seventy-ninth place at just eighteen years old—is truly rare. Fire Cloud True Immortal once praised him as 'a single sword suppressing the martial world, the next decade belongs to Dou Changsheng.'"

"Sun Duxiu's reputation is even greater—seventh on the Beauty Ranking, excelling in both music and swordsmanship."

"As for the rest of you, whether from the Ten Elites or the Seven Heroes, you are all outstanding talents of the younger generation, the ones who will shape the fate of Great Jin in the future."

"My potential has been exhausted, and I have no hope of advancing further. I'm merely a few years older than you all. By the time you reach my age, your achievements will far surpass mine. I came personally to extend this invitation as a gesture of goodwill—nothing unusual about that."

Jin Wuming's eyes deepened like distant stars as he took a step forward and said, "The Mechanism Sect's 'World Within the Lake' is an artificial island you've spent years constructing. Since you've invited us today, let's see what it's made of."

Leng Wuye chuckled. "I promise you won't be disappointed." With a sweeping gesture, he declared, "After you!"

As soon as the word left his mouth, a massive shadow suddenly blotted out the sky, casting darkness over the group. Dou Changsheng instinctively looked up and saw a colossal divine bird spreading its wings as it descended. 

As it drew closer, it became clear that this was no living creature—it was a wooden bird, entirely crafted from timber, yet capable of flight. A true marvel.

Without waiting for the wooden bird to land, Leng Wuye took a step forward, ascending into the air as if stepping on invisible stairs, climbing effortlessly onto the wooden bird's back.

Jin Wuming snorted coldly. Crossing his arms, wisps of innate true energy surged around him like a whirlwind, lifting him into the air.

"Let's go together!" Dou Changsheng called out. Strands of innate true energy extended from the ground, weaving together horizontally and vertically until they formed a translucent sword about ten feet long and two feet wide—completely composed of pure innate true energy.

Dou Changsheng stepped onto it. Sun Duxiu's beautiful eyes widened in astonishment. *How vast must his innate true energy be to accomplish this? Even a hundred years' worth wouldn't suffice!*

Creating a ten-foot sword from energy was not the hard part—maintaining its form was. *The "Triple Origin Reversion Art" isn't known for its sheer volume. How did Dou Changsheng cultivate to this level?*

Stepping onto the pristine sword, Sun Duxiu braced herself for stray energy fluctuations—after all, maintaining such a construct was already a feat, and controlling every wisp of energy perfectly was nearly impossible. Yet, no such leakage occurred, showcasing Dou Changsheng's terrifyingly precise control over his innate true energy.

By the time Chen Weiquan and the others had all boarded, the sword lifted off, soaring into the sky.

Dou Changsheng did not step onto the wooden bird. Instead, he calmly said, "Lead the way, Senior."

Leng Wuye gave Dou Changsheng a deep, assessing look. *The younger generation truly surpasses the old. Jin Wuming's strength is beyond expectations, and this Dou Changsheng is no less impressive. Compared to the information we have on him, he's far stronger.*

*The sword energy that filled the skies during the battle at Qingyang Peak is nothing compared to this. Flying while carrying multiple people—even Divine Transformation Grandmasters would find this challenging, yet he's only at the Innate True Realm. How arrogant!*

Jin Wuming chuckled lazily, reclining mid-air as if supported by an invisible throne. Whirling winds gathered beneath him, forming a regal seat of air. Glancing at the wooden bird, his lips curled in mockery. *The Mechanism Sect underestimated me—and Dou Changsheng.*

Leng Wuye's eye twitched, but he pretended not to notice. With a flap of its wings, the wooden bird surged forward. The translucent sword tore through the air like a streak of light, following closely behind.

Jin Wuming's smile faded, replaced by a cold glint in his eyes. A trace of killing intent simmered within him. From his sleeve, he produced a pair of gloves woven from golden threads and slowly put them on. The material was impossibly soft yet impervious to water, fire, and blades.

Once the gloves were secured, his gaze returned to Leng Wuye. His eyes narrowed to slits—murderous intent erupting like a volcano.

But in the next instant, the killing aura vanished. The golden gloves turned translucent, fading from sight. Jin Wuming smirked, then abruptly turned and walked away—not toward the wooden bird, but in the opposite direction.

His movement immediately caught Leng Wuye's attention. 

With a frown, Leng Wuye leaped forward like a cannonball, tearing through the air with a thunderous boom. Shockwaves rippled outward as he closed the distance in an instant. "Jin Wuming, what are you doing?" his deep voice boomed.

Jin Wuming stopped and grinned. "My apologies. I got the wrong direction." 

The winds swirled around him as he turned back toward the wooden bird. Watching Leng Wuye's abrupt halt—his robes fluttering while his body remained perfectly still—Jin Wuming couldn't help but praise, "As expected of the deputy sect master of the Mechanism Sect. Your skills are the real deal, no exaggeration."

"But not long ago, you lost three consecutive matches to Mo Family's Black Talisman. He shattered your pride—the vaunted 'Saint Fist of Mechanisms.' Your strength has taken a heavy blow. What makes you think you can handle me?"

"Every one of the top ten on the Human Ranking has feats of slaying opponents above their realm. Today, you'll be the one to elevate my status!"

His words cut off abruptly as he suddenly shouted into the distance:

"Dou Changsheng, why are you running?! Get back here and help me fight!"

"You really think I can take on a Pure Yang Grandmaster alone?!"
