# Chapter 163: Landing

When the sword blade pierced through the back of the neck, it actually split into eight phantom images. Simultaneously, bloodlines bloomed at the necks of the other fifteen disciples.

"Gurgle..."

Yan Qi's cry of alarm was swallowed by the blood foam surging from his throat. As he stumbled backward, he saw the other five swords moving like living things. The sword at the Xu position suddenly swept across in a horizontal slash.

His vision immediately spun topsy-turvy.

As Yan Qi's head flew toward the Underworld River, the blade clearly reflected the fine scales appearing on Qi Huan's right cheek.

A muffled, ragged breathing continuously exhaled from Qi Huan's mouth. The fine scales appearing on his face gradually sank deeper into the skin of his cheeks as the blood energy calmed.

He raised his arm, watching the coarse scales on it also rapidly soften, contract, and quickly vanish into his flesh. His somewhat sharpened fingers slowly retracted, returning to normal.

A thread of black bloodline flashed in the corner of his eye, writhing like a living snake before quickly vanishing into the white of his eye.

After a long while, Qi Huan stood up. Looking at the sixteen elite disciples of the Hidden Edge Pavilion whom he had killed, he suddenly let out a laugh.

The laughter shook the underground Underworld River around him, causing it to rustle, yet it was still covered by the perennial strong winds of the Ghost Weeping Abyss.

The scattered searchlights illuminated the demonic skeleton. The丈-high (zhang-high) pitch-black framework had actually faded to a deathly white. Twelve pairs of ribs were covered in dark green verdigris, and the blood grooves on the surface of the spiral horn were coagulated with a substance resembling asphalt.

Most terrifying was the dark purple crystal nucleus floating within the skeleton's chest cavity. It was currently flickering in rhythm with Qi Huan's laughter, and with every flash, fine bone dust would rustle and fall.

Qi Huan brushed his hand over the dark tattoo on his chest. The moment his fingertips touched the demonic crystal nucleus, the entire skeleton collapsed with a rumble.

Amidst the splashing bone fragments, translucent, meridian-like blue-black substances actually swam into his seven orifices. Those weathered bones turned to ash the moment they hit the ground, yet they outlined a curse pattern on the ground that perfectly matched the scales on Qi Huan's face.

The玄铁 (Xuantie) iron vambrace on his left arm suddenly exploded into dust. Dark red veins bulged beneath Qi Huan's exposed skin.

His finger joints emitted a grating, explosive sound. Five fingernails instantly grew three inches long, transforming into curved bone blades. The ulna of his forearm pierced through the flesh and flesh, turning over to form barbed hooks. As the scales spread along the veins on the back of his hand, they actually emitted a clanging sound like chains being dragged.

"Boom!"

The moment the demonized claw slammed into the rock wall, the entire cliff face trembled.

Large chunks of rubble poured down from the shattered rock wall, completely burying the corpses of the sixteen disciples.

"The Ghost Weeping Abyss has been scouted and located. We can descend at any time."

Hearing the message sent back by Mo Shisan, a smile appeared on Hong Baichuan's face. He turned to Xiong Kun and said, "Brother Xiong, why don't we go out and see how this Heaven's Work Fortress sets its seat?"

"I certainly want to see!"

This mobile fortress of the Heaven's Work Cave had broadened his horizons, and he naturally wanted to see it.

He was not the only one. The martial world adventurers who had gathered to watch the excitement were also occupying many peaks, waiting for this behemoth, the Heaven's Work Fortress, to be positioned.

When the fortress completed its final turn, sixteen mountain-supporting pillars suddenly retracted into the armor. The entire fortress rumbled as it sank into a mountain body adjacent to the Ghost Weeping Abyss, leaving only a deep, regular, ten-zhang-wide circular hole on the cliff face.

Seeing this scene, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but let out a breath of relief.

He looked up at the group of Heaven's Work Cave disciples before him.

Finally, he wouldn't have to run around everywhere anymore. Next, he would have to cultivate his martial arts seriously and carefully nurture his Qi training.

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan's gaze paused, and he turned to look at a corner.

Seeing Xu Yunfan look over, a smile appeared on Qi Huan's face, and he nodded slightly.

Xu Yunfan also responded politely.

This true disciple and chief disciple of the Hidden Edge Pavilion had decent strength. If he were placed in the Xuanzhen Gate, although he wouldn't be able to become a true disciple because he hadn't yet stepped into the Outer Three Unions, his mastery of the fast sword was superb, and he was enough to be called the best among the inner disciples.

Moreover, from the looks of it, the other party seemed to have a cultivation method that was on the verge of reaching perfection.

Xu Yunfan guessed inwardly.

Three days later, Xu Yunfan stood atop a mountain peak, facing the first ray of purple energy rising with the morning sun.

He was barefoot and shirtless. With his ten toes gripping the ground and exerting force, the veins on the back of his feet coiled like old vines.

After breathing for a long time, Xu Yunfan made a shouting motion with his mouth and took a deep breath toward the first ray of light radiating from the rising sun. A wisp of purple, misty energy, faintly visible to the naked eye, flowed from his mouth and nose into his body.

'You practiced diligently every day, rain or shine, visualizing the image of pure yang from the purple energy, and absorbed a particle of Heaven and Earth Primordial Spirit. A warm current surged through your flesh and blood, like morning dew moistening your meridians. Every breath accumulated pure yang power. Your proficiency in Pure Yang One Qi Art increased slightly.'

'...'

Glancing at the information prompt that appeared in his field of vision, Xu Yunfan's heart skipped a beat.

It was a critical hit!

Just the proficiency that appeared from this single entry had at least increased his proficiency by three points.

He clearly felt the subcutaneous muscles and tendons trembling slightly. The moment that thread of silk-like purple energy entered his body, it transformed into a hundred or so fine, hair-thin warm currents, permeating along the muscle textures toward his entire body.

His shoulder blades suddenly emitted a sound like tearing silk. Two patches of scalding heat spread from the trapezius muscles toward his elbows.

Xu Yunfan was startled to find that the muscles and tendons of his arms had actually expanded threefold like dough rising. Stranded muscle bundles were clearly visible beneath his skin.

This strange phenomenon lasted for three breaths. As the heat dissipated, it returned to normal, leaving only a spider-web-like pale red pattern on the surface of his skin.

"This is..."

He tapped his left chest with his bent fingers. The intercostal muscles suddenly contracted in response, emitting a muffled sound like metal striking metal.

The phenomenon of golden skin seemed to have gone deeper.

That particle of Primordial Spirit energy had now dispersed into thousands of star-like sparks, wandering through the gaps between tendons and fascia.

Wherever each warm current passed, the subcutaneous fat would take on a fish-scale-like jade luster, as if it were cow's hoof gel being simmered over a gentle fire.

When the warmth reached the back of his neck, the Adam's apple cartilage actually protruded half an inch beneath the skin. Layers of fascia were growing in this spot, wrapping around this vital point.

For External Skill body training, if one wants to reach the end without any weak points, these vital areas are naturally the key points to forge.

However, to truly have an external skill body with no weak points, one must step into the Muscle Refining Realm, where the force derived from muscles, bones, and skin twists into a single strand, permeates the flesh and blood, and then focuses on strengthening based on the characteristics of the martial art.

At this step, one can be said to have completely broken away from the realm of ordinary people.

He clearly felt the warm current traveling along the spinal tendons. Wherever it passed, the intervertebral discs emitted a crisp sound like a new bamboo jointing.

The most marvelous change occurred in his palms. As the Pure Yang One Qi Art reached a certain level, the originally calloused palm edges were now as smooth and moist as a baby's. However, when he exerted force and slapped the mountain rock, spider-web-like dark green veins suddenly bulged from his palm lines.

Amidst the flying rubble, Xu Yunfan discovered that his finger bone joints could actually expand and shrink on their own. It was like the bone-shrinking skill of the foreign contortionists, yet it carried a completely different kind of fierce and vigorous aura.

Half an hour later, facing the sun that had already climbed high, Xu Yunfan exhaled a breath of air that was clearly visible to the naked eye, shooting three zhang straight out before finally dispersing.

In a few more days, the Pure Yang One Qi Art would reach minor completion.
