# Chapter 194: Hearty Laughter

The bamboo courtyard, a refined and elegant dwelling.

On the huanghuali wood table, a small teapot emitted a delicate fragrance. The purple-eyed crow found it just right; in its "hand," it held a warm teacup, barely an inch high, taking small sips.

On the table, there was a delicate small armchair. It lazily sat upon it and said, "Without Day Gold, and lacking secret texts, if it were me, I wouldn't enter the arena."

Ling Yu, hearing it mention Day Gold, suddenly felt something was amiss. The familiar weight in his pocket was gone; his dozens of Day Gold seemed to have vanished.

Then, he let out a muffled groan, his face darkening. "My gold notes... only one left!"

Master Wu took a small sip of tea and said, "This... is quite particular. A gentleman loves wealth, but acquires it righteously."

Tang Jin was tall and slender, not short even compared to Ling Yu, with straight and long legs. She took a few steps around the room, her movements light and graceful.

"I'll get in touch with him later," she thought. She was genuinely curious about the young man who had emerged from Black and White Mountain.

Even if it was a sneak attack, rendering Ling Yu unconscious so cleanly was not something an ordinary person could achieve.

At the same time, she was very dissatisfied with Ling Yu. If this were on a battlefield, in a life-or-death struggle within the Third Forbidden Land that was about to open, could he still survive?

Qin Ming smiled faintly, "Brother Chuan, look at this turf, green bamboo, and golden vine trees. We've paid for all damages according to the price and even paid the fine. Could you please quickly arrange for us to rest up?"

"Please just call me by my full name," Qian Chuan said. He always felt like the other person was calling him "Qian Chuanzi" (money string), which was truly unlucky.

But he couldn't just get angry. These two were "living ancestors," actually having beaten Xin Youdao and Ling Yu consecutively. If this got out, it would undoubtedly be a monumental event!

For a moment, he was even impulsive, wanting to sell this news, which was enough to shake Kunling City, for a good price!

But he held back again. Someone had already approached him and told him not to speak carelessly.

He felt it was better to restrain himself for now.

Now, he didn't dare show any displeasure to the two. He was very polite, with a smile on his face, because these two new students were truly a bit terrifying, possessing the ability to completely "overturn" all new students of this batch.

"The dead Dragon Carp hasn't been compensated for yet..." he reminded softly.

Little Wu said, "This should be Spirit Meat, right? If we eat it all in a bit, won't it be gone? Besides, Xin Youdao struck it dead with lightning, so you should go to him for compensation."

Qian Chuan nodded, then softly reminded, "If you absolutely must fish and eat, it's not impossible, just wait until no one is around."

Wu Yaozu smiled, "Alright, I'll invite you to eat grilled fish another day. Or, you can take two now if you want."

"I wouldn't dare eat that!" Qian Chuan quickly left.

"Comfortable! Dragon Carp with wine, happiness always mine!" Qin Ming leaned back in a lakeside lounge chair, a wine cup in one hand and a grilled Dragon Carp in the other.

Little Wu had already repaired the grill and found over a dozen jars of fine wine in Xin Youdao's storage room. The two enjoyed their spirit meat dinner by the lake with the wine.

The next day, the two proactively paid their tuition fees, and all their documents, such as student ID cards and library borrowing cards, were processed. After that, they directly headed to their destination.

Why did Qin Ming enter the Mountain River Academy? To borrow books and read!

The environment in this area was excellent, with rare tree species everywhere. Fragrant orchid trees diffused their scent, and silver maple trees shed a sky full of silver petals.

The nine-story Scripture Repository rose majestically, incredibly grand, situated beside a lake formed by a fire spring. The vegetation was lush, and experts guarded it.

"What kind of joke is this? You open your mouth and demand a list of miraculous arts? You new students are always so ambitious, building castles in the air, not knowing your own talents or whether you can comprehend them, or if you even have contribution points?!" a still-charming middle-aged woman scolded Little Wu.

Wu Yaozu felt wronged, thinking to himself, "I'm just borrowing a book, that's all. If it works, fine; if not, so be it. Why scold me?!"

Qin Ming spoke up, "We understand the rules. We'll pay for the reading."

"This way!" The middle-aged woman led the way, taking them to a very quiet area.

Little Wu followed behind her, unable to resist making a 'Dragon Claw Hand' gesture. He was still just a boy at heart.

The beautiful middle-aged woman didn't even turn her head, saying, "My daughter is already at the peak of the Second Realm, and you still dare to be mischievous with me?"

Wu Yaozu quickly lowered his head and said, "Senior, I was wrong."

This was a large quiet room, with sunstones in crystal lamps, making the lighting ample and very suitable for reading. However, there weren't many people here.

"Insanely expensive!" Qin Ming took a deep breath. He found a book that new students borrowed most frequently. It was very thin, only thirteen pages, requiring thirteen Day Gold—one Day Gold per page.

In Scarlet Cloud City, three Day Gold could barely cover a family of three's basic needs for a year. In Kunling City, where prices were soaring, it required twelve.

Before opening the thin booklet, he had to perform a certain ritual, swearing not to disclose its contents.

Afterwards, Qin Ming diligently began to read, slowly turning the pages. Each page was worth a month's rations!

On this book, he felt intense emotions, all left by other new students. He blocked them out, not needing their insights.

Moreover, those were almost all "resentments," complaining that the book was too expensive. However, some also lamented that it was the most cost-effective book, actually quite cheap.

After reading, Qin Ming pondered carefully. This was the crystallization of a senior expert's painstaking efforts, outlining various precautions for the First Realm of the Novice Path.

He reflected on himself and found he didn't have such problems.

Objectively speaking, this book was of immense value to many new students.

Qin Ming pondered silently. The visionary "outlook" on the last page of this book, as well as certain unverified "speculations," made him somewhat lost in thought.

The Ninth Rebirth, which only Anomalous Ones could achieve, was something many lineages and famous figures were quite "superstitious" about.

In this domain, they were willing to choose miraculous arts like the "Immortal Butterfly Scripture," which portended immortality and regeneration.

This made Qin Ming contemplate. The old senior who authored the book was also quite "superstitious," similarly believing in this beautiful "aspiration," claiming it had a significant promoting effect on the final rebirth.

Moreover, this old senior gave examples of how many great figures in history had chosen this path, achieving significant breakthroughs during their Ninth Rebirth.

"The contemporary Buddha chose the 'Golden Cicada Scripture.' The golden cicada emerges from its shell, tearing its old body, undergoing trials and rebirth, imbued with profound Zen meaning."

"Qingtian, for his Ninth Rebirth, cultivated the 'Dragon Snake Scripture.' From snake to dragon, it was bloody, his physical body shattered, rising from despair and embracing death to be reborn, with fierce and potent power."

***

Qin Ming read it again. The old senior mentioned that past sages chose this path hoping the Ninth Rebirth's transformation would be fierce enough to expand into a non-existent Tenth Rebirth.

Of course, everyone failed.

Furthermore, past patriarchs had already verified that the Tenth Rebirth was a false goal; even if it existed, it was encompassed within the Ninth.

This was because the achievements of Anomalous Ones with different foundations varied greatly in their final Ninth Rebirth.

"In other words, the Ninth Rebirth encompasses everything. If a person's talent is terrifying enough and their foundation surpasses that of the patriarchs, the reward from their final rebirth will also be incredibly astonishing."

Qin Ming closed the book. After pondering for a while, he decided to borrow related miraculous arts.

He noticed that Little Wu was studying the "Flesh and Soul Locking Art." It seemed he was indeed studying with a specific purpose, perfecting his path of transformation into a rainbow.

He went to consult the beautiful middle-aged woman, asking if there were scriptures like the "Immortal Butterfly Scripture" and the "Dragon Snake Scripture."

At this moment, Zhao Minghui looked at him differently. Was the young man before her an Anomalous One, or did he want to lay the foundation for the First Realm using miraculous arts?

Qin Ming fully circulated the "Harmony with the World" which Lu Zizai had augmented. Apart from Master Wu, who could discern his abnormality with his mysterious purple eyes, others found it difficult to see through him.

Zhao Minghui said, "The miraculous arts you mentioned are all available in Kunling City. Furthermore, our Mountain River Academy has no less than two copies of each, but... they are very expensive."

Qin Ming was surprised. It wasn't rare for Mountain River Academy to have some miraculous arts, but to have two copies in the same field indicated a truly profound foundation.

He said, "I'd like to take a look."

Zhao Minghui informed him that only one copy, the "Golden Cicada Scripture," was available for public borrowing.

Qin Ming's eyes blazed. Xiang Yiwu, the abandoned disciple of Buddha he met in Mount Luofu Immortal Mountain, was developing a new method, and it seemed he was cultivating the "Golden Cicada Scripture" as its foundation to build the subsequent path and techniques.

However, when he saw the price, he almost bit his tongue. One chapter alone cost two hundred Day Gold. How many chapters did a miraculous art have? The final price would be astronomical!

At the very least, he had already seen dozens of chapters here, not counting the parts that were currently borrowed out.

"Miraculous arts are priceless!" Zhao Minghui stated.

"Indeed, it's a priceless book," Qin Ming deeply felt. Scriptures were power, they were Day Gold. He realized he was too poor.

Zhao Minghui smiled and reminded him, "Actually, miraculous arts aren't learned this way. Who would spend so much Day Gold just to read them? Go find the relevant teachers; if they take a liking to you, they might teach you for free."

"Huh?" Qin Ming was pleasantly surprised by this unexpected turn of events and immediately expressed his gratitude to her.

Zhao Minghui seemed to recall something and frowned, "However, with the passing of some seniors, that old man who is most proficient in the 'Golden Cicada Scripture' has completely become a money-grubber. To support his descendant who has entered the Yang Earth and wishes to compete for the Immortal Seed, his intentions are no longer pure. Although there are others who have also cultivated this scripture, none have researched it as thoroughly as he has."

"Are others far behind him in comparison?" Qin Ming asked. In truth, he didn't care; as long as he had the scripture, he could cultivate it himself, without needing anyone to teach him.

Zhao Minghui said, "Yes, there is indeed a gap. Because Wu Chengwang not only mastered the original Golden Cicada Scripture, but in his youth, he also explored a great tomb and unearthed a mutated version of it. By combining the two, he researched many new things."

Qin Ming carefully asked, "This... if I go to Senior Wu, do you think he will charge me?"

Zhao Minghui sighed, "He certainly will. For his descendant to approach immortality, he no longer cares about his reputation."

After Qin Ming and Wu Yaozu left the Scripture Repository, they inquired about Wu Chengwang's residence.

"Brother, I'm not criticizing you, but while the 'Golden Cicada Scripture' is marvelous, capable of extending life and finding life in death, if you go to learn from Wu the Skinflint, he won't just drain your blood dry, you won't even learn half the scripture—it's sky-high!"

Someone kindly advised him not to willingly go bankrupt there.

This was because even wealthy young masters would feel intimidated by Wu Chengwang, feeling that their Day Gold wouldn't be enough.

Wu Yaozu said, "Brother, I also think it's not wise to deal with such a rotten old man."

"It's fine, I can handle his tricks!" Qin Ming, carrying six hundred Day Gold, once again walked towards that small courtyard filled with fragrant flowers and birdsong.

Wu Chengwang became even more amiable. He took out a rather worn book and said, "This has my annotations. This scripture is priceless, because apart from the Buddha lineage, few understand both versions of the 'Golden Cicada Scripture'."

Qin Ming complimented him, saying that his lifelong research into this scripture was equivalent to expanding the methods for the novice domain, truly a person of great virtue.

"This old man also thinks so," Wu Chengwang nodded with a smile.

Qin Ming opened the first page. In fact, he could only open a few pages this time, but he was smiling, extremely satisfied, his smile growing brighter with each glance.

"Hehe..." Wu Chengwang was also smiling, feeling that this little lamb was very plump, spending money without blinking, and could be cultivated for the long term.

"Haha..." Qin Ming was in a joyous mood. After reading just two pages, he was already amazed, and then he couldn't help but burst into hearty laughter.

Seeing this, Wu Chengwang smiled, becoming even more amiable, and finally couldn't help but burst into hearty laughter himself, sighing in his heart, "What a wonderful little fat lamb!"
