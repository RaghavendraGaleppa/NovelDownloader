# Chapter 104: Kill - Longevity: My Cultivation Talent Can Refresh

The grey-clad man's face drastically changed. At this moment, he no longer cared about attacking Lu Miaoying and hastily activated his magic power to maintain his defense.

Lu Miaoying finally realized that someone was helping her. Her gaze swept to the side. Not far away, a figure in green held a wooden longbow.

Chu Ning?

Lu Miaoying was surprised to see Chu Ning, who had been struck by the black light. She finally reacted, chanting a spell to continue her attack. At that moment, another green light shot from the bow in Chu Ning's hand, striking the grey-clad man's protective shield again.

This time, the grey-clad man could no longer resist. His shield instantly shattered, and two green lights pierced through his body.

"Seeking death!"

Seeing this, the black-clad man who had just killed Luo Yiping roared, changed direction, and swept towards Chu Ning. At the same time, he raised the staff he already held in his hand, and a grey, hazy mist surged out, instantly enveloping Chu Ning and the surrounding several yards, completely cutting off vision from the outside.

Upon seeing the black-clad man approach, Chu Ning chose to put away his Divine Wood Longbow. This magical artifact required a bit of time to activate and charge, making it suitable for long-range attacks. However, with the enemy closing in, it was a little too time-consuming. When he saw himself enveloped by the grey mist, his heart tensed.

He subconsciously held his breath, his body flickered, leaving his original position, and immediately activated another intermediate-grade low-tier defensive talisman to protect his body. Just as he finished doing all this, the sound of a spell striking his protective shield rang out. However, this time, the spell's destructive power was clearly not as great as the red and black light, so it failed to shatter his protective magical shield.

At the same time, Chu Ning also discovered that, apart from obscuring vision, the grey mist seemed to have no other negative effects. The black-clad man, relying on who knows what, was unaffected by the mist, which allowed him to accurately strike Chu Ning after he moved. Realizing this, Chu Ning's mind stirred, and he tried to release his spiritual sense. Immediately, his spiritual sense easily penetrated the grey mist. Although he had not yet found the black-clad man, Chu Ning was overjoyed. The black-clad man thought he would be blind, which might just be an opportunity for him to exploit. He rapidly approached the direction from which the black-clad man had cast his spell, and soon, the opponent's figure appeared within the range of his spiritual sense.

At this moment, the black-clad man was continuing to cast another spell with his staff, aiming at Chu Ning. However, now that he had found the opponent's figure, how could Chu Ning let him succeed?

Startling Thunder Steps!

Chu Ning rapidly closed in on the black-clad man. At the same time, from the talisman bracelet on his left hand, two true talismans formed by Crimson Flame Talismans instantly shot out, heading straight for the enemy.

The black-clad man was greatly alarmed by this scene. He had never expected Chu Ning to find his location so quickly and launch a magical attack so fast. Unable to dodge, he hastily activated his defensive shield!

"Hiss! Hiss!"

The Crimson Flame Talismans struck the black shield, consuming more than half of it in just the blink of an eye. And at the same time, Chu Ning had already closed in on the black-clad man.

Heavenly Gang Fist!

Borrowing the momentum of the Startling Thunder Steps, Chu Ning directly threw a punch with his right hand, striking straight for the black-clad man's heart.

"Crack!"

"Pfft!"

Accompanied by the sound of bones breaking, the black-clad man spewed a mouthful of fresh blood. His body instantly went limp and collapsed to the ground.

"Body cultivator!"

Only at the point of death did he realize that Chu Ning was a body cultivator, but what he couldn't comprehend even in death was how the other party had discovered him.

As soon as the black-clad man died, his staff lost its magical support, and the surrounding grey mist rapidly dissipated. Chu Ning's heart stirred at this moment. With a casual wave, a Geng Metal Sword Talisman shot out, directly severing the black-clad man's head.

Just as he finished all this, the grey mist completely dispersed. Everything in the distance fell into Chu Ning's eyes. Shen Zhengquan and Lu Miaoying were jointly attacking a black-clad man, having already gained the absolute upper hand. On the other side, under the continuous pincer attack of a tall, thin black-clad man and a修士 in yellow coarse linen, even the eighth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator Gu Xiaoqing was gradually weakening.

Seeing this situation, Chu Ning no longer hesitated. He took out his Divine Wood Longbow again. Azure Wood Sword Art was condensed into an arrow, locked onto the yellow-clad cultivator using the Divine Wood Longbow, and a green sword beam shot out.

The yellow-clad cultivator who was围攻Gu Xiaoqing had seen Chu Ning trapped in the grey mist, and then the mist quickly dispersed. He fully believed his companion had succeeded. He never expected Chu Ning to launch an attack at this moment. Only when the green sword beam arrived did he hastily try to activate his defense. But it was too late now.

The Azure Wood Sword Art, boosted by the Divine Wood Longbow, had doubled its attack explosive power. The sword beam actually pierced directly through the opponent's defense and struck the yellow-clad cultivator's body.

The yellow-clad cultivator's magical power rapidly drained away. The Azure Wood Sword Art, after absorbing it, shone brightly. In just one breath, the sword beam penetrated his body! At the same time, another green sword beam formed in Chu Ning's hand, shot out with the help of the Divine Wood Longbow, and headed towards the tall, thin black-clad man.

This tall, thin black-clad man, seeing the tragic death of the yellow-clad cultivator, was already terrified. Now seeing the green sword beam flying towards him, he quickly pulled his magical artifact, a black wheel, back in front of him to block it. Gu Xiaoqing, who had been incredibly frustrated from being surrounded and attacked by two cultivators, did not let this opportunity slip by. While the tall, thin black-clad man was fully focused on blocking Chu Ning's attack, her flying sword followed up, directly slicing off the tall, thin black-clad man's head.

The situation instantly reversed. The Azure Stream Sect disciples, who were originally at a disadvantage, gained an absolute advantage in the blink of an eye. The last black-clad man, seeing this, tried to flee, but was jointly surrounded and killed by Shen Zhengquan and Lu Miaoying.

Only at this moment did everyone's faces relax. Lu Miaoying then let out a "wah" and burst into tears. Clearly, this outer sect disciple from the Spirit Beast Hall had never experienced such a scene before. Having escaped death this time, she was directly frightened into crying. However, as she cried, her voice turned sorrowful. "Senior Brother Luo, he..."

Chu Ning also walked over to Luo Yiping's corpse with the others. Seeing the grief-stricken expressions on Gu Xiaoqing and Lu Miaoying's faces, he sighed slightly in his heart. If Luo Yiping hadn't fallen so far behind earlier, letting himself run to the front, then those red and black lights might not have attacked him, but rather Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan in the front. And it would have been hard to say whether the black light behind would have attacked him or Luo Yiping. As a result, he blocked the attacks for the three in front, and they all survived. Luo Yiping, alone behind, blocked the red and black light and was killed in one strike. One could only say this might be fate.

Seeing Gu Xiaoqing still comforting Lu Miaoying, and Shen Zhengquan standing by without any particular action, Chu Ning frowned and sighed, "Senior Sister Gu, we should hurry back to the market. If these people really are from the Dark Demonic Sect, staying here isn't safe."

Gu Xiaoqing, alerted by Chu Ning's reminder, suddenly reacted. "Junior Brother Chu is right, we'll leave immediately." Saying this, she helped Lu Miaoying, intending to depart. Chu Ning, seeing this, quickly spoke up to remind them:

"Wait a moment, shouldn't we tidy things up here a bit?"

After speaking, he didn't wait for their reactions. He directly picked up the storage bag of the grey-clad man, who was closest to him and whom he had killed first, and opened it. He had already suspected their identities for a long time, and now was the time to confirm it.

Soon, Chu Ning's face turned serious as he took out an iron plate from inside. "Dark Demonic Sect!"

Seeing the item in Chu Ning's hand, the other three exclaimed. A few months ago, they had all seen similar iron plates at Lin Changqing's place, so they recognized it at a glance. Chu Ning's brows were tightly furrowed. He had indeed guessed correctly; these people were truly from the Dark Demonic Sect.

"Why would people from the Dark Demonic Sect appear again, and even attack us?" Gu Xiaoqing's pretty face was filled with both shock and anger.

Chu Ning shook his head, not answering her question. Instead, he walked towards the others, searching the bodies of the slain and collecting their magical artifacts and storage bags. Then, he set fire to each of their bodies. Only then did he walk back to the others. Gu Xiaoqing and the other two looked at Chu Ning's actions with great astonishment. Why did Junior Brother Chu seem so practiced?

Chu Ning saw their expressions, sighed again in his heart, and casually said, "Senior Brothers and Sisters, you are all from the outer sect, unlike me who came from the servant disciples. So, for some outdoor matters, I consulted others more."

As he spoke, Chu Ning divided the items in his hand. He kept the magical artifacts and storage bags of the three people he killed. The items from the two people killed by Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan were given to them respectively. Gu Xiaoqing hesitated slightly upon seeing them.

Chu Ning then reminded her, "Even if Senior Sister doesn't want these things, you'll still have to show them to the sect when you go back. At the very least, we need to confirm their identities from their belongings." Gu Xiaoqing nodded slightly upon hearing this and took the items. Shen Zhengquan, without hesitation, took them, his gaze at Chu Ning flashing with complex emotions.

"Junior Brother Chu was able to kill three villains by himself, which greatly exceeded our expectations." Gu Xiaoqing had finally regained her composure, her gentle, watery eyes looking at Chu Ning. "Indeed, if it weren't for Junior Brother Chu, we might all have perished here today."

Everyone's minds had been somewhat flustered just now, but now that they had calmed down a little, they realized that Chu Ning, the one with the lowest cultivation, was the most crucial person in this battle, which surprised them somewhat.

Chu Ning had long anticipated their doubts. He shook his head and gave a bitter smile, saying, "It was just luck, thanks to before leaving the sect. Deacon He Changyou of the Spirit Plant Hall gave me an intermediate-grade defensive magical artifact, and I bought a few intermediate-grade low-tier defensive talismans in the market. But now, they're all ruined."

As he spoke, Chu Ning took out his Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield. At this point, the intermediate-grade defensive magical artifact had a black hole in the middle and was completely devoid of spiritual essence, clearly rendered unusable. Chu Ning continued, "In that grey mist, I was also lucky. I had many talismans in my hand, and by throwing them out, I happened to strike that villain. Otherwise, I might have been lost there too."

Then, he took out his Divine Wood Longbow from his storage bag. "Finally, it was all thanks to this advanced magical artifact I just bought at Cloud Sea Pavilion."

Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan suddenly looked enlightened. They now believed that Chu Ning had been able to block the black-gold light by relying on defensive talismans and the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield. They had also seen Chu Ning use the Divine Wood Longbow at the end. Seeing their expressions, Chu Ning didn't explain further. They naturally didn't know that he was able to block the red and black light at the end, besides the defensive talismans and the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield, also because of his Nine Transformations Body Refining Art, which had entered the 'uninterrupted sinews' stage. After all, those were three attacks.

Speaking of which, Chu Ning was also very fortunate that these red and black light attacks seemed to be limited to one per person. Otherwise, even he wouldn't have been able to withstand them. As for what happened in the grey mist, they hadn't seen it, so it was up to Chu Ning how he explained it.

"No matter what, it's thanks to Junior Brother Chu that we managed to escape this ordeal today." Gu Xiaoqing spoke again, her face showing gratitude. After all, she also understood that if Chu Ning hadn't gone ahead to block the opponent's most fierce attacks, she would likely have faced death.

"Senior Sister is too kind. If you hadn't blocked the attacks of the two villains by yourself earlier, even if I had means, I wouldn't have been able to use them." Chu Ning finished this sentence, quickly changed the subject, and pointed to Luo Yiping's corpse on the ground. "Senior Brother Luo..."

"We still need to take him back," Gu Xiaoqing said at this point. She thought for a moment and looked at Shen Zhengquan. "Junior Brother Shen, only your spirit boat can carry more people here. How about you take Senior Brother Luo's body with you?"

Shen Zhengquan nodded and released his flying boat again. Lu Miaoying silently picked up Luo Yiping's flying sword, then picked up his body and placed it on Shen Zhengquan's spirit boat. Seeing this, Gu Xiaoqing sighed softly. She took a Qi Replenishing Pill, released her flying sword again, and was the first to soar into the sky. Chu Ning and Shen Zhengquan also swallowed a Qi Replenishing Pill each, then controlled their respective flying magical artifacts and followed closely.

Because of what had just happened, everyone remained silent along the way, instead maintaining a vigilant guard. Fortunately, the journey was uneventful. It wasn't until they landed in the market that everyone truly breathed a sigh of relief.

"Should we go directly to Senior Brother Du?" Gu Xiaoqing turned her head, looking at Chu Ning and Shen Zhengquan, her tone questioning. Chu Ning did not speak at this point. When facing danger earlier, he had offered many suggestions, hoping to escape as soon as possible. But now that the danger was gone, he reverted to his usual habit of keeping a low profile.

Shen Zhengquan took the initiative to speak, "Let's go directly. Such a big thing has happened. We should ask Senior Brother Du if he can contact Deacon Lin." With that, the group headed towards Du Han's residence.

This was Chu Ning's first time visiting Du Han's residence. Unlike where they lived, Du Han lived in a two-story pavilion located in the center of the market, and it was built on the highest ground. Chu Ning only took a glance from afar and knew that if he stood on the second floor looking down, he would likely be able to see the entire market.

Indeed, before Chu Ning and the others even reached the courtyard, a figure leaped directly down from the second-story pavilion. It was Du Han. Du Han's gaze swept over, and upon seeing Luo Yiping's body, his expression immediately changed drastically.

"What happened?"

"It was people from the Dark Demonic Sect," Lu Miaoying, who had been silent all the way, cried out in grief. "Senior Brother Luo died by their hands."

"Dark Demonic Sect?" Du Han's face changed. At this moment, Lu Miaoying began to sob again, unable to speak. Gu Xiaoqing took over, roughly explaining the situation to Du Han. At the same time, she handed over an iron plate from her storage bag.

Du Han, with a grim face, took the iron plate, gritting his teeth, and said bitterly, "It truly is these demonic brats! I didn't expect them to return so soon after we just cleared out a batch a few months ago." After speaking, he frowned. "I can't make a decision on this matter right away. I'll immediately send a message to Deacon Lin, asking him to come over. He shouldn't be far today, so it won't take long for him to arrive."

As he spoke, Du Han took out a green spirit bird specifically used for messaging and released it. Lin Changqing arrived quickly, appearing in Yanji Market in less than an hour. Looking at Luo Yiping's corpse, Lin Changqing's cold face showed little emotion, but his gaze swept over the others.

"I already know what happened. You weren't the only ones attacked. In the past two days, some outer sect Qi Condensation disciples from our seven Qingxia Sects have been attacked one after another. Our Azure Stream Sect has also suffered significant losses." He paused slightly at this point, then continued, "I was planning to remind you all to be careful when going out when I came to the market these days, but I didn't expect something like this to happen."

"Other sects were attacked too?" Everyone was slightly stunned. "What exactly does the Dark Demonic Sect want to do?"

Lin Changqing shook his head. "Their true purpose is currently unknown. The seven major sects have already held an urgent discussion about this. If nothing unexpected happens, we will soon begin a larger-scale purge throughout the entire Qingxia Mountain Range."

Hearing Lin Changqing's words, the group exchanged glances, a hint of unease on their faces. Lin Changqing, seeing their expressions, actually showed a rare comforting look on his cold face. "You don't need to worry too much. The Dark Demonic Sect still doesn't dare to send too many high-level cultivators here. Their main targets are still some sect Qi Condensation disciples on outdoor missions; they haven't attacked the market yet. The sect will soon send people from the Enforcement Hall, along with Fengxia Valley, to form enforcement teams in the market composed entirely of sect disciples. So as long as you stay in the market, you don't need to worry too much."

Chu Ning had remained silent, but he was listening to Lin Changqing's words. His expression became somewhat serious. From Lin Changqing's words, he always had a feeling that a storm was brewing. Especially combined with the Dark Demonic Sect disciples infiltrating the Azure Stream Sect, he felt there was a larger conspiracy at play. He just didn't know if other sects also had Dark Demonic Sect infiltrators. Although Chu Ning was aware of this, he dared not reveal it to outsiders before fully understanding the specifics. Even among the three deacons he had more contact with over the past two years, who could guarantee that none of them were Dark Demonic Sect members? Before Qi Chongmao made his move, Chu Ning himself had always believed he was just a simple spiritual farmer.

Chu Ning sighed slightly. This matter was clearly not something an outer sect disciple like him could meddle in. If a large sect like the Azure Stream Sect could not detect the Dark Demonic Sect's conspiracy, then it was naturally destined for this calamity.

It was better to care more about his own safety. Thinking this, Chu Ning spoke to Lin Changqing, "Deacon, these Dark Demonic Sect disciples are not very high-level, but their methods are vicious. Especially these disciples, they can cast a red and black light spell attack that is extremely powerful. What exactly is that?"

"It should be the Dark Demonic Sect's Dark Demonic Slash," Lin Changqing replied. "It is rumored that there is a place in the Verdant Gloom Mountain Range where demonic flames are born. The Dark Demonic Sect has a secret technique that allows them to extract these demonic flames and seal them within magical artifacts, to be activated during combat. It is known to outsiders as the Dark Demonic Slash. Although its power varies depending on the caster's strength, it greatly exceeds the normal spell level of cultivators and is extremely difficult to guard against."

As Lin Changqing spoke, his gaze fell upon the slightly dark, circular hole in Luo Yiping's chest, and he frowned slightly. "I didn't expect them to even equip their Qi Condensation disciples with magical artifacts carrying the Dark Demonic Slash. It's also fortunate that they only had one each; otherwise, you might not have escaped today."

"Deacon Lin, they didn't just have one Dark Demonic Slash artifact, but four," Gu Xiaoqing immediately interjected. "Thanks to Junior Brother Chu, who blocked three of the attacks at the front, we were able to survive."

Lin Changqing looked at Chu Ning in surprise, seemingly not expecting Chu Ning, who was only at "fifth-layer Qi Condensation," to perform in such a way. Gu Xiaoqing then recounted the process of the battle, and Chu Ning also gave his explanation according to his previous statements.

After listening, Lin Changqing gave Chu Ning an appreciative look. Then, seeing Chu Ning's damaged Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield, he said, "It seems you were lucky. The first three Dark Demonic Slashes weren't particularly strong. Plus, your shield has a magic array specifically for defending against fire-attributed spells."

Chu Ning smiled bitterly upon hearing this. "Next time I encounter them, I won't have this luck. My defensive magical artifact is completely ruined."

Lin Changqing heard this and glanced at Chu Ning. "Indeed, these days, you disciples out there should have more self-defense items." He pondered for a moment, then spoke, "Although you lost one person, you killed five Dark Demonic Sect disciples, which counts as meritorious service. I will report this to the sect and apply for certain compensation for you. If the sect has a suitable magical artifact, we'll see if we can get you another one."

Chu Ning breathed a huge sigh of relief upon hearing this and quickly followed up, "Thank you, Deacon."

"You've had a fierce battle today; you must be exhausted. You should all go back," Lin Changqing waved his hand. "If there's any news, I will inform you."
