# Chapter 32: The Restoration Plan  

"You're a bit heavy!"  

After successfully transporting Chu Feifei to his spirit field, Gu Mo let out a long exhale. Riding the paper crane with a passenger consumed a significant amount of spiritual energy. Fortunately, Gu Mo's spiritual energy reserves were three times that of an ordinary Qi Refining first-stage cultivator—otherwise, he might not have made it back in one go.  

Hearing Gu Mo call her heavy, Chu Feifei clenched her fists in frustration. Female cultivators cared about their weight too, after all.  

However, her urge to punch Gu Mo quickly faded as her attention was drawn to the spirit field before her.  

"Is this the spirit field you rented?"  

She had already learned about Gu Mo renting his own spirit field from the Spirit Planting Hall during their journey here.  

Chu Feifei was astonished—this was a privilege usually reserved for outer sect disciples. For a moment, she even regretted not choosing the Spirit Planting Hall herself.  

But that regret vanished when she heard the conditions for renting a spirit field: one had to master at least one spirit farming technique to qualify.  

Chu Feifei had struggled even with basic spells like the *Cleansing Technique*, let alone more advanced ones. It seemed she had little talent for spellcasting, though she did have a natural affinity for formations.  

Gu Mo, on the other hand, had already demonstrated his skill in spellcasting back when they were both labor disciples. So, it wasn’t surprising that he had mastered a spirit farming technique and secured his own spirit field.  

"So, what do you think?"  

Gu Mo deactivated the illusion formation surrounding the field and led Chu Feifei inside. The field was currently a mess, with scattered remnants of spirit rice stalks strewn about.  

But from the quantity and quality of the stalks, Chu Feifei could estimate the field’s yield. Now she understood how Gu Mo had managed to acquire so many valuable resources.  

"This field’s quality is quite good," Chu Feifei remarked. Though not a spirit farmer herself, she could gauge the field’s condition based on the density of spiritual energy within.  

As she spoke, she walked deeper into the field, circling it a few times before locating the formation disk. Gu Mo’s eyes lit up—Chu Feifei truly had a knack for formations.  

"To repair this formation disk, we’ll need to replace the formation stones and restore some of the damaged formation patterns," Chu Feifei concluded after inspecting it.  

"I can craft the formation stones, but I’m not yet capable of repairing the patterns." Currently, her main tasks at the Formation Peak involved crafting formation stones and assisting senior formation masters in their placements.  

"How long until you can attempt the repairs?" Gu Mo asked.  

"About a year."  

After some thought, Chu Feifei estimated that in a year’s time, she would be considered an experienced disciple at the Formation Peak. Given her current performance, she might qualify for more advanced tasks—such as repairing basic formation patterns on the stones.  

### ---  

For small-scale formations, ordinary, patternless formation stones could be used. But for more complex formations, stones inscribed with specific patterns were necessary.  

Over time, or when formations were damaged in battle, these inscribed patterns would degrade.  

Repairing them then became essential. Large-scale formations—like the one in the Spirit Planting Hall’s valley—required tens of thousands of formation stones. Periodically, the hall would summon Formation Peak disciples to inspect and replace damaged stones.  

A single maintenance session could involve replacing hundreds or even thousands of stones. And the Spirit Planting Hall wasn’t the only one—other peaks also relied on the Formation Peak for upkeep. As a result, countless damaged stones were recycled each year.  

Rather than discarding them, labor disciples were tasked with repairing these stones so they could be reused in less critical formations.  

Repairing existing stones was far more cost-effective than crafting new ones—at least in terms of materials. However, the technical difficulty of pattern restoration far exceeded that of crafting blank stones.  

Because of the high skill requirement, the rewards for pattern restoration were significantly greater. Many labor disciples at the Formation Peak competed fiercely for the chance to learn this skill—it was a valuable asset that could secure their future.  

Only those who excelled in crafting blank stones were granted the opportunity to study pattern restoration.  

Chu Feifei was undoubtedly among the best in this regard, so she was confident she could secure the position.  

"Good!"  

Gu Mo nodded. A year was a wait he could afford. He then handed her ten pounds of spirit rice. "Consider this a deposit."  

Chu Feifei didn’t refuse. The rice would help accelerate her cultivation, allowing her to assist Gu Mo sooner. Besides, Gu Mo clearly wasn’t lacking in resources right now.  

At that moment, she realized Gu Mo was a better leader than Yao Shifeng. While Yao relied on their collective support, Gu Mo was already providing for them. The "deposit" of spirit rice felt more like an investment—similar to how they had once supported Yao.  

The only difference was that Yao had been supported by all four of them, meaning he owed them all in the future. But with Gu Mo, she only owed him.  

### ---  

If the spirit rice was material support, then Gu Mo’s guidance on the *Cleansing Technique* was cultivation support.  

Once her questions about the technique were answered, Chu Feifei took her leave. As a labor disciple, she had daily tasks to complete and couldn’t stay away for long.  

Meanwhile, Gu Mo returned to his farming. For his third planting season, he had initially considered cultivating higher-grade spirit plants to accelerate his accumulation of sect contributions.  

With his mastery of all five spirit farming techniques, his success rate with high-grade plants would be substantial.  

However, most high-grade plants took at least a year to mature—some even two or three. That meant no income during that period.  

Gu Mo needed to maintain the illusion formation, which was a significant expense. And if a concealment technique appeared in the market, he’d need funds to purchase it immediately.  

Thus, he first needed to build up savings before fully committing to high-grade plants for greater profits.  

The best crop for quick earnings was undoubtedly spirit jade rice. Normally taking six months to mature, Gu Mo could harvest it in just over four—making it the fastest way to accumulate funds.  

But just as he headed to the Spirit Planting Hall to collect seeds for another season of spirit jade rice, unexpected news disrupted his plans.
