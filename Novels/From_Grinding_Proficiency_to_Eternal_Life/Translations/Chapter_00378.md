# Chapter 378: Enemy from the Skies

"I..."

*Swish!*

The vast Zhou Tian Water True Qi burst forth from the Pavilion Master's meridians like a collapsing dam. Her well-maintained skin visibly withered and cracked, her black hair turning to ash in an instant.

When the last wisp of True Qi was extracted, the Pavilion Master, who once commanded the martial arts of the Eastern Sea, had transformed into a shriveled corpse with sunken eye sockets, her gaping mouth frozen in an unfinished plea.

Xu Yunfan flicked his hand, shattering the dried corpse. Before the remains could hit the ground, the sea wind scattered them into dust.

He stood atop the ruins of the Penglai Pavilion, the sea wind carrying the salty scent of water brushing past his robes.

Xu Yunfan slowly closed his eyes, feeling the surging Ten Extremities True Qi within his body.

The foreign True Qi plundered from the Penglai Pavilion Master, the Supreme Elder of the Nine Stars Sect, and the Senior Elder of the Sword Pavilion was now raging violently within Xu Yunfan's flesh and blood like a tidal wave.

Although most of it had been refined by the Ten Extremities True Qi, a massive amount of True Qi remained untamed. In particular, the True Qi of the five Supreme Elders of the Penglai Pavilion was as deep as an abyss and as vast as the sea, even purier and more profound than the Nine Realm experts of the other five major sects.

Penglai Pavilion occupied the spiritual veins of the Eastern Sea and sat atop the natural treasures of the Penglai leyline. Its disciples tempered their bodies with Weak Water and cultivated their Qi with Primordial Spirits throughout the year, refining their True Qi into a substance as thick as mercury slurry and jade liquid, heavy and enduring.

Now, these foreign True Qi rampaged recklessly within Xu Yunfan's body. Each strand carried the unique "Zhou Tian Water" characteristic of the Penglai Pavilion. Sometimes it transformed into furious waves battering his blood and Qi, sometimes it condensed into cold needles stabbing his acupoints. It even faintly conflicted with the previously devoured Nine Stars True Fire and Xuanzhen Dragon-Tiger Qi, erupting with tearing pain.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged, knowing this was due to absorbing too much in a short period.

The Ten Extremities True Qi spread out from the intersection of his flesh and blood, wrapping around the rampaging foreign True Qi like vines.

These truly vast True Qi filled his body, giving him a feeling of being stuffed to the brim, as if absorbing a bit more would burst his stomach.

Each strand carried the martial dao characteristics of its original owner: the scorching heat of the Nine Stars Devouring Qi Technique, the ferocity of the Xuanzhen Sect's Dragon-Tiger True Qi, the purity of the Amitabha Temple's Buddhist Pure Flame... They tore at each other, yet were forcibly fused by the domineering assimilation power of the Ten Extremities True Qi.

"It's still not quite enough..."

He murmured softly, then suddenly opened his arms.

*Boom!*

Centered on him, the sea surface within a hundred zhang radius suddenly depressed, forming a massive whirlpool.

The Ten Extremities True Qi emerged from his body surface, swirling around him.

As time passed, Xu Yunfan's skin gradually took on a jade-like luster.

The rampaging foreign True Qi within his body began to collapse. Under the forced suppression of the Ten Extremities True Qi, they were crushed and purified, eventually transforming into a drop of viscous, mercury-like golden liquid that hovered at the center of the intersection between his flesh and blood.

Then came the second drop, the third drop... When the thousandth drop of liquid True Qi condensed, his entire body trembled slightly. The vast, sea-like True Qi began to converge like rivers returning to the sea, rapidly transforming into liquid True Qi and gathering here to form a brilliant golden lake.

Whether it was "Myriad Chariots Sword Dao" or "Annihilation Dust Heart Sutra," their cultivation essentials all mentioned the method of opening the Dantian.

The place where Xu Yunfan's True Qi converged was precisely the crucial point where flesh and blood intersected with meridians, perfectly matching the location of the Dantian described in the classics.

If he could open a Qi Sea here, he could further condense the liquid True Qi into True Essence, even touching the threshold of Foundation Establishment.

However, while "Hundred Skeletons Piercing Mysteries" could reshape meridians and connect the hundred bones, it needed to be配合 with "Open Meridian Pill" to be truly effective.

This pill was a secret transmission of the Primordial Origin Sect. Youquan mentioned it was a unique item from another world, currently unobtainable. There was only a sliver of hope if he went to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

"True Qi transforms into liquid, martial dao ascends to the void..."

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, his pupils seeming to have a red python swimming within.

He raised his hand and lightly划动. The True Qi overflowing from his fingertips actually solidified in the air, transforming into a three-inch small sword. The sword edge didn't move, yet it silently split a reef ten zhang away in half.

Half a day later, at the summit of Qingwei Mountain.

Xu Yunfan stepped through the air to arrive. With the lightest touch of his toes, clouds naturally formed steps beneath his feet.

The Taoist boy at the mountain gate hadn't even had time to report when he saw a crimson-gold light stream shoot straight toward the main peak, startling him so much he nearly dropped the whisk in his hand.

"Master."

Xu Yunfan landed before the Questioning Cliff, bowing respectfully to the blue-robed Taoist brewing tea in the stone pavilion.

Bi Yuan set down the teapot, his fingertips trembling slightly, yet the water ripples in the teacup strangely remained still.

He gazed at the unusual phenomenon of flowing light caused by the True Qi swirling around Xu Yunfan, his voice hoarse and distant: "Two thousand years ago, when the spiritual energy of heaven and earth had not yet faded, Patriarch Chunyang broke through the Nine Realm shackles. At that time, there was also such an unusual phenomenon of 'True Qi Condensing into Radiance, Zhou Tian Resonating'... Unfortunately, the records are incomplete, and later generations only treat it as legend."

He suddenly let out a low laugh, the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes relaxing. "I didn't expect that in my lifetime, I would actually witness the Land Immortal Realm with my own eyes... My life has not been in vain!"

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered slightly. "Patriarch Chunyang?"

He raised his fingertips slightly, a strand of solidified True Qi appeared in his palm. Using the three sword techniques left by Patriarch Chunyang, it transformed into a three-inch small sword. The sword edge didn't move, yet it silently severed the icicles hanging from the corner of the stone pavilion's roof.

"When this disciple翻阅 the Taoist scriptures, I only knew that the Patriarch eventually ascended at the summit of Qingwei Mountain, but I found no records of his breakthrough."

Bi Yuan let out a long sigh, raising his head to look at the horizon.

After this battle, the Dao Sect's fortune was like adding fuel to a raging fire or embroidering flowers on brocade. Under the reflection of the eighth-grade divine weapon [Mysterious Heaven Mirror], its aura soared into the sky, actually suppressing the combined fortune of the other five major sects.

The mirror surface rippled, revealing the unusual phenomenon of the seventy-two peaks of Qingwei Mountain resonating together—a sign of unprecedented prosperity in a thousand years.

"Fortune is like a dragon, but it also makes one a target..."

He stroked the eight characters "Observe the Way of Heaven, Execute the Will of Heaven" inscribed on the mirror's edge, a hint of worry flashing in his eyes.

Bi Yuan looked at the disciple before him, supported by the Xuanhuang Qi, with crimson-gold radiance swirling around his body. The Ten Extremities True Qi moved like dragons beneath his skin, and the pressure of the Land Immortal Realm made the pines and cypresses on the Questioning Cliff tremble and bow.

Although he was shocked and delighted in his heart.

He looked up at the churning Xuanhuang sea of clouds above the Dao Sect's headquarters and knew that the Dao Sect had thoroughly offended all five major sects this time.

"If we cannot sweep away all factions..."

Xu Yunfan laughed lightly. "Master, you worry too much. Even if this disciple's strength stops advancing after reaching the Land Immortal Realm, I still have at least three hundred good years of life. Within three hundred years, the Dao Sect will be the number one power in this world. Moreover, Li Haomiao, who is a disciple of the Dao Sect, has already honored the Dao Sect as the National Religion. The two are now closely intertwined. He has already established his momentum, and what follows will simply be pushing the boat with the current."

"Furthermore..."

Xu Yunfan said casually, "These past few days, with nothing better to do, I have already beheaded the Nine Realm Qi cultivators of each sect and destroyed their respective sects. I think the Penglai Pavilion is quite a place of spiritual beauty."

He spoke casually, as if merely brushing dust off his clothes.

Bi Yuan's pupils contracted violently. Xu Yunfan's speed these past two days had been too fast; the Dao Sect had not received any news whatsoever.
