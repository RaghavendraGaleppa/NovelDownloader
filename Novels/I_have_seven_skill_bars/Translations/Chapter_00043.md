# Chapter 43: Bro, We Hit the Jackpot

After dismounting, Ding Rui touched his hair, which was standing on end. He couldn't help but use the *Rain Dew Skill* to summon a light shower over his head, finally taming his wild locks.

"With a saddle, sitting isn't as painful. A cushion would make it even more comfortable, but I still need to figure out how to add a wind guard, which could also block rain sometimes."

"After all, cultivators at Qi Condensation First Level still possess gaseous true essence, incapable of fully resisting wind and rain. Even at Qi Condensation Second or Third Level, using true essence to block the elements would still consume spiritual sense, which is quite a luxury. Spirit field cultivators, burdened daily with the heavy task of farming, don't have that much spiritual sense to spare on such things."

The mobilization of true essence, much like physical activity, relies on spiritual sense. Even cultivation itself consumes some, and the consumption for true essence is naturally greater. Although spiritual sense grows tougher with repeated and appropriate use, fatigue is still inevitable. To maintain ample energy for their work in the spirit fields, cultivators generally conserve their spiritual sense. Shielding oneself from wind and rain is not easy; the stronger the elements, the more true essence is required to resist them, leading to a greater drain on spiritual sense.

"I can refer to those umbrellas external members used to put on their electric bikes. But where should this umbrella be placed? What material would be best?"

As he pondered, he drilled a few holes in the saddle and used two hemp ropes to securely fasten it to Ma Wen's belly. He also left a short rope at the top of the saddle for passengers to grip.

"Alright, Brother Ma, you go. I'll await your good news!"

...

It immediately ran to the logistics office.

Generally speaking, the spirit field area, which includes the logistics office, had the highest flow of cultivators.

Ma Wen hadn't been standing at the logistics office for long when a voice suddenly sounded near its ear: "Excuse me, Fellow Horse Cultivator, what is that thing on your back? I've never seen anything like it before."

Ma Wen immediately turned its head, its lips curling upwards, squeezing a smile onto its horse face. "This is a saddle we developed. It's the only one of its kind in the entire sect, designed purely for the comfort of passengers. Sitting on this saddle, you can experience a level of comfort you've never known, a sense of peace and security you've never felt, and a thrill of speed and scenery you've never encountered."

"You no longer need to crouch on the horse's back, nor struggle to grip the mane around its neck, nor exert yourself squeezing its belly with your legs. You can ride with complete ease. How about it? Care for a try?"

Ma Wen's sales pitch was incredibly smooth, and the cultivator immediately grew interested, asking, "Then, riding this, it doesn't cost extra spirit rice, does it?"

Ma Wen's commercial acumen kicked in. It swallowed the "no extra cost" that was almost out of its mouth and instead said, "You're the very first customer, so it won't cost extra!"

The cultivator's eyes lit up. "Then I absolutely must try it!"

"Good, come on up. Just sit directly in the saddle." Ma Wen beckoned to the man.

The cultivator was still in a daze, only snapping back to reality after Ma Wen urged him several times.

Disembarking from the horse's back, he touched his legs and buttocks, then clenched his fists tightly, exclaiming with excitement, "Amazing! Absolutely amazing! It's truly comfortable! Can I ride you again next time, brother?"

Ma Wen suppressed the joy in its heart, but its horse mouth still curved upwards wildly. "Of course, of course. But next time, there will be an extra charge. Also, this horse prefers long-distance runs; this short distance really isn't enough."

"I also feel it wasn't enough!" the cultivator heartily agreed.

The two exchanged a few more words. The cultivator paid the spirit rice, then, with his hair still flying wildly, he floated back to his spirit field.

Ma Wen, without a moment's delay, hurried back to the logistics office, whistling happily along the way: "Extra spirit rice! This definitely deserves extra spirit rice!"

Ma Wen hadn't been standing at the logistics department for long when another female cultivator approached.

"Excuse me, Fellow Horse Cultivator, what is that on your back?"

Ma Wen, with the saddle on its back, was undoubtedly a striking sight among the many ordinary horse cultivators. As soon as any cultivator showed interest and asked, Ma Wen, with its eloquent speech, could immediately capture their attention. Moreover, Ma Wen cleverly only added one grain of spirit rice to the original price, and even preemptively explained that it was a special discount because it was the first day of business.
