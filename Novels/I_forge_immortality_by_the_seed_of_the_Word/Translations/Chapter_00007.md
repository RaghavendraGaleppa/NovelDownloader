# Chapter 7: On How to Cultivate With Cheats

Consciousness was a swirling chaos.

An unknowable amount of time passed.

Zhang Jing gradually regained awareness, only to find a pair of beady eyes staring intently at him. He startled backward in alarm.

"Brother Zhang, what's wrong?"

Opposite him, Ji Bochang gaped in astonishment, instinctively touching his own face as he muttered, "Is there something dirty on my face I didn't wipe off?"

Coming to his senses, Zhang Jing wiped sweat from his brow and quickly replied, "N-no, nothing like that! That's not something you should pick at anyway. By the way, Brother Ji, did you need something when you called me earlier?"

"Oh, I saw you hadn't woken up for a long time and thought something might be wrong."

"Nothing serious—just my first exposure to immortal cultivation methods was quite overwhelming." Zhang Jing's expression turned slightly awkward as he extended his hand. "Let's pass the jade slip to the next person. They're probably getting impatient."

"Wait, where's the jade slip?"

Only then did Zhang Jing realize the jade slip had disappeared from his hand.

"Brother Zhang," Chu Lingyun stepped forward to explain, "you used it for quite a while, and those behind us grew impatient. When I saw the jade slip had already detached from your forehead, I took the liberty of removing it. My apologies."

Murmurs rose from the crowd behind them:

"Did he think staring longer would increase his chances of mastering cultivation?"

"Let it go. Maybe he just lacked the aptitude—have some sympathy."

Zhang Jing suddenly understood. Glancing at the now-skilled [Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Method] on his jade talisman, he calmly ignored the comments.

"My apologies, Fairy Chu. It was my fault for delaying everyone."

"Your understanding is appreciated, Brother Zhang. If you'll excuse me." As if pressed for time, Chu Lingyun hurried away immediately.

"Brother Zhang," Ji Bochang said apologetically, clapping Zhang Jing's shoulder, "it wasn't that I didn't want to stop her, but if I had, you'd have become everyone's target. Those behind us wouldn't dare blame me, so they'd take it out on you instead. Don't hold it against me—keeping it wouldn't have helped you anyway."

He then asked with sudden enthusiasm, "Any parts of the Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Method you don't understand? I might be able to help."

Hearing this, Zhang Jing thought he'd misheard and turned to stare at Ji Bochang.

Recognizing the question in Zhang Jing's eyes, Ji Bochang explained quietly, "I know what you're wondering. As you've probably guessed, my family has cultivators, like Chu Lingyun and the other two."

Zhang Jing nodded, then voiced his confusion directly: "If you're from a cultivation family, why take the Dragon Lake Academy's entrance exam? Don't you have family cultivation methods?"

Meeting his gaze, Ji Bochang answered frankly: "Simply put, Dragon Lake Academy is the pinnacle of Nali Kingdom's cultivation world. All other cultivation forces survive by following its lead. Our Ji family's strongest ancestor matches an inner court disciple in cultivation level, but falls far short in actual combat."

"So that's it!" Zhang Jing realized. "So while you haven't practiced visualization methods, you've been exposed to—no, mastered them in your family. That's how you—"

"Exactly! All cultivation family disciples are the same." Ji Bochang's solemn expression lasted mere moments before excitement lit his small eyes. "So ask away! I'm more than qualified to guide you. But fair's fair—each question you ask means you teach me a new fan-painting pose, something never seen before, and—"

As Ji Bochang grew increasingly animated, Zhang Jing glanced around nervously and cut him off. "Stop! We'll discuss this later. I'll definitely come to you with questions."

"Fine then," Ji Bochang said, disappointment flashing across his face.

As dusk fell, inside his stone house, Zhang Jing lit the oil lamp on his table. Watching the flickering flame, his heart burned with anticipation.

Just as he'd predicted, the Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Method he'd learned from the jade slip had formed a skill on his jade talisman.

He examined the talisman:

[Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Method · Uninitiated (0/50)]
[Low-Grade Dharma Seed: Mind's Eye (Cannot be upgraded)]
[Nether Dragon Devours Void Dao Rhyme · Fragment (Cannot be upgraded)]

A realization struck him—the skill descriptions had changed. "Why do the Mind's Eye Dharma Seed and yesterday's Dao Rhyme now say 'Cannot be upgraded'?" 

Wasn't this protesting too much? Did this mean these skills could be upgraded, just not under current conditions? This change likely related to his newly acquired skill.

Immortal cultivation? Cultivation level? Mental state? Or something else?

Zhang Jing's eyes shone with excitement. He would uncover the answer eventually.

Calming himself, he focused on tonight's task. After quickly washing up, he sat cross-legged on his bed, eyes closed as he recalled the method's contents to begin visualization practice.

Step one: Visualize Pure Essence Light.

Pure Essence Light—most gentle in nature, most pure in hue, formless yet vast, the primordial spiritual radiance that draws upon heavenly energy...

Time flowed silently.

Suddenly, Zhang Jing sensed a pure, thick glow before him—but before he could rejoice, it collapsed and vanished.

Failure!

Dejection rose unbidden. Rallying himself, Zhang Jing checked the talisman:

[Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Method · Uninitiated (1/50)]

Proficiency had increased! Delight and surprise filled him. With the jade talisman's help, just forty-nine more practice sessions would initiate the method.

Assessing his condition, Zhang Jing felt reassured. Though practicing the uninitiated method drained mental energy as described, he could manage—two to three daily meditation sessions.

"Thirty days, at least two proficiency points daily—enough to initiate the method! Barring surprises, I'll pass the exam! Enter Dragon Lake Academy! Cultivate the path to immortality!"

It seemed too good to be true.

Wait—he still had the Mind's Eye Dharma Seed.

When activated, the Mind's Eye dramatically enhanced perception and comprehension—like wielding cheat codes. What would happen practicing the visualization method in this state?

No sooner thought than done. After steadying his breathing, Zhang Jing activated the Dharma Seed.

A phantom third eye opened in his mind's depths. The vast ocean of information from the Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Method flashed through it instantly.

Comprehension flooded Zhang Jing's consciousness like an unending tide. His cultivation speed multiplied several times over.
