# Chapter 248: Forging a Path

Qin Ming was very rational. The slow progress on the Path of Rebirth was a cruel reality. This was a difficult hurdle, one that all past sages had been blocked by. Qin Ming frowned, pondering seriously.

In the second realm of the Path of Rebirth, breaking through a small bottleneck could take even a genius ten years. To fully master this realm, even a youth with extraordinary talent would likely have frosted temples. Qin Ming’s natural endowments were superb, which could shorten the time, but it was still incomparable to the first realm. The third realm of the Path of Rebirth was even harder to traverse, with progress further slowing down, requiring approximately double the time. Upon reaching the fourth realm, the difficulty continued to increase.

Qin Ming thought of the Hegemon’s Lost Manuscript. From the third realm onwards, it effectively boosted cultivation speed, but only relatively. "In the third realm of the Path of Rebirth, a normal genius would need twenty years for each bottleneck. If one uses the methods described in the manuscript, it could be shortened to seven or eight years. This indeed greatly improves efficiency. The Hegemon truly lived up to his heaven-defying talent."

However, after several bottlenecks, it would still take over twenty years. Qin Ming felt it was still too slow, because the time spent on subsequent major realms would continue to accumulate, which was quite frightening.

He then rose, called out to Little Wu, and prepared to visit Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan.

In the bamboo forest, in front of the thatched hut, camellia tea scented the stone table. The two elders sat there, smiling, having seen results after consuming the auspicious beast blood. On their heads, near dozens of strands of hair, a small patch of hair roots had appeared, slowly growing out and then fluttering there.

"That's it?" Little Wu didn't even know how to comment.

"Seniors, how do you feel?" Qin Ming asked.

"Quite good, it's effective." Both men were beaming, touching the hundred-plus additional strands of hair on their heads, seemingly quite pleased. Their lifespan had been extended, though not by much. But for the next few years, they wouldn't have to worry about their life force draining away. After all, this wasn't the auspicious beast's heart blood. For individuals at their level, such an effect was already quite extraordinary.

The two retrieved spirit crystals the size of human heads and returned them to Qin Ming and Little Wu respectively. They had each only used half of the auspicious beast blood, as further use had little effect. Earlier, Little Wu had also eagerly offered a share.

"Little Qin, I see you have something on your mind, what's wrong?" Yu Gensheng asked.

Qin Ming put down his teacup and said, "I was distracted. I was thinking about the Path of Rebirth problem. From the second realm onwards, it simply takes too much time."

Yu Gensheng sighed, "Past sages exhausted their minds and efforts, but they still haven't fundamentally solved the problem."

Qin Ming nodded. He didn't want to waste time and hoped to progress as bravely and diligently as he did in the first realm. If, in the end, he stagnated and had to compete with the descendants of Cui Chonghe and Li Qingxu, that would be truly regrettable.

Zhao Ziyuan said, "We'll grant you access. Go to the top floor of the Hidden Books Pavilion and look at the cultivation experiences of some 'notable figures' on the Path of Rebirth."

Qin Ming's eyes instantly lit up. Although he had his own plans and methods, it would naturally be even better if he could draw upon the vast experiences of past sages.

"I want to go too, to perfect my own path," Little Wu also became interested.

At Mountain River Academy, the ninth floor of the Hidden Books Pavilion was very quiet. It contained many rare "miscellaneous books," ranging from the Nine Questions of Longevity to explorations of the Night World, and discussions on quasi-divine beings. Qin Ming didn't have the energy to read through everything, so he naturally chose books related to breaking through bottlenecks to study.

"Hmm, many of the issues I've been pondering, past sages were also thinking about. Indeed, one needs to stand on the shoulders of historical figures to see further."

For instance, his path of "seeking within oneself," only practicing extraordinary techniques and not integrating anomalous substances to enhance the power of Sky-Light Energy, had also been explored by predecessors. However, an ancient figure sighed, stating that while this path was fine, as it avoided refining malignant energies and thus reduced the absorption of harmful substances, which even increased lifespan. Nevertheless, the Sky-Light Energy cultivated this way was ultimately somewhat weaker.

Qin Ming saw the signature; it was actually a Grandmaster's handwritten notes! His heart stirred with surprise. This was a treasure trove, containing the insights of such a figure. Soon, he was greatly shocked again, because there were also records here about Qingtian, Rulai, Liuyu, and others.

"How did they choose?" Qin Ming quickly flipped the pages.

He read very carefully. Some pursued the power of Sky-Light Energy, but their lifespan was shortened, and they eventually had to spend time and effort to mend their life foundation. "The Patriarchs all emphasize balance. Refining malignant energies, integrating anomalous substances, and also diligently practicing extraordinary techniques to extend lifespan. In the process, some cut off harmful substances, while others fully assimilated them."

Qin Ming read repeatedly, studying for a long time. He gained a clearer understanding of his own path. He possessed the Essence of Starlight, a legendary anomalous substance, incredibly terrifying in power. It would be a waste not to utilize it. He pondered for a long time, believing that in the early stages, he could use malignant energies and anomalous substances to temper his Sky-Light Energy, but not to fully absorb them. He should prioritize "seeking within oneself," and if anything went wrong, quickly "shed the impurities."

"I don't lack extraordinary techniques, I just lack a type of malignant energy that contrasts with the Essence of Starlight." After all, his search for the Cycle of Growth and Decay Sutra had this consideration in mind.

Qin Ming flipped through one handwritten note after another. Regarding how to improve cultivation speed, predecessors had made various attempts. "Dragon Blood from the Dragon Sucking Water phenomenon, secret medicines from the Apertures of the Earth... these extraordinary substances had miraculous effects even on those in the third realm."

However, those "substances" were too rare and hard to find.

"There's also the Bone-Changing Method, which involves fusing with divine bones, treating them as high-grade anomalous substances, allowing the physical body to mutate rapidly and enhance oneself. However, there's a risk of loss of control in the future."

A large stack of rare books piled up in front of Qin Ming. Various methods were recorded, with their pros and cons mentioned, none being perfect.

"Some speculated that if one were to repeatedly experience near-death resurrection in each realm, thoroughly embodying the true meaning of 'rebirth,' it might be the hope for the Path of Rebirth."

Qin Ming was surprised; this indeed aligned with some of his own ideas. However, how easy was it to do? The key was a matter of degree, how to grasp it. One misstep could lead to eternal oblivion, complete death. Most importantly, this wasn't universally applicable; it relied entirely on overwhelming natural endowments. For ordinary people, it was far too unfriendly.

Next, he saw a handwritten note left by a certain past sage that deeply affected him. "The Path of Rebirth, its first realm allows the body to mutate; this is fundamental. Why can't the second realm mutate? Why can't it continue in the third realm?"

This past sage believed that the cultivation speed on the Path of Rebirth slowed down from the second realm because it lacked the most crucial step—mutation. He believed that in subsequent major realms, one didn't need to be reborn nine times in each realm, but maintaining one such rebirth was necessary. This could compensate for the deficiencies of the Path of Rebirth, thus accelerating progress.

"I've thought that too. Hmm, geniuses throughout history are not lonely; there are always kindred spirits who agree."

Qin Ming smiled. This was one of the directions he had seriously considered, and he hadn't expected a predecessor to have also attempted it. However, it was easier said than done. Some ideas simply couldn't be realized. Just like this past sage, he eventually felt deeply frustrated, because in the subsequent major realms, he only managed one rebirth with the aid of "heavenly materials."

"Succeeding once is already quite remarkable. This shows it's not a pipe dream, and it's worth blazing a trail."

Qin Ming was ravenous, constantly flipping through various books here. Some were clearly unique copies, imbued with the strong emotional fluctuations of their predecessors. He saw many novel worlds here. Where others merely read a book, he sometimes browsed through a lifetime, a piece of history. The miscellaneous books here were of immense value, many involving "secrets."

Little Wu was also diligently studying nearby. He was like a sponge, constantly absorbing the wisdom and experience of predecessors, comparing them to his own Path of Rainbow Transformation, hoping to solve the flaw of eventually abandoning the physical body.

Lu Zizai arrived, found Qin Ming here, and spoke to him via secret voice transmission. "Feel free to experiment and follow your own ideas. Don't be constrained by the paths of your predecessors. After all, our paths all have flaws. In this era, everyone can try to forge new paths."

The current era was a special grand era, where cultivation methods were emerging and still needed refinement. Whether it was the new generation, old monsters, or future individuals, everyone had the opportunity to seek truth, transcend deities, and become ancestors. Everything was still in the process of forging new paths.

Qin Ming asked about the physical condition of the Patriarchs. How were they really?

"Neither good nor bad. Some might achieve nirvana and rebirth, others are hard to say. The Great Wilderness may be an opportunity for them, or it might bury them completely."

Overall, the future was shrouded in mist, and no one could say what would happen. The pressure of the Path of Rebirth had not lessened; successors still needed to catch up and surpass. However, people from the Immortal Path and Esoteric Sects were very wary, as they couldn't discern the true state of the Patriarchs, and had now completely softened their stance.

"When your cultivation reaches a certain level, you can visit the major ancestral grounds of the Path of Rebirth," Lu Zizai said. As for now, there was no need. Lu Zizai threw him a few jade tokens, all tokens of identity from the major ancestral grounds, telling him to keep them safe.

During this time, Qin Ming consulted him on some issues, such as choices in the second realm, and shared his insights from practicing the silk scroll method. "My success in practicing the silk scroll method, was it related to my near-death experience back then?"

"The Path of Rebirth, its name encompasses everything..."

After a conversation, Lu Zizai left in a hurry. He seemed very busy, with many matters to attend to.

Qin Ming and Little Wu left the Hidden Books Pavilion, both feeling greatly rewarded, gradually seeing their future path clearly.

"Uncle Meng!"

Upon returning, Qin Ming found Meng Xinghai had arrived. It had been a long time since they last met, and it truly felt incredibly warm.

"Haha, it's not just me, Elder Li has also come, visiting friends at Mountain River Academy," Meng Xinghai laughed.

Sure enough, Li Qingyun soon appeared and said, "You brat, last time you took a spaceship to Kunlun, you disappeared mid-journey and worried us sick." Li Qingyun had arrived long ago and had searched for him for some time without success.

Qin Ming was very touched. These two had busied themselves for him, protecting him numerous times and taking great care.

"This time, you've caused quite a stir. Have you considered your next steps?" Meng Xinghai asked.

Qin Ming said, "I plan to go into seclusion for cultivation and rapidly improve my strength."

Meng Xinghai nodded, "Mm, lie low for now. Everything else is secondary; raising your cultivation realm is the fundamental priority."

Li Qingyun said, "Why don't you come with me to the reclusive family? It's very quiet there and can help you avoid the world's noise and troubles."

"Uncle Li, are you trying to recruit a grandson-in-law?" Meng Xinghai asked with a smile.

"This... that actually sounds like a good suggestion!" Li Qingyun surprisingly nodded in agreement.
