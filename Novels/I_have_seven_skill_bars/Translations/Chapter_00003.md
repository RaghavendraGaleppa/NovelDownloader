**Chapter 3: Matthew**

Liu Yun, who shared Spirit Field 377 with Ding Rui, was about to become a Spirit Farmer. Liu Yun possessed astonishing talent in the Raindrop Art, having achieved profound mastery. He could summon rain for several acres of spirit fields at once. Among all the spirit field cultivators in the Xuanfu Sect, he could be called the foremost expert in the Raindrop Art. His Condensing Yang Art and Verdant Wood Art had also been successfully cultivated. Once he cultivated the Golden Radiance Art and Earth Qi Art, Liu Yun would have all five basic Five Elements cultivation arts, granting him the ability to independently care for a spirit field. He would officially become a Spirit Farmer!

Spirit Farmers were responsible for their own spirit fields. Apart from the portion of spirit rice harvest given to the Sect, the rest belonged to them. Cultivators who hadn't mastered all five basic Five Elements cultivation arts could only work for the Sect. Although their harvest wasn't low, it ultimately couldn't compare to the higher potential yield of a Spirit Farmer. Some powerful Spirit Farmers could even acquire more resources than outer disciples.

Ding Rui had only just successfully cultivated one basic Five Elements cultivation art. However, he had finally become a cultivator, capable of participating in spirit field cultivation and earning spirit rice rewards. No longer did he have to solely absorb the ambient spiritual energy at a snail's pace, as he had before. "Thank you, Senior Brother!" Ding Rui sincerely thanked the other party. Then, he left the Logistics Department.

Within the Sect, the Matthews had no conflicts with human cultivators. In this dangerous world, they coexisted peacefully and helped each other. As the Matthews excelled at rapid, long-distance travel, they often took on tasks involving carrying people and goods to earn spirit rice and other cultivation resources useful to them.

This particular Matthew, named Mawen, delivered Ding Rui safely in less than half an hour. It opened its mouth, consumed the portion of spirit rice Ding Rui offered as payment, and then vanished without a trace. Ding Rui's long hair stood on end, still somewhat exhilarated. This was his first time riding a Matthew using spirit rice since transmigrating, and he had thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of lightning speed. The only downsides were the strong wind that made it hard to open his eyes and the slight soreness in his bottom from the jostling.

"Next time, I should find a Matthew and collaborate on developing saddles, wind shields, and similar items," Ding Rui thought to himself. "They'd surely sell well!" He walked into Spirit Field 377, where Liu Yun and the others, weary from a day's work, had already gone to sleep. Ding Rui went straight to his room, preparing to cultivate with spirit rice. He had received a total of fifty portions of spirit rice as a reward for successfully cultivating his art. After spending one portion on the Matthew ride, he had forty-nine left. He cultivated until midnight.

After hearing this, Ding Rui chuckled. He neither left nor spoke, instead extending a finger. With a thought, the stored Gold-attributed True Essence immediately surged out, coursing into his finger, turning his entire index finger golden. Old Huang, who was about to deal with another aphid, saw this dazzling light out of the corner of his eye. He turned, completely stunned! "You..." Old Huang exclaimed, marveling, "You... you, you, you!" Ding Rui winked with a smile. Old Huang sighed, "You consolidated the Golden Radiance Art in just one night?" "More than that," Ding Rui added with a wink, "I consumed all the spirit rice I received yesterday and converted it entirely into Golden Radiance Art True Essence!"

"That fast!" Old Huang forcibly suppressed his agitated emotions. His eyes widened, and he drew a sharp breath. "Hiss... you truly have extraordinary talent in the Golden Radiance Art! I must tell Senior Brother and the others about this!" Saying this, Old Huang stood up and was about to rush to the dormitories. Ding Rui didn't stop him. He simply sat down by the edge of the spirit field and began his first task of pest removal. The growth of spirit rice was closely linked to the Five Elements basic cultivation arts: the Raindrop Art for summoning rain, the Golden Radiance Art for pest control, the Condensing Yang Art for promoting photosynthesis, the Earth Qi Art, naturally, for tilling and turning the soil, and the Verdant Wood Art for weeding.
