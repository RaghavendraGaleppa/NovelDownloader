# Chapter 91: Conditions for Becoming a Dao Child

The events at the Hell Refinement Field concluded, and Yang Ji returned to the sect via the teleportation array. He had never imagined that Fu Dongliu was actually the Sect Master of the Heavenly Nether Demonic Sect. Learning the Humanoid Weapon technique had nearly cost him his life. Fortunately, circumstances took a turn for the better; otherwise, the consequences would have been dire.

This trip to the Hell Refinement Field not only yielded Purple Sun Fruits, which could enhance his root bone, but also a Great Rejuvenation Pill capable of extending his lifespan by ten years. Additionally, he acquired a hundred bottles of Nascent Soul Pills. Truly, it was a stroke of destiny and good fortune.

Yang Ji stood in the sky, not immediately returning to his abode, but instead heading to the Sect's Personnel Hall. Having successfully broken through to the Nascent Soul Realm, he was now qualified to become an inner disciple, and his enjoyed benefits would likewise increase. After his identity verification passed, he would be granted an immortal mountain, and his previous elixir benefits would upgrade from First Revolution Golden Pills to Ninth Revolution Golden Pills. Matters concerning his own interests naturally could not be delayed, so he immediately hastened to the Personnel Hall.

Inside the Personnel Hall, identity verification was simple. After confirmation, Yang Ji successfully became an inner disciple and chose an unoccupied immortal mountain from a map presented by an elder.

At this moment, Yang Ji stood high in the sky, with Chong Yuan and others behind him, all gazing at the thousand-zhang-tall immortal mountain before them. Spiritual energy permeated it, with ancient pines and cypresses everywhere, and cascading waterfalls and flowing springs. Palaces stood majestically between the mountainside and the summit. The summit also featured a clear, rippling celestial pond, an endless sea of flowers, and spirit beasts soaring. Surrounding the main peak were countless straight mountains acting as guardians. Though called an immortal mountain, in reality, all mountains within a fifty-li radius were his territory.

Seeing this scene, the Buddha Child immediately leaped out excitedly, shouting, "Wahahaha, finally I don't have to stay in that tiny room! I want the palace near the celestial pond at the top; none of you are allowed to fight me for it!" As he spoke, he dashed through the air; though he called it running, it was incredibly fast, and he vanished in an instant.

"This fellow," Yang Ji chuckled, his mood greatly brightened by the Buddha Child's excitement. He turned to Chong Yuan and the others, saying, "Let's go too. Later, each of you can choose a palace to reside in."

"Many thanks, Honored Master," the others said, nodding with smiles. Having an immortal mountain and palaces to reside in was undoubtedly the best; it was far superior to the small rooms they had upon entry, practically an upgrade from commoner to emperor.

As they spoke, everyone flew towards the main peak. Yang Ji naturally settled into the main hall, while the others chose palaces according to their preferences. Not long after settling in, Yang Ji heard the chaotic cries of immortal cranes, only to find the Buddha Child chasing them wildly.

Seeing this, Yang Ji's eyelid twitched. He immediately sternly admonished, "Don't you dare eat them!"

"Honored Master, don't worry. These are our own little cranes. How could I eat them? If I were to eat any, I'd eat someone else's crane! I'm just playing with them," the Buddha Child said, his eyes glinting mischievously.

Hearing this, Yang Ji felt somewhat relieved. This fellow still had some semblance of a bottom line, but he still admonished, "Don't cause trouble. If someone discovers you've cultivated demonic arts and flays you, I won't be able to save you."

"Honored Master, in broad daylight, can you please stop scaring me?" The Buddha Child shrank his neck, evidently still a little scared.

It was good that he was afraid; Yang Ji was only afraid that he wouldn't be.

"Honored Master, I've checked, and the spirit fields on the mountain are all idle; we can plant some spirit herbs. Also, the spirit beasts need to be fed and managed, not left to roam wild. Furthermore, the mountain's sea of flowers, spirit plants, and so on also need care. How about I go to the sect and find some chore disciples to manage them?" Chong Yuan asked.

"Alright, since we have our own immortal mountain, its appearance cannot be neglected. I'll leave these matters entirely to you," Yang Ji immediately said.

"Very well, then I'll go with Wei Feng to select some clever and talented chore disciples to come and manage things." As Chong Yuan spoke, he and the refined middle-aged Wei Feng flew out of the immortal mountain and soared into the distance.

By evening, they had already brought thirty-six young male disciples and thirty-six young female disciples to the immortal mountain.

Yang Ji stood at the mountain peak at this moment, embracing the gentle breeze, his purple robe fluttering in the air as thick mist slowly drifted past him. He gradually integrated into this immortal mountain, slowly becoming an immortal within this beautiful ink-wash painting. Watching the busy crowd, a sense of warmth and relaxation suddenly arose in his heart.

What was cultivation for? It was nothing more than to become strong himself, nothing more than to provide a stable home for those around him.

"Oh, right, Honored Master, our immortal mountain doesn't have a name yet. Could you name it?" Just as he was lost in thought, the smiling young man Wei Ming suddenly spoke.

"Then let's call it Dao Peak," Yang Ji said calmly. "It signifies the Peak of Hearing the Dao, the Peak of Seeking the Dao, and the Peak of Obtaining the Dao."

"Dao Peak? What a Dao Peak! A good name." Suddenly, a laugh echoed from the horizon.

Yang Ji turned his head to look. Unbeknownst to him, a handsome and towering figure stood there. His temperament was outstanding, his demeanor extraordinary, and a warm smile graced his face. This person was Wang Tianli, one of the Ten Dao Children.

"I was unaware of Senior Brother Wang's arrival; please forgive my lack of a proper welcome." Though Yang Ji didn't know the reason for such a figure's visit, he dared not neglect him. He promptly stepped forward, bowed, and maintained due respect.

This person was at the Integration Realm, possessing great strength, and had spoken up for him in the Hell Refinement Field. Yang Ji held a rather good impression of him.

"I came uninvited; I hope Junior Brother won't take offense," Wang Tianli said with a smile.

"Senior Brother, please enter the hall and have a seat." Yang Ji turned his head and then instructed Chong Yuan, "Chong Yuan, have someone serve tea."

"No need for trouble. I came today to speak with Junior Brother about something, I wish to converse with you alone," Wang Tianli said.

"Senior Brother needs me for something?" Yang Ji's eyes flickered. He glanced at Wang Tianli and then entered the main hall with him.

Inside the main hall, the two sat facing each other.

"May I ask why Senior Brother has come?" Yang Ji asked softly.

"I won't beat around the bush. I've come this time to exchange for the Humanoid Weapon in Junior Brother's possession," Wang Tianli said with a smile.

"Senior Brother wishes to exchange for my Humanoid Weapon?" Yang Ji's expression turned solemn.

"I know this is sudden, but please don't refuse just yet. I'd like to ask you a question first," Wang Tianli said. "Does Junior Brother have any ambitions on the path of cultivation?"

Yang Ji didn't know why he would ask this. After some thought, he replied, "Junior Brother doesn't have any grand ambitions. For now, I just wish to become a True Disciple."

"What's a True Disciple? Without becoming a Dao Child, it's all for naught," Wang Tianli suddenly said sternly. "Junior Brother, do you know why, among the Dao Sect's million disciples, there are only ten Dao Children? Is it because the sect limits the number of Dao Children? No. Is it because the sect's assessment is too difficult? Not entirely. True Disciples inherit the sect's Dao laws, but Dao Children, who have 'Dao' in their title, do so because their methods directly originate from the Three Thousand Great Daos.

"There are two opportunities to dissect the origin of the Great Dao and directly behold the Three Thousand Great Daos before ascending to the Immortal Realm. These two opportunities are chances to defy the heavens and change one's fate. The first time is during the Void Refinement and Dao Comprehension stage. When your Pure Yang Primordial Spirit merges with the Undying Body of the Great Dao, you will be able to see the origin of heaven and earth, and the most primordial forms of the Three Thousand Great Daos, with extreme clarity.

"But how precious is the Great Dao? How could it be so easily observed? When you delve deep into a certain Great Dao, a Dao Tribulation will arise. The humanoid tribulation formed by the Great Dao is terrifying, almost truly invincible among peers. Only by defeating it can you continue to comprehend the origin of the Great Dao within the three days of your Dao comprehension. Every breath of those three days is extremely precious. To swiftly overcome the Dao Tribulation, your own strength needs to be sufficient, strong enough to be invincible among peers. Only by killing one Dao Tribulation can you continue to comprehend the primordial Great Dao. If you cannot kill it, then these three days of Dao comprehension will be wasted, and you will also lose your identity as a Dao Child.

"Yes, only by killing one Dao Tribulation and absorbing its Great Dao origin are you worthy of becoming a Dao Child. This is a hard requirement. If you have even greater ambitions, what then is a Dao Child? When you comprehend the Dao, all Three Thousand Origins will be presented before you. What a maddening sight that will be? Can you resist the urge to comprehend only one Great Dao? But if you comprehend two Great Daos, then two Dao Tribulations will appear simultaneously. Two peerlessly invincible humanoid Dao Tribulations will fight you; such a scene would be too intense and terrifying. I consider myself invincible among peers, yet I only managed to slay three Dao Tribulations and obtain three primordial Great Daos."

"'Only'?" Yang Ji gasped, astounded. It was his first time learning that becoming a Dao Child required such conditions; this was tantamount to battling against the heavens.

At this point, Wang Tianli smiled and said, "Junior Brother, if you wish to pass the Dao Tribulation, you will undoubtedly need an invincible physical body, an invincible primordial spirit, invincible techniques, and invincible magical treasures. The reason I was able to successfully slay three Dao Tribulations back then was largely due to the 'Three Immortals Array' in my possession, which accounted for almost thirty percent of the credit. I used my clones to deploy the Three Immortals Array, unleashing nearly three times my own strength, thereby obliterating three humanoid Dao Tribulations. Of course, my powerful Dao artifacts and techniques also played a great role. Junior Brother, if you want to slay Dao Tribulations, powerful magical treasures are indispensable. No single aspect can be weak; only then is it possible to defeat the Dao Tribulation. As for the second time one can clearly see the origin of the Great Dao, that is when breaking through to the Mahayana stage, and I am also preparing for my Mahayana Dao attestation.

"I've told Junior Brother all this, but essentially, I want to exchange the 'Three Immortals Array,' a supreme Dao-level array formation, for the Humanoid Weapon in Junior Brother's possession." Wang Tianli smiled.

"A supreme Dao-level array formation? Senior Brother, wouldn't you be at a disadvantage exchanging such a high-grade array formation with me?" Yang Ji's eyes flickered as he looked at him.

"At my level, as long as it can enhance my strength even slightly, it's not a loss," Wang Tianli smiled, "Actually, I also possess many body-refining and spirit-cultivating techniques, but the Humanoid Weapon in Junior Brother's hands holds research value for me. This is the main reason for my visit to exchange. Junior Brother, if you learn the Three Immortals Array, becoming a True Disciple should not be difficult."

Yang Ji looked at him and suddenly asked, "By the way, Senior Brother, what are the conditions for becoming a True Disciple?"

"Ah, True Disciples! It's a grand free-for-all. All sects and factions place every early-stage Soul Transformation cultivator who wishes to become a True Disciple into a massive secret realm. This realm gathers talented experts from across the entire Primeval World: Dao Sect, Demonic Sect, the Hundred Races, various sects and factions, and experts from all major races. With so many experts vying for a limited number of True Disciple spots, it's truly intensely competitive. The secret realm is full of dangers. To become a True Disciple, one needs luck, strength, and interpersonal skills. Junior Brother, you'll understand when the time comes.

"However, you just need to remember one thing: power never goes out of style. When you crush everything with absolute strength, the True Disciple spot will be yours," Wang Tianli smiled, "And the Three Immortals Array in my possession will escort you, increasing your chances of success by thirty percent. What do you think, Junior Brother? Are you willing to exchange techniques with me?"

As he spoke, he slowly took out a jade slip. Yang Ji's gaze swept over it: [Supreme Dao-level Array Formation: Three Immortals Array.]

"Deal!" Yang Ji was decisive. There was no reason not to exchange; just for the word "Supreme," it was worth it. The Three Immortals Array could enhance his strength, so what couldn't be exchanged for it?

"Haha, Junior Brother is straightforward!" Hearing this, Wang Tianli couldn't help but laugh. "Don't worry, Junior Brother, you absolutely won't lose out in this exchange."

Yang Ji nodded and immediately exchanged jade slips with him.

After Wang Tianli smiled and accepted the jade slip, he looked at Yang Ji and added, "Oh, right, Junior Brother, you only have a mediocre root bone. I forgot to tell you, the lower one's root bone quality, the more powerful the Dao Tribulation they face. There's almost no precedent of anyone with a physique below Spirit Body successfully overcoming a Dao Tribulation."

Yang Ji's expression immediately turned solemn as he asked, "Why is that?"

Wang Tianli explained, "Because the closer one is to the Great Dao, the weaker the Dao Tribulation. Dao Physiques are like this. Conversely, a mediocre root bone is not close to the Great Dao. If you wish to meddle with the origin of the Great Dao, then you, someone despised by the Great Dao, will encounter the strongest Dao Tribulation. That would be equivalent to a Mahayana cultivator directly attacking you, with absolutely no chance of victory."

"Damn it, does the Great Dao discriminate against people too?" Yang Ji was stunned.

Seeing Yang Ji's expression, Wang Tianli couldn't help but smile and said, "Junior Brother, don't be annoyed. Once your root bone quality improves to supreme grade, the Dao Tribulation you face will be much weaker. You'll still have a chance. Of course, it would be best if you could find some heaven-defying treasures to raise your root bone quality to Spirit Body or even Sacred Body aptitude."
