# Chapter 201 Reunion  

"Reporting to Elder Su, my body refinement techniques include the Vajra Protection Divine Art from the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect and a fortuitously obtained Sword Demon Secret Codex. My primary cultivation technique is the Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art!" Li Shiming answered without the slightest hesitation.  

He was no fool. From Elder Su's attitude and questioning, it was clear the elder was investigating him—likely preparing to take him on as a nominal disciple.  

Having cultivated alone without guidance thus far, Li Shiming understood that if he were to acknowledge Elder Su as his master—even as a nominal disciple—he needed to disclose his cultivation techniques. This was fundamental.  

"Vajra Protection Divine Art!" Elder Su flicked his finger lightly against Li Shiming's skin. Though he didn't use spiritual power, the force behind it was anything but light.  

A Golden Core elder's body, even without specialized body refinement techniques, was far beyond that of any Foundation Establishment body-refining cultivator, having undergone transformation by the power of heaven and earth.  

"It seems you have considerable talent in body refinement. You've nearly reached minor mastery in the Foundation Establishment stage of the Vajra Protection Divine Art despite having just broken through!" Elder Su smiled, then added thoughtfully, "Does the Sword Demon Secret Codex also have a jade slip?"  

This question unmistakably treated Li Shiming as one of his own. As a Golden Core elder of the Shu Mountain Sect, Elder Su had access to even the most precious body refinement techniques.  

Understanding this, Li Shiming retrieved the jade slip for the Sword Demon Secret Codex and handed it over.  

Without hesitation, Elder Su took the jade slip and examined it. The room fell silent for the time it takes an incense stick to burn.  

"'Sword Demon'? More like a sword cultivator who went berserk. Still, this body refinement technique is quite interesting. You're truly fortunate to have obtained third-grade metal during your Qi Refining stage," Elder Su remarked with a chuckle and a shake of his head.  

"Elder Su, are there any issues with the Sword Demon Secret Codex?" Li Shiming asked, startled. He didn't doubt Elder Su's judgment—the elder held an extremely high status in the Northern Shu Continent.  

"This 'Sword Demon' likely obtained an ancient body refinement technique and incorporated some sword cultivator concepts into it. There's no issue cultivating it up to the Golden Core stage, and it even provides an upgradable magic treasure. It's a decent body refinement technique. However, beyond Golden Core, the only useful aspect of this technique is the flying sword treasure," Elder Su explained patiently.  

Advancing from Foundation Establishment to Golden Core involved a transformation of the body by the power of heaven and earth, significantly enhancing a Golden Core cultivator's physique.  

The Sword Demon Secret Codex used third-grade metal as a foundation to improve the cultivator's constitution, which was beneficial during the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages. But by the Golden Core stage, the enhancement from third-grade metal became negligible.  

Li Shiming wasn't overly concerned about the Sword Demon Secret Codex losing effectiveness at the Golden Core stage. Having an upgradable flying sword treasure was still a boon.  

"I recall the Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art is a legacy of the Clear Heart Sect. Did you obtain it from them?" Elder Su continued.  

"Elder Su sees all!" Li Shiming nodded.  

Elder Su merely smiled at Li Shiming's flattery, his interest in the young man deepening.  

Li Shiming's innate talent was mediocre—a three-spiritual-root constitution made his chances of reaching the Golden Core stage slim. But his fortune was extraordinary.  

Consider his techniques: the Vajra Protection Divine Art was one thing—the Shu Mountain Sect had it—but Li Shiming's version was clearly the genuine transmission, distinct from the commonly circulated variants.  

The third-grade metal required for the Sword Demon Secret Codex was something Li Shiming theoretically shouldn't have had access to.  

Even if he had a Golden Core father-in-law, no Golden Core cultivator would hand over such precious and vital resources to a Qi Refining cultivator.  

It would be a tremendous waste and place Li Shiming in grave danger.  

Third-grade metal, even when fused into the body, could be extracted by Golden Core cultivators—a process that would undoubtedly kill Li Shiming.  

The only plausible explanation was that Li Shiming had encountered extraordinary fortune and obtained enough third-grade metal for cultivation.  

As for the Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art, it was one of the Clear Heart Sect's core legacies, accessible only to a select few Golden Core elders.  

Even within the Shu Mountain Sect, such a top-tier technique would be a prized heritage, requiring rigorous assessments before disciples could access it.  

Crucially, techniques like the Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art required specific innate talents to cultivate.  

Li Shiming possessed thunder-based aptitude and had fortuitously obtained the matching technique—this was destiny.  

In the cultivation world, it was often said that destiny mattered more than talent.  

This wisdom was born from the blood and tears of countless cultivators. Some toiled for decades, risking life and limb for breakthrough resources, while others stumbled upon heavenly treasures as if the world itself favored them.  

"Li Shiming, would you be willing to become my disciple?" Elder Su straightened and asked solemnly.  

"Elder Su, this disciple is willing!" Li Shiming was momentarily stunned but quickly dropped to his knees and responded loudly.  

"Still calling me 'Elder'?" Elder Su chided lightly, though his smile betrayed his satisfaction.  

"Master!" Li Shiming corrected himself.  

"You'll start as an inner sect disciple. Cultivate diligently, and you may compete for a true disciple position later," Elder Su said, helping Li Shiming up.  

Now Li Shiming understood—Elder Su was accepting him as a full disciple, not a nominal one, granting him eligibility to compete for true disciple status.  

The difference between a disciple and a nominal disciple was profound.  

A nominal disciple was merely an honorary title, receiving little guidance from the master and rarely even meeting them.  

A true disciple, however, would receive dedicated instruction, resources, magic treasures, and techniques—the best their master could provide.  

The disciple also represented their master's standing, their fates intertwined.  

"You have three senior brothers and one senior sister, all currently away. Your formal acceptance as a disciple requires preparations. I'll hold a ceremony and invite a few friends to witness it," Elder Su said with a smile.  

Having fully recovered and gained a disciple blessed with such fortune, Elder Su felt as though Li Shiming's luck had rubbed off on him.  

Moreover, the ceremony wasn't just for Li Shiming—it would also showcase Elder Su's restored condition to the sect and beyond.  

Li Shiming returned to his previous cave dwelling, where he could stay until the formal ceremony.  

With Elder Su's recovery, the Shu Mountain Sect began addressing unresolved matters, including purging members associated with Elder Ji's faction, particularly the enforcers.  

Conspiring against a Golden Core elder was tantamount to treason—a capital offense.  

None of this concerned Li Shiming. He remained in his cave, cultivating the Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art daily.  

After his discussion with Elder Su, he realized just how exalted the Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art was—one of the supreme primary cultivation techniques for spell cultivators.  

Although the technique was comprehensive, the Shu Mountain Sect lacked the corresponding Golden Core resources. Thus, Elder Su advised him to consider switching techniques.  

Since Li Shiming was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage, the cost of switching would be minimal.  

Of course, Elder Su didn't force the decision, only explaining the pros and cons.  

If Li Shiming chose to switch, Elder Su could use his contribution points to exchange for a primary legacy technique of equal caliber.  

This generous offer stemmed from the immense value of the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass Li Shiming had provided.  

At Elder Su's level, accessing a legacy technique for himself required no contribution points, but securing one for a disciple did.  

Normally, even with sufficient points, sect members couldn't exchange for such core techniques—annotated by generations of predecessors to reduce cultivation difficulty.  

Li Shiming hesitated. He understood the importance of legacy techniques, but he felt an unusual affinity with the Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art—an instinctive resonance.  

Switching techniques might not replicate this feeling.  

Moreover, even if he switched to a sect legacy technique now, he'd only receive the Foundation Establishment portion—not the complete set.  

Only upon reaching Golden Core could he request the subsequent chapters.  

This lack of control over his cultivation path unsettled him.  

Fortunately, he had time to deliberate.  

Li Shiming was indeed fortunate. Had the Clear Heart Sect not withdrawn from the Northern Shu's Ten Thousand Mountains, Golden Core sword cultivator Yun Xingyi wouldn't have carried the complete top-tier technique, which Li Shiming now benefited from.  

Ten days later, while cultivating, Li Shiming sensed someone outside his cave. He opened the entrance and was overjoyed to see the visitor.  

"Brother Xu!" Though Elder Su had informed him of Xu Chuan's survival, seeing the man in the flesh filled Li Shiming with elation.  

"Brother Li—no, Junior Brother Li—this senior brother thanks you!" Xu Chuan bowed deeply.  

That day, pursued by a four-clawed flood dragon demon, Xu Chuan had narrowly escaped with his life using a life-saving treasure but was severely injured.  

He spent over two months recovering in an underground cavern before regaining enough strength to head for the rendezvous point.  

Xu Chuan had assumed Li Shiming would have left, as keeping the promise wasn't worth risking death.  

But to his astonishment, upon arriving, he found the area ravaged by an intense battle—one that had clearly involved a Golden Core-level guardian beast.  

Li Shiming had fought a Golden Core demon for their agreement.  

Xu Chuan didn't know if Li Shiming had succeeded but lacked the strength to search further. His injuries required prolonged recovery, and without combat prowess, survival in the Ten Thousand Mountains was impossible.  

Returning to the sect, he learned of Elder Su's recovery and plans to accept Li Shiming as a disciple.  

Exhausted but grateful, Xu Chuan sought out Li Shiming immediately.  

"Senior Brother Xu, there's no need for such formality between us!" Li Shiming said warmly, helping Xu Chuan up.  

Now fellow disciples, their bond was akin to brothers.  

"Right, no thanks needed between us!" Xu Chuan laughed.  

As they chatted, they entered the cave. To Li Shiming, the Golden Core cave was luxurious, but Xu Chuan showed no envy—as if it were unremarkable.  

"Senior Brother Xu, this cave is temporary. What about post-enrollment caves? Can we choose?" Li Shiming asked curiously.  

Xu Chuan chuckled. "No choice. You'll see."  

He remembered his own reaction upon receiving his cave and wanted to witness Li Shiming's surprise.  

"Junior Brother, what kind of beast guarded the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass?" Xu Chuan steered the conversation back, curious how Li Shiming had obtained the herb from such a formidable creature.  

"I'm not well-versed in beasts. It was a giant bear skilled in fire manipulation," Li Shiming said, using spiritual power to project an image of the bear.  

"Blazing Sun Bear Demon!" Xu Chuan nearly jumped in shock. Among third-grade demonic beasts, the Blazing Sun Bear was elite.  

"Not quite a demon—more like half-step demon. A true demon would've killed me," Li Shiming said wryly.  

"What's the difference?" Xu Chuan stared at Li Shiming as if he were a monster.  

Indeed, an early Foundation Establishment cultivator like Li Shiming, even armed with talismans, would be effortlessly crushed by a half-step demon—especially one as formidable as the Blazing Sun Bear.
