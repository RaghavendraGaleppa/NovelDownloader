# Chapter 86: Li Mo: "Am I This Powerful?"

The day's combat training session had ended.

But according to the Master's words, it would continue tomorrow.

"We're still fighting tomorrow?"

Li Mo walked into the kitchen with lifeless eyes.

This life was unbearable.

"Using the power of the World Seed is indeed too much of a burden..."

"Wait, my internal Qi?"

Just as he lit the fire to start stir-frying, Li Mo noticed a change in his body.

His internal Qi was actually a few points stronger than before the fight?

But he had just taken a beating.

"Realized the benefits now?"

"Hmph, ordinary people don't even have the资格 to be beaten by me."

Shang Wu's lazy voice rang out as she returned to her casual posture, hands behind her back, leaning against the door frame.

Li Mo fell into thought.

The Domain?

It seemed the beautiful Master hadn't released her Domain for no reason.

He had been consuming Earth Vein Spiritual Milk for a long time, and the refined essence inevitably remained in his body, unable to be fully absorbed.

The Master's Domain had promoted further refinement of that essence?

Moreover, his physical body felt much more comfortable than before, and the sharp, killing intent hidden within had also been combed through.

It felt a bit like...

The image of Sun Wukong jumping into the Eight Trigrams Furnace surfaced in Li Mo's mind.

"Thank you, Master."

"I'll treat you to good wine tonight, very, very good wine."

Li Mo said sincerely.

"You do have a conscience."

The beautiful Master let out a soft snort.

The hand hidden behind her back also let go of the rolling pin.

"Eh? Where's my rolling pin? That's strange..."

Little Li was puzzled.

He was planning to make dumplings tonight.

After a busy spell, the dinner for Autumn Water Pavilion was finally served.

True to his word, Li Mo brought out the good wine he had mentioned.

Immortal's Drunkenness.

It was a feedback reward that the System had only dropped twice; among all the wine rewards, it was probably the best.

"You actually have such a good treasure!"

"I knew you were the Master's best and most obedient disciple."

Shang Wu hugged the wine jar, her delicate nose twitching. Just a couple of sniffs and she was already intoxicated.

She smiled happily:

"Tonight, I shall teach you the second great skill I excel at—drinking a thousand cups without getting drunk!"

"..."

Li Mo felt that he didn't necessarily have to learn this.

Hearing footsteps behind him, he turned his head:

"You're finally down... Are you alright?"

"I'm fine."

Ying Bing shook her head, her eyes flickering with complex emotions. Her small face was pale, almost like before she had her meridians opened, and her voice was a little hoarse.

Li Mo poured her some tea, his face thoughtful.

This was abnormal, extremely abnormal.

Ice Cube was his number one investment target; he absolutely couldn't let anything happen to her.

But if she wouldn't say anything, how could he...

Wait.

I have a cheat, why am I guessing blindly here?

Heaven's Eye, activate!

【Name: Ying Bing】
【Age: 16】
【Constitution: Taiyin Moon Phoenix Body.】
【Cultivation: Internal Qi Condensation Realm.】
【Destiny: Red (Bearing the Emperor Bone, with玄冰 as fate and Autumn Water as spirit, possessing the appearance of a Phoenix Sovereign.)】
【Evaluation: Fate is filled with tribulations, but she always turns misfortune into blessing. Currently, her feathers are not yet full. When the wind and clouds change, she will surely hang high in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, a phoenix ruling the Eight Wastes and Six Directions.】
【Recent Encounter: Encountered an existence she cannot overcome, momentarily unable to accept her defeat, leaving a flaw in her heart and causing doubt in her own martial path. The power of Taiyin has run rampant, its remnants deeply rooted throughout her body, leaving her in a weakened state.]

Li Mo: "???"

Made Ice Cube feel defeated?

Whose subordinate is this, to be so brave?

"You... are much stronger than yesterday."

Ying Bing's slightly weak voice came softly.

"Me?"

Li Mo pointed at himself, momentarily stunned.

"Mm."

"Besides your Divine Weapon, your internal Qi is also extraordinary."

---

Ying Bing sat at the stone table, her figure appearing somewhat frail.

Her heart was indeed in turmoil.

The System's requirements, the unexpected youth.

These were actually not the root cause of her state.

The most important thing was her dream last night, returning to the void.

She had begun to doubt her own path, the very thing she had insisted on.

She suspected that she was still undergoing tribulations on the path to immortality and had never truly been reborn...

She truly couldn't tell.

"...Me?"

Li Mo was at a loss for words.

The person who made Ice Cube withdraw into herself was him?

Oh, dear.

"How could that be." Li Mo subconsciously waved his hands repeatedly.

Ying Bing remained silent.

Shang Wu认真地沉吟了一番:

"My obedient disciple, you're actually quite strong."

"If I suppressed my cultivation to the same level and fought you, it would probably be a fifty-fifty draw. If it were a life-and-death battle, your chances of winning are higher, maybe seventy-thirty."

The recognition from the Qingyuan Sect's fighting queen was quite substantial.

Li Mo couldn't help but be stunned.

He had been a slacker in his past life and had long accepted his own mediocrity.

There was no other way; the internet was full of stories about twenty-four-year-olds driving Panameras and fourteen-year-olds being recommended to Tsinghua University, making him feel like an NPC just filling a spot in this world.

But...

In such a short time, his own changes seemed to be a bit too great.

So great that even he felt a bit unfamiliar with himself for a moment.

He had just been thinking.

As long as he was temporarily behind others, there was no need to doubt himself, let alone doubt life.

For a Heavenly Fate Woman like Ice Cube, this was just a little bit of wind and frost...

Thinking about it again, wasn't this just projecting his own feelings onto others?

He himself couldn't accept his sudden success in a short period of time, so he could understand Ice Cube a little. After all, she was inherently cold and proud deep down...

"This wine...啧啧."

Shang Wu's cheeks flushed. She got drunk very quickly today and started mumbling with a silly smile:

"Thinking about when I used to travel the world down the mountain, in the taverns, there were storytellers... telling strange tales and legends from the Jianghu."

"The stories were quite interesting, but they liked to exaggerate and slander."

As she said this, Shang Wu slammed her fist on the table.

Hearing this, Li Mo's eyes lit up.

Storytelling...

"Eh? My precious disciple, have you ever listened to storytelling?"

Shang Wu propped her chin with one hand, tilting her head and asking.

He had not only listened!

A mysterious smile appeared on Li Mo's lips: "I have heard quite a few, and I also know many that you definitely haven't heard."

"Talking big."

Shang Wu expressed disdain. I've read more books than you've used toilet paper.

Seeing her disbelief, Li Mo glanced at Ice Cube out of the corner of his eye and cleared his throat:

"Disbelieving? Then let me tell you one."

"Go on then."

Shang Wu egged him on.

Although Ying Bing was still lost in thought, she was a little intrigued.

The inheritance he obtained was extraordinary; perhaps it contained secret lore and ancient texts that no longer existed in the world?

*Slap—*

Li Mo slapped the table, having quite the air of a storyteller slapping the table for attention.

"The two beautiful patrons."

"My mouth is dry and my tongue is parched; I can't tell a story like this. Could I trouble you to treat me to a cup of wine?"

Little Li's performative personality wasn't a one-day thing.

Shang Wu and Ying Bing were long used to it and didn't find it strange anymore.

"Tsk tsk, you've got the vibe."

"Tell it well, and there will be a reward."

Shang Wu giggled and poured him a cup of Immortal's Drunkenness.

Li Mo took a sip and immediately felt his whole body grow warm, his mind became much sharper, and his thoughts cleared instantly.

Novels from his previous life were still different from the storytelling of this world.

But that was no problem for him.

As long as he edited and polished it.

Also, considering the audience, after all, girls liked stories with a bit of romance...

"The story I want to tell today is called 'The Return of the Female Emperor'."

Ying Bing: "?"
Shang Wu: "A bit interesting."

Li Mo's clear voice echoed:

"This story also has a short poem."

"In the Desolate Valley, the cold wind blows, the spring and autumn cicadas chirp... a young girl returns!"
