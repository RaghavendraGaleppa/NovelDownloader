# Chapter 113: Soul Artifact

In the morning, Ren Fei'er's internal injuries had improved significantly, but she still couldn't mobilize her spiritual energy. The terrifying Buddhist spiritual power had completely suppressed her energy vortex.

This clearly showed that the old monk Du Yuan hadn't intended to kill her on the spot—he had wanted to capture her alive. Otherwise, the Buddhist spiritual power wouldn't have been so gentle; it would have transformed into a violent demon-destroying force, obliterating everything inside her.

"Big brother, can you take me with you?" Ren Fei'er pleaded with Li Shiming, who had just brought breakfast.

The term "big brother" nearly made Li Shiming drop the spiritual food in his hands. He almost wanted to reply, "Should I tip you with a rocket?" This standard internet celebrity greeting was something he never expected to hear in this world.

After glancing at himself and then at Ren Fei'er, he realized he wasn't much older than her. The term wasn't inappropriate—he was just overreacting.

"Since you're almost recovered, and we're merely passing acquaintances, let's part ways here."

Li Shiming had saved Ren Fei'er's life, but he didn't want to keep her around. She seemed like a walking disaster, and he wasn't confident he could handle whatever trouble she might bring.

"I can't use my spiritual energy. It's dangerous for me to go out like this!" Ren Fei'er blinked her eyes, trying to appear pitiful and helpless.

Li Shiming could sense the Buddhist spiritual energy emanating from her body. It definitely wasn't her own—it had to be left behind by the old monk Du Yuan.

"How long until your spiritual energy recovers? I won't be staying in Nanshan Country for long," Li Shiming asked, nodding.

"I'll go back to Tianhai with you. Once we're there, I can contact my family!" Ren Fei'er couldn't hide her delight when he agreed.

Li Shiming sighed and took out a paper crane. After enlarging it, it hovered before them.

"Get on," he said, using a spiritual hand to help Ren Fei'er onto the crane.

He followed beneath the crane, casting a Lightfoot Spell on his legs before sprinting in the chosen direction.

Sitting atop the crane, Ren Fei'er watched Li Shiming run while glancing at the paper crane. She had probably never encountered a cultivator this poor before. Paper cranes were toys from her childhood, before she had even formed her spiritual roots. She never imagined someone would use one for travel.

"Big brother, if you give me that lamp from yesterday, I'll trade you a flying artifact. How about that?" she called down to him eagerly.

"Don't flaunt your valuables in public. It's not safe," Li Shiming chided with a frown.

He thought Ren Fei'er was simply inexperienced, unaware that she already knew his identity and thus had no reservations.

"One more condition—you have to call me Fei'er from now on!" Ren Fei'er's eyes sparkled mischievously as she pulled out a pair of black wings and waved them.

Li Shiming sensed the spiritual energy fluctuations of a high-grade artifact from the wings. A flying artifact of this quality was something he had never seen before.

Most cultivators preferred contracted spirit beasts for travel—a single spirit bird could carry a cultivator through the air at considerable speed. For more stability and space, the more expensive flying boats were used.

Few cultivators used flying artifacts because the number of artifacts one could control simultaneously was limited by their spiritual energy and mental strength.

At the fourth level of Qi Refining, Li Shiming could barely manage two artifacts in combat. His Spirit Turtle Shield was an exception—its formations reduced the energy and mental strain, allowing him to use it alongside his Sword Control Technique.

Of course, as his strength and cultivation improved—especially after mastering the "Ice Heart Jade Mind Technique"—he would be able to wield more artifacts simultaneously.

"Fei'er, this is a high-grade flying artifact, while that lamp is just a mundane object," Li Shiming pointed out, though he was tempted by the wings.

The black wings would pair well with his Sword Control Technique, enhancing his agility and attack precision.

"I just like the lamp. Don't worry—this Raven Sparrow Wing was a birthday gift when I was fourteen. I'm already bored with it!" Ren Fei'er tossed the wings to him.

Li Shiming sighed inwardly. Why did he keep running into cultivators with powerful backgrounds? Ren Fei'er had received a high-grade flying artifact as a birthday gift at fourteen, while he...

"This LED lamp lasts for about a hundred hours. If it stops lighting up, just leave it in sunlight—it'll recharge automatically," Li Shiming explained as he handed it to her.

"E-L-E-D? What kind of emperor is that? What a strange name!" Ren Fei'er muttered as she fiddled with the lamp.

Li Shiming didn't bother explaining the name's origin—he wasn't sure how to.

He activated the "Dragon Painting Technique" and was about to refine the wings.

"Big brother, that's not how you refine it. Just drip a drop of blood here!" Ren Fei'er corrected him.

Following her instructions, Li Shiming let a drop of blood fall onto the base of the wings. A flash of spiritual light shimmered across them.

He sensed a soul within the wings connecting with his consciousness. This soul was perfectly fused with the artifact, allowing him to control it effortlessly.

"This is a soul artifact. My mother sealed a spirit sparrow's soul inside so I could use it easily when I was only at the mid-stage of Qi Refining. The sparrow's soul powers the wings in normal flight, but you'll need to input spiritual energy for high-speed flight," Ren Fei'er explained.

Soul artifacts weren't mentioned in the Qi Refining knowledge sold in markets. They were likely a secret technique of certain sects, not common among Qi Refining cultivators.

For a moment, Li Shiming felt the wings were too valuable. Would Ren Fei'er's family think he had tricked her into giving them up?

But Ren Fei'er didn't feel cheated. She had seen her sister's pocket watch and had longed for such intricate craftsmanship. Getting it from her sister was impossible, but the LED lamp had caught her eye the night before—it was just as marvelous.

She planned to show it off to her sister, proving that the pocket watch wasn't the only exquisite mundane object in the world.

In terms of rarity, the only LED lamp in this world was far more valuable than a soul artifact. Soul artifacts could be bought or crafted by powerful cultivators, but the lamp was unique—unless Li Shiming gave away another, there would never be a second one. Moreover, the lack of foundational knowledge in this world made replication impossible.

For the first time since beginning his cultivation, Li Shiming experienced true flight. Unlike the paper crane or sword flight, the black wings allowed him to soar freely like a bird.

The speed of the Raven Sparrow Wing far exceeded what Ren Fei'er had described. Even without his own spiritual energy, it was over four times faster than the paper crane, only slightly slower than sword flight.

The wings could sustain flight indefinitely—the spirit sparrow's soul consumed minimal energy, and the artifact's materials naturally enhanced flight.

The wings could be summoned or retracted at will, folding discreetly against his back like ordinary adornments.

With the wings, their travel speed matched the paper crane's maximum.

During the day, the LED lamp's glow was less striking, so Ren Fei'er turned her attention to Li Shiming, pestering him with questions.

Feeling indebted, Li Shiming indulged her, engaging in small talk. Eventually, he resorted to telling her stories while flying, which finally quieted her.

By afternoon, they reached the capital of Nanshan Country. Li Shiming cast an Invisibility Spell on them—useless against other cultivators but perfect for moving unnoticed in the mortal world.

"Stay close and don't speak," he warned, uneasy about Ren Fei'er's identity. If the old monk had called her a "little demoness," she likely came from a demonic sect.

Only his inexplicable familiarity with her and concern for her injuries had compelled him to bring her along.

"Mm," Ren Fei'er nodded obediently, knowing when to behave.

As they approached the imperial palace, Li Shiming's eyes gleamed. With IBMz15's calculations, countless spiritual energy pathways unfolded before him.

"Follow me," he said, analyzing the formation without pause.

Ren Fei'er knew mortal palaces were protected by formations—a standard practice by sects to shield rulers from rogue cultivators. While not overly powerful, they were enough to deter most.

Yet Li Shiming bypassed it effortlessly, entering the palace undetected.

He flew toward the most heavily guarded building—the emperor's quarters—then glanced at another area where the sect's stationed cultivator resided. The spiritual energy there was a beacon in the mortal realm.

The Han family's incomplete control over Nanshan Country was partly due to this stationed cultivator. Even Han Tianlei, a law-enforcement cultivator, couldn't easily pressure a retiree backed by imperial connections.

Li Shiming landed at the palace entrance, stepping inside unseen by the guards.

Facing the middle-aged emperor in golden robes, Li Shiming felt no awe. Cultivation was about freedom—unbound by worldly hierarchies.

A knot in his heart loosened. His past self's innate fear of royalty dissolved, elevating his temperament.

"Li Shiming of the Tianhai Sect greets Your Majesty," he announced, his voice contained within the hall by manipulated formation lines.

The emperor started, his brush leaving an ink blot. Yet he remained composed, rising to bow respectfully. "Immortal Master, what brings you here?"

"Wait a moment—I'll summon the stationed disciple," Li Shiming said, plucking a formation line.

The stationed cultivator, an elderly man, sensed the message and hurried over, shocked by the display of formation mastery.

"Greetings, Junior Brother," the old cultivator bowed, noting but not acknowledging the invisible Ren Fei'er.

"Senior Brother, I wish to discuss a matter concerning the Han family of Nanshan Country," Li Shiming said gravely.

The emperor and stationed cultivator tensed, unsure of his intent.

Then Li Shiming acted—he produced ten corpses, lining them up in the hall.

Both men had seen death, but the identities of these bodies stunned them.

"I accepted a mission to treat spiritual plants in Nanshan Country. These men ambushed me at Changshi Valley. Here they are," Li Shiming explained coolly.

The stationed cultivator checked Li Shiming's cultivation—fourth level of Qi Refining. The disparity was staggering.
