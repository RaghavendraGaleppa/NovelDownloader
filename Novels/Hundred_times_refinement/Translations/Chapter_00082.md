# Chapter 32: The Heavenly Edicts of Cultivation  

"Disband?" Lin Xuan was taken aback. "Would that really avert disaster? Would that Core Formation senior really stop his killing spree just like that?"  

"Of course," Li Hai replied with a puzzled expression. "Has Senior Brother never heard of the Heavenly Edicts of the cultivation world?"  

"Heavenly Edicts?" Lin Xuan shook his head, feigning ignorance. "This junior has little interest in reading and has never heard our elders mention them. I’d appreciate Senior Brother’s guidance."  

This was, of course, a lie. Lin Xuan frequented the library, but only to study materials beneficial to his cultivation. As for the Heavenly Edicts of the cultivation world, this was indeed his first time hearing of them.  

Playing the fool was one of Lin Xuan’s specialties, and Li Hai didn’t suspect a thing. The man loved to talk, and having a senior brother of higher cultivation seeking his advice flattered him. He immediately launched into an enthusiastic explanation.  

The brutality of the cultivation world was well-known. Though Lin Xuan hadn’t ventured out much in the years since joining the valley, he had heard plenty through hearsay. While the mortal world had laws, the cultivation world had few rules—might made right, and power dictated truth. Disputes were settled by force.  

Quarrels leading to death, or the innocent being killed for their treasures—such things happened daily. Strictly speaking, there was no true distinction between righteousness and evil. Cultivators acted based on their strength and whims.  

Yet nothing was absolute. Despite the constant bloodshed, the cultivation world still had some restraints—the so-called Heavenly Edicts Li Hai had mentioned.  

The edicts stated:  

When conflicts arose between sects or between sects and rogue cultivators, no matter how deep the enmity, if one side surrendered and willingly abolished their cultivation—for rogue cultivators, this meant self-destruction of their power; for sects, every member had to do the same, and the sect itself had to disband—then the opposing side, no matter how great their hatred, was forbidden from further retaliation.  

Violating this rule would make the offender an enemy of the entire cultivation world, hunted down until their soul scattered.  

This was an ironclad law, unbroken for tens of thousands of years.  

For mortals, nothing was worse than death. But for cultivators, losing their power and becoming ordinary was a fate worse than death—an irreversible choice. Once cultivation was abolished, there was no hope of regaining it. The victorious side need not fear future revenge.  

The origins of these Heavenly Edicts were lost to time, but no one had ever dared defy them. For 99% of cultivators and sects, having ascended to the status of "immortal masters," returning to mortality was unthinkable. Most would rather die than surrender.

### The Treasure Exchange  

"So even though the Lingyun Sect was just a minor fourth- or fifth-rate sect, news of its disbandment caused a stir," Li Hai continued. "Especially among cultivators within several thousand miles—everyone is rushing to attend the treasure exchange."  

"Treasure exchange?" Lin Xuan’s interest was piqued. Was this the event where mid-tier Foundation Establishment cultivation techniques were being sold? Though eager for details, he kept his expression neutral. "What’s this treasure exchange? Please enlighten me, Junior Brother."  

After just a short interaction, Lin Xuan had already discerned Li Hai’s personality—the man couldn’t keep secrets. A simple prompt would make him spill everything.  

As expected, Li Hai grew more animated, while Chen Feng, the other disciple, struggled to get a word in. Watching the two compete to share information, Lin Xuan suppressed a laugh and listened calmly.  

The treasure exchange was simple. Since the Lingyun Sect had disbanded and its members had abolished their cultivation, their sect’s techniques, spirit stones, artifacts, talismans, and other treasures were now useless to them—all would be sold off.  

Unlike normal transactions where spirit stones served as currency, this special exchange only accepted medicinal pills. The reason was obvious: spirit stones were worthless to mortals, but pills were different. Cultivators’ elixirs not only enhanced cultivation—they could also strengthen the body, cure illnesses, and prolong life for ordinary people.  

Having chosen to live as mortals, the former Lingyun Sect members naturally wished for long, healthy lives. By trading their treasures for pills, they could ensure prosperity for themselves and their descendants.  

As for the risk of being targeted without cultivation but possessing valuable pills—there was no need to worry. The Heavenly Edicts also protected them. While killing and plundering were commonplace among cultivators, stealing from those who had willingly become mortals was forbidden. Violators would be hunted down as enemies of the entire cultivation world.  

Though weak, the Lingyun Sect had existed for over a thousand years. Its accumulated wealth included techniques, spirit stones, talismans, materials, and even precious artifacts.  

In regions with many sects and flourishing cultivators, there were dedicated markets for trading goods. But in Zhao State’s Yanzhou, where the Drifting Clouds Valley was located—spanning thousands of miles with only a few minor sects and sparse rogue cultivators—no such markets existed.  

Thus, the Lingyun Sect’s disbandment and treasure exchange became a rare opportunity. It attracted nearby cultivators, offering them a chance not only to acquire the sect’s treasures but also to trade among themselves. The event promised to be lively.

### The Perfect Opportunity  

Having gathered all the information, Lin Xuan was delighted. He had searched high and low, yet the solution had come effortlessly. At such an exchange, he was certain to find the *Spirit Control Technique* he needed.  

"Junior Brother, when and where will this exchange take place?" he asked.  

"What? Does Senior Brother plan to buy something?" Li Hai eyed Lin Xuan curiously. Though this "Senior Brother Zhao" had impressive cultivation for his age, as a mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator, he shouldn’t have much to trade.  

"Of course not," Lin Xuan replied smoothly, careful not to reveal his intentions. "How could this foolish brother have anything to trade? At most, I’d just be envious. I’m merely curious and wanted to ask."  

The explanation was reasonable, and Lin Xuan’s flawless acting convinced Li Hai and Chen Feng. They readily answered his questions without suspicion.
