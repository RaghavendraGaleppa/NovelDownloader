# Chapter 423: The Foundation Establishment Divine Power, The Battle Divine Power

The struggle for the Void Mountain Netherworld finally came to an end.

As the lingering resonance of True Monarch Chunyang’s nine golden suns and Bodhisattva Miaodian’s Brahman Lotus shadow still flowed through the air, True Monarch Qingyuan’s true body had already quietly departed.

With a light sweep of his sleeve, this True Monarch of the Primordial Origin Sect sent an invisible aura spanning a thousand miles. Like a Giant Spirit’s palm, it uprooted the entire Void Mountain Netherworld.

As the mountain trembled, the spiritual veins were forcibly severed. The entire netherworld transformed into a palm-sized jade carving model, falling into the pocket dimension within True Monarch Qingyuan’s sleeve.

Xu Yunfan stood amidst the sea of clouds, witnessing with his own eyes True Monarch Qingyuan’s heaven-shocking feat of seizing the Void Mountain from afar. His heart was filled with awe.

The methods of a True Monarch were truly unimaginable.

“The Pocket Universe...”

Beside him, True Lord Baiyue’s voice was filled with emotion. This usually arrogant elder of the Primordial Origin Sect was actually somewhat uncomposed. “Back when I read the records of the ‘Form Seizing Method of the Ten Thousand Luo Caves’ in the Scripture Pavilion, I thought the ancients were exaggerating.”

“Is this a Divine Power?” Xu Yunfan asked.

True Lord Baiyue slightly nodded. “The methods of a True Monarch are unfathomable.”

Xu Yunfan subconsciously glanced at the information floating in his vision.

*‘You have successfully established your Foundation.’*

*‘You have forged the Foundation of the Great Dao. You have acquired a Innate Divine Power: Battle.’*

“Battle...”

Xu Yunfan’s consciousness sank into his spiritual platform, feeling the new power within him.

The Battle Rune.

This was the Innate Divine Power bestowed by Heaven and Earth after forging the Divine Martial Dao Foundation with the *True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture*. It was a power of slaughter born purely for combat.

He slightly spread his five fingers, a wisp of true energy flowing in his palm. In an instant, it transformed into a sharp sword qi, then condensed into a heavy vital essence in the next, changing at will as if it were an extension of his arm.

The spiritual power surged like a river within his body, yet without the slightest obstruction. Every wisp of true energy was as precise as if it were an extension of his will.

He gently clenched his fist, and the air exploded. The explosive force from his fingertips left several sharp auras lingering in the void for a long time.

“So that’s how it is...”

A sharp light flashed in Xu Yunfan’s eyes.

The Battle Rune was not a simple power boost, but the ultimate control over spiritual power.

With a mere movement of his hand and foot, true energy could transform into a sword, condense into a shield, or form a formation. Even in a single thought, he could compress all the spiritual power in his body to a single point, unleashing a power of slaughter that far exceeded his current realm.

His heart moved, and the true energy in his body suddenly boiled. A faint玄金 (mysterious gold) halo appeared around him, as if a War God had descended upon the world.

“Boom!”

He threw a punch, and the void trembled. Where the fist wind passed, the sea of clouds churned, forcibly tearing open a hundred-zhang-long vacuum zone.

The Battle Rune, nurturing battle through battle, grows stronger the more it fights!

It was a perfect match for the True Martial Devouring Demon Great Millstone.

True Lord Baiyue watched with a smile as Xu Yunfan stirred his own spiritual power, but he did not see the profound mystery in how Xu Yunfan manipulated it.

Such is life!

True Lord Baiyue sighed inwardly. When he had established his foundation, he had specifically found a place to test his strength thoroughly.

“How is it, Daoist Xu?”

Hearing True Lord Baiyue’s words, Xu Yunfan suppressed the excitement in his heart and lowered his hand, a hint of embarrassment on his face.

“I’ve made a fool of myself. I simply couldn’t resist the itch to try it out.”

“It’s normal,” True Lord Baiyue said understandingly. “When I established my foundation, I spent half a year adapting to it. We have a long road ahead.”

He turned to look at the empty space where the Void Mountain once stood.

“The path of immortality has only just begun.”

True Lord Baiyue was filled with emotion. “The road is long and arduous. We of this generation must spare no effort to make progress. Junior Brother, you must maintain your state of mind in the days to come.”

Hearing True Lord Baiyue’s advice, Xu Yunfan understood that the other party was warning him against arrogance and impatience. Furthermore, hearing the change in address, Xu Yunfan naturally followed suit.

“Senior Brother is right.”

Hearing Xu Yunfan’s understanding, True Lord Baiyue smiled.

“You must know that the Golden Core has nine revolutions, and each step is a different heaven. Every step forward is a world of difference.”

True Lord Baiyue suddenly formed a seal and summoned a water mirror, in which reflected the shrinking phantom of the Void Mountain. “Look at the place where the mountain body was stripped away...”

Xu Yunfan focused his gaze. What appeared in the mirror was not the image of earth and rock crumbling, but countless crystalline threads being forcibly torn apart from the earth veins.

Each time a thread broke, a profound and clear qi flashed and vanished.

“Plucking the mountain as if picking a flower, severing the veins as if undressing.”

Xu Yunfan was filled with astonishment. Having just entered the door of the Dao of Formations, he naturally understood the key points. With his current strength, to achieve such a feat, he would need to set up a large formation and adjust the nodes to have a fraction of that power.

“The methods of a True Monarch are truly enviable.”

True Lord Baiyue put away the water mirror and a green jade talisman flew out from his sleeve. “Since Junior Brother has witnessed the True Monarch’s Divine Power, why not return to the sect with me to handle the matter of opening a peak?”

Xu Yunfan naturally would not refuse. Once he established a peak, he could do many things.

He looked at the spiritual energy vortex lingering on the horizon and suddenly smiled. “Senior Brother just said that the nine revolutions of the Golden Core are like ascending to heaven. I wonder, as a newly promoted Foundation Establishment cultivator, when can I go to the Scripture Pavilion to borrow the ‘Form Seizing Method of the Ten Thousand Luo Caves’ to broaden my horizons?”

True Lord Baiyue laughed heartily upon hearing this, the jade pendant on his waist tinkling with his laughter. “Rest assured, Junior Brother. Once you establish your foundation, our Sacred Sect still has some benefits!”

He formed a seal and summoned a green cloud. “However, since you have opened the True Martial Peak, according to sect rules, you can choose three volumes of Foundation Establishment true cultivation techniques. Follow me.”

As the two rode the clouds through the protective mountain array, Xu Yunfan noticed the awed gazes of the disciples guarding the mountain. Those usually arrogant inner disciples all bowed in respect, and one disciple from Baiyue Peak was so nervous he crushed the jade slip in his hand.

“Did you see that?” True Lord Baiyue transmitted his voice. “You are now a figure capable of opening a peak and transmitting the Dao. These little fellows are naturally trembling with fear.”

Xu Yunfan naturally understood that within the Primordial Origin Sect, Qi Condensation disciples were mostly expendable materials. If a Foundation Establishment cultivator had the mind to do so, as long as they kept it within a certain limit, they could refine as many as they wanted.

After handing over the documents at the Hall of Affairs, True Lord Baiyue was hurriedly summoned away by a message talisman.

When Xu Yunfan walked out of the hall alone, twilight had already enveloped the peaks. He stood on the white jade steps and took a deep breath. The peak-opening order in his chest, drawn by the Primordial Origin Sect’s earth veins, suddenly emitted a clear tremor.

Xu Yunfan stood outside the gates of the Primordial Origin Sect. The cloud patterns on the peak-opening order in his hand suddenly emitted a green light.

He looked up at the horizon. The token resonated with the aura of a netherworld, emitting a clear chime, as if guiding him somewhere.

Following the感应 (sensing), he arrived at the southeast corner of the sect, where three earth veins converged.

Xu Yunfan looked at it and was naturally delighted.

“A good place.”

He saw a nine-bend spiritual stream encircling a pool. The spring water gushing from the center of the pool actually condensed into a mist in the shape of a green lotus in mid-air. On the shore, an ancient pine’s branches were gnarled, and the tips of its needles continuously dripped golden spiritual dew, which turned into firefly-like spirits upon hitting the ground and scattered away.

Even more wondrous was the soil. Xu Yunfan bent down and grabbed a handful, discovering it was mixed with crystalline star sand. This was the earth and wood qi recorded in the *Introduction to the Dao of Formations*, most suitable for nurturing the foundation of a spiritual vein.

“It’s this place.”

He pointed his fingers like a sword, and spiritual power flowed from his fingertips, carving the True Martial Subduing Demon Seal at the bottom of the peak-opening order.
