**Chapter 140: The Edge of the World**

Within a single day, they traversed forty thousand li, crossing boundless, pitch-black territories. Two high-tier aberrants carried the group, bringing them to the lands at the world's edge. Even though everyone possessed strong physiques and had undergone multiple regenerations, some of the younger individuals still felt unwell, their faces pale. Only when their feet touched solid ground did they feel secure.

"Why aren't we going straight into the city?" someone asked.

This was a wilderness, the night deep. Many ancient trees grew here, their gnarled branches sprawling everywhere. Faint light pierced through the distance, indicating a city.

"Now that we're here, I'll give you a lesson," the elder from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court spoke.

His name was Zhou Tao. His temples were streaked with white, and golden light flowed in his pupils. He said, "When approaching the world's edge, you cannot enter the city directly from the night sky. That would be seen as a hostile attack, and even high-tier aberrants would be shot down by special crossbow bolts!"

Afterward, everyone understood what kind of place this was: the frontier from the last Great Genesis Era! Of course, with the passage of eras, exploration had long ceased. This place no longer held the bustling scene of its former glory, when it was teeming with people and masters.

Qin Ming was somewhat lost in thought. Traveling forty thousand li in a single day and arriving at a place like this was beyond his expectations. He had thought the Great Genesis Era was still far away, but he hadn't expected to arrive at such a place ahead of schedule.

The group whispered and discussed as they walked towards the city in the night. The city wasn't very large. Its walls appeared ancient and weathered. On the iron-hard black-gold stone surfaces, some damaged areas revealed terrifying claw marks, several meters long. This caused many people's expressions to change. One could imagine the thrilling scenes from the bygone great era, a past of blood and fire seemingly rushing forth.

Zhou Tao seemed to know what they were thinking and smiled faintly. "These are just trifles, left behind by some small cats and mice in recent years."

"Ah, has the great exploration of this era already begun?" someone couldn't help but ask.

"Not yet," a young disciple shook his head. Then he added, "Do you think this place is usually peaceful?"

After their identities were verified, the group successfully entered the city. Along the way, they gained a general understanding. The frontier region of the great exploration spanned a very long boundary, and this place was merely a small corner of it. Precisely because of this, along the extremely long world's edge, various creatures frequently intruded, harassing the border residents, making it impossible to guard against them all. The situation was worsening, with serious bloodshed occurring frequently. Therefore, the higher-ups were somewhat exasperated and wanted to initiate another great exploration. As for now, various preparations were still proceeding in an orderly manner.

"You are born in an era full of challenges. Once the Great Genesis arrives, and we advance into the vast, boundless depths of the Night Mist World, countless opportunities will emerge. Resources and good fortune will be innumerable. You will witness legends, and some people will rise rapidly. The appearance of near-immortals and god-like beings is not impossible."

"Each great exploration sees new talents rise, like blazing suns streaking across the sky, illuminating the Night Mist World, capable of standing on equal footing with the elder generation's magnates."

"Perhaps among you, there will be pioneering young Grandmaster-level figures!"

With just a few simple sentences, Zhou Tao and the young disciples from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court sketched out a vague outline of a grand era. The group of youths felt their spirits soar, their blood surging with excitement. Yet, a portion of them remained calm, their young hearts not stirring with agitation, for they knew that in such a brilliant great era, many were also destined to die.

This was a county town, possessing a cluster of third-tier fire springs, with a population just over a hundred thousand. Qin Ming and the others now understood what kind of assessment they were about to undergo, and which demons, monsters, and ghosts they needed to resolve!

"After the last great exploration, some populations migrated here. In the early days, it was indeed prosperous, as resources were abundant and the land vast with sparse population. But now, it suffers greatly. Various monsters continuously cross the border, causing endless harassment. Bloody incidents are increasing, and there have even been horrific massacres of villages and towns."

The group had long understood what Zhou Tao meant by not wanting internal strife. Coming to the world's edge to hunt and help resolve border issues was a better approach.

"You can form teams or act alone. Whoever slays the most powerful ferocious monsters and eliminates the most demons will receive a higher evaluation."

Immediately, some discussed forming teams, while others remained silent, intending to be lone wolves. Zhou Tao spoke sternly, "I will divide the areas according to your strength. Before you each set out, read the provided materials carefully, and act within your capabilities." He solemnly warned that it was still not too late to withdraw now. Otherwise, deaths were certain. Youngsters who had never experienced life-or-death combat should not participate, as newcomers were most prone to accidents.

A stack of papers appeared in everyone's hands. These were reports on the surrounding areas. Judging by the dates, some were from a long time ago, while others were recent, all documenting bloody incidents reported by local residents.

"As for the information on colossal beasts and even more formidable demons and monsters, we won't give you those. Sending you to such places would only be suicide."

Zhou Tao told them that danger also came with opportunity. Some special creatures possessed rich spiritual substances. For instance, the silver blood remaining within evolution-failed silver-tier creatures was astonishingly valuable. This also meant they were extremely dangerous. Furthermore, some aberrant creatures possessed jade horns, spirit bones, and other parts that could be used in medicine or as excellent materials for refining spirit artifacts. These were extremely precious, so they shouldn't be missed.

Some of the youths, filled with a strong sense of justice, spoke up and asked, "Elder Zhou, since the border residents have suffered greatly in recent years, why don't you just sweep through and resolve it? After all, our cultivation is still low; how much can we really accomplish?"

Zhou Tao replied, "Who says people of our cultivation level aren't doing anything? Where do you think the spirit meat we eat daily comes from? If we don't personally take action, we'd deplete our resources and eventually fall into poverty, even as elders." A young disciple explained that the frontier line left by the last great exploration was simply too vast. The area they were currently in, including the surrounding cities, was merely a small section of it. Consequently, the pile of dossiers and bloody incident reports had grown very thick. The various paths and sects simply didn't have enough manpower. Most crucially, those crossing the border were mostly small, slippery fry, while the true masters were focused on the deeper parts of the Night Mist World.

"That's why the higher-ups have been thinking of expanding in recent years. They want to directly flip the table and launch a fierce, powerful offensive. However, the unknown regions were boundless. Even the grandmasters of the various paths had no confidence, unsure of what lay ahead. Previous great explorations had been relatively smooth, yielding immense benefits. But who could say what the future held? What if they encountered a divine kingdom or a demon king's court? That would be a huge problem, destined to be quite brutal."

The group of youths studied the dossiers. The bloody and tragic incidents documented were numerous, some truly horrifying and stifling to the chest.

In a quiet room, Zhou Tao instructed several disciples to allocate territories to the group of youths based on their strength. He warned, "Everything must follow the rules. Do not overstep your bounds, and do not cross the red line. Do you understand?" The young men nodded, indicating their understanding. Zhou Tao said, "The talented individuals will likely become our core disciples. They need to be properly tempered. I will personally arrange things to give them some pressure; otherwise, they might think the assessment of my Six Imperial Ancestral Court is a child's game."

Having said that, he took the profiles of the young talented individuals and read through them carefully.

"You will rest here for the night. Tomorrow, each of you will set out to resolve these bloody incidents. This counts as defending the territory and quelling unrest. If you believe yourselves capable, then undertake a minor exploration. This will be fairly reflected in your evaluation!" Zhou Tao warned them strictly against internal strife. Anyone who dared to attack a fellow participant would have their assessment qualification revoked, and might even be executed.

"If someone secretly attacks me first, can I retaliate? Will that count as mutual internal strife?" someone quietly asked.

"Not retaliate to this? Your bloodlust would be completely dulled! It's merely self-defense." Zhou Tao said, then took out some scripture papers and distributed them. He added, "This is a very profound secret technique called Bright Light Qi. It's perfectly suited for tempering yourselves when slaying monsters, consider it a gift. Those who perform exceptionally, even if this is just their initial assessment, will be permitted to enter the Six Imperial Enlightenment Ground to comprehend a more powerful cultivation method upon their return."

The next day, the group of youths set out!

Qin Ming was a lone wolf and did not team up with anyone. The territory assigned to him was nearly a hundred li away from the county town. Following the map and road signs, he swiftly traveled through the night. "Seventh Regeneration, and minor exploration, here I come!" He truly wanted to see the original appearance of the unexplored world. But he quickly calmed down, reminding himself to be cautious and not careless, to avoid capsizing during the assessment. He set out early and was extremely fast. He was already close to his destination before dawn truly arrived.

In Luojia Village, cooking smoke curled up. The villagers had just begun preparing breakfast. This place was relatively bright. A village of a few hundred people actually had a second-tier fire spring. Indeed, the land was vast, the population sparse, and resources abundant. Outside the village, vast fire fields were full of vitality. Irrigated by the glowing red fire springs, the crops were growing exceptionally well. Further beyond lay dense forests. In this region, the area governed by several cities, tall mountains were rarely seen. It was a vast plain, either fire fields or dense woodlands.

The tranquil morning was quickly disturbed by sounds of weeping. Some villagers were nervous and afraid, tightly closing their doors. A woman was crying, "Sir, you... you're here again. We've already lost one child. Please, don't harm them again. Why don't you choose one of us, my husband or me?"

Qin Ming immediately rushed over silently. Through an open courtyard gate, he saw an upright-walking green wolf, standing two meters tall. It wore a scholar's robe, its bloody maw stretched in a grin. It could even speak human language, saying, "Breakfast should be good. I think your child tastes rather nice, so I came again today." Before it, a couple knelt, begging and willing to die in their children's stead. Behind them were two terrified children, less than ten years old, staring with wide eyes. Just yesterday, they had lost their older brother. Today, it was their turn.

"Beast!" Qin Ming had never imagined that one of the bloody incidents would be so heinous and tragic. What did this green wolf think this place was? It regarded a villager's child as breakfast; this was its second time here! While other bloody incidents were also excessive, none had enraged him as much as what happened to this family. His eyes felt as if they could shoot flames. In the past, he had always been calm, but now, his hair bristled with rage, and he simply couldn't endure it.

Qin Ming charged into the courtyard, his gaze coldly fixed on the strange great green wolf, his killing intent undisguised.

"Hm?" The great green wolf was very alert, immediately retreating. If it could kill, it would naturally do so, but if not, it was also preparing an escape route. It grinned, revealing its snowy fangs, and said, "Brother, I know you have a mission. How about we both take a step back? I'll leave now. I am a subordinate of the Silver Wolf King."

"Who are you calling brother?!" Qin Ming attacked, Bright Sky Qi flowing over his body. His left fist and right palm simultaneously burst forth with dazzling light. The green wolf was very fast, but it was still cornered, forced to retaliate. Its large paws swiped, producing whooshing sounds, and its entire massive wolf head darted forward, attempting to bite. The upright green wolf shrieked. Its left paw exploded, then its other forelimb was ripped off by Qin Ming, blood splattering. At the same time, with a loud bang, half its head shattered.

"A creature that mutated six times," Qin Ming assessed, his anger subsiding slightly. Behind him, the entire family was stunned with fear, then overjoyed, for they knew their two children would not be eaten. The family thanked him profusely, wanting to kowtow to Qin Ming, but he quickly stopped them. Qin Ming saw that after their joy, the family still showed signs of worry.

Soon, the village chief of Luojia Village arrived, both excited and worried. It was good that someone had dealt with the menacing great green wolf, but there was a Wolf Ridge in the dense forest, with at least six more vicious wolves. Qin Ming questioned them thoroughly about the situation, then immediately set off towards the so-called Wolf Ridge. In the dense forests on the great plains, if a mountain appeared, it would most likely be occupied as a lair by some creature.

Less than half an hour later, Qin Ming found his destination and ascended the ridge.

"Who goes there?"

"Friend, we are subordinates of the Silver Wolf King. What business do you have? We can sit down and talk." A white wolf and a grey wolf spoke in succession. They actually both understood human speech. These wolf demons were very wary, sensing ill intent. A youth who dared to appear here alone was likely not to be trifled with.

"Have you eaten people in those villages and towns?" Qin Ming asked.

"Misunderstanding, we occasionally get blood on our paws, but we are very restrained..." the grey wolf began.

With a *clang*, Qin Ming could no longer listen. He decisively drew his blade, which shone with dazzling light. With a single slash, he lopped off a massive wolf head.

"You dare attack the Silver Wolf King's subordinates?!" The other vicious wolves blustered fiercely but were inwardly timid. However, after a slight hesitation, they still lunged at him together. Instantly, blade light glittered, and blood splattered across Wolf Ridge. Several vicious wolves were either beheaded or cleaved into two.

Qin Ming descended the mountain with a few wolf fangs and walked back the way he came.

"A human blade user, coming to hunt on our territory?" In the dense forest, a half-human-tall weasel, carrying a blade on its back, blocked his path. Its eyes flowed with purple light, and faint lightning actually coiled around its body.
