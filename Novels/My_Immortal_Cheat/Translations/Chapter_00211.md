**Chapter 211: Arrivals from the Abyss Tomb**

"Why are there so many people?"

Zhou Tian was shocked the moment he emerged from the portal. They were still in the same spot where they entered, near the First Mountain, but now the Void Star Ring was crowded with many more individuals.

Most prominent were the three figures in the west. Each seemed like a god or demon returned from primordial antiquity, their pressure like a vast ocean, engulfing the area. Divine radiance filled their surroundings like blazing suns, allowing only their blurred silhouettes to be seen. These individuals were terrifying. Each stood in their own domain, as if existing in the age of creation itself. Their bodies surged with energy, their auras vast and boundless, their true forms manifest, causing the very heavens and earth to crack and threaten to shatter!

"Who are these people?" Zhou Tian asked the Distinguished Figure of Border Prison beside him.

"They are from the Abyss Tomb," the Grand Figure replied, his eyes deep, lost in thought.

Abyss Tomb? Zhou Tian's heart skipped a beat. He thought of Yuan Chi. Were these people here for revenge?

"Is it just you lot? Are there others inside?" one of the Abyss Tomb beings questioned coldly, devoid of emotion. He stood upon the divine ring near the First Mountain, his divine might boundless! As his hair fluttered, the void itself was torn. In his hand, he held a silver disk, shimmering with runic light, as if searching for something.

"What could have prompted such a huge movement from the Abyss Tomb?" someone on the Void Star Ring asked. He had been cultivating in the First Mountain but sensed a colossal power descending from outside, prompting him to emerge and investigate.

"Unclear, but it must be a major event. Let's observe for now," another replied, equally uncertain.

"Do you know who you're talking to?" The Distinguished Figure of Border Prison was now serious. He held the Tome of Burials, standing at the edge of the void, confronting them from afar. His demeanor was utterly different from when he was with Zhou Tian and the others. Now, he was awe-inspiring without needing to rage, like a great demon venerate lord descended upon the world. Flames of energy surged around him, and behind where he stood, a sea of blood churned, suppressing all creation!

"I asked you, are there still people inside?!" the Abyss Tomb being roared fiercely.

*Boom!*

Heaven crumbled and Earth split, ghosts wailed and gods howled. The entire void shook, and countless symbols of order lit up, imprinted upon the void, resonating together. This terrifying phenomenon shocked the world! Then, for a split second, the world plunged into darkness. Nothing could be seen. The sun and moon seemed to have extinguished, and all the stars in the heavens appeared to have fallen.

"I asked you, do you know who you're talking to?!" The Distinguished Figure of Border Prison seemed to have lost his temper as well. No one had ever dared to disregard him like this. Abnormal phenomena appeared in the void, as if bloody light soared into the sky, tearing open the firmament. A vast crimson light pierced through the heavens and earth, staining the very starry sky red.

Huh? They just started fighting? Zhou Tian was baffled. How did they get into a fight without a word? These Abyss Tomb people were most likely here because of Yuan Chi's death, but the Border Prison Grand Figure was just too bold, truly awesome!

Zhou Tian gave him a mental thumbs-up and subtly moved closer to him.

"Hmph!" the Abyss Tomb being snorted coldly. The void boomed violently, and infinite Grand Dao runes bloomed, like countless stars in the universe emerging and aligning, densely packed, causing the heavens and earth to tremble and emit a grand, harmonizing Daoic sound. The starry sky itself dimmed, quivering incessantly. Then, darkness descended there again, as if a supreme, boundless being had stretched out a withered hand, grabbing towards Zhou Tian and the others.

"Good, very good." The sea of blood behind the Border Prison Grand Figure surged, and a gaping bloody maw opened, colossal and more terrifying than a black hole, as if it intended to devour the entire cosmic starry sky, swallowing all the starlight.

With a *rumble*, the boundless sea of blood transformed into chains, and the gaping maw swallowed and spat out cosmic stars, forcing the Abyss Tomb being back.

"Who exactly are you?" The Abyss Tomb being's expression changed. He hadn't expected the person before him to be so powerful, almost evenly matched with him.

"Who am I?" The Distinguished Figure of Border Prison's gaze was profound, as if he were questioning himself.

Just then, *rumble, rumble!*

A roaring sound came from the depths of the void. Four dragon-shaped creatures, black as ink, roared heaven-shatteringly as they tore through space. Behind them, they pulled a black coffin, which was like a cosmic black hole, absorbing all light.

"Black Prison Dragons! Someone from Border Prison!" someone exclaimed in shock. These exotic beasts were unique to Border Prison and were only used by truly grand figures when traveling. Jailers like Huang Qi had no such privilege.

As they drew closer, everyone realized that accompanying the Black Prison Dragons was another being. This person's face was chiseled like a blade, appearing cold and resolute. His eyes were intimidating, like two clanging black immortal swords, flowing with menacing runes. He was remarkably tall, a head and a half taller than ordinary people, with a robust physique and dazzling purple hair cascading over his chest and back. His vitality and blood qi were as vast as a sea.

He appeared before the Distinguished Figure of Border Prison and bowed slightly. "My Lord, forgive my late arrival."

"Huang Prison Lord!" An old venerable recognized him and nearly fainted from shock. Fortunately, someone beside him quickly stuffed a gleaming golden pill into his mouth. This was one of the Prison Lords from Border Prison's Four Prisons, yet he was so respectful to that figure! The implications contained within were unimaginable.

The Abyss Tomb being's face also turned extremely grim. It was clear he too recognized this Prison Lord. The identity of the person he had just fought was likely unimaginably high. At the same time, he cursed inwardly, *If your status is so high, why didn't you say so? If you don't say anything, how am I supposed to know who you are?*

"No matter. Why are so many people gathered here?" the Distinguished Figure of Border Prison asked, simultaneously looking towards the black coffin pulled by the Black Prison Dragons.

"It is because a few days ago, several Heavenly Venerates from the Abyss Tomb suddenly moved in this direction, drawing the attention of many in the Star Realm. Many forces have rushed here," the Huang Prison Lord whispered.

Zhou Tian's eyebrows twitched. So, Yuan Chi's status wasn't small after all. He really had to cling tightly to the Grand Figure's thigh.

"Boy, I'll show you who I truly am!" The Distinguished Figure of Border Prison swept his gaze over the Abyss Tomb being. He lightly tapped the black copper coffin, causing patterns of light to bloom and illuminate its surface. Then, an unpleasant creaking sound echoed as the coffin lid slowly opened.

Everyone felt a chilling wind sweep by. The starry sky appeared, boundless and infinite – a vast cosmic galaxy space where enormous, dazzling stars hummed and slowly revolved, and black holes dotted the expanse. This was a terrifying phenomenon; merely opening the coffin lid produced such an anomaly, let alone if the being within truly emerged.

*Whoosh!*

The Distinguished Figure of Border Prison transformed into a streak of light and darted into the coffin. Instantly, all the anomalies retracted, and the cosmic starry sky shattered.

The Huang Prison Lord stood before the coffin, his gaze sweeping over Zhou Tian, seemingly scrutinizing them.

"We are his friends; we helped him," Zhou Tian quickly called out. The Huang Prison Lord paused, looked at Huang Qi, who nodded. The Huang Prison Lord then ceased his scrutiny of them and carefully guarded the coffin, fearing someone might make a move.
