# Chapter 38: Grand Completion of the Azurewood Art (Two-in-One)

After leaving the Mo family’s Spirit Rice shop, Lu Xu visited a few more Spirit Rice shops and found that the prices of Spirit Rice had indeed all risen. The destruction of Qinghu Market had a particularly severe impact on Tianmen City because Tianmen City itself had almost no spiritual fields, relying entirely on external purchases for its Spirit Rice. The Mo family was a crucial grain supplier. Now that the Mo family had issues, not only did grain prices skyrocket, but even the prices of Abstinence Pills and monster beast meat increased.

“How can those low-level cultivators endure this? If the Wei family doesn’t resolve this crisis, many people in Tianmen City will likely flee!” Lu Xu secretly speculated, drawing on his experiences from his previous life. “First, localized conflicts, then the skyrocketing prices of daily necessities, and next will be an all-out war, right?”

With prices rising, he was helpless. He could only buy some Spirit Rice and Spirit Beast meat at high prices. Lu Xu checked and found he currently had around 2,400 spirit stones. He had spent a lot in recent years, but he also obtained over two hundred spirit stones from Fatty Mo’s storage bag. With expenditures and gains balancing out, his spirit stone count remained roughly the same. Despite having so many spirit stones, Lu Xu still felt he didn’t have enough. In the coming years, rent, daily necessities, copying experiences, and other expenses would consume a significant amount of spirit stones. Especially copying experiences; the later the stage of cultivation, the more expensive these experiences became.

During this period, Lu Xu had been inquiring about high-grade talisman masters, high-grade alchemists, and experts cultivating the Azurewood Art. “Last time I copied cultivation method experience, it only went up to Qi Condensation sixth layer. This time, I need to copy one around Qi Condensation ninth layer, which will make facing the late-stage Qi Condensation bottleneck much easier! I’ll have to pay more attention from now on!”

A few days later.

“Are you talking about the Azurewood Art? Let me think, it seems Daoist Qingye’s cultivation method is the Azurewood Art, isn’t it?”

“Daoist Qingye? Fellow Daoist, could you elaborate?” In a teahouse, Lu Xu sat opposite a white-haired elder.

“Daoist Qingye is a grand expert at Qi Condensation tenth layer, but not many people in Tianmen City know about him!” the elder said with a chuckle.

“Oh, why is that? An expert at Qi Condensation tenth layer would be an extraordinary figure no matter where they are, right?” Lu Xu’s face showed curiosity.

“It’s like this: if it were anyone else, they would have long been famous across the land. However, Daoist Qingye is quite low-key; you can’t learn his name unless you reach a certain level.”

“This also has to do with what he does!” the white-haired elder said with a slight smile.

“What sort of things?”

“Has Fellow Daoist ever heard of the Secret Market?” The white-haired elder didn’t directly answer Lu Xu’s question, but instead asked this.

“I’ve certainly heard of Secret Markets. Fellow Daoist, you suddenly bring them up; could it be that this Daoist Qingye is the host of one such Secret Market?”

“Haha, Fellow Daoist is astute; that is indeed the case!”

“Tianmen City gathers over ten thousand cultivators, and the various conflicts and robberies happening outside the city walls every day are countless. Many highly skilled fellow daoists possess things that cannot see the light of day! These items naturally cannot be dealt with openly, hence the birth of Secret Markets. No one knows exactly how many Secret Markets there are around Tianmen City, but this old man happens to know that Daoist Qingye controls one of them!”

“Since he’s the host of a Secret Market, it’s normal for his reputation not to be widely known!” Lu Xu said thoughtfully.

The elder nodded, then asked with a hint of curiosity: “Why is Fellow Daoist inquiring about late-stage Qi Condensation experts who cultivate the Azurewood Art?”

“Naturally, I’ve encountered some issues in my cultivation and wish to find someone for guidance!”

Hearing this, the elder shook his head: “That would be very difficult. No one knows where Daoist Qingye lives or what his true identity is in reality! It’s hard enough just to meet him, let alone ask him for cultivation experience!”

“If no one knows his identity, how did Fellow Daoist know he cultivates the Azurewood Art?” Lu Xu frowned.

“Hehe, since this old man is in this line of work, I naturally have certain channels. I cannot elaborate on this to Fellow Daoist, but this old man can guarantee that Daoist Qingye’s cultivation method is indeed the Azurewood Art!” the elder chuckled.

“Since Daoist Qingye is so difficult to meet, does Fellow Daoist know of anyone else who could give me some pointers?”

“Hmm, besides Daoist Qingye, there’s also Liu Yushan, the patriarch of the Liu family, who cultivates the Azurewood Art. His cultivation is at Qi Condensation seventh layer. And Talisman Master Nine Woods also seems to cultivate the Azurewood Art…” The elder listed several people, but Lu Xu repeatedly shook his head. Copying the experiences of these people would be too uneconomical; it would cause him to lose several hundred spirit stones for nothing. If he was going to copy, he might as well aim directly for a grand expert at Qi Condensation tenth layer.

“May I ask how one can participate in Daoist Qingye’s Secret Market? Are there any thresholds?” he asked directly.

“Only cultivators at Qi Condensation middle stage or higher can participate. Fellow Daoist naturally meets this requirement. Besides that, everyone must pay an entrance fee of five spirit stones! Daoist Qingye’s Secret Market trade fair is only held once every three years. As far as this old man knows, the next one happens to be in a month, located in Weidu...”

After chatting with the elder for a moment, Lu Xu paid him one spirit stone and left. Through their conversation, he gained a detailed understanding of the Secret Market trade fair situation in Tianmen City. These Secret Markets were not entirely clandestine; at the very least, the Wei family, as the masters of this territory, should be well aware of such activities on their land. The Wei family’s attitude towards this was to turn a blind eye. In fact, according to the elder who specialized in selling information, many Secret Market trade fairs might even have the Wei family’s backing.

“This Secret Market trade fair is worth attending, whether it’s to copy someone’s experience or to deal with the magic tools I have on hand! However, I must be cautious about this; I need to gather information from various sources!”

With that thought, Lu Xu visited Gao Tianqiang the next day.

“Secret Market trade fair? I’m not unfamiliar with these; I don’t even know how many I’ve attended before!”

“Brother Gao, have you attended the Secret Markets here in Tianmen City?”

“Of course, I have! In the few years I’ve been here, I’ve used the Secret Market to deal with many items!” As Gao Tianqiang spoke, a sudden look of realization appeared on his face: “I understand. Brother Lu wants to get rid of some things he obtained from the Mo family, but he’s worried about the relationship between the Mo family and the Wei family, fearing that he might be targeted by the Wei family after selling these items, right?”

“Fellow Daoist is overthinking. On the contrary, I want to dispose of some items obtained from the Black Robe Cultivation Robbers!” Lu Xu said expressionlessly.

Hearing this, Gao Tianqiang laughed, unconcerned. “No matter what Brother Lu wants to deal with, there’s no need to worry. Even if you killed a Wei family member, you could still dispose of the items through the Secret Market here without fearing retaliation from the Wei family! If the Wei family didn’t have this level of credibility, fellow Daoists wouldn’t dare to hold Secret Market trade fairs on their territory!”

Gao Tianqiang’s words were similar to what the elder had said. The Secret Market trade fairs seemed to bring huge benefits to the Wei family, so they wouldn’t easily do anything to damage their own credibility. To be safe, Lu Xu sought out other channels to inquire, and the results were all the same. “It seems this Secret Market trade fair is indeed worth attending!”

One month later.

In an alley in the south of Weidu City, a cold, black-clad youth entered the dimly lit lane. Arriving at a large gate at the end of the alley, he reached out and knocked on the bronze knocker.

A moment later, the large gate opened, and a beautiful young woman in a long dress walked out. She sized up the black-clad man, and when she clearly perceived his Qi Condensation fifth-layer cultivation, her expression immediately became cautious.

“Fellow Daoist, what brings you here?”

“I heard that Daoist Qingye is holding a trade fair here, and I specifically came to visit!”

“So, you are a fellow Daoist here to participate in the trade fair. Since you’ve found your way here, I presume Fellow Daoist knows the rules of this place?”

The black-clad man nodded, took out five spirit stones, and handed them over.

“Fellow Daoist, please follow me!”

The young woman led the black-clad man into the courtyard, then into a room, where she opened a deeply hidden mechanism. Immediately, a dark secret passage appeared in the room. The two walked into the secret passage. A moment later, the young woman reappeared at the courtyard gate. After collecting five spirit stones, she led in a wrinkled old woman. In this manner, over approximately an hour, seven or eight cultivators at Qi Condensation middle stage or higher were successively led into the courtyard and into the secret passage by the young woman.

“So many people gathering here, it seems I wasn’t mistaken!” In a corner of the alley, Lu Xu observed for a long time before feeling at ease. He disguised himself as a gray-templed man in green robes. After paying five spirit stones, he was led by the young woman into the secret passage.

At the end of the secret passage was a stone chamber over a thousand square meters in size, illuminated brightly by numerous luminous pearls. Upon entering, Lu Xu saw that dozens of people were already present. In the center of the stone chamber was a large table, surrounded by circles of chairs, seemingly capable of seating several hundred people. Finding a chair with few people around it, Lu Xu sat down and slowly waited.

It was very quiet here. Almost everyone who entered had no desire to converse with those around them. Some wore masks, some wore veils, and some simply used magic tools or talismans to conceal their appearance. Moreover, almost everyone wore loose, wide robes, making it impossible to discern their physical features. Not using Spirit Eye Art was the most basic rule of the Secret Market trade fair. If anyone did so, they would almost immediately face a collective attack from all participating cultivators. No one dared to take such a risk, so here, with even a slight disguise, there was no fear of one’s true face being discovered. Of course, there were also cultivators who made no attempt at concealment, sitting openly and unafraid of any prying gazes. Although Lu Xu had already altered his appearance with the bronze mask, before entering, he still wore a wide-brimmed bamboo hat that completely obscured his face, making him look like a beekeeper.

Time flowed silently, and people continuously arrived in the stone chamber, one after another. After two hours, when the number of cultivators gathered here reached over a hundred, the stone chamber’s great door suddenly closed. Immediately afterward, a hidden door in a corner of the stone chamber suddenly opened, and a burly figure emerged.

“It seems these are all the fellow Daoists attending this trade fair. This old man is Daoist Qingye, and I presume all of you have heard of my humble name.” The burly figure walked towards the large table in the center of the hall as he spoke. His voice was low, and he wore a ghost mask on his face, making it impossible to discern his true identity.

“Is this the one?” Lu Xu’s heart stirred.

“This old man won’t say much about the rules; I believe every Fellow Daoist has already heard them before coming! Now, this old man announces that the trade fair officially begins. The first to display their item shall be this old man! This old man has an excellent Qi Condensation third-layer cultivation cauldron here, to be exchanged for a piece of Scarlet Blood Copper or equivalent spirit stones!”

As the elder spoke, he clapped his hands, and immediately, the stone slab on the ground creaked. A dark hole appeared on the ground, followed by an iron cage rising from the opening. Inside the cage, a girl with her head bowed and dull, lifeless eyes appeared before everyone. This girl was exquisitely beautiful, her pitiful appearance truly captivating. She wore only a few sheer veils, subtly revealing her enchanting features, making observers feel parched.

“This is a cultivation cauldron carefully nurtured by this old man. She has cultivated the ‘Yin Gathering and Essence Nurturing Art’ since childhood…” Daoist Qingye introduced the cultivation cauldron in the cage with an eager tone, and the many cultivators present listened attentively.

Lu Xu’s attention, however, was not on that. Azure light flickered in his eyes as he looked at Daoist Qingye and silently recited in his heart: “Check cultivation method experience!”

After the azure light flashed, a line of text appeared before his eyes: [Cultivation Method: Azurewood Art (Grand Completion): 1000/1000]

“Sure enough, once Qi Condensation tenth layer is reached, the experience is directly full!” The Azurewood Art is divided into four stages: Initiation, Minor Completion, Major Completion, and Grand Completion. These four stages correspond to the early, middle, late, and grand completion stages of Qi Condensation respectively. After Daoist Qingye cultivated to Qi Condensation tenth layer, he could no longer advance in the Azurewood Art cultivation method. His next step could only be to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm and then switch to a higher-grade cultivation method.

“A thousand spirit stones, that really stings!” Lu Xu’s eyelid twitched. Before coming, he had already anticipated that the Qi Condensation tenth-layer experience would be very expensive, so he had preemptively deposited 1,200 spirit stones into the Green Stone Stele. Now, the replication points on the Green Stone Stele were 1239, which was more than enough to replicate this experience.

Lu Xu secretly sighed, and silently murmured in his heart: “Replicate!”

The next moment, after an azure light flashed, a torrent of information surged from Daoist Qingye and poured into Lu Xu. The massive amount of information immediately caused Lu Xu’s eyes to become vacant. He sat motionless in his spot, his mind diligently absorbing this torrent.

Meanwhile, Daoist Qingye was completely unaware that his experience had been replicated. He continued to elaborate endlessly on the marvelous qualities of the cultivation cauldron he had meticulously nurtured. This girl had been fed a special kind of pill by him, and she cultivated a unique method specifically created for cultivation cauldrons. Generally, those who cultivated such methods did not live long. The entire purpose of their lives was, at a certain moment, to have all their cultivation and vital essence taken, helping another person’s cultivation advance further, and then to die.

“With this cultivation cauldron, breaking through the late-stage Qi Condensation bottleneck will absolutely not be an issue. Fellow Daoists, please seize the opportunity to bid!”

“May I ask how much Scarlet Blood Copper Daoist Qingye requires?” A voice suddenly rang out.

“At least two catties!”

“This old man has one catty of Scarlet Blood Copper, plus two hundred spirit stones. May I purchase this cultivation cauldron?”

“Are there any other Fellow Daoists with a higher bid?” Daoist Qingye didn’t rush to accept but instead asked.

“I am willing to offer four hundred and fifty spirit stones!”

“Four hundred and eighty spirit stones!”

The cultivation cauldron girl actually triggered a small bidding war, and was ultimately taken for the price of one catty of Scarlet Blood Copper plus four hundred and fifty spirit stones. This amounted to six hundred and fifty spirit stones!

“How truly insane, but this can help break through the late-stage Qi Condensation bottleneck, so selling at this price is normal!” Lu Xu thought to himself. To be able to produce so many spirit stones, the bidder must have a significant background. Ordinary middle-stage Qi Condensation cultivators were far from having such abundant wealth.

“This kind of Secret Market trade fair truly opens one’s eyes. But then again, the cultivation world is too dangerous. Fortunately, the Mo family, who discovered me, was a righteous sect! If I had fallen into the hands of those unrestrained factions, I’m afraid my fate wouldn’t be much better than that girl in the cage!” Lu Xu secretly mused. His medium-grade spiritual root was quite enticing, and his appearance was also rather handsome. If he had been discovered by someone like Daoist Qingye back then, Lu Xu dared not imagine what his fate would have been. A cultivation cauldron isn’t exclusively female; there are female cultivators in the cultivation world who also have such needs, so male cultivation cauldrons are not uncommon.

While Lu Xu was pondering these thoughts, Daoist Qingye completed the transaction and stepped down. Immediately afterward, another cultivator walked to the center of the stone chamber. He carefully took out a box and opened it. Inside, quietly nestled, was a round, walnut-like sphere with a blue and red hue.

“One Fire Thunder Orb, in exchange for a high-quality flying magic tool!”

“Fire Thunder Orb?!” Lu Xu’s heart immediately stirred upon seeing this item. This was similar to the Yin Fire Thunder, both being powerful trump cards capable of threatening late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators, possessing immense power. The Black Robe Cultivation Robber had once used one, leaving a deep impression on Lu Xu.

“A flying magic tool… I do have the Azure Wind Boat, but I’m reluctant to trade that!” Lu Xu stared at the Fire Thunder Orb, his brows slightly furrowed.

“I have a Black Wind Hood, Fellow Daoist, see if it meets your needs!” A masked cultivator immediately stepped forward and said. He took out the magic tool and displayed it to the other party. The cultivator holding the Fire Thunder Orb looked at the Black Wind Hood and shook his head. The masked cultivator retreated in disappointment.

“I have…” Two more cultivators successively presented flying magic tools, but none met the person’s requirements. Finally, the cultivator shook his head helplessly: “Fine, if that’s the case, then I’ll sell it for spirit stones. One Fire Thunder Orb, starting bid two hundred and fifty spirit stones!”

“I bid two hundred and eighty spirit stones!”

“Two hundred and eighty-five!”

After a round of bidding, Lu Xu acquired the Fire Thunder Orb for three hundred and fifteen spirit stones. He then naturally stepped into the center of the stone chamber and took out his own items.

“Selling a few magic tools!”
