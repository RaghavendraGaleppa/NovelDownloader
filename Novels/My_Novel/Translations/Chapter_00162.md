Chapter 162: Storming the Wuxiao Hall, Declared a Fugitive!

The end of August had arrived.

Summer was fading into autumn, bringing cool winds and refreshing air. Leaves had yet to fall, but fruits were already ripe. It was the busy farming season. Although the common folk lived a hard life, with rice in their homes and grain in their barns, smiles graced their faces.

Li Xian had eliminated several ruthless criminals, and his reputation had spread far and wide. The County Magistrate of Qingning County, terrified by his influence, recalled the words Li Xian had spoken at a banquet: "I will make the skies over Qingning even clearer."

Consequently, this month's collection of grain and taxes was handled with caution. The great landowners, aristocratic families, guilds, and yamen runners dared not act recklessly. The chaotic practice of arbitrarily raising taxes was somewhat curbed.

The common people were deeply grateful, knowing these benefits were due to Li Xian. They prayed for the Wuxiao's long life. Li Xian, however, never sought to build his own reputation; he acted purely according to his conscience. Hearing the praises of the people, his heart remained indifferent.

"I only do what I can within my power to help the weak; it is merely a casual act. Although I seem to have some influence in Qingning County, my foundation is not solid. The lives of these commoners still depend on their own fate. I have my own path to walk; I cannot carry the weight of the entire populace on my shoulders."

Whether scolded or praised, he follows his own heart. The tides of criticism cannot shake his resolve, nor can the waves of flattery sway his true intentions.

At the Yihe Manor.

Uncle Xiang was responsible for the accounting of the manor. He managed the many industries of the Madam in the Prefecture City and the counties under it, giving him access to a vast network of information.

"How have things been recently?"

The Madam, draped in a yellow gown, possessed a grace that no one else could witness. She held a porcelain chopstick, lightly picking up fish food and feeding the goldfish one by one.

"The business operations are doing well," Uncle Xiang replied, kneeling and kowtowing. His hands were stacked, palms pressing against his forehead and the back of his hands touching the ground, showing extreme reverence.

The Madam waved her hand gently. "There is no need for such formalities."

"How could that be? Facing..."

The Madam interrupted impatiently, "How is he?"

"He?" Uncle Xiang was startled for a moment. His mind raced, and he realized the "he" she referred to was Li Xian. He had been paying attention to Li Xian all along, so he told the truth.

"Li Xian has recently eliminated the criminals on the Red List, and his prestige in the county is unmatched. He has over thirty yamen runners under the Wuxiao Hall and ten shops under his name, all located in Qingning County. Most are clothing shops, but he has also dabbled in rice shops and food shops."

"Yesterday, a dispute arose between two martial arts schools. Li Xian went to mediate. With his great prestige, he resolved the conflict with just a few words."

Madam Wen put down her porcelain chopstick, her fingers tapping lightly on the table, making a crisp "clack" sound. She gazed into the distance, listening with great interest.

"I gave him some space, and he really has made a name for himself. Not bad, not bad. He is indeed no ordinary talent."

"Summon him here."

Uncle Xiang followed the order and went to fetch him. Li Xian was in the Commandery Hall, so it didn't take long for him to be brought over.

As Uncle Xiang left, he couldn't help but think to himself, "The Madam is summoning Li Xian more and more frequently."

Cao Kai, a member of the Cao clan, arrived to take up his post at the end of summer. Seeing the empty city gates and no one there to welcome him, he frowned deeply. Although he knew the Wuxiao was in favor, he had been highly respected since he was a child because of his surname, Cao. Being treated with such coldness made him furious.

"Cao Yun, a mere mediocrity, failed here and tarnished the reputation of our Cao family. Now that I, Cao Kai, am personally here, won't I easily subdue you and make you乖乖 surrender?"

The clan had held a meeting and ordered him to take office in Qingning. He had deliberately shown weakness to gain more support from the clan. As a scion of a prominent family, how could he fear a mere local official?

Once he left the Prefecture City, he saw nothing but mud and dirt along the way, and his arrogance grew even stronger.

"So outside the Prefecture City, it's all just this kind of trash. Only the leaders of guilds are barely worth a glance. What so-called local snakes? In the end, they are just slightly larger ants."

***

Inside the Yamen Hall.

As soon as Cao Kai took office, he began to inspect the layout of the hall.

He knew that Cao Yun had died within the hall, so he was very cautious. He sealed the well and ordered several servants of similar build to wear the same official clothes to confuse anyone who might be watching.

"Even if that Wuxiao attacks, I have nothing to fear. Cao Yun studied literature since he was young and barely dabbled in martial arts; he was weak and helpless. But I, Cao Kai, have practiced martial arts since childhood. I entered the Food Essence stage in my teens. Although I switched to studying later, I have never neglected my martial training."

"I'm afraid that local Wuxiao is no match for me."

Cao Kai assumed a fighting stance and performed a set of the Cao family's fist techniques. The wind whistled, and his fist force was powerful. Although his martial arts attainment was not as good as the geniuses of the clan, it was still quite impressive.

Furthermore, he had been granted a golden-threaded light armor by the family, which was impervious to blades and swords. He had made comprehensive preparations and truly had nothing to fear.

His confidence was as vast as a flood.

"The clan is all watching me. In such a situation, I must display a thunderous momentum, striking with one decisive blow to show the might of my Cao family."

The "Red List Scheme" was a plot by the clan. Seeing that the ten-day deadline had passed, he immediately charged toward the Wuxiao Hall on the charges of "colluding with bandits and aiding their escape," organizing his troops for the assault.

He brought with him fifty Cao soldiers and three hundred Prefecture soldiers. The Cao soldiers were elite private troops raised by the Cao family. The Prefecture soldiers were secretly mobilized by exploiting his official authority.

***

In front of the Wuxiao Hall.

Cao Kai had learned from Cao Yun's lesson. Without a word, he waved his hand, and the private Cao troops and Prefecture soldiers stormed through the gates.

In the outer courtyard hall, the runners were eating lunch and chatting idly. Suddenly hearing the commotion, Zhang Hou shouted, "Enemy attack!" The others reacted swiftly, grabbing their weapons and launching a counter-attack.

The sound of clashing weapons rang out.

The enemy was numerous, and we were few; the disparity was immense. After a fierce battle, they were pushed back step by step, forced into a corner.

Seeing that there was no way back, Wang Wu was enraged that this group of bandits dared to storm the Wuxiao Hall in broad daylight. A fierce intent rose within him, perfectly aligning with the essence of his saber technique.

He brandished his great saber, not retreating but advancing instead, charging into the midst of the enemy.

A broken saber does not seek completeness, only to break the enemy! His saber style was full of dangerous moves, trading his life for the enemy's, blood for blood!

When outnumbered, a person with an intact body will inevitably be cautious about self-preservation, holding back. Facing an attack from a crowd, they would focus seventy percent on defense and thirty percent on offense.

Wang Wu was the exact opposite, caring only for injuring the enemy and completely disregarding his own injuries.

Moreover, he was inherently loyal and good-natured, with a fierce and unyielding temper. Once he was won over, he followed with all his heart.

Wang Wu roared, "I will open a path, brothers, follow me and fight out!" He plunged into the enemy ranks. The Wuxiao Hall was filled with young, ambitious men full of blood and spirit.

His shout was met with a hundred responses.

"Kill!" Zhang Hou immediately followed.

Like a cornered beast fighting back, or burning one's boats to show determination, their momentum was like a rainbow.

Just as the battle reached its peak, Cao Kai's voice rang out, "All of you, step aside!" The Cao and Prefecture soldiers obeyed the order and immediately parted to both sides.

The runners were overjoyed and rushed forward. After turning two corners, they arrived at an open space. But their hearts suddenly turned cold. The enemy had come prepared. On the pavilions and inside the houses, archers were already arranged in neat rows, their bows drawn and ready to fire!

They were now turtles in a jar, meat on a cutting board.

"Damn it!" Wang Wu wanted to fight to the death.

Zhang Hou patted Wang Wu's shoulder, signaling him to stop.

Cao Kai laughed. "You rebels, why haven't you put down your weapons yet!"

"I will count to three. If you haven't put them down by then, don't blame me for being merciless."

He didn't hesitate and counted to three. Zhang Hou had a steady temperament and did not fear death, but seeing the sudden encirclement by government troops, he wanted to understand the situation.

So he put down his weapon. Wang Wu did not understand and wanted to fight to the death, but meeting Zhang Hou's eyes, he also put down his long saber.

"That's more like it," Cao Kai said with a smile.

He put his hands behind his back, full of pride, and said loudly to the crowd, "Where is Li Xian? Among you, who is Li Xian?"

Zhang Hou angrily said, "Who are you? How dare you surround the Wuxiao Hall! Who gave you the courage!"

Cao Kai smiled. "Who am I? I am the County Magistrate of Qingning County."

Wang Wu said coldly, "Even the County Magistrate has no right to surround the Wuxiao Hall! Wait until the Wuxiao大人 returns, and he will surely make you pay!"

Cao Kai slapped Wang Wu twice, "Pa, Pa," his cheeks swelling up immediately.

"Ridiculous. If he dares to come back, it would just suit my intentions perfectly. Do you think I'm afraid of him?" Cao Kai saw the runners were indignant, glaring at him with anger, yet they were not afraid of him.

Cao Kai said, "You are very unconvinced?"

"This County Magistrate and that Cao Yun, although from the same clan, are worlds apart. I tell you, I can be the County Magistrate, and I can also be the Wuxiao. If you don't believe me..."

His eyes flashed with a harsh light. He grabbed a nearby runner and gently pushed with his palm. The runner was sent flying, crashing onto the eaves. With a "crack," his spine shattered, his body bent, and he fell from a height, dead.

"You!"

The runners were shocked, angry, terrified, and fearful. Their martial arts were barely at the入门 level, so they couldn't see the intricacies, but they knew it was extremely powerful and beyond the capability of an ordinary person.

Cao Kai said proudly, "How about it? Can your Wuxiao大人, that country bumpkin, achieve what I just did?"

"Naturally..." Wang Wu, unwilling to suffer humiliation, retorted sharply. Zhang Hou covered his mouth, knowing the disparity in strength was too great. Acting rashly would only add to the casualties. The top priority was to understand the situation before planning anything else.

Zhang Hou said, "County Magistrate大人, you have just taken office. Why have you surrounded the Wuxiao Hall?"

"You truly don't know?" Cao Kai said mockingly.

"I truly do not," Zhang Hou replied.

"That is naturally because your Wuxiao大人 has colluded with vicious bandits and let them escape to harm the people of the county," Cao Kai said. "This County Magistrate cannot stand by and watch. I must kill the chicken to scare the monkey."

"Nonsense," Zhang Hou suppressed his anger. "When did we ever collude with bandits!"

"Heh," Cao Kai said. "Some time ago, did you not receive the Jianghu Red List? It records the vicious criminals of the Jianghu."

"That is correct," Zhang Hou nodded.

Cao Kai spoke eloquently:

"The Child-Eating Old Man has been sighted in Qingning. This old man's crimes are heinous; he steals children and eats them. His actions are hated by both gods and men. He has been on the run for a year."

"We finally found his exact trail. The criminal was right before your eyes, yet your Wuxiao took no action to hunt him down and kill him!?"

"Allowing him to continue his evil deeds, and even helping him escape. Such actions are nothing short of colluding with bandits. What else could it be?"

Zhang Hou said, "How do you know that my大人 did not kill that Child-Eating Old Man?"

"Oh?" Cao Kai was surprised. "Could it be that the Child-Eating Old Man has already died in the hands of that Wuxiao?"

"That's right!" Zhang Hou said. "Some time ago, the Wuxiao led us to surround and kill the Child-Eating Old Man together. We have already killed that villain."

"The truth is now clear; it was all a misunderstanding. County Magistrate大人, under these circumstances, you have no reason to besiege our Wuxiao Hall anymore!"

Cao Kai stroked his chin. "If what you say is true, then this County Magistrate has indeed misunderstood the Wuxiao大人. But everything requires evidence. I cannot just listen to your one-sided story."

Zhang Hou said, "It's simple. The corpse of the Child-Eating Old Man is stored in the underground storeroom. The evidence is irrefutable. A simple check by the County Magistrate大人 will suffice!"

Cao Kai gave a command. The attendants by his side immediately searched and soon found several corpses from the storeroom. Comparing them one by one, they were all criminals from the Red List.

The head of the Child-Eating Old Man was among them.

The runners, seeing this, secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Today's humiliation could be avenged later; the priority was to get through this difficult situation.

Cao Kai frowned. "It really is the corpse of the Child-Eating Old Man."

"Of course," Zhang Hou said. "The misunderstanding is resolved. Please return, County Magistrate大人."

Cao Kai sneered. He took out a wine flask, poured the wine onto the corpses, and then struck with his palm from a distance. His palm energy was like fire; upon touching the wine, it instantly burst into flames.

"County Magistrate大人, what are you doing..." Zhang Hou's pupils constricted.

Cao Kai said calmly, "The Wuxiao Hall colluded with the Child-Eating Old Man and allowed him to escape. Take all the runners in the hall back to prison for a severe interrogation!"

"Wuxiao Li Xian, is hereby declared a fugitive!"
