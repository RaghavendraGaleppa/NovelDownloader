# Chapter 368: Little Ice Cube, Old Father’s Complicated Feelings

The wing room wasn’t remote, yet the surroundings seemed exceptionally quiet. The courtyard must have once been planted with exotic flowers and rare grasses, but now they were all withered, leaving only a cold fragrance behind.

“Ice’er, it’s time for lunch.”

Lady Ying gently knocked on the door. Hearing no response from inside, she finally pushed it open.

Li Mo shivered. It had been a long time since he felt this cold, but he still looked into the room.

Sunlight poured in through the window, dust motes dancing in the light, illuminating the tea table where a game of Go had just concluded.

The little girl sat quietly before the board. Her joyous red dress should have looked festive, but on her, it exuded a noble and heart-stirring aura.

Little Ice Cube had a delicate face, carrying a tranquility that didn’t belong to a child her age.

She didn’t quite have that ethereal aura yet, but she carried a vague spiritual charm. If not for the slight flutter of her eyelashes just now, she would have been mistaken for a noble porcelain doll.

She turned her gaze back, a hint of confusion in her eyes.

“This is the child from the Li family. You’ve met before,” Lady Ying introduced as she opened the lunch box.

Little Ice Cube didn’t seem to remember him?

Li Mo pondered this.

They had only met once at this point. If she remembered him, did it mean her subconscious was awakening, and the dream would end?

“Ice’er, I made your favorite dish.”

“Mom, I’m not hungry.”

The little girl’s voice was soft and crisp.

“You barely ate anything yesterday,” Lady Ying said with worry.

Little Ice Cube nodded, took a bite of the food, and immediately frowned.

After just two bites, she tightly closed her lips, refusing to eat more.

“Auntie, who played Go with her?” Li Mo jumped up onto the chair opposite her.

“She played against herself. No one in the family can beat her anymore.”

“How about a game with me?”

Little Li Mo looked profound and aloof.

“?”

She lifted her eyes, the ice and snow in her gaze seeming to stop falling.

Li Mo found it amusing. To others, Little Ice Cube’s childhood self might seem a bit strange, but in his eyes, she had a kind of contrast cuteness, especially when she was spacing out.

*So cute.*

“Come on? I have a new way to play. Whoever connects five in a row wins. Want to try?”

Little Ying Bing remained silent but started clearing the black and white stones from the table.

It seemed Little Ice Cube had a strong desire to win even as a child...

Lady Ying was somewhat surprised; she had never seen her daughter take an interest in anything.

But what surprised her even more happened ten minutes later.

Her daughter, who could make Go masters feel ashamed, actually lost!

Although they weren’t playing Go, simply connecting five stones was obviously easier.

“Impressive, right?”

Little Li Mo had the air of a big ice cube.

Little Ying Bing narrowed her eyes slightly:

“This game, the one who moves first will always win.”

“!”

Li Mo leaned back slightly.

He had lost many times before figuring this out. As expected of Ice Cube—even the cub version is terrifying!

“Sister, eat.”

Little Ying Bing subconsciously nodded and picked up the chopsticks herself.

Only after the food entered her mouth did her beautiful eyes lose focus for a moment. She seemed to不解 why she listened to him saying “eat” so naturally?

Lady Ying covered her mouth in shock.

Her daughter had always been cold, and after falling ill, she became even more so. Even toward her parents, she rarely showed emotional fluctuations.

Yet now...

“Auntie, can I go out for a walk with Sister Bing later?”

Li Mo remained calm on the surface but was secretly delighted.

Little Ice Cube’s subconscious still remembered him.

It was working!

“Ice’er?” Lady Ying looked at her daughter with probing eyes, her tone somewhat excited.

Her daughter hadn’t left the house for a long time. If this continued, she was afraid she might really get sick.

“Sister, take me out to play for a bit.”

Little Li Mo said seriously.

It had to be said, although Little Li Mo was a little troublemaker in the private school, he was adorably fair and delicate, even when he looked serious.

“Mm...”

Little Ying Bing’s pink cheeks moved slightly. She replied as softly as a mosquito’s hum before taking small bites of her food.

After the meal.

Li Mo was the first to walk out the door. The threshold was a bit high, so he had to hop over it.

Little Ying Bing put down her bowl and chopsticks. Under her mother’s encouraging gaze, she picked up the hem of her rose-red brocade skirt. Just as she was about to step onto the threshold and jump down, a hand reached out to her.

She looked up in a daze and saw the little boy bathed in the courtyard sunlight, beaming with a bright smile.

“Let’s go.”

“Mm.”

Little Ying Bing was momentarily stunned. Before her mind could decide, her body had already given the answer first.

By the time she reacted, her small hand was already warm, held by another slightly larger hand.

Lady Ying: “?”

She just cleaned up the dishes—what did she miss this time?

And also...

Ice’er was actually willing to let another child hold her hand so quietly?!

The three of them returned to the lively ancestral hall.

“Little Sister is willing to come out?”

“Am I blind? Or am I still dreaming?”

“Ouch! If you’re dreaming, why pinch me?!”

“She’s even holding hands with another little kid!”

“That’s the Li family boy, right?”

Don’t be fooled by how small Little Ice Cube is; she actually has a high status in the Ying family. Among her generation, some children are already as old as her.

The Ying family members outside, seeing the two coming out of the courtyard, rubbed their eyes in disbelief. They had all heard of this little sister.

Now that they saw her come out, it was even more lively than New Year’s.

“Husband, look.”

“Hmm?”

Ying Xuliang was chatting with a friend. When he turned back, he saw the two little ones walking out hand in hand.

They looked like a perfect match.

It was a good thing his daughter was willing to come out.

But they say a daughter is her father’s little padded jacket. However, his little jacket not only let the wind in but was also made of ice.

Counting on his fingers, she hadn’t said more than ten words to him in three days. And her intelligence often made him, as her father, feel intellectually suppressed.

Yet now, she was being led by another family’s boy with a calm and obedient expression?

The old father’s feelings were complicated—excited yet inexplicably mixed with depression.

“Uncle Ying, what’s wrong?”

Little Li Mo pulled Ying Bing to stand before the couple.

For some reason, under Uncle Ying’s gaze, he felt a bit nervous.

“It’s nothing. Go play, just don’t run too far.”

“.....”

Looking at the bustling ancestral hall, Li Mo’s lips moved, but in the end, he just nodded and said, “Okay.”

When the Ying family performed their ancestral rites tonight, everyone would die.

But as a child, saying such ominous things during New Year’s—who would believe him? It would be good if he wasn’t kicked out.

Moreover.

This was a dream.
