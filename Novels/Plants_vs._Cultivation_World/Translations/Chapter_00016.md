# Chapter 16: Minor Cloud Rain Technique

No one came to answer the doubts in Gu Mo's heart, and right now, his most important task was to master a spell as quickly as possible. With five options to choose from, mastering just one would allow him to pass the assessment and rent his own spiritual field.  

After reading the descriptions of the five spells, Gu Mo had already made his choice—the Minor Cloud Rain Technique.  

This was the most frequently used spell for daily management, so it was only natural to prioritize mastering it. Otherwise, Gu Mo would have to fetch spiritual spring water every day to irrigate the fields, which would be far too inefficient.  

With this in mind, Gu Mo flipped the manual to the page detailing the Minor Cloud Rain Technique. Compared to the rudimentary Cleaning Technique, this first-tier spell was several times more difficult.  

But it wasn’t a problem. Drawing on knowledge from his past life, Gu Mo had already grasped some of the key principles behind the Minor Cloud Rain Technique.  

The technique worked by using a special hand seal to convert the spiritual energy within a cultivator’s body into fine particles, which were then scattered into the air. These particles would absorb moisture from the atmosphere, condense into droplets, and finally fall as rain infused with spiritual energy.  

Having understood the underlying principle, Gu Mo had overcome the bottleneck to mastering the technique. The only thing left was to spend time practicing the hand seals. And time was something Gu Mo had in abundance. If he encountered any difficulties, he could always attend lectures at the Transmission Hall.

**"Minor Cloud Rain Technique!"**  

Gu Mo swiftly formed the hand seals, and immediately, a small dark cloud formed inside his room, composed of countless condensed water droplets. A light drizzle began to fall from the cloud, thoroughly soaking the entire room.  

But Gu Mo paid no mind to the mess. After a month of effort, he had finally mastered the first-tier Minor Cloud Rain Technique. Now, he could officially call himself a spiritual farmer.  

Mastering a first-tier spell in just one month was nothing short of extraordinary among the outer sect disciples—even among inner sect disciples, such talent would be considered top-tier.  

However, Gu Mo knew that his success was due to the knowledge from his past life, which had allowed him to decipher the principles behind the technique. In the world of cultivation, this would be described as grasping the essence of the Minor Cloud Rain Technique. For a native cultivator, understanding the formation of rain would have been far more difficult.  

That said, when it came to practicing the hand seals, Gu Mo had no advantage—it was simply a matter of putting in the time and effort.  

Now that he had mastered the Minor Cloud Rain Technique, all he needed to do was demonstrate his ability to pass the assessment and rent his own spiritual field.  

But Fan Shaoming’s example served as a warning. A mere outer sect disciple mastering a first-tier spell in just one month would draw far too much attention.  

---  

Of course, innate comprehension was something no one could steal, but Gu Mo truly did possess a great opportunity. If he attracted the wrong kind of attention, the secret of his Sunflower might be exposed.  

"Maybe I should learn another spell?"  

Since he couldn’t reveal his mastery of the Minor Cloud Rain Technique just yet, Gu Mo couldn’t afford to sit idle. All five spells exclusive to spiritual farmers were useful, and the more he mastered, the better.  

After all, once he rented a spiritual field, he would have to handle everything himself—unlike the inner sect disciples, who had numerous outer sect disciples assisting them with various farming spells.

"Yunfa, how did the recruitment of outer sect disciples go this time?" Zhao Qiancheng asked Mai Yunfa, who had just returned from his assignment.  

While Gu Mo had been immersed in his cultivation, the one-year deadline had quietly arrived. By now, all recruitment efforts from the various peaks had concluded.  

Those who hadn’t managed to join a peak by this point would lose the right to choose—the sect would forcibly assign them based on the vacancies in each division.  

"Only Junior Brother Gu Mo volunteered to join us," Mai Yunfa said with a shrug.  

"Ah, well."  

Zhao Qiancheng sighed deeply. When Gu Mo had joined, he had thought the Spiritual Planting Hall might finally see a resurgence this year. Who would have guessed they’d only get one recruit?  

A single disciple was far from enough. The Spiritual Planting Hall had always been the most understaffed. While other peaks filled their ranks early, the Spiritual Planting Hall always ended up short-handed. As a result, the leftover outer sect disciples—those no one else wanted—were usually assigned here.  

Zhao Qiancheng was reluctant to accept these rejects, but having someone was still better than having no one at all. The Spiritual Planting Hall’s mission was to provide the sect with sufficient quantities of spiritual rice. If they failed to meet their quota, the hall’s resources would be cut.  

"By the way, how is that Gu Mo progressing?" Zhao Qiancheng asked.  

Since Gu Mo was the only disciple who had volunteered to join, Zhao Qiancheng felt it was worth keeping an eye on him. Showing concern for such disciples might also demonstrate the hall’s appreciation for those who chose to join willingly, potentially attracting more recruits in the future.  

"I’ll go check on him right away!"  

After bringing Gu Mo to the hall, Mai Yunfa had more or less forgotten about him. After all, what was there to pay attention to with an outer sect disciple? But now that the hall master had asked, he had no choice but to go see.  

Hearing this, Zhao Qiancheng waved his hand dismissively. If Mai Yunfa weren’t somewhat related to him, he would have kicked him out long ago.  

---  

**"Hmm!"**  

Gu Mo brought his fingers together, and a faint white light flickered at their tips, emitting a soft hum. Seeing this, a faint smile appeared on his lips—the Minor Metal Qi Blade had been mastered.  

Compared to the Minor Cloud Rain Technique, this spell had taken him two months to learn. But even this speed was astonishingly fast.  

Dispersing the blade of energy, Gu Mo picked up the flowerpot—only to find that the Sunflower was no longer inside. The spiritual energy in the pot had been completely depleted some time ago, causing the Sunflower to revert to its seed form. As a result, Gu Mo hadn’t harvested any Solar Essence in days.  

"I have to secure a spiritual field now."  

Though only three months had passed since he joined the Spiritual Planting Hall, Gu Mo knew he couldn’t wait any longer. He needed to obtain a spiritual field as soon as possible to plant the Sunflower and resume harvesting Solar Essence—only then could he purchase more Sunflowers.  

That said, mastering a first-tier spell in three months was still somewhat conspicuous for an outer sect disciple. But it was far less attention-grabbing than doing it in just one.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, are you there?"  

Just as Gu Mo was hesitating, Mai Yunfa’s voice came from outside. Hearing this, Gu Mo quickly stepped out to greet him.  

"Senior Brother Mai, what brings you here?"  

Gu Mo warmly invited Mai Yunfa inside, though he soon realized with embarrassment that he had nothing to offer as hospitality.  

Mai Yunfa didn’t mind. What could a newly arrived outer sect disciple possibly have? "Junior Brother Gu Mo, Hall Master Zhao sent me to ask about your progress in cultivation."  

"I’ve just barely managed to master the Minor Cloud Rain Technique," Gu Mo replied without hesitation.  

"What?"  

Mai Yunfa had been considering how to encourage Gu Mo to work harder and master a spell as soon as possible, so that the Spiritual Planting Hall could showcase him as an example of the benefits of joining voluntarily. But hearing that Gu Mo had already mastered a spell left him momentarily stunned.
