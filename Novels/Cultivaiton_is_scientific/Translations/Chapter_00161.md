# Chapter 161: Sword Intent

Li Shiming charged straight into the destructive storm of flames and frost ahead. The Northern Shu cultivators hadn't had much time to prepare, so their spells only reached the peak of Qi Refining power. He didn't even bother dodging.

The flames and frost tore through his defensive spiritual energy, instantly reducing his robe to tatters. Yet when these powerful Qi Refining attacks struck his skin, they barely left a mark. At least for the moment, these attacks couldn't harm him much.

He emerged from the area blanketed by spells and broke into the protective circle of Northern Shu cultivators. He didn't launch any attacks—he knew full well that once he left his sword flight and lost his speed advantage, he'd be trapped by the Northern Shu cultivators. Even with his formidable defenses, he dared not be surrounded by these elite Qi Refining cultivators.

The sword light flashed past a Northern Shu cultivator who was kneeling and activating a treasure talisman. The cultivator suddenly felt his hands empty, followed by a backlash surging from within. He spat out a mouthful of blood.

Li Shiming used his spiritual sense to seize the treasure talisman and stored it in his storage bag without a second glance. The sword light shot out of the Northern Shu cultivators' encirclement before swiftly returning to the "Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation."

From leaving to returning, the entire process took no more than two breaths. Though his robe was in tatters, Li Shiming wore a satisfied smile.

Even the Golden Core elders on Seven Stars Island were astonished by his actions. They knew of Li Shiming's exceptional defensive capabilities—it was no secret. When he was only at the sixth level of Qi Refining, he had relied on the Furious Vajra Intent to advance to the seventh level. Now at the eighth level, his "Vajra Protection Divine Art," enhanced by his Intent manifestation, could briefly withstand the barrage of spells. That much wasn't surprising to them.

What truly shocked the Golden Core elders was Li Shiming's decisiveness. The moment he noticed the enemy using a treasure talisman, he charged out without hesitation and successfully seized it. His speed and resolve demonstrated combat instincts even more formidable than those of the sect's elite geniuses.

"Junior Brother, are you alright?" He Chuan asked with concern.

"Unharmed. The area-of-effect spells were too spread out," Li Shiming replied with a smile.

He Chuan and the other seven-sect cultivators understood that even if the spells were dispersed, ordinary body-refining cultivators couldn't have withstood them barehanded.

---

Having lost the treasure talisman and suffered backlash, the Northern Shu cultivators felt humiliated.

"Senior Brothers, we currently hold the advantage. Why not engage them in an all-out battle?" Li Shiming suggested to the seven-sect cultivators.

The seven sects had thirteen cultivators, while the Northern Shu side had only ten, including their strongest fighter, who was now seriously injured.

"We've been waiting for this!" the seven-sect cultivators replied, their fighting spirits ablaze. After being suppressed earlier, they were eager for revenge.

Li Shiming recalled his Three-Headed, Six-Armed Bronze Corpse, and the other two Profound Nether Sect cultivators did the same with theirs. The bronze corpses could be summoned at any time—it was better to deploy them when most effective.

The "Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation" remained in place as the seven-sect cultivators' safety net. If things turned dire, they could always retreat to it.

"Kill!" the seven-sect cultivators roared in unison, charging out of the formation with their artifacts and talismans at the ready, heading straight for the Northern Shu cultivators.

Li Shiming targeted the Northern Shu cultivator who had suffered backlash. A Qi Refining cultivator with a treasure talisman must have an incredibly powerful background—and thus, plenty of valuable items. Including the one he had just seized, Li Shiming now possessed three treasure talismans.

He had seen the kind of cultivators who owned such treasures: Yin Shilan's father was a Golden Core elder of the Heavenly Sea Sect, and Baili Jinyan's father was a Golden Core elder of the Sacred Ice Sect.

Seeing the seven-sect cultivators attack, the Northern Shu cultivators didn't retreat but met them head-on.

The Northern Shu cultivator Li Shiming targeted also had his eyes on Li Shiming. Even with a Golden Core elder backing him, treasure talismans were exceedingly rare. Crafting them consumed the essence of a Golden Core elder's artifact and inflicted damage on the elder themselves. No matter how indulgent an elder might be, they wouldn't give a second treasure talisman to a Qi Refining disciple.

Thus, the Northern Shu cultivator was determined to kill Li Shiming and reclaim what was his.

Both had the same idea—they coveted each other's storage bags—and so they naturally broke away from the chaotic battlefield.

Here, Li Shiming couldn't use the spiritual sense attack from the "Ice Heart Jade Thought Art." If he did, even if he defeated his opponent, Sacred Ice Sect Elder Baili would confirm that he had killed Baili Jinyan.

But he had plenty of other methods. His Jade-Breaking Sword transformed into a streak of light, shooting toward the Northern Shu cultivator.

The Northern Shu cultivator was wary of Li Shiming's Three-Headed, Six-Armed Bronze Corpse, so he wanted to finish Li Shiming quickly before he could summon it. He produced a jade seal, flipping it into the air above Li Shiming, where it transformed into a mountain of jade and crashed down.

---

Beneath the jade seal, Li Shiming felt a binding force targeting both his body and mind. Without hesitation, he pushed off the ground with his feet and dashed out of the seal's range.

Behind him, the jade seal smashed into the ground with a thunderous crash.

The Northern Shu cultivator was stunned. His jade seal was a supreme-grade artifact capable of storing vast amounts of spiritual energy in advance, ensuring a sure-hit effect. He hadn't expected Li Shiming's physique to resist the seal's physical restraint or his powerful mind to withstand its mental suppression.

Li Shiming paid no attention to the jade seal behind him. His Jade-Breaking Sword had already reached the Northern Shu cultivator.

A supreme-grade shield artifact enveloped the Northern Shu cultivator in a protective barrier. The Jade-Breaking Sword struck once, then twice, then thrice.

The Northern Shu cultivator was trying to recall his jade seal when his expression suddenly changed—his connection to the supreme-grade shield was rapidly weakening.

"Slash! Slash! Slash!" Li Shiming had experience fighting at this level with the "Sword Control Art." At full power, his sword light carried a peculiar energy due to his Sword Bone, an invasive force capable of disrupting the spiritual bond between an artifact and its owner.

The Northern Shu cultivator wanted to withdraw his shield and switch to another defensive artifact, but it was too late. Another strike severed his connection entirely.

With the shield lost, the Northern Shu cultivator suffered another backlash. Dizziness struck him, but his combat instincts kicked in—he threw himself backward as an automatic talisman activated, wrapping him in light and sending him fleeing.

Li Shiming's spiritual sense swept over the abandoned shield, storing it away, then struck the jade seal the Northern Shu cultivator hadn't had time to recall. Without its master's control, the seal's spiritual imprint was instantly erased by the sword strike.

He stored the seal and gave chase. He wasn't worried about the Northern Shu cultivator escaping—the battlefield was confined. When the fleeing cultivator reached the edge, he was blocked and forced to change direction.

Li Shiming realized the Golden Core elders had restricted entry and exit. No Qi Refining cultivator could leave until the battle was over.

---

Ahead, the fleeing Northern Shu cultivator spat another mouthful of blood due to the lost jade seal. His mind was severely wounded from successive artifact disruptions. The detour had slowed him down, and Li Shiming was now only thirty meters behind.

Gritting through the pain, the Northern Shu cultivator flung a handful of talismans behind him.

"Where do you think you're going?" Li Shiming unleashed a "Demonic Whisper."

The Northern Shu cultivator, already mentally weakened, staggered mid-flight as the whisper struck. That momentary delay was all Li Shiming needed. His sword light caught up and pierced the cultivator's back, extinguishing his life in an instant.

Li Shiming tanked the barrage of talismans with his body, then used his spiritual sense to snatch the Northern Shu cultivator's storage bracelet and corpse.

"Demonic Whisper? If I didn't know he was a Heavenly Sea Sect disciple, I'd think he was from the Profound Nether Sect," Sacred Ice Sect Elder Xie remarked, trying to stir trouble.

"He uses the 'Vajra Protection Divine Art.' Why not say he's from the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect?" Profound Nether Sect Elder Bai retorted dismissively.

Li Shiming's "Demonic Whisper" was authentic—so authentic that it proved he had obtained it legitimately. Leaked versions weren't this complete. Though "Demonic Whisper" and the "Profound Nether Corpse Refining Manual" were Profound Nether Sect secrets, over the years, fragments had likely spread to other sects.

Besides, given Elder Yin and Elder Ren's relationship, there was no issue with their son-in-law learning "Demonic Whisper." Even if he learned the rest of the Profound Nether Sect's secrets, it wouldn't be a problem.

Only a few Golden Core elders paid attention to Elder Xie and Elder Bai's exchange. Those with keener eyes were far more astonished—no, horrified.

Elder Yin, however, was delighted. While lesser Golden Core elders only noticed Li Shiming's "Demonic Whisper" and formidable "Vajra Protection Divine Art," the sharper ones saw something else: Li Shiming's "Sword Control Art" had severed the Northern Shu cultivator's control over his supreme-grade artifact in just a few strikes.

This was the critical point. As an eighth-level Qi Refining cultivator, Li Shiming's "Sword Control Art" shouldn't have been able to overpower a supreme-grade artifact so quickly. The Northern Shu cultivator was at the ninth level—his spiritual energy far surpassed Li Shiming's.

That left only one possibility, one so unbelievable that even Elder Yin and the other knowledgeable Golden Core elders hesitated to accept it.

"Did I see that right? Was that Sword Intent?" Master Duhai asked Elder Yin uncertainly.

He doubted because none of the seven sects had ever produced a true sword cultivator. It wasn't a matter of talent—the seven sects simply lacked true sword cultivation legacies. The "Sword Control Art" was but a fragment of a true sword legacy, and an insignificant one at that.

Master Duhai couldn't believe Li Shiming had grasped Sword Intent just from the Qi Refining chapter of the "Sword Control Art." Of course, Li Shiming was still far from true Sword Intent, but his sword light had carried a trace of it—enough to strip a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator of his supreme-grade artifact in moments.

Sword cultivators were famed for their "one sword breaks all techniques" philosophy, a reputation earned through countless battles. They were hailed as the most offensively potent cultivators, needing nothing but a single sword—all thanks to their terrifying Sword Intent.

Disrupting an artifact's spiritual bond was but the most basic manifestation of Sword Intent. Yet in Qi Refining battles, even a sliver of Sword Intent granted an overwhelming advantage.

"It was Sword Intent," Elder Yin confirmed calmly, though his mind raced.

Li Shiming's spiritual roots were poor, but his sword talent was extraordinary. A pity the sect lacked true sword cultivation techniques—such talent couldn't be fully nurtured.

The other Golden Core elders wore mixed expressions. Li Shiming's talent was enviable, but his low cultivation and poor spiritual roots meant he posed no threat to their sects. Still, they couldn't help but lament that such sword talent had landed on him.

---

On the four massive flying ships, the ten Northern Shu Golden Core elders wore grim expressions. The fallen cultivator was the direct descendant of one of them—his most outstanding heir—and had died right before his eyes.

Yet the elder couldn't intervene. Rules were rules, and neither side could break the agreement without triggering an all-out Golden Core battle—a decision beyond his authority.

"Sword Intent. That boy cannot be allowed to live," one elder said darkly.

Unlike the seven sects' elders, they didn't know Li Shiming's background. They assumed he was a genius nurtured by the seven sects—likely a Heavenly Spiritual Root cultivator who had grasped Sword Intent at Qi Refining. If left to grow, he'd become a significant problem.

They didn't plan to kill him immediately but noted him as a target for future missions.
