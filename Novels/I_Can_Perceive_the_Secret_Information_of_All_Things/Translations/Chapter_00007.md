# Chapter 7: Reaching Qi Refining Third Layer, Another Breakthrough  

Xiao Ji stepped out of the teahouse, mulling over the storyteller's tale.  

**"When the Nine Treasures reunite, a Sage shall emerge."**  

This meant that if the Nine Treasures were to reappear together in the world, a figure comparable to the ancient Sage who forged them would arise—one destined to save the world.  

According to the storyteller, the earliest legends of the Nine Treasures traced back to an unfathomably distant era.  

The heavens and earth cycled through periodic calamities, each catastrophe reducing the world to nothingness.  

Yet, humanity once produced a Sage—a peerless warrior who battled immortals, buddhas, gods, and demons. Before the great calamity arrived, he united celestial beings, deities, buddhas, spirits, and demons, using his own life as a catalyst to forge the Nine Treasures of Heaven and Earth. These treasures were placed in nine locations across the world to stave off the impending doom.  

Countless years passed. The world shifted, dynasties rose and fell, and the fragile alliances between the races crumbled to dust. The thunderous drums of war sounded once more...  

Xiao Ji's mind flashed with images reminiscent of a certain fantasy game's cinematic, and he shook his head to clear the thought before refocusing on the day's story.  

The greed of all living beings turned the Nine Treasures into coveted objects. Every faction and race believed they had contributed to resisting the heavenly tribulation and thus deserved possession of the treasures. They stormed forbidden zones, seizing the mighty artifacts and scattering them across the mortal realm. Blood and chaos followed, accompanied by strange and ominous phenomena.  

Amidst this turmoil, a Sword Immortal emerged. Alone, he gathered all Nine Treasures and, with the help of a master craftsman, fused them together before sealing them at the Abyss's Maw to suppress the impending catastrophe.  

Yet, the treasures had been moved, and their power was no longer what it once was. The mortal world endured three great Immortal-Demon Wars, six Demon-Monster Wars, nine Monster-Human Wars, and countless smaller conflicts, leaving the land scarred and broken.  

All beings fought for the Nine Treasures, and in the chaos, the artifacts shattered. Fragments were hidden away, and rumors spread: **"He who obtains even a single piece of any treasure shall perceive the laws of heaven and earth, wielding supreme power."**  

For cultivators, the Nine Treasures offered a path to ascension without enduring heavenly tribulation. Even a mere fragment could greatly aid one's cultivation—enough to allow even the most talentless, five-spiritual-rooted waste to transcend the Foundation Establishment stage...  

And should one obtain all the treasures? Eternal life and immunity to heavenly calamity would follow.  

As for the Sword Immortal who once guarded the Abyss's Maw? His whereabouts had long been unknown.  

Before delving into the tale of the Four-Stringed Pipa—one of the Nine Treasures—Storyteller Wan first recounted this broader history. Only then did he focus on the day's main subject: the wonders and legends surrounding the Four-Stringed Pipa.  

Regular patrons of the Fragrant Teahouse knew well that the full saga of the Nine Treasures would take at least a year or more to tell. The Four-Stringed Pipa was merely the beginning.
