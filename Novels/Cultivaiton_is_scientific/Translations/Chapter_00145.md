# Chapter 145: Assistance

Li Shiming distributed the elixirs to his fellow disciples without worrying they might affect the efficacy of the Foundation Establishment Pills. Based on his assessment, among the seven people here, it was highly unlikely any would reach late-stage Qi Refinement, let alone attempt Foundation Establishment.

The other four stared at the porcelain bottles with shining eyes. While they could exchange merit points for such cultivation resources, acquiring twenty pills would require at least ten years of hard work. Li Shiming's generosity had effectively spared them a decade of toil.

"Senior Brother, may I ask how confident you are in helping us master the 'Spring Breeze and Rain Art'?" Jin Fengzhi asked hesitantly.

"There's no guarantee. It mainly depends on yourselves—I can only provide a possibility," Li Shiming replied calmly.

Upon hearing this, the other three immediately declared, "We choose the pills!"

Jin Fengzhi remained hesitant. She understood that while the pills would save her ten years of struggle, mastering the Spirit Farmer's technique would bring far greater benefits. As a Spirit Farmer, she could earn enough to purchase these pills within three or four years. However, the uncertainty made her waver. This was her only chance—she knew Li Shiming wouldn't unconditionally help them indefinitely.

"Please help me comprehend the 'Spring Breeze and Rain Art,' Senior Brother!" Jin Fengzhi finally gritted her teeth and decided.

Becoming a Spirit Farmer might change her destiny, whereas the pills would only prolong her struggle at the bottom. Without a specialized skill, it was difficult to survive long-term in the cultivation world. She wasn't a combat-oriented cultivator and couldn't risk battling sea beasts.

"Step aside and lend me the courtyard," Li Shiming said with a smile to the other six.

The six retreated to the side with their pills, clearing the courtyard.

Li Shiming took out a set of formation flags and casually tossed them onto the ground. Though seemingly scattered, the flags mysteriously vanished as the last one landed.

"Junior Sister Jin, step into the formation and attempt the 'Spring Breeze and Rain Art,'" he instructed with a nod.

Nervously, Jin Fengzhi entered the formation, unsure if her choice was correct but determined to see it through.

Inside, she began casting the spell. She had long memorized the runes of the 'Spring Breeze and Rain Art,' but the true essence eluded her—perhaps due to talent or lack of experience. These disciples had never faced hardship; most had never even seen farmland, making it even harder to grasp the technique.

Li Shiming used an illusion formation to vividly demonstrate the true essence of the spell. Even advanced formation masters might not achieve such realistic effects—not because his skills surpassed theirs, but because he was an intermediate Spirit Farmer himself. His deep understanding of the technique's essence maximized the formation's effectiveness.

He had proposed this option to the four disciples because he was confident in its success. The pills were merely a test—what truly benefited cultivators wasn't resources but skills that ensured survival.

Jin Fengzhi felt her spirit merge with the environment. She sensed the preciousness of spring rain—the earth's nourishment, the vitality of plants. The true essence emerged from this epiphany. As she infused her runes with this understanding, they transformed into spiritual light, summoning dark clouds that released a gentle rain.

Li Shiming withdrew the formation once the rain began. Jin Fengzhi stood drenched, tears streaming down her face. After three years of waiting, she had finally become a Spirit Farmer.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" she bowed deeply after the rain ceased.

The other three who had chosen the pills now looked on with envy and regret. None had expected Li Shiming to succeed so effortlessly. Watching Jin Fengzhi's joy, their pills suddenly seemed far less appealing.

"Remember this feeling—it will help you advance to an intermediate Spirit Farmer," Li Shiming advised as he helped her up.

His illusion formation had subtly incorporated insights from his own intermediate-level comprehension. How much Jin Fengzhi could grasp depended on her own fortune.

Without lingering, Li Shiming bid farewell and left. The seven watched his departing figure, knowing this might be the last time he aided them. His assistance had nearly exhausted their bond as fellow disciples—unless they could offer something of equal value, they couldn't expect further help.

Jin Fengzhi resolved to warn her family about Li Shiming's status in the sect. As fellow natives of Great Xia, her royal family must avoid offending his mortal relatives—any conflict would reflect poorly on her.

Time passed quietly in cultivation. A year had gone by since his clone left the Machine Room Space, and Li Shiming's fears about the Holy Ice Sect discovering it never materialized. Apart from the consumed drop of essence blood, all traces of Baili Jinyan had been erased.

With his clone, Li Shiming gained more time to pursue his interests. His exchanges with Yin Shilan had evolved into one-sided guidance—his mastery of formations now far surpassed hers. Unbeknownst to others, his Starlight Sea of formations had transformed into a rotating galaxy over the past year. Each point of light connected mystically, mirroring the cosmic principles of the universe.

His greatest progress, however, wasn't in formations but his cultivation—he had reached the peak of the sixth layer of Qi Refinement and would soon attempt the late stage. His clone-assisted cultivation had accelerated his progress dramatically.

While some in the sect questioned his rapid advancement, those in power dismissed their concerns—his relationship with Yin Shilan, a Golden Core cultivator's daughter, explained everything.

As Li Shiming multitasked—sipping spirit tea while crafting formation flags—his identity jade slip suddenly vibrated intensely, emitting a dazzling light.

"An emergency summons!" This was his first in four years.

Without hesitation, he recalled his clone and flew toward the sect via his secret passage. He no longer relied on the Black Sparrow Wings; at his current level, the Jadebreaker Sword sufficed for thousand-mile flights.

Upon arriving, he found the sect undisturbed. But at the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion, Elder Zhuge was already waiting with Yin Shilan.

"Shiming, the sect originally intended to keep you within its bounds until you reached late-stage Qi Refinement. But this situation is exceptional—we need your help," Elder Zhuge said gravely.

"I'm willing to serve the sect," Li Shiming replied earnestly.

"I'm coming too. Board the flying boat," Elder Zhuge said, summoning a vessel.

Once aboard, the boat sped toward the Heavenly Sea Defense Line. Li Shiming deduced their destination—the Seven Stars Island.

"Shilan, weren't you preparing for seclusion?" Li Shiming whispered.

She had mentioned adjusting her mindset for a breakthrough attempt in the sect's specialized闭关室 (seclusion chamber), designed to enhance success rates for critical advancements.

"I don't know either," Yin Shilan replied, blushing at his use of her pet name "Lan'er." Only those closest to her addressed her so intimately.

"Will this mission be dangerous? You must be careful," Li Shiming frowned, more concerned for her safety than his own.

Elder Zhuge coughed lightly. "Stay by my side—you'll be safe."

As the boat raced over the Heavenly Sea Defense Line, Li Shiming asked, "Where are we going? Past here is..."

"Surprised you recognize this area. We're heading to Seven Stars Island," Elder Zhuge replied, curious about Li Shiming's familiarity with such dangerous waters.
