# Chapter 17: Returning to the Family

"Many thanks, Elder. This price is acceptable to me."

"Excellent. I'll call Qing'er back to complete the transaction with you. Young Friend Qin, should you acquire any rare materials in the future, don't hesitate to come find me. I assure you the price will be fair."

"I appreciate your kindness, Elder. I'll certainly bring any materials here in the future."

Soon, Qing'er returned and led Qin Chong to complete the transaction. However, Qin Chong didn't leave immediately. Instead, he had Qing'er introduce him to some mid-grade magical artifacts. He then purchased a mid-grade Silver Frost Sword for 450 spirit stones, along with several mid-tier talismans.

By the time Qin Chong left the Green Cloud Pavilion, only about a hundred of his three thousand low-grade spirit stones remained. Yet, he felt it was all worth it.

That evening, Qin Chong arrived early at the Fragrant Tower, only to find Zhao Yin had arrived even earlier.

"Qin boy, over here!" Zhao Yin called out as soon as Qin Chong entered.

They sat in a small private room near the street, its door offering a direct view of the entrance. The table was already laden with fine wine and delicacies.

"Old Zhao, you certainly know how to live."

"Heh, although we cultivators can abstain from food, wouldn't it be a shame to miss out on such worldly pleasures?"

"Haha, indeed, indeed."

Once seated, Qin Chong dug in without hesitation. Perhaps because it had been so long since he'd eaten, the sight of the feast made his mouth water. In no time, he had devoured nearly half the dishes.

"Boy, you eat like a starving ghost!"

"It's been ages since I've tasted such delicacies. How could I resist such temptation?"

"Hahaha!"

Soon, the table was nearly cleared. As they paused, Qin Chong was about to ask about the incident at Great Cang Mountain when Zhao Yin spoke first.

"Stubborn brat, I knew you wouldn't let it go. You want to know why I warned you after leaving Gourd Valley, don't you?"

"Heh, since you know I'm persistent, stop beating around the bush and tell me."

"You crafty little... I'm more curious how you survived. Didn't you encounter anything unusual?"

"I heeded your warning and hid in a secluded spot for over three months before emerging."

"Ah, with that much time, it's possible to escape safely."

"And you? Did you hide as well?"

"Hmph, with my late-stage Qi Refining cultivation, even if I couldn't win, escaping was well within my abilities."

"Don't change the subject. Just tell me what really happened."

"It's simple. The disciples of Canglong Valley often use their sect's reputation to conscript rogue cultivators or those from minor families to help with sect missions. Over time, some grew envious and began taking advantage, leading to banditry. Of course, opportunists soon joined the fray. In the end, it all comes down to those spirit stones."

Qin Chong frowned slightly. The old man's words were vague and roundabout, but he could read between the lines. Zhao Yin was clearly avoiding direct speech, yet the clues were evident. It seemed he feared repercussions and thus spoke ambiguously.

This confirmed Qin Chong's earlier suspicions. The attackers might not have all been from the Qingxuan Sect. The severity of the situation depended on subsequent news—whether the three Canglong Valley disciples had perished.

Changing the subject, they chatted awhile before Qin Chong left to return to his inn. Before departing, however, he managed to wheedle a jade slip titled "Catalog of Elementary Spiritual Materials" from Zhao Yin. He had spotted it earlier at Zhao Yin's stall but held off buying it when the old man invited him to the Fragrant Tower. Private deals were always cheaper than stall purchases, and Qin Chong suspected Zhao Yin had made numerous copies of the slip—a highly profitable venture.

Still, Qin Chong paid sixty spirit stones for it, believing it well worth the price. The catalog documented not only spiritual plants and minerals but also various spiritual beasts, birds, and insects, covering a vast range with rich detail. Though limited to elementary spiritual materials, it included resources relevant to both Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages.

After a few more days in the city, Qin Chong departed Pingyang City and headed toward his family's territory. The Qin residence lay over two hundred li away, a distance his current speed could cover quickly. However, halfway there, he abandoned flight and continued on foot.

He needed to suppress his cultivation level to avoid drawing attention. His rapid progress would raise suspicions if discovered. Though he trusted his family, he couldn't risk revealing any secrets. Even the slightest clue could bring trouble not only to himself but also to his family.

The Qin family's residence was nestled against Mount Xiao, earning them the name "Xiao Mountain Qins." According to Qin Chong's knowledge, the Qins became a cultivation family over three hundred years ago. Legend told of a poor scholar named Qin Tian who chanced upon the path of cultivation. Limited by his aptitude and lacking greater opportunities, he eventually plateaued at late-stage Qi Refining. After decades of wandering, he returned to his family in seclusion, only to discover several children with spiritual roots among them. Thus, he passed down his cultivation methods, and through generations, the Qin family grew into what it was today.

The family's first Foundation Establishment cultivator emerged only decades ago—Qin Chong's granduncle Qin Feng. His father, Qin Hao, was the family's second Foundation Establishment cultivator. In terms of strength, the Qins were respectable, but their shallow foundation and lack of powerful backing kept them confined to minor family status.

When he was thirty or forty li from home, Qin Chong suppressed his cultivation back to the third layer of Qi Refining, slightly higher than when he had left. In doing so, he discovered another function of the Eight Trigrams Mirror's space—his excess spiritual power could be stored within it, specifically in the pale yellow soil that purified spirit stones. Initially worried the soil might absorb his power permanently, repeated tests reassured him.

With this feature, concealing his cultivation would be even easier. Whether it could fool a Foundation Establishment cultivator remained to be tested upon his return.

As Qin Chong stepped into the family compound, two youths approached him.
