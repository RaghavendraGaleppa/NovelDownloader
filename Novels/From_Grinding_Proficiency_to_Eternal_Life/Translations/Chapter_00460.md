# Chapter 460: The Black Hand

Anger-Filled Arhat's forehead bulged with veins as he slammed his vajra into the ground. "This demon actually shows such cowardice in battle!"

Dragon-Taming Arhat's eyebrows twitched slightly, but he said nothing more.

If the Primordial Demon Sect were truly filled with cowardly warriors as Anger-Filled Arhat claimed, how could they have turned the Northern Continent into an impenetrable fortress?

Over these years, the Primordial Demon Sect had advanced step by step, not only firmly controlling the Northern Continent but also forging it into an iron fortress. During the last great heavenly tribulation, even the combined forces of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Bodhi Pure Land had been unable to shake it in the slightest.

Anger-Filled Arhat's angry words actually confirmed that the disciples of the Primordial Demon Sect were by no means cowardly warriors.

Xu Yunfan was an even greater anomaly within the Primordial Demon Sect.

According to intelligence gathered over recent days, this man was not only meticulous and cunning, but more importantly, deeply understood the way of biding one's time.

He could lie dormant at Hundred Desires Peak for many years, quietly waiting for the right moment, while also reading the situation and revealing his edge at critical times.

He had been sent to guard Cold Crow Pass precisely because he was chosen for his extraordinary patience and composure.

Moreover, his attainment in array formations—being able to instantly modify the Seven Furies of the Netherworld Array—made Dragon-Taming Arhat extremely wary. This fellow had not only cultivated the True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra to the point of entering the three昧, but also possessed such skill in array formations.

Naturally, this made him feel extremely troublesome to deal with.

Compassionate Navigation Arhat's white brows furrowed slightly. "It seems the Primordial Demon Sect sent him to guard Cold Crow Pass precisely because of his cunning nature."

Dragon-Taming Arhat sat in meditation, the dragon patterns on his neck flickering. "His attainment in array formations far exceeds expectations—he was actually able to instantly modify the Seven Furies of the Netherworld Array."

A hint of wariness flashed in his eyes. "What's even more troublesome is that True Martial Sword..."

"Don't worry, Senior Brother."

Anger-Filled Arhat suddenly revealed a ferocious smile. "Since he's been sent to the border pass, he'll eventually have to leave it. When that time comes, the three of us Arhats will join forces..."

Compassionate Navigation Arhat sighed and joined his palms together. "Amitabha, the demonic path's fortune has added another beast to its ranks. The day of peace under heaven will likely be pushed even further back."

The three figures gradually faded into the mountain mist, leaving only Dragon-Taming Arhat's final whisper drifting in the wind: "Since the True Martial Sword has appeared... this conflict of Dao must eventually be settled through battle..."

"Senior, are you really not going to take a look?"

Listening to Zhou Lu's respectful inquiry, Xu Yunfan didn't even lift his eyelids, saying calmly: "You may go on your own."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's indifferent expression, Zhou Lu grew anxious inwardly but didn't dare show it, forcing a smile as he said: "Senior, although the medicinal garden of that Heavenly Pill Elder has been abandoned for many years, it was left behind by a Foundation Establishment cultivator. There might still be rare spiritual herbs, or even pill refinement inheritance. If you would be willing to personally make a trip, we could also benefit..."

Xu Yunfan slightly raised his eyelids, sweeping him with a half-smiling, half-mocking glance as he said淡淡ly: "Oh? You're quite well-informed."

He wasn't surprised. Zhou Lu had been stationed at Cold Crow Pass for decades—the surrounding terrain had surely been explored completely by them.

As for that so-called Heavenly Pill Elder.

To be honest, given the nature of those Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Primordial Origin Sect, while there were many sects belonging to their forces within the Northern Continent besides the Primordial Origin Sect itself, if there were truly such a cave dwelling of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, there would definitely be Foundation Establishment cultivators going to "collect autumn taxes."

How could Zhou Lu possibly get the chance?

Zhou Lu's heart chilled as he quickly lowered his head. "I wouldn't dare hide anything from you, Senior. This matter was discovered a few days ago from some wandering cultivators—they found fluctuations from restrictions at the edge of the medicinal garden but didn't dare go deeper. We thought it over—if there's no Foundation Establishment cultivator standing guard, going there recklessly would likely lead to disaster..."

Xu Yunfan's fingers lightly tapped the table, inwardly sneering.

"The Heavenly Pill Elder's medicinal garden? Hmph, quite a coincidence."

He had studied array formations and artifact refining for many years and naturally understood the value of pill refinement inheritance.

If he had the attribute panel to assist, the path of pill refinement might not be impossible to master quickly.

But Dragon-Taming Arhat was currently staring like a tiger outside Cold Crow Pass. If he left the pass recklessly, he would definitely be ambushed.

"Zhou Lu, this old man, has always been cautious—why would he suddenly bring this up?"

Xu Yunfan's eyes turned cold as he already had his suspicions.

"Someone must be secretly stirring the karma, guiding his mind, trying to lure me out of the pass."

Although he didn't say it outright, given Zhou Lu's cultivation level and status, there was no way he would proactively suggest exploring a Foundation Establishment cultivator's ruins.

Unless...

There was another Foundation Establishment cultivator plotting behind the scenes, or perhaps someone within the Primordial Demon Sect wanted to use a knife to kill someone.

"Using a knife to kill someone? Or testing?"

His gaze gradually turned cold.

The Primordial Demon Sect was not a unified iron plate. The sect's higher-ups were divided into factions, and because the True Martial Sword had appeared, he had already become the target of many.

Now that Dragon-Taming Arhat had suddenly blocked the pass, the timing was too coincidental—someone must have leaked his whereabouts.

"It seems it's not just the Buddhist sect watching me..."

Ever since he revealed his Dao Foundation, there had been many within the sect who coveted his Divine Martial Dao Foundation.

The True Lords naturally wouldn't care about it, but those Foundation Establishment cultivators with no prospects of advancing had schemes—after all, this was an empty Golden Nature within the Divine Martial Realm.

Naturally, many would come sniffing around.

Although they didn't dare openly seize it due to fear of the Primordial Demon Sect's rules, they could secretly arrange things to lure him out of the pass, then use the Buddhist sect's hand to eliminate him.

Such calculations fit the style of those beasts in the Primordial Demon Sect perfectly.

This was basic operation.

"Want to make me a scapegoat?"

Under normal circumstances, a mere Foundation Establishment medicinal garden might be worth exploring, but with Dragon-Taming Arhat showing his head and staring like a tiger, leaving the pass recklessly would be like throwing himself into a trap.

Seeing Xu Yunfan remain silent, Zhou Lu试探道: "If Senior is unwilling to personally go, why not bestow a few protective talismans? We could explore on our own, and seventy percent of what we find would go to you..."

Xu Yunfan sneered: "You're quite the planner."

Zhou Lu forced a smile, not daring to respond.

Xu Yunfan's fingers paused as he said indifferent: "This matter need not be mentioned again. The situation outside Cold Crow Pass is unclear, and this seat will not leave the pass easily. As for that Heavenly Pill Garden..."

His eyes grew profound, "If there truly is opportunity, we can explore it after the situation stabilizes in the future."

Zhou Lu felt disappointed but didn't dare say more,只得恭敬道: "Yes, Senior is wise."

After Zhou Lu withdrew, the coldness in Xu Yunfan's eyes intensified.

He didn't出手 to clear Zhou Lu's mind, just calmly watched the other party's retreating figure disappear from his sight.

"Someone really can't sit still anymore..."

He sneered inwardly.

"Want to lure me out of the pass? Hmph, let's see who's pulling the strings behind the scenes."

Zhou Lu had just stepped out of Xu Yunfan's cave dwelling when he suddenly felt his mind go blank, and his steps involuntarily faltered.

He subconsciously supported himself against the stone wall, cold sweat beading on his forehead as the scene of his own reckless words just now suddenly surfaced in his mind.

"How could I be so reckless?"

His heart pounded as he belatedly realized something was wrong.

As an old cultivator who had been struggling at Cold Crow Pass for decades, he had always been best at reading the situation.

Although the Heavenly Pill Garden was tempting, given his cautious nature and his current status and cultivation level, he should have first sent people to investigate the reality before slowly planning.

But just now, he had somehow directly encouraged a Foundation Establishment cultivator to take risks, even proposing such presumptuous conditions as "seventy percent of the profits"...

"Something's not right!"
