# Chapter 67: How Could It Be That Easy?

For example, evil cultivators can obtain cultivation resources through slaughter, and also acquire various materials. Besides the remains of beast cultivators, the corpses of human cultivators are also common materials for refining many spirit artifacts. Even if someone isn't an evil cultivator and doesn't practice evil cultivation techniques, in this Huqing Realm where there is no law to speak of, it's hard to guarantee that incidents of murder for treasure won't occur.

Ding Rui was naturally terrified of losing his life. He wanted to live well, not to constantly dance on the edge of life and death, nor to waltz on a knife's edge. He was extremely grateful to have transmigrated into the Sect Domain, rather than any other part of this world. If it were anywhere outside this Sect Domain where he had lived for several years, Ding Rui felt he basically wouldn't trust any cultivator he met.

"Senior Brother, do you have any Pulse-Connecting Flower seeds here?" Ding Rui asked the cultivator in the logistics department.

"No problem!" Ding Rui agreed, then took the seeds and instructions back to the spirit field. After reviewing them, he directly sowed the seeds.

Planting Pulse-Connecting Flowers was actually not much different from planting Spirit Rice. Both required the simultaneous application of the Five Elements cultivation methods for their processing and cultivation.

However, there was a crucial point: due to the inherent characteristics of the Pulse-Connecting Flower, the speed at which true essence flowed within it was much faster. This led to many problems.

For instance, the aphids that grew on the Pulse-Connecting Flowers had, out of habit, evolved to become more adapted and faster. More importantly, their reaction speed was astonishingly quick, making it difficult for cultivators who hadn't fully adapted to catch them. The task of pest control alone would be much harder than with Spirit Rice.

Imagine aphids swimming freely and effortlessly within the Pulse-Connecting Flowers, occasionally making emergency turns, while the spirit field cultivator's Golden Ray Spear could only follow behind. Perhaps the speed wouldn't be too far off, but they would often be affected by inertia due to unfamiliarity, unable to turn smoothly. How could one kill pests like that? How could one kill all the pests on an entire field of Pulse-Connecting Flowers?

Ding Rui felt he couldn't think of any good way to solve this problem. So he didn't dwell on it too much. After all, any solution he came up with would be for other cultivators; he himself wouldn't need it.

Therefore, the soil needed to be loosened to a greater depth. This was troublesome for Ding Rui. Because the loosening depth of the Earth Qi Hoe was limited; at its deepest, it could only submerge the hoe head, which was completely insufficient for the Pulse-Connecting Flower's needs.

However, Ding Rui wasn't worried. The book stated that Pulse-Connecting Flowers needed two months to reach their rapid growth stage, at which point more intensive soil loosening would be required. Their initial growth rate was very slow. And if nothing unexpected happened, Ding Rui believed he would be able to free up four skill slots in half a month. By then, he could totally condense a soil-loosening skill to handle the subsequent rapid growth phase of the Pulse-Connecting Flowers.

This problem would also be a headache for other cultivators. Such deep soil loosening would undoubtedly slow down the cultivators' work speed considerably.

The last point concerned the *Azure Wood Art*.

Refining Pulse-Connecting Pills only required pollen from the Pulse-Connecting Flower's blooms, so the flower could not be allowed to bear fruit. It had to be kept in a perpetual state of flowering. After the Pulse-Connecting Flower matured, the *Azure Wood Art* had to be continuously used to absorb its spiritual energy, thereby maintaining its flowering state and preventing its internal energy from being sufficient to support fruit production.
