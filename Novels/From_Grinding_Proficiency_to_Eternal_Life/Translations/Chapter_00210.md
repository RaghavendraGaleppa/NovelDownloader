# Chapter 210: Divine Weapon Ridge Thirty Miles Away

Xu Yunfan estimated that the two opponents were merely experts who had just entered or achieved minor success in the Blood Transformation Realm.

They dared to charge at him without even using their divine weapon, the Golden Gorge.

How foolish.

Then there was the Lin State. Since stepping into the Muscle Refining Realm, the duration he could maintain the Lin State had increased significantly. With his current strength, he could sustain it for half a cup of tea's time without damaging his body.

It was just that his bones and muscles felt somewhat sore.

Looking at the two men, barely breathing after being struck by his two heavy hammers, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh at the terrifying vitality of Blood Transformation experts. Even after suffering such a devastating attack, they could still forcibly hold onto that last breath and stubbornly refuse to die.

For such freaks with monstrous vitality, the only way to stop them was probably to smash their heads to pieces.

Just as he was pondering this, he heard the sound of rapid charging from the distance. Xu Yunfan hooked the old man's heavy sword with his toe. The meteorite iron blade spun three times in his palm before he suddenly threw it toward the southeast.

As the blade tore through the night sky, from three hundred paces away, the direction of Divine Weapon Ridge传来 the neighing of warhorses. The flying sword, infused with the Red Serpent Mountain Crushing Strength, nailed three heavily armored warhorses to an ancient locust tree by the official road.

The beautiful woman lying nearby suddenly tore open her clothes, and a compass on her chest emitted a flash of silver light.

Seven bone-piercing needles shot out from the compass, the golden silkworm threads attached to their tails weaving a sky-trapping net in the night.

This was the woman's desperate killing move, "Blood Embroidery of Rivers and Mountains." Each golden silkworm thread was refined with Miao region poisons, specifically designed to break internal strength and hard body techniques.

"Here they come! I've been watching you."

He mainly wanted to interrogate them about how they had tracked him. After all, with his hunting skills, he was quite confident in his ability to conceal his movements.

Now that they could still unleash such formidable power, he immediately abandoned that thought.

Xu Yunfan's arm muscles suddenly contracted by two inches. The unique "Bone Shrinking and Force Unloading" of the玄钢百锻身 (Mysterious Steel Hundred-Forged Body) allowed the golden silkworm net to graze past his skin.

He stomped his right foot, shattering the green bricks beneath. Moving like a shadow, fragments of bricks infused with the Red Serpent Mountain Crushing Strength shot out like a meteor shower, pinning the golden silkworm net to the tattered statue of Weituo.

The beautiful woman, whose fingers had already been twisted out of shape by the heavy hammer, danced as she manipulated the threads. The entire dilapidated temple suddenly trembled like a marionette, and the rotten beams and pillars were pulled toward the young man by the golden silkworms.

Xu Yunfan's pupils reflected the shower of wooden debris, a mocking curl at the corner of his mouth.

"If you had used this move in your peak state, I would have given you some leeway..."

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer spun like a windmill in his palm. The fifth form of the Thousand-Jun Mountain Crushing Hammer Method, "Cloud Gate Locking the Mountain," suddenly changed into the seventh form, "Eagle's Beak Shattering the Rock." When the hammer head struck the first beam, nine layers of spiral force exploded along the wood grain, and the entire beam instantly turned into three thousand wooden spikes that shot back.

The beautiful woman shrieked, attempting to block, but found her body was already ruined, unable to summon any strength. She could only rely on the golden threads bursting from the compass on her chest. However, she saw Xu Yunfan already stepping on the flying wooden spikes into the air.

The young man's spine, like a great dragon, compressed to its limit like a spring. The force accumulated in the arches of his feet by the Red Serpent Mountain Crushing Strength was released with a roar.

This leap actually broke through the roof tiles. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, leveraging the downward momentum, swung out a perfect arc. Before the hammer even arrived, the wind pressure had already crushed the green bricks on the ground into dust.

The old man suddenly burst from the pool of blood, his shattered spine making a rattling sound like a snake hissing.

He bit off his tongue and spat a blood arrow. His right arm, driven by the Northern Region Blood Burning Secret Technique, swelled three times in size. He gripped the twisted short sword at his waist and劈出 the strongest sword strike of his life.

The moment the sword edge tore through the night, it even burned a scorched smell in the rain. This was the "Blood Burning Sword Gang," the culmination of his lifelong Blood Transformation Realm cultivation.

The shockwave from the collision of hammer and sword shattered every window frame in the dilapidated temple.

The blood from Xu Yunfan's split虎口 (tiger's mouth) hadn't even fallen when the Mysterious Steel Hundred-Forged Body had already stimulated the muscles and tendons around the wound to close.

He suddenly let go of the hammer handle, allowing the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer to be knocked flying by the sword gang, while his palms, like iron pincers, clamped onto the old man's wrist pulse.

The Red Serpent Mountain Crushing Strength surged up the enemy's meridians in reverse, shattering the old man's arm bone into seventeen pieces.

It was at this moment that the beautiful woman's golden silkworm net wrapped around Xu Yunfan's neck.

She grinned ferociously as she pulled the threads, only to find that the muscles and tendons on the young man's neck were glowing with a meteorite iron luster. The Red Serpent Mountain Crushing Strength was counter-attacking along the golden silkworm threads.

Xu Yunfan's neck suddenly twisted to the right. The moment the golden silkworm threads cut three-tenths of an inch into his flesh, the entire poison net was flung into the air by his brute force.

"Die!"

With a furious roar, Xu Yunfan grabbed the golden silkworm threads around his neck, his waist and hips turning like a millstone, trembling.

As the beautiful woman was flung off the ground, the young man took three steps, stretching the golden silkworm threads wrapped around his body taut like the strings of a zither.

When the ninth step was taken, the frequency of the string's vibration resonated with the tremor of his footwork. The remaining pillars of the dilapidated temple exploded in response.

The old man struggled to throw the half-blade, but Xu Yunfan easily caught the flying sword with two fingers.

The Red Serpent Mountain Crushing Strength exploded between his fingers, pressing a pattern onto the meteorite iron blade.

His counter-throw was as fast as lightning. The残剑 (broken sword) pierced through the beautiful woman's琵琶骨 (pipa bone), pinning her to the demon-subduing pestle in the hands of the shattered Weituo statue.

The night grew even deeper.

Xu Yunfan picked up the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, the hammer head dragging sparks on the ground as he strode towards the two.

"Wait, wait! I know the maps of the Great乾 (Qian) army, why they are here..."

"I know of an unknown秘境 (secret realm) in the Northern Region. Entering it is most likely a blessing..."

Before they could finish speaking, two heavy hammers fell hard upon them.

Thud! Thud!

Looking at the two mounds of flesh before him, Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath.

If you can still live after this, I'll immediately kowtow and call you both father!

Now, without using the divine weapon Golden Gorge, he could already hammer to death those with minor success in Blood Transformation. If it were someone with major success, he would need the aid of a divine weapon and be in the Lin State to fight and win, and then kill.

'You have successfully killed a formidable enemy. Your proficiency in the Thousand-Jun Mountain Crushing Hammer Method has increased.'

'You have successfully...'

Not bad. Two lines of proficiency increased his skill in the Thousand-Jun Mountain Crushing Hammer Method by eight points.

As Xu Yunfan shook off the blood and flesh clinging to his hammer, his ear suddenly捕捉到 (captured) a disturbance in the wind.

The northwest wind carried a scorched smell past the tip of his nose, a unique scent of burning pine resin mixed with oil. He looked to the side. Thirty miles away, in the direction of Divine Weapon Ridge, the night sky had been stained a dark red.

"Senior Brother!"

The sound from Divine Weapon Ridge, a roar that seemed to crack the clouds and shatter stones, pierced the night sky, causing Xu Yunfan's pupils to contract sharply.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was slung behind his back, the mechanism opening layer by layer to fix it firmly in place.

The unique force-unloading technique of the Mysterious Steel Hundred-Forged Body now transformed into a charging method. Combined with the lightness technique of the Flying Hair Legs, the tendons and membranes in his foot arches trembled thirteen times like a strong bow, each step carrying the sound of wind and thunder.

The bluestone official road exploded beneath his feet, the flying gravel leaving a sky full of dust behind him.

A watchtower five miles away suddenly lit up with torches. The archers guarding the checkpoints set up by the Great乾 army hadn't even nocked their arrows when Xu Yunfan had already crashed through the wooden fence like a chariot.

Like a rampaging battlefield, Xu Yunfan simply used his shoulder as an arrow. As his shoulder blades shifted, he sent three heavily armored soldiers flying.

Broken chain mail fragments embedded in the gatehouse pillars,恰好 (coincidentally) jamming the falling thousand-jin gate.

"Enemy attack!!"
