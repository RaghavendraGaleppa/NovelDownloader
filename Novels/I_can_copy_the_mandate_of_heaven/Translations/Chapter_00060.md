## Chapter 60: Teaching

Sitting in a quiet room within the Xuanzi Gate, Li Zhiming took a deep breath, gazing at the people before him. Two-thirds of them had their life grids exposed to him, their faces filled with genuine trust, respect, and gratitude towards him, a young medical practitioner.

"You all rest well here. If you need anything, I'll have someone bring it to you," Li Zhiming said, his voice firm and gentle.

He spent about half an hour chatting with the Xuanzi Gate's martial artists before leaving. The feeling of being trusted still lingered, making him feel elated. He glanced at his own life grid and was amazed at the numerous "sword techniques" he had mastered.

In just half a day, it seemed like he had practiced martial arts for over a hundred years. The various techniques had become second nature to him. He had acquired three more "absolute skills" and countless other martial arts techniques from the forty or so Xuanzi Gate martial artists. Over two-thirds of them had opened up their life grids to him.

These white life grid martial artists had spent twenty-odd years honing their skills, braving the elements, and now Li Zhiming had gained access to their expertise. He had mastered three absolute skills, including "Toxic Snake Breath," and around forty other techniques, making up a quarter of the Xuanzi Gate's total martial arts repertoire.

If one were to consider his own abilities, Li Zhiming had already reached the level of a master, rivalling those above him. If he also counted his "Fast Knife King" and "Demon Silver Hand," at the age of twelve, there were few within the Qixuan Gate who could surpass him.

In a different location, Su Zongguang, the leader of the Haisha Gang, was processing various pieces of information in a quiet study. As a leader of a triad, Su Zongguang faced immense pressure due to the disarray and conflicts within the organization.

He was reviewing a piece of intelligence regarding the Qixuan Gate's young medical practitioner. 

"Seven玄Gate luckily acquired a divine doctor and now a 12-year-old prodigy doctor?"

The intelligence report stated that under the care of this young prodigy, forty-odd severely injured individuals had miraculously recovered without a single casualty. It was said that the young doctor's medical skills had already surpassed his mentor, Mo Dafu.

Su Zongguang's palm struck the desk. This was a valuable asset. He couldn't let such a talent die. He decided to make an effort to win him over.

He pondered, if the young doctor couldn't be bought with money or beauty, perhaps a different approach was needed. 

Su Zongguang recalled that after the death of the Ghost Hand, a thirteen-year-old girl with exceptional medical skills and beauty had been left behind. He thought about arranging a meeting between the young doctor and this girl.

Back at the drug valley, after the patients had recovered, a period of relative calm ensued. Li Zhiming spent his days researching his mentor's "Mafei San" and preparing to practice the "Seven Elephants Technique."

When the time was right, Li Zhiming called for Jiang Yun.

"Little master," she greeted, curtsying.

Li Zhiming looked at her life grid; she had a green life grid - [Early Wisdom Woman].

Li Zhiming sighed. Despite his efforts, his life grid remained white, while Jiang Yun's was already green.

"Jiang Yun sister," Li Zhiming said with a genuine smile.

"I plan to teach you medical skills."

Jiang Yun was taken aback but quickly responded with a curtsy, "It's all up to the young master's instructions."
