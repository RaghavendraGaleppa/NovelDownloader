# Chapter 67: Departure!

Zhou Tian only regretted that this was Prince Xiaoyao's manor, densely covered with formations, making it impossible to use a projection array to record the current scene.

"You spend every day at the Dance Heaven Pavilion, and now you're telling me you're still a virgin?"

Zhou Tian wore a look that was hard to describe; he simply didn't believe in the existence of anyone like Liu Xiahui (a legendary chaste man).

"Are you… incapable?"

"How could that be? What I pull out is bigger than yours!"

The duration of [Sacred Edict] had passed. Zhou Zui had recovered from his previous state, staring at Zhou Tian, seemingly pondering how to strike him down before anyone could rescue him, thus silencing him and preserving the secret.

Noticing Zhou Tian's confusion, Zhou Zui gave a bitter smile and explained, "The cultivation conditions for the Sacred Law of Seven Emotions and Six Desires are extremely strict. The greater the emotional fluctuations and inner desires, the faster one cultivates. So..."

Zhou Tian nodded, indicating understanding. Indeed, there shouldn't be a time when desire is stronger than during an erection. Moreover, it can only be cultivated during that state; afterwards, one becomes as pure as a Buddha, with no desire left. How could one cultivate then?

"But how did you hold back? I don't believe your self-control is that strong..."

Zhou Tian posed a new question. He didn't believe Zhou Zui could hold back under those circumstances.

"This brings us to the Sacred Law Tribulation."

"Sacred Law Tribulation? That Banished Immortal seemed to mention it..."

Zhou Tian recalled that during his confrontation with Zhou Zui yesterday, the Banished Immortal had indeed mentioned this so-called tribulation.

Zhou Zui didn't care anymore. Since Zhou Tian already knew his biggest secret, the rest was just trivial. He organized his thoughts and began to speak. "My tribulation is... Liu Yan. It's also thanks to her that I managed to stop at the last moment. This involves very complex profound principles; I imagine you wouldn't want to hear about them, would you?"

"Your tribulation is Liu Yan? You're not going to have to kill your sister to prove the Dao, are you?"

When Zhou Tian heard that this so-called tribulation was Liu Yan, his mind instantly recalled all sorts of melodramatic plots from novels in his previous life, conjuring up forty-eight different scenarios. After all, isn't a love tribulation usually resolved by ultimately killing the other party?

"Where did you hear all that?" Zhou Zui saw Zhou Tian's gradually perverse smile and said helplessly, "Calling it a tribulation is actually also calling it an aid. It's hard to explain clearly to you without cultivation, as it involves matters of the heart realm."

"What, you've cultivated a sense of superiority now, virgin bro?" Zhou Tian glanced at Zhou Zui.

"Brother, how could I dare? But please, don't tell anyone about this..." Zhou Zui, with a fawning expression, leaned over and begged. If this matter were to spread, what would become of his reputation as Prince Xiaoyao's heir? Going to the Dance Heaven Pavilion every day not to seek pleasure but merely to comfort those young ladies? He wouldn't even believe it himself!

An hour later, Zhou Tian emerged from Prince Xiaoyao's manor, refreshed and invigorated. After signing a series of unequal treaties with Zhou Zui, they reached an agreement: Zhou Tian would temporarily keep his secret.

Three more boring days passed. While Zhou Tian was idle, the others were busy preparing. Unlike Zhou Tian, they possessed Dharma Aspect realm cultivation, allowing them to bear Sacred King-grade weapons. However, they could only bear one; otherwise, the weapon would drain them to death. To "bear" meant to temporarily wield the weapon to unleash one or two attacks. Like Tian Ling, having a Sacred King artifact inside one's body but being unable to use it was not considered bearing it. They were all from powerful noble families, so Sacred King artifacts were not scarce for them. Along with other miscellaneous items, they had much to prepare. Zhou Tian, however, was different from the other flamboyant types. He had no spiritual power whatsoever and couldn't use anything, so he didn't need to prepare at all.

This was the day they were scheduled to depart. Although there was still nearly half a month until the official start of the event, factoring in the time to cross the spatial turbulence, they only needed to reach the departure point within a week. The departure point was a city built outside the Ninth Province, from where they would then travel to the Ninth Province. However, there was nothing much happening in the Imperial Capital right now, so Emperor Qin allowed them to depart early. Many people from other forces had already gone, waiting there for the rest of the Tianqin contingent.

This time, it wasn't just the younger generation from the Imperial Capital who were going to the Ninth Province for the Eight Provinces Grand Competition. There were also other forces from Futian Province. After all, the news of "Heaven's Mandate" appearing in the Ninth Province had spread, and its allure was terrifyingly immense, making everyone want to try their luck. Other regions did not have direct teleportation arrays to the departure point; they could only use the Imperial Capital's array. Thus, young talents from various places would continuously arrive at the Imperial Capital. For Zhou Tian and the others, waiting anywhere was the same. Since they were idle in the Imperial Capital, they might as well go to the departure city first to observe the Heaven's Chosen from other forces.

Originally, Zhou Tian had wanted to wait for Tian Ling to arrive and go together. However, after thinking about it, waiting anywhere was the same, so it was better to go with Zhou Xunchuan and the others to scout ahead.

This teleportation array was clearly different from others Zhou Tian had seen. Its central array platform alone was three zhang high, not to mention the dense golden patterns covering a hundred zhang. Accompanying them were Zhou Tian's second elder brother, Zhou Ying; the Second Prince, Zhou Yan; Wei Chuan, the son of the Southern Border Grand General Wei Yan; and Wu Hong, the eldest son of Marquis Tianshi, who was also Wu's elder brother. Zhou Tian had met all these individuals at the banquet that day and could even recall their names. The remaining people stayed in the Imperial Palace. Zhou Tian guessed they were still discussing ways to deal with the newly discovered world.

This newly discovered world was indeed attracting the attention of many forces. Originally, Zhou Ying and the others had returned because the Youth Competition needed some serious contenders to hold the fort, and also to suppress the high-end combat power of the Ninth Province during the Eight Provinces Grand Competition. As a result of this newly discovered world, none of the other forces had sent anyone from their generation; they were all busy with invasion plans. Now, even the protection escort had shrunk by at least half.

The group ascended the array platform. Since they were all insiders, Emperor Qin didn't say many formalities, only giving a few words of instruction before ordering the array to be activated. Zhou Ying extended a hand and pointed, and silver symbols darted out from his fingers, encircling Zhou Tian and forming a magic shield to protect him. This kind of ultra-long-distance teleportation array came with immense tearing force during transmission. Although weakened by the array, it was still more than Zhou Tian could withstand, so Zhou Ying thoughtfully cast a protective shield on him.

"Thank you, Second Brother!" Zhou Tian wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry, but since Zhou Ying's intention was to protect him, he wisely offered his thanks.

"Hum!" The entire teleportation array lit up with golden light. All the array patterns floated up, like 3D projections, and countless complex runes intertwined within the grand array.

"Boom!" The domain gate opened, and the group, enveloped by runes, vanished from their original spot.
