# Chapter 112: Departure, New World!

The spirit stone vein appeared in Hushan Prefecture, precisely at the Immortal Mist Mountain where the Immortal Mist Sect once resided. The Immortal Mist Sect was the sect Chang Wanli originated from, and the second beast hide Zhou Qing obtained was Chang Wanli's token of gratitude after seeking medical treatment.

Mao Ri accompanied Zhou Qing to the spirit stone vein at the Immortal Mist Sect. The creature had a knack for treasure hunting, and since the spirit stone vein might be related to ancient Qi cultivators, there was a chance of discovering valuable artifacts.

The mine shaft was deep, and after descending about a kilometer, terrifying sounds could be heard. As a result, the miners dared not venture further and only managed to retrieve three spirit stones after an extensive search.

The spiritual energy in the entire vein was dense but unsuitable for cultivation. Zhou Qing could sense that the vein's energy was chaotic, filled with impurities that made it unfit for absorption—like unrefined salt, bitter and toxic.

This place was far from welcoming to cultivators.

Zhou Qing made his judgment as he ventured deeper into the spiritual cave. Strange, eerie sounds assaulted his mind, yet he remained calm and composed, merely curious about their origin.

Still, he kept his divine sense extended.

The cave walls resisted his divine sense, allowing him to penetrate only about three meters. The path grew narrower as he advanced.

"Is this the end?" Zhou Qing wondered, but then he heard the sound of flowing water.

Where was it coming from?

He expanded his divine sense fully but found no trace. At that moment, Mao Ri let out a sharp cry and spat flames at a section of the wall. Zhou Qing looked over and saw faintly glowing formation patterns emerge on the stone.

"So there's a concealment formation here. No wonder I missed it," Zhou Qing mused.

He summoned the Green Wood Sword and executed the "Splitting the Sun" technique, shattering the concealed wall with a single strike.

Boom!

The wall crumbled, revealing a hidden cavern within. Zhou Qing stepped inside, finding no stale or musty air. Like the Jingyang Cave, the cavern illuminated itself without any visible light source. A small stone bridge arched over a babbling stream.

As he entered, a watery curtain formed over the entrance, sealing it shut.

Zhou Qing's attention was immediately drawn to a corpse in the cave—its entire body jade-green, emitting an eerie glow.

"Xuan Qingzi perished here, severed from spiritual energy."

Beside the corpse, Zhou Qing found a piece of jade containing the details of a divine ability.

"**Eyes of Truth**: As long as the target's divine sense cultivation isn't superior to yours or they lack special artifacts to conceal their aura, you can easily discern their cultivation level. With sufficient experience, you may even see through their practiced techniques, divine abilities, and spells at a glance."

---

Zhou Qing was slightly pleased upon obtaining the Eyes of Truth technique. The ability to see through cultivation levels alone would prove invaluable as he explored unknown regions of the cultivation world.

At higher levels, the Eyes of Truth could even perceive the energy flow of formations, making it highly effective for breaking them. However, the jade only contained the first three layers of the technique, with the remaining two layers missing.

"This much is enough."

Zhou Qing swept the cave once more but found nothing else. Mao Ri, however, dug out a small pouch from somewhere—a tiny storage bag containing spirit herb seeds Zhou Qing didn't recognize. The creature's treasure-hunting talent was something even Zhou Qing had to admire.

The pouch had a concealment effect, making it easy to overlook even with divine sense. Zhou Qing had Mao Ri search again while he meticulously combed through the cave, but there were no further discoveries. It seemed the cave had already been looted long ago.

With a sigh, Zhou Qing fashioned a stone coffin for Xuan Qingzi, burying him properly and erecting a small memorial stele in the cave.

"Perishing from severed spiritual energy is the cruelest fate for a Qi cultivator—akin to a mortal starving to death."

In the Great Zhou's Wude Division, starvation was once considered one of the harshest punishments. Among the six paths of hell, one was specifically designated for hungry ghosts.

After laying Xuan Qingzi to rest, Zhou Qing returned in low spirits.

However, the spirit stone vein required a strong guardian. After discussions, it was decided that innate masters would take turns guarding it, with the mined spirit stones distributed proportionally.

Current output was minimal, but as spiritual energy continued to recover, the situation would likely improve over the next few decades. Other veins might also be discovered in the coming years, though for now, this was the only one.

With his affairs in order, Zhou Qing began constructing a teleportation array in the herb garden. He had laid the foundation for the Dao Court, and its future development would be left to Lin Wan'er and the others.

For this expedition into the unknown, Zhou Qing planned to scout alone. Zhang Jingxiu would remain behind—this mortal realm still faced threats from demons and monsters, requiring a powerful figure to oversee it. With Zhang's Crucible Realm cultivation, he was more than capable.

However, Zhang had mentioned that if Zhou Qing didn't return within ten years and the spiritual energy remained insufficient for his cultivation, he too would venture out once others reached the Crucible Realm.

Zhou Qing also set up a spirit-gathering formation for Zhang using the demon ape's inner core, which provided some benefit. Combined with Fu Shan's alchemy and Zhou Qing's stockpiled pills, ten years would pass without issue.

Yet, a cultivator's thirst for advancement was insatiable by nature. Zhou Qing understood Zhang's perspective—staying in this mortal realm would make him akin to a deity, but that wasn't his aspiration. Progress here would be painfully slow, with noticeable improvements requiring decades or even centuries. Zhou Qing had no patience for that.

Assembling the teleportation array was complex and tedious, taking Zhou Qing half a month to complete.

"Master, it's done!" Yuan Mingyue exclaimed excitedly as she gazed at the finished array.

Zhou Qing shook his head. "We still need to confirm whether the corresponding array on the other side is intact."

He installed ten low-grade spirit stones into the array's nodes. As soon as they were in place, the array activated, generating intense spiritual energy fluctuations. A tearing sensation gripped Zhou Qing—Mao Ri had unexpectedly followed him in.

Zhou Qing emerged in another teleportation array, this one located in an underwater cave. He appeared in an inner chamber but didn't rush to explore. First, he tested the array—without the Teleportation Token, it wouldn't activate. Satisfied, he used the token to return briefly, reassuring Yuan Mingyue, who had been worried he might not come back.

After a few words with his disciple, Zhou Qing departed again. Only Yuan Mingyue knew of his plans—she was responsible for maintaining the array. If the one in Jiangzhou's herb garden failed, Zhou Qing would be stranded.

Yuan Mingyue, now an innate master herself and protected by the garden's formations, was the ideal guardian for both the garden and the array.

Assured of his ability to return, Zhou Qing began exploring the underwater cave. The cave spanned about a kilometer but was largely empty. However, the spiritual energy here was exceptionally rich, invigorating Zhou Qing.

"This cave itself is a treasure."

Further investigation revealed that the cave had a defensive formation projecting an invisible barrier that kept the water out.

"Is this a lake or the sea?" Zhou Qing wondered.

Activating his Eyes of Truth, he observed the fish outside and concluded it was likely a lake—a sea would require a far more robust formation.

Testing the formation's defenses, he found them mediocre at best. To truly claim the cave, he needed to refine its core.

Soon, Zhou Qing located the cave's core in the main hall and began refining it. Midway through, a thunderous impact shook the cave.

"Someone's attacking?" Zhou Qing concealed his aura and altered his appearance.

Outside, three cultivators, using water-repelling spells, were hammering at the cave's defenses with heavy mallets and spikes.

Through his Eyes of Truth, Zhou Qing assessed their cultivation—Qi Refining stage? The technique was undetectable, especially through the formation.

With a thought, Zhou Qing opened a gap in the formation where they were attacking.

The three cultivators were both shocked and delighted.

"So the cave's defenses aren't as strong as we thought! Who knows what treasures lie inside?"

They communicated via divine sense, their initial excitement tinged with disappointment. As they landed at the cave's entrance, the gap closed behind them—they assumed it was the formation's natural behavior.

When they pushed open the door, they froze.

A young man stood before them.

Without hesitation, they unleashed their artifacts—a spike, a hammer, and a flying dagger—all aimed at Zhou Qing.

But an overwhelming pressure erupted from Zhou Qing, turning their faces ashen.

"Not good—a Foundation Establishment senior!" one old man cried out.

"Spare us, Senior!"

The three artifacts fell into Zhou Qing's grasp as effortlessly as an eagle snatching chicks.

"Such hostility? No words, just attacks?" Zhou Qing smirked at the kneeling cultivators.

"Senior, as a Foundation Establishment expert, surely you've slain countless cultivators yourself. We're just rogue cultivators, lacking the fortune to obtain a Fate Demon. Otherwise, we too might have reached Foundation Establishment, claimed a mountain in the Southern Barrens, and ruled as we pleased."

"Brother Fang, why bother? A young-looking senior like him must be a true disciple of some major sect, blessed with a Fate Demon since childhood. How could he understand the struggles of rogue cultivators like us?"

Zhou Qing frowned. His current strength was the result of his own efforts—what Fate Demon?

It seemed the so-called "Fate Demon" referred to fused demonic entities. But why the term "Fate"?

Human sorrows were not shared. Zhou Qing felt no sympathy for them. "Is survival so difficult for rogue cultivators?" he asked coolly.

In a way, he was a rogue cultivator here too.

"You elite disciples wouldn't understand our despair. In the wild, we're nothing but prey for you and those demonic beasts," one cultivator spat, then paused. "Wait... why don't you know this?"

"I don't hunt cultivators," Zhou Qing replied evenly.

"Are you... a cultivator who follows the Jingyang Dao Code? Abstaining from hunting fellow cultivators?" The old man was stunned. "Impossible. Twenty years ago, the last sect upholding the Jingyang Dao Code—the Everlasting Life Temple—was eradicated."

The other two cultivators exchanged bewildered glances. Could there still be demonic cultivators who adhered to the Jingyang Dao Code?

To them, a youthful Foundation Establishment expert like Zhou Qing had to be a demonic cultivator with a Fate Demon. Such cultivators were inevitably corrupted by bloodlust, becoming cruel and violent. Even those who followed the Jingyang Dao Code had broken its tenets before.
