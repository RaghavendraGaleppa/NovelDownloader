# Chapter 69: The Divine Firmament Palace Gathers All Talents  

With Wang Mumu's disturbance gone, the assessment continued.  

The next part would delve into the crucial aspects of Han Yue's cultivation. [Chuanzong] also knew that his next words concerned the disciple's path to immortality, so he became much more cautious.  

"Innate Divine Abilities: Four!"  

"That's truly an impressive number!"  

Han Yue could feel the fluctuations of [Chuanzong]'s mana growing more intense. Though it still didn't directly invade his body for a forceful scan, the ripples of mana agitated Han Yue's own energy flow, extracting more information from his reactions.  

For a Longevity Realm cultivator, the fluctuations of Han Yue's mana could reveal many hidden secrets.  

"All four divine abilities have already condensed into divine runes—truly rare!"  

"To possess four supreme divine abilities at the Body Entry Realm—this talent is second to none!"  

"One movement technique, one killing technique, and two refining techniques."  

"Your divine ability system is preliminarily complete, mutually reinforcing, and with two refining techniques, your cultivation progress will be greatly accelerated. Excellent!"  

[Chuanzong] praised Han Yue's talent lavishly.  

Then, he spoke to Han Yue with great solemnity:  

"Yuanchu, with four supreme divine abilities, you are unmatched among Body Entry Realm cultivators! Coming from Guizhou, a land plagued by demonic calamities, you must have slaughtered many second or even third-order demons."  

"Cultivators from Guizhou tend to have strong killing and greedy desires."  

"But for us cultivators pursuing immortality, the Great Dao must remain our priority. Do not lose sight of the essence by obsessing over divine abilities while neglecting your cultivation!"  

Han Yue was already aware of this and often reminded himself during daily practice. Still, he took the Longevity Realm elder's advice to heart and assured [Chuanzong] that he would never neglect his cultivation.  

[Chuanzong] continued:  

"In truth, for us cultivators, divine abilities and cultivation are closely intertwined—both require diligent effort."  

"Your four supreme innate divine abilities rank within the top hundred among the Divine Firmament Palace's Body Entry Realm disciples over tens of thousands of years!"  

"Among our sect's current disciples below the Longevity Realm, none surpassed you in divine abilities at the Body Entry Realm!"  

"However, starting from the Body Entry Realm, each breakthrough grants access to our sect's supreme techniques, allowing cultivators to comprehend new supreme divine abilities."  

"If your cultivation lags, you may very well be surpassed by those who come after you!"  

"The Divine Firmament Palace once had a Longevity Realm elder who possessed no divine abilities at the Body Entry Realm."  

"Yet through years of arduous cultivation, he eventually formed a first-grade Golden Core. Accumulating strength over time, he instantly comprehended five supreme sword-path divine abilities, greatly enhancing his power. He dominated his generation, advancing all the way to the Longevity Realm."  

"After another ten thousand years of cultivation, he refined five fourth-order flying sword treasures, forming a Five Elements Sword Formation. Its might rivaled top-tier supreme divine abilities, making him unmatched in combat among his peers. He slew countless Longevity Realm demons beyond the heavens!"  

"Our sect also had a Longevity Realm elder with mediocre talent. At the second rank, he formed only a fourth-grade Golden Core and possessed a single Mystic Light divine ability."  

"Yet after a century of rigorous cultivation, not only did his cultivation deepen, but he also refined that single divine ability to perfection, elevating it to the supreme rank!"  

"Upon advancing to the third rank, this elder comprehended four additional Mystic Light divine abilities."  

"With five Mystic Light divine abilities in total, encompassing all five elements, he fused them into a supreme Five-Colored Divine Light ability."  

"Even after reaching the fifth-rank Heavenly Human Realm, his divine light remained invincible, capable of sweeping away all things in existence!"  

"Among the top three most talented Body Entry Realm disciples in our sect's history, there was one who was the descendant of a fifth-rank Heavenly Human, inheriting pure lineage blood."  

"From childhood, he awakened five supreme Five Elements Thunder divine abilities. By age twelve, he had already advanced to the second rank, forming a third-grade Golden Core. His divine abilities merged into a supreme Primordial Five Elements True Thunder technique."  

"At the second rank, slaying third-rank demon saint descendants was as easy as eating or drinking for him. His cultivation path was unstoppable, advancing unimpeded."  

"Yet because his path was too smooth and his slaughter too excessive, burdened by karma, he ultimately failed to break through the Longevity Realm's heavenly gate. He perished and reincarnated at just over seven hundred years old."  

To caution Han Yue, [Chuanzong] cited three highly representative historical figures from the Divine Firmament Palace.  

Comparing these three was undoubtedly meant to convey a lesson:  

Regardless of whether one's talent or divine abilities were high or low, only diligent cultivation formed the true foundation.  

Even with mediocre talent, relentless cultivation would be rewarded by the sect's supreme techniques, smoothing the path to immortality.  

Conversely, even with extraordinary talent, if one indulged in conflict without tempering their achievements, not even an ancestor in the Heavenly Human Realm could prevent reincarnation!  

[Chuanzong] had gone to great lengths to dispel Han Yue's complacency and reduce his reliance on innate divine abilities.  

Once again, the advantages of a top-tier sect were on full display. Its long history and the cultivation paths of countless predecessors served as both examples and warnings for later disciples—this was the true heritage of the sect.  

Seeing that Han Yue had grasped his meaning, [Chuanzong] continued the assessment.  

"Cultivation Technique: *Nourishing Body Thunder*!"  

"Cultivation Progress: Second Major Perfection!"  

"Yuanchu, you’re quite fortunate to have obtained the *Nourishing Body Thunder* technique before joining the sect. At least you didn’t waste resources on some inferior method, only to have to discard it and start over after entering."  

"You’ve cultivated it well—your primal qi and mana are pure, with no issues in your practice."  

"Our sect has five foundational techniques for the Body Entry Realm. Among them, the *Nourishing Body Thunder* and *Thunder Nourishes Spirit* set is most suitable for thunder-path cultivators, aligning with your primal qi and divine abilities."  

"Your choice of technique is correct. Continue cultivating it until you accumulate enough foundation, then directly use the Longevity inheritance technique to form your Golden Core and advance."  

"Since you’ve already achieved the Second Major Perfection, you only need to catch up with *Thunder Nourishes Spirit* now."  

"These two techniques complement each other. With *Nourishing Body Thunder* as your foundation, *Thunder Nourishes Spirit* will progress quickly."  

"For the *Nourishing Body Thunder* technique, achieving the Fifth Major Perfection is sufficient to form a first-grade Golden Core."  

"If you reach the Fifth Major Perfection but still fail to form a first-grade Golden Core, it means your accumulation in other areas is lacking—it’s no longer about your cultivation. I’ve seen disciples achieve the Tenth Major Perfection yet only form a third-grade Golden Core."  

"Beyond the Fifth Major Perfection, further cultivation is still beneficial—it increases your mana and enhances accumulation."  

"It also improves your chances of comprehending innate divine abilities upon advancing to the second rank."  

"Based on my records, those who achieve the Seventh Major Perfection or higher and form a first-grade Golden Core will comprehend at least two supreme divine abilities."  

"Those who achieve the Tenth Major Perfection and form a first-grade Golden Core will comprehend at least three supreme divine abilities!"  

"There are rare cases of cultivators surpassing the Tenth Major Perfection, but they’re too few and often involve confounding factors, so I won’t mention them."  

Hearing this, Han Yue couldn’t help but ask:  

"[Chuanzong] Ancestor, may I ask what the highest recorded Major Perfection of *Nourishing Body Thunder* in the Divine Firmament Palace is?"  

[Chuanzong] always answered disciples' questions:  

"You’re asking about the highest? That would be the Five Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy-Sixth Major Perfection, achieved by a past sect master seventeen thousand years ago during his Body Entry Realm cultivation!"  

"Wait—how many did you say?"
