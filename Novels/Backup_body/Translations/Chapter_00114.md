# Chapter 114: The Fall of Celestial Stars and the Destruction of the Immortal Isle  

The celestial stars descended, illuminating the heavens.  

In an instant, the star split into ten, scattering across the world.  

The Great Zhou Dynasty was thrown into turmoil.  

The old emperor had fallen, a new emperor ascended the throne, and rumors spread of the imperial jade seal shattering. Now, with the descent of the ten celestial stars, it was heralded as the beginning of calamity.  

The capital was plunged into even greater chaos—collapsing caverns, quaking earth, countless lives lost—further cementing the belief that the celestial stars brought disaster.  

Powerful figures across the land grew restless.  

A new belief began to spread:  

*The Great Zhou Dynasty’s fate was sealed.*  

"The descent of the celestial stars may not necessarily shake the nation’s destiny," the Grand Preceptor sighed. "But the fear they instill in the people will inevitably weaken the dynasty’s fortune. The remnants of the Great Xuan Dynasty are already fanning the flames. It begins now."  

He looked up at the sky and murmured, "This celestial descent has never been recorded in history. What does it signify?"  

Then he lowered his gaze to the earth and sighed again. "Why has the descent of the celestial stars stirred such unrest in *Him*?"  

---  

The Luofu Immortal Sect, already devastated by the "Creditor," was now teetering on the brink.  

To survive, the sect had ceded territories and authority, surrendering countless benefits—yet the greed of other factions remained insatiable.  

"The Profound Sword Sect and the Violet Mist Dao Sect—these top-tier factions all seek to replace Luofu."  

"If not for the upheaval in the capital, which weakened the Great Zhou Dynasty, their armies—led by Human Immortals—would have seized our sect!"  

"The world is filled with insatiable greed. None understand that our sect suffered this devastation for the sake of preserving a sliver of hope for all!"  

The elders of Luofu were furious.  

The descent of the celestial stars had stirred a faint reaction from their shattered ancestral treasure.  

Now, they finally understood why their sect leader had been so easily harvested by the Creditor—because he had willingly destroyed the sect’s sacred treasure to glimpse the heavens’ will!  

"Luofu foresaw the coming calamity, yet we were harvested by the Creditor…"  

A suffocating gloom hung over the sect.

### Kunlun Immortal Sect  

The young sect master, who had been pursuing the Fifth Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation, witnessed the descent of the ten celestial stars. Shaken, he returned to the sect.  

As he hurried back, he saw the current Kunlun Sect Leader standing atop the main peak, gazing at the sky.  

The Kunlun Sect Leader, an ethereal and profound figure, exuded an unfathomable aura of power.  

Within him lay the Kunlun Sect’s ancestral treasure—the *Nine Tribulations Heavenly Thunderflame*!  

"The heavens are changing," the Kunlun Sect Leader said gravely. "Something foreign to this world has arrived, bringing chaos. The final message from the Luofu Sect Leader has come true."  

He turned and continued, "The Luofu Sect Leader spoke of a nascent divine race awakening in the depths of the Southern Wasteland—one that may hold the key to averting the Tenfold Annihilation."  

With that, he strode toward the main hall.  

The young sect master followed, his expression complex.  

"I entrust the *Nine Tribulations Heavenly Thunderflame* to you," the Kunlun Sect Leader said. "If I do not return in ten years—whether my life flame is extinguished or not—assume I have perished, and you shall succeed me as Kunlun’s leader."  

His aged face bore deep concern as he added, "Be ever vigilant against the former Human Dao Ancestor, the Underworld’s Prefect, and the so-called ‘opportunities’ descending from the heavens."

### Feather Transformation Immortal Sect  

Within the sect, Chen Zhu, the newly appointed Ancient Moon Peak Master, bowed deeply.  

Before him stood the current Feather Transformation Sect Leader, flanked by a dozen elders.  

All gazed at the sky with unease.  

"The ten celestial stars—the disaster is worse than we feared."  

"Yet in this dire situation, someone will help us turn the tide."  

"What do you mean, Sect Leader?" an elder asked in surprise.  

"I sense foreign auras beyond this realm," the sect leader said, hands clasped behind his back. "They come from outside, yet they are bound to this world—just like us, they seek to preserve it."

### Vajra Temple  

The abbot sat in meditation, bathed in golden light.  

Before him stood a one-armed man, his expression calm.  

Had Li Zhengjing been present, he would have recognized him—the former Ancient Moon Peak Master.  

"I cannot extend your lifespan," the abbot said.  

"I did not come for longevity," the one-armed man replied.  

"Then you are here because of the celestial stars?"  

"My time is nearly spent. I can no longer seek the truth of the stars. I only wish, before death, to test the Creditor’s strength."  

The former peak master’s face was pale, his skin withered, devoid of his former immortal grace. His weary eyes carried exhaustion.  

His voice was heavy with bitterness.  

"Old monk, among all the Human Immortals of this world, you are the only one I trust."  

"Yet rumors say *you* are the Creditor," the abbot said. "You claimed to have slain the previous Creditor and taken his token, only to realize you were but a pawn—another victim awaiting harvest."  

"True," the former peak master sighed. "I had hoped to enlist your aid in slaying the Creditor. But greed clouded my judgment. I believed mastering the *Dragon-Tiger Supreme Fusion Art*—reaching the level of a sect leader—would allow me to overthrow the Creditor. I feared you might covet the Creditor’s token, so I did not ask for your help. Now I see I was merely a pawn—a discarded one at that."  

"Now you feign death, shifting the Creditor’s identity to the Golden Ship’s master, hiding in the shadows to lure out the true Creditor?" The abbot mused. "You considered asking me for help but never the Feather Transformation Sect’s leaders. Do you believe the true Creditor is among them?"  

"Yes."  

The former peak master raised his head. "The ten celestial stars herald an apocalypse. The Creditor, no matter how powerful, is bound to this world. He will not stand idle as it faces annihilation. This is our chance to force him into the open. I need your help."

Li Zhengjing knew nothing of the upheaval caused by the celestial stars—his sources were limited.  

When the stars descended, the little dragon girl trembled in fear.  

But the next day, a paper crane arrived, bearing news of the celestial descent and a piece of Heavenly Profound White Gold.  

"The ten celestial stars represent the Tenfold Annihilation, capable of erasing an entire world."  

"Yet one among them is untainted by destruction—imbued instead with celestial power. Thus, there remains a sliver of hope."  

"The heavens above hold true immortals, who have altered a hopeless fate, granting this world a chance."  

"To avert annihilation, we must find the one untainted star and use its celestial power to resist the destruction of the other nine."  

The counterfeit elixir peddler spoke gravely. "Each star has formed its own realm—a celestial grotto. Only by entering can we find the star’s true form."  

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official frowned. "And if we enter one of the nine destructive grottos?"  

"The consequences would be dire. But this is our only path."  

The ten stars had fallen—three in the Eastern Sea, two in the Western Regions, one in the Northern Wastes, and four in the Southern Wasteland. Yet none had landed in the Central Plains.  

According to the peddler, the Kunlun Sect Leader would personally venture into the Southern Wasteland.  

The peddler himself would head north, beyond Fengdu Mountain, into the frozen lands.  

The Western Regions, home to Buddhist roots, had already been alerted by the Vajra and Cloud-Sky Temples.  

As for the Eastern Sea, three stars had fallen.  

"I wish to investigate," the Ghost Valley Spirit Official said.  

"These celestial grottos—imbued with ‘annihilation’ and ‘celestial’ energies—what are they? How do they differ from our own power?"  

He looked at Li Zhengjing. "For years, I served on the Golden Ship, convinced that no true immortals existed beyond the heavens."  

"But the Underworld’s deities shook my beliefs."  

"Perhaps they endure through divine jade, superior to even the Heavenly Domain’s sacred stones. But if the celestial stars bear heavenly power, then the Golden Ship’s creed was wrong from the start."  

"If celestial beings exist, it overturns everything we know."  

Gazing at the churning waves, he mused, "If the heavenly court is real, why was the Celestial Azure Dao Lord—who ascended—buried in the dust?"  

"And why, in ancient times, could sages ascend, while in recent millennia, none have reached true immortality? Even the Human Dao Ancestor lingers in this world, clinging to life."  

With these thoughts, the Ghost Valley Spirit Official prepared for his journey.  

But he knew little of the Eastern Sea’s depths—he did not even know his destination.  

Li Zhengjing, however, had a solution.  

"Master, we’ve found him—that youth named Shi Yuan."  

"Good."  

Li Zhengjing remembered the young man at the peak of the Inner Qi realm.  

Shi Yuan, seventeen, hailed from Hongshan Town in the southeast. As a child, he had fallen into the sea and washed ashore on an island, where he inherited the legacy of a Human Immortal—a complete inheritance, enough to found a sect.  

Returning to the mainland, Shi Yuan quickly rose to prominence, commanding respect even from local officials.  

Proud and ambitious, he had planned to serve the imperial court after breaking through to the True Qi realm, securing spirit stones for his cultivation.  

But his trip to the capital nearly cost him his life—until he met Li Zhengjing.  

The seventeen-year-old "Righteous Scenery Immortal Venerable" had saved him, displaying Human Immortal-level strength, facing divine beings and mighty powers without fear.  

That journey shattered Shi Yuan’s arrogance.  

Though humbled, he retained his pride. Unwilling to serve the Great Zhou after his brush with death, he returned to Hongshan Town.  

The moment he arrived home, guests flocked to his door—even the local magistrate came to pay respects.  

Then he heard that the Righteous Scenery Immortal Venerable had come to visit.  

Startled, he dismissed his guests and rushed out.  

The onlookers watched in disbelief as the young but formidable Shi Yuan bowed deeply to an even younger man.  

Li Zhengjing helped him up.  

"I’ve come with a request."  

"You saved my life in the capital. Whatever you need, I will do my best," Shi Yuan said solemnly. "But my cultivation is shallow—how can I assist you?"  

"I know you inherited a Human Immortal’s legacy," Li Zhengjing said bluntly.  

Shi Yuan stiffened, alarmed. His inheritance was a treasure many would kill for—he had claimed only to have studied under an immortal to avoid trouble.  

"I only need your sea chart."  

Relieved, Shi Yuan handed it over.  

Li Zhengjing pointed. "This is our current location?"  

"Yes."  

"And where is the Nine Spirits Immortal Isle?"  

Shi Yuan indicated the chart’s upper left. "Here."  

Hesitating, he added, "You seek the Nine Spirits Immortal Isle?"  

Li Zhengjing noticed his unease. "Is there a problem?"  

Shi Yuan produced another item—a token. "My late master served as a guest elder of Penglai Immortal Isle. This token allows communication."  

He lowered his voice. "Three hours ago, Penglai sent word—three celestial stars fell over the sea. One struck the Nine Spirits Immortal Isle, forming a vast grotto."  

"Explorers who entered—even Human Immortals—never returned. The isle is now forbidden. The sect… is no more."
