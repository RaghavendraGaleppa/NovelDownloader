# Chapter 53: Luring the Tiger Away from the Mountain

Zhang Yunyi brought twelve guards with him to Phoenix Mountain Manor.

He had also prepared some accounting documents with great fanfare and brought along a "Yang Can Plow." It seemed he was going to praise Yang Can to the heavens. But what if he were to tell the Clan Master that this plow should actually be called the "Yu Family Plow"? Whether something is a merit or a fault sometimes depends entirely on the speaker's words.

From Feng'an Manor to Phoenix Mountain Manor wasn't too far; one could set out in the morning and arrive by evening. Near noon, Zhang Yunyi's group reached a river valley. The spring river wasn't swift or deep, but the water was quite cold. Zhang Yunyi poked his head out of the carriage to look around and ordered, "Let's rest by the river for a while."

The team stopped. A stone's throw away was a forest, but it wasn't the scorching summer yet, so there was no need to take shelter in the shade. Since it was just a brief rest, they didn't even remove the saddles. The guards dismounted and went to the river to fetch water and water their horses.

Just then, a sudden, rapid sound of hoofbeats rang out. The Longmen sects were independent and had no state, so naturally, they had no army. But in a place like this, even ordinary commoners knew a thing or two about martial arts, let alone the private soldiers of the sects. Zhang Yunyi's guards were far more disciplined than the common soldiers at the manor. Hearing the swift hoofbeats, which came from more than one horse, they immediately rushed from the river back to their warhorses.

They weren't certain the newcomers meant them harm, and the area around Phoenix Mountain Manor was relatively peaceful. After all, causing trouble here would be like plucking the whiskers of the tiger, Yu Xinglong. But no one would stake their life on an assumption.

*Swish, swish, swish...*

A volley of arrows rained down like a storm. Li Dache had just grabbed his saddle when a wolf-tooth arrow shot forth, pinning his hand to the saddle. The warhorse whinnied in pain and instinctively bolted forward, dragging Li Dache, who screamed in agony, alongside it.

A shower of arrows sent Zhang Yunyi's guards tumbling, with three or four falling instantly. The others were basically all delayed from mounting their horses. At that moment, the riders appeared. There were over twenty of them, all in riding clothes, their faces covered with linen cloths to shield against dust. They rode and shot from horseback, but they only loosed one round of arrows before closing in. They slung their bows and drew their sabers.

On Zhang Yunyi's side, the guards who had managed to mount raised their sabers and charged forward with wild roars. They had to buy time for their comrades to get on their horses. *Clang, clang, clang...* Steel sabers collided, creating a series of grating sounds. The horses of both sides crossed. The ambushing cavalry had the advantage of speed, which was precisely the condition under which cavalry could exert their greatest power. The masked riders swept past, and the guards on Zhang Yunyi's side, both mounted and those来不及 to mount, were cut down one by one.

By the time the twenty-plus riders wheeled their horses around and charged again, only four of Zhang Yunyi's twelve guards remained. In fact, the martial skill of these guards was not inferior to that of the masked riders. It was a pity that they had lost the initiative from the start, and could only be slaughtered. The remaining four guards gave up on the idea of mounting. They quickly moved to the side of Zhang Yunyi's carriage, their backs against it, holding steel sabers and standing guard warily.

"Who is it that has Zhang in their sights?" Zhang Yunyi's courage was quite remarkable; in such a situation, he remained surprisingly calm. He slowly stepped down from the carriage, a "Su Tie Saber" held loosely at his side. This type of saber, produced at the Qiankou Foundry in Xiangzhou, was exceptionally sharp, with a hard edge and an excellent韧性 to the blade. Lord Zhang had been highly valued by the Yu family at a young age and eventually became the lord of a manor; he had weathered great storms in his past.

However, he was no longer that peerlessly fierce young swordsman of the past. The saber in his hand was no longer that notched pig-iron blade. He hadn't crossed hands with anyone in nearly twenty years. Perhaps the only thing he hadn't put down was his courage. He stared at a rider on a horse. Compared to the other burly riders, this one's figure was much smaller. And he was the only one without a saber. Although this rider's head was covered with a linen cloth, the pair of eyes visible through the uneven eyeholes gave Zhang Yunyi an inexplicable sense of familiarity.

"Who are you, sir? Do you have a grudge against Zhang?" The petite rider on the horse didn't reply, just calmly raised a hand. Zhang Yunyi's gaze fell on that hand. The hand was petite, as white and smooth as jade, glowing with a soft, warm luster in the sun. It was slender and well-proportioned, with the特有的 plump弧度 of a young woman's hand. Zhang Yunyi's pupils constricted. This person was indeed a woman. A woman who could mobilize so many people and hold a grudge against him—who was she?

Before Zhang Yunyi could figure it out, that beautiful hand, which seemed suited only for playing the zither or holding flowers, sliced down with elegance. The twenty-some riders on horseback, in perfect unison, returned their sabers to their sheaths, unslung their bows, and nocked arrows, aiming at them. Zhang Yunyi's expression changed drastically. But before he could cry out in shock and anger, they had already acted without hesitation.

*Swish, swish, swish...* Because they were so close, Zhang Yunyi could even hear the twang of the bows. His four guards were targeted by at least five bows each. In an instant, they were like banana leaves battered by hail, riddled with holes. But Zhang Yunyi, standing in their midst, was completely unharmed.

At this time, the petite rider raised her hand again. Her slender fingers grabbed the face covering and ripped it off, revealing a face that was charming whether angry or happy. Zhang Yunyi trembled all over and cried out in shock, "Miss Qingmei?"

Qingmei leaped from her horse, her toes touching the ground as lightly as a civet cat. Her movements were far superior to the dismounting technique Yang Can had shown off earlier. "Miss Qingmei, what is the meaning of this?" Zhang Yunyi was shaking all over. He had thought of many women, but never Qingmei. Since Qingmei had shown her true face to him, did that mean he had no way out?

"I heard the Manor Lord was a very formidable swordsman back in the day. Shall we exchange a few moves?" Qingmei raised her sword and said cheerfully. She was wearing a man's riding outfit, which completely hid her delicate and charming figure. But just by raising her sword like that, she gave off a feeling of lightness and agility, like a butterfly. Before Zhang Yunyi could speak, she drifted over like a faint, almost imperceptible wisp of smoke. The sword in Qingmei's hand transformed into a snowflake in a cold night, aiming straight for Zhang Yunyi's brow.

In the study, Yang Can was looking at the list Li Damu had organized according to his requirements. Just then, the door opened, and Little Qingmei swept in, enveloped in a wave of fragrance. She stood before Yang Can with a smile. Yang Can looked up. "It's done?" "Done!" Qingmei replied, beaming. "Were there any deaths or injuries?" "Three were injured, only one seriously. I've made proper arrangements for them," Qingmei said, still smiling. "Did you capture Zhang Yunyi?" "Captured. I did it myself. I subdued him in just over twenty moves," Qingmei continued, beaming. "Where did you put him?" "Second Brother Cheng found a place, about ten miles from Feng'an Manor," Qingmei's smile faded. "Good. Now, the 'sky' over Feng'an Manor has been covered by us. Next, we can proceed with the plan to defeat them one by one!" Yang Can mused as he picked up the list Li Damu had drafted. "Let's start with the small fry... him, Feng'an Manor's household head, Shi Jiuyue."

Qingmei pouted. "If you don't have anything else for me, I'll go out now?" "Hmm!" Yang Can casually agreed, drawing a circle around Shi Jiuyue's name. Qingmei's little face fell, and she turned to leave. Just as she was about to reach the door, Yang Can's voice came from behind. "Zhang Yunyi was a famous swordsman in the Helan area in his youth, his martial arts were相当 formidable. You actually captured him alive in just over twenty moves?"

Qingmei didn't turn back, but the corners of her mouth were already raised so high they were hard to suppress. She slowly turned around, her face a picture of calm indifference. "Well, it was nothing. If I hadn't needed to take him alive, he wouldn't have lasted ten moves against me." Of course, Qingmei's words contained a bit of boasting. There were over twenty big men with bows and arrows watching like tigers! Where was the fight left in Zhang Yunyi? However, Qingmei's martial skill was exceptionally high, that was without a doubt. In fact, her swordsmanship was even sharper than Suo Chanzhi's. Because although the two of them were taught by the same master, practicing martial arts is a very辛苦 affair. Qingmei had a strong motivation to practice, while Suo Chanzhi did not.

Yang Can slapped his forehead, as if he had just realized something, and praised her with delight: "I truly didn't expect that a delicate little girl like you could be so formidable in martial arts." Qingmei was overjoyed. "Not entirely. Zhang Yunyi has lived a life of luxury for over twenty years; his martial skills have long been put aside. Hee hee, I won't keep you then. You're busy, I'm going out." Little Qingmei left the room happily, and Yang Can couldn't help but laugh. In fact, the moment Little Qingmei came in, he could see the little丫头's face was begging for praise. She really was a girl who couldn't hide her feelings. Yang Can shook his head and smiled, turning his attention back to the list in his hand.

His plan for Zhang Yunyi was a classic power replacement strategy. It was a game of wits combining psychological warfare, organizational control, and information management. Not long after arriving at Feng'an Manor, Yang Can saw the powerful control Zhang Yunyi had over it. Even in Yang Can's era, the control a village chief had over a relatively isolated village could be astonishingly strong, let alone in this era, and with a powerful landlord like Zhang Yunyi? However, this powerful, almost pathological control had one major flaw: it was extremely dependent on a "few key nodes." If this were to be put in words that Leopard's Head could understand, it would be: it is extremely dependent on one person. In Feng'an Manor, this person was, of course, Zhang Yunyi, and Zhang Yunyi alone. As long as this key node was replaced or destroyed, this powerful system would instantly collapse.

Tamerlane's empire collapsed instantly upon his death on his eastern campaign because his system was one that relied entirely on "few key nodes." Yang Can's first step was to lure the tiger away from the mountain, then control that tiger. Now, he was about to begin executing the second step of his plan: to defeat them one by one! In this step, he would make full use of psychology to pull out, one by one, the foundation stones beneath Zhang Yunyi's throne. Then, it would no longer be able to bear the weight and would come crashing down!
