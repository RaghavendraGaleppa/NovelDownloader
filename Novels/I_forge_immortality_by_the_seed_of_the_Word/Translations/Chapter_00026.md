# Chapter 26: Rule Changes, Risk vs. Caution

"Shen Qingqing, Third Demonstration Platform."

The crowd had just recovered from the shock of Chen Xiandao's earlier display when they heard Senior Brother Liu's announcement. Immediately, they surged toward the third platform.

For them, these two top-tier prodigies were usually as elusive as dragons—seen neither head nor tail. Now that there was a chance to witness their prowess firsthand, no one wanted to miss it.

Moreover, with Chen Xiandao's dazzling performance still fresh in their minds, people were eager to see if this other prodigy, equally renowned as Chen Xiandao, could match his strength.

The result was unsurprising.

Shen Qingqing also swiftly concluded her battle.

With just a casual, unnamed spell, she sent the puppet flying off the platform, eliciting another wave of astonished gasps.

Zhang Jing also detected a faint trace of Dao Rhyme in Shen Qingqing's spell—a vision of a colossal five-winged cyan-golden phoenix, its wings stirring as if to summon storms and thunder, terrifying in its ferocity.

As he pondered this, Senior Brother Liu's booming voice suddenly rang out:

"The first round of assessment has concluded. Fifty-three have passed. The official ranking matches will begin in exactly one and a half hours. You may now return to rest."

At this, the crowd dispersed in small groups. Some wore expressions of dejection, sighing heavily, while others excitedly discussed the morning's events, debating the rankings of the second-tier geniuses and the standout performances of the few third-tier talents.

Of course, in all these discussions, the two top-tier prodigies were conspicuously excluded. Given their morning performances, comparing them to the others seemed utterly pointless.

On the way back...

"Brother Zhang, how do those two top-tier prodigies cultivate? Even their most ordinary moves or spells seem divinely empowered, overwhelmingly powerful," Ji Bochang mused, still unable to calm his excitement as he chattered beside Zhang Jing.

"Their superior cultivation methods are indeed strong, but ultimately, isn't it still just spiritual power?"

Zhang Jing glanced at him, thinking to himself: *You're not wrong—they do have divine assistance.*

Of course, another key factor was that the spells recorded in their superior cultivation methods perfectly complemented their Dao Rhyme. Moreover, if Zhang Jing's senses hadn't deceived him, both Shen Qingqing and Chen Xiandao had already broken through to the third level of Qi Refining. Their bodies, spiritual awareness, and spiritual power had undergone two transformations, combined with their Dao Rhyme, naturally making them appear leagues ahead of the rest.

However, these details—especially the existence of Dao Rhyme—were not things Zhang Jing could casually share with Ji Bochang. He could only nod along and agree:

"Brother Ji, your analysis makes sense!"

As they walked, three figures appeared ahead, one of whom waved at them. Drawing closer, Zhang Jing recognized Chu Lingyun and her two companions.

Before Zhang Jing could speak, Chu Lingyun's eyes brightened, and she said softly:

"Congratulations, Brother Ji, on passing the first round! And Brother Zhang, judging by your expression, you passed as well? Double congratulations!"

No sooner had she spoken than Wu Mingyuan, standing behind her, wore a strange expression, looking as if he wanted to say something but hesitated.

"Didn't you watch Brother Zhang's match?" Ji Bochang asked, puzzled.

"Haha, Lingyun wanted to see if she had a chance to compete for a top-ten ranking, so we were focused on observing the second-tier geniuses with recognized top-ten potential. We didn't pay much attention to Brother Zhang's match," Deng An explained with a smile.

"Thank you for your concern, Fairy Chu. I passed by sheer luck," Zhang Jing replied softly.

As soon as he spoke, he felt two pairs of surprised eyes sweep over him, though he ignored them.

*Was I wrong?* The puppet had forced him to use both of his only magical artifacts—wasn't that luck?

"Wonderful! All five of us passed the first round. That's no small feat," Chu Lingyun said with a radiant smile, clenching her fists in encouragement. "Let's all strive for good rankings this afternoon."

Meanwhile, in front of the Inheritance Pavilion, the purple-robed inner disciples hadn't left but were chatting among themselves.

"What do you all think of these two top-tier geniuses?"

"Impressive. Their spiritual power is pure and robust. To grasp even a sliver of Dao Rhyme in just a month—no wonder they received top-tier evaluations. Senior Brother Liu, their compatibility with the superior inheritances they chose must be quite high, right?" one inner disciple asked curiously.

"Both have supreme compatibility—one at three chi, the other at two chi eight," Senior Brother Liu revealed without hesitation.

"No wonder. With that, we might gain another junior brother and sister in less than five years. Once they mature, our Dragon Lake Sect might surpass the Divine Thunder and Mystic Light Sects, securing more resources."

"Let's hope so. The Southern Frontier is too barren as it is," several sighed.

At that moment, the purple-robed disciple sitting farthest out suddenly opened his eyes, as if struck by a thought, and looked directly at Senior Brother Liu:

"Senior Brother, for this afternoon's ranking matches, you're not planning to use that same old system of mutual challenges based on strength, are you?"

"Junior Brother Qiu, do you have any suggestions?" Senior Brother Liu asked curiously.

"Haha, Senior Brother flatters me. The sect's assessments have always been presided over by the Inheritance Pavilion's inner disciples. As someone from the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, I wouldn't dare to suggest anything. I merely have an immature idea I'd like to share."

"Please, enlighten us."

"Then I'll be bold..."

After a brief rest, Zhang Jing and the others returned early to the open area between the demonstration platforms. Those eliminated in the morning gathered at the periphery, casting envious and resentful glances at the fifty-three remaining participants, their eyes practically screaming, *I wish that were me!*

At that moment, Zhang Jing stood among the crowd, eyes closed in meditation.

Before long, Senior Brother Liu reappeared.

Surveying the participants who had arrived early, a look of satisfaction flashed in his eyes before it turned somewhat peculiar.

Then, he announced:

"As the saying goes, the path of immortality is vast and elusive. We cultivators must possess both the courage to advance relentlessly and the clarity to recognize our own limits."

"Junior brothers and sisters, the ranking matches now begin. The rules are as follows:"

"The ranking matches are divided into three stages, determining ranks 20–30, 10–20, and the top 10, in that order. Each participant may choose only one stage to compete in."

"Participants will select the platform corresponding to their desired rank. Defeating six consecutive challengers—or remaining unchallenged—secures the rank. Each person has three challenge opportunities, with breaks allowed between attempts. Vacant ranks will not be filled!"

"The first stage begins now. Platforms one through ten represent ranks 21–30. Those wishing to participate, step forward."

A deafening uproar erupted as soon as the rules were announced. Shocked exclamations rose and fell like waves.

Zhang Jing was also stunned.

He wasn't sure how to evaluate these rules. Clearly, misjudging one's own strength or the competition could lead to utter failure—unless one was overwhelmingly powerful.

Otherwise, the choice was simple: take a risky gamble or settle for a secure but lower rank.

Zhang Jing could already imagine the fierce battles that would soon unfold on the platforms. With no room for retreat, it would be all or nothing.

"This is terrible! If you aim for the top ten and fail, you won't even get the lowest reward," Ji Bochang muttered anxiously beside Zhang Jing, his face a picture of panic as his plans were upended by the new rules.

Zhang Jing glanced around and saw similar expressions on almost everyone's faces. Only a handful, including himself, remained unfazed.

Among these few, the two top-tier prodigies were in a league of their own. Zhang Jing's attention settled on three young men and two women nearby.

Sensing his gaze, one of them—a tall, slender young man—turned and nodded at him. Zhang Jing returned the gesture with a smile.

*So these five are my real competitors.*

With that thought, Zhang Jing closed his eyes again to meditate. The first stage had only just begun—there was still time.

Meanwhile, many second-tier geniuses hesitated, staring at the empty platforms. Stepping up now meant forfeiting any chance at the top twenty's rewards, which were significantly better. But if they waited and failed in the second stage, they'd end up with nothing.

While they deliberated, the third-tier participants who had barely passed the first round rushed onto the platforms, especially the lower-ranked ones, where the defenders changed three times in quick succession.

Eventually, reason prevailed over greed.

"Ah, what terrible luck to encounter such a monstrous batch this year," one second-tier genius sighed as he stepped onto a platform.

Five merit points were better than nothing.

Soon, the platforms buzzed with intense spell fluctuations.

"Lingyun, I think..." Deng An, standing beside Chu Lingyun, trailed off as he watched Wu Mingyuan on the platform, his eyes filled with unwillingness yet resignation.

"You're going up?"

"I don't have the confidence to win in the second stage."

"Fair enough. Blame this year's absurdly strong batch. Previous years never had so many second-tier geniuses, let alone two top-tier monsters dominating the top spots."

Chu Lingyun's earlier enthusiasm was gone. Her gaze drifted to the three men and two women meditating in the distance. Under these rules, competing for the top ten was too risky.

Time passed swiftly.

"The first stage has concluded. Congratulations to you all!" Senior Brother Liu congratulated the ten who remained on the platforms.

Ten beams of cyan light rose from his hand, flying to the platforms and transforming into smooth, crystalline jade tokens before the victors.

"These are your outer sect identity tokens. Future merit rewards will be recorded here, and the tokens also serve as decent defensive artifacts."

"Thank you, Senior Brother!" the ten exclaimed, clutching their tokens tightly.

As they descended, Senior Brother Liu continued: "The second stage begins now. Those competing for ranks 11–20, step onto the platforms."

The moment he finished speaking, Zhang Jing heard heavy footsteps beside him, which then faded. Opening his eyes, he met Ji Bochang's gaze.

Seeing Zhang Jing still rooted in place, Ji Bochang asked in surprise, "Brother Zhang, it's the second stage. Aren't you going up?"

"I'll wait a little longer," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.

"You're waiting for—" Ji Bochang cut himself off as realization dawned. He stared at Zhang Jing, dumbfounded.

"You..." He pointed at the two top-tier prodigies, then stammered, "The third stage? The top ten?"

Zhang Jing nodded.

"Brother Zhang, you..."

Dazed, Ji Bochang turned and walked toward the platforms, his face numb.

Another large group departed. Only sixteen remained.

Though battles raged on the platforms, countless eyes were fixed on these sixteen. Under these rules, their presence here meant absolute confidence in their strength.

With the two top-tier prodigies guaranteed the top spots, it was effectively fourteen competing for eight places.

Nearly half of these elite geniuses would be eliminated in the third stage.

The coming clashes would be earth-shaking.

A strange fire ignited in every heart, stirring restless excitement.

High above, Senior Brother Liu spotted Zhang Jing among the sixteen. He remembered this junior brother well.

"Tsk, second-level Qi Refining. Junior Brother, you've given me quite the surprise."
