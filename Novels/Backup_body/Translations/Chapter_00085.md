# Chapter 85: The Creditor... Has Arrived!  

The main hall of Feather Transformation Immortal Sect was abuzz with disbelief.  

What had initially seemed like a simple case of a young disciple stealing spirit stones—though embarrassing—should have been easily resolved once the culprit was apprehended. After all, the incident had occurred within the sect’s jurisdiction, and strict orders had been issued to local authorities to assist in the search. Elders and disciples from various peaks had been dispatched to capture the youth, making his capture seem inevitable.  

But who could have imagined that this same youth would defeat Lu Huaiyuan, the sect’s foremost true disciple?  

Now, Lu Huaiyuan had sent word that only a Human Immortal could suppress Li Zhengjing. This revelation sent shockwaves through the sect’s upper echelons, alarming even the Human Immortal-level Supreme Elders.  

"Lu Huaiyuan has been at the peak of True Qi for over a decade, his cultivation flawless. How could he lose to this boy? Wasn’t it said that Li Zhengjing has only been cultivating for less than a year?"  

"For someone to cause such upheaval in the sect after just a year of cultivation is already absurd!" an elderly man with a grave expression declared. "If he escapes, the sect’s reputation will be in tatters!"  

"Yet, one must admit, his talent is unparalleled in this era," another high-ranking elder mused.  

"With such potential, his future is limitless. He could contend for the position of Dao Child and even succeed as the next sect leader," the middle-aged-looking Array Pavilion Master remarked calmly. "Why would someone with such promise throw it all away for a few spirit stones?"  

All eyes turned to the Moon Ancient Peak Master, as Li Zhengjing had originated from his lineage. However, the peak master remained silent, his expression unreadable.  

"Though his crimes warrant death, if we capture him and discipline him properly, he may yet be redeemed," a Supreme Elder of Human Immortal level suggested, moved by the boy’s talent.  

"His character is flawed, his actions reckless, and his vision short-sighted. Such a person will never achieve greatness!" another elder countered. "Cultivation is not solely about talent. If we allow such a junior to rise within the sect, what does that say about our standards?"  

Debate raged on until a voice cut through the noise.  

"The details of the battle at the spirit mine have been compiled. According to the accounts of True Disciple Lin Chi and Moon Ancient Peak’s Elder Ling Xuan, Li Zhengjing possesses a unique constitution—his injuries heal instantly."  

"Lu Huaiyuan also mentioned that while Li Zhengjing’s cultivation is inferior, his combat prowess is extraordinary. Most importantly, no matter how severe his injuries, they vanish within moments..."  

"During their battle, Lu Huaiyuan claimed to have wounded Li Zhengjing thirty-two times, yet when the boy left, only his robes were torn—not a single scar remained."  

"Does this constitution sound familiar to anyone?"  

Silence fell over the hall.  

After a long pause, the Array Pavilion Master spoke in a low voice, "In the past, the Heavenly Azure Dao Lord possessed an innate Immortal Root Dao Body. Any injury he sustained healed instantly, making him fearless in battle—and eventually, invincible."  

"Such a constitution is rare beyond measure, seen only in the Heavenly Azure Dao Lord of the Kunlun Immortal Sect."  

"Could this boy… possess the same Immortal Root Dao Bone?"  

"If so, it’s no surprise he killed the Venom King Xin Xuan while still at the Inner Qi stage. Poison was useless against him, and his wounds healed effortlessly. Xin Xuan was like a tiger without claws in his presence."  

"The Heavenly Azure Dao Lord’s constitution—the foundation of his invincibility. If this boy truly has it…" A Supreme Elder’s voice deepened. "We must spare his life, capture him alive, and guide him properly. His potential is boundless! With less than a year of cultivation, he’s already achieved such feats. In a hundred years, our Feather Transformation Immortal Sect could produce a new Heavenly Azure Dao Lord!"  

"But he stole spirit stones and killed multiple elders and disciples!" the Array Pavilion Master argued. "That’s a capital offense!"  

"If we guide him well, he can atone for his crimes in the future!" the Supreme Elder retorted. "The Kunlun Immortal Sect rose to prominence precisely because of the Heavenly Azure Dao Lord’s invincibility! For the sake of our sect’s future, what are a few losses? Besides… the truth of this matter remains unclear. He may not even be guilty!"  

"This reflects poorly on the Moon Ancient Peak Master’s leadership!" another Supreme Elder interjected. "Perhaps he should be removed from the peak and brought to the main hall. I will personally instruct him in the righteous path and reform him!"  

The Moon Ancient Peak Master remained silent.  

Finally, a commanding voice echoed through the hall.  

"First, capture him. Whether he is to be executed or reformed can be decided later!"  

The speaker’s voice was deep and authoritative. "If we want him alive, trapping him in an array would be most effective. Junior Brother Yan, your mastery of arrays is unparalleled. You will be the one to apprehend him!"  

The Array Pavilion Master rose and bowed. "As the Sect Leader commands!"  

---  

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing sat in a cave, shoving spirit stones into his mouth one by one.  

"Master, aren’t you afraid of bursting?" the wall-clinging bird asked, somewhat enviously.  

"With spirit stones to eat, why fear bursting?" Li Zhengjing rolled his eyes.  

"By consuming these stones, you’re confirming your guilt in stealing them," Yuan Zhengfeng pointed out. "Even if the case is overturned and the Chen Clan’s crimes are exposed, you won’t be able to explain the missing stones. Just by eating them, you’ve already committed the crime of embezzlement."  

"Since things have come to this, I might as well strengthen myself and improve my chances of survival."  

Li Zhengjing circulated the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique within his body, generating Inner Qi in his organs, then refined it into True Qi using the Feather Transformation Ascension Immortal Art, using it to unblock his acupoints.  

He had consumed nearly a hundred graded spirit stones, leaving the ungraded ones untouched. The results were significant—he had unlocked nearly thirty more acupoints, bringing his total to forty-nine.  

"Once I reach a hundred acupoints, my True Qi will be able to manifest externally, truly entering the ranks of the accomplished."  

As he pondered this, he glanced outside the cave and spotted a falcon flying overhead. He retreated deeper into the cave, sighing.  

A mere falcon could be shot down with a flick of his finger. But if he did so, the Beast Taming Hall would pinpoint his location and surround him.  

Just like when he defeated Lu Huaiyuan, his whereabouts had been exposed. Now, the entire Feather Transformation Immortal Sect had sealed off a hundred-mile radius.  

Beyond this perimeter, elders and disciples from other peaks, along with local officials, had formed an impenetrable blockade. Every exit was sealed, and the search was closing in. It wouldn’t be long before he was discovered.  

"Every step is dangerous now. The sect’s eyes are everywhere. The moment I move, I’ll be detected," Yuan Zhengfeng lamented. "Even if you silence those who spot you, your location will still be exposed. There’s no way out."  

"You’re right, Elder Yuan. Killing isn’t the issue—it’s the exposure. Once they know where I am, escape is impossible." Li Zhengjing exhaled. "Not long ago, I killed Xin Xuan. Now, I’m in the same predicament he was."  

"It’s not the same," the wall-clinging bird chimed in encouragingly. "Xin Xuan was weak. Any sect elder could crush him in a fight. If he’d run into Lu Huaiyuan, he’d have been finished."  

"Exactly!" the Five Elements Creation Tree added. "Xin Xuan would’ve died instantly against Lu Huaiyuan, but Master here beat him up! Even if you die now, you’ve still outshone the Venom King!"  

"Can’t you two say something nice?" Li Zhengjing snapped, nearly drawing his blade.  

"Ignore these fools," Yuan Zhengfeng interjected. "Right now, movement is impossible. If you’re spotted and surrounded, a few sect elders working together could suppress you. And now that Lu Huaiyuan has lost, a Human Immortal will surely come."  

"A Human Immortal…" Li Zhengjing stroked his chin. "Committing a crime within the sect leaves no room for escape."  

"You’re a sect disciple, so they know you well. They underestimated your strength, thinking Lu Huaiyuan could handle you."  

Yuan Zhengfeng continued, "If they’d known your true power from the start, a Human Immortal would’ve been sent the moment the spirit mine incident came to light. I was once part of the Enforcement Hall, so I’m familiar with these procedures. Years ago, a Supreme Elder who defected to the Golden Ship of Salvation was intercepted and killed within the sect’s borders when he tried to flee."  

Li Zhengjing nodded. When he had escorted Ghost Valley Spirit Physician out, the process had seemed simple. But looking back, it was only because the physician had previously collaborated with the sect, and both sides had sworn oaths with mutual restrictions.  

More importantly, Ghost Valley Spirit Physician had likely informed the sect’s higher-ups in advance—it had all been an act to deceive the Golden Ship of Salvation. Otherwise, the physician would never have escaped the sect’s territory so easily.  

"You were part of the Enforcement Hall and know their methods. Can’t you find a way around this?" the Five Elements Creation Tree asked, waving its roots. "Big Brother, you can’t hold back now—"  

"Who’s your ‘Big Brother’?" Yuan Zhengfeng snapped. "Even a Human Immortal can’t act freely within the sect’s borders. That Supreme Elder who defected to the Golden Ship is proof enough. The Enforcement Hall knows the procedures, but the situation is hopeless now. No amount of strategy can save us."  

"We wait," Li Zhengjing said calmly, stroking the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Blade. "We wait for the Human Immortal to come for me, and for the creditor to come for him."  

"That’s all we can do," Yuan Zhengfeng agreed solemnly. "At the spirit mine, you displayed strength at the upper True Qi level, stirring up the entire sect. After defeating Lu Huaiyuan, your reputation has reached its peak."  

"Less than a year of cultivation, and only a Human Immortal can suppress me. The momentum is undeniable." Li Zhengjing’s expression was calm. "I’d say it’s enough."  

"Now, there’s only one problem left," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "If the creditor arrives first, our plan succeeds. But if the sect’s Human Immortal comes first… you’ll have to survive long enough for the creditor to appear."  

"After all this scheming and upheaval, just to meet the creditor," the wall-clinging bird sighed. "Back then, the white crane in the rear mountain refused to see me. I had to go through a lot of trouble just to get an audience."  

"Is that the same thing?" the Five Elements Creation Tree asked, confused.  

"How is it not? Both involve going to great lengths to meet someone you’re fixated on," the bird argued.  

"You wanted to preen its feathers. We want to kill the creditor," Yuan Zhengfeng said disdainfully.  

"How do you know I preened its feathers?" the bird gasped, then shouted, "Your father must’ve told you! Tree, how could you gossip behind my back?"  

"That’s not gossip—it’s the truth!" the tree retorted angrily.  

"Enough!"  

Li Zhengjing suddenly silenced them. After a moment of thought, he stepped out of the cave.  

He moved cautiously, avoiding disciples and the Beast Taming Hall’s creatures. But before he had gone far, he ducked behind a tree, climbing into its canopy. His gaze sharpened as he spotted a yellow dog three hundred yards away, scaling a slope and scanning the area.  

This was the same dog Li Zhengjing had raised with great care—once his closest companion.  

The dog was highly sensitive to his scent, having developed spiritual intelligence and become a spirit beast. It had likely sensed his presence nearby but couldn’t pinpoint his exact location. Suspecting he was in the area, it bared its teeth at the sky, barking angrily.  

"Is Big Yellow angry about my situation?" Li Zhengjing mused. "It must know I’ve been wronged."  

The wall-clinging bird peeked out. "I think it wants to bite you to death."  

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches. "Wait, didn’t you give it to that Beast Taming Hall female disciple? If it suspects we’re nearby, doesn’t that mean the hall has found us? We should run!"  

Just then, the dog barked again, raised a paw, and trotted away.  

"It’s going to report us?" the bird asked. "I’ll silence it and cook us some dog meat. Master, you’ve been eating spirit stones, but we’re starving!"  

Yuan Zhengfeng interjected, "The dog didn’t pinpoint our location. But even if it had, the Beast Taming Hall would already know. Killing it won’t help."  

The tree pondered. "It raised its paw as if telling us to go south?"  

The bird gasped. "There’s an ambush there! It’s luring us in!"  

Li Zhengjing adjusted the wutong wood box on his back. "No ambush. It’s warning us that searchers are coming from that direction. Big Yellow still remembers its old master. After all, I treated it like my own child."  

With that, he headed in the opposite direction, sprinting away.  

Along the way, he encountered numerous disciples. The skies were patrolled by the Beast Taming Hall’s spirit birds, while spirit beasts scoured the forests. Li Zhengjing couldn’t risk attacking, relying instead on Yuan Zhengfeng’s Human Immortal senses to evade detection narrowly.  

After covering fifty or sixty miles, Yuan Zhengfeng suddenly tensed.  

"Human Immortal!"  

Li Zhengjing suppressed his aura and hid.  

But at that moment, a voice rang out from the sky.  

"Everywhere else has been searched. Only this area remains. Li Zhengjing… come out."  

The speaker waved a hand. "I am the Array Pavilion Master. Before arriving, I spent half a day setting up an array spanning a hundred miles. You cannot escape."  

Li Zhengjing’s heart skipped a beat. He recognized the voice—this was the same Array Pavilion Master who had commissioned Fan Kaihu, the demonic creation of Ghost Valley Spirit Physician.  

This Elder Yan was no saint, despite his sect affiliation.  

"No more hiding!" Yuan Zhengfeng said urgently. "He’s confirmed you’re here. The array is already active—two miles in every direction."  

Li Zhengjing peeked out.  

High above, a man stood with one hand behind his back, the other weaving intricate patterns in the air. Beams of light descended, embedding into the earth.  

The moment Li Zhengjing looked up, their eyes met.  

"Profound Origin Fire Array. He’s going to burn everything within two miles—rocks, trees, beasts, insects—all reduced to ash."  

Yuan Zhengfeng’s voice was grim. "He sensed you the moment you looked at him. There’s no hiding now. Brace yourself, Little Friend Zhengjing."  

Li Zhengjing didn’t respond. He simply drew his blade and stepped forward.  

"You’ve cultivated for only a year, yet you’ve shaken the entire sect. Now, I’ve spent half a day sealing off a hundred-mile radius just for you. You should be proud."  

Elder Yan looked down, smiling faintly. "The higher-ups suspect you possess the same constitution as the Heavenly Azure Dao Lord. Let’s see if that’s true."  

His gaze sharpened.  

**Boom!**  

Flames erupted.  

Two miles of land ignited.  

The earth burned. Trees burned. Birds took flight, but beasts too slow to escape writhed in agony, howling before falling silent.  

Li Zhengjing found himself engulfed in fire. His robes incinerated instantly, his hair singed, his skin blistering and twisting. His eyes seared with pain, plunging him into darkness.  

The heat was unbearable. His vision was gone.  

Then—a muffled grunt from above.  

"Who dares attack me?!" Elder Yan roared before his voice faded into the distance.  

In the flames, Li Zhengjing felt a hand grip his shoulder.  

He swung his Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Blade blindly.  

**Clang!**  

The blade struck something metallic, and his wrist snapped from the recoil. The weapon clattered to the ground.  

His wutong wood box was yanked from his back and tossed aside with a thud.  

A familiar, aged voice spoke by his ear.  

"I spent a day setting up an array for you."  

"If you hadn’t lasted this long, it would’ve been fate."  

"But since you did, I’ll take you away."  

"This fruit… I’ll pluck it myself."  

The voice was lighthearted. Li Zhengjing felt a sudden chill as if he’d been pulled from the flames.  

Then—the world spun.  

The Heavenly Azure Dao Treasure’s vitality restored his vision.  

"Li Zhengjing, long time no see."  

The old man before him smiled warmly.  

Li Zhengjing recognized him, his expression complex. "So it’s you."  

His burns scabbed over, dead skin sloughing off as his body regenerated at a visible rate.  

"As expected of the Evergreen Holy Body."  

The old man’s smile widened. He took Li Zhengjing’s hand. "This is no longer the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. Welcome to… the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven."  

He patted Li Zhengjing’s shoulder. "No need to wait for the Moon Ancient Peak Master. Did he really think his tricks could fool me? From now on, stay here peacefully. I’ll show you the sights."  

He removed his outer robe and draped it over Li Zhengjing. "Don’t look so grim. Relax. After all… you’ll be dead soon."
