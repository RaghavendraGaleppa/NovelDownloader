Chapter 115: How Dare They Strike Back at Me

After dedicating his talent and efforts to researching how to upgrade the [Yama Hall], Lü Yang still glanced at the battlefield with a lingering sense of unfulfillment.

"What a pity, it will be impossible to achieve such results again in a short period."

After all, one had escaped. Once the opponent escaped back, they would definitely report his situation. As a result, the Buddhist cultivators probably wouldn't rashly gather again to deal with him.

"Tianhe greets True Person!"

Just as Lü Yang put away his Myriad Spirit Banner, Qin Tianhe scurried over, immediately bowing respectfully without a word, just like before.

Lü Yang could only smile helplessly at the sight. Unlike the time at Guarding Harmony Sea, he wasn't a true Foundation Establishment True Person after all. If he were to implicitly agree to this, it would be extremely troublesome once exposed.

Thus, he decisively said, "Senior Brother, you've misunderstood. I am Lü Yang, a newly promoted True Inheritance Disciple, not a Foundation Establishment True Person."

"...Lü Yang?" Qin Tianhe was instantly stunned. He had discussed that name with his friend Xu Xin before, but wasn't that just a newcomer who had just become a True Inheritance Disciple?

At this moment, the clever mind of a Saint Sect disciple began to spin wildly. First, he dismissed the possibility of Lü Yang not being a Foundation Establishment True Person. With such strength, killing Qi Condensation cultivators like cutting grass, who would believe you if you said you weren't a Foundation Establishment True Person?

"I understand!"

"What 'newly promoted True Inheritance Disciple'? This is clearly a Foundation Establishment True Person who deliberately concealed their identity and disguised themselves specifically for this War of Dao Seizure! This person before me must be a reincarnated True Person of our Saint Sect, deliberately taking on a new identity to bully the weak in this War of Dao Seizure and ensure our Saint Sect stands out! How insidious, truly insidious! As expected of a True Person of our Saint Sect!"

Watching Qin Tianhe's expression constantly change, Lü Yang felt a bit strange. "What are you thinking?"

At Lü Yang's words, Qin Tianhe jolted, then quickly shook his head. "No! Nothing! True Person is wise and mighty, this disciple is full of admiration!"

Lü Yang waved his hand again. "I told you, I'm not a True Person."

Qin Tianhe quickly nodded upon hearing this. "Yes, yes, yes, not a True Person. Our Saint Sect absolutely did not send a True Person in. Please rest assured, I understand now!"

*You beast, what do you understand?*

Lü Yang shook his head. Just as he was about to speak again, his brow suddenly furrowed. His divine sense picked up a sensation, and he looked up towards the distant horizon—

"Rumble!"

A grand sound reverberated, like ten thousand armies beating war drums, angry thunder rolling through the sky, as if something beyond a certain limit was rapidly approaching. Then, at the edge of the sky, a golden light slowly rose. The golden light traversed the ground, covering thousands of miles in almost a single leap, instantly illuminating Lü Yang's front, then suddenly parting to reveal layers of light and shadow.

Immediately after, from within the light and shadow, emerged solemn and dignified Buddhist cultivators. Some held Zen staffs, some wore kasayas, some wore prayer beads around their necks, some held golden alms bowls. All displayed strange forms: some had three heads and six arms, some had Dharma eyes on their foreheads. They arranged themselves in the air.

The next second, over a hundred Buddhist cultivators spoke in unison: "Amitabha!"

Four powerful words. Each word seemed like a thunderbolt exploding in the air, the rolling thunder echoing deafeningly, surging towards the two like a tidal wave!

"Ugh!" Qin Tianhe's face paled slightly. The Buddhist Sect's Thunder Sound Art grew stronger with more people. So many Buddhist cultivators speaking simultaneously was enough to have a considerable impact on him.

But at this moment, Lü Yang suddenly took a step forward. The divine sense transformed by the Heavenly Silkworm Secret Transformation showed no fear of the whistling Thunder Sound Buddha Chants. With one step, his divine sense swept out, and all the Buddhist sounds instantly vanished within three feet of his body, as if they had never appeared.

For a moment, Lü Yang faced a hundred, yet remained composed.

On the contrary, after seeing Lü Yang, Guanghui, the leader of this group of Buddhist cultivators, murmured inwardly: *Didn't they say there were dozens, even a hundred people?*

"Guangming?" Guanghui turned around, only to see Guangming looking awkward, not moving forward at all, but instead trying to squeeze further back. Guanghui's eyes darted, and he instantly understood.

*Misreporting the situation again?*

"Useless!" Guanghui cursed softly, then looked at Lü Yang again. Although Guangming had caused them to mobilize such a large force, it was an unintended benefit. If the opponent could indeed defeat Guangming and his dozen Buddhist cultivators by himself, then if they had underestimated him and only brought a few dozen, they might not have been able to subdue him. But now, with the 108 Buddhist cultivators of the [Dragon Host] gathered, it should be foolproof.

Thinking of this, Guanghui suddenly smiled. "Benefactor, how about we make a deal?"

"...A deal?"

"Indeed." Guanghui pointed at Qin Tianhe, continuing, "Benefactor, if you hand over that devil behind you, you may leave on your own."

—This was, of course, nonsense.

However, in Guanghui's view, although Qin Tianhe was far inferior to Lü Yang, he still held a certain status. If the two joined forces, there might be a slim chance of survival. But there was never any unity among devils. Under pressure, they were very likely to betray their fellow disciples. Similar incidents had happened before, so Guanghui wanted to use this tactic to trick Lü Yang. If he could sow discord between him and Qin Tianhe, all the better.

However, Lü Yang merely sneered after hearing this. To be frank, if he were truly in a desperate situation where betraying his teammates could ensure his escape, he wouldn't mind doing so. Better a dead fellow practitioner than a dead poor me, after all.

But the premise was that it had to be a desperate situation.

"You all are still far from it."

Lü Yang shook his head, flicked his sleeve, and smiled. "Since you've all come, there's no need to leave today. I happen to need talented individuals like yourselves."

Guanghui's brow furrowed upon hearing this. "Benefactor, you are but one person. Must you engage in this trapped beast's struggle?"

"Who is the trapped beast, that's yet to be seen."

As his words fell, Guanghui's pupils suddenly constricted. He subconsciously looked up and around, only to see that the previously clear sky had, at some unknown point, become shrouded in black mist.

Clang, clang—!

The black mist churned, the clang of armor continuous. Soon, Yin Soldiers and Ghost Generals, clad in sturdy armor and holding sharp weapons, strode forth, gazing at the Buddhist cultivators. Some even saw the figures of Buddhist cultivators who had previously fallen in battle among them.

"Junior Brother Yuanjue?"

"Junior Brother Yuanhao is here too!"

"What is that!?"

"Rumble!"

An earthquake-like sound spread out. It was the enormous noise of thousands of Witch Ghouls marching in unison, encompassing everything above and below!

Although the [Dragon Host] Guanghui had brought this time were elites—108 Buddhist cultivators, the weakest of whom were at mid-Qi Condensation—they were now surrounded by tens of thousands of Witch Ghouls! From early Qi Condensation to perfected Qi Condensation, they had everything, truly like a small sect!

"What in the hell is this!?"

"Wait, wait, Benefactor..."

Before Guanghui could finish his words, the sky-piercing shouts of battle drowned out his voice. The overwhelming Yin-Sha qi even obscured the pervasive Buddhist light.

Beside Lü Yang, Grandmaster Tingyou's figure reappeared, looking helpless: "Didn't I say not to disturb me?"

"My apologies, Grandmaster." Lü Yang also shook his head: "After all, I didn't expect... these bald donkeys, after being killed by me once, not only didn't flee, but even dared to strike back!"
