Chapter 273: The Noble Maiden's Shyness, Good and Bad News, The Dual Pupils Reappear, The Flower Cage Altar Gathering

The evening sun poured its last light, casting shimmering rays like liquid gold. The elegant light boat drew close to the flower ship. The figure inside tapped a toe against the water and shot straight up, lightly drifting sideways before taking another step and landing steadily on the deck.

The flower ship drifted along the river, the deck empty of any trace. The sails were furled, and no one knew a guest had boarded, maintaining the original silence.

The person headed straight for the cabin, walking with a graceful, swaying gait as if they were extremely familiar with the ship's layout. Through the narrow, winding corridors, they turned left and right, sometimes stepping east, sometimes west.

*They must be proficient in Feng Shui and机关 (mechanisms)...*

Ye Cheng suddenly had a premonition. He pushed away the beauties beside him, causing the women to cry out in alarm, their clothes scattered everywhere. Ye Cheng casually picked up two pieces, draped them over his body, put on his shoes and socks, and quickly walked out.

This flower ship was named the "Jade Flower." It was funded by the Flower Cage Sect and built by the Jade City. The former Sect Master gifted the ship to Ye Cheng, handing over all the ship's schematics and the uses of its mechanisms to him.

He had studied them for years, mastering all the important mechanical paths. Turning left and then right... with light footsteps, he instantly moved from his residence on the third floor to the narrow passage on the first floor.

He blocked the path of the incoming guest.

He said respectfully, "Ferryman, I failed to welcome you properly. Please forgive me."

The one boarding was the Flower Cage Sect's "Ferryman," named Jin Shichang. The Flower Cage Sect had a terrible reputation and was an enemy of all sects in the martial world. If they were not careful, they could be overturned at any moment. Therefore, they acted with extreme caution. Whenever involving the sect's important grounds, one needed the "Ferryman" to guide them inside.

Jin Shichang said, "It's fine. Even if you wanted to welcome me, you wouldn't have the ability." His voice was sharp and thin, a male body with a feminine demeanor. His waist was slender but his shoulders were broad and thick; his black hair flowed like a waterfall but his arms were thick and strong. His walking posture was graceful, yet his face was rough and rugged.

Ye Cheng smiled and said, "That's true."

Ye Cheng continued, "Ferryman, please come in. I will set up a banquet to entertain you and trouble you to stay for a few days. Then you can lead us into the Water Altar to attend the grand gathering."

Jin Shichang said, "Good."

Ye Cheng arranged everything personally. He prepared the residence on the third floor and served fine wine and dishes. The Flower Cage Sect revered the ways of the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams, strange skills and cunning techniques, formation arrays, and Feng Shui.

Ye Cheng had fled along the way, wanting to return to the "Water Altar." He steered the flower ship through winding waterways to shake off the pursuing troops. But even he did not know the location of the Water Altar.

He could only linger on the river, waiting for the Ferryman to pick him up and steer the ship into the Water Altar. The so-called "Ferryman" was a major position in the Flower Cage Sect. They never left the altar mouth in their lifetime, dedicated to ferrying disciples coming and going.

Their status was extremely prestigious.

Ye Cheng dared not neglect him. Leaving or entering the altar required troubling Jin Shichang, so he had prepared jewelry and ornaments early on to give as gifts, catering to his preferences.

Jin Shichang had a male body but a feminine appearance. He particularly loved "jewelry and fine artifacts," and his favorite were the pearl artifacts by the famous contemporary master "Snow Marquis." Ye Cheng had failed to obtain them, which disappointed him slightly. However, the many other jewelry and fine artifacts he bought kept him entertained for a long time, so he wasn't angry.

He lay resting on the third floor, drinking and appreciating paintings with Ye Cheng, playing with jewelry and fine artifacts. Ye Cheng knew Jin Shichang's temperament well; he didn't like women. So he dismissed all the beautiful women and conversed with him about the way of jewelry and fine artifacts.

The setting sun faded, and the water surface turned pitch black. Li Xian's Dual Pupils透视 (penetrated), seeing the ceaseless river flow, not knowing where he was.

The Great Martial River veins were crisscrossed, interwoven and winding, as dense as woven cloth. Accompanied by towering mountains and lush forests, even looking down from a ten-thousand-zhang high mountain, it would be difficult to sort out the river's veins.

Wen Caishang was in close pursuit, looking for her husband. Li Xian was forced to use the Blue Water River to sneak away, accidentally landing on the pirate ship. By then, he was already far from the Blue Water River.

After sailing on the flower ship for several days, the river entered the river, the river returned to the river... twisting and turning around. The surrounding mountains and terrain were neither "Heavy Ridge Prefecture" nor "Poor Heaven Prefecture."

Li Xian calmed his mind, closed his eyes, and rested. At the Yin and Mao hours (3-7 AM), he followed the others to practice martial arts. His progress was extremely fast, and the [Flying Snake Hand] had reached minor completion. His comprehension was outstanding, coupled with "Heaven's Way rewards diligence," diligence must lead to progress, and progress must lead to gain.

The days on the flower ship were dull yet fulfilling.

Several days passed quietly.

Practicing martial arts every day at the Yin and Mao hours, and spending the remaining time practicing "Blood Vomiting Code" and "Five Organs Expelling Turbidity." Li Xian became familiar with Qiao Sanyan. As for the others, he hadn't spoken to them until now.

Since Li Xian had no intention of joining them, he didn't socialize much.

If there were any interesting things, there were indeed some. Every day at noon, he fed Bian Qiaoqiao and Nangong Liuli. Li Xian had a wicked mind and couldn't be called a gentleman. He often took the opportunity to tease the two girls.

After they finished eating and drinking, Li Xian cleaned up the soup box. During this free time, he would open a topic, chatting about everything and gossiping about miscellaneous matters.

He took the opportunity to inquire about the situation of Daoxuan Mountain and the Nangong family. Bian Qiaoqiao had a simple mind, while Nangong Liuli was calm and deep. Therefore, he often chatted about Daoxuan Mountain and learned some news. But the Nangong family was very mysterious and always revealed little.

Nangong Liuli used the times Li Xian fed her to secretly remember the days she had been captured. Through her conversations with Li Xian, her spirit gradually ignited. She was unwilling to sink into despair, her mind agile, constantly thinking of escape strategies.

But the method used by the Flower Cage Sect to bind them was truly ingenious. It was always difficult to break the shackles. She was at the mercy of the ship's movements, feeling unbearably stifled.

Li Xian's movements were restricted.

The flower ship's passages were complex. Without permission, one could not walk around freely.

Although Li Xian had relatively more freedom, the places he could go were only four: his private bedroom, the deck, the bottom prison cell, and the dining hall.

The bedroom had very few mechanisms and wasn't worth studying, but the walls were incredibly tough. The deck and dining hall were crowded and eye-catching; revealing his Dual Pupils there would be seeking death.

Only the bottom prison cell allowed him to see many mechanisms. Delving into their secrets, he didn't know if they would be useful, but since he had spare time, he tried to do it as much as possible.

He covered the two girls' eyes to reveal his Dual Pupils and spy on the mechanisms.

It was inevitable that he would glimpse the two girls' bodies. The penetrating power unintentionally "harmed" them, revealing all their intimate secrets. He secretly noted that Nangong Liuli was indeed older; she looked dignified and elegant, but inside, she hid a fiery passion.

At that time, spring passed and summer arrived. It gradually became stuffy and hot. The scorching sun baked the flower ship, making it like a steamer on the water. The two girls felt even more unbearably stuffy, sweat dripping from their hair tips. Bian Qiaoqiao wore long boots made of tanned animal hide, which were heroic and stylish, beautiful yet convenient. This section, however, brought her great suffering; her feet were unbearably hot. When she glanced sideways at Nangong Liuli, she envied her for having one embroidered shoe fallen off. Although her bare foot was exposed, it was cooler. This situation was embarrassing to mention, so she could only endure it.

That noon, Li Xian carried the soup box and walked through the winding narrow passages, pondering the recent situation. He pitied the two girls'遭遇 (遭遇). Through their conversations, he knew that Bian Qiaoqiao was naturally arrogant and willful, while Nangong Liuli was generous and proper. Neither were evil people. If conditions allowed, he was willing to help.

However, he felt the situation becoming more complex, and his own safety was uncertain.

The ship didn't touch the shore, the water was vast, and land was out of sight. It seemed to have arrived in a lake. Yet the lake surface was like the sea, with waves several zhang high splashing. At night, the green moon hung in the sky, and the water shimmered with silver light.

The fruits, vegetables, and meat in the cabin were all eaten up. They didn't dock to buy supplies, but caught fish locally to eat.

The river fish caught were all sharp-toothed and fierce, biting at people upon encounter. Even though Li Xian possessed the Blue Water Pearl, it was difficult to escape by diving into the river. Without the need for the flower ship crew to search and capture, being torn apart by the fierce fish was a great danger.

Morning mist shrouded the vast lake. Green vegetation could be seen growing out of the water.

Li Xian guessed he had arrived at a secret water area. To try to escape now would be extremely difficult. Coincidentally, he had gained some insights while spying on the mechanisms. He couldn't help but hesitate.

Bian Qiaoqiao and Nangong Liuli made "呜呜" sounds and shook their bodies. Although they were ashamed of Li Xian's actions and cursed him as "thief scum," "grandson thief," "pervert thief"... since being captured, they had nothing to do. Li Xian's words were interesting; every time he came to feed them, chatting and joking, it really relieved much of their boredom.

Li Xian skillfully unlocked the iron chains, pushed open the prison door, and placed the soup on the table. He helped the two girls loosen their tongues. Bian Qiaoqiao and Nangong Liuli spat out the hemp walnuts. They truly hated this thing, wishing they could crush it into powder.

Bian Qiaoqiao rotated her ankles; her socks were soaked through, extremely hot. Her cheeks were flushed, steamed until her clothes were damp with sweat. She said, "Little thief Hua, why are you so late today?"

Li Xian said, "Strange and odd, how do you know I'm late? There's no water clock here." Bian Qiaoqiao said, "I guessed it, is that not allowed?"

Nangong Liuli murmured, "My sister and I have been captured by you. It's hard to escape, and hanging here like this is really tiring. Can you report to the upper levels for us and ask them to loosen these ropes a bit?"

Li Xian said, "It's possible. But whether it works or not depends entirely on Elder Ye's decision."

Nangong Liuli said, "Then I thank you." She felt bitter. To be able to relax a little, she was willing to speak softly.

Li Xian opened the soup box, inside was fish soup, steaming hot. Bian Qiaoqiao frowned and said, "Why is it fish again? I've been eating fish for several days." Li Xian said, "Supplies on the ship are scarce. It's good enough to have fish to eat."

Nangong Liuli stared intently. Hearing that supplies were scarce, she immediately guessed that the ship had been sailing for a long time without touching shore, so supplies were hard to replenish, and they had to catch river fish to eat. Her family probably couldn't help; the vast river waves... completely hid their tracks. There was no longer a "Nangong Liuli" in the world.

Li Xian said, "Alright, eat the food." He夹着 (picked up) the fish meat and fed it over. Bian Qiaoqiao pressed her red lips against the chopsticks, tasting the fish. The meat was slightly fishy, but the cooking skill was acceptable, and the seasoning was moderate, not bad at all.

This river fish had many strange bones. If one wasn't careful, they would get stuck in the throat. Li Xian was very thoughtful, pulling out the stray bones before feeding the fish meat. Seeing him so attentive, Bian Qiaoqiao felt complex emotions. She enjoyed this considerate treatment, yet it was this thief who captured her.

She said, "Hey, where exactly are you taking us?"

Li Xian said, "I'm just a small fry, how would I know these things?"

Bian Qiaoqiao said, "Helping the tyrant and plundering, a shameful villain." But she didn't let the fish meat fall.

Li Xian pulled out a fish bone, his movements pausing. He suddenly thought that he had been drawing mechanisms and spying on the flower ship's hidden secrets, and had already achieved some results. Saving the two girls and escaping might be difficult. But if he escaped alone, there might be a few chances of success.

But the risk was extremely high. He was now a nominal disciple of the Flower Cage Sect, his life was safe. He wanted to escape this place entirely because he didn't want to be in the same boat with them. If he were to escape, he must seek "absolute safety." Otherwise, it's better not to escape.

Taking such a great risk to escape was not considered safe.

Therefore, he hesitated.

But for this risky opportunity, Nangong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao might not refuse. Trapped in the Flower Cage, they would probably be willing to gamble their lives!

Li Xian's eyes flickered, secretly observing the two girls. Bian Qiaoqiao didn't察觉 (detect), but Nangong Liuli敏锐 (keenly) caught it. She couldn't help but frown but didn't say much.

Li Xian finished feeding Bian Qiaoqiao. He picked out the fish bones again, preparing Nangong Liuli's food. While chatting, he said, "By the way, it's getting into summer recently. There are no windows or wind here, isn't it stuffy?"

Bian Qiaoqiao said, "As if you need to say. What can we do about it." She muttered in her heart: *My boots can pour out water. I'm about to die of heat.*

Li Xian removed the fish bones. He fed Nangong Liuli, taking advantage of the two girls being unprepared. Li Xian's hand gently stroked, cutting off a strand of Nangong Liuli's hair.

*Bian Qiaoqiao has a simple mind and isn't suitable for plotting. This Nangong Liuli speaks sharply and has quite the air of a great family.*

He secretly channeled his Inner Qi, using the "Blue Silk Palm" palm force. He controlled his Qi like a thread, making the hair strand stand suspended. His fingers lightly pinched, using the "Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword"... treating the hair strand as a soft, thin sword.

He lightly划过 (scratched) the exposed sole of her foot. Nangong Liuli's sole trembled; the hair strand brushed over, mixed with a trace of heat. The sensation was clear, scratching right into her heart.

Nangong Liuli was furious, glaring at Li Xian. She wanted to condemn him. Li Xian used the "hair strand as a sword," quietly writing on her sole: *Don't speak.*

Nangong Liuli's mind was agile. She suddenly felt something was wrong and swallowed her angry words. While Li Xian was feeding her fish, he used the hair strand to secretly communicate again: *Want to escape?*

Nangong Liuli was startled, suspecting in her heart: *What does this kid mean? Is he deliberately teasing me? Why doesn't he just speak directly? Why does he have to tickle my foot?*

After being lightly tickled, she couldn't help but feel a chill. Li Xian pinched the strand with two fingers. The sword moves he displayed were extremely subtle. Nangong Liuli was shocked and ashamed, secretly amazed that his swordsmanship attainment was not shallow.

Li Xian pinched the strand to communicate: *Don't show any abnormality. This prison cell hides mechanisms. The sound of our conversation will be overheard.*

Nangong Liuli nodded. Li Xian pinched the strand again: *Don't make big movements. Look at the four lamps front and back.*

Nangong Liuli looked around. She could only see the two lamps in front. Li Xian suddenly pushed. Nangong Liuli cried out in alarm, swinging and flying like a swing. Her body spun continuously,借机 (taking the opportunity) to see the two lamps behind.

Nangong Liuli cursed: "Bastard thief! I will never forgive you!" Her anger was deep, but it was a deliberate pretense. Her skirt fluttered, not yet settled, her gaze burning as she looked at Li Xian.

She wanted to ask: *What are the lamps for?*

Li Xian was very vigilant. After observing the mechanisms for several days, he had achieved results. He pinched the strand and replied: *The halo shines and falls on the hidden mirrors in the dark. The scene should be transmitted to Ye Cheng's bedroom.*

Nangong Liuli's heart tightened. She felt extremely desperate. Being hung in the air was bad enough, but her voice was also monitored, and her body was watched... even if she had heaven-defying powers, it would be hard to escape even a little.

*Am I a Great Luo Golden Immortal? Why the need for such precautions?* She was full of resentment. In fact, these mechanisms were cleverly set up when the ship was built. Nangong Liuli was unlucky to happen to experience them.

Li Xian pinched the hair and transmitted: *The light here is dim, I can only see the general outline. It's like observing shadows. So if I use the hair strand to talk, they will find it hard to detect.*

Nangong Liuli suddenly understood, feeling that Li Xian was meticulous. He spoke with such conviction that she couldn't help but trust him.

Nangong Liuli opened her mouth to speak. But she feared the prison cell transmitting sound and dared not speak. If she didn't speak, it would be hard to communicate, how could she be saved? She was extremely conflicted.

Suddenly, she felt an itch on her sole. The fine hair strand brushed over. She guessed Li Xian's handwriting through the touch. Li Xian communicated: *Don't speak. Just blink. Left eye for yes, right eye for no. I'll guess what you want to say.*

Nangong Liuli nodded, blinking her left eye lightly.

Li Xian pondered, while chatting casually and communicating with the strand: *You must be suspicious, who am I?*

Nangong Liuli blinked, meaning yes. Li Xian said: *I accidentally boarded the pirate ship. To save my life, I joined the Flower Cage Sect.*

Nangong Liuli suddenly realized: *Ah! So that's it... He said before that he just joined the Flower Cage Sect. He's also a pitiful person. I cursed him so much before, yet he wasn't angry and even tried to help... really...*

Her beautiful eyes were full of gratitude, yet she felt extremely shy. Li Xian pinched the strand and tickled her foot, secretly communicating: *Originally, I was preparing to escape when the ship docked. As for you two, if I could save you, I would; if not, I would help within my power.*

*But the situation developed unexpectedly. This ship hides secrets and hasn't docked. Now we've entered a strange water area, having left the river channel. It seems to be in a lake.*

Nangong Liuli's sole was incredibly itchy, her face flushed red. She forced herself to calm down and analyze Li Xian's words. She then knew the situation was very worrying.

Li Xian wanted to say more when he suddenly heard footsteps approaching. Qiao Sanyan walked over and called out, "Junior Brother Hua, you've been feeding for a long time. Could it be you're reluctant to leave?"

Nangong Liuli trembled all over, her eyes full of worry. The prison cell really did hide mechanisms. She was deeply afraid Li Xian would be exposed and lose his life. The Flower Cage Sect captured women and killed men, which was known throughout the martial world.

Li Xian laughed and said, "Alas, lately eating fish, there are many hidden bones. These two little girls have no hands or feet. Wouldn't they get choked by the bones? So I showed great mercy and helped them pick out the fish bones, which took quite a while."

Bian Qiaoqiao glared and said, "Hmph! That's what you should do. Admiring this Grandma's beautiful face, making you pick out fish bones, do you dare complain?"

Nangong Liuli sneered: "We're giving you face by eating the food. You scum don't know what's good for you."

Qiao Sanyan said, "Junior Brother Hua, you see, these women don't know gratitude. This task is both dangerous and tiring. Should I find someone to replace you?"

Li Xian said, "Ah! Replace me?"

Bian Qiaoqiao looked over, Nangong Liuli lowered her head, hope instantly vanished. Qiao Sanyan said, "Yes."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Senior Brother Qiao, I think there's no need." Qiao Sanyan said, "Junior Brother Hua, could it be... you like these two women? I need to tell you, for ordinary disciples of our Flower Cage Sect, liking a captured woman is a big taboo."

Qiao Sanyan looked over the two women and said, "These two women are indeed beautiful. After long contact, their appearance and smiles are imprinted in your heart. It's hard to avoid developing feelings gradually."

Nangong Liuli thought: *Developing feelings? He's a stranger who offered help. Could it... could it really be... ah... then with me in this state, everything has been seen, isn't that so embarrassing?*

Her face was very red, glancing twice at Li Xian. Her sole was slightly itchy, and the scene of their conversation just now appeared before her eyes again. But it added a touch of romance.

Li Xian said, "Senior Brother Qiao, to be honest with you." He put his arm around Qiao Sanyan's shoulder, leaned against the prison cell, and said, "I don't want to be replaced because... I want to make a contribution!"

Qiao Sanyan asked in surprise: "Make a contribution?" Li Xian said, "Exactly. These two women are very chaste and fierce, wanting to starve themselves to death. I have a way to feed them. Elder Ye will naturally notice me."

Li Xian said, "As long as I hold this position, Elder Ye will know of me every day. If he needs to select someone for promotion in the future, wouldn't I have an advantage?"

He knew that these words would be transmitted to Ye Cheng's ears through the holes in the prison cell. So he said it deliberately.

Qiao Sanyan said, "Junior Brother Hua, your mind is so deep. It turns out you were planning this." Nangong Liuli heard Li Xian's sincere words and couldn't help but feel her heart suspended again. Observing Li Xian twice, this person was unpredictable, mysterious to the extreme, sometimes distant, sometimes close... It was hard to tell which sentences were true and which were false... impossible to fathom.

*Would he really施加援手 (offer help) and save me from fire and water?*

Li Xian cleaned up the leftovers and stuffed the hemp walnuts back into their mouths. He left with Qiao Sanyan.

Nangong Liuli, after this incident, felt both hope and despair. Her mind was in chaos, her head full of thoughts trying to figure out Li Xian's character and his true intentions...

Bian Qiaoqiao didn't understand. Hearing Li Xian's earlier speech, he actually treated her as a tool for making contributions. She felt extremely humiliated and decided not to eat another bite of the food Li Xian brought.

The iron chains locked the prison door tight. In the narrow passage on the bottom floor, Qiao Sanyan and Li Xian walked one after the other. The candles on both sides were dim.

Li Xian asked, "Senior Brother Qiao, for women like these, what is their usual outcome?"

Qiao Sanyan said, "Alas... to be honest. Even if captured, these women's lives are better than ours."

Li Xian said, "Oh?" Qiao Sanyan said, "Our Flower Cage Sect only captures beautiful women from wealthy families. Naturally, it's for profit or lust. To be honest, I vaguely heard Elder Ye mention it once."

"These two women were captured because someone hired us. It involves some kind of dispute. But who exactly, it's hard for me to know. And that person seemed to have handed over the处置 (disposal) rights of the two women to our Flower Cage Sect. Plus... the elder who originally captured the two women is dead."

"If I'm not wrong, these two women should become [beautiful companions]."

Li Xian returned to his room, moved the filth, and practiced internally in peace. Qiao Sanyan met Ye Cheng and repeated everything said in the prison cell.

Ye Cheng nodded slightly, very satisfied. Although the Flower Cage Sect had many disciples, most were lustful and incompetent. This kid had a plan and wanted to advance, so he could be used.

Qiao Sanyan asked, "Elder Ye, should we still change someone to feed them?" Ye Cheng thought: *Since this kid has ability, give him a chance to perform. Besides, the prison cell is full of mechanisms, and the ship's passages are winding and twisting. Even if her hands and feet were free, letting her run for several days, she would have a hard time getting out.*

At this point, they had already broken through the encirclement and were about to enter the Flower Cage Sect's "Water Altar," so his mind was relaxed, and the management was slightly looser. The Flower Cage Sect disciples on the ship changed their martial arts practice time to the "Chen and Si" hours (7-11 AM).

No longer needing to reverse day and night.

This place was "Dongran Lake." It was known as one of the three great "lakes" in Yunnan Dao. The lake area was vast as the sea, endless. It was even号称 (called) the "Number One Lake in Yunnan Dao."

Li Xian had unconsciously arrived at a rare and strange landscape. Although all he saw was a faint white mist, with no magnificent scenery.

The Chen and Si hours passed.

Li Xian leaned against the railing, observing the lake surface, secretly pondering:

"The waters here are vast. I sink as soon as I enter the water. The lake bottom is dark and pitch black, hard to distinguish direction, and definitely full of hidden dangers. Even if I sneak into the lake when no one is paying attention, it would be hard to escape."

"I wonder if Nangong Liuli and Bian Qiaoqiao have the ability to escape from such a dangerous place. They come from great clans. Facing the 'Clear Ascends, Turbid Descends' characteristic, they might have a way to alleviate it. If they really can't, even if they can escape the flower ship, they can only resign themselves to fate."

The situation was like water, changing in an instant.

Li Xian diligently practiced martial arts, refining the "Flying Snake Hand."

[Flying Snake Hand]
[Proficiency: 2569/3000 Great Completion]

The martial art was gradually reaching great completion. The moves returned to simplicity, natural and seamless. Many Flower Cage Sect disciples were far inferior. Seeing that Li Xian was indeed a talent, Ye Cheng nodded in praise, a smile on his face.

At noon.

The dining hall cooked the fish roughly. The scales and guts weren't cleaned properly, and the cooking was extremely fishy. Li Xian suppressed his disgust and ate the fish clean.

He then found Ye Cheng and truthfully told him the two girls' plea. Ye Cheng said, "They've been hanging for half a month. Those little bitches won't be able to cause any waves. Letting them down to loosen their waists is fine." He nodded in agreement.

Li Xian prepared the fish soup and entered the dungeon. The candlelight was dim, casting a gloomy light. Since yesterday, Nangong Liuli's mind had been full of Li Xian. Hearing footsteps approaching, she immediately looked up. Her gaze was complex, both fearful and... indescribable.

"You... what kind of person are you exactly?" Full of doubts.

Bian Qiaoqiao glared at him, saying "呜呜" (muffled). "Good! Grandson thief, you dare come again!" As soon as Li Xian unlocked the prison door and stepped in, Bian Qiaoqiao twisted her waist and swung her body towards him.

Li Xian raised his hand to grab her and threw her far away. Bian Qiaoqiao "呜呜"惨叫 (wailed), spinning rapidly in the air. Li Xian laughed: "Submit?"

Bian Qiaoqiao said, "I submit, I submit." She admitted defeat this time.

Li Xian opened the soup box; two red fish steamed hot. The meat of this kind of fish was rough and fishy. But everyone on the ship, up and down, was eating this fish.

Li Xian untied the hemp walnuts. The two girls coughed a few times and could speak again. Li Xian laughed: "Sister Bian, will you eat?"

Bian Qiaoqiao cursed: "I won't eat!" Li Xian said, "Sister Liuli... will you eat?"

Nangong Liuli frowned and stared at Li Xian. She really couldn't see through what Li Xian was thinking. She had always been smart and calm, and was also a standout in her family. Her martial arts talent was outstanding, and managing the family affairs was top-notch.

Judging people and matters... she was supposed to be sharp and precise. But Li Xian's back was to the candlelight, his face dark, sometimes bright, sometimes dark, sometimes close, sometimes far, sometimes intimate, sometimes distant. He was neither from an orthodox sect, a gentleman bound by rules, nor from an unorthodox sect, lewd and wild.

He formed his own style... very hard to fathom. Nangong Liuli said, "Bian Qiaoqiao, now is not the time to赌气 (赌气). We need to eat and drink our fill to have a chance. Later, we will kill this villain."

Bian Qiaoqiao said, "Alright."

Li Xian laughed: "Sister Liuli is indeed magnanimous. Today I came with one good news and one bad news. Which do you want to hear first?"

Nangong Liuli said, "Hmph, just say them together."

Li Xian said, "The good news is... Elder Ye is merciful and allows me to let you down to接接地气 (connect with the earth). Don't really become fairies and float away."

Bian Qiaoqiao and Nangong Liuli both felt a joy.

Bian Qiaoqiao asked, "Then what's the bad news?"

Li Xian said, "Alas... we are about to enter the Water Altar. By then, even if you have heaven-defying powers, you absolutely won't be able to escape."
