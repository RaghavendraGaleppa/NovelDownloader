# Chapter 192: A Windfall

A fierce battle raged across the three sacred mountains of the Demonic Path's headquarters. Countless streaks of spiritual light crisscrossed the sky while hundreds of thousands of cultivators roared below, their war cries shaking the heavens as thunderous rune cannons boomed across the land.

At the edge of the sect's protective formation, a man and a skeleton were furtively tinkering with something.

Lin Shan kept glancing nervously behind him, watching the flames of war and wiping sweat from his brow. "Hurry up! If the Confucian Sect discovers us, we're done for!"

"Stop rushing me! I'm working on it!" The Black Skeleton Monarch was frantically deciphering the formation, growing increasingly flustered as it muttered incoherently. After all, this was the combined protective formation of the three major demonic sects—far beyond the capabilities of a mere Formation Master like itself.

Pulling out a magical abacus from its storage pouch, the skeleton's bony fingers clattered across the beads while it muttered, "This doesn't make sense... Why is it like this? No, that's wrong... Hah! There's a flaw here... What's going on? There's even a counter-formation..."

Lin Shan crouched nearby, anxiously looking around for any approaching Confucian Sect disciplinary officers or battlefield scavengers. "Are you sure you can do this, bro?"

"Shut up!" The skeleton's already strained mental capacity nearly short-circuited under Lin Shan's nagging. It scratched its skull in frustration, looking almost deranged. "No, no, no! Why would it... Unless... Could this be the long-lost Hundred Formation Layering Technique?"

Lin Shan was completely lost by the skeleton's technical jargon. After a moment's hesitation, the Black Skeleton Monarch decisively tossed aside its abacus and began forcibly dismantling the formation with materials from its pouch, having given up on proper decryption.

The formation trembled violently under the skeleton's reckless assault, invisible ripples spreading across its surface as cracking sounds echoed through the air.

"Hmm? What's happening over there? Send someone to check!" The disturbance caught the attention of the Confucian alliance's commanders.

After its haphazard attempts, the skeleton realized the formation was only growing more complex—it had painted itself into a corner. "We're doomed! The architect of this formation must have been a Formation Grandmaster. I need to start over... I need a treasure-grade calculation tool! This magical implement can't handle this complexity!" The skeleton paced in circles, nearly losing its mind from frustration.

Lin Shan watched the skeleton's dramatic but ineffective performance with dismay. At this critical moment, Little Xin, the artifact spirit of the Void Star Plate, stepped forward. The chubby-cheeked girl cradled the artifact's true form as she began channeling stellar energies, her tiny fingers weaving intricate hand seals with dazzling speed.

The innate spiritual treasure—the Void Star Plate—began rotating slowly, its pointer spinning wildly across celestial patterns with crisp mechanical clicks. Miniature starlight formations poured into the protective barrier, finally forcing open a small gap.

The Black Skeleton Monarch stood frozen, its hollow eye sockets fixed on the Void Star Plate in what might have been awe or envy. Lin Shan shook it urgently. "Stop gawking and help!"

"R-right! Stop shaking me—you'll dislocate my bones!" 

Fortunately, after two years of Confucian assaults, the formation was already severely damaged. With the Void Star Plate's divine assistance and their combined efforts, they finally pried open a passage. 

"Quick, let's go!" The skeleton immediately scrambled through the gap. But at that moment, earth-shaking explosions erupted behind them.

Lin Shan turned just in time to witness an incredible sight—the colossal Buddha statue crowning one of the three demonic peaks had been shattered by several Nascent Soul experts, its massive fragments raining down across the battlefield. One enormous piece was hurtling directly toward them, landing just three miles ahead.

"A fragment of the Buddha statue!" Lin Shan's heart raced. This statue from the Black Lotus Sect's mountain peak had likely accumulated over a millennium's worth of faith energy from covert missionary work across the Lu Kingdom. Even if the sect's Nascent Soul elders had used most of it, there must still be strategic reserves remaining. 

This was an opportunity too good to pass up. "Heaven's gifts ignored become misfortunes!" Without hesitation, Lin Shan charged toward the fallen fragment as the skeleton shouted from outside the formation: "Have you lost your mind? This is our chance to escape!"

The Void Star Plate's spirit maintained the opening while the skeleton, though tempted to abscond with the spiritual treasure, was bound by their new contract and could only grudgingly help keep the passage stable.

Lin Shan reached the impact site within minutes, only to find nearly a hundred cultivators already fighting over the prize. 

"This fragment was struck down by my Kong family's elder—it belongs to us!" 
"Our Meng family elder participated too!" 
"You Confucian clans think you own everything!" 
"Our White Deer Academy has Nascent Soul ancestors too—we're not afraid of you!" 

Even disciplinary officers joined the fray, all rules forgotten in the face of such a valuable trophy. Lin Shan didn't hesitate—he activated his Cloud Bronze Heart Mirror and charged in with his Severing Water Sword. 

"I am the Bear Mountain Sage, disciple of the Pure Lotus Adept! Who dares challenge me?" The crowd faltered at his bold claim. 

"Bear Mountain Sage? Never heard of him." 
"Sounds like a bandit name." 
"Is there really a Nascent Soul expert called Pure Lotus Adept?" 

Lin Shan didn't elaborate. His treasure-grade sword cleaved through defensive artifacts like paper as his mirror deflected countless hidden attacks. Seeing his ferocity and powerful equipment, the mob turned their focus on eliminating him first. 

But Lin Shan had already reached the hundred-foot-tall fragment—likely less than a tenth of the original statue's size. Placing his hand on it, the enhancement interface appeared:

[Black Lotus Buddha Statue (Fragment)]
Quality: High-grade magical implement
Description: A vessel used by the Black Lotus Sect to gather faith energy for reviving the Green Lotus Fairy. Contains four soul imprints.
Enhancement Cost: 32 points
Ancient Charm: 138 points
Absorb? 

"138 points?! Just from a fragment?!" Lin Shan was stunned. The complete statue must have held over a thousand points! More shockingly, the Black Lotus Sect's centuries of faith collection wasn't for their Nascent Soul elders or some higher realm—it was to resurrect someone called the Green Lotus Fairy! This was a millennium's worth of untouched faith energy!

"Now that's a conspiracy..." The four soul imprints likely belonged to the sect's surviving elders—taking this fragment would make him a target. This went far deeper than he'd imagined, possibly explaining why the Confucian sects had attacked the demonic headquarters. These were dangerous waters for a minor player like him.

"Better take the charm and run—let them fight over the leftovers." Lin Shan absorbed the ancient charm and immediately activated a wind escape talisman, vanishing just as a barrage of spells obliterated his former position.

As Nascent Soul cultivators began descending to secure the area, Lin Shan knew pushing his luck would be suicidal. Returning to the formation's edge—now deserted as everyone had rushed toward the fragments—he found Little Xin still maintaining the opening. He recalled the spiritual treasure and fled with the skeleton in tow, leaving the apocalyptic battle behind. 

The windfall was his, but the deeper mysteries would have to wait.
