# Chapter 34: The Chief of the Law Enforcement Hall! A Single Word Decides Justice!

In Chen Yang's mind, it was almost certain—Li Zhengjing was the murderer!

Chen Bing and Zhou Mo had been sent by him to ambush Li Zhengjing!

The two had died this afternoon, and Li Zhengjing had returned to the mountain sect by evening!

Normally, traveling from the murder scene back to the mountain sect would take until nightfall.  
But if Li Zhengjing possessed a Swift Movement Talisman, it would make perfect sense!

With such a talisman, Li Zhengjing could have traveled to Daliao City to kill Chen Youyu, then detoured to Wanlin County—all within half a day!  
Given Li Zhengjing's current capability to kill Chen Bing and Zhou Mo, slaying Chen Youyu would be no challenge at all.

"Even if that black-robed evil cultivator was severely injured and missing an arm, the fact that Li Zhengjing could subdue him proves his strength is no trifle!"  
"This boy's growth is alarmingly fast—his progress surpasses even the current top true disciple, Lu Huaiyuan, and even the legendary Yuan Zhengfeng of the past!"  
"We cannot allow him to continue growing unchecked!"

Chen Yang was convinced Li Zhengjing was the culprit, yet he lacked definitive evidence to convict him.  
Lost in thought, he followed Xie Changqing to the Law Enforcement Hall's Records Pavilion.  

Along the way, he subtly signaled, and one of the disciples slipped away.  

Inside the Records Pavilion, twelve elders were on duty, documenting case files for the day.  
Xie Changqing and Chen Yang had come to submit the interrogation records of Li Zhengjing.  

But before they could organize the records, Xie Changqing turned abruptly, his face dark with anger.  

"Chen Yang, as a Law Enforcement Hall disciple on duty, you must remain rational and composed! You cannot condemn someone based on baseless speculation!"  

"I understand the rules!" Chen Yang bowed slightly. "But I am certain Li Zhengjing is the murderer! If you doubt me, use a Soul-Searching Talisman!"  

"Preposterous!" Xie Changqing snapped. "A Soul-Searching Talisman, if misused, could erase his consciousness! Li Zhengjing is already an inner disciple—a seed nurtured by the sect! How can you suggest destroying his future based on mere conjecture?"  

At the mention of the Soul-Searching Talisman, the elders in the Records Pavilion looked up in surprise.  

The Law Enforcement Hall had Truth-Seeking Talismans to detect lies, but those only worked on ordinary people. Once a cultivator reached the Internal Breath realm, they could regulate their pulse, breathing, and even thoughts with internal energy, rendering the talismans ineffective.  

The Soul-Searching Talisman, however, targeted the soul directly. Even experts at the True Qi realm couldn't conceal their secrets!  
But because it affected the soul, any mishap could lead to irreversible damage to the mind.  

Chen Yang met Xie Changqing's gaze and said slowly, "What if we request the Grand Elder to personally use the Soul-Searching Talisman?"  

"What did you say?" Xie Changqing's expression shifted.  

"Grand Elder Chen Zhu is at the peak of the True Qi realm. If he uses the talisman, there will be no risk of error!" Chen Yang declared.  

"The Grand Elder intervening?"  

Not only Xie Changqing but even the other elders in the Records Pavilion were stunned. This seemed like an excessive measure.  

Grand Elder Chen Zhu held an exalted position in the sect—he was just one step away from transcending mortality and ascending to immortality!  
To involve such a figure for an unimportant clansman's death and a mere Internal Breath realm youth?  
Would Grand Elder Chen Zhu truly stoop so low for such a trivial matter?  

Xie Changqing had a sinking feeling—this wasn't about Chen Youyu's death. It was about Li Zhengjing.  

Rumors suggested Grand Elder Chen Zhu had unresolved grievances with the late Elder Yuan Zhengfeng. But was the grudge so deep that he would target a disciple who merely carried Yuan Zhengfeng's token?  

"Does this mean it's not Chen Yang who wants Li Zhengjing dead, but Grand Elder Chen Zhu himself?"  
"If the Grand Elder truly intends to kill him, even Senior Brother Gao won't be able to protect the boy."  

Xie Changqing's thoughts raced, but his expression remained unreadable.  

Chen Yang took a deep breath. Under normal circumstances, he would never dare suggest involving the Grand Elder.  

But Li Zhengjing was no ordinary case. In just over twenty days since reaching the Internal Breath realm, he had killed Chen Youyu, Chen Bing, and Zhou Mo—and even subdued an upper-tier Internal Breath evil cultivator!  

Such talent was unprecedented!  
And precisely because of his extraordinary potential, Chen Yang was certain the Grand Elder would personally intervene to eliminate this future threat.  

"Interrogating a junior disciple requires the Grand Elder's involvement?"  

A voice suddenly rang out, stern and authoritative. "Having the Grand Elder interrogate a youth would not only tarnish his dignity but also make our Law Enforcement Hall appear incompetent! I shall personally use the Soul-Searching Talisman!"  

"Chen Xuan?" Xie Changqing's heart sank. The speaker was another elder from the Chen Clan.  

"Greetings, Elder Chen Xuan." Chen Yang bowed, his face lighting up with relief.  

"This matter is settled." Chen Xuan glanced at Xie Changqing. "Unless you'd prefer to trouble the Grand Elder?"  

Xie Changqing's expression darkened, but before he could speak, another elder tugged his sleeve and whispered, "Brother Xie, don't be rash. If they're willing to involve the Grand Elder, the decision is already made. Just accept it."  

"Indeed," another elder chimed in. "Is it worth disturbing the Grand Elder over a mere boy? Neither he nor our Law Enforcement Hall would emerge with dignity intact."  

"Brother Xie, I don't believe you should handle this case." A third elder stood. "Since it involves the Chen Clan, let Elder Chen Xuan and Disciple Chen Yang take charge."  

"Well said. Since they are both on duty in the Law Enforcement Hall, their investigation still falls under our jurisdiction."  

"No need to trouble the Grand Elder. Let Elder Chen Xuan use the Soul-Searching Talisman."  

"..."  

Xie Changqing exhaled heavily, his resolve crumbling.  

He took a step back and fell silent.  

He had done all he could.  
Yielding now would at least spare the Grand Elder's dignity. If he persisted and forced the Grand Elder to intervene, the fallout would be severe—and he would earn the Chen Clan's lasting enmity.  

Even his senior brother, Gao Changhe, would likely have no choice but to concede.  

"Then it's decided!" Chen Xuan gestured. "Fetch the Soul-Searching Talisman! Let us see if this Internal Breath realm boy truly has the power to kill upper-tier Internal Breath experts!"  

A disciple hurried forward with the talisman.  

But just as Chen Xuan reached for it, a voice—deep, icy, and brimming with authority—echoed through the hall.  

"Absurd!"  

"..."  

Every face in the Records Pavilion paled.  

Elders Chen Xuan, Xie Changqing, and the others immediately bowed.  

"Greetings, Chief Enforcer!"  

"Release him."  

The voice faded as its owner departed.  

Silence engulfed the hall, so profound that a pin drop would have thundered.  

"Just... let him go?" Chen Yang muttered after a long pause, his voice thick with resentment.  

"Enough! Without concrete evidence, you would convict based on speculation?" An elder stood, righteous indignation blazing in his eyes. "The Law Enforcement Hall upholds justice—we demand irrefutable proof!"  

"Exactly!" Another elder declared. "Elder Chen Xuan, you've only been here three days, and Chen Yang is but an inner disciple! Even if Grand Elder Chen Zhu himself came, our Law Enforcement Hall would never bend the rules for personal gain!"  

"..."  

Xie Changqing suddenly laughed. He stepped forward, eyeing Chen Yang.  

"The Chief Enforcer has spoken. If he says to release Li Zhengjing, then Li Zhengjing is innocent."  

Leaning closer, he added in a whisper, "And even if he were guilty—if a boy who reached the Internal Breath realm just twenty days ago can kill Chen Youyu, Chen Bing, and Zhou Mo... such a prodigy is far too valuable for the sect to waste on avenging three worthless lives."  

With that, he turned and strode away, laughing.  

*All these years, I believed the Law Enforcement Hall was truly impartial. Today, I see that our so-called justice doesn't apply to the higher-ups...*  

"Elder Chen Xuan..." Chen Yang turned to the elder, his voice low. "What do we do now?"  

"What can we do?" Chen Xuan replied coldly. "If the Chief Enforcer declares him innocent, then he is innocent."  

"But I know he's the killer!" Chen Yang gritted his teeth.  

Chen Xuan met his gaze. "Even if he is, he cannot be."  

The Records Pavilion fell silent once more.  

Why would the Chief Enforcer protect a mere Internal Breath realm youth?  

Was it because of Yuan Zhengfeng?  
Or was it to suppress Grand Elder Chen Zhu?  

As these questions swirled in their minds, the Chief Enforcer unrolled the case file on Chen Youyu's death.  

The cause of death was meticulously recorded.  

A severed right hand.  
A sword wound to the chest, incapacitating him.  
Twelve slashes to the back, ensuring his demise.  
His corpse had been burned beyond recognition.  

"One sword strike. Twelve slashes."  

The Chief Enforcer's voice was barely audible, but his eyes gleamed with something akin to admiration.  

"To reach the Internal Breath realm in just ten days after half a year of entry... and to slay Chen Youyu, an upper-tier Internal Breath expert..."
