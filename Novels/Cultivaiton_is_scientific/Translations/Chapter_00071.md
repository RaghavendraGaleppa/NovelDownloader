# Chapter 71: Rescue

Li Shiming felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him, his spiritual power now reduced to less than a third of its usual capacity. He retrieved the Green Kite Wooden Sword and swiftly grabbed the corpse of the Profound Nether Sect's Qi Refinement cultivator, storing it within his Machine Room space. There was no time to examine the items on the deceased cultivator—those could wait.

From beneath the water, he looked up toward the lake's surface. The flying boat had already landed on the water, and massive ripples spread outward from the impact. It seemed the other Profound Nether Sect Qi Refinement cultivator was attacking the vessel.

Li Shiming had no intention of intervening. Killing one late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator had been sheer luck—he didn’t delude himself into thinking he could actually contend with such opponents. Had the cultivator not been toying with him, or had they not wanted to preserve his corpse intact, he would have been dead many times over by now.

This experience taught him a harsh lesson: whether facing an elephant or a rabbit, one must always exert their full strength. Underestimating any opponent could lead to the same fatal mistake the Profound Nether Sect cultivator had made.

His oxygen tank could sustain him for at least thirty more minutes. He planned to stay hidden as long as possible—he had already done his part, exceeding expectations. As for the fate of the youths on the flying boat, that was beyond his control.

Inside the first floor of the flying boat, the thirty young recruits were in a state of panic. None had ever experienced such terror before. They didn’t even know what was happening outside—only that the boat had suddenly descended, followed by relentless impacts that shook the vessel violently.

"Where is the Immortal Master?" one boy cried out in fear.

No one answered. Instead, the screams of others only grew more frantic.

"Stay calm! We must stand together!" Jin Shufeng declared with forced authority, though his trembling legs betrayed his fear. His small group of followers instinctively gathered around him, seeking safety in numbers.

His sister, Jin Fengzhi, stayed apart. She knew her brother’s true nature—his bravado was meaningless now. If death came, she refused to rely on him.

Jin Shufeng, however, felt a sliver of security. In his mind, if death came for them, it would take the others first, buying him precious moments. Raised in the imperial palace, he understood how to manipulate people.

A sharp *crack* echoed through the boat—the outermost defensive formation had shattered.

The Profound Nether Sect cultivator flashed into the first-floor cabin with a sinister grin. With a wave of his hand, a dark energy shattered the wooden door, revealing the terrified youths inside. The sight of these future cultivators trembling before him thrilled him. Killing these seedlings of spiritual roots was exhilarating—who knew how many future Foundation Establishment experts he was cutting down today?

His gaze locked onto Jin Shufeng, surrounded by his followers. Clearly, this boy held some importance. 

"You first," the cultivator sneered, flicking a streak of black light straight into Jin Shufeng's forehead.

Jin Shufeng collapsed, eyes wide with confusion. Even in death, he couldn’t fathom why, among so many, he had been the first to die.

His death sent the remaining youths into hysterics, scattering in all directions. But there was nowhere to run. The cultivator’s fingers danced, and one by one, the children fell.

---

"You dare?!" A furious roar cut through the chaos as a figure streaked toward the scene. Faster than the voice came a sword glare. The Profound Nether Sect cultivator barely had time to react before the blade severed his head from his shoulders.

His headless body crumpled to the ground, the skull rolling several meters away.

Some survivors broke down sobbing; others stood frozen in shock. The newcomer—Uncle Cui—made no move to comfort them, allowing them to vent their terror.

After Li Shiming had uncovered the trap, Elder Zhao had prudently sent word back to the sect, originally intending to gather reinforcements against the invading Profound Nether Foundation Establishment cultivator. Instead, it had turned into a rescue mission for the new disciples.

Uncle Cui’s eyes swept over the youths, his heart sinking when he didn’t spot Li Shiming. Though their interactions had been few, he held the young man in high regard—Li Shiming had aided him in resolving the Profound Nether Sect incident in Zhongdu, a debt he hadn’t forgotten.

"Does anyone know where Li Shiming is?" he asked.

His voice brought a measure of calm to the group, though most were still too shaken to respond coherently.

"Respected Immortal Master," Jin Fengzhi spoke up hesitantly, one of the few who had glimpsed the events outside through the boat’s windows. "Senior Brother Li lured one of the attackers into the water."
