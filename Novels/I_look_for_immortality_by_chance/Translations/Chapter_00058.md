# Chapter 58: Seventh Layer of Qi Refinement, Minor Titan Seal

Time passed swiftly, and in the blink of an eye, a year had gone by.

Within the Qian Yuan Cave, a ten-foot-tall azure tree stood tall and robust. Though not particularly lofty, its trunk was thick as a millstone, with coiling bark patterns resembling dragon scales that exuded a fierce and domineering aura.

Inside the cave, wisps of spiritual energy rose like mist, casting an otherworldly glow upon the tree. Beneath its boughs sat a young man in a green Daoist robe, barefoot and with loose hair, meditating cross-legged.

With each breath he took, streams of mist-like energy flowed into his body. Strange root-like patterns shimmered across his skin, allowing him to continuously absorb spiritual energy. Most strikingly, with every breath he took, the colossal tree behind him seemed to breathe as well. The dragon-scale-like bark pulsed with bluish-gray veins, ceaselessly nourishing the twelve enormous cyan-green leaves that crowned its branches.

Each leaf was as large as a canopy, casting deep shadows. Though only twelve in number, they gave the tree an overwhelming presence, as if it could blot out the sky. Nestled among these giant leaves were two radiant azure fruits.

"Shhh—"

At that moment, the young man's lips parted slightly as he inhaled silently. Though the surrounding spiritual energy remained undisturbed, the massive tree behind him trembled violently. One of the canopy-sized leaves detached soundlessly, shrinking rapidly like melting snow and transforming into a stream of emerald liquid that flowed into the young man's mouth.

"Whoosh—"

A rushing sound, like a mighty river, erupted within his body. His face flushed, and his jet-black hair billowed, revealing his sharply defined jawline. After an indeterminate time, the commotion gradually subsided, and his aura surged dramatically, as if he had gained months of cultivation in an instant.

Yet his cultivation did not stop there.

"Shhh—"

He inhaled again, and another giant leaf fell, dissolving into a streak of green light that vanished into his mouth. This cycle repeated twelve times, until the surging river-like sounds within him reached a crescendo, crashing violently against an invisible barrier. But lacking the final push, the barrier refused to yield, and the turbulent sounds began to wane.

"Whoosh!"

At this critical moment, the young man inhaled deeply once more. The remaining azure fruit on the tree plummeted, transforming into a streak of light that he swallowed whole.

"Boom!"

A deafening roar erupted within him, far more intense than before, surging with unstoppable force. Finally, with a resounding crack, the barrier shattered. Spiritual energy from the surroundings rushed into his body, converting into spiritual power that coursed through his meridians.

"Haah..."

"Finally, the seventh layer of Qi Refinement!"

After a long while, the young man exhaled deeply and slowly opened his eyes, a flash of lightning-like intensity flickering within them. A year of arduous cultivation, supplemented by the Minor Titan Tree's accumulated energy equivalent to a year and a half of cultivation, had allowed Gu Yuan to achieve what would have taken two and a half years in the Qian Yuan Cave.

"Cultivation truly isn't easy. Without the Minor Titan Tree and the abundant spiritual energy of Qian Yuan Cave, an ordinary cultivator would need at least four years to reach the peak of the sixth layer, let alone break through to the seventh."

Feeling the surging spiritual power within him, Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh in admiration. Choosing to settle on Jin Yuan Island had been a wise decision. The upper-tier second-grade spiritual vein here was incredibly dense—each breath he took here was equivalent to two breaths elsewhere, amplifying his cultivation speed nearly as much as half a Minor Titan Tree.

"The Minor Titan Tree's leaves are useful, but the fruit is the true key!"

The lingering sweetness on his lips reminded him once more of the profound mysteries of the "Body-Seeding Seal." The Minor Titan Tree produced one leaf per month, each equivalent to a month's worth of cultivation—a fundamental enhancement. But the true treasure was the "Law Fruit" that formed after all twelve leaves had grown. This single fruit alone equaled half a year of cultivation, akin to a Breakthrough Pill, capable of propelling a cultivator past a bottleneck in one go.

It was this fruit that had allowed Gu Yuan to break through so smoothly.

"Now that my cultivation has advanced, it's time to harvest the final fruit."

Barefoot, Gu Yuan stood and gazed at the now-bare Minor Titan Tree with eager anticipation. Stripped of all its leaves, the tree seemed weakened, its radiance dimmed. Only the remaining azure fruit still glowed with spiritual light.

The "Body-Seeding Seal" was a Qi Refinement-stage technique—its leaves and fruits would continue to grow in cycles until the cultivator reached the peak of the ninth layer. However, the "Seal Fruit" was unique—it would only form once and never again.

Among the three mystical trees, the Minor Titan Tree grew the fastest, producing its Seal Fruit in just a year. This was one of the reasons Gu Yuan had chosen it without hesitation, unwilling to wait for other spirit trees to manifest.

On the path of cultivation, speed was paramount. A bird in the hand was worth two in the bush.

"Rustle..."

As if sensing Gu Yuan's gaze, the Minor Titan Tree trembled slightly, as though reluctant to part with its fruit, like a mother unwilling to let go of her child. Yet the azure fruit swayed eagerly, as if yearning to leave the branch and embrace its destiny.

"Clink!"

With a thought from Gu Yuan, the fruit detached with a joyful chime and landed in his palm. Unlike the Law Fruit, which dissolved upon falling, the Seal Fruit remained solid, its metallic weight cold and unyielding.

"Clink, clink!"

Gu Yuan tapped it lightly, but the fruit showed no sign of softening.

"Time to shed some blood again..."

With a resigned sigh, he took out a jade ruler and pricked his fingertip, smearing the blade with his blood.

The Law Leaves and Law Fruits could not be stored—they had to be consumed immediately upon harvest. Only the Seal Fruit, hard as iron, could be preserved and refined at will. But to refine it, one needed the blood of the tree's bonded cultivator to anoint a jade blade, which could then crack open the fruit.

"Clang~"

The bloodstained jade ruler struck the Seal Fruit, producing an ethereal chime. Ripples of green light shimmered across its surface before the fruit split open, revealing its core.

The core was the size of a jujube, shaped like a seal. Its emerald stem bore the intricate carving of a miniature titan—muscular, imposing, and exuding authority. Its face bore an uncanny resemblance to Gu Yuan's. Beneath it, natural Dao patterns formed ancient script that seemed to spell out "Titan Spirit Sea."

"Clink!"

With another clear chime, the core levitated of its own accord and shot straight into Gu Yuan's dantian.

The Minor Titan Seal had been forged!
