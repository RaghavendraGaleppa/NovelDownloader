# Chapter 97: The Remnants of the Fallen Dynasty! Facing the Imperial Preceptor!

The capital of the Great Zhou Dynasty, Purple Star Tower.

A middle-aged man in a long robe and a tall crown stood with his hands behind his back, gazing toward the southeast.

"Have you uncovered any news from Lin Yuan Prefecture?"

"Yes," a young Taoist bowed and replied. "The Divine Mother's name has spread throughout the southern region, and people everywhere worship her. However, Lin Yuan Prefecture, due to the influence of the Wan Clan's ancestor from the Luofu Immortal Sect, never had any temples dedicated to the Divine Mother. Now that the Wan Clan's ancestor has fallen, the Wan Clan fears being devoured by other factions and is terrified of the Xuanyuan Sword Sect. Thus, they have sought the Divine Mother's protection."

"The affairs of the Luofu Immortal Sect have not yet spread widely. The Wan Clan of Lin Yuan is merely the mortal family of that Wan ancestor. How could they have learned of this so quickly?" the Imperial Preceptor said calmly.

"Most likely through Gu Changzhou of the Luofu Immortal Sect. He was a true disciple promoted by the Wan ancestor," the young man explained. "Gu Changzhou has now lost power, and the immortal elders who supported him have all perished. He was hunted down and fled to Lin Yuan Prefecture. Only after being expelled from the sect did the pursuit against him cease."

"Gu Changzhou is merely at the True Qi Realm. Even with the Pillar of the Hall, he wouldn't be enough to suppress the Divine Mother of the Southern Region," the Imperial Preceptor said, lowering his gaze. "Who else was there?"

"That day, Buddhist treasures were scattered about, likely from the Vajra Temple's Buddhist disciple," the young Taoist continued.

"These two are among the finest of the younger generation and possess supreme treasures, but together, they could only protect themselves," the Imperial Preceptor said. "Who else?"

"Li Zhengjing, the traitor of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect," the young Taoist said. "It's said the sacrificial offering from the Wan Clan of Lin Yuan was his spirit bird. That day, he forcibly entered the Wan Clan's ancestral lands, and no one dared stop him, including the local officials..."

"This man managed to fight his way out of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's spirit mine. His skills are indeed extraordinary. It's said he has cultivated for less than a year and is already a top-tier expert at the True Qi Realm!" the Imperial Preceptor sighed. "The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect truly lost a prodigious talent... But given his short cultivation time, even with him, it shouldn't have been enough."

"According to the investigation that day, there seemed to be another Immortal," the young Taoist said, his expression complex.

"Oh?" The Imperial Preceptor showed surprise, then asked, "Then who holds the Pillar of the Hall?"

"The Wan Clan's patriarch reported to the local officials that the golden dragon was summoned by that Immortal!" the young Taoist said. "This person called himself the Impermanent Venerable."

"The Impermanent Venerable?" The Imperial Preceptor pondered for a moment. "I have never heard of such a figure."

"I searched through the records but found no mention of the Impermanent Venerable," the young Taoist paused, then added, "However, while reviewing the records, I noticed that the archives had been tampered with, leaving behind a message."

"What message?" the Imperial Preceptor asked thoughtfully.

"Information about the Pillar of the Hall," the young Taoist said. "Originally, the clues pointed to the Luofu Immortal Sect. But this time, the golden dragon summoned by the Impermanent Venerable in Lin Yuan Prefecture was also the Pillar of the Hall."

"Investigate this Impermanent Venerable thoroughly," the Imperial Preceptor ordered. "The twenty-four Pillars of the Hall in the capital have not been stolen. Therefore, the Pillar of the Hall that appeared must be related to the creditor from eight hundred years ago! Additionally..."

He paused, then slowly said, "Seal the twenty-four Pillars of the Hall and announce publicly that they have been stolen."

"I understand, Master!"

"Furthermore, regarding Li Zhengjing," the Imperial Preceptor continued, "this young man has cultivated for such a short time yet possesses such extraordinary abilities. Send people to track him down—he must be captured alive!"

The young disciple suddenly understood. "Does the Imperial Preceptor wish to recruit him?"

The Imperial Preceptor chuckled. "With such talent, if he doesn't die young and is properly nurtured, he will surely become an Immortal! Many factions must be eager to recruit him!"

"Even the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect likely didn't realize just how exceptional he was until he defeated Lu Huaiyuan. By then, it was too late!"

"Had they known earlier, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect would have suppressed the news, captured him, erased his crimes, and nurtured him carefully. He could have become a pillar of their sect."

"Unfortunately, now that his theft of spirit stones is widely known, it's too late."

At this point, the Imperial Preceptor asked, "Have you uncovered Li Zhengjing's background?"

The young Taoist shook his head slightly. "The Ancient Moon Peak's Enforcement Hall has erased all traces. There's no way to trace his origins."

The Imperial Preceptor clasped his hands behind his back. "Investigate from another angle. Don't start with Li Zhengjing of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. Instead, find out who could have become Li Zhengjing."

The young Taoist frowned. "Investigating this way is too broad. With so many people in the world, where should we begin?"

The Imperial Preceptor pointed to a certain place in the capital. "Take the Mirror of Profound Truth from the Hall and visit the Ministry of Revenue."

---

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing had already left Lin Yuan Prefecture.

Gu Changzhou had arranged for a carriage from the Wan Clan's ancestral lands, one without any markings to identify it.

"Finally, I don't have to walk anymore," Li Zhengjing sighed in relief.

He placed the phoenix wood box inside the carriage, and the dragon girl sat inside as well. He himself took the reins as the driver.

The Five Elements Creation Tree, carrying the Wave-Severing Gu, also emerged from the phoenix wood box, with a broken jade pendant hanging from its branches.

The Hanging Bird hid behind the tree, not daring to approach the dragon girl.

As Li Zhengjing drove the carriage, he held the Pillar of the Hall in his hand, staring at it intently.

"In the underworld, I could discern the origins of the ghost soldiers and learn they were forged by the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord."

"But this thing doesn't reveal anything. Could it be that the ghost soldiers aren't entirely lifeless, while the Pillar of the Hall is just a treasure, a lifeless object?"

"If one day this Pillar of the Hall is refined further, reaching a higher tier and becoming a true divine artifact with a spirit within, would it then reveal its secrets?"

As he pondered, a sharp aura suddenly enveloped the surroundings.

His eyes narrowed as he drew the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Saber and checked his fortune. His future death remained unchanged—no danger today!

But at that moment, over a dozen sword beams shot toward him from all directions!

"Watch out!" Li Zhengjing shouted, slashing forward with his saber. Thunder roared!

Boom!!!

The sword beams struck from all sides.

The horse was torn apart!

The carriage shattered into pieces!

Inside, the dragon girl pursed her lips. The sword beams dissipated before reaching her.

The Five Elements Creation Tree, with combat power comparable to a True Qi Realm expert, shielded the phoenix wood box, wrapping the Wave-Severing Gu in its leaves.

The Hanging Bird burst into flames, resisting the sword beams.

Li Zhengjing's expression darkened as he looked back and gritted his teeth. "I finally got a carriage to ride, and before we even traveled a hundred li, you've destroyed it."

"Li Zhengjing!"

Voices filled with excitement came from all directions.

Figures emerged one after another, all at the True Qi Realm.

Their cultivation levels varied, their attire differed, and their auras were distinct.

These people were clearly not from the same faction—their origins were diverse!

Li Zhengjing's first thought was of the Golden Ship of Salvation.

Only the Golden Ship's members would be scattered across various factions, roaming the world.

At that moment, an elderly man stepped forward. He had unlocked over three hundred acupoints in the True Qi Realm.

"We are not here today for your life," the old man bowed slightly. "I know your skills are extraordinary—you escaped the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. Thus, I dared not come alone to intercept you. I gathered these fellow Daoists to share the three thousand graded spirit stones... Hand them over, and we will leave."

"Three thousand graded spirit stones?" Li Zhengjing was stunned. He turned to the side. "Tree, can we afford this ransom?"

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches. "No."

In the spirit mine, they had obtained a few hundred graded spirit stones, which had already brought great joy, but most had been consumed.

Although they later acquired over two thousand spirit stones from the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven, it still wasn't enough to make three thousand.

"You heard him," Li Zhengjing said helplessly. "We don't have them."

"It seems you value wealth over life!" a middle-aged man in the crowd shouted. "Kill him and take the stones. Why waste words?"

Another added, "That tree has gained sentience and can speak. It must be extraordinary—I want it!"

An elderly man declared, "Kill Li Zhengjing first, then divide the rest!"

"Everyone, calm down!" the leading old man raised his hand and looked at Li Zhengjing. "Your skills are extraordinary. Even if we capture you, many of us will die. So... if you hand over the three thousand spirit stones you stole from the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, we will leave. This ends here."

"Wait..." Li Zhengjing paused. "What theft of three thousand spirit stones?"

He glanced at the Hanging Bird, the Five Elements Creation Tree, and the broken jade where Yuan Zhengfeng resided. "Did you hide some behind my back?"

"Heaven knows we never left the phoenix wood box when we were with you, Master!" the Hanging Bird cried out in grievance, equally shocked.

Only Yuan Zhengfeng remained silent before sighing.

"Don't ask. You took two hundred spirit stones, but afterward, the spirit mines must have reported losses totaling three thousand."

Yuan Zhengfeng, having been part of the Enforcement Hall, understood the tricks. "They swallowed the rest and pinned it all on you... Since you're already a wanted traitor, no one will investigate them."

"Damn them..." Li Zhengjing trembled with anger in the scorching heat. "I nearly died for two hundred spirit stones, and they took two thousand eight hundred, rounding it up? If I ever find out who did this, I'll make them spit it all out!"

"Enough nonsense! Hand over the stones!" The True Qi Realm cultivators surrounding them grew impatient, their eyes blazing with greed.

For immortal sect disciples, spirit stones were rare but still obtainable within their sects.

But for these ordinary sect members and rogue cultivators, they had no means to acquire spirit stones.

Most spirit stone sources were controlled by the Great Zhou Dynasty, the three major immortal sects, Buddhist sects, and other top factions.

The remaining few sources were monopolized by factions with Immortal Realm experts.

For ordinary sect disciples and rogue cultivators, cultivation relied solely on themselves—without spirit stones.

Thus, no matter how talented they were or how profound their cultivation methods, their progress paled in comparison to immortal sect true disciples.

"I have less than twenty years left," the old man at the front stepped forward. "Had I been born into an immortal sect, with superior techniques, ample spirit stones, and proper guidance, I might have transcended mortality and become an Immortal by now. But my origins were humble—I only obtained a cultivation method by chance and had to teach myself. In the decades since reaching the True Qi Realm, I've only obtained thirteen spirit stones..."

He drew his sword, his gaze sharp. "With enough spirit stones, I could unlock all my acupoints within three years, reach True Qi perfection, and attempt to ascend to the Immortal Realm before my lifespan ends. The spirit stones on you are my hope for immortality..."

"Wealth comes from risk, let alone immortality?" Li Zhengjing looked at the crowd and said calmly, "Come, then."

He felt no anger, no contempt—but no mercy either.

The dozen or so True Qi Realm experts who came to kill him had diverse backgrounds and little prior connection. They had united solely to kill Li Zhengjing and seize his spirit stones.

But their limited perspective led them to underestimate Li Zhengjing's strength.

Even Lu Huaiyuan could have defeated all of them alone!

"Kill!" The Hanging Bird spat flames and lunged, its sharp claws tearing through flesh.

The Five Elements Creation Tree, finding the scene too bloody, covered the Wave-Severing Gu's eyes and antennae, refusing to join the fight.

Li Zhengjing didn't even use the Blazing Sun Divine Sword in his left arm. With just the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Saber, he unleashed thunderbolts!

Sword beams shot from all directions but were shattered by the Great Derivation Void Transformation Sword Qi!

All sorts of spells were dispersed by his thunderous strikes!

Only the old man who had unlocked over three hundred acupoints remained, struggling to hold on.

"What sets immortal sects above you isn't just spirit stones and resources—it's their techniques, spells, and methods!" Li Zhengjing stepped forward. "You've unlocked three hundred acupoints, but your combat power is only equivalent to an inner elder or true disciple who's barely unlocked a hundred."

"So this is the might of an immortal sect..." The old man, exhausted, sighed. "You fought your way out of the spirit mine and defeated Lu Huaiyuan, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's top disciple. Your strength is truly astounding... But rumors say you've only cultivated for a year. I thought your escape might have been luck. I never imagined you'd be this strong."

Li Zhengjing stood before him. "You don't seem afraid."

The old man shook his head. "I came to rob you, prepared to die by your hand. I estimated our combined strength gave us a sixty percent chance to kill you and take the stones. I didn't expect to be so outmatched. But with only a dozen years left, I gambled those years for a shot at immortality. It was worth it."

He closed his eyes, drew his sword across his neck, and ended his life.

"..." Li Zhengjing's expression was complex. "Bury them."

The Hanging Bird complied, collecting the bodies and their meager belongings. These cultivators, who had staked their lives for spirit stones, carried little of value—likely leaving their treasures to their descendants.

Aside from two swords and a golden net, nothing caught Li Zhengjing's eye.

The Hanging Bird, however, was delighted to find several gourds of strong liquor.

"Huh?" The bird suddenly exclaimed. "These paupers weren't completely broke! Master, look at this..."

Li Zhengjing turned and saw a Golden Ship of Salvation boarding token!

One of them truly was from the Golden Ship.

Now, unlike before, Li Zhengjing wrapped the token in True Qi, affixed a Radiant Talisman, and tossed it into the phoenix wood box, no longer fearing its corrupting influence.

"These people are all at the True Qi Realm. In the mortal world, they're considered strong. United, they could form a minor sect," Yuan Zhengfeng mused. "Yet before you, they were powerless. You've cultivated for less than a year—your progress is astonishing."

"Only a hundred and sixty-three acupoints so far," Li Zhengjing said. "Even with the Yin-Yang Five Elements Creation Tree and enough spirit stones, it'll take another month to unlock all three hundred and sixty-five and achieve perfection."

"..." The Hanging Bird couldn't even drink its liquor. It glanced at Li Zhengjing, then at the ashes of the cremated corpses. "Master, your kindness is commendable, but consider the feelings of the dead. They spent their lives striving, nearly dying of old age without unlocking all their acupoints, only to come here and perish..."

"If the world thinks I have three thousand spirit stones, this won't be the last time," Li Zhengjing sighed. "Just one appearance in Lin Yuan Prefecture, and a dozen True Qi Realm experts rushed to ambush me. I'll need to hide my identity, or this journey will be anything but peaceful. Even reaching the capital won't guarantee safety."

With that, he cleaned up the aftermath, gazing at the shattered carriage and the dead horse with regret.

It seemed walking was his only option.

Li Zhengjing resignedly shouldered the phoenix wood box.

The dragon girl, unwilling to walk, leaped onto his head and sat there like a rider, shouting cheerfully, "Giddy up!"

"I really have adopted a daughter," Li Zhengjing muttered, trudging onward.

But after only sixty li, he spotted a pavilion by the roadside.

Inside sat a middle-aged man with two teacups before him.

He looked at Li Zhengjing as if he'd been waiting, a smile on his face.

"An Immortal!" Yuan Zhengfeng's voice turned grave. "The pressure he emits surpasses even the Divine Mother of the Southern Region. His cultivation is likely on par with the late Formation Pavilion Master."

"Young friend, please!" The middle-aged man stood and beckoned. "I am the current Imperial Preceptor of the Great Xuan Dynasty, Lin Fuxuan!"

"..." Li Zhengjing took a deep breath.

The Great Xuan Dynasty was a once-mighty empire that ruled the Central Plains. At its peak, it surpassed even the current Great Zhou Dynasty. But 2,600 years ago, it collapsed after being harvested by the creditor.

Since then, the Central Plains had been engulfed in war, with various factions rising. Yet remnants of the Great Xuan Dynasty persisted through generations, clinging to the dream of restoring their empire.

Over 2,600 years, the Great Xuan's remnants remained formidable.

The founding emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty was once one of them, nurtured by their teachings before declaring himself emperor, unifying the Central Plains, and slaughtering these "remnants of the fallen dynasty."

Now, it seemed the rumors were wrong—the Great Zhou hadn't eradicated them completely.

"Imperial Preceptor, are you also here for my spirit stones?" Li Zhengjing asked solemnly.

"Three thousand spirit stones are indeed a vast fortune, crucial even to the current Great Xuan Dynasty. But today, I'm not here for them."

Lin Fuxuan extended a hand. "Cultivating for just a year, you've reached such heights. Your talent is unparalleled. Under my guidance, you will soon become an Immortal. Join the Great Xuan Dynasty. When the Great Zhou falls and the Great Xuan is restored, you will be the next Imperial Preceptor!"

Li Zhengjing relaxed. "I see."

Lin Fuxuan produced a covenant. "Given the lesson of the Great Zhou's founding emperor, to prevent future betrayal, swear an oath here. Afterward... I will devote all my resources to nurturing you."

Li Zhengjing smirked. "How about you swear to serve me? When I establish the Proper Dynasty, I'll appoint you as the founding Grand Preceptor. Sound good?"

Lin Fuxuan's expression darkened as he retracted the covenant. "I do not appreciate this jest."

"Neither do I. So... let's not joke anymore," Li Zhengjing spread his hands. "I'm wanted by the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, but I'm not desperate enough to join you—a remnant faction constantly hunted by the Great Zhou."

"To speak so boldly before me, without a shred of respect..." Lin Fuxuan paused. "You seem to lack reverence for Immortals."

Li Zhengjing didn't reply. He set the dragon girl down and drew the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Slaying Saber. "If it's an Immortal I can't kill, I'd be more respectful."

Lin Fuxuan said coolly, "A True Qi Realm cultivator, hoping to kill an Immortal? Even the invincible young master of the Kunlun Immortal Sect has never achieved such a feat."

Li Zhengjing stepped forward, smiling. "He is he. I am I."

Lin Fuxuan sipped his tea. "No need for bluffs. I'm not here to kill you. Just answer one question—where is the creditor now?"

"The creditor?" Li Zhengjing's eyes narrowed in realization.

The creditor known to the world was the former Ancient Moon Peak's Chief!

"Tell me the creditor's whereabouts, hand over the spirit stones, and join the Great Xuan. I'll spare your life," Lin Fuxuan said slowly. "Otherwise, you die here today."

He set down his teacup and exhaled.

The tea he had just sipped transformed into a water dragon, surging forth and demolishing the pavilion with terrifying force!
