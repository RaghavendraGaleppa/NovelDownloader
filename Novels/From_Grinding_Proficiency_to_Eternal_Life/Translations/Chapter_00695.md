# Chapter 695: Lying Low

Dongming Zhenjun said, "Therefore, if you wish for it to be truly satisfied, you must attain the Nascent Soul, become a Dao Lord, and become a true pillar supporting heaven and earth. Only then, even if you devour more Dao Fruits, as long as you do not harm the foundation of this world, it might even be pleased to see it happen, viewing you as a cleaner.

Or, you could find a continuous stream of substitutes that do not involve the Golden Core Dao Fruits of this world to satisfy the Heavenly Dao's thirst for the growth of the world's origin."

She gave Xu Yunfan a meaningful glance, clearly thinking of the operations in the Aitira World, but this was not the norm.

Xu Yunfan fell silent for a moment, digesting these secrets that touched upon the core rules of this world.

He asked, "The key to the Great and Small Cyclic Circulations is attribute compatibility. Yin and Yang complement each other, and the Five Elements generate and restrain one another. How is this judged? What are the consequences if one forcibly devours an attribute that conflicts with their own?"

"Consequences? In mild cases, one's foundation is damaged, their Golden Core is tarnished, and their realm will be permanently stagnant.

In severe cases, the Dao Fruits will conflict, the Golden Core will shatter and the person will die, the Inner Cave will collapse and turn into a Golden Core Secret Realm. One will perish, their spirit unable to reincarnate or cultivate again."

Dongming Zhenjun's tone was calm, but every word was startling.

"The way of compatibility is mystical and profound.

One must consider their own comprehension, the characteristics of their cultivation method, and the origin of the Dao Fruit's aura.

For example, your Dao Fruit, the Divine Celestial Jade Clear Nine Firmament Profound Vault Myriad Transformation Immortal Dao Fruit, is supremely yang and supremely strong, containing the thunderous intent of destruction and creation.

The Light-Scorching Flame Blazing Sun Dao Fruit is pure yang fire, domineering and intense. It complements your thunder, allowing for the method of a dual mastery of thunder and fire.

If you were to attempt to devour an extremely yin Ice Dao Fruit right now, under the clash of yin and yang, without a special method of harmony or a peerless foundation, it would be a nine死一生 (ninety percent chance of death).

As for the circulation of the Five Elements, it requires an even more delicate balance."

She paused, looking at Xu Yunfan's thoughtful expression, and suddenly let out a soft laugh. The smile was enchanting but carried a hint of cold amusement.

"Xu Shidi, how much are these insights worth? Have I been too kind today?"

Xu Yunfan's heart chilled, but his expression remained unchanged. He cupped his fists and said, "I will remember the guidance you have given me, Senior Sister Dongming. But I am indeed surprised. Why are you willing to share these key points with me?"

"Why?"

Dongming Zhenjun covered her mouth and chuckled, the dark and sinister energy around her fluctuating.

"Dao Fruits are not so easily obtained. Xu Shidi, you went from a mortal to the Divine Celestial Zhenjun in just a few hundred years in a single lifetime. This speed is unprecedented and dazzling to the point of being blinding."

Her voice suddenly shifted, carrying undisguised greed and anticipation.

"When a tree grows taller than the forest, the wind will surely destroy it.

You have advanced too quickly. No matter how solid your foundation or how many methods you possess, how many layers of spears and arrows can you block?

I truly look forward to your development. Let's see when this seemingly indestructible giant ship of yours will finally crash into that real iceberg, or be completely torn apart by even greater storms?"

Her words were naked and cruel. She was waiting to see Xu Yunfan's decline after his peak, waiting for him to reveal his flaws and encounter insurmountable enemies or bottlenecks. At that time, she could lie in wait, add insult to injury, and seize all the opportunities and Dao Fruits on his person.

The friendship between Zhenjuns is as thin as paper; interests are eternal.

Xu Yunfan's rapid rise was in itself a huge threat and a tempting treasure.

To be able to advance so fast, he must have some good treasures on him.

A cold light flashed through the depths of Xu Yunfan's eyes, but it immediately turned into a calm abyss. He was not angered; instead, he nodded. "Senior Sister speaks frankly, which is quite honest. On the path of cultivation, the strong prey on the weak is a natural principle.

I have learned from your words today. If I truly reach a dead end in the future, Senior Sister can feel free to make a move. We shall each rely on our own abilities."

This calmness in the face of a naked threat instead made a trace of genuine surprise flash through Dongming Zhenjun's eyes.

"What great courage! Then I shall wait and see."

She paused and then said, "Would you like to dual cultivate with me?"

Xu Yunfan coughed dryly. "Not for now. Some time ago, during a dual cultivation, a certain great deity from an unknown dimension saw us. Let's put it on hold for now."

Dongming Zhenjun gave him a deep look, her form turning into a stream of dark and sinister light that merged with the void and disappeared.

The mountaintop returned to silence, only the fierce gale howling.

Dongming Zhenjun's words echoed like an icy alarm bell in Xu Yunfan's soul. He clearly realized that his rocket-like speed of ascent had become a Sword of Damocles hanging over his head, attracting the gaze of too many with malicious intent.

The displeasure of the Heavenly Dao, the covetousness of his fellow cultivators, and the dangers of the path ahead.

"Time waits for no one..."

Xu Yunfan murmured, his figure flashing as he disappeared into the core geothermal fire-eye thunder pool deep within the Divine Celestial Mountain, which was shrouded in layers of restrictions.

But sometimes, stopping to consolidate one's own cultivation and progress is indispensable.

As soon as he entered the geothermal fire-eye thunder pool, a scorching and violent aura rushed at him. Beneath his feet was a rolling, boiling ocean of golden-red magma. The scorching heat waves distorted space, enough to instantly vaporize divine steel.

However, the power of this terrestrial furnace, capable of burning mountains and boiling seas, seemed like a bonfire compared to the scene within Xu Yunfan's Dantian.

His Dantian's Qi Sea had now transformed into a purgatory ruled by thunder and flame.

At its core, the red light cluster, which he had obtained from the Blazing Sun Zhenjun and symbolized the origin of the Light-Scorching Flame Blazing Sun Dao Fruit, was frantically jumping and colliding like a trapped magma sun.

Although it was bound by layers of purple-gold Divine Celestial thunder chains, every one of its tremors still caused the space around Xu Yunfan's body to distort violently, releasing pure yang heat waves that could burn all things, scorching black traces into the void.

It was precisely because of this that Xu Yunfan had a method to prevent the Dao Fruit from escaping if he was not careful.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged in the void three zhang above the rolling magma, his aura as solid as an abyss. Behind him, the phantom of the Divine Celestial Dharma Form with three heads and six arms, majestic and awe-inspiring, appeared silently, standing between heaven and earth, suppressing all directions.

The central true form had a solemn expression, its eyes tightly closed.

His vast, sea-like divine sense transformed into countless invisible threads, firmly locking onto the restless core of the Blazing Sun Dao Fruit's origin.

At the same time, the supreme technique of the "Divine Celestial Nine Firmament Profound Vault Immortal Dao Sutra" flowed through his heart, drawing upon the power of his own Divine Celestial Dao Fruit.

In an instant, the purple-gold thunder origin within his Dantian boiled, transforming into countless immensely heavy hammers, containing the true meaning of destruction and creation, and began the most violent forging of that red light cluster.

*Boom!*

*Boom!*

*Boom!*

Each strike of the thunder hammer within his inner landscape was accompanied by a deafening roar. The red light cluster trembled violently, erupting with even more dazzling light and even more violent pure yang fire to counterattack.

Golden-red flame waves and purple-gold destructive lightning clashed and annihilated each other violently within the Dantian's Qi Sea, then were reborn.

The violent energy currents were enough to tear apart the Dantian of an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.

But the Dao rhyme of the Profound Vault's Immortality spread out, forcibly constraining this destructive energy and confining it within the controllable furnace. It then guided the wisps of the scattered Blazing Sun origin, which had been stripped away.

Under the tempering of the thunder, it attempted to carry out a preliminary fusion and infiltration with the thunder power of the Divine Celestial Dao Fruit.
