# Chapter 163: The First Round

Tap—tap—

Footsteps echoed along an ancient, mottled road that seemed to stretch endlessly into the distance.

Zhang Jing walked forward step by step.

Surrounding him was an abyss of darkness—silent and oppressive.

Yet his expression remained unchanged, his gaze steady and calm.

...

After what felt like an eternity, a faint glimmer of light appeared in the distance.

"Finally here?" Zhang Jing murmured, his previously indifferent eyes flickering with a hint of anticipation.

Taking a deep breath, he strode unhurriedly toward the light.

Half a quarter-hour later, a thought surfaced in his mind:

"Entry to the Proud Cloud Secret Realm requires 100,000 units of fortune. Proceed?"

Zhang Jing turned to glance at the end of the road behind him, where a massive stone gate stood firmly shut, emanating an indomitable aura.

Then he shifted his gaze forward.

A pure white orb the size of a fist hovered in the air, radiating a warm glow. Though it was right before him, it felt infinitely distant.

"Purchase," Zhang Jing responded without hesitation.

As his voice fell, strands of radiant light began seeping from his body, swiftly merging into the white orb.

"So this is what manifested fortune looks like?" Zhang Jing mused, his eyes reflecting surprise.

His gaze followed the luminous threads back to the orb.

Boom—

A thunderous roar, like crashing waves, echoed faintly in his ears.

Before his eyes, the small orb rapidly expanded, transforming in an instant into a blazing white star, its surface engulfed by a boundless, tempestuous ocean.

[Fortune: 1,333,179,800,000]

A line of text abruptly appeared before him, its digits increasing at an astonishing rate—billions per moment.

"This must be the total fortune reward for this Proud Cloud Secret Realm," Zhang Jing speculated, unable to suppress a look of awe.

Having lived frugally before, he had never encountered such vast wealth.

When he snapped back to reality, the massive stone gate at the road's end had silently swung open.

---

At this very moment, millions of Foundation Establishment cultivators were undergoing the same experience as Zhang Jing, their consciousnesses struggling to break free from the overwhelming ocean of fortune emanating from the blazing star.

Heavy breaths filled the air as their eyes burned with fervor.

In the next instant, countless footsteps marched resolutely toward the now-open stone gate.

---

Beyond the secret realm, an even larger stone gate materialized.

Through it, glimpses of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm could be seen—floating islands suspended in the sky, and two distinct, non-intersecting layers of space.

The moment the gate appeared, figures who had been waiting impatiently surged forward.

Their cultivation levels varied—Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, even Dharma Idol—yet, for once, they moved in rare harmony.

---

"Heavens! It costs 300 units of fortune to spectate this time? Wasn't it 250 before?" a man exclaimed, halting abruptly, his face twisted with reluctance and pain.

As if those extra 50 units were his lifeblood.

"Hey, move it! Either pay up or get out of the way!" someone behind him snapped impatiently.

"Three hundred fortune to witness the techniques of top-tier geniuses—even the monstrous talents from the Seven Supreme Inheritances—is a steal!"

"Quit dawdling! At this rate, none of us will get in today!"

Under the barrage of complaints, the man gritted his teeth and paid the fortune, vanishing into the secret realm.

---

From a distant pavilion, You Yuanming stood beside his senior brother, gaping at the surging crowd.

"Senior Brother, are all these people here to spectate? There are so many!" he marveled, having never seen such a multitude of cultivators in his life.

His senior brother chuckled. "Junior Brother, the Seven Heavenly Realms are vast. Between sects, immortal clans, and rogue cultivators, the number of cultivators is beyond measure. This is but a drop in the ocean."

"Most here are from the vicinity of Proud Cloud Immortal City. A smaller fraction traveled from distant corners of the Dongzhen Huamiao Heavenly Realm. Those who spent fortunes to cross realms via void treasure ships are even rarer."

---

"Will we have to squeeze through that?" You Yuanming asked warily.

"No need. Our Taiyi Wuliang Dao Sect has a dedicated viewing area. We'll enter directly."

"Thank goodness," You Yuanming sighed in relief.

---

Meanwhile, after passing through the stone gate, Zhang Jing found himself on an expansive plain of bare, yellow-brown earth stretching endlessly.

Glancing around, he saw countless figures—men and women, young and old, tall and short—scattered across the wilderness.

As time passed, the crowd swelled, the once-spacious plain growing increasingly cramped. The air buzzed with excitement, thick with anticipation.

Sensing the shift, Zhang Jing opened his eyes.

Before him stood a sea of cultivators, their auras blazing like fire or deep as abysses—some mighty, others weak.

"How interesting," Zhang Jing mused, a spark of excitement igniting within him.

With so many participants, there were bound to be extraordinary talents.

Suddenly, the bright sky darkened.

Millions of eyes turned upward.

A colossal face, spanning half the heavens, materialized. Golden eyes scanned the ground with cold scrutiny.

Zhang Jing stiffened as an icy gaze swept over him, but he betrayed no reaction.

When the gaze moved on, he exhaled.

"Such terrifying pressure. This must be the spirit of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm," he deduced, recalling the realm's records.

"Welcome to the Proud Cloud Secret Realm," the giant face intoned emotionlessly.

Silence fell.

Zhang Jing listened intently, knowing the crucial details were coming.

"Total participants in this Foundation Establishment ranking battle: 3,800,543," the voice declared, now tinged with excitement.

"Thus, the total reward pool is 3.8 trillion units of fortune!"

For a heartbeat, the world stood still.

Then—chaos.

Cheers, gasps, and fervent cries erupted, the very air seeming to combust with passion.

Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed with determination.

3.8 trillion fortune.

How much would the top rank receive?

An astronomical sum.

"Now, the rules and rewards for the first round," the voice boomed.

The crowd hushed instantly.

"In this round, 3.8 million participants will compete, with up to 129,800 advancing."

"Victors receive 20 million fortune and proceed to the next round. The rest are eliminated."

As the voice spoke, massive silhouettes materialized in the sky, solidifying into 100 colossal battlefields, each spanning 9,000 li, floating above the clouds.

"One hundred arenas, numbered 1 to 100."

"Each arena hosts 380,000 participants, with 1,296 Proud Cloud Tokens scattered within. After thirty days, token holders advance. The rest are eliminated."

"The first round begins in three hours. Prepare."

With that, the colossal face faded.

Zhang Jing stood frozen, perplexed.

The round was starting, but... what now?

His gaze drifted to the floating battlefields.

Then, a crimson number appeared before him:

29.

Understanding dawned.
