# Chapter 51: The End of Joy

"To accomplish a task well, one must first sharpen one's tools," Qin Ming murmured softly.

What he was about to do was very likely to cause a storm in this region, possibly even alerting Crimson Cloud City. He had to be fully prepared.

Besides lacking a good blade, Qin Ming also needed to master one or two more types of Tianguang Jin.

He already had a blade manual in hand. Additionally, Old Liu had initially convinced a family that once had some background but had now fallen into decline, which might allow Qin Ming to gain another type of Tianguang Jin. Coupled with the tricolored flower, it would significantly enhance his strength, so he naturally had to make sure everything was in place!

"Who is Qin Ming?"

At the village entrance, people from Golden Rooster Ridge were shouting, directly calling out Qin Ming's name.

"They're really paying attention to me," Qin Ming was a little surprised. Clearly, the two great bandits had specifically instructed their subordinates.

Old Liu quickly arrived, fearing that after his third awakening, Qin Ming might be overly confident and spirited, unwilling to humble himself. If he refused Golden Rooster Ridge, a bloody disaster would soon follow.

Despite having his collar grabbed by the great bandit, Old Liu was still resentful, but now the situation demanded compromise. He whispered, "Just comply for now."

"Don't worry, I'm not that impulsive," Qin Ming said. He calmly walked to the fire spring, and under the black and white tree, nodded in agreement to join Golden Rooster Ridge, letting them register his name.

"This ram of yours is really robust, very well raised," a young man from Golden Rooster Ridge said, spotting the black mountain goat at Yang Yongqing's house at the village entrance, instantly taking a liking to it.

Then, he simply seized the opportunity to take the goat, pulling out that strong old goat that was almost as tall as a man.

"Young man, I've grown attached to this goat; you can't take it away," Yang Yongqing quickly tried to stop him. The black mountain goat was getting stronger and stronger, about to mutate. He genuinely couldn't bear to part with it.

"To protect you villagers living close to the mountains, our Golden Rooster Ridge suffered very heavy losses this time, with not many golden roosters left. This black mountain goat is quite good; it can be used as a mount," the young man said.

Then, he glanced at Yang Yongqing again and said, "Hmm, you're also a Newborn. Why don't you sign up to join Golden Rooster Ridge too? After all, you're the owner of the black goat, and riding it would be just right. If it were someone else, it might not cooperate, and then it would definitely be killed for meat."

Yang Yongqing's face darkened, finding it preposterous. Not only were they seizing his goat, but they also wanted to take him along with it?

Qin Ming spoke up, "Our village is very small. Isn't it enough for just me to go?"

"We're short-handed now, and an extra black goat rider wouldn't be bad. Come on, I'll register you," the young man remained unmoved, forcibly jotting down Yang Yongqing's name.

During this process, Old Liu, who also lived at the village entrance, quickly returned home, kicked his large yellow dog into its kennel, warning it not to show its head.

The young man from Golden Rooster Ridge rode away on a golden rooster; he was surprisingly a second-stage Newborn. Before leaving, he told Qin Ming and Yang Yongqing to report to Golden Rooster Ridge five days later.

"Time is short; I must make the most of it!" Qin Ming told himself inwardly.

Xu Yueping patted Yang Yongqing's shoulder and said, "Try to look on the bright side. Although the people from Golden Rooster Ridge are truly despicable, once you're there, the treatment shouldn't be too bad."

Precisely because of this, not everyone disliked them recruiting. Some villages even had Newborns actively signing up, not caring about their bad reputation.

"Weren't they almost wiped out in the Great Rift Valley?" Yang Yongqing whispered.

Old Liu said, "Everyone knows that entering the Great Rift Valley might lead to bloody fights over mysterious resources, so those who remained guarding Golden Rooster Ridge must have some connections. This batch of people should be even worse; you wouldn't kill the wrong person even if you casually swung a blade at them."

Qin Ming glanced at him. The old man's face was flushed, currently undergoing his third awakening process.

Fortunately, the two great bandits from Golden Rooster Ridge were not present, otherwise, they would certainly notice his abnormality.

Afterward, Qin Ming went to Old Liu's house and asked if the matter of borrowing secret manuals had been settled.

"They reluctantly agreed, but the price might be very high. Let's go together tomorrow," Old Liu said, primarily because his third awakening wasn't complete yet.

Qin Ming nodded. The process of human awakening was a journey; by his estimation, his own would also last until tomorrow.

"You can't go around like this, with your face glowing red. If a master sees you, they'll definitely spot something amiss," Qin Ming taught him "Heguang Tongchen," which was very practical and easy to learn.

If Old Liu were to be exposed, Qin Ming's situation wouldn't be hidden either.

"Good! I was just worried about that, afraid of running into those two big bastards from Golden Rooster Ridge again," Old Liu said.

Then, he lowered his voice and asked, "Have you cultivated Tianguang Jin? They say the more you cultivate, the better. Truly famous Jin techniques are all integrated. I have one here called Entwining Silk Jin, taught to me by an old mountain patrolman years ago. Take it and try to practice."

"Good!" Qin Ming naturally wouldn't refuse. The silk scroll emphasized, "Integrate!"

"Do you want me to teach you a type of Tianguang Jin?" Qin Ming asked, preparing to return the favor.

"Forget it, I think what you practice isn't simple. You're not from this place; you must have some background, so it's better not to get involved. In the realm of the third awakening, one Entwining Silk Jin is enough for me to practice. Tomorrow, I might be able to benefit from seeing that local family's secret manual."

"Good!" Qin Ming nodded. Outsiders certainly couldn't practice what was on the silk scroll, and that blade manual was indeed a bit 'unpresentable' at the moment.

He returned to his small courtyard, first contemplating the Tianguang Jin he had cultivated, intending to study others after mastering it.

With a whoosh, his finger merely touched the hammer handle, and he quickly brought it into his hand.

Even when Qin Ming touched it with the back of his hand, the fluctuating Tianguang Jin could still pull the long-handled hammer into his hand. This was an "adhesion" characteristic.

If used against an enemy, a slight touch from his hand could directly adhere to and tear off the opponent's flesh.

Qin Ming tried to exert force. Tianguang Jin burst forth, "adhering" and tearing off the corner of a stone millstone.

Furthermore, this type of Tianguang Jin also had strong penetrative power. When his finger glowed, stone chips flew, and his fingertip pierced into the stone millstone.

After studying it, Qin Ming found that his Tianguang Jin touched upon various aspects and was, most critically, incredibly practical.

Soon after, he began practicing Old Liu's Entwining Silk Jin. The content wasn't much, making it relatively easy to learn, but it indeed had some profound principles. When this force was unleashed, it was like a silk thread swaying, focusing on the "entwining" aspect, emphasizing overcoming strength with skill, and the weak defeating the strong.

"Is this a Jin technique summarized and researched by generations of old mountain patrolmen while fighting giant beasts in the mountains?" Qin Ming had a sudden realization.

This wasn't a complicated Tianguang Jin technique, but it was quite useful in practical combat.

Qin Ming studied it diligently and got the hang of it in half a day. He couldn't call himself proficient, but he could use it.

"It seems my talent isn't bad."

Now, if he were to encounter Huang Jingde and the third-stage Newborn elder from Golden Rooster Ridge again, Qin Ming believed that without even using his immense physical strength, he could make both of them grovel with just the Entwining Silk Jin.

"Eh?!" What surprised him especially was that the Entwining Silk Jin was very compatible with his own Tianguang Jin, directly merging into his "Adhesion Jin."

This was his first successful integration of another Jin technique, which filled him with great joy.

Qin Ming tested it, and the integrated Tianguang Jin was even stronger!

"The Entwining Silk Jin I just cultivated was quickly merged away. I can't do this. I need to practice it separately first, and after consuming the tricolored flower, thoroughly perfect the Entwining Silk Jin before integrating it into my original Tianguang Jin."

Qin Ming rested on the stone millstone in the courtyard, preparing to study the Jin techniques in the blade manual later.

At this moment, he felt a sense of joyous accomplishment. Looking at the night sky, his gaze seemed to penetrate the boundless dark land in the distance, seeing the vibrant and majestic cities standing one after another.

He wanted to travel far, hoping to gain more Tianguang Jin techniques and witness what kind of natural treasures and outstanding people existed in prosperous lands.

Suddenly, Qin Ming's pupils constricted, but he quickly relaxed, maintaining composure, as if nothing had happened.

However, his heart was not at peace; a storm had already been stirred because he saw a black mist, like a spiritual snake swimming, coming from afar and circling above the village.

Finally, it descended, presumably reaching the ground.

Originally, Qin Ming's heart was filled with immense joy, but in the end, he encountered such a thing.

What exactly was that? His heart churned with waves, but he had to feign calmness, acting as if nothing had happened.

Others couldn't see the black mist swimming in the sky. Last time in the Great Rift Valley, even Old Liu, after his second awakening, felt nothing.

Qin Ming forced himself to calm down. He absolutely couldn't appear abnormal now, as his suet jade iron had yet to be forged into a weapon, leaving him unable to deal with those peculiar entities.

He remained composed, returned to his room, and began flipping through the damaged blade manual. Initially, he couldn't calm his mind, but slowly he became engrossed.

This ancient book carried the crystallized efforts of its predecessors. Qin Ming could resonate with those lingering emotions, perceiving secrets that transcended the book itself.

Therefore, Qin Ming was immensely looking forward to the Jin techniques in the blade manual.

"Hmm?"

Today was full of surprises. As Qin Ming was flipping through the Jin technique chapter, he sensed two strong emotions.

One was undoubtedly left by the old man who wrote the blade manual, and the other came from the reading notes left by a later generation.

"Oh, if only I could cultivate Rulai Jin!" That emotion was actually transmitted from this piece of text.

Qin Ming's heart immediately pounded. Had this person truly come into contact with it?!
