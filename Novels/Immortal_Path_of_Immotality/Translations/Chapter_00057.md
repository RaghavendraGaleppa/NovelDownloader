# Chapter 57: Hidden Doubts

Lin Shan was still savoring the power unleashed by his mid-grade magic weapon when he suddenly heard numerous footsteps approaching. 

Black-clad assassins from the Nightingale headquarters gathered along the twenty-meter-long stretch of shattered walls, staring wide-eyed at the scene. One couldn't resist touching the frost-covered broken edge of the wall, immediately recoiling from the intense cold with a shiver.

Soon after, the Grand Elder arrived, equally shocked by the sight. He peered hesitantly toward the origin point twenty meters away, lingering uncertainly for a long while.

Lin Shan quickly stored his Cold Iron Sword to prevent others from seeing his trump card.

Half an hour later, even the usually reclusive Immortal Huang made an appearance, exchanging uneasy glances with the Grand Elder as they surveyed the destroyed passage. 

They naturally suspected Lin Shan was responsible, but the scale of destruction was staggering! Neither dared approach immediately, fearing Lin Shan might be practicing or testing some spell. If he unleashed another strike while they were in range, their deaths would be tragically pointless.

After a prolonged wait with no further disturbances from Lin Shan's quarters, they cautiously approached. Finding Lin Shan composed and his qi stable—with no signs of excessive energy expenditure—the Grand Elder unconsciously adopted a respectful tone: "Immortal Lin, this earlier display was..."

"A momentary epiphany during cultivation," Lin Shan replied with effortless nonchalance. The strike hadn't consumed much spiritual energy—only about ten times that of a Wind Blade spell—with most of its power coming from the engraved runes and material enhancement of his magic sword.

The Grand Elder forced a smile. "Excellent news! Congratulations on your breakthrough, Immortal Lin. I'll have the courtyard walls repaired immediately. Shall we arrange temporary alternative accommodations for you?"

Glancing at his now drafty quarters, Lin Shan nodded.

——

He was relocated to a side hall this time. Previously unaware of Lin Shan's capabilities, the Nightingale organization now ensured his treatment surpassed even Immortal Huang's.

Seated in the hall, Lin Shan occupied the central position while the Grand Elder sat slightly bowed to his side. Immortal Huang, meanwhile, trembled—not from fear, but excitement.

Indeed, Immortal Huang was elated, convinced that with Lin Shan as his protector, their journey to Yichuan would be secure! Though not entirely foolish, he'd recognized the danger posed by the green-robed elder targeting his substantial wealth. Lin Shan's display of power rekindled his hopes.

Yet doubts lingered—would Lin Shan truly protect him throughout their journey based on their superficial acquaintance?

——

After some deliberation about his purpose for visiting Yichuan and assessing his available bargaining chips, Immortal Huang reached a decision.

Meanwhile, Lin Shan was discussing the collection of Nightingale tokens with the Grand Elder, who readily agreed after witnessing Lin Shan's power. "I'll gather the tokens from our headquarters within ten days," the Grand Elder assured while stroking his white eyebrows. "But collecting those scattered across the Great Song territory may take several months, perhaps half a year!"

Lin Shan expressed gratitude, vowing to fulfill his promise regarding the Vermilion Fruit. He indicated Immortal Huang could remain present since they'd be traveling together soon—his guidance would be essential for purchasing the fruit in Yichuan's market.

Their discussion concluded amicably. After the Grand Elder departed, Immortal Huang approached Lin Shan with visible hesitation, as if steeling himself for a request. "Fellow Daoist Lin, I have an imposition to ask—one only you can assist with," he said with a deep bow.

Lin Shan quickly stood—such gestures shortened lifespans; best not overdo them! "If this concerns safety during our journey, I can only promise to help when possible," he replied cautiously. Despite his newfound confidence from the mid-grade weapon, he avoided overpromising.

"That's sufficient!" Immortal Huang nodded emphatically, seating himself beside Lin Shan with a hand on his shoulder. "Truthfully, I have few years left. This trip to Yichuan is to settle an old matter."

As Immortal Huang elaborated, Lin Shan listened intently, curious why the man would risk this journey at life's end.

"In my youth, I served as a servant in Yichuan—endless chores, abuse from immortal masters and their kin..." Immortal Huang recounted his tragic experiences after being sold into servitude.

"Then one day at a brothel, I met Yuanchun—"

"Wait," Lin Shan interrupted. "A brothel? In an immortal marketplace?"

Immortal Huang explained patiently: "Some rogue cultivators, lacking skills to sustain themselves in Yichuan, resort to selling their bodies in pursuit of immortality. Some women choose this path; others, like me, were trafficked."

Lin Shan was astonished—a brothel in the cultivation world? "The fees must be exorbitant!"

Annoyed by the interruptions, Immortal Huang snapped, "Depending on cultivation level, beauty, techniques—some charge two spirit stones, others over a hundred per night!"

A hundred stones equaled twenty years of Immortal Huang's current earnings. Lin Shan whistled in amazement.

Immortal Huang continued: When his masters were pleased, they'd reward him with spirit stones. With nowhere else to spend them, he frequented the brothel and eventually grew attached to Yuanchun—another trafficking victim.

But redeeming an immortal courtesan required substantial resources. After twenty years of saving at the Nightingale, Immortal Huang had amassed over a hundred stones. Now nearing death, he was determined to risk everything to free Yuanchun.

Lin Shan was stunned—the debauched, hedonistic Immortal Huang was actually a romantic at heart? Who in the capital would believe it? Certainly not Lin Shan himself.

Immortal Huang pressed on: "Once we safely reach Yichuan, this gourd of spirit insects becomes useless. Selling it should recover some costs. Yuanchun's savings from her work should cover her redemption."

Observing the old man, Lin Shan found the story absurd—most cultivators dedicated every moment to breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm and glimpsing the mysteries of sword flight. Who had time for romance?

Yet he couldn't help asking: "Is this true?"

"Absolutely!" Immortal Huang declared. "If you ensure my safe arrival in Yichuan, I'll pay twenty spirit stones!"

"Deal!" Lin Shan currently lacked both ancient charm and spirit stones—free stones were irresistible. Though something felt off (Immortal Huang seemed an unlikely romantic), a mere early Qi Refining cultivator posed little threat. Remaining vigilant during their journey would suffice.

Their verbal agreement stipulated Lin Shan would assist when possible but could withdraw if necessary, with payment due upon safe arrival.

Lin Shan had no objections.
