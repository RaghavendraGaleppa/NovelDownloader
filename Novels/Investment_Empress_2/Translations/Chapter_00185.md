# Chapter 185: Has the Ice Cube Fallen into a Mental Spiral?

The next day, once again late at night.

Having just finished teaching Princess Jiang Chulong, Li Mo began reviewing the investment returns from the arena over the past two days.

Having stood on the arena for two consecutive days, there had been an endless stream of challengers seeking him out.

The martial heroes participating in the Martial Arts Summit were by no means weak in cultivation.

However, for some reason, their Destiny ratings were inconsistent. Most were Cyan, and even Blue was rare.

Nevertheless, Little Li had finally managed to avoid losing money. After all, all he had invested was some gold and a bit of guidance.

【Investment Return: Three Flowers of Five-Element Peony】
【Investment Return: White Jade Sarira】
【Investment Return: Hundred-Fruit Heavenly Fragrance Oil】
...

"First, let's pick out the items beneficial to the Soul of Intent."

A wooden box appeared in Li Mo's hand. Upon opening it, a brilliantly colored peony lay inside. Even though it had been severed from its roots, it showed no signs of withering.

He had seen this item on the Contribution Point Exchange List in the Internal Affairs Hall; it wasn't cheap. Even for a Vision Realm cultivator, it would take completing several difficult tasks to afford it.

However, its aura was indeed inferior to that of the White Jade Sarira.

Unfortunately, Little Li didn't understand Buddhist principles.

The profound meaning within this Sarira, left behind by a great monk, required Buddhist logic to guide its absorption. Otherwise, it was useless.

It was rather useless to him. He already had a hat that provided the effects of calming the mind and repelling evil spirits; why would he need a Sarira for that?

"Brother Murong is studying Buddhist principles."

"I'll save it for him."

After thinking it over, Li Mo put it away.

Then, somewhat puzzled, he picked up a crystal bottle.

Hundred-Fruit Heavenly Fragrance Oil?

Just from the name, it was hard to tell what this thing was used for. Was it for external application or internal consumption? What were its effects?

Little Li never speculated blindly about such matters; he directly checked the system description.

【Hundred-Fruit Heavenly Fragrance Oil】: "Removes filth and purifies, nourishes the body and mind. Produced by the Shuiyun Tower in the Imperial Capital of Central Continent. Highly praised by nobles and royalty. The experience is enhanced when used with massage techniques."

Li Mo: "?"

As is well known, novel protagonists usually have some secondary professions.

Such as forging, alchemy, or array formation...

What kind of protagonist has a side job as a massage parlor technician?

No way, this niche is way too small.

"Whatever, let's just pretend I didn't see this."

Li Mo casually tossed the crystal bottle into his system space.

Right.

He had also invested in Zhong Zhenyue yesterday.

He hadn't had a chance to claim the reward yet.

It should count as having a significant impact on his destiny...

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Zhong Zhenyue' and freeing him from Yin Mianmian's control.】
【Investment Return: Cry-Wind Beast Soul Pill】
【Cry-Wind Beast Soul Pill】: "Essence of the fifth-grade exotic beast, Cry-Wind Beast, refined and purified by a Grandmaster of the Dao of Alchemy. An excellent item for strengthening the Soul of Intent."

"Not bad, comparable to the Seven-Striated Void Pill."

Little Li felt bitter inside.

To tell the truth, the system had returned quite a few treasures for the Soul of Intent, but his consumption was simply too great.

He basically used them as soon as he got them.

Or rather, they were all used on 'Mona Sorbet'.

If not for the ones he had farmed over the past two days, his Vision Realm cultivation would have run out of fuel.

"Going so long without a breakthrough, I'm getting unaccustomed to it."

"Hmm... I am observing the Divine Form of the Great Dao. In reality, this speed isn't slow."

Li Mo reminded himself not to be impatient.

Judging from the martial artists he had fought over the past two days, most of them were only observing a Medium Divine Form.

If this weren't in Hengyun Sword City, he probably wouldn't even see so many Medium Forms.

And many of them were already over thirty, yet they hadn't even walked halfway through the Vision Realm. Many were stuck at a single orifice for several years.

Little Li decided to take stock of his assets to calm himself down.

Then, he ended up counting for half an hour.

His current assets were probably equivalent to the GDP of the entire Yunzhou for several years...

"Feels good."

Li Mo happily swallowed a Seven-Striated Void Pill and began today's observation of the Divine Intent.

Two hours later.

---

The药力 of the Seven-Striated Void Pill was completely depleted. He then took out the Cry-Wind Beast Soul Pill.

Unconsciously, time flowed away. The first ray of dawn broke through the window paper.

The fluctuations of the Divine Intent observation slowly came to a halt.

The small figure within his Dantian appeared increasingly real, with complex divine patterns.

"Time is up."

"Otherwise, I could try to冲击 the second orifice."

The moon shadows in Li Mo's eyes vanished. He stretched and stood up.

Just how many orifices are needed to fully outline the Divine Form of the Great Dao?

Little Li scurried into the kitchen.

Just as breakfast was ready, three ethereal bell tolls rang out, cleansing the layers of clouds and echoing through heaven and earth.

It was the morning bell of Hengyun Sword City.

"Although I didn't stand until the final day, this trip was not in vain."

Senior Brother Shen Yunfei had stepped down from the arena early, but he had made considerable progress.

"Congratulations on your breakthrough, Senior Brother."

Li Mo handed him a plate of fried dough sticks and congratulated him with a smile.

Suddenly, he froze, catching sight of Ouyang not far away.

Senior Brother Ouyang was currently sporting heavy dark circles under his eyes, his hair as messy as a chicken coop, and his face radiated an aura of looking like he had just seen a ghost.

"Senior Brother Ouyang, are you... possessed by a ghost?"

"It's nothing, no big deal. I finally made the deadline for the final day."

Upon asking, he learned that because the arena for the Sword Trial was only set up for three days, the Sword Tower would be opened after the seats were determined on the third day.

"The Bookstore thinks that both Junior Brother Li and Junior Sister Ying will comprehend extraordinary martial arts from the Hengyun Sword Mark. They will definitely become famous then."

"By then, the picture books will definitely sell like hotcakes."

"So I didn't sleep for three days and finished drawing 'The Overbearing Empress Falls in Love with Me'."

Ouyang scratched his messy hair and couldn't stop yawning.

Li Mo: "..."

Those damn novel writers really should learn from Senior Brother.

However, becoming famous was certain, but whether the picture books would sell well was another matter.

Once he finished comprehending the Hengyun Sword Mark, there was a high chance that Sword Immortal Li would face a scandal.

As for the Ice Cube.

"Sister Ice's sword... seems to be... not as... sharp as... before..."

Jiang Chulong rolled up her sleeves, washing the dishes and speaking softly.

"You noticed it too?"

Li Mo had thought it was just his imagination.

Why was her condition getting worse the more she participated in the Sword Trial?

Hmm...

"Could it be that she was injured during her fight with Yin Mianmian the other day?!"

At that moment, light footsteps came from the upper floor of the pavilion.

"Would you like some tea?"

"Yeah..."

Ying Bing seemed to be in a daze for a moment, waiting a few seconds before nodding.

"Isn't it for tea?"

"I brought this..."

Ying Bing's gaze froze.

She had just realized she was holding Little Li's big-headed doll. She had subconsciously unscrewed the doll's head, seemingly preparing to bring it to her lips for a sip...

The Ice Cube was definitely acting strange.

What was going on?

As Li Mo brewed the tea, he activated his Destiny Eye.

【Name: Ying Bing】
【Age: 16】
【Physique: Moon Phoenix of Yin.】
【Cultivation: Vision Realm, One Orifice.】
【Destiny: Red (Carrying the Empress Bone, with玄Ice as Fate and Autumn Water as Spirit, possessing the appearance of a Phoenix ruling the Heavens).】
【Evaluation: Fate is filled with tribulations, but she always turns bad luck into good. Currently, her feathers are not yet full. When the winds and clouds change, she will surely hang high above the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, ruling the Six Directions and Eight Wastes.】
【Recent Encounter: Unsure whether to persist in her own Dao of Martial Arts and sever all ties; her heart is in a struggle between two opposing forces.

Hmm.

To put it simply.

Has the Ice Cube fallen into a mental spiral?
