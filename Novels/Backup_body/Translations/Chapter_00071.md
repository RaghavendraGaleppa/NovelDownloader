# Chapter 71: He Once Shattered a True God!

The temple collapsed with a thunderous roar!

Li Zhengjing staggered backward as dust filled the air. The strange old man stood motionless amidst the ruins, while the phantom that had emerged from the divine altar's inscriptions fixed its murderous gaze on Li Zhengjing.

It seemed to believe that its "creditor" had seen the inscriptions and shattered the altar. Worse yet, it had mistaken Li Zhengjing for that very creditor! The killing intent emanating from it sent chills down his spine.

"Master..." the wall-clinging bird trembled. "Did you lend him money before? Maybe we should just write off the debt? Look at him—clearly not the type to repay honestly..."

"I don't even know him!" Li Zhengjing's throat went dry.

Even without consulting the golden page, he knew exactly who this phantom was—the one who had left the inscriptions and sacrificed himself to suppress the source of the malevolent energy. The first Grand Preceptor of the Great Zhou Dynasty! But why did it think he was its creditor?

The phantom stared at Li Zhengjing with a complex expression.

"Thanks to your boon, three generations of my lineage achieved immortality."

"By the time I awakened from my slumber, over 2,300 years had passed."

"The opportunity you bestowed matured under my care."

"Now that it has ripened, I knew you would come to claim it."

"But... by the time you arrived here, I had already sealed myself beneath Mount Fengdu."

The phantom's voice was heavy as it continued, "In my prime, I had no confidence in sealing the source of corruption. In my twilight years, the odds were even slimmer. So I waited for you..."

It laughed, its form dissipating as its final words lingered: "Three generations and over two millennia of nurturing—you won't reap the fruits so easily. If you want them back, retrieve them from the source of corruption yourself!"

With that, the phantom vanished completely, its voice fading into silence. The ruined temple was now nothing but rubble.

Li Zhengjing fell into deep thought. Aside from the bird and the tree, the old man was also present—and he was the one who had shattered the altar. So why had the Grand Preceptor focused solely on him? Why was he mistaken for the creditor? Was it because of Qianhuan Shenjun?

"What kind of opportunity takes over two thousand years to mature?" Li Zhengjing pondered. "The Grand Preceptor couldn't bear to see his lineage's labor taken so easily. Was this his final act—forcing the creditor to confront the source of corruption beneath Mount Fengdu?"

Did the Grand Preceptor, unable to seal the corruption himself, intend for the creditor to do it? Or was his true aim to lure the creditor to their doom at the source? Was this his last act of benevolence for the world?

Li Zhengjing took a deep breath. "Three generations of immortals spanning over two millennia... So this creditor must be at least two or three thousand years old?"

As far as he knew, even transcendent immortals couldn't live beyond a thousand years. Even deities eventually perished with time. What kind of existence could this creditor be, surviving for millennia?

Wait... something didn't add up. What was he missing?

Just as Li Zhengjing felt he was on the verge of grasping a crucial clue, a furious roar shattered his thoughts.

"YOU'RE THE CREDITOR?!" The mad old man bellowed, striking out with a palm.

A blinding light erupted, shaking the earth for miles. Before the strike even landed, Li Zhengjing felt his body tearing apart from the sheer force.

"Damn it!" Frozen in place, Li Zhengjing couldn't even swallow a spirit stone in time. Desperate, he focused his mind and glanced at the golden page.

His fate remained unchanged—he would still die from the backlash of the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi. But he was about to die right now!

In that split second, Li Zhengjing's vision went white. Summoning all his strength, he channeled the Blazing Sun Divine Sword in his left hand. The sword's edge gleamed, its flames blazing.

Just as he prepared to unleash his full power—the crushing pressure vanished.

The mad old man withdrew his attack, leaning in curiously. "You have the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi in you? Wasn't that sealed away? Wait... I remember only the Young Master of Kunlun Immortal Sect mastered that technique."

He studied Li Zhengjing closely. "Young Master, how did you get uglier? And weaker?"

"..." 

Heart still pounding, Li Zhengjing replied, "I had a cultivation mishap recently. Lost some strength... and became more handsome."

"Oh..." The old man scratched his head. "But why did he mistake you for the creditor?"

Li Zhengjing stiffened before whispering, "Maybe he's as crazy as you?"

The old man nodded sagely. "If he went to the depths of Mount Fengdu, he probably saw a True God like I did. That'd drive anyone mad."

Li Zhengjing paused. "True God?"

The old man burst into laughter, looking around conspiratorially. "This is a secret—just between us... I saw a True God..."

Glancing at the ruins, Li Zhengjing asked, "The temple had a false god. So... what does a True God look like?"

The old man froze, then muttered blankly, "A True God? What did they look like? I can't remember... Wait... I remember now... The True God was shattered..."

He laughed maniacally, waving his arms. "I saw a True God! I shattered it! It died! Even legendary True Gods can die!"

Tears streamed down his face. "I killed a god! I shattered a True God..."

His emotions spiraled out of control, his aura erupting violently. The ground trembled, space distorted, and Li Zhengjing was sent flying. Darkness and dust swirled, forming a raging storm.

"Master, he's lost it again!" the bird cried. "We can't withstand his power—we need to run!"

"Senior! Senior!" Li Zhengjing shouted, channeling his inner energy. "Only false gods can be destroyed! It must have been a false god!"

"Impossible! It was a True God!" The old man's eyes burned crimson. "Brat! Trying to shake my Dao heart? I'll kill you!"

He raised his hand to strike—then paused.

"Huh? Young Master? What are you doing here?"

"Just... passing by," Li Zhengjing muttered.

"Oh... then let me tell you a secret. Don't tell anyone..." The old man glanced around furtively. "I saw a True God..."

"Not interested in that secret." Li Zhengjing waved a hand. "How about we talk about this 'creditor' instead?"

"Creditor?" The old man scratched his head. "I heard he wanted to steal Kunlun Immortal Sect's opportunity... No, wait—he wanted to steal from everyone! The Sect Leader said to kill him on sight!"

He frowned in confusion. "But didn't the creditor die here? I remember him dragging the Feather Transformation Sect's leader to their deaths in Mount Fengdu... Right, he's dead. Why worry?"

"What if he's not dead?" Li Zhengjing asked softly.

The old man's expression blanked. "Not dead? True Gods can't die... What if he's not dead? Hahaha! He's alive! He must be!"

And just like that, the old man was lost to madness again.

Li Zhengjing backed away, exasperated. He suspected the so-called "creditor" was Qianhuan Shenjun. But this old man's insanity made coherent conversation impossible—every topic circled back to "True Gods."

As Li Zhengjing sighed in frustration, the old man suddenly laughed wildly and sprinted northward.

"True Gods don't die!"

"He's still there! I'll find him! He'll help me ascend!"

"I'll become immortal! Hahaha..."

Stunned, Li Zhengjing watched the old man vanish into the distance.

"Master, what now?" the bird whispered.

Night had fallen. Malevolent energy churned like a sandstorm. Fleeing south to Twin-Nine City was risky—not only was it beyond the storm's reach, but the battle between immortals there showed no signs of ending.

Li Zhengjing swallowed a low-grade spirit stone and consulted the golden page. The answer was clear.

"Follow him!" he declared. "He's insane, but he's still an immortal. The corruption can't touch him within ten zhang. Staying near him keeps us safe. Even if other evils lurk, his presence will protect us."

"But he's mad..." the bird hesitated.

The Five Elements Creation Tree piped up, "This old man seems more dangerous than the corruption. What if he kills us?"

Li Zhengjing pointed at himself. "To him, the only person who's mastered the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi is Kunlun's Young Master. Right now, that's me."

"Right! You're our lifeline!" the bird exclaimed. "Let's go—he's getting away!"

Though the old man was an immortal, he wasn't using his powers—just running wildly. Li Zhengjing strapped on the wooden crate, tucked the bird inside, and activated his last Divine Movement Talisman to follow.

The old man strode through the storm, his righteous aura repelling corruption for ten zhang around. Li Zhengjing stayed within five zhang, sighing in relief. It was like finding shelter in a tempest.

He removed the talisman to conserve its energy for the return trip.

"Master, we're heading north," the bird noted. "The wrong way."

"Stick with him tonight," Li Zhengjing decided. "Once dawn breaks and the corruption weakens, we'll turn back. With the talisman, we can reach Twin-Nine City by day."

The old man suddenly turned. "You're coming this way too?"

"Same path," Li Zhengjing said.

The old man beamed. "I'm going to Mount Fengdu to die! You joining me?"

"...Die?"

The bird and tree immediately retreated into the crate.

This madman was heading to his death? Were they supposed to follow?

As they hesitated, six or seven figures emerged from the gloom—mutilated corpses.

"Master, their robes... Luo Fu Immortal Sect disciples," the bird observed. "Dead for years. The corruption twisted them. They smell living flesh..."

"Victims of the northern calamity, buried here instead of returning to Central Province," Li Zhengjing murmured.

"Dead should rest. You vile things defile their remains!" The old man's voice turned icy.

With a single palm strike, brilliant light erupted. The figures vanished without a trace.

"Who is this old man?" the bird gasped. "Those things would've taken effort for us. He wiped them out effortlessly—my grandfather might not even match him!"

After attacking, the old man's clarity faded again. He scratched his head, suddenly suspicious.

"You hid behind me. Using me as labor?" He glowered. "I'm insane, not stupid! Next time, you fight!"

As if on cue, a one-armed figure shambled into view, swaying unsteadily.

"This one's weak! My turn!" The bird soared up, spewing Blazing Sun flames.

The corruption scattered, flames engulfing the figure—yet it kept advancing, unharmed.

"Master, help!" the bird screeched, darting back. "This one's strong!"

Li Zhengjing drew his blade, Thunderclap Mountain-Splitter Sword Art at the ready. The strike clanged against the figure's body as if hitting metal.

"Fall back!" Li Zhengjing retreated hastily. "Its body's harder than tempered steel—an immortal's corpse!"

"Hey, I know him..." The old man peered closer. "Luo Fu's Seventh Hall Master. Died miserably. Corruption fused with his lingering will."

Suddenly, his eyes sharpened, voice solemn. "An immortal in life, now a great evil. I'll lay you to rest."

His aura erupted, pushing back the corruption.

"He's sane now?" the bird exclaimed.

"Half-cured by that scoundrel, probably," the tree muttered.

"That 'scoundrel' must be Ghost Valley's Spirit Physician," Li Zhengjing realized.

The physician's skills were unparalleled—he could've treated the old man's madness. And he'd sought help from Feather Transformation Sect at Twin-Nine City.

Li Zhengjing checked the golden page. His fate read: "Stands still, watches Kunlun's Elder Xuji battle Luo Fu's Seventh Hall Master. Caught in the aftermath, dies in pieces."

"Shit! RUN!"

Activating the Divine Movement Talisman, Li Zhengjing fled with the bird. "He's not protecting us anymore—he knows I'm not the Young Master!"

The old man, now lucid, no longer saw him as Kunlun's heir. Their lifeline was gone.

As he sprinted northwest through the darkness, a green light streaked across the sky.

"Rescue?" the bird asked hopefully.

"Or death." Li Zhengjing stowed Chen Youyu's glowing pearl and changed direction.

The light wavered, dimmed, then plummeted like a falling star.

Consulting the golden page, Li Zhengjing paled.

Fate: "The Ninth Helm of the Salvation Golden Ship, severely wounded by Feather Transformation's Ancient Moon Peak Master, flees the battle. Blood energy dissipating, he craves flesh. Your pearl's light alerted him. Though the corruption obscures senses, his arts have locked onto you. He comes to feast and heal."

Method to alter fate: "Head north. Cross the river at the encounter!"

Li Zhengjing swallowed a premium spirit stone and ran.

His mind reeled. "The Ninth Helm fled from a one-versus-three fight? How strong is the Ancient Moon Peak Master?"

Soon, the sound of water reached him. After what felt like an eternity, a narrow river came into view—barely five meters wide, its waters eerily glowing with ghostly lights.

Behind him, a piercing sensation warned of approaching danger.

Without hesitation, Li Zhengjing leaped across.

Half an hour later, a green light approached the riverbank—an elderly man leaning on a cane, breathing raggedly. A gaping wound in his abdomen still bled.

"He crossed the Nether River into Mount Fengdu?" the Ninth Helm muttered. "His aura carries traces of Elder Xuji and the Ancient Moon Peak Master..."

Grimacing, he stepped onto the river. "I've entered Fengdu before. Once more won't hurt."

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing's Divine Movement Talisman burned out. The corruption here was thicker, draining the talisman's energy faster.

"Why is he so persistent?" Li Zhengjing cursed. "Is my flesh really that tempting?"

Suddenly, a voice spoke: "Twelve li northwest—shelter there."

"Who's there?" Li Zhengjing gripped his blade, scanning the darkness.

"The Ninth Helm is thirty li behind you. Five li ahead, thirty-six Kunlun elders' corpses—former Qi Refining experts, now corpse-demons in the corruption."

"This is Fengdu's outskirts. Deeper in, closer to the source, it's worse. You're the only living prey here."

"Crossing the Nether River woke them all."

Li Zhengjing checked the golden page and obeyed, sprinting northwest. Without the talisman, he relied on his Windshadow Body Art, outpacing normal peak Internal Energy cultivators.

Corrupt spirits and corpse-demons slowed him, but his blade cut them down.

"The Ninth Helm is ten li behind. Three li to safety—hurry!"

Ahead, a cluster of buildings glowed faintly—a sanctuary amidst the darkness.

"Throw your sect token forward to bypass the wards!" the voice urged. "He's two li away!"

Li Zhengjing hurled his silver-and-gold token and leaped—

A green light grazed his shoulder, tearing off flesh. He crashed through a roof, dazed but alive.

"Who are you? Where are you?" he demanded, clutching his blade.

"I'm in your pocket."

Li Zhengjing froze, then retrieved a broken jade fragment pulsing with golden light.

"Elder Yuan?"

"Yes."

"You're... awake?"

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice was weary. "Fengdu is the land of the dead. Only here, between life and death, could I awaken."

He sighed. "A decade passed in what felt like an instant. Without you, I might have slept forever."

Studying the jade, Li Zhengjing asked, "You recognized the Ninth Helm?"

"I sensed everything since Twin-Nine City. The Grand Preceptor mistaking you for the creditor... The Ancient Moon Peak Master fighting three Helms..."

After a pause, Yuan Zhengfeng's tone turned grave. "You're just a spare body, aren't you?"
