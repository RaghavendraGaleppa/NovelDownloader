**Chapter 74: The Seventh Life**

[You failed to break through to Foundation Establishment, and your body perished, your cultivation base gone.]
[Current Hundred Lives Scroll remaining pages: 94]
[Restarting a new life, you can choose one of the following gains from your previous life:]
[One: Treasure.]
[Two: Cultivation.]
[Three: Lifespan.]
[Four: Abandon all gains and randomly awaken a talent based on your previous life's experiences.]

"Those whose names are called, step forward."

Liu Xin's voice came from the platform, but Lu Yang was completely oblivious, his mind still fixated on the interface of the Hundred Lives Scroll. It was a long time before he finally came back to his senses: "I choose cultivation."

The next second, his empty body was filled with surging True Qi. His previous life's Qi Condensation Level 10 Great Perfection realm, along with the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light, Profound Yin Soul Seizing Great Law, Grand Radiance Decree and Pardon Treasure Talisman, and the Sage's Plunder — all these divine abilities returned to their place, making Lu Yang let out a satisfied sigh.

"Grand Radiance Talisman, Decree of Heavenly Pardon!"

The next moment, Lu Yang activated the Grand Radiance Decree and Pardon Treasure Talisman, simultaneously empowering it with the status of the Sage's Plunder, layering a phantom karmic connection onto his own karmic thread.

In his previous life's century of arduous cultivation, he had not wasted a single moment. With the help of the Enlightenment Jade Slip, his attainments in both formation arrays and talisman arts had reached Seventh Rank, which was basically the limit a Qi Condensation cultivator could achieve. Among these, talisman arts were his primary focus. His greatest achievement was successfully reproducing the "Innate Primordial Chaos One Qi Divine Talisman" he used in his previous life to obscure heavenly secrets, retaining thirty percent of its original effect.

"Enough for now."

"After all, the original version was drawn by a Foundation Establishment True Person, imbued with the status of Foundation Establishment. It's unrealistic for me to perfectly reproduce it. Thirty percent is already quite good."

*Boom!*

The next second, Lu Yang felt a change in the great karmic net. It was as if a powerful surge of qi aura swept across, tracing along the karmic thread of True Person Panlong's legacy, pursuing him. Lu Yang instantly recognized the owner of the qi aura—it was none other than the Heaven Mending Peak Master!

What a quick reaction! In his previous lives, the Heaven Mending Peak Master would only find him years later, but now he had tracked him down almost immediately. Was it because his cultivation was higher?

"However... this time is different!"

Lu Yang calmed his mind. Since he had chosen cultivation and inherited True Person Panlong's karma, he had anticipated being found by the Heaven Mending Peak Master. However, this time, there was a significant difference from before.

He had a 'status'!

For a Foundation Establishment True Person to divine an ordinary person without a status was naturally unfailing. But once the target possessed a status, the difficulty of divination would immediately skyrocket.

"Hmph! Junior seeks death!"

Through the great karmic net, Lu Yang heard the Heaven Mending Peak Master's slightly indignant voice reverberating thunderously. He had clearly detected Lu Yang's action of obscuring heavenly secrets, and had even seen through Lu Yang's true background, discerning that Lu Yang was not a Foundation Establishment True Person, but a Qi Condensation cultivator possessing a status.

The next second, Lu Yang felt the Heaven Mending Peak Master getting serious. A massive wave of divine sense swept over, directly breaking through the layer of phantom karma he had laid down, chasing directly to the source. It wouldn't take more than a quarter of an hour to pinpoint his location.

"So strong, too strong..." Lu Yang sighed inwardly, yet he wasn't flustered. The Heaven Mending Peak Master needed a quarter of an hour to locate him, but what he needed to do wouldn't even take that long.

The next moment, Lu Yang moved. He left his Innate One Qi Incarnation in place, while his true body concealed itself and fled, then directly sought out Liu Xin and took his genuine divine talisman. With Lu Yang's current cultivation, dealing with Liu Xin, who was still in the middle Qi Condensation stage, was as easy as pie. Liu Xin didn't notice anything amiss from beginning to end. Moreover, to avoid alarming the enemy, after Lu Yang took the divine talisman, he specifically replaced it with a 'lite' version he had crafted himself.

"Who is it!?"

Almost immediately after he took the genuine divine talisman, it wasn't long before the Heaven Mending Peak Master completely broke through Lu Yang's blockade and began to sweep across the great karmic net. Yet, he found nothing. This experience, of having been almost played for a fool, instantly enraged the Heaven Mending Peak Master. But no matter how he divined the heavenly secrets, he could not find the instigator.

This strange development plunged the Heaven Mending Peak Master into silence. After a long while, he spoke again: "Hongyun, was it you?"

"Huh?"

Within the Saint Sect, a handsome Daoist with jade-like bones and refined spirit opened his eyes, a hint of helplessness on his face. "Old Monster Chen, don't slander me with baseless accusations."

"Hmph! It must be you!"

The Heaven Mending Peak Master seemed to have concluded that Daoist Hongyun was behind all this, and he immediately sneered, "Panlong entrusted his legacy to me before he died, saying that I would be the one to designate the successor. You dared to secretly fish it away through the hand of a junior. Do you truly think I would be afraid of your identity and not dare to act?"

Daoist Hongyun narrowed his eyes upon hearing this. "Panlong's legacy was fished away?"

"Stop playing dumb with me," the Heaven Mending Peak Master's voice continued. "This matter between you and I is far from over. A True Monarch reincarnated... is ultimately no longer a True Monarch!"

Soon, the fluctuations on the great karmic net dispersed. Clearly, although the Heaven Mending Peak Master spoke fiercely, he still had reservations and did not dare to directly attack. Nevertheless, Daoist Hongyun still felt annoyed. After all, the Heaven Mending Peak Master was one of the top cultivators among the various Foundation Establishment experts in the Saint Sect, not so easily dismissed. He had been cultivating peacefully in his immortal cave, only to inexplicably attract a powerful adversary. Naturally, he was not in a good mood, and at the same time, immense curiosity arose within him.

"Who is scheming against me?"

Daoist Hongyun divined with his fingers but found nothing, causing him to frown. "If it's not a scheme... then it's an unintentional mistake, and I was affected by chance?"

"Interesting!"

"Listening to Bu Tian, there's a junior who took away the Panlong legacy from him, and he hasn't even figured out who it is? Which junior has such audacity?"

The more Daoist Hongyun thought about it, the more curious he became, feeling an unbearable itch in his heart. "Unfortunately, this junior seems to possess a secret treasure that can obscure heavenly secrets, making ordinary methods useless in divining him... But using 'Overturning Lamp Fire' for the sake of a mere junior seems excessive, not worth the gain. Forget it, the main business is more important."

With that thought, Daoist Hongyun shifted his attention. Almost simultaneously, a disciple within the Saint Sect suddenly lifted his head. His previously dim thoughts became clear, and his demeanor became majestic and spirited. His name was Xiao Shiye.

"How terrifying..."

Inside the Joyful Union Palace, Lu Yang had now been lured into the immortal cave by Yu Suzhen, just as it had unfolded in previous lives. Liu Xin was already waiting at the entrance. Originally, the next step would have been the counter-kill against Yu Suzhen. However, this time, Lu Yang had changed his mind.

"In this life, I am cultivating the 'Grand Yin Corpse Release True Method,' which means I am destined to 'die once.' If that's the case, why not simply die here?"

This time, Lu Yang intended to let Yu Suzhen plunder his vital energy!

In addition, he also planned to use Yu Suzhen to test an idea he had, and the correctness of this idea would determine his goal for this life. That was the Heaven's Secrets Plundering Art! This Foundation Establishment secret art, which Zhao Xuhe had traded to him, allowed one to cultivate with an opposite-sex partner, implanting one's own qi essence, and making the other party work for one's own benefit.

Lu Yang's idea was simple: Can this thing be stacked? Because this secret art was limited to the opposite sex, if he used it himself, he could only use it on females, such as Immortal Fei Xia, Immortal Qing He, and others. But whether it was Immortal Fei Xia or Immortal Qing He, their talent and strength were very limited, completely unable to meet his needs. The only one who met the requirements, Yun Miaozhen, was far away in the Sword Pavilion.

In comparison, males were different. Liu Xin, Zhao Xuhe, Xiao Shiye—each one was a heavyweight, almost all of them could be called Foundation Establishment seeds, blessed with profound fortune, and they were all right by his side.

Thus, Lu Yang formulated a plan: If the Heaven's Secrets Plundering Art could be stacked, he would first use it on Yu Suzhen, turning her into a puppet. Then, he would have her learn the Heaven's Secrets Plundering Art and cultivate with Heaven's Chosen individuals like Liu Xin, Zhao Xuhe, and Xiao Shiye. Wouldn't that allow him to indirectly use the Heaven's Secrets Plundering Art on Xiao Shiye and the others?

Daoist Hongyun had almost scared him to death back then. In this life, it was the perfect opportunity for revenge. He had created a Son of Destiny, Xiao Shiye, who surpassed countless disciples. Then he would create a Daughter of Destiny, Yu Suzhen, who surpassed Xiao Shiye!
