# Chapter 90: The Ruins of Joy Sect

Boarding Lin Fan's flying vessel, Lin Shan noticed a lever mechanism at the front, clearly the control for the craft. Beside it was a slot holding a massive wind-attribute spirit stone. 

Sensing the vast spiritual energy contained within, Lin Shan couldn't help but compare it to the dozens of spirit stones he'd obtained from Prince Qi's son and the middle-aged man in brocade robes. To his astonishment, their combined energy didn't equal even this single stone.

"This is a mid-grade spirit stone," Lin Fan explained casually, seeing Lin Shan's curiosity. "Since wind attributes are relatively rare, the exchange rate is about 1:120 compared to low-grade stones."

Lin Shan's eyes nearly popped out. So when you said "half a stone per thousand kilometers," you meant mid-grade stones? 

You rich bastard! My entire monthly stipend wouldn't even cover a single day's fuel for your flying vessel!

Lin Fan, brimming with confidence, took the controls and lifted the lever with a smile: "This high-grade wind-type flying artifact rivals the speed of Foundation Establishment cultivators flying on swords. Exploring with me is absolutely safe—you can rest assured!"

Lin Shan couldn't help but marvel. A high-grade wind-type flying artifact—to have such transportation at the Qi Refining stage was truly enviable.

...

Their vessel traveled steadily, covering thousands of miles each day. In about three days, they reached the Jiangdong region.

According to reports, recent shifts in the earth's veins and river courses had unearthed several long-buried sect ruins from history. The largest among them was the ruins of the "Joy Sect" by the Ou River.

Naturally, they headed straight for the biggest prize.

After another day and night, their vessel arrived at the Joy Sect ruins. Stowing the artifact, they proceeded on foot.

The area teemed with cultivators searching for treasures, possibly even Foundation Establishment experts. As mere Qi Refining cultivators, flying conspicuously overhead might attract unwanted attention from higher-level practitioners.

Though the ruins had been discovered nearly half a year prior, with the obvious treasures already claimed by nearby cultivation families and sects, diligent searchers could still uncover hidden artifacts in corners or beneath rubble.

Now, the site was primarily frequented by rogue cultivators—after the major factions had taken their share, they left scraps for others to avoid inciting resentment. Currently, nearly thirty percent of Jiangdong's rogue cultivators had gathered here.

Everywhere Lin Shan and Lin Fan passed, they saw groups of Qi Refining cultivators sifting through broken walls and debris.

---

The ruins spanned dozens of miles, encompassing nearly a dozen mountain peaks.

Each was a spiritual mountain, rich in energy and fragrant with vitality. Deep underground, spiritual veins converged, and some rogue cultivators had even settled here to cultivate.

The temples and halls were strategically placed according to feng shui principles. Murals depicted the Joy Sect's glorious past—grand gatherings, devotees worshiping the Joy Buddha, and various intimate postures of dual cultivation.

Spiritual birds occasionally soared overhead, while ancient trees towered among the ruined temples. The undergrowth rustled, some plants already showing signs of evolving into spiritual herbs.

"These spiritual mountains are nearly as rich in energy as cultivation marketplaces! It's a golden age for rogue cultivators," Lin Shan remarked, marveling at the opportunity to cultivate freely without cost.

Lin Fan shook his head. "This is temporary. Spiritual veins are hotly contested by sects and families. They're just negotiating now—it'll be settled within a few years."

Lin Shan sighed inwardly. The cultivation world was a brutal hierarchy—sects and families grew stronger by monopolizing spiritual veins, squeezing out rogue cultivators.

In Yi River, he'd witnessed stark disparities. Gongsun Yu of the Gongsun family had casually shared hundred-spirit-stone wines like water, while struggling rogue cultivators scraped by selling talismans for pennies.

Glancing at Lin Fan, Lin Shan noted that just the fuel costs for their journey exceeded months of his own earnings.

Sensing his gaze, Lin Fan said calmly, "It's not as extreme as you think. Even in sects and families, resources concentrate at the top. The higher your cultivation, the more you control."

"Unless you're a top-tier young master, ordinary disciples only fare slightly better than rogue cultivators. Even as a direct disciple, my benefits aren't outrageous. My senior brothers Lei Zhenzi and Lei Yunzi still take mundane missions for resources."

"My current wealth comes from my own adventures, not the sect."

Lin Shan pondered this. He'd asked Lin Fan about major sects' recruitment standards—who wouldn't want to join a powerful faction? But Lin Fan had dashed his hopes.

Without at least grade-B spiritual roots in one attribute, entering as an inner disciple was nearly impossible. Major sects focused on elite cultivation, and resources were limited.

Lin Shan's dual wind-and-thunder grade-C roots might have qualified him for outer disciple training if he'd joined young. But as an established late-stage Qi Refining cultivator, acceptance was unlikely.

As they traveled between spiritual mountains, they frequently witnessed clashes—over treasures, prime cultivation spots, or outright robbery. But their late-stage Qi Refining aura deterred most attackers.

After two days, they reached a narrow mountain bridge where a large-scale battle raged. Normally, they'd avoid such conflicts, but certain shouts caught Lin Shan's attention.

"Stop him! He has the ancient treasure map and Joy Buddha statue!"

"The map holds Buddhist secrets!"

"The statue can be traded to Master Xingtai for spirit stones!"

"Surrender the map!"

"Hand over the statue!"

Amid the chaos, Lin Shan focused on "Joy Buddha statue." Apparently, months ago, a monk named Xingtai had offered a thousand spirit stones per statue, sparking fierce competition.

"Someone's specifically collecting these statues?" Lin Shan recalled the Red-Faced Monk and the Joy Sect's obsession with them. Aside from faith, the statues seemed useless. Could they absorb faith too? Or were they gathering them for some organization?

While Lin Shan mused, Lin Fan perked up at "ancient treasure map." Treasure hunting was his passion—the nature of the treasure mattered little!

With a battle cry, Lin Fan charged into the fray, targeting the group fleeing with the map.

"Hand over the ancient treasure map!"

Leaving Lin Shan dumbfounded. There were hundreds of people there! Are you seriously this reckless?
