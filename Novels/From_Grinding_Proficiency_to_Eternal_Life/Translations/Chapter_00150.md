# Chapter 150: The Manifestation of the Primordial Spirit

North Star raised his head slowly, his gaze heavy and solemn.

"The Empress has gone mad..."

He muttered to himself, looking in the direction of Yujing. His hand subconsciously tightened around the sword hilt. He didn't know if he regretted not stopping the Empress when he was in Yujing that day, or if he felt that her actions had already far exceeded his expectations.

For a moment, he stood dazed in the great hall, watching the churning sea of blood-colored clouds before him.

The divine weapon in his hand hummed, vibrating on its own, as if resonating with the heavens.

At some point, the pale clouds in the sky had now been stained with a layer of blood.

As time passed, the earth's veins rolled like dragons. The entire Great Zhou territory seemed to be vibrating and trembling. The ground dragon turned over, the earth cracked, and strange auras began to rise from the fissures in the ground.

Above the Observatory in Yujing, the condensed blood clouds suddenly split into nine fissures. Guo Lang knew this was his last chance.

He bit the tip of his tongue and spat out his life essence blood. The Taiyi Splitting Light Sword Qi instantly transformed into a hundred-zhang green light, charging straight at the Observatory. A flash of green light flowed and spread along the ground, like a green swamp crashing into the earth through the base of the tower.

The entire world seemed to change abruptly.

"Heaven and earth are inverted, the Yang Nine and the Hundred Six, open!"

Guo Lang on the Observatory suddenly let out a muffled groan, the Taiyi Splitting Light Sword almost slipping from his grasp. The jade meridians he had cultivated were convulsing violently under his skin, a sign of his meridians being overloaded.

Sixteen blood-colored divination symbols appeared on the surface of the blood pool, each corresponding to the fate of the people from the thirty-six states of Great Zhou that had been sacrificed.

Great Zhou had six paths and seventy-nine states. The population of each state varied, but sixteen states had been massacred, and the chaos in the remaining states was not counted. The blood sacrifice of over thirty-six million people was already astonishing.

"Supervisor! The blood jar at the Dui position is cracking!"

The deputy's shout carried a trembling tone.

Guo Lang caught a glimpse of the bronze jar carved with the Ya Chi patterns at the northwest corner leaking blood; spider-web-like cracks appeared on the jar's surface. It was a soul-suppressing jar made of Northern Desert black iron, but it could no longer suppress the resentment of the hearts' blood from millions of people in several states collected within.

Although the Primordial Spirit of heaven and earth had dissipated, it could be gathered using human hearts to obtain great power in the late Dharma era.

Guo Lang bit his tongue again and spat out essence blood. The divine sword's blade suddenly grew a three-foot green aura.

The twelve dragon-engraved pillars at the base of the Observatory began to tremble. The black iron chains wrapped around the pillars tightened inch by inch. These chains, forged from cold iron from the South Sea, were now struggling against the dragon veins in the earth, emitting a grating sound of twisting metal.

"Heaven and earth decree, Primordial Spirit, rise!!"

With the raising of the Taiyi Splitting Light Sword in Guo Lang's hand, the center of the blood clouds began to reveal the shadow of a Primordial Spirit. Clear, visible specks of light instantly appeared in the sky.

Seeing this scene, the Empress's expression suddenly became excited. She opened her hands, guiding a particle of spiritual light into her body, and a look of extreme enjoyment immediately appeared on her face.

As if she had eaten a spiritual pill, the wrinkled, crane-white face of the Empress began to slowly smooth out, her white hair turning back to black.

At this moment, a dragon's roar suddenly came from deep within the earth's veins.

Guo Lang's whole body shook violently, and blood flowed from his seven orifices. He sensed the nine dragon veins suppressed beneath Yujing struggling frantically.

The bronze blood jars exploded one after another. The先天 Eight Trigrams diagram formed by the blood plasma in the air showed cracks.

Far away in Jiannan Dao, within the Purple Cloud Palace on Qingwei Mountain, Yuhuan State, Xuanxiao True Person suddenly opened his eyes. The Nine Heavens Thunder Sound Sword hanging in front of the hall automatically unsheathed three inches. The purple lightning entangling the sword illuminated his solemn face.

This number one expert of Jiannan Dao now had a grave expression. He could clearly feel the vibration of the earth's veins coming from the direction of Yujing tens of thousands of miles away.

"Trading ten million lives for a sliver of heavenly opportunity..."

The hand gripping the sword hilt bulged with blue veins, but in the end, he did not strike out the sword Qi that would sever the blood clouds.

Under his bronze-colored skin, mercury blood surged like rivers in his silver marrow—this was the sign of the complete mastery of the Mercury Blood Silver Marrow technique. Purple lightning also coiled around his fingertips in wisps.

"Master, should we activate the Mountain Guarding Sword Array?"

The chief disciple standing to the side looked at the sword-testing stone inside the hall, which was beginning to crack.

Xuanxiao True Person remained silent for a long while, finally shaking his head. "Pass the order to the disciples of the thirty-six peaks: seal the mountain gates, not a single step down the mountain. Those who violate the order will be treated as traitors to the sect!"

In Yanbei Dao, in the northern part of Youzhou, within the eight hundred li of desolate, icy plains connected to Ningguta, at the bottom of a cold pond in a certain mountain hollow thirty zhang deep, a sword tomb made of thousand-year-old玄 ice suddenly trembled.

The solitary figure sleeping in the ice coffin, Du Gu Jiu, suddenly opened his eyes. The sword Qi flowing in his pupils cut spider-web-like cracks into the ice coffin. This supreme grandmaster, known as the "Heavenly Sword" two hundred years ago, now had green sword Qi seeping from the pores all over his body, shattering the ice soul cold marrow that preserved his lifespan inch by inch.

*Crack!*

The moment the ice coffin shattered, the entire cold pond boiled like it was being cooked.

The instant Du Gu Jiu broke through the ice, the remnants of swords deposited at the bottom of the pond for a hundred years trembled simultaneously. Broken blade fragments converged in the pond water to form nine sword Qi vortices that swam like dragons.

His gray-white long hair turned black, root by root, amidst the surging sword Qi, and his wrinkled face restored its luster at a speed visible to the naked eye.

"Blood煞 soars to the sky... The appearance of the Xuanhuang weeping blood... Blood sacrifice to summon the Primordial Spirit..."

Du Gu Jiu revealed a hint of anger. He had used the turtle breathing technique to put himself into a deep sleep, striving to survive until the moment the Primordial Spirit of heaven and earth rose again, but he was now awakened by this man-made Primordial Spirit aura.

He wanted to fall back into slumber...

A cold look crossed Du Gu Jiu's face.

He pointed his fingers like a sword and slashed through the pond water. The green light bursting from his fingertips split the hundred-zhang cold pond in two, and a wisp of green light leaped over the horizon and vanished in an instant.

This supreme sword master, who was unrivaled in the martial world with his "Nine Breaths Sword Qi," had somehow managed to see the reflection of the blood sacrifice in Yujing on the cliff wall at the bottom of the pond.

*Boom!*

The seven sword peaks surrounding the cold pond collapsed simultaneously.

Du Gu Jiu rushed into the sky, stepping on the falling rubble. With every step he took, a three-foot sword seal formed in the void. When he leaped out of the pond surface, his tattered blue robe had already been mended by sword Qi.

Standing in the air, Du Gu Jiu pointed his fingers like a sword and made a虚划 towards the southeast. A tearing sound immediately echoed through the forest.

"Two hundred years of slumber, and I still couldn't avoid man-made disaster. You old Taoist, your calculations are quite accurate!"

Du Gu Jiu stroked the hiltless ancient sword at his waist. The copper rust on the scabbard surface fell away in cascades. When he pushed the sword guard open half an inch with his thumb, the accumulated snow within a five-mile radius suddenly悬浮 in mid-air, each snowflake reflecting a cold, sharp sword light.

Du Gu Jiu tapped the surface of the cold pond with the tip of his foot and transformed into a streak of green light, piercing into the sea of clouds.

Wherever he passed, the sea of clouds split, actually tearing a long sword scar across the sky.

The thick true qi of a ninth-grade grandmaster surged through his flesh and blood. Every step he took on empty air sent out ring-shaped shockwaves. Woodcutters ten miles away mistook it for an early spring thunder.

Passing through Longxi Dao, Du Gu Jiu suddenly gripped his sword hilt.

Down in the valley, the Blood Flag Guards of the Incense Fire Cult, who were marching, suddenly found the weapons in their hands trembling uncontrollably.

Three thousand steel knives flew into the sky simultaneously, forming a sword wheel behind Du Gu Jiu. The cold light made the setting sun look like blood.

"I shall borrow your blades for a moment."

His voice, carried by sword Qi, pressed down. Three hundred war horses let out mournful cries in unison and fell to their knees.
