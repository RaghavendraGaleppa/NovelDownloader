# Chapter 189: The Mission

Xu Chuan had changed into ordinary robes and altered his appearance to that of a middle-aged man. Li Shiming had also changed his face using a mask artifact given by Xu Chuan—a low-grade item with transformative properties.

As long as they didn't engage in combat, their disguises would hold. But once they fought—especially Xu Chuan—his spiritual tools and techniques would undoubtedly attract attention from observant eyes. The influence of the Senluo Sect in the Hundred Thousand Mountains was immense, with nearly every faction acting as their informants.

Thus, Xu Chuan moved cautiously, frequently consulting a jade slip to adjust their route, avoiding various cultivator factions along the way. Li Shiming was curious about the contents of that jade slip—it likely contained intelligence on the Hundred Thousand Mountains recorded by the Shushan Sect.

After more than ten days of covert travel, Xu Chuan finally halted. "Brother Li, ahead lies the territory of spirit beasts. We can no longer fly—we must proceed on foot," he warned.

Li Shiming nodded in understanding. For the last thousand li, signs of human habitation—whether mortal or cultivator—had all but disappeared. No one seemed willing to approach this region.

Xu Chuan reverted to his original appearance, donning his sect robes once more. He checked his spiritual tools nervously, clearly tense. "Brother Li, this is the location of the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass. If we get separated and I don't make it... please retrieve the herb and deliver it to the Shushan Sect. This token contains a message for my master."

His voice was heavy with foreboding. Entering the spirit beast territory, he had already prepared for the worst. Over their ten days together, his trust in Li Shiming had grown. As an outsider with no ties to Northern Shu, Li Shiming was the perfect ally—someone who could be relied upon if properly incentivized.

Finding trustworthy companions was rare for cultivators, and Xu Chuan considered himself fortunate.

"Brother Xu, as long as the Sunward Three-Leaf Grass remains, I will deliver it to the Shushan Sect no matter what," Li Shiming vowed solemnly.

During their journey, he had learned that the herb was needed by Xu Chuan's master, who had been severely injured in a battle against a Golden Core demonic cultivator. While the physical wounds had healed, the lingering yin-poison energy from the demonic techniques proved difficult to purge.

Coincidentally, the Shushan Sect's stock of Three-Yang Revival Pills—the only known remedy—had been exhausted, claimed by other disciples. Without the main ingredient, Sunward Three-Leaf Grass, which grew only in the Hundred Thousand Mountains, even offering triple the usual price through the Northern Shu Trading House couldn't guarantee its availability in recent years.

Though valuable, the herb had never been this scarce before. Xu Chuan suspected internal power struggles within the sect—had his grandmaster not been in seclusion, his master's condition would never have been neglected. Desperate, he had ventured into the Hundred Thousand Mountains alone, hoping to find the herb his master had once discovered. If it was gone, he would continue searching—a detail he hadn't shared with Li Shiming.

Meanwhile, at Senluo Sect's Zhaoyun Peak, Li Yuanba didn't linger long. He selected three combat missions and departed. All three targets were located near where Li Shiming and Xu Chuan currently were—this was his backup plan.

Though Li Yuanba lacked a talisman treasure, his combat prowess surpassed Li Shiming's, for Jiang Chen—the strongest asset between both bodies—was under his control. At the peak of late Foundation Establishment and even brushing against Golden Core-level power, Jiang Chen was nearly invincible below the Golden Core realm.

While talisman treasures were the most potent weapons ordinary cultivators could wield against Foundation Establishment opponents, Jiang Chen was essentially an inexhaustible talisman treasure. That was why Li Shiming hadn't allocated any talisman treasures to Li Yuanba.

Li Yuanba summoned his jade flying boat, its Senluo Sect insignia prominently displayed as it streaked across the sky. The mark ensured safe passage—no rogue factions dared intercept him, a privilege of belonging to a powerful sect.

The journey that had taken Li Shiming and Xu Chuan days was covered by Li Yuanba in just four. Checking his missions, he found himself near the Golden Crow Mountains. His three targets were all early Foundation Establishment cultivators operating independently in the area.

These three had sealed their fate by attacking a Senluo Sect gathering team. Though they hadn't killed anyone, they had stolen all the spiritual materials. The team—comprising one Foundation Establishment cultivator and a dozen Qi Refinement disciples—was merely a peripheral asset among many such teams harvesting common resources in the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

Perhaps the trio had assumed that proximity to the spirit beast territory and the Senluo Sect's ongoing unification efforts would make their transgression insignificant. They underestimated the sect's resolve against provocateurs. Three elimination missions were issued simultaneously, which Li Yuanba had conveniently accepted in one batch—a favorite among outer sect combat division disciples for efficiency.

Upon arriving at the first cave dwelling, Li Yuanba found it abandoned. "They fled?" He hurried to the second location, where the protective formation was still active—indicating the target was present.

"Zhang Tiande, your crimes have caught up with you. Come out and face judgment!" Li Yuanba's voice rang out sharply.

Inside, Zhang Tiande wasn't alone. Four other Foundation Establishment cultivators were present, including a late-stage elder. "Senior, you must save us!" Zhang Tiande pleaded with the elder, while the other two early-stage accomplices bowed deeply.

They hadn't realized their victims were from the Senluo Sect until it was too late. By then, unwilling to relinquish the stolen goods and with the team's leader escaping before they could silence witnesses, they had no choice but to seek help from Mao Bin, the late Foundation Establishment powerhouse of Golden Crow Mountains.

To their surprise, Mao Bin agreed to intervene, bringing along a mid-stage ally. "I'll honor my word, but afterward, you must join us without betrayal," Mao Bin said, sensing Li Yuanba's cultivation level outside with a faint smile.

The Hundred Thousand Mountains, though Senluo Sect territory, still harbored resistance—mostly remnants of annihilated sects and sworn enemies. Had Li Yuanba not arrived, these three would have soon joined their ranks as fugitives.

"Let's eliminate this Senluo Sect disciple together!" Mao Bin declared, leading the group outside.

Li Yuanba retreated as a powerful aura erupted from the cave. Five Foundation Establishment cultivators emerged, with Mao Bin's late-stage pressure bearing down on him. The gap between stages was significant—early Foundation Establishment cultivators would find their movements sluggish under such suppression.

"Senluo Sect business. You dare defy us? Do you seek soul annihilation?" Li Yuanba demanded, surprised that resistance still existed in Northern Shu's Hundred Thousand Mountains.

"The Senluo Sect is mighty, but this is Golden Crow Mountains—my domain. Nine of your sect's Foundation Establishment disciples have fallen by my hand. You'll be the tenth!" Mao Bin laughed.

Golden Crow Mountains' proximity to spirit beast territory deterred Golden Core cultivators, whose presence might provoke the beasts. This allowed Mao Bin, as a late Foundation Establishment expert, to operate freely—while Senluo Sect might send stronger fighters, killing him was nearly impossible without Golden Core intervention.

"Wait, Mao Bin... let me check." The name sounded familiar. Retrieving his identity jade slip, Li Yuanba found Mao Bin listed in the outer sect's bounty missions—a third-tier reward worth 800 contribution points.

"And you must be Ling Bin?" he asked the mid-stage cultivator, his eyes lighting up with recognition.

"Is this masked kid insane?" Ling Bin muttered, bewildered by Li Yuanba's apparent delight at facing overwhelming odds.

"No mistake here. Mao Bin, you're worth 800. Ling Bin, 300. You three—just 50 each," Li Yuanba chuckled.

He wasn't mad. While escaping alone would be feasible, defeating a late-stage opponent seemed impossible—unless one factored in Jiang Chen.

"Careful, this boy's fishy," Mao Bin cautioned.

At that moment, Li Yuanba removed his mask, revealing breathtaking beauty that momentarily stunned even Mao Bin. In that split second of distraction, Jiang Chen materialized as a shadowy blur before Mao Bin.

The elder's defensive spiritual shield activated instinctively—a veteran's reflex. But Jiang Chen's claw strike, imbued with sword intent and monstrous strength, slammed into the shield, sending Mao Bin staggering back. The shield wavered precariously.

Before Mao Bin could reinforce his defenses, Jiang Chen pressed the attack. The elder's only hope lay in life-saving talismans—three high-powered ones, each packing late-stage force. As he triggered them, he finally glimpsed Jiang Chen's true nature.

"A peak iron corpse—nearly silver-grade! How does a mere early Foundation Establishment cultivator possess this?!" Terror gripped Mao Bin. His only thought now was escape.

The three talismans and Ling Bin's flying axe struck Jiang Chen simultaneously with a deafening explosion. Yet the undead stood unfazed, its advance unbroken.
