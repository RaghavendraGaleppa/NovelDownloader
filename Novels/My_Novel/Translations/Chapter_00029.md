# Chapter 29: C-Rank Guard, Purchasing Pills

After a moment of surprise, Pang Long thought to himself:

"This kid practices martial arts alone, with no one to guide him, relying entirely on his own exploration. He must have made some progress and thinks he has reached Minor Success. Young people often make this mistake, which is normal."

He straightened his expression and said, "For a martial artist, the biggest taboo is to be overly ambitious. Do you know what the标志 of Minor Success in the Four Directions Fist is?"

As he spoke, he spread his legs and took a fist stance. He threw a punch, bringing up a gust of wind. Strangely, his fist锋 pointed to the right, but the fist wind went to the left.

Pang Long intended to give a lesson. He threw four consecutive punches: one struck east, the wind went west; one struck south, the wind went east; one struck north, the wind went south; one struck west, the wind also went west.

The purpose of the demonstration was to show that a punch has fist intent. The标志 of Minor Success in the Four Directions Fist is the separation of fist intent from the fist path, achieving the effect of surprise and being undefendable.

It seemed ordinary, but in reality, it required immense hard work and great insight to achieve.

"Can you see the trick?"

"This! This is true Minor Success!"

"Even I, Pang Long, learning this fist technique, spent a full year before..."

Pang Long was speaking when he suddenly saw Li Xian take a fist stance and throw a punch towards the east, but the fist wind came from the west.

Although Li Xian's fist momentum was not as good as Pang Long's.

The difference, however, was not in the fist technique, but in the vast difference in their internal energy.

Li Xian threw four more punches, striking east, west, south, and north respectively, recreating Pang Long's scene. He said, "I know. The标志 of Minor Success in the Four Directions Fist is understanding the Four Directions Fist Intent."

After finishing the fist routine, Li Xian retracted his energy and withdrew it inward. Remembering that Pang Long hadn't finished his sentence earlier, he asked, "Commander Pang, please continue."

"Ahem... Ahem..."

Pang Long quickly turned his back, supporting his jaw. His rough facial features couldn't hide his look of shame.

He had spoken too soon...

It was truly awkward. He wiped a handful of sweat and thought to himself:

"As a commander, if this kid finds out that it took me a year to barely achieve Minor Success, while he achieved such proficiency in less than a month, wouldn't that... make me lose all face?"

Pang Long said seriously, "Not bad, not bad. In that case, you have indeed achieved Minor Success. The guard competition... you may participate."

"Thank you, Commander!" Li Xian was overjoyed.

"However, although you have achieved Minor Success, do not be arrogant," Pang Long said. "You have some martial talent, which is good. But there is one thing about martial world experience that I need to teach you in advance."

Li Xian listened attentively.

"We martial artists seek to wash away the mud body and be reborn. The great taboo in the martial path is... excessive measurement."

"Excessive measurement?" Li Xian pondered the meaning.

Pang Long nodded. "It means turning martial arts, realm, and experience into a ruler's length to measure and compare. Treating it as everything."

"For example, you have achieved Minor Success in the Four Directions Fist. If you face an opponent who has just入门 (entered the door) in the Four Directions Fist. You know in your heart that the opponent's fist technique is inferior to yours. After secretly measuring the lengths, you naturally develop a sense of contempt."

"In most cases, this is indeed true. But you must know that a martial artist's battle is a matter of changing in an instant. The true outcome of victory or defeat is unpredictable to anyone."

Li Xian understood, grasping the meaning behind Pang Long's words.

"There are still four days until the guard competition."

"Prepare yourself. I'm telling you, this time's opponents are not weak at all."

"Even with Minor Success in the fist technique... you might not necessarily be able to defeat them."

Pang Long said with great interest.

"Commander Pang, can you give me a hint in advance?" Li Xian said with a grin.

Pang Long said, "This isn't some great secret, so it's fine to tell you. Besides, I've heard... your relationships with the other guards are rather average. If I don't tell you, probably no one else will."

When Li Xian heard "relationships are average," he didn't care at all.

"In this world, martial arts are precious. Generally speaking, a D-Rank Guard, after a full year of diligent work and mastering a martial art, can then claim the next martial art."

"Each time a guard is promoted, they can also claim an additional basic martial art."

"The more martial arts one masters, not to mention anything else, just a single type of劲力 (intent/force) becomes much stronger."

"This time for the C-Rank Guard position, there are three slots. But your opponents include seven who are very formidable."

Pang Long's "very formidable" was relative to Li Xian.

Li Xian asked, "Who are they?"

"I won't say their names. You'll find out on the day of the competition," Pang Long said.

"Of these seven, four have been guards for six years and have mastered six martial arts."

"Two were demoted from C-Rank Guard, so their strength goes without saying. They are roughly on par with the first four."

"There's one more. Although he's only been a guard for five years and his martial arts foundation is slightly weaker, he has trained a body-strengthening martial art to an excellent level, which cannot be underestimated."

Hearing this, Li Xian felt it was quite a棘手 (thorny/hard to deal with) situation. However, a martial artist striving for higher realms would never fear a strong enemy!

He had no fear in his heart, and would never retreat!

From Pang Long, he learned that if he wanted to purchase pills, he could go to the "Leisure Pill Pavilion" to buy them himself.

Both the "Leisure Martial Pavilion" and the "Leisure Pill Pavilion" have the character "Leisure" (Xian).

It implies that these were done by the Madam in her leisure time. The "Leisure Martial Pavilion" contains martial arts that the Madam created in her spare time, or martial arts that were useless to her.

The "Leisure" in "Leisure Pill Pavilion" refers to the various idle pills the Madam refined while practicing her pill-refining skills in her leisure time. Since they were useless to her, she simply put them into the estate's operations.

Next to the Leisure Pill Pavilion.

There was a pavilion under construction, called the "Refining Pill Pavilion."

Li Xian heard that the Madam had three Refining Pill Pavilions, named "Spring Pavilion," "Autumn Pavilion," and "Winter Pavilion," corresponding to pill refining in different seasons.

Pill refining... is a mysterious art, emphasizing the right time, place, and conditions. The climate and Feng Shui are different in spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

There was originally a "Summer Pavilion."

It was said that the Madam failed in refining a pill, causing a great fire that burned it to ashes. It was only in winter that she suddenly remembered and sent people to repair it.

"Manager Luo, we meet again."

Li Xian greeted him.

"It's you!" Luo Fang asked warily, "What are you doing here?"

"Buying pills," Li Xian turned and walked into the Leisure Pill Pavilion.

"Good kid... he's getting more and more impressive!" Luo Fang felt a great sense of crisis. It had only been a few days since they last parted, but this kid's spirit and energy are now full, and he's becoming increasingly formidable.

"Useless thing!"

Thinking of his nephew still lying on the bed, Luo Fang cursed loudly, "Once you recover, you won't even be fit to hold shoes for him, let alone get revenge!"

One wrong step leads to endless errors.

Speaking of which, inside the Leisure Pill Pavilion, the fragrance of pills filled the air.

"A D-Rank Guard?"

The Leisure Pill Pavilion had over ten attendants in total, mainly responsible for cleaning, arranging, receiving guests, and keeping accounts.

Although they were also subordinates, their status was not that of mere servants.

The one speaking was the "Left Pavilion Manager," Xiao Qing. She used to be a laundry maid, flattered the Madam's personal maid Qiuyue, and was arranged to work in the Leisure Pill Pavilion, serving as a half-manager.

She got down from her chair and walked towards Li Xian, her gaze sweeping up and down, finally stopping on his face.

"A good-looking face," Xiao Qing's thoughts flashed.

"I'm here to buy pills," Li Xian said truthfully.

"A D-Rank Guard... your access to pills is limited, and there are no discounts. The cheapest pill costs five hundred copper coins. Do you have enough money?" Xiao Qing said淡淡 (calmly/lightly).

Seeing Li Xian nod, Xiao Qing waved her hand. "Follow me."
