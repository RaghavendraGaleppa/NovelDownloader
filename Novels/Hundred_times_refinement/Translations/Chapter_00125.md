# Chapter 75: Knockoff High-Grade Talismans

"So many?" Lin Xuan was momentarily stunned, his face showing surprise. But upon closer inspection, he nearly laughed in exasperation. While these were indeed defensive talismans before him...

Bubble Spell, Wind Wall Technique, Flame Shield, Wood Spirit Art...

They were uniformly low-grade—no, these were entry-level defensive spells. What use did he have for such trash?

"Ahem." Lin Xuan's expression turned slightly awkward. "I was referring to mid-grade defensive talismans."

"Mid-grade?" The young man scrutinized Lin Xuan carefully. "We have them, but they're expensive."

"Let me see them first."

The youth pulled out three more talismans from his storage pouch, presenting them proudly. "These were personally crafted by my master—genuine mid-grade defensive talismans."

Lin Xuan examined them. They were indeed good: Diamond Body Technique, Water Spirit Shield, Earth Wall Technique—exactly what he needed. "How much?"

"Nine low-grade spirit stones each."

Lin Xuan mentally calculated. While mid-grade talismans were expensive, and defensive ones far rarer than offensive ones, this price was still a bit steep.

After some haggling, they settled on seven stones per talisman.

Handing over twenty-one stones, Lin Xuan tucked the three talismans into his robe with a pang of regret. Still, with these defensive talismans, his safety during the upcoming journey would be significantly improved.

He continued browsing, searching for any other useful talismans. The expedition to Streamleap Gorge would be fraught with danger, but Lin Xuan wouldn't hesitate to spend his spirit stones if he found something suitable.

However, his luck didn't hold. Most of what he saw were low-grade talismans. While there were some mid-grade ones, they were all offensive in nature. As for high-grade talismans—Lin Xuan hadn't seen a single one yet. The Elder Tianyuan that Wang Xin had mentioned didn't seem to have appeared at today's talisman gathering.

"Talismans for sale! Talismans for sale!"

A loud hawking voice reached his ears, drawing curious glances from nearby cultivators. While the scene somewhat resembled a mundane marketplace, both vendors and customers were cultivators—who would shout their wares like common peddlers? At most, they might offer a quiet introduction when buyers approached. This loud promotion stood out starkly.

"Which ill-mannered brat..." Before the cultivators could finish their thoughts, the next sentence completely captured their attention: "Come quick! These are low-grade talismans that rival high-grade ones!"

"What? Low-grade talismans comparable to high-grade ones?"

Not just the other cultivators, even Lin Xuan was visibly startled. Low-grade talismans only contained entry-level spells, while high-grade ones held advanced spells usable only by Foundation Establishment cultivators. The difference in power was like night and day.

Instantly, the crowd surged forward, Lin Xuan blending into the flow and pushing his way to the front.

The vendor wore the attire of the Talisman Mountain Sect, appearing no more than seventeen or eighteen years old, with a clever and sly expression, a smirk playing at his lips.

Some cast Spirit Eye techniques to assess his cultivation level, which he ignored—third layer, just having entered the mid-stage of the Spirit Movement realm.

"I'm Liu Jing, selling talismans here. Those with money, support me financially; those without, support me with your presence..."

The cultivators exchanged bewildered glances, expressions full of disbelief. Someone muttered under their breath, "Is this kid a cultivator or a street performer?"

"What talismans are you selling?"

"Yeah, how can low-grade talismans compare to high-grade ones?"

...

Liu Jing's face brimmed with smugness. "My low-grade talismans are special."

"Stop playing coy and explain," urged an impatient cultivator.

"Take this Ice Pellet Spell, for example." Liu Jing pulled out a talisman.

"What's so special about the Ice Pellet Spell? It's an entry-level technique," scoffed a tall, lean man to his left.

"Is that so?"

A glint of mischief flashed in Liu Jing's eyes as he tossed the talisman toward the speaker and shouted, "Activate!"

At first, the lean man was unimpressed—just a minor Ice Pellet Spell. But the next moment, his face paled. The talisman exploded mid-air, releasing a terrifying wave of cold. A dazzling array of icy needles shot toward him.

Not just him—every nearby cultivator was terrified out of their wits. This was no entry-level Ice Pellet Spell. It was the formidable Ice Needle Technique, and at its peak at that. There had to be at least five hundred needles flying toward them.

The suddenness of the attack left no time to react. Even if these cultivators were in the Spirit Movement stage, facing so many ice needles at such close range would be fatal even for a Foundation Establishment expert.

The lean man's face turned ashen. Knowing it was futile but clinging to survival instinct, he screamed and conjured a spiritual shield before him.

Yet this was a desperate last stand—how could a flimsy shield block such a powerful barrage?

"Pfft!"

The needles struck. The man closed his eyes, awaiting death. But unexpectedly, the hundreds of needles vanished like mud into the sea, leaving not a ripple.

"What just happened?" The onlookers, including the narrowly escaped lean man, were dumbfounded. Lin Xuan, however, smiled faintly and turned his gaze to the smug vendor.

"No need for alarm, everyone," Liu Jing said calmly. "As I mentioned earlier, this was just the Ice Pellet Spell—an entry-level technique, incapable of breaking through this elder brother's defense."

"But what we saw was the Ice Needle Technique!"

"Exactly! What's going on?"

...

"This," Liu Jing declared triumphantly, "is precisely what I meant by low-grade talismans rivaling high-grade ones. While their actual power remains that of low-grade spells, their visual and auditory effects mimic high-grade techniques. For instance, the Ice Pellet Spell can be mistaken for the Ice Needle Technique, this Fireball Spell for Blazing Divine Flames, and this Rolling Stonefall for Heaven's Judgment Boulder..." He pulled out various talismans as he spoke.
