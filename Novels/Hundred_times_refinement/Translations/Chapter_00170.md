# Volume 2: Stolen Immortal Grass  
Chapter 118: Meridian Transformation Pill  

"The female ghost swept away all the waste pills?"  

In the Hundred Herbs Hall, Elder Tongyu's expression darkened as he stroked his beard in silent contemplation. Beside him sat three white-bearded elders, all advanced in age yet radiating vitality. These were the three most influential elders of the Spirit Medicine Mountain, second only to the sect leader. Not only were they masters of alchemy, but their cultivation had also reached the Foundation Establishment stage.  

Though these elders had lived for over a hundred and fifty years and were well-versed in worldly affairs, they exchanged bewildered glances after hearing Lin Xuan and Jin Tao's account.  

Why would a ghost from the underworld come to steal waste pills? It made no sense!  

The sect's defensive formations had not been triggered, and despite searching the entire mountain and its surroundings for dozens of miles, they found no trace of the female ghost the two had described.  

After a long silence, Elder Zhao on the left finally spoke: "Forget it, Sect Leader. Fortunately, that ghost only took some worthless waste pills. Our sect hasn't suffered any real loss. There's no need to exhaust ourselves investigating this matter. Our priority now should be strengthening the defenses in key areas."  

Elder Tongyu exchanged glances with the other two elders and nodded in agreement.  

---  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan left the Hundred Herbs Hall and slowly made his way back to his cave dwelling. His face betrayed no emotion, but inwardly, he was exhilarated. Obtaining the waste pills had been far easier than he had anticipated.  

Though he and Yue'er had staged an elaborate act to divert suspicion, the theft of hundreds of thousands of Foundation Establishment waste pills was no small matter. Lin Xuan had prepared for all sorts of repercussions, yet he had gotten off scot-free.  

Perhaps the sect was simply too wealthy to care about the negligible value of waste pills, or perhaps the alchemists of Spirit Medicine Mountain were inherently indifferent. In any case, they had decided not to pursue the matter further.  

As Elder Zhao had suggested, the only follow-up action was reinforcing the defenses in critical areas with additional powerful formations.  

Of course, none of this concerned Lin Xuan.  

He now had enough waste pills to sustain his cultivation.  

Advancing through the Foundation Establishment stages would undoubtedly be far more difficult than the Qi Condensation realm, and relying solely on these two types of pills might not suffice. Still, at least for the first four layers of cultivation, he should have no major issues.  

Lost in thought, Lin Xuan soon arrived at his cave dwelling.  

Once inside, he headed straight to the cultivation chamber.  

With a flick of his wrist, a small white bottle appeared in his palm. He uncorked it, took out a waste pill, and began purifying it.  

---  

Compared to the Marrow Cleansing Pills, purifying Foundation Establishment Pills was far more challenging. Lin Xuan had learned this the hard way with the bottle he had acquired at the Treasure Hunt Auction—out of a hundred pills, he had only managed to purify a dozen or so.  

Fortunately, he now had an ample supply of waste pills. Even with a lower success rate, it didn’t matter.  

A month passed in the blink of an eye.  

Lin Xuan sat cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by over a dozen bottles filled with crimson pills—the purified Foundation Establishment Pills.  

After thirty days of relentless effort, he had successfully purified over a thousand pills.  

Yet Lin Xuan’s mood was far from jubilant. He held an ancient tome in his hands, and after reading through it, he sighed heavily.  

Unlike the Marrow Cleansing Pills, consuming Foundation Establishment Pills came with additional complications.  

Too much of a good thing could be harmful. Even elixirs crafted from heavenly treasures had their limits. According to the records, one could only consume three Foundation Establishment Pills per day.  

Exceeding this limit would leave excess medicinal energy unabsorbed, lingering in the body and causing harm rather than benefit.  

Three pills a day was an unimaginable luxury for ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators—such pills were incredibly precious, and most would be overjoyed to obtain one every couple of months.  

But for Lin Xuan, whose aptitude was abysmal, progressing through the Foundation Establishment stages was already an uphill battle. Three pills a day were a mere drop in the bucket, and his cultivation speed remained frustratingly slow.  

This left him deeply frustrated.  

Especially now that he had an abundance of pills but couldn’t consume them freely due to absorption limitations.  

Was there a solution?  

Lin Xuan naturally couldn’t ask his master. Confessing to Elder Tongyu would be tantamount to admitting his involvement in the waste pill theft. Worse still, it might even expose the secret of his blue star sea.  

He wasn’t about to take such a risk. Instead, he decided to research the matter himself.  

As a disciple of Spirit Medicine Mountain, Lin Xuan had unrestricted access to the sect’s library and could borrow any book he wished.  

While the sect might not compare to Floating Cloud Valley in terms of cultivation techniques or artifact forging, when it came to alchemical knowledge, Spirit Medicine Mountain was unrivaled—not just in Yanzhou, but across the entire Youzhou region.  

The library contained exhaustive records on every aspect of alchemy—ingredients, refining methods, medicinal properties, origins, and even precautions for consumption.  

After spending an entire day poring over the texts, Lin Xuan finally found what he was looking for.  

He set down the ancient tome, deep in thought.  

---  

According to the records, it was indeed possible to increase the daily intake of Foundation Establishment Pills.  

The three-pill limit existed because excess medicinal energy couldn’t be absorbed by the meridians, leading to harmful residue.  

However, the book mentioned a solution: a pill called the "Meridian Transformation Pill."  

As the name suggested, this pill could strengthen the meridians, allowing them to absorb more medicinal energy. With its aid, one could safely consume up to fifteen Foundation Establishment Pills per day.  

Fifteen pills—for someone like Lin Xuan, who lacked spiritual roots and relied entirely on pills for cultivation—meant a fivefold increase in progress.  

Moreover, when attempting to break through bottlenecks, the ability to consume more pills would significantly improve his chances of success.  

The benefits were undeniable.  

Lin Xuan had no reason to hesitate.  

But when he examined the ingredients for the Meridian Transformation Pill, his excitement turned to dismay.  

Most of the ingredients were common and easily obtainable, but the catalyst required was absurdly rare—the Seven-Star Grass.  

This was an incredibly precious immortal herb. Most cultivators had never even heard of it. It was only through his time at Spirit Medicine Mountain that Lin Xuan had come across its name.  

In the cultivation world, herbs were categorized into several tiers:  

- Common herbs (e.g., ginseng, lingzhi, and snow lotus under a hundred years old, readily available in markets).  
- Rare herbs (occasionally found in the mortal world but typically cultivated by sects, such as red vine grass for Marrow Cleansing Pills or century-old ginseng).  
- Spiritual herbs (rare even for cultivators, obtainable only through great fortune, like the glowgrass and silvermoon grass used in Foundation Establishment Pills, or thousand-year-old ginseng and lingzhi).  
- Immortal herbs (even rarer than spiritual herbs, as the name implied).  

The Meridian Transformation Pill was merely an auxiliary elixir, not particularly remarkable in itself. Yet it required an immortal herb as a catalyst—which explained the footnote in the ancient text:  

*"Aside from ancient cultivators, no one has successfully refined this pill in the past thousand years."*  

But Lin Xuan had no choice. If he stuck to three Foundation Establishment Pills a day, his progress would be painfully slow. At that rate, he might never reach the Core Formation stage before his lifespan ran out.  

---  

The problem was, Lin Xuan had no idea where to find Seven-Star Grass.  

He could only continue cultivating while discreetly gathering information within the sect.  

Though Spirit Medicine Mountain’s alchemists were mediocre in combat, their knowledge of herbs was unparalleled. Through careful probing, Lin Xuan learned from Elder Zhao that the Green Cloud Mountain sect possessed a single stalk of Seven-Star Grass—their prized treasure.  

Lin Xuan maintained a calm facade but returned to his cave dwelling in distress.  

Green Cloud Mountain was no minor sect. It was one of the three major powers of Youzhou, far surpassing both Spirit Medicine Mountain and Floating Cloud Valley in strength.  

With over ten thousand disciples—ranging from Qi Condensation to Foundation Establishment—and dozens of Core Formation experts, it was a behemoth.  

Rumors even claimed the sect harbored a Nascent Soul cultivator—a centuries-old monster whose power was unfathomable.  

Whether true or not, such rumors didn’t arise from nothing.  

A sect of this magnitude could effortlessly sweep through all of Yanzhou with just a fraction of its strength.  

The Seven-Star Grass was their treasured possession. There was no chance they would sell it—and even if they did, the price would be astronomical, far beyond Lin Xuan’s means.  

Steal it?  

The mere thought sent chills down his spine.  

Yet the Meridian Transformation Pill was something he absolutely needed.  

What could he do?
