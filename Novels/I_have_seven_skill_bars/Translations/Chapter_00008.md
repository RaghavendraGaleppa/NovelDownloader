# Chapter 8: Overnight, He Becomes Brother Rui

On normal days, Spirit Field No. 377 always had visitors. Almost all of them sought Liu Yun's help with rain spells. Ding Rui understood this perfectly. After all, cultivators weren't machines; there were always one or two days in a period when issues would arise. Of course, even machines broke down sometimes. And when the rain spell casters in other spirit fields encountered problems, the first person all cultivators thought of was Liu Yun. Such was the power of his reputation! This time was no exception.

After opening the door, a person from Spirit Field No. 112 entered. After smiling and greeting everyone, he walked directly towards Liu Yun. "I'm truly sorry, Senior Brother, but we'll have to trouble you again today!" The man's face was full of smiles. Although asking for help required payment, one's attitude should still be good. Some things couldn't be accomplished with money alone. There weren't many people like Liu Yun who could cast rain spells at will and whose fees weren't exorbitant.

Liu Yun and Ding Rui had already stood up to greet him when the other party approached. At this moment, Liu Yun immediately returned the greeting and asked, "No trouble at all, no trouble at all. How many mu are left today?"

The visitor, who introduced himself as Li Ang, then elaborated on their predicament: not only was their *Rain Dew Art* caster ill, but their spirit rice was also plagued by unusually large aphids. It was then that Liu Yun suggested Ding Rui's unique skill.

"May I ask, this Ding... Brother Rui! Is what Senior Brother said truly real?" As soon as the words left his mouth, Li Ang realized he hadn't spoken correctly. Didn't this imply he didn't trust Liu Yun? He immediately slapped himself and apologized profusely to Liu Yun, "This junior brother has a rotten mouth and spoke poorly, but I truly didn't mean to doubt you, Senior Brother! It's just... it's too unbelievable!"

He then looked at Ding Rui, his expression incredibly complex. "Killing large aphids, that's something only Foundation Establishment cultivators can do!"

"Haha, Brother Li, there's no need to blame yourself. To be honest, when I first heard the news, I couldn't believe it either," Liu Yun said. "However, Ding Rui is only a first-level Qi Condensation cultivator, and now is precisely when he needs cultivation resources."

The cultivator surnamed Li immediately clasped Ding Rui's hand. "Then we absolutely must invite Brother Rui to our Spirit Field No. 112 to take a look and save those spirit rice plants being harmed by the large aphids!"

"As for the remuneration, that's naturally easy to discuss, easy to discuss!"

Although he was paying for help, this cultivator surnamed Li seemed even happier than Ding Rui, who was about to earn money. Liu Yun also smiled, glancing at Ding Rui. Ding Rui cast a grateful look towards him. He could indeed find work himself. But with Liu Yun's introduction and guidance now, he wouldn't be taken advantage of. And he wouldn't have to worry about anything. Just do the work and collect the money!

Including Li Ang, there were eight people assigned to Spirit Field No. 112. Li Ang continued to explain, "Because the cultivator proficient in the *Rain Dew Art* in our Spirit Field No. 112 is somewhat stronger, the sect didn't assign a second one. He alone struggles to cast all the rain spells, which is why we often trouble Senior Brother Liu Yun for help. Today, however, he's fallen ill and is now bedridden, so no rain spells have been cast for the spirit field at all." Li Ang first explained to Ding Rui, then turned to Liu Yun and said, "Perhaps we'll have to trouble you again tonight, Senior Brother."

Liu Yun immediately laughed, "No problem. I'll make another trip tonight after our spirit field rests."

"Many thanks, Senior Brother!"

Li Ang led Liu Yun and Ding Rui to the edge of the spirit field, where the others were still meditating. Given that this was a paid, fair transaction, there was no need for the other cultivators to treat Ding Rui and Liu Yun as important figures; they merely continued their meditation. Liu Yun immediately began casting rain spells, conjuring several strands of water-attributed true essence into a formation, instantly drawing moisture from the surrounding heavens and earth.
