# Chapter 44: I'm Having Such a Hard Time

Indeed, just as Ma Wen said, he and Ding Rui made a huge profit this time.

Just this afternoon alone, Ma Wen ran a distance that would have been difficult to cover in an entire day previously, and earned a full 1200 spirit grains. Ma Wen took half of it and gave it to Ding Rui. No matter how Ding Rui insisted on sticking to their agreement of 1500 grains, Ma Wen insisted on giving him half.

"If you say 1500 grains, then it's 1500 grains. Wouldn't that make me lose face? These spirit grains were earned by my running, so I'll give them however I want. It's settled for today. Tomorrow, we'll go back to 1500 grains. My reputation is already out there; I'll definitely earn more tomorrow!" Ma Wen was very overbearing.

Ding Rui had no choice but to reluctantly accept, saying, "Since this trial was successful, we can move on to the next step. I have another idea; we might as well make it now. You can just take it with you tomorrow morning."

"Of course! What, are we still going to that place from earlier today?" Hearing that Ding Rui had more ideas, Ma Wen immediately became so excited he no longer felt tired.

"Yes, wait for me to go back and get a knife." Ding Rui walked into Spirit Field 377. In the evening, spirit field cultivators were free.

A few days later, after Ding Rui added a retractable, wind-blocking wooden board to the saddle on Ma Wen's back, Ma Wen's popularity reached its peak. The wind-blocking board could be extended or folded away. When folded, it merely created a small protrusion on the saddle, causing no inconvenience. In fact, it allowed passengers to hold onto it, rather than constantly gripping the saddle ropes. When extended, the wind-blocking board would completely block the oncoming wind. Its oval, streamlined design also ensured that the board wouldn't significantly impact Ma Wen's speed.

As a result, female and male cultivators who were more particular about their appearance scrambled to ride Ma Wen. Although the extended board would block the passenger's forward view, they didn't need to navigate. Moreover, without strong winds buffeting them, they could more leisurely and comfortably observe the scenery on both sides of the path. After a ride, their clothes and hair would remain undisturbed, which was particularly favored by female cultivators.

Other types of cultivators were very displeased by this, complaining why Ma Wen didn't consider them more.

However, with this wind-blocking board, Ma Wen's speed had to be slightly reduced. Although Ding Rui had tried his best to find a sufficiently hard wooden board, due to structural issues, the connections were still not robust enough. To prevent the board from breaking in the wind and injuring passengers, Ma Wen could only slow down, running within the board's structural limits. Yet, even at his reduced speed, he was still significantly faster than other horse cultivators!

Noon, more than seven days later.

Ding Rui had just emerged from the entrance of Spirit Field 377 when Ma Wen approached, accompanied by two other horse cultivators Ding Rui hadn't seen before. Ding Rui immediately knew Ma Wen had come to see him about something, and it was certainly business-related. So he first apologized to the cultivators waiting nearby: "My apologies, everyone. I have a slight matter to attend to today, so I might not be able to weed or kill insects for you this noon. Please return for now."

After acknowledging his words, the crowd dispersed, with few raising objections. Almost every cultivator who frequently waited at Spirit Field 377 and had a good relationship with Ding Rui understood one thing. Regarding Ding Rui weeding and pest-killing at ultra-low prices, if Ding Rui was willing to do it, it was a favor; if he wasn't, it was simply his right. There was absolutely no need for them to question or complain.
