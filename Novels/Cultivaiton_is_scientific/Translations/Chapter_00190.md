# Chapter 190: Encounter  

Three high-powered talismans shattered the Jiang Chen's clothing, revealing a black body streaked with silver light.  

Ling Bin's spirit axe struck Jiang Chen's head with a metallic clang, only to rebound, leaving behind a faint white mark that quickly disappeared.  

Neither the talismans nor Ling Bin's axe had any effect on Jiang Chen's movements. With another swipe of his claws, Jiang Chen struck Mao Bin's spirit shield. The shield flickered once before dimming and falling from the air like an ownerless object.  

The spiritual imprint Mao Bin had left on the shield had been forcibly shattered by the immense force and sword intent, leaving him momentarily dazed. This shield had been painstakingly refined by him over a long period, and its destruction dealt a heavier blow to his psyche.  

Jiang Chen was too fast. His third claw strike tore through the body of the late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator as if it were paper. When he retracted his claws, a still-beating heart was clutched in his grasp.  

Mao Bin, a powerful late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, had lasted less than two breaths against Jiang Chen.  

Even among late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, there were vast differences in strength. Mao Bin had only recently entered this stage, while Jiang Chen was at its peak. Moreover, close combat was Jiang Chen's absolute forte.  

Ling Bin, who had been preparing to attack, saw Jiang Chen toss something toward him. When he realized it was a heart, his soul nearly fled his body. He could sense Mao Bin's life force rapidly fading.  

Ling Bin hastily pulled out a talisman, his body glowing with green light as he attempted to flee. But before he could escape, a hand seized his leg. Despite the flashing green light, he couldn't break free.  

Jiang Chen swung Ling Bin like a club, smashing him into the three early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. Using a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator's body as a weapon was something only Jiang Chen could pull off—his formidable defenses rendered Ling Bin's desperate struggles meaningless.  

The three early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators were stunned by the sudden turn of events. Their strongest ally, Mao Bin, had his heart ripped out before their eyes, and their second-strongest, Ling Bin, was now being used as a weapon.  

"Run!" they screamed, scrambling to escape.  

Jiang Chen let out a roar, and the sheer pressure of his cultivation froze them in place. Then, Ling Bin's body came crashing down.  

One of the early-stage cultivators was struck, his body shattering on impact. Ling Bin didn't fare much better—his bones fractured from the force.  

"Don't damage the heads!" Li Yuanba reminded quickly.  

These were all contribution points. If the heads were too badly damaged, it would be hard to claim the rewards.  

He also sent out a sword beam to help Jiang Chen finish the fight faster.  

At his command, Jiang Chen switched to a sweeping motion. Ling Bin's body collided with the second early-stage cultivator, who was sent flying with a broken spine, lifeless before he hit the ground.  

The last cultivator, Zhang Tiande, felt a chill in his chest as a sword beam pierced through him. Sword intent and razor-sharp spiritual energy ravaged his body, extinguishing his life in moments.  

What had seemed like an uneven battle had completely reversed the moment Jiang Chen appeared.  

This was the power of a refined corpse—a favored weapon of demonic cultivators.  

After the battle, Jiang Chen licked the blood from his claws, his eyes growing darker with bloodlust.  

Li Yuanba sensed Jiang Chen's emotions but didn't stop him. Bloodlust was intrinsic to refined corpses.  

He collected the heads of the five cultivators and took their storage pouches, briefly inspecting them before hanging them at his waist.  

Given his standards, the techniques and artifacts of these rogue cultivators held little appeal. However, he did find a peculiar token inscribed with the characters "Tai Chu." What caught his attention was the anti-counterfeiting technique used—something only major sects employed.  

From what he knew of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, there was no sect called Tai Chu.  

He set the token aside to investigate later.  

By the time he finished, Jiang Chen had drunk his fill of blood. Among the five corpses, only Mao Bin's had been of interest to him.  

Li Yuanba stored Jiang Chen away. If he couldn't even tolerate his refined corpse drinking the blood of enemies, why had he joined the demonic sect in the first place?  

As long as he didn't actively commit atrocities, he could remain true to himself, even within the demonic sect.  

After checking his bearings, he transformed into a streak of sword light and shot into the distance.  

---  

Li Shiming finally encountered spirit beasts—not just one, but an entire troop.  

While traveling through the mountains with Xu Chuan, they stumbled upon a group of spirit monkeys emerging from the opposite slope.  

The two parties locked eyes, neither expecting the encounter.  

Li Shiming focused on the spirit monkey king—a snow-white creature exuding the aura of a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Beside it stood four white monkeys at the early Foundation Establishment stage.  

"Brother Li, we need to finish this quickly. No delays!" Xu Chuan whispered urgently.  

They were now deep in spirit beast territory. Fleeing wasn't an option—if they exposed their presence while running, who knew what other beasts they might attract?  

Li Shiming nodded in understanding. With a wave of his hand, nine flying swords shot out, enveloping the monkey king and the four white monkeys.  

The other monkeys were inconsequential. Their claws likely couldn't even pierce his defenses.  

Xu Chuan also launched his flying sword. Since they hadn't fought together before, he wanted to observe Li Shiming's combat style.  

Given the battles ahead—especially the powerful beast guarding the Three-Leaf Sun Grass—it was best to familiarize themselves with each other's strengths now.  

The monkey king and the four white monkeys shrieked, conjuring ice in their claws and hurling it at Xu Chuan's sword.  

Li Shiming's nine swords, having not attacked immediately, were ignored.  

Though spirit beasts were no less intelligent than humans, they lacked the accumulated knowledge that enhanced human wisdom.  

Xu Chuan's sword was incredibly agile. Holding nothing back, he wanted to demonstrate his prowess to Li Shiming—perhaps to impress him for future cooperation.  

The sword dodged the five ice attacks, though frost formed on its surface. Undeterred, it shot toward the monkey king, who somersaulted and slashed at it with its claws.  

Spirit beasts rarely used weapons—their natural weapons were often as deadly as any artifact.  

The clash of claws against sword produced a series of metallic rings. When the sword withdrew, a shallow cut marred the monkey king's hide.  

"Brother Li, be careful. This monkey king's defenses are strong!" Xu Chuan warned, unimpressed by his minor success.  

The wound was superficial—the monkey king's physique was formidable, and the sword had barely pierced its skin.  

Enraged, the monkey king let out a piercing screech, and the entire troop charged.  

The cacophony of shrieks rattled their minds, but both men were unfazed.  

"Activate!" Li Shiming commanded.  

Countless arcs of lightning erupted from the Nine Palaces Sword Formation. Though weak individually, they devastated the weaker monkeys, felling them like wheat.  

The monkey king and the four white monkeys lunged forward, conjuring larger ice projectiles.  

Li Shiming smirked. He loved fighting enemies with low intelligence.  

The second function of the Nine Palaces Sword Formation activated.  

Suddenly, the monkeys found themselves in a surreal landscape of thunder and lightning.  

Though the attacks were too weak to seriously harm them, the relentless shocks were maddening.  

The monkeys thrashed wildly, unable to escape the illusory prison.  

"Is this really a formation master?" Xu Chuan muttered in disbelief.  

Formation masters weren't combat specialists. Setting up formations took time—even the fastest deployment required precious seconds.  

But Li Shiming had instantly woven a battlefield formation with nine swords, trapping and harassing the enemy.  

Unaware of Xu Chuan's thoughts, Li Shiming gathered his limited lightning spiritual energy.  

A "Thunderstrike" spell sigil glowed before him.  

"Go!" He aimed at one of the white monkeys, avoiding the tougher monkey king.  

"Brother Xu, I'll handle the early-stage monkeys. The king is yours!"  

"Understood!" Xu Chuan felt like a true ranged fighter for once—free to attack without worrying about retaliation.  

He was also surprised to learn Li Shiming was a lightning cultivator.  

Why choose lightning when he had sword intent? Most would opt for the path of a sword cultivator—unmatched offense, unparalleled freedom.  

As he pondered, a faint golden arc flickered amid the lightning engulfing one white monkey.  

The monkey stiffened as the golden lightning—Li Shiming's true power—ravaged its body.  

Spirit beasts had strong physical and elemental defenses, but lightning was their bane.  

The monkey's life force waned rapidly.  

While Li Shiming prepared a second Thunderstrike, Xu Chuan unleashed his own attack.  

His sword moved slowly, as if bearing the weight of a mountain.  

Li Shiming's eyes narrowed at the terrifying aura within the blade—this was a secret technique.  

He had never underestimated opponents, but few at his level could rival him.  

Back in the Qi Refining stage, he had single-handedly shifted the outcome of the Seven Sects' battle against the North Shu Mingxin Sect.  

Now, even with his accumulated advantages, he still lacked the explosive techniques of major sects.  

Xu Chuan, eager to prove himself, had used a sect secret—compressing spiritual energy into his sword for a devastating strike.  

Such techniques were rarely practical in battle—who had time to charge up mid-fight?  

But here, with Li Shiming's formation buying time, it was perfect.
