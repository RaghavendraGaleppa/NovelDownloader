Chapter 11: In the Palm of the Hand

Tu Mama pretended to be furious, stepping forward to shout, "Surname Yang, what do you mean by that? Are you suggesting that the Suo family conspired to murder our own son-in-law?"

Yang Can replied, "The Suo family's actions along the way have been full of inconsistencies. I have my suspicions. Is Lady Tu not allowing me to speak?"

Tu Mama sneered and said to Yi She, "Esteemed Chief Steward, when the horse bandits fled that day, we captured one alive. He is currently under the guard of my people. You can interrogate him yourself to find out the true origins of these bandits."

Yang Can immediately retorted, "Commander Cheng wanted to interrogate that bandit, but you repeatedly obstructed him. Now that the best opportunity to capture the others has been missed, you're suddenly acting generous. Isn't this proof that the Suo family has ulterior motives?"

Yang Can turned to Cheng Dakuan immediately after. "Dakuan, tell him, isn't that the truth?"

The Leopard Head didn't even realize that in Yang Can's mouth, he had devolved from Commander Cheng, to Commander, to Old Cheng, and now to Dakuan.

Hearing Yang Can's words, he became extremely nervous, as tense as when he was about to bet his last stake at the gambling table.

Mr. Yang has already placed his bet. Should I follow?

Considering that the Suo and Yu families were now allied by marriage, the Suo family was stronger than the Yu family, and the Yu family currently needed the Suo family's help... the Leopard Head felt that Yang Can's unconventional method was unreliable and might easily backfire.

So, the Leopard Head said dryly, "What Mr. Yang said is true. However..." He quickly added an explanation, "However, Lady Tu said that the bandit was on his last breath at the time and couldn't withstand torture. Moreover, our priority should be ensuring the safety of the Young Mistress to reach Tianshui. Therefore..."

Yi She had thought Yang Can actually knew something, but seeing this, he realized it was all baseless speculation without a shred of evidence. He couldn't help but feel secretly furious.

This Secretary Yang, when he first saw him by the Young Master's side, he seemed quite sharp. Now, he has completely lost his mind. What reason would the Suo family have to kill the Young Master?

He cast a cold glance at Yang Can, nodded politely to Tu Mama, and said amicably, "My surname is Yi. Lady Tu, don't worry. I certainly won't listen to his wild talk. Allow me to pay my respects to my Young Master first."

Yi She turned and walked toward the ugly, shabby coffin. Looking at the wooden box, he couldn't help but sigh deeply: Young Master, now that you are dead, do you know how much trouble the Yu family is about to face?

While Yi She was burning incense and paying respects to the Young Master, Tu Mama walked to Yang Can's side and whispered in a voice only the two of them could hear, "Surname Yang, what exactly are you trying to do?"

Yang Can's lips moved, replying in an equally low voice, "I just want to muddy the waters a bit."

Tu Mama smiled disdainfully. "You think you can escape from the palm of my hand by doing this?"

Yang Can said calmly, "That's hard to say. If the water gets so muddy that even an old dragon like you can't keep its eyes open, this little loach of a man might just slip through the net."

Tu Mama was about to say more, but Yi She had finished bowing three times to Yu Chengye's coffin and turned back to ask her, "May I ask who this lady is?"

The vicious look on Tu Mama's face vanished instantly. She hurried forward to introduce herself, "My surname is Tu. I am the dowry maid accompanying my young lady."

Yi She nodded, already understanding Tu Mama's identity.

Yi She said, "Lady Tu, I wonder where Miss Suo is? I would like to see her."

Hearing him refer to Suo Chan'zhi this way, Tu Mama frowned slightly, feeling something was off.

Tu Mama was from the bride's side, so calling Suo Chan'zhi "my young lady" was not improper. But this Chief Steward Yi is from the Yu family. Shouldn't he respectfully call Suo Chan'zhi "Young Mistress"?

However, Chief Steward Yi was an external affairs chief steward representing the Yu family, comparable to a regional governor. Tu Mama's current status was nothing in front of Yi She. It wouldn't be appropriate for her to pick a fight over a title that might just be a slip of the tongue.

Tu Mama gestured vaguely with her hand and said politely, "Chief Steward Yi, the Young Mistress is over here."

Yi She nodded and followed Tu Mama over.

At this time, Qing Mei had already lifted the curtains of the carriage. Suo Chan'zhi, wearing a wedding dress inside and a mourning sash outside, stepped down gracefully, holding Qing Mei's hand.

Yi She hurried forward two steps, cupped his fists in both hands, and said respectfully, "Yu Clan Steward Yi She greets Miss Suo."

Suo Chan'zhi was slightly taken aback by this form of address. Her beautiful eyes darted a glance at Tu Mama, who shook her head at her with a look of confusion.

Suo Chan'zhi bit her lip and said softly, "This concubine is already a member of the Yu family. How can I still be worthy of such a title from Chief Steward Yi?"

Yi She was slightly stunned.

Tu Mama quickly stepped forward and said to Yi She, "Chief Steward Yi, on the way to pick up the bride, the Young Master already shared a room with my young lady. My young lady's virginity cloth is still in my possession. If we are lucky, my young lady may already be carrying the Young Master's child. Chief Steward Yi should change his title for my young lady."

"What..." Yi She couldn't help but show a hint of embarrassment on his face.

He had received the order from the Clan Leader, Yu Xinglong, in a hurry to bring people to receive the coffin. Before coming here, the Clan Leader had told him face to face: The Yu family cannot let a deceased heir apparent耽误 a young lady's entire life.

Since the bride is already halfway here, it is indeed inappropriate to send her back, but there is no need to call her Young Mistress anymore. After the funeral is over, I will recognize Miss Suo as my adopted daughter and send her back to the Suo family with great pomp. This way, we can maintain the friendship between the Yu and Suo families and also consider Miss Suo's future.

Because of Yu Xinglong's instructions, Yi She addressed Suo Chan'zhi as Miss Suo.

But how... could the Young Master have already consummated the marriage with Miss Suo?

Yi She looked closely at Suo Chan'zhi. Although she wore a look of sorrow, she possessed the beauty of a national treasure and the charm of a dew-kissed red flower. Even with Yi She's age and experience, his heart stirred slightly.

Yi She suddenly understood. No wonder!

Such a beauty, even an old man like me would find it hard to resist, let alone the Young Master in the prime of his youth. How could he endure the long journey traveling together?

Besides, since she had already been brought out, she was considered a member of the Yu family. Although a grand wedding hadn't been held at the Yu estate yet, it wouldn't be wrong to say they were already a true couple. It was also in accordance with etiquette to share a room on the road.

It's just a pity. A flower just about to bloom, now it will wither without ever being nourished by rain and dew again.

Yi She thought to himself, then cupped his fists again and bowed respectfully to Suo Chan'zhi. "I was being rash, Young Mistress. Please forgive me."

There is no unified regime in Longshang; the eight clans rule independently. Important subordinates of the eight clans refer to their lords as "Chen" (minister). This "Chen" is not the relationship between monarch and subject under an imperial system, but rather, as in the Three Kingdoms period of the Han Dynasty in Yang Can's original world, it is how a vassal's subordinate refers to their own lord.

Since Miss Suo had already consummated the marriage with the Young Master, the Yu family could not possibly return her under any circumstances. Yi She naturally had to consider himself a retainer of the Young Mistress of the main branch.

Hearing him use this title, Tu Mama finally showed a satisfied expression.

Suo Chan'zhi and Yi She exchanged a few more words before letting Qing Mei support her as she gracefully climbed into the four-horse carriage.

Just before entering the carriage, Suo Chan'zhi glanced quickly at Yang Can not far away, gently bit her lip, and then bent down to enter the cabin.

Suo Chan'zhi did not know that Tu Mama planned to get rid of Yang Can tonight.

As the saying goes, "A day of husband and wife brings a hundred days of kindness." Suo Chan'zhi and Yang Can had been intimate for much longer than a day.

Tu Mama wasn't sure what Suo Chan'zhi's current feelings for Yang Can were. To avoid complications, she hadn't told her about the plan.

But Suo Chan'zhi was no fool. Seeing that they were about to enter the territory of Tianshui, whether she was pregnant or not, Yang Can's usefulness was at an end. If Tu Mama wanted to silence him, it would inevitably happen within the next day or two.

Therefore, Suo Chan'zhi quickly guessed the intention behind Yang Can's actions: he was trying to save himself!

By deliberately accusing the Suo family of being involved in Yu Chengye's death, if he were to die now, even those who never suspected the Suo family would become suspicious.

But could he really save himself this way?

Suo Chan'zhi suddenly realized that although she was worried, what she was worried about wasn't whether they could kill Yang Can, but rather... his safety.

Pah! Suo Chan'zhi, you are such a little slut!

Suo Chan'zhi cursed herself inwardly. That beast treated you that way, and yet you're starting to feel sorry for him. Being so kind-hearted will get you into big trouble...

Yang Can stubbornly chased after him and shouted loudly at Yi She, "Chief Steward Yi, you must not be deceived by the Suo family! In my opinion, the Suo family is definitely involved in the Young Master's death!"

Tu Mama was furious and roared, "Surname Yang, if you spout any more nonsense, don't blame me for being rude to you!"

"So what if you're rude? Are you going to kill me? Come on, kill me! Do it!"

This time, Yang Can had found the perfect opening, and his voice was even louder than the Leopard Head's.

"Our Young Master was killed right under the heavy protection of your Suo family! Those bandits were only a hundred strong. How could they have broken into the camp and killed the Young Master? Right after our Young Master died, they immediately started to break out. Doesn't this all point to a conspiracy against my Young Master, an inside job?"

Tu Mama was so angry she laughed. "You were right by the Young Master's side at the time. If we from the Suo family were really behind it, wouldn't it have been easier to just kill you along with him? Why would we leave you here to spout nonsense? Besides, we captured a live one. With him, there's no fear of not finding the real killer!"

Yi She said coldly, "Mr. Yang, you say the Suo family is related to the Young Master's death. What evidence do you have?"

Yang Can said, "Chief Steward Yi, I think..."

Yi She raised his voice and said sternly, "I don't care what you think. I'm asking you, do you have evidence or not?"

Yang Can said sheepishly, "I... currently have no concrete evidence..."

Yi She said displeased, "Since you have no evidence, stop saying things that are detrimental to the harmony between our two families!"

Yi She turned and walked away in a huff. Tu Mama gave Yang Can a sinister smile and also turned to leave.

In her heart, she had already made the decision to send Yang Can on his journey tonight. As for Yang Can's struggle at this moment, it was just the final resistance of something already in the palm of her hand. Besides adding a bit of fun to the hunt for this predator, it was utterly meaningless.
