# Chapter 6: First Glimpse of the Sword Path, Cultivating the Five Elements Spells  

"Turns out there are so many cultivation families besides the Qi Family, and above all these families stands the overwhelmingly powerful Fengyue Sect."  

Previously, Qi Chuan had merely been an ordinary mortal in Baishi Town, naturally unaware of the broader cultivation world's structure.  

"So it seems our Qi Family isn't weak either, given that we have a Foundation Establishment Patriarch. As for the Fengyue Sect, being able to suppress all these families, they must surely have Golden Core cultivators?"  

Qi Chuan pondered aloud.  

Qi Baicang nodded. "Naturally. The Fengyue Sect's Profound Sword True Person is said to be a long-established Golden Core cultivator."  

"Profound Sword True Person? Could he be a legendary sword cultivator?" At this, Qi Chuan couldn't help but recall the massive iron-like flying sword he had ridden when entering the main family.  

Though, that flying sword likely wasn't a true one—just a sword-shaped flying artifact.  

"Indeed, the Profound Sword True Person is a sword cultivator, and his divine abilities are vast. It's said he has slain no fewer than one Golden Core cultivator of the same level. In these lands, he's practically a living legend."  

Qi Baicang shook his head with admiration.  

A real sword cultivator!  

Qi Chuan fell into deep thought.  

His golden finger—whether it was for normal cultivation or auxiliary professions like alchemy, artifact forging, talisman-making, or formations—would undoubtedly be effective, eventually allowing him to achieve considerable success.  

But when it came to the most powerful and combat-effective professions in the cultivation world, sword cultivators undoubtedly held a prominent place.  

If he could delve into the Sword Path and leverage his hundredfold multiplier, he would surely achieve something remarkable.  

Moreover, with formidable sword skills, he could better protect himself in times of danger, compete for cultivation resources, and seize opportunities—all of which would be immensely beneficial.  

However, switching to the Sword Path wasn't so simple.  

From what Qi Chuan surmised, it would require a Sword Path cultivation technique.  

He recalled a novel from his past life where the protagonist relied on a technique called the "Azure Origin Sword Canon" to cultivate the Sword Path, eventually ascending to immortality as a Mahayana cultivator.  

Thinking of this, Qi Chuan immediately asked, "Second Uncle, does our Qi Family have any Sword Path techniques?"  

Qi Baicang shook his head repeatedly. "Probably not. I've never heard of any sword cultivators in our Qi Family."  

"Not just our family—none of the surrounding families have produced sword cultivators either."  

"Something as advanced as a Sword Path technique is likely only found in the Fengyue Sect."  

"Is that so..." Qi Chuan inwardly sighed in disappointment.  

Still, he had already suspected the Qi Family wouldn't possess such a technique. Items of that level were far too rare.  

Not just Sword Path techniques—even ordinary cultivation techniques were likely limited in the Qi Family.  

This meant that if he wanted to pursue the Sword Path in the future, he would probably have to join the Fengyue Sect.  

But Qi Chuan knew nothing about how to join the sect.  

For now, he could only shelve the idea and revisit it if an opportunity arose later.  

Opposite him, Qi Baicang studied his expression and asked curiously, "Ah Chuan, are you actually considering the Sword Path?"  

Facing his elder, Qi Chuan nodded frankly. "I do have some interest. If I could join the Fengyue Sect, become a true disciple, and inherit the Profound Sword True Person's legacy, that would be ideal."  

"Hah! Ambitious!"  

At first, Qi Baicang had thought Qi Chuan was getting ahead of himself—after all, he only had an eighth-grade spiritual root. How could someone at their level aspire to something as lofty as the Sword Path?  

But hearing Qi Chuan's words, he realized he might have misunderstood.  

Perhaps it was just a young man casually joking with his elder.  

Besides, which low-level cultivator hadn't once dreamed of the Sword Path? It wasn't unusual.  

With that thought, he dismissed the matter.  

Then, remembering something, he pulled out a stack of talismans and handed them to Qi Chuan. "Ah Chuan, take these talismans as a gift from your Second Uncle."  

A gift?  

"Thank you, Second Uncle!"  

Qi Chuan accepted them with both hands.  

The talismans were a bright yellow, made of some unknown material that was both tough and flexible. Intricate patterns were drawn on them in cinnabar, faintly glowing with spiritual energy.  

There were fifteen in total, divided into three types—five of each—since some had identical or nearly identical patterns.  

"These are Fireball Talismans, Water Arrow Talismans, and Lightfoot Talismans—all low-grade first-tier talismans. They're not worth much, so take them to play with. Just don't burn down my mountain, alright?"  

Qi Baicang chuckled.  

Qi Chuan thanked him again and carefully stored the talismans.  

Currently, he was only at Qi Refining Layer One, and while he had the cultivation level, he lacked any combat techniques.  

With these talismans, he at least had some means of self-defense in case of danger.  

"By the way, Ah Chuan, now that you're at Qi Refining Layer One, you should also start practicing basic spells. The Evergreen Manual you have includes some fundamental Five Elements spells."  

Qi Baicang spoke again, sighing. "For cultivators like us—with poor spiritual roots and no special backing from the family—the best we can hope for is reaching mid-stage Qi Refining."  

"And some, like your Second Uncle here, get stuck at Qi Refining Layer Three for life, never breaking through the mid-stage bottleneck. That's not uncommon."  

"So, practicing the Five Elements spells now will help you identify your innate talent. Once you find your strength, you can focus on mastering one or two spells. If you can reach Minor Achievement in any of them, it'll be a decent combat skill."  

"I understand, Second Uncle," Qi Chuan replied.  

He was already aware that the Evergreen Manual contained basic Five Elements spells.  

However, until now, he had focused entirely on the cultivation technique itself and breaking through to Qi Refining Layer One, paying little attention to the spells.  

Now that he had reached Layer One, it was time to start practicing them.  

After all, he was practically penniless—owning only two spirit stones and fifteen talismans.  

He had no artifacts to rely on, so spells were his only means of increasing his combat strength.  

After dinner, Qi Chuan returned to his small house.  

After tidying up, he sat cross-legged on his bed and pulled out the Evergreen Manual, flipping to the section on basic Five Elements spells.  

"Fireball Technique, Water Arrow Technique, Earthen Wall Technique, Golden Skin Technique, Vine Technique... So the Evergreen Manual only has these five spells. If I want to learn others later, I’ll probably have to exchange for them within the family?"  

Qi Chuan mused to himself.  

"Let’s start with the Fireball Technique."  

"Surely, the hundredfold multiplier will work on spell cultivation too."
