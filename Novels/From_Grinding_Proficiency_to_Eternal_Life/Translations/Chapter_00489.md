# Chapter 489: Venerable Lord of Pure Yang, Please Accept This Disciple's Bow!

For now, I must lie low and seek another path… The Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the domain of a Dao Lord… Truly an incredibly thorny problem.

This thought, filled with deep unwillingness and regret, finally dissipated like smoke, returning to the ultimate concealment, waiting for the next opportunity to arise.

At the summit of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

The sea of clouds here was no longer a floating entity but was compressed and tamed by an invisible, overwhelming sword intent, transforming into a ceaselessly rushing "River of Sword Clouds." It surrounded a massive gateway that stood independent from the main peak's summit, yet seemed to be embedded within the firmament itself.

The gateway seemed both real and illusory, neither gold nor stone. Its entire form resembled the tip of a Pure Yang Dharma Sword, magnified by billions of times and slanted into the void, shimmering with a gentle yet incomparably sharp nine-colored glazed luster.

Above the gateway, Dao marks seemed to naturally evolve, condensing into eight ancient seal script characters. The brushstrokes moved like dragons and snakes, containing supreme Dao charm.

**Pure Yang Without Limit · Myriad Phenomena All Silent · Cavern Void Heavenly Realm**

This was the Dao Abode of the True Lord of Pure Yang, Lü Chunyang—the Pure Yang Cavern Heaven.

Upon reaching the Golden Core stage and ascending to the throne, one naturally possesses a Cavern Heaven, within which the wondrous gates of the Dao can be manifested.

Within the Cavern Heaven, the scene underwent a sudden transformation.

The boundless void was not dark but was shrouded in a constant, warm, pale golden light that seemed capable of cleansing all negative dust from the depths of one's soul.

This light was the manifestation of the Pure Yang True Gang.

There were no mountains, rivers, pavilions, or terraces here; only countless stars floating and circulating within the void.

These stars were not true celestial bodies; each one contained a pure and ultimate form of sword intent in its embryonic stage.

Scorching Sun, Cold Moon, Gale Wind, Rending Sky, Thick Earth, No Return, Extinguishing Silence, Creation and Transformation… The billions of sword-intent stars operated according to a profound and inscrutable trajectory, forming a vast, all-encompassing "Dao-Born Sword Domain."

At the core of this sword domain, the void was as flat as the surface of a lake.

A meditation cushion, condensed from the purest Primordial Geng Metal Qi and Xuan Yang Essence, floated here. Seated upon it was a person.

He wore the most ordinary grayish-green hemp Dao robe, washed until it was white but exceptionally clean and tidy.

He had no ornaments or decorations, only a deep purple gourd hanging at his waist—warm, ancient, and subtly resonant with the rhythm of the nine primordial apertures.

His features were extraordinarily handsome, with sword-like brows flying into his hairline, a nose as straight as a solitary peak, and distinct lips curved into a hint of a roguish smile.

His五官 were perfectly combined, showing no traces of time. Only his eyes, like two ancient, profound universes, held the calmness of having witnessed the vicissitudes of the world, as well as the sharpness and inner divine light capable of piercing through the myriad heavens.

His gaze was crystal clear yet unfathomable, as if reflecting the essence of all laws in the world.

He sat there, without releasing any earth-shattering aura, his entire being seeming to perfectly merge with this pure sword Dao Cavern Heaven.

However, as long as your gaze fell upon him, even on the texture of an inch of his Dao robe, your mind would be involuntarily seized by an indescribable "sense of existence."

It was as if you were not looking at a person, but a sword that had retracted all its sharpness, returning to its original simplicity, waiting to be unsheathed again!

The Dao's Sword!

The ultimate pinnacle of the Sword Dao!

That contained yet unmanifested Pure Yang sword intent, formless and intangible, yet truly existed in every inch of space within this Cavern Heaven.

It was not overbearing or harsh, but gentle and indestructible, noble and upright like the sun at high noon—supreme yang, yet also supremely soft and yielding.

It was the foundational law of this Cavern Heaven, the core around which all things operated.

Under the笼罩 of this sword intent, all evil spirits and demons had nowhere to hide, all turbid qi was purified and refined, and only the clearest Dao Heart could resonate with it.

This was the true meaning of the Primordial Sword Dao, forged through countless tribulations and the refinement of all methods into one's self.

At this moment, this existence seated at the core of the Pure Yang Cavern Heaven, the very archetype of ten thousand swords, Lü Chunyang, was observing the space before him with a gaze tinged with curiosity and inquiry.

Just three feet in front of him, the void rippled gently like water.

Xu Yunfan, who had vanished without a trace before the gates of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, was now "shaken out" from another scroll, floating there silently. He still maintained the unconscious posture of his fall, his face pale and his breath weak. The True Martial Subdue Demon Power within him seemed to have been nearly dispersed by the shock of that heaven-shaking sword intent, and even the qi mechanism of the "Eight Sceneries of the Profound Capital, Forging the Heavens and Creating the World, Cloud Pouch" had become dim and obscure.

Lü Chunyang did not immediately出手 to heal him, but merely observed Xu Yunfan with great interest.

His gaze seemed capable of penetrating flesh, muscle, and bone, looking directly at the foundation of his Purple Mansion and his Primordial Soul.

"Strange."

Lü Chunyang let out a soft exclamation. His slender, jade-like fingers casually sketched a few lines in the air before him.

As his fingertips moved, a few stars within the Cavern Heaven void, containing the sword intents of "Heaven's Mechanism," "Calculation," and "Piercing Truth," lit up slightly, casting down extremely fine yet mysteriously profound threads of light. They seemed to want to entangle and deduce Xu Yunfan's origins.

Sensing Lü Chunyang's gaze, which seemed capable of seeing through to his very essence, Xu Yunfan's tightly closed eyelids trembled violently before he suddenly opened his eyes!

He had to wake up. If he didn't, this Sword Sect True Lord might resort to methods that would invade his body. If this True Lord's power were to侵入 his body, then even his underpants would be seen through.

If he were awake and able to move, he would still have a chance to immediately use the Divine Soul Exchange. But to be dealt with while unconscious, he would have nowhere to cry for help.

However, after what had just happened, Xu Yunfan's heart had already stabilized by more than half.

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes, and the景象 of the Cavern Heaven instantly flooded his vision.

The boundless void was shrouded in a constant, warm, pale golden light, cleansing the dust from his heart.

Billions of stars, each containing an ultimate sword intent, followed profound trajectories as they floated and circulated. But these countless stars were not real celestial bodies; they were existences, one by one, containing a pure and ultimate embryonic form of sword intent.

Scorching Sun, Cold Moon, Gale Wind, Rending Sky, Thick Earth, No Return…

They followed inscrutable paths as they floated and circulated in the void, together forming a vast, all-encompassing "Dao-Born Sword Domain." This was the ultimate realm where the True Lord of Pure Yang, Lü Chunyang, manifested his fundamental Sword Dao.

However, upon closer inspection, Xu Yunfan's turbulent heart calmed down slightly. In this brilliant sword domain heavenly realm, at this moment, only a mere dozen or so sword-intent stars were truly shining with brilliance and displaying their wonders!

The other billions of stars were all shrouded in dimness and silence, forming a stark and silent contrast with the few shining points.

Xu Yunfan secretly let out a breath of relief. If this Lü Chunyang had truly comprehended a billion sword intents, then even if he wasn't a Dao Lord, he would be only a step away.

A dozen or so represented a dozen or so types of sword intents that Lü Chunyang had comprehended and brought to their ultimate peak.

Lü Chunyang's condensation and evolution of this "Dao-Born Sword Domain" was certainly not just to display his Dao Abode; his ambitions must be far-reaching and vast, exceeding what the eye could see.

And at the end of that gaze was the figure in a green robe, seated on the Primordial Geng Metal Xuan Yang cushion, as if one with the entire sword domain heavenly realm—Lü Chunyang.
