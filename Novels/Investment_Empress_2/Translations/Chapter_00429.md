# Chapter 429: Cool, Delicate Hands; A Touch Would Surely Be Comforting

Deep within the sunless fire vein.

"Stir-fry the ore... like it's a dish?"

"Exactly."

"Stir-fry it vigorously?"

"That's right."

The two old men stared at the utterly serious Li Mo, involuntarily sucking in a breath of hot air. They couldn't help but wonder if the fire vein was too hot, cooking Li Mo's brain and making him delirious.

This was a fire vein, not a kitchen!

They were master craftsmen, not chefs!

What absolute nonsense!

They suddenly began to doubt whether Li Mo could become a Divine Artisan. After all, even with the best hardware, if the software was malfunctioning... it would still be hopeless.

"Why are you looking at me with those eyes?"

The two old men's gaze was rather impolite. Li Mo coughed lightly and said, "Controlling the heat for stir-frying and for smelting is equally important, isn't it?"

"Well..."

"Then, the auxiliary materials Elder Zeng just scattered are just like adding seasoning, right?"

"That... does make some sense." Elder Zeng fell into deep thought.

Li Mo then looked at Elder Han He: "And you, Elder, constantly flipping and forging the iron block—doesn't that have a similar effect to vigorous stir-frying?"

"It's not entirely without reason..." Elder Han He also fell into deep thought.

But then, both shook their heads simultaneously.

What kind of reasoning is that?! How can metal be the same as ingredients?

They almost got tricked by this brat!

No wonder the Demon Summoning Sect was completely fooled by Li Mo...

"This is just an idea; I still need to test it out."

Li Mo was full of drive, after all, he was counting on the supplementary martial art, *Divine Treasure Hundred Refinements*, to further enhance his physique.

If the two could be combined, his efficiency would be much higher!

"If it's convenient for you two elders, please teach me your respective smelting methods. I'll spend half an hour learning them..."

"What the hell?"

"Half an hour? It's over, Li Mo is truly crazy..."

Elder Han He and Elder Zeng muttered to themselves.

They both started as apprentices and had been in the forging path for nearly sixty years.

Li Mo was asking to learn both of their forging methods in half an hour.

Even just the simplest smelting...

Impossible. Absolutely impossible!

But seeing Li Mo's enthusiastic demeanor, a strange thought arose in their hearts.

What if?

At his age, creating a divine skill and mastering a divine weapon was already an incredible feat. The fourth on the Hidden Dragon List, who isn't extraordinary and beyond conventional reasoning?

"Sigh, fine. This is this old man's forging technique."

"Let's let you give it a try."

Two thick books were handed to Li Mo by the two old men.

They were respectively titled *Divine Weapon Smelting Method* and *Five Elements Smelting Method*.

Li Mo didn't care that the ground was scorching hot. He sat right down and began to read.

In half an hour, simply reading these two books word for word would be considered a talent of the highest order, let alone understanding and mastering them.

But Li Mo only needed to read them.

[10 years of martial arts insight successfully injected...]

[Year 1: You learn the *Divine Weapon Smelting Method*, understand the characteristics of various ores and forging methods, and begin practicing...]

[Year 2: Your *Divine Weapon Smelting Method* reaches Great Perfection.]

[Year 10: You reach the pinnacle, successfully mastering the method to smelt materials for divine weapons. However, due to immature physique and conditions, you cannot yet truly apply it.]

...

[10 years of martial arts insight successfully injected...]

[Year 1: You learn the *Five Elements Smelting Method*...]

...

"Done?"

Exactly half an hour had passed. Seeing Li Mo get up, Elder Han He and Elder Zeng looked at him, one speechless with a smile, the other with a probing gaze.

Li Mo nodded and said seriously, "Mm, I can barely give it a try."

In reality, he had only spent half an hour, not a full hour (Shichen). He just sat a little longer, afraid the two old men couldn't accept it.

"Then let this old man see how you plan to 'stir-fry the dish'!" Elder Han He still couldn't quite believe it.

"Alright!"

Action immediately.

"First, heat the pot."

---

Li Mo walked straight up to Elder Zeng's great cauldron. He poured his scorching True Yuan of Karmic Fire into it. The array patterns instantly lit up, and the earthfire within the fire vein surged, licking the bottom of the cauldron.

The cauldron's temperature rose sharply.

"Next, add some oil to coat the pan." Li Mo solemnly poured in Black Evil Wood Oil.

He narrated as he worked.

"?"

Elder Han He and Elder Zeng were completely bewildered.

The main reason was that this kid was acting as if it were the real deal.

Was this a cooking show with commentary?

And, wait a minute, they were just arguing over who would teach Li Mo. They were the teachers!

"Heat the oil, then add the ingredients!"

"First, slowly raise the temperature to soften the iron ore... Mm, that's about right. Now, add the auxiliary materials."

"Now! High heat, vigorous stir-frying!"

Li Mo, imitating Elder Zeng's method, purified a large batch of iron ore.

Then, as if tossing a wok, he flipped the cauldron, causing the iron blocks to turn over and fold in the air.

Finally, after a moment's thought, he took out his hammer and, imitating Elder Han He's method, began to clank-clank-clank against the ingredients in the pot... oh wait, the iron blocks.

The entire process flowed smoothly, repeating in a cycle!

In this process, the impurities were removed, and the texture became more compact.

Moreover, as he forged, *Divine Treasure Hundred Refinements* activated!

He wasn't just smelting ore!

He was also smelting himself!

He was the forger, and also the divine iron being forged!

The *Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body*, which hadn't made any progress for a long time, actually began to progress slowly. This was extremely rare, after all, the better the weapon or ore forged with *Divine Treasure Hundred Refinements*, the greater the improvement to the physique.

Currently, he was merely smelting ordinary iron ore.

"Hah..."

Li Mo's chest heaved like a bellows, breathing in fire and iron as he subjected the iron blocks to a thousand forges and a hundred refinements!

This scene was truly heating up!

"Reduce the sauce on high heat, plate and serve!" Chef Li finally completed his first dish!

He tossed the cauldron once more.

At this moment, the small amount of molten iron remaining in the cauldron, carried by the force of his hammer, fell onto the cauldron lid.

As it gradually cooled, it revealed its original appearance.

Originally a large pile of ore, now only the size of a palm.

It was silver-white, with a luster like rippling water waves, yet its texture was incredibly hard.

"Iron... Essence?!"

Elder Han He and Elder Zeng were completely dumbfounded, their expressions even more terrified than if they had seen a ghost.

...

[Congratulations, Host, for successfully improving the 'Steel Stir-frying Method', elevating the forging technique of the Divine Weapon Peak to a new level.]

[Investment Feedback: Cloud Mother Heavy Cauldron.]

That day, the disciples of Divine Weapon Peak received a shocking news.

The Forging Institute was undergoing a new reform and would establish an exchange and mutual assistance program with the Clear Abyss Sect's cafeteria to jointly research new technologies.

Therefore.

There would be an additional entry-level assessment: one must first go to the cafeteria to practice tossing the wok, stir-frying dishes, and other chef techniques.

Countless bewildered creatures stampeded through the minds of the disciples.

And the one who started it all...

Was already carrying a vegetable basket on the way back to the Autumn Water Pavilion.

"Let's not talk about it; forging for a day is truly exhausting."

"Fortunately, *Divine Treasure Hundred Refinements* has also entered the initial stage..."

Li Mo dragged his slightly sore limbs back to the Autumn Water Pavilion.

Wherever he walked, the snow on the road melted into water.

Today, he wore a Pure Yang robe. Aside from having excessive Yang energy, the clothes weren't scorched.

But the problem was that in that environment, the accumulation of Yang energy was extremely fast. Now, his 'fire energy' was in an overly exuberant state.

To put it simply, he was currently 'running hot'.

"What is the Ice Cube doing?"

Li Mo opened the gate to the Autumn Water Pavilion, and a thought unconsciously arose in his tired mind.

If only someone could cool him down.

Her smooth, fair, delicate hands would surely feel cool to the touch right now.

As is well known, the Ice Cube is entirely cool and refreshing. If he could press himself against her... it would surely be comfortable!
