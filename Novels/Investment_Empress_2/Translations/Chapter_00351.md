# Chapter 351: The Cake Plan, The Fairy Who Lost Her Touch of Mortality (1/2)

To successfully make a cake in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands was no simple task.

After finishing breakfast, Chef Li crossed his arms and fell into deep thought.

"To make a cake..."

"What is a cake?"

Shang Qinqing asked with a serious expression.

Although the Matriarch Shang did not yet know the specifics, as the former goddess of love who governed the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, she keenly sensed that this item might be related to whether she could get her fill of sweetness today.

Li Mo said earnestly, "It's a type of food. Eating cake on birthdays is as important as eating mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival."

"Like mooncakes..."

Shang Qinqing's eyes widened slightly.

She remembered that when Bing'er was at the Azure Lawkyn Clan's territory, she held a mooncake as if it were a treasure and even planned to hang it on the Marriage Tree later...

If she participated in making the cake, she would have a legitimate reason to indulge in some sweetness.

Shang Qinqing said with a determined look, "Li Mo, as the Matriarch of the Azure Lawkyn Clan, I will do my utmost to help you. Just let me know what you need!"

"Indeed, there are some areas where I need the Matriarch's assistance."

Li Mo thought for a moment about the basic requirements for making a cake.

"First, I need a pill furnace."

"A pill furnace? What for?"

Shang Qinqing was puzzled. What kind of food would require a pill furnace?

"To make a cake, you need an oven, but it seems impossible to make one right now, so we'll have to use a pill furnace as a substitute."

"You know how to refine pills too?"

Wu Qing asked in some surprise.

It was well-known that Chef Li had considerable skill in pill refinement. He nodded and said, "I once refined the Nine-Aperture Dragon-Tiger Golden Pill with the genius Pill Dao Master, Elder Xue, and I've refined many other pills as well."

"My success rate... is a startling one hundred percent!"

Of course it was. If he jumped into the pill furnace himself, it would be strange if it failed.

"!"

Shang Qinqing clearly knew what that pill was, and her gaze toward Li Mo changed slightly.

That was a divine pill the Great Shang Dynasty had once tried to refine with all its national power. It was absolutely not something a mere Pill Dao Master could touch; it would require a Grandmaster.

Yet, judging by Little Mo's expression, he didn't seem to be boasting.

"I've noted it down. What else do you need?"

"Some ingredients."

"Go ahead."

"First, do you have eggs?"

"?"

"Ah, chicken eggs."

In any case, an unusual birthday cake-making session began.

To be able to indulge in sweetness with a clear conscience today, Shang Qinqing even personally cracked the eggs, then watched Little Li the Pill Master intently as he kneaded the dough, mixed the ingredients, made the cream, and opened the furnace to bake the cake.

The Matriarch felt that the previous steps were no problem; she could learn them at a glance, except for the final step of drawing with cream.

In the afternoon, they set off on their respective journeys. Li Mo used the Somersault Cloud's technique to traverse ten thousand miles, while Shang Qinqing穿梭ed through the void.

...

Qingmu City.

The Jiawei Restaurant was still doing excellent business, bustling with activity, and the smoke from its barbecue grills rose continuously.

Recently, there had been an obvious increase in martial artists coming to Qingmu City. After all, a major event had occurred there, and two young talents, both in the top five of the Hidden Dragon List, had made their names famous there.

"Is that the Cold Fairy?"

"No wonder, at just sixteen, she is not only in the top five of the Hidden Dragon List but also ranks in the top three of the Hundred Flowers Beauty List."

"The Ning female knight from the Asking Jade Fortress is also heroic and valiant, but in front of her, she seems to be inexplicably overshadowed."

"What are they doing?"

At the entrance of the Jiawei Restaurant.

---

A group of martial artists were discussing the two women who were about to duel.

A tall tree catches the wind.

Every young hero on the Hidden Dragon List has no shortage of challengers. Some want to test their martial arts and improve their skills, while others are arrogant and believe they are just as good, wanting to prove themselves.

After all, by defeating a Hidden Dragon prodigy ranked above them, they could take their place.

And at this moment, two people stood at the entrance of the Jiawei Restaurant.

One was Ning Liushu, ranked in the fifties on the Hidden Dragon List. She had a jade-colored long whip at her waist and was on high alert, frowning slightly as she looked at the girl opposite her.

The girl standing there seemed to be isolated from her surroundings.

She wore a dark black immortal skirt, held a long sword in her arms, and her gaze was cold and plain. It seemed that the clamor of the outside world would automatically disappear upon reaching her vicinity.

She didn't seem to care much about this duel.

It was as if she had been pestered to the point of no return and had reluctantly come out to establish her dominance, making those who wished to challenge her in the future think twice.

The twilight cast a long, graceful shadow, making her face a mix of light and dark.

"If I defeat you, Father will never make me hold a martial arts competition for a husband again. You..."

"Can we start now?"

"..."

It was well-known that martial artists would say a few words before fighting, perhaps some polite remarks or mutual provocations to dampen the other's spirit.

But the Cold Fairy didn't follow martial world conventions, yet it felt strangely reasonable.

She didn't seem to belong to this mortal world in the first place.

"Ahem... Please enlighten me!"

Whoosh—

Ning Liushu had just finished speaking and was about to pick up her whip when she found the figure opposite her had vanished.

Then she felt a chill at her back.

A sword sheath was pressing against her lower back.

"It's over already?"

"I didn't even see it clearly."

"The two didn't even unleash their Divine Intent... No, rather, Ning female knight didn't even have the qualification to unleash her Divine Intent..."

"The Hammer Little Tyrant Li Mo is the same age as her, yet he's ranked even higher than her?"

Hearing the familiar name, Ying Bing's heart stirred. She subconsciously scanned the crowd but didn't see that face. She gently bit her lip and turned to walk into the restaurant.

The Cold Fairy ordered a barbecue with Li Mo's special sauce from the owner.

Neither she nor anyone present noticed that there was a cloud in the sky that was slightly different from the others.

"That was close, almost got caught."

Li Mo breathed a sigh of relief.

A birthday naturally called for a surprise.

He exchanged a glance with Shang Qinqing and quietly went to a private room on the second floor to set up.

Down below, Ying Bing had won the duel easily, astonishing everyone who saw it. Yet, she herself didn't feel much joy from the victory.

She ate her barbecue quietly, her gaze somewhat empty.

"Miss Ice, do you have something on your mind?"

The proprietress who came to deliver the skewers couldn't help but ask.

"No, I don't," Ying Bing shook her head.

It was just a birthday alone.

She had spent countless holidays alone and had long been used to it. What was different about today...

"But I feel you've been a bit different lately."

The proprietress found it strange.

The former Miss Ice was also cold and ethereal, but she wasn't as detached as she was now, as if she had lost her touch of mortality.

It was as if the fairy who had descended to the mortal world had lost her烟火氣 and was about to float back to the heavens.

"Tsk, tsk, eating barbecue all alone."

Hearing a familiar voice, Ying Bing immediately looked up, but she only saw Shang Qinqing leaning against the door.
