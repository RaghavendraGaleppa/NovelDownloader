# Chapter 59: Capsizing in a Ditch  

The six members of Lin Shan's group found themselves ambushed from both sides, hastily defending against a barrage of spells raining down from the dense woods flanking the small stream.  

"How many are there?"  

The black-robed Daoist nun summoned a circular alms bowl above her head, a curtain of blue light descending to envelop her completely. The woman in the bamboo hat beside her was far more cunning—armed with a Water-Avoiding Pearl, she deliberately positioned herself where water arrows were thickest, letting them part harmlessly around her.  

The green-robed elder released a swarm of luminous moths, while the hook-nosed man wielded a crescent-moon-shaped magical weapon, each defending themselves as best they could.  

Huang the Immortal Master, however, surprised everyone. The old man promptly erected three layers of Earth Prison spells, sealing himself inside. Each time an external spell shattered one layer, he simply conjured another!  

Lin Shan couldn't help but scoff at the sight. Wasn't this just digging his own grave?  

As for himself, Lin Shan employed Wind Riding, swirling gusts encircling his body. Not only did this enhance his speed and agility, but it also deflected incoming spells—a neat trick he'd recently mastered. For those attacks he couldn't evade, he intercepted them with Wind Blade spells, neutralizing them in midair.  

But the group quickly realized that remaining passive was no solution. Shouts erupted among them:  

"We don't know how many are lying in wait—we need a plan!"  

"Charge forward! Break through!"  

"There are bound to be more traps ahead—we can't go that way!"  

"Then let's attack one flank and disrupt their formation!"  

"Break through where they're weakest!"  

"Follow me this way!"  

In moments, they settled on a strategy. The green-robed elder, shrouded in gray mist with moths swirling around him, took the lead and charged toward the eastern woods.  

"Follow me!" he bellowed.  

"Right!" the others chorused in response.  

Yet after braving a storm of Earth Spikes, Fireballs, and Entangling Vines to reach the woods, the elder found only one person beside him—the hook-nosed man, who had been conveniently using him as a shield while wielding his crescent weapon.  

The two exchanged bewildered glances before turning back to look.  

Lin Shan, with Huang the Immortal Master in tow, and the black-robed Daoist nun leading the woman in the bamboo hat, had already crossed the stream and were fleeing toward the northwest and southwest woods, respectively.  

Lin Shan had no intention of following the green-robed elder. He wouldn't put it past the old man to stab him in the back during the escape. With the ambushers' numbers unknown, survival depended on individual skill.  

This group clearly lacked unity. Splitting up might actually divert some of their pursuers' attention.  

---  

Huang the Immortal Master, shielded by his Earth Prisons, stuck close to Lin Shan. He trusted the green-robed elder even less and figured clinging to Lin Shan was his best bet.  

The moment they plunged into the woods, they spotted a woman seated gracefully on a tree branch, her delicate fingers weaving Ice Spike spells.  

She wore an elegant blue palace gown, her hair coiled in an intricate updo. Her skin was like jade, her dark eyes gleaming with an icy, regal charm. Every movement exuded an aura of cold, breathtaking beauty.  

"Princess Guo?!" Huang blurted out, his voice trembling with shock.  

Lin Shan shot him a questioning look. "You know her?"  

Without hesitation, Huang grabbed Lin Shan and bolted deeper into the woods, explaining in a rush:  

"The seventh daughter of Prince Huai'an of the Great Song Dynasty, Princess Guo! A mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator—one of the most renowned rogue cultivators in the capital!"  

The woman leaped down from the tree with effortless grace, her every step poised and deliberate. Though her smile carried a hint of allure, it was dignified rather than vulgar.  

"Immortal Huang of the Nightingales, and Fellow Daoist Lin, who slew Immortal Nan at Dongting Lake. I've been waiting for you."  

Her voice was cool, laced with faint mockery.  

Lin Shan and Huang paled.  

Their identities had been uncovered. This was no random ambush—they had been deliberately targeted.  

From the direction where the black-robed Daoist nun and the bamboo-hatted woman had fled, startled cries and the sounds of battle erupted. Clearly, they too had encountered formidable opponents and were already locked in combat.  

Princess Guo had no intention of letting Lin Shan and Huang escape. As she unleashed Ice Spikes, she tapped a blue jade pendant at her waist. A shimmering white light flashed, and a serpent of condensed ice materialized.  

The serpent was pure white, its body covered in crystalline scales. Its eyes gleamed with chilling intelligence, suggesting it was no mere construct but a spiritual beast with sentience.  

"Go!"  

At Princess Guo's command, the ice serpent lunged at Huang, its forked tongue flickering eagerly.  

Huang hastily uncorked a green gourd at his chest, releasing dozens of moths that spewed toxic powder to intercept the serpent. But the creature exhaled a freezing mist, instantly encasing the powder in ice that clattered to the ground.  

Seeing Huang in trouble, Lin Shan couldn't stand idle. He hurled Wind Blades at Princess Guo.  

Unfazed, she formed a strange hand seal, conjuring a massive ice mirror before her.  

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*  

The Wind Blades struck the mirror—only to rebound straight back at Lin Shan and Huang, now mixed with Princess Guo's own Ice Spikes.  

"Damn it! What kind of spell is that?!"  

The two barely managed to deflect the onslaught, their protective auras flickering dangerously.  

Lin Shan swiftly drew his Cold Iron Sword. Princess Guo's reflective defense was clearly no ordinary spell, and that jade pendant housing a serpent spirit was undoubtedly a magical artifact.  

Even if they attacked with everything they had, they couldn't breach her defenses!  

In desperation, Lin Shan channeled his spiritual energy into the sword. Within a single breath, three runes ignited along the blade, radiating an intense blue light.  

He swung the sword at Princess Guo.  

A three-foot-long arc of condensed sword qi tore through the air, its edge so sharp it split the wind with sonic booms. The sheer pressure in its wake sent leaves swirling upward like a storm.  

"Mid-grade magical artifact!"  

Princess Guo's face drained of color. She barely had time to summon another ice mirror before the sword qi struck.  

*Boom! Crash!*  

The sword qi shattered both mirrors effortlessly, reducing them to glittering shards before slamming into Princess Guo.  

*Thud!*  

She was sent flying into an ancient tree behind her, its branches shaking violently as leaves rained down.  

Yet when the dust settled, Princess Guo was still standing. Blood trickled from her lips, but her gown now glowed with a hazy blue radiance, mist-like and ethereal.  

"Magic Robe!"  

Huang, who had witnessed Lin Shan's destructive power firsthand at the Nightingales' headquarters, had been confident in this strike. Yet Princess Guo had withstood it!  

Lin Shan sneered. If one strike wasn't enough, he'd deliver another. And another!  

Did she think her Magic Robe made her invincible? Let's see how well it holds up against his blade!  

He had no intention of bantering—knowing that villains often fell due to excessive gloating—and focused solely on channeling more energy into his sword.  

But Princess Guo was faster. The moment she was sent flying, she flicked her wrist, producing a miniature bell. With a snap of her fingers, she rang it.  

*Dang—*  

The sound was indescribable. Before Lin Shan could unleash his next attack, a splitting pain exploded in his skull.  

"Argh!"  

His spiritual energy faltered, the sword's glow dimming instantly.  

His mind reeled, thoughts scattering like leaves in a gale. The bell's toll had severed his concentration, forcibly disrupting his spellcasting. By the time he regained his senses, fury and dread warred within him.  

Princess Guo pointed at Lin Shan, and the ice serpent immediately abandoned Huang, lunging at him with a hiss.  

Still disoriented, Lin Shan barely managed to shake off the daze and raise his sword—only for another bell toll to strike.  

*Dang—*  

"Ah!"  

His skull throbbed anew, his spell interrupted once more. The Cold Iron Sword's runes, half-lit, flickered out again.  

Princess Guo's timing was impeccable. No matter how powerful his weapon, Lin Shan couldn't land a single blow if he couldn't complete a spell.  

Staggering under the relentless mental assaults, a grim realization dawned on him:  

*Am I going to be controlled to death?*
