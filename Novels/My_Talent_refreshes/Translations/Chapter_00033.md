# Chapter 33: Fifth Layer of Qi Refining

As the Evergreen Wood Longevity Technique circulated, Chu Ning immediately sensed a surge of abundant spiritual energy flowing from the spirit stone. The richness of this energy surpassed even that of the Verdant Wood Spring Technique.

"Truly worthy of being a spirit stone—its effects are indeed extraordinary," Chu Ning mused inwardly. With focused determination, he immersed himself completely in the technique's circulation.

The spiritual energy within the stone rapidly poured into Chu Ning's body, its luminous glow fading swiftly. Eventually, he sensed that the spirit stone had been completely drained of energy. Prepared for this, he began absorbing energy from the stone held in his left hand.

By the time this second stone was nearly depleted, the fourth layer of spiritual energy in Chu Ning's dantian had reached completion, and the fifth layer gradually began to form. He continued cultivating to stabilize his newfound realm.

After some time, Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes. The spirit stones in his hands had turned to dust.

"Fifth layer of Qi Refining!" Chu Ning chuckled softly as he observed the changes in his proficiency within the depths of his consciousness.

[Evergreen Wood Longevity Technique (Yellow Grade, Low Tier), Second Level (201/900)]

Just as he had anticipated, the proficiency distribution for the second level of the Evergreen Wood Longevity Technique across the three mid-stage Qi Refining realms wasn't evenly divided. His proficiency had now surpassed 200, and his cultivation had successfully broken through the fourth layer to reach the fifth.

"If this pattern holds, advancing to the sixth layer would likely require the technique's proficiency to increase by another 300 points, reaching 500. And to break through to the late-stage Qi Refining realm, it would take an additional 400 points," Chu Ning mused. "Indeed, each layer becomes progressively more challenging."

As he pondered this, Chu Ning also gained a clearer understanding of the efficacy of using spirit stones for cultivation. Three stones had increased his proficiency by 3 points—equivalent to two or three days of cultivation using the Verdant Wood Spring Technique. Without it, the same progress would have taken over ten days.

"While spirit stones can accelerate cultivation, the cost is hardly something one can sustain casually," Chu Ning thought, shaking his head slightly. Even with his newfound skill in talisman paper production, continuous use of spirit stones for cultivation would be financially burdensome, let alone for ordinary labor disciples.

"If I want more spirit stones, I'll need to sell my talisman paper—it's currently my most valuable asset." Chu Ning contemplated how best to handle his stockpile.

In essence, there were two options: either exchange them with the sect for spirit stones or sell them at the market. Chu Ning decided to pursue both avenues. The sect offered a better rate—55 sheets per spirit stone—compared to the market's 60. However, handing everything over to the sect would reveal his previous underreporting, so he planned to sell a portion privately.

Recently, he had discreetly inquired with Zhuang Yunde and Qiu Shunyi about bandit cultivators in the market. From their accounts, no such incidents had occurred, leading Chu Ning to conclude that his encounter with the bearded man had been mere coincidence—he had simply been targeted during that period. Still, he resolved to exercise caution when venturing outside, ensuring he traveled with companions.

Before any excursions, however, Chu Ning intended to first fulfill his talisman paper quota for the sect. Keeping such a large quantity at hand was impractical. Unsure of when Zhuang Yunde might visit, and recalling the latter's mention of opportunities for recommended labor disciples to advance to the outer sect, Chu Ning decided to seek him out proactively.

Dividing his stock, Chu Ning packed 3,500 sheets for the sect into one bag and another 2,050 into a smaller pouch—550 of which were Zhuang Yunde's share, the rest potentially for sect exchange. The remaining 5,250 sheets were stored securely in a cabinet. 

As he finished, Chu Ning realized the need for a storage pouch. With his belongings accumulating, keeping them unsecured in his room felt increasingly unsafe.

Carrying the two bags, Chu Ning left his courtyard and headed toward the outer sect. This marked his first initiative to seek out Zhuang Yunde there. 

After a lengthy walk from the spiritual plantation area, Chu Ning arrived at the Qingxi Sect's outer gate and paused. Though labor disciples like him resided within the sect's boundaries, they were barred from the outer sect's inner quarters—privileges reserved for outer disciples like Zhuang Yunde.

Chu Ning's presence immediately drew the attention of the disciples on duty at the gate. Noting his labor disciple attire, one of them—a medium-built youth with an air of arrogance—barked, "Who are you? What business do you have in the outer sect?"

Despite the disdain in the other's eyes, Chu Ning maintained composure and clasped his hands respectfully. "Senior Brother, this disciple is Chu Ning from the Spiritual Plantation's Ding District. I've come to deliver my harvest to Labor Disciple Zhuang Yunde."

"Harvest delivery? Doesn't someone collect that from you?" The disciple frowned skeptically.

Not wishing to elaborate, Chu Ning replied vaguely, "I was recommended to the Hundred Arts Hall for training, so my submission was delayed." He presented his identity token.

After verifying it, the gatekeeper reluctantly waved him through, allowing Chu Ning his first step into the outer sect.

"The resources here truly suit outer disciples—far superior!" The denser spiritual energy was immediately palpable, though Chu Ning noted it still fell short of what he achieved with the Dark Bamboo's Verdant Wood Spring Technique. A brief observation later, he lowered his head and quickened his pace toward Zhuang Yunde's residence.

As a labor disciple, he was inconspicuous within the sect at large, but his presence in the outer quarters stood out. Chu Ning had no desire to accidentally provoke an outer disciple and invite trouble.

Yet his attempts at discretion proved futile. Nearing his destination, a melodious voice called out, "Hey, junior brother—wait a moment."
