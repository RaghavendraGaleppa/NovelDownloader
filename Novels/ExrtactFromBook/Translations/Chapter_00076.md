# Chapter 76: First Acquaintance with the Demon-Slaying Sword

The complete [Soul-Nourishing Banner] exhibited vastly different effects!  

As soon as it condensed within Han Yue's sea of consciousness, it immediately unleashed a tremendous suction force. The flow of Han Yue's internal mana accelerated instantly, and the [Soul-Nourishing Banner] naturally integrated itself into his mana circulation.  

A vast amount of mana surged into Han Yue's sea of consciousness, merging with the [Soul-Nourishing Banner]. His body, which had been nearly saturated with mana, was suddenly depleted by a third—his capacity for storing mana had increased significantly!  

Now replenished with mana, the [Soul-Nourishing Banner] revealed its divine wonders and began transforming Han Yue's sea of consciousness and divine sense. Han Yue felt the banner expand abruptly, filling his entire sea of consciousness in an instant. Then, inch by inch, it pushed against the boundaries of his consciousness, gradually expanding them.  

For a moment, Han Yue felt as though he had lost control of his divine sense—his thoughts and body became disjointed. This was due to the rapid growth of his divine sense, causing a temporary misalignment between mind and body.  

The transformation lasted a full seven days. When Han Yue awoke, it was as if he had emerged from a dream spanning lifetimes. Upon inspection, he discovered that his sea of consciousness had doubled in size, and his divine sense had tripled, completely dispelling the oppressive sensation caused by accommodating the legacy stele.  

The [Soul-Nourishing Banner] shrank back to its original size and settled at the bottom of Han Yue's sea of consciousness, continuing to participate in his mana circulation. The banner itself had also become far more refined.  

With this, the [Thunder Nourishes the Soul] secret art was fully mastered!  

Unlike [Thunder Nourishes the Body], which required constant cultivation to break through limits and pursue repeated perfection, [Thunder Nourishes the Soul] only needed the [Soul-Nourishing Banner] to be condensed. Once formed, it required no further effort to maintain.  

The completed [Soul-Nourishing Banner] would automatically exert its effects during mana circulation, continuously nourishing Han Yue's soul, strengthening his divine sense, and expanding his sea of consciousness.  

Han Yue's first achievement upon arriving at the Divine Thunder Palace was mastering an exceptionally powerful soul-forging spell!  

Now, with his divine sense greatly enhanced and his comprehension soaring, he could memorize anything at a glance.  

[Thunder Nourishes the Body] and [Thunder Nourishes the Soul] together formed the [Body and Soul Thunder Method]. This exquisite cultivation technique was truly worthy of the Divine Thunder Palace's status as a top-tier sect.  

The qi-nourishing and body-refining effects of [Thunder Nourishes the Body] were already extraordinary, rivaling the foundational techniques of many major sects. When combined with the top-tier soul-refining secret art [Thunder Nourishes the Soul], the synergy between the two triggered a qualitative transformation!  

As stated in [Answers to Disciples' Questions] by the True Person:  

"Of the five soul-nourishing secret arts of our sect, the [Divine Thunder Twelve Rivers, Eight Lakes, and Seventy-Two Streams Sea Convergence Secret Record] is the most profound, the [Body and Soul Thunder Method] the most refined, the [Geng Golden Gourd Sword Scripture] the swiftest, the [Minor Pure Breeze Jade Talisman True Scripture] the most wondrous, and the [Five Viscera Refinement Dao Treasure Book] the most versatile. Each of these five techniques excels in its own way. When cultivated to their depths, they may bestow divine abilities upon forming the Golden Core!"  

Han Yue was utterly confident in mastering the [Body and Soul Thunder Method] to its pinnacle. This was the path his Dao heart yearned for, and it would surely bear fruit!  

Han Yue emerged from his meditation and calculated the time—this session of condensing the [Soul-Nourishing Banner] had lasted a full four months, the longest closed-door cultivation he had ever undertaken.  

He stood up, stretched his limbs, and heard his bones crack like popping beans. Stepping out of his cave abode, he returned to the platform outside. The sun hung high in the sky, and the towering peaks of No Return Summit and Surging Wave Summit pierced the heavens with majestic grandeur.  

Han Yue soared into the air on a beam of light, hovering directly above the mountain where his cave was located. The peak he had chosen lay about ten kilometers west of No Return Summit and was less than half its height.  

The terrain of the Divine Thunder Palace was peculiar. The mountain ranges extending from No Return Summit and Surging Wave Summit gradually decreased in elevation, from tens of thousands of zhang to less than a thousand meters. To the north and south lay endless black soil plains, sparsely vegetated and devoid of human habitation.  

Having been in seclusion for so long, Han Yue felt restless now that he had overcome a major hurdle. Since the area west of No Return Summit was completely lifeless, he decided to indulge in some activity.  

He summoned his escape light and flew westward, covering over a hundred kilometers in an instant before turning back. A streak of golden light streaked across the uninhabited skies above No Return Summit at breakneck speed.  

Han Yue pushed his speed faster and faster until he was fully unleashing the [Earth-Traversing Golden Light Technique]. He reveled in the freedom of flight, venting his pent-up mana and emotions. After being cooped up for so long, he needed this exhilarating flight to shake off the restlessness.  

The golden light flashed across the sky for hours—Han Yue had flown a distance that could have taken him back to the outer realms. The full-speed flight drained his mana rapidly, and only after expending more than half did he feel satisfied.  

Returning to the platform, he devoured several plums to quench his thirst. Then, he drew a three-foot-long purple bronze sword and began practicing with it.  

The sword was unassuming yet exuded an inner glow, its blade adorned with intricate inscriptions and possessing an elegant, slender form.  

This was none other than the [Upper Cave True Thunder Demon-Slaying Sword]!  

A third-grade magical artifact personally forged by Han Yue!  

As he gripped the sword, Han Yue felt an intimate connection, as though it were an extension of his own body.  

Though he had devoted the past few months to condensing the [Soul-Nourishing Banner], the two artifacts resting in his dantian had still undergone refinement through the continuous flow of mana.  

Now, the [Demon-Slaying Sword] bore three [Upper Cave True Thunder Runes], further enhancing its power. Han Yue's physique had long surpassed that of ordinary body-refining cultivators.  

His swordplay flowed like ink across paper, leaving faint purple afterimages in the air. His movements were fluid and graceful as he gradually familiarized himself with the sword's nature and aura.  

Though the [Demon-Slaying Sword] had not yet been fully refined and its divine might remained dormant, it already possessed the material properties of a third-grade treasure—unmatched in toughness and sharpness, far surpassing any magical artifact Han Yue had encountered.  

As he danced with the sword, Han Yue grew increasingly attuned to its essence, forging a deeper bond between man and blade.  

Suddenly, Han Yue swung the sword, and the [Demon-Slaying Sword] shot from his hand, transforming into a streak of purple light that streaked through the air. Through an intangible connection, Han Yue guided the sword's rune-infused mana, causing the blade to trace a beautiful arc before returning to him.  

Unfazed by the speeding sword light, Han Yue reached out and caught the hilt mid-flight, seamlessly continuing his swordplay.  

With the preliminarily refined [Demon-Slaying Sword], Han Yue could now wield it as a flying sword to strike enemies within a hundred zhang!  

Mid-dance, the [Demon-Slaying Sword] occasionally shot out as a sword light, swift as lightning and impossible for evil spirits to evade!  

Thanks to his greatly enhanced divine sense, Han Yue's control over the flying sword grew increasingly precise. Eventually, he closed his eyes, relying entirely on his divine sense to guide the blade.  

The [Demon-Slaying Sword] struck faster and faster!  

Then, in a moment of perfect unity, Han Yue merged with the sword and unleashed his most powerful strike yet.  

As if touched by divine inspiration, he channeled the full power of his divine ability into the [Demon-Slaying Sword].  

A colossal sword light erupted forth!  

Empowered by the [Upper Cave True Thunder Demon-Slaying Sword], Han Yue's [Thoughtless Slash] surpassed its former might!
