**Chapter 82: Rankings Unveiled, Ying Bing: 'I'm Second?'**

"Who am I? Where am I?" It felt like an eternity, yet also just an instant. Outside the window, a cold moon still shone, illuminating a stream frozen solid. Inside the chamber, Li Mo opened his eyes in a daze. The magnificent and ancient scene he had just witnessed still lingered in his mind, refusing to fade, occupying almost all his thoughts.

At this moment, only one sensation overwhelmed his senses: hunger. Not physical hunger, but a profound yearning from the depths of his soul. Subconsciously, he pulled out a bottle of Ten-Thousand-Year Earth Vein Spirit Milk and gulped it down. The Earth Vein essence surged into his Dantian, continuously absorbed by the thirty-six primary meridians, merging into his Dantian, giving his body the feeling of a parched land finally receiving sweet rain.

"Huu..." Young Li wiped the corners of his mouth, finally recovering his senses, and remembered what had just happened. He had used the Heavenly Book Seal to deduce martial arts. He had elevated a divine art, raising its rank and transforming it into a lotus petal.

"That martial art... I don't even know if it can still be called a martial art." The feeling was strange. Li Mo clearly knew its content, yet he didn't know how to describe it. He wished to express it, but had forgotten the words. All the methods of transmitting information he knew seemed too pale and powerless to convey what the martial art described.

He then realized something was off. He quickly focused his attention on his Dantian. He saw a faint wisp of energy lingering in his Dantian, almost tangible. It was a pale red, like an eternal flame burning from antiquity, never extinguishing. Inner Qi?!

This time, his Inner Qi had not disappeared again!

"A single bottle of Ten-Thousand-Year Earth Vein Spirit Milk only managed to condense this one wisp for me?" Li Mo was speechless. He finally understood the purpose of those thirty-six meridians. Without their combined effort in converting the Earth Vein essence, not even this single wisp of Inner Qi could have been condensed.

He raised a finger. That wisp of Inner Qi immediately appeared at its tip. It had no temperature, no discernible aura. He flicked his finger. Immediately, a wisp of Inner Qi flew out the window and landed on the frozen stream. Miraculously, it burst into flames. The ice was 'ignited,' yet it didn't melt into water.

The firelight danced in Li Mo's pupils, reflecting the astonishment in his eyes. "If I don't retract it, it will continue to burn like this... until the entire stream is burnt away..."

"This Inner Qi can not only burn ice, but it can even scorch other 'fires'..." An understanding dawned on him. The Inner Qi of other cultivators definitely didn't possess such exaggerated characteristics. At most, theirs would be tougher or more destructive. But his Inner Qi could incinerate all things; it was merely a matter of time.

"So, how did this Inner Qi get into my body?" Young Li discovered a blind spot. Well. This, he supposed, could only be attributed to the marvels of the Profound Womb Immortal Physique.

"In any case, I've finally reached the Inner Qi realm." Li Mo finally let go of the heavy burden in his heart. He now had twelve bottles of Earth Vein Spirit Milk left. He set aside three bottles: two for his parents, and one for emergencies. The remaining nine, he planned to use entirely for cultivation.

No more talk, time to charge!

Upstairs. The room was filled with snowy white, every visible surface covered in frost. The bed, made of fine wood, had been completely frozen and cracked. Ying Bing's beautiful brows furrowed slightly. Faint Inner Qi fluctuations emanated from her. Indeed, even at this hour, she was still cultivating by leveraging the restless Grand Yin energy. This required enduring immense pain, but also yielded greater rewards.

The Grand Yin, ultimately cold, ultimately soft. While it brought desolation to all things, it also contained the vital essence for all things to germinate. This was also why her physical body far surpassed others at the same realm.

"The time should be... about right." Ying Bing raised her gaze, looking at the bright moon hanging in the sky. It was midnight. The system was punctual, and at this moment, a timely notification arrived:

[Listing all prodigies within the scope of the Eastern Desolation Region...]
[Performing battle power comparison for the Host...]

The two system tasks proceeded simultaneously. In fact, just looking at the list would suffice. As long as her name appeared at the top, everything else would be self-evident.

"Huu..." Ying Bing exhaled a breath laden with ice crystals, and a hint of seriousness appeared on her jade-like countenance. It wasn't that she was worried about her own position, but rather, curious. Besides Li Mo, would anyone else in this life surprise her? And what position would that young man, so different from his previous life, rank in?

In the extreme cold where drops of water would instantly freeze, time seemed to lose its meaning.

[Ding dong—]
[First Ranking Results Announced.]

[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 50: Lin Jiang.]
[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 49: Zhao Qin.]
...
[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 30: Murong Xiao.]
...

Watching the lines of text appear from the system, Ying Bing's expression returned to tranquility. The system's rankings indeed deviated slightly from her memories. For instance, Lin Jiang, and Murong Xiao. Coincidentally, both of them seemed to know Li Mo? She hadn't seen his name yet. That was normal. Li Mo's sword arts were learned from her, after all. And in their spar today, he had even revealed some things she hadn't expected. His rank would be at least within the top twenty.

The system's ranking text continued to appear.

[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 20: Xiao Qin.]
[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 19: Mei Ziguang.]
...
[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 14: Luo Yu.]
[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 13: Zuoqiu Yang.]
...

Gradually, in the system's rankings, some names began to leave an impression on Ying Bing. Some had made great names for themselves in the Eastern Desolation Region in her previous life, while others later went to the Central Divine Continent, leaving their marks amidst the turbulent currents of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. For example, Luo Yu, who, after the decline of the Qingyuan Sect, led Burning Jade Valley to become the leader of Ziyang Prefecture. For example, Zuoqiu Yang, who claimed first place in the Endless Trials, and years later, became a terrifying 'Heaven'-ranked assassin of the Misty Rain Tower.

These were all exceptional talents. As for the top ten, they were even more extraordinary, true dragons among men. Ying Bing's thoughts stirred. She noticed that Li Mo wasn't among them either. Had he made it into the top ten? No... more than just the top ten.

[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 5: Zhong Zhenyue.]
[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 4: Han Zhen.]
[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 3: Shang Li.]

Seeing this, a trace of confusion and bewilderment finally flickered in Ying Bing's eyes. These individuals were all destined to shine brightly in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands in the future, heroes who, amidst the great tides of destiny, would carve out their own waves. For example, Shang Li, the former Crown Prince of the Great Shang Dynasty. He carried the last vestiges of the Great Shang's national destiny and later ostentatiously restored his nation. For example, Han Zhen. This person was quite mysterious; Ying Bing only knew that his rise was incredibly astonishing, and the martial arts he employed seemed to belong to an entirely different era, possibly inherited from an ancient power.

Could Li Mo surpass them, ranking only below herself?

Just as the thought arose, Ying Bing's thoughts suddenly froze, and her clear, serene eyes trembled violently.

[Eastern Desolation Region Prodigy Rank 2: Ying Bing.]

She saw her own name.
