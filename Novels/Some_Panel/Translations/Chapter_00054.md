# Chapter 54: Breaking Through to Foundation Establishment, Sword Yuanzi's Surprise

Inside the secret chamber, Yang Ji's spiritual sense delved into the cultivation jade slip, beginning to comprehend the True Steel Divine Art.

【You began reading the cultivation technique. You were astonished that each character of the technique pulsed with a powerful, rigid aura, and waves of firm, robust energy instantly made your blood surge.】

【You continuously contemplated the Dao essence emanating from the cultivation characters and the profound mysteries contained within them.】

【You began to comprehend.】

【Your direction was wrong, but you adjusted in time.】

【You resumed comprehension.】

【Wrong again.】

【You comprehended once more.】

【This repeated ten times.】

【After two days, you grasped the essence of True Steel. True Steel means spiritual power that is firm and indestructible, and spirit that is upright and valiant.】

【You began to circulate the cultivation technique, preparing to absorb spiritual energy.】

【The circulation route was incorrect. You tried again.】

【You marveled that the True Steel Divine Art was truly worthy of being a Dao-level technique; its circulation route was more than a hundred times more complex than the Azure Water Art.】

【You continued to attempt it. Ten days passed.】

【After twenty-five failures, you finally succeeded in circulating the True Steel Divine Art, completing one Grand Cycle of Spirit Absorption.】

【As soon as the cultivation technique circulated, the surrounding spiritual energy surged in, forming a mist.】

【You sighed, impressed that a Dao-level cultivation technique truly lived up to its name; its efficiency in absorbing free spiritual energy was more than a hundred times better than lower-grade techniques.】

【You continued to circulate the technique and found that the Zhou Tian power generated by the Dao-level technique within your body was too immense, increasing the amount of spiritual energy absorbed in one cycle for your lower-grade root bone by several times, thus accelerating your cultivation speed.】

【Not only that, the speed at which the Dao-level technique refined spiritual energy was also tens of times faster than lower-grade techniques. You were overjoyed and continued cultivating.】

After several cycles of the True Steel Divine Art, the first wisp of refined spiritual power descended into his Dantian.

At this moment, his Dantian contained both Azure Water spiritual power and a trace of True Steel spiritual power.

Yang Ji distinctly felt the difference between the two types of spiritual power. The True Steel spiritual power was incredibly heavy, sinking directly to the bottom of his Dantian, unlike the Azure Water spiritual power which floated like mist.

Yang Ji stopped absorbing, immediately drawing out the True Steel spiritual power. The translucent True Steel spiritual power was as rigid as a sword. When it landed on his robe, it visibly bent the fabric.

Yang Ji took out his flying sword, then flicked his finger. The spiritual power in his hand shot out like an arrow. *Whoosh!* The spiritual power collided with the flying sword, causing a small spark to fly, and then the spiritual power shattered piece by piece.

Yes!

The spiritual power shattered.

But it also left a pinhole-sized white dot on the flying sword, which was quite noticeable.

Yang Ji was astonished, secretly praising the True Steel spiritual power for its remarkable hardness. Just a wisp of it could leave a white mark on a flying sword.

However, looking at the shattered spiritual power, he instantly discovered its flaw: rigidity breaks easily.

As he pondered, Yang Ji then shot out a wisp of Azure Water spiritual power. The spiritual power was light as cotton floss. It hit a stone slab, bent, and bounced back.

"True Steel spiritual power is too rigid, unlike the flexible resilience of Azure Water spiritual power. It's like tempered glass—very hard when whole, but once it shatters, it becomes a pile of granules," Yang Ji shook his head. With such a comparison, the strengths and weaknesses of the two spiritual energies were immediately apparent.

Overall, the True Steel spiritual power was far more powerful and suited his path.

Yang Ji then closed his eyes and began to circulate the True Steel Divine Art, converting the Azure Water spiritual power within his body.

Having two different attributes of spiritual power coexist in one Dantian was something most people wouldn't dare to do, as it could easily lead to qi deviation.

But Yang Ji dared, because he had thoroughly comprehended the essence of both cultivation techniques and had no such worries.

Three days passed, and half of the Azure Water spiritual power in his body had already been converted into True Steel spiritual power.

This efficiency of refinement was incredibly high, showcasing the terrifying power of a Dao-level cultivation technique.

At this moment, within his Dantian, the True Steel spiritual power settled below, with the Azure Water spiritual power above, both orderly and not interfering with each other.

But as Yang Ji prepared to continue circulating the True Steel Divine Art to convert all the remaining Azure Water spiritual power, he suddenly froze...

Because he found that his Dantian displayed a message: 【True Steel spiritual power and Azure Water spiritual power are beginning to merge.】

The two spiritual powers, which had previously coexisted without interfering, were actually beginning to merge.

This process was gentle, not violent at all, so much so that Yang Ji hadn't noticed it in the slightest.

The two spiritual powers intertwined like Yin and Yang, everything so natural, intimately blending, like lovers embracing and lingering.

Finally, they formed a completely new type of spiritual power. It carried a very, very faint light blue hue, almost imperceptible without a careful look.

"What?" Yang Ji exclaimed in surprise, quickly drawing out a wisp of the spiritual power to examine it as it pulsed between his fingers.

Then he flicked his finger, and it shot out. *Whoosh!* The flying sword bore a mark, but the spiritual power did not shatter.

Yang Ji made a reverse pulling gesture, and the spiritual power returned to his hand.

"This new spiritual power actually possesses the flexible resilience of Azure Water spiritual power and the profound rigidity of True Steel spiritual power. This is truly a blessing!"

Yang Ji burst into laughter.

An unintentional stroke of luck, yet a true masterpiece!

Witnessing this, how could Yang Ji possibly remove all the Azure Water spiritual power?

The fusion of the two spiritual powers was the true path.

In the following days, after the new spiritual power had fully formed, Yang Ji began to purify the spiritual power within his body, transforming it from a gaseous state into a liquid state.

The Dao-level cultivation technique truly lived up to the character "Dao"; within half a month, all the spiritual power in his body had converted into liquid form, sinking to the bottom of his Spiritual Sea.

The previously filled Spiritual Sea became empty again as the spiritual power turned to liquid.

It was at the moment the spiritual power liquefied that a spiritual pressure emanated from Yang Ji's body, causing the surrounding air and free-floating spiritual energy to churn and gather around him.

Yang Ji clearly felt a special aura field forming around him, fluctuating with the spiritual power within his body.

This aura field, as his cultivation grew, would expand further and further. Within a radius of ten *zhang*, any incoming attack would be swiftly sensed by his aura field, giving him ample time to react.

By the time he reached the Golden Core stage, his internal spiritual power would solidify, allowing him to form a True Qi Domain, an impenetrable defense that cultivators below Foundation Establishment simply could not break through.

It was at the instant this aura field formed that Yang Ji knew he had broken through, successfully advancing to the Foundation Establishment Realm.

The shackles of life were also broken, allowing him to enjoy a lifespan of two hundred years.

The wonderful sensation brought by this increase in lifespan left him savoring the feeling endlessly.

Just as the spiritual pressure emanated from his body, Sword Yuanzi, outside the great hall, immediately sensed this fluctuation.

A rare look of emotion appeared in Sword Yuanzi's eyes. "This aura... my disciple, he has broken through to Foundation Establishment?"

"Only a month, and my disciple has comprehended the True Steel Divine Art?"

"No, one month is the time from his comprehension of the technique to his breakthrough to Foundation Establishment. That means the time he spent comprehending the technique was far less than a month."

"A genius! Truly a genius with extraordinary comprehension!"

Sword Yuanzi reacted, abruptly rising. He gazed at the secret chamber where Yang Ji was in seclusion, his eyes filled with pleasant surprise.

"Such comprehension is enough to warrant an Elder Council meeting for him, convened by the Spirit Transformation Exalted and all Nascent Soul True Monarchs within the sect."

"His treatment and privileges should be elevated to that of a Nascent Soul True Monarch. Furthermore, he should certainly receive one of the three Spirit Cleansing Pills."
