# Chapter 35: Saved by Li Yizhen

After Li Yizhen had been sent back by Ding Rui earlier, she had been waiting for him to come deal with the large aphids. But it was almost time for the afternoon work session to begin, and Ding Rui still hadn't arrived. The other people in the spirit field naturally grew discontent.

"Is Senior Brother Ding thinking it's not worth it if it's free? If worst comes to worst, we can pay with spirit rice, but just not showing up like this isn't very good, is it?" someone complained.

"How can that be? He clearly promised us it would be free! Free means free, and he can't just not come! I'll go call him again tonight. I bet it's because you're too soft-spoken, Zhenzhen," Lan Lan, who had left a strong impression on Ding Rui before, said.

Li Yizhen glanced at her two friends and said helplessly, "Since Senior Brother Ding said he has something to do, then he must really have something to do. It's fine, I'll go find him again this evening."

"I'll go with you!" Lan Lan said.

"Alright, you need to go close the gate now. Remember to activate the formation," Li Yizhen said, standing up from the ground and walking towards the spirit field.

Lan Lan, meanwhile, ran towards the entrance of the spirit field. "It's just closing a gate, such a simple task..." Lan Lan muttered as she walked. But just as she reached the gate, she suddenly saw a fresh trail of blood on the path outside!

"Ah! Blood! Come out and look, there's blood outside!" Lan Lan immediately let out a shriek, calling everyone in the spirit field to come see. Coupled with the similar build, she was almost eighty percent certain that the person lying there was Ding Rui!

Li Yizhen rushed out, and Lan Lan and the others were instantly shocked, quickly following suit. Although discovering blood and an injured person within the sect was strange, they also believed that the sect was the safest place. The spirit field areas of every sect were located at the heart of the sect, and these spirit field cultivators were likewise the most protected by the sect!

Li Yizhen ran to the injured person's side and saw that it was indeed Ding Rui. She immediately shouted back, "Hurry, it's Senior Brother Ding! Something has happened in the sect!"

Upon hearing this, Lan Lan and the others were greatly alarmed, their eyes revealing expressions of horror as they quickened their pace again.

"What happened?"

"Oh my heavens, how could Senior Brother Ding be so badly injured? Who hurt him?"

"We need to tell the outer disciples at the management office."

"Lan Lan, you go to the management office. The rest of us will take Senior Brother Ding to the logistics department for medical attention. Sister Mi, please get some medicine from my room," Li Yizhen immediately instructed, and the others began to carry out her orders. As a group of Qi Condensation cultivators, they were completely helpless against such severe injuries. They could only use some medicine for temporary treatment, but it was just a drop in the bucket. They needed to take Ding Rui to the logistics department to receive proper treatment.

"What should we do?"

"Go support them."

"Someone needs to report this. The Pill Hall is the closest, go notify them."

"Alright, let's go over first. Bring all your spirit talismans and talisman brushes, just in case."

A group of outer disciples immediately discussed a plan and then began to act.

"Take this Hydro-healing Pill. It can alleviate pain, prevent the injury from worsening, and is effective against the true essence of most demonic cultivators." An outer disciple popped a pill into Ma Wen's mouth, then said, "You wait here. Someone from the Pill Hall will come to treat you shortly."

"And Ding Rui, he's near Spirit Field number 56!" Ma Wen quickly added.

"Don't worry," the outer disciple said, then turned and ran off.
