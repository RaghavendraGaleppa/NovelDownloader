# Chapter 36: The Capital's Immortal Master  

The two sat down for a long conversation. After Jiang Hu's explanations and personal demonstrations, Lin Shan finally gained a basic understanding of the strength of the early-stage Xiantian realm.  

"What kind of miraculous elixir did you take, kid? To grow to such heights in just a year and a half. The only person I've seen with your level of strength was the Grand Elder!"  

Jiang Hu sighed in amazement, his curiosity about Lin Shan's experiences finally getting the better of him. Initially, he had assumed that even if Lin Shan had reached the Xiantian realm, he would only be at the early stage like himself. Jiang Hu had rarely suffered defeat since childhood and had almost never lost to opponents of the same level.  

That was why he wanted to test Lin Shan's mettle—only to end up getting thoroughly beaten.  

"What? The Grand Elder? At my level?"  

Lin Shan's interest was instantly piqued. Could it be...? Was the Grand Elder of Nightingale like him? Also a...  

"Exactly! The Grand Elder is a senior master of Nightingale, now ninety years old. It's said he stepped into the Xiantian realm at twenty, defeated renowned martial artists across the Central Plains by forty, and by fifty, he dominated the world as one of the rare Xiantian Great Perfection experts!"  

Jiang Hu spoke of the Nightingale's Grand Elder with reverence.  

"When I was young, I went to the capital headquarters for training and was fortunate enough to witness the Grand Elder sparring with a top imperial guard from the palace. The scene was spectacular—blades flashing, sword qi soaring, palm shadows overlapping. Within ten paces, dust and stones flew as if immortals were battling!"  

Recalling the grand spectacle, Jiang Hu couldn't help but feel his blood boil. Back then, he had secretly vowed to become a Xiantian master himself.  

"Oh? Xiantian Great Perfection? Within ten paces? How does that compare to me?" Lin Shan asked, wide-eyed like an eager child.  

"Compared to you... well... uh..."  

Jiang Hu hesitated.  

He had always assumed the Grand Elder, as a Xiantian Great Perfection expert, was naturally the strongest. But after witnessing Lin Shan's three-foot-long sword qi from beyond ten paces—thick and powerful—it seemed comparable to the Grand Elder's Xiantian palm strikes.  

Jiang Hu found himself tangled in confusion, his mind a battlefield of conflicting thoughts.  

Lin Shan could easily tell that the Grand Elder was indeed formidable—but only to a limited extent. At best, he was on par with Lin Shan, certainly not surpassing him. Otherwise, Jiang Hu wouldn't have struggled so much to answer.  

"So, the early Xiantian stage is equivalent to the first layer of Qi Refining, while Xiantian Great Perfection is at most comparable to the peak of the third layer.  

Does that mean martial artists in the mortal world can only reach the early stages of Qi Refining? If I break through to the fourth layer of Qi Refining and enter the mid-stage, then no Xiantian martial artist would stand a chance against me.  

At that point, even storming the imperial palace would be effortless. No one could stop me—heck, I might even sneak a peek at the imperial concubines bathing..."  

Lin Shan's habit of indulging in wild fantasies, which he'd carried over from his previous life, had only grown worse in this new world.  

...  

After a long silence, Jiang Hu suddenly snapped back to reality. "You still haven't told me how you improved so much. Your strength is definitely beyond early Xiantian—have you already reached Great Perfection?"  

It wasn't surprising that Jiang Hu couldn't let it go. The shock had been too great. Though he knew prying into others' secrets was taboo, the sight of someone ascending to such heights in one leap left him unable to resist asking.  

Lin Shan looked innocent. "What if I told you I'm not even Xiantian at all? Would you believe me?"  

To his surprise, the moment those words left his mouth, Jiang Hu shot to his feet, his face flushed with excitement, as if he had just realized something earth-shattering.  

"I believe you!"  

"???"  

Now it was Lin Shan's turn to be stunned. He suddenly realized that the people of Nightingale weren't just prone to exaggerated reactions—their thought processes were also baffling.  

Jiang Hu didn't explain immediately. Instead, he pointed at Manager Jiang, who had been eavesdropping nearby, and ordered, "You—out!"  

"(⊙x⊙)!"  

Manager Jiang was dumbfounded. He had been listening with great interest—why was he suddenly being kicked out?  

But he understood that whatever came next must involve secrets beyond his clearance. Reluctantly, he withdrew, though his curiosity burned fiercely.  

...  

Jiang Hu now spoke with utmost seriousness. "Brother, give it to me straight—are you an immortal cultivator?"  

Lin Shan considered it. Revealing this wasn't a big deal, and Jiang Hu lacked the strength to harm him even if he wanted to. So he nodded.  

"I knew it!"  

Jiang Hu exhaled in relief, thinking to himself, *Of course! I've never lost to someone of the same level—this doesn't count! The opponent was cheating—it's not my fault.*  

No wonder this kid had become so powerful in just a year and a half. He must have stumbled upon immortal cultivation somewhere. If he was a cultivator, everything made sense.  

"How did you know that immortal cultivators truly exist in this world?"  

Lin Shan's curiosity kept growing. He had only learned of cultivators after witnessing the battle between Thunderclap and the Black Lotus Sect's protector in the Yelang Ancient Tomb. He hadn't expected Jiang Hu, who spent his days secluded in Zangke City, to know as well.  

But Jiang Hu's next words nearly knocked him off his feet.  

"Because Nightingale's headquarters enshrines an immortal master!"  

"!!!"  

Lin Shan was genuinely shocked this time. "Seriously?"  

"Of course! Why would I lie? And I've seen him with my own eyes!"  

*Is there anything you haven't seen?*  

Lin Shan couldn't help but feel exasperated. Jiang Hu always spoke in fragments—why couldn't he just say everything at once?  

"Though I don't know exactly what abilities this immortal master possesses, the Grand Elder seems to hold him in high regard, fulfilling every request he makes. And..."  

Jiang Hu's expression turned peculiar, as if recalling something, but he didn't continue.  

"And what?"  

Lin Shan was overjoyed to hear news of an immortal cultivator, but his impression of Nightingale was worsening. Aside from their dramatic tendencies, their habit of speaking in half-sentences was making him increasingly impatient.  

"You'll find out when you get there." Jiang Hu avoided further discussion about the immortal master and instead made a proposal.  

"Since you're a cultivator, would you be interested in visiting Nightingale's headquarters to meet him? I've just reached the Xiantian realm and plan to report to the capital. We could travel together."  

*Ah, so that's what this is about.*  

Now Lin Shan understood why Jiang Hu had asked if he was a cultivator and whether he wanted to go to the capital—it was all to secure a travel companion.  

"Nightingale's headquarters in the capital isn't just home to the immortal master—it's also incredibly prosperous. With your status, you could have anything you desire—power, beauties...  

*Ahem.* Coincidentally, I have a rival at headquarters. It's because of him that I was exiled to this godforsaken Southern Frontier..."  

Jiang Hu was straightforward, unable to keep things to himself. He accidentally blurted out his true thoughts and immediately regretted it, looking embarrassed.  

Lin Shan was speechless. *With a personality like yours, it's no surprise you lost in internal conflicts.* Still, to be safe, he asked cautiously, "What's your rival's cultivation level?"  

"Don't worry—I'm no weaker than him now. We're both early-stage Xiantian." Jiang Hu thumped his chest confidently, then added, "But he's an expert at flattery. He even recognized the headquarters' immortal master as his godfather..."  

"Pfft—!"  

Lin Shan spat out the tea he had just sipped.
