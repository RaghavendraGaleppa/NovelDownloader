# Chapter 55: The Desiccated Corpse

A massive mountain peak, transported by the giant tortoise's *Mountain Moving* divine ability, was hurled as a weapon!

The earth's veins were severed, and a colossal underground river erupted, churning the surroundings into darkness and shaking the very earth. Even Han Yue, observing the battle from ten kilometers away, was blown back dozens of meters by the resulting shockwave!

Yet, the enormous mountain lacked any magical reinforcement. Though terrifying in might, it was shattered by Tu Sheng's *Abyssal Heavy Sword* with a single slash! The tortoise had succeeded in interrupting Tu Sheng's momentum-building process—this strike had consumed much of the accumulated energy in the *Abyssal Heavy Sword*.

But Tu Sheng remained unperturbed. Against a great demon like this tortoise—strong in defense but lacking agility—building up sword momentum was almost effortless. Moreover, Tu Sheng had long mastered the art of *Borrowing Momentum* and wielding the *Abyssal Heavy Sword*. He could precisely control the sword's power, releasing just enough force to cleave through the mountain, and even reclaim some of it amidst the collision and explosion!

From Han Yue's distant vantage point, Tu Sheng's great sword was omnipresent, cutting down everything in its path. Mountains were split, cliffs sundered—the tortoise was battered and bruised. Yet the tortoise fought back relentlessly, summoning peak after peak to hurl at Tu Sheng, only for each to be shattered by his blade.

The surrounding landscape was in chaos. What was once a lush, verdant primeval forest had become a scene of apocalyptic devastation—mountains crumbled, trees uprooted, boulders sent flying. Han Yue watched, his blood boiling with excitement. This battle between third-rank powerhouses, where arcane might clashed with divine abilities, was nothing short of spectacular. *This* was the image of true cultivators and their boundless power he had always envisioned!

One side was a supreme expert from a great sect, peerless in his realm. The other, an ancient demon of immense experience and formidable means. Compared to these two, the third-rank great ape that had slaughtered the Butcher's Market was nothing but a paper tiger, unworthy of its rank. Han Yue couldn't muster even a shred of courage to challenge either of these titans. He knew that even if he mustered all his strength and unleashed his most powerful strike, he wouldn't be able to kill either of them.

Gradually, the power of the *Abyssal Heavy Sword* grew ever stronger. The tortoise's flesh could no longer withstand the slashes, and it had long since activated its second divine ability—*Primordial Shield*! This was one of the most common defensive abilities among turtle-type demons, converting mana into an extraordinarily resilient barrier.

Now, the *Abyssal Heavy Sword* struck the shield again and again. Each blow sent the kilometer-long tortoise skidding back dozens of meters. Though the shield hadn't shattered yet, Han Yue could see it trembling under the relentless assault—the tortoise was on the brink of collapse.

The tortoise, too, keenly felt the terror of this swordsman. In its thousand years of cultivation, this was one of the few times it had genuinely sensed the threat of death. It attempted to flee westward, to escape this sudden battle, but each time it tried to take flight, the *Abyssal Heavy Sword* would slam it back to the ground. It could only retreat step by step.

Finally recognizing Tu Sheng's origins, the tortoise spoke up:  
"You, a disciple of the Green Lotus Sword Sect—why must you meddle in the affairs of the Divine Thunder Palace? I am a Holy Son under the Great Sage *Xuanli Tortoise*, bestowed with a life-preserving treasure by the Great Sage himself! If you push me, I will sacrifice it to drag you down with me! Kill me, and my ancestor will slaughter every disciple of your sect in vengeance!"

Under the pressure of impending death, the tortoise was now trying to negotiate.  
"You senile old turtle, spouting nonsense!" Tu Sheng scoffed. "Your Great Sage ancestor was already cursed to death by the Annihilation Immortal! Even if he were alive, do you think he'd bother coming to Guizhou to kill my disciples? Everyone knows *Xuanli Tortoise* is the laziest of the fourth-rank demons—he wouldn't even open his eyes if a blade touched his forehead!"

Tu Sheng remained unmoved. The *Abyssal Heavy Sword* struck again and again, its power growing with each blow. Now, just a few slashes were enough to send the kilometer-long tortoise tumbling for kilometers.  

"You lie! My ancestor can regenerate from a single drop of blood, immortal and indestructible! His defensive abilities are peerless! No one in this realm could kill him!" The old tortoise nearly lost its composure at Tu Sheng's words. It had been slumbering here for ages—tortoises were long-lived and sluggish by nature—and had no idea what major events had transpired in the *Jade Sky Realm*. Hearing that its ancestor had been cursed to death was like a bolt from the blue.  

Its will to fight shattered, the tortoise now focused solely on fleeing westward under Tu Sheng's relentless assault. The two figures—one chasing, one fleeing—gradually vanished into the distance, leaving behind only the scars of their battle.  

Han Yue didn't follow them. Instead, he rode his light beam to the spot where the tortoise had been resting before the battle. Beneath where the giant creature had lain was a small, inconspicuous cave. In the midst of the devastation, such a tiny opening would have gone unnoticed—but Han Yue, acutely sensitive to thunder energy, had detected a steady, pulsing source of lightning power from within.  

It resonated faintly with the *Nourishing Thunder* energy in his body, drawing him in. Now that the battle had moved elsewhere, Han Yue finally had the chance to investigate.  

He activated his thread armor to its maximum defense and cautiously entered the dark cave. Inside, he found a massive piece of tortoiseshell—over a hundred meters wide. Judging by its size, the tortoise it had belonged to must have been several thousand meters long.  

Embedded in the center of the shell was a desiccated human corpse. The corpse, tall and lanky, was sunken into the shell from the chest down to above the knees. Only skin and bones remained, but at its heart, a faint thread of thunder energy pulsed rhythmically—the very energy that had drawn Han Yue here.  

As he approached to examine it, he made a startling discovery:  
*The corpse was still alive.*  

Only at extremely close range could Han Yue sense it—the faintest flicker of life remained. The corpse's heart, sustained by the thunder energy, beat at an agonizingly slow pace. Sensing Han Yue's presence, the corpse's lips even twitched slightly.  

After careful consideration, Han Yue extended his right hand. From his dantian, he extracted a single drop of *Heavenly Nectar* and flicked it into the corpse's mouth.  

Instantly, the life essence within the *Nectar* was absorbed by the parched corpse. Han Yue watched as the corpse's skin gained the slightest hint of vitality.  

He fed it another drop.  
Again, it was devoured instantly.  

The corpse was like a bottomless pit. A single drop of *Heavenly Nectar* required significant effort for Han Yue to refine—yet here, it vanished without a trace.
