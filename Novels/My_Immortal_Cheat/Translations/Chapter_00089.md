# Chapter 89: The Lich King?

After an unknown amount of time, Zhou Tian awoke from his slumber. He rubbed his eyes, wiped away some drool, and felt a bit more refreshed. He opened his Undying System and took a look; the resurrection count hadn't reset yet, meaning less than 24 hours had passed since his last resurrection.

The sun's position in the sky had changed, now very close to the horizon. But strangely, the intensity of the light remained unchanged, no matter where it was in the sky.

"You're truly bold, daring to sleep on me. Aren't you afraid I'd stab you to death with a spear?" Musu's indifferent voice came. His body was ramrod straight, exactly as he was before Zhou Tian fell asleep.

Zhou Tian smiled, finding Musu somewhat interesting. He stretched and replied, "You didn't stab me to death, did you? Just for this act of letting me use you as a pillow, I can help you once in the future."

"Hmph, help me? Who was it that sought help first?" Musu said disdainfully.

"That doesn't count. Do you want the help I'm offering or not?"

"With your frail mortal body?" Musu had just sensed that Zhou Tian was indeed a mortal, not hiding his cultivation.

"Yes, with my frail mortal body," Zhou Tian said calmly.

Musu fell silent. Although he wanted to retort sharply to Zhou Tian, a certain feeling from deep within prevented him from speaking.

"If you don't speak, I'll take that as a denial," Zhou Tian said.

*Denial? Isn't that an acknowledgement?* Musu was choked with exasperation. After a moment, he said coldly, "This is something you owe me!"

Zhou Tian chuckled, "Haha, you stubborn tsundere, I can certainly deal with you."

Black lines covered Musu's handsome face, and veins bulged slightly on his hands. If not for the invisible line drawn by his upbringing since childhood, he would have long since stabbed Zhou Tian to death with his spear. He could act against evil heretics, but he couldn't bring himself to harm a mortal, even if this mortal was very "evil."

"Captain Musu, have any strange things happened nearby recently?" After this exchange of banter, Zhou Tian felt their relationship had grown much closer, enough to be considered friends. So he began to inquire,

"Heretics are becoming increasingly active." Musu's voice was still cold.

"That doesn't count. I mean things you've never seen before, like thunder from a clear sky, or people falling from the air," Zhou Tian asked cautiously.

"..." *You could just say the high-altitude explosion a few days ago.* Musu was speechless.

"Are you with them?"

"How could that be?" Zhou Tian denied. "I have a great enemy among them. If I find them, I'll definitely ride them down and whip them. How could I be with them?"

Musu always felt there was something off about Zhou Tian's words, but he couldn't pinpoint what was wrong at the moment. He snorted coldly and said, "If you are with them, then I will have reason to act against you."

"After the large explosion high in the sky, many people fell down. Many heretics in the wilderness tried to take advantage of the chaos, and several major battles occurred. Later, many Archbishops also rushed over and fought for a while, capturing some people, but more escaped. After that, the other side's reinforcements also arrived, and after a few more battles, both sides ceased hostilities."

*Captured some people?* Zhou Tian's heart tightened, and he quickly asked, "Were any women captured? My great enemy is hidden among those women!"

Musu turned his head to look at him, then turned back, because he found that due to their close proximity, making eye contact with a strange man at such close range made him a little uncomfortable.

"No, it's said that most of them were bald men, without hair. There was only one woman, whose calves were thicker than your waist. Is she your enemy?"

"No..." While feeling a chill, Zhou Tian also breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed Tian Ling was not in danger.

He silently prayed for a moment for those bald 'big brothers'. He wasn't sure why, but it seemed the major powers of Jiuzhou always held a certain prejudice against Buddhist forces. At that time, the Celestial King mighty expert of the Tool Kingdom self-detonated to buy them time, and the Dao Alliance mighty expert did the same. They couldn't just let their people be captured. The mighty experts of the Light Organization and Tian Qin were still there; they definitely wouldn't stand by and watch their own people be taken. The other side also sent many people; if no one was left behind, they wouldn't agree. It was likely that the bald-headed sect's people were treated as pawns. This wasn't hard to guess; Zhou Tian's mind quickly processed this information.

"Can you tell me, what are you going to do?" Zhou Tian felt Musu seemed a little different, and the scale of his questions was growing. Unlike their initial cold exchanges, Musu didn't speak. Zhou Tian looked at the back of his head, unable to see his expression. Perhaps feeling that Zhou Tian, a mortal, posed no threat, or for some other reason, Musu finally spoke: "The Lord has delivered a Holy Edict. Holy Envoys are about to descend, and all Holy Sons and Holy Daughters must be sent there to find suitable vessels."

*Holy Edict? Holy Envoys descending?* Zhou Tian frowned. It seemed the aim of these divine realm remnants this time was not as simple as targeting their younger generation. Daring to issue a Holy Edict meant that the surviving divine lords were almost openly revealing their intentions. Jiuzhou had many reasons for keeping these divine realm remnants, the most important being to monitor the surviving divine lords through their followers. For so many years, those beings had acted as if they had completely abandoned the God-Forsaken Land, no longer even accepting or responding to the power of faith. Yet this time, they directly issued a divine edict. Zhou Tian didn't believe the people of Jiuzhou wouldn't detect these actions. It seemed there were many hidden things at play. Zhou Tian rubbed his brow; guessing at such schemes was too brain-consuming. However, sensing Musu's tone, he asked strangely, "Your Lord hasn't issued a Holy Edict for a long time, right? You should be very happy about this one."

"Do you know? Just for that phrase, 'your Lord,' I should stab you to death with my spear," Musu said in a deep voice. Before Zhou Tian could respond, he continued in a strange tone, "The Lord hasn't responded to prayers for a very long time. Everyone is very happy about this Holy Edict. Father is very happy, Saintess Beina is very happy, and I... am also very happy."

Zhou Tian chuckled. Musu was indeed very interesting. *Happy?* That was hardly the tone of someone who was happy. "Haha, Captain Musu, now I don't just want to help you once."

Musu frowned slightly. "What do you mean by that?"

"What do I mean? Do you know the Lich King?" Zhou Tian was slowly outlining the ideas in his mind. It was only a rudimentary form now, but just thinking about it made him excited.

"The Lich King? Is that an evil god?"

"No, not at all. He's an upright knight, just like you!" Zhou Tian's tone was very sincere, incredibly sincere!
