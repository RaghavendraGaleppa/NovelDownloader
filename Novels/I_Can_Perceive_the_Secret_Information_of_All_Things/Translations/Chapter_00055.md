**Chapter 55: Gossip Square**  

Taigu City.  

Xiao Ji arrived by floating boat and had already disembarked. This time, he was prepared for a long stay—at least until he resolved the issue of obtaining a Foundation Establishment Pill. Before leaving, he had spent two days helping Lin Musheng acclimate to his surroundings and pointed out the fluctuations in spiritual energy during his cultivation.  

Taigu City remained unchanged. Celestial birds still danced across the sky, mighty cultivators soared on their magical artifacts, and the floating boat docks bustled with activity as always. It truly felt like a world apart from the mundane realm.  

After entering the city, the first order of business was securing lodging. Xiao Ji had no intention of sleeping on the streets, even if it would save him some spirit stones. His philosophy was different—he firmly believed wealth wasn’t amassed through mere frugality.  

After scouting several streets and comparing prices and environments, he learned that inns along the main thoroughfare, Tongtian Street, were 30% more expensive than those on other streets. In the end, he settled on the Ascending Dragon Inn at the end of Feisheng Street.  

The Ascending Dragon Inn had a dragon’s head banner hanging at its entrance, and the attendant outside periodically called out, "Stay with us and get free breakfast!" Coupled with the inn’s decent environment, dining services in the main hall, and the most affordable prices, there was no reason not to stay there, especially given his tight budget.  

With a place to stay secured, Xiao Ji wandered toward the main street.  

He had three objectives for this trip: obtain a Foundation Establishment Pill, find a long-term method to earn spirit stones in Taigu City, and visit famous spots like the auction house and the dueling arena. To make progress efficiently, he decided to head to Gossip Square.  

Xiao Ji had visited Gossip Square before, but only briefly. It was a gathering place for many cultivators, where all sorts of rumors and news circulated. The square had four walls, each plastered with various announcements and hearsay.  

Each wall also bore a wooden plaque categorizing the content: *Cultivation World*, *Jianghu Tales*, *Mortal Flavors*, and *Demons and Rogues*.  

The sections were highly specialized. *Mortal Flavors*, for instance, covered mundane dynastic affairs—wars between nations, peasant uprisings, or eccentric rulers who preferred craftsmanship over beauties.  

*Cultivation World* focused on stories of cultivators—geniuses joining sects, tribulations overcome, or the notorious sea dragons of the East causing havoc.  

*Jianghu Tales* was a mixed bag, featuring both mortal martial artists and cultivators who dabbled in demon-slaying.  

*Demons and Rogues*, as the name suggested, detailed the exploits of demons and malevolent spirits.  

Originally, the news came from cultivators who gathered to share their adventures over drinks. Over time, this gave rise to a profession known as "Fast-Talkers"—cultivators who made a living by gathering and spreading information. They became a primary source of gossip in various cities.  

Eventually, Fast-Talkers became inseparable from cultivation cities. A city without a Gossip Square and professional news coverage was deemed subpar, inevitably suffering from reduced foot traffic. This led to the emergence of specialized Fast-Talker sects—ones no one dared to provoke.  

Take the infamous *Secrets Unveiled Sect*, for example. No one wanted to cross them. If they took a dislike to someone, a few embellished lines in their records could tarnish a reputation across the entire cultivation world.  

A case in point:  

A disciple of the Divine Fist Sect once clashed with a Fast-Talker over a spiritual spring they both wanted to soak their feet in. The Fast-Talker lost the scuffle.  

That night, the Fast-Talker penned an article titled *"Divine Fist Sect Disciple Prefers Foot Baths Over Fists"* and disseminated it across major cities. The misleading headline sparked widespread debate, causing such a stir that the Divine Fist Sect struggled to recruit new disciples for years.  

Once a second-rate sect, they plummeted to fourth-rate.  

But such is the nature of gossip—eventually, the spotlight shifts, and new scandals take over. The news on the walls was periodically updated, with hotter topics pushing older ones aside.  

Of course, Gossip Square wasn’t just for entertainment. It also offered practical information—bounty notices for slaying certain demons, reports of rampaging monsters, and most importantly, price trends in the cultivation world. Though not entirely accurate, these provided a rough guide to avoid being swindled.  

To Xiao Ji, the greatest value of Gossip Square lay in its concentration of cultivators. The more cultivators gathered, the better it was for him.  

After browsing dozens of posts, he realized he was wasting time and refocused on his mission.  

Just as he began searching for leads on Foundation Establishment Pills, a few headlines in the *Cultivation World* section caught his eye:  

*"Human Elder Helped by Demon: A Loss of Demon Nature or an Awakening of Demon Virtue?"*  

Though seemingly trivial, this was significant. It not only suggested that demons could be benevolent but also highlighted the courage of this particular demon, providing ample evidence for those who advocated educating demons over exterminating them.  

Even more shocking was the bold-font headline:  

*"Incredible Luck: Ancient Immortal Forest’s Demon-Subduing Sect Secretly Recruits a Natural Dao Seed"*  

Upon reading, Xiao Ji realized the Demon-Subduing Sect had intended to quietly nurture this prodigy and unveil him at a critical moment—only for a Fast-Talker to expose the scheme.  

And the so-called "Natural Dao Seed" was none other than Lu Zha, the child Xiao Ji had helped deliver and even named.  

After indulging in the gossip, Xiao Ji turned his attention to Foundation Establishment Pills.  

The *"Market Guide for Synthetic Foundation Establishment Pills"* mentioned that a single pill currently cost between 8,000 to 30,000 low-grade yellow spirit stones—a wide range due to varying quality. Inferior pills were cheaper but had lower success rates, while high-quality ones were pricier but more reliable.  

This was just a reference, though. For precise figures, he’d need to check the auction house. Still, even the cheapest pill at 8,000 stones was beyond his means. The small gang he’d wiped out had only yielded a little over 300 yellow spirit stones.  

Synthetic Foundation Establishment Pills were condensed pills infused with Foundation Establishment elixir, convenient to consume and the most common type on the market. Xiao Ji was keen to get his hands on one.  

"Tough nut to crack," he muttered, unsure how to proceed.  

But soon, an opportunity presented itself.
