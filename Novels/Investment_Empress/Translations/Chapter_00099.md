Chapter 99: He's a Born Killer!

Inside the government office.

Looking at his sister, who seemed to have suffered a great injustice, Luo Yu felt a throbbing headache: "How did you end up here?"

"I... um..." Luo Yao stuttered.

"Did Father and Mother know about this?" Luo Yu asked.

"They... of course, they knew," Luo Yao replied, still stuttering.

Luo Yu furrowed his brow: "I'll write a letter to Father and Mother to ask what's going on."

Luo Yao burst into louder sobs, her body covered in dirt, looking as miserable as possible. "I'm going to die! I'm so miserable! You're a bad brother!"

Luo Yu's lips twitched. He could see that his sister was crying with a hint of pretence, secretly glancing at him to see if he was worried.

He was familiar with his sister's tactics.

However, the Thorne Jade Forest disciples beside them advised, "Chief, Luo Yao has realized her mistake, so let's not pursue it further."

"Anyone who dares to harm our people must pay the price; otherwise, they'll think we're just gentle Confucian scholars with no temper."

One of the senior disciples pulled out a thick book, "Analects of the Sages," with iron corners that glinted with a cold light. "As a senior brother, I've studied the classics and will reason with those who bullied you."

Luo Yu thought to himself, "You're making things worse; isn't the city already chaotic enough?"

Just then, a messenger announced, "The Prefect requests an audience."

After the announcement, Cui, the Prefect, was ushered in. "I'm sorry that the young miss was wronged; it's this prefecture's fault."

"Did you see the culprit's face?" he asked.

Luo Yao replied, "It was Night Ghost, Liu Heng."

Upon hearing the name, the crowd's expressions turned cold.

It turned out that Liu Heng was seeking revenge after the Thorne Jade Forest had exterminated the Night Ghost Sect.

Cui's eyes flickered as he glanced at the "Gentleman's Brush" in Luo Yao's hand: "I know a bit about this Liu Heng. He's a mysterious figure, usually active at night."

"We'll send people to investigate," Cui promised.

Luo Yao shook her head: "He's already dead."

The crowd's excited expressions froze, and they thought, "You're crying so loudly, and now you're saying he's dead?"

However, upon further thought, they realized that if Liu Heng hadn't died, Luo Yao wouldn't be back.

Cui raised an eyebrow: "Who killed Liu Heng?"

Luo Yao thought for a moment before saying, "Do you know the Northwest Hammer King?"

The crowd looked at each other in confusion; they had never heard of such a person.

Luo Yu shook his head: "I've never heard of him either."

"What about the Hard Gang?" Luo Yao asked.

The crowd remained silent, thinking that the name sounded made-up.

Luo Yao continued, "He wore a cyan dragon mask, and his voice was very pleasant to listen to. When he wielded his hammer, he was very handsome... like a firefly in the dark, standing out vividly."

Luo Yao's eyes sparkled as she spoke.

The senior disciples looked on, slightly displeased.

Cui frowned and then relaxed: "If the young miss wants to thank her savior, I'll instruct my men to keep an eye out."

Luo Yao nodded enthusiastically.

Luo Yu warned his sister, "Don't go out alone; now that the Prefect has promised, you don't need to seek out the savior yourself."

Luo Yu then turned to Cui: "I've been reviewing the recent case files and noticed that many children have gone missing in the city."

"The number has increased dramatically since the start of the Unbounded Trial; you should take this seriously, Prefect."

Cui stopped at the door, his back to the crowd, and remained silent for a few moments before saying, "Thank you, young master, for your concern."

...

In a dark chamber.

Cui examined a booklet, lost in thought as he read the names on it, including the "Huai Mountain Three Evils."

Smiling Bodhisattva had mentioned that the three individuals were known as Dragon, Tiger, and Leopard.

The Dragon, who wielded a hammer, was likely the eldest of the three, known as Dragon Evil.

Cui thought to himself, "He's capable of killing Liu Heng, who was at the Mystical Dan Realm. I underestimated him."

Cui gritted his teeth, "Liu Heng deserved to die! He almost ruined me!"

He thought about Luo Yao, the beloved daughter of the Thorne Jade Forest's master, Luo Yu Shu, a prominent Confucian scholar and a fellow student of the current emperor.

If Luo Yao had died, and the "Gentleman's Brush" had fallen into his hands...

Just thinking about it sent shivers down his spine.

"Judge," a subordinate appeared.

"Have they found Liu Heng's body?" Cui asked.

"It was found, but it had disintegrated into ashes, leaving no remains or clues," the subordinate replied.

Cui relaxed and nodded in approval: "The Dragon Evil is meticulous; he's a natural-born killer."

The only drawback was his choice of weapon; a hammer wasn't typical for a killer.

"Send a message to Smiling Bodhisattva, asking him to focus on the Huai Mountain Three Evils," Cui instructed.

"Yes, sir."

"Have you found Jiang Chu Long?" Cui asked.

"We found him, but Mei Yun is still missing," the subordinate replied.

"It doesn't matter; I'll see how long she can hide," Cui said with a cold smile.

After dismissing his subordinate, Cui opened a namebook.

Many names on the list had disappeared.

He found it strange; the Unbounded Trial was losing participants at an alarming rate.

At this rate, the trial would be over soon...
