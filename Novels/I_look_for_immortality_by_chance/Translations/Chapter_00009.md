# Chapter 9: Planting the Eternal Verdant Diagram

That night, a small island named "Guest Welcoming Isle" behind Qingfeng Mountain welcomed a new visitor.

Guest Welcoming Isle served as Qingfeng Dao Academy's reception area for ordinary guests. Lush with trees and serene in atmosphere, the island was dotted with elegant bamboo courtyards, creating a picturesque scene.

At this moment, Gu Yuan was resting in one such bamboo courtyard, which would be his residence for the next half month. The courtyard was meticulously maintained by servants year-round, allowing him to move in immediately.

After a brief inspection, Gu Yuan entered the meditation chamber at the rear of the courtyard. Sitting cross-legged and focusing his mind, he exhaled deeply before closing his eyes. As he regulated his breathing, faint green lights flickered across his skin. When he opened his eyes again, a pleased expression appeared on his face.

"Truly worthy of a renowned sect. Even this ordinary island's spiritual energy surpasses the inner sanctum of Qingmu Sect."

In this world of cultivation, spiritual veins were paramount. Generally, a low-grade first-order spiritual vein sufficed for Qi Refinement cultivators' daily practice, while a high-grade first-order vein could enhance cultivation. Foundation Establishment cultivators typically required second-order spiritual veins, and so on.

Qingmu Sect, where Gu Yuan originated, possessed only one low-grade second-order spiritual vein at its main peak's ancestral hall, with the rest being mid-grade first-order veins. Though Guest Welcoming Isle was merely an ordinary island of Qingfeng Dao Academy, far inferior to Qingfeng Mountain's spiritual veins, its spiritual energy had reached second-order level—equivalent to cultivating in Qingmu Sect's ancestral hall.

"The toilets in first-tier cities are indeed more valuable than houses in county towns..." Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh inwardly at the stark contrast. No wonder the token in Demon Star Grotto had manifested as half a strand of golden opportunity. Just the disciple benefits here already surpassed countless cultivators, not to mention the immense protection offered by Qingfeng Dao Academy's profound foundations.

This thought suddenly sparked another idea: "Wait, if merely joining Qingfeng Dao Academy offers such benefits, how incredible would the advantages be from becoming the favored disciple of a Golden Core master?"

Once this notion took root, it grew like weeds in Gu Yuan's mind. His mysterious stone liquid could reveal "opportunities" and "solutions" to pressing matters—perhaps it could facilitate such an unlikely scenario.

"Enough! This is absurd thinking!" Gu Yuan shook his head vigorously, realizing the impracticality. Suppressing these distracting thoughts with dozens of recitations of Qingmu Sect's Heart-Cleansing Mantra, he refocused on his immediate priority: converting his cultivation technique to fully integrate into Qingfeng Dao Academy.

Earlier that day, under Qiu Mingshan's guidance, Gu Yuan had registered at Qianjiao Academy and selected the most compatible true diagram from three options:

1. The Toad Moon Divine Light Diagram—visualizing a golden toad worshiping the moon to absorb solar and lunar essences, following the path of yin and yang.
2. The Five Elements Wheel Diagram—incorporating the five elements to refine the five viscera, following the path of elemental balance.

"Both diagrams are profoundly mystical, but my current cultivation stems from Qingmu Sect's Ten Thousand Wood Technique, with all my spiritual power aligned with wood. Converting to either would be inefficient." At twenty years old, Gu Yuan couldn't afford delays. The optimal choice was cultivating the Eternal Verdant Diagram to swiftly transition techniques before breaking through to the fifth layer of Qi Refinement.

This world's cultivation system was unique—no five-element spiritual roots, only the concepts of nine orifices and dao bodies. All humans could cultivate, but their talents varied dramatically. Ancient geniuses with nine fully open orifices could absorb ninety percent of spiritual energy, making cultivation effortless. Ordinary people, lacking even a single orifice (known as Hundred-Leak Bodies), comprised ninety-nine percent of the population.

Gu Yuan possessed five orifices, qualifying him as an inner court disciple at Qingfeng Dao Academy. The academy categorized disciples into three tiers: outer court (below five orifices), inner court (five or more), and true disciples (seven orifices or special dao bodies under Golden Core or Dao Embryo masters).

The cultivation hierarchy progressed through nine Qi Refinement layers, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Dao Embryo, and Celestial Spirit—with possibly higher realms unknown to Gu Yuan. Currently, his immediate goal was breaking through to the fifth Qi Refinement layer, which would grant spiritual sense—a significant enhancement for exploration, combat, artifact forging, and alchemy.

Unfolding the translucent green jade paper, Gu Yuan studied the Eternal Verdant Diagram intently. This replica from the Transmission Hall contained the true diagram's essence but would disintegrate in fifteen days. Failure to comprehend it within this period would require purchasing another copy.

The jade paper depicted a vibrant green seed the size of a rice grain, surrounded by misty gray fog representing both oppressive soil and flowing vitality. As Gu Yuan focused, his consciousness merged with the seed, experiencing its struggle to break through the spiritual "soil" of heaven and earth to achieve eternal verdancy.

This profound method—where the cultivator's body became the seed, sprout, and eventually towering tree—enabled continuous spiritual energy absorption. Superior to Qingmu Sect's technique that absorbed one unit of energy per cycle, this diagram could absorb three units continuously through meditation.

However, the transformation process was agonizing. Gu Yuan's consciousness, compressed into the seed's confines, battled suffocating darkness and isolation. His first attempt ended in failure as instinctive fear overwhelmed him. The jade paper's spiritual essence had visibly dimmed—too many failures would exhaust it prematurely.

Drawing on his resilience forged through two lifetimes and the Demon Star Grotto ordeal, Gu Yuan steeled himself. "Again!" he resolved, gripping the jade paper tightly as night deepened. The path of cultivation ultimately relied on personal perseverance.
