# Chapter 404: Cultivation

Only a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator.

The mocking laughter of the disciple on duty echoed from behind, piercing the silence of the mountains.

As Xu Yunfan descended the mountain, he recalled everything he had witnessed in the Primordial Origin Sect over the past few days. He now understood why the outside world called the Primordial Origin Sect a demonic sect.

Those who dwelled here were not seekers of the Dao, but a group of twisted demons with shattered moral compasses. They fed on the suffering of their fellow disciples as fuel for their cultivation. Harming others without benefiting oneself was the law of survival, and betraying trust was as common as daily meals.

In this demonic lair, the more insane one was, the better one thrived.

But since he had chosen this path, there was no turning back.

Xu Yunfan clenched his fists, his gaze fixed firmly in the direction of the Joyous Courtyard in the northeast corner of the Hundred Desires Peak.

In the Primordial Origin Sect, to survive, one must be more ruthless and cunning than anyone else.

As night deepened, a faint mist rose from the Hundred Desires Peak, shrouding the dark corners in even greater mystery. Xu Yunfan’s figure gradually vanished into the mist, leaving only the bronze bells on the eaves of the Scripture Pavilion ringing clearly in the wind, as if mocking yet another pitiful soul who had fallen into the Primordial Origin Sect's trap.

The lingering resonance of the bronze bells still echoed through the mountains as twilight fell.

Disciple Zhao San hummed a tune as he walked down the stone steps, tossing the jade tablet containing today's contribution points in his hand. Although the duty at the Scripture Pavilion offered little profit—only six contribution points a day, a pittance compared to the life-risking sect missions—it was safe. He didn't have to worry about being stabbed in the back by a fellow disciple. What was even better was that he got to watch the "colorful" expressions of new disciples every day.

Watching them go from hope to despair brought a twisted pleasure that was far more satisfying than earning a few extra contribution points.

He had just turned a corner on the mountain path when a piercing chill suddenly struck the back of his neck.

"Who—?"

A fist, carrying the sound of tearing wind, smashed into his temple. His protective true energy shattered like a bubble, leaving him to take the blow squarely.

Zhao San’s vision exploded in a crimson haze. The true energy in his body instantly dispersed, and he collapsed into the roadside bushes like a torn sack.

Through the haze, he saw Xu Yunfan crouching down. With a flash of ten fingers, the three storage bags at his waist were snatched away.

"You were laughing quite happily earlier, Senior Brother?"

A wisp of dark golden true energy ignited at Xu Yunfan's fingertip and was ruthlessly thrust into Zhao San's Dantian. "Three hundred contribution points just to let me look at a few erotic paintings?"

Zhao San convulsed violently like a shrimp, black blood oozing from his seven orifices. He discovered in horror that the True Martial Subduing Demon True Energy Xu Yunfan was injecting was rampaging through his meridians. Like a millstone, it was grinding his Hundred Desires True Energy, cultivated over many years, into dust.

He wanted to scream for mercy, but a hand as strong as an iron clamp clamped down on his throat.

"Rest assured, you will die quickly and without pain," Xu Yunfan whispered into his ear, his voice colder than the mountain wind. "Senior Brother, we are disciples of the Demonic Sect, all drowning in the sea of suffering, all struggling. Why do things that harm others without benefiting yourself? Look, this is the outcome."

With a snap, the third vertebra of his spine was shattered by a finger strike. The Subduing Demon True Energy swept back the true energy Zhao San had painstakingly cultivated over the years. His body collapsed into the pile of rotting leaves like mud, his life force rapidly dissipating until he turned into dry, dusty remains scattered in the forest.

Xu Yunfan weighed his spoils: three bottles of Jade Marrow Heart Nurturing Pills, seventy contribution points, and a jade slip inscribed with *Introduction to Array Formations*.

Footsteps sounded in the distance. His figure blurred and merged into the fog, leaving only Zhao San's broken body slowly sinking into silence in the forest.

Xu Yunfan moved like a ghost along the mountain path, his toes touching the moss without disturbing a single dewdrop.

Back in his stone room, he frowned slightly and activated his Martial Dao Heavenly Eye. Golden light flowed in his pupils, reflecting every minute fluctuation within a hundred-meter radius. The trembling of a spiderweb in the corner, the trajectory of dust falling between roof tiles, and even the heartbeat of insects dormant deep in the earth were all laid bare under the Martial Dao Heavenly Eye.

Confirming he was safe, he took out the jade slip glowing with a faint green light from his chest.

Although *Introduction to Array Formations* was only an introductory text, the "Spirit Gathering Array" recorded within made his eyes light up. The array principles recorded were extremely useful for beginners and Qi Refining cultivators.

However, the array formations constructed were incredibly complex. The spiritual energy output for every rune had to be precise to the "microscopic level." If one was slightly careless, the consequences ranged from the array rebounding to the explosion of spiritual energy that could shatter one's soul.

"Kun position three turns, Li fire gives birth to the lotus..."

Xu Yunfan muttered the array incantation, his ten fingers tracing the air in front of him. Dark golden true energy seeped from his fingertips, but it suddenly twisted when he tried to condense the third array foundation.

The threads of true energy hit an invisible barrier, tearing the air with a harsh sound like ripping silk. The free-floating spiritual energy in the air seemed to be ignited, exploding around him with a muffled boom that echoed throughout the courtyard.

He grunted, a metallic taste filling his nose. He wiped the blood flowing from his nostrils, his eyes shining.

"Interesting..."

With his current physique, he was actually shaken enough to suffer minor internal injuries.

In the next instant, the *True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra* roared into motion within Xu Yunfan's body. A blinding golden light burst from his spinal column, and true energy rushed like a river through his four limbs and hundred bones. Turtle-shell patterns appeared on his muscles, and a humming sound resembling a Buddhist chant echoed from deep within his flesh and blood. The tiny cracks caused by the array's rebound visibly healed and returned to normal in the flow of the mysterious true energy.

He recovered in a single breath. Xu Yunfan's expression returned to normal as he continued to contemplate this *Introduction to Array Formations*.

*You are contemplating the Introduction to Array Formations, and you seem to have gained some insight...*

*You attempted to arrange a Spirit Gathering Array, but failed. You gained a small amount of experience.*

Xu Yunfan glanced at the prompt on the attribute panel in his vision. Although it was only the foundation of array formations, a high tower rises from the ground. Once he reached the entry level, with the help of the attribute panel, he could naturally proceed smoothly and push his array formation skills to a profound level.

This mysterious art of array formations places great emphasis on foundations. Initially, it is merely about sketching runes and drawing spiritual energy. As one's expertise deepens, one can use a small array disc as a guide to borrow the grand momentum of heaven and earth. At that time, one could deploy arrays with a flip of the hand and create momentum with a cover of the hand. Even with Qi Refining cultivation, one could use the power of an array to shake a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"Array formations are like weaving a heavenly net; a single error leads to ten thousand gaps..."

Of course, this is the ideal state. In reality, if a Foundation Establishment cultivator slapped their hand down, no matter what world-shaking array a Qi Refining cultivator laid down, it would still be destroyed with a single palm.

After forging a Foundation, one is recognized by heaven and earth and can obtain a innate spiritual ability. One's own level has already exceeded the imagination of Qi Refining cultivators.

*In the following days, Xu Yunfan stayed indoors, immersing himself entirely in cultivation. In the morning, he circulated the True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra, his spine rising and falling like a dragon as dark golden true energy surged through his meridians like a river. In the afternoon, he studied the Introduction to Array Formations, his ten fingers drawing runes in the void, occasionally causing spiritual energy explosions that shook the stone room.*

*Three months later, "Array Formation" was finally listed in the Skills section of the attribute panel. Together with the True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra, the proficiency of these two items was growing slowly but steadily.*
