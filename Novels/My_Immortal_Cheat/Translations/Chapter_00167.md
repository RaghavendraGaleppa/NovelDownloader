**Chapter 167: Acquaintances**

"Many thanks, Brother Hong, many thanks. I shall take my leave."

Nigu bowed twice to Niu Hong, too embarrassed to stay any longer, and hastily departed.

Then Niu Hong walked up to Zhou Tian, looking down at him with the same indifference.

"Forces like those in the Nine Provinces are not to be spoken of lightly. The information you seek can be found with ordinary intelligence organizations. Asking others will only harm yourself and them. While those great powers might not be like you, there are many who seek to curry favor with them, and they wouldn't mind using you to show their stance."

Zhou Tian looked up at the tall man before him. He hadn't expected someone who looked so fierce to actually possess such a warm and kind heart.

He nodded and said, "I understand. Thank you."

"Brother Hong, you came without a word! I could have come out to greet you."

From the depths of the banquet hall, a young man walked over. His eyes were bright, and his formal attire was exquisite, giving him the air of a refined young master. He walked straight towards Niu Hong, a smile plastered on his face. As he passed Zhou Tian, he showed no reaction – no disdain, no contempt, complete disregard, as if Zhou Tian didn't even exist in his sight.

He added, "Since Brother Hong has come all this way, you must allow me to fulfill my duties as a host."

"Zhang Kun!" Someone whispered, clearly wary of this person, indicating his background was also considerable.

"You're too kind. I'm just passing by; there's no need for such a grand display." Niu Hong frowned slightly, stepping back two paces, seemingly unaccustomed to the man's enthusiasm.

Space Node Seven was unique. Other space nodes were largely divided among various major powers and thus carried some bias, but the Heavenspanning Company maintained absolute neutrality, a reputation built over many years. Because of this, Space Node Seven hosted many individuals from other forces, and many meetings were chosen to be held here.

"What are you saying, Brother Hong? It's just a banquet, hardly a grand display." Zhang Kun smiled faintly. It seemed the reason for this banquet was precisely Niu Hong. "The VIP room is ready, Brother Hong, please."

Zhang Kun extended his hand, gesturing.

Niu Hong, with his dazzling golden hair radiating a brilliant glow, pale complexion, and sharp golden eyes, looked exceptionally handsome. His body paused slightly, appearing somewhat reluctant, but in the end, he lifted his foot and moved forward, not wanting to defy Zhang Kun's wishes.

The two walked side-by-side, chatting cheerfully, drawing envious glances from many.

Just as the two were about to enter the VIP room, a figure hurriedly walked in, approached Zhang Kun, and whispered something into his ear.

Zhou Tian's expression became strange, because the person who walked in was precisely Young Master Chen. They had snatched his invitation, and now he was coming to confront them.

"Guess if he's here for us," Zhou Tian said to the Phoenix Bird behind him.

The Phoenix Bird rolled its eyes. Was that even a question? It was obvious without thinking.

Zhang Kun and Niu Hong stopped. Zhang Kun glanced in their direction, then said something to Niu Hong, and together with Young Master Chen, they started walking towards them.

They stopped in front of Zhou Tian. After appraising him from head to toe, Zhang Kun spoke: "My friend, this friend of mine says your invitation was obtained through... less than normal means."

Zhou Tian immediately became displeased. "What do you mean 'less than normal means'? This was clearly snatched through my own abilities, what's abnormal about that?"

Everyone was dumbfounded. They had seen Zhang Kun turn back and assumed something else was happening, only to witness a hothead daring to speak to Zhang Kun in such a manner.

Zhang Kun's face darkened, and the guy named Chen also looked rather displeased.

"Are you provoking me?!" Zhang Kun coldly reprimanded Zhou Tian. He was the host of this banquet, yet he had been publicly humiliated. If he didn't do something, he would be looked down upon.

Behind him, three burly men with surging qi and blood stepped out, not concealing their aura. All of them were Saint Kings.

Others began to laugh, some kindly, others intentionally cheering him on and boosting his prestige. After all, in their eyes, Zhang Kun was the powerful one.

"Phoenix Bird, someone's bullying your master's big brother."

The Phoenix Bird rolled its eyes again, then stepped forward gracefully, threads of surging qi and blood pressing out. This was terrifying. All those present were young, and who could withstand it? They all felt their hearts pound, some even staggering.

The three Saint Kings, in particular, broke out in cold sweat, because the Phoenix Bird's pressure was primarily directed at them.

A Great Emperor! Zhang Kun's face turned ashen. He subtly glanced at the person named Chen beside him. Someone who carried a Great Emperor as a bodyguard was certainly not simple, but Young Master Chen hadn't told him this information.

Everyone's eyes widened in shock. They hadn't expected the woman who had been following them to actually be a Great Emperor. They also realized that someone who could bring a Great Emperor as a bodyguard was probably an immensely formidable individual, capable of breaking others' legs with ease.

"What? Do you intend to cause trouble here?" Zhang Kun was in a difficult position, caught between a rock and a hard place. If he had known earlier, he would never have interfered, but now that things had come to this, retreating would make him a laughingstock. Although it was a Great Emperor, he wasn't without means of retaliation.

"We were already preparing to leave; we didn't intend to cause any trouble." Zhou Tian held his head high, his hands clasped behind his back, exuding the air of a distinguished young talent. Only his full beard marred this aesthetic. Although his words seemed somewhat unrelated to Zhang Kun's question, his meaning was very clear.

Zhang Kun took a deep breath, his eyes profound. At his signal, someone quietly left to request reinforcements.

Boom!

Simultaneously, the Phoenix Bird took another step forward. Dazzling runes flashed like a river of stars, and the three Saint Kings' bodies swayed, forcing them to retreat repeatedly.

"Hmph, who dares to be disrespectful!" At that moment, a cold snort echoed, and another person walked over from a distance. This person had bluish-green hair, with some Dao principles and patterns appearing on his forehead. He looked like a middle-aged man, his expression stern, his hands clasped behind his back.

"Phoenix Bird?" As he approached, he showed surprise. His eyes gleamed brightly, as if a great sun was rising and falling within them. He recognized the Phoenix Bird's true form and seemed to know her.

"Esteemed Zhang Yu?" The Phoenix Bird was also somewhat surprised. At the same time, she sent a telepathic message to Zhou Tian: "This is Master's old acquaintance. It seems today's matter will end without further trouble."

Zhou Tian was a bit stunned. Could it really be such a coincidence? Meeting an acquaintance?

"Grandfather." Zhang Kun stepped forward and respectfully called out. Zhang Yu waved his hand, signaling him to stand still for now.

"Phoenix Bird, where is your master?" Zhang Yu asked, his previous sternness gone.

Those present were speechless. What in the world was happening? Had the flood washed away the Dragon King's temple?

"Master is still resting in the room. We just came out for a stroll. I'll inform him now," the Phoenix Bird replied.

Zhang Yu nodded, then cast his gaze towards Zhou Tian. With his cultivation realm, he naturally saw Zhou Tian's true appearance, but he had no impression of him. He then turned to Zhang Kun and said: "Kun'er, what just happened?"

Zhang Kun quickly replied: "Reporting, Grandfather, there was just a small misunderstanding with this friend earlier, but it has already been resolved."
