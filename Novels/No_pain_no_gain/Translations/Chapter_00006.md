**Chapter 6: Evergreen Arts**

To enjoy roasted chicken every day, one must strive to become someone like Brother Zhen. Ten-year-old Han Li immediately understood this principle.

However, Han Li's path was blocked. He had to either pass Physician Mo's assessment for the Nourishing Arts or pass a make-up exam six months later to ensure he could remain in the Seven Mysteries Sect. But the make-up exam was no easy feat. Han Li had inquired about its contents. First, one needed to run a full circle around Cai Xia Mountain, which was over ten li in circumference. That wasn't all; immediately afterward, they had to team up and spar in a sparsely populated mountain forest. Finally, they had to withstand a certain number of moves under the siege of highly skilled senior disciples. Only after passing all the tests could one stand out from the nominal disciples and become an inner disciple of the Seven Mysteries Sect.

He hadn't even passed the simpler initial entry test, and thinking about this made Han Li feel disheartened. He looked at Brother Zhen, wondering if he had a solution.

"Little Li, if I had come to find you any later, you might have missed an opportunity to change your destiny."

Han Li was a little confused. Was Brother Zhen planning to violate sect rules and secretly teach him internal arts?

"You just said Physician Mo would teach you a set of nourishing arts formulas sometime soon, right?"

"Yes, Physician Mo said not to spread it, but telling Brother Zhen shouldn't be a big deal," Han Li nodded and replied. He had unconditional trust in his cousin. Yet, he still didn't understand what a nourishing and cultivating formula had to do with changing one's destiny.

"I had inquired about your situation before, so I asked my master what kind of person Physician Mo was."

"According to my master, Deputy Sect Master Wu, Physician Mo possesses martial arts no weaker than the Sect Master's. Since it's merely a nourishing formula, why did he warn both you and Zhang Tie to keep it secret?"

Physician Mo was not a disciple of the Seven Mysteries Sect. He had only accidentally saved Sect Master Wang from danger several years ago. After the Sect Master learned of his excellent medical skills and impressive martial arts, he invited him back to the Seven Mysteries Sect as a revered guest.

Han Li was simply inexperienced, not foolish. Combining this with the information he had gathered about Physician Mo, he immediately understood the crucial point: a formula not to be spread by such a master must be incredibly precious. He absolutely *had* to learn this Nourishing Art!

"If you encounter difficulties in your cultivation later, you can come find your Brother Zhen, because I have already cultivated true qi!" Han Zhen clasped his hands behind his back, adopting the demeanor of a master before Han Li. This was also one of the reasons Han Zhen had actively sought out Han Li. After cultivating true qi, Han Zhen had not yet tested his skills. When his hands were itching for a fight, Han Zhen thought of Han Li.

When he had achieved a small accomplishment in Tiger Roar Fist for the first time, and showcased his skills, Han Li had been there to provide excellent emotional value.

"Watch closely, Little Li, I'll show you what I can do!"

Han Zhen leaped two zhang high, leaving a significant imprint on a rock with a single punch. His fist was completely unharmed, save for some white dust. Even though he had heard that nascent true qi could break a tree as thick as a bowl, Han Zhen was still astonished by the power of his own punch. Han Li, watching from a stone, was even more dumbfounded. He decided to follow his cousin's advice and immediately seek his guidance after learning the formula.

Twenty days later, Han Li and Zhang Tie were finally separated from the other child disciples. During this period, Han Zhen had also delivered food to Han Li and Zhang Tie several times, and incidentally taught a lesson to a few rich kids who bullied others by virtue of their martial arts training. Han Zhen didn't know when Han Li and Zhang Tie had become so close, with Han Li calling Zhang Tie "Brother Zhang." This made Zhang Tie deeply regretful after he learned of Han Zhen's identity. After realizing Han Zhen didn't hold a grudge, Zhang Tie also acknowledged Han Zhen as his big brother and guaranteed that he would take good care of Han Li in Divine Hand Valley.

Previously, not everyone knew that Han Li had a cousin who was a disciple of the Seven Absolutes Hall and apprenticed under the Deputy Sect Master. After this incident, no disciple dared to trouble Han Li again; they wouldn't even let Han Li participate in group brawls.

...

...

A few days later, on a day when Physician Mo was out, Han Li secretly left Divine Hand Valley and found Han Zhen through someone. The two went to the same pond where they had their previous secret meeting. Han Zhen finally got the first layer formula of the Evergreen Arts from Han Li's recitation, as he had wished. Physician Mo had told Han Li that this unnamed formula was divided into several layers, but before Han Li's initiation, he had only told him the first layer. As long as Han Li and Zhang Tie could achieve some progress in cultivating the first layer within half a year, Physician Mo would accept them as official disciples, giving them treatment no worse than inner disciples. Han Li's joy overflowed as he spoke, and he discarded his last thought of just going through the motions for six months and then leaving the mountain to become an outer disciple.

Han Zhen transcribed the first layer of the Evergreen Arts onto a cloth scroll based on Han Li's dictation. Looking at the cultivation method for the first layer of the Evergreen Arts, Han Zhen's heart could not calm down for a long time. He felt both joy and worry.

His joy came from finally standing at the threshold of the immortal path, a month after being reborn into this world, just as he had wished. His worry was that he might not necessarily be able to embark on the path of immortality from here. Spiritual root aptitude and cultivation methods corresponding to the spiritual root were both indispensable. Too many unknowns lay before Han Zhen.

"Before even trying, why am I already getting so anxious about gains and losses?" Han Zhen mocked himself inwardly.

"Brother Zhen, have you figured out what kind of cultivation this formula is for?" Han Li asked eagerly, unable to suppress the joy in his heart, seeing Han Zhen so engrossed. This nourishing art must be extraordinary.

Han Zhen fell into hesitation, wondering whether to truthfully tell Han Li that this unnamed formula was an immortal cultivation method, or to conceal it. After a moment of thought, Han Zhen ultimately chose a vague answer. He might not be able to cultivate the Evergreen Arts himself, and Physician Mo was Han Li's 'life mentor.' Before Han Li understood the dangers of the world, Han Zhen did not intend to interfere too much. Furthermore, the Seven Mysteries Sect had no records of immortals, and Han Zhen couldn't explain how he knew about the existence of immortal cultivation.

After pondering for a moment, Han Zhen said rather solemnly, "I understand a little, but I'll need to try cultivating it to confirm what I'm thinking."

Afterward, Han Zhen wrote down some insights on Pure Yang Energy and internal cultivation, resolving some of Han Li's doubts. The two agreed to meet at this location once every month from then on.

After returning to the Seven Absolutes Hall disciples' residence, Han Zhen stayed indoors and did not go out. During this period, Master Wu returned once. After inspecting Han Zhen's cultivation, he was greatly astonished to learn that Han Zhen had cultivated true qi in just seven days and achieved initial mastery of Pure Yang Energy in half a month. This astonishing talent caused a stir within the sect, and even Sect Master Wang personally came to verify it. After confirming Han Zhen's extraordinary talent, he granted him the right to freely choose any martial arts manual from the Seven Absolutes Hall. Han Zhen chose a powerful and pure Yang internal art called *Raging Python Energy*, and also requested Master Wu to teach him staff techniques, which fulfilled Master Wu's long-held wish.

Han Zhen then used the excuse of cultivating internal arts to enter secluded cultivation, continuing to cultivate the first layer of the Evergreen Arts. In the days that followed, Han Zhen completely set aside his true qi cultivation, dedicating his full attention to the Evergreen Arts.

There were five days left until the agreed meeting with Han Li. On this day, as the morning sun rose, Han Zhen, who had been sitting in meditation all night, suddenly opened his eyes. After twenty-five days, he finally perceived a faint, cool energy flow. This silken, thread-like energy flow would have been difficult to detect if he hadn't achieved true qi cultivation and gained internal vision. Thinking that Han Li had taken a full three months to sense qi under similar cultivation conditions, Han Zhen couldn't help but make an astonishing conjecture.
