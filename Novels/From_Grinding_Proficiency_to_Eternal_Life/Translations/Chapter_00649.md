# Chapter 649: Time is Almost Up

Deep within the temple of Frost Thunder City, a milky-white flame of devotional power burned silently within the Divine Skies Refining World Cauldron.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged before the cauldron, his aura as solid and deep as an abyss.

Within his Dantian Cave Heaven, thirty-six strands of purple-gold Immortal Essence coiled like roaming dragons, radiating a magnificent aura of immortality. Each strand was crystal clear and pure, with the Dao patterns of Divine Skies Thunder faintly visible on their surfaces.

This was the result of his six months of work: harvesting dozens of gods from the凛冬 Northern Plains, stripping them of their divine core, and repeatedly refining them.

With thirty-six strands of Immortal Essence, he could achieve Foundation Establishment perfection and the position of Great True Person at any moment. However, Xu Yunfan felt he wasn't saturated yet.

At least, with the help of his attribute panel, he felt he could still go further.

Zhang Ziyang's figure appeared beside him, his cyan robe moving without wind. He gazed into Xu Yunfan's Dantian, and the silver star of his Investigation Authority flickered between his brows. Seeing this, Xu Yunfan didn't try to hide anything.

After all, Zhang Ziyang had spent years reading all kinds of scriptures, had spent considerable time cultivating within the Banner Spirit, and now possessed a deep understanding of the interaction between heaven and man, thanks to the level of his Investigation Authority.

After a long while, Zhang Ziyang clapped his hands in admiration.

"The Divine Skies Thunder shatters ten thousand methods as its bone structure, while the Profound Heaven's Indestructibility carries the myriad heavens as its frame. Your Dao Foundation is now like divine metal poured and forged, and the embryonic form of your Intent Image is naturally formed. At this moment, you just need to trigger and condense your Intent Image, and you will immediately step into Foundation Establishment perfection and achieve the position of Great True Person!"

But Xu Yunfan slowly shook his head, pondering. "Nine strands of essence can achieve Foundation Establishment perfection, but thirty-six strands are already far beyond convention. Sect Master, I want to try..."

He pointed虚点 at his Dantian, and the essence strands roaming within his Cave Heaven suddenly accelerated.

"Ninety-nine strands!"

"Ninety-nine?!"

Zhang Ziyang's expression trembled, unable to maintain his composure. The psychological gap was too great, and he couldn't help but blurt out.

"Do you think Immortal Essence is a pebble on the roadside? It's incredibly difficult for a Foundation Establishment True Person to refine even three strands. Even when the Lord of the Nine Heavens of Divine Skies was at Foundation Establishment, he only laid his foundation with eleven strands. For you to aim for ninety-nine strands is simply..."

His voice cut off abruptly because he saw the surging purple-gold lightning in Xu Yunfan's eyes. It was a sign of the Divine Skies Profound Heaven Indestructible Body being pushed to its limit.

More so because a miniature star chart formed by the Zhoutian Star Spirit Banners was faintly visible above Xu Yunfan's head. The phantom forms of the eighty-one divine banner spirits flickered within it, and a vast amount of devotional power was being continuously refined by the Divine Skies Refining World Cauldron, transforming into pure divine power to nourish the essence.

Zhang Ziyang suddenly realized.

Xu Yunfan's path had long since deviated from the conventional scope of the *Divine Skies Nine Heavens Profound Heaven Indestructible Scripture*.

He was not an ordinary person. According to the conventions of Immortal Dao cultivation, Xu Yunfan achieved in one lifetime what others could not in ten thousand.

Even the World-Honored One of the Bodhisattva Pure Land, after achieving success in his cultivation, had to go through ten thousand lifetimes of reincarnation to attain his true position. But at Foundation Establishment, there was simply no comparison to Xu Yunfan.

Calm again, Zhang Ziyang's gaze swept over the dancing starlight on the banner surface, then looked at the surging white flames of devotional power within the cauldron. He pondered for a long while.

"If we use the Star Spirit Banner as the furnace and the Divine Skies Refining World Cauldron as the fuel, and you use your own talent to forcibly control it, we might be able to give it a try!"

Xu Yunfan asked, "Generally speaking, isn't it about talent and comprehension?"

Zhang Ziyang didn't respond. This topic was impossible to discuss.

Xu Yunfan grinned. He knew that Zhang Ziyang's comprehension was incredibly, unbelievably high.

Zhang Ziyang's voice suddenly rose, a hint of excited inquiry in his tone as he felt this was feasible.

"If you truly use ninety-nine strands of Immortal Essence as the skeleton, condense your own Divine Skies Thunder and Profound Heaven's Indestructibility Intent, and if you can fully solidify it on this basis, it will no longer be an ordinary Dao Foundation. It might become an indestructible phenomenon that can support the achievement of a Nascent Soul Dao Embryo! Throughout history, no one at Foundation Establishment has ever built such a foundation!"

Xu Yunfan nodded, his gaze piercing through the temple's dome and falling upon the snow-swept Northern Plains.

"Therefore, this world's divine war must be faster and more intense. Lord Qingyuan won't give us much time."

The opponent was absolutely trying every means to hunt him down. For him to give up would not be the style of a true lord of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Soon, the six months of patient waiting yielded the results Xu Yunfan desired.

The凛冬 Northern Plains had completely transformed into a battlefield.

The Thunder Warriors of the Baltheon divine system, riding thunder chariots that tore through the sky, charged with each冲锋 drawing ten thousand jun of thunder,炸成 exploding the Locke-Man's Frost Giant phalanxes into sky-filling shards of ice.

Yet the Frost Giants, in their death throes, unleashed an eternal frost tide that could instantly freeze dozens of Thunder Warriors, along with their mounts' lightning, into twisted ice sculptures.

The collision of thunderstorms and frost tides plowed bottomless canyons into the frozen earth. The clash of scorching heat and extreme cold steamed up a sky-obscuring white fog, permanently altering the landscape of this ancient ice plain.

Buses's Wind Cavalry, like the deadliest of ghosts, took advantage of the chaotic energy turbulence on the battlefield to raid the three outer strongholds of the Eternal Frost Royal Court as if entering无人之境. The hurricane, imbued with divine power, easily shredded the city walls built of ice crystals. As the violent wind blades swept through, tens of thousands of devout believers of the凛冬 divine system within the cities, along with their praying temples, were turned into a mixture of flesh and ice crystal dust.

With the foundation of their faith destroyed, Locke-Man's divine power source fluctuated violently, drawing the covetous gazes of other nature system gods.

But this chaos was Xu Yunfan's hunting ground.

He was like an invisible ghost, moving along the edges of the battlefield, shielded by the triple causal secrets and the Star Spirit Banner.

Under Xu Yunfan's deliberate provocation, the flames of war inevitably reached one of the faith centers of the Aeterra continent. Gods from the Light and Dark divine systems joined the fray one after another, each wanting to expand their own sphere of faith.

Xu Yunfan only needed to stir the pot from the shadows, and the divine war gradually spiraled completely out of control.

The three great divine systems—Nature, Light, and Dark—clashed and slaughtered each other across Aeterra. The light from the violent collisions and annihilation of divine power was like countless supernovas erupting in turn over the continent.

The earth was riddled with cracks, the sky was shattered, and the laments of the laws continued like a background melody.

The turbulence of this chaotic末日混战 among the gods even shook the very foundations of the entire Aeterra world.

On the distant barbarian western wilds, Zhang Ziyang sat cross-legged atop a desolate mountain peak.

The silver star of his Investigation Authority between his brows flashed with unprecedented intensity. Countless chaotic ripples, representing the fall of gods, the collapse of faith, and the disruption of laws, were passing through Aeterra's Heavenly Dao network, crashing against his divine sense like a tsunami.

He abruptly opened his eyes, silver light piercing the void, penetrating countless spatial barriers, and eagerly casting toward Xu Yunfan.

"Yunfan! The turmoil of this world's Heavenly Dao origin has reached its limit, like a mansion about to collapse! It's highly likely that an outsider has stimulated this great world, triggering its emergency response."

"Lord Qingyuan?"

"Very likely."

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath.

At the edge of the most chaotic vortex of the battlefield, Xu Yunfan stood like a boulder in the eye of the storm. He was shrouded in the dark starlight shed by the Star Spirit Banner, surrounded by the divine power storms that could destroy heaven and earth.

Time was almost up.
