Chapter 85: Explosion

The Golden Radiance Array hummed, its runes merging as it attempted to repair itself and resist the Crimson Blood Divine Spear. The Divine Spear was incredibly fast; having just pierced the metal exterior, it appeared above the array the very next second.

Although the Divine Spear had expended considerable power to penetrate the metal shell, it was still a forbidden grand divine ability of a Dao Lord. The moment it struck the Golden Radiance Array, the array shattered, and the three Purple Qi Daoists all vomited blood, their Flames of Life flickering precariously.

Ignoring their injuries, the trio erupted with energy, forming hand seals. Three runic chains extended from the void, rattling as they coiled towards the crimson Divine Spear.

The runic chains disintegrated the moment they touched the Divine Spear, but the three Purple-robed Daoists recklessly spat out their essence blood, conjuring chain after chain, desperately trying to weaken the Divine Spear's power.

At the same time, the eight warships also lit up, complex symbols appearing on their hulls. As Emperor-grade warships, despite having suffered significant damage, they still retained some residual power, forming a protective shield that enveloped the ancient vessels.

The Purple Qi Daoist's face was ashen. Although they had tried their utmost to deplete the Crimson Divine Spear's power, the effect was not substantial. If the spear were to directly strike the ancient ships, its remaining might would still be enough to kill most of the people aboard.

The Purple Qi Daoist pondered for a moment, but the Divine Spear had already broken through several runic chains, leaving him little time. He made up his mind, withdrew all his energy, and sat cross-legged in the void. His whisk floated above his head, and with a serene expression, he formed a Dao Seal with his hands.

Boom!

The Grand Dao rumbled, and purple qi spread for three thousand li. The Purple-robed Daoist's body, however, became slightly more ethereal. One Dao Seal after another was formed, suffusing the air with purple qi, and a surge of Dao might emanated forth.

“All-Heaven Grand Dao Lord Seal!”

People from the Dao Alliance exclaimed, some recognizing the seal art performed by the Purple-robed Daoist. It was a peerless seal, passed down from the ancient Dao Realm, rumored to be the Foremost Seal of Ten Thousand Laws. Yet, almost no one had mastered it, and many in the Dao Alliance believed it to be lost.

Seeing this, Wei Chuan's grandfather and the white-robed assassin knew the Daoist was resorting to a desperate measure. Their bodies instantly glowed brightly, bursting with vitality, and countless runic chains shot out from the void – a method of exchanging life for power.

With each seal formed, the Purple Qi Daoist's body became a fraction more ethereal, and the purple qi expanded a fraction more. When the final seal was complete, the purple qi filling the sky receded, and the Daoist's body dissolved, leaving behind only a soft sigh:

“After thirty thousand years of Dao-seeking…”

A vibrant purple symbol appeared in his place, carrying immense sealing power, and pressed down towards the Crimson Divine Spear.

The All-Heaven Grand Dao Lord Seal was an ancient grand divine ability of the Dao Realm, requiring at least the Dao Lord realm to cast its first three forms. The Purple Qi Daoist, sacrificing his life, had only barely managed to conjure the first form, just reaching Dao Lord-level power.

The purple Dao Seal exuded a powerful suppressive aura, instantly fixing the previously unstoppable Crimson Divine Spear in mid-air, where it trembled ceaselessly.

Many on the ancient ships showed delight, but Wei Chuan's grandfather and the white-robed assassin frowned deeply. Their cultivation was profound, and they understood more. That Crimson Divine Spear was a forbidden grand divine ability unleashed by a Dao Lord at a great cost, while the purple Dao Seal was merely a divine ability performed by a Heavenly King at the cost of his life, barely reaching the Dao Lord realm. How could it possibly seal the Divine Spear so easily?

As expected, the Crimson Divine Spear erupted with a vast bloody light, and a sea of blood appeared, within which countless ancient gods and devils surged and roared, charging towards the purple Dao Seal. The purple Dao Seal also vibrated through the heavens, its runes manifesting as Daoists who unleashed divine abilities to defend. Although one side was a weapon and the other merely a divine ability, they fought like two divine generals commanding their armies.

The cries of battle shook the heavens. Though contained within the sealed space of the purple Dao Seal, it was as if an ancient battlefield had descended.

Not long after, the purple Dao Seal, being inherently inferior and merely cast by a Heavenly King, could not sustain itself. It was eroded by the sea of blood, but the luster on the Crimson Divine Spear also dimmed considerably, its power clearly weakened.

Wei Chuan's grandfather sighed, his fangs dripping with blood. It wasn't that they were unwilling to fight with their lives, but their objective was to save these talented young cultivators, not to directly contend with the Crimson Divine Spear. Only sealing divine abilities would be useful. Unfortunately, the desperate divine abilities he and the white-robed assassin possessed were powerful offensive skills. If they were to clash with the Divine Spear, the aftershocks alone could tear the ancient ships apart, let alone save anyone.

Runes surged, and layers of shields enveloped the eight ancient ships. Warman extended his hand, and the metal outer shell formed by the Mechanical War Buddhas dissolved. They were preparing to directly confront the Divine Spear; remaining in a confined space would likely compress their power, so they were retracted.

Light shone in, and the crowd realized that the outside was no longer the boundless darkness of the void storm; they had reached the skies above the Land of the Abandoned Gods.

Boom!

The Divine Spear plunged directly into the center of the eight ancient ships. Immense energy erupted outwards, and a towering sea of blood surged forth.

Crack! Crack!

Shields shattered layer by layer. The first layer of defense, cast by Wei Chuan's grandfather and the white-robed assassin, broke. The sea of blood slammed into the ship hulls, which also began to crack.

Shields appeared on everyone's bodies—some golden, some purple qi, some with grand seals hovering above their heads. These were all life-saving measures, unleashed without reservation at this moment.

Only Zhou Tian swayed precariously, rocking with the ship's movements, appearing utterly unprepared. On his body were only a few layers of runic shields Zhou Ying had just added for him, now flickering unsteadily. At this moment, Zhou Ying and Zhou Xunchuan were fully exerting themselves to control the ships, hoping to hold on for a little longer.

Tian Ling's face was panicked, her pretty features pale, her eyes filled with anxiety. She pulled out charm after charm, jade pendant after jade pendant, but Zhou Tian couldn't use any of them.

Zhou Tian shook his head and whispered, “Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. Make sure to protect yourself!”

He turned to look at the surging blood waves outside the ship. The hull was already teetering, and the next moment, it completely shattered, the eight ancient ships exploding.

Zhou Tian vanished the instant the sea of blood surged in, utterly devoured by the crimson tide, leaving not even a speck behind. Tian Ling, however, could no longer see him, as she too had been flung elsewhere by the explosion of the ancient ships.

Zhou Tian's revival count for the day had already been applied to [Sacred Word], so he had no more revivals left and could only wait for the count to reset.

Although the Crimson Divine Spear had been weakened layer by layer, losing almost two-thirds of its power, its might was still terrifying as it swept through the eight warships.

Within the void storm, the Dao Lord's expression eased slightly. Since his divine ability had hit its target, the other party must have suffered damage. Stopping Gabriel and a few others who wished to pursue, the mighty Dao Lord said coolly, meeting their gaze, “Heavenly Pass has already detected us. We cannot pursue further.”

The void storm rumbled. A massive scroll materialized, enveloping hundreds of millions of li. It was utterly blank, yet it seemed to contain all things in heaven and earth, radiating a profound Dao Rhyme. The scroll shrank, and the mighty Dao Lord extended his hand to catch it. Though merely a scroll, in his hand, it felt as heavy as ten thousand jun, causing his arm to sink slightly.

It was this blank scroll that had blocked the Heavenly Pass's probing. Anything capable of obstructing a Heavenly Venerate-grade war fortress like the Heavenly Pass must at least be of the same caliber.
