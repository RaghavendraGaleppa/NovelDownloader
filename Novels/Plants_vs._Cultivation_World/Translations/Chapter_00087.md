# Chapter 87: Heartfire Technique  

Yuan Niya's cultivation technique originated from her master, the elder of the Law Enforcement Hall, and was one of only two techniques in the Qinglu Sect capable of reaching the Nascent Soul stage.  

This technique was called the Heartfire Technique, a fire-based cultivation method with exceptionally strong offensive capabilities. This was the primary reason why the Law Enforcement Hall elder possessed such formidable combat prowess. However, despite its power, the Heartfire Technique had one drawback: cultivating it would condense heartfire—the core of the technique. Igniting the heartfire allowed a cultivator to enter a berserk-like state, greatly amplifying their combat strength.  

A fire-based technique already renowned for its offensive power, combined with the heartfire, enabled practitioners to challenge opponents above their own cultivation level. But such immense power came at a cost—each time heartfire was condensed during cultivation, it would erode the cultivator's consciousness, gradually making them more volatile.  

The solution to this volatility was simple: pause cultivation. As long as one stopped cultivating, no new heartfire would condense, and thus, the erosion of consciousness would cease. Only when the cultivator's mental state could withstand further erosion would they resume cultivation.  

Due to her childhood experiences, Yuan Niya possessed a stronger mental fortitude than most, allowing her to resist the erosion caused by heartfire with relative ease. However, this didn’t mean she was entirely unaffected—she merely had the willpower to suppress its influence. In the future, as her cultivation progressed, she might still need to pause her training to fully contend with the heartfire's erosion.  

But now, Yuan Niya had made a startling discovery—the strange fragrance emanating from Chu Feifei could suppress the heartfire's erosion. This meant that by Chu Feifei's side, she could cultivate without restraint.  

The Heartfire Technique only eroded a cultivator's consciousness at the moment of condensation. Once the heartfire was successfully formed, it would no longer affect the cultivator unless ignited.  

"Sister Yuan, what do you think?"  

Seeing the astonishment on Yuan Niya's face, Gu Mo knew the matter was practically settled.  

"Junior Sister Chu, from now on, I’ll have your back," Yuan Niya declared, gripping Chu Feifei's hand. At this moment, she felt an overwhelming urge to laugh triumphantly.  

With Gu Mo's perfected Cleansing Technique for marrow refinement and Chu Feifei's mystical fragrance aiding her cultivation, soaring to new heights was inevitable—she was destined to secure a place among the sect's true disciples.  

To make the most of the Cleansing Technique's effects, Yuan Niya, Gu Mo, and Chu Feifei squeezed into the small hut and began their respective cultivation sessions. For the foreseeable future, this would likely remain their training routine.  

After all, Chu Feifei's unique constitution required Gu Mo's perfected Cleansing Technique to activate, and if Yuan Niya wanted to harness Chu Feifei's fragrance for cultivation, she had no choice but to bring Chu Feifei to Gu Mo. However, once Chu Feifei's special constitution was fully awakened, Gu Mo's assistance might no longer be necessary.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, I’ll be taking her with me now."  

Under the cover of night, Yuan Niya swiftly took Chu Feifei away on her flying sword, returning to her own cave abode. She had actually wanted Gu Mo to accompany them—the spiritual energy in his dwelling was far too sparse compared to the rich concentration in her cave. But Gu Mo had refused. He harbored too many secrets, and entering the abode of a Golden Core elder would place him under direct scrutiny, greatly increasing the risk of exposure.  

In the following days, a major incident occurred in the Formation Peak—Lan Shuying, one of the peak's overseers, was suddenly dismissed and exiled from the sect. Given her age, this exile likely meant she would spend the rest of her days outside the sect until her eventual death.  

This was Yuan Niya's doing. After learning the details of Chu Feifei's framing, she had mobilized the Law Enforcement Hall to investigate. Though they had uncovered some clues, they weren't substantial enough to warrant severe punishment. At most, they could only exile Lan Shuying to await her end. Had they found concrete evidence of her tampering with the sect's protective formation, she would have faced immediate execution.  

As an overseer of the Formation Peak, sabotaging the sect's protective formation was a crime that warranted the harshest punishment.  

Soon after, Yuan Niya officially declared Chu Feifei as her attendant. However, no formal contract was signed between them. Yuan Niya would provide Chu Feifei with protection and cultivation resources, while Chu Feifei would assist Yuan Niya in her cultivation and manage her cave abode.  

This development also pitted Yuan Niya directly against Ye Yuqi, but Yuan Niya remained unfazed. With Gu Mo and Chu Feifei as her cultivation "cheats," she was confident she would eventually surpass Ye Yuqi—why fear him now?  

Meanwhile, in the Artifact Peak...  

Wu Jinfei was stunned when he learned that Chu Feifei had become an attendant to an inner disciple. Among their original group of five, Yao Shifeng and Chu Feifei had both become attendants to inner disciples, Gu Mo had advanced to become an outer disciple, and even Hu Hai had reached the third level of Qi Refinement and secured a mission outside the sect.  

Only Wu Jinfei remained an ordinary labor disciple with no clear path forward.  

At that moment, Wu Jinfei seriously considered leaving the sect, returning to the mortal world to marry, have children, and establish a cultivation family. Perhaps one of his descendants might possess a mid-to-low-grade spiritual root, allowing future generations to progress further in cultivation.  

This idea wasn’t entirely without merit. Of course, labor disciples who wished to leave the sect had to pay a contribution fee—not an exorbitant amount, but enough to require several years of saving. The sect actually encouraged such departures, as disciples who left to establish cultivation families would still be considered part of the sect's influence. These families could also provide the sect with talented and reliable future disciples.

**Spirit Field Hut**  

Gu Mo exhaled deeply, feeling the surging power and spiritual energy within him. Satisfied, he nodded. With the aid of second-grade Solar Essence, he had smoothly advanced from the fifth to the sixth level of Qi Refinement without any hindrance.  

Only the transition from the sixth to the seventh level—the leap from mid to late-stage Qi Refinement—might pose a slight obstacle. But even that wouldn’t hold him back for long, given his current foundation.  

His physique and spiritual energy were nine times that of his peers, his spiritual energy had already condensed into a mist-like state—a hallmark of Qi Refinement perfection—and his soul had been tempered to extraordinary strength through the Wine God Soul Forging Technique. Even with his inferior spiritual root, nothing could halt his progress.  

Now, Gu Mo's focus was on acquiring a second-grade spirit field—a necessity for his breakthrough to Foundation Establishment. There were two key hurdles in advancing from Qi Refinement to Foundation Establishment: condensing divine sense and liquefying spiritual energy.  

Thanks to Chu Feifei's unique fragrance, Gu Mo had made excellent progress in the Wine God Soul Forging Technique. He was now on the verge of condensing divine sense, meaning his soul strength was already at least equivalent to that of a ninth-level Qi Refinement cultivator.  

Had he relied solely on Gou Youyu's annual supply of spirit wine, achieving this level of soul cultivation would have been nothing more than a pipe dream.  

With divine sense nearly within reach, the only remaining challenge was liquefying his spiritual energy—the second and most daunting hurdle for someone with an inferior spiritual root. But with the second-grade Sunflower, even this obstacle was surmountable.  

The only condition? He needed a second-grade spirit field to allow the second-grade Sunflower to produce complete Solar Essence.
