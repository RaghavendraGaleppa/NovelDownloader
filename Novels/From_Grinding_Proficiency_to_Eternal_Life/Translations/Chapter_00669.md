# Chapter 669: Swallowing Dao Fruits is the Shortcut

The words were like pearls scattered on a jade plate, instantly dispelling the confusion in his heart and opening his mind.

This deposit was of immense value.

It was enough to show that Dongming Zhenjun was serious.

Xu Yunfan looked at Dongming Zhenjun with some surprise.

Dongming Zhenjun naturally knew what Xu Yunfan meant and curled her lips.

"What, you thought my jade slip contained fakes?"

Xu Yunfan gave a dry laugh and didn't respond to that, merely saying.

"Zhenjun's sincerity is truly abundant. I, Xu, am in awe."

Xu Yunfan put away the jade slip, already having a plan in his heart. He understood that Dongming Zhenjun genuinely wanted to befriend him.

However, he still had to carefully consider what kind of person she truly was.

He didn't delay. Gathering his spiritual will at his fingertips, he began to inscribe the information about the Aitira World onto the other side of the jade slip: its general location, world characteristics, the authority traits of the three main gods, and the traces of Qingyuan Zhenjun's activities and attempts to refine the world's origin within this realm.

He quite enjoyed watching dogs bite dogs.

"Though the gods of this world hold their positions unjustly, possessing authority without understanding the true essence of the Great Dao, the world's origin is extremely unique. In particular, the divine crystals condensed from the power of faith are exceptionally effective for stabilizing Grotto-heavens, tempering magical power, and even comprehending certain specific Dao techniques. If Zhenjun intends to go, please be cautious, especially as the three main gods join forces, their combined might is not inferior to that of a Golden Core Zhenjun."

Xu Yunfan returned the jade slip, adding.

Dongming Zhenjun took the jade slip, scanned it with her spiritual will, and a satisfied smile appeared on her face. "Excellent! As expected, Shenxiao Zhenjun is a trustworthy person!"

She put away the jade slip and looked at Xu Yunfan.

"Then, I shall赠予 you another piece of advice. The path of the Golden Core lies in cultivation and transformation. The Golden Core is not the end, but a seed.

Cultivation involves using the world's origin and the laws of the Great Dao to temper it day and night, making it increasingly robust and condensed, like an eternal star.

Transformation uses the Golden Core as the pivot and the Grotto-heaven as the furnace to evolve one's own Great Dao. You must completely integrate the Supreme Thunder of Shenxiao that shatters all laws, and the imagery of the Profound Firmament's Immortality that carries the Myriad Heavens, into the laws of your Grotto-heaven, turning it from void into reality, transforming it from a prototype into a true small world.

When the Grotto-heaven is stable and suspended high, and laws are born naturally, allowing it to continuously draw power from the chaotic void to nourish the Golden Core and one's own body, then one can be said to have truly established a foothold in the Golden Core realm. As for the higher paths, they are still long. We can trade again when you reach that step."

Her words pointed out the core path from the early to mid stages of the Golden Core, which was exactly what Xu Yunfan urgently needed.

Although the key details still required exchanging with subsequent intelligence, this direction and framework were already incredibly precious, providing Xu Yunfan with a clear direction.

Xu Yunfan bowed deeply. "Many thanks for Zhenjun's guidance! The coordinates for Aitira have been provided. I, Xu, will await Zhenjun's subsequent methods. If there is any task within my capabilities, I am willing to offer my meager efforts."

This was the proper response to show his cooperative attitude.

As for whether he would actually be "driven" to do anything, that was another matter entirely.

Dongming Zhenjun chuckled. "No problem, Shenxiao Zhenjun, you should first return to consolidate your realm. I am very interested in the Aitira World. Perhaps in the near future, we will have the opportunity to cooperate again in that foreign land."

Xu Yunfan understood upon hearing this that Dongming Zhenjun urgently needed to verify the authenticity of Aitira.

He took the hint, cupped his fists, and took his leave.

As for whether to inform Qingdu Zhenjun, that would have to wait until they had taken what they could from Aitira first.

Having now achieved the Shenxiao Scripture and obtained the Dao Fruit, Xu Yunfan naturally needed to take many intermediate and high-ranking gods to fill the positions for the Zhoutian Star Banner's Great Array of Zodiac Stars.

Although there were now three Golden Core Banner Spirits within it, failing to complete the positions of the Star Lords would create flaws when refining it into a personal Numinous Treasure in the future.

Leaving the gloomy Dao field of Xuansha Mountain, which was shrouded in the penetrating imagery of the Nine Nether Profound Evil, and bathing once more in the sunlight, his heart did not completely relax.

His transaction with Dongming Zhenjun was a matter of mutual benefit, but this woman's thoughts were deep and her methods mysterious, far surpassing Qingyuan.

If Dongming Zhenjun had truly made a move, Qingyuan Zhenjun would not have lived for so long.

Xu Yunfan felt a chill in his heart. This woman was probably using Qingyuan Zhenjun as bait to lure others.

The waters of the Aitira World, stirred up by her, remained unknown whether they would bring fortune or misfortune.

However, at least he now had a clear direction for the first step after the Golden Core: Yang Dan Hua Tian!

To cultivate the Golden Core and transform the Heaven of one's own Great Dao.

He transformed into a purple-gold thunder light and returned to Shenxiao Peak.

Next, he would devote himself to digesting the deposit given by Dongming Zhenjun, combine it with his own Shenxiao Dao Fruit, stabilize his Golden Core realm, and begin the cultivation of nurturing the core and the preliminary transformation of the Heaven.

As for Aitira, Xu Yunfan currently had no intention of going.

After reaching the Golden Core, all sorts of profound mysteries emerged.

[Name: Xu Yunfan
Cultivation Level: 1087 (Golden Core)
Skills: Shenxiao Nine Chen Profound Firmament Immortality Scripture (Perfected), Xuandu Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Codex (Perfected), Array Dao (Great Accomplishment)...]

Xu Yunfan, who had summoned his attribute panel, looked at it carefully. Under the divine intellect of a Golden Core Zhenjun, all the principles and techniques he had cultivated were already perfected. Even those that were not perfected before were rapidly pushed to the perfected state within these few short days, thanks to the immense spiritual will of the Golden Core realm and his deep understanding of the laws of the Great Dao.

The divine intellect of a Golden Core Zhenjun compared to that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator was a world of difference, like an old 1980s computer compared to a supercomputer. The gap was unimaginable.

His thoughts moved as fast as lightning, and his mental calculations could exhaust the subtle threads of the laws of heaven and earth. It was no wonder that it was said that all below the Golden Core were but ants; only upon reaching the Golden Core does one have the资格 to sit at the table.

Only Golden Core cultivators, after fusing with their Dao Fruits, truly touch the core of this world's power.

However, the path to longevity had only just begun.

The early stage of the Golden Core was merely a new starting point on the Dao path.

To achieve longevity, one must promote one's own Dao Fruit Grotto-heaven, making it stable and suspended, never falling or being destroyed.

At that time, even if one's physical lifespan was nearing its end, one could, relying on the close connection with the Grotto-heaven, have one's true spirit flee into the cycle of reincarnation, with one's past wisdom unbroken.

Then, using one's own Grotto-heaven as a foundation, one could accumulate and gather power. In the blink of an eye, one could find the Dao foundation of a previous life, restore one's strength, and achieve an alternative form of longevity.

Thinking up to this point, Xu Yunfan's brow furrowed slightly.

So, how does one advance to the mid-stage of the Golden Core?

The direction given by Dongming Zhenjun was Yang Dan Hua Tian.

Cultivation involves using the world's origin and the laws of the Great Dao to temper the Golden Core day and night, making it increasingly robust and condensed, like an eternal star.

And the world's origin and the laws of the Great Dao, in this Taihua Lingxu World, are most directly and supremely represented by the 108 Heavenly and Earthly Dao Fruits that form the foundation of this world's Heavenly Dao.

That is to say, swallowing other Dao Fruits, using multiple Dao Fruits to support one's own.

Xu Yunfan looked inward at his Dantian.

The Golden Core, formed by the fusion of his Shenxiao Dao Fruit and his own Grotto-heaven, was slowly rotating. Ninety-nine purple-gold dragons coiled around it, their roars accompanying the thunderous rumble. It contained the prototype of an endless thunder world, exhaling the immense power that shatters all laws and carries the imagery of heaven and earth.
