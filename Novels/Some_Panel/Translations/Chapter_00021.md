# Chapter 21: Mutual Delight

"Discussing a five-five split for the pills?" Jin Dafu was taken aback.

Yang Ji smiled and said, "To be frank, Old Brother, the pills I've consumed over the past year were all refined by myself. The spiritual herbs for refining them were even personally given to me by you."

"Refined them yourself?"

Jin Dafu's heart jolted. Although he had known Yang Ji for little over a year, he had some understanding of Yang Ji's character. This young man typically didn't boast. Could it be? He slowly raised his head, a faint guess forming in his mind, yet it felt absurd.

Yang Ji knew what he was thinking and immediately said, "Old Jin, take a portion of spiritual herbs for refining Spirit Blossom Pills and follow me to the back mountain cave."

Seeing Yang Ji move, Jin Dafu, in his state of surprise and doubt, also followed with the spiritual herbs.

As soon as they reached the cave entrance, they saw Huoyuan excitedly rushing to greet them. "Master, where have you been this past year? I thought you weren't coming back."

Master? Jin Dafu raised an eyebrow, staring blankly at the scene. This advanced alchemist was actually calling this alchemy apprentice 'Master'? He felt as if the world had gone topsy-turvy, suspecting auditory hallucinations, he couldn't help but shake his head. Looking at Yang Ji now, an expression of astonishment involuntarily appeared on Jin Dafu's face.

Could this fellow truly be a peak alchemist? For some unknown reason, as soon as this thought surfaced, Jin Dafu's heart rate couldn't help but quicken. Just as he was filled with suspicion, Yang Ji had already stepped into the cave.

Inside the stone cave, Jin Dafu concentrated his full attention, his eyes fixed on Yang Ji. He saw Yang Ji swipe his storage bag, producing an alchemy furnace. After enlarging it, he completely enveloped it with earth fire. His expression was calm and collected, unlike other alchemists who were meticulously cautious.

After warming the furnace, Yang Ji began his operation. Spiritual herb after spiritual herb was continuously thrown in, and with a burst of flame, they were completely melted down. The speed of his technique and the proficiency of his skill were truly seamless and fluid, truly displaying the demeanor of a Grandmaster. Jin Dafu was dumbfounded. Such operations, without a trace of unfamiliarity, showed just how formidable he was.

The more he watched, the more Jin Dafu noticed deeper details. The melting of the spiritual herbs and the precise control of the heat were truly meticulous. The ratio for blending the spiritual liquids was also completed in an instant, with no need to slowly adjust while observing the fusion trend of the liquids. His technique was incredibly熟练 (proficient). Jin Dafu was utterly shaken, his eyes burning with intense light. He had seen Huoyuan refine pills before, but his techniques and operations, compared to the person before him, were utterly pale in comparison, distant and not worth mentioning.

Could this person truly be a peak alchemist? Jin Dafu gazed deeply at Yang Ji, guessing in his heart. He didn't dare to think any grander. After all, there were only a few thousand alchemy masters in the entire Thousand Islands Sea Region. He couldn't possibly consider that direction, even though he believed in Yang Ji's strength. It was simply too preposterous, because Yang Ji was too young to have reached such a level.

Warming the furnace, melting the herbs, fusing the pills, dividing the pills, warming the pills—each step, performed by Yang Ji's hands, erupted with artistic sparks. It was truly a delight to behold, something that tense, cautious alchemists simply couldn't compare to; he truly possessed the demeanor of a master.

Although Yang Ji's alchemy techniques differed from other alchemists in some aspects, and some even violated common alchemy taboos, the result was what Jin Dafu wanted to see. Jin Dafu was a man with an active mind, capable of quickly accepting new things—this was a merchant's discerning eye. The process of alchemy didn't matter; if the result could be sold for a high price, then it was good.

When the pill formation was complete, Yang Ji slapped the alchemy furnace, and a dense burst of pill aura rushed forth with a rumble, instantly seizing Jin Dafu's heart. He couldn't help but rush forward, peering into the furnace, and immediately exclaimed, "Seven pills? He actually formed seven pills? Only three ruined, a seventy percent success rate?"

Yang Ji saw his astonished look and smiled faintly. He immediately reached out and grabbed the seven Spirit Blossom Pills into his palm. The reason only seven pills were formed was also intentional, as he didn't want to expose too much. If he were refining alone, he would undoubtedly achieve ten pills.

At this moment, he opened his palm, placing the pills before Jin Dafu, and said, "Old Jin, please inspect them. What do you think of the quality of these pills?"

"The pill body is flawless and translucent, with barely a trace of impurities. These are top-grade pills!" Jin Dafu's eyes widened. He scrutinized the pills, then looked at Yang Ji, trying to digest the shock Yang Ji had brought him.

This fellow... could he really be from a powerful great family?

Jin Dafu, as expected of someone who had seen much of the world, quickly calmed down. His wise eyes rolled, and then he burst into laughter, asking, "Brother Yang, are you an alchemy master?"

"No, but I am working hard to become one. The reason I sought your help in finding high-grade spiritual herbs is precisely because I want to practice. How could someone who hasn't even refined a single mid-grade spiritual pill be an alchemy master?" Yang Ji knew Jin Dafu was testing him and deliberately sighed. The pills refined this time were similar to those refined by Elder He Gu, only reaching the standard of a peak alchemist, preventing any clues from being seen. Clearly, he was deliberately hiding his alchemy skills.

After all, his strength was still too weak; exposing too much of his alchemy talent would be more harmful than beneficial. As for the current level of a peak alchemist, it's neither too high nor too low, resting at a safe critical point. Grandmasters wouldn't pay attention, but smaller shops would vie to recruit him, making it quite a comfortable position.

"So that's how it is! The spiritual herbs are no problem at all. Come, come, come, Brother, let's have a good talk." Jin Dafu believed most of it; after all, without a large quantity of high-grade spiritual herbs for practice, no one could improve out of thin air.

Yang Ji smiled and followed him out.

In the main hall of the Myriad Treasures Pavilion, at the innermost counter.

"Old Jin, you've just witnessed my alchemy skills. How about we discuss the pill division?" Yang Ji said with a smile.

"Haha, easy, easy," Jin Dafu's expression flickered as he said with a smile, "Brother, I'll provide the spiritual herbs, and you refine the pills. After deducting the cost of the spiritual herbs, how about a seventy-thirty split, with me taking seventy?"

"Old Jin, I recall you mentioning a fifty-fifty split last time," Yang Ji eyed him, deliberately drawing out his words in a teasing manner.

"Ah, Brother, my business isn't easy, you know. The daily expenses for manpower and resources are a huge drain. Please, Brother, sympathize with this old man," Jin Dafu pleaded with a hint of flattery.

"Old Jin, what if I, with my identity as a peak alchemist, were to go to other shops? Would they offer me a fifty-fifty split?" Yang Ji asked with a half-smile.

"Ah, Brother..." Jin Dafu's face showed difficulty. He also knew the weight of a peak alchemist's status; they were sought after everywhere, and Elder He Gu was an example. If he missed Yang Ji, this cash cow, then he would suffer a great loss. Gritting his teeth, seemingly having made a decision, he was about to speak.

Yang Ji looked at him and preemptively said with a smile, "Old Jin, there's no need to be troubled. After we split fifty-fifty, I'll still be buying a large amount of high-grade spiritual herbs from you. Won't you earn those spiritual stones back anyway?"

"That's true, but..." Jin Dafu's face showed his dilemma, and a thought surfaced above his head: [But I'll be earning less!]

"Oh well, since Brother has already spoken this far, what more can this old man say? Then it shall be a fifty-fifty split." Jin Dafu let out a feigned sigh. Looking at Yang Ji, his shifty eyes darted about slyly, and another thought surfaced above his head:

[Hmph, only I, Jin Dafu, take advantage of others. Is it going to be the other way around today? Just wait and see. I'll take all your spiritual stones, principal and interest, with high-grade spiritual herbs later!]

This fellow was scheming again. Yang Ji glanced at him, mimicking his smile, and said, "Then Old Jin, you'll have to be quick in searching for high-grade spiritual herbs, won't you? It's best to earn those spiritual stones back sooner."

"..." Jin Dafu froze for a moment. Why did he feel like he was being played?

...

The pill division was settled, with both sides relatively satisfied. Giving Jin Dafu a small taste of sweetness was primarily to leverage his channels to acquire high-grade spiritual herbs, which was Yang Ji's main objective. With high-grade spiritual herbs, he could refine pills that improved cultivation speed faster, allowing him to reach the tenth level of Qi Condensation before the sect began recruiting outer disciples.

Jin Dafu was backed by the Jin family, possessing a wide network of connections, so Yang Ji believed it wouldn't take long to find high-grade spiritual herbs. Yang Ji now only needed to wait patiently, as he didn't think he could find them faster by searching himself. For now, cultivating with top-grade Spirit Blossom Pills was sufficient.

In fact, he didn't lose anything in the fifty-fifty deal with Jin Dafu. On the surface, his pill success rate was only seventy percent, but he could actually achieve one hundred percent success. The extra thirty percent he could then "line his own pockets" with. Thinking of this, Yang Ji couldn't help but chuckle mischievously. Jin Dafu still wanted to trick him? No way.

However, no one ever complained about having too many high-grade spiritual herbs, so he planned to inquire at other shops as well. Making multiple plans was always best, rather than putting all his eggs in one basket.
