# Chapter 32: Should True Experts Be Modest and Humble?

Another part of Stony Brook Forest.

Lin Jiang was covered in wounds, his long spear flailing left and right, clearly on the defensive.

He was entangled with two massive Scorched-Ring Wolves, their bodies covered in concentric patterns. Judging by their auras, one was an early Ninth-Rank, the other a mid Ninth-Rank.

Scorched-Ring Wolves weren't particularly strong among Ninth-Rank spirit beasts, but they were exceptionally cunning and never appeared alone, always coordinating with each other.

"If this drags on, it'll be disadvantageous for me." Lin Jiang's brows furrowed deeply. Even if the trial were to end here, he needed to conclude this fight quickly. He was already severely wounded. If more Scorched-Ring Wolves were to appear, he would likely be in grave danger.

Among the True Disciples, Murong Xiao possessed a half-demon physique, and Ying Bing was an undeniable powerhouse, capable of driving even geniuses to despair. Li Mo... he heard the boy was extremely popular? In any case, only Lin Jiang himself remained obscure and unknown.

Lin Jiang had broken through to the Qi-Blood Realm's Six Meridians and honed his spear art to Minor Accomplishment, enough to contend with most mid Ninth-Rank spirit beasts. He had intended to make a grand debut, but stopping here felt incredibly frustrating.

"I'll risk it!"

Lin Jiang had a trump card, a绝招 (ultimate skill), which he had intended to use against a late Ninth-Rank spirit beast. He surged his vital energy, thrusting his spear forward with a speed that tore through the air.

The Scorched-Ring Wolf with the stronger aura was instantly impaled.

However...

"Awooo!"

The early Ninth-Rank wolf showed no intention of avenging its companion. Instead, it let out a howl.

"Oh no, it's summoning the pack!" Lin Jiang's expression instantly changed. But he had just expended his killer move, and his strength was momentarily weakened, leaving him no time to stop it.

The next moment, something strange occurred.

"Awooo... woowoowoo..."

The howl meant to summon the pack unexpectedly transformed into a pitiful whimper.

A figure emerged from the stone forest, dragging the Scorched-Ring Wolf.

"You're a True Disciple, aren't you? Your name is... Lin Jiang?" A voice, laced with a hint of a smile, carried a certain oppressive quality.

"Hm?"

"Wang Hu?" Lin Jiang recognized the newcomer.

It might sound rude, but during Wang Hu's initiation ceremony, he had tumbled down the Heaven-Ascending Staircase like a rolling gourd, falling all the way from the Inner Sect to the Outer Sect. This incident was widely known within the sect, making it hard not to recognize him.

Now, it seemed his true strength might not be inferior to Lin Jiang's own.

"Many thanks, Brother Wang." Lin Jiang let out a breath.

"Hehe, the one you killed is yours, the one I caught is mine. No objections, right?" Wang Hu snapped the Scorched-Ring Wolf's neck.

"Naturally." Lin Jiang breathed a sigh of relief. It was already fortunate that the mid Ninth-Rank wolf could be counted as his spoils.

*Gulp, gulp—*

Just as Lin Jiang finished firing his signal arrow, a sound of vigorous drinking reached his ears. He turned back, his brows furrowing even deeper than before.

Wang Hu had bitten open the Scorched-Ring Wolf's neck and was guzzling the foul-smelling wolf blood with an expression of pure enjoyment. Lin Jiang felt a chill of disgust creep into his heart.

"Two Scorched-Ring Wolves."

"One for Lin Jiang, one for Wang Hu."

The nearest elder quickly arrived, performed a brief inspection, and then departed, carrying the two wolf corpses.

As the elder's figure receded, Lin Jiang clasped his hands and prepared to leave. "I shall take my leave." Wang Hu gave him an uncomfortable feeling, and after witnessing that scene, he truly wished to avoid any further contact.

He had only taken two steps when a rustling sound came from behind him. "Who said you could leave?"

Lin Jiang stopped, his pupils constricting sharply as he turned around.

Wang Hu's arms were expanding at an eerie speed, rapidly sprouting mottled fur. The gaze he directed at Lin Jiang had almost completely lost all human emotion, replaced by the bloodlust and ferocity of a wild beast.

Just now... Wang Hu had deliberately lured the nearest elder away?

"You!"

*Whoosh—*

Before Lin Jiang could utter another word, a gust of foul wind slammed into his face.

Meanwhile, not far away.

"What's that commotion ahead?"

Li Mo, bare-chested, moved through the stone forest. Don't misunderstand; Li Mo had no strange fetishes. He primarily cherished the clothes his mother had sewn by hand. Knowing they wouldn't survive a fight anyway, he simply stored them in his system space.

Hearing the intense sounds of battle ahead, he quickened his pace.

Then, upon arriving, he saw two figures locked in combat.

Lin Jiang was clearly at a disadvantage, forced into a sorry state, blood flowing freely from his body. If this continued, he might die from blood loss even if his opponent didn't kill him.

"What kind of spirit beast is Lin Jiang fighting?"

"No, that's not a spirit beast..." Li Mo noticed something amiss.

His Heavenly Fate Divine Eye swept over them.

**[Name: Lin Jiang]**
**[Age: 16]**
**[Physique: Mantis Leg, Green Serpent Spine, Magpie-Painted Shoulder]**
**[Realm: Qi-Blood Realm, Six Meridians]**
**[Fate: Blue-Black]**
**[Evaluation: This person has decent talent, but is hasty and impetuous, overly rigid and prone to breaking. If he can awaken in time, he might yet reach a higher level.]**
**[Recent Encounter: After a fierce battle and before recovering, he encounters Wang Hu, whose sanity has been devoured by a Beast Seed. Though he will not die, he will be severely wounded and completely disheartened.]**

"That's Wang Hu?" Li Mo's brows raised slightly.

Ingesting a Beast Seed could turn someone into this monstrous state?

Also, Wang Hu was clearly trying to kill him, yet the Heavenly Fate Divine Eye said Lin Jiang wouldn't die in the end...

Were the elders involved?

A realization dawned on Li Mo. It must be the elders, silently observing Wang Hu's movements. For some reason, they hadn't directly intervened, but they also wouldn't watch a True Disciple die in vain, so they would eventually save Lin Jiang.

"The elders saving him counts, but if I act, it's another blue investment."
