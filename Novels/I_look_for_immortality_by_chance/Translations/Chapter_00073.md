**Chapter 73: The Little Thief!**  

The expedition was short—only three days. To fully occupy a spirit peak, one had to lay down an array formation and stabilize it for a full day. This left even less time for the disciples to subdue the demonic beasts and outcompete their peers.  

No one dared to wander aimlessly.  

But after his battle with the Water Ape, Gu Yuan had a clear understanding of his own strength. Without hesitation, he headed straight for the next spirit peak.  

A top-tier spirit peak only yielded around four hundred spirit stones per year. To accumulate true wealth, one would need years of patience—time Gu Yuan had no intention of wasting.  

"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."  

But as a seasoned cultivator, he wasn’t about to make such simplistic choices. Gu Yuan wanted it all.  

First, he would plunder the other spirit peaks, gathering as many resources as possible. Then, on the final day, he would claim one for himself. This way, he secured both immediate gains and future benefits—wealth now and wealth later.  

---  

"Brother Su, we can’t wait any longer! This Crimson Flame Fox is already at the eighth level of Qi Refinement—it’s too strong!"  

Just as Gu Yuan stepped onto another spirit peak, a desperate cry for help echoed from the mountain.  

Amidst the dense forest, a pack of emerald-green wolf demons and crimson fox demons, led by a massive fox the size of a small calf, were besieging two robed youths.  

One of them held a golden cup that emitted layers of radiant light, forming an unbreakable barrier several yards wide. The demonic beasts howled furiously but couldn’t breach the golden shield.  

However, the lead fox was terrifyingly powerful. Its fiery red tail burned like actual flames, and with a mere exhale, it spewed forth a scorching sea of fire.  

*Whoosh!*  

The flames licked at the golden barrier, rapidly draining its radiance. The young man’s face paled as he shouted, "Brother Su, hurry! I can’t hold on much longer!"  

Behind him, a broad-browed youth sat cross-legged, a verdant sword seal resting on his lap. The surrounding spiritual energy surged into the seal like a tidal wave.  

*Clang!*  

At the plea, the youth’s eyes snapped open, revealing a flickering sword shadow within. The sword seal erupted with dazzling light, and a streak of piercing brilliance shot forth like a bolt of green lightning, striking the massive fox with unstoppable force.  

"Amazing sword technique!" the golden cup-wielding youth exclaimed in delight.  

But the broad-browed youth’s expression suddenly changed.  

---  

**"Not good!"**  

*Thud!*  

The sword light pierced the fox—yet no blood spilled.  

The massive fox dissipated like a bubble, revealing itself to be nothing more than an illusion.  

At that moment, the real fox reappeared behind the two youths. This time, its fiery red fur shimmered with an additional layer of dreamlike iridescence.  

*Screech!*  

It let out a piercing cry, and strange ripples of sound swept outward.  

Worse, the sea of flames it unleashed was even fiercer than before, roaring toward the two with devastating force. The golden cup’s barrier flickered weakly before finally dimming completely.  

"This isn’t a Crimson Flame Fox—it’s a *Dreamflame Fox*!" The golden cup-wielding youth’s face twisted in horror, and the broad-browed youth’s eyes darkened with despair.  

They had been tricked.  

This was no ordinary fox—it was an eighth-level Qi Refinement *variant* demon beast.  

*Splash!*  

Just as they resigned themselves to their fate, a torrential downpour suddenly erupted from the sky. The heavy rain drowned out all sound, and dense water-attribute spiritual energy suppressed all spells. The scorching flames gradually sputtered out under the deluge.  

At the same time, a thick mist inexplicably rose, obscuring everything in sight.  

"Which senior brother is aiding us?" the golden cup-wielding youth called out, his voice a mix of shock and hope, but the mist made it impossible to see.  

Only the broad-browed youth, with his sharper spiritual sense, could faintly hear the fox’s agonized shrieks—as if it had encountered something terrifying.  

*Whoosh!*  

Just as the two were still reeling, the mist vanished as suddenly as it had appeared.  

*Screech!*  

A pitiful wail snapped them back to reality.  

They looked up—only to find the once-majestic fox now standing before them, completely bald and hideously ugly.  

Every single strand of its lustrous fur had been plucked clean, leaving not a single hair behind.  

Even its bulging storage pouch was gone.  

"The Dreamflame Fox is a rare variant—its fur is a precious spiritual material..."  

"Then this..."  

The broad-browed youth suddenly had an epiphany. He turned his head and saw a graceful figure flitting through the spirit peak, swiftly harvesting spirit herbs and fruits before vanishing like a phantom.  

"To *plunder* a spirit peak—just how confident is this senior brother?" he muttered in disbelief.  

---  

*Screech!*  

Before he could ponder further, the enraged fox, now half its former strength but still vicious, lunged at them with renewed fury.  

"Damn it! That senior brother has no decency—he didn’t even bother finishing off the fox, afraid we’d benefit from it!" the golden cup-wielding youth cursed.  

But by then, the so-called "senior brother" had already swept through the peak like a gust of wind, heading straight for the third spirit peak.  

---  

**"Which senior brother is here? Thank you for your aid!"**  

On the third spirit peak, two seventh-level Qi Refinement outer disciples were locked in a desperate battle against an eighth-level Frostwing Condor. Just as the fight reached its climax, a thick mist descended.  

Moments later, the condor let out a shrill cry as its spirit-feathers—imbued with natural Dao patterns—were ruthlessly plucked away.  

The two disciples were overjoyed, but before they could even finish their thanks, the mist dispersed. The Frostwing Condor, now in even greater agony, unleashed a deadly blizzard upon them.  

"Damn it! That guy was just here to loot the peak!"  

---  

On the fourth spirit peak, a young man in exquisite robes, his sleeves embroidered with eight emerald leaves, sat meditating atop the summit. Below him, a horde of demonic beasts cowered in submission.  

Satisfied, the youth took out a golden array disk and infused it with spiritual energy, embedding it into the mountain.  

*Hummm...*  

Invisible array patterns slowly seeped into the spirit peak. In just one day, he would fully claim this land. Once the formation was complete, no one below Foundation Establishment would be able to seize it from him.  

*Whoosh!*  

But just then, a figure suddenly descended from another peak and began harvesting spirit herbs and fruits without a word.  

A spirit peak was vast—normally, no one would strip it bare in one go.  

Yet this person acted like a bandit, taking everything in sight.  

Worse, his discernment was frighteningly sharp. Even herbs hidden for years, undiscovered by the mountain’s own demonic beasts, were effortlessly found and plucked.  

**"Where did this little thief come from, daring to rob *my* spirit peak?!"**
