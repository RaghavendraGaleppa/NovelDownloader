Chapter 190: The Golden Scale Talent, Weighing the Luck!

It turns out...

More than a hundred years ago, ten Golden Scales descended from the heavens and fell into the lake. The noble clans drained the water and dug up the ground, hoping to find [Refined Treasures].

However, those "Golden Scales" seemed both real and illusory. No matter what methods the noble clans employed, they were difficult to find.

Later, the various clans discussed the matter and learned that the "Golden Scales" loved to feed on the talent aura of proud geniuses.

Using this as bait, perhaps they could lure them out.

The noble clans of the Prefecture City spent vast amounts of money over the years to host the "Talent Tower Banquet." They exerted great effort to build momentum and create exquisite dishes, all to stimulate the geniuses to display their skills and unleash their talent aura.

Beneath the Heavenly Man Tower stood an ancient bronze cauldron, used to contain the talent aura of the geniuses.

Years, decades, even centuries... Countless geniuses and heroes feasted and drank in the tower, fully displaying their talents. In their speech and conduct, the aura of pride fell, gathering in the great cauldron at the bottom of the lake.

In exchange, the Golden Scales leaped from the pool, bathing the area in golden light.

The golden light spl, the golden light splashed, and silence fell over all sounds. The golden fish swam rapidly through the pool, flowing with light and color.

The geniuses in the tower all looked toward the lake, exclaiming in surprise and crying out incessantly. One genius said, "One hundred and six of the Human Yellow, the Golden Scale in the pool! It is the Golden Scale in the pool!"

"This rare Refined Treasure is said to contain the Way of Arts, with a chance to comprehend a miraculous technique!"

The golden light was seductive. There are countless strange events and objects in the heavens and earth. The golden light illuminated Li Xian's face. He gazed at the Golden Scale for a long time, thinking:

"The appearance of this Golden Scale is no coincidence. After the flesh of demons is boiled in a great fire, it can remove the toxicity and turn into pure [Heaven and Earth Essence], hence it is also called [Refined Treasure]."

"However, all demon flesh is only considered a lower-grade Refined Treasure. True Refined Treasures are nurtured by the heavens and earth and come in various shapes. This... [Golden Scale] is an excellent Refined Treasure. To see it today is truly my fortune!"

Li Xian pondered...

At the top of the Dragon Gate Tower.

Ou Yezi laughed loudly several times and said in a great voice, "One hundred and six of the Human Yellow, the Golden Scale in the pool. Heavenly treasures, who obtains them, who uses them, ultimately comes down to a single word: 'Fate.' I have just arrived at the Qiongfu Prefecture City and already see such a Refined Treasure. This shows that my fate with it is very deep."

He had waited a long time for this moment. Immediately, he stamped his feet and flipped through the air, flying toward the lake to grab it.

The Golden Scale swung its tail and dodged to the side, avoiding the grasp with incredible speed, like a flowing light.

Ou Yezi laughed and scolded, "Good fish, don't run!" He was about to grab it again when he saw a soft whip strike. He sidestepped to avoid it. The end of the soft whip had a small silver awl. It touched the surface of the lake, and with a "rumble," the water surged, waves reaching over a dozen zhang high.

Ou Yezi shook his hand, shattering the water screen, and took the opportunity to grab the soft whip, pulling hard.

The one who had just swung the whip was an old woman from the Cao family. She had profound strength and excellent whip technique, like a spirit snake. This martial art was called 'Tail-Pointing Whip'.

When the whip struck, the force traveled along the whip's body, becoming stronger the further it went! She wielded the whip as if it were her hand, not using the whip body to strike, but using the small silver cone at the tail to poke people. Her methods were extremely superb.

But Ou Yezi's martial arts, cultivation, experience, and knowledge were all superior to hers. Her attack missed, and it was too late to retract the whip. Ou Yezi knew that any whip user had great power, but also obvious drawbacks:

The whip body was too long, and transmitting force and Qi required intervals, making it difficult to strike instantly. He seized this gap, grabbed the whip body, and pulled hard. The old woman cried out in danger, about to fall into the lake.

Several members of the Cao family acted together, stepping on boats to catch the old woman. She reacted quickly, abandoning the whip to escape, thus avoiding the danger of falling into the water.

The Cao, Chu, Yuwen, and Lin families of the Prefecture City all came on boats, confronting Ou Yezi with furrowed brows.

The Cao family sent out three clan elders, dressed in brocade, noble as heavens. Cao Shuang said, "Senior Ou Yezi, we respect your skill, but for you to suddenly make such a move, do you intend to seize it by force?"

"Baseless accusations. This Golden Scale was waiting for me. I am merely taking it as promised. How can that be considered seizing by force?" Ou Yezi stood on the water, drinking heavily, wine stains on his beard, looking very untidy.

"You... you shameless old thing, truly hateful!" the old woman who had just suffered said in anger.

Ou Yezi said, "What? Am I wrong? Tell me, why did the Golden Scale not appear earlier or later? It just happened to appear as I traveled here. Where in this world could there be such a coincidence?"

"If this is not fate, then what is?"

"You clearly planned this in advance..." the old woman roared, and upon being stimulated, she wanted to expose Ou Yezi's scheme.

But halfway through, Cao Shuang pulled her back. The matter of the Golden Scale in the pool was a secret of the Cao, Lin, Yuwen, and Chu clans. There was a Talent Tower Banquet every year, but very few knew of the relationship between the banquet and the "Golden Scale."

Cao Shuang thought: "Ou Yezi looks rough, but he is actually a sly old fox. He knows we dare not speak out. Unfortunately, his strength is immense. He showed just a few moves earlier and is already very formidable, hard to deal with. If the elders of our Prefecture City clans fought him one by one, none would be his match."

"What terrible luck. After accumulating for over a decade, the the the to,, he he he he, to... the the the, to the the the the the the the the the the the... his the the the the the... the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the Golden Scale, but the Golden Scale dodged desperately.

Cao Shuang said, "Senior Ou Yezi, are you determined to enjoy this Golden Scale alone?"

"Vulgar, truly vulgar."

Ou Yezi said proudly, "The way you speak, it's as if I'm seizing your treasure and opportunity by force. Who am I, Ou Yezi? I have forged countless divine artifacts and weapons, revered by the world and loved by the people. It is not that I want to swallow the Golden Scale alone, but that the Golden Scale, moved by my talent aura, wants to follow me."

"This kind of heavenly treasure naturally chooses its master."

The Yuwen, Chu, Cao, and Lin families were left speechless.

The Golden Scale loves to feed on the aura of proud geniuses, preferring young and promising, high-spirited youths.

Ou Yezi is indeed talented and high-spirited, but he is no longer young, not "young and promising." That is why, although Ou Yezi tried to grab it forcefully, the Golden Scale desperately avoided him.

Lin Bei of the Lin family said, "Then, according to Senior Ou Yezi, if the Golden Scale does not choose you as its master, you will not touch it?"

"I, Ou Yezi, am a man of my word," Ou Yezi laughed.

Cao Shuang said, "Very well, then we will stand here and watche standing the Golden Fish chooses its master." The clan elders stood on boats in the lake.

The Golden Scale was lively, like a newborn sun. It soon noticed the crowd and swam toward an elder of the Cao family. Ou Yezi suddenly struck, launching a palm from a distance of ten zhang. He shattered the boat under the elder's feet. The Golden Scale was startled and fled far away.

The elder leaped onto another person's boat, extremely embarrassed.

"Senior Ou Yezi, what do you mean?" Cao family asked in anger, "You said it would to you, but you said to let the Golden Scale choose its master!"

"Hmph! You people are too much!" Ou Yezi said viciously. "Seeing that I am alone, you set up a scheme to deceive me and cheated in secret!"

"What cheating? Don't talk nonsense," the Cao family retorted, their hearts guilty. The Cao family members carried a strange fragrance that did attract the Golden Scale.

"I am so high-spirited, yet the Golden Scale did not choose me but chose your Cao family. If this isn't cheating, then what is?" Ou Yezi retorted. He paused and then said, "Again, again, let's do it again. Let the Golden Scale choose again."

Upon hearing this, the Cao family was both happy and angry. They were happy that their method was not seen through, and angry that Ou Yezi was being unreasonable and determined to seize it.

The Golden Scale could choose a thousand times. As long as it was not him, he would interfere until the Golden Scale chose him as its master.

The faces of the clan elders turned cold. An elder of the Yuwen family said coldly, "Since Senior Ou Yezi, you rely on your high martial cultivation to seize things by force, why not just say it clearly? It's true your cultivation is high, but if our families join forces, are we afraid of you?"

"Hmph, then let's fight," Ou Yezi replied.

"Wait!"

Lin Bei stepped forward. After shouting "wait," he saw Ou Yezi had the intention to hold back, confirming his suspicion.

He guessed: "Ou Yezi looks fierce, but he is unwilling to fight us to the death for the Golden Scale. Everything he does is just to get a share of the pie."

He secretly assessed the strength of both sides.

With the strength of the Prefecture City forces, Ou Yezi would not have an easy time seizing it by force. Although his martial realm was higher, with the clan elders, the Prefecture soldiers' formations, and various mechanical means, Ou Yezi would find it difficult to cope.

Martial artists possess great power and enjoy a long lifespan. They stand like towering mountains, guarding a region. But the combined strength of many can move mountains!

Moreover, Ou Yezi looked rough but was actually meticulous. His current tough attitude, striking at the slightest disagreement, was actually to seize the initiative, show his attitude, and wait for negotiation.

Lin Bei saw through this and said, "Heavenly treasures are for those with fate to obtain. Everyone present can be considered to have a fate. Senior Ou Yezi, how about this... let's share it equally?"

Ou Yezi's expression softened greatly; he was waiting for these words. He asked, "How to share? If you make sense, it's not impossible."

Lin Bei said, "The forces here are the Lin, Cao, Yuwen, and Chu families. Adding Senior Ou Yezi, that makes five."

"The Golden Scale is born, let's divide it into five: fish eyes, fish head, fish belly, fish body, and fish tail. Each of us takes one. What do you all think?"

Ou Yezi was secretly delighted and nodded slightly. He stroked his beard and said, "Fine, fine, I am not a domineering person. What you say makes sense, it's not impossible."

The other clans were unhappy, but to avoid trouble, they had no objections.

"Gentlemen, allow me to interject. In my opinion, it is still somewhat inappropriate," a voice suddenly came. Zhou Shijie stood at the top of the tower and spoke loudly to the crowd.

Ou Yezi, Lin Bei, Cao Shuang, Yuwen Hou, and others were stunned. Zhou Shijie said, "This Golden Scale contains a Scale Pearl. In my opinion, it can be divided into one more portion."

"Since the fish body, eyes, belly, tail, and head all have owners, then logically, this [Scale Pearl] should have a share for us, right?"

"Scale Pearl?" Everyone was stunned.

The Golden Scale's light shone, golden and dazzling. It held a golden pearl in its mouth, but no one had noticed.

Among the Golden Scales in the lake, those holding a golden pearl are top-tier [Golden Scales], containing a stronger essence of the Arts.

"Redistribute!" the Cao family said.

"I'm afraid that's not appropriate," Zhou Shijie said proudly. "Though I am young, I have some knowledge. The Golden Scale is a [Refined Treasure] nurtured by the heavens and earth, feeding on the talent aura of the proud geniuses of the mortal world. In the end, this Golden Scale came for us young talents, or... to be immodest, for me, Zhou Shijie."

"Just now, the clan elders and seniors said to divide it according to fate. I think my fate with this object is no less than yours. Since you have divided the head, tail, and body... logically, this Scale Pearl should be mine, right?"

He was neither humble nor arrogant, his words sharp.

"Brat, what does this have to do with you?" Ou Yezi scolded.

There is a "Zhou Clan" in Qiongfu, but Zhou Shijie is not a member of that great clan. His background is elsewhere, but in the vast Qiongfu, he is not without support.

Zhou Shijie said loudly, "Senior Ou Yezi, is what I said unreasonable?"

"I don't care about your damn reason," Ou Yezi said, his eyes hot for the Scale Pearl.

"Is that so?" Zhou Shijie smiled. He shook his shoulders, and a unique aura spread around him.

He used "Luck" as a scale to weigh the道理 (reason/principle) of this matter.
