# Chapter 68: Spirit Stones Acquired, the Jade Chime Sounds  

"Senior Brother Gu, you're here!"  

"Today is the last day for silk collection. After this, the Rainbow Cloud Spiders will enter full hibernation and won't produce any more silk."  

On the Spirit Crane Island, snowflakes drifted down, blanketing the land in silver. A young woman dressed in colorful robes stood before a cave entrance, speaking to a tall young man.  

The Spirit Beast Hall, responsible for raising spiritual beasts, mirrored the changing seasons of the outside world. Heavy snow now covered the island.  

"Thank you for letting me know, Junior Sister," Gu Yuan replied with a light chuckle.  

"I'm so envious of you, Senior Brother. With your high cultivation, you can take on the silk collection mission and earn twenty spirit stones every half month. Over these two months, you must have already earned sixty spirit stones!"  

"Unlike me—I can only cut grass for the Azure Cloud Cranes and feed the Fire Crow Birds with spiritual water. Each task only earns me two or three spirit stones. In these two months, I've barely scraped together a little over ten spirit stones."  

"Comparing people really makes you despair!"  

The colorful-robed girl counted on her fingers before sighing heavily.  

Hearing this, Gu Yuan could only shake his head with a faint smile.  

If she knew that his silk collection wasn't for the spirit stones at all but for the spirit stone vein behind the Water Curtain Grotto, she might die of envy.  

Of course, Gu Yuan had no intention of revealing this to anyone. Instead, he felt a sudden realization.  

"Working odd jobs… will never lead to the pinnacle of the Dao."  

"The Rogue Cultivator's Manual was right. Cultivation can be steady, and one shouldn't rush for quick success. But when it comes to earning spirit stones, one must seek multiple sources of income and not rely solely on labor…"  

"Ah, Senior Brother Gu, are you looking for a Dao companion?"  

At that moment, the girl suddenly turned her head and blinked at Gu Yuan.  

"You?"  

Since they were already familiar, Gu Yuan glanced at her before chuckling.  

Though the girl was charming with fair, delicate skin, in the world of cultivation, she was merely average in appearance—not to mention her rather unremarkable figure.  

She couldn't spark even the slightest interest in him.  

"Not me!"  

The girl wrinkled her nose in displeasure but still tugged at Gu Yuan's sleeve, whispering, "It's Senior Sister Yun Hanxiu!"  

"Senior Sister Yun may also come from a humble background, but her talent is outstanding! She's only just over twenty years old and is already at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement—just like you, Senior Brother!"  

"Not only that, but she also knows alchemy! A Foundation Establishment elder from the Alchemy Hall has taken a liking to her and plans to take her as a disciple once he finishes his seclusion!"  

"So, Senior Brother Gu, what do you think? Want to give it a try? I'm very close with Senior Sister Yun—I can help arrange things for you!"  

The girl spoke temptingly.  

"How could I dare to marry before achieving the Great Dao?"  

Gu Yuan simply shook his head.  

"Senior Brother's ambitions are truly high! But throughout history, how many have actually achieved the Great Dao? Most end up marrying and having children. Many of the great families in the sect were founded this way."  

"Senior Sister Yun isn't in high demand yet, but once she becomes a disciple, you might not even have a chance to pursue her!"  

"Opportunities like this don't come often!"  

The girl looked at him with an expression that screamed, "Hurry up and seize the chance!"  

But Gu Yuan only patted her head. "Alright, go cut grass for the cranes. You still have to feed the Fire Crow Birds later."  

At the mention of cutting grass and feeding birds, the girl's face fell. With a huff, she shook off Gu Yuan's sleeve and stomped away reluctantly.  

Watching her retreating figure, Gu Yuan sighed deeply.  

Marriage and children—he hoped that day would never come for him.  

With this thought in mind, he turned and entered the cave to collect silk twice. Then, after ensuring no one was around, he made his way to the Water Curtain Grotto.  

---  

"Chirp chirp!"  

"Alright, alright, drink up!"  

Behind the waterfall of the Water Curtain Grotto, Gu Yuan and the Golden-Backed Ape with dual pupils feasted on spirit fruits and wine, thoroughly enjoying themselves.  

And why wouldn't Gu Yuan be happy?  

His frequent visits to Spirit Crane Island served two purposes. First, to complete the silk collection mission—once a mission was accepted from the Fate Hall, it had to be fulfilled unless there was an urgent matter.  

Second, of course, was for the delicious and cultivation-boosting "Monkey Wine" and "Hundred-Flavored Fruits."  

These spirit wines and fruits were expensive in the outside world. But after striking a deal with the old ape, the Golden-Backed Ape tribe treated him with sincerity, hosting him with feasts every time he visited.  

With good food, fine wine, and cultivation benefits, why not indulge?  

It was far better than bitter cultivation in the Dry Origin Cave.  

"Chirp chirp!"  

As man and ape reveled, a brownish-yellow spirit monkey hurried over from deeper in the cave, pointing inward and chattering excitedly.  

"Hmm? Have all the spirit stones been mined?"  

Over time, Gu Yuan had learned a bit of the ape language. Combined with the monkey's gestures, he quickly grasped the meaning.  

"If that's the case, let's go take a look."  

The white-furred elder ape, curled up nearby, opened its eyes and spoke to Gu Yuan.  

The dual-pupiled Golden-Backed Ape then carried the elder on its back, and together with Gu Yuan, they ventured deeper into the cave.  

The entire cliff wall had been hollowed out into a massive cavern, its surface pockmarked and scarred.  

On the ground, a large pile of spirit stones gleamed with a rich, radiant glow.  

"Well... this is all of it. It's slightly less than expected—only enough to be divided into fourteen hundred stones."  

Looking at the spirit stones, the elder ape sighed.  

Originally, the vein was estimated to yield three thousand stones. But counting the fourteen hundred here and the earlier shares, the total only amounted to twenty-eight hundred—less than anticipated.  

"Given the circumstances, this will have to do."  

Gu Yuan, however, wasn't bothered. Fifteen hundred stones were more than enough to satisfy him.  

"Very well. Young Daoist, please take a thousand stones—seven hundred as your share, one hundred as the agreed compensation, and two hundred as an advance from our tribe. We hope you'll keep an eye out for Earth Demon treasures for us."  

The elder ape waved its hand, and the pile of stones split into two portions—one large, one small.  

"Aren't you afraid I'll take the stones and not fulfill my end of the bargain?"  

Gu Yuan looked at the stones and suddenly grinned.  

"Short-sighted fools might, but those who aspire to the Great Dao never would."  

The elder ape smiled faintly.  

Even trapped on Spirit Crane Island, the goodwill of an Earth Demon was invaluable.  

"Haha! Since you trust me so, I won't stand on ceremony!"  

Gu Yuan laughed heartily before flicking his sleeve, sweeping the stones into his storage pouch.  

Man and ape exchanged glances before bursting into laughter.  

*Dong!*  

*Dong!*  

*Dong!*  

Just then, the deep tolling of a bell resounded endlessly throughout the entire Green Peak Dao Academy.  

Hearing this, the elder ape's expression shifted.  

"The Golden Bell and Jade Chime? Is the academy mobilizing for war again?"  

"Young Daoist, I hope you haven't registered your name in the Crimson-Gold Jade Ledger?"  

The white-furred elder ape looked at Gu Yuan with concern.  

"Don't worry. I have my ways."  

Gu Yuan merely clasped his hands behind his back and smiled calmly.
