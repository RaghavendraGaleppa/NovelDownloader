# Chapter 108: The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer

"This is the forging technique of the Mechanism Hall. Whether near or far, it can be controlled at will."

When the second voice rang out, Xu Yunfan was startled to realize that Zhan Yan was not alone. Standing beside him was a short, sturdy old man with an iron claw attached to his left arm.

This was Mo Han, the Hall Master of the Mechanism Hall. The entire Mechanism City of the Heavenly Craft Cave was constructed by this man, leading the Heavenly Craft Department and the Mechanism Hall in a fifty-year effort.

Xu Yunfan cupped his fists in salute. "Hall Master Mo!"

Mo Han waved his hand, his eyes fixed unblinkingly on the heavy hammer in Zhan Yan's hand.

Zhan Yan laughed heartily. "Old man, don't even think about it. This treasure artifact took me two months of hard work to complete."

Mo Han snorted lightly. "I have already memorized the forging technique. It is not impossible for me to forge another one in the future."

Zhan Yan replied, "Your mechanisms lack the spirit infused by a master craftsman's dedication and the nourishment of vital energy. They are merely empty shells. Even if you recast them for a hundred years, they would still be nothing but scrap metal."

"Old bastard, just you wait! The Mechanism Hall of the Heavenly Craft Cave existed even before the Great Zhou Dynasty was founded. When I bring out my masterpiece, I'll make you kneel before me and call me Grandpa!"

Mo Han was practically jumping with frustration. This old bastard had come begging and scraping to ask for help just a while ago, but now that the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was complete, he was starting to get on his high horse.

Zhan Yan laughed three times and stopped talking, not wanting to push Mo Han too far.

Fu Jin couldn't help but step forward. He rubbed his rough palms on his clothes before using his calloused fingers to caress the spiral patterns on the hammer's handle. "Master? Was this Thunderfire Qilin Hammer forged using meteoric iron mixed with lightning-struck charcoal?"

"Wrong!"

Zhan Yan plunged the heavy hammer into the quenching pool. Amidst the white steam rising from the cold pool water meeting the heat, a deafening clang, like a muffled war drum, echoed and made one's heart skip a beat.

"The main material is the sky iron that fell in Youzhou three hundred years ago, paired with sixty-four catties of South Sea Thunder纹 Steel. Of course, there was also the finishing touch provided by your junior brother; otherwise, it could not have been cast."

Without looking back, Zhan Yan, his eyes bloodshot, stared intently at the final quenching process.

The moment the pool water began to boil, twelve strong men suddenly pulled on the iron chains, and the entire Thunderfire Pool began to tilt slowly!

Xu Yunfan watched as the red-hot hammer body gradually turned a dark, lustrous color within the quenching liquid. A sharp light suddenly flared between the scale-like patterns on the hammer head, and thunder and fire patterns intertwined along the handle.

"The most ingenious part of this hammer is the recoil mechanism. I have to admit, the Mechanism Hall has some truly imaginative ideas."

Hearing Zhan Yan's praise, Mo Han finally stopped blowing his beard and glaring. He appeared very calm, but the upturned corners of his eyes betrayed the old man's pride.

Zhan Yan suddenly swung the hammer and smashed it onto the basalt platform. The instant the hammer head struck the ground, a copper spring over three inches long shot out from the end of the handle.

Seven-tenths of the impact force was rebounded into the air by the copper spring. The cast iron floor within a hundred-foot radius was torn up as if by an invisible giant hand. Fu Jin hurriedly pulled Xu Yunfan back three steps, but they were still pelted by flying stone fragments.

"Relying on the purple copper mechanism at the end, it possesses a hint of a divine weapon's form even without reaching the divine weapon grade. It is truly an eye-opener."

Xu Yunfan suddenly noticed the eight-sided copper pillars standing by the pool, each face covered in tiny regular script. "This is..."

"The complete text of the *Essentials of Heavy forging*. Fu Jin said you wanted to learn forging. Once you win the Disciple Inheritance Ceremony, you can come down to the Thunderfire Pool to learn forging from me."

"Here?"

Xu Yunfan glanced down at the Thunderfire Pool. This forging platform had been here for a long time, with temperatures reaching several hundred degrees around it. If one stayed for too long, they would be baked dry.

"Are you backing down already?"

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't let others look down on him. "What are you saying, Master? As soon as the Disciple Inheritance Ceremony is over, I will come down."

"Good."

Zhan Yan laughed heartily as he plunged the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer into a cold water pool that had been prepared for a long time. The scalding heavy hammer hissed, sending steam everywhere. The rising mist quickly shrouded the forging platform, only to be evaporated by the intense heat from the surrounding Thunderfire Pool in the blink of an eye.

Beside him, Fu Jin wiped the iron ash off the copper pillar with his sleeve, his face full of emotion.

"From ore selection to quenching, there are a total of 721 processes. The Master has been forging here for twelve years to fully master the forging method of Thunder纹 Steel."

He pointed to the fine iron turntable rotating at the bottom of the pool. "See those silvery-white molten iron? That is refined iron obtained through continuous screening for thirty days and nights by twelve water wheels driving magnetic separation wheels. It is excellent material for forging sharp blades. Unfortunately, there are only five or six smiths in the current Forging Hall who can forge blade-grade weapons. Producing two or three blades a year is already a rare achievement."

"It's done."

At that moment, Zhan Yan pulled the hammer out and tossed it to Xu Yunfan. "Try the feel!"

The moment Xu Yunfan caught the hammer, his knees buckled, and the green bricks under his feet instantly cracked like a spider's web.

But as he swung the warhammer, the seven meteoric iron beads inside the handle slid along a path that perfectly matched the force application route of the Cloak Hammer Technique.

The wind pressure generated by the hammer head cutting through the air sliced the torches three zhang away in half!

"A common treasure artifact needs three days of tempering to be sharpened," Fu Jin said with envy. "But your Thunderfire Qilin Hammer carries its own killing intent. The howl when you swung it just now is something I've only seen once in my life."

Xu Yunfan was about to speak when the ground suddenly trembled violently.

Several fire dragons suddenly shot up from the center of the Thunderfire Pool. Zhan Yan's expression changed drastically. "The dragon's breath of the earth's veins is about to erupt! Retreat quickly!"

Before he finished speaking, the twelve strong men had already pulled the brass gates on the wall. Thirty bucket-thick cast iron chains fell with a thunderous crash, driving a heavy steel lid to press down and seal the boiling Thunderfire Pool tightly.

Amidst the roaring sound, everyone quickly retreated. Xu Yunfan gripped the still-vibrating hammer handle.

On the dark, lustrous surface of the hammer, the star-like spots flickered with the residual heat, as if a river of stars falling from the night sky had been imprisoned within this small space.

Once they had exited the Thunderfire Pool cave, Xu Yunfan looked at Zhan Yan, whose face was filled with exhaustion and whose eyes were bloodshot. He must have stayed up for十几二十个通宵 (a dozen or twenty all-nighters).

He knelt on the ground, his feelings sincere.

"Thank you, Master!"

Looking at Xu Yunfan, the crafty old man Zhan Yan could hear the genuine emotion in his words. He couldn't help but reveal a smile, feeling the exhaustion of the past few days instantly vanish.

He helped Xu Yunfan up and patted his shoulder. After a moment of thought, he said, "Your senior brother and I are getting old. In the future, the burden of the Forging Hall will be on your shoulders."

Xu Yunfan said solemnly, "I will not disappoint your expectations!"

Mo Han, watching from the side, felt a bit of sourness in his heart. Although the Mechanism Hall was large, with thousands of inner and outer disciples, how many were there who could shoulder the responsibility now? He waved his sleeve.

"I'm done playing. I'm leaving."

Zhan Yan went to rest. He had only slept a few times in the past two months and now needed ample rest.

"Junior brother, can I borrow it to play with?"

Fu Jin was full of excitement, rubbing his hands together.

Xu Yunfan smiled and handed the heavy hammer over. The moment Fu Jin took it, he shuddered violently as if electrocuted and pulled his hand back. When he opened his hand, a bloody gash had been split open on the base of his thumb by the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer.
