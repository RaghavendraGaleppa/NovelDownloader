# Chapter 69: Great Completion of the Saint Body

Inside the Refining Method Secret Realm.

Lu Yang's main body was safe and sound, seated peacefully in his cave abode. As for Ji Xiongying's dying curses, he didn't put them to heart in the slightest; at this moment, his heart was only filled with joy.

"The Saint's Plunder is complete!"

Lu Yang stood up, looking up at the sky. All he saw was a long river of purple qi, which was the qi destiny gathered from the one hundred forty million living beings within the entire secret realm!

The qi destiny of Martial Dao!

At this moment, Lu Yang was bathed in this qi destiny, as resplendent purple qi poured over him, making him feel as if he had instantly become the center of heaven and earth.

Meanwhile, all one hundred forty million living beings within the Refining Method Secret Realm, from mortals below to Heaven-Humans above, felt a sudden sensation. One by one, they looked up at the sky, vaguely seeming to see a magnificent golden body rising from the earth, solemn and majestic, as the vast mortal dust lifted him slowly upwards...

"Laws bestowed, Saint Body in Great Completion!"

Lu Yang opened his eyes, once again feeling the Dao profoundness that he had only experienced on great divine ability users and Foundation Establishment Perfected Immortals in the past, a feeling akin to 'ascension'.

His 'hierarchical standing' was rising!

The endless qi destiny was completely swallowed by Lu Yang, not a single trace left behind. These qi destinies slowly constructed an extremely complex ritual within his body.

"...Hmm?"

Just then, Lu Yang suddenly raised his head and looked at the sky.

At the same time, in Tianjing City, as Lu Yang shattered the void and Ji Xiongying followed closely behind, an expression of shock and fury suddenly appeared on Old Ancestor Yun's face.

"Not good!"

Only at this moment did he understand Lu Yang's scheme. Lu Yang had faked the 'Shattering the Void' realm above the Heaven-Human stage. With Lu Yang himself as proof, and now with the addition of Ji Xiongying, from now on, everyone in the world would firmly believe this path was feasible and would pursue it one after another!

The entire system was seamlessly integrated!

Even the fourth step of Martial Dao that he had pioneered was perfectly encompassed by it. The result was not only that it didn't harm Lu Yang's cultivation, but it also boosted its power!

Because if it had only relied on Lu Yang, Martial Dao would at most reach the late Qi Refinement stage.

But with the help of Old Ancestor Yun, the limit of Martial Dao had astonishingly reached the Qi Refinement Great Completion, thus the qi destiny feedback from the Saint's Plunder would also be immense!

Yet, as things stood, even he could no longer break this Martial Dao system.

Because theoretically, a Martial Dao Heaven-Human comparable to Qi Refinement Great Completion was a dead end. This was true not only for Lu Yang but for him as well!

And he couldn't find any flaw in this 'Shattering the Void' realm.

After all, after shattering the void, the person is gone. For something with no witness after death, it's always 'he said, she said'. How could he find a flaw?

To break the situation, unless he could create a method different from shattering the void, one that could truly allow Martial Dao to break through to Foundation Establishment.

But his own cultivation before reincarnation was only early Foundation Establishment. With limited ability, what could he use to create a method that would allow Martial Dao to break through Foundation Establishment?

Perhaps a Golden Core True Monarch could!

Otherwise, it would be to kill everyone who saw Lu Yang shatter the void – but what would be the point of that? It would only expose his existence for nothing.

In other words, the momentum of Lu Yang's completion of 'Saint's Plunder' was already unstoppable!

"Bastard! Bastard!"

Thinking of this, Old Ancestor Yun was so furious his teeth were nearly ground to dust. He never imagined that his scheme would turn out to be fruitless, even becoming a boon for the enemy!

To painstakingly push the karma, only to make a wedding dress for someone else?

He couldn't accept it!

Thinking of this, Old Ancestor Yun gnashed his teeth, filled with utter unwillingness. He then surprisingly pushed the karma once more, wanting to make a final attempt.

Old Ancestor Yun activated the 'Heaven-Scrutiny Instrument' to enhance his influence over karma: "The Saint's Plunder has a destined tribulation, and this tribulation was originally meant for me. But as long as I strip it away and perform a tribulation-substitution technique, replacing a human tribulation with a heavenly tribulation, I can summon the power of heaven and earth to kill him!"

"Stealing the qi destiny of all under heaven is an act against the heavens; he is sure to be struck down by divine punishment!"

Old Ancestor Yun roared, and in an instant, above Lu Yang's secluded cultivation spot, the formerly clear sky suddenly became overcast with dark clouds, and streaks of lightning snakes darted through them.

Boom!

Thunder erupted from the mountains, and heaven and earth turned white!

A huge bolt of lightning struck directly from the dark clouds, moving so fast that one had no time to react. In a blink of an eye, it landed on Lu Yang.

Only when the lightning dispersed did Lu Yang's figure slowly reappear.

However, what Old Ancestor Yun found unbelievable was that Lu Yang was completely unharmed, even when faced with this heavenly lightning bolt that could potentially kill a Qi Refinement Great Completion cultivator!

"This is... the Laws of the Saint's Plunder?"

Information about 'The Saint's Plunder' suddenly flashed through Old Ancestor Yun's mind. The Minor Completion and Great Completion of this body-refining method were completely different things.

Minor Completion of the Saint's Plunder was merely a physical enhancement.

But Great Completion of the Saint's Plunder could condense 'Laws'.

In Immortal Dao cultivation, 'height,' or rather, 'hierarchical standing,' often symbolized an absolute disparity. As long as one's hierarchical standing was high enough, those of lower standing were like ants.

Just like a Foundation Establishment Perfected Immortal compared to a Qi Refinement cultivator.

And the 'Laws' of the Saint's Plunder were, in essence, a form of 'hierarchical standing'.

Therefore, the current Lu Yang was no longer on the same hierarchical standing as ordinary cultivators. Any attack from someone of 'lower' standing couldn't even harm him!

For example, the rolling heavenly thunder conjured by Old Ancestor Yun through karma, although powerful, lacked a corresponding hierarchical standing. The result was naturally like a two-dimensional attack against a three-dimensional being; no matter how great its power, it was all talk and no action, completely meaningless. Let alone harming Lu Yang, it couldn't even graze his clothes.

Of course, Laws also had strengths and weaknesses; not everyone was like this.

The Primordial Saint Sect had countless talented individuals, and Lu Yang wasn't the only disciple to have cultivated the Saint's Plunder. However, the Laws he condensed were the strongest to date!

Because the strength of the 'Laws' was determined by the cultivation system established through practicing the Saint's Plunder.

If the system stopped at the mid Qi Refinement stage, then the 'Laws' could only ignore mid Qi Refinement attacks; it would still be broken through if it encountered late Qi Refinement.

However, with Old Ancestor Yun's 'help,' Lu Yang's Martial Dao encompassed Qi Refinement Great Completion!

Therefore, his 'Laws' were unbreakable by any cultivator below Foundation Establishment, unless they possessed a great divine ability that could similarly elevate their hierarchical standing!

Rumble!

Bolt after bolt of lightning struck down, yet Lu Yang ignored them, completely unmoved. Even the surrounding grand formation was shattered, but he remained utterly unharmed.

Witnessing this scene, Old Ancestor Yun's eyes were splitting with rage, yet he was helpless.

"As things stand, I can only let him go." Old Ancestor Yun sighed, "So be it, let him leave. The Sect Master's mission is more important..."

"Senior, you're watching me, aren't you?"

A faint voice drifted over, and Old Ancestor Yun suddenly froze. He saw that, from the perspective of karma, Lu Yang had suddenly turned his head and was looking at him with calm eyes.

He can see me... No, he knows I exist!?

Old Ancestor Yun subconsciously took a step back, horror in his heart. He instantly severed his karmic sense, then restrained his aura and held his breath, concealing all heavenly secrets about himself.

However, the current Lu Yang was vastly different!

"Trying to escape..."

Lu Yang lowered his gaze, ripples appearing in his eyes. At this moment, his Saint Body was in Great Completion. Although he had not yet reached Foundation Establishment, Old Ancestor Yun was also no longer in Foundation Establishment.

At this moment, there wasn't much disparity in their hierarchical standing!

The next second, Lu Yang's soul escaped his body, soaring directly into the firmament. From above, he overlooked the entire Refining Method Secret Realm, the vast earth momentarily brought into full view.

Old Ancestor Yun had the 'Heaven-Scrutiny Instrument' protecting him, making his concealment of heavenly secrets infallible, which was why Lu Yang couldn't calculate his position. However, he had cultivated the Saint's Plunder here; this place was his home ground. He didn't need to calculate at all; he just needed to see which qi aura had not been plundered by him!

Whoosh—!

With a thought from Lu Yang, countless qi auras reflected in his Sea of Consciousness, but were then rapidly filtered out, leaving only a seemingly weak qi aura located within Tianjing City.

Immediately after, the void opened.

Old Ancestor Yun, who thought he had already concealed his heavenly secrets, looked up in astonishment, only to see a ripple spread above him, and then a figure in black robes leisurely stepping out from it.

"...Found you."
