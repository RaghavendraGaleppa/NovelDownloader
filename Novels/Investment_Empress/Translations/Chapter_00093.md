Chapter 93: Do You Call This a Terrifying Killing Machine?

Zuoqiu Yang looked dazed as he gazed at the Huai Mountain's three evil men lying on the ground, their muscles torn and bones broken.

He had been plotting against these three individuals for a long time, carefully preparing for this moment. Initially, he had intentionally exposed his whereabouts, luring them into a chase. Just moments ago, he had turned the tables, using their own tactics against them, and eliminated the ambushers one by one. The momentum of his Wusheng Blade Technique had reached its peak, leaving him with no room for retreat.

Today, he was incredibly strong, having mustered all his energy to fight for his master and the villagers.

However, just as he was about to deliver the final blow, a young man suddenly appeared and nearly killed the three evil men.

The young man, Li Mo, was much younger than Zuoqiu Yang.

"What are you people doing?" Li Mo crouched beside the Huai Mountain's three evil men, who were coughing up blood, and asked, "Why did you suddenly attack me, and why were you laughing so strangely?"

As a representative of the Qingyuan Sect, Li Mo had come down the mountain to maintain order in the Ziyang Prefecture City. He needed to know the reason behind the brutal attack.

The scar-faced brute on the ground glared at Li Mo with a fierce gaze. Suddenly, an unexpected turn of events occurred. The two accomplices, one fat and one thin, quickly placed their hands on the scar-faced brute's shoulders, gathering their remaining internal energy.

With a loud shout, the scar-faced brute shattered the floor tiles and suddenly sprang up, combining the three men's internal energy into a single, powerful force.

"This kid is still too young!" he sneered, his face twisted with malevolence.

The combined internal energy was not strong in terms of sheer power, but it was enough to shatter Li Mo's dantian.

Zuoqiu Yang snapped back to reality, while Xiao Qin's face turned pale with alarm. He wanted to rush to Li Mo's aid, but it was too late. The scar-faced brute's palm struck Li Mo's dantian, unleashing a torrent of internal energy that threatened to cripple the young man's martial arts abilities.

The impact was loud, but the sound was followed by an eerie silence.

Li Mo didn't even budge, his brow furrowed in discomfort.

The Huai Mountain's three evil men froze, their sinister grins replaced by looks of terror.

"What the...? Is he human or a ghost?"

The three men didn't die peacefully.

Li Mo didn't feel anything unusual as the foreign internal energy entered his body. He simply thought it was messy and roughly combined. Without hesitation, he used his own internal energy to expel the invading force, sending it back through the original path.

However, as the internal energy was expelled, it strangely "ignited," burning with a destructive, scorching ferocity.

The three men suddenly inflated, their eyes bulging, and blood gushing from their seven orifices. They died with their eyes wide open, unblinking.

Li Mo's dantian was incredibly vast, even to himself. Moreover, his internal energy was cultivated through a superior martial art. He had never used it to its full potential before.

"This is my first time using it in combat," Li Mo thought to himself, feeling quite impressed.

Others were even more astonished.

Xiao Qin's mouth hung open, and he stood there, frozen, for a long time. Even the Thousand-Form Martial尊, Qian Xing Wu Zun, was shocked beyond words.

"Li Shidi, are you alright?" Qian Xing Wu Zun asked, hurrying over to examine Li Mo.

Although Li Mo looked normal, the internal energy of three Internal Energy Jade Liquid Realm experts had just flooded into his body. Even without amplification through martial arts, it was an unbearable assault.

Li Mo shook his head and asked, "Were they... participants in the Wu Jian Trial selected by the Xi Yu Lou?"

"They were here to kill someone," Xiao Qin replied, glancing at Zuoqiu Yang.

Following his gaze, Li Mo looked at the figure in the straw raincoat.

Just then, the System prompted: "Congratulations, Host, for helping 'Zuoqiu Yang' eliminate his enemies. You have a reward to claim."

Li Mo's eyes sparkled with interest as he reviewed Zuoqiu Yang's information.

"Name: Zuoqiu Yang
Age: 19
Physique: Nine-fold compatibility
Realm: Internal Energy Condensed Qi
Fate: Purple with gray undertones
Evaluation: This person is born with nine types of physiques suitable for martial arts, making him extremely talented. He was taken in by a rogue assassin from the Xi Yu Lou and is the sole survivor of the Huai Mountain County. He will become a terrifying killing machine in the future."

"Recent experience: Accomplices killed, true culprit hard to find, currently in the Wu Jian Trial, hoping to find clues."

"Purple with gray undertones..." Li Mo murmured. This fate indicated that Zuoqiu Yang would achieve great things but at a terrible cost.

"A terrifying killing machine?" Li Mo raised an eyebrow. "That sounds quite impressive..."

"Did you also participate in the Wu Jian Trial?" Zuoqiu Yang asked, his hand on the hilt of his short sword.

"Why do you ask?" Li Mo replied.

"If you did, I'm out," Zuoqiu Yang said.

Li Mo was taken aback by Zuoqiu Yang's straightforward words.

"The Wu Jian Trial isn't that easy to quit," Li Mo said.

"It's not that I'm unwilling to continue, but I don't want to compete with you," Zuoqiu Yang explained.

Only the last few survivors would be absorbed into the Xi Yu Lou. Thus, all participants, whether active or passive, were hunters... or prey, in a dark forest.

If Li Mo was a participant...

Then, without a doubt, he was the winner of this session.

"I'm not interested in the Xi Yu Lou," Li Mo said with a smile, producing a waist token. "I'm a disciple of the Qingyuan Sect."

Xiao Qin followed suit, displaying his own waist token to show that he was on the same side.

At that moment, a new figure entered the scene.

Shang Wu crossed the threshold of the inn, surveying the carnage without batting an eyelid. She wrinkled her brow, focusing on the stranger.

Zuoqiu Yang swallowed hard, his eyes fixed on Li Mo. His sword trembled, not due to the boiling Sha Qi, but out of fear.

As a practitioner of the Wusheng Blade Technique, he was sensitive to killing intent and Sha Qi. He had seen the most terrifying Sha Qi on his master's body, but now...

The atmosphere in the inn became somewhat awkward, with a small killer who wasn't yet a formal member of the Xi Yu Lou facing four righteous partners from the Qingyuan Sect.

Objectively speaking, Zuoqiu Yang knew he couldn't defeat any of them, not even Xiao Qin, who had the Thousand-Form Martial尊 backing him.

"Don't be so tense," Li Mo said, reassuring Zuoqiu Yang. "We're here to maintain order in the prefecture city and prevent innocent bystanders from getting hurt. As for the Wu Jian Trial, our only hope is for it to end as soon as possible."

Zuoqiu Yang relaxed, picking up the bowl of noodles he had left unfinished and began to eat.

Li Mo walked over to the Huai Mountain's three evil men and used his Chi Xiao sword to search their pockets. Besides some miscellaneous items, a letter in the scar-faced brute's pocket caught his attention.
