# Chapter 118: Breaking the Restriction

As Elder Gui's gaze swept over, a powerful pressure immediately fell upon Chu Ning.

Chu Ning's heart instantly trembled with fear. The pressure from a Golden Core realm cultivator was vastly different from that of a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator. At this moment, Chu Ning felt as if a great mountain was pressing down on him, making him breathless. Inside his Niwan Palace, even his spiritual consciousness liquid began to tremble slightly. Then, in an instant, nearly 10 drops of his hundreds of drops of spiritual consciousness liquid vanished directly. Not daring to hesitate further, Chu Ning quickly spoke:

"Reporting, Elder, this disciple has been at Qi Refining Layer 5 for some time, and in the past two days, I've even subtly felt the intention to break through. I believe I can break through soon without needing to take this Breaking Realm Pill."

Hearing Chu Ning's words, Elder Gui stared at him again, seemingly sensing the fluctuation of Chu Ning's spiritual power. Then he calmly said: "Half a day. If you can't break through by then, take this Breaking Realm Pill. The sect's mission is urgent and cannot wait."

"Yes!" Chu Ning lowered his head and assented.

At this moment, his heart was a mixture of emotions. Before this, Chu Ning undoubtedly still had a sense of belonging to the Qingxi Sect. After all, he had learned the art of cultivation from the sect. The several deacons he had interacted with had different personalities, but they all showed him some care. Even when he previously detected the infiltration of the Yin Demon Sect, he had been worried about reporting it casually and alerting the infiltrators, so he hadn't informed them immediately, but he had always kept it in mind. And on the day he met Duan Yuewu, after learning that the sect was already aware of the Yin Demon Sect's infiltration, he had breathed a huge sigh of relief.

But at this moment, his sense of belonging was rapidly weakening. Chu Ning realized that he was just a Qi Refining disciple, and at this moment, to the entire sect, he was merely a tool to complete a mission. Even though he had reached Qi Refining Layer 5 in such a short time, he was still being forced to take the Breaking Realm Pill. Chu Ning sighed bitterly in his heart, his gaze unintentionally shifting to the others. Even with his cultivation, he could see that several fellow disciples had strong Qi Refining Layer 5 spiritual power fluctuations. Moreover, they were all young. Not to mention Qi Refining Layer 6, it was highly probable they could break through even further. But now, under the gaze of this Golden Core Elder, they all took the pills one by one. As for the other party's lie that this was a secret pill that would only affect cultivation progress for one year, Chu Ning naturally didn't believe a word of it. As these thoughts turned in his mind, a sense of coldness also grew.

However, Chu Ning showed no expression on his face. After getting up, he also walked to a relatively open and unpopulated area and began to sit cross-legged to cultivate. The training ground was large enough that even over a hundred people cultivating would not affect each other. Of course, he naturally didn't take the Breaking Realm Pill. Instead, he put it into a jade bottle and then placed it in his storage pouch.

For Chu Ning, "breaking through" to Qi Refining Layer 6 was clearly an effortless matter. But to cover his tracks, he took out another Yuan Gathering Pill and swallowed it, then began cultivating the Evergreen Wood Longevity Art. As Chu Ning did these things, Elder Gui's spiritual consciousness subtly swept over him. However, he didn't say anything more.

Everyone was cultivating. In the blink of an eye, several hours passed. Along the way, some disciples who were originally stuck at Qi Refining Layer 5 successively broke through to Qi Refining Layer 6 with the help of the Breaking Realm Pill. As for Chu Ning, who was cultivating, he also felt Elder Gui's spiritual consciousness sweep over him a few times, but it didn't linger for long.

After about half a day had passed, Chu Ning felt that the time was right. He slightly released a bit of the concealment aura of his Wood Spirit Physique. Instantly, his entire being appeared to be at Qi Refining Layer 6. Moreover, it was precisely the unstable appearance of someone who had just broken through. The next moment, Chu Ning stood up with a face full of joy. Elder Gui, who was sitting cross-legged at the very front of the training ground, also looked over immediately. After his gaze lingered on Chu Ning for a moment, it shifted away. Seeing this scene, Chu Ning secretly breathed a sigh of relief while once again marveling at the Wood Spirit Physique's ability to conceal aura. Being able to display auras of different levels at will, even a Golden Core realm expert couldn't see through it.

At this moment, many people in the training ground were still cultivating. Seeing this, Chu Ning sat down cross-legged again and began cultivating the Evergreen Wood Longevity Art, appearing to consolidate his realm. In fact, most of the others were doing the same.

Another half a day passed.

"Alright, everyone has broken through to Qi Refining Layer 6. Let's go."

Elder Gui's words echoed in everyone's ears. Chu Ning immediately ended his cultivation and walked with the others. At this moment, Elder Gui released a magic treasure in the shape of an alchemy cauldron. The next moment, this magic treasure suddenly grew, becoming as large as a courtyard. Chu Ning and the others all boarded this magic treasure. Immediately, the alchemy cauldron flashed through the air and disappeared. Sitting inside the alchemy cauldron, Chu Ning now had a clearer sensation.

This magic artifact should not be teleportation, but rather an illusion caused by its extreme speed. With such incredible speed, the cauldron artifact could travel a great distance even in just a few breaths. To Chu Ning's surprise, it had flown for a full hour without showing any signs of stopping. "That hidden mission location is clearly near the sect, so why are they taking us so far? Is it to throw people off?" Chu Ning felt a little confused. He wanted to try and look outside, but there was a light barrier outside the artifact that blocked everyone's view.

Like this, after another hour or so, Elder Gui finally landed with the magic artifact. Chu Ning immediately discovered that he and the others were in a mountain forest. All around them were tall trees, and only the spot where they stood was a flat clearing. Outside the forest, four people were already standing. Besides the dark-faced old man from before, there were two men and one woman. Judging from the aura and pressure emanating from them, which were of the same level as the dark-faced old man, they were naturally all Golden Core experts.

"There are five Golden Core cultivators here, plus the Sect Master, making six known individuals currently. This is different from what Zhuang Yunde told me before, which was only four people." Chu Ning thought to himself, then also considered that Senior Brother Zhuang had entered more than a year before him. At this moment, he didn't know if he was alive or dead.

Just as Chu Ning was pondering, he suddenly felt a spiritual consciousness envelop him. Subconsciously, Chu Ning almost activated his spiritual consciousness to resist. But Chu Ning quickly suppressed this thought, not daring to act rashly. The next moment, a female voice, which somewhat startled Chu Ning, rang out.

"You are all our Yin Demon Sect's most trusted disciples. Now, take out your tokens."

Listening to this voice, Chu Ning vaguely felt something was wrong, but his spiritual consciousness was somewhat hazy, almost instinctively reaching for his storage pouch. However, he didn't make any actual movement. In his storage pouch, there indeed was originally a bamboo token of the Yin Demon Sect that he had obtained from Qi Chongmao. But, after entering the forbidden area with Ling Xiaobai last time, it had been destroyed on the spot. So at this moment, even if he wanted to take it out, he couldn't. "Wait, how could they be from the Yin Demon Sect?" Chu Ning's heart suddenly became vigilant, and he instantly recovered from his hazy state to full awareness. Then, to his astonishment, he saw four people holding bamboo-like objects in their hands, staring blankly ahead.

The next moment, the silver-haired old woman who had spoken earlier let out a soft snort, and all four individuals slumped to the ground.

"Elder Mu's spiritual consciousness secret art is becoming increasingly refined." A fat old man next to her said with a smile. The silver-haired old woman, Elder Mu, showed no trace of pride on her face, merely stating calmly: "They are just a bunch of Qi Refining disciples, incapable of even sensing spiritual consciousness. If I couldn't deal with them, wouldn't it be a joke? The Yin Demon Sect is truly persistent. Every time, some infiltrators are caught, and their methods are endless."

As the silver-haired old woman spoke, the rest of the crowd also gradually regained their senses, their faces showing some confusion. However, upon seeing four people collapsed on the ground, their expressions subtly changed.

"You don't need to worry," Elder Mu spoke again at this moment. "These people are disciples of the demonic Yin Demon Sect, planted within our sect. Eliminating them is for your future safety." Hearing Elder Mu's words, the expressions on everyone's faces immediately relaxed considerably. Chu Ning's face also secretly relaxed at this moment. He felt slightly fortunate in his heart that he had accidentally broken into this forbidden area last time and destroyed that bamboo token. Otherwise, under the influence of this Golden Core cultivator's spiritual consciousness secret art today, he might genuinely have taken it out of his storage pouch. If that were the case, he might not even get a chance to explain himself and would be directly annihilated like those four.

But at the same time, Chu Ning also felt a bit suspicious. Could the people of the Yin Demon Sect be so easy to eliminate? It seemed the Qingxi Sect had tried to eliminate them before, but there always seemed to be some who slipped through. At this point, Chu Ning secretly sighed in pity. He wasn't in the previous batch who entered; otherwise, he would know if Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang were exposed. After all, in Chu Ning's opinion, those two were very likely from the Yin Demon Sect.

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, the silver-haired old woman, Elder Mu, spoke again: "Alright, next I'll tell you about this mission." Elder Mu's voice rang out. Everyone, including Chu Ning, pricked up their ears.

"Later, I and the other elders will open the restriction behind us, allowing you to enter the Spirit Domain. Before that, your senior brothers and sisters have already set up the Five Elements Heaven and Earth Array inside. Your mission is to reach the array formation area and collectively activate the array."

"It is this mission after all." Chu Ning thought to himself, hearing Elder Mu's words. "However, that place isn't directly called a forbidden area as I thought, but rather a Spirit Domain? Could this name be related to the so-called spirit seeds?"

As Chu Ning pondered this, Elder Mu's words continued. "If you don't want to lose your lives in there, listen carefully to what I say next." Hearing this, everyone's hearts tightened, and all their expressions became serious.

"This Spirit Domain also contains various dangers, the greatest of which comes from demonic beasts. Because only Qi Refining disciples can enter this Spirit Domain, the demonic beasts inside are all Tier 1 demonic beasts, mostly Tier 1 low-grade and mid-grade. But even so, Tier 1 high-grade demonic beasts are not few. After you enter, you will be teleported to different locations. The best method is to find your companions as quickly as possible, and then avoid places where demonic beasts might exist."

As soon as Elder Mu said this, many people's faces turned pale. This batch of entrants were all Qi Refining Layer 6 disciples. Encountering mid-grade Tier 1 demonic beasts was fine, but if they encountered high-grade Tier 1 demonic beasts, they would have no strength to resist at all. Elder Mu, however, paid no attention to their expressions.

"Of course, the spiritual energy here is rich, and there are also many natural spiritual herbs. If you have the strength, any demonic beasts you hunt or spiritual herbs/fruits you collect will all be yours. Furthermore, if you can reach the array formation area, there will be a great opportunity. You will know more about this after you enter."

At this moment, everyone looked at each other, their expressions varied. Some were excited and expectant, some were worried and fearful, and many had confused and uneasy expressions on their faces.

"Also, within the Spirit Domain, you cannot use any Five Elements escape arts or ordinary Wind Manipulation Art for flight. You can only walk. Some special magic artifacts that can accelerate movement, as long as they are not flying types, can be used. So regarding magic artifacts, the sect also has some preparations, it's up to each of you." Elder Mu continued speaking, her gaze turning to the dark-faced Elder Zhu.

At this moment, the dark-faced Elder Zhu waved his hand casually, and ten shelves appeared out of thin air around them, piled with magic artifacts. "The Sect Master already said at the training ground that all disciples participating in the mission would be granted one mid-grade magic artifact. Elder Mu just mentioned that because escape arts cannot be used in the Spirit Domain, while preparing offensive and defensive magic artifacts, the sect also prepared some other auxiliary magic artifacts. Considering that your strength is somewhat lower than the previous batch of disciples, the magic artifacts given to you are of a higher grade and power than those given to the previous disciples. However, each person can only choose one magic artifact. All of you, come and select."

As soon as the dark-faced Elder Zhu's words fell, the disciples instantly became agitated.

"Mid-grade magic artifacts!"

"It's really true, so many mid-grade magic artifacts!"

Clearly, seeing so many mid-grade magic artifacts displayed at once gave the disciples present no small visual shock. After all, for many present, let alone mid-grade magic artifacts, they might not even possess low-grade ones. Chu Ning was naturally not among the agitated crowd. He already had several high-grade magic artifacts in his possession, so truthfully, he didn't care much for these mid-grade ones.

"You have two quarters of an hour to choose." At this moment, the dark-faced Elder Zhu's words rang out again, and everyone immediately swarmed forward. Because the shelves were labeled with different categories, such as offensive artifacts, defensive artifacts, other artifacts... Everyone purposefully rushed towards different shelves, and among them, the shelves labeled offensive artifacts had the most people. Even though the two Golden Core cultivators had mentioned that flying was impossible in the Spirit Domain and that there were auxiliary artifacts, but because the cultivation realm of this batch of disciples was generally too low, and almost no one previously owned mid-grade magic artifacts, the vast majority still chose to select offensive and defensive artifacts. Only a sparse three people walked towards the shelf solely labeled "Other Artifacts." Chu Ning was naturally one of them.

He had both offensive and defensive high-grade magic artifacts in his possession, so naturally, he didn't look highly upon these mid-grade ones. Having entered once before, Chu Ning had a deep appreciation for the inability to fly. Even using Wind Manipulation Art, one could only skim the ground, which was much slower. Although Chu Ning could use Shocking Thunder Steps, since the sect was aware of this situation, Chu Ning naturally wanted to see what corresponding magic artifacts they had prepared.

When Chu Ning arrived at the shelf, he quickly got a general idea. There were actually only three types of items here, with several pieces of each. The first type was a pair of boots, called Flowing Light Boots, with five pairs on the shelf. They could be used in conjunction with Wind Manipulation Art. Under normal circumstances, they could increase Wind Manipulation speed by 40 to 50 percent. When used within the Spirit Domain, by injecting spiritual power and using Wind Manipulation Art while skimming the ground, they could basically achieve the speed of ordinary Wind Manipulation Art. However, the description also mentioned that these boots were extremely power-consuming. If used with Wind Manipulation Art, they would require approximately three times the spiritual power consumption. After reading, Chu Ning hesitated for a moment, then shook his head. "There are naturally still dangers in the Spirit Domain. Excessive spiritual power consumption won't do."

Moreover, he had Shocking Thunder Steps, so his speed was actually not slow, and he could use it without consuming spiritual power. His gaze turned to the second type. With just one glance, Chu Ning discovered that this bead was actually the same as the one he had obtained when he killed Duan Yuewu. Looking at the description again, this bead was called the Azure Light Bead. It could glow in the dark and also had certain water-repelling and poison-warding effects. Holding this bead and injecting spiritual power could form a protective barrier. Entering water would repel it, and even weak poisonous gas could be isolated. Previously, he only thought it was a night-glowing bead, but he hadn't expected it to also have water-repelling and poison-warding effects. He already had one, so naturally, he wouldn't choose it again now. But seeing that only two of these beads remained, quite a few people from the previous batch must have chosen them.

Chu Ning then looked at the third type. This item was actually a puppet bird. He carefully read the description. This item was mainly used for scouting. Because it didn't need to carry people, this puppet bird could actually fly within the Spirit Domain after spiritual power was injected or spirit stones were used. To control this item, it needed to be paired with a magic mirror. The puppet bird could fly about a hundred zhang away from the mirror, and the scenery within the puppet bird's line of sight could be displayed in the magic mirror. The usage description of this item even mentioned spiritual consciousness. The general meaning was that although Qi Refining disciples couldn't use spiritual consciousness, constantly controlling this item was extremely taxing on it. Therefore, it could only be used for short periods, otherwise, one would easily become fatigued. Moreover, because Qi Refining disciples didn't understand spiritual consciousness recovery techniques, it would take a long time to recover after use.

"This thing seems to have some use." After reading, Chu Ning's eyes flickered slightly. He now somewhat suspected whether this treasure wasn't brought out for the previous disciples to choose, otherwise, others probably wouldn't have left this item. After all, in an unfamiliar environment, this item was undoubtedly very useful. Of course, another possibility was that Qi Refining disciples generally didn't understand spiritual consciousness, so they would be very hesitant when they saw this description. For example, Chu Ning saw another disciple who came with him, who also seemed to have seen this item at this moment. But the expression on his face was very hesitant. Chu Ning, however, had no hesitation at this moment. He directly reached out and took out the puppet bird and the magic mirror. For him, the spiritual consciousness consumption of Qi Refining cultivators was not a major problem. The cultivator who was a few years older next to him, upon seeing Chu Ning take the puppet bird, shook his head with a smile. Then, this person reached out and took an Azure Light Bead.

Chu Ning and the few others were already quite noticeable because they came to this shelf. At this moment, upon seeing Chu Ning actually take the puppet bird, the dark-faced elder couldn't help but glance at Chu Ning, with a hint of amusement. However, he didn't stop him.

Chu Ning's selection was quick, but the other side took quite some time due to the large crowd. It took almost two quarters of an hour before the rest of the crowd, under the impatient urging of the dark-faced old man, successively finished their selections. A group of Qi Refining Layer 6 cultivators held the magic artifacts in their hands, their faces all showing excitement. At this moment, the dark-faced Elder Zhu waved his hand, collecting all the shelves and remaining magic artifacts. The silver-haired old woman, Elder Mu's words, rang out again.

"Now, each of you will be given a guide needle and a map. After you enter the Spirit Domain, you will be teleported to different locations. Follow the direction pointed by the needle, and you will be able to reach the array formation area."

As soon as Elder Mu finished speaking, the fat elder who had spoken earlier waved his hand casually. Instantly, an egg-sized round disc and a map landed in each person's hand. Chu Ning looked at the disc in his hand and found a red needle-like object on it, which was extremely similar to the compass he had seen in his previous life. However, there was only one needle on it, with no markings or anything similar.

The fat elder's gentle voice now rang out. "Don't look now. This guide will only be effective once you are inside the Spirit Domain. Put them away for now. All of you, familiarize yourselves with the map first." Hearing this, Chu Ning and the others immediately put away their guide needles and began looking at the maps in their hands. The fat elder began to introduce, also telling everyone more details about the Spirit Domain. Everyone was a cultivator; although their realms weren't high, their memory wouldn't be too bad after spiritual power cultivation. The fat elder spent only about a quarter of an hour to give them a general overview. Everyone remembered most of it anyway, and since they could all carry the maps, the Golden Core cultivators didn't give them too much more time.

After the fat elder's voice fell, Elder Mu's voice rang out again. "Remember, this map was drawn based on information provided by some people previously. It is not complete and can only be used as a general reference. Furthermore, some terrain within this Spirit Domain may occasionally change, and demonic beasts are even more likely to move. So after entering the Spirit Domain, you must still rely on the direction guide needle and make sure to reach the array formation area as quickly as possible. One month later, the array formation area will be sealed, and the direction guide needles in your hands will become ineffective. After that, you might never have the chance to leave this Spirit Domain again. At the same time, you must support and look after each other, and only after completing the mission together can you return to the sect as early as possible."

After the fat elder's explanation just now, hearing Elder Mu's words again, the joy on everyone's faces dissipated considerably. At this moment, everyone recalled that the sect didn't give these magic artifacts for free. Giving Breaking Realm Pills and mid-grade magic artifacts to mid-Qi Refining disciples, anyone would know that this mission was not easy. The Golden Core elders, however, paid no attention to the expressions of the crowd.

"Break the restriction!" At this moment, the green-robed elder who had been silent since arriving spoke. Immediately, the five Golden Core cultivators all made their moves.
