# Chapter 261: Possession

He watched as the young man stepped down from the platform, his jade-like body crumbling with every movement. A sudden, sweet taste of ginseng essence surged up his throat—the life-saving trump card that had merged with his marrow blood after consuming the Ginseng Spirit.

*Crackle!*

The spiderweb of cracks on the young man's chest and abdomen had spread to his throat, yet he still pointed his finger, which held a lingering glimmer of starlight, toward his own brow.

The entire White Jade Palace suddenly trembled violently. Jade dust flaking from the coiling dragon pillars condensed in the air to form the seal script of the *Azure Mountain Suppression Art*—the very Body Refining secret technique Xu Yunfan had seen within the Xuanzhen Sect!

Xu Yunfan's mind shook, and he instantly realized that the Xuanzhen Sect's supreme martial arts must have been obtained from this place.

"A truly excellent furnace," the young man squeezed out through his shattered vocal cords, his voice carrying a bronze bell-like tremor. The pure light around him transformed into a bridge, connecting directly to Xu Yunfan's Baihui acupoint.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted violently. His spirit felt as if struck by lightning, shuddering intensely. The moment the bridge of pure light pierced into his Baihui, he felt as if he saw a sea of clouds explode before his eyes. Countless ancient and obscure runes surged down like a torrent, nearly dulling his consciousness.

"This... is this possession?!"

His muscles tensed instantly. The Dragon Scale Armor sensed the crisis, its scales bristling and erupting with dazzling bloodlight.

Xu Yunfan felt as if his head was about to split open. In his dizziness, he actually saw...

A bone altar rising from the depths of his Sea of Consciousness. Nine rust-covered chains pierced through the figure at the center of the altar.

The figure slowly raised its head, revealing a face identical to his own, yet the corners of its mouth curled with the same smile the young man had just worn!

Pure light, like chains, wrapped around Xu Yunfan's limbs, suspending him in mid-air.

Seeing a hint of呆滞 (dullness/stupefaction) in Xu Yunfan's eyes, a trace of a smile appeared on the young man's face.

He stood with his hands behind his back, his eyes reflecting Xu Yunfan's stiff figure, and suddenly let out a soft sigh. His voice seemed to carry the desolation of passing through a thousand years. "What a pity... The world has its own karma; one cannot force it. The spiritual energy of this world is depleted like a desert. The time has not come, and the geographical advantage is not formed. Even with the ability to reach the heavens, it is difficult to go against the flow."

His gaze swept over Xu Yunfan's tense body, passing over the dark patterns of the Dragon Scale Armor, and the corner of his mouth suddenly hooked into a playful smile. "As for 'Human Harmony,' Heaven has actually prepared it for me."

He tapped his finger lightly in the void, as if plucking at Xu Yunfan's physical body.

"With this body of yours that has undergone Blood Transformation and Marrow Washing, supplemented by the *Turtle Breath Calamity Passage Sutra* I have treasured... enduring two or three hundred years of silence... When the spiritual energy tide arrives again, my Dao will see the light of day once more!"

Before the words had faded, the young man's form suddenly disintegrated into a sky full of pure light, rushing toward Xu Yunfan's brow like the Milky Way pouring down!

*Boom!*

Xu Yunfan felt as if struck by lightning and collapsed to the ground instantly.

In the Sea of Consciousness, the young man's spirit essence transformed into a giant a hundred zhang tall. A palm pressed down, intending to crush Xu Yunfan's soul.

However, at this moment, an unexpected change occurred.

*Rip!*

The Extreme Dao Remnant Skin, which had been transformed from the flesh skin shed by the mysterious Extreme Dao powerhouse, suddenly burst forth. The skin rolled and writhed like a living creature, frantically squirming to fit every inch of Xu Yunfan's skin, like a glutton smelling blood.

The young man's spirit essence froze abruptly, realizing with horror that he had fallen into a blood-colored dream.

The setting sun was like blood, dyeing the entire dream world crimson.

The sky hung low, as if it might collapse at any moment and crush this illusory world.

The bone altar stood towering in the center of the blood sea. Nine rust-covered chains pierced through the altar, their ends vanishing into the void, seemingly binding some indescribable existence.

The mysterious woman in white, transformed from the lingering will of the Extreme Dao Remnant, stood atop the altar. Her sleeves fluttered, and a chilling sword intent surrounded her.

Her expression was indifferent, but her eyes were as cold as frosty stars, piercing straight into the spirit essence that the young man had cast into Xu Yunfan's Sea of Consciousness.

The composure on the young man's face vanished instantly, replaced by a gloomy shadow between his brows.

This turn of events had exceeded his expectations. This man, who was no bigger than a grasshopper, actually had another variable within his Sea of Consciousness.

He quickly calmed down. Upon seeing the woman's figure clearly, his pupils shrank slightly, followed by a cold sneer.

"So it's a remnant of the 'Heavenly Sword Pavilion'! Yu Congling, you actually haven't died yet, and you're actually lingering on like this. You've made me underestimate you."

His voice was like the clashing of metal and iron, carrying a hint of sarcasm and wariness.

"No wonder this remnant skin could stop my possession... Back then, the Heavenly Sword Pavilion was famous for its 'Soul Severing Sword Intent,' which specifically countered soul techniques. I didn't expect that someone could actually seal sword intent into skin and refine such a wicked object!"

Speaking of this, the young man suddenly laughed out loud.

"Back when I came to this world, the great cultivators of your Heavenly Sword Pavilion watched you fall with their own eyes. If I bring you back to the sect, they will definitely record a great merit for me! This skin of yours, I want it. After I get out, I'll refine you into my furnace."

As he spoke, a trace of lewdness flashed through the young man's eyes.

"The true传 (direct lineage) of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion... I haven't tasted one in this lifetime."

"The Yuan Demon Sect... is just never giving up on its evil intentions."

Yu Congling's expression did not change in the slightest; she merely raised her hand slowly.

In an instant, the blood sea churned, the bone altar trembled, and countless sword intents condensed from the void, transforming into blood-colored longswords that hung suspended in the sky, their tips pointing directly at the young man!

The young man's face changed drastically. He hadn't expected that Yu Congling, being just a lingering will, could still condense such a terrifying and unparalleled sword intent.

It must be that Xu Yunfan had fed his essence and energy into her day and night through dreams to achieve this result.

Thoughts flashed like lightning. The young man instantly figured out the various connections, his gaze turning vicious as he looked at Xu Yunfan standing in the distance.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. He raised his hand and made a middle finger gesture at him.

Although he didn't know what this gesture meant, the young man naturally understood it was a sign of disrespect. He didn't dwell on it and decided that to deal with Xu Yunfan, he first had to annihilate Yu Congling of the Heavenly Sword Pavilion.

He shouted fiercely, "A mere lingering will, dares to stop me?!"

However, before the words had faded, the rain of blood-colored swords had already poured down!

The moment the rain of blood-colored swords poured down, the young man's body suddenly erupted with surging demonic energy, transforming into nine black chains that wrapped around himself. Each chain bore a ferocious ghost face, emitting piercing shrieks.

"Nine Calamities of the Primordial Origin, open!"

The chains writhed like living things, shattering the incoming blood-colored sword qi. However, several sword lights still pierced through the defense, tearing horrifying wounds into the young man's soul.

He let out a muffled groan, the anger in his eyes turning completely into violence. He formed a seal with his hands, and amidst the surging demonic energy, a phantom of a three-headed, six-armed demon god actually condensed.

"If you insist on protecting this brat, this Lord will devour your lingering will first!"

The phantom of the demon god spread all six arms wide. The palms split open to reveal scarlet vertical pupils, shooting out six soul-eroding demonic lights.

Yu Congling's figure did not move, but the bone altar suddenly rose, erupting nine blood pillars. The bodies of the pillars were covered in dense inscriptions of sword marks.

*Zheng!*

A clear and resonant sword cry echoed through the blood sea. All the inscriptions detached from the blood pillars and interwoven before her to form a sword screen carved with the ancient seal script for "Soul Severing."

The moment the demonic light struck the sword screen, it dissolved and vanished completely, like snow meeting a scorching sun!

The young man's pupils constricted violently. He had never expected that Yu Congling had actually cultivated the "Myriad Calamities Unbreakable" sword stance from the Heavenly Sword Pavilion's foundational art, the *Heavenly Sword Canon*!
