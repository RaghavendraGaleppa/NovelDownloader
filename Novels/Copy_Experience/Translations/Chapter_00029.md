# Chapter 29: Azure Water Surging Array

The Mo family and the Black Robe Society members stood in a standoff, separated by the grand array.

The Black Robe Society was in no hurry to launch an attack, and the Mo family dared not venture out. Neither side knew if a Foundation Establishment cultivator was waiting for them outside. The Black Robe Society appeared very casual, but the more relaxed they seemed, the more panicked the Mo family members became. The other rogue cultivators in the market city also grew increasingly restless.

Hearts began to waver! Everyone realized that if the Mo family’s Foundation Establishment Ancestor failed to return, a bloody storm would soon sweep through the area. When that happened, it would be a feast for the taking, a slaughtering carnival! Not only would the Black Robe Society be involved, but also ambitious rogue cultivators. Who knew how many people were secretly preparing a black robe in private?

After Lu Xu circled the market city, his storage bag also contained a black robe. He didn't have any designs on the Mo family; with his current cultivation, he dared not participate in such a gluttonous feast. He prepared the black robe just in case. If the Black Robe Society broke through the array and started a massacre, this black robe might allow him to blend in.

“Calamity! What a calamity! This old man has cultivated peacefully for over sixty years, but in his old age, he still can’t escape this tribulation!” Old Xu sighed in the courtyard, utterly dejected. In his decades of cultivation, when had he ever encountered such a grand setup? He’d barely had any experience fighting others. To be precise, he’d never had any; his fight with Mo Qingyuan was his first. He used to stay cooped up in the market city, rarely venturing out. Who could have imagined such an upheaval? There was truly no absolutely safe turtle shell in this world!

“The Black Robe Society is probably targeting the Mo family. It has little to do with us. As long as we’re careful, we’ll be fine!” Lu Xu comforted him.

“Alas!” Old Xu’s mood didn’t improve; he remained deeply worried. Of course, he knew the Black Robe Society wouldn’t target minor cultivators like them. What he truly worried about was if the Black Robe Society broke through the grand array, the market city would surely fall into chaos. What would he do amidst the bloodshed?

“I should have rushed into the Myriad Monster Mountain Range sooner!” Old Xu slapped his thigh in frustration.

Lu Xu couldn’t help but chuckle at this, shaking his head. “Not to mention the countless monsters in the Myriad Monster Mountain Range, where the chances of dying are high. Just looking at the Black Robe Society’s current display, I doubt you’d find it easy to hide in the mountains!”

Old Xu looked up at the sky, speechless.

He, too, realized that the Black Robe Society’s ambitions were vast this time. It seemed that ever since the news of the Divine Wood Sect ruins was released, anyone in this market city who tried to go anywhere other than towards the ruins would encounter members of the Black Robe Society. It wasn't just the Mo family trying to seal off news. The Black Robe Society was even more eager to do so, and having planned for so many years, their arrangements would only be more extensive than the Mo family’s.

“We have no choice,” Lu Xu said with a solemn expression. “Our only chance is the chaos that will ensue after the market city is breached. We must seize that moment to escape!”

Old Xu nodded. “At that time, we just need to stay far away from the Mo family’s ancestral land. The farther, the safer!” He paused. “However, I still hope the Mo family ancestor can return safely so that the market city can continue to be stable.”

No sooner had Old Xu’s words fallen than a sharp, piercing shriek suddenly echoed from outside the market city. Both men were startled by the sound. They exchanged a look, then immediately flew onto the rooftop to look outside. Outside the market city, a fiery red streak of light shot across from the Azure Lake, its momentum terrifying.

*It seems someone is fleeing from the Divine Wood Sect ruins,* Lu Xu thought. The red light moved incredibly fast, reaching the market city’s perimeter in a blink of an eye. Within the light, a small, elderly figure with white hair and beard was faintly visible.

The Mo family ancestor! He had actually returned alive!

The Foundation Establishment Ancestor swept his hand, and immediately, a sky full of fire descended. A blazing fire curtain directly enveloped seven or eight black-robed figures gathered outside the market city. Accompanied by a few short screams, those black-robed figures were incinerated, leaving no trace behind.

“Quick! Open the array, welcome the ancestor!” Joyful shouts erupted from the Mo family’s side, but before they could act, the Mo family ancestor himself performed several hand seals. A gap immediately appeared in the second-tier grand array enveloping the market city. The Mo family ancestor flashed inside, and the array instantly became whole again.

Cheers immediately broke out within the market city. The Mo family ancestor had returned with formidable power, effortlessly eradicating several strong members of the Black Robe Society. This was incredibly uplifting! The situation had abruptly reversed; Azure Lake Market City was safe. The low-level cultivators who had been tense and uneasy for so long collectively sighed in relief, smiles returning to their faces.

But almost immediately, their smiles froze, and their cheers died down. From the direction of the Azure Lake, an azure streak of light sped closer, as if pursuing the ancestor. The azure light abruptly halted above the market city. A black-robed figure stared coldly down, exuding a chilling aura.

A Foundation Establishment powerhouse!

A powerful pressure once again enveloped everyone. The entire market city fell silent.

“There’s no need to fear, everyone. With our clan ancestor presiding, no Foundation Establishment cultivator can enter!” a steady voice rang out from the Mo family’s ancestral land. It was the Mo family head!

Hearing this voice, the collective anxiety that had just risen in people’s hearts gradually eased. *Yes, so what if he’s a Foundation Establishment cultivator? He’s not a Golden Core powerhouse! With the Mo family ancestor, that stabilizing force, presiding over the second-tier grand array, it’s truly impenetrable, solid as a rock.*

Azure Lake Market City was stable!

“Ancestor!”

“Ancestor, you’ve finally returned!”

Within the Mo family’s ancestral land, as the small, white-haired old man landed, a group of Mo family cultivators immediately swarmed around him.

“Pfft!”

The Mo family ancestor had barely landed when he violently spat out a large mouthful of blood. In an instant, his face turned ashen, his entire body trembled, and he could no longer stand steadily.

“Ancestor?!”

“Ancestor, what’s wrong?”

The Mo family members were greatly alarmed, their faces filled with terror. The family head quickly stepped forward to support the Foundation Establishment Ancestor, his eyes wide with horror. *Heaven is falling!*

With the family head’s support, the Mo family ancestor sat down. He slapped his storage bag, and a crimson gourd appeared in his hand. Opening the gourd, a rich aroma of wine wafted out. The Mo family ancestor quickly took a mouthful, then closed his eyes and sat cross-legged on the ground, beginning to regulate his breath. Seeing this, the surrounding Mo family experts quickly stood guard for him.

A quarter of an hour later, white steam billowed from the Mo family ancestor’s head, and a hint of color returned to his face.

“Pfft!”

He spat out blood again, this time a large clump of dark, foul-smelling blood. When the blood landed on the ground, it immediately hissed, and faintly, countless tiny, densely packed worms could be seen squirming ceaselessly. The Mo family members turned pale with fright at this sight.

The Mo family ancestor opened his eyes, seeing the distraught expressions on everyone’s faces. He couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. Forcing himself to appear strong, he said in a deep voice, “All elders, follow me to discuss matters!” He then turned back to the family head. “Also, call Qingchan!”

A moment later, in a main hall of the Mo family, six or seven people gathered. The Mo family ancestor looked at them, his expression grim. “I can live for three more days at most!”

“This ancestor has finally returned. Now the market city is stable!” Old Xu stood on the rooftop, his face filled with the relief of having survived a great calamity.

“It’s hard to say, don’t be too quick to rejoice. The Black Robe Society laid out such a deadly trap; it’s unlikely the Mo family ancestor returned unscathed!” Lu Xu shook his head, his expression still grave.

“You mean…?” Old Xu was startled.

“Let’s see what the Black Robe Society does. They know the Mo family ancestor’s condition better than us. If they retreat, it means the Mo family ancestor is indeed fine. But if they continue to surround the market city, then…” Lu Xu didn’t continue, but Old Xu understood his meaning. His face slowly darkened, and his eyes soon filled with renewed worry.

The two remained on the rooftop, observing the situation outside, waiting patiently. It didn’t take long for the truth to be revealed. Three hours later, more and more black-robed figures gathered outside the market city. A careful count revealed a staggering number, nearly two hundred. This was no small figure! One must remember that the lowest cultivation level among the Black Robe Society members was Qi Condensation Layer 5! Bandit cultivators never accepted the weak!

“It looks like they’re going to directly attack the market city!” Old Xu exclaimed in shock, watching the commotion outside.

“Things are escalating so quickly!” Lu Xu also sighed.

Outside the market city, bodies were carried over by the black-robed figures, laid out before the second-tier grand array. There were several hundred of them. Lu Xu even spotted Mo Qingyuan’s body among them, which he hadn’t had time to deal with.

“Little Lu, look over there!” Old Xu’s face showed a complex expression as he pointed in a certain direction. Lu Xu followed his gaze and his eyes instantly narrowed. On the ground lay the body of a young man in black clothes, his face pale, with a faint hint of arrogance from his living days still visible.

Leng Quan!

“I didn’t expect him to meet with misfortune too!” Old Xu sighed to the heavens, unsure what to say. Of the four people in the courtyard originally, He Qing and Leng Quan were both dead. Now, only he and Lu Xu remained. He wondered if the two of them would survive this calamity.

“It seems everyone who went to the Divine Wood Sect ruins has died!” Lu Xu lamented. To think how spirited Leng Quan had been back then, now he was just a cold corpse.

“What are they doing with these corpses? Is it a display of intimidation?” Old Xu’s eyes showed confusion.

“Who knows? Let’s wait and see. A cultivator’s body has many uses!” Lu Xu recalled the Yin Fire Thunder he had once bought. Among these hundreds of corpses, many were late Qi Condensation cultivators—they would undoubtedly be a huge fortune in the hands of demonic cultivators.

The Black Robe Society didn't make everyone wait long! They continued to transport more bodies. The number of corpses steadily increased, and eventually, they weren't just cultivators' bodies, but also ordinary mortals'. Old and young, women and children, strong young men—people of all statuses. All transported from the mortal town nearby. Soon, the number of corpses laid out on the ground reached over three thousand.

Immediately, Lu Xu and Old Xu understood the purpose of these bodies. The Black Robe Society leader, standing high in the air, produced a pitch-black alms bowl, covered with a lid. The leader muttered incantations. After a series of spells, the surface of the bowl immediately glowed with a dark light. Then, he opened the lid and suddenly splashed the contents into the air.

A bowlful of water was flung out. This water, instead of falling, hovered in the air, its shape constantly shifting, eventually forming a spherical water ball about the size of a human head. The surface of this water ball undulated for a moment, and then a black maggot, about the length of a finger, suddenly crawled out from within. After squirming out of the water ball and pausing in the air, the maggot swiftly flew down to a corpse on the ground and burrowed into it.

The next moment, that corpse violently opened its eyes. There were no whites; its eyes were entirely black, exuding a repulsive, ominous aura. The corpse stood up, its body stiff, and began to walk towards the second-tier grand array. This scene unfolded on every corpse on the ground. From the black spherical ball in the sky, countless maggots squirmed out frantically, burrowing into the bodies.

“Demonic arts! Demonic secret techniques!” Old Xu’s eyes filled with horror.

Since ancient times, Daoist teachings held that: *A Daoist bowl of water contains eighty-four thousand insects!* Because they believed water contained countless tiny creatures, Daoists would use water purification spells to kill these insects before drinking. But the demonic path did the opposite: they cultivated insects with water, developing the most sinister and poisonous demonic secret arts. Now, Lu Xu and Old Xu were witnessing it firsthand!

Three thousand corpses stood up, each with an expression that struck fear into one’s heart. Initially, their movements were stiff, but they soon became flexible, moving and leaping with an agility that surpassed even normal cultivators.

“Quick, activate the array’s power to destroy them!” The Mo family head, filled with unease at this sight, quickly shouted the command.

“Boom!”

The second-tier grand array, the Azure Water Surging Array, which enveloped the entire market city, truly unleashed its power. As azure light flowed, wave after wave of water surged from the grand array, coalescing into a colossal flood dragon that coiled towards the reanimated corpses, tearing them apart.

“Boom! Boom!”

Explosions erupted one after another. The corpses didn’t even attempt to fight the Azure Water Flood Dragon; upon contact, they immediately detonated. The power of these self-detonations was immense, instantly scattering a significant portion of the water waves.

“Hmph! Do they think they can break a second-tier grand array with such methods?” A Mo family elder, presiding over the array, scoffed. The Mo family ancestor was still recuperating, so the grand array was currently under the control of several elders. They couldn’t unleash the array’s full power, but it was enough to deal with these corpses.

When they saw the bizarre corpses proving no match for the Azure Water Flood Dragon, the Mo family elders all smiled. They had complete confidence in the grand array! However, these elders didn’t seem to notice that every time a corpse exploded, a black light would invariably merge into the flood dragon’s body. Once the black light entered the flood dragon’s body, it immediately assimilated and became transparent. From the outside, no abnormality could be seen.

“Boom! Boom!”

In a blink of an eye, two to three hundred corpses had exploded. The flood dragon glittered under the sunlight, its aura intimidating. It had an almost invincible, indomitable presence! The cultivators in the market city were overjoyed at this sight, praising the extraordinary nature of the grand array. It was clear that protecting the market city would be no problem.

However, as these outsiders remained blissfully ignorant, the Mo family elders presiding over the array detected something amiss! The Azure Water Flood Dragon, conjured by the Azure Water Surging Array, was becoming increasingly difficult to control. It no longer felt as responsive as when it first appeared.

“This is bad!”

With a cry of alarm, the Mo family elders quickly performed hand seals, attempting to recall the flood dragon. But it was too late. The remaining two thousand-plus corpses simultaneously leaped towards the flood dragon and exploded! So much black blood erupted at once, creating what seemed like a black curtain in the sky.

Accompanied by this earth-shattering explosion, the flood dragon was utterly scattered and disintegrated. The water waves that formed its body dispersed upon exploding and fell onto the array, immediately merging into it. The Mo family elders presiding over the array were utterly stunned, a strong sense of unease welling up in their hearts. They looked up; the array still appeared normal, the water curtain enveloping everyone transparent and clear, providing a sense of security and reliability.

However, the Black Robe Society leader in the sky curled his lips into a faint smile. He pointed his hand from afar, and suddenly, black spots began to appear on the azure water curtain covering the market city. These spots were initially as small as a needlepoint, but in a blink of an eye, they grew to the size of a thumb, then spread rapidly. Palm-sized, millstone-sized… The black spots merged together, and right before everyone’s terrified eyes, they turned the entire water curtain pitch black.

Darkness enveloped Azure Lake Market City, without a single glimmer of light, accompanied by boundless terror. A pattering sound echoed, as if it were raining from the sky. A cultivator looked up, feeling raindrops land on his face, bringing with them a foul stench of decay.

*What kind of rain is this?*

No sooner had this question arisen in his mind than he suddenly felt something squirming on his face. He reached up and touched it; it was soft and sticky, wriggling in his hand. He was jolted awake and opened his Spiritual Eye Technique to look. What he held in his hand was actually a pitch-black maggot.

“Ahh!!!”

Drop after drop of rain fell. As soon as these dark raindrops touched anything, they would immediately transform into black maggots, just like the maggots that had burrowed into the corpses earlier. At that moment, this cultivator’s face and body were already covered with these maggots. He let out a horrifying scream, unable to react in time. The maggots burrowed into his body one after another. In just a few moments, his screams abruptly ceased. His body stiffened, unmoving.

A moment later, he violently opened his eyes; there were no whites, only a terrifying blackness within!
