# Chapter 72: I Slay an Immortal Today!

"For over a century, he still hasn't found the body he desires?" Yuan Zhengfeng sighed and asked, "Speaking of which, back in the day, I discovered my own anomaly through this divine artifact. How did you come to know about it?"

"..."

Li Zhengjing's expression turned grave as he focused his mind and glanced at the golden page.

Before he could respond, Yuan Zhengfeng continued, "You weren't surprised by the existence of the Debt Collector, and you clearly already knew about the concept of a spare body."

"When I was nestled against your chest, I faintly sensed a piercing pain in my divine soul—it was the sword energy within your body, nearly bursting forth and on the verge of rebelling against you!"

"If my guess is correct, this is the Great Yan Cave Void Transformation Sword Qi, long sealed away by the Kunlun Immortal Sect. Only the direct lineage of the Kunlun Immortal Sect can access it. In the past thousand years, only the Young Sect Master has mastered it, hailed as invincible below the Immortal realm!"

"Outside the Kunlun Immortal Sect, legend has it that only the 'Debt Collector' possesses this supreme sword technique."

His tone carried a hint of complexity as he said, "You cultivated this sword technique at the Inner Qi stage, harboring hidden dangers. Your life won't last long, and soon... you'll likely be discarded by the Debt Collector."

Li Zhengjing fell silent for a moment before asking, "Elder Yuan, do you have a way to resolve my current predicament?"

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice sounded again, replying, "The Great Yan Cave Void Transformation Sword Qi is a secret technique of Kunlun. Even the Kunlun Immortal Sect could only seal it away in the end. How could I have a solution? Moreover... even if you survive this crisis, what then?"

His voice lowered as he said, "Both you and I are chess pieces in the Debt Collector's hands. Our fates have long been predetermined..."

Li Zhengjing looked at the broken jade fragment in his hand and said slowly, "But fate isn't necessarily set in stone, is it? Your physical body didn't fall into his hands, did it?"

Yuan Zhengfeng paused, then suddenly burst into laughter, sounding quite cheerful. But his laughter gradually faded, tinged with self-mockery.

"In the past, relying on this divine artifact, I avoided countless dangers, concealed my brilliance, and blended into the crowd. Yet I still couldn't escape the Debt Collector's perception."

"Later, I felt utterly hopeless. I sought opportunities to leave the mountain, displayed my innate talents, and after much planning, finally achieved the Immortal realm. I thought I could barely protect myself and resist him."

"But even as an Immortal, didn't I still end up in this miserable state?"

His voice was full of self-mockery as he said, "Look at me now—I can't even call it clinging to life, can I? He didn't obtain my body, but I've lost it all the same..."

Li Zhengjing fell silent. From Yuan Zhengfeng's voice, he heard nothing but despair and desolation.

"I, too, was once full of hope, but in the end..."

Yuan Zhengfeng said gloomily, "I cultivated to the Immortal realm, condensed my Yin Spirit, and transformed my True Qi into Golden Soup and Jade Liquid! From then on, I could summon wind and rain, ride clouds and mist, and even move mountains and fill seas! But when I was ordered to come to Mount Fengdu and witnessed that battle—a battle that shook heaven and earth—it shattered all my confidence..."

"Though I only saw the spectacle from afar and never faced it directly, my spirit was utterly crushed in that battle."

"Legend has it that on that day, the Sect Master of our Yu Hua Immortal Sect discovered the Debt Collector's traces at Mount Fengdu and fought him to the death!"

"The world says they perished together, but I alone know—he still lives!"

"So after Elder Yuan left, your spirit broken and fearing the Debt Collector would come for your body, you abandoned it?" Li Zhengjing asked.

"Exactly. The Golden Soup and Jade Liquid in my body were formed from the foundation of my Yin Spirit and the condensation of my True Qi into magic power!" Yuan Zhengfeng said gloomily. "I don't know the origins of this divine artifact, but by pouring all my magic power into it, my physical shell was emptied! And this artifact... became my new body!"

"Except this so-called new body is ultimately just a broken piece of jade. Losing your body is equivalent to becoming a ghostly spirit." Li Zhengjing's voice was also somewhat hoarse as he said, "So only in this place, akin to the legendary 'Underworld,' did you have a chance to awaken?"

"Correct," Yuan Zhengfeng replied.

"Then who is the Debt Collector's true form?" Li Zhengjing asked quietly.

"He is mysterious and unfathomable!" Yuan Zhengfeng's tone grew even gloomier. "I exhausted my life's efforts, secretly accumulating strength to resist him, only to end up like this. All I know is that he is called the Debt Collector—nothing more!"

"..."

Li Zhengjing frowned, considering whether to directly inquire about the Thousand Illusions Divine Monarch, when suddenly the world spun around him!

With a thunderous crash!

The entire house shook!

To be precise, the entire earth trembled!

"What's happening?"

"The helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation is forcefully breaking in from outside!" Yuan Zhengfeng's voice came through, filled with astonishment. "This place should be impregnable. How can he shake it?"

"The disturbance is coming from the northwest!" Li Zhengjing's eyes sharpened as he swallowed a Creation Five Elements Pill to heal his injuries and restore his Inner Qi.

"The northwest..." The broken jade fragment trembled slightly, followed by a sigh. "No wonder he dares to shake this sacred land. The formations here have already been broken! The damage is recent—likely the work of the Great Zhou Dynasty's founding State Preceptor!"

"Why would he destroy the formations?" Li Zhengjing asked, both shocked and furious.

"He's feigned death for years, lying dormant for too long. Presumably, he lacked modern tokens, so with his mastery of formations, he found a flaw and dismantled a corner of the array." Yuan Zhengfeng explained before adding, "You seem to have a Buddhist treasure on you?"

"I do!" Li Zhengjing quickly took out the Buddhist beads gifted by the Vajra Temple's Buddhist disciple.

"Bury it in the northwest corner. It can partially restore the formations left by the Buddhist monks, buying us about half an hour." Yuan Zhengfeng said.

"And after half an hour?" Li Zhengjing asked, sensing the implication.

"We can only wait to die."

"..."

"Though he's severely injured, he's still an Immortal. An ant like you can't fight back!"

Yuan Zhengfeng sighed. "If I were still alive, I'd have the confidence to kill this heavily wounded helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation! But now, hiding in this divine artifact, I'm barely clinging to life, with no power to fight him."

Here, he seemed somewhat regretful and added consolingly, "Look on the bright side—you were going to die sooner or later anyway. There's no need to grieve too much now! As they say, better to die early than late. If you die now, the Debt Collector will surely be furious and might personally kill this helmsman to vent his anger. Consider it avenging you!"

"..."

Li Zhengjing's expression darkened as he cursed inwardly. Who would've thought this old man's true nature was even more unreliable than the madman Xu Ji?

With that in mind, he abandoned any thought of conserving spirit stones and focused his mind on the "Fortune" section of the golden page.

Fortune: Trapped on the outskirts of Mount Fengdu, surrounded by countless ghostly spirits and corpse-demons, with no escape. After the Ninth Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation breaks the damaged formation, you will be suppressed, your flesh and blood devoured, dying without a whole corpse!

Method to Alter Fate: ...Insufficient spiritual energy!
If all visceral Inner Qi is expended, only three graded spirit stones are needed to replenish it!
Strongly recommend replenishing with five graded spirit stones to retain some visceral Inner Qi!

Without hesitation, Li Zhengjing took out five graded spirit stones and stuffed them into his mouth.

"What are you doing? Trying to deny him the spirit stones by swallowing them?" Yuan Zhengfeng was puzzled. "From what I've seen, this man practices demonic arts and will surely devour your flesh. He'll dig the stones out of your intestines eventually... They'll still end up in his hands..."

"If I die, your fate won't be any better! Since you're no help, why don't you take a break..."

Li Zhengjing was furious, but the next moment, his expression froze before turning gentle. "Elder Yuan, do me a favor..."

"What do you mean?" Yuan Zhengfeng suddenly felt uneasy.

"Lend me your magic power." Li Zhengjing said, gripping the broken jade.

"What do you mean?" Yuan Zhengfeng panicked and shouted, "Let go of me! Why are you eating me? Even at death's door, one must maintain dignity. How can you give up so easily? You're going to die—that's a fact. Even if you're angry, eating me won't help!"

"Relax, Elder. Don't struggle, don't resist. Leave it to me..."

Li Zhengjing placed the broken jade in his mouth and focused his mind on the "Fortune" section of the golden page.

Method to Alter Fate as Follows: Place the divine artifact in your mouth and activate the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique to mobilize the magic power within Yuan Zhengfeng!
Using Immortal-level magic power as a foundation, condense the Great Yan Cave Void Transformation Sword Qi and instantly execute the Sword Nurturing Art, storing it within the 36,500 muscles of your left arm!
Note 1: When condensing the Great Yan Cave Void Transformation Sword Qi with Immortal-level magic power, do not exceed "one-tenth" of its strength. Otherwise, the sword qi will be too potent, and the remaining magic power will be insufficient to protect your body. Your flesh will be instantly pierced, riddled with holes, and you will die without a whole corpse!
Note 2: You must execute the Sword Nurturing Art instantly, storing the sword qi in your left arm, and release the Great Yan Cave Void Transformation Sword Qi from your left arm within three breaths! Otherwise, the sword qi will backlash, and you will die without a whole corpse!

"How can you mobilize my magic power?"

As Li Zhengjing activated the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique, Yuan Zhengfeng's voice rang in his mind again, filled with alarm.

"This magic power is the culmination of my lifelong cultivation, rooted in my divine soul. It can only be mobilized by my will. How can you command it?"

"Moreover, you're only at the Inner Qi stage, not yet at the True Qi level. Your meridians aren't fully opened, so you can't even perform divine abilities!"

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice was full of disbelief and confusion. "Your body is still weak. The magic power's flow is too intense, with nowhere to vent. Aren't you afraid my immense magic power will explode your body, turning you into minced meat?"

But before Li Zhengjing could respond, a thunderous crash sounded outside the house!

A greenish light illuminated the surroundings.

"A broken, abandoned place dares to block my path?"

A hoarse voice echoed through the area, proclaiming loudly, "On this land, you are the only source of blood, the only medicine to halt the worsening of my injuries. You cannot escape!"

At this moment, the Ninth Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation erupted with magic power, his figure towering and imposing!

With his aura alone, he repelled all the surrounding sinister energy!

One hand pressed against the massive wound at his waist, while the other gripped his cane, sweeping it across the surroundings!

A fierce gale arose, and brilliant light flared!

This once-sacred ground, where high-ranking figures had convened for discussions, was reduced to ruins under his assault!

Houses collapsed in succession!

"Found you!"

The Ninth Helmsman's eyes lit up with delight as he took a single step, crossing a hundred yards, and tore open the collapsed house.

Then a blazing light erupted from within!

The flames were fierce and concentrated, carrying an overwhelming sword intent, sharp beyond measure!

In an instant, the flame, condensed like a sword, shot forth like a dragon, striking head-on!

"What?"

The helmsman's face paled in shock!

His eyes filled with terror in that moment!

His expression was one of utter disbelief!

At such close range, caught off guard, he faced this ferocious and razor-sharp divine ability!

Even at his peak, he wouldn't have been able to evade it easily!

In haste, he crossed his cane before his chest, channeling all his magic power into it!

He frantically summoned his magic power, even at the cost of worsening his injuries!

A deafening explosion shook the heavens!

The entire Mount Fengdu trembled!

Cliffs shook, rocks tumbled, and ghostly creatures wailed in terror, scattering in all directions.

The flaming sword, like a dragon, pinned the green-glowing Immortal against the cliff wall, burying him deep within!

Inside the house, Li Zhengjing gasped for breath, his left arm charred black, emitting white smoke and the smell of cooked flesh.

Gripping the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber for support, he swayed unsteadily, his vision darkening.

Had it not been for the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison-Suppressing Technique channeling 90% of Yuan Zhengfeng's magic power to protect him, his body would have shattered.

Even so, his injuries were severe, especially his left arm, which was half-ruined, rendering him unable to wield the Blazing Fire Divine Sword again!

"You actually used up a full tenth of my magic power?" Yuan Zhengfeng exclaimed in shock. "After my death, without a physical body, my magic power cannot be replenished through cultivation. It's the foundation of my lingering life, preserving my divine soul! You're killing me!"

"..."

Li Zhengjing panted heavily, staring at the deep hole in the cliff wall. "That sword strike just now could have pierced through a mountain, couldn't it?"

Unease crept into his heart as he muttered, "Is he dead?"

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Suddenly, from deep within the cliff, heartbeats echoed like massive drums!

A figure slowly emerged!

This figure was aged and hunched, but enveloped in green light, clutching half of his shattered cane.

Yet his eyes burned with intensity, filled with dark, icy fury!

"To think the only prey on this land was a wolf in sheep's clothing!"

The Ninth Helmsman trembled—not just from anger, but from bone-chilling cold.

His abdomen had been completely pierced, his organs mangled.

Already grievously wounded, caught off guard by the Blazing Fire Divine Sword through his chest, he was beyond saving, with no hope of survival.

Summoning his last reserves of magic power, he abandoned thoughts of escape and fixed his gaze on the youth, snarling, "You'll join me in death!"

"He's not dead?"

Li Zhengjing's heart pounded. He tried to raise his left arm, but the excruciating pain left him powerless to wield the Blazing Fire Divine Sword again. He could only grip the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber with his right hand.

He didn't know how long he could last, bolstering his body with the Immortal-level magic power to fight brute force against brute force, but he had no other choice!

Meanwhile, Yuan Zhengfeng continued his incessant grumbling, lamenting the lost magic power: "You're murdering me! You're gambling with my life! Every bit of magic power spent is irreplaceable!"

"I can replenish your magic power for you!"

Li Zhengjing swallowed all his graded spirit stones. The golden page absorbed their spiritual energy, feeding it back to him—directly replenishing Yuan Zhengfeng's magic power!

"What?"

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice was filled with disbelief, then immediately shifted to joy. "Really?"

At that moment, the Ninth Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation charged forward.

"Die!"

He soared through the air, gathering the sinister energy of Mount Fengdu around him!

Green light engulfed the heavens and earth!

He descended like a storm, unleashing his final assault!

He held nothing back, letting his injuries worsen!

Before his life force drained entirely, he would crush the youth who had brought him to ruin!

"..."

Li Zhengjing clenched his teeth, gripping the saber, ready to fight to the death, when Yuan Zhengfeng's voice rang in his ears.

"Let me handle this! Let me fight him!"

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice brimmed with excitement and elation: "You're too young, inexperienced in battles at the Immortal level! This old fox has centuries of cunning—it's too deep for you! Relax your body and leave it to me..."

After over a decade of death, he finally had the chance to borrow Li Zhengjing's body and engage in a fierce battle with an Immortal!

As long as his magic power could be replenished, he had no reservations!

After Li Zhengjing checked the golden page's "Fortune" section to confirm no mishap, he completely relaxed his mind, as if his spirit had left his body, yielding control to Yuan Zhengfeng.

Yuan Zhengfeng, wielding the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, charged forward!

Though Li Zhengjing's meridians were unopened, preventing him from using divine abilities or cloud-soaring, Yuan Zhengfeng concentrated magic power in his legs and leaped into the air.

Mid-flight, he swung the saber, slashing downward!

"Helmsman, take my sword strike!"

He used the saber as a sword, executing sword techniques.

But with his meridians blocked, his magic power couldn't manifest externally, reducing the battle to close combat.

"Is this all you've got?"

The Ninth Helmsman sneered, parrying with his cane.

Simultaneously, his other hand burst into flames, striking at Li Zhengjing's head.

The palm moved too fast to see—a mere blur before it was upon him.

Li Zhengjing's heart raced, but under Yuan Zhengfeng's control, he released the saber and punched forward!

"Truth-Seeking Fist!"

Fist met palm, and energies clashed!

In an instant, they exchanged over a dozen blows!

Then, unable to soar, Li Zhengjing was struck down from the sky, crashing through a house.

"We can't win! Run!"

Li Zhengjing spat blood as he struggled to his feet, his organs shaken and meridians ruptured.

Under Yuan Zhengfeng's control, his body fled desperately. "A starved camel is still bigger than a horse. Even with my magic power, your body isn't Immortal-level. Your right arm is broken... and your left was already crippled..."

"He's using a demonic art, burning all his life force to fight us to the death!"

"Run further! Once his life force runs out, we'll survive!"

"Don't panic. With me, Yuan Zhengfeng, here, you won't die! We'll outlast him!"

But then, green light flashed ahead as the Ninth Helmsman appeared before them, his face cold, thrusting his cane forward.

A sharp whistling sound!

Light flared from the cane!

Li Zhengjing felt a sudden pain in his chest.

The protective mirror blocked the strike, preventing a fatal blow.

But the immense force sent him flying, his organs jolted as he was hurled backward.

A series of crashes!

His entire body shuddered, his back in agony—he had smashed through countless houses before slamming into a cliff.

Embedded in the rock, he spat a mouthful of blood.

"I underestimated him. That was reckless of me." Yuan Zhengfeng muttered. "Bones broken, flesh pulverized. Though I've protected your head and organs with magic power, I doubt you'll survive."

"Shut up!"

Li Zhengjing couldn't speak, but inwardly he cursed: "He's also an Immortal, heavily wounded by the Ancient Moon Peak Master, brought to the brink of death by my Blazing Fire Divine Sword, hanging by a thread... How can you still lose to him?"

"He may be near death, but I'm already dead!"

Yuan Zhengfeng grumbled. "More importantly, your left arm is useless, and your meridians are blocked. I can't use my full abilities—it's just brute force... Even with Immortal-level magic power, your body is only at the Inner Qi stage. We can't win."

He sighed. "You're losing life force rapidly. You won't survive. But he's dying too. Dragging down the Ninth Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation as your funeral companion isn't a bad deal..."

Li Zhengjing looked ahead and saw the old man take one step forward before collapsing.

The Ninth Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation had finally exhausted his life force.

Green magic power spilled from his body, dissipating into the world.

He could no longer control his magic power—his strength was spent, his Yin Spirit scattered.

But his eyes remained fixed on Li Zhengjing, and with his last breath, he let out a cold laugh.

"Playing the weak to ambush me?"

"Even as I die, I'll drag you down with me!"

"However a youth like you, with such low cultivation, possesses such power—it doesn't matter now."

"No matter how prodigious, you'll share my grave."

His breathing weakened, the light in his eyes fading.

Then, in the next moment, his dimming gaze suddenly sharpened, filled with shock, madness, and fury.

He saw the near-dead youth tremblingly stuff a pill into his mouth.

And then, the youth on death's doorstep was reborn.

"Who said I'm dying with you?"

Li Zhengjing sneered as a surge of vitality spread through his body, healing his wounds.

The meridians ravaged by Immortal-level magic power began to regenerate.

His shattered bones and pulverized flesh reformed under the revitalizing energy.

His eyes brightened as he glanced at his charred left arm—its dead skin sloughing off, new flesh growing beneath.

"The Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pill?"

Yuan Zhengfeng was stunned. "With your cultivation and status, how do you possess such a divine artifact? Even when I was an inner elder, I was never granted such a treasure... It's said to reverse life and death, hailed as a cultivator's second life!"

Li Zhengjing didn't respond. He pulled himself from the cliff and stared solemnly at the furious Immortal before him.

"I refuse to accept this!"

The Ninth Helmsman's eyes burned with rage and resentment, filled with venomous hatred!

A supreme Immortal, after a great battle, hadn't fallen to the Ancient Moon Peak Master's hands—but to a junior like this?

Now he was dying, yet this youth would live?

How could he rest in peace?

His eyes widened, his body trembling as he muttered incantations.

Then the youth raised his left arm.

"Can't rest in peace?"

"Then why keep those eyes?"

"Let me help you rest!"

The fiery sword intent in his left arm erupted, shooting toward the Ninth Helmsman!

In an instant, the blazing sword reduced the area to scorched earth!

Li Zhengjing slumped to the ground, panting, watching his recovering hands before bursting into laughter.

"Transcending mortality, standing above the mortal world, living a thousand years—this is an Immortal!"

He gazed at the charred ground and laughed wildly. "Today, I slew an Immortal!"

He laughed for a long time before spitting out the broken jade fragment and holding it, his expression turning odd. "Elder Yuan, you were an Immortal in your time. Why are you so excited?"

"What do you know? He was an Immortal! A transcendent being!" Yuan Zhengfeng's voice was ecstatic. "When I first became an Immortal, I killed myself immediately—I never had the chance to defeat, let alone kill, another Immortal! This is the most glorious achievement of my century-long cultivation!"

"But I killed him," Li Zhengjing muttered.

"We're one now—why distinguish between us?" Yuan Zhengfeng said.

"But he was already critically wounded by the Ancient Moon Peak Master, caught off guard by our ambush, hanging by a thread..." Li Zhengjing said quietly. "This wasn't really us killing him—we just outlasted him. And we got beaten up the whole time..."

"Why fuss over details now?" Yuan Zhengfeng said. "Back then, I was too meticulous and made too many enemies in the Law Enforcement Hall. Don't follow my example..."

"..."

Li Zhengjing fell silent for a moment before looking at the scorched earth.

Was the Ninth Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation truly dead this time?

An Immortal, even on the brink of death, was unimaginably powerful!

"Relax. His Immortal body's life force is extinguished. Without a divine artifact like mine to house his magic power and soul, he's truly dead."

Yuan Zhengfeng sounded triumphant. "If he revives, we'll just kill him again!"

Then, ahead, Yin energy gathered, swirling like a vortex where the Ninth Helmsman had fallen, forming a storm of sinister energy!

"..."

Li Zhengjing's eyes froze, his mouth dry.

Yuan Zhengfeng's triumphant voice faltered. "He... died with too much resentment, his hatred unfulfilled. Before death, he used a demonic art to summon Mount Fengdu's evil energy?"

Li Zhengjing's eyes flickered. "Is he becoming a vengeful ghost? Or a corpse king?"

Yuan Zhengfeng pondered. "No matter. Alive, he died by our hands. Dead, he's just brute force—even less of a threat! Swallow another twenty or thirty graded spirit stones, and I'll pound his corpse into dust!"

Li Zhengjing shook his head. "I'm out of spirit stones."

"Then why aren't you running?"

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice rose sharply. "Run!"

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page but didn't move.

Ahead, the Yin energy coalesced into a broken figure slowly rising, exuding deathly aura.

"Had I not been wounded by the Ancient Moon Peak Master, had I not been careless, how could you have killed me?"

"Even in death, I'll drag you down!"

"I—"

A golden streak shot through the air!

The Immortal corpse was seized by golden light.

Two lights—one gold, one green—clashed fiercely in the sky!

"An ally? That lunatic from the Kunlun Immortal Sect?"

Yuan Zhengfeng was stunned. "Wait... That's not his aura..."

Moments later, the green light plummeted to Mount Fengdu's western side.

The golden light turned and approached—revealing a pair of golden wings.

As it drew near, the light condensed into an old man landing on the ground.

Closer inspection revealed the man had eagle's legs, a dragon's claw for a left hand, golden eyes, and fierce fangs.

"The Ninth Helmsman of the Golden Ship of Salvation, though near death, was still an Immortal. Yet you forced him to use the Netherworld Demonic Art, turning himself into an abomination?"

"Ghost Valley Spirit Official?"

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice was wary.

Li Zhengjing's expression was complex. "So he really is the 'scoundrel' Xu Ji spoke of..."
