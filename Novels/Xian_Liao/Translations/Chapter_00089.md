# Chapter 89: The Decisive Battle in the Imperial City (Part 1)

Returning to the palace, the eunuch grandmaster arrived at the altar the emperor had built for him. Having obtained the beast hide from Tang Jieyuan and with Tang's assistance in deciphering the ancient scripture's contents, he was overwhelmed with excitement.

At his age, the paths of life had seemed sealed, but now, with the knowledge of the ancient scripture, he had found another way forward. Meanwhile, the young upstart Zhou Qing from Qingfu Palace and Zhang Jingxiu from the Taihe Sect would likely arrive soon.

Once he dealt with these two, he and the emperor could freely demand the world's offerings for their cultivation. After all, the grassland's martial saint had already been defeated by him and would need at least a decade to recover from his injuries.

On the altar, the eunuch grandmaster performed a series of steps, a technique derived from the Daoist practice of pacing the stars and treading the Dipper. The air around him surged, producing sounds like wind and thunder.

Alas, it wasn't true thunder magic, but it greatly benefited his cultivation and state of mind. From now on, he needed to maintain his peak condition to face the arrival of the two innate masters.

With each step, he exuded an aura of ancient mystery. The emperor often observed from a distance during these moments, attempting to grasp the essence.

"A small stone bow and cold iron arrows."

It was through his peak second-layer Qi Refining divine sense that he had achieved a complete victory over the grassland's thunderous might. This was no mere challenge—it was a death warrant.

With a light leap, he reached the treetop.

The eunuch grandmaster nodded slightly. "Youth will be youth. Even Tang Jieyuan has only entered the innate realm a few years ago. They have no idea how vast the gap between innate masters truly is."

Tiger's Roar Golden Bell Shield, Dragon's Chant Iron Shirt!

Zhou Qing's energy remained unaffected by the demonic tree; instead, it grew stronger.

Because that internal strife had been far too unnatural.

The demonic tree's aerial roots, like tentacles, attempted to block Zhou Qing.

Yet these words sounded utterly ironic.

The shockwave before his chest exploded with the sound of a bowstring, like thunder, as an arrow shot toward the seated Fushan Zhou Qing.

The air fell silent.

Along their journey, they had already collected many corpses.

"Take a look."

Shadowless Leg.

Tang Jieyuan: "Wait, didn't you go to deliver the challenge?"

"Zhou Qing, he's actually at the second layer of body refinement." Fushan Zhou Qing was astonished. No matter how he thought about it, he hadn't expected the grandmaster to have advanced to the innate realm, let alone reached the second layer of body refinement.

He blocked seven strikes in succession. Initially, to evade Zhou Qing's arrow, he had lost the initiative. Now, he didn't even have a chance to catch his breath.

A spring thunderclap exploded.

Their energies collided.

An arrow landed beside the altar, stirring up dust.

Because he realized that no matter what, Zhou Qing could lock onto his position.

Zhou Qing and the others moved through the night like shadows. Even the weakest among them, Fushan, could scale the capital's walls with ease. Following the three who moved as if strolling through a courtyard yet left no trace, they arrived outside the red walls.

The speaker was Zhang Jingxiu.

"Right now, we lack everything except money."

---

The deafening roar echoed as a streak of cold iron light, like a shooting star, shot into the palace grounds near the altar.

"It should be tomorrow night. The night of the full moon, the pinnacle of the Forbidden City—a battle befitting innate masters."

"Stop those three behind us."

It took less than half a day for Zhou Qing's challenge to spread throughout the capital. Those who remained in the city all had some background or skill.

"Make your final arrangements."

Four innate masters hunting down an old relic of the past—there was no chance of failure.

Soon, Fushan Zhou Qing sensed the energy.

Dealing with two newly advanced innate juniors was far easier than facing the grassland's thunderous might.

This battle had also given the eunuch Zhou Qing more experience in innate-level combat.

As Fushan Zhou Qing ascended, he inhaled deeply and exhaled arrows like bolts from a crossbow, his entire body vibrating. The breath he expelled was no less lethal than real cold iron arrows.

But Zhou Qing didn't seize the chance to attack. Instead, his Xuan Yin surged endlessly, his bones and sinews resonating as his body expanded.

"What does the challenge letter say?"

This was the ultimate manifestation of Qi and blood exertion.

The longer one watched, the more one felt as if they could sense the breath of all things and commune with the heavens.

The eunuch Zhou Qing, despite a century of cultivation, couldn't help but feel anger rise within him.

Zhou Qing's robe fluttered like a crane's wings as he transformed into a streak of light, soaring into the sky.

The Son of Heaven, ordained by heaven, was blessed with longevity and prosperity.

"There's some heroism in this," someone murmured.

"After all, they're two innate masters. This battle will surely shake the heavens, no less than Zhou Qing's previous fight against the grassland's thunderous might."

Before he could finish, Zhou Qing chuckled. "From now on, we shall be legends. The palace holds many secrets, but none can remain hidden forever."

"Brother, aren't you resting?"

Boom!

He was slightly surprised.

But just in case, he had Zhishan accompany them.

Fushan: "..."

Yet this was also a reflection of the recent climatic anomalies.

"Princes and nobles are placing bets?"

Today was clear, but as the sun set, a massive shadow enveloped the imperial capital. The moon slowly emerged.

Zhou Qing executed the Shadowless Leg, following like a shadow.

"No literary flair—just five words."

Fushan Zhou Qing's anger flared as he secretly prepared for Zhou Qing's sneak attack.

Atop the western side hall of the palace.

The crowd burst into laughter.

This was the pinnacle of Qi and blood exertion.

Zhou Qing returned to their temporary lodgings. The capital's walls were nothing to him; the palace was a place he could come and go from as he pleased.

Even Zhou Qing and Fushan, at Zhishan's request, helped—mainly digging pits rather than burying bodies.

The rain grew heavier, the downpour burying the world.

Too fast!

---

The atmosphere of the decisive battle was like a drawn bowstring, ready to snap at any moment.

Several imperial guards and two eunuchs appeared beside the emperor, forming a human shield.

By now, Zhou Qing had cast aside all distractions, devoting himself entirely to this life-or-death duel.

The young man at the forefront drew his bow and nocked an arrow.

But these men, armed with blades and spears, couldn't stop them.

This spring thunderstorm was utterly abnormal.

The nobleman laughed. "Southerners are frogs at the bottom of a well. What do they know of Zhou Qing's methods? Many of us have witnessed his power firsthand. Even the legendary generals who could take an enemy's head amidst ten thousand soldiers are nothing before Zhou Qing."

"Such audacity."

The Tiger's Roar Golden Bell Shield and Dragon's Chant Iron Shirt!

Zhou Qing's energy remained entirely unaffected by the demonic tree—in fact, it grew stronger.
