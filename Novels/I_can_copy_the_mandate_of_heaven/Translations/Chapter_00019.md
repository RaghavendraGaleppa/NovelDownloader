## Chapter 19: Two Years Later

After bidding farewell to Da Niu, Li Zhi Ming did not take the familiar path back to the medicinal valley. Instead, he headed deeper into the mountains, a place rarely visited by humans, let alone disciples of the Qi Xuan Gate. The mountains stretched out endlessly, with many areas untouched by human feet. Some valleys and gorges remained unknown to the world.

Ten-year-old Li Zhi Ming was much more energetic than two years ago. He climbed mountains, crossed streams, and pushed through thorns, trekking for half a day until he arrived at a secluded valley. The valley was small, no more than a hundred square meters, with a clear pond inside.

As he entered the valley, Li Zhi Ming spotted Han Li, wearing only a pair of shorts, bathing in the river, and catching fish. Han Li seemed to be enjoying himself, his body half-submerged in the water.

Without hesitation, Li Zhi Ming quickly undressed and jumped into the water, playfully pressing Han Li's head underwater. Han Li struggled and tried to retaliate, but Li Zhi Ming was too quick. After a few rounds of splashing and teasing, Li Zhi Ming emerged from the water, holding a large fish in his arms.

Han Li, now out of the water and dressed, glared at Li Zhi Ming. "You damn egg! Today, I'm going to kill you!"

The two friends spent the afternoon catching and cooking the fish, then sat down to enjoy their meal. As they ate, Li Zhi Ming teased Han Li about his slow progress in practicing the Chang Chun Jue. Han Li seemed a bit defensive, but Li Zhi Ming just joked that his own positive energy techniques were far more effective.

After finishing their meal, Li Zhi Ming suggested they explore the outside world. "I'm bored in this valley. Let's go look around. Who knows what we might find? Maybe we can even stumble upon some immortal ruins."

Han Li was hesitant at first, but Li Zhi Ming's enthusiasm was infectious. They set off, trekking through the dense forest, pushing through thorns, and climbing over rocks. The journey was arduous, and Han Li began to complain.

"There could be nothing here!" he grumbled.

Li Zhi Ming encouraged him, quoting an old saying, "Before a great responsibility is given to a person, their heart and muscles must be tormented." He joked that if they wanted to find treasures, they had to put in some effort.

As they pushed through a thicket, Li Zhi Ming suddenly stopped in his tracks. Before them lay a hidden valley, with several stone rooms. Li Zhi Ming's eyes widened in disbelief. Could it be? He rubbed his eyes, wondering if he was seeing things.

The valley seemed well-maintained, with no signs of abandonment. Li Zhi Ming hesitated, unsure what to do next. Han Li caught up, and Li Zhi Ming motioned for him to be quiet. They observed the valley from a distance, trying to make sense of what they were seeing.

"What is it?" Han Li whispered.

Li Zhi Ming pointed to the stone rooms, his eyes shining with excitement and curiosity.
