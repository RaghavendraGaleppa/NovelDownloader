# Chapter 143: The Unique Skills of Each Hall

After repeatedly grinding his forging proficiency for the day, Xu Yunfan realized that to craft a mechanism box himself, he still needed knowledge from the other three departments: the Molten Gold Hall, the Mechanism Hall, and the Heavenly Work Department.

The萤石 lamps embedded in the rock walls cast long shadows of the two figures.

Despite the high heat causing the bandages on Yan Yuwei’s arms to seep with淡红 blood, she still swung her meteor hammer with formidable force. "The essence of Molten Gold Iron-Forging Technique lies in finding the vein! It is the same when striking an enemy—find the pulse and apply force, leaving a deep scar with a greatsword!"

As the hammer head pierced the rock wall, sparks flew and burned small holes into Xu Yunfan’s clothes. He expressionlessly brushed them off.

Yan Yuwei turned her head. "Have you memorized the cultivation essentials of the Molten Gold Iron-Forging Technique?"

Xu Yunfan nodded. "I read through it thoroughly last night."

Thanks to the "Lin" character mantra, he had mastered it completely after just a few readings. For the parts he didn't understand, he privately entered the "Lin" state and quickly grasped the key points.

"The Earth’s Vein of庚金 Qi is hidden three inches and seven分 deep within the rock marrow. When striking with the hammer, you must secretly align with the three forces of 'Zhen, Kan, and Li'..."

Before she could finish, Xu Yunfan’s hammer seemed to fall lightly.

The hammer head cut into the texture of the赤焰岩. The Nine-Layered Wave force flowed from his tiger’s mouth into the rock layer, actually shaking out a seven-foot-long radial crack!

Yan Yuwei’s voice cut off abruptly, the hammer in her hand freezing in mid-air.

"You..."

The庚金 Qi seeping from the cracks was a铁青 color. This was the "Broken Jade Strength" that could only be triggered after one had入门 the Molten Gold Iron-Forging Technique!

"Is it like this?"

Yan Yuwei took a deep breath and said coldly, "You were already proficient in the Molten Gold Iron-Forging Technique? You came here to mock me?"

"I only obtained the core training method of your Molten Gold Hall yesterday."

Yan Yuwei’s breath hitched. She stared blankly at the hammer in her hand, doubting her life.

When she had practiced the Molten Gold Iron-Forging Technique, not to mention actually starting cultivation, just the preparation work took three years. She spent that time using medicinal baths and pills to adjust her body condition before spending three months to finally enter the gate.

Xu Yunfan spent half a night reading the technique and, upon training this morning, fully entered the gate with a single swing.

If this were told to others, it would sound like a fantasy.

After a long while, Yan Yuwei tore off the blood-soaked bandages, revealing the muscles on her forearm that were twisted like iron nets.

"Since you have already entered the gate, the next step is to establish the breathing stance."

"The breathing technique must synchronize with the vibration of the hammer! Listen well: when inhaling, sink the Qi to the Yongquan point; when exhaling, drive the force through the Laogong point!"

The moment she swung the hammer to demonstrate, a clang of metal rang out through the mine. The hammer tip plowed spiral patterns into the rock wall.

Xu Yunfan listened carefully to Yan Yuwei’s instruction, then closed his eyes and focused, sensing carefully.

In the silence, the dull roar of magma rushing deep within the earth’s veins came to his ears. The pungent scent of sulfur and rust filled his nose. The temperature of the hammer in his palm gradually synchronized with his heartbeat.

When the seventh breath resonated with the vibration of the rock layer, his eyes snapped open!

*Clang!*

The hammer struck down at a strange angle.

The玄铁 ore in front of him split into eight pieces with a sound, the cross-section smooth as a mirror. This was the sign of the third level of the Molten Gold Iron-Forging Technique, the "Splitting Gold Hand"!

Yan Yuwei was instantly dazed upon seeing this. She then watched as Xu Yunfan used the mechanism meteor hammer to挖下 the玄铁 ore as if it were tofu.

Her expression turned fierce. She stretched out her twisted arm, and with a sound of tearing cloth, Xu Yunfan turned around.

He saw a bare-chested man with a delicate face walking toward him.

*Whoa!*

Xu Yunfan stumbled back three steps, instinctively holding his hammer horizontally in front of his chest.

"What do you want?"

"Hmph!"

Yan Yuwei glanced at him with disdain and immediately swung her iron hammer, striking heavily at the玄铁 ore ahead.

*Clang!*

With the sound of metal clashing, the unhealed wounds on Yan Yuwei’s body suddenly burst open, splattering threads of blood.

"I am also the chief disciple of the Molten Gold Hall, and a famous genius in Cangzhou. I achieved the Three Great Accomplishments before the age of twenty and rose to fame in Cangzhou. My master sees me as the future successor of the Molten Gold Hall. How can I be willing to fall behind others!"

Watching her swing the iron hammer frantically, every tightening of her muscles caused them to contract like twisted ropes, the bulging blue veins wrapping around her body like green pythons.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath. Without a word, he swung his hammer, using the active blood Qi of the Molten Gold Iron-Forging Technique to draw in the庚金 Qi permeating from the ore veins and absorb it into his body.

*‘You continue to dig. You discover that your breathing rhythm matches the frequency of your hammer swings. Your Mining Proficiency increases.’*

*‘You immerse yourself in the rhythm of digging. Every swing of the hammer causes the blood Qi inside you to vibrate and resonate. The speed at which the庚金 Qi integrates with your flesh increases. Your Molten Gold Iron-Forging Technique Proficiency increases.’*

*‘...’*

*‘You continue to cultivate the Molten Gold Iron-Forging Technique. Through constant practice, you have partially completed the Heavenly Work Forging Technique.’*

Looking at the information prompts popping up in his vision, after a full day of Xu Yunfan’s screen being flooded with proficiency notifications, he finally put down the hammer, which was worn down by nearly half.

"Let's take a break?"

Yan Yuwei, who was beside him, her consciousness almost blurry and her body only moving mechanically to dig, heard Xu Yunfan’s words. Her body jerked to a halt, the iron hammer in her hand falling to the ground. She plopped down on the ground, gasping for breath.

Xu Yunfan glanced at her and lost interest immediately.

Yan Yuwei had trained her body until her muscles were twisted all over. Her feminine features on her chest had completely vanished, leaving only two solid, armor-like pectoral muscles that squeezed against each other with her movements.

It was unwatchable.

There was no sense of indecency, only the legend of a "Brotherly" figure.

As Xu Yunfan placed his hammer on the rack and prepared to leave, Yan Yuwei asked with a slightly hoarse voice.

"Where are you going next?"

"To the Heavenly Work Department. I am very interested in their 'Black Tortoise Carrying Mountain Strength'."

Yan Yuwei watched blankly as Xu Yunfan walked away with light steps, as if the day of digging had no effect on him at all.

She couldn't help but feel a wave of discouragement.

She had clearly reached her limit, yet the other party seemed to have plenty of energy to spare.

The gap between people is like that between a mayfly and the sky.

But...

A flame couldn't help but rise in Yan Yuwei’s heart.

She had to find a way to catch up and overtake him. Once she achieved the Great Accomplishment in Skin Tempering, she was confident that if she persisted at this intensity for another year, she would surely achieve success.

Returning to the Casting Hall’s base and eating a meal, Xu Yunfan looked at the large pendulum clock hanging on the dome of the Heavenly Work Fortress. The time displayed, converted to his previous life, was around eight in the evening.

It was exactly the time for the instructors of the Heavenly Work Department to teach their classes.

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate and walked quickly toward the Heavenly Work Department.

Now that the news of moving the sect had come from Zhan Yan, he naturally wanted to complete the incomplete Heavenly Work Forging Technique first, just in case an unexpected change occurred and he lost the time to learn it.

With the attribute panel, as long as he practiced the complete Heavenly Work Forging Technique, he could advance just by constantly grinding proficiency.
