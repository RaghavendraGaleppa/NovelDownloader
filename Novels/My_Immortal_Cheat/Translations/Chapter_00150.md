# Chapter 150: Sincere Apology!

Zhou Tian looked at the King of Gods with a hint of surprise. This old fellow was much calmer than he had imagined. The Zhou family had also made indelible contributions to the destruction of the God Realm. Not raging with fury, but at least he should have some reaction, right? After all, even his old lair was shattered. High cultivation doesn't mean a lack of emotion.

"Your old self doesn't feel like head-butting me?" Zhou Tian leaned his head forward and asked.

"I didn't, but now I do," the King of Gods said faintly, looking at Zhou Tian, who had leaned his head over. "Many things are not so simple when it comes to wars between worlds. Moreover, you are just a mortal, unable to influence the grand scheme of things. Why bother arguing with you?"

'Meaning, I'm just a little brother, not worth his attention,' Zhou Tian summarized.

"Your old self certainly takes things in stride," Zhou Tian said with a smile, sitting cross-legged in front of the King of Gods. The King of Gods' face darkened. He didn't know why this mortal in front of him had such audacity.

"Anyway, your old self's final scheme will fail, so why don't you tell me what you're planning?" Zhou Tian said after sitting down, feeling quite cool at the moment. The opportunity to sit and discuss with the enemy's big boss wasn't something that came around often.

Even this King, who had overseen countless gods, was defeated by Zhou Tian's peculiar thought process. 'You're so audacious, do your family know? My scheme will ultimately fail? How did you even come to that conclusion?'

"Although you are just a mortal, you are also a member of the Zhou family. You are barely qualified to speak with me. However, even if you ultimately fail, there are some things I cannot tell you." The King of Gods pondered for a moment, using the words he had just learned from Zhou Tian. He had been here for countless years and was incredibly lonely. Now, encountering an interesting mortal like Zhou Tian, he couldn't help but say a few more words.

"Even if you don't say it, I know. Isn't it just about recreating the King of Gods and then reshaping the God Realm?" Zhou Tian propped himself up with his hands behind him. Although it seemed like they were in the void, there was a solid barrier beneath his feet, like an air wall.

The King of Gods shook his head. "Mortal, you don't understand."

"What the hell?" Zhou Tian looked speechless. 'What do you mean I don't understand?'

Ignoring Zhou Tian's constipated expression, the King of Gods said with a slight sigh, "Even countless years ago, there were very few individuals who could converse with me face to face like this."

"So I should feel honored?"

"You indeed should feel honored."

"..." Zhou Tian wanted to retort, but looking at the King of Gods' serious expression, he understood that this old fellow truly wasn't trying to mock him; he genuinely believed it. This instantly extinguished Zhou Tian's desire to retaliate.

"How am I described in your ancient texts?" the King of Gods asked a strange question.

Zhou Tian was puzzled, wondering what was going on in this old fellow's head for him to suddenly ask this. After thinking for a moment, he replied, "It's not that I don't want to tell you, but I honestly haven't paid attention to the evaluations of your old self."

"That's quite disappointing to me." The King of Gods' eyes flickered, seemingly genuinely disappointed by this.

Then, the King of Gods suddenly looked up, gazing at the void above, his eyes gleaming with a certain light. A moment later, a strange smile appeared on his face, and he lowered his head to Zhou Tian, saying, "You are truly well-prepared, even bringing a damaged Heavenly Venerate-level supreme treasure."

"Your old self, please don't look at me like that. I'm just a small fry; the adults in my family don't tell me their plans," Zhou Tian waved his hand, then added, "However, since we've even brought a Heavenly Venerate-level supreme treasure, why don't you just surrender? I can guarantee that we won't kill you if you surrender. How does that sound?"

"Haha!" The King of Gods laughed loudly. "You little fellow are truly interesting, trying to persuade me to surrender. But don't celebrate too early. Don't jump to conclusions until the very last moment."

"Is that a lesson you learned from the Ancient War?" Zhou Tian's words carried a sting.

"You could say that." The King of Gods sobered his smile. "Back then, the Demon Lord and I schemed for a long time, but I still couldn't maintain my patience. If I had been able to endure, perhaps the world's structure wouldn't be like this."

"Demon Lord?" Zhou Tian searched his memory but found no impression of this name.

"You probably don't know. The Eight Realms... no, it should be the Nine Provinces now. They must have sealed off these messages."

"Oh?" Zhou Tian's spirits immediately lifted. It seemed there was some secret involved.

"You all call my world the God Realm, but that's not entirely accurate. My world is special; it's not just a single world. It's a unique world structure, what the so-called Star Realm calls a 'special world construct'. My God Realm is the dwelling of the gods, and there's another realm which you would call the Demon Realm, the dwelling of the demons."

"We are born from the faith of living beings, while they feed on the negative emotions of living beings. Before we discovered your world, we were constantly at war." The King of Gods' eyes were deep, as if reminiscing about ancient times. The scene in the void shifted, and grand, magnificent scenes appeared, seemingly battlefields between gods and demons, with gods radiating brilliant light and creatures of ugly forms.

"My realm's greatest reliance was its special world construct. The two worlds were actually one, but they had two beings bearing the will of the world. I had planned to reap the benefits as the fisherman, but in the end, it all fell apart."

Zhou Tian was somewhat surprised. He hadn't expected such a secret history from ancient times. But why were there no records about the Demon Realm now?

"Are you curious why the news of the Demon Realm was intentionally sealed off? It's not a big secret; there's no harm in telling you." The King of Gods kindly explained to Zhou Tian. It seemed he was terribly lonely and hungry for conversation upon seeing someone.

"After the Ancient War, basically all worlds were shattered. Rebuilding worlds isn't that simple. I suspect you must have used my realm, which had the most abundant world origin, as a cornerstone, then connected it to the other fragmented worlds. But the Demon Realm is special. It thrives on the resentment of living beings. With the massive populations of the major worlds, the Demon Realm would grow into a huge problem. So, the Demon Realm was sealed. To avoid trouble, even its very existence was kept secret from you." The King of Gods was probably genuinely starved for conversation after such a long time, explaining everything very clearly to Zhou Tian. Primarily, it was also because these messages were indeed not great secrets, and since Zhou Tian belonged to the Zhou family, he would know sooner or later.
