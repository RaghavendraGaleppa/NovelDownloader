# Chapter 45: Diverting Attention to Strike Elsewhere

The next morning, Yang Can rose early and had Xiao Tan help him wash up and rinse his face.

The events of the previous night seemed as if they had never happened.

Xiao Tan wasn't embarrassed, so naturally, neither was Yang Can.

Yang Can used a split willow twig dipped in green salt to brush his teeth, pondering that he needed to find an opportunity to invent a toothbrush. He had considered this idea before, but in this era, there were no patent laws, and the item had no real technical difficulty. The reason it hadn't appeared yet was simply that no one had thought of it. As long as he could make one, others would immediately learn how to copy it. However, if he had his own industry, things would be different. He could mass-produce and stockpile it in advance, flooding the market with it the moment it was released. By then, even if others copied it, he would have already earned his first bucket of gold. Furthermore, in the subsequent market competition, it would still hold a brand advantage. Therefore, this money-making method would not be made public until he possessed his own industry.

After washing up and changing his clothes, Yang Can went downstairs for breakfast.

In the hall, Li Damu and Xiao Qingmei had already arrived first.

As soon as Qingmei sat down, Sangzhi cast a meaningful gaze at her that lingered for a long time. Qingmei had left quite late last night. Because Qingmei knew roughly how long Yang Can would "折腾" (折腾 - usually means to toss about or cause trouble, but here it implies the duration of his intimate activities) for. This honest girl had timed it, estimating that it was about the same as usual before she left. It was already the middle of the night. Moreover, when she sat down, she was constantly on guard against Yang Can, her legs tense and ready to "leap" away at any moment. As a result, because the muscles in her legs were too tense, she even got a cramp while going downstairs.

How could Sangzhi and Xiao Tan not think something of this scene?

Qingmei also knew what Sangzhi's look meant, but there was no point in explaining; the more she tried to clear things up, the darker it looked. Helplessly, Qingmei could only sit there sullenly.

Just then, Yang Can walked down the stairs with Xiao Tan, looking completely at ease.

As soon as she saw the culprit, Qingmei's large eyes immediately gave him a fierce glare.

Yang Can raised his eyebrows at her in confusion.

This bastard is still playing dumb with me?

However, the way he raised his eyebrows was really handsome...

Ah,呸 (expression of disgust)!

Qingmei's gaze lingered in a daze for only a moment before she immediately broke through Yang Can's "handsome man trap."

*Stinky man, trying to seduce me with his looks. Do you think this young lady is such a shallow person?*

*It's just raising eyebrows, who cares?*

The breakfast ended with Sangzhi looking thoughtful, Qingmei pretending to be calm, Li Damu feeling quite puzzled, and Yang Can remaining completely unperturbed.

Just then, the village head, Lai Gulou, came to invite them, and Yang Can's group followed him out of the small courtyard.

This courtyard had good privacy, separated by high walls.

Entering the middle courtyard, they saw nearly thirty of the Zhang family's guards training on the drill ground. The iron-tipped spears shimmered with a cold light in the sunlight. These guards and servants were mostly descendants of mixed Han and Longshang Rong, Man, and Di ethnicities. Therefore, their physiques and appearances looked particularly sharp and capable. Naturally, Zhang Zhuangzhu selected the best martial arts masters for guards.

Over at Zhang Yunyi's side, the accountants, field supervisors, granary overseers, and tenant heads of Feng'an Manor had all arrived. Seeing Yang Can's group approaching, Zhang Yunyi quickly glanced at Xiao Qingmei, who was half a step behind Yang Can. She was indeed a delicate and clever young woman, her looks surpassing even Sangzhi and Xiao Tan. With her watching, Executive Yang couldn't possibly sneak around for some "fish" (affairs). His plan would need some adjustments. For example... creating an opportunity to catch them "in the act"? But he couldn't do that until the final moment of confrontation; he had to wait.

Today was Yang Can's first official day inspecting Feng'an Manor. Therefore, early in the morning, Zhuangzhu Zhang led a large entourage to accompany Yang Can's group for a comprehensive overview of Feng'an Manor. They looked at the division of the manor's fields, the construction of water conservancy, the supporting ditches and ponds for water storage, the management of the grain storage area, as well as the mills and the blacksmith shop for forging and repairing farm tools...

Zhuangzhu Zhang also gave a more detailed introduction to the population of the manor: free commoners who owned a small amount of land and had to pay grain and perform labor services for the manor; households of retainers who were civilians in peacetime and soldiers in wartime; and tenant farmers with no property who rented the manor's land. As for the commoners who fled here from the Central Plains or other warlord-ruled areas for various reasons, Zhuangzhu Zhang naturally didn't mention them at all. He took them in and sent them to reclaim wasteland, turning them into tenant farmers. These tenant farmers and the newly reclaimed land all belonged to Zhuangzhu Zhang, and the clan didn't know about them.

While Yang Can was touring around, a floating corpse quietly appeared in the "moat" of Feng'an Fortress. The man was thin and disheveled, and everyone in the village knew him: his name was Zhen Laoshi. Zhen Laoshi was a hardworking self-sufficient farmer. Father and son had spent several years, working from dawn to dusk, to reclaim ten acres of good farmland. Because his son had exhausted himself and fallen ill, he borrowed a usurious loan from Zhuangzhu Zhang, and the result was as expected. His fields eventually went to the Zhang family, his son died of illness, his daughter-in-law remarried, and Zhen Laoshi went mad. Now, the mad Zhen Laoshi had completely left this world.

By the end of the day, Yang Can had gained a direct understanding of the agricultural production, population management, tax payments, and village rules and customs here.

By the time they finished their inspection tour, it was already evening. Zhang Yunyi wanted to arrange a grand banquet for Yang Can again, but Yang Can politely declined.

"Zhuangzhu's kindness, Yang has received it in his heart. It's just that eating rich food every day is hard on the stomach. Let's keep it simple today, simple..."

Zhang Yunyi smiled slightly and agreed. Anyway, the man was in his manor; whatever Yang Can did, he couldn't escape his eyes.

After dinner, Xiao Tan and Sangzhi served tea. Yang Can dismissed them, leaving Li Damu and Qingmei behind. Yang Can adjusted the oil lamp in front of him to make it brighter, put the cover back on, and looked at Accountant Li and Xiao Qingmei.

"Friends, the purpose of our inspection of the newly received manors and properties is clear to you all. Today, with Zhuangzhu Zhang accompanying us, we have gained a basic understanding of the overall situation of Feng'an Manor. What should we do next? Do you two have any specific plans?"

Qingmei's heart stirred. Last night, she had heard Yang Can's plans, so why was he asking them for strategy today?

Li Damu perked up immediately upon hearing this.

"Second Executive, in my opinion, we should still go over their accounts."

Previously, the account books Yang Can obtained were submitted by Yu Huanhu. At the time, the Second Branch was responsible for these six manors. After the accounts of the six manors were summarized, they were reported to Yu Huanhu. Yu Huanhu then summarized the account books of all the fields under his responsibility and reported them to the Clan Lord. Yang Can had found some issues in Yu Huanhu's accounts. By comparing them with the general ledger from the Clan Lord's side, he had already discovered some problems with Feng'an Manor. However, Li Damu显然 (obviously) wasn't clear on this point yet.

Yang Can knew that even if Li Youcai had some partiality for Zhang Yunyi, he wouldn't take a huge risk for Zhuangzhu Zhang. Li Youcai wouldn't give Zhang Zhuangzhu a heads-up in advance, let alone tell Li Damu.

Li Damu was eager to prove his worth now. Executive Yang had received the beauty sent by Zhuangzhu Zhang to serve him; she must have served him in bed last night, right? Thinking of this, Accountant Li's heart itched. He wanted to enjoy the same treatment too. Especially that Xiao Tan, born as delicate and cute as a "fragrant fan pendant." This type was Li Damu's favorite; small and delicate, perfect for playing with. If he could persuade Executive Yang to make checking the accounts the focus of this inspection, wouldn't his importance as an accountant be highlighted? Then, for Zhuangzhu Zhang to curry favor with him, whatever Executive Yang got, he would get too!

Accountant Li said enthusiastically, "Executive Yang, as far as this old man knows, if a manor wants to deceive its lord and profit from both sides, it's nothing more than a few methods. As long as we scrutinize the accounts carefully, we will definitely find something. We can thoroughly check all the accounts of Feng'an Manor tomorrow. If they've done anything手脚 (tricks/shenanigans), they absolutely can't hide it from my eyes."

Qingmei listened and said dismissively, "Mr. Li, what if Feng'an Manor keeps two sets of accounts, one open and one secret?"

Accountant Li knew that among these great clans, the personal maids serving noble ladies were also trained from a young age. They were proficient in various household management knowledge and couldn't simply be treated as mere servant girls pouring tea and water. But, you only have a superficial understanding, how can you compare with a professional like me?

Li Damu stroked his beard and smiled. "Miss Qingmei, as long as they've done it, there can't be no traces at all? Checking the accounts is a necessary step!"

Li Damu gave Qingmei a couple of soft but sharp retorts, then turned back to Yang Can. "Executive Yang, the properties of Feng'an Manor have just been returned to the First Branch. It happened suddenly; even if they wanted to fake the accounts, they wouldn't have time. We just need to thoroughly check Feng'an Manor's field registers, lease contracts, and granary records for the past three years. If there are hidden fields, inflated expenses, or false grain storage flows, there will always be evidence left behind."

Yang Can smiled slightly and nodded. "Hmm, checking, of course, we must check."

Yang Can thought for a moment and added, "Mr. Li, you can't handle it all by yourself. You can pick some junior accountants from Feng'an Manor to assist you. Especially those who are older and have never been properly utilized here."

Accountant Li understood immediately upon hearing this and couldn't help but give a thumbs-up. "Brilliant, truly brilliant!"

"Haha, those people are frustrated and unfulfilled. Now that 'a new emperor has ascended, the court officials are new,' they might just have the courage to take a gamble and place a heavy bet."

Yang Can smiled. "Even if they don't dare to betray the Zhuangzhu openly, if they feel wronged, they might 'accidentally' slip a loophole to Mr. Li."

"Exactly, hahaha..."

Accountant Li rubbed his hands together, ready to put his skills to use. As for whether he could find anything, that would depend on whether Zhuangzhu Zhang's "gift" was in place. As long as the "meaning" was delivered, even if there really were problems, he could fail to find them. Failing to find them would just mean he lacked the skill or missed something; he couldn't be held accountable for that, right?

Qingmei blinked and asked, "What about me?"

Yang Can said, "The breakthrough point is with Mr. Li. As for us two, we'll go on daily patrols to attract Zhuangzhu Zhang's attention."

Li Damu clapped his hands in admiration. "Good idea. The Executive is in the open, this old man is in the shadows. With such a strategy of diverting attention, our great undertaking will succeed."

Qingmei cast a sidelong glance at Li Damu.

*With Yang Can, who is sharper than a monkey once you stick fur on him?*

*Tch! Who's really in the open and who's in the shadows between you two, that's still up for debate.*
