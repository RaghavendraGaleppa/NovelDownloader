# Chapter 112: Fusion of Dao Seeds

The next day.

The cave was suffused with shimmering five-colored radiance. Yet under Zhang Jing's control, the essence of the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud remained confined within the cave, its luminous glow never spilling beyond.

In fact, with the cloud's enhancement, Zhang Jing could now perfectly control every wisp of spiritual energy within his body. His aura had become perfectly harmonious—a seamless cycle without the slightest leak—making him appear as unremarkable as an ordinary stone.

Anyone passing by would sense nothing more than a common cave, perhaps even less noticeable than neighboring ones where faint spiritual fluctuations could still be detected.

"A major problem," Zhang Jing muttered to himself, his brow furrowing. "The Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud's effects are extraordinary, but it's far too conspicuous."

He glanced again at the five-colored glow filling the cave. He couldn't possibly continue cultivating in secrecy forever. Even now, activating the cloud made him uneasy.

He hadn't forgotten how the Infant Elder had been prevented by some unknown force when attempting to reveal information about the Nine Celestial Immortal inheritances within the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven. This suggested that beings from the Upper Realm might be observing or patrolling.

For now, Zhang Jing remained in the Eighth Void Heaven, relatively inconspicuous among the inner courtyards. The Upper Realm might not focus on him—or at least not for long. But he would eventually ascend to the Tenth Void Heaven.

What if he was discovered then?

Rapid cultivation progress could be excused as talent, but how would he explain the glaringly obvious auspicious cloud above his head? None of the cultivation methods he'd encountered could produce such an undeniably extraordinary phenomenon.

"Could I claim it's innate?" Zhang Jing pondered, skepticism flashing in his eyes. But who would believe that?

Yet he couldn't simply stop using it. From his current experience, the difference between cultivating with and without the five-colored cloud was night and day—utterly incomparable. Without its enhancement, obtaining the Celestial Immortal inheritance corresponding to the Pure Origin Absorption Contemplation Method would be nearly impossible.

"Perhaps in the future I can use the cloud without restraint," Zhang Jing mused. "But for now, as a mere Qi Refinement cultivator, I must remain extremely cautious."

After all, he knew nothing about the true nature of the Upper Realm.

Caution would serve him well.

Suddenly, inspiration struck.

Zhang Jing thought of the Mind's Eye Dao Seed. Could Dao Seeds merge? Or could the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed simply absorb the Mind's Eye Seed, thereby gaining its ability to manifest in illusion?

The more he considered it, the more plausible it seemed. In his understanding, Dao Seeds were formed when the mysterious jade talisman stripped away the principles embedded within skills and transformed them through some currently incomprehensible means. Essentially, they were interwoven constructs of various laws and principles.

Moreover, the Mind's Eye Seed primarily enhanced comprehension, cognition, and perception—abilities the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed also possessed. There was no reason they couldn't merge.

With a thought, Zhang Jing stirred his sea of consciousness into turmoil. He carefully guided the Mind's Eye Seed toward the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed. Each minuscule movement consumed tremendous mental energy, as if the seed's condensed patterns and principles weighed countless tons.

Gradually, exhaustion crept into his mind, but he persisted. As the two seeds drew closer, a subtle attraction formed between them.

This might work!

Time passed slowly.

Eventually, the tiny Mind's Eye Seed began merging into the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed.

Within his sea of consciousness, five-colored spiritual light erupted brilliantly.

Zhang Jing opened his eyes and immediately summoned the jade talisman. The Mind's Eye Seed had vanished, while the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed flickered faintly.

A stream of information entered his mind: the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed's grade had slightly improved.

Half an hour later, Zhang Jing opened his eyes again. The five-colored radiance that had filled the cave was gone, yet all the cloud's enhancing effects remained—even slightly stronger than before, particularly in boosting comprehension.

A satisfied smile touched Zhang Jing's lips.

With another thought, his perspective shifted. The Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud materialized above him, its five-colored glow now tinged with an illusory quality. Deep within the cloud, a cold, emotionless eye occasionally opened and closed, as if peering into the void.

"Dao Seeds can truly merge," Zhang Jing murmured, his eyes gleaming. "And merging them can elevate their grade. But can only similar seeds merge, or is any combination possible?"

This sudden insight had revealed a potential path to greatness. What lay beyond Supreme-Grade Dao Seeds? With the Time River Golden Sand, advancing skills to the Dao Seed stage wasn't a matter of time but simply resources.

"It seems I'll need to gather more Time River Golden Sand before leaving the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Void Heaven," Zhang Jing mused.

Soon, another thought occurred to him. With the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud enhancing his cognition, countless ideas flashed through his mind—most fleeting, but a few brilliant inspirations stood out.

*Ding—*

The Five Treasures Spiritual River materialized. Simultaneously, Zhang Jing channeled the Lunar Dragon-Viper Dao Intent over it.

Instantly, an enormous black serpent emerged, its massive form barely fitting within the cave even when only partially revealed.

"Too big, far too big," Zhang Jing muttered. "After all, it's not a true Lunar Viper."

The Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud blazed with light. In that moment, Zhang Jing gained complete control over the Lunar Dragon-Viper Dao Intent while holding the Five Treasures Spiritual River.

His mental energy drained rapidly with each breath. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead—an impossibility under normal circumstances, especially with the [Frail Viper Physique] enhancement, yet here it was.

Opposite him, the black viper shrank continuously—from dozens of zhang to ten, then several, until it was no longer than a chopstick. Yet its aura grew increasingly profound and oppressive, the sense of danger intensifying severalfold. The very air in the cave seemed to congeal.

Finally, everything stabilized.

Zhang Jing nodded in satisfaction as his gaze fell on the black bracelet now adorning his right wrist. With his limited grasp of Dao Intent, maintaining such a massive form had only dispersed its power. Before, when he couldn't fully control the intent, it hadn't mattered. But now, with the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud's aid, he could refine it properly.

Just then—

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, have you refined the treasure embryo?" Senior Brother Liu's voice came from outside the cave.
