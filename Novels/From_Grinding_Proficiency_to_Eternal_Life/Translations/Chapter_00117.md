# Chapter 117: Poaching

The bronze-skinned figure in the arena stood tall and imposing, the muscles on his shoulders and back resembling a range of stacked mountains. It was clear that he had perfected both Muscle Tempering and Skin Tempering, achieving the Golden Skin and Jade Meridians state!

"Perfected both Muscle and Skin Tempering!?"

In a corner of the arena, a middle-aged man muttered to himself, his face filled with shock. He truly hadn't expected such a figure to emerge from Yanbei Dao, let alone appear within their Heavenly Work Cave.

He suddenly recalled how Fu Jin had come by a few days ago to propose a marriage alliance and quickly lowered his head to look. He saw that Hong Siyang was also staring intently at the figure in the arena without blinking.

"Siyang, the other day, Master Fu from the Forging Hall came to propose a match for you. The young man in question is none other than Xu Yunfan in the arena. I initially declined on the grounds that you were still too young, but I think this matter is worth reconsidering."

Hearing her father's words, Hong Siyang's face flushed crimson with embarrassment and anger. "Dad, how have you become so snobbish? Now that you see his talent and aptitude, you want to go back on your word?"

"But I see that you seem quite taken with him too. I've been observing you these past few days, and his character seems..."

"Dad!!"

"...Alright, alright, I won't say anymore. I won't say anymore."

"My apologies."

The shockwave generated when Xu Yunfan retracted his hammer sent dust swirling into the air, momentarily making it seem as if clouds were flying about.

Watching Teng Lingchuan being supported back by Elder Yin of the Nine Luminaries Sect, Hong Baichuan said with a smile, "Someone come, quickly help Young Master Teng down to rest. Elder Yin, please don't be in such a hurry to leave. The Armory is about to open, and inside are two precious artifacts forged over these years."

The Heavenly Work Cave's Armory contained a vast number of weapons, all forged by the Forging Hall, the Mechanism Hall, and even the Melting Gold Hall, ranging from ordinary weapons to precious artifacts.

Precious artifacts were rarely seen for several years, and for the Heavenly Work Cave to bring out its hidden reserves was truly not easy.

Elder Yin felt tempted upon hearing this. He snorted, then instructed the somewhat dejected Teng Lingchuan, saying something like "victory and defeat are commonplace in warfare," and that once he reached the Master level in the future, Xu Yunfan might still be struggling with Blood Transformation. He mentioned how the resources of the Nine Luminaries Sect would be something Xu Yunfan could never hope to match in his lifetime. Only then did he have the Heavenly Work Cave disciples help Teng Lingchuan down to rest.

Then, with a flick of his sleeve, he sat down and fell silent.

Seeing this, Hong Baichuan finally relaxed. If Elder Yin of the Nine Luminaries Sect, Yin Hong, had left, how would he open the Armory? Who could compare to the Nine Luminaries Sect's wealth?

He had gone to great lengths, even getting Zhan Yan to invite the Nine Luminaries Sect over, precisely because he was counting on their status as a wealthy patron.

Thinking of this, Hong Baichuan couldn't help but resent Teng Lingchuan a little. Relying on his status as a true disciple of the Nine Luminaries Sect to act recklessly had almost scared off this big fish.

What followed was simple and clear; no one else stepped forward to stop him.

When Qi Huan, who had been defeated, saw that Xu Yunfan had perfected both Muscle and Skin Tempering, his unwilling expression also calmed down.

If Xu Yunfan had only perfected one, he might still have some lingering thoughts, but to perfect two was not just a difference in talent and aptitude.

Xu Yunfan had already leaped to another level, qualified to compete with the geniuses of the world's top sects. At least in the Three Tempering Martial Master realm, Xu Yunfan could deter many people with his hammer technique alone.

The Heavenly Work Cave producing a top-tier genius disciple who had perfected both Muscle and Skin Tempering sent waves crashing through the other seven sects of Cangzhou.

The remaining sects had no mood to dwell on how Xu Yunfan had passed the Quenching Trial; although their faces were tense, they couldn't hide the shock in their eyes.

The Heavenly Work Cave had produced a disciple who had perfected both Muscle and Skin Tempering.

The leaders of the various sects exchanged a knowing glance, each seeing the meaning in the other's eyes.

At least for the next hundred years, the Heavenly Work Cave would firmly hold the position as the leader of the Cangzhou martial arts sects.

The leader of the Red Crocodile Gang couldn't help but mutter a curse under his breath. "Damn it, why can't I find a disciple with such good talent?"

The leader of the Green Phoenix Sword Sect also pressed her thin lips together, her eyes dimming. She had worked painstakingly to grow the Green Phoenix Sword Sect to its current size, with over three thousand disciples, yet she couldn't find a true pillar to carry the sect.

Once she passed away in a hundred years, where would the Green Phoenix Sword Sect go?

In contrast, the Heavenly Work Cave was like a rising great fortress, majestic and imposing. Once she was gone, the Green Phoenix Sword Sect would likely be in peril; a slight carelessness could lead to a repeat of past mistakes, falling back to a fourth or fifth-rate sect, or even facing the danger of extinction.

For a time, the crowd was filled with complex emotions and varied thoughts.

Who knew if the incident in Wuzhou might happen in Cangzhou? With such a stabilizing force present, even the Great Zhou Imperial Court wouldn't dare act rashly.

For a moment, everyone's emotions were different, their minds filled with complex thoughts.

When Xu Yunfan walked out of the Quenching Trial and emerged from the Quenching Cave, he was greeted by Zhan Yan's expression of shock and joy, which even seemed a bit frightening.

Zhan Yan walked up to Xu Yunfan, his words somewhat difficult to get out. "Yunfan, would you be willing to become a true disciple of my Heavenly Work Cave's Forging Hall?"

"I am willing!"

Without the slightest hesitation, Xu Yunfan knelt on one knee and accepted the true disciple token offered by Zhan Yan with both hands.

Hong Baichuan, standing nearby, nodded repeatedly in approval, then turned and personally announced the completion of the True Disciple Ceremony observance.

"Gentlemen, the Heavenly Work Armory is now open. Please proceed to the Armory. If anyone wishes to purchase anything, feel free to bid!"

With this statement, the chaotic thoughts in everyone's hearts finally subsided for the moment. Martial artists walking the Jianghu all hoped to have a superior weapon by their side.

Although Xu Yunfan had perfected both Muscle and Skin Tempering, without that precious artifact, how could he have unleashed such destructive power exceeding his realm?

As the various sects followed the guiding Heavenly Work Cave disciples towards the Armory, Elder Yin Hong of the Nine Luminaries Sect finally rose leisurely. He slowly walked up to Xu Yunfan, a look of admiration on his face.

"Who would have thought that such a true dragon could emerge from the shallows of Cangzhou. It is truly a pleasant surprise."

Before Xu Yunfan could respond, Yin Hong said amicably, "Young Master Xu, my Nine Luminaries Sect is the leader of the sixteen states of Yanbei Dao, with abundant resources. If you join my sect, I can promise you on behalf of the Sect Master that I will immediately accept you as a true disciple. You may choose any spiritual elixir, divine skill, or treasure manual. Your clothing and food will be no less than that of a current prince.

In the future, if you have the opportunity, wielding a divine weapon and becoming a supreme Grandmaster of the Nine Realms of Qi Refining will not be difficult."

Standing to the side, Zhan Yan and Hong Baichuan heard this and looked displeased, silently cursing Yin Hong for disregarding etiquette. This old dog Yin was actually brazenly poaching someone right in front of them; it was truly excessive.

Xu Yunfan heard this and smiled calmly. "Thank you for your kindness, Elder Yin, but I have been in the Heavenly Work Cave for a long time. I am accustomed to every tree and grass here, and my temperament is more suited to cultivating in this small world. I'm afraid I wouldn't adapt well if I went to the Nine Luminaries Sect."

Seeing this, Yin Hong didn't insist further, merely smiling. "If Young Master Xu changes his mind in the future, the gates of the Nine Luminaries Sect are always open to you."

After speaking, he cupped his fists towards Hong Baichuan and Zhan Yan. "My apologies, friends. It's just that this old man truly cherishes talent and couldn't help but speak up. Please forgive me if I have offended you."
