# Chapter 180: Finding the Organization

The night was filled with twinkling stars, and moonlight spilled through the forest. 

The Sword Saint, Ma Yuanjue, stood facing the wind, his sleeves fluttering as he slowly caressed a three-foot-long green blade.

"I will demonstrate only once—my unique sword technique. Whether you can learn it depends entirely on your fortune. Only those with exceptional comprehension will have the qualifications to become my personal disciple."

Below, a group of demonic cultivators watched nervously. The moment that would determine their fate had arrived. Whoever stood out would have the hope of breaking through the siege of the righteous path under the leadership of this "Sword Saint" once he fully mastered his Nascent Soul and physical body.

The rest would be forced to stay behind and fight the righteous cultivators here while their cultivation was sealed. They would also have to face the endless pursuit of righteous forces and the various blockades gradually set up along the coastline and their escape routes as time passed.

It was practically an inescapable dead end.

However, among the crowd, one person stood out from the tense atmosphere, wearing a confident smile as if the spot as the personal disciple was already his for the taking.

This was Yin Wuming.

Originally a Golden Core guardian of the Blood River Hall, he had fought against the righteous path's Nascent Soul seed "Lei Yinzi" of the Purple Firmament Sect for years and was listed as one of the rising stars on both the righteous and demonic sides. His talent and brilliance were undeniably terrifying.

Though not as young as Lei Yinzi, his aptitude and comprehension were only slightly inferior. Moreover, with his Golden Core cultivation giving him an elevated perspective, his vision and combat experience would make mastering a sword technique created by a mere mortal martial artist effortless.

Sword Saint Ma swept his gaze indifferently across the surroundings before focusing on the blade in his hand. At this moment, his eyes held only his sword—his heart moved with the blade, man and sword as one. Within a short distance, he was invincible.

This was the realm of the Sword Saint.

"Clang~"

With a crisp ring of the sword, a gentle breeze suddenly rose in the forest. Leaves swirled and danced around the figure at the center of the clearing. In the darkness, a cold light flashed, mirroring the bright moon in the sky.

Sword Saint Ma moved like a swimming dragon, agile as a startled swan. His sword flickered like a white serpent spitting venom, hissing through the wind. His fluttering sleeves made it seem as though he might ride the wind at any moment, chasing clouds and stars to pluck the moon from the heavens.

As he danced with his sword, he simultaneously explained to the audience.

"The sword demands momentum like a gale, swift as lightning. Every move must be calculated precisely before execution, each action interlocking seamlessly, adapting to circumstances. By the time your enemy realizes something is amiss, they will already be trapped in your rhythm."

His sword moved faster and faster, like a silver dragon coiling and twisting through the air. Wherever the blade passed, the wind howled, and the rustling of leaves filled the air.

"Every sword aura must be used at critical moments—never wasted on mere probing, needlessly depleting your inner strength. Blind spots in vision, environmental camouflage, reflection angles of sunlight and moonlight, wind resistance or assistance—all must be utilized the instant the sword aura is unleashed."

As sword auras flew in all directions, towering trees around them collapsed one after another, clearing the view and revealing several moss-covered boulders.

"When delivering a decisive strike, conceal your intent. Feint east and strike west, avoid the strong and attack the weak. Build openly but advance covertly—only then can you achieve victory through surprise!"

A crescent moon-shaped blade of light suddenly shot from the tip of his sword, its shadow vanishing in an instant. Yet he himself flashed to the other side, slamming his sword against a large boulder, sending it flying precisely into the path of the sword aura.

"Thus, as the sword aura glides forward, swiftly close the distance. Use lightness techniques to adjust your position, forcing your opponent into the path of the sword aura—forming a triangular kill."

"Boom! ~~~"

The boulder was abruptly struck by the passing sword aura, shattering into countless fragments. The precision of the angle was impeccable—every moment and position perfectly aligned.

"This technique came to me when I broke through to the Innate Realm, my heart merging with the heavens and earth in sudden enlightenment. As it is my original creation, I named it—"

"The Ma Family Triangular Kill!"

"?!"
"?!"
"?!"

The audience was awestruck. Though the name was simple and straightforward, the hidden dominance and sharpness within, the ingenious conception—it was like a stroke of divine inspiration, leaving them in awe and admiration.

However, with their cultivation sealed and lacking spiritual sense or spiritual power, merely seeing, comprehending, and executing this technique was as difficult as scaling the heavens.

And... was this move even practical in real combat? It seemed a bit too flashy...

Sword Saint Ma sheathed his sword, calming his breath. His sharp gaze swept over them like a blade scraping flesh, making their skin prickle.

"My demonstration is complete. Now, I will impart a strand of sword aura to each of you. You have only this one chance. Whoever can successfully execute this technique will qualify as my personal disciple."

The demonic cultivators exchanged uneasy glances, hesitating with the sword aura in hand.

Without spiritual sense, relying solely on their eyes, the earlier demonstration had been a blur. Now, without spiritual power, their physical bodies couldn't perform such high-difficulty movements—angle adjustments, timing calculations, nimble footwork, balanced force distribution—it simply wasn't something mortals could achieve.

But there are always exceptions in this world.

Yin Wuming of the Blood River Hall was the first to step forward. Having already undergone the trial of the "Flawless Golden Body," his physical body was undoubtedly up to par. Combined with his Golden Core-level insight, he could roughly deduce the technique. His terrifying comprehension allowed him to grasp most of it in moments.

Lin Shan gritted his teeth and stepped forward second. He had also undergone "Stellar Force Tempering" through the illusory star disc of the Spiritual Treasure, so his physical body wasn't weak. Additionally, frequent use of "Illusion Spirit Liquid" had sharpened his vision, allowing him to clearly see the swordplay. His comprehension, nourished by "Heavenly Dew," also enabled him to understand and extrapolate.

Unexpectedly, a third contender emerged.

The Black Skeleton Monarch, using some unknown method, had dispersed the sword light across its skeletal frame, barely holding itself together. As a Hellworld Nascent Soul powerhouse, its vision was equally sharp and unique. As for comprehension—having undergone Heavenly Tribulation to reach Nascent Soul, it had long since tasted "Heavenly Dew."

Seeing even a skeleton monster daring to try, the others thought, why shouldn't they?

Immediately, they all stepped forward, desperate to stake their lives on this chance.

The righteous cultivators sat comfortably on the sidelines, watching the demonic cultivators struggle, enjoying the show from a safe distance.

...

Two hours later, all the demonic cultivators had taken their turn.

Unsurprisingly, Yin Wiming passed on his first attempt—worthy of someone who could rival the Nascent Soul seed "Lei Yinzi."

To everyone's astonishment, Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Monarch also passed!

While Lin Shan's success was somewhat surprising, given his prior performance as the "Martial Instructor," everyone knew his martial talent and comprehension were exceptional, so it was somewhat acceptable.

But the skeleton passing was completely unexpected.

The process was witnessed by all—it had indeed flawlessly replicated the sword technique. However, upon completion, its entire skeleton collapsed into a heap, its soul flame dimming significantly, likely having exhausted some hidden reserve.

Lin Shan was puzzled. Why was this guy trying so hard? If he succeeded, he could just take the skeleton along. As for the minions, once he escaped far enough, he could summon them. What was a skeleton monster competing for?

But the Black Skeleton Monarch had its own thoughts: If it succeeded, Lin Shan would have to beg for his life. Then, it could demand the innate spiritual treasure in exchange—an opportunity sent by heaven!

Aside from these three, everyone else failed. With only one attempt, there was no room for error. Dejected, they withdrew.

Sword Saint Ma looked at the two men and the bouncing skull before him, seemingly surprised to have encountered three "geniuses" at once.

He had originally intended to take only one disciple. Now, with two extras, it was unexpected.

But as a former chivalrous hero, free-spirited and unrestrained, he couldn't go back on his word. He declared plainly:

"I will take only one personal disciple. Each of you has the time it takes for one incense stick to burn to give me a reason to choose you. How you convince me is up to you."

Sword Saint Ma tossed the ball into their court, letting them handle it while retaining the final say, without revealing his criteria.

"This is too subjective!" Lin Shan lamented inwardly. How was he supposed to know what Sword Saint Ma liked? How could he possibly please him?

Meanwhile, the Black Skeleton Monarch's soul flame blazed fiercely as it rapidly analyzed Sword Saint Ma's every action since his appearance, constructing a profile of his personality and preferences.

"Got it! Clack clack clack~"

The skull rolled swiftly across the ground, picking up a book with its teeth before rolling back and placing it at Sword Saint Ma's feet.

"This junior has studied the Rites of Zhou since childhood and collected many spring palace paintings, with deep research into the subject. I would be honored to discuss them with you—"

"Smack!"

Sword Saint Ma slapped the skull aside, his expression indifferent, seemingly unimpressed. Instead, he scolded:

"Instead of focusing on the righteous path, you waste your time on vulgar pursuits. You are unworthy of being my disciple!"

Dizzy from the slap, the Black Skeleton Monarch was baffled. If he didn't like such things, why had he been so engrossed earlier?

Yin Wuming and Lin Shan broke into cold sweat. They had briefly considered the same approach but hadn't acted in time!

But their relief soon turned to joy—the skeleton had eliminated itself as a competitor, greatly increasing their chances.

Learning from this lesson, Yin Wuming stepped forward next.

"Senior, I have a treasure I wish to offer you. Please grant me a wisp of spiritual power to open my storage pouch."

Sword Saint Ma complied, unlocking the pouch for him.

Yin Wuming immediately retrieved a dark black sword. Neither metal nor wood, its blade was carved with intricate patterns, faint cries of ghosts and howls of wolves emanating from it. He presented it with both hands.

Sword Saint Ma examined it briefly before asking, "What is this sword called?"

"Demon Soul Sword—a mid-grade magic treasure with twenty-four spell restrictions. Forged with the blood of a thousand and the souls of ten thousand, tempered with two taels of Demon Marrow Crystal..."

This was the only sword-type magic treasure Yin Wuming carried. To secure this opportunity, he gritted his teeth and decided to part with it, elaborating on its power, the difficulty of its creation, and the resources invested to demonstrate his sincerity.

Sword Saint Ma's expression darkened with each word. Before Yin Wuming could finish, he returned the sword.

"A sword is a weapon for killing, not an evil artifact. Such a demonic weapon, tainted by countless vengeful spirits, would corrupt my sword intent and erode my sword heart, causing me to fall from my enlightened state. It is unacceptable."

Yin Wuming panicked, trying to salvage the situation. "Senior is right. This junior was thoughtless. I have other swords in my storage pouch, though they are only magic tools. Perhaps you'd like to see—"

Sword Saint Ma shook his head, producing several magic treasure swords from his own storage. Having inherited the legacy of the Guardian Dharma King and Lei Yinzi, he lacked nothing in blades.

"Enough. Unless it's a sentient sword, I have no interest."

Yin Wuming's heart sank. He could only hope Lin Shan had nothing better to offer.

Lin Shan, observing this, realized gifting a sword wouldn't work.

Though he possessed a magic treasure—the Severing Water Sword—it was a common item with only twelve spell restrictions, inferior to the inherited blades Sword Saint Ma already had. As for "sentient swords," those likely referred to spiritual treasures.

Lin Shan couldn't produce one either. Enhancing a "spiritual sword" required 64 points of ancient charm, and he only had 32. The enhancement panel didn't allow credit, leaving him helpless.

However, inspiration struck. He recalled an item he had obtained long ago, left unused in his possession.

Now, it was worth a desperate attempt.

"Senior, I also have something to offer. Please assist me in opening my storage space."

Sword Saint Ma complied.

Lin Shan rummaged briefly before retrieving a manual from a corner—a martial arts manual with four slightly faded characters on its cover.

"This is an innate sword technique I acquired in the Southern Border. It's said to be swift and bizarre, with unfathomable moves. However, mastering it requires a prerequisite..."

Lin Shan's voice trailed off, his expression odd, as if hesitating to mention something.

But Sword Saint Ma, upon seeing the manual's title, exclaimed in astonishment:

"The Evil-Slaying Sword Manual!"

Lin Shan was startled—the sudden outburst reminded him of the Nightingale Organization's dramatic flair.

"You know this technique?"

Sword Saint Ma's face lit up with joy. "Of course! Who in the Southern Border martial world hasn't heard of the Evil-Slaying Sword Manual?"

He took the manual from Lin Shan, unable to contain his excitement as he flipped through it, muttering:

"Ten years—ten years I spent as a Nightingale branch leader in the Southern Border, searching in vain for this legendary manual. It nearly became an obsession."

"And now, by sheer coincidence, it falls into my hands here and now. This is heaven's will!"

"What heaven grants, none may refuse. After all these years, my wish is finally fulfilled!"

"As they say, 'Beyond mountains and rivers, doubt gives way to hope; amidst willows and flowers, another village appears!'"

"Ahahahaha~"

...

Lin Shan was stunned. He had struck gold by accident—this manual, obtained from the Zhao family in Zangke County when he had them scour for antiques, had unexpectedly become his salvation today.

Wait—did he just hear "Nightingale" mentioned?

Was it the same "Nightingale" he knew?

Had he... found the organization?

Recalling the familiar dramatic flair, Lin Shan suddenly felt he might have just gained a powerful new backer thanks to his mortal identity.

Nightingale, was it? Well, if it isn't too much to say—

I happen to be an Honorary Elder of the Nightingale.
