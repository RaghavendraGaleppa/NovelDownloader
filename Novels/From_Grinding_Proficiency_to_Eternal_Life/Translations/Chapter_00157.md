# Chapter 157: Paying Respects to the Mountain

Daoist Guanshan brushed his lapels and bowed to Hong Baichuan, saying solemnly, "Back then, you took that palm strike for me. I have never forgotten this debt!"

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan understood instantly. No wonder the Skywork Cave had chosen to relocate to Lingnan Dao.

The Sect Master of the Xuanzhen Sect, having received such a great favor, naturally would not refuse this mutually beneficial matter. Moreover, there was genuine affection involved.

With the Skywork Cave settling here, they would naturally benefit, at least avoiding obstruction. Not to mention that today, Hong Baichuan had even brought a portion of the Skywork Cave's foundation with him.

A look of reminiscence crossed Hong Baichuan's face as he sighed, "Speaking of which, it has been nearly forty years since we parted, hasn't it?"

"Indeed, forty years," Guanshan replied.

"Forty years."

Hong Baichuan traced the dark red palm print scar at his waist. The sound of his knuckles tapping against the iron waist guard rang like metal, striking deeply into Daoist Guanshan's heart.

"Back in the Quicksand Eye of the Southern Desert, if you hadn't硬着头皮 taken that Vajra Palm from that old bald donkey, I would have truly fallen in."

"Haha, unfortunately for him, my Skywork Cave's body-refining technique is unrivaled in the North. Killing me was a bit beyond his capabilities."

Daoist Guanshan finally revealed a smile. The emotions that had dried up over the years seemed to bloom like an iron tree at this moment. He stepped forward and grabbed Hong Baichuan's wrist. "Please! I have long had a banquet prepared. Let us talk while we eat."

"Wait!"

Hong Baichuan broke free from Daoist Guanshan's grasp.

At this moment, the mountain wind swept through the ginkgo canopy, and golden leaves rustled down onto the seven cold blades.

Under Daoist Guanshan's surprised gaze, Hong Baichuan shook open his greatcoat and cupped his fist, announcing loudly, "The Skywork Cave wishes to borrow the Ghost Cry Abyss in Shu Province to re-establish our mountain gate. We have brought the 'Seven Luminaries of the Big Dipper Blades' as a gift to pay our respects. We hope the Xuanzhen Sect will grant us方便 (convenience/favor)."

Daoist Guanshan was stunned for a moment, then smiled bitterly. "You old bastard, you certainly know how to make a scene."

A smile appeared on Hong Baichuan's face.

"One thing is one thing. If we don't make it clear and leave it muddled, and our friendship fades in the future, it would be a taboo."

Daoist Guanshan lightly swept his horsetail whisk over the stone table, and the seven weapons "clanged" as they were sheathed into an iron box.

The old Daoist raised his frosty eyebrows, a smile appearing on his face as his voice rang out like an ancient bell.

"The Ghost Cry Abyss has had fierce winds raging for a hundred years. If your sect wishes to suppress the earth's evil energy, you will inevitably need to cast three hundred and sixty镇龙桩 (Dragon-Suppressing Piles). The Xuanzhen Sect still has seven thousand catties of Red Dragon Iron in its treasury. I will send disciples to deliver it tomorrow."

Rationally and emotionally, the Qingyue Xuanzhen Sect would not refuse. No sect would refuse a renowned weapon-forging sect settling within its sphere of influence.

Especially since Hong Baichuan had come bearing a supreme-grade treasure weapon to pay his respects.

Which sect would refuse that?

Daoist Guanshan spoke casually, but Xu Yunfan noticed that Su Zhenhe's fan paused.

The amount of玄钢 (mystic steel) needed for three hundred and sixty Dragon-Suppressing Piles was enough to forge three thousand sets of heavy armor.

The Xuanzhen Sect was offering seven thousand catties of Red Dragon Iron so casually. Although the Xuanzhen Sect didn't have much use for it, such a generous offer naturally made even Daoist Guanshan's eyes widen in surprise.

"Red Dragon Iron has a fierce nature; it needs to be quenched with South Sea Sediment," Hong Baichuan said, his expression unchanged. "Quite coincidentally, I collected ten ships of sediment from the Min River on my way here, which is just enough to refine it."

Daoist Guanshan pretended not to notice Daoist Guanshan's gaze and pointed his whisk towards the mountainside. "The banquet is ready. Please, Sect Master Hong."

Winding up the bluestone steps, Xu Yunfan walked with increasing amazement.

Flying eaves and bucket arches appeared and disappeared amidst the clouds. Just the Daoist temples on the nearby peaks were more magnificent than the entire Skywork Fortress.

Su Zhenhe, standing by, saw the look of surprise on Xu Yunfan's face and pointed at the mountains with his fan.

"The Xuanzhen Sect has nineteen peaks. Each peak has over a hundred true disciples and three thousand inner sect disciples. Cultivators of your age who have just entered the External Three Unions are common, but to be considered an inner sect disciple is quite an achievement."

Xu Yunfan naturally understood the implication in the other's words. Feigning ignorance, he asked with a look of curiosity, "Brother Su is also at the External Three Unions, yet you are considered a true disciple of your Sect Master. Why is that?"

Su Zhenhe's expression remained calm. He flicked his fan open, producing a crisp sound.

"I am different. My talent ranks first in the sect. I have only been cultivating for three years. If not for the sake of perfecting the External Three Unions, I would have already drawn blood energy into my劲 (intent), delved deep into flesh and blood, and stepped into the Muscle Refining Realm."

Xu Yunfan nodded in agreement upon hearing this. "Brother Su makes a valid point. Martial cultivation should be taken step by step, solid and steady. One must perfect each realm before moving to the next to reach greater heights. As the saying goes, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step; a nine-story tower is built from the ground up."

"Well said!"

Su Zhenhe's eyes shone. The more he pondered it, the more it seemed like a universal truth. He couldn't help but look at Xu Yunfan with a newfound sense of familiarity.

"Brother Xu possesses such profound knowledge to utter such earth-shattering truths. I am filled with admiration."

*Got it, a romantic!*

Xu Yunfan coughed dryly and waved his hand. "These words are not mine. I heard them in the past and thought they fit the occasion."

"Who might that be? Could you tell me? If I have the chance, I must pay them a special visit."

"...They are probably just a handful of yellow earth by now."

"Is that so? What a pity."

Before the words faded, a tiger's roar suddenly erupted from the mountain path.

Six bare-chested strongmen, heads bowed, rushed past carrying a bronze tripod. Inside the tripod, charcoal fire illuminated the half of a strange beast's leg bone, which was as thick as a beam and still twitching at the severed section.

"A wild boar from Bashan, freshly hunted yesterday," Su Zhenhe said casually. "This beast went mad and collapsed two side halls, but it provided the disciples with three days of meat. Since you are here today, you can try it. It is a strange beast specially raised within the mountain."

The banquet was set in the Star Plucking Pavilion.

The ceiling, made of deep wood, was inlaid with glowing pearls. As soon as Hong Baichuan and Xu Yunfan sat down, eight Daoist boys carrying a jade plate ten feet long filed in.

On the plate was a spiritual fish, its entire body赤金 (crimson gold). As its gills opened and closed, they brought forth scorching heat waves.

"The Red-Scaled Dragon Eye. It has been raised in the Qingyue Cold Pool for a full sixty years," Daoist Guanshan laughed. "Brother Hong, you have a good palate. Even I, an old Daoist, rarely get to eat this spiritual fish."

Su Zhenhe held his fingers together like a knife and lightly划 (slit) the fish's belly.

The snow-white flesh solidified instantly upon touching the air, the texture of the cross-section resembling patterns.

"Brother Xu, do you know that this fish bone can be used to temper a sword's edge?"

"Oh, oh, really? That is quite interesting!"

Xu Yunfan's mouth was stuffed full of fish meat, his cheeks bulging.

This spiritual fish had an excellent texture, leaving a lingering fragrance in the mouth. Shortly after swallowing it, large streams of warm currents rushed from his stomach into his four limbs and bones. Even the internal energy, refined by the Pure Yang One Qi Technique and dormant in his flesh, seemed to grow stronger.

Sensing the changes in his body, Xu Yunfan's eyes lit up, and he wished he could stuff the entire fish into his mouth.

*This spiritual fish contains the aura of primal spirit!*

The Xuanzhen Sect truly lives up to its reputation as a sect founded during the era when primal spirits had not yet dissipated. Even casually produced items within the sect were incredibly good.

Su Zhenhe: "..."

He could no longer hold back and quickly picked up a piece.

He had rarely eaten the Red-Scaled Dragon Eye himself.

After three rounds of wine and five rounds of dishes, Hong Baichuan, drunk from the Xuanzhen Sect's special brew 'Fairy's Fall,' draped his arm around Xu Yunfan's shoulder with bleary eyes.
