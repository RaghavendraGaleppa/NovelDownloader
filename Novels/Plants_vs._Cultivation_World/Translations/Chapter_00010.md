# Chapter 10: Perfect-Level Cleansing Technique

"Let's test the effects of the perfect-level Cleansing Technique."

The Cleansing Technique reached perfection faster than Gu Mo had anticipated. Adjusting his posture, he formed hand seals to cast the perfected version on himself. Though his mastery should have allowed instant casting without seals, this being his first attempt at the perfected level, Gu Mo opted for caution.

As the seals formed, spiritual energy within him began vibrating at a specific frequency. When this energy washed over his body, Gu Mo felt a sudden jolt—his bones and tendons trembled violently, followed by intense soreness as if being scrubbed relentlessly with a washboard.

"Damn, is something wrong?" Gritting his teeth against the pain, Gu Mo felt a pang of anxiety. The Cleansing Technique manual from the library only documented mastery-level, while perfection was his own theoretical extension.

The technique's purpose was purification—mastery added bodily maintenance. To surpass that, Gu Mo theorized cleansing internal organs, bones, and flesh through vibrational frequencies. After days of adjusting spiritual energy to find a harmless yet effective rhythm, he'd succeeded. But this overwhelming soreness was unexpected.

Fortunately, the pain soon faded—his current spiritual energy could only sustain the perfected technique briefly.

"Phew—"

As the effects ended, the soreness vanished, replaced by indescribable lightness. Inspecting himself, Gu Mo found his body coated in impurities.

"Marrow-Cleansing and Meridian-Tempering!"

This resembled the bodily purification cultivators underwent when advancing through Qi Refinement stages. Traditional Marrow-Cleansing used ambient spiritual energy, whereas Gu Mo's perfected technique achieved similar effects through internal vibrations.

The difference lay in potency—breakthrough-induced cleansing was more thorough. But Gu Mo's technique had no cultivation prerequisite. Undergoing Marrow-Cleansing before even reaching Qi Refinement meant greater future benefits.

The perfected technique could theoretically be cast on others—a potential goldmine. But with Fan Shaoming's case as precedent, recklessly exposing this ability was unwise. Moreover, a single perfected cleansing drained his spiritual energy entirely—he had none to spare for others.

Thus began Gu Mo's daily routine: self-cleansing to gradually temper his body. Meanwhile, the black mist in his spatial dimension receded under continuous solar essence. One day, a corner of an object emerged from the mist—sparking excitement.

Eager to uncover it, Gu Mo slowed cultivation to allocate more solar essence for mist dispersal. Another reason was prolonging his pre-Qi Refinement Marrow-Cleansing—the stronger his foundation, the greater his breakthrough rewards.

As time passed, the partially revealed object took shape: an vending machine. Through its exposed section, Gu Mo glimpsed his coveted Sunflower.

Acquiring a new Sunflower required 50 solar essence—50 days of halted cultivation. Though this would delay progress, the payoff was undeniable—two Sunflowers would double his daily solar essence income.

Subsequent Sunflowers would require only 25 days each. More Sunflowers meant faster accumulation and cultivation speed. The bottleneck was his lack of a spirit field—potted planting with buried spirit stones was a stopgap measure unsuitable for expansion.

Thus, obtaining a spirit field through becoming a Spirit Farmer in the Spiritual Plant Hall became imperative, requiring Qi Refinement cultivation first.

"Time to focus on strength." Gu Mo decided to pause mist dispersal, dedicating all solar essence to cultivation. The vending machine's obscured items would have to wait—without a spirit field, his solar essence reserves were insufficient anyway. Advancement took priority; exploration could resume post-breakthrough.
