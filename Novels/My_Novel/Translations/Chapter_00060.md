# Chapter 60: Strength and Martial Artists

The two characters for "Biluo" are taken from the Biluo River.
"Where the Biluo River is, I do not know."
"There are thousands of skills in the world. If one were to be strict about it, martial arts are also a type of skill. All roads lead to Rome. No matter what skill one practices, those who become outstanding and are revered by the masses as 'masters' must have transcended the skill itself."
"They integrate their own insights and understanding of the world and all things..."
"So-called martial arts are actually the understanding and insights of great martial artists into all things in the world. They just use martial arts as a medium to express them?"
Li Xian was in the stage of feeling his way forward like crossing a river by feeling the stones.
His thoughts wandered freely. He pondered over those martial artists who were praised as if they were divine.
The palm force of the Biluo Palm was insidious and vicious; Li Xian had seen it with his own eyes. But after he obtained the palm technique and read it through, he felt there were some discrepancies.
The palm force wasn't necessarily cold and sinister.
Instead, it had the vastness of a surging river, layer upon layer, with waves crashing endlessly.估计是夫人观江良久，见那江水日日如斯，永无尽头，才忽有感悟，创下此掌法。
Of course, this was just Li Xian's conjecture.
Martial arts, like scriptures, are a matter of interpretation.
A single martial art, practiced by different people, would have different manifestations.
"The Biluo Palm also requires medicinal baths for practice to be optimal."
"I don't have the conditions for that right now, so I'll just practice on my own."
The initial practice of the Biluo Palm was quite interesting. It required obtaining silk cords, specifically silkworm silk cords, as thin as hair, to be wound around the joints of the fingers, with small wind chimes hanging from the ends.
One had to try to channel the palm force through the thin cords into the small wind chimes. When the wind chimes rang one after another, forming a melody, it signified that the initial practice was complete.
Being able to do this meant one had achieved the state of controlling Qi at will, and had thus entered the doorway.
If one could not reach this level, one could never practice the Biluo Palm. Because the essence of the Biluo Palm is that at the moment a palm is struck, different palm energies are emitted from the palm center and the finger joints.
These palm energies mix, tangle, and twist into knots, like a lock being fastened.
Leaving indelible marks on a person's body.
This martial art was indeed insidious and vicious in its early stages, but the further one progressed, the more it became vast and mighty.
Like the water at its source, from an insignificant trickle, it slowly汇聚 into a rolling great river.
"Practicing martial arts... combined with one's state of mind at the time, seems to make it even harder to comprehend the martial art."
From today on, Li Xian began to immerse himself in the "Biluo Palm."
Besides his patrols, he practiced martial arts and did nothing else.
Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

[Biluo Palm]
[Proficiency: 11/800 Entry Level]
[Description: A trickle can become a river. Through diligent practice, you have glimpsed the doorway of the palm technique.]

"An entry-level palm technique is indeed different. Just reaching the entry level requires eight hundred proficiency points."
"Time to grind!"
Li Xian muttered to himself and thought no more of it.
At this stage, the practice method changed.
It was divided into two types of training: first, practicing palm forms, which are the routines used against enemies; second, practicing palm energy, which is the top priority of this palm technique.
Li Xian proceeded step by step, advancing both simultaneously.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]

Silently accumulating.
In a single day, the proficiency of the Biluo Palm increased by [152], showing clear progress. Of course, the Clear Breeze Leg was not neglected either, with its proficiency increasing by [174].

[Clear Breeze Leg]
[Proficiency: 719/1500 Minor Accomplishment]

The feeling of progress filled him with motivation.
"Accumulate strength, accumulate strength!"
Under the clear moonlight.
Li Xian, drenched in sweat, drew a bucket of icy well water. Splashing it over his face, the piercing cold took away the sweat and the fatigue.
After a short rest, he continued to practice the palm, practicing desperately.
The Biluo Palm truly lived up to being an entry-level martial art; the speed at which it accumulated internal Qi was far faster than arts like the Square Fist.
Moreover, the Qi was purer, and when condensing Qi into threads, it was harder to break.
All this progress was clearly visible.
These days of relentless, arduous practice were fulfilling, but there is no need to elaborate on them过多赘述.
In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.

"Master Li, your willingness to guide us is a great help."
At night.
On the large open ground outside the manor, under a bright moon and sparse stars, a bonfire burned on the ground. Eight or nine guards were continuously flattering Li Xian.
"It's not much of a help. I'm just doing what you pay me for," Li Xian said.
Li Xian's style of conduct had long been known among the guards. He was famous for being decisive and efficient, never dawdling or playing tricks.
At this time, the guard competition was approaching again. The guards needed to prepare for it internally. Many Class C guards hoped to be promoted again.
At the very least, they could keep their Class C status and avoid being demoted to Class D.
Thus, the tradition of "extra tutoring" emerged.
A group of seven or eight Class C guards with good relations would pool together three taels of silver. They would find a Class B guard to guide them in martial arts, identify their weaknesses, and make improvements.
But during the day, everyone was busy. So the extra tutoring was usually held at night, lasting about an hour.
Reporting it in advance was not considered a violation of the manor rules. This was also a kind of unwritten rule.
"Master Li, this is the money. We hope you will give us more guidance," said Class C guard Hao Xiaohuo, offering a cloth bag with both hands.
"I will guide you in whatever I can," Li Xian said, taking the money.
Another three taels of silver entered his account.
It had to be said, the higher one's standing, the more ways there were to make money. Sometimes, it wasn't that one went to find money, but that money came to find one.
"Who wants to go first?"
"Within the hour, I will guide all of you," Li Xian said readily.
"I'll go first!"
A tall and burly Class C guard stepped forward, cupped his fist, and said, "Master Li, I practice the Strength Training Art, a body-refining martial art, and the 'Pile-Root Leg'. Please show me the way."
Without further ado, he already attacked. His sturdy physique made everyone think: "If Master Li were to be defeated, that would be a huge joke."
The guard's leg strikes were fierce and indeed intimidating. But Li Xian sidestepped, and the tip of his foot lightly kicked the man's lower ribs.
All the strength in the burly man seemed to be drained away in an instant. With just one move, he was defeated.
"This move is the 'Breeze Tap' of the Clear Breeze Leg. It is the skill of striking acupoints with the foot," Li Xian explained.
Since he had taken the money, Li Xian would be responsible.
"You train the Strength Training Art to increase your power, and the Pile-Root Leg gives you a stable foundation. But you have enough ferocity, yet lack stability."
"Against a weaker opponent, your imposing manner can indeed intimidate them and secure a quick victory. But against a martial artist of the same level, you reveal a flaw right from the start."
The burly man broke out in a cold sweat.
Li Xian couldn't help but sigh softly. The martial arts attainments of many guards were actually not bad, but they just couldn't bring out the full power of their martial arts.
He didn't know why.
"Go and reflect on it well. Next," Li Xian said to the crowd.
After seeing what had just happened, everyone knew that Master Li truly had real skills. They were all eager to try.
The second guard was proficient in "Tiger and Leopard Hands" and "Clear Breeze Leg". The Tiger and Leopard Hands was a very treacherous martial art. If used well, it was extremely troublesome even if one was slightly weaker.
Combined with the Clear Breeze Leg, it could be said to be a very flexible combination.
But when the guard executed it, it was terrible. He used both hands and feet, thinking his attacks were continuous, but in reality, they were cumbersome and redundant.
For example, in the Clear Breeze Leg, there is a move called "Breeze Teases the Willow", which strikes the opponent's side waist. In the Tiger and Leopard Hands, there is a move called "Tiger and Leopard Twin Forms", which also strikes the opponent's side waist.
He executed them simultaneously, with both hands and feet striking the same spot.
This not only exposed a flaw but also made people laugh.
Li Xian kicked him on the butt and said, "You're too eager for success. Your top priority is to distinguish your hands and feet. Hands are hands, feet are feet."
These flaws were very obvious in Li Xian's eyes.
But these guards couldn't discover or correct them.
Just like that.
Li Xian, relying only on the "Clear Breeze Leg", made it so that these Class C guards could barely last two moves.
His guidance was more than sufficient.
After giving them all a lesson, Li Xian took a short rest, planning to go for another round to see if they had made any progress.
Suddenly, he heard a strange sound. Li Xian stopped his movements and looked solemnly into the distance.
He heard the sound of horse hooves treading on snow from the mountain path.
A woman, wearing a fox-fur coat and riding a horse, came forth under the moonlight.
"Hey, are you people from the manor?" the woman asked.
Li Xian's mind froze, and in an instant, a thought flashed through his mind:
"This is a martial artist from the Jianghu!"
