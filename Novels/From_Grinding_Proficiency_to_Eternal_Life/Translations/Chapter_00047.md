# Chapter 47: The Thirty-Six Forms of the Cloak Hammer

Hearing Lu Tiejiang's self-satisfied tone, Xu Yunfan paid it no mind.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's focused expression, Lu Tiejiang rubbed his nose and said, "This Red Chain Cloak Hammer is one of the Divine Weapon Ridge's ultimate techniques. Didn't you feel like you were forging iron when you first learned it?"

His callus-covered palm rubbed against the hammer handle, producing a rustling sound.

"Watch closely!"

Without waiting for Xu Yunfan's response, Lu Tiejiang let out a thunderous shout as he walked to the furnace.

In an instant, as Lu Tiejiang swung his hammer, his deltoids bulged like iron balls, and bronze-colored meridians writhed beneath his muscular arms like flood dragons.

Unfortunately, the force trajectory that should have connected from waist to back was broken in two by his slightly hunched spine.

The move "Rolling Back the Heavenly River," which should have drawn power from the heels, was forcibly modified by the old man into a path of shoulder blade counter-thrust.

The red-hot iron billet on the anvil suddenly twisted like a snake.

The gust of wind from the heavy hammer's descent stirred up the dust on the ground.

*Clang! Clang!*

A sudden sound of metal striking metal rang out, and sparks shot out in all directions.

Xu Yunfan's knuckles unconsciously tapped the heavy hammer wrapped in python sinew.

He could clearly see the cold sweat seeping from Lu Tiejiang's back, soaking his coarse cloth garment into a dark stain.

This move forcibly stimulated power beyond his physical limits; if he wasn't careful, he could easily injure his internal organs.

Lu Tiejiang forced his back straight, panting as he wiped the sweat from his temples. A strange light flickered in his sunken eye sockets as he raised his head with a hint of pride.

"How was it? I've practiced this hammer strike for thirty years to achieve this result. Back at Divine Weapon Ridge, even among my peers, my form..."

"Your technique is seasoned and masterful," Xu Yunfan suddenly interrupted, his gaze sweeping over the other's slightly trembling calf muscles. "It's just that this move should use the ground's force for rebound, yet you used your shoulder blades instead of your heels. Truly innovative."

As he spoke, he extended two fingers and lightly yet heavily划过 the still-warm anvil, leaving a fingerprint that matched the hammer imprint perfectly.

The blacksmith's murky pupils constricted sharply, and his palm covered in burn scars suddenly clenched the bellows lever. He kicked the apprentice pulling the bellows aside, sending him tumbling several times on the ground.

He then asked, "Which elder of Divine Weapon Ridge are you a disciple of?"

Xu Yunfall fell silent for a moment.

Seeing Xu Yunfan didn't answer, Lu Tiejiang didn't press further, merely nodding. "No need to be troubled. Since you have this connection, if you need anything in the future that I can help with, just ask."

After a long while, Xu Yunfan asked, "One thousand six hundred taels? Can you make it cheaper?"

Lu Tiejiang: "Business is business. Let's not discuss this."

"..."

An awkward silence fell over the scene, and Xu Yunfan didn't know how to admit it.

Before Xu Yunfan could speak again, Lu Tiejiang suddenly pushed the bellows hard. The furnace's blue-purple flames flared up, casting the wrinkles on his face like deep ravines.

"You have a sharp eye, kid. Do you know about the earthquake in Qingzhou thirty years ago..."

Before he could finish, Xu Yunfan had already picked up the瓮金 Hammer and turned, his long arms secretly exerting force.

As the hammer head cut through the air, the nine linked rings sounded like muffled thunder, crushing the old man's unfinished words within the heavy sound of its passage.

The icicles hanging from the eaves shattered with a rustle. Amidst the swirling ice crystals, Xu Yunfan's voice came.

"Lu Lao, I'll come back when I have time! And please help me make an iron case to store this weapon!"

"...I'll have someone deliver it to you in three days."

"Thanks!"

Watching Xu Yunfan's retreating figure carrying the heavy hammer, Lu Tiejiang smacked his lips, supported his waist, and suddenly sat down hard on the ground, his face pale and covered in cold sweat.

The apprentice beside him was shocked and hurriedly stepped forward.

"Master, what's wrong?!"

"Get lost!"

Lu Tiejiang cursed. "Do you think I'm going to die? Quickly invite Doctor Cui over, I've sprained my腰!"

"..."

Although Lu Tiejiang currently appears to be a straightforward and decent person, his true nature still requires further verification.

For now, he seems worth befriending.

On the way back, heavy snow fell like goose feathers. There wasn't a soul on the streets, yet Xu Yunfan felt his blood and energy boiling like water.

As the heavy hammer in his hand swayed, the vibrations seemed to sync with his heartbeat, and the blood energy of the Copper Body Technique began to circulate on its own.

A golden-copper hue surfaced on his skin, and every tendon pulsed beneath the surface, as if molten rock were surging through his blood vessels.

After returning to the Qinghe Residence, Xu Yunfan immediately picked up the瓮金 Hammer and stood in the courtyard, beginning to practice the Red Chain Cloak Hammer.

The sound of the heavy hammer tearing through the air shattered the courtyard's silence.

The moment the Thirty-Six Forms of the Cloak Hammer were unleashed, the accumulated snow was倒卷 into the air like a white dragon.

The vortex generated by the two-hundred-jin瓮金 Hammer's movements actually scraped deep cracks into the bark of an old tree three zhang away.

In an instant, his entire muscles swelled and bulged, his blood energy surged, and blue veins appeared on the surface of his body. The擂鼓瓮金 Hammer in his hand instantly tore through the air, exploding within the courtyard.

The Red Chain Cloak Hammer consisted of thirty-six forms, each stronger than the last. As the heavy hammer danced wildly, the air in the courtyard hummed and trembled, and the surrounding snow was倒卷 and lifted away.

A warrior at the Second Stage of Refining had nearly doubled his strength. The two-hundred-jin瓮金 Hammer in Xu Yunfan's hand felt like a wooden stick, churning the air as if it were a thick liquid, its momentum terrifyingly formidable.

With every swing, the nine linked rings on the heavy hammer sounded like crashing waves, and his falling sideburns were lifted by the sharp wind.

'You are freely施展 the Red Chain Cloak Hammer, feeling more exhilarated than ever before. Proficiency in Red Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer has increased.'

'You feel the擂鼓瓮金 Hammer in your hand is extremely suitable. Many moves you previously overlooked have been adjusted one by one. Proficiency in Red Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer has increased significantly.'

'...'

The moment the system prompts appeared, Xu Yunfan suddenly spun and swung the hammer. The heavy hammer landed like a cannonball on a nearby granite boulder, and the hard granite surface instantly crawled with spiderweb-like cracks.

After practicing for more than a dozen times in a row, feeling his limbs slightly sore, Xu Yunfan glanced at the system prompts that had appeared on his attribute panel.

He felt delighted in his heart. Having a suitable heavy weapon in hand indeed greatly improved training efficiency. Under the attribute panel, the Red Chain Copper Body Cloak Hammer wasn't just about profound hammer techniques; it also made his physique increasingly tough.

After dinner, when the moon was high in the sky, Xu Yunfan unfolded the "Surging Wave Palm" by candlelight.

Between the yellowed pages, beside Fei Yao's graceful small regular script, dark red annotations had appeared at some point: "The Tide Force travels through the Hand Shaoyang, must be combined with the waxing and waning of the moon phases."

His heart stirred. He stood up and suddenly pushed open the window lattice. He saw that on the courtyard's accumulated snow, moonlight flowed like liquid silver, seemingly aligning with the flow of blood energy in the palm technique.

"Interesting."

This Surging Wave Palm specializes in tempering the large tendons of the arms. When practiced to a profound level, upon交手 with someone, the snapping of the large tendons can generate several strands of force out of thin air.

He pressed his palms against the diagram and slowly practiced, the blood energy in his arms flowing slowly, gradually becoming active.

When the seventh form, "Splitting the Wave and Blocking the Current," was executed, a sharp pain suddenly shot through his palm, as if thousands of fine cow-hair needles were piercing his bone marrow along his meridians.

Xu Yunfan was delighted rather than startled. This was clearly the sign of "Force Penetrating the Tendons and Membranes" described in the Surging Wave Palm.
