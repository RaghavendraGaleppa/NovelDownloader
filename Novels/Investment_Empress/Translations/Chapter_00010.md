**Chapter 10: The Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method, Unity of Heaven and Man**

At the peak of Qunyu Peak.

"It seems Elder Qian had no intention of making my cheap master pay back her debts; she was just reminding her not to borrow anymore."

Li Mo's mouth twitched slightly as he looked at the furnishings on the peak.

A simple wooden hut, with some crumbling walls and ruins.

That was it.

If he didn't know this was within the Qingyuan Sect, he would have thought the place had just been attacked by a monstrous beast.

"Master, Master?"

Li Mo called out twice, but received no answer, so he pushed open the wooden door.

The room reeked of alcohol.

On the bed, a woman was sprawled out under a blanket, sleeping on her back, a hint of glistening drool faintly visible at the corner of her mouth.

"Master?"

"Mm..."

The woman grunted like a lazy pig, rolled over, and continued to sleep.

Li Mo had no choice but to lean close to her ear and whisper, "Elder Qian is here to collect debts..."

The effect was exceptional.

Shang Wu shot upright, but upon seeing Li Mo standing before her, her wary, drunken eyes turned to confusion: "Who are you?"

"I am your disciple," Li Mo said helplessly.

"Disciple... Oh, right, I remember now."

Shang Wu scratched her head, seemingly recalling, her apricot eyes still hazy: "What do you want?"

She was awake, but not fully.

Li Mo was silent for a moment, then said, "After I've entered the sect, shouldn't you... teach me something?"

"Sounds reasonable."

Shang Wu's fragrant shoulder was exposed, seemingly completely unaware of how ungraceful her current posture was.

She stood up, her palace dress askew, revealing half a shoulder. She was actually a bit taller than Li Mo.

"Yesterday, I was thinking of teaching you something."

"Without alcohol, my memory just isn't very good."

She frowned, looking slightly troubled.

No sooner had her words fallen than a 'pop' sound was heard – the uncorking of a wine bottle.

Shang Wu's nose twitched slightly, and she immediately listed the details as if they were family treasures: "Green Ant Brew? Specially made by Shili Slope Winery, needs to be aged for five years to achieve its amber color and be considered a fine product. A ten-year aged one is even rarer. Where did you get it?"

She took the wine jar from her unfortunate disciple's hand and drank deeply, the liquid tracing a stunning curve down her chest.

Your memory isn't so bad after all.

Li Mo couldn't bear to watch.

Shang Wu wiped her mouth and said, "I remember now. Yesterday, I made a bet with that old ghost Han He."

"How dare he say I can't teach disciples? How could I tolerate that?"

Li Mo: "..."

What he said seemed to be true.

Who would ever receive an account book upon becoming a disciple?

"He merely took on a Murong Xiao, and he dares to flaunt it before me? Bah!"

"So, I made a bet with him."

"If Qunyu Peak's disciple ranks higher in the next Nine Peaks Martial Competition, he'll help me clear the Internal Affairs Hall's accounts."

"And if you lose?"

"Lose? As my disciple, shouldn't you have some confidence?"

With that, Shang Wu turned around, rummaged through a box, and pulled out a booklet.

She said with full confidence, "This is my unique cultivation method. I'll guide you through its initiation today."

Li Mo took the booklet and saw the name of the method:

*The Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method*

It sounded quite impressive.

Besides, even the system had evaluated Shang Wu's strength as extremely powerful.

Hmm, so many debts must have been accumulated through sheer skill.

To owe the Internal Affairs Hall so much, and Elder Qian could only tactfully remind her not to borrow anymore—that really said something!

Li Mo's heart settled slightly as he opened the booklet.

After reading it, he asked, "Master, there was something I didn't quite understand just now..."

"Hoo... hoo..."

"Master?"

Li Mo looked up.

He found his carefree beauty of a master had fallen asleep again at some point, the wine jar completely empty.

She was thoroughly drunk, unresponsive even when pushed.

Sister, can you please be more reliable!

"..."

Just as Li Mo's face was covered in black lines.

[Investment successful. Investment: One jar of Ten-Year Aged Green Ant Brew.]
[Reward Settlement in Progress...]
[Congratulations, Host, reward: Ten Years of Martial Dao Comprehension!]

[Ten Years of Martial Dao Comprehension]: "Can be used on any martial art, increasing the Host's mastery of it by ten years."

Hmm?

Ten years of Martial Dao Comprehension?

The stages of mastery for a martial art are divided into six realms: Initiation, Preliminary Proficiency, Minor Accomplishment, Major Accomplishment, Perfection, and Transcendent Realm.

Even for common, low-grade martial arts in the jianghu, very few can reach Perfection.

Let alone the Transcendent Realm.

For example, his father, Li Dalong, had practiced his Wind-Catching Palm for nearly twenty years and only barely reached Major Accomplishment.

Of course, this was also related to individual comprehension.

"Though not blessed with extraordinary insight, I can at least be considered clever."

Li Mo simply walked out of the room and sat cross-legged on the ground.

Thinking thus.

He poured all ten years of Martial Dao Comprehension into *The Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method*.

[Ten Years of Martial Dao Comprehension injected successfully.]
[Year One: You thoroughly understood every word and phrase in *The Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method* and began experimenting. You successfully achieved Initiation.]
[Year Three: You seemed to gain some insight, discovering the knack of this cultivation method, and reached Preliminary Proficiency.]
[Year Nine: Your *Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method* became increasingly proficient, reaching the Minor Accomplishment realm.]
[Year Ten: You seemed to touch a bottleneck, but your accumulation was ultimately insufficient.]

Instantly.

Countless images surged into Li Mo's mind. It was as if he had truly meticulously studied *The Fire Heart Lotus Birth Method* for ten years, and had already practiced it to the Minor Accomplishment realm.

"Hoo..."

"Ten years, Minor Accomplishment."

That sudden feeling of enlightenment gave Li Mo a wondrous sensation of soaring into the clouds.

He couldn't wait and began his first cultivation session.

Within his Dantian, a wisp of warmth rose...

And the surrounding grass and trees stirred without any wind.

"For the first cultivation, success means completing the Meridian Opening."

Li Mo calmed his mind.

Inside the room.

The drunk Shang Wu suddenly furrowed her brows.

She mumbled, "Unity of Heaven and Man?"

"Who's gotten such good luck..."

Meanwhile, on the other side.

Qingyuan Main Peak, Cultivation Hall.

Several elders stood nearby, each seeing the astonishment in the other's eyes.

What surprised them so much was the young girl sitting not far away, in the "five hearts facing heaven" posture.

At this moment.

These old men, whose combined ages easily exceeded five hundred, were all doubting their lives.

Doubting whether their first half of life had been lived in vain.

"Initiation in one day?"

Xue Jing murmured in disbelief.

"To be precise, it was a quarter of an hour."

Qian Bufan corrected him, filled with emotion, then turned to ask, "Han He, you also practiced the Point Frost Seeking Origin; how long did it take you back then?"

Han He's mouth twitched. After a long silence, he replied, "One month."

Han He was still very young at the time, also a newly initiated disciple of the Qingyuan Sect.

He still remembered his master's joyful praise, calling him a genius, when he had initiated the cultivation method and successfully opened his meridians in one month.

Compared to the little girl in front of them...

As the elders spoke, the hot air they exhaled instantly turned into ice crystals.

"Indeed, new talents emerge from generation to generation. Our Qingyuan Sect is poised for a great resurgence," Xue Jing solemnly exclaimed.

His perception was extremely sharp.

When Ying Bing cultivated, an endless stream of Yin energy seemed to pour forth from within her body.

Even as the owner of this power, she would inevitably suffer injuries from it.

Taking Yang-natured medicinal herbs or pills could somewhat counteract it.

It seemed that the bottle of Pure Yang Pills he had sold to Li Mo a few days ago had helped this young girl open her meridians.

*Chii—*

A soft sound.

A cold wind seemed to form a vortex with Ying Bing at its center.

"She... she's opened a meridian!"

Han He's eyes widened.

He clearly sensed that Ying Bing's first main meridian was already clear and unobstructed.

"Like this, wouldn't she be able to open all twelve meridians in just a few days?"

That statement was only half-right.

Ying Bing could indeed open all twelve meridians within a few days.

But, she intended to open far more than twelve.

The elders of the Qingyuan Sect, after all, had limited horizons.

The human body was like a hidden treasure trove; there were far more than twelve main meridians.

Of course, ordinary Qi-Blood Realm martial artists, even if they knew of their existence, couldn't open them. That required extremely skilled and subtle control.

But for her, it was not a problem.

What Ying Bing wanted to do was open twenty-four meridians, forming a great internal circulation within her body.

Then, when she entered the Internal Breath Realm, she would be more than ten times stronger!

"Such a monstrous talent... we were merely drawing legs on a snake," Xue Jing said with a wry smile.

The Sect Master was busy with affairs, so he specifically assigned the three of them to guide Ying Bing, answer her questions, and prevent errors due to one person's teaching habits.

Now it seemed unnecessary.

Watching Ying Bing cultivate, they felt like their entire beings were full of flaws.

"I'll leave this to you; I'm going to Qunyu Peak."

"What are you going there for? Bad luck."

At the mention of that name, Elder Han He snorted coldly.

"Do you really trust Shang Wu to teach a disciple?" Xue Jing tugged at his Hundred Patches Robe.

Qian Bufan took a deep breath: "Junior Brother Xue, hurry. If you're late, I'm afraid it might be too late."
