# Chapter 115: The Perks of a Major Sect  

After all official matters were concluded, the atmosphere in the grand hall began to relax.  

The Golden Core protectors of the local faction, realizing they couldn't defy the overwhelming power of the leadership, reluctantly submitted to the new management—at least for the time being. Whether they had truly accepted their fate in their hearts remained unknown.  

The Sect Master, seemingly apologetic, comforted them while allowing them to listen in on recent developments. The other Golden Core protectors began discussing the current situation with the Sect Master.  

"Three-quarters of the Eastern Sea's territory is now under the control of our three sects. We estimate it will take another six months to fully stabilize the region."  

"During this campaign, the three sects have recruited over 50,000 rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea, mostly at the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages."  

"Our Black Lotus Sect has been assigned the central war zone, overseeing more than 2,200 islands of varying sizes."  

"The only rogue Nascent Soul cultivator in the Eastern Sea, the Pure Lotus Hermit, declared half a year ago that he would not oppose the three demonic sects. The headquarters has decided to leave him be."  

"Scattered resistance forces have mostly been eradicated. A few fugitives, such as the Old Ghost of Huishan, the Three Freaks of Zhangtai, and the Turtle Sage, are still at large, and joint efforts are underway to hunt them down."  

"Our allies in the northern and southern regions of the Great Song Dynasty have already engaged the righteous sects in battle."  

"Two years ago, our Dharma Protector clashed with a Nascent Soul True Monarch from the Violet Sky Sect at Turtle Catching Island and has been missing ever since."  

"Reinforcements are expected to arrive within a year. We anticipate launching an offensive into the Great Song's heartland by next year."  

...  

As the Golden Core protectors on the platform discussed the current state of affairs—mostly for the benefit of the newly arrived local faction—Lin Shan and the others standing below gained a clear understanding of the situation.  

Lin Shan was particularly surprised to hear that the Turtle Sage of Turtle Catching Island had not only survived the ambush two years prior but was still alive and well. He couldn't help but marvel at the resilience of this veteran Golden Core cultivator of the Eastern Sea, who, despite being over 400 years old, was still managing to evade capture.  

He was also astonished to learn that there was a rogue Nascent Soul cultivator in the Eastern Sea—the Pure Lotus Hermit. The name alone suggested a natural opposition to the Black Lotus Sect. Yet, the sect's Nascent Soul Dharma Protectors had seemingly chosen to tolerate his presence.  

...  

After lengthy discussions, the protectors began assigning tasks to the lower-ranking disciples. Several protectors led hundreds of disciples out of the main hall to a temporary administrative building, where they distributed Black Lotus Sect identity tokens, cave residence permits, and a storage pouch to each disciple.  

Lin Shan inspected his identity token carefully and found it was newly minted, embedded with his blood essence and spiritual aura to ensure it was uniquely tied to him. Unlike the Nightingale tokens, which relied on ancient recognition methods, this one lacked any historical charm.  

The storage pouch, however, contained a wealth of resources:  

- A standard high-grade flying sword, a basic perk for Foundation Establishment disciples of a major demonic sect.  
- A bottle of twelve emerald-green pills for Foundation Establishment cultivation, each exuding a faint herbal fragrance.  
- 1,800 spirit stones.  
- A demonic cultivation manual for the Foundation Establishment stage.  
- A dust-repelling robe.  
- A stack of sect-exclusive communication talismans.  
- A handbook of sect rules.  

Everything was transparent and fair, with no hidden deductions or additional fees.  

"Foundation Establishment envoys receive a monthly stipend of 150 spirit stones, totaling 1,800 per year."  

"One bottle of twelve cultivation pills annually."  

"The demonic cultivation manual is optional, but it must not be shared outside the sect."  

"Divine abilities, magic treasures, and rare materials must be exchanged using contribution points."  

"Please confirm receipt with a spiritual imprint after verification."  

The administrators meticulously distributed the annual resources, reminding the disciples to familiarize themselves with the sect rules before departing.  

"Salaries are paid a year in advance? That's a pleasant surprise!"  

Lin Shan, holding his storage pouch in one hand and his cave permit in the other, made his way to the mountainside. His temporary cave residence, though newly excavated, was already equipped with a spirit-gathering formation. The spiritual energy inside was comparable to the most expensive caves in Yi River.  

"This is the treatment of a major sect? I'm sold!"  

Lin Shan couldn't help but marvel. Even a demonic sect offered such generous benefits. He wondered how his sworn brother Lin Fan was faring in the Violet Sky Sect.  

For now, he was content with his current situation. As a Pure Altar Envoy, he could slack off for a year and then rest for nineteen. He had a free cave residence, a stipend higher than Yi River's auction house, annual cultivation pills, and the opportunity to exchange contribution points for rare treasures, divine abilities, and magic treasures in the sect's treasury.  

Back in Yi River, he couldn't even purchase Foundation Establishment cultivation pills—they were simply unavailable on the market. But in a major sect, once you reached Foundation Establishment, they provided everything you needed: cultivation manuals, pills, and magic tools.  

Recalling his previous struggles—scrimping and saving for every purchase—Lin Shan truly understood the meaning of "it's easier to relax under the shade of a big tree." No wonder sect disciples worked so diligently to expand their influence. With perks like these, who would want to leave and become a rogue cultivator?  

"As long as I don't steal the ancient aura from the Buddha statues, staying here and cultivating peacefully doesn't seem so bad," Lin Shan mused.  

But then again, when a naked beauty lies before you, offering herself freely, could you resist?  

...  

Lin Shan scratched his head in frustration. He still didn't understand why the Black Lotus Sect had been so fervently collecting faith and incense offerings for a thousand years. Who were they for? How were they used?  

The Sect Master's stern warning in the grand hall was still fresh in his mind—faith and incense offerings were the sect's top priority. Among the three demonic sects that had traveled millions of miles across over a dozen nations to return to the Great Song, the Black Lotus Sect was undoubtedly focused on seizing territory and converting followers.  

"I'll figure it out later. Maybe I'll stumble upon a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."  

For now, Lin Shan settled in and began refining his new high-grade flying sword.  

**[Black Iron Sword]**  
- Grade: High-grade magic tool  
- Description: Forged from third-grade black iron, inscribed with three advanced runes: Sharpness, Armor-Piercing, and Durability.  
- Enhancement cost: 32 points  

This sword was of standard quality, similar to his previous Cold Iron Sword with its three runes. However, the black iron material was inherently tougher, far surpassing the mid-grade cold iron.  

Next, he examined the demonic cultivation manual. Unlike typical demonic techniques that relied on demonic energy, blood essence, or ghostly energy, this one cultivated a form of dark spiritual energy.  

Lin Shan, still relatively new to the cultivation world, had never heard of a dark spiritual root. But this manual didn't require any specific aptitude—any spiritual root could cultivate it, producing dark spiritual energy.  

The technique wasn't particularly powerful, but its energy was insidious and difficult to expel once it entered an opponent's body. It was a demonic method that neither drained one's potential nor relied on bloody cruelty, suggesting the Black Lotus Sect was relatively moderate among demonic factions.  

After all, the sect's primary focus was spreading its faith and harvesting incense offerings. Beyond expanding its follower base, it didn't seem excessively violent.  

The claim that the Black Lotus Sect had bloodily sacrificed the ancient kingdom of Yelang a thousand years ago, as mentioned by Thunderclap in the Southern Border's ancient tomb, didn't hold water. The sect, though demonic, prioritized protecting mortals to sustain its faith—massacring cities and nations would be counterproductive.  

Lin Shan then examined one of the emerald pills with his enhancement panel to check for hidden mechanisms.  

**[Biluo Pill]**  
- Grade: Foundation Establishment pill  
- Description: Enhances Foundation Establishment cultivation. Mild in potency, crafted primarily from millennium-old Biluo Grass. Recommended usage interval: at least ten days to avoid drastically increasing resistance.  
- Enhancement cost: 32 points  

Satisfied that it was safe, Lin Shan swallowed one.  

After refining it, he found it equivalent to half a month of arduous cultivation. Twelve pills a year meant an extra six months of progress compared to ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

"Disciples of major sects are terrifying."  

No wonder major sects produced so many formidable experts. These pills would spark fierce competition if released to the public, yet here they were, handed out as basic benefits.  

However, such pills couldn't be consumed in quick succession. The body needed time to "digest" them, or else "Dao marks"—a form of resistance—would accumulate. While these marks could fade over time, excessive consumption would eventually diminish the pills' efficacy.  

But that was a concern for the distant future. As long as one wasn't impatient, cultivation could progress steadily.  

Accumulating spiritual energy wasn't the hard part—time was. The real challenge lay in breaking through the bottlenecks between cultivation stages.  

...  

Lin Shan then visited the sect's treasure exchange hall, only to find it nearly empty, hastily set up for the time being. The main treasury was still far to the north in the State of Lu and wouldn't be relocated unless the Great Song campaign was decisively won.  

After about half a month of leisure, orders arrived: all Black Lotus Envoys were to prioritize their wartime assignments without delay.  

As a Pure Altar Envoy, Lin Shan was assigned a hundred Qi Refining disciples and dispatched to a remote region of the Eastern Sea, bordering the outer sea. His jurisdiction spanned roughly ten thousand square miles, encompassing fifty islands with a combined population of hundreds of thousands.  

His mission was to establish the Black Lotus Sect's faith across these islands within a year, turning them into a base for incense offerings.  

Lin Shan accepted the task without complaint. The sect had already provided a year's worth of benefits upfront—it was only fair to deliver results.  

He first paid a visit to his direct superior, Protector Yan Yuanchun, who advised him to perform well to avoid giving the Lu faction any pretext for criticism. The local and Lu factions were currently at odds, their conflicts simmering beneath the surface.  

The Sect Master understood that integrating the local faction would take time, hence assigning them to remote regions for gradual assimilation.  

Lin Shan nodded in agreement, gathered his belongings, and headed down the mountain to assemble his hundred-man team. Managing fifty islands single-handedly was impossible—he needed subordinates to handle the groundwork while he oversaw the operation.  

At the foot of the mountain, a sprawling plaza was packed with over ten thousand cultivators. Lin Shan was to select a hundred from this crowd.  

But what he saw left him stunned.  

The remaining candidates were a motley crew of Qi Refining cultivators—ragged clothes, broken magic tools, and disheveled appearances reminiscent of beggars. Worse, most were only at the early or middle stages of Qi Refining, with few at the late stage. The more competent disciples had already been picked by earlier Foundation Establishment envoys.  

Faced with this ragtag group of "leftovers," Lin Shan wasn't sure whether they were supposed to work for him or if he was expected to babysit them.  

Upon inquiry, he learned these were recently recruited rogue cultivators from the Eastern Sea.  

Spotting a new "boss" from the Black Lotus Sect, they eagerly clamored for attention:  

"Work! Work!"  

"Pick me! Pick me!"  

"Senior, I'm hardworking!"  

"I can endure hardship!"  

"This humble one offers his rear!"  

"I can play the flute!"
