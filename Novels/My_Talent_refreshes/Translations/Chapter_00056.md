# Chapter 56: Desperation Breeds Evil

Returning to his residence, a faint smile appeared on Chu Ning's face.  

Although he had thought his performance today was somewhat too conspicuous, he couldn't help but feel genuinely happy about successfully advancing to the C District.  

He wasn't sure how the sect would organize the various skill teachings that Mu Ling had mentioned, but at least as a C District disciple, he now had hope.  

If he could truly learn talisman-making, with his innate talent as a Talisman Source Spirit Body, the income he could earn would far surpass what he made from crafting talisman paper.  

While innate talents were undoubtedly important for cultivators, resources were equally crucial.  

Just as Chu Ning was feeling excited, faint voices of conversation drifted from a nearby courtyard. His enthusiasm waned slightly, replaced by a frown.  

Truthfully, what concerned him most after today's promotion wasn't the attention he had drawn—after all, such things would likely be forgotten over time.  

What truly unsettled him was that Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang had both successfully advanced as well.  

If the C District assigned residences or spirit fields, he wasn't sure if he would end up too close to those two.  

Ever since suspecting they might have connections to Qi Chongmao, Chu Ning had grown wary of interacting with them.  

"It's a pity the C District isn't under Zhuang Yunde's jurisdiction. Otherwise, I could have asked him to arrange things before he leaves the sect."  

Chu Ning felt a tinge of melancholy.  

He wondered if life in the C District would be as convenient without Zhuang Yunde around.  

Despite his melancholy, Chu Ning quickly adjusted his mindset and resumed his daily cultivation.  

That night, after practicing the Evergreen Wood Technique, he sat cross-legged on his bed and began cultivating his Divine Refinement Art.  

The Divine Refinement Art wasn't solely about strengthening divine sense—it also contained techniques for its application.  

Beyond advanced divine sense attacks like the Phantom God Thorn, there were simpler uses, such as divine sense detection and divine sense communication.  

Chu Ning had already learned the Sound Transmission spell, but the two methods differed.  

Sound Transmission relied on emitting faint whispers amplified by spiritual energy, whereas divine sense communication required no sound at all—messages could be directly transmitted into the recipient's mind, making it far more advanced.  

After cultivating for a while, Chu Ning was about to conclude his session when his heart suddenly stirred.  

Someone had entered the courtyard and was heading toward his bedroom.  

**Divine Sense Extension!**  

Without hesitation, Chu Ning extended his divine sense outward.  

After consistent training, his divine sense had improved, extending from its original range of two zhang (about 6 meters) to an additional half-chi (about 15 cm).  

Soon, a familiar figure appeared within his divine sense's detection range.  

**Cao Dongxin?**  

When he recognized the intruder, Chu Ning sighed softly.  

"So he finally came."  

His earlier decision to ignore Cao Dongxin had been partly intentional—to provoke or test the man.  

Cao Dongxin was reclusive by nature, and such people were prone to extremes.  

If he realized that Chu Ning's future achievements might surpass his own, he would likely fear retaliation.  

Whether Cao Dongxin could swallow his pride or would resort to extreme measures, Chu Ning hadn’t been certain.  

He had merely wanted to test the waters.  

Now, it seemed Cao Dongxin had indeed taken the bait.  

Keeping his divine sense trained on the man, Chu Ning prepared himself for any contingency.  

As Cao Dongxin approached the door, he retrieved something from his robes and used a Telekinesis spell to hurl it into Chu Ning's room.  

Chu Ning reacted instantly, leaping from his bed.  

Activating the Wind Riding Technique, he swiftly maneuvered into the backyard.  

Though he didn’t know what Cao Dongxin had thrown, Chu Ning wasn’t taking any chances.  

Once in the backyard, he continued monitoring the situation with his divine sense.  

The object Cao Dongxin had thrown landed silently on the floor, releasing a cloud of gray smoke.  

Cao Dongxin then cast a simple spell, forcing the smoke into the room.  

The intent was unmistakable.  

Though Chu Ning didn’t know the exact nature of the smoke, it was undoubtedly meant to incapacitate a cultivator—either by neutralizing spiritual energy or inducing unconsciousness.  

Clearly, Cao Dongxin had resorted to underhanded methods to avoid detection, given the proximity of neighboring residents.  

"Truly, the wretched have their reasons for being hated."  

A cold glint flashed in Chu Ning’s eyes.  

Before this, he hadn’t harbored any particular ill will toward Cao Dongxin—he had simply refused to show him courtesy.  

But now that the man had come seeking trouble with clear hostile intent, Chu Ning saw no reason to hold back.  

Qi Chongmao must have been lonely in the afterlife. Chu Ning wouldn’t mind sending him a companion.  

The only complication was the couple living next door. If the commotion grew too loud, they might notice—and worse, they might connect Qi Chongmao’s disappearance to him.  

With that in mind, Chu Ning remained in the backyard, silently observing Cao Dongxin’s movements through his divine sense.  

After roughly the time it took to drink a cup of tea, Cao Dongxin swallowed a pill, then pushed open Chu Ning’s door and stepped inside.  

**"No one’s here?"**  

Seeing the empty room, Cao Dongxin’s dark face twisted in shock.  

His gaze flickered toward the backyard. Clutching a talisman, he cautiously advanced.  

Chu Ning, having completely concealed his presence with his Yin Wood Spirit Body, tracked Cao Dongxin’s approach.  

The moment the man stepped into the backyard, Chu Ning activated the Swift Movement Talisman in his hand.  

In an instant, he appeared before Cao Dongxin.  

**Heavenly Fist Technique!**  

Without giving his opponent a chance to react, Chu Ning struck with a lethal blow.  

Cao Dongxin barely had time to register the attack before Chu Ning’s fist slammed into him.  

**"You—"**  

Cao Dongxin’s eyes bulged with disbelief.  

Even in death, he couldn’t comprehend how Chu Ning had detected him in advance—he had been meticulous, even using the Immortal Bewildering Mist.  

Nor could he fathom how Chu Ning, a mere fourth-level Qi Refining cultivator, had somehow become a body cultivator with such formidable techniques.  

Despite being at the fifth level of Qi Refining, Cao Dongxin hadn’t even had a chance to fight back.  

Chu Ning didn’t dwell on the man’s final thoughts.  

He swiftly collected Cao Dongxin’s belongings, then incinerated the corpse with several Fireball spells.  

Afterward, he extended his divine sense once more.  

Detecting no unusual activity from the neighboring couple, who remained asleep, he relaxed slightly.  

His actions had been swift and decisive—they likely hadn’t noticed a thing.  

Still, Chu Ning remained vigilant.  

For the rest of the night, he meditated in cultivation, only allowing himself to truly unwind when dawn arrived without incident.  

After tidying up, he left his courtyard and headed for the training grounds.
