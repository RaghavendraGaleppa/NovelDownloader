**Chapter 71: Immortal Physique Cannot Contain Inner Qi, Beyond Divine Arts? Departing for the Nine Peaks Martial Competition**

Half an hour later.

Li Mo looked at the newly refined "Fiery Lotus Extreme Yang Art" in his hand, lost in thought.

This was a peerless art.

With the foundation of the Fiery Core Lotus Genesis Art and another ten years of martial dao comprehension, he effortlessly mastered it to Grand Completion.

An Upper-grade mental cultivation technique transforming into a peerless art meant a difference that was absolutely visible to the naked eye.

However...

Although the fluctuations from the thirty-six lotus seeds were much stronger, there was still no sign of them taking root or sprouting.

"I refuse to believe it."

Li Mo pulled out another bottle of ten-thousand-year Earth Vein Spirit Milk, uncorked it, and took a large gulp.

Instantly, a swollen sensation spread through his Dantian and meridians.

He circulated the "Fiery Lotus Extreme Yang Art" at full power, each lotus seed acting like a pump, furiously absorbing the earth vein essence.

A quarter of an hour later.

In his Dantian, a trace of fiery color actually emerged.

"Inner Qi!?"

Before Li Mo could rejoice.

In an instant.

The newly born Inner Qi vanished into thin air.

It was as if it had been swallowed by an invisible abyss, leaving no trace.

He was genuinely dumbfounded.

It was already hard enough to condense Inner Qi; now it would disappear after being condensed?

"This is bizarre."

"I can't even break through with a peerless art?"

"Am I going to be stuck at the Blood Qi Realm for my entire life?"

Li Mo opened his eyes, stopped circulating his cultivation art, his face filled with doubt about life itself.

He forced himself to calm down and think.

The cultivation art deduced by the Ancient Bronze Heavenly Book Seal definitely had no problems.

Then the problem could only be with himself.

"Profound Womb Immortal Physique?"

A flash of inspiration struck him, and Li Mo muttered to himself.

Speaking of which, although he had possessed an Immortal Physique for a long time, he knew very little about this constitution. When he went to the library, he had read some unusual tales and legends, but never found a single record about it.

But after much thought.

Besides the Immortal Physique, he couldn't find any other reason.

"The thirty-six lotus seeds make it very difficult to condense Inner Qi through a peerless art, and furthermore..."

"My body cannot accommodate Inner Qi."

He summarized these two problems.

Li Mo fell into contemplation again.

What to do?

After much deliberation, he believed there were two methods that might be reliable.

First, cripple his cultivation and re-cultivate. This time, instead of opening all thirty-six main meridians, he would only open twelve, like a normal person.

Second, wait for a higher-grade Silver Heavenly Book Seal.

With a Silver Heavenly Book Seal, a peerless art could be transformed into a divine art.

Moreover.

He also had a Gilded Heavenly Book Seal, which could even elevate the "Fiery Lotus Extreme Yang Art" by another grade, making this martial art reach...

Beyond Divine Arts!

The thirty-six meridian Blood Qi Great Cycle was very powerful.

After entering the Inner Qi Realm, it would be even more unimaginable.

"Since it's already open."

"Then I must see it through to the end."

Li Mo hesitated for merely three and one-third seconds before making his choice.

Wait!

We have the Ice Lump and Little Princess Jiang. A mere Silver Heavenly Book Seal is just around the corner.

Returning to Autumn Water Pavilion.

The leaves in the courtyard had stopped swaying, covered in white frost, weighed down so heavily they couldn't lift their heads.

Autumn Water Pavilion was exceptionally cold tonight; walking in felt like instantly teleporting to the dead of winter, where dripping water would turn to ice.

Inside the Ice Lump's room.

An astonishing chill emanated, accompanied by wisps of hazy, colorful light.

"She said tonight, and it is tonight."

"Tomorrow, she'll probably be in the Inner Qi Realm."

Li Mo sighed with emotion and returned to the adjacent room.

It wasn't an unbearable cold. It was just that his bed was against the wall, and his bedding had frozen stiff.

Suddenly, he felt a sensation.

It was a fluctuation from the World Seed.

"Jiang Churong is quite punctual every day."

Li Mo lay on his bed, his body resting, his consciousness entering the World Seed.

...

"Tea... Teacher!"

Jiang Churong sat obediently in a duck-like squat before the stone table. Seeing a figure carrying a 'textbook' approach, a cautious smile immediately bloomed on her small face.

Li Mo gracefully sat down at the table, casually brewing tea.

He brewed the tea but didn't drink it, looking up and saying, "Ahem, what I taught last time, have you thoroughly understood it?"

"Mm-hmm!" Jiang Churong nodded like a chick pecking rice.

She was super serious. Heavenly Venerable Teacher's requirements were high, and she was afraid of not meeting them and making her teacher unhappy. Even when she went out to pick up scraps every day, she would wave a branch twice.

"Good, then regarding your previous confusion, I shall explain it to you."

The Heavenly Venerable Lord opened the textbook.

This textbook was lovingly provided by the Ice Lump, and revised by Student Li. There was only one copy in the entire world.

Jiang Churong's sword dao talent was outrageous. After days of lecturing, without teaching her any specific sword technique, she had refined her self-created martial art to the Upper-grade. And it was not far from becoming a peerless art.

It was just absurd.

This time, too, she was like a sponge, absorbing all the sword dao knowledge Li Mo brought from the Ice Lump. In the middle, Li Mo, in order to keep up with her thinking, even used his martial dao comprehension to understand the sword dao knowledge imparted by Ying Bing.

After the not-so-pleasant lecture session for Li Mo ended.

"How is your body recovering?"

"Al... almost there," Jiang Churong said, her fingers intertwined.

"Then strike while the iron is hot. The sooner you recover, the sooner you can start practicing martial arts."

Li Mo took out various tonics again. When Jiang Churong's body fully recovered, there should be a decent reward calculated, right?

Just as he was thinking this.

"Tea... Teacher..."

"Hm?" Li Mo looked up.

He found Jiang Churong opposite him pursing her lips, hesitating to speak, her fingers intertwined again, and a small glimmer of anticipation in her grayish-white eyes...

"What is it?"

"I... I want... want to hear stories of the Barren Realm."

...

After the last practice session, Li Mo, in order to motivate Little Princess Jiang, had slightly embellished novels he had read in his previous life and turned them into legends for her to hear.

Had to say.

The novels he could remember, while having an excellent motivational effect... were also very entertaining.

So, the glimmer of anticipation in Jiang Churong's eyes was nothing more than two words: "Update the story."

"Alright then..."

...

The next day.

Shang Wu actually woke up early. In the small Autumn Water Pavilion, her serious voice echoed:

"For many years, our Qunyu Peak has repeatedly fought and repeatedly lost, repeatedly lost and repeatedly fought, to the point where morale has been eroded and the peak's prestige has been lost. This situation must be completely reversed from now on."

"Little Bing'er, my precious disciple, we must display our style, demonstrate our confidence, and achieve results in this competition!"

"To recast the glory of Qunyu Peak, you all..."

Shang Wu clenched her fist, as if she could already see Qunyu Peak, under her leadership, returning to the head of all peaks.

After a moment of silence.

Student Li glanced at the Ice Lump, then raised his hand and said, "Master, I mean, is there a possibility that..."

"Ying Bing is the True Disciple of the Sect Master?"

Shang Wu: "!"

Oh, right.

How could she forget about this?

The light in her almond eyes immediately faded. "Then it's over, I bet a lot of money..."

Li Mo: "...There are betting games in the sect?"

So, you're not just eyeing the sect's rewards, but also planning to earn money through unofficial means, huh!

"That's called excitement. I bet on Qunyu Peak ranking first."

Shang Wu looked like she'd been hit by frost, glanced at her disciple, and shook her head: "It's ruined, definitely no chance."

Her precious disciple was only in the Blood Qi Realm. She originally had high hopes for Ying Bing, who had broken through to Inner Qi.

Li Mo said helplessly, "I alone shouldn't cause our Qunyu Peak's ranking to be very bad, right?"

"It's useless. I bet on first place. Can you really defeat Little Bing'er?"

Shang Wu shook her head again. She was already figuring out how to default on her debts.

Thus, Autumn Water Pavilion's pre-competition mobilization meeting hastily concluded.

Old Ba arrived punctually at the entrance, driving a horse carriage.

"Two True Disciples, it's time to go to the Main Peak!"
