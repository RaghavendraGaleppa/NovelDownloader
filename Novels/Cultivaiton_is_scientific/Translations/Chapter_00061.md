# Chapter 61: Slaying the Demon

"Stay here and don't move!" the Foundation Establishment cultivator instructed Li Shiming.

As soon as the words left his mouth, a cold light shot from the cultivator's hand, carrying his figure into the air as he streaked toward the residential building at incredible speed.

Gu Jia nodded at Li Shiming before summoning a sword light of his own and following suit.

Li Shiming obediently remained where he was, having no desire to play the hero. Just the fact that Tianhai Sect had dispatched a Foundation Establishment cultivator was enough to reveal how deep these waters ran. As a mere fledgling cultivator, even observing the battle from a distance was risky enough.

He took out his monocular telescope again. Since it emitted no spiritual energy fluctuations, neither the Foundation Establishment cultivator nor Gu Jia would detect its use. Even if they did notice it, cultivators' general disregard for mundane objects meant they wouldn't pay the telescope any attention.

"I smell the stench of Profound Nether Sect demons!" the Foundation Establishment cultivator transmitted to Gu Jia as they approached the residence.

Hearing this, Gu Jia felt both elated and apprehensive. He was pleased that his report to the sect hadn't been mistaken, but terrified that the Profound Nether Sect had extended its reach here—his future days would become much harder.

With a wave of his hand, the Foundation Establishment cultivator unleashed a terrifying sword light that illuminated the darkness, a massive blade energy descending upon the target that seemed to cover the entire residence.

The building disintegrated instantly under the sword light, startling the cultivator inside. Seeing the dazzling sword light, horror flashed in his eyes.

He suddenly spat out a mouthful of black blood, which transformed into a massive skull that rushed to meet the sword light. After conjuring this, the cultivator seemed to have expended most of his vitality, his body shrinking visibly.

Another mouthful of heart's blood followed, this time accompanied by a crimson talisman.

"Trying to escape?" The Foundation Establishment cultivator's voice boomed like a god's decree. After shattering the giant skull, the sword light split into three—one slashing at the crimson talisman while the other two arced around to cut off potential escape routes.

The crimson talisman transformed into a bloody light, carrying the cultivator's figure toward the city center. He knew well that outrunning a Foundation Establishment cultivator was impossible, but this was a mortal city. If he could reach densely populated areas, he might still have a chance to escape using various techniques.

One sword light struck the bloody radiance, shearing off a small portion, but the light continued fleeing. The other two sword lights followed, cutting away nearly half of it.

The cultivator within the bloody light now had most of his body mangled. Despair filled his eyes.

He hadn't expected the Foundation Establishment cultivator sent after him to be a sword cultivator specializing in offense. Among Foundation Establishment cultivators, strength varied greatly, and this one was undoubtedly among the elite of his realm.

With a venomous glare at the Foundation Establishment cultivator, the dying man abruptly compressed his spiritual energy vortex. A surge of black spiritual energy erupted from its core.

The Foundation Establishment cultivator remained confident in his swordsmanship. A late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator, no matter what tricks he had, couldn't escape his sword light.

The three sword lights had already extinguished most of the cultivator's vitality, leaving him with no strength to flee further. The Foundation Establishment cultivator wanted to take him alive—he needed to know why a Profound Nether Sect cultivator had appeared here and what schemes were afoot.

The conflict between Tianhai Sect and Profound Nether Sect had lasted a century, yet neither side had encroached upon the other's mortal territories. Mortals were the foundation of any sect; without them, there would be no new generations of cultivators. If Profound Nether Sect was truly targeting Tianhai Sect's mortal domain, it would escalate the war between the two great sects.

"He's going to self-destruct!" Sensing the unstable spiritual energy fluctuations from the cultivator, the Foundation Establishment cultivator frowned and summoned a shield before him.

The shield materialized instantly, projecting a massive phantom that protected both him and Gu Jia behind him.

The cultivator's body exploded, his black blood transforming into a mist that sprayed outward in all directions.

This was an area densely populated with ordinary residents. The black mist spread in a roughly fifty-meter radius.

Within this circle, everyone was affected by the sinister fog. Agonized screams erupted, filled with unbearable pain, followed by figures stumbling out from windows and doors.

Through his telescope, Li Shiming saw clearly that these were no longer human. Their skin had turned bluish-black, their eyes burned crimson, and they emitted primitive howls from their mouths. These transformed creatures, upon leaving their homes, immediately sought to scatter outward, drawn by some primal instinct toward living humans in the distance. If allowed to spread, the consequences would be unimaginable.

The Foundation Establishment cultivator understood this well. With a flick of his finger, another sword light shot forth.

The sword light carried a terrifying beauty—its speed so immense that in the darkness it seemed to form a net of blades. Every monster was cleanly decapitated, the formidable Foundation Establishment energy then dissolving their bodies into pools of blood.

"Disciple Gu, have the local authorities cordon off this area. Isolate the contaminated zone until the residual toxins dissipate before allowing anyone in," the Foundation Establishment cultivator said grimly, his expression dark. Of course he was in a foul mood—a mere Qi Condensation junior had caused such havoc right under his nose. Though he'd succeeded in killing the enemy, this incident would undoubtedly become a source of ridicule among his sect peers.

"I'll handle it immediately," Gu Jia replied cautiously, knowing better than to say more in this situation. He turned to notify the imperial family, who would take over from here.

Seeing that the enemy cultivator had been dealt with, Li Shiming finally jumped down from the rooftop, intending to inspect the battlefield. Though he'd witnessed the battle through his telescope, the distance had been considerable. A Foundation Establishment cultivator in action was a rare sight—he might not get another chance like this for a long time, so he wanted to examine the scene up close.

"What's this?" As he approached the ruined residence, he spotted a pouch by the roadside. Picking it up, Li Shiming realized it was a storage bag. His heart leapt as he swiftly stored it in his machine room space.

After all, he was the one who'd discovered the cultivator—he had contributed to this operation. Keeping a storage bag as a reward seemed only fair. He mentally justified his actions to ease his conscience.

Hurrying toward where the Foundation Establishment cultivator stood, Li Shiming saw the man examining the contents of another storage bag.

"You performed well," the Foundation Establishment cultivator said, waving dismissively. "The items in this storage bag are too sinister for someone like you, so I won't be sharing them. However, you'll receive appropriate rewards later."
