# Chapter 15: Spirit Farmer's Exclusive Spells

Gu Mo listened quietly to the explanation, a glimmer of delight appearing in his eyes. Although the benefits mentioned didn't include tangible cultivation resources, they did offer privileges equivalent to those of outer sect disciples.

By joining the Spirit Plant Hall and passing the assessment, Gu Mo would enjoy the same benefits as outer sect disciples in renting spirit fields. Ordinary servant disciples who joined the Spirit Plant Hall would be assigned to outer sect disciples within the hall to manage spirit fields.

To put it simply, if Qinglu Sect were likened to a large corporation, the Spirit Plant Hall would be one of its departments, with outer sect disciples serving as mid-level managers overseeing vast tracts of spirit fields and handling important matters.

However, the daily management of these fields couldn't be handled personally by the outer sect disciples, as they needed time for cultivation. This was where servant disciples came in—they were the low-level laborers of the corporation.

If the laborers were competent, the managers could relax a bit. But the Spirit Plant Hall often ended up with the unwanted, less capable workers, leaving the outer sect disciples no choice but to spend more time managing the fields themselves, which greatly hindered their cultivation.

As a result, some outer sect disciples voluntarily reduced the number of fields they managed to lessen their burden. However, the unused fields couldn't be left abandoned, leading to the introduction of this benefit—allowing servant disciples who actively joined the Spirit Plant Hall to rent spirit fields.

After renting a field, they only needed to pay an annual fee, keeping the remaining profits for themselves. The Spirit Plant Hall wouldn't interfere with what was planted in the fields.

In contrast, ordinary servant disciples working under outer sect disciples could only receive meager annual wages.

Of course, to qualify for this benefit, one had to pass an assessment proving their ability to manage the fields properly. Otherwise, leasing fields to someone clueless would be a waste of valuable resources.

"Let's go. I'll explain the details on the way!" Seeing Gu Mo's pleased expression, Mai Yunfa felt reassured. However, to avoid complications, he decided to take Gu Mo to the Spirit Plant Hall immediately.

This way, he could finally report success in this year's recruitment task. After years of zero results, he had finally found one willing recruit. Surely, Elder Zhao wouldn't deduct his task rewards this time.

Mai Yunfa led Gu Mo out of the Personnel Hall and summoned a flying sword. With a hand seal, the sword enlarged.

"Hop on." Mai Yunfa stepped onto the sword and beckoned to Gu Mo.

Gu Mo gazed enviously at the flying sword—a standard artifact forged by the Artifact Peak. When paired with the Sword Control Technique, it could be used for combat or as a mode of transportation.

Unfortunately, obtaining such a sword was still beyond Gu Mo's reach. Although it was a standard artifact, the price was steep. Moreover, mastering the Sword Control Technique was a prerequisite for wielding it.

"Let's go!" Once Gu Mo stepped onto the sword, Mai Yunfa activated the technique, and the sword soared into the sky, speeding toward their destination.

"This is as fast as a high-speed train," Gu Mo mused, watching the scenery blur beneath them. His initial nervousness had faded, replaced by calm observation as he compared the experience to riding a train.

The smooth, swift flight was proof of Mai Yunfa's proficiency in the Sword Control Technique.

After about fifteen minutes, a valley came into view—endless rice fields stretching across its expanse.

"I'll take you to meet Elder Zhao." Mai Yunfa guided Gu Mo to a cluster of buildings on the valley's edge—the Spirit Plant Hall's headquarters.

Hearing that he would meet the hall's elder, Gu Mo tensed slightly. An elder of a hall was at least a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Facing someone a whole realm above him, Gu Mo worried his unique circumstances might be exposed. A servant disciple with triple the spiritual power and physique of his peers was undeniably suspicious.

If his anomalies were discovered, Gu Mo would have to reveal some of his less critical secrets. As long as his Sunflower remained hidden, the rest wouldn't pose much risk—it might even bring some benefits.

Lost in thought, Gu Mo barely noticed their arrival at the Elder's Hall. He quickly regulated the flow of his spiritual energy to minimize fluctuations.

This was a rudimentary concealment method he'd picked up from the library—hardly a proper technique, but better than nothing.

"Gu Mo, is it? Not bad." Zhao Qiancheng, a middle-aged man, gave Gu Mo a cursory glance and offered a few words of encouragement. Ordinarily, an elder wouldn't bother meeting a servant disciple, but these were desperate times.

With so few willing to join the Spirit Plant Hall, Zhao Qiancheng felt obliged to show goodwill—especially since it cost him nothing.

"Brother Yunfa must have explained the benefits of joining our hall. To pass the assessment, you only need to master one spirit farmer-exclusive spell." After a few praises, Zhao Qiancheng handed Gu Mo a manual.

Accepting it respectfully, Gu Mo followed Mai Yunfa out. Once outside, he exhaled in relief—the first hurdle was cleared.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, you'll stay here for now. If you have any questions about cultivation, visit the Teaching Hall—senior spirit farmers often give lectures there." After settling Gu Mo in his new quarters, Mai Yunfa hurried off to continue his recruitment duties. Missing a potential recruit in his absence would be disastrous.

"Thank you, Senior Brother Mai!" Gu Mo bowed as Mai Yunfa departed.

Turning to his new residence, Gu Mo noted the improved living conditions compared to the servant quarters. The place even had a small courtyard and protective formations.

Activating the formation would prevent disturbances during seclusion, but it required spirit stones—something Gu Mo lacked. Aside from the assessment opportunity and manual, the Spirit Plant Hall had provided nothing else. He wondered if other peaks were equally stingy.

With a sigh, Gu Mo entered the house and opened the manual. Since he hadn't yet developed spiritual sense at the Qi Refining stage, he couldn't use jade slips for quick reading and had to study the old-fashioned way.

The manual contained five first-tier spells tailored for spirit farmers: Minor Gengjin Sword Qi (Metal), Minor Revival Art (Wood), Minor Cloud Rain Art (Water), Minor Flame Wave (Fire), and Minor Earthworm Technique (Earth).

Each spell served a specific purpose. The Gengjin Sword Qi was an offensive spell for exterminating pests—spirit insects and rodents impervious to ordinary means. To avoid damaging the crops, it was a single-target spell with concentrated power.

If crops were accidentally harmed, the Minor Revival Art could heal them. This Wood-attribute spell also worked on cultivators' injuries.

The most frequently used was the Water-attribute Minor Cloud Rain Art, which summoned spirit rain essential for crop growth.

The Fire and Earth spells were employed before planting and after harvest. The Minor Flame Wave was an area-of-effect fire spell that burned hidden insect eggs or leftover stalks to enrich the soil.

Meanwhile, the Minor Earthworm Technique summoned a giant earthworm to till the land.

After reading the descriptions, Gu Mo gained a clearer picture of cultivation-style farming. But why did all the spells have "Minor" in their names? Were there upgraded versions like Major Gengjin Sword Qi or Major Revival Art?
