# Chapter 36: Venturing Out Again

Carrying a storage pouch, Chu Ning returned to his dwelling. Although everything that had happened today was completely unexpected, upon careful consideration, it didn't seem like a bad thing for him.

Originally, Chu Ning had planned to return a portion of the talisman paper to the sect and sell another portion at the market. But now, it seemed he wouldn't need to go through such trouble—he could simply sell them regularly to Mu Ling. Not only was this safer, but it also brought higher returns.

However, Chu Ning decided he needed to maintain appearances. Before visiting Mu Ling, he would still need to make a trip to the market to purchase some talisman paper, as sect entry and exit records were easily verifiable.

With this in mind, Chu Ning began organizing his storage pouch. Items he had previously hidden could now be stored properly. First, he took out the 30 spirit stones from his pocket and placed them with the 22 already in the pouch. Although 20 of these 52 stones technically belonged to Mu Ling, they were effectively his now—he would simply repay her with talisman paper.

Next, he packed away the remaining talisman paper. Originally, he had produced 10,800 sheets. Today, he had submitted 3,500 to the sect and sold 2,050 to Mu Ling, leaving him with 5,250 sheets.

"This should be enough for Mu Ling for five months," Chu Ning mused. "By the sixth month, the new batch of Ink Spirit Bamboo will be ready, so the supply will be seamless." He couldn't help but chuckle. Being on a retainer didn't seem so bad after all—at least he didn't have to worry about sales.

Finally, he stored the rest of his belongings in the pouch: manuals for the Evergreen Wood Technique, the Nine Refinements Body Tempering Art, and the Golden Sword Technique, along with three talismans and the hefty wooden sword he had bought from Old Man Sun.

As he was about to put away the wooden sword, he paused. Activating his Object Control Technique, the sword shot out like a black streak of light, stopping just before hitting the window before returning to his hand.

"Maybe I should find a way to learn a proper sword flight technique," Chu Ning muttered, hefting the heavy wooden sword. His control over the Object Control Technique had improved significantly—he had tested it before, and the sword could now chop through a sizable tree. However, without a proper sword flight technique, he could only move it in straight lines and couldn't increase its speed, limiting its effectiveness.

"I haven't heard of any labor disciples learning sword flight techniques," he mused. "But talisman paper production and talisman crafting are related. Maybe I can ask about learning talisman crafting when I submit the next batch."

He then considered his cultivation progress. Should he reveal his third-level Qi Refining cultivation? If his level was too low, it might restrict his ability to learn talisman crafting.

"Reaching the third level in just over half a year—that shouldn't be too fast, right?" he wondered. Still, he decided not to act rashly. He would gather more information first, checking the progress of other new disciples. If others had already broken through, he could choose an appropriate time to reveal his own advancement without drawing suspicion.

As for gathering information, Qiu Shunyi was the obvious choice. Whether he had inherited Shang Zhaoxiang's social skills or not, Qiu had built good relationships with many new disciples and was well-informed.

Over the next few days, Chu Ning used the excuse of inspecting Qiu's new planting season to gather useful information. From Qiu, he learned that several new labor disciples had already reached the third level of Qi Refining. In the Spirit Plantation Division, Yuan Guang had recently broken through to the third level. While not many had reached this stage, it hadn't caused much of a stir in the sect—the first three levels of Qi Refining were relatively easy to achieve, with outer and inner disciples often breaking through in just a few months. The real hurdle was advancing from the third to the fourth level.

Thus, Chu Ning chose an appropriate time to "break through" to the third level. Since his progress had previously aligned with Yuan Guang and others, it didn't raise any eyebrows. Even Zhuang Yunde assumed Chu Ning had simply been at the same level as the others but was more skilled in spell application.

During this time, Chu Ning continued his planting work. The Qingxi Sect's location wasn't particularly cold, so even in winter, the spirit fields weren't left fallow—there were suitable spirit plants to cultivate. For Chu Ning, Ink Spirit Bamboo could still be grown year-round, especially with the Evergreen Wood Technique mitigating weather effects.

However, the medium-grade spirit fields in Zone D couldn't support spirit rice in colder temperatures, so Chu Ning switched to planting Purple Water Grass, an excellent fodder for spirit fish and one of the sect's encouraged crops, which they would fully repurchase.

Over the next twenty-odd days, Chu Ning successfully cultivated both types of plants, using the Evergreen Wood Technique to nurture them. With everything progressing smoothly, his daily tasks now involved routine weeding, pest control, and spell application.

As the one-month deadline for his agreement with Mu Ling approached, Chu Ning decided to make a trip to the market. On one hand, if others noticed he hadn't left the sect yet produced over a thousand sheets of talisman paper, it would be obvious he had been hoarding. On the other hand, he needed to purchase some jade boxes—his continuously nurtured Seven-Star Spirit Fruit would ripen soon. After over a hundred days of cultivation, the fruit had grown plump and rich in spiritual energy, likely ripening within the next month. He needed the boxes to store them after harvest.

It had been several months since his last market visit, which had ended with an encounter with a bandit. This time, Chu Ning resolved to stay with companions as much as possible, especially on the return trip, to avoid any mishaps. He arranged with Qiu Shunyi to visit the market the next day and even suggested inviting more people for safety in numbers.

When Chu Ning arrived at the mountain gate plaza the following day, his eyes widened in surprise. The place was packed—was this some kind of new disciple group outing?
