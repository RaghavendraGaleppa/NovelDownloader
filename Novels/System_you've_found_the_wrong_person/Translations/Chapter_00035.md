# Chapter 35: Dou Changsheng's Decade  

The summit of Qingyang Peak lay in ruins.  

Shattered tiles and broken beams were scattered everywhere. Lin Daoqi sat on the ground, one hand gripping his longsword as he panted heavily, his chest heaving with agitation. Chen Weiquan clutched his face, blood seeping through his fingers and dripping steadily onto the ground.  

Yet none of this held their attention.  

At this moment, it was as if their very souls had been snatched away.  

The scene remained eerily silent. Even though Dou Changsheng had left a quarter of an hour ago, the atmosphere remained unchanged. They stood like statues—only the rise and fall of their chests betrayed any sign of life.  

This battle had shaken them to their core.  

For these young warriors who had dreamed of stepping into the martial world and competing with the heroes of the land, it was nothing short of a thunderbolt from a clear sky.  

*How could Dou Changsheng be so strong?*  

The question echoed endlessly in their minds.  

After what felt like an eternity, Wang Dingli finally let out a sigh and murmured, "Dou Changsheng is only eighteen years old."  

"To possess such strength at such an age..."  

"Who in the future could possibly stand against him on the Human Ranking?"  

"The next decade truly belongs to Dou Changsheng—those words were no exaggeration."  

Wang Dingli glanced at the collapsed hall and began descending the mountain, continuing, "I'm already twenty-five. I thought that after obtaining the Qingyang Spring and further strengthening my power, I could challenge the Human Ranking."  

"But today, I realized I was nothing more than a frog at the bottom of a well."  

"Protected too well by my sect, I was like a flower in a greenhouse."  

"Within the Great Jin, my ties to the Yunding Sect would ensure I'm treated with deference. So, I've decided to leave for the Eastern Qi."  

"Only through tempering can steel be forged."  

He cast one last look at Lin Daoqi but said nothing more before departing.  

Chen Weiquan sighed as well.  

No matter what schemes or plots they had devised, they all crumbled in the face of absolute strength.  

Lin Daoqi and Wang Dingli's meticulous planning had been rendered meaningless with a single phrase—*Dragons do not dwell among snakes*—turning their efforts into dust and themselves into laughingstocks.  

Wang Dingli's departure for the Eastern Qi was ostensibly for self-improvement, but it was also an escape.  

Staying in the capital would only invite ridicule once today's events spread. And yet, Wang Dingli wasn't the most pitiable—that title belonged to Lin Daoqi, who still sat slumped on the ground.  

His attempts to flaunt his intelligence and elevate his reputation had only brought him humiliation.

After today, Dou Changsheng would undoubtedly draw the attention of the Martial Tower. In the next edition of the Human Ranking, his name would surely appear—though his initial ranking would likely be modest, as was customary for newcomers.  

Only by challenging ranked experts could one directly claim their position. Otherwise, even earth-shattering feats would be met with cautious restraint from the Martial Tower.  

Chen Weiquan sighed again.  

*Dou Changsheng is only eighteen.*  

*How could he be so monstrous?*  

Their combined efforts had been shattered in a single strike.  

The gap in strength was utterly despair-inducing. Chen Weiquan knew that even if he mastered the *Seven Injuries Fist* and significantly improved his combat prowess, he still wouldn’t stand a chance against Dou Changsheng.  

At best, he’d go from being defeated in one move to lasting three.  

The next decade among the younger generation of the martial world truly belonged to Dou Changsheng.  

Chen Weiquan lowered his hand, retrieved a torn handkerchief from his tattered robes, and wiped his face. Turning to the newly returned Elder Ziyang, he said, "Elder Ziyang, please prepare a room for me to clean up."  

Elder Ziyang nodded and personally escorted Chen Weiquan to a guest chamber. After closing the door, his expression turned grave.  

"Well?" he asked in a low voice.  

Chen Weiquan sat down, tore off his ruined robes, and began washing himself with a damp towel.  

"Dou Changsheng crushed everything with sheer force," he replied. "Lin Daoqi's schemes failed, and my own plans fell apart. I didn’t manage to get closer to Dou Changsheng to monitor him for the Prime Minister regarding the military payroll case."  

Elder Ziyang gave a bitter smile. "Dou Changsheng is only eighteen."  

"Who knows how the Wang Clan raised such a monster?"  

"Breaking through to the Innate Realm at this age alone makes him a genius."  

"But Dou Changsheng slaying an Innate True Realm expert qualifies him as a peerless genius. After today, only 'heaven’s chosen' can describe him."  

"Calling him a genius would be an insult."  

"That sword technique—I recognized it as the *Boundless Sword Art*, an Innate True Realm martial art from the Boundless Sword Sect. That sect was destroyed a century ago, but the art itself has spread widely, with many sects preserving copies."  

"Our Three Yang Sect has it too. Many disciples practice it, but none have reached Dou Changsheng’s level."  

"His sword energy blanketed the sky, forming a river of blades—just how vast must his Innate Qi be?"  

"The *Triple Origin Qi Method* isn’t known for abundant Qi. Dou Changsheng must have had some extraordinary encounters."  

Chen Weiquan shook his head. "At eighteen, achieving this—of course he’s had encounters."  

"Every top-ranked genius on the Human Ranking has their own fortune and destiny."  

"This has been a wake-up call for me. I thought growing up in the capital meant I’d seen the world’s heroes—that even if those above me on the Human Ranking were stronger now, I’d catch up in time."  

"Now I see I underestimated the world."  

"Like Wang Dingli, I was too sheltered. Sparring sessions were always controlled—I never witnessed the true strength of these prodigies."  

Elder Ziyang’s expression darkened. "Dou Changsheng’s strength far exceeds our intelligence reports."  

"Right now, within Three Yang Mountain, only the three peak masters and Qingyang’s three senior disciples could suppress him."  

"But those three disciples aren’t here—they’re traveling the martial world."  

Chen Weiquan said, "Innate True Realm experts who’ve mastered the Five Qi Convergence can’t defeat Dou Changsheng now."  

"Only those like you, who’ve reached the Three Flowers Gathering—the Innate Mystic Realm—stand a chance."  

"Dou Changsheng revealed his strength today with ulterior motives. It wasn’t just to end the dispute—he was also sounding us out."  

"If something happens now, suspicion will naturally fall on you, Elder Hongyang, and Elder Qingyang."  

Chen Weiquan grabbed a fresh robe and draped it over himself irritably. "You’re a Three Yang Sect elder, master of Ziyang Peak, stationed here permanently."  

"When the military payroll went missing nearby, how could you have no leads?"  

Elder Ziyang sighed. "The Prime Minister summoned me to the capital to ask me that very question."  

"But I truly know nothing."  

Chen Weiquan glared at him. Given the Prime Minister’s capabilities, if Elder Ziyang had lied, he’d never have left the capital alive. And yet, the absurdity of it all gnawed at him.  

Elder Ziyang was a high-ranking figure in the Three Yang Sect, with numerous disciples under him. Any unusual activity in the area should have reached his ears. And yet, the military payroll had vanished without a trace.  

Chen Weiquan’s expression darkened. "The missing payroll isn’t just about the silver—it includes sets of Xuanjia cavalry armor and battle standards."  

"The silver and other treasures are secondary. The commoners can endure more hardship."  

"But the Xuanjia equipment is critical. If the Western Qin or Eastern Qi get their hands on it, they could decipher its secrets and train their own elite cavalry."  

"Worse, if domestic factions acquire it, they could use it to stage a coup."  

"Most importantly, the loss tarnishes the Prime Minister’s reputation."  

"Someone’s spreading rumors that he orchestrated the theft."  

"Now the Emperor doubts him. The northern factions are watching like vultures—even though General Yu Yun is imprisoned, he’s waiting for the Prime Minister to slip up so he can strike."  

"The Prime Minister ordered me here to investigate. You’re to assist me."  

Elder Ziyang hesitated. "Investigating the theft is our duty. Serving the Prime Minister is our obligation."  

"But this case involves forces far beyond our station."  

"With the Qingyang Spring’s opening, many powerful figures have gathered near Three Yang Mountain. Some are hidden among them."  

Chen Weiquan cut him off. "We don’t need to locate the payroll—just finding a lead would be a merit."  

"How capable are we?"  

"You have self-awareness. Do you think the Prime Minister doesn’t?"  

"He’s too wise to pin all his hopes on us."  

"We’re just one thread in his web. The true investigation lies with a Divine Transformation master."  

Elder Ziyang nodded submissively, but inwardly, a rebellious thought arose.  

*The Prime Minister is furious, claiming innocence—but is that the truth?*  

They were mere pawns in the Prime Minister’s game, far from his inner circle.  

*Could the Prime Minister be the thief crying 'stop thief'?*

Lin Daoqi remained in a daze until someone shook him awake.  

Looking up, he saw a middle-aged man with a square jaw, thick eyebrows, and a dignified bearing.  

"Uncle Seventeen..." he muttered.  

Lin Seventeen gazed down at his disheveled nephew and sighed. "You shouldn’t have come."  

He sighed again.  

It wasn’t Lin Daoqi’s fault.  

Dou Changsheng’s arrival had been unexpected—an unplanned disruption.  

And he was simply too strong.  

Lin Seventeen now understood Huoyun Zhenren’s earlier words. It hadn’t been flattery—Dou Changsheng truly deserved the praise.  

*The next decade belongs to Dou Changsheng.*  

Those words held no exaggeration.  

To share an era with such a figure was both a misfortune and an inevitability.  

Just as the previous generation had been overshadowed by the Demon Master, who had humiliated emperors and dominated the martial world, now Dou Changsheng would cast his shadow over this era.  

Lin Seventeen patted Lin Daoqi’s shoulder. "You and Dou Changsheng are different."  

"He may be a heaven-sent prodigy, but the trials he’ll face are ten—no, a hundred times greater than yours."  

"The Southern Chen produced the Demon Master, who stormed the imperial palace thrice, slapped the emperor, and slept in the royal bed."  

"If the Great Jin breeds another such monster, how could the Emperor rest easy?"  

"Would he too face rebellion?"  

"The Emperor would lose sleep over it."  

"And the Great King died at the Demon Master’s hands. Dou Changsheng shares his bloodline. Even if the Demon Master ignores him, the disciples of the Demon Palace won’t."  

"Dou Changsheng’s path will be fraught with peril and enemies."  

"That’s the price of being heaven’s chosen—his rise will be bathed in blood."  

"You’re different. Your talent is limited—at best, you’ll reach the middle ranks of the Human Ranking. The enemies you make, the Lin Clan can handle."  

"Dou Changsheng is arrogant enough to provoke the Prime Minister and investigate the payroll theft himself."  

"He seeks righteousness and loyalty."  

"You, despite your bold exterior, know your limits. You wouldn’t dare delve too deep into this case."  

"Even if you tried, you couldn’t stir up real trouble."  

"Dou Changsheng may one day rank among the top Earth Ranking experts, his words shaping the world—but only if he survives."  

"Your strength lies in your survival. You’ll likely become a Divine Transformation master, watching the world’s storms from afar. With luck, you might even reach the Earth Ranking and protect our clan."  

"A century from now, you may still stand as a pillar of righteousness, while Dou Changsheng is long gone."  

Lin Daoqi sighed again.  

His eyes brimmed with resentment as he stared at Lin Seventeen.  

His heart didn’t feel better—it ached even more.  

*Was this supposed to comfort me?*  

Lin Seventeen patted his shoulder once more. "I understand how you feel."  

"I’ve been there."  

"The martial world is vast. We’re destined to be stepping stones for the truly gifted."  

"We don’t need to see the view from the summit—the scenery halfway up is fine."  

"Let them fight their battles."  

"Live your own life."  

"Today’s humiliation? When Dou Changsheng tops the Human Ranking, you’ll realize it’s also a badge of honor."  

"Not everyone survives a fight with the number one."
