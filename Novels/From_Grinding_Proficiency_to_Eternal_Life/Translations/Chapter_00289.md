# Chapter 289: All of Them Are Ninth Realm?

The originally casual attitude had changed at this moment.

Chu Cangming said indifferently, "It seems I need to find something for this Junior Brother of mine to do."

"I underestimated this Junior Brother."

Chu Cangming brushed his sleeves and stood up, gazing at the gradually dissipating dragon-shaped cloud vortex at the mountain's peak. A cold arc curled at the corner of his mouth. "I heard that this Junior Brother of ours took the Mountain-Cleaving Sword from the Langhuan Book Tower to read. It won't do to practice only saber techniques and ignore sword techniques. There are quite a few divine weapons buried in the Sword Burial Abyss... It's time to send some 'opportunities' to this Junior Brother of mine."

He originally thought this was some stray dog from who knows where, but now it seems the other party is about to snatch food right from his mouth.

"This strand of True Qi is truly delicate..."

As the morning light pierced through the sea of clouds, Xu Yunfan stood atop the Qingwei Summit. Facing the first ray of morning sun's purple energy, he couldn't help but curl his lips slightly.

The newly born strand of Pure Yang True Qi within his body was currently like a flickering candle flame in a glass cup—it would dissipate in the boiling flesh furnace with the slightest carelessness.

If it weren't for his Attribute Panel having the effect of "once proven, always proven," other martial artists would have nowhere to cry even if they wanted to.

In the next instant, as the eastward purple energy touched his skin, this strand of Pure Yang True Qi automatically circulated within his flesh and blood. The powerful physique brought by the Marrow Cleansing Realm filtered the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into wisps of golden radiance, causing his entire body to faintly emit light.

"Those who cultivate Pure Yang Inner Qi into True Qi would probably need a year or two to completely stabilize it..."

He lightly pressed his tongue against his upper palate, feeling the slippery trajectory of the True Qi moving like a swimming fish within his body.

If the Attribute Panel couldn't ensure that cultivation states were "once proven, always proven," the blood energy unleashed when practicing the Dragon Fall Mace Technique last night alone would have been enough to shatter this strand of True Qi into scattered sparks.

After absorbing all the purple energy, the breathing in and out completely sucked the surrounding spiritual energy dry.

The spiritual energy was still too thin.

As he pondered this, he simultaneously guided the True Qi within his body to follow the predetermined great circulation path of the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, continuously refining the absorbed spiritual energy and purple energy to gradually strengthen himself.

The last wisp of eastward purple energy turned into golden radiance and dissipated on his tongue. Xu Yunfan slowly ended his cultivation.

He frowned as he sensed the Pure Yang True Qi gradually hiding deep within his body. The spiritual energy he had devoured like a whale had only made this hair-thin strand of True Qi slightly thicker.

The spiritual energy was still too thin, several grades inferior to the small world secret realm.

After completing thirty-six consecutive great cycles, this strand of Pure Yang True Qi had finally strengthened by a tiny bit.

True Qi was ultimately a transcendent energy. To continue advancing, one needed to breathe in and out the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to make further progress.

Only now did Xu Yunfan understand why the impure True Qi entangled around the fingertips of the Heavenly Pivot Gate's Holy Daughter he had encountered back then. Those True Qi forcibly condensed in the External Three Unions Realm were like pouring molten iron into a clay pot.

Even if Secret Martial Arts were used to forcibly harmonize it, it would ultimately leave spiderweb-like hidden injuries within the body.

True Qi was generally domineering. Even if its nature was gentle, it could easily tear the body apart when circulating through flesh and blood. In such a state, there was no chance of reaching the peak.

No wonder they couldn't rank among the top sects and could only rely on the Great Zhou Imperial Court to barely survive.

Xu Yunfan retracted his thoughts and slowly guided the circulating Pure Yang True Qi back into the depths of his flesh and blood, near the so-called...

Just as he was pondering, a clear child's voice split through the clouds at the mountain's peak.

"Senior Brother Xu! Master summons you to the Qingwei Hall immediately!"

The young servant boy in green robes rushed up the stone steps in a hurry, his sleeves stained with a few drops of unevaporated dew, clearly having come in haste.

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows slightly.

Since becoming a disciple under Bi Yuan nearly a month ago, this Sect Master and master had always been as elusive as a dragon. He would occasionally appear during morning lessons, but only hurriedly offered a few pointers. Seeing that Xu Yunfan's understanding of the martial arts he practiced was even deeper than his own, he simply asked if there was anything lacking, and if so, to speak up. Upon hearing there was nothing, he would quickly leave.

Could today's sudden summons be related to that "Anchor of the Heavenly Demon" or the secrets of the Dao Sect?

Xu Yunfan speculated inwardly. He naturally knew that the greatest purpose of Bi Yuan accepting him as a true disciple was to have an ally to resist that Heavenly Demon.

Following the green-robed servant to the front of the Qingwei Hall, the moment Xu Yunfan stepped into the great hall, his footsteps paused slightly.

Bi Yuan stood in the center with his back to the hall entrance. His black robes moved without wind, and purple-green lightning flickered within his sleeves.

What shocked Xu Yunfan even more was that there were three unfamiliar old men standing at the side of the hall.

The old man in gray robes on the left had eyes as cloudy as if covered with white film, but his ten fingers were as crystal clear as jade. He was actually the Dao Sect's Punishment Hall Chief, "Jade Judge" Cui Yu.

The red-faced old man on the right had a wooden sword hanging at his waist. Though his aura was as light and elegant as a pine, his energy was contained and not released.

The old Taoist in the middle, with a white beard hanging to his chest, stood with a smile. But after one glance, Xu Yunfan immediately gave his judgment: a smiling tiger hiding a knife behind his smile.

"Disciple, pay respects to these three Senior Uncle-Masters."

Bi Yuan turned around, his eyes like lightning, and an oppressive might as deep as an abyss silently enveloped the entire hall.

When his gaze swept over Xu Yunfan, it seemed to penetrate flesh and blood, peering directly into every wisp of energy circulation within his bones and organs.

This glance seemed to see through his bones and organs. When Bi Yuan saw the internal anomalies within Xu Yunfan, a hint of astonishment flashed in his eyes, then returned to calm. With others present, he couldn't speak, but his heart felt like it was being scratched by a cat's claws, wanting to investigate thoroughly.

In just over a month, Xu Yunfan had actually cultivated the Meridian Marrow Cleansing Technique to such a realm, and moreover... Pure Yang True Qi?!

His pupils contracted sharply, somewhat unable to believe it. Bi Yuan subconsciously rubbed his eyes.

The lustrous jade-like bones from the small success of the Meridian Marrow Cleansing Technique, the molten-gold-like scorching True Qi dormant in the Dantian after the Pure Yang One Qi Technique reached perfection, and even the fine blood patterns that appeared when the fine golden threads seeping from the Dragon Scale Armor blended with the flesh and blood... All of this was clearly visible to Bi Yuan.

"Pure Yang True Qi?!"

That aura was correct! Absolutely correct.

He would never mistake that aura. Thirty years ago, it was precisely by using Pure Yang True Qi as a guide that he split open the Ninth Realm's Heavenly Gate and ascended to the peak of Qi Refining!

But Xu Yunfan had only been cultivating for a little over a month, yet he had already condensed a strand of Pure Yang True Qi?!

Astonishment flashed through his eyes like lightning, but Bi Yuan's expression remained calm on the surface.

With his three Senior Brothers watching like tigers at the side, his fingers curled slightly in his sleeves, forcefully suppressing the urge to investigate.

Only the wide sleeves moved without wind, betraying a trace of emotional turmoil.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged as the Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Breath Technique quietly operated, concealing the energy within his body. Although it was only at the入门 level, it was sufficient to hide his energy. As long as others didn't make physical contact, they naturally couldn't discern specific information.

Xu Yunfan's gaze focused slightly, and waves of shock surged in his heart.

Before him, aside from Bi Yuan, the energy of the other two old men was as deep as an abyss. When they moved, there was a faint resonance with heaven and earth.

Ninth Realm Qi Refining, Supreme Grandmaster!

Just how many Ninth Realm Qi Refining experts did this Dao Sect have?!

He forcefully suppressed his turbulent thoughts and bowed in salute: "Disciple Xu Yunfan greets the three Senior Uncle-Masters."

Bi Yuan's lips curled up slightly as he raised the whisk in his hand. The bristles swayed, making a clear and crisp sound. "Yunfan, your timing is perfect."
