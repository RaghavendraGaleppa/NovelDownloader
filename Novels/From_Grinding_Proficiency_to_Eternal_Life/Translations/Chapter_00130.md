Chapter 130: Incense Fire Manifests Again

With a crisp sound of metal breaking, Yan Yuwei was sent flying backward, a spray of blood like plum blossoms scattering through the air in mid-air.

In that lightning-fast moment, Xu Yunfan finally seized the opportunity, grabbing the old man's wrist and bending it backward against the joint!

*Crack!*

The sound of the wrist bone snapping was drowned out by the clamor of battle throughout the building.

The old man's dark purple face turned a deep, bruised purple. The broken wrist suddenly bulged with veins, and his five fingers clamped onto Xu Yunfan's pulse point like an iron pincer, preventing Xu Yunfan from getting up to swing his hammer.

If Xu Yunfan were allowed to swing that hammer again, the old man wouldn't make it out alive today.

The two grappled in close combat, rolling across the banquet hall. An overturned copper hot pot spilled boiling oil, scorching a winding snake of fire across the floor.

The struggle at such close quarters was fraught with peril; every move was a lethal strike meant to take a life.

Xu Yunfan's head slammed backward into the blue brick floor. The moment the bricks shattered, his abdominal muscles coiled like a spring and sprang up. His legs wrapped around the old man's neck and flipped him through the air.

As the old man was hurled toward a load-bearing pillar, he reversed his grip on his steel whip, the tip hooking around the wooden column to forcibly halt his momentum.

The next second, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer came howling toward him.

"Get down here!"

Xu Yunfan's muscles undulated like waves. The muscles on his arms swelled by two circles, and the heavy hammer, carrying the momentum of wind and thunder, slammed down violently.

The moment the face of the hammer touched the top of the old man's head, the old man suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a cloud of purple-black mist.

*Poison!*

Xu Yunfan had to hold his breath and lean back, yet the momentum of the hammer did not diminish in the slightest.

The hammer head grazed past the old man's scalp as he lowered his head just in time, smashing the floor tile into powder.

Amidst the flying debris, Xu Yunfan spun around and delivered a backward hook kick, his heel striking the old man's shoulder blade like a battle-axe.

*Crack!*

The sound of bone fracturing was clear and audible.

The old man stumbled and overturned a screen. When his back hit the wall, he suddenly kicked off it to use the force, his only remaining left hand stabbing like the tail of a scorpion toward Xu Yunfan's throat.

Xu Yunfan didn't dodge or evade. The trapezius muscle on the side of his neck suddenly bulged three inches, forcibly clamping the finger between his muscles!

"Got you."

Xu Yunfan grinned, his blood-stained teeth as white and fierce as a wolf's.

"Wait, we can discuss this! He's just a disciple, not your own son. We can sit down and talk! This isn't a life-and-death grudge, why must we fight to the death!"

The紫袍 (Purple Robed) old man's tone was urgent. He had already seen Xu Yunfan's right hand raise the heavy hammer, the muscles on his arm bulging like ridges, with faint lines of blood appearing between the muscle fibers.

What frightened him most was that he only now realized the opponent wasn't a Second Refining perfection martial master, but clearly a master who had achieved perfection in all three refinements: muscles, bones, and skin.

How many people in the world could possess such a physique!

"You... you've actually achieved perfection in the Three Refinements. My Incense Fire Sect has the Witness of the Gods, which can grant you..."

Listening to the purple-robed old man's words, Xu Yunfan was contemplating how he had overexerted his gums, causing them to bleed slightly. He shouldn't be so reckless next time.

With this thought in mind, the hammer head crashed down.

The moment the old man's skull caved in, the blood mist from his seven orifices splattered against the wall in the shape of a lotus flower.

A good while later, Xu Yunfan knelt on one knee, breathing heavily like an ox, the heavy hammer in his hand still pressing firmly against the corpse.

Xu Yunfan shook the hammer head, shaking off the blood and flesh.

Suddenly, a noise came from the pile of rubble. He threw a broken knife backward, pinning the last black-clad man, who was playing dead, to the pillar.

Yan Yuwei limped over, leaning on her large saber. After the Molten Gold Forging Iron Technique dissipated, the bleeding wounds all over her body were shocking to behold. It wasn't just the work of the Incense Fire Sect minions; the purple-robed old man's earlier strike had almost pierced her through.

If not for the Molten Gold Forging Iron Technique having the effect of hardening the body and mixing with the Metal Refining technique, she would have met her end here.

Fighting an Outer Three-Heavens expert above her level, she still had the confidence to retreat unscathed, but crossing two major realms to fight without retreating, and even gaining the upper hand for a moment, was simply beyond her expectations.

Facing a genius like Xu Yunfan, who could be called a monster, it almost made her martial arts mindset collapse.

Were the wandering disciples from the top sects in the world also like Xu Yunfan, treating crossing realms to fight as easy as eating or drinking?

This was not easy at all.

Aside from the Gilded Tassel Cudgel and the Lin-character State, to kill the purple-robed old man, Xu Yunfan had used all his means. When the old man dragged him into close combat, the opponent's penetrating spiral force drilled frantically into his body.

Every time fists, feet, palms, and claws clashed, it caused significant vibrations within his body.

Even his blood energy was somewhat scattered now, requiring time to regulate it.

This was enough to prove just how powerful the transformation of achieving perfection in the Three Refinements—muscles, bones, and skin—was, as recorded in ancient texts.

She looked at the old man's head embedded in the floor tile, then looked up at the Cui Bo Tower, which was almost a pile of ruins.

"The chefs of Cui Bo Tower are going to cry."

She suddenly stomped her foot down heavily, crushing the purple-robed old man's chest.

*Clang!*

"Ugh!"

Yan Yuwei stumbled back a step, her face flushing red. She truly hadn't expected the purple-robed old man's body to be so tough.

Suddenly, a red falcon flew past the window. Xu Yunfan squinted, watching the black shadow disappear in the blink of an eye.

The autumn wind, carrying the smell of scorching, rushed in through the broken window. The silhouette of the distant Cui Bo City looked somewhat gloomy in the twilight.

He suddenly stood up. As he walked out carrying the heavy hammer, he suddenly stopped.

On the broken eaves of Cui Bo Tower, the last half of a glazed tile fell into the raging sea of fire caused by the oil.

"What's wrong, Senior Brother Xu?"

Seeing Xu Yunfan standing still, Yan Yuwei felt a bit strange and instinctively gripped her large saber, straightening her body.

"Be careful, there's someone outside."

Xu Yunfan dragged the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer out of the ruins, the hammer head plowing a three-inch deep trench in the bluestone road.

His left arm hung unnaturally; he had overexerted himself earlier, causing some soreness. To test his own limits, he had fought the purple-robed old man with extreme ferocity.

He needed time to recover.

Just as he stood at the remaining half of the main gate of Cui Bo Tower, where the steward was shouting to rescue the buried disciples of the Tiangong Cave, a blood-colored banner suddenly rose at the end of the long street.

Three hundred Incense Fire Sect disciples marched in formation, their iron boots trampling the ground. Heavy steel shields struck sparks against the ground.

Between the shields, twelve-foot hook-handled spears protruded, their tips quenched in a venomous blue snake toxin, casting a ghastly, eerie pallor over the entire street.

In addition, there were people dressed in various colors of clothing, their faces filled with pious devotion, crowding in closely behind them.

*Tap, tap, tap...*

A crimson dragon-horse shattered the blue bricks of the street.

The figure on the horseback wore bright armor, two crimson lights透出 from the缝隙 of the face guard.

As the eighteen-foot Asura Spear in his hand was slowly raised, a inch-long blood aura actually condensed at the tip. This was the Blood Energy Penetrating Body and the gathering of mist around the body unique to the Blood Transformation Realm!

Treasure Weapon!

Xu Yunfan's pupils contracted slightly as he stared at the long spear for a moment.

For a spear tip to maintain its aura for so long without fading, only a Treasure Weapon-wielding expert at the Blood Transformation Realm could achieve it.

The Blood Transformation Realm, known in the江湖 as a Famous Expert, could make a name for oneself in a province. Wherever they went, they were an undeniable force of strength.

"Young Hero Xu, do you know that you killed the stupidest of this Sect's Thirty-Six Inspectors?"

The voice from behind the face guard sounded like grinding metal: "But this Lord must thank you. You saved me the trouble of dealing with him according to Sect rules."
