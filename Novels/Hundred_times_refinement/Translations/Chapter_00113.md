# Chapter 63: Heavenly Demon Disguise Art  

The Spiritual Control Technique was only mentioned in intermediate cultivation manuals accessible to Foundation Establishment cultivators. These manuals were kept on the second floor of the library, which low-level disciples like Lin Xuan had no permission to access.  

However, during his trip to the Lingyun Sect, Lin Xuan had managed to obtain two intermediate cultivation manuals—one purchased with spirit stones, and the other looted from the belongings of the Yan father and son.  

Lin Xuan took out two jade slips and infused them with his spiritual sense, carefully reading through them. He skipped the main cultivation techniques, as those required Foundation Establishment cultivation and were useless to him for now. Instead, he focused solely on the sections detailing the Spiritual Control Technique.  

After comparing the two manuals—*Iceheart Mantra*, which he had purchased, and *Purple Sun Primordial Force*, acquired from the Yan family—he found that while the latter was superior overall (originally reserved for the prestigious Wang family before being stolen by Yan Tianheng), the descriptions of the Spiritual Control Technique in both were nearly identical.  

Thus, Lin Xuan didn’t need to deliberate—he simply chose one and began practicing.  

The Spiritual Control Technique was an advanced evolution of the basic Object Control Technique, far more intricate and profound.  

For the next ten days, Lin Xuan struggled immensely. The reason was simple: his cultivation was insufficient. Although the manuals stated that late-stage Qi Refinement disciples were theoretically capable of learning it, in practice, mastering this technique was far easier for Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Failure, however, was nothing new to Lin Xuan. He knew that nothing worthwhile came without effort. Even the Ice Needle Technique had been difficult to master at first.  

With this mindset, he persisted, undeterred by setbacks. Yet, after more than ten days, he had made no progress.  

What frustrated him most was that he couldn’t even pinpoint why he kept failing. Each attempt ended in inexplicable collapse, leaving him to wonder if his talent was simply too lacking.  

But complaining wouldn’t solve anything. He gritted his teeth and continued practicing. A month later, when he emerged from his room, his situation remained unchanged.  

It seemed brute-force practice alone wouldn’t suffice.  

"Should I seek guidance from a senior?"  

Lin Xuan shook his head. In the entire Piaoyun Valley, only a handful of geniuses at the Qi Refinement stage would dare attempt the Spiritual Control Technique. As someone without even a spiritual root, asking such a question would undoubtedly draw unwanted attention.  

---  

*Sigh… If only I could openly display my sixth-layer cultivation and be recognized as an elite disciple.*  

This thought arose because ordinary low-level disciples like him could only attend basic lectures at the Zhiying Pavilion. Elite disciples, however, despite being at the same Qi Refinement stage, were treated differently—they were groomed as future Foundation Establishment candidates and received personalized guidance from senior experts. If Lin Xuan were an elite disciple, he could have sought advice on the Spiritual Control Technique.  

But this was just wishful thinking. Given his circumstances, revealing his true cultivation was out of the question.  

Bored and frustrated, Lin Xuan pulled out the blood-red jade slip and browsed through the demonic cultivation techniques recorded within. While he couldn’t practice the cultivation methods, he could still study the spells that manipulated spiritual energy.  

"Eh?"  

Lin Xuan’s eyebrows shot up, and an expression of startled delight crossed his face. Though no one else was present, few things could make someone as composed as him lose his composure.  

**Heavenly Demon Disguise Art!**  

His spiritual sense locked onto a supplementary spell recorded in the latter part of the manual—a technique created by a demonic cultivator over a thousand years ago.  

According to the description, this spell used spiritual energy to alter one’s appearance and physique. Similar techniques weren’t unfamiliar to Lin Xuan—his own sect had "Disguise Art" and "Shape-Shifting Technique," among others.  

However, such techniques were often dismissed as impractical. The reason? If the opponent’s cultivation surpassed or even matched the caster’s, the disguise could be easily seen through.  

Initially, Lin Xuan hadn’t paid much attention, merely skimming out of boredom. But the introduction of the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art left him ecstatic. The demonic cultivator who created it was a true genius—after studying numerous disguise techniques, he refined their flaws and combined their strengths to create this unparalleled art.  

The brilliance of this technique lay in several advantages:  
1. **Low Barrier to Entry** – It only required mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivation, unlike other disguise techniques that demanded at least Foundation Establishment.  
2. **Superior Concealment** – It solved the critical flaw of being easily detected. To see through this disguise, one needed to be **two major realms** above the caster. For example, if a Qi Refinement cultivator used it, only a Core Formation expert could see through it. If a Foundation Establishment cultivator used it, only a Nascent Soul monster could pierce the illusion.  

---  

The benefits were obvious, but the technique wasn’t without flaws—nothing in the world was perfect.  

First, the duration was extremely short—it could only maintain the disguise for **one hour**, followed by a mandatory **six-hour cooldown** before reuse. This meant it couldn’t be used for prolonged impersonation, only as a short-term measure.  

That was merely the first drawback. Despite its imperfections, it remained a highly practical technique. However, the second flaw had deterred many who had obtained it in the past, causing them to discard it like worthless trash.  

The reason? **It required a rare medicinal herb as a catalyst.** The user had to ingest the herb before activating the technique with spiritual energy for the disguise to succeed.
