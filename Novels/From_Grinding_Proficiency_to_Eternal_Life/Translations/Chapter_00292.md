# Chapter 292: The Challenge Arena

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over a corner where a bronze mace was covered in cracks. Suddenly, he felt the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace in his Marrow Sea tremble. The weapons here actually retained the battle intent of their original owners!

"I heard Junior Brother received a verbal decree from the Master inside the Hall?"

Chu Cangming casually lifted a heavy Dark Iron sword, its blade slicing through the air with a hiss. "Is there anything interesting to share?"

Pretending not to notice the probing tone, Xu Yunfan casually picked up a pair of Meteorite Iron hammers. "The Sect Master has arranged a thirty-six consecutive challenge arena. It begins in three days, and I will be the reigning champion."

When the hammer heads collided, the sparks that flew out looked as if they were spraying water into the air.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh in admiration: 'What fine weapons!'

Even among Treasured Artifacts, this pair of hammers was a rare top-tier item.

Before his words had fully faded, Chu Cangming's knuckles suddenly tightened, and the Dark Iron sword stabbed three inches into the ground with a *zing*.

"So that's how it is."

He suddenly let out a light laugh, a hint of gloom flashing in his eyes. "The arena is a place where swords and blades show no mercy. You must be careful, Junior Brother."

Xu Yunfan's knuckles slowly stroked the star patterns on the hammer handles. Suddenly, he turned his head and stared directly at Chu Cangming, a crimson flame seeming to swirl in his eyes. "Senior Brother seems to be looking forward to me entering the arena?"

Chu Cangming laughed softly upon hearing this, the curve of his lips as sharp as a sword unsheathing, carrying a piercing edge.

He raised his hand and flicked a finger toward a crack in a broken sword beside him. The sword body immediately emitted a mournful hum. Chu Cangming closed his eyes to listen to the colorless sword note, then shook his head slightly, looking at the broken sword with a trace of regret.

"The Dao Sect speaks of 'quiet inaction' on the surface, but in reality, the law of the jungle is the iron rule."

"Sixty years ago, during the incident at the Clear Weave Hall, the Master fought alone against the heads of thirty-six peaks. Nineteen were slain and their Dao dissipated, eleven had their blood and energy wither away. Those who survived are now the guardians of their respective peaks, and the Master became the Sect Master of the Dao Sect."

Xu Yunfan's eyebrows raised slightly. It seemed something extremely significant had happened in the Dao Sect back then. Bi Yuan had actually suppressed the proud and arrogant Dao Sect disciples into silence by himself.

Chu Cangming brushed his sleeves and walked deeper into the cave, his voice ethereal as smoke. "I am merely curious... can your hammer smash the delusions of certain people? They have been holding their breath for a full sixty years."

"Senior Brother..."

Xu Yunfan suddenly spoke.

Chu Cangming turned back at the sound, only to see Xu Yunfan raising his hand to shake the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace on his back, grinning to reveal teeth as white as jade.

"Right now, I use a mace."

His hammer technique was currently somewhat insufficient. At least within the Dao Sect, he hadn't seen much in the way of hammer techniques. Obtaining a mace technique was already quite fortunate. If necessary, he would have to switch to practicing the sword or spear.

The corner of Chu Cangming's eye twitched violently as he looked back. He had好不容易 managed to set his persona and painstakingly created a solemn and murderous atmosphere, only to have this rascal shatter it completely with the most primitive form of showing off!

In the end, Xu Yunfan still chose a Dark Iron sword.

A Treasured Artifact level heavy sword, the blade was three and a half fingers wide, the edge faintly showing star patterns, the hilt could be held easily with two hands, and the blade was very long, almost qualifying as a horse-chopping sword.

Seeing this, Chu Cangming introduced, "This sword is named 'Sinking Mountain.' Even among Treasured Artifacts, it belongs to the upper tier..."

As he spoke, he casually spun the sword, then looked嫌弃地发现 the sword momentum was thirty percent more sluggish than his mace technique.

After all, he hadn't even reached the entry level of the Mountain Cleaving Sword Technique. Most of his time lately had been devoted to the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Transformation Art. Once he stepped into Organ Refining, he could return to his origin and reshape himself, practicing the Nine Stages of Martial Arts over again. With the Nine曜 Swallowing Qi Technique, he could reshape his blood and energy in the Muscle Refining stage, forging a perfect and vigorous blood energy.

Walking out of the Weapon Sword Peak, the sky outside was filled with twilight clouds. Chu Cangming suddenly said, "At the chen hour (7-9 am) three days from now, I will be waiting for you at the training grounds of the Profound Celestial Peak."

With that, he raised his hand and patted Xu Yunfan's shoulder lightly. The internal energy of the 'Golden Pass Jade Lock Technique' hidden in his palm was automatically neutralized by the red light of the Dragon Scale Armor.

Xu Yunfan acted as if he noticed nothing and cupped his fists. "I will not make Senior Brother wait long."

As he turned, the heavy sword deliberately swept across the green stone steps, scraping off stone powder that drifted toward Chu Cangming's hem.

Their eyes met through the dust, and a smile appeared on Chu Cangming's face.

"I'll be waiting for Junior Brother's good news."

Xu Yunfan waved his hand and walked away, humming the blacksmith's tune of the Heavenly Work Cave.

Chu Cangming slightly raised his lowered hand, looking at a line of blood in his palm, then squinted to scrutinize the occasional glimpse of dark gold beneath Xu Yunfan's robe.

"Divine Weapon Armor..."

Chu Cangming's fingers squeezed until they turned white. Up to now, he only possessed a single divine weapon, his sword.

Just as he pushed open the bamboo gate of the courtyard, two figures darted out from under the wisteria架.

Fang Mushan slapped the stone table with his fan-like palm, making it tremble. "Good lad! Everywhere in the Dao Sect now, they're saying you emptied three medicinal peaks in twenty days!"

"When we heard you became the Sect Master's second chief disciple, we were stunned for a long time. Seeing you today, I didn't expect your martial arts to have deepened further..."

Li Haomiao spoke but stared at the new heavy sword at Xu Yunfan's waist. He suddenly drew his own Green Edge sword to compare, eventually becoming somewhat disheartened.

"Damn it, even his sword is better than mine."

"The sword is a good sword," Xu Yunfan said, flicking the blade away with a finger. "It's just that the person using it isn't up to par."

Li Haomiao was angered to shame, but since Xu Yunfan had already entered Marrow Cleansing while he was just struggling in the early Muscle Refining stage, he could only shout that the future was uncertain, that neither of them had a set fate yet.

Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan saw that Xu Yunfan was fine and thus put their minds at ease.

Li Haomiao retracted his smile and said seriously, "About that arena in three days, don't you go capsizing in the ditch. Those Dao Sect guys are holding their breath to watch you make a fool of yourself. Even Zhao Wujiu from the Profound Celestial Peak has put out word that he wants to 'test the quality of the Heavenly Work Cave'."

He clenched his fist until it cracked, then let go in frustration. With his cultivation, just having entered Muscle Refining, he didn't even qualify to be a stepping stone. He wanted to give Xu Yunfan some medicinal pills and resources, but the value of what Xu Yunfan ate in a single meal was enough for him to squander for a month.

Fang Mushan patted Xu Yunfan's shoulder, but the touch felt like hitting Dark Iron, jolting his palm numb.

He was secretly shocked, but said, "That Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace of yours, try not to smash a hole through the arena when the time comes."

With that, he dragged Li Haomiao away. "Let's go, let's go. If we delay any longer, that guy might not be able to practice his mace technique and will probably take it out on us."

Just as the bamboo gate was about to close, Li Haomiao suddenly turned back. "Hey! I heard Chu Cangming is also getting on stage."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed, somewhat surprised. This was the first time he had heard this news.

"I know. I'll be careful then."

The words cut off abruptly. Xu Yunfan was already standing on the green stone in the courtyard, the heavy sword摆横 like a mace. Where the mace edge pointed, an old plum tree three zhang away snapped without any wind.

Xu Yunfan looked up. This year, the cold seemed to arrive earlier than the last.

Three days later, the Profound Celestial Peak. The first snow of this year.

The sharp mountain wind swept broken snow across the training grounds. Below the arena, the crowd was already packed.

Apart from those on duty, the disciples of the thirty-six peaks had mostly gathered here. The dark Dao robes spread over the stone steps like a tide. The whispering voices suddenly froze as they saw Xu Yunfan stepping through the snow to arrive.
