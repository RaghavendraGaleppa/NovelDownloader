# Chapter 67: Off You Go  

Han Yue could hardly believe his ears!  

The entire Divine Thunder Palace had only one hundred and six members?  

And half of them were Longevity True Persons at the fourth rank or above?  

For the first time, Han Yue felt so close to the realm of Longevity True Persons, yet so distant from the ordinary masses.  

The reality of the Divine Thunder Palace far exceeded Han Yue’s expectations, leaving him utterly astonished.  

But since he was here, he might as well make the best of it.  

Everything existed for a reason!  

He would be under the Divine Thunder Palace’s banner for many, many years to come. If he couldn’t figure things out now, there was no need to dwell on it.  

The most crucial thing was to obtain the Longevity inheritance first!  

That was the real matter concerning his path to immortality!  

Without hesitation, Han Yue asked Miaolin directly:  

“Mumu, when can I receive the Longevity inheritance?”  

“Senior Uncle, I can take you there right now.”  

“The Grandmaster assigned me two tasks: the first was to familiarize you with the Divine Thunder Palace’s affairs, and the second was to take you to receive the sect’s inheritance!”  

“Then let’s go now!” Han Yue couldn’t wait any longer.  

Mummu was equally straightforward.  

After quickly finishing the red fruit in her hand, she led Han Yue out of the house.  

She asked if Han Yue had mastered any flight techniques, and upon receiving confirmation, she changed their route.  

The two arrived at the deep pit beside the small house, standing next to the enormous bronze sphere.  

Wang Mummu picked up the chain connected to the bronze sphere.  

The other end of the chain was attached to a wide leather belt.  

She then unfastened the belt and securely tied it around her waist.  

“Senior Uncle, meet me at the Black Dragon’s mouth!”  

Mummu pointed to the distant peak’s summit, where the Black Dragon’s gaping maw was visible.  

“I’ll go first and wait for you there!”  

With that, Mummu assumed a shallow horse stance, gently embracing the massive bronze sphere before her.  

Then, she uttered softly:  

“Off you go!”  

In an instant, an overwhelming force erupted from her small frame!  

The enormous bronze sphere, half again her height, was launched like a colossal cannonball, hurtling toward the dragon’s head!  

Mummu’s tiny body, tethered by the chain, followed the sphere’s trajectory through the air!  

This was the true meaning of “strength defies logic”!  

Despite not yet reaching the second rank and lacking flight techniques, Mummu had devised her own method to traverse mountains and rivers!  

The supreme divine ability—**[Dragon Elephant]**!  

The ultimate dream of countless bloodline cultivators!  

And now, it was manifested in a petite Thunder Cultivator of the Divine Thunder Palace!  

A deafening metallic crash echoed from the dragon’s head, reverberating across the three mountains and single river.  

The sound jolted Han Yue back to his senses!  

Mummu’s dazzling display once again broadened his horizons!  

This junior sect member was the first major sect cultivator Han Yue had encountered who had mastered the **[Body Refining]** realm!  

Truly worthy of a disciple from a major sect—her combat prowess was extraordinary!  

The four pillars of cultivation—techniques, spells, physique, and artifacts—were all perfectly embodied in Mummu!  

As a disciple of the Divine Thunder Palace, she possessed top-tier heritage, wielded formidable divine abilities, and could vastly amplify her physical strength.  

Once she advanced to the second rank, comprehended more inherited divine abilities, and refined her Dao artifacts, she would undoubtedly become a powerhouse far surpassing her peers!  

Han Yue couldn’t help but grow even more excited about his own future path.  

He soared into the sky on a beam of light, arriving at the Black Dragon’s mouth in the blink of an eye.  

Here, another massive pit awaited.  

At the bottom, Mummu was unbuckling her belt.  

Clearly, she had made this trip via the bronze sphere many times before.  

By the time Mummu hopped out of the pit, Han Yue had already landed and was waiting.  

She led him straight into the dragon’s maw.  

As they walked, Mummu explained:  

“Senior Uncle, this Black Dragon coiled around the Floating Peak is actually one of our sect’s seniors—one of the fifty-three Longevity True Persons, with the Dharma name **[Chuanzong]**.”  

“Senior **[Chuanzong]**’s origin traces back tens of thousands of years, when he was a Dao artifact refined by a Longevity True Person of our sect.”  

“Originally, he was a **[Supreme Cave True Thunder Dragon-Subduing Rope]**, which the original master successfully refined to the fourth-rank Longevity realm!”  

“Later, that Longevity True Person perished unexpectedly, but Senior **[Chuanzong]** remained and was inherited by the sect leader of that era.”  

“Because this senior loved reading and disliked moving, he was assigned by the sect leader to guard the sect’s inheritance and secret vaults!”  

“With each successive sect leader, **[Chuanzong]** was passed down through the generations.”  

“Thus, his role as the guardian of the inheritance was preserved, passed down from one leader to the next!”  

“To this day, it has been tens of thousands of years! Senior **[Chuanzong]** remembers every person and event in the Divine Thunder Palace’s history over these millennia. He is the most erudite, wisest, and kindest Longevity True Person in our sect!”  

“Moreover, **[Chuanzong]** has never left the Floating Peak. Even through several great battles, he has always ensured the safety of the sect’s heritage. He is the true final line of defense for our sect’s legacy!”  

Mummu recounted **[Chuanzong]**’s history with great enthusiasm, her eyes sparkling.  

Han Yue nodded repeatedly as he listened.  

Mummu continued:  

“What’s more, the countless volumes of scriptures in our sect’s inheritance archives have been read by **[Chuanzong]** countless times. As a Longevity True Person, his Dao methods are profound, and his understanding of the archives is thorough. He is truly the best mentor for new disciples of the Divine Thunder Palace!”  

“For generations, countless disciples, though they had their own masters, were initially guided by **[Chuanzong]**.”  

“Senior Uncle, if you encounter any questions in your cultivation, you can always seek **[Chuanzong]**’s guidance!”  

“I’ve never once encountered a question he couldn’t answer!”  

“If you ask who the strongest True Person in the Divine Thunder Palace is, I couldn’t say—many of them left the **[Jade Void Realm]** and may only return once every ten thousand years!”  

“But if you ask who is the most beloved, it has to be our **[Chuanzong]**!”  

Han Yue wholeheartedly agreed with Mummu’s words!  

This top-tier sect truly had an impeccable system of inheritance!  

With a Longevity True Person like **[Chuanzong]** guarding and nurturing disciples, how could the Divine Thunder Palace’s legacy ever decline?  

This wasn’t just about the strength of the inheritance itself—it was also the absolute advancement of the transmission method!  

Hearing this, Han Yue began to understand why such a grand fifth-rank sect had so few members.  

With a top-tier inheritance system, as long as it was paired with the most exceptional talents, the sect could cultivate the most formidable cultivators.  

The current state of the Divine Thunder Palace’s inheritance was the result of natural optimization over tens of thousands of years!  

Because the sect had absolute confidence in its ability to perpetuate its legacy, it would rather have no disciples at all than accept unworthy ones!  

With such an advanced inheritance system, the sect would always produce great cultivators. In a world where power resided in the individual, nurturing a single supreme expert was far more valuable than raising countless low-level cultivators!
