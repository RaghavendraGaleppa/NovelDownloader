# Chapter 105: Treasure Hunt Gathering  

Blackwind Mountain sprawled across northern Youzhou, stretching hundreds of miles with towering peaks and abundant resources. Despite its richness, the area was sparsely populated due to the prevalence of demonic beasts. Though most were only first-tier, they were still far beyond what ordinary people could handle.  

Three days later, Lin Xuan descended upon Blackwind Mountain in a streak of light.  

Though the demonic beasts were fierce, their bodies were treasure troves of valuable materials. Lin Xuan had come here in search of a rare ingredient.  

Suddenly, a massive explosion erupted in the distance, followed by a dazzling radiance.  

Lin Xuan, who had been about to set off, paused. After a brief hesitation, he flew toward the commotion.  

At the foot of a solitary peak, where dense forests once stood, a large clearing had been blasted open by spells. Three young cultivators, around twenty years old, were locked in a fierce battle with a demonic beast.  

Despite their numerical advantage, the trio was in dire straits.  

Lin Xuan assessed their cultivation levels and shook his head. Truly, the young fear no danger—with such meager strength, they dared to provoke demonic beasts in Blackwind Mountain.  

The two slightly older men were identical twins, both at the mid-stage of the Spirit Movement Realm. The third was a young girl, barely sixteen, whose cultivation had only reached the third layer of the Spirit Movement Realm.  

Their opponent was a giant horned serpent, thicker than a water barrel. Though Lin Xuan didn’t recognize the species, its aura alone marked it as a first-tier, upper-grade monster.  

The beast spewed dark green venom, reeking of decay, and the three were barely holding their ground.  

"Little sister, run! We’ll hold it off!"  

"No, brothers! If we die, we die together!"  

As time passed, their resistance weakened. The serpent opened its maw, poised to swallow the girl whole. Lin Xuan’s brow twitched, and he finally chose to intervene.  

Countless ice needles, gleaming with a chilling light, rained down.  

The once-arrogant demonic beast was riddled with holes and collapsed with a thunderous crash.  

Lin Xuan nodded. After reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, his strength had indeed increased significantly. Now, he could effortlessly conjure five hundred ice needles with the Ice Needle Technique.  

The three low-level cultivators, who had resigned themselves to death, were stunned by the sudden turn of events. Though their savior appeared to be a young man around twenty, his casual ease in effortlessly slaying a first-tier, upper-grade beast left no doubt—he was a Foundation Establishment expert.  

After steadying their nerves, the trio bowed deeply, their faces filled with gratitude. "Greetings, Senior! Thank you for saving us!"  

"Hmm." Lin Xuan maintained a calm expression, though inwardly, he relished the respect that came with being a powerful figure. He studied them for a moment. "With your cultivation levels, you dare to venture into Blackwind Mountain? Do you have a death wish?"  

Though his tone was reproachful, as their savior and a superior cultivator, the siblings didn’t dare show the slightest displeasure.  

The man on the left sighed. "You’re right, Senior. We overestimated ourselves. We came here to hunt some demonic beasts to trade for talismans and spirit stones at the 'Treasure Hunt Gathering.'"  

"Treasure Hunt Gathering?" Lin Xuan was taken aback. He had never heard of such a thing. "What’s that?"  

The siblings exchanged glances, looking slightly embarrassed. "Ah, it’s just a gathering among low-level cultivators. It wouldn’t interest someone like you, Senior."  

"Tell me about it."  

"Very well. Since you wish to know, we’ll explain in full." The man on the left cleared his throat and began recounting the details...  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan transformed into a streak of light, heading toward the location they had described.  

The Treasure Hunt Gathering had piqued his interest. In truth, the so-called "treasure hunt" was a euphemism low-level cultivators used to dignify what high-level cultivators mockingly referred to as the "Junk Exchange."  

Compared to Yanzhou, Youzhou’s cultivation world was more advanced, with marketplaces catering to cultivators’ needs. In these markets, almost anything could be bought with spirit stones—except for cultivation-enhancing pills and exceptionally powerful treasures.  

While this sounded convenient, few low-level cultivators frequented these markets. The reason was simple: most were poor. Aside from elite disciples of major sects or scions of prominent families, ordinary rogue cultivators or those from minor sects rarely had enough spirit stones to spare.  

At the Spirit Movement stage, hunting demonic beasts or gathering rare herbs was difficult, yet they needed Body Cleansing Pills for cultivation.  

Without spirit stones, how could low-level cultivators acquire what they needed? Some clever individuals came up with a solution: periodic gatherings where they traded their unwanted items. It was a last resort, but it worked—what one person considered trash might be another’s urgent necessity.  

Unlike markets, the items at these gatherings were unpredictable, requiring attendees to sift through them—hence the name "Treasure Hunt."  

To high-level cultivators, however, ninety percent of the items here were worthless.  

But Lin Xuan was different. With his purification ability, materials and pills discarded as trash by others could become treasures in his hands.  

If this was a treasure hunt, then he would see if he could truly find something valuable.  

After reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, Lin Xuan’s speed had increased significantly. He covered the two-hundred-mile distance in less than half an hour.  

Halting mid-air, he surveyed the terrain below. This was the place.  

Descending, he took a sip of Red Vine Grass elixir to suppress his cultivation to the mid-stage of the Spirit Movement Realm. Then, he used the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art to alter his appearance.  

Though the siblings had mentioned that occasionally, down-on-their-luck Foundation Establishment cultivators would visit these gatherings, their presence always drew attention. Lin Xuan had no desire to become the center of attention—it was safer to blend in as a low-level cultivator.  

Using the Wind Riding Technique, he traveled another twenty miles until a simple illusionary barrier appeared before him. A faint smile crossed Lin Xuan’s face.  

He had arrived.
