# Chapter 111: Each with Their Own Thoughts

Her expression flickered between shock and suspicion as she stared at the heavy hammer in Xu Yunfan's hand, its surface etched with faint, crimson patterns resembling molten lava.

"A Divine Weapon?! No, you actually possess a Treasure Artifact?!"

Her face instantly twisted, a mixture of envy, hatred, and malice carving it into a hideous mask.

Xu Yunfan wasted no time. The sole of his boot kicked off the ground, and his body shot forward like an arrow released from a bow, charging straight at the old woman.

Seeing Xu Yunfan rushing in with the hammer raised, the chain-blade in the old woman's hand became a blur of iron. However, the shaft of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer suddenly split apart, transforming into three chained segments.

The moment the chain forged from Thunder纹 Steel entangled the chain-blade, Xu Yunfan's arm muscles bulged violently. He unleashed the ninth form of the Cloak Hammer Style, "Iron Lock Blocking the River," with full force.

Sparks erupted where the two brute forces clashed, scorching the bluestone floor within a zhang radius with blackened marks.

"Let go!"

The old woman suddenly pressed a mechanism on her staff's head. Three poison needles shot out from the eye sockets of a skull carving.

Xu Yunfan ducked sharply. The needles grazed his scalp and embedded themselves into the bluestone wall beside him; the accompanying gust of wind was so sharp it severed the iron ring holding his hair in place.

But this moment of distraction cost him; the chain was pulled taut, revealing a half-foot opening.

Xu Yunfan's wrist flicked, extending the chain hammer. As the old woman was thrown off-balance and leaned back due to inertia, the chain retracted and snapped shut. Surging with vital energy, he took several heavy steps backward. The friction against the chain-blade in the old woman's hand sent a shower of sparks flying.

"Break!"

Xu Yunfan let out a low roar. The muscles on his right arm swelled into hard lumps, blood and energy surging through them until they looked like fleshy tumors, the fibers shimmering with faint golden lines.

*Clang!*

The fine steel chain-blade was snapped clean in two.

The old woman stumbled back several steps, each step cracking the bluestone tiles like spiderwebs.

Before she could regain her balance, Xu Yunfan closed the distance. The crisp sound of his hand-knife striking her throat rang out at the same moment as the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer hit the ground with a deafening thud.

The remaining cultists attempted to surround him, but Xu Yunfan's spine suddenly cracked loudly, segment by segment. His back muscles flared out like wings as he swung the heavy hammer into the ground. The rebounding force created a shockwave that overturned roof tiles and shattered the remaining disciples into unrecognizable shapes.

The hum of the rebounding mechanism resonated with his heaving chest.

"It seems the Heavenly Cavern has people from your Incense Fire Cult among its ranks too?"

Xu Yunfan swung his hammer, sweeping away a disciple who, despite being tattered and broken, was still charging recklessly. Severed limbs struck the wall, sparking before finally falling silent at the entrance of the荒门 (Desolate Gate).

The old woman clutched her throat, coughing up blood foam with a vicious grin. She tore open her clothes to reveal a bronze compass on her chest.

"The Holy Sect will eventually trample over these filthy places. When the Ming Lord descends, he shall cleanse everything!"

The compass mechanism sprang open, and hundreds of poisoned steel needles shot out like a rainstorm. The phosphorus on the needle tips ignited into ghostly blue flames upon contact with the air.

Xu Yunfan, already on guard, pushed off with his feet. His body moved like a green smoke, easily dodging the needles.

Seeing the old woman trying to escape, Xu Yunfan's wrist flicked. The middle section of the hammer handle split into three chain segments. Tungsteel ropes entangled the old woman's right leg and slammed her into a beam.

After three heavy impacts, the roof beam groaned under the strain, and the entire courtyard began to tilt and collapse.

By the time the patrolling disciples of the Heavenly Cavern arrived, Xu Yunfan was dragging a twisted and deformed bronze compass out of the ruins. He lined up the twelve mangled corpses of the Incense Fire Cult disciples, the exposed flesh at their severed ends still dripping with fresh brain matter.

After showing his Disciple Token from the Casting Hall, Xu Yunfan stood to the side, letting the patrolling disciples handle the cleanup.

"Huh? Why is there a statue of the Ming Lord from the Incense Fire Cult here?"

"Did we invite the Incense Fire Cult to the True Disciple Ceremony?" Another disciple looked confused, turning his head to look at Xu Yunfan, who was calmly cleaning the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer.

This Senior Brother's methods were incredibly violent; none of the dead bodies were intact.

"You idiot!" The leader of the patrol slapped the back of the talking disciple's head. "The Incense Fire Cult is designated as a heretical sect by the Great Zhou. How could our Heavenly Cavern, a reputable orthodox sect, associate with them? We'll have the Punishment Hall of the Hidden Blade Pavilion come and take a look later."

*Boom!*

A deafening roar suddenly shook the air.

Xu Yunfan looked toward the south of the city. There, a pillar of fire shot straight into the sky. Immediately after, a visible wave of energy flew from deep within the Heavenly Cavern, forcefully suppressing the fire.

"Who dares to cause trouble in the Heavenly Cavern?!"

The voice of Hong Baichuan rang out. Xu Yunfan, who had been planning to go check it out, immediately stopped.

A Bone Marrow Refining Master wielding a Treasure Artifact出手 (made a move). If he still couldn't resolve the situation, Xu Yunfan going there would just be throwing his life away. It was better to stay put and observe the situation.

Xu Yunfan turned his gaze toward the Casting Hall驻地 (encampment). His Master and Senior Brother Fu should be fine; they shouldn't be affected.

When the towering fire in the south was completely suppressed, Xu Yunfan was crouching at the head of the Vermilion Bird Bridge, munching on his fifth skewer of grilled kidneys. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer lay across his knees. His vital energy hadn't settled; rather, it remained coiled like a fierce beast, lying in wait.

He suddenly reached out and caught a sword sheath flying through the air. The seven-foot steel sword case smashed the bluestone slab, causing it to crack. Qi Huan's voice came from the other end of the bridge: "The Disciplinary Hall wants to ask you some questions."

"Has the Hidden Blade Pavilion turned into a constable office?"

Xu Yunfan licked the spicy oil from the corner of his mouth, tilting the hammer head to point at the crack in the sword case.

Qi Huan's knuckles gripping the sword turned white. He wanted to lash out, but seemed to remember something. He took a deep breath and said calmly, "The Thousand Mechanisms Disk you smashed was produced by the Mechanism Hall. Three months ago, they reported it stolen."

The night wind lifted Qi Huan's hem, revealing a new iron badge with the character 'Discipline' at his waist. This chief disciple of the Hidden Blade Pavilion was temporarily acting as the Disciplinary Officer.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow at this. This was clearly meant for him to see.

However.

Xu Yunfan suddenly spun around and swung his hammer. The hammer head trailed the chain, creating a dull whistling sound as it flew past Qi Huan's ear. The wind pressure generated by its passage snapped a willow tree three zhang away in half, sending a black shadow flying into the river beside it. Water splashed three zhang high.

Xu Yunfan's wrist flicked, and the chain hammer flew back instantly, transforming back into a heavy hammer held in his hand.

Qi Huan's eye twitched slightly at the sight. He knew perfectly well that Xu Yunfan had done that on purpose.

"Xu Yunfan!" The head of the Mechanism Hall disciple surfaced from the water, roaring like thunder. "If my Black Tortoise Shield gets water inside, you won't be able to pay for it even if you dismantle yourself!"

墨十三 (Mo Shisan), looking like a drowned rat, climbed onto the shore holding half a mechanical wing. "Surname Xu! I am the chief disciple of the Mechanism Hall, here specifically to inspect the Thousand Mechanisms Disk. How dare you attack without asking questions? If I hadn't activated my玄鳞甲 (Black Scale Armor) in time, you'd be waiting to take the blame!"

Xu Yunfan was a little surprised. Although this strike wasn't his full power, it still carried five-tenths of his strength. An ordinary Three-Training martial artist wouldn't be able to take it, let alone Mo Shisan, who seemed completely unharmed.

The chief disciple of the Mechanism Hall...

He really did have some skills.
