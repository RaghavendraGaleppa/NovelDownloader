# Chapter 289: What's Wrong with Being Protected Once? The Ice Cube's Head Buzzing (1/2)

Dusk was falling.

Inside the Mountain Lord Temple, the light of the bonfire had long been overshadowed by the radiance of the Jade Phoenix God.

Li Mo sat alone before the offering table, gazing at the remaining True Blood in his System Space.

"Lu Wu... Bai Ze... Xie Zhi..."

With the Jade Phoenix God's assistance, he no longer had to agonize over which True Spirit to merge into the Seventy-Two Transformations. He simply needed to prepare the True Blood in advance.

First, he took out the Moon Essence Crystal. Observing the Great Yin Divine Intent, he replenished his Soul Intent and adjusted his condition to its peak.

About half an hour later.

Amidst various phenomena, a spiritual beast leaped forth: a tiger's head, green hair, a body of white fur, and a single horn on its head. It was the choice made for him by the Jade Phoenix God.

"Bai Ze..."

Li Mo gazed intently at the True Spirit.

The various spiritual charms within its bloodline surged into his mind like a spring.

This Bai Ze True Spirit contained none of the ferocity of a demonic beast; on the contrary, it was extremely gentle and amiable.

A moment later.

Little Li had transformed into Bai Ze Little Li. The Seventy-Two Transformations had added another variation.

"Bai Ze seems to be extremely sensitive to the thoughts of others..."

"If the person's mind isn't strong enough, can it even know what the other party is thinking?"

The power of Bai Ze's bloodline was quite useful. Paired with the Eye of Divine Fate, the effect was excellent; it was as if he could strip the other party bare.

Unfortunately, the characteristics of each transformation cannot be used while in human form.

Thinking this, Li Mo stood up.

Under the cold moon.

Ying Bing sat at a portable tea table, exuding that familiar, serene, and sacred aura. She gently sipped her tea, her frosty eyes observing the surroundings.

But when she saw the youth emerge from the temple, her gaze softened visibly.

"Are you cold?"

Li Mo subconsciously forgot about her constitution, took off his outer robe, and draped it over her shoulders.

Ying Bing reached out and touched the robe. Her delicate nose twitched slightly, but in the end, she only tightened the collar.

"The wind is a bit strong."

"Go ahead. Your safety is entrusted to me."

Li Mo gave a thumbs-up and laughed, looking very reliable.

The two switched places. Ying Bing walked into the Mountain Lord Temple and glanced back. She saw the youth pick up the tea cup she had left there and take a sip. An inexplicable sense of peace surged in her heart.

It was best to be able to focus all her energy on observing the Divine Intent. If he sat there, she could probably rest assured.

"If there's any movement, blow the Jade Feather Whistle."

"With me here, there will be no accidents."

Li Mo shook the red string on his wrist, indicating that he understood.

Ying Bing left the temple door slightly ajar.

She didn't rush to activate the Jade Phoenix God but looked out through the crack in the door.

Little Li sat there seriously, his face full of solemnity.

A moment later, hearing the sound of leaves rustling, his figure flashed, and he stood on a certain tree. Realizing it was just a bird, he clicked his tongue, seemingly mocking himself for being too nervous.

But he had barely sat back down for long when the grass rustled again. A few breaths later, he returned holding a rabbit.

He was even muttering about whether to eat roasted rabbit for breakfast tomorrow.

Ying Bing's eyes, illuminated by a ray of moonlight, clearly flashed with a hint of amusement.

Only then did she, draped in that robe, activate the Jade Phoenix God.

All her attention was placed on the Hundred Birds True Spirit.

Time passed slowly.

Gradually, night deepened.

"Hm?"

Li Mo opened his eyes. An abnormal sound of flapping wings came from his ear.

He reached out and grabbed the flapping little bird. It was a thumb-sized bird, somewhat similar to a hummingbird.

"Chirp! Chirp!"

"I'm here to deliver a message from Clan Leader Shang!"

The hummingbird twisted its little head, its voice muffled.

"Sorry, sorry."

When Li Mo let go, the hummingbird looked at him with a human-like expression of anger.

"What did Clan Leader Shang say?" Li Mo had no time to care about a bird's mood.

"Two Level 6 Calamity Beasts are about to come cause you trouble!"

Li Mo frowned and became serious.

Shang Qinqing had said they wouldn't encounter any Demon Kings.

But in fact, since they set out, they hadn't even seen a Level 5 or 6 Calamity Beast.

Who would have thought that two would appear at once, as if they had made an appointment.

Level 6 is equivalent to a human's Inner Scene.

"Two Inner Scenes..."

---

Sensing the fluctuations of the Divine Intent being observed behind him, Li Mo put aside the thought of blowing the Jade Feather Whistle.

First, the Ice Cube was at a critical moment.

Secondly, he wanted to test his current level.

The top ten prodigies on the Hidden Dragon List could all fight Inner Scenes to the death.

What about two?

The hummingbird demon wanted to say something else, but suddenly its feathers stood on end, and it shivered before quickly scurrying away.

The next moment.

"Hehehe..."

"Mwahahaha..."

The ground trembled. Two huge, indistinct black shadows appeared not far away.

One was a four-headed giant snake, its body exuding a strong, pungent stench. Wherever it passed, the vegetation withered. Li Mo was quite familiar with this true form.

The other Calamity Beast was also a snake, with six feet and four wings. Even the dew couldn't stay around it. Standing dozens of zhang away, it made one's throat feel dry.

It felt like having the air conditioner on all night, waking up to find the water finished, and going downstairs to buy water under the blazing sun...

"Xiangliu clan, Feiyi clan?"

Li Mo had seen the True Spirits of these two races within the Jade Phoenix God.

Seeing him standing alone there, the four heads of the ferocious Xiangliu all revealed a hint of bloodlust.

"So it was you who blew up our Young Clan Leader's head? Good, good, good..."

"The light of the Heavenly Outer Divine Jade... Eat... Eat you both!"

Feiyi looked greedily at the divine temple.

Both Calamity Beasts were highly aggressive.

Little Li pondered for a moment.

He decided to first figure out why the two of them had chased after them together.

Secret Art!

I know you're in a hurry, but don't be in a hurry.

Ahem... Actually, it's the mind-clearing property of the Great Yin's Pure Radiance.

The Pure Radiance enveloped them. This wasn't an attack with any destructive power. Even if the opponent's cultivation was higher, they couldn't defend against it.

"I don't know what you taste like... Aba aba..."

"Jade from beyond the heavens... Hehehe... Hm?"

Xiangliu and Feiyi suddenly entered a state of sage-like calm.

All the negative emotions in their hearts seemed to vanish instantly.

Seeing that the effect had taken hold, Li Mo asked:

"You two are quite the coincidence, showing up together."

"Telling you is fine."

All four of Xiangliu's heads spoke at once: "There aren't just two of us. There are four Level 6 demon beasts in total, all agreed to come take your life."

"We just got here first. Thinking there was no need to wait for those good-for-nothings, the two of us figured we could just finish you off."

In Feiyi's strange laughter, its greed resurfaced.

Four Level 6 Calamity Beasts?

Li Mo narrowed his eyes:

"Who are the other two?"

"River overturning crocodile, nine-headed bird..." Feiyi was in the middle of speaking.

The killing intent in Xiangliu's heart couldn't be suppressed any longer. It said coldly, "You two are doomed to die tonight. Surrender, and I'll give you a quick death."

"The matter of the Divine Jade can wait. I have another question."

Little Li's nonchalant words came again:

"There's only one Divine Jade. How do you plan to... divide it?"

The ultimate art of fighting.

If there are multiple enemies, try to sow discord.

While Little Li was keeping the two great demons occupied.

Inside the room, Ying Bing's eyes opened a slit, her gaze flickering faintly.

How could she not know about the commotion outside?

Just that.

Li Mo hadn't blown the Jade Feather Whistle yet.

She was also curious.

Could Li Mo, with all his strength, defeat two Inner Scenes?

But would there be danger?

Two little figures appeared on Ying Bing's shoulders, both looking like herself.

One, with a cold little face, said, "Men have their pride, especially in front of the woman they love. Don't you like seeing him descend like a god? What's wrong with being protected once in a while?"

The other, with a face full of worry, said, "He's so childish. What if he gets hurt? What if he loses an arm or a leg? Won't you regret it to death then?"

The two little figures argued back and forth.

Ying Bing's usually cold and spirited eyes showed a rare hint of confusion.
