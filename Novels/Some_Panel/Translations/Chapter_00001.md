# Chapter 1: Please, Master, Be On Your Way

"Cough cough! This master's great limit has arrived. Before dying, disciple, can you answer me one question?"

"Master, please speak!"

"If this master were to seize your body, would you kill me?"

"Yes!" came a resolute answer.

"What a sin! I am your master. I taught you cultivation techniques, provided for your cultivation, and you won't even let this master seize your body?"

"Stop complaining. Quickly, see if this urn is good enough? If not, I'll get another one." Yang Ji glanced at him sideways, raising the palm-sized medicine bottle in his hand.

"Evil disciple! Should this master stuff his remaining ashes into your mouth?"

The old man slumped in the large chair was on his last breath, twitching, so angry he coughed up blood.

"I never thought that I, Luo Xiong, who plotted my entire life, would ultimately fall into the hands of a novice like you. I kidnapped you from a young age, prevented you from contact with the outside world. Your life should have been as pure as a blank sheet of paper, how could you be even more sinister than me?"

The old man, looking sickly, white-haired, and utterly drained of vitality, coughed up blood while gripping the long sword plunged into his chest, muttering bitterly.

"Does Master have any last words? If not, please be on your way." Yang Ji said indifferently.

"This master feels so aggrieved! I clearly fed you a gu worm, how come nothing happened to you?" The old man's suppressed frustration turned into old blood, trickling from the corner of his mouth.

"Because... I didn't eat it at all." Yang Ji chuckled.

"Impossible, absolutely impossible! I can sense the gu worm is on you." Luo Xiong rasped, his voice strained.

"Oh, are you talking about this? I have it to thank for providing cover for me." Yang Ji smiled faintly, pulling a frog from his embrace.

It now had bulging, askew eyes, its long tongue sticking out, its face clearly expressing an unwillingness to die in peace.

"The gu worm is inside *it*? How did you see through it? I gave you pills to eat, provided for your cultivation, and you actually guarded against me? Evil disciple!" Luo Xiong pounded his chest and stamped his feet, hatred surging.

At the same time, his heart was filled with utter confusion. "I gave you so many pills; how did you accurately identify the one containing the gu worm?"

"The pill you gave me had the words [Gu Worm] floating so big above it. Only a fool would eat it." Yang Ji gave him a sidelong glance, truly annoyed.

"What did you say? Words floating above the pill?" Luo Xiong's pupils contracted slightly, confusion in his heart.

"That's my golden finger." Yang Ji said casually.

"What's a golden finger?"

"Sigh, you wouldn't understand even if I told you." Yang Ji shook his head. He was actually quite dissatisfied with this golden finger. It couldn't cultivate spirit herbs like the small green bottle, couldn't perform gacha or check-ins; it could only display information that he saw with his eyes.

For instance, if he looked at the nearby furnace fire, the words [Mortal Flame, remaining burn time: one shichen] would appear. If firewood was added, the information display would change to [Mortal Flame, remaining burn time: three shichen]. Looking at the medicine bottles and herbs on the table, just a glance would show information: [Tier 1 Anesthetic Powder, can numb], [Tier 1 Hemostatic Powder, can stop bleeding], [Thirty-year Bloodvine, can invigorate blood and promote fluids]. Year, effect, and grade would all be displayed. Looking at the sky: [The sky is a bit dim, light rain will fall after one shichen]. Looking at the dead frog in his hand: [Dead for fifty breaths, died from gu worm].

Even for people, similar information displays would appear. For example, Luo Xiong's display above his head had constantly changed over the past dozen years: [Foundation Damaged], [Despair], [Hope], [Feeding], [Hypocrisy], [Cultivation Dropped, Qi Condensation Layer 5], and so on. This was similar to WeChat statuses: [Delighted], [Cracked], [Praying for Koi], [Tired], [Lying Flat], and so on.

Yang Ji had studied these information displays for eighteen years. Aside from bringing him some convenience, they seemed to offer no further benefits. However, today, he had a great change of heart about his golden finger. It allowed him to avoid misfortune, turn danger into safety, and counter Luo Xiong.

"Evil disciple, this master was always kind and gentle towards you, hiding my emotions perfectly. How did you know I was going to seize your body, and you actually guarded against me?" Luo Xiong said bitterly. He truly couldn't understand how a "blank sheet of paper" who had been "softly imprisoned" by him for eighteen years, unfamiliar with the ways of the world, could have seen through his scheme.

"You had the words [Body Seizure] floating above your head every day, and I'm not blind. Master, I must say, I really was terrified by you all these years. You walked around in front of me with [Body Seizure] constantly above your head – wasn't that creepy? I'd break out in cold sweats even in broad daylight." Yang Ji gnashed his teeth, clearly still shaken.

"Words [Body Seizure] above my head? Was that again discovered by your damned golden finger?" Luo Xiong couldn't help but cough up some old blood, feeling indignant.

"Since we've cleared things up, then be on your way!" Yang Ji stared intently.

"Evil disciple, can't you let this master just die naturally?" Seemingly resigned to his fate, Luo Xiong let out a long sigh. "Sigh, I thought I'd kidnapped a white lamb, but it turned out to be a wolf. This master put his trust in the wrong person."

"This master has one more question. Even if you knew I was going to seize your body, it's been over ten years; how did you know I would make my move today?"

"You preemptively stabbed me with a sword, truly catching this master off guard. The timing was simply too perfect."

Yang Ji gave him a sidelong glance and said, "The moment you entered, I saw [Great Limit Countdown: Half an Incense Stick] floating above your head. With that, if I didn't strike first, would you take me for a fool?"

"Pfft!"

"It's your golden finger again? It truly is this master's lifelong enemy." Luo Xiong was choked with indignation, and indeed, a mouthful of old blood spurted from his mouth, splattering the floor. He had thought his plan was flawless, yet in someone else's eyes, it was like a young woman streaking naked. Not only was he seen completely exposed, but he was also thoroughly trampled. It was truly losing both the wife and the army, a complete and utter loss.

"Sigh!" Luo Xiong sighed deeply, then raised his head, looking resentfully at the harmless, handsome disciple before him. He said, "This master's last question: I never taught you any spells. Why was the sword strike you dealt this master so fast and accurate? So fierce and ruthless?"

Yang Ji chuckled inwardly and casually said, "Swordplay? Everyone where I'm from knows it!" Before he transmigrated, he was a man who had bought a shark tooth sword from a Douyin livestream. He had leveled three rapeseed fields and cut through two small groves of trees. His eighteen basic sword moves had reached the pinnacle of perfection. After coming to the cultivation world for eighteen years, he had practiced madly day after day, spurred on by the words [Body Seizure]. It wasn't a spell, but it surpassed one.

Now that he cultivated an immortal family technique, a sword strike enhanced by spiritual energy possessed immense power. A single strike broke through Luo Xiong's protective spiritual energy. Of course, the most important reason was that Luo Xiong was already old and frail. His foundation was severely damaged, and his original cultivation of Qi Condensation Layer 8 had fallen to Qi Condensation Layer 5. Now, Yang Ji, also at Qi Condensation Layer 5, naturally had no fear of him.

At this moment, looking at [Great Limit Countdown: Ten Breaths] floating above Luo Xiong's head, fragments of the past flowed through Yang Ji's mind. He couldn't help but sigh: "No matter what, we were master and disciple for a time. If you have any last words, speak them quickly."

"Burn a few paper figures of yourself for this master, so I won't be lonely down below." Luo Xiong's old eyes widened, he uttered these words, then his head slumped.

"Hah! This, your disciple cannot obey. However, I can burn a few more Dao companions for Master instead." Yang Ji shrugged helplessly, looking at the corpse before him. His entire spirit and body relaxed.
