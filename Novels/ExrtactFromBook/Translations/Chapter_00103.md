# Chapter 101: River-Splitting Rain Transformation Art

Han smiled casually and said to Qiqi:  

"Fellow Daoist Qiqi's strength is extraordinary, truly worthy of being a true disciple of a major sect!"  

"I am Yuanchu of the Divine Thunder Palace, the contracted master of that foolish bear from earlier."  

"It acted recklessly in provoking you and has received its due punishment."  

"However, these bees before us were gathered through our hard work. For Fellow Daoist Qiqi to take them like this is rather unpleasant."  

"Moreover, witnessing Fellow Daoist Qiqi's techniques has stirred my spirit. I wonder if I might have the honor of experiencing the profundity of your great arts?"  

Han was not angered by Qiqi killing the bees that belonged to Wubing. These parasitic bees were ultimately external objects, not worth his emotional investment.  

Yet, he had no intention of giving up the idea of fighting Qiqi.  

The reason was simple: Han had finally found an opportunity to challenge a true disciple of a major sect!  

Since arriving in this world, Han had encountered countless human cultivators.  

But among these many cultivators, only a few true disciples of major sects stood out as truly extraordinary and exceptional!  

Whether it was Xiao Luo of the Beast Taming Sect, Tusheng of the Azure Lotus Sword Sect, the disciples of the Divine Thunder Palace, or the Qiqi before him—  

Only these true disciples could be called the elite of humanity, the true seeds of immortality.  

Each of them possessed immense divine abilities and were combat geniuses capable of facing thousands alone.  

Although Han had already mastered ten divine abilities, several of which were immensely powerful, and was quite confident in his own strength—  

He had never fought a true disciple of a major sect with a complete divine ability system.  

He had long wanted an opportunity for an all-out battle with a true disciple to truly gauge his own strength and potential!  

At this moment, Han's spiritual sense had reached the level of a second-stage cultivator, with only his mana still somewhat lacking.  

The gap between him and Qiqi was not large.  

This female cultivator was precisely the opponent he had been dreaming of challenging—he absolutely would not let her go so easily!  

Hearing Han's words, Qiqi responded with equal boldness:  

"I share the same thought! I've long heard that disciples of the Divine Thunder Palace are unparalleled in combat, with even entry-level disciples possessing the strength of true disciples. I've been eager to experience it for myself!"  

Qiqi had traveled far to the Reed Continent in search of divine abilities.  

But after expending countless efforts and time, she had gained nothing, leaving her with pent-up frustration and a clouded Dao heart.  

If she didn't vent her emotions thoroughly in this place, she would inevitably face a proliferation of inner demons, hindering her path to the Dao!  

Unfortunately, the bees earlier were far too weak—killing them had been utterly unsatisfying and failed to stir her spirit.  

But this Divine Thunder Palace cultivator before her seemed somewhat capable. Qiqi only hoped he could withstand a beating, allowing her to vent her frustration fully and achieve clarity of mind!  

---  

The two were of one mind, their tacit understanding absolute. Without further pleasantries, they launched straight into battle.  

With the **[Light-Stepping Golden Flash Technique]**, Han had always held absolute initiative in every fight he participated in—this time was no exception!  

In a flash, he closed the distance to within a hundred meters of Qiqi and unleashed a massive violet sword beam!  

Qiqi's humanoid avatar was instantly cleaved apart, transforming into a mist of water.  

Yet this mist seemed entirely unaffected by the slash, instead surging toward Han's body!  

Han vanished from the spot with another flash, giving the mist no chance to approach.  

His body brimmed with lightning-infused mana, and the partially-refined Thread Armor was fully activated, defending against any potential attacks.  

Both sides' initial probing strikes were effortlessly neutralized by the other.  

However, Han had gleaned considerable information about Qiqi.  

He fully transformed into a streak of golden light, darting back and forth across the sky, never resuming human form or lingering in any one spot.  

One thunderous sword beam after another slashed out from the golden light, splashing across the sky like ink!  

Han controlled his mana output, abandoning precision and solidity in favor of loosening his control and expanding the coverage of his sword beams.  

As the thunderous mana swept through the air, the dust-like **[Raindrop]** mana became visible, and one tiny water droplet after another was obliterated.  

Seeing that her opponent's movement technique was too elusive to pin down, Qiqi invoked her divine ability again, causing a light rain to fall from the sky!  

But Han flashed above the rain's range and slashed downward with thunderous mana, scattering the rainstorm!  

For the moment, Qiqi could do nothing to Han—her mana couldn't keep up with his speed, making it impossible to close the distance.  

Likewise, Han could do nothing to Qiqi.  

Her formless water transformation countered his **[Thought-Severing Slash]** perfectly.  

Water has no constant form. Though each of Han's slashes could cleave through Qiqi's watery body, none could deal direct damage!  

Thus, their back-and-forth became a battle of attrition.  

Han attacked; Qiqi defended.  

In the exchange, vast amounts of mana clashed in the air!  

Both possessed the heritage of major sects, their mana reserves far exceeding those of rogue cultivators.  

Han, in particular, had the **[Heavenly Origin Treasure Lotus]**, which allowed him to recover mana even mid-battle.  

This tug-of-war could last a very long time.  

But Qiqi was growing impatient!  

She had wanted a fierce, head-on clash, but her opponent was as slippery as a loach in a river—utterly untouchable!  

---  

She was a true disciple, while he was merely an entry-level disciple. How could she allow herself to be led around by him like this?  

Qiqi began attacking with even greater ferocity!  

The rain in the air grew heavier, a manifestation of her concentrated mana.  

As she poured more power into it, the rainfall intensified.  

Gradually, the scattered raindrops merged into rivers, coiling and twisting through the air.  

The churning water generated immense force, sending wave after crashing wave toward Han's sword beams.  

Han met them all head-on, each slash cleaving through the rivers of Qiqi's mana.  

His past opponents had been far too weak—he had never had the chance to wield his divine abilities so freely!  

The thrill of meeting a worthy opponent was exhilarating. With every slash, Han felt as though he was striking from the depths of his heart, his will merging with his techniques, his harmony with his divine abilities growing ever stronger!  

This was reflected in the **[Tome of Ten Thousand Laws]**, where the proficiency of **[Thought-Severing Slash]** was increasing at a faster rate!  

**[Divine Ability: Thunder General's Thought-Severing Slash]**  
**[Quality: Epic (Purple)]**  
**[Proficiency: Mastery]**  
**[Key Trait: Severing]**  

As one of his most frequently used divine abilities, **[Thought-Severing Slash]** was nearing the peak of the Mastery level. A breakthrough would undoubtedly lead to a significant increase in power!  

Han was lost in the rhythm of their exchange. He meticulously controlled the mana expenditure of each slash—he could keep this up for a long time!  

But he failed to notice that the rivers in the air were growing ever more numerous, their positions and structures shifting subtly.  

Had Han's knowledge of formations been deeper, he would have realized that the arrangement of these rivers was far from simple—there was profound meaning hidden within!
