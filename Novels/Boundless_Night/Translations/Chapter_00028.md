# Chapter 28: Feather-Robed Immortal

Qin Ming stood silent and unmoving, yet within his mind, flickering fragments of time emerged. At first, they seemed veiled in dust, shrouded in a black mist, but instantly, like thunder piercing the cloud sea, they tore through the darkness, sweeping away the smoke and revealing a series of bloody scenes.

The night was deep, flames soared into the sky, and a youth, clad in a feather robe, floated ethereal as an immortal, but beneath his feet lay nothing but corpses and blood...

Qin Ming clutched his head, his body trembling slightly. The "feather robe" had left an incredibly profound imprint in his subconscious, now stinging him, awakening past memories as if blowing away the dust that had obscured his mind.

He closed his eyes, firmly suppressing his surging emotions, his body rapidly relaxing. Then, he slowly opened his eyes. The current situation was not appropriate for displaying excessive abnormality. He used his 'Obscure Radiance and Dust' technique to dim his presence and blend into the crowd.

Qin Ming's eyes regained their clarity, his hair lifting in the wind. He stood there ramrod straight, as if nothing had happened, but a myriad of fragmented images began to surface in his mind.

He calmed himself, breaking free from the emotional cage of his own feelings, and examined the past with a detached mind, like an outsider quietly observing the bloody scenes that had once befallen him.

Night. A raging inferno devoured the entire forest, its fierce flames seemingly intent on swallowing the night sky itself. The village at the foot of the mountain was similarly ravaged by fire, spreading everywhere, houses collapsing, streets littered with corpses, and alleys flowing with blood.

Amidst the scorching flames and broken walls, a youth with flowing hair, feather-robed and ethereal as an immortal, seemed to glow from the corner of his eyes and brows, transcendent and otherworldly. His body shimmered with a faint light, his white shoes and socks unblemished by dust. Even amidst the ruins, surrounded by raging fire, he remained as if detached from the mortal world, supremely aloof.

Fourteen-year-old Qin Ming lay on the ground, his nose and mouth filled with the pungent smell of char and dust. Screams echoed in his ears, and all he saw was the merciless firelight. Behind him, the beams of his house, burned through, cracked and crashed down. He saw many familiar faces dead; the entire village was engulfed in a sea of fire.

The feather-robed youth, holding a glowing purple bamboo staff, stepped over the rubble and approached Qin Ming. Though his demeanor was extraordinary, his eyes seemingly flowing with starlight, his actions were utterly ruthless. The youth swung the glowing bamboo staff, striking Qin Ming's head with a single blow. Blood immediately gushed, making him feel the world spin, and he saw what appeared to be great fires burning in the night sky.

Qin Ming's clothes were tattered; he had been injured earlier, and now, after taking such a blow, he coughed violently, choking on the smoke in the inferno, unable to get up. Then, the feather-robed youth's slender hand swung the bamboo staff repeatedly, landing blows on Qin Ming's body, producing the sound of bones cracking.

"I thought I had only suffered a severe head injury. I never imagined such scenes existed in my forgotten memories." Qin Ming whispered inwardly, observing the past events, yet maintaining his composure, as if watching someone else's history.

Many figures moved about the village, quickly delivering finishing blows, but only the feather-robed youth stood his ground, solely using the glowing purple bamboo staff to strike Qin Ming.

"I can tell he could have shattered my skull with one blow, but he didn't. What hatred does he bear me, to make me endure such excruciating pain repeatedly?" Qin Ming firmly memorized the face of the feather-robed youth. Although the youth was handsome, ethereal, and pure, the firelight also revealed his cruel side.

"My arm was broken. I never knew it afterwards. How long was I truly unconscious that year when I was fourteen?" Qin Ming wondered to himself.

"My chest hurts so much. He probably cracked my bones by poking me with the bamboo staff." Qin Ming quietly watched the bloody scene in the firelight.

"Torture me first, then kill me?" Over two years had passed, but recalling it now, Qin Ming could still keenly feel that sense of powerlessness and intense pain.

The feather-robed youth seemed disgusted, avoiding physical contact with him, only bringing down the bamboo staff. Then he struck Qin Ming's head twice more. Qin Ming distinctly heard the sound of bones cracking, blood splattering, some landing on his neck, and some sliding down his cheek. Both were youths; one graceful and radiant as jade, ethereal and pure, while the other was burnt, in rags, covered in blood, lying prostrate in the dust, forming a stark contrast.

Finally, fourteen-year-old Qin Ming's consciousness began to dissipate. Vaguely, he saw two figures rush out of the ruins, powerfully repelling the feather-robed youth, grabbing him, and rapidly charging into the darkness. Along the way, his eyes blurry, he saw a colossal, dazzling city stretching across the land.

"Moonfall City, let's avoid it." The two whispered, not taking him into the city but circling far around it, quickly leaving. In his daze, he heard a sigh: "Three skull fractures, scalp and flesh badly damaged, too severe, probably won't live. And his arm and chest..." Finally, Qin Ming completely plunged into darkness.

At this moment, he quietly experienced that boundless darkness, unmoving.

"Someone carried me away and brought me to this remote area. Three places on my head were severely injured, almost shattered. No wonder I forgot so much, only remembering the scenes of my wandering after waking up." He realized that he might have been unconscious for over three months, because by the time he awoke, the fractures in his arm and chest had already healed.

Had he not seen someone wearing a feather robe again today, he still wouldn't have remembered any of this, only recalling the scene of his head taking a heavy blow, blood splattering in the raging fire. Though a slight blockage weighed on his heart, he felt no excessive anger. What good would it do to be resentful, angry, or irritable after the fact? What he needed was to effectively resolve the problem in the future: find and deal with that feather-robed youth!

"The feather-robed immortal-like one, their origins are not simple. Looking at the many experts appearing in that sea of fire, this likely involves a very powerful organization," Qin Ming sighed softly.

Afterward, he regained his composure. He even began to reflect, putting himself in the feather-robed youth's shoes: if he were that youth, he wouldn't torture an opponent he intended to kill. One decisive blow would suffice, forever ending future troubles.

"Moonfall City!" Qin Ming's eyes seemed to pierce through the night sky as he silently recited the city's name in his heart. The village where the incident occurred shouldn't be too far from Moonfall City.

Old Liu was quite agitated, whispering, "How powerful! What's the origin of this feather-robed woman? She actually fears no Moon Worms, confronting them directly, standing in the night sky."

Others in the snowy field shared the same sentiment. Moreover, she was the only female powerhouse to appear, making everyone curious about her identity. She stood suspended on the back of a large green bird, enveloped in a hazy, mysterious glow.

An old man said, "They probably won't fight. Experts are generally used for deterrence. If they truly engage in a major battle, both sides would lose face and fight to the death."

No sooner had he spoken than, amidst the majestic mountains covered by the faint night and over the endless wilderness, the Moon Worm suddenly emitted blinding light, like streaks of brilliant lightning arrows, shooting out towards the feather-robed woman on the green bird in the night sky. Many people's expressions changed. Could this mean a full-scale war was about to break out?!

Only the four beings seated calmly in the snow remained unperturbed, none rising.

In the night sky, the woman on the green bird raised her fair hand. She drew in the wind and snow, which then transformed into a dense shower of crystal-clear raindrops. In an instant, the night sky was veiled by a curtain of rain, blocking the light arrows unleashed by the Moon Worm.

Amidst clanging sounds, all the light arrows were blocked, revealing their true forms: silver-white insects, seemingly forged from fine metal, extraordinarily hard, darting through the night sky, attempting to tear through the rain curtain. The rain curtain grew more luminous, and all the raindrops elongated indefinitely, transforming into glowing threads. These threads sliced through the night, eventually tearing or directly piercing the densely packed silver insects with popping sounds. A large number of silver flying insects eventually burst on their own, like ephemeral bubbles, turning into nothingness.

Only two light-formed insects remained undamaged, plummeting towards the mountain ground, where they landed with a thunderous roar, as if a violent earthquake had occurred. Subsequently, an avalanche of white snow cascaded down. Everyone watched in awe, daring not to speak.

The Moon Worm hung high, like a bright moon suspended in the night sky above the forest. It did not strike again. The woman on the green bird also stood still, her robes fluttering gently. She maintained her composure and actively retreated a distance. Evidently, this was a high-level probe; if one side truly wasn't up to par, the so-called final negotiation would be entirely unnecessary.

Qin Ming gazed at the feather-robed woman on the green bird, thinking it too coincidental; someone wearing a feather robe didn't necessarily have a connection to that youth. But he couldn't help but ask someone. He turned to Mu Qing and asked, "Does wearing a feather robe signify a significant origin?"

Mu Qing, enveloped entirely in a black robe, glanced at him. "Those from beyond the mundane world are generally very aloof, detached from worldly affairs. I don't know her specific origins either." Qin Ming nodded, asking no further questions.

In front, the atmosphere among the four figures seated in the snow had actually softened, and smiles appeared on their faces. Although the onlookers couldn't hear their conversation, they presumed it was going well. Of course, people believed this was likely due to the probing clash between the Moon Worm and the feather-robed woman earlier, which facilitated the smooth progress of the negotiations.

Ling Xu spoke, "We will help you drive away those migrating otherworldly beings. We are not greedy; if there are resources in those special nodes, share a portion with us, nothing more. Additionally, all otherworldly beings that have recently expanded must retreat."

The snow-white old weasel, seated cross-legged, twirled a string of beads in one hand. "Why should we share with you? Wouldn't it make more sense for us to simply ally with the newly migrated higher beings to deal with you all?"

Ling Xu, dressed in white, sat calmly. "There's no need for us to probe each other. Our time is valuable. I have only a few simple words; please listen. We only want the special resources that might be born in those nodes. However, those newly migrated higher beings not only want these, but they are also eyeing your old lairs. They claim they have no temporary residence, are just passing through, and will reside for a few months. Do you believe them?"

"Alright, we agree."

"Good, decisive!"

Both parties rose. The general direction of the talks had been agreed upon, quite decisively, with no lingering issues. As for the details, others would discuss them; it was no longer their concern.

"It's over already?" Seeing that the high-ranking figures had all risen, everyone was stunned, not expecting it to conclude so quickly.

"You all return and wait, be ready to enter the mountain at any time," the tabby cat with the crimson longsword on its back told the crowd. Those from Red Mist City immediately cheered, filled with excitement. It truly was settled!

Qin Ming noticed a crow flying nearby, quite conspicuous, and it landed on a protruding large green rock in the snowy field. There, a woman in a fur cloak, her dark hair fluttering, actually glanced in his direction twice.

The crow spoke, "Why is that kid's aura even weaker than last time? Something's off. He's probably practiced a method to conceal his vitality. He must think he's too outstanding. I told you he wasn't simple, didn't I? Who exactly did you find that's suitable? Aren't you going to look at this person anymore?"

"The person I have chosen is like a blazing sun waiting to break through dark clouds, but it's not suitable for them to be exposed too early, lest they incur Heaven's jealousy. They have already been sent away," the woman said, glancing at Qin Ming again. "I'll find someone to test him later to see if he can be one of the alternatives."
