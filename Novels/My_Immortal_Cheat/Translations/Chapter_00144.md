# Chapter 144: Departure

“I won’t force any of you. If you’re unwilling to go, please step forward now. There’s great danger this time, and I understand.”

Zhou Changsheng looked at the young people before him, a peculiar expression in his eyes.

Everyone exchanged glances. Zhou Tian stood firm; he certainly wouldn’t miss such a prime opportunity to court death. Battle intent was practically overflowing from Zhou Xunchuan’s eyes, not to mention the others.

After a long while, three individuals shuffled forward. One of them bowed to Zhou Changsheng and began, “Senior, I…”

Zhou Changsheng waved a hand. “No need to explain, I understand.”

The man breathed a sigh of relief. Zhou Changsheng’s eyes narrowed slightly as he spoke again. “However, I don’t accept. After this matter is over, you will return to Futian Province and find land to plant Dragon Rice!”

“Senior, we…”

“You may leave.”

Zhou Changsheng’s tone was calm. The three still wanted to speak, but gazing into Zhou Changsheng’s deep eyes, their bodies shivered, and they dared not say another word. They walked out dejectedly, knowing that there would likely be no place for them in Tianqin from now on.

Zhou Tian shook his head. Since they were sheltered by Tianqin, they should contribute their strength. Did they not understand the principle that when the nest overturns, no egg remains unbroken? Afraid of danger? If they were afraid of danger, they should go home and farm; that would also be a contribution. These people were only slightly different from those in his previous life who enjoyed protection and prosperity yet constantly grumbled about the very system that shielded them.

“In that case, our entire team will depart in twelve hours. Begin your preparations.”

Zhou Changsheng finished speaking and vanished from the main hall. Although the Hall of Gods had opened, some strange masters stationed there deduced that it was still in a bizarre state, constantly alternating between the crevices of time and space and reality. It wasn’t actually possible to enter yet. They would have to wait until its state stabilized, which should be in about twelve hours.

After Zhou Changsheng disappeared, the others didn't linger. After all, they were about to face a major battle that couldn't be underestimated and required extensive preparations.

Zhou Tian bid farewell to a few people and escorted Tian Ling to her residence, where he encountered an acquaintance: Zi Xu, the young man with a remnant soul of a Saint King within him. Zhou Tian didn't pay much attention to the progress of Zi Xu and the remnant soul.

He had originally planned to slack off here for a while, discussing the serious matter of the Hall of Gods’ emergence and its impact on the Forsaken Land with Tian Ling. But just as he rested his head on Tian Ling’s milky-white long leg, a look of helplessness crossed Zhou Tian’s face, and a voice sounded in his ear:

“Tian’er, come see me.”

It was Zhou Changsheng’s voice. What else could he do? He had to go.

“Ling’er, Grandfather called me over.” Zhou Tian said helplessly, sitting up from Tian Ling’s jade-like legs.

“Then hurry and go.” Tian Ling’s cheeks were slightly flushed as she whispered.

“Then next time, we can exchange opinions on the reproduction and inheritance of Void creatures.” Zhou Tian straightened his clothes, saying seriously.

“Go quickly!” Tian Ling glared at Zhou Tian in annoyance, urging him.

Zhou Tian chuckled, squeezed Tian Ling’s tender cheek, and walked out. He guessed there was primarily one reason Zhou Changsheng sought him out: the Emperor-level combat power he had displayed during his battle with Zheng Yusheng.

Entering Zhou Changsheng’s room, he saw two people seated at the head of the room. One was Zhou Changsheng, and the other was someone Zhou Tian recognized: Wei Chuan’s grandfather, and one of the individuals who had escorted them to the Forsaken Land.

“Grandfather, Senior Wei.” Zhou Tian bowed to them. Both nodded, gesturing for Zhou Tian to sit.

Once Zhou Tian was seated, a benevolent smile appeared on Zhou Changsheng’s face. “Tian’er, I heard you’ve become an Emperor?”

“…………”

A string of black lines appeared over Zhou Tian’s head. He said helplessly, “Grandfather, that was just a technique of mine. I can only briefly reach that level, and only for a few tens of seconds.”

“Are there any side effects?” Zhou Changsheng frowned upon hearing this, inevitably thinking of forbidden techniques that offered terrifying amplification but demanded a corresponding price.

“Uh… not being able to use it again for two days, does that count?” Zhou Tian scratched his head, asking.

Zhou Changsheng’s face once again broke into a beaming, knowing smile, as he glanced at Wei Chuan’s grandfather, then said, “Alright, it’s nothing. Tian’er, you can go now.”

Zhou Tian was a little puzzled. He had thought Zhou Changsheng would grill him for details and had even prepared a string of ultimate nonsense excuses, but none of them were needed.

Still, it was best that Zhou Changsheng didn't ask. Zhou Tian bowed again and left.

After Zhou Tian departed, Zhou Changsheng chuckled, casting a triumphant look at Wei Chuan’s grandfather.

“Wei Whiteface, isn’t my grandson impressive?”

Wei Chuan’s grandfather looked at Zhou Changsheng’s smug expression and said, “Is that amusing?” His tone was cold, and two crimson fangs became visible, a sweet, metallic scent permeating the air.

“Of course it’s amusing! Now, even your son and grandson combined couldn’t beat my grandson. Quickly, put away that disgusting stench of yours.” Zhou Changsheng said with disdain.

Wei Chuan’s grandfather’s eyelid twitched. He took a deep breath, and all the scent vanished.

“You should focus on what to do about the battle of the Hall of Gods. I and that fellow Daoist from the Light faction are still seriously injured, unable to exert even half our strength. And these young ones are still just saplings; what if they break?”

Zhou Changsheng said indifferently, “If they break, it means they aren’t qualified to grow. Besides, we have other methods. Don’t worry, consider it a training exercise.”

Just as Wei Chuan’s grandfather was about to speak again, a flush suddenly appeared on his pale face. He hastily pulled a dazzling golden spherical object from the void—it was a drop of blood. It was completely golden, radiating swirling clouds of ethereal energy that formed various ferocious beasts roaring skyward, their might astonishing.

He opened his mouth, and the golden blood transformed into a golden thread that floated into his mouth. The world-shaking roars of the exotic beasts were helpless, only able to transform into nutrients to nourish his body.

Seeing this, Zhou Changsheng let out another burst of schadenfreude laughter.

Time passed quickly. Twelve hours flew by in an instant. Above Tianqin’s main city, a massive black-gold ancient ship floated. It was a thousand zhang long, its hull adorned with profound patterns that, rather than appearing strange, possessed a sense of beauty. Its sails were made from some kind of beast hide, specially treated, still exuding a terrifying might that suppressed the void.
