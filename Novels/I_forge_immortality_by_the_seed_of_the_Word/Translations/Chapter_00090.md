# Chapter 89: The Spiritual Essence Ranking Opens

Darkness enveloped Zhang Jing's vision, accompanied by complete silence.

Upon entering the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven, he found himself in an endless corridor. The passage seemed constructed entirely of mirrors, with every surface reflecting his image. Strangely, as he walked forward, the reflections behind him didn't disappear as expected—they remained frozen in place as if time within the mirrors had stopped completely.

Then everything went black.

Zhang Jing lost all sensation.

He couldn't tell how much time had passed—perhaps moments, perhaps years—before the clamor of voices roused him from unconsciousness.

Opening his eyes, he found himself standing on a cliff overlooking an endless expanse of marshland, its shimmering waters stretching to the horizon. Turning around, he saw fellow disciples from the Dao Academy. Many were just waking up like him, rising from the ground with dazed expressions as they took in their surroundings.

Meanwhile, flashes of spiritual light continued appearing on the ground as more academy disciples materialized one after another.

Seeing this, Zhang Jing sighed in relief. At least he wasn't the only one experiencing this—it wasn't some personal mishap.

His gaze drifted further, and immediately a primal, ancient aura assaulted his senses. Towering mountain ranges thousands of zhang high stretched endlessly, their peaks obscured by ancient trees that blotted out the sky. Terrifying roars occasionally echoed from within the dense foliage.

Then his eyes caught something else.

What was that?

Zhang Jing's pupils contracted as he focused on what appeared to be enormous floating altars suspended midair—nine in total, arranged in a stepped formation. The sight reminded him of...

"A stairway to heaven? What could be waiting at the top?" he mused silently.

His attention shifted to an inner court senior brother nearby, whose calm demeanor suggested he was waiting for something. Seeing this, Zhang Jing frowned. The inner court disciples clearly knew more about the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven than others. Not only did they have the advantage in cultivation, but they also possessed superior intelligence.

This confirmed what he'd heard—the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven had been opened primarily for inner court disciples. Outer court disciples like himself were merely catching the tail end of the opportunity.

But something felt off.

Why hadn't the academy provided information about the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven? Even if secrecy was a concern, they could have recorded the details in jade slips with restrictive seals for them to access after entering.

Zhang Jing sensed something amiss.

Suddenly, realization struck.

His identity token and storage pouch were missing—items that had definitely been on his person before entering. More importantly, his cultivation seemed to have inexplicably advanced.

Closing his eyes to sense his condition, he found his spiritual awareness on the verge of transforming into divine sense, while the spiritual energy in his dantian had acquired some characteristics of true mana. These were unmistakable signs of having reached the peak of the tenth level of Qi Refining!

A quick glance at the inner court seniors confirmed his observation—their cultivation had similarly been adjusted to the peak of Qi Refining's tenth level.

Recalling the mysterious corridor and the frozen reflections in the mirrors, Zhang Jing formulated a bold hypothesis: This wasn't his real body.

"Discarding external objects, even our physical forms and cultivation bases, only bringing in our mastered techniques and comprehension of realms? Fascinating. Though... some things apparently can't be blocked by the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven."

A faint smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face as he sensed the presence of both his jade talisman and the Five Treasure Spiritual River—both accessible with but a thought.

His contemplation was interrupted by an excited shout: "Holy shit! My cultivation broke through to the peak of Qi Refining's tenth level!"

Turning toward the voice, Zhang Jing saw a young man in the white robes of the Radiant Mystery Dao Academy jumping about excitedly. Nearby, an inner court senior from the same academy facepalmed before quickly walking away, his pace gradually increasing as if trying to distance himself from the scene.

As time passed, the final spiritual light flashed across the ground.

Above, clouds gathered to form a giant infantile figure nearly ten zhang tall. The cloud infant glanced downward before speaking in a childlike voice:

"All participants have arrived. Now announcing the rules of the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven."

The crowd below immediately quieted, all attention focused on the celestial figure.

"Your current bodies are replicas created by the Myriad Gods Realm, with cultivation uniformly limited to the peak of Qi Refining's tenth level. All participants will exit the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven after one year."

"Within the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven, all transactions use Spiritual Essence. Spending ten units of Spiritual Essence allows one summoning of the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault to exchange for secret treasures, resources, or opportunities to comprehend various Dao insights. Note: Death here requires twenty Spiritual Essence to revive."

"There are two ways to obtain Spiritual Essence."

"First: Hunt spirit beasts within the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven. The amount gained corresponds to the beast's strength."

"Second: Defeat the divine spirit projections guarding the Heavenly Staircase for the first time."

"The Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven contains ninety-nine steps of the Heavenly Staircase, with each divine spirit projection growing stronger at higher levels. Every nine steps ascended allows entry to a higher void heaven layer. Higher layers contain more powerful spirit beasts that yield greater Spiritual Essence when slain."

"I declare the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven trial now begun."

"The Spiritual Essence Ranking is now open!"

"Oh, and some spirit beasts might yield... pleasant surprises when slain."

With these final words, the cloud infant playfully winked before dissipating.

Silence reigned on the ground.

"Where are the Spiritual Essence Ranking and the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault?" Zhang Jing wondered aloud.

Then he noticed a mysterious Dao pattern had appeared on his left palm. Focusing his will, the pattern glowed faintly, conjuring an extraordinarily long ranking list before his eyes. At the bottom appeared a line of small characters:

[Spiritual Essence: 0]

Simultaneously, Zhang Jing sensed the pattern faintly connecting to some distant, mysterious realm—likely the fabled Myriad Gods Treasure Vault.

Deep within the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven, several profoundly ancient gazes suddenly awakened, turning their attention toward the First Void Heaven.

A majestic voice resonated through the void:

"Tsk, another Minor Void Heaven has opened. It seems the summons from the Clear Sky Profound Bright Heaven have made those youngsters anxious."

"This time it should be our Dongming Blessed Land's turn to recruit first!"

"All blessed lands compete fairly—there's no order of precedence."

"Shameless!"

"Enough! We're all fellow disciples of the Yuanjun Dao lineage. Let's not strain our harmony and incur the Dao Lord's displeasure."
