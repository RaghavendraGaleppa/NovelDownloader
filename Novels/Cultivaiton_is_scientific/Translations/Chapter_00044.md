# Chapter 44: Petroleum

Li Shiming spotted a village ahead. Since it was still early, he dispelled the cyan glow around his legs, slowed his pace, and returned to walking like an ordinary person.

This was a village near Zhongdu. Due to the mountainous terrain, the village appeared quite poor, with houses made of thatched mud bricks.

"Poor Liuzi's family—both of their fields were ruined by the demon water. How will they survive now?" villagers were discussing as soon as he entered the village.

"Indeed. And it's not just Liuzi's family—the neighboring fields are in danger too!" another villager lamented.

For farmers, fields were their livelihood. Losing farmland meant losing their means of survival.

"Elder, may I ask what this 'demon water' is? Could you take me to see it?" Li Shiming's interest was piqued, and he addressed the old man with a Confucian bow.

The old man looked up and saw Li Shiming dressed in scholarly robes. He immediately hunched his shoulders, too intimidated to speak. The other villagers nearby also lowered their heads, trying to appear as humble as possible.

Anyone wearing Confucian robes was at least a scholar—a status far beyond what ordinary farmers usually interacted with. The closer they were to Zhongdu, the more aware villagers were of the power and influence of the elite.

Li Shiming's Confucian greeting had startled the old man. Had he spoken with an air of superiority, the old man might have felt more at ease. Though Li Shiming had merged his memories and emotions with this world, deep down, he still held onto his past life's belief in equality.

"Elder, could you show me this demon water?" he repeated helplessly.

"Y-Young master, this lowly one is unworthy! If you wish to see the demon water, I shall lead the way!" The old man finally snapped out of his daze, bowing deeply and fumbling with his hands.

Despite his age, the old man was surprisingly nimble. He led Li Shiming to a field outside the village—a low-lying area of about ten mu, surrounded by scattered rocks of various sizes. The soil was poor, and the yield was likely meager.

On the right side of the field, a thick, black liquid was gushing from the ground, covering about two mu of land. The pungent smell hit Li Shiming before he even got close.

"Petroleum!" Li Shiming thought, confirming his earlier suspicion.

When the villagers had mentioned "demon water," he had already guessed it might be petroleum. In this world, petroleum wasn't useless—it was the raw material for fierce fire oil. However, fierce fire oil was a closely guarded secret, known only to a select few. Most scholars, let alone farmers, wouldn't recognize petroleum.

For the villagers, petroleum was a curse. It contaminated the land, rendering it unfit for farming—an agricultural disaster that destroyed their livelihoods.

But for Li Shiming, petroleum held an entirely different significance.

With petroleum, he could produce diesel, gasoline, plastic, and more. Petroleum was the lifeblood of industry. Just having diesel or gasoline would allow him to build more efficient generators and bring many of his ideas to fruition.

"Elder, thank you for guiding me." Li Shiming handed the old man a tael of silver in gratitude.

Once the trembling old man accepted the silver, Li Shiming left the village. He didn't need to handle the purchase of the land personally. Upon returning home, he instructed Steward Zhang to arrange it.

The owners of the ten-odd mu of land were overjoyed when they heard someone wanted to buy it. They agreed without hesitation—especially since Li Shiming offered a generous price, enough for them to purchase fertile land elsewhere.

A day later, the first two barrels of petroleum were transported to a residence outside the city, which Li Shiming had also purchased for storage purposes.

Refining petroleum in his Machine Room Space wasn't scalable, but the advantage was that, with precise mental control, he could use rudimentary equipment to extract basic components. The petroleum from the village was of good quality, yielding 40% diesel and 20% gasoline.

In the following days, Li Shiming kept himself busy. He spent most of his spiritual energy practicing spellcasting to improve his speed—a crucial skill for talisman-making, where faster and more precise spellcasting led to better results.

Refining petroleum was highly polluting, so he had to travel to the residence outside the city daily. During the refining process, he continuously vented toxic fumes from the Machine Room Space to prevent contamination of the spirit rice and the unknown spirit plant.

He also kept a close eye on the unknown spirit plant's growth. Whether by luck or fate, both the root and grafted branch had survived under the nurturing effects of his *Spring Rain Transformation Art*. Now, he only needed to wait for buds to sprout from the grafted branch—once leaves appeared, the plant would have a real chance at survival.

Steward Zhang had no idea why the young master wanted the foul-smelling black liquid, but he dutifully arranged for carts to transport it to the residence outside the city daily. He was growing anxious—the imperial examinations were approaching, yet the young master seemed indifferent. As a servant, he couldn't offer advice; he could only hope Li Shiming would come to his senses in time.

Meanwhile, the very person Steward Zhang was worrying about was busy decommissioning the old steam engine. A brand-new diesel generator took its place, providing more stable and abundant electricity.

The refined diesel was stored in two empty storage pouches within the Machine Room Space to conserve room. Though each pouch only held one cubic meter, they took up negligible space inside the Machine Room.

Most of the Machine Room Space was occupied by spirit rice, the IBM z15, the uninterruptible power supply, the diesel generator, the arc furnace, and the cultivation area for the unknown spirit plant—leaving little room for anything else.

Additional diesel was stored underground at the residence outside the city as a reserve. Even if the petroleum in the fields ran dry, he wouldn't have to worry about next year's supply.

Once he joined the sect, he was confident he could find a way to convert spirit stones into electricity. The *Introduction to Runes* had mentioned such a method, but the description was too vague for him to build a spirit stone generator yet.

Li Shiming had plenty of gold and silver, and during this time, Mo Yan had been busy as well. Knowing that precious metals would be useless once he entered the sect, he used his wealth to purchase large quantities of various ores.

In this world, non-spiritual ores were undervalued. Many rare ores that Li Shiming recognized were dismissed as impure. Perhaps the dominance of the cultivation civilization had suppressed technological progress—only metals like gold and silver, which served as currency, were truly valued.

Once the ores were in his hands, Li Shiming processed them in the arc furnace, refining and separating them into pure metals.

As days passed, his stockpile of resources continued to grow.
