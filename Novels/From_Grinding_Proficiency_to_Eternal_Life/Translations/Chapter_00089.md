# Chapter 89: The Massacre at Shanmen

Ning Wuque rode his horse into the training grounds of the Cicada Gate. Behind him, the heavy cavalry clad in black iron armor thundered forward, their hooves shaking the ground.

In his hand, a superior-grade longsword slowly dripped the seventh inner disciple's brain matter. The thick liquid slid down the blade, glistening dangerously under the sunlight.

His usually gentle features were now covered in a layer of frost, his eyes filled with endless coldness and determination. The blood accumulating in the blood groove of the sword froze into tiny ice crystals under the chilling aura of the blade and fell to the ground.

The surrounding Black Iron Army formed battle formations, their spears like a forest of steel. They advanced in perfect unison, constantly squeezing the space available to the Cicada Gate disciples.

"Fire!"

At the cold command of a squad leader, a rain of arrows fell from the sky, instantly pinning many outer disciples to the ground.

The battle was a one-sided slaughter. Lin Hanyi fought desperately, killing several Black Iron soldiers with a wave of her hand, but she was immediately surrounded by a squad wielding heavy spears. Spears came from all directions, forcing her to break through at the cost of injury. She fought while retreating, using the buildings to hide her figure.

"Senior Brother Ning!"

A piercing cry broke the bloody silence of the battlefield.

Chu Xuan leaped from the watchtower like a butterfly with broken wings. The silver bells at her waist shattered completely during the fall, their chaotic clinking sounding like a desperate wail. She gripped a longsword in each hand, both superior-grade, looking similar to the one in Ning Wuque's hand. She continuously threw out silver needles coated with poison, forcing back many Black Iron soldiers.

For a moment, many surviving disciples gathered around her, barely holding back the assault of the Tiger Vanguard Black Iron soldiers.

But that was all they could do.

The Tiger Vanguard soldiers were clad in heavy armor; ordinary disciples' weapons could only leave slight scratches. Only Chu Xuan's superior-grade weapons could cleanly pierce the armor and kill.

For a time, she actually prevented this squad of Tiger Vanguard from getting close.

The girl's deerskin boots stepped heavily over the dismembered limbs scattered across the ground. Some of the broken bodies twitched unconsciously as blood flowed in streams, gathering into terrifying puddles that dyed her boots a deep crimson, as if they had just been pulled from a dye vat.

The golden hairpin in her hair was askew, and several strands of messy hair hung loosely by her cheeks. Her originally cute face was now filled with anger and determination. The cunning calculation in her eyes was gone, replaced only by a burning light to protect the sect.

"You promised to protect my Cicada Gate!"

Her voice carried a sob, yet it held the ferocity of a desperate struggle, echoing across the bloody battlefield.

Ning Wuque's eyes flashed with a fleeting trace of hesitation, but this momentary wavering was quickly swallowed by deeper coldness.

He stepped forward abruptly, and the longsword in his hand swept out without warning, carrying a gust of wind mixed with the smell of blood.

Chu Xuan couldn't dodge in time, and her entire arm was severed by the sword.

She let out a sharp scream, falling to one knee, clutching her severed arm, her face filled with disbelief.

Ning Wuque looked down at the girl kneeling in the pool of blood. Suddenly, a gentle smile appeared on his face, the same as when they first met. But now, this smile was colder and more piercing than the winter frost.

"Junior Sister, do you know that every time you cause a scene..."

He spoke slowly, his voice low and devoid of emotion.

"...it makes me feel sick to my stomach."

As soon as he finished speaking, he ruthlessly stomped down, crushing the bones of Chu Xuan's left fingers.

With several crisp "cracking" sounds, Chu Xuan's face turned instantly pale as paper, and cold sweat poured down her forehead like rain.

But she bit her lip hard, enduring the severe pain without letting out another weak cry. She stared at Ning Wuque with a hatred that carved into her very soul.

At this moment, the entire Cicada Gate was like a living hell.

The Black Iron Army, like a pack of hungry wolves, formed small squads and battle formations, slaughtering the disciples of the Cicada Gate at will.

The disciples of the Cicada Gate fled in panic, their steps stumbling and chaotic, yet they were still caught up by the ruthless Black Iron soldiers. Blades slashed across their necks, and blood splattered.

Some fought back desperately, swinging their weapons with vigor, but due to the disparity in strength, they fell one by one into pools of blood, their bodies gradually growing cold.

The ground was covered with blood and corpses. Blood gathered into streams, flowing slowly along the terrain and dyeing the earth a shocking dark red. It was a scene of utter devastation.

Seeing this, Chu Xuan bit her lip hard, her eyes turning bloodshot. She wanted to struggle, but she was pinned down by Ning Wuque's foot, unable to move.

"Junior Sister, let me show you how the Cicada Gate is finally destroyed."

When Chen Tiangang appeared, leaning on an iron cane, three thousand Black Iron soldiers had already slaughtered seventy percent of the disciples, like devils.

The old man's increasingly rotting right leg dripped with pus and blood. With every step, the foul-smelling fluid left a nauseating footprint on the ground.

But his eyes were terrifyingly bright, flickering with a light that mixed greed and madness, like two burning ghost fires.

As soon as he appeared, he quickly drew Ning Wuque's gaze. Ning Wuque's eyes jumped with an inexplicable light.

Hatred, respect, anger, unwillingness.

Complex emotions intertwined, bringing a touch of bloodshot red to the corner of his eye.

This scene made Chen Tiangang exceptionally delighted. He didn't care about the emotions hidden in Ning Wuque's eyes, focusing only on the bloodshot red.

"Good disciple, just like this. You have been raised well. Your strength is much stronger than when you left."

His voice seemed to be squeezed out from between his teeth, every word filled with twisted pleasure.

"The Master taught well."

Although various emotions churned in Ning Wuque's chest, he suppressed them fiercely and said calmly, "If the Master hands over the Cicada Gate's divine weapon, the Cicada Armor, and kneels to surrender, I can report to General Fang and grant you a position as a guest elder."

A Huanxue Realm expert, a famous figure in the Jianghu, would be an undeniable powerhouse even in the Great Zhou Dynasty.

"The general leading the hundred thousand Tiger Vanguard, Fang Jun?"

A strange smile appeared on Chen Tiangang's face, carrying a hint of disdain in his expression.

"Is he worthy?"

Before the words faded, Chen Tiangang's iron cane stamped the ground, and his body shot out like an arrow released from a bow.

The Black Iron soldiers who swarmed toward him along the way were instantly cut in half.

In the blink of an eye, he was before Ning Wuque.

So fast!

Ning Wuque, his mind shaken, drew his sword. The blade tore through the air with a sharp whistling sound.

The muscles in his arm coiled like dragons, and his veins bulged like wriggling earthworms. His sword momentum was sharp as lightning.

However, Chen Tiangang merely sidestepped slightly, and his iron cane struck precisely at the seven-inch mark of the sword blade.

*Clang!*

The longsword fell from Ning Wuque's hand with a sound. The skin on Ning Wuque's tiger's mouth split open, and blood dripped down the hilt.

His pupils contracted sharply. Chen Tiangang's speed far exceeded his expectations; the rotting right leg didn't seem to affect his movement at all.

He was no match for a Huanxue Realm expert. Even though the other party had a physical disability, Ning Wuque couldn't even see his movements clearly.
