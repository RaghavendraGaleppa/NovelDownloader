# Chapter 80: The Day of Full Moon, The Moment of Results

"So... who actually won?"

"Can't you tell? We're the ones who lost!"

"Bro, that's not fair, I'm rage-quitting."

"Alright, alright, you little brat..."

"Damn it, you bastard, let go of my hand!"

Amidst various voices filled with envy, complexity, and frustration, Li Mo could finally move again.

He raised his head, only to see those cold, clear eyes holding an unfathomable darkness. Looking up from below, her beautiful face was like frost-covered snow. Yet, amidst the countless noisy voices, Li Mo felt a sudden quiet. He heard a certain heart beating slightly faster than usual.

"Ahem!"

An untimely cough sounded—it was Shangguan Wencang.

Good times are always short.

Under the gaze of the crowd, Li Mo could only awkwardly get up. His mind was also in a bit of a mess. What exactly happened just now? Oh, he hadn't been able to stop in time and had thrown himself into Ying Bing's arms. Whose fault was that? The aura hidden within her sword energy was just too cold!

Li Mo thought to himself, glancing sideways at Ying Bing. The girl wasn't looking at him. If not for the lingering fragrance at the tip of his nose, it would seem as though nothing had happened. But Li Mo was certain: the heart that suddenly started beating faster just now wasn't his own.

"You all seem unharmed, that's good."

"As for the outcome..."

Shangguan Wencang's gaze swept over the young man and woman, a hint of surprise appearing in his eyes. This was truly a difficult decision for him.

"He/She won."

The two spoke in unison.

Ying Bing was referring to their private bet. Li Mo, on the other hand, felt he shouldn't take advantage of the situation and act smug. Honestly speaking, he had lost just now; it was just that after he fell into her arms, Ying Bing didn't press the attack. There was indeed a gap in their strength.

Unless he used the World Seed and wielded the Panjie Meteor Hammer, but that power was still beyond his complete control and didn't fully belong to him yet.

Thinking for a moment, Li Mo added, "Our private bet concerns only the two of us."

Seeing his sincere tone and lack of attachment to the title of Chief Disciple, Shangguan Wencang nodded. "In that case, Ying Bing shall be the champion of the tournament and the Chief Disciple of this generation."

As his words fell, cheers erupted from below the arena. The figures on the high stands also stood up, offering their congratulations in unison. The Chief Disciple of this generation, and potentially the future Sect Master of Qingyuan, naturally required their recognition.

Among the crowd, the white-robed young master of Fenyu Lin looked on with fervent eyes, then glanced at Li Mo beside him, revealing a hint of不服 (dissatisfaction). The blood-red robed young master did not stand up, but the relaxed and carefree look in his eyes was gone, replaced by an inscrutable, dangerous contemplation.

On the擂台 (arena).

"Yes."

Ying Bing didn't seem to care much about the title. She and Li Mo had both made it into the top three, which was enough. Whether she was the Chief Disciple of Qingyuan or not held little significance; it wouldn't affect the System's ranking. The System ranked geniuses, it didn't care about fame.

Shangguan Wencang showed a wry smile. He understood Ying Bing's character to some extent. She was truly a person with no distractions, and perhaps it was precisely because of this that she could reach a height that her peers found难以企及 (difficult to reach). The two qualified to be Chief Disciple were both uninterested in the position. It was无奈 (helpless), but there was nothing to be done about it.

He clasped his hands behind his back and announced in a clear voice, "For this tournament, those with higher rankings shall receive rewards. The top three may enter the Scripture Pavilion to select a supreme art, while the rest of the disciples shall receive their respective rewards. You are all gifted with outstanding talent and will be the pillars of the sect in the future. With the current trends of the world in turmoil, I hope you will continue to maintain a进取 (enterprising) spirit."

...

The moment the supreme arts were mentioned, countless gazes once again fell upon the two who respectively wielded Tian Shuang and Chi Xiao. The legends surrounding these two swords were well-known and long-lasting within the sect. Was this传闻 (rumor) true or false?

If these two were to obtain the corresponding sword manuals, then the truth would finally be revealed.

...

The tournament came to an end.

On this day, many changes occurred within the sect, and many rumors arose. However, life at Qiushui Pavilion remained as usual.

Li Mo hummed a little tune as he tossed the wok in the kitchen, the sound of the stream flowing through the courtyard gurgling along. The stream seemed to have grown more灵 (spiritual) recently, making the peach blossoms by the water bloom exceptionally vibrant and brilliant. A petal drifted down in the wind, landing gracefully on an open page, becoming a bookmark for the girl.

The book was clearly titled: *Moonlight Sword Canon*.

And a *Sun Wheel Sword Canon* was quietly placed not far away.

"Food's ready."

Li Mo poked his head out from the kitchen.

Ying Bing got up to help bring out the food.

"Master, Master?"

Li Mo patted the woman on the rocking chair, but she remained unresponsive, leaving only a beautiful silhouette. Thinking she had fallen asleep, he walked around to the front. He saw his master's eyes were vacant, as if her soul had departed, and she was muttering to herself. Leaning in to listen, it sounded like, "My money... my money..."

Li Mo: "..."

His master seemed to have gone bankrupt again and was heartbroken. But this really wasn't his fault.

Li Mo knew exactly how to handle this situation. He took out two jars of fine wine and placed them by her hand. After she got drunk and woke up, she'd be full of energy again.

After doing this, he returned to the table. While eating, he began to翻阅 (flip through) the sword manuals. This was his first time接触 (contacting) a supreme-level sword art, even if it was only a low-grade supreme art. But after reading for a while, he let out a long breath. Supreme sword arts were truly difficult... He felt like a middle school student trying to solve a university-level problem.

Could Ice Cube really...

"I'm done reading."

A *Moonlight Sword Canon* was suddenly handed to him. The meaning was clear: she wanted to swap.

Li Mo was speechless. Since he couldn't learn it for the time being anyway, he handed over the manual he was holding.

A moment later, Ying Bing's light voice sounded, "What did you see?"

"Um... I'll go back to my room and read it later."

Li Mo buried his head and ate his food. He knew all the characters in the two manuals, but why did they seem so alien when put together?

After the meal, Li Mo was about to return to his room with the two manuals when Ying Bing's voice came from behind him, "Tonight, don't stay next to me. It's best to keep some distance."

Hmm?

Li Mo didn't understand why, but he nodded anyway. "Then I'll sleep in the wing room."

Ying Bing raised her head, looking at the moon that had not yet fully risen. Today was the day the System would reveal the results of the comparison. It was also a day of extreme Yin, the time of the full moon in the year. Her physique would be exceptionally terrifying today, so much so that even she couldn't fully control it; she could only try to minimize the range of its influence.

*Thump, thump*—

The sound of the young man walking upstairs reached her ears. She couldn't help but retract her gaze, looking at the figure ascending the stairs.

"The last move he used..."

"Was that also obtained from a fortuitous encounter?"

"His talent doesn't seem to be limited to just the sword path."

Dispelling her scattered thoughts, Ying Bing also returned to her room, quietly waiting for time to pass bit by bit. At this moment, nothing else mattered. This life was slightly different from her past experiences, and many unexpected events had occurred. But... the outcome would not change.
