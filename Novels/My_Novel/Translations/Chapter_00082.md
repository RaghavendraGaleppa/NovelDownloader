Chapter 82: Golden Leopard Golden Sinew, Finally Solidifying Blood

Li Xian sprang to his feet with a start, sensing his physical condition.

His blood surged like a spring, his energy was abundant, but the sensation of "Solidifying Blood" had already faded.

"So this is Solidifying Blood? I stumbled upon it unintentionally."

He recalled the details of the moment.

Having practiced martial arts all day, his martial resonance was at its peak. At that moment, he ate large mouthfuls of tiger meat and drank tiger soup, digesting the flesh and blood to stimulate his Qi and blood.

The two factors coincided, and in an instant, he felt a sensation of "blood slowing down."

"Martial proficiency and the nourishment of food."

"Are the proper methods to solidify blood and close the pores!"

"Both must reach a certain level to vaguely sense it."

Li Xian pondered deeply.

The Four Directions Fist had already reached perfection. When practicing the fist, his consciousness seemed to flow throughout his entire body, a state that was mysterious and profound. He immersed himself in the ocean of proficiency, tirelessly striving.

Then, his Qi and blood suddenly surged...

"I couldn't sense 'Solidifying Blood' before because my martial proficiency and accumulation were slightly insufficient, or the nourishment from food was not timely or potent enough."

Five days passed in the blink of an eye.

Inside the wooden house in the west of the village.

Li Xian focused his mind on his Dantian, breathing long and steady, his body covered in accumulated snow. He suddenly opened his eyes. A heat current flowed from his pores, melting the snow and soaking his entire body.

In the courtyard, tiger bones lay bare.

A large mountain tiger had been eaten by more than half.

The tiger soup in the pot was steaming with heat.

Li Xian had just finished eating.

During this period, he had proceeded step by step, making steady and significant progress. He would rise and practice at the sound of the rooster's crow, and when martial intent was thick at noon, he would boil and consume tiger soup.

He would rest briefly.

In the afternoon, he switched to practicing the Breeze Leg until the sky darkened.

Every time after practicing martial arts, he would immediately eat tiger meat.

[Four Directions Fist] increased by [1156] proficiency, total proficiency is [1576/10000 Perfect].

[Breeze Leg] increased by [1263] proficiency, total proficiency is [1608/5000 Great Completion].

The progress was significant.

During this time, he experienced the sensation of "blood slowing" four times, all after eating tiger meat.

Li Xian tried to prolong this sensation.

He circulated Qi through the Heavenly Cycle, driving it with his will.

He gradually grasped the trick. The fourth time his "blood slowed," it lasted for a full quarter of an hour. He sat motionless, allowing snow to cover him.

But after the "blood slowing" dissipated, the suppressed Yang energy and heat waves in his body instantly leaked from his pores, melting the ice and snow and soaking his clothes.

"If this continues, I can truly grasp the trick to 'Solidifying Blood and Closing the Pores'."

Li Xian sensed the changes in his body.

"Circulating Qi through the Heavenly Cycle" is about locking in Qi and blood, extending one's martial lifespan.

"Solidifying Blood and Closing the Pores" takes it a step further, allowing one to sense subtle changes within oneself. When blood slows, strength becomes stable; when strength is stable, the body becomes heavy; when the body is heavy, Qi becomes continuous.

When martial artists fight, how can they remain energetic, and some can even fight for days without rest?

The secret to this likely lies in "Solidifying Blood and Closing the Pores."

But the greatest effect of "Solidifying Blood and Closing the Pores" is "absorption." It locks the consumed food inside the body, allowing for as much absorption as possible.

It is like having water in the palm and desperately clenching one's fingers.

"Solidifying Blood and Closing the Pores," combined with the skill "Consumption," has allowed Li Xian to reap great benefits in the aspect of "eating."

"Although Solidifying Blood and Closing the Pores is meant to help digest 'refined food,' it can also play a significant role in martial combat."

Although Li Xian could not solidify his blood and close his pores at will, he felt his breath was longer and his physical strength had improved considerably.

"Unfortunately, the tiger meat is all gone, leaving only some miscellaneous meat, which I have another use for."

The tiger bones were stark and bare. The man-eating vicious tiger had, in the end, been eaten by a man.

Li Xian made full use of everything. He stored the tiger skin and tiger claws in the house.

He took a cloth bag and scraped all the remaining miscellaneous meat from the tiger into the bag. Then, he slung his bow and arrows over his back and followed a small path into the mountains.

He headed deep into the forest.

The trees here were lush, with broad-leaf trees and pine trees that remained verdant even in the depths of winter, creating layers of green forests.

"If I can hunt another fierce tiger, the food for the next few days will be settled!"

After entering the mountains for a mile or two, the small path abruptly ended.

Li Xian delved deeper to the right, taking out his narrow-bladed knife to chop away obstructing branches. He suddenly smiled—wasn't this like a guard stealing from his own post?

He left markers along the way, tying bright red, thick cloth strips to the branches.

"A tiger's claw."

He quickly discovered the tracks of a tiger beast.

Li Xian found a nearby spot and used the tiger meat as bait. He then hid in a tree, waiting for his prey.

This area was teeming with wild beasts.

They dominated the wilderness year-round and had no fear of humans. The scent of flesh and blood drifted through the air, quickly attracting a snow leopard.

"It's not a tiger, but it's still a good catch!"

Li Xian drew his bow to a full moon and shot with precision.

The snow leopard, struck by the flying arrow, naturally tried to flee, but after only a few steps, its body collapsed to the side, its breath weak.

The narrow-bladed knife pierced its heart, ending it for good.

"It's a pity I don't have a flesh-contracting bag."

Li Xian scooped up snow from the ground and stuffed it into the snow leopard's chest and the arrow wound to prevent blood from flowing out.

Then, with a great heave, he carried the snow leopard on his back and headed for home.

"Finishing the tiger meat, and now eating leopard meat."

"This life..."

"Is truly something to behold."

Li Xian was in an excellent mood. He went to the stream to fetch cold water, skillfully skinned the leopard, and removed its organs.

While gutting the leopard's body, he discovered a golden sinew running along its spine.

"A leopard sinew!"

Li Xian was delighted.

This was no ordinary leopard sinew. Any living creature that roams the forests has sinews. Tigers have tiger sinews, bears have bear sinews. Tiger sinews are thick and tight, bear sinews are thick and long, and leopard sinews are thin and tough.

This sinew was golden in color, a famous "Golden Leopard Sinew." Taken from a leopard, its sinews had mutated, occurring in only one out of a hundred!

It was extremely elastic, unbreakable by a blade, and unharmed by fire. Even if sold to a martial artist, it would fetch a handsome price.

"If I heat and refine this, I can make it into a rope."

"It's always good to have an extra sharp tool when traveling through the countryside!"

Li Xian straightened the leopard sinew and laid it flat on the ground. It was a full three zhang long. The leopard's body was only one zhang and two chi long, already quite large, but its sinew was even longer.

"This leopard was a genius among leopards."

"It's a pity it died by my hand."

Li Xian came to his senses. Seeing the leopard's golden-yellow color and the unusual patterns growing on its head, he knew that once a forest beast becomes a king, it gradually develops a different appearance.

This Golden Leopard...

Was at least a local overlord.

"One part grilled, one part stewed."

Having prepared the leopard meat, Li Xian started a fire and boiled water, busy and happy.

When the meat started to sizzle with oil...

He夹了一些野菜，一把送入口中，其中滋味，实难言说。李仙眼睛微闪，他早年跟从李父，猎杀不少豹子。但真正吃食豹肉，却是第一次。

"豹肉口感外绵内韧."

"都是瘦肉，汁水少些，但是肉质没那么腥臭，比虎兽好吃许多."

Li Xian commented to himself.

He then put the second piece of meat into his mouth.

[Grilled Golden Leopard, Skill: Consumption, Proficiency +5]

[Skill: Consumption]

[Proficiency: 456/1000 Proficient]

In this way, Li Xian did his utmost to perfect the combination of eating and training.

There were many beasts in the mountains. Every time he finished a meal of beast meat, he didn't need to go deep into the forest to quickly hunt tigers, leopards, or deer.

In the blink of an eye, it was the middle of the twelfth month.

Three animal skins lay in the courtyard, completing the set of tiger, leopard, and deer.

It was a slight pity that he had not yet hunted a large bear.

The Four Directions Fist grew increasingly powerful, and the Breeze Leg was on the verge of a breakthrough, about to step into "Perfection."

Li Xian stood firm in the snow.

The blood in his body slowed as if solidified...

The "Solidifying Blood" stage within "Solidifying Blood and Closing the Pores" arrived as expected, a natural consequence of his efforts.
