# Chapter 208: Taking on a Disciple  

To account for the variations in spiritual energy caused by differences in medicinal herbs, one must accumulate experience through extensive alchemy practice to minimize such discrepancies.  

Had this been a seasoned alchemist with decades of experience, Elder Ma would have merely praised their talent. But Li Shiming had only received his alchemy inheritance a few months ago and had already reached such a level. His potential in alchemy was unimaginable.  

Elder Ma could clearly see that every step Li Shiming took was based on the knowledge from his alchemy inheritance. Yet, Li Shiming had pushed those foundational techniques to their limits, producing flawless pills with basic methods.  

With the execution of the "Seven-Finger Pill Retrieval Technique," ten "Mind-Clarifying Nine-Palace Pills" flew out of the cauldron and landed in a prepared jade vial.  

"Please inspect them, Elder Ma!" Li Shiming handed the vial to Elder Ma with a bow.  

"No need. Assigning you as a junior alchemist was an understatement. Also, your cauldron is far too unworthy of your status. Here, take this one—I used it during my Foundation Establishment stage." Elder Ma waved his hand dismissively and produced a cauldron.  

Li Shiming's eyes lit up. The cauldron Elder Ma offered was a spirit artifact. While using a high-grade magical tool cauldron, he had already sensed its inadequacy. As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, high-grade magical tools could no longer meet his needs.  

However, the more benefits he received from Elder Ma, the more he felt indebted—these favors would eventually need to be repaid.  

"Take it. My decades-long friendship with Old Su means his disciple is like half my own. Since you've inherited my alchemy knowledge and become an alchemist, why fuss over such trivial matters?" Elder Ma glared, sensing Li Shiming's hesitation.  

"Elder, I wish to refine Foundation Establishment-level pills. How should I proceed?" Li Shiming asked respectfully after storing the spirit artifact cauldron.  

This was his primary purpose for coming here. Both the pill formulas for the Foundation Establishment stage and second-grade spiritual herbs were concerns he needed to address.  

Although he had acquired some herbs from his spoils of war, they required matching pill formulas to be refined. At his current level, he was far from capable of developing his own formulas.  

"Wait a moment. I'll summon Old Su—I can't just teach you everything for free!" Elder Ma chuckled, sending out a spell before answering.  

Before long, Elder Su arrived at the Alchemy Hall. Judging by his familiarity with the place, he must have visited often.  

"Old Ma, has Shiming caused any trouble here? As his elder, you should be patient with him!" Elder Su joked, glancing at Li Shiming standing obediently before turning to Elder Ma.  

"Old Su, I want to take Li Shiming as my nominal disciple!" Elder Ma declared solemnly.  

Elder Su's smile faded as he looked between Elder Ma and Li Shiming, his eyes filled with curiosity.  

Had Elder Ma made such a statement publicly, it might have been taken as a jest. But in this private setting, with such a serious demeanor, it was clear he genuinely intended to take Li Shiming as his nominal disciple.  

Elder Ma's status in the sect was such that no Golden Core cultivator dared offend him, and even Nascent Soul elders showed him respect.  

As a master alchemist capable of refining pills for Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivators, his position was unassailable. Crossing him meant losing access to alchemical services—no one would risk handing precious herbs to an alchemist they had offended, only to hear the dreaded words, "The refinement failed," and suffer total loss.  

"Since you see promise in Shiming, I agree to you taking him as your nominal disciple. But tell me, what caught your eye? I'm quite curious myself!" Elder Su nodded without hesitation.  

This was a boon. With Elder Ma as his nominal master, Li Shiming would never lack for pills.  

"When this child retrieved the Three-Leaf Sun Grass for you, he also seized the Crimson Sun Spirit Fire from the Crimson Sun Bear. Now, look at the pills he just refined!" Elder Ma smiled, taking the vial from Li Shiming and tossing it to Elder Su.  

Unlike the inexperienced Li Shiming, Elder Su knew exactly what the Crimson Sun Spirit Fire was. Hearing that Li Shiming had snatched the Three-Leaf Sun Grass from a Crimson Sun Bear, his gaze softened further—this disciple grew more pleasing by the minute.  

"High-grade first-grade pills, all from a single batch?" He opened the vial, examined it briefly, and looked at Li Shiming in astonishment.  

Li Shiming nodded in confirmation.  

Elder Su then turned to Elder Ma, who nodded with evident pride.  

"On the day of his apprenticeship, I gave him my alchemy inheritance. He taught himself solely from that. Today’s visit truly shocked me!" Elder Ma emphasized the inheritance he had provided—this was an established lineage.  

Even if Li Shiming hadn’t become his nominal disciple, this inheritance was an undeniable bond.  

"Shiming, you must study alchemy diligently under Elder Ma!" Elder Su instructed before giving Li Shiming a meaningful look and transmitting a message: "Hurry and serve tea to your new master!"  

Only then did Li Shiming react. Elder Su had already placed a cup of tea in his hands.  

"Master, please enjoy your tea." As this was a nominal discipleship, no public ceremony was required—the ritual was simple.  

Elder Ma smiled, accepted the cup, took a sip, and helped Li Shiming rise.  

"Shiming, you asked earlier about refining Foundation Establishment pills. There are two options. First, you can take on sect alchemy missions—these are mandatory for alchemists, with each assigned a quota.  

"With my approval, you can take on missions for early Foundation Establishment pills. The sect demands stability: regardless of success, they take 80% of each batch.  

"Of course, if your success rate falls below 80%, you’ll be relegated to lower-grade pills. The sect prioritizes reliability—failure is unacceptable.  

"Second, you can take private commissions, either through the sect or independently.  

"Typically, alchemists receive one-third of the refined pills—this is an unbreakable rule, even among close friends." Here, Elder Ma glanced meaningfully at Elder Su.  

"Old Ma charged me one 'Triple Sun Revival Pill' for refining them!" Elder Su lamented.  

"For Golden Core pills, the yield depends on the herbs. If more than one pill is produced, the alchemist keeps one as payment. If four are made, two are taken!" Elder Ma explained smugly.  

Li Shiming inwardly marveled at how lucrative alchemy was.  

Then again, now that he was an alchemist, he’d be the one profiting—so no complaints there.  

"Master, what if a private commission fails?" Li Shiming asked.  

"The client bears the loss. We alchemists merely waste our time—what else can be done?" Elder Ma shrugged.  

Li Shiming truly grasped the privilege of being an alchemist—it was a win-only profession.  

Of course, if an alchemist’s failure rate was high, few would dare seek their services.  

"Shiming, visit me daily from now on. Use my second-grade herbs to refine a batch of second-grade pills. Once you succeed, I’ll directly promote you to an intermediate alchemist, allowing you to take Foundation Establishment missions. Consider this my welcoming gift." Elder Ma laid out his plan.  

"Yes!" Li Shiming recognized Elder Ma’s generosity and bowed in acknowledgment.  

Refining second-grade pills for the first time would consume an unknown quantity of herbs—Elder Ma’s (now Master Ma’s) investment was substantial.  

Master Ma had his own calculations. Based on Li Shiming’s current skill, he only needed to familiarize himself with second-grade herbs to quickly produce second-grade pills.  

Besides, investing in a promising disciple was always a sound decision.  

"Head back now." Master Ma dismissed him with a wave.  

After Li Shiming left, Master Ma retrieved the tea box Li Shiming had brought, brewed two cups—one for himself and one for Elder Su.  

"Did you roast this tea? Applying alchemy techniques to tea—impressive!" Elder Su praised after a sip.  

"Not me. My nominal disciple gifted it." Master Ma sipped his tea. The tea Elder Su had provided earlier was second-grade, but it paled in comparison.  

"Shiming roasted this? Such fine tea, and he gifts it to an outsider before his own master!" Elder Su huffed.  

Master Ma choked on his tea, nearly spitting it in Elder Su’s face.

Returning to Sword Holding Peak, Li Shiming saw his three female attendants hard at work and realized he hadn’t rewarded them for their efforts.  

"Ye Lingyun, come here." He beckoned.  

"Greetings, Master!" Ye Lingyun approached respectfully.  

"You’ve worked hard. Here are three vials of pills—distribute one to each of you." Li Shiming handed her three vials of "Mind-Clarifying Nine-Palace Pills."  

"Thank you for your generosity!" Ye Lingyun accepted the vials gratefully.  

In truth, their families still supplied them with cultivation resources despite their roles as attendants.  

For cultivators like them, who couldn’t join the sect formally, serving within the mighty Shushan Sect—even as attendants—granted benefits far beyond what rogue cultivators could dream of.  

With Li Shiming’s status ensuring continued family support, their cultivation wasn’t hindered.  

Inspecting their work, Li Shiming noted the thriving spirit fields and plants—proof of their diligence.  

He said nothing but resolved to reward them with pills henceforth. With abundant first-grade herbs at hand, refining enough pills for their needs was trivial.  

"What did the master say?" Wan Qian asked curiously.  

"He gave each of us a vial of pills as reward for our work!" Ye Lingyun replied with a smile.  

The pills were secondary—what mattered was Li Shiming’s acknowledgment, which cemented their standing.  

Bound to Li Shiming, his approval was paramount.  

Previously, his indifference had worried them.  

Ye Lingyun distributed the vials to Wan Qian and Lu Yingtong. Coming from respectable families, they weren’t awed by pills—until they opened the vials.  

"High-grade first-grade pills! Ten in each—enough for a month’s cultivation!" Ye Lingyun exclaimed, eyes wide with excitement.  

Their reason for joining Shushan Sect was the superior environment and spiritual energy—keys to their cultivation hopes.  

If Li Shiming aided them, they might even secure Foundation Establishment Pills from the sect, fulfilling their dreams.  

They hadn’t expected such lavish rewards—high-grade pills were typically reserved for a family’s elite disciples.  

Feeling fortunate in their master, they redoubled their efforts on Sword Holding Peak.

Back in his cave abode, Li Shiming immediately examined the Crimson Sun Spirit Fire in his spirit lake.  

Previously, he had ignored it as it passively absorbed minuscule amounts of fire and lightning spiritual energy daily.  

Only after Master Ma’s explanation did he realize he needed to actively feed it fire energy for growth.  

The fire-lightning energy it absorbed daily merely sustained it.  

Channeling a stream of fire-lightning energy into the spirit fire, Li Shiming willed it to consume.  

The flame flickered, swelling slightly.  

He repeated the process ten times until the spirit fire signaled saturation.  

Relieved, he noted the expenditure—roughly ten percent of his spiritual energy.  

Thanks to the "Five Elements Energy Absorption Array," his five elemental lightning energies remained balanced. Over time, other lightning energies would replenish the fire-lightning expenditure.  

Observing the now-larger flame, he retrieved the aura-concealing technique Master Ma had provided.  

The technique was simple—a spiritual energy barrier around the spirit fire to contain its aura.  

Within an hour, he mastered it. The spirit fire’s presence vanished unless he consciously probed it—proof of the technique’s efficacy.
