# Chapter 80: Abnormalities

In the wake of Qin Ming and Xu Sheng, Scarlet Cloud City glowed like daylight, its tall, thick walls of bluestone completely illuminated. In front of them, however, night fog swirled, with majestic mountains looming like heavy shadows, the scenery dark and obscure. Their front and back seemed like two completely different worlds.

Xu Sheng said, "After the initial spring thunder, the mountains have temporarily dimmed, but in a few days, when the underground fire springs fully revive and surge, the wilderness will become an entirely different marvel." Even now, things were different; most of the ice and snow had melted, allowing them to smell the earth, and new buds had even appeared on the branches of some old trees.

"Could luck be coming our way?" Zhou Lin asked, a little excited, pointing her spear forward. At this point, they had already delved deep into the mountain range.

"Is that an alienated plant? This old lady's luck is finally turning!" Zhou Lin was only in her twenties, but she referred to herself that way due to her consistently bold personality. "It really seems to be a special plant brimming with potent spiritual energy, and it's newly born, so we should still be able to make it!" Xu Sheng was also startled. There was no need for more words; the three of them sprinted forward.

In the woodland, silver flowers bloomed on a special ancient tree, continuously emitting light, gradually illuminating the dense forest. Alienated plants could cause various birds and beasts to mutate, and if humans consumed them, they could also enhance their physique, leading to a rapid rebirth. This wasn't the first time Qin Ming had seen an alienated plant; once, when he and Xu Yueping went to Silver Vine Town, they had seen red glow erupting and "scarlet butterflies" fluttering in the air. Unfortunately, they were too far away then, and the petals had already been blown into the night sky by the strong wind.

"We really made it!" Xu Sheng was overjoyed. In the forest ahead, an old tree was rapidly budding and flowering, its light radiating in all directions, a sweet fragrance filling the air. A gentle breeze blew, causing some petals to fall, drifting like fireflies in the night. Alienated plants "bloom" without regard for season or pattern, making them difficult to find actively. And after their brilliant display, they would completely wither and die. It was precisely because of this that Zhou Lin and Xu Sheng were so excited; it was truly a stroke of immense luck.

"Little Qin, don't hesitate, don't leave a single petal behind!" Xu Sheng reminded. "The mutated creatures from the mountains will arrive soon, hurry!" Zhou Lin thrust her spear, and with a crack, a thick branch broke off. "Roar!" Beasts roared, disturbing all kinds of creatures nearby. Although Qin Ming and Xu Sheng wanted to carry the entire old tree away, it was highly impractical. Giant fierce birds had already appeared in the sky, swooping down. The appearance of an alienated plant was bound to cause great chaos; no one could monopolize it.

"Ugh, why does it smell like blood?" Zhou Lin had just put a glowing flower bud into her mouth but immediately spat it out. "Ptui!" Xu Sheng also spat, his expression changing slightly. He quickly lowered his head, checking the roots of the tree, feeling a sense of unease. "The smell of blood is very strong!" Qin Ming also said. Xu Sheng's expression was grim. "This isn't an alienated plant. It's artificially stimulated. Could it be that someone from the Hidden World wants to lure beasts here to refine medicine?" He had once been an itinerant merchant and was very knowledgeable. He immediately bowed towards the depths of the forest, saying, "Excuse us, Senior, we stumbled in unintentionally and offended you."

"Hurry, let's go!" Zhou Lin whispered. A large claw had already extended from the sky, reaching for them. Zhou Lin thrust her spear, colliding with the claw, sending sparks flying. It was a fierce bird nearly ten meters long, with black wings like steel blades, cutting through some treetops as it flew at low altitude, its eyes gleaming with golden light. "Roar!" In the forest under the night sky, a multitude of mountain beasts charged, dense black figures flying through the air. "How long has it been? The birds and beasts are practically overwhelming us! Quick, break through!" The three of them changed expression. The last alienated plant Qin Ming found was outside the big mountain, very close to Silver Vine Town, so there were no powerful mutated creatures. Now, deep in the mountain range, their situation was extremely dangerous.

"A five-time mutated venomous python, it's already crawled out from underground, and it's only early spring!" Xu Sheng's face darkened. He came face to face with a python as thick as a water vat, charging straight at him. "Is it a spiritual creature?" Qin Ming actively charged forward. "No, it's highly venomous, be careful of its poisonous mist!" Xu Sheng quickly warned. The large python opened its mouth, surprisingly stirring up a gale, and a large patch of colorful luminous mist rushed out. Heavenly light flowed around Qin Ming's body, and he dodged out of the way immediately; there was no need for a bloody battle with a non-spiritual creature. The python was fierce; with a flick of its tail, it snapped some trees as thick as a thigh, coiling towards Qin Ming. *Thud!* Qin Ming's hammer fell, and the python's tail instantly became a bloody mess, a section breaking off. On the other side, Zhou Lin collided with a golden leopard twice with her long spear. Xu Sheng, meanwhile, encountered a four-meter-tall black bear and angrily shouted, "I've been too unlucky lately; something always goes wrong when I enter the mountains! You blind bear dare to bully me? I'll take your bear gall!" He was not ambiguous; he went straight up and knocked the black bear down. "Brother Xu, run, there's another big bear!" Qin Ming yelled. Xu Sheng was stunned for a moment, then his expression changed. Another bigger bear? With a beastly roar, a six-meter-tall bear appeared in the forest behind the four-meter-tall "little bear," glaring down at Xu Sheng with a menacing gaze. "Awooo!" The four-meter-tall black bear seemed to be complaining. "Could it be a creature that has mutated six or seven times?" Xu Sheng's scalp tingled; a huge black shadow had already pounced, a terrifying bear paw smashing down. He turned and ran. If there was only one big bear, Qin Ming could have tested his strength, but right now, birds and beasts were everywhere, making it impossible to stay for long. Most importantly, these mutated creatures saw the three of them as blood and spiritual medicine, eyeing them covetously. *Thump!* Ultimately, Qin Ming still collided with that big bear once, smashing one of its paws into a bloody mess with his long-handled dark gold hammer before it stopped chasing. At the same time, this deterred the other mutated creatures.

Even so, the three of them were in a sorry state; they had almost been trapped in the army of birds and beasts. "I thought we hit the jackpot, but who knew we'd have such bad luck and almost end up in a beast's belly." Zhou Lin felt things had been too unlucky lately. "Was there really someone from the Hidden World there?" Qin Ming asked. Xu Sheng shook his head, saying, "Not necessarily. Perhaps it was a blood-colored potion that flowed out from a Hidden World area, used by others to lure beasts." Zhou Lin said, "Xu Sheng, did you get involved with something unclean when you were an itinerant merchant? Why do I feel like I'm always unlucky when I'm out with you?" "How could that be!" After a round of fighting, Zhou Lin and Xu Sheng were both exhausted and decided to return to recuperate, planning to enter the mountain again tomorrow. "Tomorrow, if we can find that spiritual clam, we won't have to fight to the death because its combat strength is very weak."

The next day, Xu Sheng and Zhou Lin led the way, with Qin Ming following them, arriving at a swamp to search for a very rare type of clam. The vegetation in this area was sparse, with puddles everywhere, and a vast expanse of muddy marsh, shrouded in faint black mist. "See that? The glowing substance in the mud is the trace left by the spiritual clam," Xu Sheng said, pointing to the blue mucus in the muddy water. "Be careful, we were ambushed here last time," Zhou Lin said. This time, they were not secretly attacked.

But an hour later, they began to flee desperately as a group of "mud dragons" chased them relentlessly, like dogs, causing the entire swamp to boil. The seemingly peaceful depths of the swamp actually contained a large nest of mud dragons. They resembled crocodiles but had a single horn on their heads and much longer legs, making them run far faster than crocodiles. Every adult mud dragon weighed several thousand catties, chasing them with red eyes, mistakenly believing they had come to steal their eggs. With early spring arriving, some mud dragons had already begun laying eggs.

"Ahhh!" After escaping the swamp, Zhou Lin couldn't help but scream, furious, because she was covered in mud from head to toe, her hair and face plastered with muck. What was originally a beautiful and valiant woman had now become a mud monkey. She was enraged, saying, "Xu Sheng, there's definitely something wrong with you! We've been having such terrible luck lately every time we go out!" "You can't blame me! Who knew the traces of that spiritual clam would lead straight to a mud dragon's nest!" Xu Sheng was also fuming, even suspecting that someone was deliberately trying to harm him. Qin Ming was also frustrated; he too had rolled a few times in the mud pit, and now all three of them looked the same. Without a doubt, Zhou Lin once again transformed into "Fragrance Sister," cursing all the way from the mountains back to the city. Xu Sheng persuaded, "Don't be angry. Tonight, I'll go find my itinerant merchant master and ask him where spiritual creatures have recently appeared that are also safe enough." Many people in the city stared at the "mud monkey" Zhou Lin, making her even more resentful. "Brother Xu, why don't you let your master check if there's really something wrong with you?" Qin Ming said, wiping some mud from his face. In fact, Xu Sheng himself was starting to doubt his life, nodding, "Okay, I'll let him check me thoroughly tonight."

Early in the morning, Scarlet Cloud City was radiant, and the three of them set off again. "My master said there's nothing wrong with me," Xu Sheng began to explain as soon as they met, insisting it wasn't his fault. "Are we going to the Red Mist Cave this time? There's a massive colony of fire bats there, terrifyingly huge in number, we can't afford to provoke them!" Zhou Lin shook her head. Xu Sheng said, "We're not going to provoke the fire bats. There's a cold pond there, connected to an underground river, and spiritual eels have appeared inside." The Red Mist Cave was deep within the mountain. The three descended along a fissure in the earth. It wasn't very dark inside, as the mountain's internal fire springs were reviving. "Won't we disturb the fire bats in the Red Mist Cave?" Qin Ming worried. Xu Sheng shook his head, saying, "Don't worry, the Red Mist Cave is very large. We're moving in the opposite direction from the bat nest." They arrived near a cold pond in the Red Mist Cave. The black pond water was bone-chillingly cold, and colorful light flashed and disappeared within it, confirming the presence of spiritual eels. "Bait, fishing rods, harpoons, large nets, I've brought everything. We're fully prepared; the time for harvest is upon us!" Xu Sheng said confidently. Zhou Lin looked scornfully, "Don't say things like that anymore. Now, coming out with you, I've developed a psychological shadow."

Half an hour later, the entire Red Mist Cave was filled with the fluttering sound of wings as a massive number of fire bats swarmed out, covering the sky, rushing over from all areas. "Why are there so many?" Qin Ming felt a chill; they were simply endless. Xu Sheng explained, "There are too many mutated insects in the mountains. This is a colony of fire bats that the City Lord's Manor specifically ordered everyone not to disturb, using them to eliminate insects. As a result, the number of fire bats here has grown exponentially." Ultimately, the three of them "baited" themselves, jumping into the cold pond and escaping along the underground river. They continuously searched for an exit, wanting to return to the surface, finding only a few places to breathe. They swam for over ten *li* (approx. 5 km) before finally emerging from a lake in the mountains. "Ahhh!" Zhou Lin couldn't hold back again, warning Xu Sheng not to ask her to come out with him again.

"It's not Brother Xu's fault. I'll go back and investigate!" Qin Ming spoke, a cold glint in his eyes. He felt it couldn't be such a coincidence; it seemed very much like someone was deliberately targeting them. Although they had escaped safely each time, a slight misstep would have meant death. Moreover, from these incidents, if someone was secretly interfering, they hoped that they, or rather, he, would naturally die in the mountains. "Has an invisible hand reached out from afar?" Qin Ming didn't think so, because if it were *those* people, it would be ten times more intense and terrifying than this. "Could it be some petty scoundrel who I dealt with back then, now using such methods to embarrass me?" he secretly speculated.

"You said he might be able to withstand six or seven waves of Heavenly Light?!" In the City Lord's Manor, Meng Xinghai shot up from his seat upon hearing the report from a black-clad man. That day, accompanied by a group of nobles, he had been drinking in the Mountain God Temple, admiring the spectacle above the Thunder Fire Alchemical Palace, and did not know the specific situation inside the Golden Palace. "Is the information reliable?" The black-clad man replied, "That body collector, Xu Hai, died two days ago from vomiting blood. Before his death, he told his family that he might have harmed a peerless genius due to his greed, as he deliberately made that youth endure six or seven waves of Heavenly Light impact, and thus he himself suffered retribution." "Remarkable! Hmm, you are to keep this matter buried deep within you; you are not to mention it again!" Meng Xinghai instructed his confidant. He waved his hand, dismissing the black-clad man. Meng Xinghai stood by the window, saying, "To be able to withstand so many layers of Heavenly Light impact without dying, such a talent... will make the Cui family regret." He smiled, saying, "A group of the most outstanding Hidden World disciples are vying for that legendary item, reportedly located in a spiritual cave where Heavenly Light is abnormally concentrated. It seems, then, that if Qingyue were to have a different Golden Armored Guard, she might be able to obtain it and become the ultimate victor."
