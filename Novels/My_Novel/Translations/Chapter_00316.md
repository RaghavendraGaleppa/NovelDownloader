Chapter 316: Wen Caishang’s Fury, The Spirit Fox Banquet, and Xiao Fan as the Guest

Li Xian was in high spirits after hunting the Spirit Fox. He sincerely thanked Gu Nianjun and asked directly how he could repay her. He hated being in debt; without Gu Nianjun’s help, hunting the Spirit Fox would not have been so swift. Although he had promised to teach Gu Nianjun archery to settle the debt, her progress in just a few days was minimal. Gu Nianjun hesitated, intending to drag things out so that Li Xian would have to keep thinking about her.

As they walked down the mountain together, Gu Nianjun’s joy faded, replaced by a sense of loss. She knew that after today, the two of them would likely never hunt together again. Recalling those hunting days, though tiring, they had been quite fulfilling.

Her archery had improved very little; her true intention was not the hunt, but to befriend Li Xian. Occasionally catching a glimpse of his demeanor, her heart fluttered inexplicably with joy. Gu Nianjun said, "Good young hero, we have known each other for some time. It isn't right for you not to show your true face. If you take off your mask and we see each other face to face, we can be true friends."

"As for the reward, please don't be so polite. With your archery skills, you would have caught the Spirit Fox eventually even without my help."

Li Xian cupped his fists and said, "My face is hideous; I wouldn't dirty Miss Gu’s eyes. Catching the Spirit Fox was largely due to your help, Miss Gu. I, Zhou, will always remember this. If I need to repay you in the future, just say the word. I have important matters to attend to, so I must take my leave now."

They parted ways at the city wall. Gu Nianjun wanted to say something but stopped, stomping her foot in frustration. She had originally planned to host a victory banquet to celebrate and introduce him to the other prodigies. Killing the Snow Beast was impressive, but not breathtaking.

Killing the Snow Mountain Spirit Fox was different. The only person to have killed one purely with archery was City Lord He Wentian. Li Xian was very young; the moment he killed the Snow Mountain Spirit Fox, his archery was already on par with He Wentian’s.

His presence was even more impressive. He Wentian was over forty when he barely managed to hunt a Spirit Fox. Li Xian had not yet come of age, or perhaps just barely, yet his heroic spirit was unmatched in the world. Gu Nianjun had a broad vision and high standards; the number of people she genuinely admired could be counted on one hand. Li Xian was now one of them.

Hosting a "Spirit Fox Banquet" would surely cause a sensation throughout the city. At that time, the City Lord would surely be surprised, and the five major sword sects within Flying Dragon City would likely all come to pay their respects.

No one would overshadow him. The fame that the other prodigies sought in Flying Dragon City would surely be seized by Li Xian first.

Gu Nianjun bit her red lips, her eyes slightly red, and muttered softly, "You... you are so cold! I didn't provoke you."

Meanwhile, Li Xian put the Snow Mountain Spirit Fox into a shrinking flesh bag and returned to the city, finally relaxing. He had finally achieved his goal, and his purse was growing heavier. He wandered around aimlessly. The image of the white mask and red bow was conspicuous, but once he took off the red bow, he blended into the crowd.

Originally...

The "White Mask, Red Bow" who hunted Snow Beasts had become famous in Flying Dragon City. This had spread through the marketplace, causing white masks to become popular. Martial wanderers, common folk, and wealthy merchants all followed the trend, wearing white masks to attract attention.

Li Xian went up to a restaurant, ordered a few dishes, and filled his stomach in peace. Suddenly, he heard a commotion in the street and saw a line of armored soldiers hurrying somewhere else. Li Xian raised an eyebrow slightly. He had long known that undercurrents were stirring in Flying Dragon City and didn't want to get involved. Recently, he had focused entirely on hunting. Every morning, he went into the mountains to meet Gu Nianjun, unaware of changes in the situation.

He heard others discussing: "Recently, many women have gone missing for no reason. No one knows who is responsible." "Yes, City Lord He was furious upon hearing this and even sent out the Owl Cavalry." "City Lord He cares for the people and cannot tolerate evil. With him around, we are safe."

Li Xian thought to himself: "Women missing... Could it be that the Flower Cage Sect and others have arrived in Flying Dragon City one after another? The Flower Cage Sect sneaked into Flying Dragon City with the intention of fishing in troubled waters to see if they could gain some benefits. The situation is on the verge of chaos, but why are they showing themselves now?"

"I'm about to obtain the Spirit Treasure, so I must avoid causing trouble."

He ate quietly and paid the bill. Then he went straight back to the inn, sat cross-legged to practice the internal cultivation of his five organs, accumulating proficiency.

**[Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian · Five Organs Chapter]**
**[Proficiency: 6688/24000 Great Perfection]**

Continuous progress. After tempering for two hours, his bones made "popping" sounds. His five organs became stronger, driving his physical body to be more active and energetic. Li Xian reached into his sleeve and pulled out his spear to hone **[Corrupted Ghost Spear]**.

**[Proficiency +1]**
**[Corrupted Ghost Spear]**
**[Proficiency: 3829/35000 Perfection]**

The inn room was quite spacious, about three zhang wide, barely enough to wield a long spear. It required exquisite control of the spear technique; a slight carelessness could break the window or wall, making a mess. Li Xian’s spear technique had been neglected for a long time and he couldn't hold back, so he practiced the spear right there.

After practicing vigorously twice, he put the spear back into his sleeve. Li Xian’s internal Qi settled, and he practiced the Four Directions Fist, Breeze Legs, Green Silk Palm... various basic martial arts. He went through everything he had learned.

Only then, satisfied, did he take out the "Snow Mountain Spirit Fox" and look it over. The Snow Mountain Spirit Fox was entirely blue, its fur pure and flawless, without a speck of dirt. Its blood was fragrant and overflowing, a supreme medicine for healing injuries, with extremely high value.

Its fur was soft and snow-white, suitable for making brushes and other items, fetching a high price. Li Xian gently stroked the fox fur, his mood gradually calming down. Since entering Flying Dragon City, Li Xian had a vague sense of unease. He perfectly matched three conditions: a handsome appearance, strong archery skills, and a tall, straight figure.

He also knew that Snow Mountain Spirit Foxes liked "pure and flawless" things. Those with perfect physiques were more likely to attract this beast. Everything had gone smoothly. Although he had investigated thoroughly—Madam Wang was generous, spending money without blinking, and had a kind face, not looking like a cruel person—he still felt uneasy.

He was sure there were no problems, but as the final step approached... Li Xian couldn't help but go over everything again to eliminate the faint suspicion in his heart.

Li Xian thought: "The vague worry in my heart is mostly because of Madam. I betrayed Madam..."

He shook his head and laughed: "How can it be called betrayal? Am I really supposed to gouge out my eyes for Madam? The right to survive must be held in my own hands. How can I be obedient everywhere?"

"But Madam will definitely see me as a traitor. I fear she will come for me. She is very capable. Although I am hiding in the vast sea of people, I cannot relax. That is where this unease comes from. The many conditions here are all very beneficial to me. I am too smooth, so I worry that Madam is setting a trap."

"But... in the vast sea of people, this world is so big. How can I be sure that this matter is related to Madam? For the sake of killing or capturing me, would Madam really spend thousands of gold? Someone like Madam, who calculates profits and losses so clearly, how could she spend money so recklessly?"

"That's right... Li Xian, Li Xian, you are just a commoner. To Madam, what weight do you carry? Even if she hates you, she wouldn't make a big fuss over you. Now that success is within reach, but you are backing out, that is too cowardly."

Li Xian gradually calmed down. But then he thought again:

"No matter who it is or what their purpose, I must be cautious. Always leave a way out."

The next day.

Li Xian went to Madam Wang's residence as agreed: the Blue Fragrance Pavilion. He didn't rush to enter. Standing on a tall building several streets away, he observed. His eyes revealed double pupils, penetrating through the walls and courtyards.

However, he felt that the pavilion was filled with mist. Li Xian’s double pupils透视 (pierced through), his gaze penetrating the mist, but he couldn't see the scene inside the pavilion. Instead, he saw an ordinary family. Just as he felt strange, he realized the reason instantly.

It turned out that the pavilion contained a Five Elements layout, which was very clever. Layered walls, though difficult to block his double pupils'透视, could deflect his gaze elsewhere through the layout of the pavilion.

Li Xian was looking at the Blue Fragrance Pavilion. But his gaze, after being deflected, saw the ordinary people next door. Li Xian sighed: "This Madam Wang is extremely powerful. Then again... such a person, how could she be easy to窥探?"

He calmed his mind and observed from afar. He stayed for a day but never found a single clue. Several times he wanted to go in to exchange for the Spirit Treasure, but he restrained himself and had to return first.

The next day. Li Xian went to the Blue Fragrance Pavilion again. He ordered a cup of tea, sat high up in the restaurant, and pondered for half a day. Although he always felt worried, he had no basis for it. The wind was clear and the snow was gentle, the scenery was pleasant, and it was very leisurely.

Suddenly, Li Xian’s eyes lit up.

Two days later.

It was said that "Morning Yellow Dew" had appeared for a long time, but no one had obtained it. The Blue Fragrance Pavilion was cold and elegant, and on this day, someone finally knocked on the door.

Xiao Tuan went to open the door and saw a tall, straight figure with long hair flying, a white mask on his face, and a red long bow on his back. Xiao Tuan’s eyes widened in surprise, her gaze strange. She had long known that the rumored "White Mask, Red Bow" was the Madam's "enemy."

Now he had really come to the door, and she secretly marveled at the Madam's methods. In the vast sea of people, she had hooked a vicious fish. Xiao Tuan smiled and asked, "这位英雄 (This hero), do you have business?"

The White Mask, Red Bow cupped his fists and said, "I have hunted a Spirit Fox and come specially to present it to Madam Wang."

Xiao Tuan exclaimed, "Ah! You really caught it? The Madam is taking a noon nap. If you are lying and disturb her sleep, it will be very hard to explain."

The White Mask, Red Bow said, "I dare not lie, please inform the Madam." Xiao Tuan smiled, "Alright then, please come in." She stepped aside, waited for him to enter the pavilion, then closed the door and bolted it.

Xiao Tuan asked, "What is your name, sir?" The White Mask, Red Bow said, "My name is Zhou Ping'an." Xiao Tuan blinked and asked curiously, "Really Zhou Ping'an? Is it an alias?"

The man’s body trembled slightly, he coughed lightly, and said, "It is not an alias, it is indeed Zhou Ping'an."

The two walked slowly in the courtyard. Zhou Ping'an walked in front, Xiao Tuan behind. Xiao Tuan’s gaze scanned him up and down, extremely curious, and also hiding a sense of schadenfreude. She suddenly asked, "Young Hero Zhou is about to see my Madam, won't you take off your mask first?"

Zhou Ping'an said, "I hope you understand, I can only take off my mask when I see Madam Wang." Xiao Tuan said, "Mysterious and spooky. Have you offended some great enemy?"

Zhou Ping'an shook his head and remained silent. The two walked to the flower and bird stone pavilion next to the waterfall. Xiao Tuan pointed to the stone chair and said, "Please sit. I will go ask the Madam. Young Hero, please don't run around. The courtyard isn't big, but a wrong step could be fatal."

Zhou Ping'an said, "Naturally." He sat quietly, drinking tea to pass the time. Xiao Tuan turned into the pavilion and reported to Wen Caishang, saying directly that the White Mask, Red Bow had come to visit.

Wen Caishang smiled upon hearing this and said, "This trap I set is flawless. This little thief is cautious and smart, but he grew up poor and knows that opportunities are rare. He started as a servant, became a guard, and took several steps forward, all taking great risks. He is a young man with great courage. Even if he vaguely senses something is wrong, he definitely doesn't want to give up easily. It seems my guess was correct."

Xiao Tuan said, "Madam understands him so well." Wen Caishang was in a very good mood and said淡淡ly (calmly), "In this world, I must be the one who understands him best. Since he has entered the net, there is no rush. Let him wait in agony. I will take a nap first."

Xiao Tuan smiled, "Good." She ran back to the courtyard and told Zhou Ping'an. Zhou Ping'an smiled, "Being able to wait for Madam's nap is a great honor. I will wait."

Xiao Tuan praised, "Young Hero Zhou has such great demeanor, no wonder you could hunt the Snow Mountain Spirit Fox. When the Madam appears later, you must perform well." Zhou Ping'an said, "Naturally."

He waited like this for an hour. Zhou Ping'an couldn't help but mutter to himself: "Why is this Madam napping for so long?" Bored, he paced around.

Xiao Tuan observed Zhou Ping'an through a hidden grate. She found it amusing and ran to report to Wen Caishang from time to time. Wen Caishang was lying on her side on an "Ice Bed," surrounded by mist, her figure hazy in the mist, her long black hair hanging loosely like a waterfall. Hearing Xiao Tuan's report, she found it very interesting.

Xiao Tuan asked, "Madam, how long do you want him to wait?" Wen Caishang said softly, "Naturally, let him wait for three days and three nights, unable to eat or drink, starving until his skin wastes away, thirsty until his lips crack."

Xiao Tuan shuddered. She had always known the Madam's methods; before even meeting, she had already made people's blood run cold. Xiao Tuan silently mourned: "You are done for. Now you can't run, you can only let the Madam slaughter you. This person is wearing a mask, so we can't see his face clearly, but the only one who could offend the Madam so badly is him. I wonder what face lies under the mask."

Meanwhile, in the courtyard.

Zhou Ping'an had been sitting for two hours and felt his whole body aching, his waist and legs sore, and his whole body uncomfortable. The mist around him was spreading, gradually breeding a chill, obscuring his vision. Xiao Tuan's figure had disappeared, as if there was no one around.

Zhou Ping'an thought: "This is really strange, no wonder that person..." He could no longer sit still. The beautiful scenery around him had become boring. He couldn't help but walk around to observe the other scenery.

As the day grew late.

He felt inexplicably depressed and thought: "Could it be that Madam Wang is intentionally not wanting to give the Morning Yellow Dew, so she is delaying seeing me? If that's the case, since she is unwilling to give it, I will just leave."

He said loudly, "Madam Wang, since you are unwilling to show yourself, then I, Zhou, will not disturb you further. I thought Madam Wang was a woman of her word. Who knew she would bully a junior like this. Hmph."

He甩开袖子 (flung his sleeves) and turned back the way he came. But the further he walked, the more confused he felt. Suddenly, he couldn't distinguish left from right, and up from down. With a "plop," he fell to the ground. His mind was extremely clear, but he couldn't walk properly.

He barely got up, took a few more steps, and fell down again clumsily. Xiao Tuan popped out from the side and laughed, "You fool, didn't I tell you not to run around?"

Zhou Ping'an said, "I was wrong, I was wrong. Please take me out quickly, I don't want the Morning Yellow Dew anymore."

Xiao Tuan smiled, "The Madam is still taking a nap, how can I disturb her? Without her instructions, I can't lead the way." Zhou Ping'an secretly cried out in bitterness: "May I ask when Madam will wake up?"

Xiao Tuan said, "It depends on her mood. Maybe she will wake up in a while, maybe it will be three days and three nights. Ah, why do you need to know this? Just stay put."

Zhou Ping'an said, "Miss... this... this..." Xiao Tuan said, "What is it?"

Zhou Ping'an barely got up, felt a wave of dizziness, and fell heavily to the ground again. He said, "I was wrong. I really don't know where I offended the Madam. Please be kind, help me plead with the Madam to see me. Even if... even if I have no chance with the Spirit Treasure, it... it's better to let me go..."

Xiao Tuan took a step and disappeared into the mist. No matter how Zhou Ping'an called out, there was no response. Xiao Tuan was very amused and reported to the Madam. But she saw the Madam frowning.

Xiao Tuan said carefully, "Madam, you..."

Wen Caishang waved her sleeve and said calmly, "Bring this person to the hall." With a light step of her lotus foot, her figure flickered and she disappeared.

Xiao Tuan did as she was told and brought Zhou Ping'an to the hall. Wen Caishang sat in the main seat and said calmly, "Young Hero, please sit."

Zhou Ping'an felt as if he had been pardoned. He cupped his fists and said, "So Madam Wang was testing me." He quickly sat down in the wooden chair.

Wen Caishang said, "The Snow Mountain Spirit Fox, please take it out and let me see." Zhou Ping'an opened the shrinking flesh bag and presented the Snow Mountain Spirit Fox. Wen Caishang took it and looked at it, nodding slightly. She said, "It is indeed a Snow Mountain Spirit Fox, killed with a single arrow. The bearing of your archery is not bad."

Wen Caishang asked again, "How old are you, Young Hero?" Zhou Ping'an said, "I have just turned eighteen. If Madam doesn't believe it, you can check my bones." Wen Caishang said, "Good, I naturally believe it. Xiao Tuan, bring out the Human Yellow Spirit Treasure, the Morning Yellow Dew."

The Morning Yellow Dew was locked in a "Heaven and Earth Box." Opening the box, yellow and red halos flowed. This object looked like a cloud of mist, yet like a circle of light. It was truly miraculous.

Zhou Ping'an was overjoyed and said, "Madam Wang is truly a woman of her word. You are a role model for our generation."

Wen Caishang raised her hand slightly and smiled, "If Young Hero Zhou meets the conditions, this item should naturally be presented to you. But there is one more condition. I don't know if Young Hero Zhou meets it."

Zhou Ping'an smiled, "What Madam said is probably regarding my appearance. Hahaha, you can rest assured about this. I, Zhou, have never lost in that regard."

Wen Caishang smiled, "Good spirit. Please take off your mask and let me see." Zhou Ping'an took off his mask. His face was fair and quite handsome.

Wen Caishang’s lips curled into a cold smile. She thought secretly: "As expected... this cunning little boy!"

The face under the mask was not Li Xian. It was the rather famous handsome young master of the Li Mountain Sword Sect, "Lei Qingzhi."

It turned out that on that day in the restaurant, Li Xian suddenly had a brilliant idea.

"Yes... Since I can't shake off my worries, why not find someone to help me first exchange for the Morning Yellow Dew? Then I can trade it for the Yellow Nine Ginseng. This move can not only eliminate my doubts but also keep me hidden in the shadows, avoiding being targeted."

"I have already drunk the Yellow Nine Ginseng, so this item is useless to me. I am sacrificing a small profit for safety. But there is still risk in this. If that person wants to swallow the benefit alone, I will lose everything. The pros and cons depend on my judgment. Madam Wang may not have a problem; maybe I am just causing trouble unnecessarily."

He pondered and analyzed. Perhaps it was the instinctive感应 (sensing) of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword, but this dangerous and ominous aura always lingered. But it was too ethereal; it was somewhat forced to ask Li Xian to give up just like that.

Li Xian decided to implement the plan. At noon that day, he headed towards the Snow Dragon Mountain Range. He didn't巡猎 (patrol hunt), only observed the prodigies and heroes who were hunting. He secretly selected a suitable candidate.

Along the way, he saw several people wearing white masks and holding red lacquered bows. He couldn't help but find it amusing. After observing for nearly half a day, Li Xian found Lei Qingzhi's hunting figure. Seeing his handsome face and tall, straight figure, although his archery was average, he could be a partner for cooperation.

Li Xian had his own measure:

"If I ask someone else for help, if the other party plays dirty, takes the Spirit Treasure, and turns their back on me, it is also very possible. If I ask the disciples of the five major sword sects for help, there is no such worry. I can lie that I am also a disciple of the five major sword sects. He wouldn't dare to take advantage or play dirty."

"Otherwise, if this matter is spread, he will lose face, and the alliance of the five major sword sects might be affected."

He immediately took the opportunity to get to know Lei Qingzhi. He lied that he had important matters and couldn't leave, hoping that he could help, tempting him with benefits. Lei Qingzhi came from the "Li Mountain Sword Sect." Although there were snakes and rats hiding in the sword sect, the style of the sect was relatively upright. On the surface, he didn't look like an evil person.

But he also harbored different intentions. He knew that the reputation of the "White Mask, Red Bow" was growing in Flying Dragon City, and the sect elders were all discussing it. The meeting of the five sword sects was approaching, which was a rare grand event. Through conversation, he learned that the White Mask, Red Bow was also a disciple of the five major sword sects, but because he didn't want to reveal his true body, he wore a mask.

If he was willing to help, he could take the opportunity to replace the "White Mask, Red Bow" identity. If he showed off a little, he could shine brilliantly at the meeting. As for the "Morning Yellow Dew" Spirit Treasure, he had to return it honestly. Otherwise, if things got messy, and they were both from the five major sword sects, if they confronted each other in the hall, he didn't have such archery skills and would be exposed instantly. On the contrary, if he followed the other party's wishes and let the other party make a fortune quietly, the other party would naturally help him inherit this identity.

So they reached an agreement. Lei Qingzhi pretended to be "Zhou Ping'an" and came to exchange for the Spirit Treasure.

In the evening, Wen Caishang personally observed Lei Qingzhi's actions and vaguely sensed that this young man was not Li Xian. So she immediately met him and asked for the "Snow Mountain Spirit Fox." Seeing that this person really had a Snow Mountain Spirit Fox, and observing the arrow wound on the fox's body, she knew it must have come from Li Xian.

She instantly understood that Li Xian still had concerns. He secretly found someone to replace his identity to help test the waters. If she was really Madam Wang, she would naturally hand over the Morning Yellow Dew, and Li Xian would get it from Lei Qingzhi later. After the matter was done, he would leave without a trace, hiding his name. He was very shrewd. If she wasn't Madam Wang, she definitely wouldn't give the Human Yellow Spirit Treasure, and he could see the clues and escape before showing his head.

Wen Caishang flashed a severe look. She knew that in terms of knowledge, she surpassed Li Xian by several degrees, but in terms of strategy, she couldn't压 him (suppress him) by a single bit. She had spent a fortune to set a trap, but it was always guarded against and resolved. If she pretended to hand over the Human Yellow Spirit Treasure and secretly tracked Lei Qingzhi, it would just be another round of sparring with Li Xian. But Li Xian was cautious and smart, and would surely have a countermeasure. Going back and forth like this was really boring.

She had always been superior to others since childhood. Now seeing Li Xian's martial path showing signs, his talent was astonishing, his strategy was gradually forming a trend, and he seemed to have suppressed her, she felt an inexplicable anger.

Lei Qingzhi smiled lightly, thinking that this Madam Wang had been mesmerized and lost in thought. He couldn't help urging her. Wen Caishang gradually came back to her senses and smiled lightly, "This Young Hero Zhou, hmm... although your appearance is handsome, unfortunately, the Morning Yellow Dew is still not fated for you."

Lei Qingzhi said, "Why?" Wen Caishang smiled, "Because you are not handsome anymore."

Lei Qingzhi was stunned. He suddenly saw a sword mark on his face, starting from his lips, crossing the bridge of his nose, and extending straight to his forehead. It was hideous and terrifying. Lei Qingzhi was full of terror, but didn't dare to be angry.

Wen Caishang threw a mirror at him and asked, "Are you still handsome?" Lei Qingzhi tremblingly picked up the copper mirror and saw that his face was ruined. He was more afraid than angry. His face could be repaired if ruined. If he said the wrong thing now, his life would be in danger. He said, "Madam... Madam Wang... you... you..."

Wen Caishang said coldly, "The Spirit Fox was not hunted by you. You dared to deceive me. I want to kill you, so what?"

Lei Qingzhi was speechless and quickly begged for mercy. Wen Caishang said, "With your demeanor, you dare to pretend to be him? Hmph. I won't kill you. Go tell that thief that Madam Wang's surname is Wen. Let him listen well."

Lei Qingzhi said joyfully, "Thank... thank you for sparing my life. I will, I will." Wen Caishang said, "Get lost!"

Lei Qingzhi fled in panic. He stumbled along the way but managed to escape unharmed. Xiao Tuan asked, "Madam, you scared him away like that. This person is really as cunning as a fox."

Wen Caishang's eyes flashed. "Yes, as cunning as a fox. It's difficult to catch him with tricks. Sparring with him further is just annoying. Xiao Tuan, go inform everyone below to immediately prepare the Spirit Fox Banquet and invite the one who hunted the Spirit Fox. At the banquet, invite Li Xiaofan."
