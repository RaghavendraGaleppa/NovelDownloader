# Chapter 624: Divine Lineage

Fragments of information surged forth like a flood out of control: desperate cries, the clang of metal colliding, the pungent scent of blood, burning villages, the roars of giant beasts, and finally, the corrosive venom spewed from a massive maw...

The information was fragmented and chaotic, mixed with intense emotional fluctuations.

However, Xu Yunfan quickly grasped the general content.

This world was indeed the magical realm he had seen in his past life, and there were countless so-called gods in the sky—Gods of Harvest, Goddesses of Luck, Gods of Light...

Xu Yunfan quickly captured several key pieces of information.

This world was called Aitira, a place where magic flourished.

Deep within the forest lurked various巨兽 (giant beasts) eroded by chaotic aura, far more powerful than the Iron-armored Storm Whale from just now.

To the north seemed to be a region of immense danger, known as the Rotting Heart Swamp. That was the direction he had been fleeing, but he had been ambushed by a terrifying giant beast named the Venom-spiked Spineback Dragon, leading to the annihilation of his entire force.

The warning he gave seemed to be about the unspeakable terror from the direction of the Rotting Heart Swamp; it was definitely not just a giant beast.

However.

Xu Yunfan's divine sense spread out imperceptibly, sensing several auras lurking deep within the forest.

Not bad, just the level of having just entered Foundation Establishment.

Xu Yunfan withdrew his hand and looked at the heavily injured knight. The spiritual essence of the surrounding plants and trees rapidly gathered, a green light glowing at his fingertip before falling into the knight's brow.

Just because of the knight's shout from earlier, Xu Yunfan didn't actually want to do anything to him.

As the green light entered his body, the knight trembled violently. The aura of impending death suddenly halted and began to rapidly stabilize.

"Th-thank you, what did you do?"

The knight felt his energy rapidly recovering and was overjoyed. He discovered his injuries were healing.

He thought he was going to die here.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the surrounding plants that were gradually withering and replied, "I just plundered the vitality of these plants to treat you. No need to thank me."

The knight's grateful expression stiffened slightly, becoming somewhat restrained.

Spells that can plunder other life forces to restore oneself are basically of the unorthodox path.

Xu Yunfan was too lazy to say more. Having obtained what he wanted from the knight, he naturally prepared to heal his own injuries and then verify the conjecture in his heart.

This place was not suitable for staying long. He needed to immediately find a hidden location to focus on healing and restore his strength.

Watching Xu Yunfan's figure quickly disappear, the knight secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

Although he was very grateful for Xu Yunfan's treatment, it was better to have minimal contact with someone who leans towards the chaotic and disorderly faction.

Who knows if the other party's next thought would be to use him for an experiment.

Xu Yunfan did not go deep into the forest. Avoiding the direction of the Rotting Heart Swamp to the north, which emitted an ominous aura, he chose a mountain forest with relatively stable energy flow.

Finally, he found a cliff cave covered by vines. Xu Yunfan immediately set up multiple restrictions.

He extracted starlight from the Star Spirit Banner to construct a tracking-concealing array disk, used the Divine霄 Thunder to set up a protective barrier, and used the Illusory Demon restriction of the Hundred Desires Peak to confuse perception.

Layer upon layer, striving to isolate the inside from the outside.

Only after finishing all this did he truly sit down and take out the Star Spirit Banner.

The banner surface moved without wind, crackling loudly.

Ye Xuan's phantom was forcibly summoned. The fear on her face had mostly receded, replaced by deep despair, anger, and disbelief.

"Xu Yunfan, you treacherous and shameless villain. You go back on your word, unworthy of being a cultivator!

You have disgraced the Primordial Origin Sect's face. True Lord Qingyuan will surely grind your bones and scatter your ashes!"

She knew that falling into the other party's hands meant an end of either complete death or becoming a tool without consciousness.

Xu Yunfan watched her phantom struggle and roar with an expressionless face, as if watching a clown.

When her cursing paused slightly, he spoke indifferently, his voice without a ripple.

"You're right about being treacherous and shameless, but it's not about losing face. I think if the other True Persons of the Primordial Origin Sect knew about my deeds, they would all give me a thumbs up. This is the standard for people of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Besides, when did I promise to spare you? I just gave you a chance to choose a way to live, and you chose this path yourself."

Reasonably speaking, Ye Xuan was extremely malicious. If not for his exotic treasure, the Void-crossing Boat, he would have been killed by the Chaos Birth and Destruction Mystic Light in the界海 (Boundary Sea).

At that time, although Ye Xuan would also die, if it was close to the Taihua Lingxu World, Ye Xuan's soul and true spirit would likely be sucked into the Samsara Bitter Sea.

With the size of the Ye family of the Wansheng Sword Sect, they would definitely be able to guide Ye Xuan back after reincarnating her.

This woman is ruthless enough, and vicious enough.

But fortunately, the coordinates were correct.

He paused, his eyes icy cold.

"As for Qingyuan? Rest assured, before I get ground to dust and scattered to ashes, I will let you experience what true living hell is like."

Before the words faded, the Star Spirit Banner's dark light surged, instantly swallowing Ye Xuan's phantom completely.

As the Banner Lord, he was the master of the space within the banner.

Immediately after, an extremely shrill, inhuman scream faintly came from within the banner. It was the terrible torment endured during the process of forcibly refining the soul into a Banner Spirit.

This process lasted for a moment, the scream gradually weakening, finally turning into a dead silence.

Soul refining complete.

A new Ye Xuan Banner Spirit was added to the banner.

Actually, refining a Banner Spirit didn't require making the other party suffer so much.

Xu Yunfan deliberately wanted to crush Ye Xuan's high and mighty arrogance.

As a major cultivation family, the Ye family has a deep foundation. The previous Sect Leader of the Wansheng Sword Sect came from the Ye family. If Ye Xuan were to escape, the consequences would be obvious to foresee.

Subsequently, Xu Yunfan used the evil methods of the Hundred Desires Peak to brutally plunder her remaining origin essence, forcibly replenishing his own losses.

This pure Sword Cultivator soul power turned into a scorching energy torrent flowing into his Dao Foundation. It briefly clashed with his own Divine霄 Thunder spiritual power and his Anger-Killing Sword Intent, followed by tearing pain.

Xu Yunfan let out a soft groan and forcibly refined it.

He quickly absorbed it, then merged with a tiny strand of metal attribute sword Dao comprehension. The cracks covering his soul healed slightly.

After completing these, Xu Yunfan finally had time to check his own condition.

His spiritual power was nearly ninety percent depleted, his Divine霄 Dao Body was severely injured and covered in cracks.

The three life-saving Sword Intents were completely exhausted.

The Star Spirit Banner had captured the souls of Ye Yuan and Ye Xuan, two Foundation Establishment Sword Cultivators, slightly improving its quality, but the consumption to drive it was also greater.

Especially Ye Yuan, with his Foundation Establishment perfection Sword Cultivator soul, was enough to increase the power of the Star Spirit Banner by half a percent.

It is truly difficult to improve the power of a top-grade magic treasure by even a tiny bit.

This is why the Ten Thousand Soul Banner is hailed as one of the Primordial Origin Sect's essential magic treasures.

Its growth characteristic will become stronger as the Banner Spirits inside become stronger.

Now, the biggest hidden danger was the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit.

The trump card he wanted to use but dared not use at the end.

Thinking about it now made Xu Yunfan couldn't help but pinch the bridge of his nose.

This item's aura is vast. Once its core power is used in battle, even if one can temporarily obtain part of the power of the Golden Core rank.
