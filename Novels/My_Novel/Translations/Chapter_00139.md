Chapter 139: A Concubine Offered, Yanghua Forges the Body

The Madam whispered her instructions, a subtle warning hidden within.

"Commander Li, will you return after leaving?"

As soon as Commander Li Xianfang stepped out of the inner courtyard, the guards surrounded him, asking one after another. The news of his promotion had spread throughout the manor; no one was unaware.

Li Xian replied seriously, "I am first the Commander of the First Unity Manor, and only then the Wuwei Officer. How could I not return? Do not ask such questions in the future."

The guards all agreed, watching him return to his residence. They continued to discuss excitedly:

"I said it the moment Commander Li entered the manor—his achievements would be extraordinary. Looking at it now, it truly has come true."

"Commander Li is only sixteen years old. Not only has he earned the Madam's favor, but he has also been appointed an official in the county. How can there be such a lucky person in this world? I am truly envious."

"I say, the Madam's favor is much better than any Wuwei Officer title."

"Alas, Commanders Pang and Ying cannot compare to even a single hair of his. We should take a few more looks at such a divine figure. It will be difficult to see him or speak to him in the future."

"You all only see Commander Li's glory, but you do not know of his diligence. In my opinion, Commander Li's achievements today are inevitable."

"Oh, you seem to know Commander Li quite well."

"I had the honor of living with Commander Li for a period. We had a good private relationship, sharing a fire stove and strolling around the manor."

Li Xian returned to the Commander's courtyard. He changed out of his guard uniform and into his new clothes. The brocade garment fit him perfectly, highlighting his extraordinary and handsome appearance.

Since he had obtained an official title, he naturally had to carry himself with the proper attitude. He tied his long hair back, looking fresh and youthful. Standing there, he truly possessed the air of an official.

"This isn't quite an official robe, but it suits my intentions perfectly," Li Xian said, spinning around, feeling very satisfied.

The attire of a Great Wu official was actually quite good; wearing it made one look very handsome. However, the position of "Wuwei Officer" was an official rank situated between the government and the Jianghu. Therefore, there was no specific official uniform.

Speaking of which, the nature of the Wuwei Officer was somewhat similar to the Patrol Sky Division. But the Patrol Sky Division held high status and great power; the more chaotic the times, the greater their authority over life and death.

Li Xian walked out of the manor.

"Brother Li, you are truly a man of striking appearance!" Lin Guolong sighed with envy.

Li Xian smiled modestly, mounted the red-silk-draped white horse, and rode back to the county town amidst the crowd's簇拥.

Still a few miles from the county, he heard the sound of gongs and drums, firecrackers popping, and an incredible bustle. At the city gate, people were dancing lions to celebrate, and citizens lined the streets on both sides to watch.

This day was truly a triumphant return to his hometown, basking in glory. Within Qingning County, his splendor was unmatched; no one could rival him.

"This is the newly appointed Wuwei Officer. He is the one who saved us," a woman said, lifting her child to gaze upon Li Xian's face.

Li Xian felt the display was too high-profile, but his mind was broad and open. Since it had come to this, he would just go with the flow. Why shouldn't he accept such honor?

He rode all the way into the city, arriving at the Xianmeng Tower on Red Candle Street in Qingning County. This building was the largest in Qingning County. It stood seven stories high, each story three zhang tall. Inside, there were carved beams and painted rafters, exquisite paintings hanging like curtains, and dim, flickering lights. It was the height of luxury.

"I used to be unable to even enter Red Candle Street, yet now I am drinking and making merry in Qingning County's premier tavern. Among all the 'friends' filling this building, who would have given me a second glance in the past?"

"Now, they all smile at me, are timid in my presence, and speak with extreme caution. Is this power?... It is good, but I cannot say I particularly like it."

Li Xian dismounted. How can one claim to transcend the mundane world without entering it? How can one claim not to love power without enjoying it?

Li Xian was now enjoying a taste of it. His heart stirred slightly, but that was all.

The tavern's female manager, dressed in her finery, walked over. Her eyes were glued to Li Xian. Upon meeting him, she showered him with auspicious words, praising him from head to toe.

Finally, she said, "New Official Sir, please enter. There are many people inside waiting for you."

"New Official Sir" referred to a newly appointed official parading through the streets. In the Great Wu Empire, a man on his wedding day is also called "New Official Sir" and is exempt from kneeling to officials for that one day, treated as an official.

Li Xian nodded and entered the tavern.

"Wuwei Officer, Sir!"

He saw that all one hundred and eighty tables in the banquet hall were full. The county's merchants, clan elders, and scholars all stood up in unison to greet Li Xian the moment he entered. Their voices were uniform and resonant.

Such a grand reception... for a mere youth. Many dancers and beauties in the Xianmeng Tower, hearing the commotion, looked over. They were all dazzled, having never witnessed such a scene; it was an unforgettable experience for a lifetime.

Li Xian strode in and took his seat without a trace of nervousness. He raised his cup and drank merrily with everyone.

After several rounds of drinks, dancers stepped forward to perform, accompanied by the sounds of the pipa and huqin. Goblets clinked, and there was an abundance of wine and meat.

"Wuwei Officer, Sir, my Lin family has a daughter named Qingwan. She is sixteen years old, the same age as you. If you do not mind, would you accept her as a concubine?"

A member of the Lin clan spoke loudly. He had already brought the daughter along. She was indeed pretty, with delicate features, hiding shyness and joy as she shyly examined Li Xian.

Under the red lanterns, the woman's tenderness offered a unique charm.

Li Xian knew this girl. Lin Qingwan... a famous beauty in Qingning County, the young lady of the Lin family, a proper young lady with accomplished talents, skilled in embroidery. He heard she was already engaged to the young master of the Luo family.

He couldn't help but recall the past. When Li Xian and his younger brother had no money and ragged clothes, their stomachs aching with hunger, they went out of the city to dig for wild vegetables to fill their bellies. At that time, they heard the sound of hooves...

Dressed in splendid brocade, Lin Qingwan was on an outing with the young master of the Luo family. They were accompanied by five or six servants, all neatly dressed.

In contrast, Li Xian had mud all over his hands, wore only a pair of tattered pants, was as thin as a stick, and looked just like a stray dog by the roadside.

"The river flows east for thirty years and west for thirty years. The fortunes of life are truly unpredictable," Li Xian sighed inwardly. He said modestly, "I appreciate the Lin family's kind intentions, but I, Li Xian, am focused solely on martial arts and have no time for romantic affairs. If the young lady of the Lin family were to follow me, I fear it would ruin her life. Let us forget this matter."

The Lin clan elder felt great regret. Lin Qingwan was stunned, and her eyes reddened. She truly admired this young hero, but it seemed they were fated not to be together.

"Wuwei Officer, Sir, I have a vacant residence..."

"Wuwei Officer, Sir, I have a shop..."

Everyone began to speak one after another, offering treasures, women, land, and shops. Li Xian refused some and accepted others. This grand banquet was more exhausting than martial arts training.

In a corner of the banquet hall, Xu Liefeng had arrived upon hearing the news. His gaze was full of hatred, fixed intently on Li Xian. He was now a living wreck, neither human nor ghost. Yet Li Xian was in high spirits, enjoying immense glory, and had even become a Wuwei Officer.

"If I cannot kill you in a month, what meaning is there in my life!" Xu Liefeng's heart roared with fury.

The banquet ended, and the guests dispersed. Li Xian called out to Lin Guolong and asked him about the specific duties of a Wuwei Officer.

Lin Guolong did not hold anything back. He explained the situation in detail. The position of Wuwei Officer was a military post established according to local conditions. Some counties had them, others did not.

The Wuwei Officer had a "Wuwei Hall," similar to a yamen, but it did not handle civil disputes, only matters of the Jianghu. It mediated conflicts between various martial arts schools and factions.

The Jianghu was a mixed bag of dragons and snakes, with many vicious fugitives. The Wuwei Officer also had the duty of capturing Jianghu criminals.

If a war broke out, the Wuwei Officer had the authority to command troops, effectively a minor general.

"Brother Li, you should do well as the Wuwei Officer. In our Great Wu Empire, local Wuwei Officers are selected to join the Patrol Sky Division as minor officers every year. If you seize the opportunity and enter the Patrol Sky Division, your future will be boundless," Lin Guolong said enviously. He then added, "However, you still have a long and arduous road ahead. Judging by the current situation, your position as Wuwei Officer will not be easy."

Li Xian asked, "Why?"

"You don't understand the power dynamics in Qingning County," Lin Guolong said. "The people who just offered gifts were all from major landlord families—the Lins, the Luos, the Zhaos. These people are the shrewdest and have the most wealth. They always try to curry favor with new officials. It's not surprising. Since you don't have much conflict of interest with them, you don't need to pay them too much mind."

"The ones you will truly have to deal with are the Jianghu factions and martial arts schools in the county."

"And these people, not a single one of them came. They are不服气 (bù fú qì - not convinced/submissive) with you and unwilling to be under your command."

Li Xian didn't take it to heart, thinking to himself, "I'm using the position of Wuwei Officer to broaden my horizons. If there are too many trivial matters, I'll just ignore them. Anyway, Qingning County didn't have a Wuwei Officer before."

He smiled and said, "I see. Thank you, Brother Lin." He cupped his fist in salute, mounted his horse, and rode back to the manor.

Inside the First Unity Manor, in the Commander's courtyard, Li Xian stretched his limbs, using his internal energy to expel the alcohol. He changed into a loose cotton robe and let out a comfortable sigh.

At the banquet earlier, some families had offered residences, but he didn't accept them. He preferred to stay at the First Unity Manor. Riding a horse back and forth didn't take long. Moreover, whether as the "Guard Commander" or the "Qingning County Wuwei Officer," they were just empty titles.

Taking them too seriously would only become a shackle. The true foundation for turning his life around was his own strength.

"An official identity is secondary. It's difficult for an official like me to get promoted. Besides, being an official isn't very interesting. Having enough strength to roam the Jianghu is more to my liking."

"What makes me happy is... the Lin and Zhao families gave me three shops. I now have my own businesses, which means a flow of capital."

"I won't have to rely entirely on the Madam, crying out for food, unable to be my own master!"

Two clothing shops and one food shop! If I have time tomorrow, I must go and take a look.

The night was cool. The banquet had been lively and bustling, but Li Xian felt tired and bored. Now, back in his residence, it was quiet and deserted. The sound of cicadas chirped intermittently.

Holding a fine steel sword, his spirit was invigorated, and his martial intent was pure. He disliked hypocrisy and preferred to express himself directly and freely.

His mind moved, and he thrust his sword forward. The tip of the sword trembled violently, making a "humming" sound. Li Xian turned the blade and stabbed backward, executing sword techniques at will. His posture was elegant.

Although the sword technique was incomplete, he practiced it forcefully.

[Proficiency +2]
[Proficiency +2]

Until midnight, a "crack" was suddenly heard as the fine steel sword snapped in two.

[Decaying Sunset Withered Blood Sword · First Layer]
[Proficiency: 14/12000 (Grand Mastery)]
[Description: The sword technique is incomplete, but your will is firm. You have practiced relentlessly, bringing the incomplete sword art to grand mastery. You have领悟ed (lǐngwù -领悟) the 'Scorching Wave' trait, enjoyed Yanghua forging the body, and witnessed the initial scenery of the Way of Martial Arts.]
[Proficiency is sufficient. You can now learn the second layer of Decaying Sunset Withered Blood Sword.]
[Scorching Wave: Your body is like a scorching sun. When this trait is activated, your moves will carry a burning heat.]

A scene unfolded before his eyes. He saw the foot of a green mountain, a small courtyard with a fence. A man and a woman were sparring with swords. Their postures and demeanor were impeccable, their swordplay mixed with playful teasing, creating a joyous atmosphere.

Li Xian suddenly thought, "That's right, if I could get the Yin chapter of the sword art, I could use my 'Heaven's Reward for Diligence' destiny to forcefully practice and advance. In that way, wouldn't I be able to merge the Yin and Yang sword arts into one?"

"However... the Madam would never give it to me for free."

Yanghua forges the body... a wave of fiery energy rose from his Dantian and swept through his entire body.

Superior martial arts, even if split in half and incomplete, have unexpected effects. This "Yanghua forging the body" was an unexpected joy.

Li Xian's body now shimmered with a faint, eerie light. Through his skin, one could see his blood vessels, meridians, and bones... The Yanghua was cleansing his physique.

With a "thump," Li Xian naturally stepped into the "Chest Drum Thunder Sound" realm. But this was merely a side effect!
