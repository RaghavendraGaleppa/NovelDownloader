# Chapter 60: Man Proposes, Heaven Disposes

It was the same lecture hall from five days ago. Chu Ning arrived slightly earlier this time. Currently, there were only about twenty people in the hall. Judging by their relaxed expressions, Chu Ning could roughly guess that these early arrivals had at least achieved the qualifying threshold of a 20% success rate in talisman crafting.

Soon, others began to arrive, most of whom wore expressions of disappointment. Clearly, even a 20% success rate was too high for the majority. As the hall gradually filled up, the other five disciples who had been promoted alongside Chu Ning also arrived, each with different expressions.

Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang appeared calm, making it hard to discern their results. Lu Ming and Chen Jinhua wore faint looks of disappointment—either they hadn't reached the 20% threshold or had barely scraped by with little hope. Jiang Dawei, on the other hand, looked utterly dejected, his spirits crushed—his outcome was obvious without words.

Before long, He Changyou arrived with the attendant surnamed Liu. Standing at the front, He Changyou swept his gaze over the assembled disciples and spoke slowly, "The five days are up. Those who have achieved a 20% success rate in crafting Wood Escape Talismans, step forward."

Immediately, a small portion of the disciples stood up and moved to the front. Chu Ning waited briefly, noticing that none of his five companions seemed inclined to rise. Only then did he stand up and walk forward under their stunned gazes.

"Chu... he..." Jiang Dawei, who had been hanging his head, looked up in disbelief, his mouth agape but unable to form coherent words. The other four also wore expressions of astonishment. As Chu Ning reached the front of the hall, Lu Yunfang murmured softly, "Who would have thought? Junior Brother Chu not only has talent in wood-element spells but also in talisman crafting."

Lu Ming asked enviously, "Do you think he'll make it into the top ten and earn the right to study talismans?" No one answered—no one could. After five days of learning talisman crafting, they all understood that success in this art had little to do with cultivation level. While everyone present could easily attempt dozens of talismans, the number that would actually succeed was another matter entirely.

"Twenty-seven people. Not bad—a few more than I expected," He Changyou remarked. His gaze swept over the group, pausing briefly when he noticed Chu Ning at the back. He was slightly surprised—Chu Ning had only recently been promoted from the D-tier, so he remembered him well. It was unexpected that Chu Ning also seemed to have talent in talisman crafting. However, his expression quickly returned to normal.

"The rest of you, move back and clear the front of the hall. The talisman-crafting test will now begin. Each of you will have ten sheets of talisman paper to craft Wood Escape Talismans. The top ten with the highest success rates will officially qualify to study talismans." With that, He Changyou had the disciples spread out, spacing themselves one table apart to avoid interference. The attendant surnamed Liu then distributed ten sheets of talisman paper to each participant.

Once everyone had taken out their talisman brushes and ink from their storage pouches, He Changyou surveyed the group. "Begin!"

At his command, the twenty-plus disciples picked up their brushes. Chu Ning calmly grasped his, took a light breath, and slowly channeled spiritual energy into it. For him, crafting Wood Escape Talismans was already second nature—when using his divine sense, he had a 70% chance of success. However, he chose not to employ it this time, as He Changyou's presence meant the Foundation Establishment cultivator might detect his divine sense.

Without using his divine sense and not yet fully in the zone, Chu Ning's spiritual energy fluctuated slightly midway through the first talisman. Unsurprisingly, the paper spontaneously combusted into ashes. Around him, others also failed one after another. Chu Ning glanced around subtly, observing their reactions, his own mind unperturbed.

"Everyone here is a beginner, and working under these conditions makes it hard to enter the optimal state for talisman crafting. Mistakes are natural," he thought. Adjusting his focus, he dipped his brush into the ink and began his second attempt.

This time, Chu Ning held nothing back. Though he didn't deliberately use his divine sense, he immersed himself fully in the process. As a result, the second talisman was completed flawlessly. He Changyou, sensing Chu Ning's success—though he wasn't the only one—immediately turned his gaze toward him. Chu Ning allowed a faint smile to surface at the right moment.

Just then, others also succeeded, diverting He Changyou's attention. Seven disciples had succeeded on their second attempt, which immediately increased the pressure on the remaining twenty. Many began to show signs of anxiety, leading to more failures on the third attempt. Chu Ning, however, riding the momentum of his second success, also completed his third talisman, becoming one of only two disciples to have crafted two talismans so far.

For the remaining attempts, Chu Ning controlled his rhythm, ensuring he completed four out of the first nine talismans. Three of the failures were genuine, while one was deliberately botched. Even so, he was still one of only two disciples to have crafted four talismans by this point.

When everyone picked up their final sheet of talisman paper, He Changyou's gaze swept over the two leading disciples. Suddenly, Chu Ning sensed something familiar—divine sense! His heart tightened. He hadn't expected He Changyou to use his divine sense to monitor his crafting at the last moment.

Having trained in divine sense perception himself, Chu Ning knew how sensitive it was—capable of detecting even the slightest fluctuations in spiritual energy. This put him in a dilemma. His original plan had been to ensure four successful talismans out of the first nine, confident that such a 40% success rate would secure him a spot in the top ten without standing out too much. After all, a 40% rate was already impressive for a beginner. Moreover, seeing that another disciple had also completed four talismans, he had intended to deliberately fail the last one to maintain a high but not excessive ranking.

But now, with He Changyou's divine sense focused on him, he hesitated. While it was true that even minor spiritual energy fluctuations could affect success rates, Chu Ning wasn't sure whether intentionally causing such fluctuations would be detectable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"Let nature take its course," he finally decided, resolving to let the last talisman succeed or fail naturally. Because of his momentary hesitation, he started his final attempt slightly later than the other disciple who had also completed four talismans. As a result, he didn't notice when that disciple's talisman combusted midway, marking their failure. Meanwhile, He Changyou's full attention remained fixed on Chu Ning.

Chu Ning proceeded naturally, not forcing anything, which ironically allowed him to perform at his best. When a flash of cyan light signaled yet another successful Wood Escape Talisman, he couldn't help but fall silent, his expression slightly stunned.

"Man proposes, but Heaven disposes!" The final talisman had succeeded after all. He Changyou's eyes gleamed brightly as he looked at Chu Ning—out of ten attempts, Chu Ning had succeeded five times. A 50% success rate!
