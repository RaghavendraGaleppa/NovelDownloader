# Chapter 96: The Grand Gathering of the East Sea

After resting for a full day, the two finally recovered sufficiently.

Over the next few days, they thoroughly explored the ruins of the Joy Sect. Apart from finding some insignificant small items, there were no noteworthy opportunities to be found. After all, the real treasures had already been plundered by various cultivation families and sects half a year prior.

At this point, Lin Fan received a spiritual sparrow that flew in from the horizon. The obedient bird perched on his finger and spoke in a human voice:

"Junior Brother, I've learned about your recent situation. Your senior sister is currently at Turtle Island attending Elder Tortoise's birthday celebration. If you've finished your tasks, you may come find me here."

With a flash of white light, the sparrow transformed into a paper crane and spontaneously combusted in the wind.

Lin Fan then invited Lin Shan to accompany him. Lin Shan hesitated slightly—while following Lin Fan often led to opportunities, he had already accumulated an enormous amount of ancient essence and could return to Yi River to cultivate to the peak of Qi Refinement in preparation for Foundation Establishment.

However, he couldn't refuse Lin Fan's enthusiastic invitation. After all, this sworn brother had just fought alongside him and generously gifted him the Five Elements Fan. It would be ungrateful to abandon him now.

Moreover, Lin Fan assured him this wasn't an adventure but merely an opportunity to broaden his horizons under his senior sister's auspices, with no real danger involved.

"Brother, this is a Golden Core Elder's birthday celebration! Elder Tortoise is a renowned late-stage Golden Core cultivator in the East Sea, specializing in longevity techniques—he's lived over four hundred years!

This grand gathering has drawn countless sects and families. Nearly every island lord of the East Sea is attending—no one would dare cause trouble at such an event.

And after we just defeated a Foundation Establishment cultivator, imagine the fame we'd gain announcing it before all these peers! We'd be renowned throughout Jiangdong and the East Sea! Countless female cultivators would admire us, countless seniors would praise us..."

Lin Shan looked at Lin Fan speechlessly. Was he trying to get them killed? Drawing such attention would inevitably invite trouble from other Foundation Establishment cultivators.

While Lin Fan had powerful backing, Lin Shan was just a minor rogue cultivator who couldn't afford such notoriety.

But he understood Lin Fan's perspective—righteous sect disciples often prioritized reputation over direct confrontation. Prestige determined their standing and resource allocation within sects, hence their constant pursuit of heroic deeds to build fame.

What business did a rogue cultivator like Lin Shan have in such games?

After repeated assurances from Lin Fan that he wouldn't involve Lin Shan in the story of defeating the Foundation Establishment cultivator, Lin Shan reluctantly agreed to accompany him to the East Sea.

The two boarded the cyan jade flying vessel once more, soaring eastward across the skies.

The vessel's quality was truly exceptional—despite multiple instances of overuse, it remained sturdy. As long as they had sufficient mid-grade wind spirit stones, it performed flawlessly.

...

After leisurely flying for half a day, they left the mainland and reached the sea. Salty ocean breezes greeted them as flocks of seabirds passed overhead, their view suddenly expanding dramatically.

Two more days of flight across the azure East Sea brought the silhouette of an island into view—their destination, Turtle Island.

This island, spanning nearly a thousand kilometers, was ruled by the renowned late-stage Golden Core Elder Tortoise. It housed mortal kingdoms, the elder's disciples, and even a precious golden peachwood forest.

Every few decades, the forest produced abundant spirit fruits, while the harvested golden peachwood served as excellent materials for warding off evil spirits. Turtle Island's cultivators prospered greatly from these resources.

Elder Tortoise's high cultivation, seniority, and numerous disciples had secured his uncontested rule over this spiritual land for over a century.

His birthday celebration, held every twenty years, had become one of the East Sea's most famous gatherings.

Countless streams of light streaked across the sky—Foundation Establishment cultivators and above arriving with their disciples to offer congratulations. Below, the sea surface teemed with countless ships carrying lesser cultivators hoping to partake in the festivities at the island's base, where Elder Tortoise provided open banquets with spirit fruits and wines.

Lin Shan and Lin Fan landed at the mountainside plaza at the island's center, where a young female cultivator in light blue robes awaited them.

With striking natural beauty and an air of martial vigor, she wore her hair tied back and carried two swords—one blue, one purple. Smiling at their arrival, she remarked:

"Junior Brother, to think you've achieved a realm-transcending kill against Foundation Establishment within just three years of cultivation! I've inquired about that Monk Xing Tai—he was quite notorious in Jiangdong. To fall at your hands is quite the misfortune."

Lin Fan waved off the praise modestly before introducing Lin Shan:

"Senior Sister, this is my clansman Lin Shan. We defeated Monk Xing Tai together. As a rogue cultivator, he wishes to avoid unnecessary trouble, so I won't be mentioning his involvement."

He then introduced the formidable woman to Lin Shan:

"Clansman, this is my senior sect sister, Lei Yu Zi. She's currently traveling and was invited by Elder Tortoise upon passing through the East Sea. We're benefiting from her connections."

Lin Shan promptly saluted Lei Yu Zi. After exchanging pleasantries, the trio proceeded toward the mountaintop where the three-day celebration was already underway, with most guests having arrived.

Along the path, East Sea cultivators frequently approached to network, having clearly researched Lei Yu Zi's identity. The martial woman showed little interest in socializing, offering only perfunctory responses until the would-be acquaintances departed disappointed.

At the summit, a grand scene unfolded.

A central pathway led to a high platform where a white-bearded elder—undoubtedly Elder Tortoise—conversed jovially with guests, likely fellow Golden Core cultivators.

Rows of seating flanked the path, mostly occupied by guests enjoying fine wines and spirited discussions. Servants circulated with spirit wines and fruits, creating an atmosphere of grand celebration.

Lei Yu Zi led them to more secluded seating at the rear, her preference for quiet aligning with Lin Shan's. Lin Fan found the location too isolated but refrained from objecting in his senior sister's presence.

As they dined, they occasionally glanced at the central performances—mermaid maidens' dances, clam- and turtle-people's musical performances—all uniquely East Sea flavors.

Lin Shan observed these exotic races with fascination. Nearby guests explained that these sea tribes held significant power in the outer seas, collectively rivalling human forces, though internal divisions kept them at a disadvantage. Many were captured and sold as slaves.

Over time, owning sea tribe servants became commonplace in the East Sea, with prices plummeting—a mere hundred spirit stones could purchase two mermaid or sirene maidservants.

Lin Shan couldn't help but consider acquiring some—far cheaper than at Yi River's auctions—and made a mental note to visit Turtle Island's markets before departing.

...

As noon approached, chimes sounded from the high platform, quieting the crowd as an announcer stepped forward to commence formalities.

After half an hour of ceremonial speech, the announcer declared with a grand gesture:

"Let the East Sea Grand Gathering officially begin!"
