# Chapter 5: Taking Off Again! Achieving Talisman Freedom! A Thousand Talismans!

"You! What nonsense are you spouting!" The young man bared his teeth at Lin Yun.

"I'm doing business with this fellow Daoist! What does it have to do with you?" the young man angrily retorted. "Don't ruin my deal!"

"Hmph—" Lin Yun snorted coldly, then revealed his cultivation at the tenth level of Qi Refinement. The young man, only at the ninth level, paled and took a step back.

"Brother Han, let me see your pills," Lin Yun said to Han Li.

Han Li, curious about the situation, nodded and handed the pills to Lin Yun.

After sniffing them, Lin Yun declared confidently, "Just as I suspected."

"Brother Han, although these pills of yours are ordinary mortal medicine and not top-grade spiritual medicine for cultivators, the herbs you used are of extremely high age—the youngest being at least a hundred years old, with some even reaching two hundred!"

"Moreover, you have five bottles with twenty-five pills in total. With such quantity, even if the efficacy isn't the strongest, it's definitely enough to help someone at the tenth level of Qi Refinement break through their bottleneck and reach the eleventh level, greatly increasing their chances in the Ascension Tournament!"

"These twenty-five pills alone are worth at least fifty spirit stones. If you find someone urgently needing to break through to the eleventh level, you could even sell them for sixty or seventy spirit stones!"

"Meanwhile, your Flying Talisman is worth thirty spirit stones at most, that spellbook is practically worthless—three spirit stones tops—and that stack of blank talisman paper is worth one spirit stone at best!"

"Fellow Daoist, the difference is twice the value! Don't you think you're being too greedy?!" Lin Yun rebuked sharply.

"Nonsense! These are just mortal pills—how could they possibly be worth what you're claiming!" The young man panicked under Lin Yun's accusations.

Seeing his flustered expression, Han Li understood the trickery at play.

"Hmph—" Lin Yun snorted again. "Under normal circumstances and in other places, these pills wouldn't fetch such a high price!"

"But this is the right place, and this is the right year!"

"The Ascension Tournament is about to begin. If my brother sets up a stall here, he'll surely attract cultivators at the tenth level of Qi Refinement!"

The young man wanted to argue, but seeing Lin Yun's tenth-level cultivation, he knew it was futile. After all, wasn't the very person standing before him proof—someone desperate to break through?

After Lin Yun's explanation, Han Li realized that the value of his pills had risen due to the upcoming Ascension Tournament, much like how prices for goods in his hometown would spike during the New Year.

Though Han Li didn't particularly care about these few bottles of pills, he was deeply grateful for Lin Yun's intervention.

"If you're not willing to make up the difference, then don't blame me for being impolite." Lin Yun flipped his hand, revealing seventy spirit stones—each the size of a thumb, glowing faintly.

"You—" The young man's expression shifted before he finally conceded. "Fine! I'll make up the difference."

He could tell Lin Yun also wanted the pills. If he hadn't already sold the Flying Talisman to Han Li, Lin Yun might have snatched the deal for himself.

In the end, the young man handed Han Li another thirty-five spirit stones.

Looking at the spirit stones and the Flying Talisman in his hands, Han Li couldn't hide his joy.

Just moments ago, he hadn't possessed a single spirit stone. Now, he had thirty-five—and the Flying Talisman to boot.

"Brother Lin, thank you," Han Li said sincerely.

"No need for thanks!"

"This is simply what you deserved," Lin Yun replied calmly, though inwardly he was ecstatic upon seeing the system notification.

**[Ding! Host has spoken up for a friend, triggering 'Return Kindness with Kindness.']**  
**[Ding! Congratulations, host has obtained:]**  
- **1,000 low-grade primary talismans (Fireball Talisman, Ice Arrow Talisman).**  
- **200 mid-grade primary talismans (Diamond Talisman, Flying Sword Talisman, Great Fireball Talisman, Earth Spike Talisman).**  
- **200 high-grade primary talismans (Ice Spear Talisman, Earth Wall Talisman, Fire Cloud Talisman, Ten Thousand Arrows Talisman, Heavenly Thunder Talisman).**

**[Talisman Description: Primary talismans were obtained after Han Li secluded himself for four years post-Foundation Establishment. Intermediate talismans were acquired after Han Li reached Core Formation and practiced in the Chaotic Star Sea.]**

"Holy—"

"Good, good, good—"

Lin Yun couldn't suppress his delight. With over a thousand low-grade talismans and a hundred intermediate-grade ones, he had essentially achieved talisman freedom!

Han Li, my dear friend!

At this point, Lin Yun wasn't just confident against Qi Refinement cultivators—he could even take on a Foundation Establishment expert if one showed up!

All fear stems from insufficient firepower!

Han Li and Lin Yun continued browsing the market. Han Li took an interest in two books—*The Complete Compendium of Five Elements Primary Spells* and *Fundamentals of Water Spell Talismans*—but their prices (ninety and sixty spirit stones, respectively) were beyond his means.

Though the books were thick and packed with spells, Han Li couldn't afford them. His earlier excitement over the thirty-five spirit stones quickly faded.

To avoid complications, he decided against selling more of his pills and returned with Lin Yun to their group's pavilion.

As they approached the palace-like structures, Han Li noticed their exquisite craftsmanship—built from rare tung wood and massive bluestone, adorned with carvings of dragons and phoenixes, and faintly pulsing with spiritual energy.

"This must be the defensive formation Brother Lin mentioned," Han Li thought.

Upon arrival, Lin Yun demonstrated how to open the formation with a talisman before handing it to Han Li, who quickly grasped the method.

Inside, Lin Yun pointed at a glowing cyan barrier enveloping one of the pavilions. "Brother Han, the earlier formation was just a basic one. This is the real deal."

Han Li observed the barrier—shaped like an inverted bowl—and tested it with a finger. It felt soft yet elastic, resisting with gentle force when pressed.

"Use the same method as before to open it," Lin Yun instructed.

Nodding, Han Li performed the hand seals and pressed the talisman against the barrier. Ripples spread across the cyan light, forming an opening just large enough for them to pass through.
