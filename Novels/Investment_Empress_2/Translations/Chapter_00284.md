# Chapter 284: Deducing the Monkey King Again? Han Zhen is Stunned

This was the final month that the Suspended Temple remained in the Southern Frontier, and the day to depart had finally arrived.

During this time, Li Mo and Ying Bing had visited the various clans' Cavern Heavens together, bringing the light of the Jade Phoenix God to each clan and fulfilling their initial promise.

The sunlight of early winter, even when emitted by three suns together, could not bring much warmth into the room.

"Princess Xiao Jiang has made quite a bit of progress recently."

Li Mo opened his eyes.

Over the past month, he had completed sixty of the Seventy-Two Transformations, with only twelve left. Moreover, he discovered that the transformations within the Seventy-Two Transformations could actually be projected into his small world.

Of course, they still were not life forms.

Thus, Princess Xiao Jiang gained many more sparring partners and many more silent companions. From them, she领悟ed many sword techniques, which she then obediently handed over to her master for guidance.

The Heavenly尊, Little Li, stated that her Sword Dao no longer needed to be changed by others; she should just follow her heart.

That was Bing Duzi's recent evaluation of Li Mo's swordsmanship.

"My martial arts comprehension has also surpassed a thousand years."

"Recently, there aren't any martial arts I'm in a hurry to master."

Li Mo looked at the water tribes playing outside the window and briefly took stock of the gains from his recent investments in the System space.

He currently had three Golden Mountains left, still not having recovered to his peak period.

But he was still Li, the wealthy and extravagant Mo.

Among the feedback from the demon clans, there were many types of rare treasures, such as huge pearls... sunk-gold red sandalwood... cold-smoke jade... if these were converted into money, the exact value is unknown, but it would certainly be enough to give the richest man in Yunzhou a couple of heart attacks.

There were also plenty of top-quality natural treasures and rare elixirs.

"Bing Duzi should be about done refining the Jade Phoenix God..."

Just as he thought this.

[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Ying Bing' and helping her refine the Jade Phoenix God.]

[Investment Feedback]: "Gilded Creation Seal."

"Bing Duzi has completely refined the Jade Phoenix God?!"

A delicate seal covered in profound tadpole-like patterns appeared in Li Mo's palm, and he couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement.

With the Gilded Creation Seal.

Could he upgrade the "Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao"?

He instinctively took out the God-Viewing Diagram and took a deep breath.

*Smack*—

The Creation Seal came into contact with the God-Viewing Diagram, but it was different from before.

Nothing happened.

"Hm?"

Little Li refused to believe it and stamped it again.

*Smack*—

Still no reaction.

"That's strange."

Li Mo was completely baffled.

The "Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao" couldn't be the problem first; he had drawn it himself, and it had been upgraded by the Creation Seal later. He had been comprehending it for so long.

I've even seen Brother Monkey, so it definitely can't be a problem.

The Creation Seal from the System?

That's even less likely to be a problem.

So, which part of the process is wrong?

"Could it be... that it can't be upgraded because of me?"

Li Mo thought it over and over but couldn't come up with an answer.

So he put away the Creation Seal and walked towards the window in the early winter morning light.

He saw Ying Bing quietly sitting by the water's edge, drinking tea. Her profile was flawless, and her moon-white skin appeared even paler under the pale sunlight, as if seeing her was like seeing the first snow of winter.

Li Mo picked up his teacup and took a sip.

"Bing Duzi, if one initially observed a Lower Form, could they later turn it into an Upper Form?"

"Of course, it's possible."

Ying Bing glanced at him, observing the youth, then said softly:

"If a person's talent is exceptionally strong, a mere Lower Form is unworthy of them. Once they have perfected the Lower Form, they can naturally turn it into a Middle Form."

"This is extremely, extremely difficult. Even with immense talent, it might take a lifetime, but it is not impossible."

The Sect Master?

Li Mo thought of the Clear Abyss Sect Master who transformed from a sparrow into a great roc.

He couldn't help but ponder.

The Creation Seal not helping him deduce further might be because he has not yet perfected the "Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao"?

Or is it because some necessary condition is still missing?

It seems he can only perfect the Seventy-Two Transformations first,领悟 the Somersault Cloud, and then try again...

When the cart reaches the mountain, there will be a road. What is his will be his; there's no need to rush.

If he were to be so impatient, what about those who start with a Lower Form and spend their entire lives only reaching a Middle Form?

---

Mentally admonishing himself not to be greedy, Li Mo then smiled and said:

"Bing Duzi, guess what form I want to deduce?"

"What?"

"The Ultimate Form!"

"Then I'll wait for you to become the first person to deduce a Great Dao Divine Form."

Watching the youth speak so seriously with his nonsense, Ying Bing propped her chin up with one hand, a hint of helplessness in her eyes.

The childish streak is coming out again...

Hm?

Li Mo was taken aback by her words.

So, Bing Duzi's meaning is that no one has ever turned the Ultimate Form into a Great Dao Divine Form by themselves?

Meaning, Great Dao Divine Forms are all naturally born in the world?

At this moment, at the entrance to the Cavern Heaven, a sudden commotion arose.

The Demon Kings and great demons who were preparing to return to their clans all came to bid farewell, bringing their people with them.

"Thank you, Heavenly Flood Dragon, thank you, Goddess of the Blue Phoenix."

"If there is ever a need in the Southern Frontier in the future, you must come find our Giant Whale Clan."

"Please accept these few Sea Ginseng roots..."

They came, but they all brought gifts.

........

Meanwhile.

In the Southern Frontier, the森羅 Valley.

This place was shrouded in poisonous miasma and thick fog all year round; even a God-Viewing Realm expert would be in mortal danger if they inhaled even a little.

Above, in the stone hall, a few candle flames illuminated the darkness. Over a dozen teams of shamans wearing bronze masks climbed the steps. If Li Mo were here, he would have recognized that the shaman he saw last time was among them.

At this moment, Han Zhen, clad in a blood-red robe, was sitting beneath the bronze tree in the stone hall, one of his arms was empty.

"Has the power of the masses been collected?"

Han Zhen narrowed his eyes and took a deep sniff.

The cloud-patterned jade artifacts in the shamans' hands seemed to become real, the mist converging around him. Whether it was an illusion or not, his complexion became a bit more ruddy.

"Not bad, more than usual. How was it done?"

"Because the God's Sons all went to the Suspended Temple."

A shaman holding a jade artifact replied.

"Hm, by my calculations, they should be returning from the Suspended Temple soon."

Han Zhen let out a foul breath from his chest.

Having lost the Blood Phoenix Essence, he had set his sights on the Jade Phoenix God very early on. That was something the Great Shang Dynasty had sent to the heavens, stored at the Suspended Temple.

Unfortunately, Huai Kong was pedantic, and Shang Qinqing was of one mind with that bald donkey; otherwise, he wouldn't have needed to send Zhiduo and the others to retrieve it.

*Thud*—

A crow with blood-red eyes flew through the poisonous miasma and into the stone hall, transforming into a gaunt, pale middle-aged man.

"Why are you back alone?"

This Fourth-Rank Demon King was someone Han Zhen had sent to support Zhiduo and the others.

A Demon King is equivalent to a human Law and Body expert, which should have been more than enough.

"Zhiduo is dead."

"What about the others?"

"The same."

"Impossible!"

Han Zhen shot to his feet.

It would be more plausible to say that Zhiduo took the Jade Phoenix God and ran himself. With so many God's Sons from the Hidden Dragon List, having absorbed so much power of the masses, and the methods he gave them.

How could they all have died while competing for the Jade Phoenix God?

"The Jade Phoenix God?" Han Zhen glanced at the damaged bronze divine tree, as if he had already confirmed the matter, his tone turning cold.

"It was obtained jointly by the Black Flood Dragon Clan's Hei Mo and the Blue Phoenix Clan's Luan Bing."

The middle-aged man who had transformed from the black crow said quietly.

Mo?!

Bing?!

These two words exploded in his ears like a bolt of lightning.

"What do they look like?!" Han Zhen's voice became sharp.

"..."

The middle-aged man from the black crow plucked two of his own feathers. The feathers ignited without a flame, burning into black ash.

The ash on the ground outlined the appearance of the two.

Han Zhen was stunned.
