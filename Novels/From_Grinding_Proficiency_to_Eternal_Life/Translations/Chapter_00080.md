# Chapter 80: The Demon-Exterminating Heavenly Army

Xu Yunfan stood in the center of the city, silent for a long time. The incense cult uprising in Wuzhou had labeled the Empress as a "Great Deceiving Demoness" and called themselves the Demon-Exterminating Heavenly Army. Under the harsh governance of the Great Zhou, the rebel forces spread like wildfire, igniting a massive uprising of millions within just a few months, plunging the entire Wuzhou into utter chaos.

In such circumstances, could the martial arts sects of Wuzhou still exist?

With doubts in his heart, Xu Yunfan slowly walked to a wall and reached out.

The adobe wall turned to tofu under his hand, easily pierced through.

In the next second, a thin, small figure was dragged out from behind the wall by him.

Looking at the person in his hand, Xu Yunfan's arm shook slightly, making the person dizzy, then casually tossed him onto the ground.

It was a young boy. Surviving in this cannibalistic environment was truly not easy. Judging by the boy's face, however, there were strands of meat stuck between his gritted teeth...

He looked up at the ruined walls of Dingbei City. It seemed that only by doing such things could one survive.

"I ask, you answer."

Xu Yunfan's cold voice sounded by the boy's ear, like a chilling wind, making the boy's heart shiver slightly.

He hurriedly knelt on the ground, not daring to look up, and said, "Please speak, Great Master!"

"Why did Dingbei City become like this?"

"It's... it's because after the Demon-Exterminating Heavenly Army broke the city, the general, Qi Tian, ordered the army to massacre the city for three days."

Speaking of this, the boy's body trembled violently. When he looked up, snot and tears covered his face, and he wailed, "My mother and sister were violated to death by them. My older brother was forced by blades to join them and became one of their gang. My little sister, who had just learned to walk, became their meal on the table, Great Master!!"

Xu Yunfan felt a pang in his heart, his expression turning heavy. He let out a breath and asked.

"Do you know where Mount Jilei is?"

Upon hearing this, the boy wiped his snot and tears and said, "I heard from traveling merchants before that if you walk out of the south gate of Dingbei City for a thousand miles, you can reach Mount Jilei."

Xu Yunfan stepped forward to help him up. Just as he was about to ask more, the boy kneeling on the ground suddenly sprang up. A cold light from his sleeve shot straight towards Xu Yunfan's throat.

"Clang!"

The War Drum Golden Hammer was held horizontally in front of his neck, sparks exploding in the twilight.

Xu Yunfan looked at the broken dagger and suddenly smelled a faint, sweet, and fishy scent from the boy's mouth—the unique rotting smell of human flesh.

The boy's face turned red, looking like he was crazy, staring at him with full of hatred.

"What did they feed you?"

Xu Yunfan grabbed the boy, pressing his thumb against the boy's Adam's apple. Under the skin, the wriggling blood vessels clearly had tiny worms moving within them.

The boy's eyes suddenly filled with bloodshot veins, and the veins on his neck bulged.

"The Bright Lord descends! Flesh and blood ascend to immortality!"

The roar didn't sound human. Dense red flesh buds crawled out from his seven orifices.

Xu Yunfan quickly retreated three steps, watching the human shell explode with a bang. The chunks of flesh and blood ignited as they hit the ground, turning into eerie blue phosphorescent flames.

Xu Yunfan's expression turned unsightly. The fact that this boy could survive was inseparable from the Demon-Exterminating Heavenly Army led by the incense cult. He was afraid that something had been planted in his body.

Since he had the information, Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated and prepared to head south. A distance of a thousand miles, with the Red Date Horse's speed along the official road, would only take two or three days.

Just as he was about to leave Dingbei City, a cry suddenly came from the side of the broken city gate.

Xu Yunfan squeezed his horse's belly hard.

The Red Date Horse neighed and crashed through the half-collapsed city gate. The view suddenly opened up. On the official road thirty zhang away, over a hundred refugees were being herded into a circle by black-armored cavalry. The "Demon-Exterminating Heavenly Army" battle flag carried by one of the cavalrymen was still stained with dried brain matter.

At the moment a warrior general's eighteen-foot snake spear pierced a pregnant woman and lifted her high, Xu Yunfan's arm muscles bulged and swelled. The War Drum Golden Hammer in his hand had already flown out from the saddle.

The heavy hammer tore through the air with a muffled thunderous roar. The first three cavalrymen were crushed into meat paste along with their horses.

Xu Yunfan galloped through the blood mist. The moment he reached out and grabbed the hammer handle, the blood energy around him erupted violently.

His muscles swelled like they were being blown up, his tight clothes were torn into strips, his exposed skin took on a reddish-copper luster, and his spine cracked like firecrackers.

This was the sign of the Iron Bridge Town Gate reaching perfection. Bones like fine steel, spine like an iron bridge.

"Form the formation!"

The cavalry commander who saw this scene roared sharply. He spun his eighteen-foot snake spear and charged to kill. These elite soldiers of the incense cult reacted extremely fast. Thirty hook-bladed spears interlocked to form a net, the toxic blue light on the spearheads connecting into a screen of light.

But Xu Yunfan charged straight into the spear formation.

The sound of metal clashing exploded. The hook-bladed spears刺 on his chest actually sparked.

The cavalrymen's hands split from the recoil. Before they could change their moves, the War Drum Golden Hammer had already stirred up a blood-red whirlwind.

Wherever the hammer head passed, both men and horses were shattered.

A headless corpse was swept up by the hammer wind and smashed a yellow earth stone not far away.

A gust of wind surged in his mind. Xu Yunfan lowered his head, and the sweeping snake spear in the cavalry commander's hand immediately missed.

In the twilight, the cavalry commander reined in his horse and stood.

He was clad in heavy玄 iron armor, with only a pair of eyes glowing with a dim light visible beneath his face mask. The eighteen-foot snake spear in his hand pointed diagonally at the ground, the blood dripping from the tip blooming like red plums on the yellow earth.

Xu Yunfan held the hammer in one hand. As the blood energy surged around him, the muscles beneath his skin writhed like pythons, and his bones emitted a faint hum, as if countless metals were colliding inside his body.

"The Bright Lord is above!"

The cavalry commander suddenly roared. The eighteen-foot snake spear shot out like a venomous dragon leaving its cave, the spear tip trembling to produce nine flower-like attacks.

This move, "Nine Dragons Probing the Sea," had reached perfection. Nine寒 lights sealed all of Xu Yunfan's retreat paths.

But Xu Yunfan didn't move a muscle. Only when the spear tip was less than three inches from his throat did he slightly turn his body.

The snake spear brushed past his neck, the potent poison on the spear shaft leaving a black mark on his skin, but it failed to break the skin.

The cavalry commander's pupils constricted.

His spear was enough to pierce through three layers of heavy armor, yet it couldn't even pierce the other party's skin!

"Body tempering? A Three-Refined Warrior?!"

Xu Yunfan's right hand gently swung the War Drum Golden Hammer.

This seemingly casual move brought about a whistling gale. The hammer head struck the spear shaft. The eighteen-foot snake spear, forged of fine steel, shattered inch by inch like a dry branch.

"Bang!"

The cavalry commander was shaken back three zhang along with his horse. The war horse's hooves plowed deep trenches in the ground. His hands split, blood flowing through the gaps in his iron armor. The look in his eyes beneath the face mask finally revealed terror.

Xu Yunfan stepped forward, leaving inch-deep footprints in the ground with every step. The blood energy in his body churned more and more violently, giving him a feeling that he had to vent it.

The cavalry commander suddenly tore off his face mask, revealing a face covered in tattoos.

He fumbled in his chest and pulled out a scarlet pill, threw it into his mouth, and crushed it, swallowing it down.

"The Bright Lord grants me divine strength!"

He roared, his muscles swelling all over, making the heavy armor creak and groan. Dense red patterns appeared under his skin, as if countless worms were swimming in his blood vessels.

A cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. He saw that these patterns were identical to the flesh buds parasitizing the boy's body. They were clearly the methods of the incense cult.
