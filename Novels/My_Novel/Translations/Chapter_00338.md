Chapter 338: The Heart of Solitude, Li Xian Turns the Tables, Madam Loses Her Composure

Du Guyuan was renowned throughout the world for the "Heart of Solitude Art." This technique is deeply connected to the "Heart's Intent." If the Heart's Intent is damaged, one's life force will wither. He possessed three great treasures in his life: first, the Jade Seal of the You Kingdom; second, the Heart of Solitude Art; and third, the Totem of the You Kingdom.

Pushing open the stone door of the secret chamber, it was pitch black inside. Li Xian blew out a fire striker and lit all the oil lamps in the room. The candlelight illuminated the space, instantly brightening it.

The three treasures were all here. Wen Caishang said, "Li Lang, if I am not mistaken, this is the 'You Palace.' The You Kingdom had a strange system: one dynasty, two emperors. One was the 'Bright Monarch,' and the other the 'You Monarch.' The Bright Monarch appeared before the world, enjoying wealth but possessing no real power. The You Monarch hid in secret chambers, wielding great power while remaining hidden. Du Guyuan's tomb must follow this structure."

"The treasures he collected throughout his life should be inside the You Palace! Others neither know Du Guyuan's origin nor the strange system of the 'You Kingdom,' passing by great treasures without realizing it. They lack the fortune and slightly lack the luck."

Li Xian smiled. "It is truly my great fortune to have you, Madam." He looked at Wen Caishang, whose demeanor was elegant, dignified, and composed, gentle and appropriate. She was like his wife and his teacher, always superior to him. When they relied on each other in love, they were like a divine couple, with infinite joy. But when she threw a tantrum, she was incredibly difficult to handle. It was complex and entangled, hard to describe clearly. She was currently restrained everywhere, so he should seize the opportunity to bully her. However, he thought that once they left the main hall, she would still be extremely powerful. If she took revenge, he would surely suffer.

In the secret chamber sat a meditation mat, upon which sat a dried corpse facing a red wall, as if meditating. This corpse was "Du Guyuan." In front of him lay a Jade Seal, symbolizing the power of a nation. On the red wall hung a scroll depicting a golden-tailed red-furred rat. This was the Totem of the You Kingdom.

Suddenly, there was a soft "thump." The corpse's chest bulged slightly. Li Xian said sternly, "Madam, be careful," and shielded her behind him. Wen Caishang smiled sweetly, as if drinking honey or bathing in sweet dew, yet she chided, "Du Guyuan in his prime was no match for me. Now that he has been dead for so long, why should I be afraid of him?" With a sweep of her sleeve, she brushed the chest away.

A shriveled heart slid out, still beating faintly. The Heart of Solitude Art was indeed extraordinary. Although Du Guyuan was dead and his consciousness vanished, his heart continued to beat for thousands of years. Wen Caishang said, "The secrets of the Heart of Solitude Art are hidden within. If you can comprehend it, it is your opportunity. If you cannot, you will miss it. The opportunity is here; grasp it yourself."

The Heart of Solitude Art was a peerless technique of the current era. It focused on "tempering the heart." Although it was a martial art, it had no forms. Furthermore, there were no written records, no bamboo slips or tablets for inheritance. One had to cast aside preconceptions and listen to the heart's intent to pass it on.

Thus, it was called the "Heart of Solitude Art," emphasizing the words "solitude" and "unique." There would never be two people in the world who could master this art simultaneously. The dried heart contained a trace of "intent," rumored to be a strange rhythm of the heavens and earth that was accidentally absorbed into the heart cavity, gradually evolving into this "Heart of Solitude Art." This intent was difficult to dissipate over time, causing the heart to beat.

That was why, after thousands of years, the body had decayed, but the heart still beat on.

Li Xian held the dried heart and felt a shock in his own heart. He brought it to his ear to listen. Each beat of the heart felt incredibly strange. Pondering it carefully, the rhythm was long and profound, sometimes like the sudden roar of thunder and drums, sometimes like a haunting flute sound... He became intoxicated, slowly experiencing it. His own heart cavity resonated with the sound, gradually beginning to contain this rhythm.

The Heart of Solitude Art focused on training the "Heart's Intent," which was extremely peculiar. Practicing it allowed one to transmit thoughts via the heart,震 heart to strengthen Qi,灌注 intent into external objects, dissolve others' martial dao, and enhance comprehension... There were many miraculous effects. It required calm cultivation and daily exploration to live up to its reputation.

A layer of "intent" gradually formed in Li Xian's heart cavity, echoing within. He knew this was an excellent opportunity to comprehend the Heart of Solitude Art. If he missed it, this special technique would vanish. He sat cross-legged, focusing his intent, transforming it into a large hand that snatched the lingering intent from the dried heart into his own heart cavity.

Although he had suffered much bad luck and many obstacles, there were times when he was lucky. The Heart of Solitude Art suited him perfectly. He practiced "Archery," and his will was already sharp, which secretly aligned with the Heart of Solitude Art. Furthermore, he practiced the "Five Organs Avoiding Turbidness and Gathering Yang Meridians," which also had no forms but strengthened his organs, body, and spirit, and his heart was rich in blood and Qi.

Wen Caishang saw Li Xian enter a meditative state and smiled faintly. "Silly boy, he really doesn't guard against me." She closed the secret chamber door. She picked up the "Jade Seal" from the ground. The seal was smooth and warm, carved with nine jade dragons, lifelike and extremely exquisite.

Wen Caishang pondered, "As for opportunities, although the Heart of Solitude Art is a peerless technique with many rare and wondrous effects, it is not as powerful as my Silkworm Garment Misleading Jade Art. It specializes in the Heart's Intent, and to see results, it truly requires three to five years of bitter work, or even decades. Giving this technique to Li Xian..."

"With his exceptional comprehension, if possible, I really don't want him to learn this martial art. But I always have to send him away. This young man risked his life to save me; I... I must give him benefits. To me, the Heart of Solitude Art is of little use, but this Jade Seal is of the utmost importance."

Her slender hand flipped, and the Jade Seal stood still in her palm. She took out a white jade bottle with her left hand and pulled out the stopper, revealing golden jade dew inside. She looked around and saw a lamp stand.

She flattened the top of the lamp stand, placed the Jade Seal on it, and poured the "Golden Jade Dew" around it. She waited for a long time but heard no movement. She frowned slightly. After thinking for a moment, she understood the reason. With a flip of her sleeve, a white snake soft sword lay in her hand.

The "Void芥魔衣" was incredibly mysterious and unpredictable, hiding things in the void and distorting their properties. Wen Caishang wrapped the "White Snake Sword" in the Void芥魔衣, allowing it to extend, lengthen, become softer, and grow lighter... She flicked it toward a distant candle, and the White Snake Sword wound its way out, its tip hitting the wick perfectly.

It actually cut off a strand of flame. The candle dimmed for a moment before burning again. Wen Caishang stood still, not even looking back as she flicked the sword behind her. The White Snake Sword, holding a strand of flame, stabbed toward the candle behind her. Like a white snake opening its mouth to hunt for fire, the flame on the tip grew slightly larger.

She flicked it seven or eight times, cutting a strand of flame from each of the surrounding candles. She then reversed the blade and retracted the White Snake Sword. The tip of the sword was bright with flame, burning slowly. She placed the flame under the Jade Seal.

She waited quietly for a moment, and the Jade Seal showed signs of change. It began to vibrate slightly, and then a green light crawled along a dragon carving, starting from the tail and gradually moving toward the head. The Jade Seal had nine dragons, symbolizing "Supreme Sovereign of the Nine Dragons." Of the nine dragon carvings, eight glowed with green light, while one remained dim.

The green light extended at varying speeds. The fastest had already reached the dragon's belly, while the slowest had just crawled past the tail. Wen Caishang was in no hurry. She glanced at Li Xian and saw him immersed in the martial dao, oblivious to the outside world; he would need time to comprehend. It might take a day or two of sitting in meditation, so she could wait more leisurely.

About two hours later, the fastest green light had reached the "dragon's neck." The slowest had also reached the "dragon's belly." The flame burned slowly. After another hour, the first green light climbed to the dragon's head and crawled out of its mouth. It turned out to be a green worm.

The worm was the length and thickness of a finger joint, crawling slowly, its body glowing with green light. After crawling out of the Jade Seal, it headed toward the Golden Jade Dew. Wen Caishang thought, "The rumors are true! It was not in vain that I entered the tomb to search for it and went through all the waiting. Although my luck was poor and I lost the dragon's fortune, after surviving the danger, there is always a reward." She was overjoyed. She held two fingers together, and soon, a white silkworm crawled out from her sleeve.

It crawled along her fingers to the lamp stand and pounced on the green worm. The green worm turned to flee, but its speed was far inferior; it was devoured on the spot by the ancestral silkworm. Wen Caishang pinched it with two fingers and put the ancestral silkworm back into her sleeve.

She waited quietly again. The second, third, and fourth green worms... all met the same fate, crawling out of the Jade Seal and being devoured by the ancestral silkworm. After nearly a day, the ancestral silkworm had devoured six green worms.

It turned out...

This Jade Seal was called the "Nine Dragon Seal," passed down through generations of the You Kingdom. It contained "Jade Dragons," a type of worm that was extremely rare. Legend had it that they possessed boundless lifespan and astonishing healing effects; even at the brink of death, one could recover using them. The Jade Dragons slept for long periods, waking up during intense heat and loving the scent of "Jade Dew."

Wen Caishang had once burned incense at a temple, causing "Golden Rain and Jade Dew" to fall from the sky. She took the opportunity to collect it in her white jade bottle, not expecting it to be used here. Even without the "Golden Rain and Jade Dew," she had other ways to force the Jade Dragons out of the Jade Seal.

The ancestral silkworm devouring the Jade Dragons caused its bloodline, quality, toxicity, and miraculous effects to rise several levels. This harvest was quite substantial. When she establishes a new estate in the future and uses the ancestral silkworm to breed silkworms, the texture and effectiveness of the silk will surely be better.

Wen Caishang pondered, "The ancestral silkworm devouring six Jade Dragons is a great opportunity, but a great tonic is also a great poison; it needs to digest and transform properly. For the coming days, it will not be needed. There are still two living Jade Dragons and one dead Jade Dragon in the Jade Seal. It cannot be awakened by fire, presumably because it has died for some reason."

She looked at Li Xian for a moment and sighed softly, murmuring to herself, "When have I ever willingly given away benefits?偏偏 it is you, boy, making me love and hate you beyond my control. Fine, fine. These two living Jade Dragons, I will hide them in your back. At a critical moment, they can save your life."

After the remaining two Jade Dragons crawled out of the Jade Seal, she pinched them with two fingers and tapped Li Xian's back. The Jade Dragons merged into his body, clinging to his spine. Li Xian had tempered his spine to be like a divine mountain. The Jade Dragons, attached to this divine mountain, with their unique nature, gradually fell into a deep sleep.

This action was very light. Li Xian was comprehending the "Heart of Solitude Art" and did not realize he had been given such a great opportunity. Wen Caishang looked at him with a complex gaze. "It seems I truly love him to death. He is comprehending a martial art, unaware of the outside world. I could have swallowed this treasure alone, and he would have found it hard to detect. He is smart and cautious, but his knowledge is slightly shallow, and he would not know of the existence of such a strange thing as the Jade Dragons."

"Wen Caishang, Wen Caishang, isn't it good to keep it on your body to preserve your own life? Why... why do you think of giving it to him? Even if you give it to him, you clearly have two Jade Dragons; you could just give one and keep one for yourself, wouldn't that be better? Why did you... give them all to him?"

Wen Caishang sighed helplessly. "This matter... I still won't tell him. I give him the Jade Dragons, only wishing for his life to be safe. If he knows where the Jade Dragons are, with his reckless and wild nature, he will inevitably become even more daring. I only hope he never has to use the Jade Dragons."

She did not feel any regret. She was inherently selfish and profit-oriented. She could talk gently while carving out someone's flesh and bones. She was like this in business and in the martial dao. If she could take ten percent of the profit, she would find a way to take twelve percent. Yet now, she went against her nature. The value of the Jade Dragons was immeasurable, yet she silently gave them away.

On the red wall hung the totem. The value of this item lay more in its collection than its practical use. While waiting for Li Xian to comprehend, Wen Caishang observed the totem, studying its meaning. Suddenly, she felt something: "A thousand people, a thousand faces; each is different. The treasures Du Guyuan valued, in my eyes, are just so-so. This totem is not low in value, but it has nothing special. Compared to the Heart of Solitude Art, the Nine Dragon Jade Seal, and the Jade Dragon longevity worm... it is rather ordinary. It was just taken along the way. But for Du Guyuan, martial arts, jade seals, wealth...恐怕 all were not as important as this totem. Before he died, he passed away while looking at this totem."

Wen Caishang rolled up the totem and put it away. She walked slowly around Li Lang, thinking: "Li Lang has unparalleled talent. I have read many history books and dare not say my knowledge is profound, but my insight is decent. A body with two phases... although rare, throughout ancient and modern times, such figures have appeared. But having both the Heavy Pupil Phase and the Perfect Phase at the same time, I have truly only heard of Li Xian. There was none in ancient times, and there will be none in the future."

"I just observed his spear technique. When he施展 it, there is an invisible pull. Presumably, before stepping into the second realm of martial arts, he wore the Turbid Garment characteristic and awakened the 'Pure Yang Qi Garment.' Although this garment is not as good as the 'Void芥魔衣,' it is more overbearing and simple. With various characteristics and martial arts combined, at such a young age, he has truly made some progress."

She couldn't help but smile, feeling very satisfied. She thought again: "This young master was cultivated by me personally. Seeing him suppress the Five Mountain Sword Alliance, it gave me a great sense of achievement. Only that 'spear technique' was not from my hand, making it less than perfect. In the future, I will have him stop practicing the spear and only practice the sword, using my moves."

"But his sleeve spear is quite similar to my White Snake Sword. Presumably, it was also inspired by me. Fine, fine, for this sake, I will allow him to learn the spear. But in the future, he must prioritize the martial arts I teach."

Wen Caishang saw that Li Xian's handling of affairs, knowledge, and martial arts all bore her traces. She was both happy and gratified, wishing to leave her mark everywhere. Suddenly, she thought of something and couldn't help frowning: "This boy cannot be underestimated. I am afraid I am no match for him now. If he tries to escape, I will have difficulty keeping him." She already had a plan in mind.

She waited another two hours. Li Xian let out a long breath of turbid air, and a sharp light flashed in his eyes.

[Heart of Solitude Art]
[Proficiency: 2/1000 Beginner]

[Description: The heart of solitude, the solitude of supremacy. If one obtains an invincible will, why envy the strengths of others? Tempering the heart and forging the will begins here.]

Listening to the heart's sound, he finally obtained the peerless technique. The dried heart gradually shriveled and rotted, turning into a puddle of rotten flesh. Li Xian absorbed the intent into his heart cavity, thinking: "This technique needs to be practiced further to reveal its miraculous effects. I have only just entered the gate; it can only help me focus my intent. It helps with concentration, but there are no other effects."

The Heart of Solitude Art and the [Five Organs Avoiding Turbidness and Gathering Yang Meridians] are both internal martial arts. They have different focuses, but both are profound and extensive. The Heart of Solitude Art is more strange and arrogant, while the Five Organs Avoiding Turbidness and Gathering Yang Meridians is the "Pure Yang Outline," more comprehensive and moderate.

Li Xian had faced many obstacles recently, and this moment of quiet was rare. He practiced the "Heart of Solitude Art" for a while, then internally practiced the "Five Organs Avoiding Turbidness and Gathering Yang Meridians."

Li Xian opened his eyes and adjusted his breath. Seeing Wen Caishang sitting quietly beside him waiting, he said apologetically, "Madam, I have kept you waiting!"

Wen Caishang smiled. "It's fine. Did you gain anything, Li Lang?" Li Xian said, "The Heart of Solitude Art is truly profound. Other martial arts are recorded in books and scrolls. This martial art actually requires one to剖开 the heart and listen to it to obtain."

Wen Caishang said, "That is why it is called the Heart of Solitude. There are countless strange martial arts in this world. I have seen even stranger ones. Although the Heart of Solitude Art is strange, it is not worth making a fuss over. But this technique is passed down in a single line, rarely heard of, with few records. I only vaguely knew of its existence but did not know its true capabilities."

Li Xian said, "I do not know either. I have only just entered the gate." Wen Caishang said, "With your talent, you truly have gained something. Since you can enter the gate, you can research it further. This technique on Du Guyuan may not have displayed its true capabilities. But with you, it might bring a fresh perspective."

Li Xian smiled modestly. "You overestimate me, Madam." Wen Caishang said, "I think... it is as I expected. The bell sound here comes from this 'Heart of Solitude Art.' This martial art is peculiar. For thousands of years... the Nine-窍 Dragon Heart Acupoint here has 'learned' this technique first. And has evolved to a very high level."

Li Xian thought: "Although I saved the Madam, I... I cannot stay by her side for long. I need to become strong and self-reliant. Only when I can match her in the future can I talk about other things. For now... I need to plan my retreat in advance." He said, "Madam is wise. This place is strange, but how can we eliminate it?"

Wen Caishang said, "It is very difficult to eliminate. The Nine-窍 Dragon Heart Acupoint has started, like a person's heart beating. From slow to fast, the bell sound at the beginning was like a great bell ringing, to now vibrating faintly. It is like a normal heartbeat, the sound continuous, beating constantly, but the ear can no longer hear it."

"If I am not mistaken, the entire Nine-窍 Dragon Heart Acupoint is filled with this bell sound. It may even transmit through the窍孔, affecting the entire Flying Dragon City!"

Li Xian was shocked. "Really?" Wen Caishang said, "But there is no need to worry. This Nine-窍 Dragon Heart Acupoint is not a human heart. It is beating constantly now because it was stimulated. It will last for a period, perhaps half a month or several months, and will naturally gradually stop and return to its original state."

Li Xian thought: "If what Madam says is true, the bell sound affecting Flying Dragon City is actually a good thing for me." He felt slightly relieved. Wen Caishang thought: "That bell sound is strange, but its influence is limited to the cave. If I didn't exaggerate, how could you, boy, relax?"

Li Xian bowed several times to Du Guyuan, exited the secret chamber, and closed the stone door. Wen Caishang smiled. "It must be chaotic outside now. Even the Five Mountain Sword Alliance is not so foolish; they should have figured out the situation. Li Lang, the greatest benefits of the main hall, we have both taken. But there are other benefits that we must take one by one. No matter how chaotic it is outside, it will not disturb us."

Li Xian smiled. "That would be best." Wen Caishang said casually, "But if you are concerned about those few ladies, we can go and help."

Li Xian knew Wen Caishang was extremely jealous. Thinking of Zhao Chunxia, Lin Aoshan... and others, he thought that the Five Mountain Sword Alliance was united and now knew the true identity of the enemy. They would not suffer repeated defeats, so there was no need to worry. He said, "Madam is joking. There is only you in my heart."

As they walked, they arrived at the "Misty Clear Pool" behind the palace. Du Guyuan had several lovers in his life. Some died early and were buried in the tomb in advance. Others, with whom he had a meeting of hearts, voluntarily accompanied him in death.

After Du Guyuan moved into the tomb, the entire underground palace maintained a semblance of life. Morning court, garden strolls, sleeping with concubines... until he was about to die, it gradually returned to silence. A long dream returning to dust, making one sigh.

The Misty Clear Pool was where Du Guyuan bathed and played with his concubines. At the time, he was dying, but the medicinal herbs he had collected throughout his life had nowhere to be used, and selling them was troublesome. So he found a way to turn them into bath medicine. He bathed in it with his concubines, seeking pleasure.

The medicinal soup was extremely luxurious. Li Xian and Wen Caishang arrived here and saw that the pool, built of jade, actually emitted a strong medicinal fragrance. It contained a light purple medicinal soup, with misty vapor on the surface, like a blanket of smoke.

Wen Caishang was surprised. "This medicinal soup has been separated for thousands of years, yet its efficacy has not diminished; it has actually increased?" Li Xian said, "There is such a strange thing?"

Wen Caishang said, "Presumably, this medicine was too extravagant, its potency so strong that they restrained and pulled on each other, preventing it from dissipating for a long time. Combined with the stone heart being closed, no ventilation, no water flow, thousands of years like a day, it naturally did not dissipate or rot for a long time. And... it secretly fits the principles of alchemy. The entire tomb can be seen as a formation, and the medicinal soup can be seen as being stewed for thousands of years; its efficacy naturally increases without decreasing!"

Li Xian said, "So that's how it is!"

It turned out that Du Guyuan died suddenly. After his death, the medicinal soup was left in the bath pool, and no one had time to care for it. It remained until now. Wen Caishang was very tempted and said, "Li Lang, are you going to miss such an opportunity?"

Li Xian said, "Of course not. Madam, are we going to..." Wen Caishang gently stroked Li Xian's face and smiled. "Naturally. There is no one to disturb us here, just you and me. Why not enjoy ourselves?"

This bath soup was called "Mandarin Duck Purple Smoke Soup." It contained five hundred and ninety-seven rare and precious herbs. Its potency was strong; it could strengthen the physique, heal old injuries, nourish the skin, and preserve beauty. Its main effect, however, was to enhance one's interest and explore infinite pleasure.

As soon as he entered the soup, he felt the water was warm, and the medicinal efficacy entered his body gently. The effect was very strong. After swimming for a short while, he gradually felt his Qi becoming dry. The mist inside was hazy. Wen Caishang saw Li Xian swimming through the mist and smiled. Her cheeks were flushed, and she swam toward him of her own accord.

Li Xian said, "This medicinal soup is truly神奇. Its effect is very strong. Madam... to be safe, although there is no danger here, it is not good to stay in the soup for too long." Wen Caishang said, "Are you scared?"

Li Xian said, "Not really. It's just..." Wen Caishang said softly, "You are lying again. Can't I tell? Are you very afraid of me?"

Li Xian said, "Madam treats me with great kindness. It is not fear, but respect." Wen Caishang said, "It is clearly fear. You cannot fool me. I used to want you to fear and dread me. But now... I don't think that way anymore."

"You have always remembered the matter of gouging out my eyes. Although I forced you to do it before, it was a momentary folly. From now on, I will not make you gouge out your eyes. You should let down your guard, Li Lang."

Li Xian did not know if Wen Caishang's words were true or false, but he thought: "Madam cannot do anything to me now. Why should I be so cautious?" He pretended to sigh and said, "Madam, even if you don't gouge out my eyes, I am still afraid of you."

Wen Caishang heard the hidden meaning in his words and said, "Oh?" Li Xian said, "Madam always bullies me and stabs me with your sword at the drop of a hat."

Wen Caishang chided, "Do you want to stab me back?" Li Xian said, "I could never bear to hurt you. But... I want to bully you back to vent my anger. If I do that, I probably won't be so afraid of you anymore."

Wen Caishang immediately swam away, letting out a soft "humph." "You have some nerve! Taking advantage of the situation. I, Wen Caishang, have never been bullied. Get lost quickly. I don't need you to accompany me."

She was about to swim away to avoid this disaster, but her ankle was grabbed. She knew it was Li Xian's doing. She was both agitated and annoyed, both expectant and feeling her face was at a loss. What she said about "gouging out the eyes" was just to stabilize Li Xian. When had she ever kept her promises? She could say anything nice now and easily go back on her word later. She did not expect it to stir up Li Xian's courage, and he actually wanted to讨回 everything.

Her pretty face was both red and white, and she secretly groaned. At this moment, she truly could not defeat Li Xian.
