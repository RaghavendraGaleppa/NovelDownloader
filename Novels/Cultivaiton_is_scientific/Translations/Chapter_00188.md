# Chapter 188: Cooperation

The three early-stage Foundation Building cultivators from the Senluo Sect, along with the mid-stage Foundation Building cultivator who was about to arrive, never expected another cultivator to be nearby—one who would rescue Xu Chuan.

They immediately gave chase, but the sword light carrying Xu Chuan was far faster than their own speed. The mid-stage Foundation Building cultivator had no choice but to stop, realizing the futility of pursuit. The speed gap, combined with the fleeing party's advantage in choosing their direction, only widened the distance between them.

"Did anyone see the cultivator's appearance?" the mid-stage Foundation Building cultivator asked the others.

"No, that cultivator wore a hat that concealed their face—even spiritual sense couldn't penetrate it," one of them replied, shaking his head.

Meanwhile, Li Shiming let out a long sigh of relief. Rescuing Xu Chuan had indeed been a risky move. 

Saving someone from three early-stage and one mid-stage Foundation Building cultivators was an extremely difficult task. Fortunately, the mid-stage cultivator hadn't arrived at the scene yet, and the three early-stage cultivators had given Xu Chuan enough space to create an opening.

The current situation between him and Xu Chuan was rather peculiar—they stood on opposite sides of the sword light. This was intentional on Li Shiming's part. He didn't want Xu Chuan to suddenly attack him during their sword flight. At the same time, this arrangement also gave Xu Chuan a sense of security.

After flying several hundred li with no pursuers in sight, Li Shiming finally stopped.

"Fellow Daoist Xu, how's the poison in your body?" he asked, noticing the dark aura on Xu Chuan's face. He didn't want to go through the trouble of rescuing someone only for them to die from poisoning—that would render his entire plan pointless.

"This poison isn't a major issue. I can neutralize it once I find a safe place," Xu Chuan replied, studying Li Shiming. He tried to get a better look at his rescuer, but the hat obscured Li Shiming's face.

Noticing Xu Chuan's gaze, Li Shiming didn't hesitate to remove the hat. 

This simple action eased some of Xu Chuan's suspicions. Combined with Li Shiming's strikingly youthful appearance, it increased his trust in the young man slightly.

With a wave of his hand, Li Shiming sent nine sword lights to the ground, forming a concealment and isolation array in an instant.

"Fellow Daoist Xu, you can rest inside this array," he said, gesturing toward the formation.

Xu Chuan nodded and stepped inside, sitting cross-legged before taking out a pill to begin expelling the poison.

Li Shiming also sat within the array, though he kept a respectful distance from Xu Chuan to show his sincerity.

Under the combined effects of Xu Chuan's spiritual energy and the antidote pill, the dark aura on his face gradually faded.

---

The poison used by demonic cultivators was rarely incurable. Its purpose was usually to weaken a cultivator's combat ability while preventing them from expelling the toxins due to constant harassment. This allowed the poison to grow increasingly potent over time.

Given Xu Chuan's background, the quality of his antidote pills was naturally high. Combined with his advanced cultivation technique, the effects against the poison were remarkable.

After an hour, Xu Chuan opened his eyes with a pleased expression, looking at Li Shiming with newfound warmth. 

He didn't know why Li Shiming had saved him, but by now, he was certain the young man meant no harm.

"May I ask who you are, Fellow Daoist? Please tell me so I may repay this life-saving grace in the future," Xu Chuan asked earnestly, clasping his hands in salute.

"My name is Li Shiming. You could say I'm a rogue cultivator. There's no need to speak of repayment—I only acted because I have a request of my own," Li Shiming replied after a moment's hesitation.

Xu Chuan's expression turned surprised when Li Shiming called himself a rogue cultivator.

Having been so close to the sword light, Xu Chuan had clearly sensed the sword intent within it. 

It was precisely this sword intent that allowed the sword flight—even while carrying both of them—to outpace the Senluo Sect's Foundation Building cultivators.

While sword intent wasn't exclusive to sword cultivators, obtaining it was notoriously difficult, forming the greatest barrier to entering the path of sword cultivation.

Beyond sword intent, Li Shiming had also simultaneously controlled nine flying sword artifacts. This indicated two things: first, his spiritual power was extraordinarily strong to manipulate nine swords at once, and second, he must have trained in a soul-splitting secret technique—otherwise, controlling nine swords would be impossible.

Moreover, when the nine sword artifacts landed, they instantly formed an array. This level of array manipulation told Xu Chuan that Li Shiming was undoubtedly a high-level array master.

Most telling was the wealth required—nine flying sword artifacts alone were beyond what any ordinary rogue cultivator could possess.

"Fellow Daoist Li, you don't seem like a rogue cultivator at all. Whatever you need, if it's within my power, I won't refuse," Xu Chuan said with a smile, gesturing at the array. Now that the poison was neutralized, he felt much more at ease.

"I was originally a disciple of the Tianhai Sect on Tianhai Island. After the sect was invaded by the Mingxin Sect of Northern Shu, I obtained an entry qualification for the Thousand Illusions Sect. That's why I came to the Hundred Thousand Mountains, hoping to reach the Thousand Illusions Sect. But with the current chaos here, I have no idea how to leave. I was hoping Fellow Daoist Xu could take me with you," Li Shiming explained honestly, withholding nothing.

He saw no need for deception—Xu Chuan's status was special, and he didn't want to jeopardize their newly formed friendship with lies.

---

"Leaving the Hundred Thousand Mountains isn't a problem. I can agree to that. Though the exits are blocked by the Senluo Sect, my sect has a way through. However, I came here on a mission, so it may take some time," Xu Chuan replied after a moment's consideration.

"As long as we can leave, waiting isn't an issue," Li Shiming said with a smile.

He had already considered that the Senluo Sect would have measures in place at the borders of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, though he hadn't expected a full blockade—the resources required for that were staggering. But given the Senluo Sect's current influence, it wasn't impossible.

He had already spent so much time here; waiting a little longer wasn't a big deal. Traveling with Xu Chuan would be far safer than trying to find his own way out. After all, if Xu Chuan couldn't leave, why would he have entered in the first place?

"Fellow Daoist Li, do you have the Thousand Illusions Sect's entry token?" Xu Chuan asked after a slight hesitation.

His mission was critically important. If Li Shiming was to accompany him, he needed to verify the young man's claims. Though Li Shiming had saved him and should be trustworthy, the mission's importance demanded absolute certainty.

"Here it is," Li Shiming replied without hesitation, producing the jade token from the Thousand Illusions Sect.

Xu Chuan scanned it with his spiritual sense and confirmed its authenticity.

"Please don't take offense, Fellow Daoist Li. I'll make it up to you after we leave the Hundred Thousand Mountains," Xu Chuan said with an apologetic bow.

"No need for that. If your mission makes it difficult to bring me along, I can wait somewhere until you're ready to leave," Li Shiming replied understandingly, waving his hand.

"Actually, I was hoping for your assistance. Are you a high-level array master?" Now that Xu Chuan had verified Li Shiming's identity, his trust had risen to a reliable level. He wasn't about to let such a capable helper go to waste.

"I never took the examination in the Tianhai Sect," Li Shiming replied evasively, though his answer practically confirmed his high-level array mastery.

"Fellow Daoist Li, the Thousand Illusions Sect entry token you showed is for an ordinary outer disciple. Even with it, you'd only be an outer disciple with far fewer resources and techniques compared to an inner disciple. If you help me complete my mission, I can arrange for you to become an inner disciple of the Shu Mountain Sect," Xu Chuan proposed seriously.

---

Seeing Li Shiming's abilities, Xu Chuan wanted to recruit him—not just for the mission, but as a long-term asset for his sect.

Li Shiming hadn't expected this offer. His time in the Hundred Thousand Mountains had given him some basic knowledge of the major sects in Northern Shu.

The Shu Mountain Sect was one of the top sects in the region, a pure orthodox Daoist sect with good relations among other righteous factions.

Though he had made plans with Yin Shilan, joining the Thousand Illusions Sect wasn't set in stone—staying within righteous sects would make communication easy. 

Moreover, he could tell that Yin Shilan's master, Grandmaster Luo, didn't think highly of him. Joining the Thousand Illusions Sect wouldn't earn him any protection there.

"You don't need to decide now. We can discuss it after leaving the Hundred Thousand Mountains," Xu Chuan said with a smile, seeing Li Shiming's hesitation. As long as the young man considered the Shu Mountain Sect, he would give his all during the mission—exactly what Xu Chuan needed.

With time to think, Li Shiming wasn't in a rush to decide.

"I came to the Hundred Thousand Mountains for a Three-Leaf Sun Grass," Xu Chuan revealed his mission.

Had Li Shiming not read the Six-Fingered Tone Demon's collection, he might not have recognized the herb. But knowing what it was, his face showed surprise.

"It seems you're familiar with Three-Leaf Sun Grass. My master once saw an immature specimen during his travels here and recorded its location," Xu Chuan continued, surprised that Li Shiming recognized it.

Three-Leaf Sun Grass was a third-grade spirit herb—something far beyond the reach of ordinary Foundation Building cultivators. Legend said such herbs were guarded by spirit beasts, and those capable of protecting a third-grade herb would at least be at late Foundation Building level, if not Golden Core.

"Fellow Daoist Xu, with just the two of us, obtaining a third-grade spirit herb seems nearly impossible," Li Shiming pointed out.

"I must obtain the Three-Leaf Sun Grass. That's why I need your help. I wasn't entirely confident before, but with you, our chances have improved," Xu Chuan said firmly.

"If the herb is so important, surely the Shu Mountain Sect has Golden Core elders who could easily retrieve it?" Li Shiming asked curiously.

"The Senluo Sect is unifying the Hundred Thousand Mountains and has warned all sects against sending Golden Core cultivators here. If our sect's Golden Cores entered now, it would provoke a conflict," Xu Chuan explained.

---

Li Shiming wasn't entirely convinced. A Golden Core cultivator moving discreetly, avoiding major arrays, could easily go unnoticed—how would that cause conflict? But he didn't press further. There were clearly factors he didn't understand.

Xu Chuan was equally frustrated. He could trust Li Shiming but not his own sect's members—an ironic but undeniable truth.

Take his recent ambush by Senluo Sect cultivators—his movements were supposed to be secret, known only to a select few. Yet the enemy had lain in wait precisely along his route, even setting up traps in advance. The idea that it was a coincidence was laughable.

Someone had betrayed him, exposing his location to allow the ambush. Without Li Shiming's intervention, he would have either died or been left severely injured, unable to complete his mission—exactly what certain individuals wanted.

"Fellow Daoist Li, if you help me obtain the Three-Leaf Sun Grass, I can have my master take you on as a nominal disciple, effectively making you a half-hereditary disciple of the sect," Xu Chuan added, sweetening the deal.

Li Shiming's mind raced. He now suspected the herb was tied to someone's life—likely to counteract a Golden Core-level Yin poison, given the Three-Leaf Sun Grass's extreme Yang properties. Refined into a pill, its effects would be even stronger.

Truthfully, he was tempted. Half-hereditary disciple status was an enormous incentive.

His spiritual root talent was relatively poor, which was why no Golden Core elder in the Tianhai Sect had offered to take him as a disciple. His standing there had relied entirely on his array mastery and connection to Yin Shilan.

"Very well, Fellow Daoist Xu. Since you put it that way, I'll do my utmost," Li Shiming agreed solemnly.

Xu Chuan smiled. Though he had trump cards to deal with spirit beasts, who knew what other dangers lay ahead? Having a trustworthy companion—and a capable one at that—gave him much-needed hope for this perilous mission.

Over the next few days, Xu Chuan led the way as they flew toward a specific region of the Hundred Thousand Mountains.

Though Li Shiming didn't ask their destination, he could tell from their direction that it was a marked danger zone—territory controlled by spirit beasts, not the Senluo Sect.

Additionally, during this time, he checked the mission targeting Xu Chuan through Li Yuanba's identity jade slip. 

The description had changed from targeting Xu Chuan alone to targeting him and another cultivator of similar strength. The mission level had been raised to tier three, indicating increased difficulty.
