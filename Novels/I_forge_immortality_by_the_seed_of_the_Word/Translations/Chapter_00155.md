# Chapter 152: Hastening the Growth of the Three Radiance Immortal Peach Tree (Combined)

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened as he carefully examined the thirty-four stars shimmering with different lights before him. He had already mastered the perfected Dao Intentions of both Taiyin and Taiyang. The remaining thirty-four Dao Intentions he needed to comprehend were all laid out before him now.

The choice was proving difficult.

After a moment's contemplation, Zhang Jing decisively closed his eyes, withdrew his spiritual sense, and let intuition guide him. It didn't matter much—he would have to comprehend all these Dao Intentions eventually; it was merely a matter of sequence.

With a wave of his hand, most of the stars dissipated, leaving only four behind.

After what seemed like an eternity, a soft sigh escaped his lips.

"Ah... the Dao Intentions of the Scorching Vermilion Bird, the Profound Water Whale, the Thousand Mountains Turtle, and the Swift Wind Beast. Without realizing it, I've still chosen these four in the end?" Zhang Jing's heart was filled with complex emotions. He still couldn't forget the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability he had seen earlier.

And rightly so.

In Zhang Jing's heart, he had always believed that the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability was far more suitable for him than the Great Dream Heart Ruins Immortal Scripture—both in terms of merging the thirty-six Dao Intentions and its compatibility with the Primordial World Creation Path.

But he was too poor!

Exhaling deeply, Zhang Jing forced himself to stop thinking about that exorbitantly priced Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability.

"I can always exchange for it after advancing to the Golden Core realm!" he consoled himself repeatedly.

Three days later, at noon.

Inside the simple palace at the center of the immortal island, Zhang Jing, seated cross-legged on a meditation mat, suddenly revealed an excited smile. His gaze was fixed on a golden talisman in his hand—the VIP Golden Talisman gifted to him by Yan Chihong of the Myriad Treasures Immortal Sect.

At this moment, the talisman displayed densely packed auction information, all concerning River of Time Golden Sand. At the center of the talisman was an enlarged auction notice:

**River of Time Golden Sand (100 grains)**
Current Bid: 9,200 Luck Points
Auction Ended.
Confirm payment and claim item?

"Yes!" Zhang Jing connected his spiritual sense to the talisman, confirming the payment of 9,200 Luck Points to claim the 100 grains of River of Time Golden Sand he had won.

Successfully purchasing these grains at 92 Luck Points each was one of his achievements over the past three days.

---

Spending three days to save a bit of Luck Points wasn't due to Zhang Jing's stinginess—though that was part of it. The main reason was another issue: Zhang Jing could now perfect a Dao Intention in at most six months, while the Luck Points he could earn in a year were barely enough to exchange for one Dao Intention.

In other words, his current rate of purchasing Dao Intentions couldn't keep up with his comprehension speed. It sounded unbelievable, but it was the reality. Thus, for Zhang Jing, spending two or three days to save some Luck Points was well worth it.

Upon confirmation, the talisman displayed Zhang Jing's remaining Luck Points before deducting 9,200. Golden light swirled from the talisman, forming a vortex that seemed to open a passage. Grains of golden sand faintly appeared within, attempting to emerge.

Yet, as they neared the exit, the grains encountered an invisible barrier, unable to proceed further.

"Hmm?" Zhang Jing's eyes flashed with confusion before realization dawned. He looked up, his gaze carrying a silent plea.

The barrier vanished, and the 100 grains of golden sand poured into his palm.

"Thank you, Master!" Zhang Jing promptly rose and bowed respectfully.

"Good," two overlapping voices whispered in his ear.

"Thankfully, Master noticed," Zhang Jing thought with relief. When the golden sand was blocked, he had quickly realized the issue—he was currently within his master's pocket realm. Without permission, it was nearly impossible for outsiders to deliver items directly.

---

Deep within the void of the pocket realm, inside an ancient bronze palace, two figures sat facing each other. One was the bird-headed, human-bodied avatar of Yuanming Zhenjun that Zhang Jing had met before. The other was even more peculiar—a vaguely humanoid form with no facial features, its body seemingly woven from intertwining green vines. Countless tiny roots extended from its back, piercing deep into the void.

The vine avatar withdrew its gaze, and a teasing voice echoed through the hall.

"Haha, the Golden Talisman of the Myriad Worlds Auction House. I suppose no one warned the little fellow not to use it inside a pocket realm?"

"Just trivial matters. Let him be," the bird-headed avatar replied with a smile.

"But—" Its tone turned surprised. "In just over two years, he's already perfected the Golden Sun Crimson Crow Dao Intention. And he previously mastered the opposing Taiyin Dragon Serpent Dao Intention. Now that Taiyin and Taiyang coexist within him, his path to comprehending Dao Intentions will be much smoother. Perhaps this little fellow might truly walk the Path of World Creation to its end?"

The vine avatar's voice carried a hint of anticipation.

"Let's hope so. This little fellow has quietly overcome the most difficult hurdle before the Dharma Form realm. Now, the only obstacle between him and the Heavenly Immortal realm is the Tribulation of Dao Attainment. The rest is just a matter of course."

"I believe the last to achieve Heavenly Immortal status through the Path of World Creation was Dao Lord Yuanchen, right? Elder Brother, having just returned from the outer realms, do you know how Dao Lord Yuanchen fares now?" the bird-headed avatar asked curiously.

"Dao Lord is still contending with Dao Lord Ao Shen of the Myriad Spirits True Dragon lineage in the outer realms over the Ten Thousand Dragons Demonic World. But the situation is clear—our Clear Heaven Profound Brightness will soon gain another Ten Thousand Dragons Demonic Secret Realm!" the vine avatar replied lightly.

"Excellent! Thus, the Profound Yellow World shall bestow boundless merit and Luck upon our Supreme Unity Dao Sect."

"By the way, Elder Brother," the bird-headed avatar added thoughtfully, "since that little fellow has proven suitable for the Path of World Creation, perhaps we should consider taking him as a formal disciple."

"A formal disciple, bound by the karma of master and disciple?" The vine avatar fell silent briefly. "Let's wait until he reaches the Golden Core realm. It's still too early."

"Very well."

Back in the palace on the immortal island, the golden spiritual light at Zhang Jing's brow faded as the River of Time Golden Sand disappeared. He sighed, a trace of disappointment in his eyes.

"Indeed, the River of Time Golden Sand has too negligible an effect on the Primordial World skill. The experience gain is even smaller than I expected."

His consciousness turned inward to his Niwan Palace, where the mysterious jade talisman flickered faintly.

**[Primordial World - Level 1 (3197/1,000,000)]**

After repeated attempts, Zhang Jing confirmed that each grain of River of Time Golden Sand only provided about 30 experience points. Even though the sand was relatively cheap, 30 points were a drop in the bucket compared to the 1,000,000 needed for the next level.

At this moment, Zhang Jing couldn't help but recall the River of Time Golden Crystal he had seen at the auction. Perhaps only that could significantly boost the Primordial World's experience—maybe even level it up several times with a single crystal. But alas...

As he pondered, a large deer head peeked in cautiously. Deer Thirty-Eight stared intently at the remaining golden sand in Zhang Jing's hand, its eyes filled with longing. It opened its mouth as if to speak but hesitated.

"Thirty-Eight, what is it?" Zhang Jing followed the deer's gaze to the golden sand and smiled. "Do you want this for your cultivation?"

The deer nodded vigorously, then shook its head. "Master... do you have any extra sand? I—I don't want it for cultivation, but... but..."

"But what?"

"To nurture the Three Radiance Immortal Peach Tree seed! My inherited memories tell me that items imbued with the power of time can accelerate the growth of immortal plants when used with a special method!"

Under Zhang Jing's urging, the deer blurted everything out, then shut its eyes fearfully, as if awaiting judgment.

On the other side, Zhang Jing's face lit up with astonishment, followed by excitement.

River of Time Golden Sand could accelerate the growth of immortal plants? The very problem he faced—the lack of sufficient Luck Points—might have a solution! If the Three Radiance Immortal Peach Tree could grow and bear fruit quickly...

He vividly remembered Senior Qing mentioning that someone had offered thirty million Luck Points for the fruit of the Three Radiance Immortal Peach Tree. Even if that was a special case, each peach should still be worth at least ten million. Was it too much to expect dozens of peaches from one tree? Zhang Jing didn't think so.

Even if not dozens, ten—or at least three to five—would still be worth tens of millions of Luck Points. And with a method to hasten growth, why stop at one tree? An entire grove would be ideal.

With this in mind, Zhang Jing looked at Deer Thirty-Eight with newfound appreciation. This wasn't just a mount—it was a god of wealth! As for whether the deer truly knew the special method it mentioned—its very request for the golden sand was proof enough.

---

By the spirit spring, Zhang Jing stood nervously watching as Deer Thirty-Eight carefully buried dozens of golden sand grains near the Three Radiance Immortal Peach Tree seed. The deer then guided spirit liquid from the spring to water the seed before covering it with soil again.

Green spiritual light erupted from the deer's body, flowing like water into the soil. A terrifying Dao Intention of seasonal cycles and the withering and flourishing of all life burst forth. In mere moments, the surrounding plants seemed to undergo multiple cycles of life and death.

As time passed and the Dao Intention faded, Zhang Jing extended his spiritual sense toward the buried seed. A faint but vibrant vitality greeted his senses.

"It worked!" Zhang Jing's heart surged with excitement.

But then his expression froze. The good news was that the golden sand could indeed hasten the seed's growth. The bad news was that it required a massive amount—at least five to six thousand grains just to sprout the seed. And to grow it to maturity and fruition? The required quantity would be staggering.

"Indeed, there are no true shortcuts in this world," Zhang Jing mused.

Nevertheless, he remained determined to nurture the peach tree quickly. The potential rewards far outweighed the cost of the golden sand. Besides, the tree wouldn't bear fruit just once...

His eyes gleamed as the auction talisman reappeared in his hand.

"Thirty-Eight," he said gently, "from now on, your sole task is to monitor the auction listings. Purchase all the River of Time Golden Sand you can at no more than ninety-five Luck Points per grain."

"Master, I don't know how," the deer replied timidly.

"I'll teach you."

Half a month later, in a cave abode on another immortal island, Zhang Jing accepted a cup of spirit tea from a nature spirit with polite hesitation.

"Junior Brother, your visit today isn't merely for old times' sake, is it?" Xuan Yuan smiled warmly.

Zhang Jing straightened. "Nothing escapes you, Senior Brother. I came partly to catch up, but also to ask about something."

"Please, go ahead."

"Might Senior Brother know of any secret realms suitable for my current Foundation Establishment realm that could yield substantial Luck Points?" Zhang Jing asked awkwardly, aware of how unreasonable his question sounded. He held little hope but thought Xuan Yuan, having been in the celestial realm longer, might know more.

He was truly desperate for Luck Points—he could barely afford the golden sand for the peach tree now. The pocket realm's Luck Points distribution was months away, and the Life-Restoring Elixir required time to condense... His only option seemed to be secret realms.

To his surprise, Xuan Yuan fell into deep thought before answering slowly, "Junior Brother, there is indeed such a realm—one that meets your requirements and offers Luck Points beyond your imagination, with minimal danger. However—" He paused meaningfully.
