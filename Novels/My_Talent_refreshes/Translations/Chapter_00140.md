**Chapter 140: Trying New Talents, Analyzing Talisman Origins**

Ten days later, Qingxi Sect.

Xin Wuyai sat in his cave abode, his expression ashen. His plan to acquire the Spirit Seed had utterly failed; the Spirit Seed he'd almost obtained had flown away. And his method of using Qi Cultivation disciples to break through to Foundation Establishment to sense the Spirit Seed's location was also sabotaged by the Yin Demon Sect. Now, several Qi Cultivation disciples had all been taken away by the Yin Demon Sect. The only glimmer of hope remaining for him was the actions of that Elder Yang in green robes. But at this moment, his last shred of hope was slowly crumbling.

“Master, we truly haven’t found any trace of Chu Ning. Since the Sect Protecting Grand Formation was activated that day, no one has entered or exited. Yet your disciple led people to search every inch of the sect, high and low, but still couldn't find Chu Ning.” He Litao stood in the center of the cave abode’s hall, reporting to Xin Wuyai, a hint of fear and confusion on his face. Xin Wuyai coldly glanced at him upon hearing this. “To not even be able to keep track of a single Qi Cultivation disciple, humph!” Though his words were filled with rage, Xin Wuyai’s gaze also held a hint of bewilderment. In fact, he had just used his divine sense to search the entire sect himself, but found nothing. It was unbelievable that a Qi Cultivation disciple could hide within their own sect for ten days without being discovered.

‘It’s a pity I returned a little too late. If I had returned two or three days earlier, I might have found some clues from the traces of Earth Escape Art,’ he thought to himself. As he pondered, a thought suddenly struck Xin Wuyai. Within this sect, for someone to be able to hide under the divine sense of a Golden Core cultivator like him, there was only one possibility: They were being shielded by another Golden Core cultivator. Or perhaps Chu Ning had left the sect, something Xin Wuyai hadn't even considered. The Sect Protecting Grand Formation was activated; besides Golden Core cultivators like them, no one could enter or exit. It was absolutely impossible for a Qi Cultivation disciple to leave. If they did leave, there was only one possibility – another Golden Core cultivator!

Thinking of this, Xin Wuyai’s usually gentle face took on a fluctuating, uncertain expression. The faces of the three Golden Core Elders flashed one by one in his mind. He Litao, standing below, saw Xin Wuyai’s expression and his face grew even more terrified. Having followed this Sect Master for a long time, he understood more deeply how ruthless this seemingly gentle Sect Master could be. However, the next moment, to He Litao’s surprise, Xin Wuyai simply waved his hand, dismissing him. Upon seeing this, He Litao quickly left the cave abode as if granted a great pardon.

...

In the cave abode, now only Xin Wuyai remained, and soon a soft murmur echoed. “Who could it be?”

...

Yuhua City is a medium-sized city in the mortal Yan Kingdom. This city is famous for its abundant production of jewels and jade, enjoying a high reputation in the surrounding kingdoms, thus attracting numerous jade merchants. Among nearby cities, it is considered quite prosperous. Currently, in a rather lively inn called Yuelai Inn within the city, Chu Ning sat in the first-floor hall, dressed in common sturdy attire.

Naturally, he was unaware of the events unfolding back at the Qingxi Sect. After several days of flying out of the Qingxia Mountain Range, Chu Ning traveled eastward for another few days before arriving at Yuhua City. Along the way, Chu Ning not only bought many items used by mortals but also specifically killed an ordinary wild bull and made a large beast-hide bag. He packed his storage bag, spirit beast pouch, and other items inside. At this moment, Chu Ning emitted no spiritual energy fluctuations, wore the sturdy clothes of a common martial artist, and had a large greatsword placed beside him. Anyone who saw him would only assume he was a mortal martial artist, not an immortal cultivator. This greatsword was, of course, also something Chu Ning acquired. In fact, for him, the type of weapon used in the mortal world made no difference. He chose to use such a weapon simply because he didn't know mortal martial arts, but he could certainly rely on brute force to overcome skill.

While eating, Chu Ning’s ears picked up conversations from various guests. “Have you heard? The Qingxi Sect in the Qingxia Mountain Range, I heard they're recruiting disciples all the way to Black Stone City next door.” “How could such a major sect travel so far to recruit disciples?” As two middle-aged men conversed, a younger man, about twenty years old, interjected. “Forget it, what major sect? I have a relative who just came back from Qingxi City yesterday. I heard that the Qingxi Sect couldn’t even protect its own disciples and directly handed them over to the Yin Demon Sect as atonement.” “Really?” one of the brawny men asked with a tone full of doubt. “Of course, it’s true.” At this point, another brawny man said: “Alright, alright, let’s not discuss the affairs of those immortal cultivation sects, we mere mortals.” “Yes, yes, let’s talk about Yuhua City instead. I heard this batch of jade production is very high. Many merchants have been looking for help these past few days, we might get another run soon.”

...

After sitting in the inn for a while, Chu Ning gathered quite a bit of information before getting up and leaving.

“Escorting jade?”

Chu Ning thought it was a very good idea. He had already decided on his destination, so Yuhua City was just a transit point for him. Although Yuhua City was already over a thousand li away from Qingxi Sect, Chu Ning still felt it was too close. After all, this area had sparse spiritual energy and no other immortal cultivation forces, so strictly speaking, it was still within the Qingxi Sect's sphere of influence. It was said that the imperial family of the Yan Kingdom was managed by an immortal cultivation family that had once been affiliated with the Qingxi Sect. Disguising himself as a mortal martial artist and then helping to escort jade out of Yuhua City would not be conspicuous. At that time, it wouldn’t be too late to head to his destination, or perhaps even find a caravan going in the same direction. He had spent the previous period constantly reviewing various geographical materials within the sect. Chu Ning now had a clearer understanding of the current world, and his next destination had long been decided.

Leaving the inn, Chu Ning walked towards the East Gate of Yuhua City. According to what he heard in the inn, Yuhua City had many jade merchants, and although most brought their own escorts, there were always special circumstances where merchants would temporarily recruit escorts. And the place for recruiting people was near the East Gate. Chu Ning walked all the way to the East Gate and indeed saw many people gathered not far from the city exit. There were both martial artists like Chu Ning who came to observe, and many people holding banners with various information written on them. “Recruiting two martial artists to escort jade to Yongsheng Prefecture.” “Recruiting four martial artists to escort jade to Luofeng City, round trip.”

...

Chu Ning looked at these messages; some were for nearby places, others for farther ones, but most were still within a few nearby towns. Such places naturally held no attraction for Chu Ning. “Hmm?” Just then, Chu Ning saw a sturdy man with a short beard, looking quite steady, probably in his thirties, holding a banner. “Recruiting six martial artists, ten porters, heading to Feiyan Dock.” Unlike others who might have people stopping to chat, many martial artists simply shook their heads and walked away after seeing this. “Going to Feiyan Dock, that’s too far.” “Indeed, and that place isn’t far from the immortal lands. If you run into an immortal cultivator… this job is not easy.”

...

Beside the man stood a merchant-dressed middle-aged man in his forties. He saw those martial artists and tried to initiate conversations several times, a hint of anxiety subtly showing on his face. “Master, why don’t you go back to the inn and rest? I’ll guard here.”

The middle-aged merchant sighed upon hearing this and said: “I’d rather stay here and wait with you. We’ve already been delayed quite a bit on the way here. If we can’t recruit people to transport the goods soon, we’ll miss the deadline.” Their conversation wasn't loud, but for Chu Ning, whose divine sense was keen, he could hear it clearly. Feiyan Dock? Chu Ning’s eyebrows twitched slightly, and he walked over proactively. “Excuse me, is this Feiyan Dock the one in the north, between Yangui Mountain and Hushan Lake?” Suddenly hearing someone inquire, the middle-aged merchant’s eyes lit up immediately, and the sturdy man in his thirties quickly spoke: “Indeed, it’s Feiyan Dock there. Is this brave warrior willing to go? The remuneration will absolutely satisfy you.”

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning’s face showed a slight hesitation. “That place, it’s nearly a three-month journey.” “The journey is indeed a bit long, but we have horses, so it won’t be too arduous. If the brave warrior is willing to go, I am willing to offer this amount.” The middle-aged merchant seemed afraid Chu Ning wouldn’t be interested and immediately raised a hand, stating the remuneration. “Fifty silver taels, that’s quite a lot.” Chu Ning murmured softly, then looked up at the middle-aged merchant and said: “Alright, I agree.”

“Hold on!” The middle-aged merchant was about to respond, but the short-bearded sturdy man solemnly interjected. Chu Ning looked at him, and the man continued: “Brother, this journey is long, and we need capable friends. Can you handle it? I, Li, will have to test you.” Chu Ning smiled upon hearing this. “Oh, how will you test me?” “Naturally, with a spar.” The short-bearded man, who called himself Li, glanced at him and continued gravely: “Brother, please wait a moment. I still need to recruit a few more people here. Once we have enough, we’ll find a place.”

“A spar?” Chu Ning chuckled, then suddenly reached out and grabbed the pole of the banner the short-bearded man was holding. The short-bearded man watched Chu Ning’s not-so-fast hand extend, a gleam in his eyes. His left hand pulled back the banner pole, while his other hand reached for Chu Ning’s wrist. His movements were extremely swift, and he fully expected to easily grasp Chu Ning’s hand. But to his astonishment, his grab came up completely empty. The next moment, the short-bearded man’s face changed dramatically. The banner pole that should have been in his left hand was now, somehow, in Chu Ning’s hand. And he hadn’t even reacted. “Too slow!” Chu Ning inwardly chuckled.

The movements of these mortal martial artists were like slow-motion replays in his eyes; how could they dodge his moves? But at this moment, the short-bearded man’s heart was filled with utter shock. He prided himself on his skill, yet against Chu Ning’s single grasp, he couldn’t even put up any resistance. “What incredible speed!” “Such exceptional skill, this…” The short-bearded man felt a slight hesitation. The middle-aged merchant, however, looked at Chu Ning with shining eyes. Although he hadn’t clearly seen the process, he had seen the result. He was undoubtedly aware of his own guard instructor’s skill. Now, seeing Chu Ning’s apparent superior skill, he said repeatedly: “Good, good! What is this brave warrior’s name? If you join, I will add ten silver taels.” “Chu Ping!” Chu Ning casually made up a name. In the nearby cities, the Chu surname was common, so there was no need to deliberately change his surname. “Young Hero Chu, come, come, I’ll first take you to the inn to settle down. Once Li Song finishes recruiting people here, we’ll depart together.”

Li Song, seeing the middle-aged merchant’s actions, opened his mouth but ultimately said nothing. He simply kept his gaze fixed on the retreating figures of the middle-aged merchant and Chu Ning, his brow slightly furrowed. Chu Ning’s perception was keen; even without intentionally releasing his divine sense, he could sense Li Song’s actions to some extent. Smiling slightly, Chu Ning pretended not to notice and continued chatting with the middle-aged merchant. From the middle-aged merchant’s mouth, Chu Ning learned that his name was Cheng Jinhe. He had actually come from Feiyan Dock himself, originally leading a team of guards. However, on the way, they encountered a group of bandits. Although the goods were saved, many guards were killed or injured. That's why this time, when transporting the jade back, he wanted to recruit more martial artists as guards. The middle-aged merchant asked about Chu Ning’s situation, and Chu Ning merely said he was from a nearby family and loosely fabricated some details. These details were all consistent with Chu Ning's existing knowledge, so the merchant naturally couldn't detect any flaws.

The two arrived at the Baiyun Inn in the city. Cheng Jinhe had a top-tier room arranged for Chu Ning. Only after getting Chu Ning’s promise that he would definitely participate in the escort did he happily return to his own room. Meanwhile, Chu Ning, now in his room, casually threw out a talisman, isolating the entire room. This Spirit Control Talisman belonged to the low-grade mid-tier talismans, which Chu Ning had learned from the Profound Talisman Treasure Scroll. This talisman not only had a sound-insulating effect but also prevented spiritual energy fluctuations from being sensed by the outside world.

Thinking that he would need this item in the mortal world, Chu Ning had temporarily learned how to draw it. This low-grade mid-tier talisman was naturally extremely simple for Chu Ning; it didn’t take him long to draw quite a few. After activating the Spirit Control Talisman, Chu Ning patted his spirit beast pouch, and immediately two small creatures appeared before him. One was naturally Little Bai, and the other was the Iron Rock Beast cub. When Chu Ning first obtained this demonic beast cub, he initially didn't know what to do. After all, when he first got Little Bai, the little guy was already fully grown. And it knew how to express what it wanted to eat. But this Iron Rock Beast understood nothing. Fortunately, Chu Ning remembered that when he killed several Yin Demon Sect disciples in the Spirit Realm, two of them were from the spirit beast stable. At that time, they had some jade slips with information about spirit beasts on them, so he immediately took them out to check. Among the jade slips, there was indeed information about the Iron Rock Beast. This type of demonic beast was surprisingly easy to raise; it just ate dirt. Of course, ordinary dirt could only fill its stomach, but to make this demonic beast grow well and quickly, it needed spirit earth with spiritual energy. So, before leaving the Qingxia Mountain Range, Chu Ning had dug up two storage bags full of spirit earth, which he figured would be enough for the Iron Rock Beast to eat for quite some time. After releasing the Iron Rock Beast, Chu Ning took out some spirit earth from his storage bag and fed it. Little Bai, meanwhile, kept calling out softly, looking very interested. “Little Bai, look, others can grow up just by eating dirt, but you, even after constantly eating spirit fruits, still look the same.” Chu Ning teased Little Bai with a spiritual sense transmission, immediately making the little guy anxious. It amused Chu Ning greatly, almost making him burst into laughter. However, this Iron Rock Beast indeed grew quickly. In just ten days, the little fellow had already grown a small circle larger. Its eyes could also open now, and it would occasionally look at Chu Ning and Little Bai, appearing very affectionate.

After letting the two spirit beasts out for a bit of fresh air, he put them back into their spirit beast pouch. Chu Ning then sat down cross-legged and began cultivating the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art. The mortal world also had spiritual energy, though it was extremely sparse. So, Chu Ning could still cultivate, but progress would naturally be slow. Fortunately, Chu Ning had already decided to focus on consolidating his cultivation realm during this period, so he wasn't in a hurry. At this moment, Chu Ning was still in the stage of refining his spiritual energy after changing cultivation techniques. Cultivating this Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art allowed him to absorb fire-attribute spiritual energy from the heavens and earth.

This would allow the wood-attribute spiritual energy in Chu Ning’s Dantian to transform into dual wood-fire attribute spiritual energy. However, even without spiritual energy, he could still gradually accumulate dual-attribute spiritual energy through the cultivation technique, with wood generating fire. Although the latter method would be slower, for Chu Ning, who had broken through too quickly in the early stages, this was not necessarily a bad thing. So, even though Chu Ning had Fire Spirit Crystals in his storage bag, he didn't take them out to assist his cultivation. On one hand, the spiritual energy of Fire Spirit Crystals was too dense, making it easy for other cultivators to sense. On the other hand, Chu Ning himself deliberately wanted to “slow down” at this moment.

After a few cycles, Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes. Feeling that another trace of dual wood-fire attribute spiritual energy had formed, he nodded in satisfaction. With this cultivation method, his proficiency naturally didn’t increase much, but he didn’t mind it. Instead, he took out a talisman from his storage bag. It was a Sword Sealing Talisman, a low-grade high-tier talisman. Chu Ning had obtained this talisman from the storage bag of a Yin Demon Sect disciple. After the Green Wood Eternal Spring Art’s third layer proficiency reached maximum and refreshed his talents, Chu Ning had reviewed the hidden talents of his various Spirit Bodies. However, he hadn't had time to truly experience them. Not only had he not had time to cultivate newly acquired spells like the Blazing Fire Flame Art, but he also hadn't tried the hidden talents of the Talisman Origin Spirit Body and True Talisman Spirit Body. Now was a good time to try.

“Analyze talismanic patterns, comprehend talisman principles…” Chu Ning muttered to himself, then focused his gaze and began observing the talismanic patterns on the Sword Sealing Talisman. Initially, there was no sensation, but as he continuously followed the patterns with his eyes, imagining himself crafting the talisman, Gradually, Chu Ning felt as if points of light were illuminating on the talisman. It was truly as if he were crafting a talisman himself. Then, these points of light, as if alive, converged into symbols and surged into his mind. “So this is how it is!” He didn’t know how much time had passed, but Chu Ning emerged from his motionless concentration. A look of sudden understanding was on his face. He had already understood a small portion of the Sword Sealing Talisman’s crafting principles. At the same time, Chu Ning noticed that the hundred drops of divine sense liquid in his Niwan Palace had been significantly consumed. “Analyzing talismanic patterns and exploring talisman origins is indeed profound. With my current divine sense strength, I only analyzed a small portion, yet it consumed a large portion of my divine sense.” Although Chu Ning thought this, a smile appeared on his face. At this rate, in just three to five days, he would be able to fully analyze the Sword Sealing Talisman’s patterns.

A low-grade high-tier talisman was possible, what about a mid-grade talisman? Chu Ning’s eyes brightened. At the same time, he closed his eyes and began cultivating the Divine Sense Refining Art. Cultivating the Divine Sense Refining Art after consuming divine sense during talisman crafting not only allowed divine sense to recover but also helped to strengthen it. Then, analyzing talismans with divine sense should also work the same way.
