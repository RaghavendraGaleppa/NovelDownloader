# Chapter 17: Golden Metal Grass-Cutting Sword

"You!"

"You... you... you!!!"

Ji Yourong was on the verge of tears. 

This guy in front of her was simply too much! 

Out of all the meditation cushions available, why did he have to pick the one she was sitting on? 

Was hers somehow more fragrant? 

Meanwhile, Mu Sen watched the interaction between Zhang Yan and Ji Yourong with an amused expression, shaking his head as he did so. 

His junior brother was still too young! 

Even if he liked a girl and wanted to get her attention, he shouldn't be this reckless! 

Pursuing a girl required strategy. 

Putting her in such an awkward position would only make her avoid him in the future. 

Zhang Yan, of course, had no idea what Mu Sen or Ji Yourong were thinking. In truth, he was also frustrated. 

He had discovered that this girl was practically cursed—every meditation cushion she chose had special attributes. 

And since he couldn't just ignore those cushions, he had no choice but to act this way. 

"You're going too far!" Ji Yourong's clear eyes shimmered with unshed tears. 

This was just too much! She had never been treated so unfairly before! 

With a pout, she reluctantly stood up, head lowered, and shuffled to a corner to sit down, looking like a wronged child. 

"Sorry." 

Though he felt guilty, Zhang Yan's priority was the special attributes on the cushions. 

After taking the cushion, he turned and left without hesitation. 

The onlookers, including Mu Sen and the other disciples, were stunned. 

Just where did this bold guy come from? 

Was he really this fearless? 

He made a girl cry and just walked away without a care? 

Could someone really be this obsessed with a meditation cushion? 

This was beyond ridiculous! 

Shouldn't the next step have been to apologize and take the girl out instead? 

How could he just leave like that? 

Regardless of what others thought, Zhang Yan had already left the Enlightenment Peak and was heading straight back to his spirit herb fields. 

Upon returning, he didn't immediately start cultivating. 

Due to the time restrictions on unequipping items—twelve hours when he had one equipment slot, six hours with two, and now three hours with three slots—he first replenished his spiritual energy and resumed his work. 

Cultivation was important, but so was farming. 

Cultivation was for the future. 

Farming was for the present. 

Both had to be prioritized. 

After a full day of labor, night fell, and the time restriction was finally lifted. 

Without hesitation, Zhang Yan unequipped all his gear and replaced them with the three meditation cushions. 

The moment he did, his mind cleared instantly. 

Problems that had once troubled him now had new solutions. 

Examining the attributes of the three cushions—one with "Great Mastery of Wood Element Art" and two with "Minor Mastery of Wood Element Art"—he found that their combined effects gave him a deeper understanding of the Wood Element Art. 

He extended a hand, and a pure emerald light flickered at his fingertips. 

With his other hand, he produced a seed of a half-spirit herb. 

The emerald light, like fireflies, drifted from his fingers and merged into the seed. 

In the next moment, the seed sprouted, roots stretching out, stems growing, leaves unfurling—until it became a fully mature half-spirit herb, its slender form and lush greenery surpassing that of ordinary specimens. 

"This..." 

Zhang Yan was overjoyed. 

The combined effect of two "Minor Mastery" and one "Great Mastery" attributes had pushed his Wood Element Art to the verge of perfection. 

Every time he used the art now, insights flooded his mind, each one pointing directly to the core principles of the technique. 

"So this is the essence of the Wood Element Art?" 

He was awestruck. 

He had a feeling that once he fully grasped these insights, his Wood Element Art would reach perfection. 

A perfected spell—just the thought was exhilarating! 

"Of course, the most important thing is still the cultivation technique!" 

Sitting cross-legged, Zhang Yan began to meditate on the Evergreen Technique. 

The Evergreen Technique was unremarkable, known for its stability and suitability for all ages. 

The wood-attribute spiritual energy it produced not only prolonged life but also aided the growth of spirit plants. 

Zhang Yan had already reached minor mastery in the technique, but now, with the help of the meditation cushions, his comprehension deepened further. 

By the time dawn arrived, he opened his eyes, a glimmer of delight flashing within them. 

These meditation cushions were truly extraordinary. 

Just one night, and his understanding of the Evergreen Technique had already improved. 

At this rate, within half a year, he could reach great mastery—further boosting his cultivation speed. 

The thought alone lifted his spirits. 

"Time to get to work!" 

After a moment of reflection, Zhang Yan threw himself into tending his spirit herb fields. 

Between daily cultivation, farming, studying techniques, and practicing spells, his life was fulfilling. 

But this peaceful routine was soon interrupted by a message on his jade token. 

"Hmm?" 

"Is it time to learn the Golden Metal Grass-Cutting Sword?" 

Upon reaching the first level of Qi Refinement, the sect had rewarded him with the opportunity to learn two spells. 

One was the Wood Element Art, which he had chosen for its ability to accelerate plant growth. 

The other was the Golden Metal Grass-Cutting Sword—a dual-purpose spell. 

On one hand, it was an offensive technique, solving his lack of attack spells. 

On the other, it contained wood-attribute properties, making it useful for pest control in spirit plants. 

Yes, just like ordinary crops, spirit plants were also plagued by pests—ones that were even harder to kill since they fed on spiritual energy. 

The Golden Metal Grass-Cutting Sword was the perfect solution. 

"In that case, it's time to return to Enlightenment Peak." 

With that thought, Zhang Yan summoned his Golden Bamboo Sword and soared toward the peak in a streak of golden light. 

Upon arriving at the Enlightenment Hall, his first instinct was to scan the meditation cushions. 

But to his disappointment, the attributes this time were surprisingly poor. 

The best two only offered "Minor Mastery of Golden Metal Grass-Cutting Sword," while the rest either had minor enlightenment-boosting effects or merely "Beginner Level" in the technique. 

"Sigh... mastering spells is so difficult. I guess I can't aim for great mastery right away—minor mastery will have to do." 

With a resigned sigh, Zhang Yan muttered to himself.
