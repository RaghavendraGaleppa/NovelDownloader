# Chapter 33: Interrogation at the Law Enforcement Hall  

The Law Enforcement Hall was dimly lit.  

It was a small room, its walls reinforced with refined iron, inscribed with runes and layered with formations.  

Everywhere one looked, instruments of punishment lined the space, evoking fear at first glance.  

Li Zhengjing sat calmly in the shadowy room. Beside him stood an ordinary potted tree and a strangely shaped mortal bird, both silent and still.  

After a while, Xie Changqing, the inner sect elder currently overseeing the Law Enforcement Hall, arrived. He carried a ledger in one hand and a brush in the other.  

"Nephew, it's been a while. Today's questioning is just routine—no need to be nervous."  

"Six days ago, former outer sect steward Chen Youyu was demoted to Bailing City and subsequently murdered by an assailant. Are you aware of this?"  

"I am," Li Zhengjing nodded.  

In the adjacent room, Gao Changhe let out a sigh of relief.  

*"Since he admits to knowing about it so frankly, there shouldn’t be much of an issue."*  

Gao Changhe knew the matter had caused quite a stir, spreading even to Wanlin County. It was only natural that Li Zhengjing would have heard of it.  

Had he feigned ignorance, it would have suggested guilt—a near-certain sign of his involvement.  

As he pondered this, the questioning continued.  

"It has come to my attention that during his tenure as an outer sect steward, Chen Youyu oppressed you."  

"Moreover, his demotion from the sect was due to negligence in overseeing spirit beasts, which nearly cost you your life."  

"In my view, it's possible the incident with the spirit beast was a deliberate attempt on your life."  

Xie Changqing continued, "Given such deep enmity between you, did you ever consider killing him?"  

"I did entertain the thought," Li Zhengjing admitted openly, spreading his hands. "But my abilities are limited. Until recently, I only practiced external techniques. Even now, I’ve only cultivated internal qi for less than a month. How could I possibly kill an outer sect steward who’s been at the 'Internal Qi' realm for over forty years?"  

"Yet, the day before Chen Youyu was killed, you accepted the case involving the demonic cultivator in Wanlin County, Qixing Prefecture."  

Xie Changqing pressed, "If you knew your internal qi cultivation was still shallow, why take on such a dangerous case?"  

Li Zhengjing replied, "At the time, I didn’t know how powerful the demonic cultivator was. Freshly achieving internal qi, I was overconfident—I thought I could handle it."  

Xie Changqing asked slowly, "Could it be that you took the case because Qixing Prefecture borders Bailing Prefecture, allowing you to kill Chen Youyu along the way?"  

Li Zhengjing remained impassive. "From what I understand, Chen Youyu was killed while I was still en route to Wanlin County. How does that implicate me?"  

"You never went to Wanlin County at all!"  

A new voice cut in. "I didn’t see you there that day."  

The speaker was a middle-aged man in his forties, clean-shaven, his aura strong—clearly at the peak of the Internal Qi realm.  

Li Zhengjing glanced at the man’s waist token, narrowing his eyes slightly before smiling.  

*"Chen Yang, inner sect disciple."*  

That name had been cropping up far too often lately.  

*"So the shadowy figure behind all this has finally stepped into the light?"*  

"Without evidence, you make accusations based solely on your word?"  

Li Zhengjing studied him and said slowly, "Senior Brother Chen Yang, what were you doing on the road to Wanlin County? Waiting to ambush me?"  

"What, are you interrogating *me* now?"  

Chen Yang’s expression remained cold. He bowed slightly to Xie Changqing. "Elder, this man is almost certainly the murderer of my uncle, Chen Youyu!"  

"Without proof, do not make baseless claims!" Xie Changqing rebuked. "You can’t condemn him on your word alone."  

Chen Yang opened his mouth to argue, but Xie Changqing tossed a case file in front of him.  

"The records show he left the sect in the morning and arrived in Wanlin County by evening."  

"Chen Youyu was killed at noon—when Li Zhengjing was still on the road. He couldn’t have reached Dalao City where Chen Youyu was."  

"His involvement is unlikely. This is merely a routine inquiry."  

"Chen Yang, you’ve been temporarily assigned to the Law Enforcement Hall. You may observe, but do not overstep."  

Xie Changqing’s tone was stern.  

"Elder Xie!" Chen Yang remained composed. "I theorize that with a Swift Travel Talisman, he could have reached Dalao City by noon and still made it to Wanlin County by evening."  

"Did you find any Swift Travel Talismans on him?" Xie Changqing asked.  

"No," Chen Yang admitted. "He likely destroyed the evidence beforehand."  

"Swift Travel Talismans are rare. He might not have been willing to part with one." Xie Changqing scoffed. "Did you check the public records for any talismans he might have requisitioned?"  

"No," Chen Yang shook his head.  

"Did your Chen clan’s investigators find any trace of Li Zhengjing in Dalao City?"  

"No," Chen Yang conceded. "The killer burned all evidence. Even the surrounding wildlife fled. Junior Sister He Qingyu from the Beast Taming Hall couldn’t find anything either."  

"Then why insist it’s him?" Xie Changqing demanded.  

Chen Yang fell silent.  

*How could he admit that he had personally tried to ambush Li Zhengjing and failed, thus knowing the latter hadn’t gone straight to Wanlin County?*  

*Or that he had sent Chen Bing and Zhou Mo to intercept Li Zhengjing, only for them to die today?*  

"Elder Xie, his feud with Chen Youyu runs deep, and he conveniently left the sect that very day. He’s the prime suspect! Moreover—"  

Chen Yang’s voice hardened. "The Grand Elder has tasked me with solving this case. I cannot overlook any suspect!"  

Invoking the Grand Elder’s name visibly darkened Xie Changqing’s expression.  

In the next room, Gao Changhe sighed and shook his head.  

He wasn’t sure whether Li Zhengjing was the killer.  

*Others might not have Swift Travel Talismans, but that bird, Bai Guabi, definitely does.*  

*Though Li Zhengjing only recently reached the Internal Qi realm, he captured a demonic cultivator at the upper Internal Qi level in Wanlin County.*  

*Chen Youyu, weakened by age, might not have been stronger than that demonic cultivator.*  

*"Since Bai Guabi is involved, and Li Zhengjing was instrumental in escorting it, we could invoke Elder Bai Xiao’s token."*  

*"Chen Yang clearly isn’t interested in evidence—he’s using the Grand Elder’s name to pressure the Law Enforcement Hall into condemning Li Zhengjing without proof."*  

*"Chen Youyu was a member of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. His murder within sect territory is a grave matter—the Law Enforcement Hall must resolve it quickly."*  

*"Under the Grand Elder’s influence, whether Li Zhengjing is guilty or not, he’ll likely be made the scapegoat."*  

*"At this point, only Elder Bai Xiao’s authority can counterbalance the Grand Elder’s and resolve this."*  

With that thought, Gao Changhe tapped lightly on the wall and left to retrieve Bai Xiao’s token.  

Xie Changqing, whose qi had refined his hearing, caught the faint signal.  

*"Senior Brother Gao left first—has he abandoned Li Zhengjing, or is he seeking another way to protect him?"*  

*"Chen Yang alone isn’t a concern, but if Grand Elder Chen Zhu is truly behind this, I can’t afford to interfere."*  

Just as Xie Changqing considered this, Chen Yang—now emboldened by the Grand Elder’s name—stepped forward, disregarding Xie Changqing entirely.  

"Did you kill Steward Chen Youyu?" Chen Yang demanded.  

"Do you really think someone who’s only cultivated internal qi for twenty days could kill Chen Youyu?" Li Zhengjing countered.  

"You subdued a spirit beast shortly after reaching Internal Qi. This time, you captured an upper Internal Qi demonic cultivator in Wanlin County."  

Chen Yang sneered. "With such skill, killing Chen Youyu wouldn’t be difficult for you."  

As he spoke, he couldn’t help but feel a twinge of awe.  

But the more Li Zhengjing impressed him, the more determined he became to eliminate him.  

*If this kid is allowed to grow, how could he ever be controlled?*  

"The case file states that the demonic cultivator was severely injured and missing an arm—his strength was a fraction of its peak."  

Li Zhengjing spread his hands. "If I couldn’t handle someone in that state, wouldn’t I be a disgrace to the sect?"  

"Your eloquence is impressive, Junior Brother Li."  

Chen Yang reached into his robe and produced a sheet of paper. "Let’s set aside Chen Youyu for now. Do you know that Chen Bing and Zhou Mo, who worked with you in Wanlin County, were killed this afternoon?"  

Li Zhengjing feigned shock. "They’re dead? How gruesome was it?"  

Chen Yang’s face was stony. "They died on the road you took back."  

Li Zhengjing widened his eyes. "Weren’t they investigating Chen Youyu’s murder in Wanlin County? Why would they die on that road? Did they pick that spot to die?"  

Chen Yang stepped closer, lowering his voice. "I know they died because of you."  

Li Zhengjing sighed. "Again, you condemn me with nothing but words. This is the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, not your Chen family’s domain."  

"Speaking of which, I heard in Wanlin County that over a dozen members of the Chen clan were killed near Qixing and Bailing Prefectures..."  

"Chen Yang, why not pin every Chen clan death on me while you’re at it?"  

He smirked. "Since it’s all capital offenses, what’s a few more?"  

"This interrogation is over!"  

Xie Changqing abruptly declared. "Li Zhengjing, until your name is cleared, you will remain here. Do not leave."  

With that, he swept out of the room.  

Chen Yang had no choice but to relent. He gave Li Zhengjing a mocking look.  

"If we can’t find the killer, this case will remain unsolved. But since I’ve identified the culprit, you *will* face justice."  

Li Zhengjing watched him calmly, his attention shifting to the golden page in his mind.  

The line detailing his fortune remained unchanged.  

*Today’s events pose no threat to me.*  

*"I thought this shadowy figure, Chen Yang, was some mastermind. Turns out, he’s no better than Chen Youyu."*  

Li Zhengjing mused, *"Could someone like him really have tampered with the Visceral Qi Cultivation Manual?"*
