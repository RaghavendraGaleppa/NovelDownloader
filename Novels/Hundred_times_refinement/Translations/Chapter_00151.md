# Chapter 99: Perseverance Grass (Votes Please)

After a moment, Lin Xuan withdrew his spiritual sense from the jade slip and exhaled softly. "I'll take this cultivation technique."

He stored the Earthfire Talisman, the alchemy manual, and the new Spirit Eye technique into his storage bracelet. Having acquired everything he needed from this trip, Lin Xuan was about to leave the Hailong Pavilion when the shopkeeper called out to him, "Fellow Daoist, wait."

Lin Xuan paused, slightly surprised. "Is there something else?"

The plump shopkeeper hesitated before asking, "Fellow Daoist, how confident are you in your alchemy skills?"

Lin Xuan frowned and remained silent.

"Don't misunderstand," the shopkeeper quickly added. "I ask not out of malice. Our shop has a medicinal herb that can significantly increase the success rate of alchemy."

"Such a thing exists?" Lin Xuan couldn't help but show a trace of astonishment. Although he was merely a low-level cultivator at the Qi Refining stage, he had been on the path of cultivation for four years. Through exposure at the Piaoyun Valley, he had gained considerable knowledge, yet he had never heard of any herb that could improve alchemy success rates.

"Fellow Daoist, rest assured. I would never deceive you. This spirit herb was only recently discovered and is extremely rare."

Lin Xuan remained skeptical. For cultivators, pills that could enhance cultivation and break through bottlenecks were invaluable. Yet, refining pills was notoriously prone to failure. If something could genuinely increase success rates, it would surely cause a storm in the cultivation world—hardly something a low-level cultivator like himself would be offered so casually.

"To be honest, this herb only works for Marrow Cleansing Pills," the shopkeeper explained, noticing Lin Xuan's doubt. "This Perseverance Grass can only improve the success rate of refining Marrow Cleansing Pills, making it perfect for cultivators like yourself."

"Does it work for all grades of Marrow Cleansing Pills?"

"Of course! Whether you're refining low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, or even supreme-grade pills, this herb can increase the success rate," the shopkeeper boasted confidently. "As I've said, our shop's items may be slightly more expensive, but their quality is guaranteed."

Given the shopkeeper's firm assurance and the satisfactory purchases he had already made at Hailong Pavilion, Lin Xuan felt tempted. The reason was simple: he had tens of thousands of failed pills in his possession, ensuring a steady supply of high-grade pills. However, Silver Moon Flowers and Firefly Grass were scarce. If the secondary refinement failed...

Lin Xuan looked at the shopkeeper. "How much for the Perseverance Grass?"

"One stalk of Perseverance Grass can be used for one batch of pills. It costs five hundred spirit stones."

"Five hundred spirit stones?" Lin Xuan weighed the price in his mind. Objectively speaking, if the herb truly had such an extraordinary effect, the price wasn't unreasonable. However, he didn't have that many spirit stones left.

---

"Here's what we'll do. I'll reserve the herb and come back for it tomorrow at this time. Is that acceptable?" Lin Xuan handed over his last remaining hundred spirit stones to the shopkeeper.

"Certainly! I'll await your return, Fellow Daoist."

Leaving Hailong Pavilion, Lin Xuan didn't linger. After confirming with his spiritual sense that no one was following him, he swiftly flew away. Half an hour later, he landed in a desolate, uninhabited area. By then, the effects of the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art had worn off, revealing his true appearance.

Closing his eyes, Lin Xuan reflected on his actions in the market. Admittedly, he had appeared somewhat ostentatious with his wealth, but it didn't matter since no one had seen his real face. The disguise technique was indeed incredibly useful.

Foundation Establishment was a goal Lin Xuan was determined to achieve, so the Perseverance Grass was a must. As for the lack of spirit stones, he already had a plan. Now, all he needed to do was wait six hours to reactivate the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art. The technique was excellent, but the cooldown period between uses was rather inconvenient.

Naturally, Lin Xuan wouldn't waste this idle time. He retrieved the jade slip and immersed his spiritual sense into it, carefully studying its contents. Then, he found a spot to sit cross-legged and began circulating his spiritual energy according to the technique. The modified jade slip was miraculous, but since it was only a basic technique, Lin Xuan mastered it effortlessly.

Next, he took out the alchemy manual and began reading it meticulously. Unbeknownst to him, six hours had passed.

Lin Xuan looked up at the sky. Night had fallen, but that was no issue—the market operated around the clock. After reactivating the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art to assume a new appearance, he flew back to the market.

"Immortal Master."

This time, he was greeted by a young woman in her late teens. Though not particularly beautiful, she appeared clever and quick-witted—another outer disciple of the Hailong Sect.

"I'd like to rent a stall here. Where should I go to arrange that?" Without waiting for her to ask, Lin Xuan stated his request directly.

"You wish to set up a stall? Please follow me, Immortal Master."

The girl led the way, with Lin Xuan following at a leisurely pace. After winding through numerous pavilions and corridors, they arrived at a small courtyard. "Here we are."

The girl bowed slightly and gestured for him to enter. Inside the courtyard, five or six cultivators were either sitting or standing.

Among them were two at the early Qi Refining stage and two at the mid-Qi Refining stage. Lin Xuan was pleased—the newly learned Spirit Eye technique was indeed effective, allowing him to discern their cultivation levels without even actively using it.

However, when his gaze fell upon the last cultivator, Lin Xuan's pupils contracted slightly. He couldn't discern this person's cultivation level.

The man appeared to be in his fifties or sixties, with kindly features that gave off a gentle impression. Yet, Lin Xuan couldn't gauge his strength. Could he be a Foundation Establishment cultivator?

With this thought, Lin Xuan adopted a respectful expression. While he might not genuinely revere the man, appearances had to be maintained.

"Greetings, Senior."

"Ah, no need for formalities, young friend. All guests here are welcome. Are you looking to rent a stall?"

"Yes, but I only need it for one day. Is that possible?"

"One day?" The elder's expression remained unchanged. "Of course, though short-term rentals are relatively more expensive. The daily rate is five spirit stones."

"Agreed."

Lin Xuan quickly completed the formalities. The elder handed him a waist token and a jade slip. "The token is proof of your rental. The jade slip contains guidelines for setting up your stall. May your business prosper, young friend."

"Thank you, Senior." Lin Xuan left cheerfully.

Once outside the courtyard, his smile faded. He infused his spiritual sense into the jade slip, skimmed through its contents, and then followed the directions to his stall.

"Brother Zhang, have you heard? There's a new stall in the southwest corner of the market selling Marrow Cleansing Pills."

"Fellow Daoist Li, you know about it too? Let's hurry—if we're late, the pills might be gone."

---

Within half an hour, word had spread among the low-level cultivators in the market about a new stall named "Pill Hall."

Though the stall appeared unremarkable at first glance, it sold Marrow Cleansing Pills—pills that could consolidate foundations and enhance the cultivation of low-level practitioners.

Compared to the remote Yanzhou, the cultivation standards in Youzhou were significantly higher. The market offered a variety of materials, talismans, and spiritual tools, but one thing was conspicuously lacking: pills that could boost cultivation.

Some stalls sold pills, but they were mostly for healing or physical enhancement—hardly appealing to cultivators.

Marrow Cleansing Pills were different. Though they were only suitable for Qi Refining cultivators, they genuinely enhanced strength. Even the major sects in Youzhou could provide their disciples with only a limited supply of such pills. Thus, the moment this small stall opened, business boomed.

Demand far outstripped supply, and the price of the pills skyrocketed. Low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills, originally priced at one spirit stone per pill, surged to three spirit stones.

The stall had no assistants. The proprietor was a sallow-faced middle-aged man who remained expressionless despite the bustling trade. His composed demeanor made many cultivators with ill intentions hesitate, unsure whether to act.

This man was, of course, Lin Xuan, disguised once more with the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art. His motive wasn't solely to purchase the Perseverance Grass—after achieving Foundation Establishment, Marrow Cleansing Pills would be useless to him. Rather than let them go to waste, he might as well sell them to amass more spirit stones.

Thus, apart from retaining the failed pills needed for refining high-grade pills, Lin Xuan sold all his low-grade pills. He kept the mid-grade pills, however, as even the three major sects in Youzhou could only refine a limited number each month. Selling them would draw too much attention.

In the cultivation world, it was best to avoid standing out.

Though he had rented the stall for a full day, Lin Xuan sold out all his low-grade pills in just half an hour. Due to the soaring prices, his earnings far exceeded expectations—nearly five thousand spirit stones.

"Everyone, the pills are sold out for today. Please come back tomorrow."

At the sallow-faced man's announcement, the cultivators sighed in disappointment. It was rare to find pills that could consolidate foundations and boost cultivation, yet they had arrived too late. After lingering for a while, they reluctantly dispersed.

Once everyone had left, Lin Xuan closed the stall. However, his expression showed no joy at the substantial profit. While spirit stones were useful, they could also invite trouble. Within the market, transactions were protected by the Hailong Sect, but once outside, there was no guarantee someone wouldn't target him.
