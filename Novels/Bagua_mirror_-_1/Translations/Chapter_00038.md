# Chapter 38: The Azure Feather Sect  

According to the jade slip's description, with his current cultivation level, a single activation of the Phantom Shadow Dash could only cover a distance of about a hundred zhang. Moreover, controlling the direction of the dash required the assistance of spiritual sense.  

Thus, the distance covered by this movement technique was also somewhat related to the strength of one's spiritual sense.  

Qin Chong promptly stored away the other two secret techniques, deciding to first practice the Phantom Shadow Dash. At critical moments, it could be a lifesaver.  

Movement techniques were primarily categorized into the Five Elements Dashes and the Three Oddities Dashes, though there were also many unconventional variations derived from these mainstream techniques.  

Currently, Qin Chong mainly cultivated earth-attribute techniques, making earth-based movement techniques the most suitable for him. However, those could only be barely practiced after reaching Foundation Establishment, and such techniques were not easy to come by.  

Now that he had this movement technique, which could be practiced even at the Qi Refining stage, Qin Chong naturally wouldn’t let it slip by.  

Just as he was about to begin practicing the Phantom Shadow Dash, movement came from within his spirit beast pouch. Qin Chong immediately sent his spiritual sense inside to investigate.  

To his astonishment, the ant queen had begun devouring the corpses of the Flying Sky Ants.  

After killing the demonic cultivator, Qin Chong had lost nearly half of his Flying Sky Ants. The surviving ants had brought back the corpses of their fallen kin.  

Though Qin Chong had been slightly puzzled by this, he hadn’t dwelled on it. Now, seeing the ant queen consuming the corpses, he wondered—was the queen about to advance?  

Given Qin Chong’s current strength and means, whether the ant queen advanced or not was entirely up to her. There was little he could do to assist, so he could only wait and observe.  

Originally, Qin Chong had planned to recover his spiritual energy and return as quickly as possible. Yet another unexpected situation had arisen—though this time, it brought pleasant surprises.  

Qin Chong suddenly sensed signs of a breakthrough in his cultivation. Calculating the time, it had been over a year since his last breakthrough to the seventh layer of Qi Refining. This impending advancement was within expectations.  

He had initially expected to spend three years at the Cangwu Mine, but unforeseen circumstances had cut that short. Now, the final half-year of those three years would be spent on the journey back to Pingyang City.  

The unpredictability of life—who could foresee fortune or misfortune?  

Still, breaking through now wasn’t a bad thing. At the very least, with his improved cultivation, his flying speed would increase, allowing him to return sooner.  

After all, an important matter awaited him.  

---  

That matter was the once-in-a-decade disciple recruitment by the Azure Dragon Valley. Ever since Qin Chong had accidentally broken through to the fifth layer of Qi Refining in the stone chamber beneath the Flying Cloud Waterfall, he had been contemplating this opportunity.  

Previously, his cultivation had stagnated at the third layer of Qi Refining, making it impossible for him to qualify for the Azure Dragon Valley even if he had the desire.  

Born into a minor clan like the Qin family, his weak strength meant limited cultivation resources. It was said that to help his father successfully reach Foundation Establishment, the entire clan had spent over a decade pooling resources and connections to obtain a single Foundation Establishment Pill.  

Though the Qin family now had two Foundation Establishment cultivators, securing another Foundation Establishment Pill in the short term was nearly impossible.  

Without the pill, the chances of advancing to Foundation Establishment were slim.  

Joining the Azure Dragon Valley would at least increase his opportunities to obtain a Foundation Establishment Pill. Moreover, only within a major sect could he access skills like alchemy, artifact forging, formation crafting, and talisman-making. Mastering even one of these would greatly smooth his future cultivation path.  

For high-level cultivators, these skills were essential. The extent of their mastery, however, depended on their talent and fortune.  

It was akin to Qin Chong’s past life—if one wanted to advance quickly, joining a large corporation was the best strategy. After all, the resources and connections in a major company far surpassed those of a small one.  

Otherwise, why would so many clans in the vast Pingyang Prefecture willingly submit to the Azure Dragon Valley?  

After over ten days of cultivation, Qin Chong successfully broke through to the eighth layer of Qi Refining.  

Now, he felt his spiritual energy had grown significantly denser, and his spiritual sense had increased by about thirty percent. This made wielding high-grade magical tools even more effortless.  

After stabilizing his cultivation, Qin Chong emerged from his hiding spot and mounted the Black Profound Sword, heading toward Pingyang City.  

However, shortly after taking flight, he encountered two streaks of light speeding toward him. They closed the distance in an instant, leaving Qin Chong no time to evade.  

The two men appeared to be in their thirties, both at the ninth layer of Qi Refining. Their strength surprised Qin Chong slightly.  

"Fellow Daoist, please hold!"  

They called out to Qin Chong, but from their expressions, they didn’t seem hostile.  

"Greetings, fellow Daoists."  

The two exchanged glances before one spoke, "May we ask where you’ve come from and where you’re headed?"  

Such questions from strangers were inappropriate, but given their superior strength, Qin Chong suppressed his displeasure and replied, "I’ve come from Wutong City and am returning to Pingyang City."  

"I see. Have you encountered a demonic cultivator during your travels? One around the ninth layer of Qi Refining?"  

"A demonic cultivator? How could one appear within the borders of Song Country?" Qin Chong feigned shock, his expression turning grave.  

"To be frank, my fellow disciple and I are disciples of the Azure Feather Sect. We’re here to pursue a demonic cultivator who came from Jin Country to the east. We lost track of him recently, so we’ve been searching this area."  

"So you’re from the Azure Feather Sect! My apologies for the disrespect. I haven’t encountered any demonic cultivators. With my meager skills, I’d surely have fallen victim if I had."  

"In that case, we won’t trouble you further. Farewell!"  

With that, the two soared away toward Wutong City.  

Only after their figures vanished did Qin Chong resume his journey.  

The Azure Feather Sect was a major sect within Han Country, comparable in strength to the Azure Dragon Valley and the Azure Mystery Sect. Rumor had it that the Azure Feather Sect shared deep ties with the Azure Mystery Sect.  

Otherwise, how could two mere Qi Refining disciples dare to cross borders so casually?  

Though immortal sects didn’t guard their borders as strictly as mortal nations, they still fiercely protected their territories. Most rogue cultivators who crossed borders did so discreetly, avoiding attention.  

What surprised Qin Chong even more was that the demonic cultivator hailed from Jin Country, where demonic sects were said to exist. However, he knew little beyond that.  

After pondering briefly, Qin Chong set aside these thoughts and focused on returning to Pingyang City.  

Once he entered Pingyang Prefecture, he relaxed slightly. This was familiar territory, and as long as he avoided dangerous areas, major mishaps were unlikely.
