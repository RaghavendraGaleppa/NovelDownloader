# Chapter 84: The Three Methods—Superior, Middle, and Inferior!

A brilliant silver light descended, and before the crowd could react, a figure had already appeared on the jade meditation cushion at the center of the lecture hall.

It was a middle-aged Daoist dressed in white robes, adorned with a jade pendant at his waist and his hair tied up with a green hairpin. His refined features carried an air of serenity, yet his deep, unfathomable gaze swept lightly across the hall, causing everyone to bow their heads, not daring to meet his eyes.

A Foundation Establishment cultivator.

One who refined the qi of heaven and earth, forged his Dao foundation, and possessed mystical arts—a being who could live for four hundred and fifty years.

"Greetings, Elder!"  

Gu Yuan and the others bowed respectfully to the Daoist seated above.

This man was the overseer of the Hidden Dragon Academy, Xiang Ronghua, also known by his Daoist name, Huaguang. He hailed from humble origins.

"Rise, all of you."  

With a light flick of his sleeve, the Daoist's presence calmed their hearts, dispelling all restlessness and fear, allowing them to look upon him with ease.

"You are all disciples of the academy, seeking the Dao with sincerity. What is there to fear?"  

The Daoist chuckled softly, his demeanor warm and approachable.

The disciples felt comforted by his words.

"Today, I have little to say beyond sharing some insights into cultivation. Listen well..."  

Without further ado, the Daoist began his lecture.

In the path of cultivation, enlightenment and innate talent were of utmost importance.  

Whether it was contemplating true diagrams, breaking through bottlenecks, or refining magical seals, all required a deepening understanding of oneself, the world, and the Great Dao. Over time, confusion was inevitable.  

Now, as the Daoist spoke eloquently, his words were lofty yet simple, effortlessly illuminating the intricacies and wonders of cultivation.

Gu Yuan, listening intently, found himself greatly enlightened. He realized that his previous cultivation had been somewhat reckless—relying solely on resources and breakthroughs through magical fruits.  

In truth, the path of cultivation held many subtleties, and breakthroughs could be achieved with finesse.  

Had Gu Yuan known these methods earlier, he could have saved a hundred spirit stones.  

For a time, the lecture hall fell into deep silence, save for the Daoist's gentle voice, flowing like a murmuring stream.  

The seventy-two disciples outside the hall listened with rapt attention, afraid to miss a single word.  

These were invaluable insights that could save both spirit stones and precious cultivation time.  

Yet, the sixteen seated on the cushions inside—Gu Yuan among them—remained more composed.  

The Daoist’s teachings primarily concerned cultivation below the eighth layer of Qi Refining, which they had already surpassed. For them, this was merely a review, a chance to verify and deepen their understanding.  

The true lecture was yet to come.  

After an unknown length of time, the Daoist's voice finally ceased, and the hall fell silent once more.  

But moments later, his voice rose again—this time directed at the sixteen within the inner hall.  

"Today is a lecture on cultivation. If you have doubts, speak them freely."  

At these words, the disciples rejoiced inwardly, though none dared speak out of turn. Instead, they looked toward the foremost seat.  

Senior Brother Li cleared his throat and bowed to the Daoist before speaking.  

"Elder, this disciple has a question and seeks your guidance."  

"Speak."  

"This disciple has reached the ninth layer of Qi Refining and obtained a refining diagram from the Scripture Hall. Yet, I have been unable to grasp its essence. I humbly ask for your instruction!"  

The middle-aged Daoist's gaze sharpened as he studied Senior Brother Li, then sighed faintly.  

"The path of cultivation hinges on innate talent and enlightenment. Your inability to grasp it stems from insufficient comprehension, making the method elusive."  

"This barrier is the second major hurdle in cultivation—profound and difficult to articulate. I cannot guide you directly. At present, there are only two solutions."  

"Please enlighten me, Elder!"  

"First, seek a Golden Core elder to impart wisdom. Their lofty perspective may help you master the method."  

"Second, seek magical seals or treasures that enhance enlightenment. I observe that you already have some understanding of Qi Refining. With a slight boost, success may be within reach."  

"Where might I—"  

Overjoyed, Senior Brother Li wished to inquire further, but the Daoist had already flicked his sleeve, signaling the end of the discussion.  

Seeing this, Senior Brother Li subtly let a green jade slip from his sleeve.  

The jade shimmered with an innate luster, its natural patterns resembling a green carp swimming within, vivid and lifelike—utterly extraordinary.  

At this sight, Gu Yuan couldn't help but glance at Senior Brother Li in surprise.  

The Daoist's gaze also fell upon the jade.  

His expression remained impassive, yet a golden light suddenly appeared in Senior Brother Li's hand.  

Senior Brother Li's face lit up with delight as he tightly grasped the golden light and bowed deeply to the Daoist, saying no more.  

The exchange happened in an instant, almost imperceptible to others. Then, the Daoist shifted his gaze to Gu Yuan.  

"Do you have doubts?"  

Gu Yuan composed himself and bowed before speaking.  

"This disciple has reached the peak of the eighth layer of Qi Refining, yet the bottleneck feels like shackles, preventing advancement to the ninth layer. I seek your guidance, Elder!"  

The Daoist studied Gu Yuan briefly, seemingly surprised, but answered nonetheless.  

"This matter is both difficult and simple. I have three methods—superior, middle, and inferior. The choice is yours."  

"Please instruct me, Elder!"  

"The superior method: Seek a Body Seal to refine your innate talent. With superior aptitude, bottlenecks cease to exist."  

"The middle method: Dual cultivation or the use of exotic treasures—external aids to break the shackles."  

"The inferior method: Consume elixirs and cultivate relentlessly, grinding away at the barrier through sheer perseverance. The ninth layer is no insurmountable chasm. Though crude, this method remains viable."  

Having spoken, the Daoist flicked his sleeve once more, ending the discussion—just as he had with Senior Brother Li.  

Taking the hint, Gu Yuan subtly let an object slip from his sleeve—a piece of purple wood, vibrant in color and adorned with mystical natural patterns.  

Senior Brother Li turned in astonishment, eyeing Gu Yuan with surprise.  

But Gu Yuan paid him no mind, focusing instead on the Daoist.  

"Swish!"  

With a flick of his finger, the Daoist sent a golden jade talisman into Gu Yuan's hand.  

Relieved, Gu Yuan clenched his fist around it and stored it away, then fell silent, listening attentively once more.  

Soon, respectful inquiries arose from the cushions on the right.  

"This disciple recently encountered a deviation in cultivation, with meridians aching faintly..."  

"This disciple seeks a method to refine a magical seal..."  

One after another, questions filled the inner hall, each answered swiftly by the Daoist, who left no room for follow-up.  

When the last disciple had spoken, the middle-aged Daoist transformed into a streak of light and vanished in an instant, as though he had never been there.  

The inner hall erupted in murmurs—some disciples wore expressions of relief, while others sighed in frustration.  

Senior Brother Li, seated at the front, turned to Gu Yuan with an amused smile.  

"Who would have thought Junior Brother was also a man of taste?"  

"That Purple Jade Tranquil Incense was an excellent choice. Elder Xiang has a fondness for such refined items."  

Gu Yuan chuckled in return.  

"Merely the elder's grace. It pales in comparison to Senior Brother's Green Carp Jade."  

The two exchanged glances, their golden talismans in hand, and smiled knowingly.
