# Chapter 31: The Dead Who Still Lived  

The towns of Chuyun and Yangliu in Longxiang County were situated close to each other, connected by a direct road between their respective government offices. A fast horse could make the one-way journey in less than an hour.  

**Wilderness.**  

A gravel-covered stretch of land beside the official road leading out of Chuyun Town.  

Six escort carriages lay destroyed, their horses and drivers all dead.  

The setting sun cast its slanting rays, draping a golden glow over the scattered stones and remnants of snow.  

Xiao Ji and Song Yuanbao arrived at the crime scene, accompanied by Chuyun Town's constable, Chang Ping, and his men.  

The area was under guard, and an elderly coroner was examining the bodies.  

"This is the original crime scene," Chang Ping explained. "The day before yesterday, the Kaishan Escort Agency accepted a job from the Cui family—transporting medicinal herbs to Giant Dragon City. Not long after leaving town, the entire convoy was ambushed and slaughtered. The goods and silver were untouched..."  

"What's most bizarre is that the client, Cui Budu, was also brutally murdered in his private villa. The Kaishan Escort Agency was wiped out—only the chief escort, Han Kaishan, who was also the agency's owner, was barely saved. But he's hanging on by a thread, his cultivation crippled, and still unable to speak..."  

"If he could talk, he might reveal something." Song Yuanbao couldn't grasp the crux of the case, but he couldn't just stand there silently either, so he resorted to stating the obvious to show he wasn't just there to spectate.  

"Truly strange. In my twenty years of handling cases, I've never seen anything like this—both the client and the escort agency killed simultaneously, with no clues left at the scene," Chang Ping continued. "Our initial suspicions point in two directions. First, it could be about profit—bandits hiring an expert to send a message to other escort agencies, demanding tolls and compliance."  

"Second, it could be revenge. The Kaishan Escort Agency has made plenty of enemies over the years."  

Song Yuanbao's expression darkened. "This case is so bizarre—there must be something more to it."  

Xiao Ji instinctively took a step away from Song Yuanbao. *If only I didn’t know him...*  

*What an embarrassment to Yangliu Town. If you have nothing useful to say, just stay quiet.*  

As the group discussed the situation, they moved further into the crime scene.  

Xiao Ji examined the bodies, noting the clear sword wounds.  

Superficially, each victim bore distinct sword marks, suggesting the killer was a highly skilled swordsman.  

The assailant had been ruthlessly efficient—one strike, one life. Traces of lingering spiritual energy around the wounds indicated the perpetrator was a cultivator of the sword path.  

"The Kaishan Escort Agency is the best in Chuyun Town. The escorts and guards on this trip were their finest, even accompanied by an experienced medic. That shows how seriously they took this job. But we still don’t know what exactly they were transporting," Chang Ping added.  

---  

**Eighteen dead, six horses—all killed in a single strike. Sword wounds, gravel-blade technique... Poisoned an hour before death, then struck with chaotic spiritual energy that ruptured their heart meridians.**  

This was the surface-level information Xiao Ji perceived.  

"Trained in the blade, yet killed with a sword—clearly an inside job to divert suspicion."  

He intensified his perception, probing for deeper clues.  

He discovered that none of the victims had seen the killer's face before death—only a man in dark attire during broad daylight. The only discernible detail was that the perpetrator was a male cultivator.  

"Coroner Wang, any findings?"  

From Chang Ping's introduction, Song Yuanbao and the others learned that the coroner had just turned sixty a few days prior. He had already retired, but due to the severity of this case and the inexperience of younger coroners, he had taken it upon himself to assist.  

This line of work was far from easy—dealing with the dead day in and day out, steeped in yin energy. Coroners were usually called in for wrongful or violent deaths, where yang energy was scarce. Many in this profession died young.  

Reaching the age of sixty was a rare feat.  

"Time of death for all victims was around noon. They were poisoned, then struck with sword energy to the heart. The killer was ruthless—likely a cultivator at the seventh or eighth layer of Qi Refining. The method matches the deaths at the Kaishan Escort Agency and the Cui family." Coroner Wang relayed his findings after hours of investigation.  

Since the case began, he had visited all three crime scenes, examining each body.  

His conclusions largely aligned with Xiao Ji's, proving the coroner was indeed skilled.  

Yet the three locations—the wilderness ambush, the Kaishan Escort Agency headquarters, and Cui Budu's hidden villa—were too far apart for a single killer to strike simultaneously. Even a Nascent Soul expert couldn’t have orchestrated such precision.  

Chang Ping, the local constables, and even Song Yuanbao trusted Coroner Wang implicitly—he had never made a mistake in his career.  

If the case was this perplexing, it would likely end up as another unsolved mystery. The world had plenty of those—one more wouldn’t hurt.  

Xiao Ji, however, paid closer attention to such a remarkable individual.  

**[Coroner Wang Dajiu of Chuyun Town, retired. Lifespan: 59 years, 5 months, 3 days...]**  

This surface-level information puzzled Xiao Ji.  

"Constable Chang Ping mentioned earlier that this man had just celebrated his sixtieth birthday—officially entering his sixtieth year. So why does his true lifespan show less than sixty?"  

"If his lifespan was only 59 years, how did he live to 60?"  

"Did he lie about his age to retire early?"  

"That’s thinking too far ahead—there’s no such thing as retirement at sixty in this world."  

---  

**Deepening his perception.**  

**[Wang Dajiu was fated to die seven months ago. Unwilling to accept his short life, he sought out Han Kaishan, hoping the well-connected escort agency owner could find a solution.]**  

**[Out of gratitude for Wang Dajiu’s past assistance, Han Kaishan purchased a Heart-Prolonging Pill from a demonic cultivator, extending his life by one year.]**  

**[But Wang Dajiu wanted more. When he demanded additional pills, Han Kaishan struck a deal with him.]**  

**[Kill Cui Budu.]**  

**[Deep perception successful. Cultivation +3.]**  

The revelation that the coroner was one of the masterminds behind the massacre surprised Xiao Ji—yet it made perfect sense.  

Now, the retired coroner’s eagerness to examine the bodies wasn’t about justice for the dead, but about covering up the truth and ensuring the case remained unsolved.  

Since the Chuyun Town authorities trusted him implicitly, his word was law.  

This explained many of the case’s puzzling details.  

The case was complex, spanning three locations—the wilderness ambush, the Kaishan Escort Agency headquarters, and Cui Budu’s hidden villa.  

The core issue seemed to revolve around whatever the escort agency was transporting.  

Setting aside the stolen goods for now, the question was how the killer struck three locations simultaneously.  

Xiao Ji had already pieced it together.  

Coroner Wang Dajiu, indebted to Han Kaishan for extending his life, became his accomplice. Han Kaishan could thus kill the convoy in the wilderness, return to slaughter his own agency, while Wang Dajiu handled the Cui family.  

With Wang Dajiu personally overseeing the autopsies, Han Kaishan’s innocence would be assured. The blame could then be shifted to bandits, demonic cultivators, or any other scapegoat, allowing them to escape justice.  

Han Kaishan’s decision to annihilate his own agency must be tied to the cargo they were transporting.  

To confirm everything, Xiao Ji needed to visit the escort agency and Cui Budu’s villa, gathering evidence from all three scenes to crack the case.  

Without having met Han Kaishan yet, Xiao Ji couldn’t discern why the chief escort would destroy his own livelihood. Some answers required direct confrontation.  

But one thing was certain—whatever Han Kaishan gained must have outweighed what he sacrificed.  

"Let’s head to the Kaishan Escort Agency," Xiao Ji suggested. "Didn’t you say Han Kaishan is still alive? Let’s hear what he has to say."
