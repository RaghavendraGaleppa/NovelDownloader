**Chapter 52: Excising the Flesh!**

A hundred-zhang long sword qi collided with the Crimson Flame Divine Dragon, resulting in a thunderous explosion. A surging sea of fire and boundless gale-force winds engulfed the area before the dust could even settle.

*Clang!*

A metallic clang echoed from within the inferno and swirling winds. Zhang San's eyes were bloodshot, his body aflame, and wisps of steam rose from his head, making him appear utterly deranged. The long spear in his hand thrust out a thousand spear shadows, forming a magnificent yet deadly crimson flame spear-flower that enveloped Tian Ling.

Tian Ling's eyes remained clear. Her azure longsword seemed to have fused with her very being. A hundred-zhang long gale, instantly condensed and refined the moment it was unleashed, solidified into a physical substance, barely a zhang in length. After all, having grown up in a sect since childhood, her combat techniques were far superior to those of an unorthodox practitioner like Zhang San.

The zhang-tall gale-force sword qi, imbued with unmatched sharpness, slashed forth. The crimson flame spear-flower's fiery radiance surged, blooming like a rose. However, the gale-force sword qi pierced through its defense, splitting the spear-flower in two. The sword qi's momentum remained unchecked. Zhang San's pupils contracted. He horizontally gripped his long spear, and crimson flames flared a hundred zhang high around him.

*Clang!*

The sword qi struck the long spear, and Zhang San was sent repeatedly stumbling backward by the immense impact. His legs, like two crimson flame iron pillars, ploughed two charred grooves into the arena floor as he was pushed back for dozens of zhang before finally coming to a halt.

A commotion erupted in the spectator stands. After so many days of competition, they were all well aware of the strength of both participants in the arena. Tian Ling was merely at the Earth Treasury Realm, while Zhang San was at the Human Treasury Realm. Yet, from this exchange, Zhang San had clearly been forced into a disadvantage!

"Zhang San's strength was forcibly accumulated through medicine; he hasn't truly developed any divine abilities of the Earth or Human Realms!"

Inside Zhou Tian's room, Liu Yan sat on a chair, her red lips slightly parted. The golden divine flames in her eyes extinguished as she spoke indifferently. Being a Wind Flame Physique, a master of fire, she could discern that while Zhang San's crimson flames appeared overwhelmingly fierce, they were in fact merely superficial.

"He's currently fighting solely relying on his realm. Tian Ling, after all, hails from the Haotian Sect; her foundation is solid. If that's all he's got, defeat is only a matter of time," Zhou Zui chimed in. Their strength was immense, and their combat experience rich, allowing them to easily perceive the situation in the arena.

"Just watch," Zhou Xunchuan said, his thoughts clear. "It's not that simple. The people from Great Luo Academy aren't foolish enough to make such a blatant miscalculation. The situation is still far from clear!"

Zhou Tian listened quietly to their words, maintaining an expression that suggested he had everything under control. In truth, he was merely a mortal with no divine abilities. All he could see was the fierce gales and raging flames in the arena, nothing more.

In the arena, Zhang San sidestepped a gale, then thrust his spear forward. A ferocious crimson flood dragon, clawing and baring its fangs, erupted, sporting a single horn and wreathed in fiery rings, resembling a mobile furnace.

This strike was no ordinary one; even Tian Ling had to treat it with caution in her haste. Wind rose beneath her feet, and she swung her longsword.

*Chirp!*

A high-pitched cry sounded as an Azure Divine Bird, composed entirely of gale-force winds with exceptionally sharp feathers, soared out.

The divine bird and the flood dragon clashed, wind and fire opposing each other, utterly irreconcilable.

Taking advantage of this exchange, Zhang San created some distance and glanced at the cracks on his spear. There was a particularly deep fissure in the middle, caused by the very first sword qi unleashed by Tian Ling.

He casually tossed his long spear onto the ground, where it clanged against the arena floor with a crisp sound.

Flames ignited in his hand as he lightly grasped the void. An inconspicuous pattern on his wrist lit up, and crimson divine light converged, materializing a new long spear in his hand. The entire spear shaft glowed crimson, inscribed with profound runes from tip to end. The facets of the spearhead were surprisingly golden, indicating an extremely precious metal, so rare that the artificer who forged this Sacred Spear only used a tiny bit on its tip's edges.

"The battle has only just begun!" Zhang San declared. A bloodthirsty glint appeared in his eyes. Holding the long spear, he leaped forward. The Sacred Spear emitted dazzling fiery light, and wisps of golden flames emerged, twisting the very void around them. This was no ordinary flame; it was Li Fire.

The Li Fire extended from Zhang San's arm, spreading throughout his entire body. The flames covering him gradually turned golden. The crimson-gold flames slowly contracted, forming a set of crimson armor inscribed with golden patterns on his body. The amplification a Sacred Artifact provided to an individual was truly terrifying.

It was once said in Kyushu that a Sacred Artifact was more precious than ten Sages. While somewhat exaggerated, this statement nonetheless underscored the immense value of Sacred Artifacts!

A thousand-zhang long spear phantom appeared in mid-air, wreathed in golden flames. Even the runes on the spear's body were visible with startling clarity!

Tian Ling's delicate face was taut, and her beautiful eyes were filled with solemnity. Not daring to be careless, a golden light flashed, and a semi-transparent longsword appeared in her hand. Bolts of purple lightning crackled within its blade – it was precisely the Sacred Sword Zhou Ying had gifted her that day.

Clutching the Sacred Sword, an unimaginable aura burst forth from Tian Ling's petite body. A towering tornado emerged, with countless azure wind blades swirling within it. Streaks of purple lightning flashed through the vortex. This Lightning Windblade Tornado pierced through heaven and earth, causing the very world to change color.

The thousand-zhang golden flame spear phantom plunged into the Lightning Windblade Tornado!

*Rumble!*

The area erupted into chaos. Gale-force winds howled, a sea of lightning churned, golden flames soared sky-high, and the spear phantom struck fiercely. The space within the arena, formed by formations, seemed on the verge of being shattered, with chaotic energy surging.

The spear phantom dissipated, and the tornado vanished. The entire area transformed into a zone of devastation, where lightning, fire, and wind blades all manifested.

Tian Ling and Zhang San simultaneously charged into this ravaged zone. Spear shadows and gale-force sword qi laced with lightning power submerged the area.

*Clang! Clang!*

Dull thuds of impact continuously echoed.

*Crack!*

Tian Ling's Lightning Sacred Sword sliced through the crimson-gold armor on Zhang San's body, striking his right shoulder. It cut three-tenths of an inch deep into the bone, and blood, burning with fiery light, dripped down. Half of his body convulsed as lightning bolts surged wildly within the wound – this was the Sacred Sword's auxiliary damage. Zhang San's face showed pain, but even more, a crazed intensity.

His left palm, covered in golden flames, clamped down on the Sacred Sword embedded in his right shoulder. His right hand, wielding the Crimson Flame Sacred Spear, swept horizontally with unparalleled force.

Tian Ling's expression changed dramatically, her brows furrowed in alarm. She had never expected Zhang San to fight with such a suicidal, injury-for-injury tactic. No wonder he hadn't dodged just now, allowing her to wound him.

It was too late to dodge now. The Sacred Sword was temporarily held by Zhang San, and she couldn't pull it free in time. Streaks of wind shields composed of azure runes appeared around her waist. In her haste, this was the only defense she could muster!

The Sacred Spear, wreathed in golden Li Fire, arrived instantly. *Crack, crack, crack!* The sound of wind shields shattering echoed; they couldn't even withstand it for a moment.

*Bang!*

With a muffled thud, Tian Ling was sent flying, crashing onto the arena floor. Golden flames ignited at her waist. Her clothes where she was hit had ripped apart, revealing her fair skin. On her skin was a patch of burning golden flames. Unlike ordinary flames, this fire burning on her skin didn't char it; it simply burned there, quietly.

Tian Ling coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, her face flushed. Gazing at the flames on her waist, she raised her sword and brought it down, excising that piece of flesh. Blood gushed from the wound!
