# Chapter 55: Another Life

"All things carry the yin and embrace the yang, harmonizing by the surging qi – Cui Chonghe." Qin Ming mused, then used tea to write "Qin Ming" on the table.

In that vague and fragmented memory, Cui Chonghe was his name.

"Why am I stranded here, remembering my name as Qin Ming?" He stared at the words on the table. Which memory was real, and which was false? When he was in rags, covered in blood, and utterly down on his luck, he had always remembered himself as Qin Ming. But why was he now gradually recalling another, hazy life?

Qin Ming pondered, taking a deep breath. The flowing rainbow mist from the three-colored flower carried a rich fragrance. As these vague memories flickered, the strong aroma made the scene feel even more familiar.

Soon, a past scene surfaced in his mind: a group of people, all in luxurious silken robes and adorned with beautiful jades, watching with concern a youth whose face was still somewhat childish. On the jade table before the youth lay a three-colored flower and a jar of vitality-rich medicinal liquid.

Qin Ming mused, "Who are these people? Who is that youth?" They all looked somewhat familiar, yet he couldn't recall. Initially, after awakening in this remote place, he first remembered himself as Qin Ming. Later, with each rebirth, he recalled the silk scroll and his grandfather.

"I was also there, but from a distance, quietly watching the youth consume the three-colored flower and the vitality-rich medicinal liquid." Qin Ming watched those scenes. The men, women, young, and old around the youth all seemed deeply concerned about him. Those people were clearly of no ordinary status. Some women had unique hair ornaments, like plumes of flowing purple mist, or a cluster of vibrant, dewy peach blossoms wreathed in red light.

"That youth seemed only thirteen or fourteen. He hadn't reached the golden age, nor had he taken the Titan God path. How dared he undergo rebirth so early? And to have reached this level?" Qin Ming wondered, "Is this the true power of a top-tier clan? To be able to do what ordinary people cannot?" He looked down at the foot-tall three-colored flower in the jade box. Nurtured by Heavenly Light, it was already a peerless item. The one the other party had was no less impressive; its quality was surprisingly similar.

Qin Ming took out the three-colored flower from the jade box and plucked its crystalline petals one by one, bringing them to his mouth. As expected, this mysterious product, harvested from a special node, contained Heavenly Light essence. The moment it entered his mouth, he felt a burning sensation, like being consumed by flames. Though Qin Ming felt pain, he found it bearable. Soon, his abdomen also burned, and intense Heavenly Light surged within him, seemingly intent on destroying his physical body.

He remained calm, continuing to pluck petals, put them in his mouth, and consume them. Qin Ming glowed entirely, a result of the Heavenly Lights colliding: one, the transcendent Heavenly Light that pierced the night sky and fell upon spirit mountains; the other, the innate Heavenly Light born within the human body.

"It really hurts," he murmured, not stopping. After eating the entire three-colored flower, he chewed and swallowed its leaves, roots, and other parts. In an instant, the two Heavenly Lights within Qin Ming seemed about to explode, but his flesh and blood were incredibly resilient, suppressing the violent surge. Aside from waves of burning pain, it did not truly harm his vital essence. In his abdomen, the two Heavenly Lights intertwined, constantly rotating, chasing each other, forming a circle, and finally merging into a single, primordial whole.

With a *boom*, the two Heavenly Lights within him completely merged, then burst forth violently, rushing through his limbs and bones, purifying his entire body anew. Qin Ming's total Heavenly Light increased, expanding rapidly. This stimulated his flesh, blood, essence, qi, and spirit. In his sea of consciousness, it was as if a bolt of lightning bloomed, illuminating his body, while his five viscera, six bowels, and limbs also responded in kind, and then his entire body began to emit new Heavenly Light.

Qin Ming went into the courtyard and consecutively displayed several types of Heavenly Light Qi, which almost erupted from his body, making him significantly stronger than before.

"Merge!" He stood there, condensing several Heavenly Light Qis.

At the same time, more scenes flickered before Qin Ming's eyes. He saw the youth again, as well as the men and women in luxurious robes. "Excellent! Chongxuan, after three rebirths, has actually fused four types of Heavenly Light Qi! Truly remarkable!" An old man of high status, with a youthful complexion and hair white as crane feathers, praised him, even he was full of admiration.

A palace-dressed woman who appeared to be in her early thirties, with her cloud-like hair elegantly piled high and a golden, flowing plume as a hairpin, nodded and said, "Although each type of Heavenly Light Qi seems rather ordinary, this is the initial stage of ascending to the clouds. With just these four fused, one can already begin to turn decay into wonder."

The youth was named Cui Chongxuan, his name still chosen from the scriptures of the 'Outsiders'. He was drenched in sweat, trembling slightly, but he had indeed endured and successfully fused four types of Heavenly Light Qi. The old man said, "Although you haven't stepped onto the Outsider path, after three rebirths, you've shown such astonishing performance on this road. If this were to spread, it would surely cause a great stir. Very good!"

A majestic middle-aged man also spoke, "Who can say this path cannot lead to the highest peak? I have already found the priceless secret scripture, the 'Six Imperial Heart Sutra,' for you. Do not disappoint our expectations."

Qin Ming watched quietly. At that time, he should have been an observer, far outside the crowd.

He withdrew his thoughts. Why did it feel like he had gained a false life? Was he Qin Ming, or Cui Chonghe? For some reason, he always felt that the life of Cui Chonghe was very illusory. Otherwise, he wouldn't have completely forgotten it at one point, nor would it be less vivid than his memories from childhood ignorance.

At this moment, Qin Ming had already integrated all his Heavenly Light Qi into one, feeling better than ever before. The Heavenly Light within his body had surged by a significant margin. With such abundant Heavenly Light nourishing his body and spirit, perhaps he wouldn't even need to seek spiritual substances for his next rebirth, allowing him to directly undergo rebirth and elevate his life level.

"Is fusing four types of Heavenly Light Qi during the third rebirth stage really that impressive?" Qin Ming muttered to himself, unimpressed. He had fused five types of Heavenly Light Qi, and furthermore, his 'Intercepting Qi' and 'Radiance Qi' were no longer single techniques. Qin Ming stopped overthinking. He believed that he would soon know about those past events. Many vague scenes were becoming increasingly clear, and perhaps another rebirth would reveal everything to him.

He tested his strength on the stone mill again. Without using his fingers, just by channeling Heavenly Light Qi through the back of his hand, he could effortlessly tear off and stick palm-sized rough stone pieces. "My apologies, old mill." For the past two days, although he had been suppressing his strength, the millstone was still riddled with pits and dents because of him.

"I seem to be really strong now," Qin Ming muttered to himself. But soon, he splashed cold water on himself. Just before the shallow night arrived, he had experienced a perilous situation: the Outsiders could fly, turn into mist, and become invisible. If not for the Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade this time, he would have been in grave danger!

"I've already started fusing various Heavenly Light Qis according to the previous generations' guidance, but can the methods on the silk scroll deal with Outsiders?" Qin Ming wasn't sure, but he had no choice now; he could only continue to grow stronger.

Liu Laotou only returned when the shallow night was about to end. Since he had spent fifteen day-gold coins, he would definitely not leave early. He had scrounged a meal from Old Wu there and stayed until the night deepened.

"Where in the great mountains are there spiritual substances that allow for a fourth rebirth?" Qin Ming asked casually.

Liu Laotou quickly waved his hand, saying, "Creatures that have undergone four mutations cannot be easily touched. They all have backgrounds and are registered by the higher-level anomalies in the great mountains. Killing them would attract their attention."

Qin Ming immediately understood. It seemed he really should leave this place.

In the mountains, near the Great Rift Valley, two great bandits frowned deeply. The young man hadn't returned. Had something happened to him? They felt uneasy. After all, if what that mist-transforming Outsider did were to be exposed, even they would be implicated. They had already released a raptor to deliver a message, seeking instructions from their elder. Finally, as the night grew deep, the raptor returned, and the two received a reply.

One bandit unfolded the letter, saying, "The elder said to wait one more day. If he still hasn't appeared by tomorrow, then don't bother with it; act as if nothing happened."

The other bandit asked, "We suspect he's imitating the Mountain Beasts' Mourning Grave ritual, offering sacrifices here. Did the old man respond to this?"

His companion nodded, saying, "The elder said he might be an Outsider Beast."

"Wasn't he an Outsider Human? How did he become a beast?"

The two great bandits huddled together, carefully reading the reply. First surprised, then they nodded in understanding. Some people enter deep mountains and vast swamps, near forbidden lands, and transform into anomalies. Naturally, there are also beasts that choose to enter great cities, to experience the prosperity and brilliance of the human world; even becoming a city lord in the end is not impossible. There are even anomalies that transcend the mundane world, becoming Outsider Beasts. All of this is normal. According to that elder, nothing is impossible in this world. The elder reassured the two that the mist-transforming young man, whether he was an Outsider Beast or not, would not succeed in his ritual, because that grave mound had long since sunken into the depths of Black-White Mountain. Let him kowtow as he pleased; there was no need to pay him any mind.

The next day, the two great bandits of Golden Rooster Ridge departed with their men. Before leaving, two Golden Rooster Knights personally visited the nearby villages, informing the people that each household must surrender one night-silver coin, which they would collect mid-month.

"As expected, these bandits want us to pay up," an old man couldn't help but mutter angrily. In fact, people had long had a premonition. When Golden Rooster Ridge forcefully conscripted new recruits, the villagers had already guessed that having suffered heavy losses this time, they would certainly find ways to replenish their strength, eventually making the nearby villages support them. However, this winter, the villagers outside the mountain were already having a very difficult time. Now, this provoked widespread indignation, almost leading them to directly fight for their lives.

Qin Ming heard the commotion outside. He felt it was time to make arrangements for the people and matters around him, because he had reached his limit and was preparing to make a move against Golden Rooster Ridge!
