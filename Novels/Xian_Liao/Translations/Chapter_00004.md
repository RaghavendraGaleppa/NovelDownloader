# Chapter 4: Tiger Play

After seeing off Butcher Hu, Zhou Qing waited a while longer. When no one else came knocking, he unwrapped the lotus-leaf bundle of pastries and began chewing them slowly with plain water.

The environment in the slum alley wasn't ideal. Even in the fresh morning air, there lingered faint traces of foul odors. The boiled water tasted slightly bitter, and his firewood supply was running dangerously low.

If his teaching position at Hu Village's school worked out, it would indeed solve his immediate problems. He could finish classes by noon and gather some firewood on the way back. The official exam results would be posted within ten to fifteen days. The wine Butcher Hu brought could be traded for grain, while the cured meat would be kept for his own consumption.

Zhou Qing felt somewhat settled now. Though Butcher Hu's sudden visit had surprised him, he guessed it might be related to yesterday's examination hall incident spreading through gossip. Butcher Hu was shrewd—bringing cured meat at this time made perfect sense. Moreover, the grain payment would come around the tenth day, coinciding with the exam results. If he passed as a xiucai (scholar), at least the teaching position would be secure. With luck, he might even qualify as a stipendiary scholar receiving imperial provisions.

In any case, a xiucai under fifteen would never worry about food or clothing. But...

Zhou Qing thought of his Health Sutra, his out-of-body experience, his remaining thirty-year lifespan... His ambitions extended far beyond mere social advancement. Having survived his first night in this ancient world after the exams, much of his confusion had cleared.

After finishing the pastries and filling his stomach, Zhou Qing decided to write at the table to aid digestion since he couldn't sleep anyway. He wrote:

"The length of life is predetermined; wealth and honor come from heaven. Only the virtuous remain content in poverty; the enlightened accept their fate."

This passage from Elementary Learning served as a reminder—having grand goals was good, but maintaining patience and progressing step by step was key. His shortened lifespan made him anxious, but haste bred mistakes. At least until his xiucai status was confirmed, he couldn't afford missteps.

Once calmer and his food digested sufficiently to avoid stomach discomfort, Zhou Qing resumed practicing Five Animals Play. Derived from Zhuangzi's Two Animals Play (Bear and Bird), these two forms remained the most challenging for him, especially given his current physical limitations.

After one complete set, Zhou Qing analyzed: "The Bear Play demands more strength, while Bird Play involves complex movements. My body simply can't execute Bird Play's techniques properly yet."

After contemplation, Zhou Qing decided to focus on the eight Tiger Play forms. Tiger Play offered dual benefits—training power generation while mimicking a tiger's movements to strengthen the body. Mastering Tiger Play would make Deer Play easier later, and proficiency in both would naturally lead to grasping Bear Play's essence.

Unlike ancients who rarely saw tigers, Zhou Qing had visited zoos multiple times in his modern upbringing. Memories of zoo tigers and online wildlife footage merged in his mind—the captive tigers' tangible presence blending with wild tigers' untamed spirit from videos. Gradually, Zhou Qing felt himself becoming a tiger, his body unconsciously mimicking feline movements as he practiced.

"Limbs grounded, three forward springs, two backward springs, stretching the waist, sideways kick skyward, then return prowling..." The Tiger Play mantra echoed in his mind like background music.

Completing the set, Zhou Qing exhaled softly, almost hearing a tiger's growl. Drenched in sweat, he felt remarkably lighter and ravenously hungry. After a quick wipe-down (proper baths being impossible in his circumstances), he cooked some cured meat with his dwindling rice supply.

The aromas inevitably drew neighbors' gossip—meat was rare even in town, let alone fragrant cured meat. But Zhou Qing's recent exam participation and previous scholarly demeanor deterred outright moochers, as did Butcher Hu's intimidating reputation after his visit.

The rest of the day passed undisturbed. Zhou Qing devoted himself to Tiger Play and eating before collapsing exhausted yet fulfilled into his musty bedding. He dreamed of being a tiger patrolling its domain, all beasts submitting, while warmth spread through his limbs like soaking in hot water—a blissful dream.

Waking before dawn, Zhou Qing felt no post-exercise soreness—partly due to youthful recovery, partly from that strange warmth in his dream, likely the Health Sutra's influence. His memory had become extraordinarily sharp, recalling dreams with perfect clarity.

Inspecting the Health Sutra again, he found new annotations: Five Animals Play (Basic) with a subcategory—Tiger Play (Proficient). This miraculous scripture precisely assessed his progress, fueling his motivation with visible improvement.

Having eaten all remaining cured meat with rice (a quantity that would last ordinary families months), Zhou Qing considered selling his house—something his original self would never contemplate. But the funds could secure better accommodations and food, allowing dedicated study of the Health Sutra and Five Animals Play.

Ten more days. With xiucai status, selling or renting would be smoother. Zhou Qing counted himself lucky—transmigrating just as he seized a life-changing opportunity. Passing the exams was imperative, though he worried submitting first might have seemed overeager. Still, the examiner had seemed favorably impressed.

Idleness bred overthinking. Zhou Qing refocused on Five Animals Play, first completing a full set to gauge overall progress before concentrating on Tiger Play. His tiger dream lent an uncanny realism—he truly felt like a stalking predator, though the cramped quarters stifled this energy. 

"Like a tiger crouching on barren hills, biding time with hidden claws," Zhou Qing recited internally, suppressing restless impulses lest they erupt into disruptive roars. This wasn't some enlightenment moment—no need to draw attention.

After practice, resting, he again sensed that peculiar warmth circulating through his limbs. A hot bath would be ideal, but poverty denied such luxuries. Even fantasies of maids drawing baths felt indulgent—comfort bred desire.

At dawn's light, Zhou Qing sighed and splashed his face with water from the jar. His reflection showed lingering gauntness from the soul projection, but retained handsomeness comparable to his original world self, with youthful delicacy. Yet the unfamiliar face still unsettled him—especially the tiger-like sharpness in his eyes, as if a sickly tiger stared back.

He averted his gaze, wary of triggering another soul projection without restorative chicken soup or cured meat. The thought accelerated his heartbeat—fear and longing intertwined, representing mysteries beyond mortal ken, but not to be recklessly pursued.

Knocking interrupted his thoughts. Butcher Hu had returned, noticing subtle changes in Zhou Qing but restraining curiosity. Real transformation would come in ten days—rumors suggested Zhou Qing's xiucai status was virtually certain. A scholar under fifteen was noteworthy even regionally, especially in Jiangzhou's mediocre academic record of late.

Butcher Hu envisioned Zhou Qing as a potential son-in-law—even failing higher exams, a clerk or advisor position would establish his family in the bureaucracy. For a butcher, such official connections meant stability and respectability.

Following their arrangement, Zhou Qing carried his book box to Hu Village with Butcher Hu, who then left to purchase pigs. Hu Village's tightly-knit clan respected education, their school surprisingly well-built with separate halls for Confucian worship and teacher's quarters. Zhou Qing learned they even had a martial arts instructor—a retired soldier who could reportedly defeat multiple men.

As students filed in and bowed, Zhou Qing began his first lesson: "Heaven and earth, dark and yellow; the universe, vast and wild..." The teaching method was timeless—recitation followed by memorization tests revealing individual progress. Zhou Qing resolved to teach properly while he held the position.
