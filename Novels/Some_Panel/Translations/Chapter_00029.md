# Chapter 29: Out, Big Gains

Yang Ji smiled at this.

But this wasn't enough. He immediately flew over the magma pool, swinging his sword to cleave away ninety percent of the remaining fire crystal stones, leaving only one that he didn't take – the one where the Flame Tree was rooted. Yang Ji didn't want to completely cut off its roots. He left one fire crystal stone to absorb the magma's energy, allowing the Flame Tree to survive. Decades or even a century later, it could bear fruit again. Similarly, leaving this fire crystal stone was also to let it continue absorbing the magma's power to grow. Perhaps in a thousand years, a new cluster of fire crystals would form here, once again giving birth to an Earth Spirit Flame.

Retrieving his wandering thoughts, Yang Ji began to try and manipulate the power of the Earth Spirit Flame, but it initially resisted. Perhaps it was because the fire essence energy that enveloped it had been refined by his cultivation technique and bore the imprint of Yang Ji's aura. After several attempts, the Earth Spirit Flame gradually transformed from initial resistance to obedience. Eventually, it accepted Yang Ji's aura. Yang Ji could feel a sense of kinship emanating from the flame, which filled him with joy. He had originally thought he would need to slowly refine it after taking it into his body, but it seemed that wasn't necessary. Because now, with a flick of his finger, a wisp of Earth Spirit Flame sprang from his fingertip, burning fiercely yet not harming him in the slightest. Since the fire essence embryo encasing it had been refined by his cultivation technique and bore Yang Ji's aura, it now regarded Yang Ji's physical body as its nurturing mother and its residing haven. Thus, there was no intent to harm whatsoever.

Although the flame was gentle, Yang Ji could sense the terrifying high temperature within, which was many times stronger than Earth Fire. Spirit Flame truly lived up to its name; it seemed to contain a trace of sentience. Yang Ji could perceive some of its instinctive will. No wonder the books said that some terrifying Heaven and Earth Spirit Flames could develop consciousness, and even cultivate to immortality like humans, becoming Fire Lords. It seemed to be true.

"This Earth Spirit Flame's spiritual energy is very strong, but its sentience seems to have just emerged, only a trace, like a one-year-old child. If it absorbs enough fire essence energy in the future, it might truly develop self-awareness and even speak," Yang Ji thought to himself. Indeed, if flowers, plants, and trees could become spirits, why couldn't a Spirit Flame born from absorbing Heaven and Earth essence? In this cultivation world, everything has its destined karma and path to immortality. All things in the world are fair; they all have their own Dao.

Above the Flowing Flame Sea.

Chang Lin and Chen De burst out of the water with a roar, landing on the large ship. At this moment, Chang Lin was beaming, looking utterly content. Seeing his joy, Chen De respectfully smiled and said, "Senior, congratulations on capturing the Blazing Sun Beast and obtaining its Blazing Sun Beast Flame."

"Haha, you guessed right this time. There truly was a demonic beast down there that had nurtured a beast flame. This trip certainly wasn't in vain." Chang Lin laughed heartily, "With this Blazing Sun Beast Flame, my nephew's alchemy skills can advance even further."

"Young Master Chang Yuan's alchemy talent already far surpasses ordinary people. Now with this beast flame, it's like adding wings to a tiger; I imagine he'll soon become an alchemy grandmaster," Chen De flattered with a smile.

"Indeed, indeed!" Chang Lin also smiled in agreement.

"Senior, should we go down and meet them?" As if remembering something, Chen De looked at the Flowing Flame Sea and asked.

"Life and death are fated! Whether they can come up alive depends on their own fortune." Chang Lin shook his head indifferently, then turned and walked into the ship's cabin. Chen De glanced, his expression unchanged, and also turned and walked into the cabin. The two piloted the large ship, and soon disappeared into the deep blue horizon.

Below.

Yang Ji, having subdued the Earth Spirit Flame, felt his entire body relax. Completing such a significant task indeed filled him with a sense of accomplishment. But when he collected his thoughts and looked outside the nest, he immediately froze. He only saw an information prompt about a single leg—that leg had rapidly stepped into a water-traveling boat, and that leg had escaped with the boat. Looking under the mountain fire, there was no one left. In other words, the owner of that leg was the last person to slip away besides him. This stunned him.

Everyone ran away? So fast? They were still fiercely resisting just now, how did they all suddenly vanish without a trace? As Yang Ji stared dumbfounded, his brows furrowed deeply. Everyone had run. Could he, alone, escape safely with only eight remaining Blazing Tiger Talismans in his hand? He shook his head. Although the Flame Snakes dared not enter, in his information perception, all of them, having lost their targets, had gathered around, blocking the various passages about a li away, glaring menacingly at this nest.

Yang Ji secretly peeked out, and a Flame King Snake, as thick as a water bucket, immediately opened its tearing maw, revealing sharp fangs covered in mucus, and roared ferociously at him. Its pair of crimson eyes were filled with infinite ferocity, and its steel-like snake tail slammed against the passage with resounding thuds, displaying its vicious intent.

This fellow! Yang Ji's face darkened. He quickly withdrew his head after a glance, truly fearing that his physical body would ignite their viciousness and appetite. If that happened, he'd be in trouble.

His expression was now fluctuating between gloom and uncertainty. Advancing was impossible; at a glance, more than a dozen Flame King Snakes were lurking outside. Retreating was also out of the question. Frowning, Yang Ji simply swept his storage bag, took out the remaining fire crystal stones, and prepared to refine them all to strengthen the Earth Spirit Flame's nest.

Time slowly passed. Two incense sticks later. All the fire crystal stones had been completely refined by him. The nurturing embryo formed by the fire essence energy became stronger, resembling a small villa the size of a millstone. The Earth Spirit Flame resided within it, truly comfortable.

Two incense sticks had passed, but the Flame Snakes outside showed no intention of retreating. This gave Yang Ji a severe headache. Frowning, he decided to just outlast them, which, of course, was his only option.

During this idle time, Yang Ji, with a flick of his finger, summoned the Earth Spirit Flame, preparing to study its properties and power. It was at this moment that the Flame Snakes outside trembled, and the message [Fear!] appeared above their heads.

Huh? They're afraid of the Earth Spirit Flame? Yang Ji instantly caught their emotional fluctuations. Looking at the spirit flame on his fingertip, his expression suddenly became strange. To verify his conjecture, he slowly walked to the nest's entrance, summoned all the Earth Spirit Flame, and held it burning fiercely in his palm. It was at this moment, after the Flame Snakes outside saw this ball of flame, that the message [Submission!] once again appeared above their heads. They weren't afraid, but worshipping the Earth Spirit Flame?

Yang Ji's expression solidified. He looked again and saw the Flame King Snakes trembling as they lowered their heads, with [Serpent Lord!] appearing above them.

Serpent Lord? Yang Ji was startled, then quickly guessed: "These Flame Snakes were born in the magma and grew by absorbing the magma's energy. And this Spirit Flame was nourished by fire crystals condensed from the magma's essence. Although they come from the same source, the energy contained within the Spirit Flame is far more advanced than theirs. Is that why it's considered their Serpent Lord?"

As he thought this, Yang Ji looked at the Earth Spirit Flame, then at the trembling Flame Snakes prostrating on the ground, not daring to lift their heads. An audacious idea sprouted in his mind. Taking a deep breath, he rose into the air, holding the Earth Spirit Flame, and slowly flew outwards. As he flew over the head of a Flame King Snake, his heart pounded, and the Blazing Tiger Talisman in his hand was crumpled from his tight grip. One, two, three—he flew past an entire passage, and not a single Flame Snake dared to rise.

Yang Ji was now incredibly excited. After flying several li at high speed, the exit was already in sight. He immediately withdrew the Earth Spirit Flame, quickly took out his water-traveling boat, and rushed towards the barrier. After hearing the splash of entering water, Yang Ji knew he had escaped.

This time, his gains were truly immense. Not to mention the Earth Spirit Flame, just the five Flame Fruits alone were enough to allow him to break through to Qi Condensation Eighth Layer. Additionally, he obtained some materials and demonic cores from the Flame Snakes. Although this trip was perilous, he truly made a huge profit.
