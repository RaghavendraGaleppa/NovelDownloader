# Chapter 642: The Entry Point

In the lee of an icy slope dozens of miles from the epicenter of the divine battle, an adventuring party of five humans struggled onward.

They wore thick fur-lined coats and armor, carrying packs and weapons, their faces etched with the weathered look of long-term wilderness expeditions.

Leading them was a middle-aged man with a broken eyebrow and a scarred face, gripping a two-handed greatsword. He suddenly stopped, his expression one of horror as he looked toward the Ice Rift Canyon.

"Heavens... Heavens above! What is that?!"

A young warrior in the party pointed into the distance, his voice distorted by terror.

From the direction of the canyon, the snow and wind were being parted by an invisible force. The thick, leaden clouds in the sky were being torn open by violent energy, creating a massive void.

A colossal golden figure with three heads and six arms, its body wreathed in terrifying purple-gold lightning, was locked in a fierce battle with a pure white wolf the size of a mountain peak.

The roar of thunder and the lament of the frozen plains intertwined. Even from a dozen miles away, the pressure, akin to the might of heaven and earth, hammered against everyone's hearts like a tangible sledgehammer.

Every clash of fist and claw, every flash of lightning, was accompanied by violent tremors in the earth and the rumbling crash of distant ice mountains collapsing.

Stray lightning serpents and fragments of frozen divine power occasionally splashed near them like meteors, blasting deep craters into the frozen earth and instantly freezing entire areas.

"It's a deity! Two deities are fighting! This is a divine war!"

The old mage in the party turned deathly pale, his staff trembling. He could sense the maelstrom of elements in the air, a violence beyond mortal comprehension, and the fluctuations of laws far exceeding human understanding.

"That should be the Tundra Wolf God, Rokan, of the Frigid North Plains, and the God of Thunder, Tatos. How could they be fighting here?!"

The scar-faced captain's voice was hoarse, his eyes filled with disbelief and terror.

As adventurers making a living in the Frigid North Plains, they were intimately familiar with the legends of the deities in this area. The Frigid North Plains bordered a human empire.

"Captain, let's get out of here! If we stay any longer, we'll be annihilated by the shockwaves!"

The young warrior was on the verge of tears, the premonition of death so clear it was terrifying. It wasn't that he feared death; as an adventurer, living on the edge of life and death was a daily affair. But facing a divine war, for a mortal to enter the fray was simply suicide.

"Yes, go! Go now! Run in the opposite direction, away from this area! Don't look back!"

The scar-faced captain made a swift decision, forcibly suppressing the shock and reluctance in his heart. Seeing a divine battle was the stuff of legends, and as an adventurer, he naturally hoped to explore all kinds of tales. This was a true divine miracle, a rare sight for any mortal. But survival was more important. He roared the order for his party to turn and flee.

Like startled rabbits, the five of them burst forth with the fastest speed of their lives, scrambling and tumbling as they fled for their lives away from the canyon, daring not to cast another glance at the divine battlefield that shattered their understanding of the world.

Xu Yunfan's divine sense naturally detected that insignificant adventuring party, but his mind was not on them, nor did he pay them any heed. His battle with Rokan was more of a test and a drill.

After a few exchanges, he had completely grasped the wolf god's true nature. His power was wild and violent, his ice divine arts were wielded with great skill, his close-combat was fierce, and his fighting instincts were exceptionally strong.

However, before the pure power refined by the Divine霄 True Scripture, the techniques honed by his Martial Dao Manifestation, and the battle instincts optimized to the extreme by his attribute panel, Rokan's strength, at the peak of the mid Foundation Establishment realm, was still not enough.

According to Aetella's power system, this tundra wolf god was at the peak of a mid-tier deity. This change in divine authority was likely seen by the other party as an opportunity for ascension. But if Xu Yunfan, as the ruler of the Frigid North Plains, were洛克曼 (Lockman), he would never have allowed such a thing to happen.

Unfortunately, when Xu Yunfan's mind connected with洛克曼 (Lockman), the latter expressed that he had no such intention.

How truly virtuous!

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh with emotion. In the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm, if anyone dared to seek the Golden Core Dao Fruit, Golden Core True Lords would immediately strike from the shadows. The path to advancement in the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm was tightly controlled by those True Lords. So far, for thousands of years, only the Pure Yang True Lord had successfully achieved the Dao Fruit.

"Tatos, you were hiding your strength?!"

Rokan was both shocked and enraged. His proud claws, tearing at the opponent's arm covered in thunder-patterned golden armor, left only a few faint white scratches. Yet, the opponent's thunder-heavy fists could easily shatter his ice armor, making his blood and energy churn. He felt as if he had fallen into an invisible net, the more he struggled, the tighter the束缚 (restraint).

Xu Yunfan's expression was indifferent.

"Hiding my strength? To deal with you, why would I need to hide my strength?"

Before the words had fully faded, the eyes on his main head glinted with a fierce light, and the power he had been holding back suddenly surged.

The two golden-armored arms on his front, which were directly blocking the giant claws, suddenly exerted force, the 'Strife' Mantra and the North Pole Purple Weir Suppressing Evil Profound Qi instantly augmenting him. His power increased several times over in an instant.

*Crack!*

*Bang!*

A grating sound of bone fracturing echoed.

Rokan's descending giant claw was forcibly snapped backward.

Simultaneously, Xu Yunfan's other arm formed a seal like lightning and shot out. The Purple Thunder Seal slammed viciously into Rokan's side.

*Pfft!*

Rokan's massive body, as if struck by a primordial giant elephant, was violently sent flying backward. His ice-crystal-like fur shattered and flew everywhere, his sturdy ribs visibly caved in. A large mouthful of divine blood, mixed with ice shards, gushed out, only to be evaporated into a blood mist by the lightning in mid-air.

His colossal body crashed heavily onto the distant frozen plains, plowing out a deep trench. The fluctuations of his divine power instantly withered, his eyes filled with horror and disbelief.

Xu Yunfan did not pursue the attack. His Manifestation stood its ground, the lightning around it converging as he looked down at the struggling giant wolf, his tone icy.

"Scram! For Buthus's sake, I'll spare your life. If you dare set foot in my territory again, I will shatter your divine authority and extinguish your soul."

In the Frigid North Plains, there were three high-tier deities: Lockman, who rules the Eternal Frozen Court; the God of Fierce Winds, Buthus; and the Goddess of Ice and Snow, Anja.

This wolf was under the command of the God of Fierce Winds, Buthus.

Using this as an entry point to instigate a conflict between divine systems was perfectly reasonable. Wouldn't it be perfect to then draw the other divine systems into the fray?

As Xu Yunfan pondered this internally, Rokan struggled to his feet. The searing pain in his chest and the turmoil of his divine power made it almost impossible for him to maintain his giant form. He stared venomously at the three-headed, six-armed golden-armored figure in the canyon, his eyes filled with humiliation and rage, along with a hint of deeply hidden shock.

He couldn't understand how Tatos's power could have become so terrifying in such a short time. His proud close-combat skills had been utterly worthless before his opponent.

A low, rumbling growl, filled with endless hatred, was squeezed from the depths of his throat. Rokan said no more threatening words, but his eyes said it all.

*I will be back!*
