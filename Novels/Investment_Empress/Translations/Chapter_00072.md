## Chapter 72: The Nine Peaks Grand Competition Begins, Old Xiao's First Battle

The heavens smiled upon them; today was a sunny day. Below Qingyuan Main Peak, various convoys streamed in, a magnificent torrent flowing into the sea. Deacons were everywhere, maintaining order. It was a grand spectacle, showcasing Qingyuan Sect's prestige as the foremost of Purple Sun Prefecture's three major sects.

"So lively?" Li Mo lifted the carriage curtain, surveying the scene outside. He had only ventured down the mountain once for a mission, hardly a true foray into the Jianghu.

Old Ba, driving the carriage, chuckled, "Our Qingyuan Sect's Nine Peaks Grand Competition is a stage for the next generation of our sect to display their strength. Naturally, smaller sects from the vicinity, as well as the other two major sects, will send people to observe the ceremony."

"I see." Li Mo nodded, now understanding the reasons for the Grand Competition's bustle. The new replace the old; the new generation would sooner or later become the mainstays of the sect, representing its future strength. Strength dictated status, and how other sects would position themselves in the future. Moreover, not long ago, a magnificent celestial phenomenon had manifested above Qingyuan Sect, illuminating the heavens. Many had come with the intention of probing its true nature.

As Old Ba spoke, he pointed ahead, "That's the Burning Jade Forest contingent. Leading them is one of their six Chief Elders." Li Mo followed his gaze. The Burning Jade Forest hadn't sent many people, just a dozen or so, but their presence was significant. Their disciples were all exceptionally dressed, armed with renowned weapons, clearly distinguishing themselves from the surrounding minor factions. A white-robed disciple stood at the very front, hands clasped behind his back, a faint arrogance in his eyes.

"Burning Jade Forest is located to the west of Purple Sun Prefecture, and a part of their territory borders the Central Divine Continent, which is why some of their disciples have extraordinary backgrounds," Old Ba explained upon seeing this.

"And over there?" Li Mo asked again.

Old Ba glanced over, chuckling, "That's the Red Whale Gang. They're the largest gang in Purple Sun Prefecture, and quite renowned even in the Eastern Barren Domain. On the surface, their strength is at the bottom among the three major sects, but it's a mixed bag of dragons and fish, and their waters run very deep."

The Red Whale Gang's side was much livelier. They had connections, direct or indirect, with many minor sects, inevitably leading to a flurry of greetings and pleasantries. Hearing this, Li Mo nodded slightly. He squinted. The leader was a Red Whale Gang helmsman, but what caught Li Mo's attention wasn't him, but the blood-robed youth beside him. This youth gave him a strange feeling. But before he could activate his Heaven's Mandate Divine Eye, his sight was blocked by a familiar figure: the Purple Sun Prefecture Lord. The Lord, whom he had met once before, began conversing with the leading helmsman.

The carriage moved on. Before long, they arrived at the mid-slope of Qingyuan Main Peak.

"Go get 'em, my precious disciple," Shang Wu said, stifling a yawn as she rose and gracefully floated onto the high platform. The Peak Master Elders were already seated there, with a few extra seats reserved for observers from other sects.

Shangguan Wencang sat in the center, his gaze sweeping over the scene. Upon seeing Ying Bing, a look of profound expectation flashed in his eyes. It wasn't just the Sect Master's gaze. Many pairs of eyes in the arena also turned towards her at this moment. Shangguan Wencang's only disciple, the acknowledged successor to the Qingyuan Sect Master position, and a person of outstanding talent among her peers. With numerous enviable halos surrounding her, combined with a reclusive, high-mountain snow lotus-like temperament, it was difficult for her to be ignored.

"?" Little Li furrowed his brow. His senses were sharp; he naturally detected many hostile gazes, seeing him as an eyesore. After all, he was the only one standing beside Ying Bing, and he had even obtained the Chixiao Sword, which complemented the Frostfall Sword.

Facing those gazes, Little Li's lips twitched. "Ying Bing, I brought some tea leaves. Care for some?"

"Alright." Ying Bing loved tea, regardless of its quality. With her delicate hands, she took the tea set and skillfully began brewing, her movements swift and pleasing to the eye, as beautiful as a painting, mesmerizing countless onlookers.

"Tsk." Li Mo picked up a small cup of Longjing tea. Those gazes grew even more hostile; if looks could kill, he would have been instantly riddled with holes. He took a satisfied sip, praising, "Yours still tastes the best."

At this moment, Sect Master Qingyuan's voice resounded. "Today marks the Nine Peaks Grand Competition, so I will keep my words brief. Fellow colleagues, esteemed heroes, our Qingyuan Sect's competition this time focuses on several key points..."

...An hour later, the elderly voice from the high platform finally slowed down, seemingly still reluctant to stop. It appeared the usually taciturn Sect Master saved all his words for occasions like this.

"Alright, that will be all," Shangguan Wencang nodded gently, signaling the start of the next segment. Primarily, if he continued speaking, not many in the audience would listen; they'd all fall asleep. The next segment was the drawing of lots.

Qian Bufan had deacons collect all the participating disciples' waist tokens, placing them inside a bronze ox in the arena. Then, he channeled his energy and slapped the ox's back. A metallic clattering sound ensued, and the bronze beast spat out two waist tokens. He glanced at them, then announced loudly, "Xiao Qin versus Xie Lan'ai!"

The first match was Senior Brother Xiao? Li Mo looked towards the stage. Old Xiao's aura was stronger than what he'd seen days ago, clearly indicating a breakthrough in his martial arts. He carried a broken sword on his back, his expression resolute, exuding a sharp and determined demeanor. His opponent was no simple figure either. The woman had excellent features, but her high cheekbones added a touch of severity to her already cold expression.

Li Mo activated his Heaven's Mandate Divine Eye and looked.
[Name: Xie Lan'ai]
[Age: 23]
[Root Bone: Plum Blossom Hand]
[Realm: Inner Breath Jade Fluid Realm]
[Heaven's Mandate: Blue with Grey]
[Appraisal: True Disciple of Falling Cloud Peak, likely to take over a peak in the future. Destined for a love tribulation; due to her personality, her affections can easily turn extreme and venomous.]
[Recent Encounters: Learned that her beloved Senior Brother Yinhua Cheng desires the Chixiao Sword, and is preparing to scheme for the Frostfall Sword.]

Old Xiao's luck wasn't great. "Yinhua Cheng wants my Chixiao?" Li Mo's brows slightly lifted. He recalled that the Peak Master Elder of Precious Beast Peak had the double surname Yinhua.

A cry of 'Begin!' fell, signaling the start of the battle. Xiao Qin evidently knew that against an opponent a realm higher than him, he shouldn't prolong the fight. Whoosh— The greatsword found his hand, and with his strike, it seemed to subtly mend its broken parts, its sword light growing several times larger. His very first move was a preemptive strike, the surging sword light pressing down.

A hint of surprise flickered in Xie Lan'ai's eyes, yet she neither dodged nor retreated. The soft sword at her waist, like a silver snake, coiled around her arm. She didn't retreat or swing her sword in attack; instead, she closed in. Xiao Qin's pupils constricted. He didn't understand his opponent's approach. Even if she was a realm higher, surely she wouldn't be so arrogant as to block a sword strike with her bare body? Yet, the very next moment.

Xie Lan'ai's body suddenly became supple and elusive, like a broken leaf fluttering in the wind. Xiao Qin's greatsword struck as if hitting a wad of cotton, finding no purchase whatsoever. Then, a cold glint flashed. As Xiao Qin's vision blurred, the soft sword, like a spiritual serpent, had inexplicably transformed its trajectory and flickered before his eyes! Under her control, the soft sword truly seemed alive. The crowd couldn't help but reveal looks of astonishment. This was clearly Falling Cloud Peak's renowned 'Spirit Serpent Sword Art,' a high-grade martial art. Moreover, Xie Lan'ai had already mastered it to great perfection.
