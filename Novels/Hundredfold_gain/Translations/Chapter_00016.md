# Chapter 16: The Ambush

The long merchant caravan advanced steadily along the trade route. 

Among the caravan were many figures, though most were ordinary mortals—martial artists recruited from the mortal towns beneath Red Maple Valley. In truth, there were only four cultivators openly present: one mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator at the sixth layer, stationed at the center of the caravan, and three at the third layer—including Qi Chuan—scattered around the perimeter to guard against unexpected incidents.

Qi Chuan and a boy around thirteen years old were positioned at the rear of the caravan. Of course, if trouble truly arose, these third-layer cultivators wouldn't be of much use—the real reliance was on the sixth-layer expert.

"That guy looks so young, probably a year younger than me? He must only be at the second layer of Qi Refinement?" The thirteen-year-old boy, named Qi Feng, cast a glance in Qi Chuan's direction before indifferently withdrawing his gaze, his eyes darkening with thought.

Qi Feng, at the third layer of Qi Refinement, had been privately tested for spiritual roots at nine by an elder from the main family branch and brought there to cultivate. Even so, advancing from a spiritual seedling to the third layer in just four years was a source of pride for him—all thanks to his mid-sixth-grade spiritual root.

His thoughts soon turned elsewhere. "Third Grandmother mentioned that the Wind Moon Sect is recruiting disciples, and our Qi family has one inner sect quota. I'm already at the third layer, and with two years left before recruitment, if I work hard and take some pills, I might reach the peak of the third layer. But will that be enough to secure the inner sect spot?"

"Qi Chan'er, the granddaughter of the Transmission Elder, has a fourth-grade spiritual root and is already at the third layer—a year younger than me. But even she likely won't break through to the mid-stage in two years. The bottleneck isn't so easily overcome."

"Still, if we're both at the peak of the third layer, her superior spiritual root and younger age will probably sway the family in her favor..." The more he thought, the gloomier his expression became. Unless he could somehow break through to the fourth layer shortly after reaching the peak of the third, his chances were slim.

Qi Chuan, unaware of Qi Feng's musings—or even his name—remained vigilant, scanning the surroundings. Unlike higher-level cultivators, those at the third layer lacked spiritual sense, relying solely on their sharpened senses to detect threats. 

The scenery of this immortal world was breathtaking, untainted by technology and enriched by the faint spiritual energy in the air. Yet, the lives of ordinary mortals here seemed even harsher than in ancient times. Qi Chuan counted himself fortunate to have been born under the Qi family's protection.

Half a month passed uneventfully, lulling Qi Chuan into a sense of security—until the caravan entered a densely forested mountain range.

*Whoosh! Whoosh!*

Without warning, fireballs, water arrows, and ice spikes tore through the air, raining down on the caravan. Chaos erupted as demon horses neighed and mortal guards panicked.

"So it begins," Qi Chuan muttered, bracing himself.

"Audacious! How dare you attack a Qi family caravan!" A furious roar erupted from the center as the sixth-layer cultivator hurled talismans that burst into flames, intercepting the incoming attacks.

*Boom! Boom!* 

The sky echoed with explosions as the spells collided and dissipated.

"Ha! Leave now if you value your lives, or lose both your goods and your heads!" A mocking laugh rang out as five black-clad, masked figures emerged from the forest—all cultivators. They charged toward the caravan.

"Protect the goods!" The Qi family's sixth-layer cultivator engaged two of the raiders—one at the sixth layer, the other at the fifth—barely holding his own. The remaining three bandits pressed forward, intent on looting.

Qi Chuan sighed. He'd hoped for a safe journey, but fate had other plans. Steeling himself, he moved to intercept the nearest raider—a third-layer cultivator.

"A mere child dares to stand in my way?" The bandit sneered, forming hand seals. A crimson fireball the size of half a fist materialized in his palm before hurtling toward Qi Chuan. 

This raider, though only at the third layer, had mastered his Fireball Technique to a minor achievement level—a formidable threat to anyone below the fourth layer. Against an apparent second-layer youth with no artifacts, one strike should suffice to reduce him to ashes.

But Qi Chuan only smiled. With a swift motion, he conjured a water arrow as thick as an arm. It pierced through the air, followed swiftly by two more. 

Three perfected-tier Water Arrow Techniques launched in rapid succession—a display that drained Qi Chuan but sent the raider's face twisting in shock.
