# Chapter 7: The Complete Viscera-Nourishing Inner Energy Technique!

Early the next morning, as the sun rose, Li Zhengjing lay asleep with his eyes closed. Although the golden page had absorbed the Gu poison the previous night, the lingering effects of the alcohol left him in a deep slumber.

Outside his courtyard, Elder Lin and Elder Fan had already inspected the surroundings of twelve other residences, accompanied by twelve outer sect disciples, and arrived at Li Zhengjing’s door.

Pushing open the courtyard gate, they were met with a scene of disarray—fallen leaves scattered everywhere, and the remnants of last night’s supper still left uncleared on the stone table. Lately, Li Zhengjing had been burdened with worries and pressure, neglecting the upkeep of his courtyard, which now appeared desolate before their eyes.

“A disciple of the Immortal Sect, yet so slovenly! What kind of example is this?”  
“He probably thinks he’ll soon move into the inner sect and can’t be bothered with this outer sect residence.”  
“Summon Li Zhengjing to receive his punishment!”

Elder Lin strode into the room first, followed closely by Elder Fan and the twelve outer sect disciples. Inside, they found Li Zhengjing lying on the bed, fully clothed, his eyes closed. His face, pale with a faint bluish tint from his recent internal injuries, bore no trace of vitality.

The group exchanged uneasy glances. Elder Lin stepped forward, took one look at his lifeless complexion, and sighed. “He died from poisoning.”

“What? Li Zhengjing is dead?”  
“How did he die?”

The twelve outer sect disciples were aghast. Most of them were young and new to the sect, having never witnessed death firsthand. Fear and unease settled over them.

“When Li Zhengjing first joined the sect, he secretly raised poisonous insects and was once poisoned by them. It seems he resumed this practice and ended up poisoning himself—truly a worthless death!” Elder Fan picked up the medicine cauldron beside the bed, its low-grade spirit stones removed, and declared, “This must have been used to cultivate Gu insects.”

Elder Lin sighed. “Secure the cauldron as evidence and report it to the Enforcement Hall for further investigation.” With that, he pulled out a straw mat from his robe and spread it on the ground. Then, he produced a white cloth and draped it over the young man’s face.

Just as he withdrew his hand and was about to speak—  
A hand reached up and yanked the white cloth away.

The room fell deathly silent.  
The hand belonged to Li Zhengjing himself.

“A corpse has risen!”  
One of the outer sect disciples shrieked, and chaos erupted.

“Rise your damn head!”  
Li Zhengjing grumbled, tossing the white cloth aside. He glanced at the straw mat, then looked up at Elder Lin’s horrified face.

“The two elders even prepared a burial mat for me.”  
A warmth filled Li Zhengjing’s heart, and he felt oddly moved. *All these days, every crisis foretold a death without a whole corpse. But this time, they actually planned to give me a proper burial! As the saying goes, one should repay kindness in life. In the future, I must ensure they, too, get to keep their whole bodies—let them die with dignity!*

“Li Zhengjing!” Elder Lin, having recovered from the shock, snapped, “If you’re not dead, why pretend to be?”  

Elder Fan, frowning deeply, calmed the outer sect disciples before adding sternly, “Today’s routine inspection of residence conditions reveals your courtyard is in utter disarray. You must be punished!”

“This disciple is willing to forfeit next month’s medicinal bath materials as punishment.”  
Li Zhengjing sat up, spreading his hands. “Losing a month’s medicinal bath is already severe. Now… everyone, please leave.”

The two elders snorted in unison and strode out, followed by the twelve outer sect disciples.  
The courtyard returned to its desolate state.

Stretching lazily, Li Zhengjing mused, *The tampered Viscera-Nourishing Inner Energy Technique had to pass through five elders before reaching me. Chen Youyu was one… It seems these two elders were also involved.*  

Kicking aside the straw mat and white cloth, he washed up and headed straight for the Scripture Repository.

Among the two elders on duty at the repository that day, one—Elder Zhou—gaped at Li Zhengjing as if seeing a ghost.  

“Elder Zhou, surprised to see me?” Li Zhengjing grinned and waved.  

Watching the elder’s face shift between shock and dread, Li Zhengjing suspected Elder Zhou Shaojie might also be among the five who altered the technique.  

Patting the elder’s shoulder, Li Zhengjing chuckled, “With your talent for facial expressions, you could make a living as a street performer. Even if you’re expelled from the sect, you won’t starve.”  

Without waiting for a response, he ascended to the second floor of the repository.  

Pei Ying was absent today—likely still passed out from last night’s drinking, sprawled on some flirtatious woman’s bed. Li Zhengjing sighed in disappointment; he had hoped to further bond with Pei Ying and mooch another meal off him.  

Resigned, he proceeded to the sixth bookshelf, twelfth row, and retrieved the thirty-sixth volume, continuing from where he left off the previous day.  

Meanwhile, Pei Ying lay sprawled on Chen Youyu’s bed, the two having drunk themselves into a stupor the night before.  

Chen Youyu, having cultivated inner energy, woke first. Refreshed, he tightened his belt and strode to the window, basking in the sunlight.  

Compared to yesterday’s sleepless dread—agonizing over Li Zhengjing’s survival and his own impending doom on the Soul-Severing Platform—today was a new dawn.  

He burst into laughter, his aged face crinkling like a chrysanthemum, then flushed with embarrassment recalling his tearful breakdown in front of others. “Undignified… utterly undignified…”  

Just then, the courtyard gate burst open.  

Elder Lin and two others stormed in, furious.  

“Where’s Pei Ying?”  

“Still in my bed. What’s the matter?”  

Chen Youyu’s smile faltered as unease prickled his spine. “Weren’t you supposed to collect Li Zhengjing’s corpse?”  

Elder Lin stepped forward, cold-faced. “We did. Laid out the straw mat, covered his face with the white cloth.”  

Chen Youyu exhaled in relief. “Then bury him already. Why come here?”  

Elder Fan said flatly, “Then Li Zhengjing reached up and pulled the cloth off.”  

Chen Youyu stood frozen, as if struck by lightning.  

The whiplash of emotions left him dizzy, the world spinning. Gripping the railing, he gasped, “He’s… not dead?”  

The three elders nodded in unison. “Not dead.”  

Chen Youyu whirled toward the bed and bellowed, “String Pei Ying up and beat him! Beat him within an inch of his life!”  

——  

As dusk fell, Li Zhengjing finished reviewing the entire text. Using the Mystic Word-Selection Technique of Wuding Mountain, he extracted and memorized the relevant characters without needing to pore over every word, allowing him to read far faster than usual.  

By day’s end, he had committed the complete *Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique* hidden within the text to memory.  

To ensure no errors, he cross-checked his memorized version against the original eleven times before finally exhaling in relief and returning the book to its shelf.  

“Now… the most formidable Viscera-Nourishing Inner Energy Technique of the Feather-Transcending Immortal Sect is mine.”  

Descending the repository stairs, Li Zhengjing thought, *Once I transcribe and study it, I’ll strive to master it as soon as possible!*  

Excitement surged within him—tonight was the third night of his wine-offering at the pavilion!  

With the complete technique secured, and the hope of obtaining the Five Elements Creation Tree to heal his injuries, he could finally focus on cultivation and overcome his current crisis.  

Clenching his fists, Li Zhengjing resolved to begin secluded training the next day, refusing to emerge until he fully comprehended the *Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique* and achieved the Inner Energy realm!  

Returning to his residence, he transcribed the memorized text, verified its accuracy, and began deciphering the technique’s cultivation method.  

Attempting to channel his energy, he winced as sharp pain lanced through his organs, forcing him to stop. *Looks like I’ll have to wait until my injuries heal before practicing.*  

As night deepened, he burned the transcribed notes after committing them fully to memory. Then, he packed twelve jars of strong liquor into a wooden crate, hoisted it onto his shoulder, and slipped out under cover of darkness.  

Yet, barely half an hour after his departure, a shadow scaled the courtyard wall, darting behind a rockery to survey the empty residence.  

“Damn it! He’s not here!”  

The figure—light-footed as the wind—leaped back over the wall and headed straight for Chen Youyu’s quarters.  

Under the moonlight, the black cloth masking his face was removed, revealing Elder Lin.  

“Li Zhengjing isn’t home. We’ll wait for his return.”  

Turning to the others, Elder Lin said, “I’ll keep watch. When the time comes, we’ll release *it*—and let *it* tear Li Zhengjing apart!”
