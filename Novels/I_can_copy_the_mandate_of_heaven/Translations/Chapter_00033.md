# 33, Painkillers

"No wonder this can't be practiced."

"Unless I'm also born without the sense of pain, otherwise I can't practice it!"

After reading the description of this Seven Armor Elephant Skill, Li Zhiming was speechless. It requires taking animal essence, tiger blood, and extremely stimulating blood ingredients, starting from crushing every bone in the body, and then reshaping them using the method the creator found!

In order to achieve a skeleton different from ordinary people, capable of supporting the 'Dragon Elephant Strength' blood.

Just this one step made Li Zhiming numb. He estimated that a person's normal endurance could only withstand the process of completely crushing and reshaping one left arm at most, right? By the time it got to the next arm, he would probably be in so much pain that he wouldn't want to live.

Let alone the whole body! What was he thinking!

Even so, in the entire Seven Mysteries Sect for hundreds of years, there were actually a few warriors who persevered until the second step, which was truly not easy.

After all the bones in the body were crushed and completely reshaped, the next step was to change blood. Likewise, using the blood of demonic beasts to change one's blood, but the strong stimulation of the blood of demonic beasts would inevitably conflict with the meridians and internal organs.

This was almost a process of simultaneously washing the internal organs, destroying the meridians and reshaping them, tearing the muscles all over the body and reshaping them!

Several warriors before had persevered until this step, and then directly tortured themselves to death!

Because breaking and reshaping bones could at least be done one bone at a time, at most a little slower. But once the blood exchange started, it couldn't be stopped. It couldn't succeed until the whole body was completely and thoroughly exchanged once!

Often, once a normal person's blood exchange started, they couldn't stop it, and they would just torture themselves to death.

However, such a blood exchange once didn't count as success, it had to be done a full forty-nine times! Until the internal organs could supply such blood on their own. At this point, one could be called 'inhuman', with blood like mercury and an invincible skeleton.

Truly a match for a thousand people.

But this didn't even count as entry. Because the next step was to temper the internal organs, which was even more needless to say. From ancient times to the present, no one except the creator himself had successfully completed this step. Undoubtedly, just looking at the description above, it wasn't any less difficult than the previous two steps.

And it wasn't until all of this was done that it could be considered entry. After that, there were the cultivation methods for stimulating the Dragon Elephant Strength. The creator, because he had no fear of pain, cultivated all the way to this step smoothly, but after that, he had no way forward.

Nothing else, the human body was too fragile, and flesh and blood could not withstand the true Dragon Elephant Strength. According to his method of cultivation, he could only reach this level.

After that, either the limit of the human body had been reached, or his method was not feasible. In short, he was completely stuck by the Dragon Elephant Strength.

According to his method of cultivation, the human body still could not withstand the next Dragon Elephant Strength!

But even a small success was already invincible in the world!

"If you can cultivate to this level, how can you not be invincible in the world!" After reading this description, Li Zhiming didn't know how to complain. In short, it left a great shock in the heart of the young Li Zhiming.

But, theoretically, it can't be cultivated at all!

However, once combined with 'Late Bloomer'..., Li Zhiming's heart seemed to have a devil scurrying around, constantly tempting himself.

Even if it was extremely difficult, there was always a possibility placed there, tempting himself!

But in the end, Li Zhiming still sighed.

Forget it. Li Zhiming really didn't have the courage to crush his arm and reshape it. There was no shortage of people with great perseverance in the past, and they couldn't survive, let alone himself at the age of eleven?

Li Zhiming carefully put away this Seven Armor Elephant Skill. Li Zhiming had an illusion that one day, he might have a way to cultivate this Seven Armor Elephant Skill that had been shelved.

After putting away the Seven Armor Elephant Skill, sitting at the table, Li Zhiming stared blankly at the two books his master gave him, and fell into confusion for a while.

But why did Master give me these two books?

But in the next few days, Li Zhiming probably knew that Master had sent him a few bottles of medicine, which were said to be able to numb the sense of pain, so that he could temporarily forget the pain.

Coupled with this, he could indeed start trying to practice this Seven Armor Elephant Skill!

"Little Fourth, don't practice this yet." Seeing the painkillers sent by Master, Han Li walked over with his hands behind his back and glanced at them. He now had some of Doctor Mo's tone.

"Why?"

"Master's body is getting worse and worse, so we must prepare early. If you reshape an arm, it won't be better for half a year."

"Then what do we say when Master asks?"

"Meet soldiers with generals, and water with earth." Han Li said lightly, "You say you are experimenting on breaking collarbones and ribs, he can't see it."

Li Zhiming pondered for a while, this statement was indeed reasonable. Li Zhiming was still worried, so he learned to act against the rules and focused on studying the 'Demonic Silver Hand'.

A month later, Doctor Mo came to check Li Zhiming's progress in the Seven Armor Elephant Skill, covered his chest, and used this word to reply.

Doctor Mo tore open Li Zhiming's clothes and saw that Li Zhiming's chest was swollen, as if a rib was indeed being reshaped.

But after only coming this once, Doctor Mo suddenly fell completely ill.

The kind that couldn't get out of bed at all.

After that, he often fell into a coma.

Often he would be unconscious for one or two days.

In this way, Li Zhiming and Han Li's situation was completely ignored.

Li Zhiming still went to serve his master every day, but when he was free, Li Zhiming collected the painkillers that his master had left him and shelved the Seven Armor Elephant Skill. Unless he got Han Li's 'Late Bloomer', Li Zhiming didn't plan to try this thing.

Instead, he seriously practiced the 'Demonic Silver Hand' that his master had left him. This thing was also powerful, and Li Zhiming was very greedy for it.

'Demonic Silver Hand' seemed to be refined by soaking it in a special potion, and then using internal force to open up several hidden meridians on the wrist first.

However, it is best to start practicing this thing after the age of fourteen.

Li Zhiming only began to study how the potion of the 'Demonic Silver Hand' was developed, and tried to use Positive Yang Energy to open up the meridians on his wrist.

Thus, half a year passed in a flash. Han Li looked more and more anxious every day, and went out of the valley earlier and returned later every day. In this way, Li Zhiming and Han Li had spent their fourth spring and autumn in the valley.

On this day, Master suddenly sent someone to send a message, asking Han Li and Li Zhiming to go to his room.

He was dying.

"You two go quickly, Doctor Mo is waiting for you in the room." The tall senior brother with a thin figure and gloomy eyes glanced at Han Li and Li Zhiming in the room, and turned away.
