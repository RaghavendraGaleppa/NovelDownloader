# Chapter 64: The Price Must Be Higher!

"Boom!"

A tremendous shockwave swept through everything with terrifying force. Within the cavern, the low-grade brown spirit apes huddled together in fear, trembling and not daring to open their eyes.

Gu Yuan's expression was equally grave.

"Boom!"

"Whoosh!"

He manipulated the Purple Lightning Chisel and the Three Decay Mirror, relentlessly attacking the golden giant ape. However, after its transformation, the golden ape's defenses had increased dramatically, its fur now needle-like and nearly indestructible.

Though suppressed by the mirror and scorched black by the lightning, the ape's eyes remained sharp, its strength undiminished.

"Clang!"

The golden staff came crashing down. The Green Lotus Shield was the first to give way, emitting a mournful cry as its illusory form shattered. The artifact dimmed and fell back into Gu Yuan's palm.

Only the Mountain Seal stood firm, unmoving as a mountain, barely withstanding the blow. But the mountain illusion flickered and trembled, clearly not as effortless as it seemed.

"Ook ook!"

Seeing this, the golden ape grew excited, its golden eyes gleaming brighter as it raised its staff for another strike.

"Clang!"

The Mountain Seal blocked again, but its spiritual light had dimmed to the extreme. One more hit would surely break its defense.

With the golden staff in hand, the golden-backed ape fully unleashed its power as a top-grade spirit beast at the ninth level of Qi Refinement. Every movement carried terrifying force.

While supreme-grade artifacts could suppress an eighth-level cultivator, they struggled against the ninth level. Meanwhile, Gu Yuan's Secret Arrow of Decree had only just formed ninety runes.

"Bang!"

Another strike came, and the Mountain Seal could hold no longer. The mountain illusion shattered, and the artifact fell back into Gu Yuan's palm.

"Ook ook!"

Seeing Gu Yuan's two defensive artifacts broken, the golden ape's eyes gleamed with excitement. Raising its staff high, it prepared to deliver a crushing blow.

Gu Yuan's mind stirred as he communicated with the Star Spirit, ready to transform at any moment—yet he held back. Instead, he clasped his hands behind his back, standing defenseless as he looked at the white elder ape.

"I am an inner disciple of the Dao Academy. Who dares kill me? Do you not fear extermination?" he said coldly, his tone dripping with arrogance, like a true villain.

The golden ape only grew angrier at these words, gripping its staff tightly, ready to smash Gu Yuan's skull. But just as the staff was about to land, a hoarse voice called out.

"Stop!"

The white elder ape on the golden ape's back spoke.

Though the words were strange and slurred, it was unmistakably human speech.

---

The golden ape, obedient to the elder, reluctantly halted its attack, glaring at Gu Yuan with resentment before turning a pitiful gaze toward the elder.

"Stop. Do you truly wish to kill him?" the elder sighed. "Even if you could, do you want our entire clan wiped out?"

The elder had been observing Gu Yuan, recognizing the human's confidence and intelligence. Though the young man had hidden cards, he chose not to play them, instead leveraging the Dao Academy's authority to end this test of strength.

This was a clever man.

Gu Yuan understood this was an unfair fight—after all, they were within the Qingfeng Dao Academy's territory. The academy could exterminate their kind, but they could never kill an inner disciple without facing annihilation.

The balance of power was inherently unequal. They were mere spirit beasts raised in captivity, while Gu Yuan was a prized disciple.

If an inner disciple killed a golden-backed ape, the worst punishment would be confinement in the White Worm Ice Prison for reflection. But if the apes killed an inner disciple within the academy grounds, their entire clan would be eradicated as an example.

What master would tolerate a dog killing their child?

The beasts of Linghe Island were intelligent. Even the aggressive Rainbow Cloud Spiders only bit silk-gathering disciples during egg-laying season, never daring to kill.

Gu Yuan had known this all along—hence his confidence.

"Ook ook!" The golden ape snorted angrily but shrank back to its original size, reluctantly withdrawing its staff.

"You see things clearly, Elder," Gu Yuan said, releasing his connection with the Star Spirit, a faint smile on his lips.

Invoking the academy's authority had been a last resort. The golden ape was formidable—even with the Star Spirit, Gu Yuan wasn't sure he could subdue it, let alone the enigmatic elder.

In that case, it was time to negotiate—or rather, divide the spoils.

"You claim to be a Dao Academy disciple, yet you still covet this spirit mine—embezzling the academy's assets," the elder said mildly.

"Not at all," Gu Yuan replied smoothly. "I'm merely assisting the academy in recovering resources before submitting them. According to academy regulations, the discoverer of a minor mine receives thirty percent. If they aid in extraction, it rises to fifty or even sixty percent. The academy is generous—it would never shortchange me."

The elder chuckled dryly.

What a greedy brat—demanding sixty percent outright.

Yet he knew Gu Yuan wasn't lying. The academy was indeed magnanimous, rewarding contributions fairly. If Gu Yuan reported the mine, he'd likely receive forty to fifty percent without issue. Minor mines were beneath the academy's notice—if a disciple claimed one privately, so long as no one made a fuss, the academy wouldn't intervene.

"This mine is small," the elder said. "At most, it yields three thousand spirit stones. We've toiled day and night for a month and only extracted nine hundred. Fully mining it would take months of labor."

Gu Yuan remained silent, waiting for the elder's offer.

"However," the elder continued, "since you've come, we won't be stingy. A fifty-fifty split, how about that?"

Fifteen hundred spirit stones—a considerable windfall. But it was no better than reporting to the academy.

Gu Yuan sighed. "As a disciple of the academy, bound by its teachings, how could I defy its laws?"

His meaning was clear: if you want me to bend the rules, the price must be higher.

The elder smiled knowingly, as if prepared. "In that case, how about we make a deal?"
