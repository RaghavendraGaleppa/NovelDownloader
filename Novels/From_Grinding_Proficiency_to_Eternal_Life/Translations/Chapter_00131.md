# Chapter 131: Traitors Among the People

Xu Yunfan’s throat moved slightly as he secretly swallowed a Red Blood Restoration Pill from the Medicine Hall. A faint rumbling echoed from his stomach as threads of heat spread from his abdomen throughout his body, invigorating his bones and replenishing the energy consumed from his blood and Qi.

Tiangong Cave was not the Medicine King Valley after all. Although the Medicine Hall was under Hong Baichuan’s sole jurisdiction and not part of the Six Ministries, it only had two or three masters in charge of alchemy. This pill was extremely precious, capable of saving one's life in a critical moment.

At this moment, Yan Yuwei whispered, "Cuibo City is the capital of Cangzhou. Tiangong Cave has a large number of industries operated by the External Affairs Hall clustered here. Logically speaking, even if the Incense Fire Sect is powerful, they shouldn't be able to move in Cuibo City without Tiangong Cave receiving any information. Moreover..."

She looked into the distance, her expression extremely grave.

"A City Prefect, a Military Commander, and ten thousand garrison troops were taken down by the Incense Fire Sect without a single drop of blood shed. I simply cannot believe it."

Although Yan Yuwei didn't say it explicitly, her meaning was quite clear as she swept her gaze over the surrounding平民 (commoner) believers gathering around.

There were traitors among the people, and members of the Incense Fire Sect within the External Affairs Hall.

He glanced at Yan Yuwei using her greatsword to support her body. The wound on her right leg had bled through half of her trousers. Although she had used her muscles to constrict the wound, it would burst open again if she engaged in intense combat.

"Forget about the thanks," Xu Yunfan said calmly. "How about you make way and let us wash the dust off at the lake?"

As he spoke, he glanced at the disciples of Tiangong Cave in the ruins of the Cuibo Tower, still continuously rescuing other disciples from under the rubble, and let out a soft sigh in his heart.

The Mingwang Spear suddenly swept across, its fierce wind overturning a wine flag half-buried nearby. The flag instantly shattered into pieces, shooting toward them like sharp arrows.

Xu Yunfan pulled Yan Yuwei and retreated three zhangs violently. The spot where they had just stood was blasted apart by the fragments of the wine flag, and the shattered stones pierced into the brick walls on both sides like arrows.

His expression turned solemn. Such an attack naturally posed no threat to him, but the spear thrust just now gave him a chilling sensation.

It could easily break through his Vajra Body.

"Take your time."

This Incense Fire Sect expert in the Blood Transformation Realm gently stroked his horse's mane. The Flood Dragon Horse exhaled white mist smelling of sulfur.

"After I take your head, I will naturally send the two of you to sleep eternally at the bottom of the lake."

Before his words had finished, a earth-shaking wail suddenly came from the west of the city.

Xu Yunfan raised his gaze. Black smoke was rolling up from the residential area three miles away, mixed with the piercing screams of women and children.

A peddler covered in blood stumbled out from a street corner, the swaddling clothes in his arms already soaked through.

For a time, the entire Cuibo City began to fall into a state of tragic wailing and crying. The whole city was enveloped by a massive slaughter.

The surrounding commoner believers, amidst the sounds of killing, began to chant fervently in low voices.

"The Ming尊 descends to the world, the Red Lotus paves the way;
White bones form the road, karma fire burns the dust.
The seven emotions serve as firewood, the six desires as fuel;
Flesh and blood turn into candles, illuminating the darkness.
Those who submit transcend, those who resist sink;
This mortal world is defiled, only I am pure."

"You... you are slaughtering the city!" Yan Yuwei’s eyes nearly split, her heavy long-handled saber smashing the floor tiles.

"This is the baptism before the arrival of the Ming尊. It is a pity that you are not devout and do not believe in the Mingwang; otherwise, you would know His greatness and omnipotence," the figure on the horse chuckled lightly. "By the way, are you waiting for the Cuibo City garrison commander to lead his troops here?"

He suddenly pointed his spear toward the south of the city. "Right now, he is exchanging spear techniques with this Sect's Great Protector in the General's Mansion. If not for..."

The figure lowered his head, looking at the corpse whose head had been smashed by Xu Yunfan, his gaze icy.

"If not for this old dog, how could our Incense Fire Sect have been so hasty? He truly deserves to be beheaded ten thousand times."

Xu Yunfan’s knuckles turned white from gripping.

The distress signal flare from Tiangong Cave was hidden in the pouch at his waist, but it required three breaths of time to ignite and launch.

The aura of this Blood Transformation Realm expert before him was as deep as an abyss. A slight carelessness would lead to eternal damnation.

"Take it, and shoot it off." He shoved it to Yan Yuwei, suddenly lowering his voice. "I will cover the rear."

Before Yan Yuwei could speak, the Mingwang Spear had already transformed into a blood-colored streak of light.

Xu Yunfan spun around and threw out the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. The moment the chain wrapped around the spear shaft, the entire chain pulled taut like a straight steel cable, startling the Flood Dragon Horse.

The Flood Dragon Horse reared up with a long neigh. As its iron hooves shattered the street surface, Xu Yunfan used the force to leap into the air, his left arm whipping out like a lash.

*Snap!*

The mechanical crossbow at his waist fired seven arrows in a row, aiming directly for the Flood Dragon Horse's eyes and the surrounding guards!

There were countless mechanical hidden weapons in the Mechanism Hall of Tiangong Cave. It would truly be a waste of his status as a direct disciple if he didn't bring some for self-defense.

"Tricks."

The Blood Transformation Realm expert had to pull back the Mingwang Spear, deflecting the crossbow bolts aimed at his guards with a few flicks of his spear. At the same time, he reached out and flicked his fingers, causing the seven fine steel arrows to explode into iron powder in mid-air.

However, Xu Yunfan had already taken advantage of the opportunity to close in under the horse's belly, his right leg chopping down like a battle-axe toward the rider's waist.

This strike contained the Ninefold Wave Force. It was a technique he had conceived while contemplating the Pure Yang One Qi Art. By twisting and combining three types of training, using the Cicada as the bone, the Red Lotus as the skin, and the Flying Leg as the muscle, the contraction of his muscles and the trembling of his bones like a cicada's chirp, combined with the vibration of his tendons like a bowstring, the three forces were twisted together!

The Blood Transformation Realm expert looked coldly at Xu Yunfan closing in, but he made no move.

*Thud!*

A muffled sound like a giant drum being beaten rang out. The bursting force blew up the surrounding dust, wood chips, and stones.

Xu Yunfan's face flushed red as he stumbled back several steps. The Blood Transformation Realm expert riding the Flood Dragon Horse, however, remained completely unmoved.

His pupils constricted. He finally saw the waist and abdominal muscles visible through the gaps in the opponent's heavy玄铁 (Mysterious Iron) armor. They were like living pythons moving slowly under the iron skin, causing the armor plates to undulate like waves, distributing the force throughout his entire body.

"Good strength. If I weren't riding the Flood Dragon Horse, I might have been pushed back three steps. You are quite clever. If you had used your hammer, your head might have been pierced by my spear just now."

*Crack.*

The sound of the Flood Dragon Horse's iron hooves was piercingly harsh.

The cold voice of the Incense Fire Sect expert rang out, chilling Xu Yunfan's heart. He had already tried every method he could think of, yet it had still been ineffective.

At this moment, Yan Yuwei's greatsword cut through the air.

Sweeping down three crossbow-wielding sect members, she seized the opportunity to crash into the heavy shield formation, her long saber spinning like a windmill.

She pushed her Molten Gold Forging Iron Art to its limit. Blood beads oozing from her pores hardened into rust-colored scabs on her skin, actually managing to硬抗 (hardly resist) two thrusts from hook-sickle spears.

*Fool.*

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but glance at Yan Yuwei. He had braved the danger to buy time so she could launch the signal, but he didn't expect that upon hearing the city was being slaughtered, she had lost her composure and been consumed by rage.

The enemy could not be defeated by force. Perhaps if he took out the gilded rods behind him and entered the Lin State, he might have a fighting chance.

But the Incense Fire Sect members surrounding them were not to be trifled with.

"Enough. You are a direct disciple of Tiangong Cave. I will give you a dignified death."

The Mingwang Spear pierced through the air without warning. The spear tip trembled, tearing through the morning mist and leaving three afterimages burned into Xu Yunfan's retinas.

In an instant, the surrounding air seemed to turn into a thick liquid. The spear tip划破 (tearing through) it left a visible, turbid white wave of air, and the three-foot-long spear aura spewing forth was even more terrifying.

*So fast!!*

Xu Yunfan's pupils shrank to the size of a needle's point. The knuckles of his left hand, which had been moving restlessly before his chest, cracked like firecrackers before suddenly forming a seal.

"Lin!"
