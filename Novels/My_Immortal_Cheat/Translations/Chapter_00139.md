# Chapter 139: A Draw

The place was in an uproar. Two supreme experts faced off, battling from the heavens to the ground, then from the ground back to the clouds.

Zhou Xunchuan’s might was unparalleled. Even after expending most of his vital energy, he still fought She Yin to a standstill, their battle terrifying. Divine abilities were continuously unleashed, brilliant and awe-inspiring.

She Yin’s Sixteen-foot Golden Body shone resplendently. As the battle reached its peak, he shed all trace of his transcendent demeanor. His eyes were wide with fury, like a Wrathful Vajra—a peerless combat force from the ancient Buddhist realm, where everyone cultivated the Sixteen-foot Golden Body, capable of shaking the world with a single punch.

Upon closer inspection, under the extremely brilliant Buddhist light emanating from She Yin, there were distinct fist imprints on his golden body, almost caving in. These were inflicted by Zhou Xunchuan, powerful fist strikes imbued with his indomitable will, difficult to erase.

Zhou Xunchuan fared no better. His golden armor was fragmented, shattered by She Yin’s raw power, with some pieces even embedded in his flesh.

"Amitabha!" She Yin proclaimed a Buddhist chant. A vast Buddhist sound emanated from the void. Then, She Yin’s Sixteen-foot Golden Body underwent a new transformation, manifesting a sacred image with eighteen arms and twenty-four heads, wielding necklaces, parasols, flower vases, ritual fish organs, blessing staffs, files, golden bells, golden bows, silver halberds, and banners.

"Could this be...?" Some onlookers were throttled by disbelief, unable to utter a sound, only their eyes revealing their astonishment.

"It is said that in ancient times, a Buddha from the Buddhist realm combined the Sixteen-foot Golden Body with his own dharma to cultivate an unimaginably peerless divine ability," a knowledgeable person recognized, exclaiming in shock.

The sacred image radiated brilliant Buddhist light, with a large halo floating behind its back. In an instant, Buddhist chants filled the air everywhere. The sacred image’s twenty-four mouths chanted scriptures, transforming the area into something akin to Luotian Temple, with illusory figures of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas seated in the void, surrounding Zhou Xunchuan.

People's hearts trembled. Fortunately, the array set up in the arena isolated all anomalies; otherwise, some might have converted on the spot. This divine ability was too terrifying. Everyone believed Zhou Xunchuan was in great trouble. Even Zhou Zui and Liu Yan slightly frowned. She Yin's divine ability had never been displayed before; it possessed immense power, no less than some forbidden great divine abilities.

*Whoosh!* At that moment, a dazzling immortal light erupted.

Zhou Xunchuan stretched his limbs and unleashed punches, clear light surging within him. His physique glowed with a lustrous sheen. He frowned and roared, "Don't you think you're very noisy? Like mosquitoes buzzing in my ear!"

Inside him, mysterious patterns radiated divine light, releasing the body's most fundamental potential, vast and astonishing. She Yin had trump cards, and so did he. Strands of chains of order entwined around Zhou Xunchuan's body. Then, he unleashed his ultimate power, and a blurry figure appeared behind him. The figure’s upper body was bare, revealing bronze skin and bulging muscles, yet possessing a unique beauty and unimaginable strength.

People from Futian Province looked on in horror, their lips trembling, unable to speak. They recalled a legendary figure from the Futian Realm, a supreme expert who once punched a crack into the world barrier of the ancient Divine Realm.

"Hmph!" Zhou Xunchuan let out an enraged roar. The blurry figure also exploded with a roar, seemingly echoing from ancient times. A massive fist swung out, its mere movement causing large cracks to appear in the void, like a spiderweb.

She Yin, now a sacred image, showed no expression, but his scripture chanting became even more astonishing, pouring into Zhou Xunchuan's ears from all directions. The Buddhist ancient treasures held in his eighteen hands all erupted with terrifying divine light, striking Zhou Xunchuan simultaneously.

Zhou Xunchuan’s fist fully extended. The void completely shattered; earth, wind, water, and fire were reshaped. The figure’s power imbued his strike, making his strength almost reach the level of Dao, "power close to Dao."

As the energies of both combatants were about to collide, everyone focused their gazes, though with a peculiar expression that struck Zhou Tian as strange. Just at the final moment, an even more terrifying fluctuation descended, far more powerful than She Yin and Zhou Xunchuan, utterly incomparable.

Time seemed to freeze. All anomalies disappeared. She Yin returned to human form, his already fair skin now even whiter. The figure behind Zhou Xunchuan also dissipated. Zhou Xunchuan breathed heavily, a look of helplessness flashing across his face, but no surprise, as if he had anticipated it.

The dust settled. A white-robed elder appeared out of thin air in the void. His hair and beard were completely white, his face covered in layers of wrinkles, yet he possessed a temperament that felt like heaven and man united.

"Today's battle ends in a draw!" the elder declared calmly, surveying the surroundings.

"Alas, I knew it would be like this," someone sighed.
"It's always like this, interrupting the excitement at the climax."
"..." Many people sighed, showing extreme disappointment.

Zhou Tian was confused. "What's this old man doing? Why is he interfering with the match?"

Zhou Zui, knowing Zhou Tian was watching a battle in this place for the first time, explained, "He is a senior from the Fools' Sect, specifically responsible for overseeing battles here. He's a Great Emperor realm expert. We are all prodigies from major powers, the future pillars of our factions. Any problem befalling one of us would be an immense loss. So, whenever the final life-and-death showdowns occur, he steps in to stop it, fearing that one side might lose control and cause harm. Then, he judges the outcome of the match."

Zhou Tian nodded. No wonder those people had such strange expressions, as if watching TV at its climax only for an advertisement to suddenly pop up.

"'A draw'? Excellent!" Someone exclaimed – it was Li Rulong from the Treasure Pavilion. A draw meant he won big on all his bets, a truly massive profit. Many showed pained expressions, apparently having bet a lot.

Zhou Xunchuan descended from the arena and walked to them, looking slightly displeased. "What draw? If he hadn't interfered, I would have definitely won in the end." It wasn't that he was trying to make excuses; these prodigies had absolute confidence in themselves and didn't believe they would fail. Even if She Yin said nothing, he undoubtedly thought the same.

Zhou Zui teased, "Yes, yes, yes, our Third Prince is peerless and invincible. How could anyone be your opponent? In my heart, you are the victor!"

"Why do your words make me feel so uncomfortable?" Zhou Xunchuan glared at Zhou Zui. Everyone burst into laughter, preparing to leave. The battle was over; there was nothing more to stay for.

"People of Tianqin!" Just as they were about to leave, a clear, cold male voice came from behind.
