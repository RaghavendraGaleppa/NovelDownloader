# Chapter 28: True Qi

After completing the initiation ceremony, Zhou Qing returned to his bamboo hut and slept for just two hours before waking up refreshed.

With a month and a half left before the start of the state academy, the time was neither long nor short. Zhou Qing planned to first consult Zhishan and the others about any issues he encountered while practicing the "Spring Revival Talisman Canon." Although they hadn't practiced it themselves, they had followed Fushan for many years.

As the saying goes, "If you haven't eaten pork, you've at least seen a pig run." Zhou Qing could certainly gain some insights from them.

Thanks to Zhishan's special methods, Hu the Butcher's injuries were stabilized and wouldn't be a concern for several months.

Zhou Qing thought to himself, "There should be a chance." With his diligence and the aid of the "Health Preservation System," he was confident that he could master the "Spring Revival Talisman Canon" to a level sufficient to treat Hu the Butcher's leg injury before the window for effective treatment closed.

After studying the "Spring Revival Talisman Canon," he deduced that he didn't need to reach the level of Master Fushan, who had annotated the text, to heal Hu's injury. The challenge lay in two areas: preparing the Black Jade Ointment and mastering the Crane Needle technique.

The Crane Needle was a unique acupuncture method in the "Spring Revival Talisman Canon" and the key to treating external injuries. However, mastering it required first practicing the Crane Form technique to develop the Crane Qi, which was necessary to perform the Crane Needle.

Having understood this, Zhou Qing began with the Crane Form technique. He first sketched rough outlines of the eight Crane Form postures on scrap paper based on the descriptions and annotations in the "Spring Revival Talisman Canon." He then took these sketches to Zhishan and the others.

"Little Uncle, you've drawn the Crane Form technique?" Zhishan asked with pleasant surprise.

"Yes, why?"

Zhishan's expression turned slightly bitter. "Little Uncle, Master actually created an illustrated manual for the Crane Form technique. But after he developed dementia, he burned it one day. It was one of his proudest achievements—compiling the scattered remnants of the 'Spring Revival Talisman Canon' into an illustrated manual to make it easier for future generations to learn. But he thought we were too old to benefit much from it, as it would only add another martial skill without focusing on its essence of healing. He intended to pass it on to a brilliant young disciple someday. But who would have thought..."

"In any case, Little Uncle being able to reconstruct the Crane Form manual must be fate," Zhishan concluded with a mix of sigh and joy.

"Whether it can be fully restored remains to be seen. These are just rough drafts. I need your help to fill in the details. Please don't leave anything out."

Zhishan and the other three nodded in agreement.

Fushan's four disciples—Zhishan, Zhishui, Zhijing, and Zhishou—embodied the Daoist ideals of "supreme goodness like water" and "tranquility and self-restraint."

Zhou Qing presented his understanding of the "Spring Revival Talisman Canon" and its annotations, along with his sketches of the Crane Form technique, for their feedback.

Originally, Fushan hadn't been the chosen successor for the sect leader. It was only after the internal strife in Qingfu Temple that he assumed the role. He had painstakingly reconstructed the fragmented "Spring Revival Talisman Canon" from ancient texts, filling in the gaps lost during the turmoil.

Zhishan and the others, limited by their aptitude, couldn't master the canon. If Zhou Qing succeeded, it would be of great significance to them, ensuring the tradition's continuation. Thus, they spared no effort in recalling details to assist him.

Through detailed inquiries and his own insights, Zhou Qing's sketches of the Crane Form technique grew increasingly refined. Drawing with his left hand on scrap paper, he demonstrated remarkable skill. Though he had only dabbled in drawing before, his proficiency had improved significantly since practicing the Tiger Play, which enhanced the dexterity of both hands.

At the "Proficient" level, the Tiger Play had elevated the flexibility of his left hand to a high degree, improving his drawing skills. He avoided using his right hand, which had become stronger and harder from practicing "Black Tiger Strikes the Heart," sacrificing some flexibility.

Later, Zhou Qing purchased proper drawing paper and returned to his courtyard to check on things. There was little to worry about—only the rooster and the old mulberry tree were unusual. If anyone intruded, it was unclear who should be more afraid.

Since burying the monk's body under the mulberry tree, the tree had grown cooler, and Zhou Qing could faintly sense a hint of affection from it. Was it an illusion? He often practiced his "Flicking Divine Skill" on the tree. Had feeding it a corpse won its favor? Did the "carrot and stick" approach work on trees? Regardless, Zhou Qing wasn't afraid—it couldn't move, at most startling the old servant.

Back at Qingfu Temple, Zhou Qing transferred the Crane Form technique to proper paper. With thorough preparation, his drawings were lifelike, even detailing muscle lines. Zhishan and the others were both delighted and wistful upon seeing them. Unlike Fushan's more abstract style, Zhou Qing's illustrations were realistic, making them more practical for training.

With preparations complete, Zhou Qing began practicing in earnest. After three days, the "Health Preservation System" displayed a new change:

**Five Animals Play (Basic):**  
- Tiger Play (Proficient) + Crane Form (Novice)  
- Deer Play (Proficient)  
- Bear Play (Basic)  
- Bird Play (Basic)  
- Monkey Play (Basic)  

**Martial Skills:**  
- Black Tiger Strikes the Heart (Proficient)  
- Flicking Divine Skill (Proficient)  
- Breeze Talisman Canon (Skilled)  

**Special Skills:**  
- Spring Revival Talisman Canon (Basic)  

**Elementary Alchemy (Novice)**  
**Literary Courage (Elementary)**  
**Remaining Lifespan: 37 years**  

The Crane Form appeared after the Tiger Play, with a "+" indicating potential fusion—though not yet possible. This surprised Zhou Qing. It seemed he needed to reach the "Proficient" level in the Crane Form before merging it with the Tiger Play. The "Health Preservation System" was guiding his training, and he looked forward to the new developments this fusion might bring.

After checking on Hu the Butcher, Zhou Qing returned to his courtyard for more private practice, feeling freer to train without restraint.

---

The Crane Form proved more challenging than Zhou Qing had anticipated. Every step, posture, and hand movement required precision, coordinated with specific breathing rhythms—any mistake would disrupt the flow. However, his reading-enhanced focus and sharp mind allowed him to steadily improve.

From "Novice" to "Basic," then to "Entry" level—just under ten days before the state academy began.

"The Crane Form is much harder than the Tiger Play," Zhou Qing mused. Though his "Elementary Literary Courage" prevented bottlenecks, the time investment was substantial. Still, after just over a month, he reached the "Entry" level, with an unexpected bonus:

**Remaining Lifespan: 39 years**  

The month of focused training had not only restored the lifespan consumed by studying the "Spring Revival Talisman Canon" but added an extra year. With the Crane Form only at "Entry," further improvements to "Skilled" and "Proficient" promised even greater benefits.

However, after a few more practice sessions, Zhou Qing noticed stagnation. The next step required mastering the "Crane Qi" to advance the Crane Form and learn the Crane Needle technique. He had expected this hurdle to come later but now faced it head-on.

This wasn't entirely unwelcome—mastering the Crane Needle and preparing the Black Jade Ointment would allow him to treat Hu the Butcher sooner. Immersed in training, Zhou Qing had become single-mindedly devoted, experiencing the addictive joy of cultivation, especially with the "Health Preservation System" providing tangible progress.

For guidance on the Crane Qi, Zhou Qing sought out Fushan's brother, Fusong.

---

"Junior Brother, I didn't expect you to reach the 'Entry' level in the Crane Form so quickly," Fusong greeted him at the door of his meditation room, his plump face even rounder than a month ago.

"How did you know, Senior Brother?" Zhou Qing asked, surprised.

Fusong smiled. "Each talisman canon has its unique characteristics after mastery. Having spent years with my brother, I recognized the signs in your footsteps and breathing. If I had trained the 'Taiyue True Form Talisman Canon' for my ears, I could even discern your heartbeat within ten paces."

"Impressive, Senior Brother. I've hit a snag with the Crane Qi mentioned in the Crane Form. I can't grasp it."

Fusong explained, "That's natural. The Crane Qi isn't an external force but an internal energy, invisible to the eye."

"Internal energy?"

"Martial arts divide into internal and external schools, but both ultimately aim to cultivate True Qi. The Crane Qi shares some traits with True Qi. Here, take a candle."

Zhou Qing noticed the abundance of candles in Fusong's room and fetched one.

Fusong extended two fingers and gently pointed at the candle from half an inch away. The candle snapped cleanly, as if sliced by a blade—yet his fingers never touched it.

Zhou Qing's mind raced with thoughts of legendary martial arts like the "One Yang Finger" or "Six Meridian Divine Sword."

"Senior Brother, was that the internal energy you mentioned?"

"Correct. Cultivating internal energy requires ample vitality. The Crane Form strengthens vitality internally. With time, you'll recover what you've lost."

"But without the Crane Qi, my progress is stalled. How can I replenish my vitality?" Zhou Qing asked, though he knew the Tiger and Deer Plays also helped, albeit less effectively.

"For most, this would be problematic. But not for you. You've taken tonics with your family's health exercises, haven't you?" Fusong referred to the Tiger Play and the Black Chicken Pills.

Zhou Qing nodded. "The tonics are mild, showing benefits over time."

"All medicine has toxicity. Long-term tonics are rare. But for the Crane Qi, you need something stronger. I have a 'Vitality Powder' recipe. Take it before training to temporarily boost your vitality, aiding your mastery of the Crane Qi. Once you have it, the Crane Needle will further enhance your Crane Form."

"Please share the recipe, Senior Brother." Zhou Qing now understood—the Crane Qi could be aided by medicine, though the "Spring Revival Talisman Canon" hadn't mentioned it.

Fusong seemed to read his thoughts. "The recipe is mine, derived from the 'Taiyue True Form Talisman Canon.' I wanted my brother to include it in the 'Spring Revival Talisman Canon' to aid cultivation. But he insisted on pure internal training, dismissing external aids. I disagree—results matter, not methods. He failed to reach the innate True Qi stage and succumbed to dementia. A pity."

With a long sigh, Fusong murmured, "We were both wrong, Brother."
