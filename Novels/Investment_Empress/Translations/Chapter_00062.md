Chapter 62: Maiden, Do You Want to Become Stronger?

"Yuanshi Tianzun!"

Jiang Chulong had never heard of this title before. However, in her understanding, the strongest beings in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands would have the character "Tian" added to their title.

For example, the Great Yu's founding emperor, Wu Di, was known as "Hong Tian".

Tianzun?

Wasn't that a title that commanded respect from the Nine Heavens, surpassing them?

The mere mention of this title was enough to demonstrate the man's unfathomable strength.

After all, it was rare for someone to dare to call themselves Tianzun; those who did were often met with misfortune.

Moreover, the title alone could cause a stir in the heavens, as if it was a harbinger of something extraordinary.

Could it be that he was even more powerful than the Nine Heavens?

If that were true, it would be terrifying!

"Drink some tea," the ethereal voice said, and the strange phenomenon in the world suddenly disappeared, as if it had all been an illusion.

Jiang Chulong's mind was blank, and she nodded mechanically.

As soon as the tea touched her lips, a pure and vibrant energy spread through her body.

She had seen this tea before; it was a tribute from a great sect in Zhongzhou, gifted to her siblings by the emperor, but not to her.

Her eldest brother, the crown prince, had pitied her and shared some with her.

Out of the corner of her eye, Jiang Chulong saw a spring nearby, and the mysterious man was using its water to brew tea.

"It is because I lost a ancient戒 (jie) many years ago that you are here," the Yuanshi Tianzun across from her said.

"Only those with great destiny and exceptional talent can resonate with it."

The Yuanshi Tianzun raised his tea cup, paused for a moment, and then began to play with it in his palm without drinking.

"So, it's because of the戒 (jie)..."

Jiang Chulong suddenly understood.

Great destiny? Exceptional talent?

"I-I don't think I'm the one you're looking for, Tianzun senior," Jiang Chulong said, her small head bowed, almost burying her face in her chest.

Her birth had caused her mother's death, and as a result, she had been disliked by the Emperor Jing Tai since she was young, to the point of being almost hated.

She had grown up not knowing that she was unloved, thinking that every royal child lived in a cold palace without new clothes.

Even on the emperor's birthday, a day of universal celebration, she had snuck in to catch a glimpse of her father, only to turn the grand feast into a scene of execution.

The palace maid who had inadvertently revealed the truth to her was later executed by being torn apart limb by limb, her eyes fixed on Jiang Chulong with a gaze that seemed to bleed.

As for talent...

Talent?

She had never practiced martial arts, and no one dared to teach her.

She knew that without the bone taken from her chest, she was not a genius.

Her eldest brother, the crown prince, who possessed the true dragon body and had obtained the bone, was likely the true genius.

"Hehehe, little girl, are you doubting my judgment?" the Yuanshi Tianzun asked.

"N-no, how dare I..."

"Jiang Chulong, the youngest daughter of Emperor Jing Tai," the Yuanshi Tianzun continued in a calm and soothing voice.

Jiang Chulong was taken aback.

She had not introduced herself; how did the Tianzun senior know her name?

"Born with a sword fetus, bearing the Tianzun Imperial Sword Bone, but taken away by your kin," the Yuanshi Tianzun said.

"Now, you are being hunted by the Xun Tian Wei."

Jiang Chulong's mouth fell open.

How did the Tianzun senior know all this?

She herself did not even know the name of the bone that had been taken from her chest.

"Tianzun Imperial Sword Bone..."

"This title, Yuanshi Tianzun..."

It was because of this that she had been summoned.

"Being able to obtain the ancient戒 (jie) and stand before me, how can it not be considered great destiny?" the Yuanshi Tianzun said.

"But... but I no longer have that bone," Jiang Chulong said, biting her lip until it turned white.

"This is a good thing," the Yuanshi Tianzun said calmly.

"Ah?"
