# Chapter 182: Xiaofan Chooses a Sister-in-Law, the Madam Conducts Business

Upon first arriving in the Prefecture City, the sight was one of magnificent palaces and countless gates, bustling with extraordinary liveliness. Merchants on the streets hung red lanterns and festive decorations, while the crowd flowed like a woven tapestry of people.

The sounds of hawking and selling goods filled the ears without cease.

The alleyway was damp and smelled of fish. The Prefecture City’s fish market was receiving its catch, all river fish. Madam Wen frowned slightly and quickened her pace. Li Xian, holding Bai Yun’s hand, followed from behind.

Once they turned out of the alley, she asked, "Madam, where are we staying? At an inn?"

"No need," Madam Wen said as she walked. "I have several mansions in the Prefecture City. We can just pick one to live in."

The Prefecture City was vast. Li Xian, in both his past and current lives, had never seen such a large city. Not far along, rows upon rows of wine towers stood where young nobles and daughters of aristocratic clans drank and toasted, chatting happily about interesting affairs.

He couldn't help but sigh in admiration: "These buildings are truly tall. This world is filled with strange and wondrous things. There is wood strong enough to support hundred-zhang tall buildings, and construction techniques that rival the creations of heaven."

Among these, the "Heaven’s Pride Tower Banquet" was a frequent topic of conversation.

Passing by a wine tower, he heard a conversation from upstairs: "This Tower Banquet is going to be spectacular. I heard that the renowned forging master Ouyezi from the Yu'nan Dao passed through here a few days ago."

"He heard about this grand youth event and wanted to add to the excitement, using a 'Sinking River Sword' as the prize. Whoever shines the brightest and overwhelms the others can take the sword!"

"Really? Ouyezi is incredibly powerful. The artifacts he forges are exquisitely unmatched and contain mysterious powers. I heard that over a decade ago, he even participated in the forging of the divine sword 'Heaven and Earth Traceless'."

"This is no falsehood. That 'Sinking River Sword' has a great reputation. Many prodigies from outside the Prefecture City have heard of it and are rushing here to attend the banquet and claim the sword."

"I bet that 'Sinking River Sword' will definitely be won by Young Master Zhou Shijie. He is talented in both literature and martial arts, with a handsome and unparalleled appearance. Truly, a fine sword matching a noble young master."

"That Young Master Zhou already has someone he loves. Is it true? Rumor has it she is a woman from the Government Academy."

"Speaking of appearance and virtue, I think of someone. Is that evil lieutenant Li Xian really disfigured and extremely ugly?"

"This is definitely true; someone saw it with their own eyes. They also said this man bullies men and women, acting ruthlessly. In the lower county jurisdictions, he is completely lawless and unchecked. In my opinion, he is just a character from a small place. If he comes to our Prefecture City, we’ll let him know the immensity of heaven and earth."

"That evil lieutenant Li Xian, a minor martial lieutenant from a remote county. Yet on the Hero List, his ranking isn't low; he is number forty-four. If he were a bit higher or lower, it would be fine. But he just happens to压了 the 'Seven Mountain Sect's' young master by one spot."

"That young master has a violent temper; he will definitely cause trouble for him. By then, the forty-fourth prodigy will likely die a miserable death."

**Prefecture City.**
**Han Yue Residence.**

This was the Madam’s private estate, covering more than ten acres. The vermilion paint was fresh, and the location was excellent. The Madam used to frequent the Prefecture City several years ago, which is why she bought this mansion for convenience.

However, over the past two years, the Madam’s "Silk Garment Jade Confusion Art" had hit a bottleneck, on the verge of breaking through but unable to do so. This technique prefers stillness over movement, like a winter silkworm lying in the snow. Thus, the Madam rarely came to the Prefecture City, but every October, she would spare time to make a trip.

When Li Xian first entered the Yi He Manor, the Madam was in the Prefecture City.

Now, the Silk Garment Jade Confusion Art is about to break through its barrier. Once this matter is settled and she goes into seclusion a few more times, she will break the bottleneck.

"The servants usually maintain this courtyard, but the living quarters need cleaning," Madam Wen said, crossing the courtyard gate and pointing to the distant rooms. "Clean up two rooms and choose one for yourself."

"Since we are in the Prefecture City, it’s rare for you to have the chance to broaden your horizons. Go ahead and explore on your own."

"Here is money, containing a hundred taels of silver. Use it sparingly, and it should last you a few days."

Li Xian took the brocade pouch; it was heavy with a hundred taels of silver. He asked, "Madam, and you are..."

"I have my own matters to attend to," Madam Wen replied. She turned and left, boarding a carriage. She lifted a corner of the curtain, glanced at Li Xian, then let the curtain fall. The carriage drove away.

Madam Wen drove away from the Han Yue Residence, heading straight for the center of the Prefecture City. Since she rarely came here, she needed to oversee the business operations in the Prefecture City.

Three Silkworm Cloud Pavilions, four Fragrant Cosmetic Shops, two Precious Water Pavilions, and seven Mellow Dream Kilns.

The Silkworm Cloud Pavilions sold fabrics, the Fragrant Cosmetic Shops sold cosmetics, the Precious Water Pavilions were restaurants with rich and delicious dishes, and the Mellow Dream Kilns produced wine.

The Madam’s business was spread throughout the Prefecture. Prefecture City, county jurisdictions, and major cities—all had traces of her operations. The daily income was incalculable. Among the many industries, the Prefecture City operations were the main source of revenue.

The Silkworm Cloud Pavilions, Fragrant Cosmetic Shops, Precious Water Pavilions, and Mellow Dream Kilns, when viewed across the Prefecture City, had gold-generating capabilities that ranked among the top. Lin Guolong, having served as the County Magistrate of Qingning County, inevitably had contact with the Yi He Manor and knew the Madam was involved in businesses like "clothing" and "wine." He knew she had several properties in the Prefecture City and possessed immense financial power, but his knowledge was limited to the specifics.

Lin Aoshan had been to Qingning County. Fearing she would clash with the Broken Sword Madam, Lin Guolong had told her about the Madam early on. Lin Aoshan also knew the Madam had industries in the Prefecture City, but she wasn't clear on the details either.

No one knew... that the Silkworm Cloud Pavilions, Fragrant Cosmetic Shops, Precious Water Pavilions, and Mellow Dream Kilns were all in the hands of one person. Madam Wen had a detached temperament; she wasn't flashy nor low-key, but her actions were ruthless.

Therefore, the name "Broken Sword Madam" was known to very few in the Prefecture City. Those who knew had already suffered losses and were even less willing to spread the word.

The carriage stopped.

Madam Wen, dressed in white as snow, first visited the Silkworm Cloud Pavilion. This building was a hundred zhang tall, towering majestically. It primarily sold silk garments; precious silk fabrics were even sold via auction.

Prices remained high.

In addition, silk materials had a wide range of uses, involved in机关道 (Mechanism Path), Medical Path, Martial Path, and Forging.

There were many women in the building, like a chorus of orioles and swallows, creating a beautiful scenery.

**Han Yue Residence.**

After Li Xian finished tidying the rooms, he strolled around the courtyard. The courtyard was filled with green trees and red flowers, and the flower beds were gorgeous. He finished the tour quickly and found an open space to practice his martial arts alone.

*Proficiency +1*
*Proficiency +1*

Accumulating water forms a deep pool.

Little by little, progress is made.

Li Xian, having just arrived in the Prefecture City, knew that the hidden enemies here were not comparable to the three halls and two sects of Qingning County. His knowledge was limited, and his information channels were blocked; he had no way to "know the enemy." He could only "know himself" and be clear about his own strength.

So he sorted it out in his heart.

Martial arts at the **Peak of Perfection**: Four Directions Fist, Breeze Leg, Great Luo Blade, Jade Green Palm, Ascending Cloud Hand, Iron Copper Body...

Martial arts at **Perfection**: First Level of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword.
Martial arts at **Great Completion**: Second Level of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword, Gang Thunder Finger.

Nine martial arts, all with profound attainment. Each martial art accumulated internal energy, bestowed special powers, and领悟ed unique characteristics. Putting them all together, he should be enough to rival the average prodigy of the Prefecture City.

Li Xian thought: "Now that the Prefecture City is full of hidden dangers, I still don't know the Madam's true intentions. Calculating the time, today is October 17th. There are still a few days until the Tower Banquet."

"It is right to be careful, but since it's rare to be in the Prefecture City, how can I not walk around? Rumors are spreading in the Prefecture City, and most commoners don't know what I look like."

He had made up his mind to tour the Prefecture City tomorrow. He would inquire about the direction of the Government Academy and see Xiaofan.

The Madam did not return all night.

**The next day.**

Li Xian traveled lightly. He used cosmetics to cover the red mole on his forehead, tied his long hair up, and wore a copper hair crown. Looking fresh and handsome, he went out onto the street.

The Prefecture City was vast, with buildings standing in rows. Even holding a map, it was hard to find one's way clearly for a while. Fortunately, the **Qingyuan Government Academy** was famous. By asking anyone and offering some money, they would be willing to lead the way personally. Soon, he arrived outside the Academy.

The Government Academy was a place for studying literature.

In the vast Qingyuan Prefecture City, countless sons of aristocratic families, if they were not good at martial arts or had poor bone structure, were sent to the Government Academy to study literature.

If they could grasp a thread of fortune, they could still be utilized by the family.

"Brother!"

In front of the Government Academy.

Li Xiaofan heard a classmate shout that his brother was looking for him. He immediately put down his book and ran out of the Academy.

Not seeing him for a year, he had grown much taller, with a delicate face and fair skin. The food at the Government Academy was good; he hadn't been treated poorly.

"Xiaofan!" Li Xian was overjoyed and patted Xiaofan's shoulder. Li Xiaofan looked up, stood on tiptoe to compare heights: "Ah Brother, you are so tall now! So handsome!"

"Hahaha." Li Xian saw that Xiaofan was much fairer and knew his life was good, which made him very happy. "Come, we brothers haven't seen each other for a long time. Let's go eat something together."

"Wait a moment," Li Xiaofan said. "I've entered the Government Academy and made many good friends. Brother, I'll introduce them to you."

Li Xiaofan teased: "Brother, there is a great beauty in our Academy. She is the same age as you and has a huge background. Shall I introduce you to her?"

"You little brat, you're really thinking about your brother's lifelong大事 (major life event)," Li Xian sighed. "But for the time being, your brother isn't considering it."

The Madam's favor is hard to say whether it's good or bad. It seems like a limitless future, blooming with flowers, accompanied by a beautiful woman. Yet it is also confusing, not up to oneself, full of hidden dangers, like being trapped in a cage.

"Brother, don't be so reserved," Li Xiaofan laughed. "It's quite a coincidence. That Miss Gu has some connection with my master. I've met her a few times and discussed studies with her. She praised me for being smart and treated me okay, though she is a bit proud. I mentioned to her that I have an older brother. She just smiled and didn't say much. Brother, seize the opportunity well; it's not impossible."

Li Xian said: "In two years, you won't be young either. Find someone for yourself!"

"It won't work," Li Xiaofan said. "My master said that those with the Ruler's Fortune rarely have descendants. Besides, I spend all day researching学问 (scholarship); lust can be cast aside."

Li Xian's expression changed. Li Xiaofan quickly changed the subject: "So, Brother, the Li family needs you to carry on the lineage."

Li Xian fell silent. Seeing the brightness in Xiaofan's eyes, he had already grasped his ambition. Since that was the case, what more needed to be said? He could only support him silently.

Li Xian said: "Let's talk about this later. Call over your close friends; I'll treat them to a meal."

"Okay!" Li Xiaofan ran off.

A good while later, Li Xiaofan ran back quickly, followed by three people. They had ordinary looks, two tall and one short, all wearing cloth clothes with patches of various sizes. A trace of pride remained between their brows, but their shoulders were hunched, their eyes lifeless, and they lacked confidence.

Their situation was humble.

Li Xian thought: "It seems that in the Government Academy, children of ordinary families are not treated well. The people Xiaofan befriends are not like rich kids; they must have been ostracized, which is why they coincidentally became friends."

"Brother Xian."

The three people saw Li Xian and stepped forward in unison, bowing respectfully. Their manners were impeccable. On the way here, Li Xiaofan had told them to just call him 'Brother'.

Li Xian smiled: "Hello, everyone!"

The three were named Lu Xuan, Hong Chengbing, and Liu Shu. They were all selected from lower counties and towns to study literature at the Government Academy.

"Xiaofan, your brother is so handsome," Lu Xuan said enviously.

"Truly good, your brother can come see you," Liu Shu said.

Li Xiaofan smiled: "Naturally."

Li Xian said: "Let's go. I'm treating you; I'll take you to eat something delicious."
