Among the second-grade pills, many were used to consolidate one's foundation. Back when refining the Mystic Jade Marrow, Wang Chan had already consumed several of them—they proved remarkably effective.

As for talismans, there were quite a few second-grade lower-tier varieties for offense, defense, flight, and auxiliary purposes. Wang Chan selected what he needed and stored them separately in his sleeves.

Fu Yuejun struggled against his grip, tears streaming down her face until she finally gave up resisting, reduced to hoarse sobs.

Zhao Yanqiu traced the name carved on the tombstone over and over, her chest aching violently as if split open by a gust of icy wind that left her doubled over in pain.

Leng Moxi crouched and searched carefully until, through persistence, she found white powder hidden in a crevice between rocks. She dipped her finger in it, sniffed, and was about to taste it when a large hand stopped her.
