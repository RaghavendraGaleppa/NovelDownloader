# Chapter 7: Flying Hairy Leg

Li Haomiao’s lips curled up. Even with his composure, he couldn't help but mutter, "If something is truly dug out from inside, it is our great fortune."

"Vixen, vixen. It seems I am destined to become your nemesis. I will definitely restore the glory of the Li family to the Great Zhou."

Ignoring the buffs Li Haomiao was stacking on himself, Xu Yunfan hesitated for a moment and decided to back out. This thing looked extremely sinister. With his proficiency system, he could live well doing anything, so there was no need to take such a risk.

Seeing Xu Yunfan turning to leave, Li Haomiao said, "If you leave, once the Ancient Source Jade Wall leaks out, the entire Ningguta will need to be buried with it. Everyone will die, especially those who have seen the Ancient Source Jade Wall. Even if you manage to escape this mine cave by luck, given that vixen's temperament, she will hunt you to the ends of the earth and burn your bones to ash."

The Ancient Source Jade Wall was too important; it was worth sacrificing the entire Ningguta for it.

Xu Yunfan stopped his footsteps, fell silent for a moment, and turned to look at Li Haomiao.

"Teach me another martial art. I want a movement technique."

Li Haomiao’s eyes flashed, and he nodded without any hesitation.

"I have a martial art called 'Flying Hairy Leg.' If you practice it to perfection, you can run like a swift horse, your body as light as a swallow. Ordinary people can hardly catch a glimpse of your back."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but say, "Don't you have any martial arts with a more grand-sounding name? Flying Hairy Leg, really..."

Although the Copper Body Art could sense the concept of 'copper skin' upon perfection from the General Martial Arts Compendium, the memories of the martial art's entry only involved honing his own body and enduring beatings with wooden sticks and leather whips. The process was so arduous that even thinking about the memories injected by the system made him feel exceptionally bitter.

Li Haomiao didn't even lift his eyelids.

"I have other martial arts, but there are no conditions to practice them here. For example, the top-tier light footwork of the Dao Sect, 'Shrinking the Earth into Inches.' If practiced to the extreme, you can chase the wind and lightning, taking a step that covers three li in the blink of an eye. But to practice it, you need secret medicines配合, use special massage techniques to activate the muscles and tendons in your legs, and then apply precious medicines. It costs no less than a thousand taels of silver a day, and you also have to endure the extreme pain of muscles and tendons reshaping, bones shattering and then recovering."

He looked up at Xu Yunfan: "Besides that, you need to read the Daoist Canon thoroughly, understand the principles, and have extremely high comprehension to understand 'Shrinking the Earth into Inches' within the principles of the I Ching. The Dao Sect has a legacy of two thousand years, but those who can cultivate it are few and far between. Without exception, it takes ten years to enter the doorway, and a hundred years to take shape."

Xu Yunfan raised his hand: "Alright, stop talking. Tell me about the Flying Hairy Leg instead."

Li Haomiao naturally knew that Xu Yunfan wouldn't give anything without seeing the benefit. He immediately explained the practice formulas and force generation methods of the Flying Hairy Leg in detail.

An hour later, watching Xu Yunfan practicing the stepping movements, Li Haomiao couldn't help but say, "You really remembered all of it?"

"Naturally. When I'm in good condition, I have a photographic memory."

Xu Yunfan looked at the Flying Hairy Leg practice prompt appearing in his vision, and the grey state of 'Un入门 Flying Hairy Leg' popping up on his attribute panel, feeling delighted in his heart. After the Copper Body Art entered the doorway and his blood energy became active, practicing other martial arts seemed to be a little easier.

Li Haomiao opened his mouth, then turned to say: "In that case, let's continue digging."

"Really no danger?"

"No. It might even be a great opportunity for you."

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. He swung the pickaxe continuously, digging away large chunks of stone, and then a jade wall the height of a person appeared before his eyes.

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted. Vaguely, he saw what seemed to be a black shadow within the Ancient Source Jade Wall.

"Are there really immortals in this world?"

Li Haomiao remained silent for a moment, then said: "Perhaps there are. There are people in this world born with true blood. Legend says it is the bloodline of true immortals, but it cannot be verified."

Speaking of this, his expression became slightly dazed.

"I now understand why the Mine Supervision Office organized a mine cave under Ningguta and placed it under their direct jurisdiction. Perhaps the key... someone is coming."

Xu Yunfan, who had only heard half of it, understood immediately and quickly used broken stones to cover up the jade wall that was over a person's height again.

Li Haomiao, although crippled, still had sharp hearing and could detect many movements that Xu Yunfan couldn't.

He changed direction and began to mine silently.

*Thud! Thud! Thud!*

Even Xu Yunfan heard the movement outside this branch mine tunnel.

The approaching footsteps were heavy, as if carrying a thousand jun of force. Every step landed on the ground with a dull thud. Each muffled sound seemed to step heavily on the heart, making it feel stifled.

Xu Yunfan sidestepped, his entire body tense, gripping the pickaxe tightly, his eyes fixed unblinkingly on the mine tunnel entrance.

Under the illumination of the firelight, a figure that seemed to almost fill the entire mine tunnel channel appeared.

He was tall and broad, like a towering iron tower. His wide shoulders and thick back, and strong muscles were faintly visible under his tight-fitting upper garment. Every step taken by those thick legs seemed as if it would stamp a deep pit into the ground. He exuded a powerful aura from his body, suffocating like dark clouds pressing down.

Li Haomiao said in a low voice: "At least a lower-tier martial art perfected. With such momentum, it should be a skin-tempering master."

When Xu Yunfan saw the person's face clearly, his heart tightened.

This guy was the foreman leader who had split that young boy in half with a single whip back then.

Yang Gan.

Yang Gan glanced casually at Xu Yunfan, who was in the corner, and then moved his gaze to Li Haomiao, who was lying quietly by the side with his eyes closed.

He grinned, revealing jagged teeth.

"Your Highness the Prince of Yan is quite elegant. Does Your Highness eat well and sleep well here?"

So he wasn't looking for him.

Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed slightly. Naturally, he would shrink his head and act like a background character.

Li Haomiao opened his eyes. His gaze was calm, carrying a kind of elegance that Xu Yunfan had never seen before, as if he were looking at a country bumpkin.

"The food is lacking. Does Captain Yang have any way to solve this?"

Looking at Li Haomiao's condescending, indifferent gaze, Yang Gan's eyes flashed with anger, and he let out a series of 'hehehe' laughs.

"The Great Zhou royal family, who once stood high above, looking down on the common people, have all fallen to this state, waiting to die. The drama of life is truly an eye-opener."

As Yang Gan spoke, he took out a porcelain bottle from his chest.

"This is a Grain-Dispelling Pill. Your Highness the Prince of Yan should know how to use it, right?"

Seeing Yang Gan's actions, Li Haomiao's expression became subtle. After a moment of silence, he spoke slowly.

"Who sent you?"

Yang Gan said: "I don't know. I just follow the superior's instructions. They said you cannot die, but you can only stay under Ningguta."

Hearing this, Li Haomiao stopped asking further and just said: "You can leave now."

Yang Gan's gaze lingered on Li Haomiao, and finally moved to Xu Yunfan.

In an instant, Xu Yunfan felt an extremely cold chill penetrate his body. The malice that enveloped his entire being made all his muscles tense up.

The other party wanted to kill him!

"This person is useful to me," Li Haomiao said in a low voice, carrying a hint of displeasure.
