Chapter 327: The King of Posers

The carriage and horses slowly entered the Seventy-Two Districts. The shafts, crafted from green sandalwood, rolled over the stone-paved road, producing a deep, resonant sound.

The four Snow-Maned Dragon Steeds pulling the carriage had hoofbeats like thunder. Bronze bells hanging from their necks swayed with each step, producing a pleasant, melodious chime that echoed through the air.

As the bell chimes faded, the originally noisy training ground grew noticeably quieter.

A swordsman crouching under a tea shed while gnawing on a meat bone choked and hurriedly patted his chest. A bearded man, who had been boasting about his "Thirteen Chain-Link Saber Technique," suddenly fell silent, his wine bowl crashing onto the table. Even the two warriors clashing on the arena platform simultaneously withdrew their attacks and retreated, looking toward the street corner with suspicion and alarm.

"Why would the Dao Sect people come to the Seventy-Two Districts?"

Someone whispered in a low voice, their fingers unconsciously stropping the tattered cloth strips wrapped around their saber handle, clearly nervous.

Within the Seventy-Two Districts of the Imperial Capital, mostly commoners resided. The six major sects of the Great Zhou rarely set foot in these places.

An old martial artist wearing a bamboo hat squinted his eyes beside him. "Look at the dark patterns on the carriage shaft. It's a true disciple of the Qingwei Mountain of the Dao Sect. That qualification is reserved only for the true disciples of the Dao Sect Master's lineage!"

Before his voice faded, a collective gasp swept through the surroundings.

Several burly martial artists who had been sitting with their chests exposed hurriedly tightened their clothes.

Most puzzling was the black-canopied carriage at the rear of the convoy.

The moment the carriage curtain was lifted by the wind, the temperature of the entire street seemed to rise by three degrees.

A silhouette could be faintly seen sitting inside.

The crowd parted like a tide, clearing a path ten meters wide.

Several experienced old martial artists changed expressions. The Seventy-Two Districts training platform was traditionally a place for rogue cultivators to make a name for themselves. By convention, true disciples of the Dao Sect should go directly to the Imperial Examination Academy to participate in the final martial arts examination.

Such a grand display now... could it be...

"Damn it, even the Dao Sect has started competing with the underlings for food."

Someone lamented incessantly.

The moment Xu Yunfan stepped down from the carriage, the entire long street fell silent instantly.

The indigo robe was lifted by the wind, revealing the dark golden luster of the Dragon Scale Armor underneath. The Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammers at his waist swayed with low, muffled echoes. The Sky Piercing Cloud Piercing Bow slung diagonally across his left shoulder was wrapped in some brocade cloth, but it couldn't hide the spiritual energy seeping from the tip of the bow.

Most intimidating was the Red Fire Devouring Dragon Cane slung diagonally across his back. The dragon patterns coiled around the cane body writhed like living creatures under the sunlight, and dragon eyes opening and closing seemed to spark with lightning.

"D-Dao Sect true disciple?! Why so many divine weapons?!"

A martial artist in the crowd cried out in shock, the tea bowl in his hand smashing to pieces on the ground.

The spectators who had originally crowded in front of the arena unconsciously took three steps back, forcibly clearing a path.

Several bearers wearing the emblem of the Four Seas Escort Agency turned pale. The Wild Bull Strength technique they cultivated, when sensing the fluctuations automatically emanating from the Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammers, actually dispersed on its own, and their knees went weak uncontrollably.

When Xu Yunfan got off the carriage, he glanced at these bearers.

They should be from the Maitreya Temple.

Everyone stared at Xu Yunfan's back standing against the light, and in a daze, it seemed as if they were seeing a god of war descending into the world.

But Xu Yunfan didn't think so.

Awkward, embarrassing!

He had no other word for it but embarrassment. At this moment, he even somewhat missed Su Zhenhe, the King of Posers. If he were being watched by so many people, that guy should be feeling extremely satisfied in his heart.

What a pity he died young.

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly.

His expression was cold and indifferent, his eyes seeming to flow with cold stars. A faint, almost imperceptible energy fluctuation lingered around him. With every step he took, fine cracks silently appeared on the bluestone ground.

The poser level was truly sufficient!

It was just a bit degrading.

Xu Yunfan sighed to himself.

The surrounding Dao Sect disciples unconsciously held their breath. Led by Chen Hong, they parted a straight path for him.

No one dared to meet his gaze. The oppressive aura emanating from this newly promoted secondary true disciple of the Dao Sect Master's lineage even caused the vital blood of several weaker fellow disciples to stagnate, with fine sweat beading at their temples.

The moment Xu Yunfan stepped into the waiting area, the originally noisy clamor stopped abruptly.

The dozens of warriors waiting to go on stage felt as if struck by lightning. Someone's tea cup smashed to pieces on the ground, brown tea splashing onto their trouser legs, yet they remained oblivious. In a corner, a burly man carrying a pair of swords suddenly stiffened his spine, his knuckles turning white from excessive force.

Even more so, due to extreme nervousness, someone subconsciously reached for the weapon at their waist, but upon meeting Xu Yunfan's sweeping gaze, they retracted their hand as if electrocuted. That gaze made them feel as if they had fallen into an ice cave.

"Dao Sect... true disciple?!"

Someone squeezed out a few words with a dry voice, their Adam's apple bobbing as they swallowed the rest of the question.

Everyone remained silent, not daring to make any move.

"Dao Sect's Xu Yunfan, mount the stage!"

The arena referee shouted loudly, his voice piercing through the clamor, and the entire training ground fell silent instantly.

Xu Yunfan slowly stepped onto the bluestone platform, his steps steady as if a mountain were shifting.

The gaze of the nameless swordsman lingered on Xu Yunfan for a moment, his pupils contracting imperceptibly.

The nameless swordsman's fingertips unconsciously stroked the scabbard. The mottled,枯木-like scabbard transmitted a piercing chill, but at this moment, that chill couldn't suppress the cold sweat seeping from his spine.

Who in their right mind would wear a full set of divine weapons to a martial arts competition among rogue cultivators here?

"Begin!"

The arena referee shouted loudly.

The nameless swordsman took a deep breath and suddenly raised his hand.

"I concede."

The three words were crisp and decisive, the voice hoarse yet clear, silencing the noisy training ground in an instant.

A commotion erupted below the stage!

"What's going on? Sun Bing, the Heart-Withering Swordsman, actually surrendered without a fight?!"

"What do you know! That Xu Yunfan is clad in a full set of divine weapons. Just standing there, his aura alone is suffocating..."

"But wasn't Sun Bing a fierce character who slew seven pursuit envoys three years ago? How could he..."

Sun Bing paid no attention to the discussions around him. He just gave Xu Yunfan a deep look, the corner of his mouth under his cloak twisting into a bitter smile.

He recognized that aura.

Three years ago, he had seen a Ninth Realm Grandmaster make a move from afar in Yanbei Dao. And the aura surrounding Xu Yunfan now was exactly the same as that one!

Moreover, Xu Yunfan stood still like an abyss, his aura around him as solid as a mountain. His indigo robe moved without wind, his spine straight as if supporting the heavens.

Just this standing posture alone made the surrounding air feel as heavy as lead.

This swordsman only felt his chest tighten, as if being choked by an invisible giant hand, even his bones creaking under this pressure.

"This battle is meaningless... How can a person be so powerful? Are you really under thirty?"

He murmured, then turned and leaped off the arena platform. His gray hemp cloak billowed in the wind, and he disappeared into the crowd in the blink of an eye.

This imperial examination was limited to those under thirty, and Xu Yunfan was naturally当之无愧 (worthy of the title).

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow slightly but didn't stop him.

In seven consecutive battles, not a single person dared to take three moves from Xu Yunfan.

Whenever that indigo figure stepped onto the arena, the opponent would feel as if struck by lightning. Someone's weapon would clang to the ground, someone would stumble backward and knock over the railings, and even more so, someone would shout "I concede" before the referee could even announce the start.
