# Chapter 9: Night Exploration of the Child-Giving Temple

Several days later.

A cold wind swept across the wilderness, piercing through the mountains.

Before the gates of the Child-Giving Temple.

Xiao Ji stood with his sword strapped to his back.

The place was remote, and the temple was small, yet devotees still came here to pray. Most were villagers from settlements about ten li away from the temple.

Within a ten-li radius of the temple, there were eight villages.

The villagers needed labor, so they bore many children, which was why people came to worship at the Child-Giving Temple every day.

The temple's business was far better than that of the Primordial Spirit Temple in the center of Willow Town, much to the envy of other Taoist priests.

Though the villages were some distance away, the Child-Giving Temple was situated on a small hill beside the intersection of three main roads, making it relatively convenient to reach—one of the reasons people were willing to make the journey.

Entering the temple, Xiao Ji wandered around, striking up conversations with the devotees.

"Ah, eight months along—you should move around less."

"The girl in your belly is quite lively."

"The old saying about sour for boys and spicy for girls isn't accurate. You say you crave sour things, but you're clearly carrying a girl... A child is a child, whether boy or girl..."

Before long, a young medicine apprentice, no more than ten years old, came to inquire: "Young Taoist, are you here to see my master? The old man went traveling to treat patients the day before yesterday and isn't at the temple today."

[One of Physician Xue's disciples. No cultivation base. Proficient in pharmacology. Tasked with guarding the Child-Giving Temple. Main duty: preventing people from entering the rear courtyard, especially the main house, and ensuring the captive infant spirits do not approach the living. Anyone who forcibly enters the main house will be poisoned to death.]

[He is testing your intentions. If you claim to be an acquaintance of Physician Xue, you will be poisoned, as Physician Xue has instructed that all who claim to seek him are to be treated as enemies and served poison.]

Xiao Ji had already gathered some understanding of the Child-Giving Temple.

From this brief interaction, it was clear there was something suspicious about the main house in the rear courtyard.

The medicine apprentice appeared polite and well-mannered, leaving a favorable impression. But Xiao Ji knew that Physician Xue was a sinister healer, and his disciples were unlikely to be virtuous.

Just look at the information he had obtained—these people would poison and kill at the slightest provocation.

No wonder they left a mere apprentice in charge—their method of killing was poison.

"This humble Taoist is merely passing through your esteemed temple. All Taoist temples are one family under heaven. Hearing of this place, I came to pay my respects, and perhaps beg for a bowl of water, a meal, and a night's lodging. I shall leave tomorrow," Xiao Ji feigned the demeanor of a wandering Taoist, his tone amiable. "Only after asking around did I learn that there are no Taoists here—just a physician overseeing the temple."

The medicine apprentice briefly explained the situation, agreed to let him stay, and laid down some rules—no wandering about without permission. Once finished, the apprentice went about his other duties.

Xiao Ji's purpose in coming here was simple: to investigate the Child-Giving Temple and locate the One-Stringed Lute.

If this place was a den of danger, he wouldn't risk his life for treasure. He would simply leave quietly and report it to the authorities, leading the officials of the Demon-Suppression Bureau to eradicate it.

But if Physician Xue's strength proved inferior to his own, then he could afford to be bolder.

After lighting the lamps.

Xiao Ji decided to wait until midnight before exploring the temple.

He still had over two hours to wait.

Before beginning his search, a thought occurred to him: If he used his perception ability on himself, could he foresee the outcome of his actions tonight?

So, he sat before a bronze mirror, embracing himself. After a while, he placed his hands on his face, shoulders, and chest... attempting to divine whether his investigation tonight would go smoothly.

In theory, he could perceive the trajectory of all things in the world for the next three days. Though the causality of the world was ever-changing and not always accurate, as long as no external forces intervened, the predicted outcome would remain unchanged.

Yet, no matter how hard he tried to perceive himself, he couldn't grasp a definitive result.

One moment, it was outcome A; the next, it was outcome B—changing at an alarming speed.

"Perhaps because I possess the ability to perceive the hidden truths of all things, my own outcome is difficult to predict. Or maybe I simply cannot predict myself, because my variables are too great."

Xiao Ji consoled himself with this reasoning.

[Behind you, just three meters away, a disciple of the Child-Giving Temple is watching you through a crack in the window. Seeing you staring into a bronze mirror in the dead of night while embracing and caressing yourself, he is deeply unsettled, convinced you are a sinister practitioner like his master.]

Upon receiving this information, Xiao Ji didn't turn around immediately.

He had to pretend he hadn't noticed.

Coming to spy on him at this hour likely meant they wanted to confirm whether he truly was just a passing guest.

The disciple left but returned within minutes, knocking on Xiao Ji's door.

"Taoist, are you asleep?" the apprentice asked cautiously from outside. "I was too busy during the day and forgot to prepare food and wine for you. I've brought some now."

"It's still early—I haven't retired yet." Xiao Ji opened the door to find the apprentice holding a food box.

Inside were two vegetable dishes, a stewed chicken, a small bottle of wine, and a bowl of rice.

The hospitality was decent.

The food was merely a pretext—the real purpose was to get a closer look inside Xiao Ji's room, as the view through the window crack had been too limited.

The apprentice mustered his courage to enter but found nothing amiss. He soon excused himself and left.

Xiao Ji checked the food and wine—no poison.

---

That even a mere apprentice was this cautious, repeatedly probing his background... Xiao Ji had yet to encounter the true powerhouses of the cultivation world, but he was already experiencing its dangers.

In such a world, even with extraordinary abilities, one had to tread carefully.

After his meal, Xiao Ji waited until midnight.

The apprentice and his junior brother kept watch outside the guest room.

"Senior Brother, this Taoist is suspicious. Why not just poison him and be done with it? This stakeout is exhausting—I can barely keep my eyes open."

"Master said we can't kill indiscriminately. As long as the guest isn't an old acquaintance of his or here to steal, we should avoid unnecessary trouble. Master dislikes complications."

"Senior Brother, have you ever been inside Master's room? What's in there?"

"How could you even think that? Have you forgotten the poison in our stomachs? If you want to die, don't drag me down. Or have you forgotten what happened to the senior brothers who pried into Master's secrets and ended up as ingredients for medicinal stew?"

"Understood. I'll be more careful."

"Master will return in a few days. As long as we don't make mistakes, we'll get the antidote... As for this wandering Taoist, as long as he doesn't cause trouble, we'll leave him be."

The two apprentices eventually left.

Xiao Ji stepped out, skirting the walls and keeping to the shadows as he explored the temple room by room, sensing through the walls.

[Six feet ahead, behind the wall, someone is passing by. In three breaths, a gust of wind will rustle the branches, startling a bird into flight...]

[The stone lantern to the left will run out of oil in two hours. An apprentice will come to refill it in fifteen minutes.]

After thoroughly scouting the front courtyard, including the main and side halls, Xiao Ji moved to the rear courtyard.

An hour later.

Using his ability to perceive everything within three meters, Xiao Ji easily avoided the patrolling apprentices.

[Three steps to your right is a cultivator named Zhao Jiuzhou, at the fourth level of Qi Refinement. He is a disciple of the Profound Iron Sect, which was annihilated a year ago. He is the sole survivor. At this moment, he has disguised himself as a withered willow.]

[He has already noticed your sneaking around and wishes you would leave.]

"Disguised as... a tree?"

Xiao Ji glanced to his right. Indeed, three steps away stood a withered willow, indistinguishable from the other snow-dusted trees in the courtyard.

Even upon closer inspection, it was impossible to tell it was a person.

The presence of a sect cultivator here, disguised as a tree, complicated matters.

Since he had already been spotted, Xiao Ji decided to approach the "willow" to learn more.
