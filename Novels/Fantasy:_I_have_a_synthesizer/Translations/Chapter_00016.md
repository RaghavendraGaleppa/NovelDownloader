# Chapter 16: Bai Zhan's Shock, A Golden Legend?

Blue!

A new color appeared on the pitch-black stone.

The sudden change made even Bai Zhan pause in surprise. His expression turned a little strange. As one of the instructors of the Prodigy Camp, he had tested countless prodigies, but this was the first time Bai Zhan had encountered someone who could make the testing stone change color.

Bai Zhan took a deep breath, narrowed his eyes slightly, stared at Su Yu, and said blandly, "Blue signifies a future Golden Body realm expert at the very least. This Su Yu can enter the Prodigy Camp!"

Just these few short words immediately filled the tense Liu Kuang with immense joy. For many years, Heng City had not produced a single genius capable of entering the Prodigy Camp. Once Su Yu entered, the Heng City Martial Artist Association would undoubtedly receive more resources, and by then, it might even be possible to nurture more talents! This was the sorrow of small cities. Even a genius, without sufficient resources, still couldn't compare to the prodigies from large cities. This was also why Liu Kuang was so excited about Su Yu being able to enter the Prodigy Camp. Furthermore, blue signified that Su Yu would at least reach the Golden Body realm in the future. One must know, even in Jiangnan Province, Golden Body realm experts were considered formidable. Even the instructors of the Prodigy Camp were merely Golden Body realm experts.

"Among them, green corresponds to Viscera Tempering realm potential, blue to Golden Body realm, purple to Sky Soaring realm, and as for orange, that's Grandmaster potential!" Bai Zhan continued, his voice laced with growing excitement. "As for red and gold, they are even more terrifying. At the very least, this year, only one orange-level genius has appeared in Jiangnan Province. Even purple-level talents are only seven or eight strong within the Prodigy Camp."

As he spoke, a brilliant light burst forth from Bai Zhan's eyes. "Who would have thought that a small Heng City could produce a purple-level genius? Liu Kuang, you've rendered a great service." Now, looking at the purple radiance of the testing stone, Bai Zhan was in high spirits. He had originally thought coming to Heng City would just be a formality; after all, what kind of genius could emerge from a peripheral small city like Heng City? But to Bai Zhan's surprise, Heng City truly had given birth to a monstrous talent.

Liu Kuang suppressed the wild joy in his heart and respectfully said, "This is what I should do."

"Hahahaha!" Bai Zhan let out a hearty laugh, already planning Su Yu's future arrangements in his mind. However, just then, he saw the testing stone begin to vibrate again.

Bai Zhan froze. "Holy crap, it's not over yet?" Even Bai Zhan couldn't help but blurt out a curse. After all, who could make the testing stone continuously change? Su Yu was the first in all the world.

Legends say that once a prodigy with potential beyond red is detected, a celestial phenomenon will occur. He never expected to encounter one himself. If it were just a celestial phenomenon, that would be one thing. But unfortunately, humanity was currently in a precarious state! Outside, ten thousand races waged war against humanity, while inside, various human traitors caused chaos. And their favorite targets were humanity's prodigies! Once they learned of a prodigy with red potential, they would resort to any means necessary to nip them in the bud. Therefore, among humanity, prodigies with red potential were usually guarded by numerous powerful experts who forcibly suppressed celestial phenomena to protect them.

Yet, Bai Zhan never imagined that such a talent would emerge from a remote small city like Heng City! Joy was naturally present, but even more so was an immense pressure! A red-level genius was enough to dispatch a Sky Soaring realm cult member. This was not something Bai Zhan could contend with.
