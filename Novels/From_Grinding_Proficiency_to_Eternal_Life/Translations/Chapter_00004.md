# Chapter 4: Copper Body Art

Xu Yunfan turned and walked away without waiting for Li Haomiao to reply. He had only just reached the entrance of the cave when he heard Li Haomiao speak.

"I can help you survive in this mine, at least for a while longer. If you work hard enough, you might even be able to leave this place."

Xu Yunfan's footsteps paused. He hesitated for a moment, mentally preparing himself.

Although Li Haomiao had fallen from grace, he was once part of the upper echelons of the Great Zhou Dynasty and undoubtedly possessed a wealth of knowledge. Furthermore, his reputation had been excellent throughout the capital back then.

No matter how grand the promises, they held some weight.

He recalled how countless young ladies from noble families had secretly cast glances of affection at him. The messengers at the Yan Manor's gates had to carry huge stacks of love letters into the estate every day. Even the original owner of this body had once delivered a letter for the Third Young Miss of the Jiang family.

This was a good opportunity for negotiation, but he had to be cautious. The minds of these high-ranking aristocrats were all treacherous and unpredictable.

In ancient society, there was a complete reproductive isolation between the upper and lower classes.

Xu Yunfan turned and walked back into the mine tunnel. He leaned against the wall about five meters away from Li Haomiao and stopped, waiting for him to speak.

Seeing this, Li Haomiao was a bit surprised, a hint of approval flashing in his eyes.

"Times have changed. To have such vigilance yet harbor no malicious intent is truly rare in this mine."

Xu Yunfan paid no mind to the other's praise and asked, "May I ask what advice the Yan Wang has for me?"

Seeing Xu Yunfan get straight to the point, Li Haomiao did not beat around the bush.

"Although your body is thin and weak, your frame is good. I can teach you how to practice martial arts."

Martial arts!

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred with excitement. The shocking image of the overseer splitting a person in two with a single whip strike was still vivid in his mind. The words "martial arts" seemed to possess a magical power that rooted him to the spot.

If he could possess martial prowess and a strong physique, it would naturally greatly enhance his resistance to the outside world.

The original owner had always wanted to practice martial arts. The Jiang family had many guards who would practice on the training grounds every day, but as servants, they were not allowed to watch. If they did so without their master's permission, their eyes would be gouged out.

Someone like Jiang Yu would never have allowed the original owner to watch.

"What do I need to do?"

Seeing Xu Yunfan's calm expression, not the least bit excited at the prospect of learning martial arts, Li Haomiao was a bit surprised, and his gaze became even more appreciative.

"Food and water. As long as you can provide me with food and water every day, I will teach you."

"Nothing else?"

"What else could there be? What else can you possibly do right now?"

Xu Yunfan nodded. "Alright."

Seeing that Li Haomiao had nothing more to say, Xu Yunfan naturally knew what the other wanted. He took a flatbread from his怀里 and some water, then tossed them to Li Haomiao.

Li Haomiao's eyelids didn't even twitch. He raised his only remaining left hand and caught them steadily, then began to eat and drink voraciously.

Xu Yunfan's eyes narrowed slightly.

This was not something someone with their tendons severed should be able to do.

The hard, stone-like flatbread was chewed to pieces by Li Haomiao in just a few bites, and washed down with water from the waterskin.

After a few mouthfuls, he had finished the bread and gulped down half the waterskin before letting out a long breath.

"Don't look at me like that. My tendons have been pulled out, but I can still control my muscles. This is just about enough to let me raise my hand and grip like a normal person."

Looking at Xu Yunfan standing quietly not far away, he pondered for a moment. "I remember you. A servant of the Jiang family, Xu..."

"Xu Yunfan."

Li Haomiao nodded slightly, thought for a bit, and said, "I observe that your waist and hips are stable, your eyes are sharp, and your hands are quick. You wield your pickaxe with fluid grace and have a great talent for mining. I have an art called the Copper Body Art, which is perfect for honing the body by smashing rocks. It's most suitable for you in your current state, or rather, for your current environment."

Xu Yunfan asked upon hearing this, "Does Yan Wang have any other martial arts?"

Li Haomiao frowned. "Greed leads to poor results. It is better to master one thing thoroughly than to have a superficial understanding of ten. Besides, food is scarce here, and you also have to mine. There's no way to support the practice of anything else. This art is the most suitable for this place."

He looked at Xu Yunfan carefully.

"Your aptitude isn't particularly high. This skill in mining must come from frequent practice in the past. I have many supreme martial arts, but with your aptitude..."

Li Haomiao didn't finish his sentence, but the meaning was clear.

Your aptitude is mediocre. Even if supreme martial arts were placed before you, you wouldn't be able to learn them.

But I have a Attribute Panel!

Xu Yunfan screamed in his heart, but he cupped his fists and said, "Please teach me, Yan Wang."

Li Haomiao organized his thoughts slightly and began to speak.

"The martial ways of the world are vast and varied, but no matter the method of cultivation, the core principles are the same. One trains the sinews, bones, and skin externally, and cultivates a single breath internally. From this, four great realms are derived: Golden Skin and Jade Veins, Mercury Blood and Silver Marrow, Yin-Yang Treasure Robe, and Qi Circulation through the Celestial Cycle. Though the names sound grand, they are essentially just the extreme characteristics that appear after training the sinews, bones, and skin; training the flesh, blood, and marrow; and training the organs and qi to their limits.

Martial arts all begin with the sinews, bones, and skin. The three are equally important, though they have different focuses. Beyond that, one achieves the Three Unities externally, connects internally with the body, moves from the external to the internal, and gathers the cycle to perfection.

Some train their sinews to great success and wish to advance further, seeking ultimate perfection. They can forge their own great sinews until they are like dragon sinews, possessing a jade-white luster. This is the sign of the Jade Veins, a characteristic of the fourth realm's extreme, but few achieve it.

I will teach you the Copper Body Art, a superior technique for training the skin."

Li Haomiao said a great deal in one breath. He took out his waterskin and took a sip to moisten his throat before continuing.

"Listen carefully to the incantation.

*Hidden copper conceals its spirit in the deep abyss,*
*Fiery breath enters the meridians, and the strength returns to its origin.*
*The true soul guards the orifice to refine the genuine and firm,*
*The whole body is like a casting, capable of withstanding a thousand fists...*

Two hours later, Xu Yunfan was holding his pickaxe and continuing to mine. After a while, he turned his head to look at Li Haomiao, who was lying down comfortably nearby.

"Are you sure this art can train the body just by mining? The incantation doesn't seem to say that."

Li Haomiao said leisurely, "To practice martial arts, one must train strength. To train strength, one must train one's stance. Only when you build up your body can you withstand the moves and techniques of martial arts. I have already taught you the stance of the art. The rest will come naturally once you have made a start."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan said no more. He began to mine in a very awkward manner, following the posture Li Haomiao had adjusted for him.

Every time he swung the pickaxe down, he could feel most of his muscle groups being pulled and tensed. After a short while, his shoulders and legs began to ache.

*Your eyes light up. You slightly shorten the distance of your pickaxe swing and instantly realize that each swing can more accurately shatter the ore. The feel of mining becomes better and better, and your Mining proficiency has increased.*

*An inspiration strikes you. While mining, you consciously control the height difference of each swing to create a well-paced rhythm. You quickly discover that your mining speed has increased, and your Mining proficiency has successfully risen.*

*You...*

*You have a vague understanding of the Copper Body Art. It seems you've grasped something, but in the end, you've gained nothing.*

*...*

Along with the continuous Mining proficiency prompts appearing in his vision, interspersed with a few prompts for the Copper Body Art's proficiency, a new entry appeared on his Attribute Panel: a skill notification for the Copper Body Art, labeled 'Not Yet Started'.

This immediately filled him with motivation. Since it was on the Attribute Panel, it was only a matter of time before he reached the入门 (Initial) stage. Xu Yunfan gradually became engrossed in the work, to the point where he selectively ignored the soreness in his body.
