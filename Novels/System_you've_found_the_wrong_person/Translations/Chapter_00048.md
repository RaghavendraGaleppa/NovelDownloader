# Chapter 48: The Ageless Witch

Clashes.  

Faking death to escape!  

Various thoughts flashed through Dou Changsheng's mind.  

He couldn't help but raise his head slightly, staring at the roof of the carriage, feeling utterly speechless as if questioning the heavens.  

As expected, his streak of bad luck had followed him relentlessly. He had known from the start that nothing good would come from this trip.  

Ranked seventy-ninth on the Human Ranking—Bloody Hand, Jin Sanming.  

Information about this individual quickly surfaced in his mind. Dou Changsheng had reviewed the Human Ranking multiple times. While he couldn’t claim to have memorized every name, he could instantly recall the details of any notable figure mentioned.  

Jin Sanming was a prodigious talent who had risen to fame at a young age, renowned for his mastery of the Crimson Blood Divine Art—a supreme technique of the demonic sect, the Divine Blood Sect.  

The Divine Blood Sect was a major faction in Zhengdi, Fangzhou. This sect practiced killing to refine their techniques, making them a textbook example of a demonic sect.  

However, Jin Sanming's fame wasn’t solely due to his formidable skills—he also had a famous brother:  

Heavenly Wail Hand, Jin Wuming.  

Ranked nineteenth on the Human Ranking, Jin Wuming was one of the most outstanding talents in the Jin Kingdom.  

How many individuals from the Jin Kingdom could make it into the top twenty of the Human Ranking, competing against elites from across the world?  

Among the younger generation of demonic practitioners, Jin Wuming stood at the pinnacle.  

The fact that both brothers had ascended the Human Ranking was hailed as a legendary tale.  

The Divine Blood Sect's reputation had soared as a result, now on the verge of becoming the foremost demonic sect in the Jin Kingdom.  

This Chen Taizhen before him was truly a piece of work.  

Seeing Dou Changsheng fall silent, Chen Taizhen took a sip of tea and said with a faint smile, "Go and prepare yourself."  

"In about two hours, Jin Sanming should arrive."  

The carriage curtain was lifted by a sword maiden, signaling for Dou Changsheng to leave. Slowly rising and stepping out of the carriage, he sighed as he looked at the luxurious vehicle.  

This time, he hadn’t even caught a glimpse of the young emperor. It was clear that without his imperial authority, Chen Taizhen no longer bothered to maintain appearances, treating the emperor as nothing more than a puppet.  

This person was undoubtedly some ancient monster pretending to be young.  

Ma Liren appeared beside Dou Changsheng at some point and whispered, "Hero Dou?"  

"What happened?"  

"If it’s not a matter of life and death, I advise you to endure it for now."  

"To be perfectly honest, escorting the deposed emperor back to Beiyang…"  

"Both you and I are just accessories to this person."  

"She is the true powerhouse here."  

Ma Liren watched as the carriage gradually disappeared into the distance before lowering his voice further. "You are a disciple of the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou, born into nobility."  

"You must have heard of those legendary figures."  

"Among them, there is one who particularly enjoys pretending to be young."  

"His Majesty has long suspected that this Chen Taizhen is none other than the legendary—"  

"Ageless Witch!"  

Ma Liren’s posture became even more submissive, his back bending as if he were Dou Changsheng’s personal servant.  

If his earlier demeanor had been superficial, now it was genuine—reverence and obedience, with not a hint of defiance. A grandmaster, a trusted aide of the empress, entrusted with guarding the deposed emperor—his status was undeniable.  

Yet here he was, showing deference to a mere Xiantian-level martial artist. The situation was absurd, almost comical, yet it was unfolding before his eyes. Reality was often stranger than fiction.  

Ageless Witch!  

These four words exploded in Dou Changsheng’s mind like thunder.  

Compared to this, figures like Jin Sanming and Jin Wuming were nothing.  

Even Chen Qingyao paled in comparison.  

Chen Qingyao was only ranked third on the Earth Ranking, but the Ageless Witch was a top-ten figure on the Heaven Ranking.  

A true celestial being, towering above all mortals.  

The Three Suns Divine Lord was merely suspected of undergoing transformation, still in the process of shedding his mortal form, yet his mere presence had intimidated the nobility of the capital for centuries, preventing them from acting openly against the Three Suns Sect.  

But the Ageless Witch was a true heavyweight among celestial beings, standing at the pinnacle even among her peers.  

Ma Liren hadn’t mentioned this earlier, but now that he revealed his suspicions, Dou Changsheng immediately understood the reason. Before his entanglement with the Ageless Witch, in Ma Liren’s eyes, he was merely someone valued by the Wang Clan.  

Even if he came from a prestigious background, possessed decent strength, and had great potential, he was still just a promising talent—worthy of attention, but nothing more.  

But now that the Ageless Witch had personally summoned him, his status had skyrocketed, increasing his worth a hundredfold.  

Wang Tianhe had once explained that the Ageless Witch had an eccentric habit—she enjoyed hiding behind geniuses, playing house with them.  

There was undoubtedly something deeper at play, but with limited information, it was impossible to tell whether this was merely her quirk or part of some grand scheme.  

One thing, however, was clear: those chosen by her were invariably the cream of the crop among geniuses.  

The most prominent example?  

The Ghost Valley Divine Lord, Chen Qingyao.  

In Ma Liren’s eyes, Dou Changsheng had likely become the next Chen Qingyao before his rise.  

Even if the situation was slightly less favorable, he was still at least a top-five contender on the Earth Ranking.  

This martial world…  

Was far too dangerous.  

Dou Changsheng’s heart pounded violently, each beat threatening to leap out of his throat.  

Though this was still speculation—unconfirmed, merely suspected—  

Dou Changsheng was inclined to believe it.  

This raised another question: why would a Heaven Ranking powerhouse, someone whose mere presence could shake nations, seek out a nobody like him?  

Why not pester the Demon Master or Chen Qingyao?  

Heaven Ranking experts rarely made public appearances, leaving the stage to Earth Ranking grandmasters—but that didn’t mean they didn’t exist.  

Where did Jin Sanming get the audacity to attack this convoy?  

Ah, right—it was all staged by Chen Taizhen.  

Dou Changsheng was eighty percent convinced, reserving twenty percent skepticism. After all, this entire scene might have been orchestrated by Ma Liren as part of an elaborate act.  

Defeating someone ranked seventy-ninth on the Human Ranking would require his full effort.  

Ma Liren glanced at the distant carriage and whispered, "There’s a steward from the Martial Tower in this convoy."  

"At first, I thought it was just a coincidence, but now it seems everything was prearranged."  

"When the battle begins, Hero Dou, you must be careful."  

"Those who survive being targeted by that one all become great figures."  

"But those who don’t… all end up dead."  

Having said this, Ma Liren quickly retreated, as if Dou Changsheng were a walking calamity to be avoided at all costs.  

Dou Changsheng remained calm. What had seemed like a simple escort mission had unexpectedly drawn the attention of a Heaven Ranking powerhouse—something even Yu Yun couldn’t have anticipated. This was far more significant than the empress’s coup.  

His bad luck never failed to disappoint.  

At midnight, a long cry suddenly pierced the air.  

The convoy erupted in flames.  

Dou Changsheng immediately shouted, "Protect the King of Beiyang!"  

Gripping the Hero’s Sword, he positioned himself in front of the carriage, ready to face his destined foe.  

Dou Changsheng felt oddly at ease.  

Why?  

Because Future Dou had given him a cheat.  

He had grown stronger!
