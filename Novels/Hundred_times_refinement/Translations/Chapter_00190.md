# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb - Chapter 138: Conflict

For an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator, arriving alone in the Demonic Sky City would indeed be extremely dangerous. However, Lin Xuan's situation was different.

In Youzhou, the Spirit Medicine Mountain held a transcendent status. Beyond its hidden forces, it openly extended its services to fellow cultivators—not just orthodox practitioners, but demonic cultivators were treated equally. Thus, although Spirit Medicine Mountain belonged to the orthodox faction, it enjoyed an excellent reputation among demonic cultivators and was widely respected.

An alchemist from Spirit Medicine Mountain could move freely through Demonic Sky City without facing any deliberate obstruction from demonic cultivators. Lin Xuan had no need to travel with companions.

Shortly after, Lin Xuan descended upon Demonic Sky City. The city gates before him stood nearly eighty feet tall, enveloped in a faint blue protective barrier, with two solemn-faced cultivators standing guard. Lin Xuan noticed that while demonic cultivators passed through unimpeded, orthodox cultivators were stopped for inspection.

The man on the left glanced at Lin Xuan, a trace of mockery flashing in his eyes. This young man had impressive cultivation, reaching mid-Foundation Establishment at such a young age, but he clearly didn't know the dangers of venturing alone into this sacred ground of demonic cultivators. Just as the guard was about to speak, Lin Xuan smiled and said, "Lin Xuan of Spirit Medicine Mountain, greetings to both fellow Daoists."

"Spirit Medicine Mountain?" The man on the left was taken aback, his expression immediately turning friendly. "My apologies, my apologies. Might you have your sect's jade token with you?"

"Certainly." Lin Xuan nodded, reaching into his robe and producing a translucent jade token. Crafted from fine warm jade, it bore an ancient design with unique restrictions that made it impossible to counterfeit.

The demonic cultivator took it and examined it, his expression growing even more respectful. "So you are the young master of Spirit Medicine Mountain. Forgive our earlier discourtesy."

"You flatter me," Lin Xuan replied, retrieving the token. "May I enter now?"

"Of course." The demonic cultivator wore an ingratiating smile as he took out a black talisman from his storage pouch. Channeling spiritual power, a streak of black light shot forth and landed on Lin Xuan's robe.

Throughout the process, Lin Xuan remained composed, though a flicker of suspicion crossed his eyes. He hesitated briefly but did not evade. "What is this...?"

"Young master need not worry," the demonic cultivator explained with a smile. "As you surely know, aside from fellow Daoists from Spirit Medicine Mountain, orthodox cultivators are not particularly welcome in Demonic Sky City. This talisman signifies that you are an honored guest of our city. With it, no one will trouble you."

"Thank you, fellow Daoist."

Once the spell was cast, Lin Xuan's robe emitted an eerie black glow. Though he trusted that the other party meant no harm, he still used his spiritual sense to carefully inspect it. Only after confirming that there was no issue did he confidently step into the city.

Demonic Sky City, the gathering place of demonic cultivators in Youzhou, was indeed bustling with activity. The streets teemed with people, and Lin Xuan was surprised to find not only cultivators pursuing the path of immortality but also a considerable number of mortals.

The cultivators here were also different from those he was accustomed to—many had fierce, scowling faces or exuded an intimidating aura, making them appear unapproachable. This was related to the demonic cultivation techniques they practiced, which accelerated progress but often twisted their temperaments.

Of course, aside from demonic cultivators, there were also many orthodox cultivators in the city, though most kept a low profile. Arguments were common, and physical altercations were far from rare. Demonic cultivators had notoriously short tempers, and even minor disagreements could escalate into battles with spiritual artifacts.

Up ahead, another commotion erupted, drawing a crowd. Lin Xuan paid it no mind—he had no interest in meddling in others' affairs or indulging in idle spectating. He was about to bypass the scene when, after a few steps, he halted. His brows furrowed slightly as he seemed to consider something.

After a moment, he made up his mind and turned toward the commotion.

Most of the onlookers were low-level cultivators at the Qi Refining stage. When they noticed a Foundation Establishment elder approaching—an orthodox cultivator marked as an honored guest by the black glow on his robe—they respectfully made way.

Lin Xuan focused his gaze and spotted a familiar figure: Xu Yin, whom he had met once before. It was her voice that had prompted him to change his course.

Though her cultivation was insignificant, she had an impressive elder brother—Xu Feng, a rising star of the Heavenly Mountain Sect and a strong contender for the position of future sect leader. The Heavenly Mountain Sect's influence in Youzhou was second only to the three great powers.

Lin Xuan was not one to act without benefit. Befriending someone as promising as Xu Feng would undoubtedly aid his future cultivation. Seeing his sister in trouble, Lin Xuan decided to assess the situation.

Of course, he wouldn't recklessly intervene. If it required minimal effort, he wouldn't mind helping—it would be a favor Xu Feng owed him. But if it involved significant risk, he would carefully weigh the pros and cons before acting.

With this mindset, Lin Xuan remained composed, opting to observe before making a move.

The one confronting Xu Yin was a tall, burly demonic cultivator with a shaved head, an ugly face, and a cultivation level at the third layer of Foundation Establishment. Five years had passed, but Xu Yin's appearance hadn't changed much—she was still sweet-faced and charming, though her expression now showed clear irritation.

"I've already said I'm not interested in you. Why do you keep pestering me? I won't dual cultivate with you!" she snapped.

"Don't be so quick to dismiss me, young lady," the demonic cultivator said with a smirk. "I, Yuan Song, am sincere. I've reached mid-Foundation Establishment—dual cultivating with me would only benefit you. I could mentor you."

"You? Mentor me?" Xu Yin scoffed. "I'm a disciple of Heavenly Mountain, and my elder brother is already at Foundation Establishment's Great Perfection. What use do I have for your guidance?"

She spoke the truth, but Yuan Song didn't believe her. If she were truly a Heavenly Mountain disciple, why would she be here alone? As for her so-called elder brother at Great Perfection, he assumed she was bluffing.

Convinced she was a rogue cultivator, Yuan Song was determined to have her. His eyes flashed with a cruel light as he prepared to take her by force. After all, in Demonic Sky City, no one would stand up for a mere Qi Refining orthodox cultivator.

Though Xu Yin could be willful, she was sharp-witted. Seeing his expression, she panicked—until she caught sight of a familiar figure.

"Brother Lin!" she cried, rushing toward him as if grasping at a lifeline.

"Miss Xu, it's been a while. Where is your elder brother?"

"We'll talk about that later. Brother Lin, you have to help me!"

Seeing her pitiful expression, Lin Xuan smiled faintly. He had already assessed the situation—this demonic cultivator had no allies and was likely a rogue cultivator. Though his cultivation was similar to Lin Xuan's, Lin Xuan's Nine Heavens Profound Art was exceptionally powerful even among top-tier techniques. Moreover, he possessed numerous magical treasures, ensuring victory in any battle against a peer.

With this in mind, Lin Xuan decided to act—both to curry favor with Xu Feng and because helping her was a trivial matter.

Before he could speak, however, the demonic cultivator's cold voice rang out: "Who are you? I advise you not to meddle in affairs that don't concern you."

Lin Xuan looked up to see the burly man's hostile gaze.

Though Yuan Song wore a fierce expression, inwardly he was uneasy. He hadn't expected someone to intervene at the last moment, thwarting his plan to take the girl as a dual cultivation furnace.

This newcomer was a mid-Foundation Establishment orthodox cultivator, but what gave Yuan Song pause was the demonic aura emanating from his robe—proof that he was an honored guest of the city. Orthodox and demonic cultivators were not sworn enemies, but they seldom got along. How could this young orthodox cultivator receive such treatment in Demonic Sky City? What was his identity?

Countless questions swirled in Yuan Song's mind.

Lin Xuan, perceptive as ever, saw through his bluster. With an impassive expression, he said, "This Miss Xu is the younger sister of an old friend of mine. I suggest you abandon your delusions. A toad lusting after swan flesh only courts disaster."

"How dare you!" Yuan Song roared, his face flushing with rage. The unorthodox techniques he practiced had made him quick-tempered, and with so many onlookers, backing down would be humiliating. "Let's see what a mere orthodox cultivator like you is capable of!"

Without another word, Yuan Song flicked his sleeve, sending a dark green streak of light shooting toward Lin Xuan's chest.

Lin Xuan snorted. Prepared for this, he swiftly transformed into a mist of white vapor, enveloping Xu Yin and dodging the attack.
