# Chapter 120: Introduction to Divine Artisan Forging

To improve proficiency, there is only one word: Practice!

The hourglass from the Mechanism Hall beside the forging furnace had only turned half an hour, yet thirteen refined iron ingots were already piled at Xu Yunfan's feet.

What shocked Zhan Yan the most was that the patterns on each ingot were different.

There were dragon scale patterns created by Spiral Force, lightning patterns torn by shockwaves, and even one iron blank that, after rapid cooling, displayed a crystalline latticework like glazed pottery.

"Stop!"

Zhan Yan suddenly roared, his aged palm pressing down on the descending heavy hammer. Two shockwaves collided at the hammerhead, actually shifting the anvil three inches sideways.

"Where did you learn such fire control technique?"

Xu Yunfan wiped a bead of sweat from his neck. The rising heat condensed into a faint golden mist on his back.

"Disciple only felt... that the rhythm of each melting of the iron blank was similar to the breathing of the Heavenly Cicada Strength."

Xu Yunfan detailed the Heavenly Cicada vibration of the Heavenly Cicada Sect and the method of bone鸣 trembling. With each hammer strike, his own bones would tremble slightly, allowing the force to penetrate deep into the iron ingot and reshape its patterns.

"Just now, these patterns were merely my attempts at control. Now that I'm slightly familiar with it, I should be able to forge according to my own ideas... Perhaps once I'm proficient, I could even draw a picture within the patterns of the iron ingot."

Looking at the enthusiastic Xu Yunfan, Zhan Yan was momentarily speechless, feeling that all his years of forging skills had been fed to the dogs.

Especially upon hearing about the bone-shaking force of the Heavenly Cicada Strength, he remained silent for a long while.

Xu Yunfan asked, "Does Master know of the Heavenly Cicada Sect?"

"Naturally."

Upon learning that Xu Yunfan had once studied at the Heavenly Cicada Sect, and about the Heavenly Cicada Strength's high-frequency bone vibration technique, and hearing that Sect Master Chen Tiangang intended to perform a True Blood transplant...

He sneered, "That Chen Tiangang is utterly foolish. True Blood is the scattered lineage of a True Immortal's bloodline. If it could truly be transplanted, all True Blood bearers in the world would have vanished long ago."

Only then did his expression ease slightly.

"So you possess True Blood."

Xu Yunfan was stunned. He hadn't mentioned possessing True Blood.

"Master, I don't..."

"No wonder your martial talent is exceptional, your comprehension is top-tier, and you pick up forging skills so quickly."

"Master, I didn't say I have True..."

"Since your True Blood has awakened, your Master finally understands why you've reached perfection in Muscle and Skin Refinement. But you must not be arrogant. There are many who awaken True Blood in this world, and countless others who are stuck at the Flesh Refinement realm, unable to advance further."

Watching Zhan Yan ramble on his own, Xu Yunfan opened his mouth, then closed it and remained silent.

After circling around the topic, Zhan Yan coughed lightly, a hint of embarrassment on his face.

"Tell me about the Heavenly Cicada Strength. Let me see what's so exquisite about its bone-shaking force generation."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but reveal a slight smile. Without any hesitation, he recited the method of the Heavenly Cicada Strength.

"..."

"Truly a marvelous synchronization of breath."

For a long while, the still unsatisfied Zhan Yan abruptly grabbed a not-yet-cooled iron blank and threw it into the air. The glowing metal block arced through the air towards the quenching pool.

"Catch it! Continue with the hammer forging method from the Divine Artisan Forging. Put aside the Heavenly Cicada Strength for now. That method is indeed quite good, but you've only just laid the foundation. You haven't sensed the characteristics of the forged iron blank yet. The force needs to penetrate inside to achieve success. Although the Heavenly Cicada Strength improves efficiency... it takes a shortcut. Wait until you've entered the Divine Artisan Forging realm, then superimpose this method!"

After saying that, Zhan Yan ran off to another forging platform on his own, starting to ponder the application of the Heavenly Cicada Strength, his expression filled with a hint of awe.

Xu Yunfan didn't mind. His toes hooked the bellows lever, using the leverage to leap into the air. The forging hammer spun three times in his palm.

The instant the hammerhead struck the iron blank, eighteen hidden forces rapped like a storm against a window. The semi-molten metal changed shape in mid-air, first stretching into a sword blank, then curling into a ring under the second hammer strike. When it finally fell into the quenching pool, it had taken the form of a rough eight-sided Han sword.

*Clang—*

The quenching pool erupted with a three-zhang-high plume of white mist.

This scene caught Zhan Yan's attention again. He took two large steps over and picked up the sword blank with tongs.

Looking at the naturally formed ice-crack patterns on the sword body, amidst the not-yet-cooled metal, there were金沙状 (sand-like gold) substances flowing within. This was the "Flowing Gold" phenomenon that only appears when Mithril purity exceeds 98%. Even if he出手 personally, the result would be no different.

"Twenty-seven breaths."

Zhan Yan suddenly grabbed the lower section of the long sword, where the hilt had yet to be attached, with his bare hand. That coarse hand didn't seem to feel the scorching heat of several hundred degrees at all.

It made Xu Yunfan grimace.

A veteran of the Blood Transformation Realm who practices the Divine Weapon Ridge's body-refining technique, forging by the Thunder and Fire Pool year after year, his physique hammered into refined steel by every hammer blow, naturally had the capital to hold it barehanded.

Zhan Yan, holding the still glowing long sword,划出 deep scratches on the ground. "Back when your Senior Brother learned the Divine Artisan Forging, it took him a full three months to forge the first complete forging pattern."

The Weapon Casting Hall suddenly fell into dead silence, only the crackling of the furnace fire remaining.

A long while later, Zhan Yan's straight waist seemed to hunch slightly. He reinserted the still glowing sword blank into the quenching pool, waved his hand, and simply walked away.

Xu Yunfan asked in confusion, "Master, aren't you going to teach me anymore?"

"... Finish forging these weapons first. I need to process this for a bit, rest for a day or two."

"..."

It seems the blow to Master's worldview was quite significant!

Perhaps I should sometimes try to conceal my strength a bit. Now that I'm a true disciple of the Divine Artisan Cave, the only way to rise further would be to pull Master off his seat and become the Hall Master of the Weapon Casting Hall myself.

Looks like I need to hold back a bit in the future. If I learn and master everything instantly, it wouldn't be a surprise, but a shock.

Xu Yunfan rubbed his chin and glanced at the information prompt floating in his vision.

'Your skill Divine Artisan Forging has reached Entry level'

'Divine Artisan Forging 0/500 (Entry) (Incomplete)

Special Effects: Purification, Hundred Refinements, Severing Metal and Jade, Thousand Strikes Spirit Pattern'

Why is it Incomplete?

Perhaps Master didn't explain it fully. He turned to look at the several copper pillars standing on the forging platform by the Thunder and Fire Pool. The forging technique had already been explained in detail there. Zhan Yan had demonstrated the complete set of weapon casting methods through his own actions.

Before he could ponder further, a massive influx of memories regarding forging weapons surged into his mind.

The moment Xu Yunfan's five fingers gripped the hammer handle, the three-hundred-and-twenty-catty Mithril hammer seemed to stick to his palm.

The thirty-two small bones in his wrist connected sequentially. The Hundred Refinements Silk Thread Force recorded in the Divine Artisan Forging shot from his tailbone straight to his fingertips.

The Thousand Weight Hammer Force of the Divine Weapon Ridge rose from within his muscles, causing the muscles of his holding arm to bulge and swell.

This feeling was like muscle memory formed from swinging the hammer millions of times.

One hard, one soft, harmonizing exceptionally well.

*Ding!*

Xu Yunfan, struck by sudden inspiration, swung the hammer and struck the refined steel ingot just retrieved from the quenching pool. His bulging trapezius muscle contracted sharply.

Sixteen types of impurities within the metal were precisely screened out by the shockwave, shooting out with sparks, scattering layers of iron filings on the blue brick wall.

The glowing red filings sticking to Xu Yunfan burned countless small holes in his clothes.

Xu Yunfan paid no heed, merely continuing to hammer away.

(There are still three chapters after eleven o'clock, still ten thousand words today.)
