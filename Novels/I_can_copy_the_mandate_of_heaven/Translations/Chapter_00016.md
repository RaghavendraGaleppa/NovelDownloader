## 16, Outside the Valley

Li Zhiming could finally sneak out of the valley.

Carrying two warm steamed buns in his embrace, he descended the mountain. Along the way, dense bamboo forests stood tall, and steep cliffs loomed. Occasionally, one or two burly senior disciples would pass by, but they kept their eyes straight ahead. As Li Zhiming passed a platform, he saw hundreds of people shouting and practicing martial arts.

Dressed in short jackets, their bodies exuded a steaming vital energy. Li Zhiming watched with intense curiosity, so he climbed a tree, pushed aside the leaves, and crouched on a branch, peeking for a while. In his eyes, there was deep envy.

As the saying goes, "the poor study literature, the rich practice martial arts." He heard that these senior disciples could crack stones and break tablets with their bare hands. Li Zhiming watched them practice peculiar moves; it seemed as if vital energy circulated with their muscles, making them appear much stronger.

"Could that be 'True Yang Force'?" Li Zhiming secretly wondered. This past month in the valley, Doctor Mo had been frequently leaving early and returning late. A study room was open to Li Zhiming and Han Li, mainly because these two children hadn't learned many characters. Li Zhiming found a book titled "Seven Mysteries Sect Child's Cultivation Manual" inside. He called Han Li over and had him roughly read it character by character. Only then did he realize this was a martial art for eight-year-old children of the Seven Mysteries Sect, designed to cultivate something called "True Yang Force" from a young age. Once this energy was nurtured, it would be enough to make one as agile as a tiger or leopard, and capable of cracking stones and breaking tablets with their hands.

Just hearing these descriptions made Li Zhiming immensely envious. If he were in the countryside, how much more farm work could he help his father and mother with? He wouldn't even be afraid of wild dogs and wolves when going up the mountain.

After watching for a while, Li Zhiming's back felt hot from the sun, so he quickly jumped down from the tree. Doctor Mo didn't forbid them from learning this, but he said they first needed to learn to identify ten thousand basic herbs and a thousand different medicinal prescriptions, which would be enough for them to study for many years. During this time, they also needed to learn to read.

"I wonder where Big Niu was assigned." Along the way, Li Zhiming stopped a tall, grim-faced senior disciple and asked for directions. The disciple glanced at the 'Mo Valley' token on Li Zhiming's waist, pointed into the distance, and then turned and walked away.

"Once you get there, take the second fork and turn left."

Li Zhiming thanked him from behind, but the tall senior disciple paid him no mind. Li Zhiming touched the warm object in his embrace, sped up, and dashed down the mountain. After a few turns and passing another lush bamboo forest, Li Zhiming soon saw a continuous stretch of bamboo houses.

He peeked into the bamboo houses but found no one, so Li Zhiming had to wait outside. Not long after, another agile senior disciple passed by. Seeing a child squatting at the entrance of the bamboo courtyard, he casually grabbed him and lifted him up. He frowned, "Which martial arts master are you under? Why are you slacking off here instead of practicing martial arts?"

"Senior Brother, I am Doctor Mo's disciple!" With his feet dangling in the air, Li Zhiming wasn't afraid and called out loudly, "I'm here to visit a friend."

He glanced at the token on Li Zhiming's waist, and his expression softened slightly. "They are climbing the bamboo forest and won't be back until noon. They'll also practice in the afternoon. You can talk to him when he eats." After saying this, the senior disciple in the black robe put Li Zhiming down and walked away. No one cared what a child was doing.

Li Zhiming squatted outside this bamboo garden and waited until noon. Only then did he see dozens of children coming down from the bamboo forest one after another, all covered in cuts and bruises, looking disheartened. A martial arts master, whose body was large and filled with vital energy, was scolding them sternly from the side.

"Heads up! How much distance was that? Why are you all so dispirited? Did your parents die?!"

At this scolding, although a few people raised their heads, they had no spirit whatsoever, appearing like plague-ridden chickens struck by frost.

Li Zhiming spotted Big Niu in the crowd. Big Niu's clothes were tattered, and his arms and legs seemed to have many small cuts. He was also one of the dispirited ones in the crowd, but his body was a bit fatter than others, making him stand out more.

"Big Niu, Big Niu!!" Li Zhiming stood up, waved vigorously at him, and shouted loudly. In the crowd, Big Niu first kept his head down, then after a moment, believed someone was really calling him. He looked up, saw the skinny, small boy outside the bamboo garden, and when he recognized Li Zhiming, a large snot bubble almost came down from his nose in injustice.

Seeing countless eyes turn towards him, and noticing another child who wasn't participating in training, the black-robed steward strode over with a gloomy expression. From his appearance, Li Zhiming had no doubt that he could slap him into the ground. As soon as he saw him, Li Zhiming, now practiced, quickly pulled out the token from his waist. The steward opened his mouth, glanced at the token on Li Zhiming's waist, and only then did his expression soften slightly.

"You cannot stay here long. After noon, you must leave!" After saying this, he turned and walked away with his hands behind his back. As soon as the martial arts master left, the others instantly scattered like wild horses, all running off.

"Little Four!" As Big Niu ran down, he, who had been strong for a month, immediately hugged Li Zhiming, crying with snot and tears, "I hurt so much, woohoo! I want to go home!"

Big Niu continued to wail meaninglessly while hugging Li Zhiming, his voice almost hoarse from crying. Li Zhiming felt a little sorry for Big Niu and could only gently pat his back. Although he himself wasn't mature, he didn't forget to comfort his companion, though his tone was still a sigh, like a precocious child. "We might not be able to go home for several years."

Saying this made Li Zhiming himself feel melancholic, but fortunately, Big Niu was crying so hard that he didn't hear a thing.

When Big Niu tired himself out crying, Li Zhiming pulled him to sit on a nearby stone. Li Zhiming glanced left and right, then quickly pulled three still-warm large steamed buns from his embrace and thrust them into Big Niu's arms.

"Eat quickly," Li Zhiming said softly, then took out a bottle of topical herbal medicine from his embrace.

"Where did you get these?" Big Niu's eyes lit up instantly. He was clearly ravenous, and even if he wasn't, these large steamed buns were enough to delight him for a while. He buried his head and munched on them sweetly. Li Zhiming licked his lower lip, his throat bobbing once.

These steamed buns were naturally extras from Doctor Mo's house, plus Li Zhiming's saved lunch. Li Zhiming knew Big Niu had a big appetite and was likely worn out from the training down the mountain, so he brought them to help him regain his strength.

"Just eat," Li Zhiming said with a serious expression. "What happened to your body again?"

Big Niu's clothes were ragged and torn; the ones he brought from home were now completely unwearable. The wounds beneath his clothes, though not deep, had broken the skin and bled a little. Li Zhiming poured out the herbal medicine from the bottle and applied it to Big Niu. With that application, Big Niu immediately winced in pain; even the steamed buns lost their appeal. Speaking of which, he instantly felt even more aggrieved. "I'm fat, so it's easier for leaves to scratch me."

Listen to him, he even got indignant, "When I grow up, I'm definitely going to pull out all these bamboo leaves on the mountain!"

Li Zhiming chuckled, "When you're older, you won't need to climb this anymore. Other children who climb it would actually thank you if you pulled them out."

At this, Big Niu felt even more wronged, and the tears he had just held back threatened to well up again in frustration.

"Little Four, where have you been these days?" Big Niu, like his body, was incredibly carefree, and his emotions quickly stabilized. After eating the large steamed buns until he was full, his voice became somewhat muffled.

Li Zhiming explained that he was left behind due to his weak constitution, along with Han Li. Then, when someone came to select disciples, he and Han Li followed Doctor Mo to the valley to learn about herbs. This made Big Niu terribly envious. "I want to go too, Little Four! Practicing martial arts here is just too tiring, woohoo. I don't get enough sleep every day. They wake me up before the roosters crow, and I'm still awake when the pigs are asleep, woohoo woohoo."

Hearing this, Li Zhiming couldn't help but let out a dry laugh. Big Niu, like this, learning herbs? Putting aside whether Doctor Mo would scold him, just keeping Han Li was already an act of grace. Learn herbs? With Han Li's diligence, even reciting the herbal soup verses was exhausting for him. Big Niu, on the other hand, would stumble over something as simple as "hungry, hungry, hungry" even after hearing it once. Li Zhiming truly didn't think he had the ability.

So Li Zhiming changed the subject. "By the way, what about Liu Zhi? How's he doing these days?"

Big Niu had already gulped down an entire large steamed bun. His throat bobbed up and down, clearly indicating he was choked. After swallowing a few mouthfuls of saliva, he finally let out a breath and said, "I don't really know. He's with those other kids now, and he's quite arrogant."

"I heard some of them know martial arts masters in the Seven Mysteries Sect, and they're living quite well." As he spoke, Big Niu began to feel bitter. He had no one to help him.

Having finally met after so long, Big Niu seemed to have a belly full of complaints, from grumbling about climbing the bamboo forest to not getting enough sleep every day, and finally, about being called stupid and lazy by the martial arts master. Li Zhiming listened, sighing repeatedly.

The talkative Li Zhiming also complained to him about life with Doctor Mo, but as he complained, Big Niu actually grew terribly envious. "How did I not know you could do this before?" he said enviously.

In response, Li Zhiming could only give a dry laugh. He was indeed much freer than Big Niu now. Seeing these children practice martial arts like this, cultivating this 'True Yang Force' truly wasn't easy. As for himself, at least he could still run around inside and outside the valley whenever he pleased.

He sat here with Big Niu until after lunch, when the sun was high in the sky. Only then did the gloomy-faced martial arts master, with his hands behind his back, slowly pace back. Seeing his appearance, the children, who had regained some spirit, immediately became dispirited again.

"I'll come back to see you!" With a glance from the martial arts master, Li Zhiming knew he should leave. He could only stand up, meeting Big Niu's reluctant gaze.
