# Chapter 12: The Secret Art of Lin

“Her skin is like jade fat, her bones like immortal jade. She is nearly finished with her transformation. The Primordial Ancient Jade Wall might truly be able to complete the Ascension Ceremony. We have ruined her cultivation; ten thousand years of it were lost in an instant.”

“No, perhaps it wasn't us who ruined it. Otherwise, even in this era where the Primordial Spirit Energy is extinguished and secret powers are not revealed, some divine strangeness would have emerged. She likely died halfway through the process.”

His voice was slightly low, his eyes flickering with a hint of lament and sorrow.

“She is a Supreme Expert. In her era, she was likely a peerless beauty who stood out through the ages. Unfortunately, she encountered the late period of the Primordial Spirit Energy's decline. With no other choice, she had to settle for second best, trapping herself in a state between life and death and burying herself within the Primordial Ancient Jade Wall. Ten thousand years passed, and we dug her out.”

“So, we are her Human Tribulation?”

“We?” Li Haomiao shook his head slightly. “The true Human Tribulation is that vixen sitting on the Great Zhou throne. Ninggu Pagoda was established only after she took power. She knows secrets I do not and seems to be searching for the traces of predecessors, wanting to visit the ruins of immortals.”

Xu Yunfan quietly looked at the woman's naked body, his expression filled with emotion. He then reached out and gently touched the woman.

In the next instant, the originally plump woman began to rapidly wither, as if deflating. Her jade-like, full skin dried and wrinkled.

Before he could even react, the goddess-like woman before him had turned into nothing but a skin wrapper.

Li Haomiao’s expression changed drastically.

“What did you do?”

Xu Yunfan was completely bewildered, caught off guard.

“How should I know? It shouldn't have happened just from a touch, right? I just wanted to see if her skin was smooth.”

Li Haomiao also came to his senses. Looking at the wrinkled skin wrapper before him, he sighed, “It seems she had already failed her ascension and undergone Corpse Dissolution before we arrived. It was only the Primordial Ancient Jade Wall that preserved the characteristics of her physical body.”

Xu Yunfan paused slightly as he picked up the skin wrapper.

*You have discovered the Dao Sect Nine Secrets, Lin.*

In an instant, a large amount of cultivation methods regarding the 'Lin' character technique flooded his mind, allowing him to memorize it quickly. It was a rare Dao Sect technique focused on stabilizing the mind and strengthening the soul.

This was a memory infusion!

“What's wrong?”

Hearing Li Haomiao's question, Xu Yunfan suppressed the turmoil in his heart and shook his head slightly, his expression normal.

“It's nothing, it's just that the texture of this skin wrapper is very good.”

Seeing that Xu Yunfan was fine, Li Haomiao reached out with his only remaining left hand to touch it, commenting, “It's even softer than a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl, like a child's.”

Xu Yunfan cursed, “If you were in my world, you’d be sentenced to death.”

Li Haomiao found it somewhat莫名其妙 (莫名其妙 - inexplicable/ridiculous), and snorted lightly, “In my Great Zhou Empire, a thirteen-year-old girl can already be a wife. Someone like you, still dawdling at seventeen or eighteen, is just a failure in others' eyes.”

Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to argue with him and sat down in a spot, quietly watching the Primordial Ancient Jade Wall, which had been emitting a deep luster, begin to fade, gradually becoming indistinguishable from ordinary mountain stone.

His mind was carefully contemplating the 'Lin' character technique from the Dao Sect Nine Secrets that he had sensed through the system just moments ago.

Li Haomiao also fell silent, staring blankly at the Primordial Ancient Jade Wall.

After a long while, Li Haomiao said, “The Primordial Ancient Jade Wall has already been used. Once broken, its divine strangeness will naturally dissipate.”

Xu Yunfan focused most of his mind on the 'Lin' character technique in his head and asked casually, “Did this female immortal die early?”

“Perhaps. Something happened back then. She was in a state between life and death, unable to keep her physical body from decaying.”

Xu Yunfan didn't ask further. He had already obtained the greatest opportunity from this skin wrapper. If it weren't for the Attribute Panel, he probably wouldn't have been able to activate the infusion condition.

“What is True Blood?”

Li Haomiao glanced at Xu Yunfan.

“Right. Someone like you, a rootless True Blood practitioner with no backing, really wouldn't be able to get related information.”

“The so-called True Blood possessors are the descendants left behind by True Immortals.”

Xu Yunfan was shaken. “I am a descendant of a True Immortal?!”

In an instant, countless speculations about his life story popped into his mind: parents killed by foreign demons, accidentally dropping him into the mortal world to suffer, or his father having him with a mistress, the legitimate eldest son finding out, the vicious main wife making things difficult, leaving him to fend for himself...

“Daydreaming? Looking at you, you probably just happened to have a sign of ancestral return. The last wisp of True Blood in your body was activated. People like you aren't rare in the entire Great Zhou, but they aren't exactly common either.”

“True Immortal descendants are indeed strong, but after spreading out through generations, the bloodline has long been diluted to almost nothing. Without any accidents, you should be just like an ordinary person.”

Speaking of this, Li Haomiao fell into deep thought. Could the activation of the bloodline of a True Blood possessor follow Xu Yunfan's growth trajectory?

This was a method worth studying.

After all, possessing True Blood means practicing martial arts at an extremely fast speed in the early stages. One can reach the peak of a realm in a short time and form a main combat force.

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan's inner heat was naturally doused with cold water. He pursued the question, “Are there really True Immortals in this world?”

Li Haomiao raised his chin. “Isn't there one right in front of you?”

Looking at the skin wrapper not far away, Xu Yunfan asked suspiciously, “Does this count?”

“When your strength reaches a realm that is unimaginable to ordinary people, when you dig out the potential of the human body to the extreme and become a Supreme Expert, you can naturally be called a Land Immortal or God.”

“So they can die too.”

Xu Yunfan was speechless. He stood up, picked up his iron pick, and prepared to practice the Copper Body Art,顺便 (顺便 -顺便 - by the way) increasing his mining proficiency.

Just then, the sound of gongs and drums echoed from outside the main mine tunnel.

This sound meant it was time for rest.

Xu Yunfan felt a bit dazed. He had never thought he could stay in this dark mine for a full ten days without feeling any panic.

But he knew clearly that if it weren't for the Attribute Panel, these ten days would have been no different from hell.

He turned back to look at Li Haomiao. “We can leave the mine to rest for a few days. Are you going out?”

Li Haomiao looked up, his expression carrying a hint of something inexplicable.

“Naturally, I am going out.”

“Then let's go.”

Watching Xu Yunfan's retreating figure, Li Haomiao could no longer hold back and shouted, “Take me with you!”

“...”

When the supervisor Yang Gan led the group of mine slaves out of the sunless mine, Xu Yunfan squinted his eyes, looking at the bright sky.

Eight hundred miles of barren wasteland. Ninggu Pagoda was located in a depression. Looking around, there were continuous mountain ranges on all sides. The ridges wound their way up from the depression and spread out in all directions, their peaks covered in white snow.

Under the blowing cold wind, Xu Yunfan only felt threads of heart-piercing coldness frantically drilling into his bones, making his skin break out in goosebumps.

He turned his head to look at the crowd of people demoted to mine slaves around him. Without exception, they were all covered in black, their clothes in tatters, their faces basically covered in dark mine dust.
