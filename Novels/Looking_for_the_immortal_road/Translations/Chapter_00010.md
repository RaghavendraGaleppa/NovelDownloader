Chapter Ten: The Small Cauldron

The innkeeper's spirit was roused. He grabbed the gold ingot and examined it closely—indeed, it was a five-tael gold ingot! Five taels of gold, that was five hundred taels of silver. His best warhorse was worth at most fifty taels of silver, and his entire inn didn't earn a hundred taels in a month. This wasn't some country bumpkin; this was his very benefactor, a savior! Innkeeper Luo's mind raced, thinking of many adjectives to thank the unassuming young man before him. He immediately invited Zhao Di to sit at the main table in the inn and personally served a good cup of tea. Then, he stood by Zhao Di's side, instructing his staff one by one to fulfill the young master's requests. His demeanor was exactly that of a capable steward who had followed this young master for many years.

Innkeeper Luo was quite efficient. In a moment, he had dispatched his staff to buy food and drink, purchase clothes, prepare a carriage, and hire a driver, saving Zhao Di any further trouble.

"Young Master, your appearance is handsome and your aura extraordinary. One glance is enough to tell you are a dragon among men, someone ordinary people would remember for a lifetime. However, I, your humble servant, find Young Master's face very unfamiliar. I presume I have never seen Young Master before. Is this your first time in Xuanyuan City? It's a pity, Young Master, that you're buying a carriage, clearly intending to leave soon. If you had the time, I could take Young Master to visit some of the scenic and historical sites in Xuanyuan City. I've lived in the city since childhood and am very familiar with everything here." Innkeeper Luo observed Zhao Di's expression. Although Zhao Di didn't speak, only focused on sipping his tea, his eyes showed no impatience, but rather a hint of curiosity. So, he continued:

"Speaking of our Xuanyuan City, its origin is quite remarkable. This city was personally planned and built by Emperor Xuanyuan tens of thousands of years ago. I'm sure Young Master has heard of Emperor Xuanyuan's name; he was a legendary emperor who, by his own strength, almost unified a dozen countries in the eastern part of the entire Tianyuan Continent. Although the Great Xia Empire he established did not have a long history, lasting only about a thousand years, it had an extremely profound impact. In his later years, Emperor Xuanyuan neglected political affairs and specifically built this Xuanyuan City as his temporary palace, eventually passing away here. There are even legends that Emperor Xuanyuan's tomb, said to contain immense treasures, is also within Xuanyuan City, attracting many explorers for tens of thousands of years, but no one has ever found it. Another theory is that Emperor Xuanyuan had no tomb at all. This legendary emperor acted eccentrically, so it's possible he wouldn't have lavish funerary objects. Emperor Xuanyuan was born into poverty, but his talent was extraordinary. Legend has it that he had no parents, yet he could read and write at one year old, practice martial arts at two, speak with deeper wisdom than adults at three, and by five, his quick thinking was noticed by the local county magistrate, who recruited him as a strategist. At six, his brilliance shocked the entire nation, and by ten, he commanded a prefecture and became a provincial governor..."

The several attendants were also very efficient. In less than half an hour, while Innkeeper Luo was still eloquently narrating the legendary deeds of Emperor Xuanyuan, they had already prepared everything Zhao Di needed.

Zhao Di waved his hand, interrupting the now parched Innkeeper Luo, said, "To Luan City," and boarded the carriage, leaving Innkeeper Luo behind.

Innkeeper Luo didn't take offense at all; instead, he felt that young masters from wealthy families should act with such an air. His judgment of Zhao Di's identity deepened by several points.

Not long after Zhao Di's carriage left Xuanyuan City, the Baoli Pawnshop on Chang'an Street erupted.

"What! The kid's gone? What do you mean 'gone'? Don't tell me those injuries on you two were from him. That kid clearly doesn't know martial arts. How could the two of you possibly not defeat him? Don't tell me you two want to pocket those twenty-five taels of gold yourselves and are using this 'feigned injury' trick to deceive me! Hmph, let me tell you, I was using these tricks when you were still in diapers."

"What! You inflicted these injuries on yourselves! Why are you fighting each other instead of catching that country bumpkin! Don't try to fool me with lies. Honestly, I had intended to split those twenty-five taels of gold equally among the three of us. Each of you would get seven or eight hundred taels of silver. What's there to be dissatisfied about? You're even trying to swindle my share! I'm telling you, if you're smart, you'll hand over the gold obediently. Otherwise, if I find any clues, you'll be in for it!"

"Don't pretend. Kneeling won't help. If you hand over the gold, I'll kneel to you two!"

...

Xuanyuan City was less than two thousand kilometers from Luan City, and almost the entire route was a flat road. According to Zhao Di's estimate, by traveling during the day and resting at night, they could cover two to three hundred kilometers daily, reaching their destination in about seven or eight days. These days, he had been resting with his eyes closed, rarely leaving the carriage.

"Wind-Fire Leopard" Bao Dazhu was a minor bandit leader in Sheyu Mountain. Over ten years ago, a female relative of his was insulted by a rich young master and, in her shame and indignation, almost jumped into a river to commit suicide. After she was rescued, she went to the government to complain about the rich young master. However, for some unknown reason, she was instead imprisoned in the county yamen for disturbing the peace. Bao Dazhu had been stout and imposing since childhood, with astonishing strength and a quick, fierce temper. Upon hearing about this incident, he went to reason with the rich young master but was instead beaten black and blue by the family's servants. Enraged, Bao Dazhu, on a moonless, windy night, poured oil and set fire to the entire family's residence. He then fled several thousand kilometers to the vicinity of Luan City and became a bandit.

On this day, "Wind-Fire Leopard" Bao Dazhu, as usual, was monitoring the passing pedestrians and carriages on the official road below from a hidden spot on the mountain. He received a report from his front-line scout that a certain carriage had "goods." Although this carriage looked quite dilapidated, it was pulled by two horses, and there was only one driver. Judging from the tracks on the road, the items inside the carriage were definitely not light. The scout also mentioned that if they were to act, they needed to be quick, as another carriage pulled by four horses was not far behind and would likely catch up soon.

"Set up an ambush at Luofeng Pass. When the target arrives, act immediately and quickly," Bao Dazhu immediately ordered.

"Bandits! Run!" Zhao Di was resting with his eyes closed in the carriage when he suddenly heard a startled shout from the two drivers. These two drivers seemed to have practiced this many times; they flipped off both sides of the carriage before it even came to a complete stop, rolled a few times, and then sprinted away.

"Don't run!" This shout came from both the bandits and Zhao Di. But no one gave chase. The two drivers disappeared in the blink of an eye, their speed at that moment seemingly no less than that of the several fine horses they had been driving.

The carriage slowly stopped, and Zhao Di stepped out. Before exiting the carriage, he had swept it with his divine sense and already knew what had happened.

Seven or eight bandits were robbing a carriage, and he just happened to be passing by. He didn't know if this was Zhao Di's bad luck or the bandits' misfortune. Since he had encountered it, he couldn't just walk away.

Bao Dazhu was about to stab the carriage owner, who was kneeling and begging bitterly, when he saw a luxuriously dressed young master slowly emerge from the carriage behind him, lazily saying, "I didn't see anything, and I won't say anything. Why don't you let me pass? We can go our separate ways after this, and no one will bother anyone." Although his words sounded like begging for mercy, there wasn't a hint of fear in his tone.

Bao Dazhu snorted coldly. He detested rich young masters like this the most, so calm even at death's door. Did he not know how to write the word 'death'? He shot a glance at the thin, dark-skinned bandit closest to Zhao Di. The latter immediately shouted, "You can leave, but your life stays!" At the same time, he wildly swung his large saber and lunged at Zhao Di.

The rich young master sighed. The thin, dark-skinned bandit thought, "It's too late to sigh now, isn't it?" This was his last thought in the mortal world.

As the bandit charged, Zhao Di merely unleashed a Fireball spell, instantly incinerating him into ash. The other bandits stared in stunned silence at this bizarre scene for a good while.

"Scatter!" shouted one of the quicker-witted bandits, and so, the bandits, including Bao Dazhu, promptly dropped their heavy weapons and fled into the jungle on both sides of the road.

Zhao Di watched these bandits flee, showing no intention of pursuing them. He had no interest in upholding justice or dealing with these mortals. Moreover, he was merely passing through and would soon go to the distant Liuyun Market, so he wasn't worried about any hidden dangers from these people having seen his face. Cultivators and mortals inherently lived in different worlds.

"What is this?" Among the scattered gold, silver, and jade artifacts near the dilapidated carriage, Zhao Di discovered a strange small cauldron. This cauldron had three legs and two handles, and a lid. Both the lid and the round body of the cauldron were adorned with peculiar rune patterns. Upon closer inspection, these runes appeared to be lifelike, as if they were living things. It greatly resembled a magical artifact used by cultivators, yet there was no spiritual light shimmering from it. What truly shocked Zhao Di was that he distinctly remembered seeing this type of small cauldron somewhere before; it gave him an extremely familiar feeling, but for a moment, he couldn't recall where.

He picked up the small cauldron and studied it carefully, discovering that there seemed to be characters carved into its bottom. After careful identification, Zhao Di gasped in extreme shock, "Qiankun! These are actually the ancient characters for 'Qian' and 'Kun' from my previous life!"

In that instant, Zhao Di finally remembered when he had seen this cauldron before.
