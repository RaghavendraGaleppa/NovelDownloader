# Chapter 34: Successful Foundation Establishment

Wei Qian and the others had stayed in the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City for three days, yet there was still no news of Li Wanqing.  

Another three days passed with no word—not only from Li Wanqing’s group but also from Li Wanlong’s team, which was personally led by the Li Family Patriarch.  

Li Wanhai grew increasingly restless, and even Li Guchen began to panic.  

If both Li Family teams were wiped out, their foundation in Misty Ridge Mountain would be utterly destroyed.  

The Wang Family, with two Foundation Establishment cultivators at their disposal, would spare no effort to devour the Li Family whole. Without a Foundation Establishment expert to protect them, the Li Family would be completely defenseless.  

Among them all, Wei Qian was the most at ease.  

First, his talent in alchemy was exceptional. Even if the Li Family collapsed, finding another place to settle would be effortless for him.  

Second, when he saw Wang Shanyin at the alchemy workshop that day, he noticed the man was severely injured. This meant the Wang Family wouldn’t find it easy to crush the Li Family.  

The Li Family Patriarch had lived for nearly two hundred years—he had seen more salt than an ordinary person had eaten rice in their lifetime. He would never make a move that guaranteed certain death.  

Three more days passed before good news finally arrived.  

Li Wanqing had entered the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City!  

When Wei Qian saw Li Wanqing again, he was stunned.  

The once-elegant middle-aged man was now completely changed. His hair had turned white, and his face looked as though he had aged a decade.  

"Brother Qing!" Li Wanhai, who could barely walk, reddened at the sight.  

"What’s with the sentimentality?" Li Wanqing brushed it off with a laugh. "Being hunted by a Foundation Establishment cultivator and still escaping with my life is already a blessing."  

"Indeed. Quite the blessing." A cold, unwelcome voice cut in.  

It was Wang Shanyin, the Wang Family’s newly ascended Foundation Establishment expert.  

His face was dark with fury, his teeth clenched. He unleashed the full pressure of his cultivation without restraint, but Li Wanqing remained unfazed, instead flashing a mocking smile.  

Sure enough, a burly man in purple robes stepped forward, walking through the air.  

"Fellow Daoist, fighting is prohibited within the city," he warned Wang Shanyin.  

"Naturally, I know that!" Humiliated, Wang Shanyin flicked his sleeves and left.  

He didn’t dare violate the rules set by the Xiao Family. Even if he attacked, with the purple-robed man—who was at least at mid-Foundation Establishment—present, killing Li Wanqing would be impossible.  

"Finally, he's gone." Wei Qian, who had been quietly hiding behind the group, finally lifted his head.  

"I hope he didn’t notice me," he thought to himself.  

The reunion of the Li Family members was naturally a joyous occasion.  

Li Wanhai eagerly pulled Li Wanqing aside. "Brother Qing, now that you're here, we can finally participate in the auction, right?"  

Li Wanqing shook his head. "This isn’t the place to talk. Let’s find somewhere private."  

As an outsider, Wei Qian wasn’t privy to the Li Family’s discussions.  

Fortunately, he had a human "recorder"—Li Guchen. With a few carefully placed questions, Wei Qian extracted plenty of information.  

The most crucial detail was that Li Wanqing’s team had been nothing more than a decoy, sent to draw the Wang Family’s attention while the real mission unfolded elsewhere.  

That day, the Wang Family had received intelligence from a traitor within the Li Family, informing them that two groups would depart separately.  

They ignored Li Wanqing’s team, focusing instead on intercepting Li Xianyao and Li Wanlong’s group.  

But after waiting in vain, they realized something had gone wrong and scrambled to stop Li Wanqing’s team—lest he reach the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City and successfully establish his Foundation.  

Wang Shanyin, the Wang Family’s newly ascended Foundation Establishment expert, personally gave chase, coming agonizingly close to killing Li Wanqing.  

"The Li Family Patriarch took Li Wanlong to the Black Flood Dragon Immortal City to purchase a Foundation Establishment Pill," Wei Qian mused.  

"Li Wanqing’s team was nothing but a sacrifice. His storage pouch didn’t even contain the thirty thousand spirit stones meant for the pill."  

Wei Qian clicked his tongue in admiration. Only afterward had he realized his own mental blind spot.  

True, the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City was auctioning six Foundation Establishment Pills at a fixed price—but so what?  

The Zhao Kingdom’s cultivation world wasn’t limited to just one place selling them.  

"That traitor in the Li Family must have been discovered long ago," Wei Qian reasoned. "The Patriarch simply bided his time, feeding them false information at the critical moment. The entire situation could flip in an instant."  

Why "could"? Because the final hurdle was whether Li Wanlong could successfully establish his Foundation.  

In the best-case scenario, Li Wanlong would succeed, and the two Li Family Foundation Establishment experts would arrive at the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City together to secure another pill for Li Wanqing.  

With three Foundation Establishment experts in one family, they wouldn’t just fend off the Wang Family’s ambitions—they could even reverse the power dynamic entirely.  

"What a gamble—staking Li Wanqing’s life on it."  

If someone had asked Wei Qian to make such a sacrifice, he would have flatly refused.  

But Li Wanqing was a family cultivator. For the sake of his clan, even if he knew the path ahead was paved with knives and flames, he had no choice but to charge forward.  

And in the end, his gamble paid off.  

Though the cost was steep, he had made it to the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City alive.  

Of the original eight in their group, only Li Wanqing, Li Wanhai, Li Guchen, and Wei Qian remained.  

Strictly speaking, Li Guchen had only survived thanks to Wei Qian.  

Had Wei Qian not been part of the team, only Li Wanqing and Li Wanhai would have made it out alive.  

"Venturing out is dangerous. Staying on the mountain is far better." Wei Qian found himself longing for the simplicity of his past two years as a tenant farmer.  

Peace and stability were true treasures!  

"Now, everything depends on what happens in the Black Flood Dragon Immortal City."  

After half a month in the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City, they finally received the news they had been waiting for.  

The current head of the Li Family, Li Wanlong, had successfully established his Foundation!  

Even Wei Qian, an outsider, was moved by the news.  

"The Li Family Patriarch likely has fifteen to twenty years left to live. With two Foundation Establishment experts guarding Misty Ridge Mountain during that time, stability is assured. My farming and cultivation plans can proceed smoothly."  

Wei Qian estimated that within fifteen to twenty years, he would undoubtedly reach the late Qi Refinement stage. By then, he would still be under fifty.  

If he could break through to Great Perfection of Qi Refinement before sixty and attempt Foundation Establishment, he might even retain a sliver of hope for Core Formation!  

"For others, reaching Foundation Establishment is an arduous task—obtaining a single Foundation Establishment Pill is as difficult as climbing to the heavens."  

"But I’m different. My alchemy talent is exceptional. I can refine my own Foundation Establishment Pills!"  

Having something yourself is far better than relying on others.  

"Now, all that’s left is to wait for the two Li Family Patriarchs to arrive."
