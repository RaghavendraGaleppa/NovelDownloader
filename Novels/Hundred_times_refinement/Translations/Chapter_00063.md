# Chapter 13: Turning Waste into Treasure  

Over the next few days, Lin Xuan divided his time equally between practicing cultivation and studying the starry sea within his body. A week passed in the blink of an eye. Though he still hadn’t uncovered its secrets, he had at least managed to circulate the blue light as spiritual energy through his meridians more smoothly.  

"How exactly should I use this?"  

Lin Xuan toyed with a pill in his hand, carefully reviewing the experiments he had conducted with the blue light dots over the past days.  

Unlike other spirit pills, this one emitted a burnt odor—it was a failed pill given to him by Elder Ma. For cultivators, failed pills were useless, but Lin Xuan couldn’t bring himself to discard it. After all, the materials used to refine it were still precious spiritual treasures.  

Mere contemplation wouldn’t yield answers. To truly understand, he needed to experiment.  

"Let’s try circulating it through the meridians again."  

Lin Xuan had already attempted to channel the blue light as spiritual energy multiple times. Each time, when it reached the palm of his right hand, it would dissipate from his body. This was clearly the key, so he patiently repeated the process, hoping to find a breakthrough.  

Sitting cross-legged, he once again gathered the blue dots from his dantian into a ribbon of light and began the circulation. At first, everything proceeded smoothly—though slowly, the energy flowed steadily through his meridians until it reached his right wrist.  

Just as it was about to disperse, Lin Xuan focused his spiritual sense intently, determined to observe every detail he might have missed before.  

With his spiritual sense, he could clearly perceive the changes in the blue dots. They were about to reach his palm. Light, being formless and intangible, effortlessly passed through his meridians, blood vessels, and skin, dissipating outward—  

Wait!  

Lin Xuan’s expression shifted. This time was slightly different from before. The blue light did indeed leave his body, but instead of dispersing into the air, it seeped into something in his palm.  

The failed pill—he had forgotten to set it aside before starting the circulation.  

With this discovery, Lin Xuan concentrated even harder, continuously drawing more blue light from his dantian. Though he didn’t yet understand why the light reacted to the failed pill, this might just be the breakthrough he needed.  

Every detail could be the key to solving the puzzle!  

Proceeding cautiously, Lin Xuan controlled the blue light while using his spiritual sense to examine the pill. The image appeared directly in his mind: some of the blue dots entered the pill, while others were repelled and dissipated into the air.  

One minute passed.  

Two minutes passed.  

Ten minutes passed...  

The starry sea in his dantian had shrunk to only a third of its usual size. No matter how hard he tried now, he couldn’t summon any more light dots—this was clearly his limit. At the same time, a fragrant scent reached his nose.  

The young man opened his eyes. The once blackened, burnt pill had turned snow-white.  

A low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pill?  

Compared to his peers, Lin Xuan was far more composed. Though he hadn’t yet reached the level of remaining unshaken even if Mount Tai collapsed before him, he had long mastered the art of concealing his emotions. But exceptions existed—now, his face was filled with astonishment, and he even rubbed his eyes vigorously. Such an undignified reaction was rare for him.  

After staring for a long while, he confirmed he wasn’t mistaken. The fragrance still lingered in the air. It truly was a low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pill!  

"Hah!" No matter how steady or scheming he usually was, Lin Xuan couldn’t help but laugh heartily at this moment. A worthless, discarded pill had been transformed into a valuable elixir. Could it be that the blue light dots had the power to turn waste into treasure?  

If so, wouldn’t he be set for life?  

In the path of cultivation, innate talent was undoubtedly important. But with enough elixirs, even a mortal without spiritual roots could become a grandmaster—at least in theory. The reason this was rarely realized was simple: no cultivator, no matter how wealthy, could afford to consume pills like candy.  

But if the blue light dots truly could turn waste into treasure, the situation would be entirely different...  

Lin Xuan’s joy was immeasurable. However, he quickly suppressed his excitement and returned to a state of calm contemplation.  

He had always known this treasure was extraordinary, but he hadn’t expected its function to be so heaven-defying. Turning waste into treasure—this was something any cultivator would covet. Thus, the most crucial issue now was secrecy. No one could be allowed to know.  

He wasn’t sure how Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu had obtained the treasure, or if there had been a third party involved. But even if there was, Lin Xuan wasn’t worried. Both Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu were dead, and no one would suspect a lowly outer disciple like him.  

This matter could be set aside. The only thing he needed to be careful about was ensuring no one discovered the state of his dantian. But even this wasn’t too difficult. The human body was a marvel—even a cultivator far stronger than him could be easily shielded from scanning his dantian with spiritual sense, as long as he was cautious. The risk of exposure was minimal.  

With careful attention, keeping this secret should be easy. Reassured, Lin Xuan turned his thoughts to the benefits the blue light dots could bring him.  

To become a formidable cultivator, two conditions had to be met: first, decent spiritual roots—sufficient innate talent—and second, diligence. No laziness, no slacking off, overcoming all obstacles with single-minded dedication to cultivation.  

For Lin Xuan, the second condition was more than satisfied. Without boasting, his dedication was unmatched in the Piaoyun Valley. As a mere Qi Refining disciple, he had dared to train on the Path of Tempering the Heart—proof of his unwavering commitment.  

The reason his cultivation was weak was simple: he lacked spiritual roots. He was just an ordinary mortal, and mortals who cultivated progressed at a pitifully slow pace.  

But this situation was about to change. While mortals had to work twice as hard to achieve half the results in cultivation, there were ways to compensate. With enough elixirs, even a rootless mortal could become a grandmaster. Of course, pills weren’t candy—even the wealthiest sects couldn’t afford such extravagance.  

But if the blue light dots could truly turn waste into treasure, everything would be different...
