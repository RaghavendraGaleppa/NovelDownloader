## Chapter 44: Transition

The staff led the two of them to the VIP seats. These VIP seats were much more unrefined, with minimal decoration; the entire front section was open, offering a direct view of the competition below.

No sooner had they settled down than a golden light erupted from the center of the arena. A dragon's roar, clear and distant, shook the heavens and echoed through the nine skies. A golden divine dragon rose into the heavens, circling in the air. Its massive body was as thick as a mountain range, its eyes sharp and soul-stirring. The audience in the stands fell silent, the commotion dying down.

Roar!

Another dragon roar. The mountain-sized golden divine dragon in the sky exploded, its divine light illuminating the entire area. Endless runes surged forth, and a ten-thousand-zhang-tall figure appeared in the air, shrouded in divine light, its face indistinct. Various miraculous phenomena emanated from it; countless divine phantoms knelt in worship, chanting sounds arose, and a dense, Human Dao Sacred Qi pervaded the space.

The giant figure moved, tapping out a ripple in the air. Sacred light surged forth, and from deep within the imperial palace, a golden pillar shot up, connecting heaven and earth. Countless smaller golden pillars then dispersed across the entire Futian Province.

One golden light landed in the imperial city. It burst open, transforming into a screen, and the giant figure appeared within it.

"Citizens of the Tianqin Empire!"

The figure spoke, its voice like morning bells and evening drums, the Great Dao roaring through the sky. Yet, to each person's ear, it sounded just right. It was the Qin Emperor's voice.

"The Youth Grand Competition has begun. This is a grand event..."

The Qin Emperor continued speaking his empty rhetoric, while Zhou Tian marveled at the golden pillars he had just witnessed.

"Live broadcast? What amazing technology!"

He could tell that the golden lights shooting in all directions were just like the golden pillar that landed in the imperial city, capable of projecting screens. Wasn't this a live broadcast?

Tian Ling fluttered her big eyes and chimed in, "Yes, such a projection array consumes enormous human and material resources. They spent such a huge price so that everyone in the entire province could witness this grand event."

The Qin Emperor's empty words soon ended. With his single command, "Begin!"

All the arenas glowed faintly, and figures appeared on the platforms. The entire venue began to grow noisy again.

These were the preliminary rounds. With a thousand contestants, one-on-one matches would take forever. So, the top sixteen would be decided this way, and only then would the competition proceed with single arena matches.

Tian Ling did not have a match today; hers was scheduled for tomorrow. After only a short while of watching, Zhou Tian felt bored. What was so great about this?

He looked at Tian Ling beside him, engrossed in the spectacle. Today, Tian Ling wore a cyan long dress, her figure exquisitely shaped. Although her chest was a bit flat, her lines were beautiful, her skin as soft as icy jade. With a lewd grin, Zhou Tian reached out his mischievous hand.

"Ling'er, what's so interesting about a bunch of people fighting?"

"Just let me watch for a bit, please, just for a bit..." Tian Ling really enjoyed battles. She swatted Zhou Tian's hand away and pleaded.

"Is it really that good to watch?" Zhou Tian scooped Tian Ling into his arms. Amidst her exclamations, another intimate interlude unfolded...

The morning quickly passed. The matches concluded, determining the hundred winners. Of the remaining hundred, some were dead, others crippled. In the competition, if one shouted "I concede," the opponent was not allowed to continue their attack. However, there were always those who couldn't shout it in time, or whose opponents deliberately prevented them from doing so. All in all, about one-third of the contestants died.

On the carriage ride back, Tian Ling glared at Zhou Tian, her cheeks puffed out.

"It's all your fault! I didn't get to watch the matches properly today!"

As their relationship grew closer, Tian Ling had reverted to her girlish nature, speaking without restraint.

"What's so good about fighting? Is it better than looking at me?" Zhou Tian joked and bantered. Seeing Tian Ling's pouty expression, he found it quite cute. He was also happy that Tian Ling was no longer reserved around him.

"Those are two different things..." Tian Ling's face flushed slightly. Although Zhou Tian was indeed handsome, she remained completely unaffected, seeing through his intentions very clearly and not falling into his trap.

"So, do you want me to compensate you, then...?" Zhou Tian leaned closer and asked.

"No..." Tian Ling quickly waved her hand. From her understanding of Zhou Tian, any "compensation" from him would invariably mean she would be the one to suffer.

"Too late... Heh heh..." Zhou Tian chuckled lewdly and pounced.

"No... Ugh..."

Before she could finish her sentence, her mouth was sealed, lips and teeth intertwining...

Tian Ling had another match tomorrow, so Zhou Tian didn't entangle with her for too long. After returning to Prince Qin's Residence, they parted ways. Although it was still early, he had nothing else to do, so he found a few books and started reading. This was a method he had found to pass the time recently, and it also allowed him to cram some knowledge about this world.

Zhou Tian really didn't want to go to the matches the next day, but since Tian Ling was competing, he still went to watch.

Her opponent was a cultivator of the same level. As expected, after a difficult battle... Tian Ling pulled out the longsword gifted by Zhou Ying and sliced her opponent in two with one strike. Blood flowed across the arena; the opponent didn't even have time to say "I concede."

Watching Tian Ling's unflinching expression, Zhou Tian looked dumbfounded. She would blush for ages just from a kiss, yet she sliced a person in half without changing her expression. Women... truly magical creatures.

As for winning with a Sacred Artifact, Tian Ling had no psychological barrier. She wasn't an idiot. What was wrong with using a weapon? Was she not allowed to use a weapon in a life-and-death struggle? If you're so capable, you use one too!

At this stage, essentially none of the important figures bothered to watch the matches. Everyone was very busy. The current battles weren't worth watching. Hadn't anyone noticed that even the opening ceremony had been sparsely attended?

In the remaining days of the competition, Zhou Tian only went to watch Tian Ling's matches. It was basically the same routine: first, a bitter struggle, then drawing out her Sacred Sword and slicing the opponent to death with one strike. This caused Tian Ling's ranking to continuously rise over these few days. In the information, "Possesses a Sacred Artifact" was clearly marked in red!

However, it was unrealistic to win the championship relying solely on this one Sacred Artifact. After all, as more lone cultivators were eliminated, more people with power and background emerged. Sacred Artifacts were not as rare as one might think; for those with influence and connections, acquiring one was usually possible, as Sacred King Artifacts were beyond what cultivators at their realm could activate.

Days passed by quickly, and soon the top sixteen were decided. Tian Ling, wielding a Sacred Artifact, was prominently among them. The remaining few were disciples from the major vassal forces of the Tianqin Empire, none of whom Zhou Tian could name.

But he didn't need to know them. How to put it? These people might struggle their entire lives and still find it hard to be worth a single word from Zhou Tian.

This was also why Zhou Tian and his companions were too lazy to watch the matches. It wasn't that they looked down on them; it was simply that they were not on the same level, and there was no need to pay them excessive attention.

Some distances cannot be bridged by effort alone. For instance, individuals like Zhou Xunchuan had noble births, outstanding talent, and were even willing to work hard. How, then, could one make up that gap?
