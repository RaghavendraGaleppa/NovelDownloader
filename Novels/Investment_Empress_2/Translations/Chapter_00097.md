# Chapter 97: Do I Really Look Like a Bad Guy?

Night had fallen.

The city of Ziyang Prefecture was silent, like a colossal beast silently crawling under the moonlight.

"Everything is dry!"

"Watch out for fire!"

The slightly hoarse voice of the night watchman echoed through the empty streets.

Recently, the nights in Ziyang Prefecture had been unsafe, and many more guards had been stationed to patrol the streets.

However, compared to the vast size of the city, this was merely a drop in the bucket.

Luo Yao, dressed in night clothes, roamed the city.

She had heard from her returning senior brother that the prefecture was conducting the Rainless Pavilion's Hell Trial.

Besides the participants of the trial killing each other, many others were taking advantage of the chaos to loot and cause trouble.

That was why she deliberately came out at night to perform chivalrous deeds.

After all, assassins prefer to act at night.

However...

"Luo Yao."

"I have been waiting for you for a long time."

As she passed an alley, a voice came from within.

In the darkness, a thin figure seemed to have been standing there all along, or perhaps had appeared out of thin air.

He was gaunt, and the black robe covering his body was pressed tight against his skin by the night wind.

"You are only at the Qi Blood Realm, and you're not near Fenyu Forest, yet you dare to flaunt a famous weapon in public. I thought you had an expert following you."

"I didn't expect you to have actually run away on your own."

The man's voice grew more ethereal.

As his words fell, a ghostly wind seemed to blow around them, making one feel as if they had fallen into an ice cellar, their scalp tingling with fear.

"Night Ghost Liu Heng?!"

Luo Yao recognized the visitor, and her beautiful face turned pale with shock.

The Night Ghost Sect was a lineage passed down from a single master to a single disciple.

Due to their诡异 techniques requiring special bones, those who practiced the Night Ghost Sect's martial arts would become gaunt, look inhuman, and have eccentric temperaments.

Moreover, their power would greatly decrease during the day but increase dramatically at night.

The previous master of the Night Ghost Sect, Liu Heng's master, had died in the encirclement at Fenyu Forest.

"I love eating children the most."

"Especially... ones like you, in the prime of your youth..."

"My father killed your master, so I'm not afraid of you!"

In her terror, Luo Yao actually attacked first.

The Gentleman's Brush in her sleeve shot out like a cold star, faster than lightning, capable of piercing even fine steel.

However, just as she thought she had succeeded...

Luo Yao's figure before him dissipated like a phantom.

"A fake?!"

"Hehehe... Your Purple Star Eyes are not yet fully developed."

A voice like that of an owl came from all directions.

The sound waves alone sent Luo Yao flying backward, rolling several times on the ground. Her spotless silk clothes were immediately covered in mud and water.

Furthermore, her hand had stung in that moment, and she had lost the Gentleman's Brush.

"Truly a famous weapon."

"The Judge will surely like it..."

Liu Heng toyed with the Gentleman's Brush and put it away in his robe.

He walked slowly toward Luo Yao, using his own back to block the moonlight.

He most enjoyed watching the expressions of those handsome, righteous heroes as they faced death.

Would this little girl cry and beg for mercy?

Would she try to buy her life with money?

Or... would she threaten him?

"Ugh..."

Luo Yao's face was deathly pale, her eyes filled with despair.

She was both regretful and unable to understand.

Was the Jianghu truly this treacherous?

The opponent was clearly at the Profound Core Realm, yet he had no shame in attacking her, a mere Qi Blood Realm practitioner. Was this not bullying the weak with superior strength?

At home, she had never experienced such pain...

Was she... going to die?

The young girl cried like a pear blossom drenched in rain.

"I don't want to die..."

"Hehe..."

"On the hands of such an ugly monster, sob, sob..."

Liu Heng's laughter abruptly stopped.

He hated being called ugly the most, even though it was true.

Lies do not hurt people, the truth does...

"You are courting death!"

He lost all interest in playing with her and raised a palm to take Luo Yao's life.

At that critical moment.

*BOOM!*

Thunder?

No, it was the sound of air exploding.

A dark stream of light, like a divine punishment or a meteor falling from the sky, slammed down.

The powerful pressure of the wind made it almost difficult to breathe.

"Who?!"

---

Liu Heng used his old trick again, his figure vanishing from its original spot.

After he dodged, the dark light also stopped, revealing the figure of the man.

He was tall and slender, wearing a bronze dragon-headed mask. The dark light from earlier was actually a small short-handled hammer in his hand.

A Mystic Weapon!

"Friend, I presume you are also from the Jianghu."

"Since that's the case, finders keepers. Give me the girl's life, and everything else is yours. How about it?"

Liu Heng's eyes flickered as he spoke.

"Isn't the Hell Trial about fighting to the death the moment you meet?"

The man with the Azure Dragon mask said with a light laugh.

"One should choose one's opponents based on strength. You are a powerful expert, and we might even be colleagues in the future. Why must we fight?"

Liu Heng said with full sincerity.

"Alright, let's do as you say. You can have her."

The Azure Dragon mask nodded twice, seemingly agreeing to his terms.

*Step—*

Liu Heng had only taken a few steps.

Suddenly, a ghostly wind surged from beneath his robe, and he launched a surprise attack.

In response was the hammer, overflowing with the killing intent of warfare.

"I knew you weren't being honest!" x2

Li Mo brought his hammer down on the opponent's claw, scattering sparks from the claw's锋芒.

Liu Heng's figure was sent flying back and vanished once more.

Immediately after, his voice echoed from all directions:

"Hehehe, so you haven't even reached the Jade Liquid Realm yet."

"You only rely on a Mystic Weapon and body-refining to dare cross two realms to fight me?"

"It is night right now!"

Countless ghostly shadows, accompanied by a ghostly wind, attacked. Liu Heng's figure seemed to drift along with his voice.

But the eyes beneath the Azure Dragon mask, in contrast, closed at this moment.

When he raised his hammer again, the air around him seemed to solidify.

After tempering himself in the domain of the Merchant's Dance, he no longer needed to rely on his eyes to see.

He could find his opponent solely by sensing the killing intent.

Thus.

The hammer passed through the layers of ghostly shadows, slowly but firmly landing on one of them.

*BOOM—*

The expression on Liu Heng's face didn't even have time to change.

This inescapable hammer turned him into a mist of blood.

The force of this hammer was so concentrated that after shattering Liu Heng, it didn't even damage a single brick or tile.

"You know, if you wanted to fight, you should have done it sooner."

"You just had to enjoy playing with your prey..."

Li Mo stopped halfway through his sentence, suddenly remembering.

In the past when playing games, even with a huge advantage, he didn't like to push the crystal. He preferred to trap the enemy in their fountain...

Hmm.

Why did he suddenly understand what the villain was thinking?

"You... who are you?"

"If you're going to kill me... let me... die knowing who you are."

The trembling voice of a certain little mouse exposed her fear.

"You can call me the Hammer King of the Northwest."

Li Mo casually picked up the Gentleman's Brush, glanced at it, and tossed it back to the young girl.

"You're not going to kill me?"

"If you don't leave, I'll hammer you to death."

Li Mo scared her.

He didn't know what to make of this little girl all of a sudden.

Come on, do I really look like a bad guy?

She has a chance to run but instead asks questions?

"Thank you... but I haven't heard of you. Which sect are you from?"

"The Hard-Bang Gang."

"I've got it memorized. I will repay you..."

Luo Yao ran a few steps, then turned back.

"By the way, do you know where Luo Yu from Fenyu Forest is?"

"In the prefectural office."

Black lines appeared on Li Mo's forehead.

"Thank you, you're a pretty good person."

Luo Yao finally left.

Not long after she left.

Another cautious figure crept into the alley.

"You're not done yet..."

Li Mo thought it was Luo Yao returning.

But when he looked over.

He saw a little beggar with very clean clothes, like a little mouse, scurrying into the alley.

She was carrying a basket on her back, her eyes still covered with a strip of cloth. Her basket was filled with all sorts of miscellaneous things, and she was holding a tree branch in her arms.

She raised her head, and one could feel the caution in her white eyes behind the cloth.

"Um... do you have any things you don't need...?"

Li Mo: "....."
