# Chapter 25: Spiritual Roots of Immortal Cultivation

Lin Shan lay sprawled on the floor, staring blankly at the ceiling, consumed by a torrent of emotions—disappointment, frustration, and helplessness.

"Talent, talent! How laughable! I thought that as a transmigrator with a golden finger, I would be different, destined to soar to greatness. Yet here I am, barred from the path of immortality simply because I lack the innate talent!"

Without the ability to cultivate immortality, what did it matter if he became a peak martial artist? A mere century of life awaited him. Even with his enhancement panel and the ability to gather ancient essence to strengthen cultivation manuals and artifacts, they would be useless without the spiritual power of a cultivator. What was the point of hoarding them?

He thought of the Buddhist Patriarch in the immortal realm, whose teachings spanned countless worlds, to whom ten thousand years were but the blink of an eye. In contrast, he was nothing more than an ant, a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of time, forgotten in an instant.

Suppressing his weakness, Lin Shan picked up the "Evergreen Wood Longevity Scripture" again, poring over it repeatedly. With the enhancement panel—a heaven-defying opportunity—he refused to resign himself to mediocrity.

---

Time slipped away as he read the manual over and over, his vision blurring from exhaustion. Yet, an inexplicable willpower kept him going.

Then, in a sudden moment of clarity, a passage from the introductory chapter struck him:

"Through one's spiritual roots, activate the corresponding incantation to absorb the spiritual energy of the corresponding attribute from the world."

It was as if a light had been lit in his mind.

"I understand! The Evergreen Wood Longevity Scripture is a wood-attribute cultivation technique. Its incantations assist wood spiritual roots in absorbing wood-attribute spiritual energy. If I can't sense wood spiritual energy, it simply means I lack a wood spiritual root—but that doesn't mean I don't have spiritual roots of other attributes!"

To become an immortal cultivator, one must possess the ability to sense and absorb spiritual energy, which requires corresponding spiritual roots—the so-called "cultivation aptitude." The world was filled with spiritual energy of various attributes: metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, lightning, ice, and more. Just because he couldn't sense wood spiritual energy didn't mean he was incapable of sensing others.

With this realization, his path forward became clear.

"I still have a chance! I currently have 8 points of ancient essence left, enough to enhance another Qi Refining manual. No—there's also the Golden Bell!"

If he could acquire the Golden Bell's 8 points, he would have two opportunities. What he lacked now were two different types of innate-level martial arts manuals.

As for obtaining innate-level manuals, the only source he could think of was the Nightingale. But each manual required 1,000 contribution points. Two manuals would cost 2,000!

If he relied solely on completing missions, he would never accumulate enough in his lifetime.

But with his newfound clarity, his mind raced faster. He recalled the morning in Yongchang County when he had left the city with the group—how Protector Jiang had seemed to be lacking a divine weapon.

---

A plan began to take shape in Lin Shan's mind. If successful, he could not only secure the innate manuals but also obtain the Golden Bell safely.

Reinvigorated by hope, Lin Shan staggered to his feet, went to a nearby restaurant for a hearty meal, and rested at home overnight.

At dawn the next day, while the streets were still quiet, he stealthily made his way to the Tranquil Abode—the Nightingale's branch headquarters.

---

"Elder Jiang, your dedication is truly commendable. It's thanks to esteemed seniors like you that the Nightingale continues to thrive."

In the exchange hall on the third floor of the Tranquil Abode, a handsome young man clad in black was lavishing praise on an elderly man seated before him.

It was none other than Lin Shan, who had just completed the mission related to the Ancient Tomb of Yelang.

Opposite him, reclining in an armchair, was none other than Elder Jiang—the same man who had tricked him before.

"Hmm, you are...?"

Elder Jiang squinted at the young man, stroking his beard as he tried to recall who this person was. With so many Nightingale assassins dressed in identical black attire, they all looked more or less the same unless they had particularly distinctive features.

"Your memory fails you, Elder. About half a month ago, I nearly barged into the fourth floor and disturbed Protector Jiang's meditation. It was you who stopped me in time."

Lin Shan smiled warmly.

"Ah—it's you! The new recruit who didn't know the rules."

Elder Jiang finally remembered. That day, he had been fortunate to swindle this young man out of 50 contribution points in exchange for a wrist crossbow. If not for that, he might not have met last month's quota.

Ever since the branch leader had gone on a long journey and Protector Jiang had taken over, sweeping reforms had been implemented to consolidate power. To stimulate internal spending and prevent members from hoarding contribution points inherited from predecessors—which would devalue the organization's martial arts and techniques—Protector Jiang had imposed strict performance targets on the exchange hall's managers.

While Elder Jiang couldn't fully grasp Protector Jiang's grand vision, he had no choice but to comply. He had gone all out in persuading assassins to spend their points, even selling a simple steel blade for 20 contribution points!

But the well eventually ran dry. After being swindled repeatedly, the assassins had grown wary, making it increasingly difficult for Elder Jiang and his colleagues to meet their quotas. Their only remaining targets were new recruits—like Lin Shan, who had unwittingly become their victim, spending 50 points on a wrist crossbow.

That said, the wrist crossbow had proven invaluable when killing Scarface. Without that shot to Scarface's leg, Lin Shan might have had a much harder time catching him.

---

Now, seeing this "fat sheep" return of his own accord, Elder Jiang's eyes gleamed with the prospect of another profitable encounter.

"Young friend, since you're new to the organization, you must have many questions. Feel free to share your concerns with this old man. Guiding the younger generation is our duty."

Elder Jiang wore a kindly expression, his tone gentle and encouraging.

"There is indeed a matter I'd like to ask for your help with, but I fear it may trouble you..." Lin Shan feigned hesitation, sighing heavily.

Elder Jiang immediately put on a stern face.

"What kind of talk is that? If a junior in the organization needs assistance, it's our duty as seniors to help. Don't stand on ceremony—or this old man will take offense!"

Lin Shan bowed respectfully. "Your virtue is unmatched, Elder! Truly, you are a pillar of the Nightingale. I am humbled."

Then, clasping his fists, he continued, "I wish to seek Protector Jiang's guidance on the fourth floor. Would you be so kind as to arrange an introduction?"

---

The air grew heavy with silence.

Elder Jiang's smile vanished as he stared at Lin Shan for a long moment, ensuring the young man wasn't joking. Then, in a low voice, he said, "Do you understand what you're asking?"

"Please, Elder, arrange the introduction!" Lin Shan bowed again.

"Disturbing Protector Jiang's meditation—even I, as a manager here, would face severe consequences—"

Before he could finish, a small, exquisite teapot was pressed into his hands. It was made of a material that resembled both bronze and wood, exuding an ancient aura that spoke of its noble origins.

Once again, Lin Shan had employed his transmigrator's trump card—the art of bribery, a tactic that had never failed him.

"This is—?"

Elder Jiang's eyes gleamed with recognition. Having managed the Nightingale's exchange hall for years, he had seen countless treasures. He could tell at a glance that this antique was extraordinary—worth at least several hundred gold pieces.

"This is a family heirloom. One of my ancestors served in the imperial court centuries ago and brought it back."

In truth, it was one of the artifacts Lin Shan had looted from the Ancient Tomb of Yelang. But he shamelessly passed it off as a family treasure.

"As the saying goes, 'Antiques are best appreciated by connoisseurs.' In my hands, it would be a waste. It's only fitting that it belongs to you, Elder, as thanks for your guidance."

Lin Shan subtly alluded to the wrist crossbow incident.

Elder Jiang coughed awkwardly. "That day, I merely recommended the wrist crossbow for your protection, seeing as you were new. But tell me—why do you wish to see Protector Jiang?"

Ordinarily, Elder Jiang would never agree to such a troublesome request. But the bribe was simply too generous to refuse.

Lin Shan shook his head. "I have some questions to ask, but I'd rather not disclose them. Regardless of whether Protector Jiang agrees to see me, the teapot is yours—a token of my respect."

With matters standing thus, Elder Jiang could hardly refuse. He sighed and laid out the terms.

"Very well. I'll take you to Protector Jiang, but you must not overstep your bounds. If anything goes wrong, don't blame me for washing my hands of the matter!"

Lin Shan nodded eagerly, thumping his chest in assurance that he wouldn't cause any trouble.

"Follow me, then."

Tucking the teapot into his sleeve, Elder Jiang led the way to the fourth floor, with Lin Shan close behind.
