# Chapter 160: Pact of the Six Paths

“Xuanzhen Sect’s sword banner.”

Hu Zhenyue’s cheek twitched. The whip in his hand spun three times in his palm before he finally turned his horse around. “Let’s go! Back to the sect!”

On the watchtower, Mo Shisan watched the dust kicked up by the Hu family’s cavalry. The light sound of gears meshing reached his ears.

The 3,600 Xuan Steel bricks on the fortress's outer wall were shifting, revealing蜂窝弩机 (honeycomb ballistae), ready and waiting.

The Tiangong Fortress was waiting for news from Hong Baichuan and the others. Once confirmed, the Tiangong Branch disciples anchored below the Ghost Weeping Abyss would send a signal.

The twilight stained the lingering clouds with a rust color, and the sound of wind through the pines on the ridge was interspersed with intermittent crow cries.

“These little brats, they’ve grown unruly after enjoying too many peaceful days.”

In the distance, three people were galloping towards them. It was Xu Yunfan and his group returning to Shu Prefecture from Qingyue Xuanzhen Sect.

They had descended the mountain with three people, but now they returned in a bustling crowd surrounded by Xuanzhen Sect disciples.

Everyone hopes to have a good weapon in hand. Since the Sect Master had set the tone and Tiangong Cave was incorporated into Lingnan Dao, and it was a major sect for forging weapons, it was only natural to offer some protection…

Of course, they also hoped to see if they could get a fine weapon forged for themselves.

Standing on a ridge, Xiong Kun’s tower-like figure stood at the edge, his feet pressing the bluestone down by three inches.

“Some time ago, the Incense Fire Cult caused chaos. That nest of jackals from the Hu family aided the tyrant, committing numerous heinous acts. Last month, they even dared to transport blood urns for the Incense Fire Cult. If I hadn't been restricted from leaving the mountain, I would have wiped out their entire family!”

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but glance at the somewhat angry Xiong Kun.

In the Great Zhou’s Six Paths and Seventy-Nine Prefectures, when the six top sects turned a blind eye, you never saw such righteous indignation.

Three days ago, when passing through Yong Prefecture in Lingnan Dao, it was clear that the Xuanzhen Sect patrolling disciples turned a blind eye to the scenes of cities being burned. Yet now, they put on such a righteous appearance.

However, this thought merely passed through Xu Yunfan’s mind, and he didn't show any sign of it.

These high and mighty top sects have values completely different from the common values of the lower classes.

Fundamentally, they are the high and mighty "Heavenly Dragons," and their so-called justice has a very clear distinction from the common justice of the lower classes.

“Brother Xiong, please be careful with your words.”

The pale-faced Taoist accompanying them placed his hand on the sword hilt at his waist.

“The Hu family committed these crimes. Xuanzhen Sect will naturally deal with them according to the ‘Pact of the Six Paths’.”

Before the words had faded, there was a sudden commotion of startled birds at the end of the mountain path. More than ten black-maned horses galloped through the thin mist, the riders all wearing black tight-fitting clothes embroidered with gold patterns—the标志 (mark) of the Law Enforcement Hall of Qingyue Xuanzhen Sect.

“Hmph, the Pact of the Six Paths again.”

Xiong Kun’s expression was displeased. “When I led the disciples of the Zilang Peak down the mountain to stop the Incense Fire Cult in Yong Prefecture, several elders forcibly held me back on the mountain, not allowing me to take a single step, using this damn pact as an excuse. Now they are suddenly so active. I saw disciples descending the mountain just a few days ago, claiming to ‘eliminate demons and defend the Dao’ and to clean up the Incense Fire Cult.”

The pale-faced Taoist’s face darkened slightly. “Brother, if you continue to speak nonsense, I might have to deal with you according to the sect rules!”

Xiong Kun grumbled for a good while in his mouth but ultimately said nothing more.

The six major sects have always used the Pact as a cover. Their current swift and fierce action today seems like they are rushing to silence the endless public criticism.

Watching the Xuanzhen Sect Law Enforcement Hall disciples wielding weapons, leaping forward one by one to intercept and kill the Hu family, faintly, one could hear the roars and wails coming from down the mountain.

The mountain wind swept the smell of blood past the tip of his nose, and he suddenly remembered the folk songs sung by storytellers in Beiye City, Qingzhou.

“On the golden throne sits the Bodhisattva, chanting Amitabha amidst a pile of white bones.”

As the Xuanzhen Sect众人 (crowd) rounded the final Broken Dragon Cliff, a dull metallic roar suddenly came from the entire ridge. The steam jetting out created a whole layer of smoke, making the clouds and mist seem to curl around it.

The Law Enforcement Hall disciples pulled their reins tight in unison. Thirty Zhang away in the depths of the clouds, sixteen steel limbs with a cold, dark green light were slowly flexing and extending like the joints of a giant spider.

Each pillar, with a diameter exceeding thirty Zhang, was covered in large and small gear sets. Hundreds of transmission chains made of Xuan Steel trembled at the joints with a sound like a dragon's chant.

“This… this is Tiangong Cave?”

The disciples at the front almost fell off their horses.

They had originally thought that the so-called relocation would just be hundreds of disciples carrying boxes and walking in a winding line.

But they saw a colossal object before them, cast entirely in Xuan Iron. The turtle-shell-like armor exterior was densely covered with rivets thicker than a person. In the center of the back armor, a mechanical tiger's head stood high, and each layer of eaves projected crossbows with chillingly sharp light. At the top of the tower, thirty-two bronze suspension arms were folding and retracting. The sound of gears meshing made one’s teeth ache.

It was actually a full head taller than the mountain in front of them.

The whip in Xiong Kun’s hand snapped with a “pop”.

The largest thing he had ever seen was the Four Symbols Battle Beasts kept at the back mountain of the Qingyue Mountain of Xuanzhen Sect. Those three-Zhang-tall primordial beasts, compared to this moving fortress, were like lynxes facing a saber-toothed giant tiger.

When the fortress's bottom emitted three streams of white-hot steam, the gravel within a radius of five li trembled slightly with the rhythm of the sixteen mountain-supporting pillars rising and falling, as if the entire mountain had become a plaything under the feet of this mechanical beast.

“The Mo Family Mechanical City recorded in the ‘Tiangong Kaimu Lu’… it actually exists…”

The compass needle hidden in the pale-faced Taoist’s sleeve spun wildly.

He noticed that every time a Xuan Steel limb landed, the huge buffer device would shatter spider-web-like cracks into the ground, while a force extended upwards from the earth layer by layer, providing at least half the kinetic energy for the next lift. This was the Tiangong Branch's unique technique, the "Earth Vein Diversion Technique," which could turn the power of the mountain into mechanical power.

What was even more terrifying was the armor plates slowly opening on the fortress's flanks, revealing honeycomb-shaped launch nests inside. Each hexagonal hole flickered with the unique dark blue cold light of Thunderfire Bombs.

The mountain wind carried the unique smell of sulfur from the cast iron furnaces, mixed with the burnt scent of whale oil overflowing from the gearboxes.

After watching for a long time, Xiong Kun retracted his gaze and said with emotion, “No wonder the Sect Master values your Tiangong Cave so much. You have actually reproduced the ancient Mo Family Mechanical City.”

Hong Baichuan tapped the Xuan Steel spider leg passing in front of him with his knuckles. The metallic resonance was mixed with the faint sound of gears meshing.

“Brother Xiong overpraises us. Compared to the Mo Family Mechanical City, this fortress is just an iron turtle that can move.”

He pointed to a retracting spider leg joint in the southwest corner, where steam was jetting out sulfur-scented white mist from the heat dissipation slot. “The true Mo Family relic city could turn its eaves into wings and its city gates into shields. Three hundred and sixty mechanisms corresponded to the celestial stars. Unlike us, after a thousand years of struggle, we only managed to install a few legs on this iron shell. The Mo Family Mechanical City back then could float in the nine heavens, floating above the clouds. Unlike us, who exerted all our effort to forge an iron lump that only knows how to move.”

Xiong Kun’s gilded vambrace collided with the Xuan Steel leg, sending sparks flying.

This Zilang Peak Master of Xuanzhen Sect was naturally of a strange appearance. His nine-Chi tall frame, wrapped in a wide Taoist robe, still couldn't hide his strong physique. The vigorous blood energy occasionally surging within him made people take notice.
