# Chapter 154: The Mission

Li Shiming didn't understand why the sect had recently increased its focus on array tasks so significantly. The last two senior array masters of the sect had proposed multiple enhancement plans, all of which were now being implemented. 

Previously, such proposals were merely theoretical studies. The sect would never approve the consumption of vast amounts of precious array materials just to marginally increase the power of a formation. But now, it seemed as though array resources were being drawn from the sect's treasury without restraint.

Li Shiming had initially thought it would take a long time to complete his 50,000 merit-point task. However, given the current trend, he estimated he could achieve it within the year. His cultivation progress remained rapid, but he didn't delve into why the sect was suddenly investing so heavily in arrays. 

Unless he revealed his identity as a senior array master—but after observing for some time, he realized that doing so would leave him with little rest and might even hinder his cultivation. His sense of belonging to the sect had waned significantly after a certain incident, so he no longer considered things from the sect's perspective. 

Of course, as a Qi Refining cultivator, sect affairs were far removed from him, and he couldn't be bothered to inquire. Every day, he completed one array task after another, earning substantial merit points.

Today, Li Shiming was summoned to the Lingji Pavilion by Elder Song. 

When he entered, he saw a middle-aged woman sitting in the spot where Elder Zhuge used to sit—Elder Song, the sect's other senior array master. 

"Greetings, Elder Song!" Li Shiming suppressed his nostalgia for Elder Zhuge and bowed. 

"Li Shiming, you rarely visit the Lingji Pavilion," Elder Song remarked coolly. 

Li Shiming was about to explain when Elder Song waved her hand, signaling him to remain silent. 

"I called you here for this." She tossed him a jade slip. 

Li Shiming pressed it to his forehead. Inside was an array blueprint and a sect map detailing a series of formations to be set up at intervals from a thousand li outside the sect all the way to the Seven Stars Islands. 

He recognized the array—it was designed for message transmission and scanning spiritual fluctuations, serving both communication and surveillance purposes. 

For him, setting up such formations wasn't particularly difficult as long as materials were sufficient. But according to the blueprint, over three hundred such formations were required, consuming a staggering amount of resources.

"Normally, you wouldn't be involved in this mission since your cultivation is only at late-stage Qi Refinement. I know you've avoided tasks too far from the sect out of fear of the Holy Ice Sect, but I assure you, they won't harm you. 

"Additionally, I know you wish to exchange for a Foundation Establishment Pill. Here's some accurate information: three pills remain from this batch, while the rest have already been claimed. 

"If you complete one hundred of these formations, I can secure one for you. I've calculated your merits—combined with those from this task, it will be enough." Elder Song spoke with an air of absolute confidence. 

In truth, Li Shiming already had four Foundation Establishment Pills. Were it not for Elder Yin's warning, he would have refused outright. 

Elder Song's assurance that the Holy Ice Sect wouldn't act against him was laughable. He knew exactly why they sought revenge—Bai Li, an elder of the Holy Ice Sect, had lost his son and suffered severe injuries, even losing a magic treasure, all because of Li Shiming. 

Though Bai Li didn’t know Li Shiming had killed his son or caused his injuries, given Bai Li's temperament, retaliation was inevitable. 

Still, Foundation Establishment Pills were crucial for him. He couldn't afford to wait for the next batch. At his current cultivation speed, he would reach peak Qi Refinement by next year and could attempt his breakthrough. 

"I accept the mission," Li Shiming said decisively, bowing. 

"Go collect the materials. Each completed formation must be connected to the network," Elder Song dismissed him with a wave. 

Li Shiming left the Lingji Pavilion and retrieved materials for ten formations from the treasury. 

Likely due to a manpower shortage, the materials hadn't even undergone preliminary processing. 

He sent a message to Yin Shilan explaining the situation before flying out of the sect. 

Yin Shilan was currently occupied—having just reached Foundation Establishment, she was busy mastering her primary cultivation technique and Foundation-level spells under Elder Yin's strict orders. Until she gained sufficient self-defense capabilities, she couldn't engage in other activities. 

Even Ren Fei'er was confined. According to her, her mother was pressuring her to reach Foundation Establishment as quickly as possible, sparing no expense on resources. 

This puzzled Li Shiming. He had met Ren Fei'er's mother—a Golden Core cultivator—who should know better than to rush Foundation Establishment, as it offered little benefit and wasted resources. 

Combined with the sect's sudden investment in arrays, everything felt unusual. 

Neither Yin Shilan nor Ren Fei'er knew the specifics, but Li Shiming sensed urgency in the air. He accelerated his array construction. 

With his senior array mastery and spiritual sense, he could complete an underwater formation in just five hours. Material processing was delegated to his clone. 

Every day, aside from returning to his cave for cultivation, he worked tirelessly on the formations. 

For safety, he dispersed several soul fragments from his "Soul-Splitting Control Art" to monitor the surroundings. 

It was only because of these fragments that he dared accept the mission. 

Since absorbing the soul of the deceased Golden Core cultivator Yun Xingyi, his primary soul fragment had undergone a transformation, becoming almost corporeal. It could now split into ten fragments without strain—far exceeding the technique's original description.

A translucent flying vessel soared through the sky, carrying six late-stage Qi Refining cultivators. One among them exuded a notably stronger aura. 

"Senior Brother Du, if this mission succeeds and Elder Bai Li takes notice, don't forget about us!" one cultivator fawned. 

Every sect had its genius disciples, who typically operated separately from ordinary members. These elites received tailored resources and missions, even personalized cultivation techniques. 

Only a select few ordinary disciples got the chance to accompany them on missions, receiving better rewards and the rare opportunity to forge connections. 

Genius disciples were almost guaranteed to reach mid-to-late Foundation Establishment, with some even advancing to Golden Core—though that would take years, far too late for most ordinary disciples to benefit. 

These six were led by Du, a Holy Ice Sect genius with Heavenly Spiritual Roots. Many late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators would gladly take him as a disciple, but Du aimed higher—for a Golden Core master's tutelage. 

Normally, Golden Core masters had long since filled their disciple quotas. But fate intervened: Bai Li's son disappeared, and one of his Foundation Establishment disciples died unexpectedly, opening a spot. 

Golden Core masters rarely took many disciples—usually around three, selecting only the most talented. 

If Du broke through to Foundation Establishment and distinguished himself, he might attract a Golden Core master's attention without even trying. 

But he was impatient. Sect competition was fierce, with two other geniuses vying for the same opportunities. 

He had been waiting for a chance to impress Bai Li, hoping to become his disciple. 

Then, unexpectedly, the opportunity arrived—Bai Li issued a covert mission to kill an unnamed Qi Refining disciple from the Heavenly Sea Sect. 

Elder Song wasn't entirely wrong. Given the current circumstances, the Holy Ice Sect couldn't openly target Li Shiming. 

But Bai Li had his own agenda. 

There were always loopholes in rules. The seven sects allowed inter-sect conflicts among disciples—but with unspoken boundaries: Qi Refining against Qi Refining, Foundation against Foundation, with no cross-realm attacks permitted. 

With the current crisis requiring unity, even Bai Li wouldn't escalate tensions openly. 

But if Li Shiming died in a Qi Refining-level conflict, the Holy Ice Sect could claim it wasn't their fault. 

Countless Qi Refining disciples died every year—one more wouldn't matter, as long as no higher-realm cultivators were involved. 

Bai Li had developed an obsession with killing Li Shiming. 

Li Shiming's mission wasn't a secret, and those watching closely took notice—hence this covert operation.

Li Shiming manipulated the finished array flags, placing them on the reef. The task seemed simple, but he had already calculated the terrain and spiritual energy flow with precision. 

Each of the 108 flags had to be placed at exact nodes—the slightest misalignment would render the formation useless. 

Since these formations were meant for long-term use, he also had to carve spiritual channels between flags and account for tidal submergence, ensuring waterproofing. 

By now, he had done this countless times—no longer needing IBMz15's assistance. 

The "Starlight Sea of Arrays" in his mind provided instant reference data, a unique advantage of array masters. 

The profession relied heavily on experience. With the Starlight Sea, any formation within his knowledge could be reconstructed effortlessly. 

Sometimes, Li Shiming wondered if the Starlight Sea was a form of biological computation. 

"Holy Ice Sect cultivators!" He halted his work as a soul fragment alerted him. 

Through his primary soul, he accessed the fragment's vision—a familiar translucent flying vessel, the Holy Ice Sect's standard issue. 

Its trajectory made it clear: they were targeting him. 

As he watched, the vessel stopped, and five cultivators fanned out to encircle him. 

Their confidence suggested they didn't plan to let him escape. 

Sensing their auras, Li Shiming relaxed—they were all Qi Refining cultivators. 

At late-stage Qi Refinement (eighth layer), he was already among the strongest in his realm. 

His enhanced physique alone could overpower ninth-layer cultivators, and his defenses made him impervious to group attacks. 

Of course, this was his own assessment. The Holy Ice Sect underestimated him, sending a force he could handle with ease. 

In truth, Bai Li knew of Li Shiming's performance at the Seven Stars Islands, which was why he assigned the mission to Du, a Heavenly Spiritual Root genius. 

Though Du hadn't yet taken a master, the sect provided him with top-tier resources and techniques. 

Among Qi Refining cultivators, Du was elite—more than capable of handling Li Shiming, especially with backup. 

Li Shiming didn't hide or flee. Instead, he soared into the air, wings unfurled, and awaited his enemies.
