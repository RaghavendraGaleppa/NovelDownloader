# Chapter 107: Inventory

Inside the massive 30-meter-long, wide, and high space, various items were neatly categorized and arranged.  

A golden flying boat was placed separately in one area, next to a small mountain of spirit stones.  

Within the storage bracelet, even the largest quantities could be easily counted with a mere perception. Li Shiming sensed that there were exactly 51,200 spirit stones here.  

After tallying the number, he couldn't help but take a sharp breath.  

He had thought Baili Jinyan was wealthy, but he never imagined him to be this rich.  

While other items might be unusable, these 51,200 spirit stones could be discreetly spent without drawing too much attention.  

Beside the spirit stones were two spirit stone pouches, each containing 100 mid-grade spirit stones—totaling 200 mid-grade spirit stones.  

Li Shiming couldn't quite gauge the value of mid-grade spirit stones, but he assumed they wouldn’t be cheap. More importantly, mid-grade spirit stones were exceedingly rare and often served as the driving energy for many powerful formations.  

It was likely that Baili Jinyan had carried them for formation purposes.  

Next to them was a short sword artifact. Even without spiritual energy fueling it, faint golden light shimmered along its blade.  

"A top-tier upper-grade metal-attribute sword artifact!" Li Shiming quickly assessed its quality and attribute with just a brief examination.  

This was precisely the kind of upper-grade metal-attribute sword artifact he had been searching for—one that could maximize the potential of his own metal spiritual energy and amplify the power of his "Sword Control Art."  

But the problem remained: if he wanted to invite endless trouble, he could take this sword out and use it.  

"This is truly frustrating," he muttered to himself.  

He was tempted to stop examining the rest. After all, if he found more treasures, they would likely be just as unusable—like the flying boat and the sword artifact, tantalizing yet out of reach.  

Yet, curiosity got the better of him. His attention turned to another artifact—a small orb.  

Upon sensing it, he realized it was an upper-grade defensive artifact. Unlike typical shield-type defensive artifacts, this orb could provide 360-degree protection against attacks from any direction.  

Contrary to Li Shiming’s expectations, the storage bracelet didn’t contain many artifacts.  

There was the upper-grade metal-attribute sword artifact, the orb-type defensive artifact, the flying boat, and the Binding Spirit Rope and Soul-Piercing Needle that had been used against him—nothing else.  

But on second thought, these artifacts already covered all essential needs.  

There was an offensive sword artifact, a defensive artifact, a flying artifact, and two specialized artifacts. Aside from the Binding Spirit Rope, all were upper-grade artifacts.  

Any one of these would significantly enhance the combat power of a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator.  

As for Baili Jinyan, who possessed so many artifacts, he had essentially dug his own grave. Otherwise, Li Shiming would never have succeeded so easily.  

Li Shiming continued his inspection. Next to the artifacts was a solitary jade box.  

Using his spiritual energy within the storage bracelet, he opened the jade box to find a single talisman inside.  

Yet this single talisman exerted an overwhelming pressure on him. The pattern on it depicted a white jade cup.  

Just the image of this cup alone gave him the same oppressive sensation he had felt when the sect’s grand formation had trembled violently at Lingji Pavilion.  

The material used to craft this talisman was undoubtedly of unimaginable quality.  

Li Shiming had never heard of a talisman with such terrifying power. He was no stranger to talismans—he could even draw the ones he had mastered himself.  

But he was certain that once activated, this talisman would unleash an unparalleled force. He suspected it was connected to an elder-level cultivator.  

Once again, he felt a wave of relief. He hadn’t given Baili Jinyan any chance to retaliate, nor had Baili Jinyan needed to use offensive spiritual items. Otherwise, any one of these treasures could have killed him countless times over before he even got close.  

Carefully, he returned the white jade cup talisman to the jade box and resealed it.  

Next to it were three purple jade slips. He wasn’t entirely clear on the grading of jade slips, but he knew purple ones were of exceptionally high quality.  

The formation inheritance Yin Shilan had given him was also recorded on a purple jade slip.  

Li Shiming was somewhat interested in these three jade slips, though not overwhelmingly so.  

Based on his understanding, every sect strictly controlled access to cultivation techniques.  

Take the "Profound Nether Corpse Refinement Chapter" he had obtained—he had only deciphered it thanks to his IBMz15.  

An ordinary cultivator who acquired a jade slip containing the "Profound Nether Corpse Refinement Chapter" wouldn’t even know its name, let alone decrypt and study it.  

His doppelganger retrieved one of the purple jade slips and pressed it against its forehead.  

A flood of information poured from the jade slip into the doppelganger’s mind, which Li Shiming then received.  

Through his connection with the IBMz15, he synchronized all the information, creating a new document for the technique.  

To his surprise, the technique recorded in this jade slip—called the "Ice Heart Jade Thought Art"—was completely unencrypted, laid bare within the storage bracelet.  

In hindsight, this wasn’t entirely unexpected. The owner of the storage bracelet, Baili Jinyan, had a background intimidating enough to deter even Foundation Establishment cultivators. Moreover, his survival methods ensured he could escape from such opponents if needed.  

Baili Jinyan had never imagined he would be killed by a cultivator on this continent. His confidence stemmed from his vast array of treasures and the formidable power of his father.  

With this mindset, Baili Jinyan had carried unencrypted jade slips.  

Li Shiming skimmed through the "Ice Heart Jade Thought Art." It was a technique for cultivating spiritual sense.  

Spiritual sense wasn’t something Qi Refinement cultivators were supposed to possess. Normally, cultivators only developed spiritual sense after successfully reaching Foundation Establishment, where their souls underwent a transformative elevation.  

The strength of Foundation Establishment cultivators lay precisely in their spiritual sense, which played a crucial role in detection, offense, and defense against spiritual attacks.  

At the Qi Refinement stage, the earliest manifestation of spiritual sense was the "Object Control Art." By practicing this art, Qi Refinement cultivators could generate a spiritual energy hand.  

This hand possessed some of the cultivator’s sensory abilities, allowing them to perceive heat, cold, force, and other attributes.  

But spiritual sense was infinitely more powerful. Once mastered, it could perceive everything within its range without missing a single detail.  

For longer distances, spiritual sense could be concentrated into a beam, extending beyond its usual coverage.  

The "Ice Heart Jade Thought Art" was a technique that Qi Refinement cultivators shouldn’t have access to—yet it was tailor-made for geniuses with top-tier talent.  

Heavenly Spirit Root cultivators focused on continuously refining their spiritual energy, compressing it to build a stronger foundation.  

Foundation Establishment was about laying the groundwork for immortality—the better the foundation, the further one could progress.  

Most Heavenly Spirit Root cultivators didn’t fixate on Foundation Establishment but looked beyond.  

Their cultivation speed was so fast that they often struggled to meet the need for self-refinement.  

Thus, they practiced body-refining techniques to strengthen their physique, allowing them to contain more spiritual energy.  

They also sought various methods to temper their minds and prepare for the future.  

Baili Jinyan, for instance, had certain personality flaws. His father was aware of them, but these traits also drove him to strive relentlessly, refusing to fall behind. This personality had its pros and cons.  

To compensate for the mental instability caused by his temperament, his father had gone to great lengths to obtain the "Ice Heart Jade Thought Art," a spiritual sense technique cultivable at the Qi Refinement stage.  

By mastering it, Baili Jinyan would possess stronger spiritual sense than other Foundation Establishment cultivators—a lead that would only widen over time.  

Li Shiming set aside the purple jade slip. From now on, he could study the "Ice Heart Jade Thought Art" through his IBMz15.  

He picked up the second purple jade slip and pressed it to his doppelganger’s forehead. Another flood of information poured in, which he then transferred to the IBMz15.  

"Sword Demon Codex," he murmured, reading the name of the technique.  

While the "Ice Heart Jade Thought Art" was a Qi Refinement spiritual sense technique without follow-up stages, the "Sword Demon Codex" was a complete manual—covering everything from Qi Refinement to the Golden Core stage.  

Through it, Li Shiming learned that elder-level power corresponded to the Golden Core stage—where a single golden pellet could transcend mortality.  

The "Sword Demon Codex" also revealed what body-refining technique Baili Jinyan had practiced: this very manual.  

The "Sword Demon Codex" was an outlier among sword cultivators, diverging from the path of the "Sword Control Art."  

The "Sword Control Art" relied on spiritual energy to manipulate flying swords—the legendary path of sword immortals and the route most sword cultivators followed.  

It emphasized powerful spiritual energy to maximize a sword’s might, though technique was equally important—a balance of skill and energy for devastating offense.  

In contrast, the "Sword Demon Codex" focused on refining the body through the sword, then wielding the sword through the body.  

Its purpose was to transform the body into a vessel of immense strength and flexibility, enhancing the power of a wielded blade.  

Unlike the "Sword Control Art," the "Sword Demon Codex" required the sword to remain in hand—nurturing the body with the sword, and the sword with the body, creating a symbiotic cycle.  

Sword cultivators who practiced this technique fought in a manner reminiscent of mortal martial artists—yet the difference was like heaven and earth.  

They excelled in close combat, unleashing endless sword strikes. Since their attacks were body-driven, each strike surpassed the power of flying swords.  

This comparison assumed equal cultivation and strength.  

Holding a sword allowed them to freely channel spiritual energy while fully utilizing their physical strength.  

In contrast, flying swords depended on the amount of spiritual energy imbued into them—requiring constant replenishment for greater power.  

Of course, neither approach was strictly superior. Close-combat sword cultivators and flying swords each had their own advantages and drawbacks.  

But given that most modern sword cultivators chose flying swords, the latter was clearly more popular.  

Li Shiming didn’t mind either way. His "Vajra Body Protection Divine Art" had already taken root, so even if he didn’t practice the "Sword Demon Codex," he could still learn from its techniques.  

However, after reviewing the manual several times via IBMz15, his expression turned peculiar.  

He manipulated his doppelganger to extend its palm, following the "Sword Demon Codex" method.  

Tiny particles throughout its body surged toward its palm, gradually coalescing into a sword—a blade radiating intense metal-attribute energy.  

This sword’s quality surpassed even upper-grade artifacts. More importantly, when the doppelganger held it, the weapon felt like an extension of its body.  

This was the result of Baili Jinyan’s "Sword Demon Codex" practice. Since his body hadn’t fully perished, the technique had been perfectly inherited.  

The sword was Baili Jinyan’s "Sword Foundation"—a blade forged from third-grade materials.  

Third-grade materials were typically reserved for Golden Core elders. Baili Jinyan’s father had specifically procured third-grade metal-attribute materials to ensure his son’s foundation was solid.  

The "Sword Demon Codex" allowed the Sword Foundation to become the strongest blade for its wielder’s current stage—all the way to the Golden Core stage.  

The Sword Foundation was a weapon that grew alongside its cultivator, provided its materials were of sufficient quality. Otherwise, the materials would limit its potential, preventing it from becoming a Golden Core artifact nurtured from Qi Refinement.  

Imagine a sword that had been fused with a cultivator’s body since Qi Refinement, refined through the "Sword Demon Codex"—its compatibility would be terrifying.  

For a sword cultivator, a highly compatible weapon amplified combat power far more than for ordinary cultivators.  

Li Shiming couldn’t help but marvel at Baili Jinyan’s protagonist-like fate. Had it not been for him, Baili Jinyan would have undoubtedly become a sect elder.  

"What was I thinking about during Qi Refinement?" Li Shiming asked himself.  

He was only at the fourth layer of Qi Refinement, and before this, he hadn’t thought much about the future—not even Foundation Establishment, let alone the distant Golden Core stage.  

He had thought the concept of "falling behind at the starting line" was unique to his past life. Now, he saw it applied to the cultivation world as well.  

But now, all of this belonged to his doppelganger. The sword was excellent, but it had already been fully refined and fused with the doppelganger. This was why the body had remained intact despite enduring two point-blank explosions, multiple shockwaves, and extreme heat.  

As for whether the "Sword Demon Codex" or the "Vajra Body Protection Divine Art" was superior, Li Shiming couldn’t say. But if he could achieve Baili Jinyan’s level of physical prowess when he reached that stage, he would be more than satisfied.
