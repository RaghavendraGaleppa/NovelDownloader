# Chapter 89: Ambushing the Third Leader, Biluo Displays Its Power

Li Xian returned to the wooden hut, retrieving his wooden bow and fitting his long blade. He coated several arrows with the "Throat-Sealing at Sight" poison.

His [Breeze Leg] technique had reached perfection. With his full speed, his movement was truly impressive. Moreover, traversing the snowy mountain forest gave him a unique advantage.

Li Xian set off immediately, heading east. The entrance to Black River Village lay to the east. When he reached the village outskirts, he saw many footprints on the ground.

Tracing the footprints, he could determine their route.

"Seven sets of horse tracks. There are only seven bandits."

"Though their numbers aren't great, if their martial arts cultivation is decent, they will be quite troublesome to deal with."

The mountain path was winding and treacherous.

Li Xian, confident in his skill, chose not to take the conventional path in order to save time. He reached a steep section where a large tree stood at the bottom of the slope.

He leaped with all his strength, jumping down from the hillside. Mid-air, he utilized [Breeze Leg], drastically slowing his descent. Seizing the moment, he grabbed a thick branch.

Then he slid down the tree.

This single leap saved him several miles of travel.

His Qi circulated through his meridians, and his ability to lock his blood and breath allowed his stamina to remain endless. He rushed over ten miles of mountain road without a single gasp for breath.

The foundation accumulated through his daily martial arts training revealed its true power at this moment.

"There they are!"

Climbing a high ridge and scanning the terrain, he finally spotted the figures of the Black River Village villagers in the distance.

There were about a hundred of them.

The elderly, the weak, women, and children—all were there.

Their hands were bound with hemp ropes, connected in a long line. One bandit pulled the rope from the front, two patrolled the sides, and three guarded the rear.

"Judging by this formation, the Mountain Wind Stronghold intends to leave no one alive. How ruthless."

"Is the man in the fox fur that Aunt Zhang mentioned?"

Because of the distance, the figures were like black dots, hard to distinguish clearly. However, the bandit at the very front rode a brown steed, dressed in fox fur and adorned with jewelry, looking exceptionally wealthy and distinct.

Seeing that the villagers were safe for the moment, Li Xian breathed a sigh of relief. He then pondered:

"These men have decent martial arts, and they are all on horseback. If I engage them head-on, I likely won't gain the upper hand."

"The enemy is exposed while I remain hidden. I must use this advantage. I will bypass them and set up an ambush further down the road. That will increase my chances of victory!"

Li Xian immediately formulated a plan. From his high vantage point, he surveyed the surrounding terrain and plotted his route. After eating a few slices of dried meat to recover his stamina, he began to circle around at full speed.

"Without Breeze Leg, I never could have caught up to them."

"The secrets of lightness techniques are truly useful."

Li Xian's body was like a breeze, becoming even more agile. The difficulty of mountain paths usually lay in the muddy ground and the abundance of obstacles, leaving nowhere to step. Even if one found a footing, it was hard to exert force.

Yet, these重重 obstacles were easily overcome by Li Xian, thanks to the synergy between his [Running] skill and the [Breeze Leg] martial art.

Though he did not know a true lightness technique, he moved as if he did.

At this moment...

A sudden gust of wind blew.

Li Xian rejoiced. "Excellent, the wind aids me." Riding the wind, his [Riding the Wind] trait reached its limit. His body felt as light as a swallow; a single step carried him several yards.

At this moment, he was several times faster than a horse.

Many difficult terrains were crossed with ease.

An infinite sense of exhilaration rose within him. The purpose of his daily diligence in studying the martial path was precisely for this kind of scene.

He had now绕行 (circled around) to the front of the bandits. He observed the environment along the road, looking for a suitable place for an ambush.

Up ahead, the road narrowed. On one side was a dangerous slope, on the other a high mountain, with dense weeds covering both sides. It was perfect for an ambush.

"I will set the trap here!"

Li Xian began to prepare the terrain. Finally, he hid behind a tree, quietly waiting for them to arrive.

About half a quarter of an hour later.

The group had not yet arrived, but their voices could be heard.

Peng Huli (Fox Peng) walked at the very front of the group, chatting with another young bandit.

The young bandit said, "Third Leader, you think these stubborn villagers really have the guts of a bear and the heart of a leopard? daring to ambush our Mountain Wind Stronghold men."

Peng Huli said leisurely, "Normally, these lowly stubborn villagers wouldn't have the courage. I'm afraid there must be a skilled expert helping them behind the scenes. I wonder if it's the Black Water Gang or someone else."

The young bandit asked, "Then what should we do?"

"What to do?" Peng Huli smiled. "Naturally, we use heavy torture to find out where Fang Yaozi is."

"Is Fang Yaozi still alive?" the young bandit asked.

"He'd be lucky to be alive," Peng Huli said. "We ask for the burial site, dig up the corpse, and see who killed him and how. Won't that be clear immediately?"

"Third Leader is absolutely right," the young bandit praised endlessly.

The Mountain Wind Stronghold owed its current scale largely to the Third Leader. The stronghold had five leaders who had sworn brotherhood, sharing deep bonds of loyalty. The Third Leader had the weakest martial arts but the best strategy. Whenever the stronghold faced major events, they always sought his opinion.

"Third Leader..." the young bandit said with a grin, "I heard the Chieftain isn't around recently. Are you planning to 'open the furnace and cook' again?"

"What? Your mouth is itching?" Peng Huli said. "Didn't I give you a sip of soup last time?"

"Last time was last time. I'm craving that taste," the young bandit said. "If I could have another sip, I'd climb a mountain of blades or plunge into a sea of fire for you."

Peng Huli said, "You are the greediest. Fine, I'll give you a hint. This batch of 'refined food' isn't simple. It's being cooked at 'Mountain Wind Pass,' which is near the river vein. The Chieftain is personally guarding it, and the Second and Fifth Leaders went with him."

"The three of them are too busy to mind the stronghold's affairs. All matters, big and small, are temporarily under my and the Fourth Leader's control. Although in terms of martial arts, I am inferior to the Fourth and Fifth... but who gets to drink a sip of the refined soup and taste the essence? I still have a say."

The young bandit said, "Third Leader, please take care of me. This is a gift for you." As he spoke, he offered a cloth bag filled with valuables.

Silver, jade, soft gold, precious hairpins... it was truly worth a lot of money.

Peng Huli raised his eyebrows slightly and was about to reach out and take it when, suddenly, the horse beneath him smelled something and became startled, shaking its body wildly.

It wasn't just him; all the horses were the same. "What's going on?" Peng Huli squeezed his legs, suppressing his startled mount.

Li Xian saw that the prey had entered the trap and held back no longer. He loosed an arrow, and with a *boom*, the road ahead exploded. Stones scattered everywhere.

Li Xian turned his aim and shot three more times, each spot triggering an explosion.

"Brothers, attack! Capture these Mountain Wind Stronghold brats and go back to claim the reward from the Gang Leader!"

Li Xian pulled a hidden cord, and the surrounding grass swayed repeatedly, as if a large number of ambushers were hidden there.

"Acting like ghosts and demons."

Peng Huli sneered, stepped on the horse's back, and leaped up, intending to grab Li Xian. Unexpectedly, Li Xian pulled another cord, triggering yet another trap.

A large团 of snow fell from above, creating a blinding mist.

"Not good!" Seeking safety, Peng Huli retracted his force and fell back onto his horse.

Although he saw through the trick and knew it was Li Xian causing trouble, the other bandits couldn't see the situation clearly. With the sudden snow mist, they immediately lost their footing.

Li Xian shot down two men.

He slid down from the high slope, mixed into the crowd, and moved among them, quickly dispatching the miscellaneous bandits.

Screams rose one after another, and the group was dispersed in an instant. In reality, although Li Xian's martial arts were excellent, if he faced five or six opponents at once in a direct fight, he would still find it tricky.

But Li Xian utilized his strengths.

With his own strength, he beat the bandits until they couldn't even put up a defense.

"Good胆 (audacity)!"

Peng Huli was furious. He couldn't find Li Xian's figure to his left or right. He channeled Qi into his palm and slapped the air.

A wave of air swept out, dispersing the snow mist and revealing Li Xian's figure, along with several bandit corpses.

Peng Huli roared, "Little thief, take my palm!" He jumped off the horse and executed the palm technique [Extreme Iron Palm]. His internal Qi condensed and was mighty, forming a layer of Qi membrane on his palm. He struck down from his high position!

Li Xian raised his palm to meet the enemy, countering with a "Biluo Palm."

The two palms met.

Li Xian felt the opponent's palm force, like a sheet of steel, unbreakable and fierce in power. He was forced back several steps.

He snorted coldly and circulated Qi to counterattack.

"Blue Waves Towering Sky!"

Fifteen streams of palm force surged from the Biluo Palm.

Like fifteen waves, one crashed down while the next followed closely behind.

Although initially, his palm force was not as fierce as Peng Huli's [Extreme Iron Palm], the follow-up force was endless, wave after wave, growing increasingly turbulent.

Gradually, Li Xian turned the tide. In contrast, Peng Huli's expression changed drastically. He felt he was no match, his eyes filled with shock.
