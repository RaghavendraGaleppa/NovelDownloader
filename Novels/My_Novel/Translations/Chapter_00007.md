# Chapter 7: Head Down Like an Ox, Head Up Like a Tiger

The matter of "Boiling the Essence Pill" had come to an end, and the miscellaneous servants returned to their usual routine.

Li Xian still spent his time weeding, using the intervals between work to practice his boxing techniques.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency: 756/1000 Mastery\]

However, at his current speed, three days might not be enough. Li Xian gritted his teeth and steeled his resolve.

He practiced his fist with even greater urgency!

Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

\[Proficiency: 872/1000 Mastery\]

Only one day remained.

At noon that day.

In the miscellaneous servants' quarters, Li Xian had a simple meal of steamed buns and plain water. His gaze drifted as he observed his surroundings.

Seeing that Luo Fang and Bi Hao were both absent, and the eyes of the other servants were not on him, he thought, "The time is ripe."

Li Xian quietly slipped out. Once he was a few miles away from the group, he quickened his pace and headed toward the guards' compound.

Along the way, the greenery was lush, and the scenery was pleasant. Occasionally, he could see garden landscapes like rockeries and ponds.

It was a world apart from the miscellaneous servants' quarters.

"I must wait until the very last moment to sign up. That Luo Fang is cunning and insidious. If I register too early, he will surely find out and target me."

"Similarly... if I fail this guard competition, the consequences will be absolutely dire. Luo Fang won't let me off! This is a do-or-die situation!"

Li Xian clenched his fist, his palm sweating, yet his steps remained steady and unhurried.

"Sneaking around, what are you doing here?"

A man reached out to block Li Xian, his eyes wide and imposing.

This man was named Qiao Dashou, one of the guards of the Yihe Manor.

Although they were all family servants who had signed their lives away, a "guard" and a "miscellaneous servant" were not on the same level.

Just looking at the food would tell you the difference. Guards, one could say with certainty, had meat in every meal and never lacked for oil in their diet.

"Big Brother, I'm here to sign up," Li Xian said respectfully.

"Sign up?"

Qiao Dashou looked down at Li Xian with an arrogant expression, pointing a finger casually as he lectured, "Your height is about right, but you're too skinny. You've got no chance of being a guard. Go on back now, don't waste your effort."

Li Xian frowned. The way this man looked down his nose at him made him extremely uncomfortable.

"Still not leaving?"

Qiao Dashou sneered. He had given good advice, but this lowly servant didn't know what was good for him. He immediately said, "I've seen plenty of people like you."

"As a miscellaneous servant, you harbor unrealistic fantasies all day long. Who do you think I, Qiao Dashou, am? If I say you're not cut out for it, how could that be false?"

Li Xian said in a deep voice, "I may be a miscellaneous servant, but regarding the matter of signing up, I believe I have the right to decide. What you think of me is irrelevant."

He sidestepped Qiao Dashou and walked straight into the compound.

"You!"

Qiao Dashou was furious. "This is outrageous! A mere miscellaneous servant dares to speak to me this way."

He was just about to teach him a lesson when he suddenly remembered Commander Pang's instructions: miscellaneous servants wishing to sign up were not to be obstructed, and violators would be expelled.

Pang Long sat upright in the main hall. Seeing a young miscellaneous servant approach, he asked, "Here to sign up?"

Li Xian nodded. "I am Li Xian, number twenty-seven of the ninth miscellaneous servants' class. I wish to sign up for the guard competition."

"Alright."

Pang Long's gaze swept over him.

The young man's clothes were tattered, and his face was dirty. At first glance, he seemed no different from the other miscellaneous servants.

However, upon closer inspection, this boy's eyes held a sharp glint, exceptionally bright.

"A bit interesting. For a martial artist, a bit of spirit is especially important. Most of the miscellaneous servants who have signed up recently are sneaky types. This boy... is a bit different," Pang Long thought to himself.

He didn't know that Luo Fang was paying lip service to the rules, intentionally concealing the news of the guard competition. He only leaked the information to those who were physically weak and frail. Even if these people signed up, they posed no competition. This also served to cover his tracks, preventing Pang Long from becoming suspicious.

"Write your name and servant number here. Come back here tomorrow morning."

"Alright!"

Li Xian signed his information and turned to leave.

Pang Long picked up the paper and raised an eyebrow slightly. "The pen strokes are vigorous and clear. Did this Li Xian study?"

In fact, Li Xian was not poor at his studies. In terms of talent, he would have had more than enough ability to take the imperial examinations of the Great Wu Empire.

However... education was expensive. His younger brother, Li Xiaofan, had a photographic memory and was exceptionally gifted. It was more suitable for him to walk the path of scholarship.

Before his father passed away, the family of three made a living by hunting. The two brothers, one literary and one martial, were not wealthy, but their days held great promise.

That night.

Li Xian's eyes were filled with determination. After the roll call in the miscellaneous servants' quarters, he hid in the abandoned house he usually cleaned.

When the night deepened...

Under the moonlight and the gentle breeze, he threw punch after punch, practicing diligently.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency +1\]

"The world is cruel. I, Li Xian, have a lowly life."

"But I am unwilling to sink into oblivion. Whether it ends well or badly depends on tomorrow's fate."

"I..."

"Just have to throw my punches with all my might!"

A flash of inspiration struck him. He threw a punch, unaware of fatigue or drowsiness. Sweat soaked his clothes, making him look as if he were standing in the rain.

Time flowed on...

\[Raging Ox Fist · Incomplete Form\]

\[Proficiency: 915/1000 Mastery\]

\[Proficiency: 946/1000 Mastery\]

By now, the sky was beginning to brighten.

Li Xian was facing both physical and mental exhaustion, overcome by drowsiness. He was sustained only by a single belief.

His eyes were wide open, bloodshot.

Every punch he threw remained steady and unhurried. It was like an old ox chewing its cud; though it was starving, it maintained a rhythm.

The boy was mature beyond his years, possessing a steady and composed aura.

\[Proficiency: 976/1000 Mastery\]

By now, the sky was bright, and the gong from the miscellaneous servants' quarters sounded.

If Li Xian's guess was correct, the class leader was already taking attendance.

Luo Fang had likely already found out that he had been out all night. According to the rules of the Yihe Manor, Luo Fang could even use this as an excuse to cause trouble and have him killed!

"If I don't climb higher, how can I call myself a man!"

"Rules are for bullying the honest."

Ignoring the gong, he simply continued to挥舞 his fists, over and over again...

\[Proficiency: 989/1000 Mastery\]

"Not enough!"

Li Xian had surpassed his limit of fatigue.

"Number twenty-seven of the ninth class!"

"You have some nerve, staying out all night!"

"Manager Luo said that if you show yourself immediately, he might spare your life!"

"Where are you hiding? Come out quickly!"

"I know you're nearby!"

Servants from the ninth class were searching everywhere.

Luo Fang managed the miscellaneous servants using a system of collective punishment. With Li Xian missing, the most anxious were the other servants of the ninth class.

These people soon found their way near the abandoned house.

At that very moment, Li Xian's whole body trembled.

\[Proficiency has reached its limit\]

\[Raging Ox Fist · Incomplete Form\]

\[Proficiency: 0/1500 Minor Success\]

\[Description: The Raging Ox is a cunning creature... It possesses the ox's simplicity, yet loses none of the tiger's or leopard's ferocity. Head down like an ox, head up like a tiger. After throwing tens of thousands of punches, your strength has increased slightly.\]

A warm current coalesced in his Dantian, refusing to disperse.

Heaven does not betray the diligent man. Staying up all night to practice his fist had finally paid off, catching up his progress!

Li Xian vaulted over the back wall of the courtyard, avoiding the search party of the miscellaneous servants.

"As long as I successfully join the guards, I can avoid this calamity."

"Although I have violated the rules for miscellaneous servants... Luo Fang is the type who bullies the weak but fears the strong. He absolutely would not dare to demand my return from Pang Long!"

Li Xian was not a reckless man who acted on impulse without thinking.

He had his own plans and considerations. He knew how to endure and lie low for the sake of his goals, and how to bear humiliation.

At the guards' compound.

The guard competition was about to begin. Pang Long sat at the front, with three guards standing on each of his left and right sides.

Bi Hao stood among the miscellaneous servants.

He was also wearing the common cloth clothes of a servant, but his tall and straight physique made him stand out from the crowd.

Pang Long's gaze swept over the group, lingering on him for a few moments. He thought to himself, "Among this group, only this Bi Hao has a bit of an imposing manner."

"The time is almost here. Is there anyone who has not..." Pang Long asked the guard beside him. Before he could finish, the sound of footsteps approached.

Li Xian rushed into the compound, caught his breath for a few moments, and said, "Commander Pang, I have arrived."

"Mm, you haven't exceeded the time limit. You may join the line," Pang Long said indifferently.

"Li Xian?! How did you get here? Who told you to come?" Bi Hao recognized Li Xian, his eyes wide with shock.

Li Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. "Brother Bi, I came of my own accord. You and I are now rivals. I ask for your guidance when the time comes."

"Good kid! You've been hiding deep enough. You knew about this too!"

Bi Hao was furious. He tilted his head and whispered into Li Xian's ear, "Are you fit to be my brother? Fine. It's truly interesting that you're here. You've got some nerve to compete with me. Just wait and see how I'll crush you!"

Li Xian couldn't be bothered to argue. He clenched his fist.

A true man settles matters with his fists!
