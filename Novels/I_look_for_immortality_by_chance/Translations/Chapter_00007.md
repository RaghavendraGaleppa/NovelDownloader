# Chapter 7: Entering the Mountain, Borrowing Influence (Combined)

White clouds drifted leisurely across the vast sky.

The crystal-clear lake stretched for thousands of miles, resembling an ocean with rolling waves and misty vapors that connected heaven and earth. It was an unimaginably enormous body of water—standing on its surface, one's vision would be filled with endless rippling light.

At the center of this boundless lake stood a towering mountain that rose abruptly from the ground. The mountain had a peculiar shape, resembling a sword sheath thrusting into the clouds. Lush vegetation covered its slopes, and spiritual energy swirled like smoke. The mist rising from the lake's surface swirled around the mountain's base like clouds, making the entire scene appear as if it were a celestial paradise.

The mountain was so tall that it was clearly visible from the lake's surface. Scattered around it were countless smaller islands, dotting the water like stars surrounding the moon, guarding the central peak.

"Is this Qingfeng Mountain?"

Gazing at the breathtaking sight before him, Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh in awe. Though his previous life had boasted countless beautiful landscapes, they paled in comparison to the scenery of this cultivation world.

The vast lake merged with the sky, the mountain pierced the clouds, and spiritual energy churned like mist in the clear, bright air—it was truly a magnificent sight. Most striking were the architectural complexes perched on seemingly inaccessible cliffs and precipices—jade towers, green-roofed halls, carved railings, and soaring eaves—all exuding an air of human habitation amid the layers of mist. The gentle chime of bells and the occasional flight of spiritual birds added to the lively atmosphere.

Where humans and mountains became one, immortality was born!

This place truly had an immortal aura about it!

For a moment, Gu Yuan was utterly captivated, his eyes darting around as he marveled at the scene. But after a long while, he finally regained his composure and urged the jade dragon beneath him to fly toward the towering Qingfeng Mountain.

This was already the third day of his journey. Over these three days, he had barely rested, following the map and flying straight ahead, crossing countless mountains and rivers before finally arriving here. Remarkably, he had encountered no dangers along the way.

While the map had played a role, the true key to his safe passage was the token he carried. Though the golden core power within it had been completely drained, its aura remained. Holding the token, Gu Yuan had traversed thousands of miles as safely as if a golden core cultivator were escorting him.

"The might of a golden core cultivator is truly terrifying. No wonder they didn't say a word—just handing me this token was enough to ensure my safe passage to the mountain!"

Gu Yuan rubbed the token in his hand and sighed again as Qingfeng Mountain drew nearer.

...

"Grandpa, look! There's a dragon flying up there!"

As Gu Yuan approached Qingfeng Mountain, he noticed boats of various sizes scattered across the surrounding islands, all sailing toward the mountain along the water's currents. Most of the passengers were young children with their hair tied in small buns, their eyes wide with wonder as they stared at the distant Qingfeng Mountain and Gu Yuan in the sky.

"Look, look! There are people on the clouds too!" one child exclaimed, pointing upward.

In the distant sky, white clouds drifted leisurely, carrying several young men in Daoist robes as they made their way back.

*Plop!*

The area around Qingfeng Mountain seemed empty at first glance, but as the clouds drew near, ripples appeared in the air like shimmering water. The air trembled slightly, and then the figures passed through what seemed like a thin membrane, entering Qingfeng Mountain and disappearing into its depths.

"Put your hand down! Those are the immortal masters of Qingfeng Mountain! If you offend them, you might never get to join the mountain sect!" an elder on the boat hastily scolded, slapping the child's hand down to avoid any disrespect.

"Are those the immortal masters?" the child asked. "But they don't look as cool as the one riding the dragon! Grandpa, I want to ride a dragon too! Is the dragon rider an immortal master?"

"Shut up! Shut up! If you say another word, I'll throw you into the lake!" The elder quickly covered the child's mouth and shouted angrily.

In this world, dragons were a taboo subject—never to be mentioned lightly. If overheard, lightning might indeed strike! The person riding the jiao dragon was undoubtedly a cultivator, but he likely wasn't an immortal master of Qingfeng Mountain. Otherwise, the mountain's protective formation would have automatically opened to welcome him in.

If he wasn't a master of Qingfeng Mountain, he was probably a rogue cultivator seeking to join the sect. And according to Qingfeng Dao Academy's rules, rogue cultivators had to undergo the same assessments as the children. Yet, rogue cultivators' success rates were often lower than those of the children, with most leaving dejected.

But now, this child had outright asked if the dragon rider was "an immortal master of Qingfeng Dao Academy"—wasn't that just rubbing salt in the wound? It was like pointing at someone during a civil service exam interview and asking if they had a permanent position. If they passed, fine; if not, it would be humiliating.

"Quiet! From now on, no one is allowed to speak, or you'll never get candy again!" The elder quickly silenced them, fearing the children might say something even more outrageous.

Faced with the threat of losing their candy, the children swallowed their questions and reluctantly fell silent.

...

Meanwhile, Gu Yuan in the sky also noticed something unusual.

Qingfeng Mountain seemed close at hand, but the more he approached, the farther it appeared, as if it could never be reached. The towering peak didn't seem to exist in this space at all. The token in his possession also seemed ineffective.

"Haha, fellow Daoist, are you also here to join the academy?"

Just as Gu Yuan was puzzled, a voice suddenly rang in his ears.

He turned to see a young man in white riding a green crane, leisurely approaching to fly alongside him. Behind the crane-riding youth were dozens of other Qi-refining cultivators, each standing on various magical artifacts, all heading in the same direction.

"Are you also here to join the academy?" Gu Yuan nodded and then asked in return.

"Indeed. All these fellow Daoists behind me are here for the same purpose. Qingfeng Dao Academy is a prestigious sect descended from the Heavenly Palace—everyone aspires to join. If admitted, even if one doesn't soar to great heights, at least they can cultivate in peace without worries!" The young man wasn't old, but his words carried a trace of world-weariness.

Rogue cultivators were the "three-no's" of this world—no backing, no resources, no legacy. Life was hard for them, much like the "three-no's" men of Gu Yuan's previous life—no house, no car, no stable job—under immense pressure, living day to day in uncertainty.

"Things were manageable before, but now that major events are about to unfold, the world will soon become unstable. Without a sect to rely on, it'll be..." The young man pointed upward meaningfully, as if Gu Yuan should understand.

Gu Yuan was confused but couldn't show it, so he nodded as if in agreement. In truth, he had many questions—terms like "Heavenly Palace," "dragon," and "Dao Academy" seemed like common knowledge in this cultivation world, but his predecessor's sect, Qingmu Sect, had never taught him these things, leaving him bewildered.

"Fellow Daoist, are you skilled in artifact refinement, alchemy, or perhaps have inherited a predecessor's legacy?" After some small talk, the white-robed young man's eyes flickered as he probed further.

Though Qingfeng Dao Academy admitted rogue cultivators every year, the spots were limited. Unless one had unique talent, mastery of cultivation arts, or a predecessor's legacy, it was nearly impossible to be accepted. With limited slots, competition was fierce.

Thus, the young man was eager to learn more about Gu Yuan to gauge his competition.

Gu Yuan could only shake his head helplessly. "I don't specialize in any of those."

"Then... do you have rare treasures or star spirits to offer?" The young man was visibly shocked and pressed further.

"None," Gu Yuan admitted again.

"Brother Bai, can't you tell just by looking? He flew here on a jiao dragon without even knowing about Qingfeng Mountain's protective formation—clearly a first-timer who stumbled upon this place by chance. Why bother talking to him?" Before the white-robed youth could ask more, a strikingly beautiful female cultivator behind him sneered dismissively.

"Exactly, why waste time? Brother Bai is only twenty but already capable of crafting mid-grade magical artifacts. With that talent, he’s sure to pass the assessment and join the academy!"

"Ah, the rest of us will just be his supporting cast!"

"Brother Bai, once you're in, don’t forget about us! Let’s meet often and exchange insights on artifact refinement!"

The other Qi-refining cultivators chimed in, their voices tinged with flattery.

Hearing this, a hint of pride flashed in the white-robed youth's eyes, though he suppressed it quickly. "Haha, you all flatter me too much. Qingfeng Dao Academy's assessments are notoriously difficult—I can't say for sure I'll pass, but I'll do my best!"

He cupped his hands in a modest gesture before turning back to Gu Yuan, his gaze now carrying a trace of superiority. "Since it's your first time, it's natural you wouldn’t know. Don’t worry—just wait here. Soon, an overseer from the Personnel Hall will come to guide us. The assessment has three stages with sixteen tests—you must pass all of them to join. The first stage checks your background, then..."

The white-robed youth grew increasingly enthusiastic, rattling off explanations with visible pride.

But just then, ripples appeared in the air. A middle-aged cultivator in black robes, the cuffs embroidered with nine green threads resembling vines, stepped out on a silver skiff.

"The overseer from the Personnel Hall is here!"

"Why so early this year? There should still be half an hour left?"

Murmurs spread among the rogue cultivators.

The white-robed youth stopped mid-sentence, stunned to see the overseer cutting straight through the crowd toward him. All eyes followed.

His heart raced with a mix of shock and excitement. Though he knew it was unlikely, he still straightened up and prepared to bow respectfully.

"This humble one is Bai—"

But before he could finish, the overseer spoke first: "Are you the one recommended by Elder Hu to join the mountain? Do you have the token?"

"Elder Hu? Token?" The white-robed youth froze.

Then a voice answered from beside him: "The token is here. Please take a look, Senior."

The white-robed youth turned to see Gu Yuan presenting a bronze token engraved with green vines to the overseer.

The overseer accepted it carefully, examined it, then tucked it away and smiled warmly at Gu Yuan. "Since you’re recommended by a Golden Core elder, follow me into the mountain."

"Golden Core elder’s recommendation?!"

All the rogue cultivators gaped in disbelief, especially the white-robed youth, who stared at Gu Yuan as if seeing him for the first time.

Gu Yuan glanced at him, a faint smile in his eyes, then bowed respectfully to the overseer. "This disciple heard that entering the mountain requires three stages and sixteen tests. Does that...?"

The overseer waved dismissively. "That’s for rogue cultivators. You were brought in by a Golden Core elder—no need for assessments. Just come with me to the Personnel Hall to register and pay respects to the ancestors!"

With that, he summoned Gu Yuan onto the silver skiff, and the two shot toward Qingfeng Mountain like a streak of light, leaving the rogue cultivators in stunned silence.

The white-robed youth’s face flushed with humiliation.

Damn it! A privileged insider!

No wonder he had such an impressive artifact!

Recalling his earlier performance, he wished he could vanish into the ground. At the same time, he feared he might have offended Gu Yuan. But remembering Gu Yuan’s deliberately teasing question at the end, he relaxed slightly.

"Letting him show off in front of everyone probably pleased him enough to let it go."

"Ah, ten years of Qi-refining, yet it’s no match for a single token..."

He sighed in resignation.

...

Gu Yuan’s playful jab had just been to ease the tension of his journey—he didn’t dwell on it. Now, following the overseer, he marveled at his surroundings.

Only upon entering Qingfeng Mountain could one truly appreciate its grandeur. Standing within it, humans seemed as insignificant as ants. The towering peak stretched endlessly into the clouds, its summit invisible from below. Pavilions and towers dotted the landscape, spiritual energy swirled like mist, and cranes soared overhead. A majestic waterfall cascaded from the mountaintop, creating a perpetual rainbow that hung dreamily in the air.

"This Qingfeng Mountain was transplanted from the Central Divine Land by our founding ancestor with immense power. It has stood here for nearly ten thousand years," the overseer explained amiably, his tone warm due to Gu Yuan’s Golden Core connection.

"The Personnel Hall, Transmission Hall, Formation Hall... all the major halls are located on this mountain. Beyond it lie seven peaks and thirty-six islands, where the seven branches of disciples and Golden Core elders reside."

"Once you’re formally admitted, you’ll be assigned to one of these peaks or islands, where you’ll have your own cave abode for cultivation."

"By the way, did Elder Hu mention taking you as a disciple or arranging for another elder to do so?" The overseer’s tone shifted slightly.

"Elder Hu only spoke of 'opportunity,'" Gu Yuan replied after a brief pause.

"I see..." The overseer nodded, his enthusiasm cooling noticeably.

"Opportunity" meant "you’re on your own"—the elder wouldn’t intervene further. Still, since Gu Yuan had a Golden Core recommendation, the overseer remained polite, though less warm. He continued pointing out landmarks before casually asking:

"You’re quite fortunate. How did you catch Elder Hu’s eye? He’s known for being exceptionally selective."

Gu Yuan understood now. Golden Core elders held supreme authority—a single token compelled obedience, but they rarely explained their reasoning. At least, this overseer didn’t know the details. Yet, subordinates had to navigate these situations carefully to avoid missteps.

The overseer’s probing was an attempt to gauge Gu Yuan’s actual relationship with the elder, which would determine how he treated him—and that treatment would affect Gu Yuan’s benefits.

Gu Yuan wasn’t sure how much maneuvering was involved in the admission process, but judging by the rogue cultivators’ behavior earlier, there were clearly hidden complexities. Thus, he couldn’t reveal the truth. If he did, others would realize his connection to the elder was tenuous at best—a fleeting encounter with no lasting ties.

But he also couldn’t lie, as that would disrespect the elder.

The solution? Say nothing.

No answer meant no certainty. And without certainty, to avoid offending the elder, they’d have to treat him well as a precaution.

"Senior Brother, you’re too kind. This matter involves Elder Hu’s personal affairs. Without his permission, I dare not speak carelessly. If you wish to know, perhaps you could ask him directly?" Gu Yuan played along, addressing the overseer respectfully as "Senior Brother" while deftly sidestepping the question.

His reasoning was sound—since it concerned the elder’s private dealings, discretion was a form of respect.

"Haha, if it’s Elder Hu’s private matter, then never mind. Come, the Personnel Hall is just ahead. Follow me!" Failing to get an answer, the overseer dropped the subject but resolved to treat Gu Yuan well until things became clearer.

After all, the academy’s resources would be allocated regardless—it made no difference who received them.
