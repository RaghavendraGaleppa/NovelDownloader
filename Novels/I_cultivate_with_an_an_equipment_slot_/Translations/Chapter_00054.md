# Chapter 54: The Palace of Ten Thousand Flowers  

The idea took root in Zhang Yan's mind and refused to fade.  

Unfortunately, his equipment slots could only accommodate his own magical artifacts. Artifacts already bound to others couldn't even be equipped—he couldn't even see their attributes.  

And besides...  

Forget about magical treasures—he didn’t even possess a single spiritual artifact yet.  

This competition wasn’t being held in the Tianmu Mountain Range but rather in the Zhao Kingdom. The Tianmu Mountain Range was merely a part of Zhao, and while the Qingheng Sect was the dominant power setting the rules within the mountains, beyond them, it was just one of the first-rate cultivation sects.  

After all...  

A sect with seven Golden Core cultivators wouldn’t be weak no matter where it was placed.  

The largest cultivation sect in Zhao—the Palace of Ten Thousand Flowers—had a Nascent Soul elder overseeing it.  

"Be extremely careful on this journey. If you encounter any trouble, don’t act recklessly," Zhuge Wan earnestly instructed the disciples. These were the geniuses of her Wood Spirit Peak!  

Losing even one would be a devastating blow. If Wood Spirit Peak suffered such a loss, it might even be downgraded to a mere mountain outpost in the future.  

"We heed your command!"  

The disciples responded in unison. Most of them were merely provisional disciples of Wood Spirit Peak, without formal masters, so they naturally held deep reverence for a Golden Core powerhouse like Zhuge Wan.  

"Enough talk. Let’s go."  

With a wave of her hand, Zhuge Wan summoned a flowing ribbon. In the blink of an eye, Zhang Yan and the others found themselves standing atop it.  

"Hold on."  

As Zhuge Wan channeled her spiritual energy, the ribbon transformed into a streak of azure light, soaring dozens of feet in an instant.  

"Ah—!"  

Some disciples, who had never experienced flight before, cried out in alarm at the sudden speed. But once they adjusted, they eagerly gazed down at the sprawling mountains and rivers below.  

At that moment, they truly felt like immortals.  

---  

Their destination was the Palace of Ten Thousand Flowers, located near the capital of Zhao.  

The Zhao Kingdom was vast—its territory alone was nearly twice the size of Zhang Yan’s previous world. Fortunately, this world had cultivators. Otherwise, governing such a massive domain would have been impossible for mortals.  

Zhuge Wan explained some of this to Zhang Yan.  

From her words, Zhang Yan learned about the Zhao Kingdom’s governance structure.  

The Zhao royal family—including the emperor—was forbidden from cultivating.  

Not that they couldn’t, but they weren’t allowed to.  

The cultivation sects prohibited them from practicing. The reason was simple: while the sects looked down on mortals, they highly valued those with spiritual roots—potential cultivators.  

For example, within the Tianmu Mountain Range, there were mortal settlements under the Qingheng Sect’s protection.  

Though they occasionally faced attacks from demonic beasts, the absence of oppressive taxes made life there preferable.  

Any mortal born with spiritual roots had to be sent to the Qingheng Sect.  

Families within the mountains could only nurture their own descendants with spiritual potential. If they dared recruit outsiders, the Qingheng Sect would exterminate them.  

This was the sects’ way of maintaining control.  

If the royal family could cultivate and establish their own power, the sects would lose their monopoly over potential disciples.  

Now, though the royals couldn’t cultivate, they could employ cultivators—most of whom came from these very sects.  

Thus, they posed no real threat.  

In name, the imperial court belonged to the royals. In reality, it was controlled by the sects.  

---  

During the journey, Zhang Yan learned much about local customs from Zhuge Wan. Soon, they arrived at the competition venue.  

The Palace of Ten Thousand Flowers, as Zhao’s largest cultivation sect, had a unique structure.  

Unlike other sects, it only accepted female disciples—men were strictly forbidden.  

Legend had it this was due to their founder’s decree.  

But according to Zhuge Wan, the real reason was that the sect’s cultivation techniques were uniquely suited to women.  

In the past, the Palace had accepted male disciples.  

However, several rebellions had erupted, one of which nearly toppled the entire sect.  

Since then, no men were admitted.  

"So that’s why..."  

Zhang Yan found the gossip fascinating.  

Truly, human nature revolved around drama and repetition.  

"The Palace of Ten Thousand Flowers not only has a Nascent Soul cultivator but also excels in spiritual plant cultivation. Their secret technique, *Transplanting Flowers and Grafting Woods*, allows them to merge different spiritual plants."  

"Transplanting Flowers and Grafting Woods?"  

The name piqued Zhang Yan’s interest.  

It sounded similar to grafting, but from Zhuge Wan’s description, its effects far surpassed ordinary grafting.  

"How many people know this technique?" Zhang Yan asked curiously.  

"It’s a closely guarded secret. Only disciples with exceptional talent in spiritual plant cultivation are taught it. And each of them is bound by a seal—they can’t reveal the method."  

Zhuge Wan seemed to read his thoughts and doused his hopes. "Don’t even think about it."  

"Understood," Zhang Yan replied, though his mind was already working.  

According to Zhuge Wan, while *Transplanting Flowers and Grafting Woods* was a core secret, quite a few disciples knew it—some of whom weren’t even highly advanced in cultivation.  

This made sense. The technique, while invaluable, wasn’t combat-oriented. It prioritized talent in spiritual plant cultivation over raw cultivation aptitude.  

Though Zhuge Wan warned him against it, Zhang Yan had his cheat—his system.  

He didn’t need someone to teach him.  

If he could obtain an artifact used by someone who knew the technique, and if that artifact carried the corresponding skill... he could learn it himself.  

---  

Upon entering the Palace of Ten Thousand Flowers, they were greeted by a welcoming party of dozens of stunning women.  

The leader, a Golden Core cultivator, was a breathtaking beauty.  

Under their guidance, Zhang Yan’s group was swiftly escorted to the guest quarters—a complex of buildings where they could move freely.  

Other sects were already present, though Zhang Yan noticed a key difference.  

Not every participating sect had a Golden Core cultivator leading them. Some were headed by Foundation Establishment cultivators, and these groups were noticeably more subdued.  

In contrast, those with Golden Core leaders carried themselves with far more confidence.  

Truly, this was the way of the cultivation world.  

---  

As Zhuge Wan arrived, several Golden Core cultivators came to greet her.  

It seemed she was well-connected.  

"Junior Sister Zhuge, it’s been too long!"  

Just as they were settling in, an unwelcome voice interrupted.
