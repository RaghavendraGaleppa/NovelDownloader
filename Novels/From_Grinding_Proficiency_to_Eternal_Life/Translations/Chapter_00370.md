# Chapter 370: What is Foundation Establishment

"Interesting..."

Xu Yunfan's Martial Dao Eye at his brow contracted and expanded slightly, analyzing the lingering resonance of the three sword qi reflections still visible in his pupils.

The moment the book pages turned, three strands of sword qi surged forth like dragons leaving a ravine.

Though each was only three inches long, they were condensed as solid as substance. An ordinary ninth-rank supreme master would have their protective true qi instantly pierced if they rashly touched them.

Yu Congling fell silent for a moment, her gaze sharpening.

Those three strands of sword qi were the "Chenghuang Sword Seals" hidden within the *Myriad Chariots Transformation Sword Art*. Even at her peak, she would have needed to maneuver with her sword intent to dissolve them.

Yet Xu Yunfan casually brushed his hand, and the Ten Extremes True Patterns, like a heavenly net, ground them down. The sword qi dissolved inch by inch before even reaching his body, without even a trace of residual power splashing out.

As the Ten Extremes True Qi circulated, it faintly possessed the domineering nature of devouring all methods. Even the secret killing technique of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect dissolved like snow meeting blazing sun, vanishing without a trace.

Although the quality of his true qi was inferior to true essence, Xu Yunfan's body contained an overwhelming amount of it. If not for the lack of meridian networks within his physique, he could already begin to support his Dao Foundation and achieve the position of True Person.

Two hours later, Xu Yunfan gazed at the vermilion inscription "One Sword Generates All Methods" on the final page and said without looking up: "Now, shouldn't you tell me how to use this sword seal to lure out the Sword Sect disciples?"

Yu Congling remained silent for a moment before her voice turned cold as frost: "The Divine Martial World has already been branded with the sect mark by the Primordial Demon Sect; it is their exclusive territory. Three thousand years ago, my Myriad Chariots Sword Sect... ultimately failed to contend for this world's Dao lineage."

Xu Yunfan sneered, his knuckles tapping on the cover of the *Myriad Chariots Transformation Sword Art*, which he had already closed: "If that's the case, why are your Sword Sect people still lingering in this world?"

"When the Divine Martial World first appeared, the Primordial Demon Sect, Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, and Bodhi Pure Land fought for it."

Yu Congling's Extreme Dao Remnant Body slid slightly, its delicate skin pressing against Xu Yunfan, causing a slight tremor in her voice.

"Until within the Divine Martial World, that Foundation Establishment True Person of the Primordial Demon Sect used the 'Divine Martial Dao Foundation' to suppress the two sects, bloodwashing three thousand miles of mountains and rivers. The destiny of this world was then settled."

Xu Yunfan raised his brow: "So you lot are just the dregs of a game played by the upper realms."

"Under the Dao Foundation, all are but straw dogs."

Yu Congling's voice suddenly turned piercingly cold, the Chenghuang Sword Seals flickering on her spirit body. "Martial Dao cultivation was originally laid down by that Divine Martial Foundation Establishment True Person of the Primordial Demon Sect. Even if you leap beyond the nine realms of martial arts and break through your shackles to reach what you call a Land Immortal... if you haven't taken that step, you cannot escape being harvested by the world."

Dao Foundation, Dao Foundation!

Xu Yunfan asked: "What is a Dao Foundation?"

Yu Congling was silent for a moment, seemingly weighing whether to reveal the truth.

Ultimately, one must bow one's head when living under another's roof. With Xu Yunfan's current strength, he could easily destroy her Extreme Dao Remnant Body. A nearly inaudible sigh emanated from the remnant body.

"A Dao Foundation... is the first stepping stone for a cultivator to knock open the door to longevity."

"Stepping stone?"

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a sense of urgency; regarding longevity, he couldn't help but be concerned.

"Explain clearly."

"Do you know why ninth-rank masters are called 'Supreme'?" Yu Congling's voice became calm. "Back then, the three sects fought for the method of the Divine Martial Dao Foundation in order to produce another Foundation Establishment True Person. Like a cultivator at the Great Perfection of Qi Refining, to take a step further, one must use oneself as a furnace, melting and refining the laws of heaven and earth as a foundation. This is 'Foundation Establishment'!"

"The Primordial Demon Sect calls it the 'Primordial Dao Seed,' the Buddhist sect calls it the 'Arhat Dais,' and my Myriad Chariots Sword Sect... calls it the 'Chengtian Sword Seat'! But it all boils down to one thing: condensing one's essence, qi, and spirit, cultivating a path rarely taken by predecessors, using one's own cultivation attainment as fuel to support an ascension in dimension, achieving Foundation Establishment."

Xu Yunfan finally understood vaguely what Yu Congling was saying. To establish a foundation, one needed to find a cultivation method that had never produced a Foundation Establishment practitioner, or one where the Foundation Establishment practitioner had already died. Otherwise, if two people cultivating the same method and same path were to prepare for Foundation Establishment simultaneously, it would be a struggle for the Dao!

"So that's it—so-called Foundation Establishment is nothing more than a life-and-death struggle for the Dao."

"Precisely."

Yu Congling's voice was steeped in the chill accumulated over a thousand years, as if remembering something.

"But regardless of the name, the essence is defying heaven to seize fate! One must use one's own cultivation attainment as fuel, burning away the legacy left by predecessors, to open a unique path of ascension within the vast Dao!"

"More cruelly... if the method you cultivate already has a Foundation Establishment True Person existing in the world..."

Yu Congling's tone carried a hint of coldness.

"Even if they are separated by myriad worlds, they will sense it."

Xu Yunfan pressed: "How is it forged?"

"Why do you think the Nether Spring condensed a Purple Gold Pill? It was intended to sacrifice the imperial family to carry the Xuanhuang Qi of this heaven and earth."

Yu Congling sneered. "Foundation Establishment requires seizing the creation of heaven and earth! Absorbing the power of the world is easier. The Divine Martial World was planted with a secret technique by the Primordial Demon Sect, maturing once every five hundred years. The Great Zhou Emperor不知 from where he got his information, wanting to use the Xuanhuang Qi to refine a 'Divine Martial Dao Foundation,' but he didn't know he was merely a gu worm nurtured by the Nether Spring... This world's martial arts are inherently flawed."

"The true Dao Foundation requires the Land Immortal realm as firewood, Martial Dao Divine Ability as the ignition spark, and a hundred days of tempering to take shape. Three thousand years ago, after the Divine Martial True Person achieved his foundation, he was severely injured by my Myriad Chariots Sword Sect. Ultimately, his Dao Foundation was damaged, and he fled into reincarnation. Five lifetimes have passed since then, yet there is still no news of him, meaning the Divine Martial Dao Foundation is vacant!"

Speaking of this, Yu Congling's words carried a hint of intrigue: "This time, the people of the Primordial Demon Sect entering this world will likely be even more frantic than before."

Xu Yunfan naturally understood the meaning of Yu Congling's words, but he didn't care much, merely continuing his inquiry.

"You know so much; have you ever tried to establish a foundation?"

"If I knew..."

Yu Congling's voice was filled with the bitterness accumulated over countless years. "Why would I have needed to use the 'Sword Concealing Spirit Storage Art,' imprisoning my soul in this skin to barely survive?"

"What realm of Qi Refining are you at?"

"...Eighth layer."

Xu Yunfan nodded in understanding: "No wonder, it seems your strength wasn't enough."

"..."

Currently, Xu Yunfan had no mood to continue talking with Yu Congling. Time was tight, and he needed to find a way to maximize his strength before the disciples of the Primordial Demon Sect descended.

To rapidly increase his strength, he naturally needed to absorb the true qi of others.

When Xu Yunfan stepped over the broken palace steps, the pillar of Xuanhuang Qi rising behind him was echoing with the Grand Rite of Heaven at Clear Weeping Mountain.

Xu Yunfan saw this and didn't stop it. Since the Xuanhuang Qi was now useless to him, it was natural to give more back to the Dao Sect.

Whether it was the Nether Spring or the Divine Martial Crystal Yu Congling spoke of, he hadn't seen a single shadow of them yet, so he wasn't in a hurry.

However, he didn't return to the Dao Sect immediately. Instead, he turned to look at the smoke-filled Jade Capital City.

There, Li Haomiao's Black Iron Army was entangled with the Imperial Guard, and several dormant ninth-rank auras were hidden within.
