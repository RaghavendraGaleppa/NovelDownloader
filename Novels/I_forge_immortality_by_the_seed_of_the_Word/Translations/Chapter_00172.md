# Chapter 169: The Dao Tea Gathering, The Gathering Storm

"Innate Divine Ability?"

Zhang Jing 'looked' at the golden sun auspicious cloud Dao mark that suddenly appeared in his Sea of Consciousness.

He couldn't help but feel a slight surprise.
At the same time, a hint of realization dawned on him.

"So, the extra reward for passing the first round of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm is this innate divine ability? No wonder each person can only possess one Proud Cloud Edict... more would indeed be useless." Zhang Jing thought to himself.

However, his surprise lasted less than half a breath. His attention was drawn by the anomaly on his Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed.

The next moment, he saw the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed spin, then return to his Sea of Consciousness, directly pouncing towards the golden sun auspicious cloud Dao mark, like a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey.

Zhang Jing could have stopped the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud, but he didn't intervene, letting it act freely. He quietly watched this scene unfold in his Sea of Consciousness, and a sudden sense of curiosity arose within him.

This was the first time the Seed had reacted like this...

...

Only an instant had passed in the outside world. However, within his Sea of Consciousness, it felt as if a thousand years had gone by. The Golden Sun Auspicious Cloud Mark quietly vanished. This meant that the innate divine ability Zhang Jing had just acquired disappeared without being used even once.

Yet, he showed not a shred of disappointment or dejection. Quite the opposite, in fact. At this moment, Zhang Jing's heart was filled with excitement and a strong sense of anticipation.

The Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Seed, after devouring the [Remnant Proud Sun Mark], actually felt like it was on the verge of transformation! Although the feeling was faint, it was undeniably present.

"Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud, Proud Sun Auspicious Cloud... it seems the reward for winning the second round, besides one hundred million points of Qi Luck, there's also something called the Proud Sun Imprint. I imagine it can also be devoured and integrated by the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud."

"So, following this pattern, if I can achieve first place in the Foundation Establishment realm, the extra reward would be..."

Thinking of this, a smile of anticipation suddenly appeared on Zhang Jing's face. The Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud, already of Extreme Grade quality, if it were to transform again, would most likely become an Immortal Seed. He now had another reason to aim for first place in the Foundation Establishment rankings.

Coming back to his senses, with a thought, he took a step forward, and a heavy stone gate suddenly appeared before him.

...

Outside, the ancient stone gate of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm once again glowed with streams of immortal light, and a powerful surge of energy immediately swept across the entire Proud Cloud Immortal City.

For a moment, from every corner of the Immortal City, everyone, including the cultivators who had been eliminated earlier, simultaneously stopped what they were doing and looked towards the Secret Realm's stone gate.

In an instant, dense, rain-like beams of varied rainbow light flew out from the majestic stone gate, a hundred zhang tall and a thousand zhang wide, landing on the vast square below, which glowed with a faint luminescence. They instantly transformed into figures brimming with high spirits.

Among the crowd, Zhang Jing, clad in a light-colored Dharma robe, slowly swept his gaze around. Unlike the previous bustling sea of people, the square beneath his feet now had already become spacious and quiet.

Moreover, different from when they entered the secret realm, almost everyone's face was now etched with an undisguised excitement, some even remaining stunned in place, their eyes filled with disbelief. Perhaps a part of it was due to the immense twenty million Qi Luck reward. But Zhang Jing knew the more significant reason was likely the newly acquired innate divine ability, [Remnant Proud Sun Mark].

He didn't seem overly excited about the appearance of this innate divine ability. If he were to express excitement, it would be because this item might cause his Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud to transform and upgrade. However, that was because Zhang Jing possessed the mysterious jade talisman. He had a Dharma Seed within him! After all, in a sense, a Dharma Seed was no different from an innate divine ability or innate divine power. Except that its quantity was not limited, and it could also be upgraded. It was just slightly stronger than the so-called innate divine abilities or powers.

But others were different. Why were the beings of the Myriad Heavens Myriad Spirits faction so powerful? A crucial point was that from birth, they possessed various innate divine abilities or powers. Those with powerful bloodlines almost universally reached the Dharma Idol realm upon adulthood. In comparison, the human race was far behind; only upon advancing to the Golden Core realm was there a certain possibility of condensing an innate divine ability or power. And this was still based on cultivating top-tier inheritances.

But now, these tens of thousands of people present had, in effect, directly gained an innate divine ability, and a precious one at that, enhancing their comprehension. Their inner excitement was easily imaginable.

Slowly retracting his gaze, Zhang Jing thought, "What I can think of, they naturally have also thought of. The emergence of the innate divine ability reward might make the subsequent rounds quite interesting."

Zhang Jing smiled faintly, then his expression quickly returned to calm.

*Tap, tap—*

His figure slowly disappeared into the crowd. However, he had not walked many steps when a light footstep entered his ears, growing closer and closer.

"Senior Brother Zhang, please wait."

Hearing this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but stop, turned his head, and a faint smile immediately appeared on his face.

"Oh, it's you, Junior Brother Shen Chu and the others. Is there something you need?"

The ones who had caught up were precisely the few Junior Brothers from the Grand Unity Dao Sect whom he had met at Combat Arena 29.

Facing him, the trio respectfully approached Zhang Jing, performed a somewhat restrained bow, and then cautiously spoke: "Dare I ask, Senior Brother, if you are free the day after tomorrow? Many disciples of our Grand Unity Dao Sect who have come to Proud Cloud Immortal City plan to hold a Dao Tea Gathering at the Myriad Immortals Pavilion the day after tomorrow. Everyone will discuss the Dao and share information from the various combat arenas."

"We would like to invite Senior Brother to preside over it."

Having said that, the three simultaneously looked up at Zhang Jing, their eyes revealing a hopeful look.

"Dao Tea Gathering? Sharing information from the various combat arenas?" A flicker of interest immediately arose in Zhang Jing's heart.

But then he looked at them with a half-smile and asked: "Junior Brothers, I suspect it's not as simple as just a tea party. Why don't you tell me everything?"

As the saying goes, one doesn't visit a temple without a reason. Moreover, the word 'preside' (坐镇) from their mouths made Zhang Jing sense something unusual.

Shen Chu, hearing this, couldn't help but show a wry smile and frankly said: "Senior Brother indeed has keen insight." He paused, seemingly organizing his words, then quickly continued: "I wouldn't dare to deceive Senior Brother, but disciples from both the Heaven Realm lineage and our Lower Realm Nine Domains lineage will attend this Dao Tea Gathering. And our Nine Domains lineage also has two Senior Brothers from the Grotto-heavens presiding, which gives us a slight edge over the Heaven Realm lineage."

"However..."

"It is said that those from the Heaven Realm lineage later invited the legendary Senior Brother Ge Qingshen. In that case, relying solely on our two Grotto-heaven Senior Brothers might not be enough. It just so happens that a few of us met you at the combat arena, so we thought—"

"You thought of pulling me in to make up the numbers, right?" Zhang Jing teased with a smile.

Shen Chu's expression instantly changed, and he waved his hands repeatedly: "Senior Brother, you misunderstand. While Senior Brother Ge Qingshen is indeed powerful and difficult to contend with, it is, after all, just a tea party. If we have more Grotto-heaven disciples than them, at least in terms of momentum... the 'face' of the gathering won't be too bad."

After understanding the reason, without much thought, Zhang Jing smiled and nodded in response: "Understood. I'll go and see the excitement then."

"Thank you, Senior Brother! We will await your esteemed presence then!" A uncontrollable flush of joy appeared on their brows. The trio couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief, then excitedly exclaimed.

Just then, a golden rainbow quietly landed beside Zhang Jing.

Then a voice, tinged with joy, rang out: "Haha, Brother Zhang, so you were here! I've been looking all over for you. How about it, didn't expect there to be an unexpected surprise after passing the first round, did you? — Hmm, who are these three?"

Qu Junhou, who had appeared, looked at Shen Chu and the other two with a puzzled expression.

"Brother Qu, this is Junior Brother Shen Chu from Myriad Dragon Blessed Land, and this is Junior Brother Wei Lin from Fufeng Dharma Realm..."

At Qu Junhou's sudden appearance, Zhang Jing was slightly taken aback for a moment, then proceeded to introduce them one by one. After the introductions were complete, he seemed to suddenly realize something and, with interest, said to Shen Chu and the others: "This is Qu Junhou from Shangyuan Qingjing Grotto-heaven. Weren't you looking to invite a Grotto-heaven disciple to the Dao Tea Gathering the day after tomorrow? Here's a ready-made candidate!"

As soon as he said this, Shen Chu and the other two's gazes froze. A few breaths later, as they slowly processed what was said, they exchanged glances, both discovering the shock in each other's eyes.

Shangyuan Qingjing Grotto-heaven! Another disciple from one of the Ten Great Grotto-heavens!

On the other side, "Dao Tea Gathering? The day after tomorrow?" Qu Junhou was completely bewildered, feeling a bit lost. "Brother Zhang, are you also attending?" He asked Zhang Jing curiously.

Meeting his gaze, Zhang Jing smiled and nodded.

"Alright then, save a spot for me." Receiving an affirmative answer, Qu Junhou agreed without hesitation.

"Thank you, Senior Brothers!" A flash of excitement instantly crossed the eyes of Shen Chu and the other two.

"Junior Brothers, we'll take our leave first." Seeing that there was nothing else, Zhang Jing said goodbye warmly.

"Senior Brothers, please take care."

...

"Brother Zhang, why are you going to participate in that Dao Tea Gathering?"

"It's nothing much, just for everyone to exchange information about the various combat arenas. Oh, by the way, that Ge Qingshen will also be attending."

"Ge Qingshen? Just a clown."

Shen Chu and the other two remained stunned in place. In their line of sight, Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou slowly walked away. In their ears, the faint sound of their conversation could be heard. In their words, the two Senior Brothers not only showed no reverence towards the legendary Senior Brother Ge Qingshen but also carried a hint of disdain.

Upon hearing this, Shen Chu's heart immediately churned with tumultuous waves.
