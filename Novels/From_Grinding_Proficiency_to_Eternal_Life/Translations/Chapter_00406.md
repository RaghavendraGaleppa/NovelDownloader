# Chapter 406: A Task Worthy of Zhou Bapi

In the Primordial Origin Sect, the law of the jungle is the only truth. Only by breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm can one escape the classification of "human material" and gain autonomy.

This is not only the bottom line for survival but also the starting point for climbing higher.

Foundation Establishment True Lords hold entirely different status within this Demonic Path sect.

They can independently establish their own peak, accept disciples and pass down laws, and even participate in the sect's decision-making.

Which of those high and mighty Peak Masters did not build their Foundation by stepping upon mountains of corpses and seas of blood?

"Foundation Establishment, opening a peak..."

Xu Yunfan looked toward the main hall of the Hundred Desires Peak, shrouded in mist. The Hundred Flowers True Lord residing there had stabilized her position in the sect by relying on the art of dual cultivation and energy absorption to achieve Foundation Establishment.

He had to complete the final transformation of "Refining the Body with Heavenly Gang, Forging the Soul with Earthly Evil" as soon as possible. By then, he would not only be able to escape the situation of being at others' mercy, but he might also be able to open the Divine Martial Realm and bring some people up to serve as his subordinates.

He turned and inserted the mission jade slip into the "Myriad Aspects Disc" at the center of the hall.

As the mechanism turned, gilded text reorganized in the void:

**[Number Jia-732: Harvest Heavenly Heart Snow Lotus (300 years or older)]**

**[Contribution Points: 800]**

**[Note: Snow Lotus Seeds are the main ingredient for the Severing Heart Pill. For every additional century of potency, the pill formation rate increases by 5%.]**

Suddenly, a scroll floated up from below the disc. This was the unique "Blood Contract" of the Primordial Origin Sect.

If the task was completed, one would naturally obtain 800 contribution points. If it failed, it was considered a breach of contract, requiring the repayment of three times the reward.

That is, 2,400 contribution points.

It was truly even more ruthless than Zhou Bapi.

This was why, in the Hall of All Affairs, missions were rarely taken by individuals. Aside from disciples with exceptionally strong confidence and powerful strength, most formed small teams.

That way, even if they failed, the contribution points to be repaid would be shared among everyone.

"Senior Brother..."

A timid voice came from behind.

Xu Yunfan turned around to see a thin, freckle-faced youth. "I am Li Ergou from the Medicinal Child Peak, at the third layer of Qi Refining. I know some geomancy..."

Before he could finish, a white bone folding fan suddenly extended from the side, pressing against the youth's throat.

A disciple dressed like a young master in a purple robe sneered, "How dare a dreg of medicine lay a finger on the Snow Lotus?"

Upon seeing the young master in the purple robe, Li Ergou shrank his head and didn't dare to speak.

Xu Yunfan's eyebrows raised slightly as his gaze swept over the crowd, saying nothing.

Which of the disciples surviving in this demonic den known as the Primordial Origin Sect was not a scheming individual?

Those who appear weak on the surface might take your life in the blink of an eye.

Although Li Ergou was contemptuously called "medicine dregs" by the purple-robed young man, he had survived intact until now, even maintaining his cultivation steadily at the third layer of Qi Refining with a solid foundation devoid of any instability. Just this ability alone was something ordinary people could not achieve.

"Scram!"

The purple-robed young man flicked his fan, and the tip of the fan bone shot out a three-inch cold gleam. "A mere waste who has been sucked dry of his Yang essence dares to tag along on the Heavenly Heart Snow Lotus mission?"

Li Ergou's Adam's apple bobbed, his face turning pale, but he stubbornly craned his neck. "I... I can discern the flow of Earthly Evil veins..."

"Oh?"

A crisp, flirtatious laugh suddenly interrupted.

Everyone turned back to see a girl with double buns skipping over.

She looked about thirteen or fourteen years old, with almond eyes and a round face. A string of silver bells hung at her waist, chiming with every step.

"Senior Brother Zhou is so imposing~"

The girl tilted her head, her fingertips gently pushing away the fan bone pressing against Li Ergou's throat. "This Junior Brother's geomancy was even praised by the elders of our Hundred Grass Hall."

Li Ergou's fingers tightened subconsciously upon hearing this. He had indeed been praised by an elder from the Hundred Desires Peak's Hundred Grass Hall, but he had almost been refined into actual medicine dregs. If he hadn't been clever enough to borrow the name of a certain powerful figure to make the other party hesitate, he wouldn't have had the chance to stand here now.

The purple-robed young man's pupils constricted. He hadn't sensed the girl getting close at all!

The "Yin Evil Qi" attached to his fan had been silently dissolved.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over the girl.

Hmm, very cute. She looked truly like a child on the surface, with an innocent and lively smile on her face, and her Yin essence was extremely abundant. It was clear she had cultivated the Hundred Desires Swallowing Yuan Great Method to a very deep level to be like this.

"This little one is Hua Ling, at the fourth layer of Qi Refining, a disciple of the Hundred Grass Hall on Hundred Desires Peak."

The girl blinked at Xu Yunfan with a smile. "I happen to need Snow Lotus stamens for a potion. How about we form a team?"

"Forming a team? That is perfectly fine. Senior Sister, your timing is perfect. I was just short on people."

Xu Yunfan's lips curled up slightly, his gaze lingering for a moment on the string of silver bells at Hua Ling's waist.

Each bell had inscriptions as fine as mosquito legs carved on the inner walls, glowing with a faint blood light as they swayed. This was the Hundred Desires Peak's unique "Soul Capturing Bells." A gentle shake would send out sound waves capable of making one's head buzz, and it specifically broke through the protective pure light of Righteous Path cultivators, disrupting their true energy.

But it wasn't just Righteous Path cultivators who would be affected.

Xu Yunfan's gaze lingered on the string of silver bells at Hua Ling's waist, a barely perceptible heat flashing in the depths of his pupils.

A Dharma Artifact!

Since entering the Taihua Spirit Ruin Realm, he had seen many Primordial Origin Sect cultivators驾驭 Dharma Artifacts.

Those spoils of war brought out from the Divine Martial Realm, including the items looted from Xu Tian and the others in the canyon, were of high quality but were stained with inextinguishable blood.

Under the watchful eyes of a giant like the Primordial Origin Sect, these "dirty goods" were like hot potatoes. If he wasn't careful, they would invite death.

He really couldn't bury himself in cultivation for too long.

He wondered if there was a black market within the Hundred Desires Peak.

He secretly calculated ways to sell the goods, but then shook his head inwardly.

In the Primordial Origin Sect, a newcomer with no backing recklessly selling such treasures was no different than a child holding gold walking through a busy market. Many people would try every means to find out his background.

"Perhaps there should be some marketplaces on this trip."

"That's great!"

Hua Ling clapped her hands and laughed, the silver bells chiming. "Does Senior Brother Zhou want to join too?"

She turned her head to look at the purple-robed young man, almond eyes rippling with innocence, but her fingertips intentionally or unintentionally stroked the jade tablet hanging at her waist, looking at him with a smile full of meaning.

The purple-robed young man's expression changed slightly, and he snapped his fan shut.

"No need."

He gave Li Ergou a deep look, couldn't help but snort coldly, and turned away. His sleeves fluttered, bringing up a gust of foul wind.

Several onlooking disciples hurriedly retreated. A youth at the second layer of Qi Refining couldn't dodge in time. His cheek, grazed by the sleeve wind, immediately festered and festered. He couldn't help but let out two painful groans, but didn't dare to scream.

Xu Yunfan watched coldly from the side.

His gaze, however, circled around Li Ergou. He wondered what exactly the purple-robed disciple saw in Li Ergou to target him so specifically.

In his previous life, this would naturally be considered typical bullying.

But in a place known to the outside world as the Primordial Origin Sect, for Li Ergou to have persisted for so long, looking as if he was resigned to his fate, was absolutely not easy.
