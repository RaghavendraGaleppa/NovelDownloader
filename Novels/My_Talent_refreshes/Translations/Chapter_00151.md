# Chapter 151: One Against Two, Killing Foundation Establishment Cultivators

"What's going on? How is this formation array's defense so strong?"

The two Foundation Establishment cultivators attacked for a while, a hint of surprise on their faces. In their minds, it was merely a Qi Condensation cultivator's cave dwelling; how strong could its formation array be? They had thought a direct assault would suffice. However, despite their continuous barrage creating considerable commotion, it yielded no results whatsoever.

Chu Ning, safe within the array, felt greatly relieved as he sensed that the formation's defenses remained completely intact. Immediately, his gaze sharpened. "Are they leaving?"

The two Foundation Establishment cultivators realized they couldn't directly breach Chu Ning's cave dwelling. After the square-faced cultivator exchanged a glance, the grey-robed cultivator actually withdrew his attack. It seemed they intended to leave. Chu Ning didn't know if they planned to call for backup or had some other reason, but he absolutely could not let them leave. Since his cave dwelling had been exposed, and they believed he had obtained something valuable, if he truly let them go, he would likely never know peace.

"Seniors, please hold your attacks. This junior will come out," Chu Ning suddenly called out.

The grey-robed cultivator, who had been about to leave outside the cave, halted his steps upon hearing this. The square-faced cultivator also stopped his assault. Only then did Chu Ning fly out, appearing before them.

Seeing Chu Ning, both Foundation Establishment cultivators showed a mix of triumph and disdain in their eyes. Chu Ning cupped a hand in greeting. "This junior greets both Seniors. May I know your esteemed names, and why you were chasing that person to Rainbow Isle?"

"I am Peng Dajun from Shadowmoon Island, and this is Fellow Daoist He Mingjin from Azure Waves Island. As for why we're chasing him, that's none of your business," the square-faced cultivator declared. The grey-robed cultivator then looked at Chu Ning with ill intent. "Brat! You've got guts, making us shout out here for so long without coming out."

Chu Ning didn't reply. Instead, a hint of confusion appeared on his face. "My apologies, Seniors, but I don't recall seeing either of you during the Thousand Islands Competition." He had paid close attention to all Foundation Establishment cultivators during that competition.

Shadowmoon Island and Azure Waves Island were both among the top ten islands, and Chu Ning had specifically noted their cultivators. Peng Dajun, the square-faced cultivator from Shadowmoon Island, waved a dismissive hand. "We were elsewhere then, so it's normal you haven't seen us." Saying this, he seemed to lose patience and imperiously asked Chu Ning, "Brat, what's your name? Did you see that fellow take out anything just now?"

"Is this what Senior is referring to?" Chu Ning took a step forward as he spoke. The next moment, he suddenly flicked his wrist, and an item shot towards the square-faced man, Peng Dajun.

The square-faced man initially rejoiced at the sight, but his expression drastically changed when he saw what was flying towards him. It was an inky-black light, shooting directly at him. Behind this dark light, a fire sphere followed closely. The inky-black light didn't exude much oppressive power, yet it made him sense a hint of danger.

His expression shifting, Peng Dajun immediately activated a defensive barrier in front of him. At the same time, the grey-robed cultivator, He Mingjin, bellowed, "Audacious!" As he spoke, he waved his hand, and four or five spells swept towards Chu Ning.

However, layers of light barriers instantly lit up around Chu Ning. These spells struck him but were all blocked. It was at this very moment that the grey-robed cultivator suddenly heard a terrified cry from beside him.

"No!!"

Peng Dajun's spiritual tool's protective barrier, under the dark light's assault, merely trembled slightly before being directly pierced. With that one strike of dark light, Peng Dajun's spiritual power-condensed defense immediately crumbled. The inky-black short blade plunged directly into his body. Instantly, an incredibly powerful destructive force began to corrode his body. The square-faced cultivator used almost all his spiritual power to forcefully resist the dark light's destructive power.

But at that moment, a fire sphere followed closely. Initially, Peng Dajun hadn't paid it much mind. Even though he was severely wounded, a mere Fireball spell couldn't harm him. However, when the fire sphere struck his body, and the rampant, fiery spiritual power consumed him entirely, the man finally let out a horrified scream.

Along with that scream, Peng Dajun's entire body was instantly incinerated by the raging flames. Only a few items fell to the ground.

"How is this possible?" The grey-robed cultivator, He Mingjin, stared in utter shock. A Foundation Establishment cultivator at the early stage was directly annihilated by a single strike from a Qi Condensation Level Eight cultivator!

His heart pounding wildly, He Mingjin immediately grew vigilant. His figure swiftly darted to the side. Almost simultaneously with his movement, several streaks of flame flew past from where he had been. He Mingjin looked, and saw that Chu Ning, opposite him, now held a long spear. Flames swirled around the spear. With a flick of Chu Ning's wrist, streaks of fierce flames assailed him. Closely following, Chu Ning himself transformed into a streak of crimson light and shot towards him.

"A top-grade spiritual tool?"

"Hmph!" He Mingjin snorted. "The power of a top-grade spiritual tool depends on whose hands it's in!" Though he thought this, he showed no carelessness. A protective barrier instantly appeared around his body. At the same time, he released his spiritual sense, directly enveloping Chu Ning.

He Mingjin admitted that he and Peng Dajun had been careless just now. They hadn't expected Chu Ning to dare to ambush them, let alone possess such a destructive spiritual tool. But now, with his guard up, even a top-grade spiritual tool couldn't shatter his defense with a single strike. As for Chu Ning, who was flying towards him from behind, He Mingjin didn't put him in his eyes at all. At this moment, he would let Chu Ning know why Foundation Establishment cultivators and Qi Condensation cultivators were on completely different levels. As long as a Foundation Establishment cultivator used spiritual sense to suppress an attack, a Qi Condensation cultivator, no matter how many tricks they had, wouldn't be able to use them.

A ruthless glint flashed in He Mingjin's eyes, and his spiritual sense pressed fiercely down on Chu Ning in mid-air.

"Ah!" But the next moment, He Mingjin felt a sudden, sharp pain in his head, as if it were about to explode. "Spiritual sense backlash, how is that possible?" He Mingjin seemed to react now, his eyes wider with astonishment than before.

The next moment, his face suddenly turned incredibly pale. Because at the same time, Chu Ning had already arrived, wreathed in surging flames. And He Mingjin, due to the immense spiritual sense backlash he had just suffered, couldn't even maintain the protective barrier around his body.

"No!"

He Mingjin let out the same horrified cry as Peng Dajun had moments ago. He suppressed the piercing pain in his mind and pulled a defensive spiritual tool from his storage pouch. But it was all too late. Before he could activate the spiritual tool, Chu Ning had already reached him!

The Fire Phoenix Feather Spear, wreathed in crimson flames, plunged directly into his chest.

"You die too!" Feeling that he couldn't possibly withstand the destructive power of this strike, the grey-robed cultivator roared! He suddenly emitted a golden light! Even in his dying moments, he launched a fierce attack. At such close range, even Chu Ning couldn't easily dodge. However, his defense was equally swift. Spiritual power flowed into the Earth Spirit Bracelet, and immediately, a dense, earthy yellow light barrier enveloped his entire body.

The golden light struck the yellow light barrier. The yellow light barrier instantly shattered. But at the same time, another white water-attribute light barrier appeared around Chu Ning's body. It was the Profound Water Spirit Talisman! Chu Ning, having deciphered this intermediate-grade top-tier talisman, could now craft it himself, and naturally, integrate it into his talisman ring. This allowed for instantaneous casting, without needing to retrieve the talisman.

The golden light, already weakened by the Earth Spirit Bracelet's block, disintegrated upon striking the white light barrier. Seeing this, the grey-robed cultivator, He Mingjin, was filled with unwillingness and confusion. However, he no longer had time to think. The Fire Phoenix Feather Spear, embedded in his body, flashed with a crimson light. The Foundation Establishment cultivator's body slowly dissipated in the fierce flames. The power of a top-grade spiritual tool combined with Chu Ning's Fire Spirit Physique was so immense that a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator's body simply couldn't withstand it.

In just a few exchanges, Chu Ning had killed two early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators. Only now did Chu Ning disperse the spiritual power around him and nod slightly. "The trial run seems to have gone pretty well!"

As he finished speaking, Chu Ning used his Item Manipulation Art to collect all the items dropped by the two cultivators. Then, a ball of fire shot towards the Foundation Establishment cultivator who had first entered the array. That man had already been searched by Peng Dajun and He Mingjin, so he had nothing on him. After launching the fireball, Chu Ning was about to turn and return to his cave dwelling.

"Eh?" But the next moment, he suddenly paused. At the spot where the man had turned to ash, there was still an item. Chu Ning walked closer in confusion and picked it up. He discovered it was something made from an unknown demonic beast hide. He wondered how this cultivator had hidden it so well that the two Foundation Establishment cultivators hadn't found it during their search.

Chu Ning opened the beast hide and found a fragmented map inside. Looking at the shapes marked on the map, it seemed to be a middle section, and Chu Ning couldn't make out anything useful for a while. So, he took this map, along with the other items from the three men, back to his cave dwelling.

Back in his stone chamber, Chu Ning sat in the spot with the best view, his gaze fixed on the distant lake. He remained motionless until darkness completely fell and no one else appeared, only then did Chu Ning let out a long sigh of relief. He wasn't worried about the battle being discovered by the island's inhabitants. After all, the island was located at a very remote edge, and with Jiang Hongguang's orders, cultivators rarely came within dozens of miles of this area. The skirmish had been very brief, and since there were no high-level cultivators on the island, they likely wouldn't have noticed. Chu Ning's concern was whether there were other cultivators following the three. Fortunately, to his great relief, an hour passed, and no one else appeared.

Only then did Chu Ning reach for the three men's spiritual tools and storage pouches to examine them. This was his first time killing Foundation Establishment cultivators, and he had killed three at once. He wanted to see what good things these cultivators possessed.

Chu Ning first looked at the spiritual tools the two had just used. Although the grey-robed cultivator, He Mingjin, ultimately failed to withstand Chu Ning's Fire Phoenix Feather Spear attack, it was mainly because he had tried to attack Chu Ning with his spiritual sense and was then hit by Chu Ning's Spirit Restriction Art backlash. Otherwise, with a Foundation Establishment cultivator's methods, Chu Ning might not have killed him so easily. Chu Ning remembered that the spiritual power barrier the opponent had initially conjured wasn't weak either. After Chu Ning killed him, a jade belt fell from his body, which should have been his defensive spiritual tool. Chu Ning infused it with spiritual power and examined it.

"A water-attribute defensive spiritual tool. Although not a top-grade spiritual tool, its defensive capabilities are comparable to more than half of a top-grade one. In terms of power, it should be similar to the Earth Spirit Bracelet." However, this jade belt didn't require Earth Spirit Crystals or similar items to activate, making it clearly more advanced than Chu Ning's Earth Spirit Bracelet. This undoubtedly filled Chu Ning with joy. He knew that after repeated use, his Earth Spirit Crystal had little left.

Now, Chu Ning looked at the bronze mirror-like spiritual tool before him. This was the defensive spiritual tool that square-faced Peng Dajun had just used. Although his defensive barrier had been directly pierced by the inky-black short blade, the dark blade's power had clearly diminished significantly afterward; otherwise, Peng Dajun wouldn't have been able to block it at all. If Chu Ning hadn't had a backup plan, immediately following up with a tenfold fire sphere condensed from the Blazing Flame Art, the opponent might not have died so quickly.

"A top-grade spiritual tool!" Chu Ning held it in his hand, first startled, then his face filled with delight. This small mirror was actually a genuine top-grade spiritual tool. With almost no hesitation, Chu Ning infused spiritual power into the bronze mirror. Immediately, a white light barrier appeared, enveloping Chu Ning.

At this point, Chu Ning's joyous expression faded, replaced by a hint of confusion. Because the white light barrier, purely in terms of defensive capability, seemed to be not much different from the jade belt he had just examined. Logically, as a top-grade spiritual tool, its power should be significantly stronger. Chu Ning tried to continue infusing spiritual power and looked for any other hidden functions. But after trying for a long time, he found nothing else.

At this point, Chu Ning simply walked to the spirit beast room where Ling Xiaobai was staying. He then spoke to the little fellow, "Xiaobai, try spraying a spell!"

Seeing Chu Ning enveloped in a protective barrier and asking him to spray a spell, Ling Xiaobai knew that Chu Ning wanted to test its power. Chu Ning wasn't doing this for the first time. Ling Xiaobai didn't ask further, opened its mouth and sprayed an ice arrow towards Chu Ning. Half a year had passed, and Ling Xiaobai's cultivation seemed to have increased considerably. This ice arrow was much thicker than before, and there was a faint blue hue within its white color.

The ice arrow struck the barrier around Chu Ning. The white light barrier dented inwards slightly, looking as if it would break through at any moment. The next moment, the ice arrow bounced back, shooting directly towards Ling Xiaobai at an even faster speed than it had arrived. Moreover, the ice arrow was even a few parts thicker than before.

"Ying!" Ling Xiaobai immediately realized something was wrong. It shrieked and quickly leaped away. The ice arrow struck the ground, directly piercing through it and burrowing into the earth, disappearing from sight.

Ignoring Ling Xiaobai's whimpering complaints from the side, Chu Ning's eyes lit up at this sight. He finally understood why this mirror was a top-grade spiritual tool. Damage reflection! The mirror's barrier didn't seem to have extremely strong defenses, but it was incredibly resilient. It could actually reflect the opponent's spell damage. And observing the ice arrow's form afterward, its power and speed were even stronger than when Ling Xiaobai had first fired it.

"What a treasure!" Chu Ning was overjoyed. He now understood how to use this magical mirror. Clearly, as long as it wasn't a spell that could directly break through a top-grade spiritual tool's defense, this magical mirror's barrier could reflect the spell, with the target being the caster themselves. As for its failure to block the inky-black short blade, it was clearly not due to the spiritual tool's defensive capabilities, but because the damaged magical treasure's inky-black short blade was simply too powerful.

To be honest, after trying the Fire Phoenix Feather Spear, he had been focused on obtaining a top-grade defensive spiritual tool. There was a significant disparity between the two. His previous Earth Spirit Bracelet was already nearing 60% of a top-grade spiritual tool's power, but its defense was already proving insufficient. For instance, it failed to completely block the grey-robed cultivator He Mingjin's dying strike just now. If Chu Ning hadn't had the Profound Water Spirit True Talisman Art, he would have had to endure it with his body. Although with his Unbroken Sinews Body Tempering Art, it might not have caused actual damage, Chu Ning's consistent philosophy was to be as safe as possible. And now, he had obtained two defensive spiritual tools, one of which was a top-grade spiritual tool. This truly made Chu Ning ecstatic.

Returning to his previous stone chamber, Chu Ning now looked through the three men's storage pouches. He Mingjin and Peng Dajun's storage pouches contained quite a lot of items, including high-grade pills and talismans, as well as some spirit herbs and Qi Condensation refinement materials. Peng Dajun, in particular, seemed to be an alchemist himself, as his storage pouch contained a large quantity of alchemy materials. One jade slip even recorded a basic alchemy technique, along with many organized pill formulas.

He Mingjin's storage pouch didn't have as many materials, but it did contain many mid-grade spirit stones. Furthermore, what surprised Chu Ning most was that it contained many jade slips with recorded information. This person seemed to love collecting and organizing data. One jade slip recorded some ancient legends of the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands. Another jade slip recorded common demonic beasts of the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands. Yet another jade slip recorded some obscure and rare spirit plants and herbs, some of which Chu Ning had never seen before even in the Green Stream Sect. Besides these, there were also some jade slips recording cultivation techniques and spells. As He Mingjin was a gold-attribute cultivator, many of these were gold-attribute cultivation techniques and spells, which Chu Ning didn't have much use for. However, one jade slip also contained some spells of other attributes, which quite surprised Chu Ning.

Chu Ning didn't examine them one by one, merely putting this particular jade slip aside to study carefully later. Then, Chu Ning picked up the storage pouch of the Foundation Establishment cultivator who had died first within his formation array. As soon as he poured out the contents of the storage pouch, Chu Ning's attention was immediately drawn to one item.
