# Chapter 102: The Doppelganger

Baili Jinyan regained consciousness, but found himself unable to utilize even a trace of spiritual energy within his body. He couldn't even open his eyelids.

An excruciating pain, as if his skin were being flayed and tendons ripped out, radiated from every inch of his body—no part was spared from this torment.

Just as he had inflicted soul-rending agony upon Li Shiming, he now suffered physical pain of the utmost intensity.

"I've been captured by Li Shiming! He's torturing me with the same methods!" Baili Jinyan realized his predicament and guessed at the possibility.

Unlike Li Shiming's endurance, the mere thought was all he could manage before the pain overwhelmed his ability to think. The unbearable agony made his very soul tremble.

He couldn't comprehend what method Li Shiming had used to restrain his body—a body that had reached the pinnacle of Qi Refinement stage physical cultivation, comparable to an early Foundation Establishment cultivator—rendering him completely immobile.

Gradually, he was losing sensation in his body, while simultaneously feeling something eroding his soul.

What Baili Jinyan didn't know was that his immobilized state wasn't intentional on Li Shiming's part—it was a side effect of the refining process for a Lifebound Corpse.

At this moment, Baili Jinyan's body was undergoing transformation into a corpse puppet. Moreover, this was an unnatural process—a living body being forcibly converted into an undead.

It wasn't that no cultivators had researched the feasibility of converting living humans into corpse puppets. In fact, such cruel experiments had never ceased among wicked practitioners.

But the process always failed during the initial stages of corpse refinement, stumping all researchers.

Baili Jinyan's body was special. The third-grade treasure that had induced his feigned death even deceived the corpse-transforming fluid during the initial stages of the Lifebound Corpse refinement.

Only after five hours of transformation did the third-grade treasure finally activate, beginning to repair Baili Jinyan's body.

This only prolonged his suffering. Had it been just the corpse-transforming fluid, he would have died quickly rather than enduring prolonged torment.

The third-grade treasure created a tug-of-war between the transforming fluid and its healing energy within his body—with Baili Jinyan as the ultimate victim of this battle.

Slowly, Baili Jinyan's consciousness scattered. His final resentment faded away, replaced by the newly formed corpse spirit reconstructed from the transformation fluid containing Li Shiming's blood.

More importantly, the Computer Room Space—that unique dimension bound to Li Shiming's soul—subtly strengthened the connection between the newly formed corpse spirit and Li Shiming during its creation.

The bond between a Lifebound Corpse and its master was already profound, but the Computer Room Space intensified this connection, making the newborn spirit perfectly attuned to Li Shiming.

Since Baili Jinyan's body hadn't moved at all, IBMz15 didn't alert Li Shiming, allowing the entire process to occur without disturbing his rest.

Two hours later, the internal struggle within Baili Jinyan's body finally ended.

The body neither fully transformed into a corpse puppet nor was completely healed by the third-grade treasure. Instead, it entered a state known as a Living Corpse.

Living Corpses were a naturally occurring, extremely rare type of zombie that required stringent conditions—multiple high-grade treasures and countless coincidences—to form.

Historical records mentioned them as the rarest of legendary zombies.

These zombies possessed vitality yet maintained the defensive capabilities and yin-cold aura of regular zombies, existing in a liminal state between life and death.

After a long sleep, Li Shiming awoke, his fatigue completely gone and his body restored to peak condition.

Recalling recent events, he remembered the corpse he'd left in the Computer Room Space.

As the thought crossed his mind, his vision blurred, and he suddenly found himself in a room with a white ceiling four meters high.

Disoriented, he wondered, "Did I transmigrate again?" Feeling the state of this body, the thought came naturally.

This body felt extraordinary—overflowing with power, its spiritual energy vortex thick and dense—clearly not his original form.

Compared to his original body, this one was vastly superior in strength alone. He estimated it could overpower his original body single-handedly, even if the latter used spells or magical implements.

The spiritual energy vortex was even more astonishing. While the Qi Refinement stage had nine levels, they all represented growth stages of the spiritual energy vortex.

The vortex in this body possessed a quality of spiritual energy he'd never imagined, its volume more than ten times that of his original.

Attempting to sit up, his gaze fell on a nearby plant. "Isn't that the spirit tea plant?" he murmured.

Recognizing more familiar items—IBMz15, the uninterruptible power supply, the perpetual motion generator—he realized where he was: the Computer Room Space.

He'd never observed this space from this perspective before, having always used an omniscient, consciousness-based view.

He'd tried entering the space physically before, but his original body couldn't enter.

As his thoughts cleared, Li Shiming pieced together what had happened—his consciousness had transferred into the corpse puppet.

Examining the body confirmed it was indeed Baili Jinyan's corpse, with residual transformation fluid as evidence.

"Did the transformation succeed?" Li Shiming wondered, puzzled.

While Lifebound Corpses shared deep connections with their masters, this went beyond that—it felt like possessing another body entirely.

"Wait—" He noticed something amiss.

Unlike regular corpse puppets whose skin darkened, this body retained its original complexion. Moreover, he'd never heard of corpse puppets possessing spiritual energy vortices.

Corpse puppets excelled in physical strength, with yin-cold spiritual energy fused into their bodies rather than concentrated in vortices. Their entire form served as spiritual energy storage, granting formidable defense and power.

This puppet defied all records in the "Dark Underworld Corpse Refining Manual."

Though created using the Lifebound Corpse method from the manual, why such drastic differences?

Before solving this mystery, he needed to return to his original body.

The thought triggered an instant shift in perspective—back to his original form.

His heartbeat raced at this incredible phenomenon, struggling to remain calm.

Connecting to IBMz15, he reviewed events in the Computer Room Space during his sleep.

The computer's sensors—originally monitoring temperature, humidity, and light—had recorded visual data since he'd added that capability for his spirit plant cultivation.

With unlimited power, IBMz15 stored all surveillance footage.

Watching Baili Jinyan's convulsions and vital signs, Li Shiming gasped. Had Baili Jinyan truly awakened and moved freely in the Computer Room Space, his greatest secret would have been exposed.

The potential destruction of IBMz15 would eliminate his greatest advantage in this world.

A wave of belated fear washed over him, accompanied by self-reproach for his carelessness.

He also realized this world couldn't be fully explained by science—IBMz15's death detection had been fooled by cultivation world methods.

The footage showed the transformation process, but without internal monitoring, the exact mechanisms remained unclear.

Li Shiming saved the data in a dedicated folder. Though unsure if replicable, this discovery was immensely significant—he'd essentially created a doppelganger with late Qi Refinement stage cultivation.

After extensive experimentation, Li Shiming mastered switching between his original body and the doppelganger.

Testing the doppelganger's capabilities, he first examined its Lifebound Corpse traits.

Strength was undeniable—a light squeeze produced an airburst in its palm.

Transferring his consciousness into the doppelganger within the Computer Room Space, he discovered he could still project his awareness to observe the space omnisciently.

Scanning the body revealed its uniqueness—a ring of black material surrounding the spiritual energy vortex.

When his consciousness interacted with this material, it contracted inward, rapidly transforming the golden spiritual energy into black, yin-cold energy.

Simultaneously, the body turned bronze, becoming a Bronze Corpse—more powerful than his other one.

While this form boasted enhanced defense, its appearance was unmistakably undead.

Control remained perfect, allowing fluid movement that created afterimages from sheer speed.

Defense and strength doubled in this state, and he could still utilize spiritual energy—now corrosive, toxic yin-cold energy for ranged attacks.

(He refrained from spell experimentation in the precious Computer Room Space.)

This Bronze Corpse form represented an enhanced state of the doppelganger.

Returning the black material to its original position restored the golden spiritual energy vortex, making the body appear normal again.

Unfortunately, without Baili Jinyan's cultivation techniques, he couldn't practice with the doppelganger, though it otherwise functioned like a regular cultivator.

The doppelganger offered three control methods:
1. Full consciousness transfer (leaving the original body vulnerable)
2. Partial consciousness control (similar to regular corpse puppets)
3. Simple command execution (limited to basic melee attacks)

Currently, the doppelganger's spirit—the Lifebound Corpse spirit—lacked the intelligence for complex techniques.

Li Shiming set aside these concerns, realizing the doppelganger must remain hidden in the Computer Room Space for now.

He resolved to maintain normal appearances, knowing few would suspect him of killing Baili Jinyan anyway.

Returning to his cave dwelling, he began preparing low-level formation materials—intending to conceal surveillance equipment within arrays.

Unlike the mortal world, cultivators' sharp eyes would easily spot unusual objects like cameras without concealment.

Selecting five blank formation flags, he dipped a talisman brush into formation-specific ink and began drawing.

Though resembling talismans, formation patterns fundamentally differed—they represented array effects rather than spell sequences.

Talismans required spell intent; formation flags only needed spiritual energy coordination.

(These were beginner-level components for practice.)

The five flags bore patterns representing metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—completing the preliminary preparations.
