# Chapter 10: Dharma Seals and Soft Living

Once cultivation begins, time passes in the blink of an eye.

In what seemed like a mere moment, fourteen days had already gone by.

As the last rays of twilight vanished beyond the horizon of the Nine Rivers Great Marsh, Welcome Island was once again shrouded in darkness.

Within a quiet chamber, a young man in a green Daoist robe with five emerald-green leaf patterns embroidered on his sleeves sat cross-legged with his eyes tightly closed.

In his hands was a thin, translucent piece of green jade paper.

However, the luster of the jade paper had dimmed to its limit, as if it might vanish at any moment. Its already paper-thin surface had become even more fragile, seemingly on the verge of turning to dust.

The young man's eyes remained shut, but his furrowed brow revealed his immersion in a difficult struggle.

Tiny green dots of light emerged from his exposed skin, resembling invisible roots that continuously circulated, desperately absorbing the "nutrients" from the world around him.

Yet these roots were dim and unsteady, as if they might dissipate at any moment.

The young man's frown deepened, and a shadow of darkness seemed to flicker across his brow.

But with his resilient nature, he endured, adjusting his breathing and focusing his mind to merge completely with the process.

"Boom!"

Something seemed to break through a heavy barrier, bursting forth suddenly.

The sound was actually very faint, like a seed breaking through the soil, but for Gu Yuan, who had poured all his concentration into it, it was like thunder from a clear sky—deafening and startling.

The world suddenly brightened as spiritual energy surged like a tide from all directions toward his dantian.

Gu Yuan felt as though he had transformed into a "sapling," with every inch of his skin and every strand of hair turning into roots, ceaselessly drawing in the spiritual energy of the world.

"Whoosh!"

This was the first time Gu Yuan had experienced such smooth and effortless cultivation. In a daze, he seemed to hear the sound of spiritual energy rushing toward him like a tidal wave.

If the Wooden Ten Thousand Arts was like a small trickle of water, the Evergreen Diagram was like adding a water pump—operating at full power.

"Whoosh!"

Spiritual energy flowed like water, and Gu Yuan's skin, bones, and even his hair shimmered with light as he absorbed the endless stream of energy from the world.

The spiritual energy gathered in his dantian, then condensed into magic power, flowing like a gentle stream through his meridians and limbs, nourishing his body and strengthening his spirit.

"Finally, success!"

Feeling the continuous growth of his magic power, Gu Yuan couldn't help but open his eyes and exhale deeply.

For the past fourteen days, Gu Yuan had been meditating on the true diagram, striving to comprehend the cultivation method hidden within.

Unfortunately, though his will was strong, his innate talent was only average.

Through half meditation and half deduction, he had spent a full fourteen days to barely grasp the true diagram and learn its secrets.

At that moment, the jade paper in Gu Yuan's hand silently crumbled into dust, vanishing within the chamber.

Watching the green jade paper disappear, Gu Yuan murmured to himself:

"According to Senior Brother Qiu, those with superior talent can comprehend it in just three days. Even those of average ability only need ten days. Yet I took a full fourteen—almost the level of an outer disciple. The gap is huge!"

This cultivation session had been a test for Gu Yuan, a way to measure the difference between himself and the disciples of Green Peak Dao Academy.

But now it seemed there was still a significant gap between him and the inner disciples, let alone the true disciples under the Golden Core masters.

His talent and comprehension were barely enough to meet the threshold for the inner academy, no different from an outer disciple.

Thinking this, Gu Yuan couldn't help but shake his head with a bitter smile.

With such mediocre talent, unless something extraordinary happened, he would inevitably fade into obscurity.

"But fortunately, I still have the stone bottle..."

Gu Yuan rubbed his palm, feeling the nearly full stone bottle, and sighed in relief.

This would be his greatest reliance.

"With poor talent, I can only rely on opportunities to change my fate. Thankfully, in this world, besides Dharma Seals, there are also Body Seals and Life Seals. As long as I have enough opportunities, defying fate isn't impossible..."

Gu Yuan focused on the four uniquely shaped Dharma Seals within his body, each naturally inscribed with ancient script, and felt a stirring in his heart.

"Buzz!"

As his magic power circulated, the four Dharma Seals emerged from his body, hovering around him.

The first seal on the left was earthen yellow, engraved with a miniature black tortoise. Below it were ancient script and Dao patterns, merging into a unique design that continuously rotated.

The spiritual energy of the world seemed to stir in response to this strange inscription.

"Black Tortoise Seal!"

Cultivation in this world was somewhat peculiar.

It was a world where the Dao and magic were separate.

Practitioners meditated on true diagrams and studied cultivation methods to absorb spiritual energy and condense magic power.

Magic power inherently possessed strength—it could form walls, move mountains and rivers, or condense into needles. Like formless clay, it could be shaped in countless ways to achieve extraordinary feats.

The longevity of cultivators was also due to the power of magic.

However, magic power alone could not easily interact with the spiritual energy of the world or invoke the laws of the Dao to achieve earth-shattering effects.

It was as though magic power and the world were separated by a barrier, unable to merge.

But the ancient sages, with their boundless wisdom, extracted the essence from all things in the world, fused it with the Dao's rhythm, and ultimately deduced the "Dharma Seals."

Dharma Seals were crafted by refining objects with innate "Dao patterns," condensing these patterns onto a "seal" using specific methods, then absorbing them into the body to become part of the cultivator.

This was the essence of Dharma Seals.

With a Dharma Seal, a cultivator's magic power could communicate with the world, forming spells and invoking the Dao's laws to achieve devastating effects.

For example, Gu Yuan's "Black Tortoise Seal" was refined using the shell of a thirty-year-old black tortoise as the main material.

The black tortoise's shell was a natural object imbued with Dao patterns.

But refining a Dharma Seal was no simple task. Though the tortoise shell had innate Dao patterns, it couldn't directly cast spells or be used by a cultivator.

It had to be melted down with supplementary materials and spiritual fire, then reshaped according to the cultivator's intent to redraw the Dao patterns before it could form a seal.

Once a seal was completed, it became like a seed within the cultivator's body. As long as their magic power endured, they could continuously activate the seal to achieve protective or offensive effects.

This world was vast and boundless, nurturing countless treasures and Dao patterns.

Through the exploration of countless sages and prodigies, other seals such as Sword Seals, Body Seals, and Life Seals were also developed.

Among them, Body Seals were particularly mysterious—they could alter a cultivator's innate talent and physique.

Back in the Green Wood Sect, Gu Yuan had heard of a Body Seal called the Seven Treasures Body Seal. This seal refined seven rare treasures of the world. Once completed, the cultivator's body would gain seven additional dantians, allowing them to cultivate seven methods simultaneously without interference, yet still merge into one. Their magic power would grow by leaps and bounds daily—truly a wondrous technique.

It was enough to change anyone's aptitude.

Beyond that, it was said the founder of the Green Wood Sect had once cultivated a Wood Theft Seal.

With this seal, one no longer needed to cultivate conventionally. By simply sitting beneath a spiritual tree over a thousand years old, they could automatically absorb its wood spirit energy, enhancing their cultivation and extending their lifespan.

However, rumors suggested this seal had drawbacks, and the Green Wood Sect's founder had disappeared, leaving behind only fragmented legends.

Regardless, this world was filled with wondrous methods. With enough opportunities, changing one's fate was possible.

"Right now, I only have four Dharma Seals—Black Tortoise Seal, Flame Serpent Seal, Moonchaser Seal, and Ice Chain Seal—and they're all low-grade seals from the Green Wood Sect. I still have a long way to go to catch up to the disciples of Green Peak Dao Academy..."

Looking at the four seals floating around him, Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh again.

Though he had joined the Dao Academy, his strength hadn't improved much, leaving him uneasy.

He knew that his karmic debt with the Golden Core master had been settled. Once this news spread, he would undoubtedly face many trials.

The Dao Academy was its own world.

Without backing and with mediocre talent, it would be difficult to establish himself.

"I wonder... can the stone liquid help me secure a comfortable life?"

Suddenly, the thought from earlier resurfaced in Gu Yuan's mind.
