# Chapter 178: A Place Where Spiritual Energy Converges

Since his master had gone out to visit friends, Xu Yunfan naturally did not ask further questions. Although Zhan Yan was going to the Divine Weapon Ridge, his whereabouts were unknown. Moreover, a martial artist of the Blood Transformation Realm, a renowned figure in the Jianghu, would hardly worry about threats to his life.

Leaving the Tiangong City, Xu Yunfan looked up at the mountain where he had practiced the朝阳一气功 (Sunrise Primordial Qi Technique) yesterday. He hesitated for a moment, then checked the sky.

There was still some time before the rising sun and the purple mist of the morning glow would appear.

Now that his mining skills had reached perfection, the "Dragon Seeking and Vein Discerning" effect within his memory allowed him to quickly determine that the spiritual energy on the mountain ridge from yesterday was not particularly abundant.

With the Empress raising the Primordial Spirit Qi from the earth's veins, it was natural that places where various mountain trends converged would have a rather dense presence of Primordial Spirit Qi.

The Pure Yang Primordial Qi Technique could only utilize the purple mist of the morning glow to absorb the Primordial Spirit Qi between heaven and earth. Therefore, he needed to carefully choose a location.

He no longer hesitated. With a push of his foot arch, soil and stones flew up beneath his feet, and he shot out like an arrow released from a bow.

Half a cup of tea's time later.

The mountains of Shu Province were rugged and steep, with peaks pointing like swords to the heavens. Thirty miles east of the Tiangong Peak, Xu Yunfan's five fingers brushed across a section of green rock. The granular sensation transmitted to his fingertips made his brow twitch.

This was the "Thousand Layer Cake" rock formation recorded in his memories after his mining skills reached perfection: five layers of sandstone夹着 (interlayered with) iron concretions, reflecting a ochre-red color in the morning light.

He tapped the rock wall with his fingers, producing a sound like a muffled drum. There must be a cavity within the mountain, likely a gourd-shaped cave formed by water erosion, which was easiest for gathering the energy of the earth's veins.

A hundred zhang deep, the earth's veins shifted, naturally gathering a considerable amount of Primordial Spirit Qi within, which then slowly diffused into the heavens and earth. Otherwise, how could there be talk of blessed immortal mountains?

The Broken Dragon Cliff on the northern slope of the Tiangong Peak stood before him. Xu Yunfan crushed a few granules of hematite slag under his boot.

The morning sun cast the mountain's shadow onto the opposite solitary peak. The terrain resembled a lying ox drinking water, which brought a look of delight to his face.

Three basalt rocks at the ox's head were arranged in a triangular pattern, corresponding exactly to the "Three Talismans Suppressing Qi" formation in Feng Shui techniques.

A faint smell of sulfur accompanied the mountain wind, a sign of geothermal heat rising. It was certain that a considerable amount of Primordial Spirit Qi would manifest here.

"What a fine treasure land for gathering wind and storing energy."

He untied the oxhide water pouch at his waist and took a mouthful of the strong liquor from the Tiangong Cave's medicine hall. An immediate warmth spread through his stomach. As the medicine's effects were digested along with the alcohol, his pores opened with the potency of the drink.

The Pure Yang Primordial Qi Technique focused on using blood and Qi to stir the yang energy of heaven and earth. At this moment, the sun was about to rise but had not yet appeared, making it the perfect time to gather the first light of dawn.

Bending his legs slightly to generate force, his ten fingers, like iron hooks, dug into the rock crevices. The places where his fingers pressed down silently smoothed out the roughness, leaving behind only faint, distinct finger marks.

Using both hands and feet, he climbed like a nimble ape, and in the span of a breath, he ascended the thirty-zhang vertical cliff.

"Keeper of the Lamp, someone's gone up."

A voice suddenly came from a corner at the bottom of the cliff, tinged with some anxiety.

"The direction is wrong; they probably aren't here to find something."

A slightly calmer voice came from a nearby thicket.

"The Eagle Beak Rock three zhang to the west! He went up there. We checked before; the mountaintop is barren, nothing there. Maybe he's just here for the scenery."

A pockmarked man lying in the thicket lowered his voice. The mountain-piercing claw in his hand was already taut on its trigger spring. "The reflection from his sleeve... he must be hiding a sleeve arrow! Only disciples from the recently relocated Tiangong Cave would carry such mechanical contraptions... With such agile movements, he's likely a tough one. And this place is too close to the Tiangong Cave. If that person sends a signal, those birdmen flying around in the sky from Tiangong Cave would be here in an instant."

The man called "Keeper of the Lamp," wrapped in brush and weeds, was measuring the rock strata with a copper tobacco pipe. Hearing this, he pulled a magnet out of his怀里 (bosom). The iron filings clinging to the surface of the magnet suddenly turned towards the southeast, the direction Xu Yunfan had climbed the cliff.

"What's there to panic about?"

He tapped the leather pouch at his feet with his tobacco stem, which contained prepared "Soul Confusing Powder." "If he were really coming for us, he would have followed the sulfur markers up. We of the Northern Mang Mountain haven't been around for all these years for nothing."

Thirty zhang high, Xu Yunfan suddenly changed direction.

The path that should have gone straight up suddenly turned northeast. His figure drifted like a willow catkin. Wherever his ten fingers passed, a few clusters of Silver Silk Grass used to mark ore veins were unintentionally crushed.

It wasn't that he suddenly had a brain freeze and changed direction; it was because the path ahead was about to become a one-hundred-and-twenty-degree angle.

Keeper of the Lamp squinted at the shadow swaying in the morning light and suddenly sneered, "Heh... this guy's movements are quite mixed. He's using the Flying Leg of the Qingcheng Sect but wants to imitate the Eight Forging Step of the Tiangong Cave... Look at his right shoulder."

The pockmarked man raised a single-eyed telescope, not looking directly but using the peripheral vision method of the Northern Mang Mountain to peek. These martial artists had very sharp six senses.

He just saw the sleeve on Xu Yunfan's right arm suddenly stretch tight as his muscles bulged.

"That's it!"

He slapped his thigh and whispered, "Qingcheng lightness technique focuses on channeling Qi to the Yongquan acupoint, but this guy is forcibly lifting his body with external hard skills. He's probably a young master from some noble family who ran away."

A few cold crows suddenly startled from the top of the cliff. Keeper of the Lamp's ears twitched; he heard Xu Yunfan step on and crush half of a weathered shale.

He unhurriedly put away the magnet and tapped the tobacco pipe against the rock wall, creating three sparks. "The finger marks are deep, but the Qi is scattered and not condensed. He's a高手 (expert). But if he were a true master seeking dragon points and穴 (caves), he wouldn't be walking the Xun position during the time when swallows return to their nests. Alright, this person is likely the child of some elder or hall master from the Tiangong Cave, here to have some fun... The scenery up there is indeed excellent."

On the three wheelbarrows behind the thicket, the herb baskets used for camouflage trembled slightly.

Keeper of the Lamp used his tobacco stem to lift the top layer of Tianma (Gastrodia elata), revealing the inverted Luoyang Shovel underneath. The shovel head still had fresh mud, just brought out from the underground palace.

"Did you change all the red ropes and cloths we set at the Second Ridge yesterday? They mustn't touch the dew!" he suddenly asked.

"As you instructed, we re-buried six places along the Kan position at the third quarter of the Zi hour."

The pockmarked man took out an oil-paper package containing a few bronze nails engraved with patterns. "It's just that the nest of sparrows at the east end was really noisy. It took two handfuls of millet to quiet them down."

He exhaled, a glimmer of hope on his face. "That old witch in the Jade Capital City deserves to die, but she did do some good things, allowing us to get some treasures. I hope this trip yields something!"

The summit suddenly opened up. Xu Yunfan's nostrils flared. As the air he breathed turned in his lungs, he felt his spirit clear and his energy lift.

A great terrain!

The soil here contained cinnabar, and the rock strata sections showed spiral patterns of blood jade, the very terrain of "Red Dragon Spitting Pearl." The spot where he stood was the 'extreme point' where the Primordial Spirit Qi rose.

As the morning glow pierced the clouds, Xu Yunfan had already assumed the stance of the Pure Yang Primordial Qi Technique, the Pure Yang Stance.

His feet were like roots digging into the rock crevices, his spine like a great dragon connecting segment by segment.

This technique focused on the mind falling into a state of seeming emptiness yet not emptiness. As the purple mist of the morning glow rose from the east, he contemplated drawing it into his body through his mouth and nose.
