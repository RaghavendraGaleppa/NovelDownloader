# Chapter 198: The Recipe Master, Seeking the Hall

Inside the courtyard, it felt like spring, with lush vegetation everywhere.

Madam Wen wore a wide black robe embroidered with gold filigree. Her long, jet-black hair was unbound, flowing thickly down to her waist. Before her sat a Heaven and Earth Treasure Chest, its lid open.

Mist swirled within, and a golden-scaled fish swam freely through the void.

Madam Wen said, "Among the Heaven, Earth, and Man, the item of the Xuanhuang color is called Ren Huang (Human Yellow). It can also be called Human Xuan, Human Essence, or Human Treasure."

"There are a total of one hundred and eighty types."

"How to consume them has its own specific rules."

"I won't say much else, let's just talk about this golden-scaled fish."

She waved her hand casually, and the golden-scaled fish leaped out of the box, flopping in her palm.

"There are four recipes related to it. Of course, there aren't just four, but I only know four."

"I'll tell you one, listen carefully."

"Recipe: Golden Light Soup. There are three ingredients to consume. First, [Pond Golden Fish] Ren Huang, one hundred and eight. Second, [Yellow Nine Ginseng] Ren Huang, ninety-nine. Third, [Morning Yellow Dew] Ren Huang, one hundred and seventy-two."

"Drink the golden fish tail in the morning, and your feet must not touch the ground. Eat ginseng fibers in the summer, and you must not touch water for seven days. Absorb the yellow dew at night, and you must not see the moon. The order of consumption and how to swallow them must not be off by a fraction."

"If everything goes smoothly, you will comprehend the Dao of Arts · Golden Light."

"Today, I grant you a single scale and half a tail. Although the quantity is small, it contains the essence of the Art. Swallow it directly and sense it carefully."

She plucked a scale and cut off half a tail.

Li Xian thanked her and swallowed the scale and half-tail. He immediately felt a cool sensation throughout his body, and the Heaven and Earth Essence was incredibly rich. It didn't leak out in the slightest, accumulating in his abdomen.

Over five hundred strands...

After consumption and refinement, it transformed into seven hundred and fifty strands. Each strand of Heaven and Earth Essence mixed with a mysterious trace of the Art's intent.

Li Xian understood: "So... I need to digest this Heaven and Earth Essence, and then naturally comprehend the Art's intent within it."

Madam Wen said, "Go and comprehend it yourself. Practice your martial arts diligently to digest the essence. You are currently the County Martial Lieutenant. Hmm... that's not bad. Find some Red List ferocious men to fight, which can also help digest the essence. While practicing hard, go out and experience the world more." She waved her sleeve gently, and a soft, gentle force blew Li Xian out of the room.

In the courtyard.

Li Xian closed his eyes and savored the感悟. The essence was pure, and the Art's intent was unique...

"Given my current strength, hoping to obtain a Treasure Art is no different than a fool's dream. But this Human Yellow level treasure, the process of harvesting and eating it is truly unique."

"Among the Heaven and Earth Essences, there are also differences."

[Food Essence]
[Proficiency: 62/100]

Food Essence had undergone its sixth transformation.

Li Xian felt his entire body become smooth and comfortable. There were many changes, and he couldn't probe them all clearly. He practiced several sets of martial arts before feeling slightly satisfied.

"Consuming the golden fish, the Heaven and Earth Essence is so rich. Storing it in the body, digestion takes time. During this period, I don't need to eat any more [Treasure Essences]."

In the eleventh month, heavy snow fell in Qingning.

On the second day after returning to the manor, it was the period for "reporting accounts."

Over these few days, the stewards of the horse ranch, the mulberry garden maids, and the village heads... would come to the manor one after another to report on the year's market conditions, business status, and so on.

This matter was handled by Uncle Xiang, but the Madam ordered Li Xian to observe and learn.

Uncle Xiang smiled and said, "Li Xian, the Madam values you highly now. Don't let her down."

"I will." Li Xian smiled.

Uncle Xiang was experienced and savvy. With just a listen, he could hear the flaws in the accounts. Who was shirking, who was working diligently, who was hardworking. He praised the active and punished the lazy.

His style of operation was quite worth learning.

Li Xian came into contact with the manor's business and only then learned that the famous industries in the prefecture city—[Silkworm Cloud Tower], [Precious Fragrance Tower], [Mellow Dream Kiln]...—were actually all under the Madam's ownership.

After three busy days of reviewing accounts and verifying entries... it was extremely tedious. Some could endure the hardship of martial practice but found it difficult to tolerate these trivial administrative tasks.

Li Xian had a studious nature and thought this was a rare opportunity to learn a great deal about management. So he never complained and silently took notes.

The Madam heard Uncle Xiang's feedback and saw that Li Xian was eager to learn about management. She was quite pleased, seeing that Li Xian's heart was in the manor.

She grew even fonder of him.

She thought again: "I have obtained the golden fish, and now I need to properly process it. The Silkworm Clothes and Jade-Carving Skill and the manor's affairs must be put aside for now. During this period, let him run free and have some fun."

"When necessary, I will call him back to the manor."

She didn't oppose Li Xian venturing out, so the position of "Martial Lieutenant" remained. She called Li Xian over and granted him a few days of leave. All the labor affairs of the manor were left to Uncle Xiang.

Uncle Xiang sighed: "Madam, oh Madam, you're afraid these labor affairs will bother your young master. So you want this old servant to do it all."

He was, after all, a peak Second Realm martial artist. Yet he spent his days calculating on an abacus, counting in and out. Haggling over money for guards, servants, and maids. It was a bit of a waste of talent, a bit of a squandering of time.

Li Xian, enjoying his vacation, felt an unbearable itch. He rode a fine horse and, after more than a month, returned to his hometown.

The three halls and two sects, the county magistrate, and the various clans... all came out to greet him. Li Xian asked and found out it was because the "Hero List" had been updated.

The wicked尉 Li Xian had entered the top three, and his reputation was suddenly immense, with much discussion.

Li Xian didn't care: "What's the point of caring about such false fame?" He put it aside and returned to the Martial Lieutenant's Hall.

The runners in the hall all wore ferocious ghost masks and held fine steel long knives. Their movements were uniform and sharp, their killing intent surging. Luo Xia shouted: "One!" The runners instantly drew their knives and slashed downward.

Li Xian was stunned and watched silently for a good while.

Luo Xia caught a glimpse of Li Xian from the corner of her eye and shouted: "Stop!" The runners stopped their training. Luo Xia walked over to Li Xian and said: "You're back? I heard you've made quite a name for yourself."

Li Xian smiled: "I've caused quite a bit of trouble, that's for sure. As for a name... it's just those people in the prefecture city, saying whatever they want."

"That's true." Luo Xia said: "While you were away, I gave the Martial Lieutenant's Hall a complete overhaul. These little fellows are now all fine soldiers, fierce soldiers."

"If a situation arises in the future, pointing where to kill, destroying with ease, how powerful that would be."

Li Xian laughed and scolded: "You, this rebel."

Luo Xia threw a grand banquet and ate and drank freely with Li Xian. The trip to the prefecture city had been full of dangers. The fact that he returned safely was already cause for celebration.

At the banquet, everyone clinked glasses, their joy filling the air. They celebrated Li Xian's triumphant return. The runners drank to their hearts' content, relaxing their minds, and asked about the grand sights of the prefecture city and the strange encounters along the way.

Li Xian told them one by one: how treacherous the noble clans were, how exotic the delicacies were, and how exciting the struggles between the prodigies were. However, he did not mention the [Golden Fish] matter, for fear that if the runners knew, it might bring disaster.

He thought to himself with emotion: "Who would have thought that I, Li Xian, could also have so many brothers."

They drank heartily.

And so, everything remained as before.

One spring, one winter.

One day, when Li Xian had some free time, he suddenly visited "Black River Village." The village head, Uncle Fu, had died in the seventh month, passing away peacefully in his sleep. The new village head was an old man with the surname Zhou.

He recognized Li Xian and called for the villagers to greet him.

Black River Village, after a year of development, had an increasing population. Because of the "Old Farmer Killing Bandits Formation," bandits from the Mountain Wind Stronghold and others dared not enter the village. Therefore, villagers from the surrounding areas moved into Black River Village, growing stronger day by day, and the villagers were united.

Li Xian took a short stroll and came to the Black Water River. The Black Water Gang had been destroyed, and now the "Red Water Gang" ruled, becoming another local tyrant.

The "human sails" woven by the Black Water Gang still stood by the river, but the people inside had all died, turning into dry bones. The Red Water Gang used this to display the crimes of the Black Water Gang.

Li Xian looked at the river and sighed.

"Things have changed, people are not what they were."

"In this past year, so much has changed."

"My younger brother is on a study tour and has his own aspirations. I once only sought to fill my stomach and not be bullied. Now, I have more than enough to eat and have quite a reputation in Qingning County. Those who can bully me... are perhaps only the Madam and a few others."

"My goal is to become stronger, to surpass the Madam, to be free and unfettered. But how difficult it is. But why think so much? Heaven rewards the diligent, and man achieves his goals! As long as I don't die, I will keep moving forward!"

Li Xian's ambition was stirred. He turned back home and practiced diligently.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +2]

Li Xian focused on practicing the Thunderfinger Skill and the Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword.

The Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword reached perfection. His body became scorching hot like fire, and flames burst from his shoulders.

[Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword · Second Layer]
[Proficiency: 15/50000 (Perfection)]
[Description: You have tempered your body with Yang fire. Your physique is pure, your body like a furnace, unafraid of the cold. Your Yang energy is abundant, making you easily favored. Unfortunately, there is a flaw in the Yin-Yang balance, so the sword art ultimately has a shortcoming. You have comprehended "Yang Extreme Sword Light" and "Life-Protecting Yang Qi".]

Li Xian already had the "Yang Origin Sword Qi" as his trump card. When executing the Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword moves, he accumulated internal energy and forcefully unleashed a sword qi several zhang long.

"Yang Extreme Sword Light" is similar to Yang Origin Sword Qi but not the same. When Li Xian施展 the Yang Extreme Sword Light, as he dances with the sword, the blade carries a trail of light, which can be used for both attack and defense, with infinite妙用. It contains immense killing power.

Li Xian sensed his progress and felt exhilarated: "Superior sword arts are truly extraordinary. I now have an additional strand of Life-Protecting Yang Qi, and another trump card."

The Qi Lake underwent another qualitative change, needing to accumulate a "seventy-two zhang" lake body. Such a quantity of Qi might not be within the reach of a Second Realm martial artist.

With the Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword's second layer perfected, Li Xian's Qi Lake body suddenly increased by several zhang. Nearly forty zhang of Qi Lake body, surging and turbulent. If used with all his strength, its power would be formidable.

"The road is long, but with every step, I will eventually arrive!"

From then on.

Li Xian's progress was rapid. With no trivial matters to disturb him, he practiced during the day and rested at night. When he had free time, he would drink and have fun with his brothers and friends.

His days were carefree.

With the help of the Thunderstone, the Thunderfinger Skill progressed quickly, successfully reaching the [Peak Mastery] level.

The first layer of the Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword was nearing the state of "Peak Mastery."

"Other martial arts, the Madam wouldn't see through. But the Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword is a combined sword technique. If this sword art reaches Peak Mastery, the Madam will surely be suspicious."

So he temporarily put aside the "Waning Sun and Decaying Blood Sword · First Layer" and turned to practice the second layer. Not rushing, he感悟 the changes in the sword moves, exploring infinite possibilities.

[Proficiency +2]
[Proficiency +3]

Silently striving, climbing towards the peak.

In mid to late November.

Dark clouds gathered over Qingning County. After憋了several days, a strange wind and snow began to blow, covering the sky and the sun, howling across the heavens. Every household in the county closed their doors, and the towers shut their gates.

They endured the ravages of the wind and snow.

Inside the Martial Lieutenant's Hall.

In the outer hall's main hall, two stoves were set up, one east and one west. The soup was boiling, stewed with tiger bones, pig bones, bear bones, deer bones, and sheep bones. Tiger whip, pig whip, bear whip, deer whip, and sheep whip.

A fresh Yang soup of five bones and five whips. On the table were laid out meat slices, fresh vegetables, strong liquor... and many other ingredients.

Dozens of runners, Zhang Hou, Wang Wu... and the others, sat around the stoves,涮肉 (swirling meat in the pot), eating vegetables, and drinking. The cold wind whistled, but it couldn't suppress their hot blood.

Wang Wu said: "Sir, the charcoal fire is so strong. In this kind of snowy weather, it can still boil the soup so vigorously."

Luo Xia scolded: "Of course it can. It's a treasure your Sir brought out from the manor. You bunch of unappreciative things, I'm telling you, what's in the pot bottom is much more expensive than what's on top."

"Hahaha, everyone, eat and drink to your heart's content. Don't think too much about it." Li Xian said in a clear, loud voice. The howling wind and snow covered some of the sound, but it couldn't hide the young man's ambition.

"You... I really give up!" Luo Xia gave a thumbs-up. In such wind and snow, in such weather, Li Xian insisted on organizing this gathering, inviting everyone to eat in the snow.

He didn't know the immensity of heaven and earth, and he didn't fear the freezing cold. Beyond the ordinary, full of spirit. Unconventional and unpredictable, yet with a heart full of hot blood.

Luo Xia smiled helplessly, thinking of the past years. Although she was decisive in killing, she had never seen anyone so vivid and striking. She shook her head and smiled: "Come, drink with me! The one who gets drunk gets thrown into the pot to be stewed."

"Big Sister... we won't drink with you. You need Sir to handle you." Zhang Hou laughed, "Hahaha."

"You're asking for it!" Luo Xia, embarrassed and angry, rolled up her sleeves as if to hit him.

Zhang Hou dodged and begged for mercy, and everyone laughed heartily. They found joy here, asking for nothing more.

Li Xian suddenly froze and stood up, shouting: "Madam?"

Luo Xia's smile instantly vanished. The runners immediately fell silent, all feeling constrained. Outside the hall door, the Madam's skirt was fluttering, and she had actually come to the Martial Lieutenant's Hall!
