# Chapter 24: An Unexpected Turn of Events

Zheng Xinghan forced an unnatural smile and didn't argue further. 

Nangong Yue came from a wealthy family with considerable influence in the western district. Moreover, he possessed remarkable martial talent and enjoyed Zuo Le's high regard. Zheng Xinghan saw no reason to offend him over such trivial matters.

Seeing Zheng Xinghan back down, Nangong Yue's expression softened. Just as he prepared to resume training, he noticed Qin Ziling striding purposefully toward them, causing his face to darken again.

Zheng Xinghan also saw Qin Ziling approaching and assumed he'd overheard Nangong Yue's disparaging remarks. Worried about a confrontation, he quickly intercepted Qin Ziling with a meaningful glance. "Ziling, what brings you here?"

"Yes, Senior Brother Zheng, I need your help with something," Qin Ziling replied, pointedly ignoring Nangong Yue behind Zheng Xinghan.

"Oh? What is it?" Zheng Xinghan asked curiously.

"I'd like to borrow a handcart."

At thirty-two, Zheng Xinghan had reached the Iron Skin level—a respectable achievement in Fangshuo City—but having passed his physical prime, he had no hope of advancing further. He primarily assisted Zuo Le with managing the martial school's daily affairs.

"That's simple enough. Take one from the backyard and remember to return it," Zheng Xinghan said with a wave.

"Thank you, Senior Brother. There's one more thing—" Qin Ziling produced two Yixue Pills from his pocket. "I bought these from Yiyuan Hall this morning but need money urgently. Would you consider purchasing them for one tael and eight mace?"

Zheng Xinghan's eyes widened as he connected the dots. "You need the cart and money... surely you don't mean—"

Qin Ziling nodded silently.

Even with the confirmation, Zheng Xinghan struggled to believe it. After a long pause, he whispered, "Do you understand how severe Liu Xiaoqiang's injuries are? Do you realize your own financial situation?"

"I know. But Liu Xiaoqiang is my friend. I can't abandon him," Qin Ziling stated firmly.

Zheng Xinghan stared at him, at a loss for words.

"Ziling, come here!" Zuo Le's voice called from beneath the shade tree.

"Please excuse me, Senior Brother." Qin Ziling quickly stored the pills and approached Zuo Le, bowing slightly. "Master."

Zuo Le studied Qin Ziling intently, as if seeing him for the first time. After a prolonged silence, he retrieved a five-tael silver ingot from his waist pouch. "Keep your pills. Take this instead."

"Master?" Qin Ziling looked up in surprise.

"Go on," Zuo Le said, waving him off before reclining in his rattan chair and closing his eyes.

Instead of leaving, Qin Ziling hesitated. "Master, with your vast knowledge... is there any medicine that can fully heal broken bones and tendons?"

Zuo Le slowly opened his eyes. "Don't get your hopes up. Such medicines exist, but they're prohibitively expensive."

"I may not afford it now, but that could change. Please enlighten me."

"The Tianji Bone-Mending Ointment can fully restore broken bones and tendons within a year of injury. It's a proprietary formula of the Xiao family—one of Fangshuo's five great clans—exclusively sold at their Anchen Hall. Each application costs five hundred taels. Liu Xiaoqiang would need three."

"Thank you, Master." Qin Ziling bowed calmly before taking his leave. After informing Zheng Xinghan, he retrieved the handcart from the backyard.

"What a loyal man. Pity reality seldom rewards such virtues," Zuo Le sighed, watching Qin Ziling disappear before closing his eyes again.

News of Qin Ziling's decision spread through the training grounds like wildfire. Disciples abandoned their practice to cluster in hushed groups.

"Qin Ziling's actually going to care for Liu Xiaoqiang? Is he insane?"

"Completely! His family's nearly bankrupt from his training. Those Yixue Pills were probably his last hope for a breakthrough before his three-year term ends. Without them, he's got no chance!"

"At least Master Zuo gave him silver. There's still a sliver of hope."

"If he breaks through to Skin Membrane level, his education combined with martial skills could land him decent work. Otherwise, even with Master's help, supporting himself and Liu Xiaoqiang will be a struggle—they might starve!"

As the whispers continued, Qin Ziling pushed the cart across the grounds toward the gate. The disciples fell silent, watching him go with complex expressions.

However foolish they considered his choice, many secretly admired his loyalty and wished for such steadfast friendship in their own times of need.

After leaving, Qin Ziling first gathered Liu Xiaoqiang's belongings, then transported him to Yiyuan Hall for professional treatment and medicine. Half of Zuo Le's silver vanished in moments, prompting Qin Ziling to reflect wryly: whether in this world or another, ordinary people could ill afford to fall ill.
