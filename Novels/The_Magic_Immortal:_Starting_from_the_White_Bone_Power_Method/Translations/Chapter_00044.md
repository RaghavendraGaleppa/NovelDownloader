# Chapter 44: Fellow Daoist Wang, Save Me!

"Go!"

Nine silver needles shot toward Qu Lian in unison under Wang Chan's control—four piercing her chest and five her back. As they hissed, withered yellow restraining patterns spread toward her heart. 

The Corpse Ghost Worm, perhaps subdued by the Soul-Cleansing Demonic Lotus, lay dormant like a hibernating snake, offering no resistance to the Grave Yin energy. The process proceeded smoothly.

Half an hour later, the sealing was complete.

"Fellow Daoist Ning, your turn!" Wang Chan urged.

Qu Lian added gravely, "Fellow Daoist Ning, remember—once the refinement begins, you must not stop. If this worm awakens midway, the consequences will be dire."

"Understood!"

Ning Jingming stepped forward immediately. First, he affixed a Purple Lightning Armor Talisman to himself, then formed hand seals while chanting. Layers of golden light radiated from him—the [Righteous Sun Spell]. 

Unlike his previous treatment of Zhao Shanhe, this time Ning Jingming unleashed all fifty-four layers of the spell's restrictions at once. Clearly, he had mastered this technique to perfection. His talent and comprehension were formidable.

An hour later, Ning Jingming was drenched in sweat, his face weary. 

He gestured for Wang Chan to feed him a low-grade [Qi-Replenishing Pill] and gulped down two bottles of mid-grade [Origin-Nourishing Spirit Liquid] before continuing the spell. Layers of golden light surged toward the black threads entwined within the withered yellow restraints.

Under the golden radiance, the black threads writhed like earthworms, gradually fading at a visible pace. Meanwhile, as Ning Jingming refined each section, Qu Lian simultaneously directed the Soul-Cleansing Demonic Lotus to spray white light onto the processed threads, lulling the squirming black lines back into dormancy.

Thus, even without the withered yellow restraints, these dormant threads remained harmless. Despite this, Wang Chan kept the needles in place, reinforcing the seals with fresh infusions of spiritual energy every incense stick's time. 

Compared to Ning Jingming, his consumption was far lighter. Still, he drank low-grade Origin-Nourishing Spirit Liquid to maintain peak condition while vigilantly monitoring for any anomalies.

According to Ning Jingming's progress, the first round of refinement would conclude in another quarter-hour.

---

A quarter-hour later, Ning Jingming gasped for breath and rasped, "Fellow Daoist Wang, your assistance!"

Wang Chan swiftly formed seals, reactivating the restraining patterns. The withered yellow glow flared, sealing the partially refined Corpse Ghost Worm once more.

By now, the worm seemed on the verge of awakening after the refinement. Its countless threads writhed like hair in a raging current, horrifyingly poised to break free from the restraints at any moment.

Wang Chan's expression remained impassive as he channeled spiritual energy through the needles, his mind linked to their black-and-white restraining patterns. If the worm resorted to a desperate self-detonation, he would have no choice but to deploy the Profound Yin Sealing Technique.

"Suppress!"

At that moment, Qu Lian shouted. The previously ethereal Soul-Cleansing Demonic Lotus suddenly materialized into a solid form. The jade-like lotus exuded sacred purity—a single glance seemed capable of ensnaring one's very soul.

Wang Chan averted his gaze, panting slightly, and resolved inwardly to remedy his spiritual weaknesses soon. Otherwise, encountering someone like Qu Lian could lead to unconscious subjugation.

Bathed in white light, the violently struggling Corpse Ghost Worm grew sluggish again, cocooning itself as if sinking back into slumber.

"Fellow Daoist Wang may withdraw the needles now," Qu Lian said, relieved.

With a sweep of his sleeve, Wang Chan recalled all nine needles.

"I shall meditate briefly. Gentlemen, please retire to the courtyard for tea—ah!"

Qu Lian's words were cut short as the black cocoon abruptly swelled, ejecting countless gray-black threads. 

Though weaker than the original black threads—only mid-grade—these gray strands ignored Qu Lian's flesh, coalescing into a tangled mass that lunged at Ning Jingming.

Upon contact, the gray-black threads exploded into a web, ensnaring him. Simultaneously, Qu Lian spat blood and collapsed as if grievously wounded.

"Zzzzt—"

Thanks to the Purple Lightning Armor Talisman, arcs of lightning repelled the initial invasion. Yet, while some threads dissipated into smoke, the talisman couldn't eliminate them all.

Roaring, Ning Jingming unleashed the [Righteous Sun Spell], golden light radiating from his body to scorch the encroaching threads. Still unsatisfied, he slapped his storage bag, summoning a golden zither whose resonant waves lashed at the threads.

Yet even combined, the golden light and soundwaves only slowed the threads' advance.

"These aren't the Corpse Ghost Worm's clones but another worm it birthed!" Qu Lian gasped from the floor, pale with disbelief. "Unless sealed first, this worm is virtually indestructible!"

"Fellow Daoist Wang, save me!!!" Ning Jingming bellowed.

"Useless," Qu Lian said bitterly. "This worm secretly siphoned my energy to spawn. Though inferior to the parent, it's still mid-grade and free of the lotus's suppression. Even Fellow Daoist Wang's nine-needle seal—"

"Go!"

Before she finished, Wang Chan—now positioned at the chamber's exit—shouted. Five black needles shot forth, streaking toward Ning Jingming.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The needles dissolved into black mist mid-flight, enveloping the gray threads completely.

"Th-this is...!" Qu Lian's pupils shrank. "Profound Yin energy!"

"Seal!" Wang Chan commanded.

The black mist writhed grotesquely, emitting unsettling squelches as it contorted into shifting shapes yet never loosening its grip.

Half a tea-time later, the black mass detached from Ning Jingming, thudding to the floor like a solid ball. It bounced wildly as the trapped threads struggled within.

Dazed, Ning Jingming snapped to his senses. He shot Wang Chan a grateful look before glaring at the black mass as if it were his mortal enemy. 

With a cough, he spat golden essence blood that coalesced into an arcane sigil resembling a vertical eye. The sigil flashed into his forehead, splitting it open to reveal a golden third eye that shot a beam of void-like radiance—piercing effortlessly through the black mist.

For good measure, Ning Jingming spat two more mouthfuls, launching additional beams into the mist. Harrowing wails of countless tormented souls echoed before silence fell—the worm was no more.

---

The chamber was tomb-quiet.

"Cough..." Ning Jingming wiped blood from his lips, his once-black face now tinged gold. Straightening his robes, he bowed deeply to Wang Chan. "Brother Wang, no words can express my gratitude. Please accept this humble thanks!"

Wang Chan moved to stop him but found Ning Jingming's arm immovable as a mountain, forcing him to accept the bow.

Rising, Ning Jingming grinned. "I thought Brother Wang's nine low-grade [Minor Samsara Needles] were impressive enough. Who knew you also wield five mid-grade Profound Yin Needles infused with the legendary Profound Yin energy? Truly awe-inspiring..."

"Petty tricks unworthy of praise," Wang Chan demurred. "Brother Ning's innate divine ability is the true marvel—a mid-grade soul attack! This humble one is thoroughly impressed."

"Hah! At first glance, I knew Brother Wang was extraordinary. Yet today proves my eyes still failed to grasp your depths."

"Brother Ning flatters me. You are the unfathomable mountain I admire."

As the two exchanged increasingly effusive compliments, Qu Lian finally interjected wryly, "One refines the famed Profound Yin energy into needles; the other masters the innate [Mystic Golden Eye]. Had I known such prowess, my careful planning would've been unnecessary."

Wang Chan and Ning Jingming turned to her, their smiles fading. Had they not sworn oaths earlier—knowing Qu Lian hadn't schemed deliberately—they might have attacked her then and there.

Despite her disheveled state, Qu Lian's eyes still held a landscape of grace. Unfazed by their displeasure, she smiled warmly. "I intended to reward you after refining the worm, but my pettiness has become a joke."

"Fellow Daoist Qu exaggerates," they replied coolly.

"Fellow Daoist Ning, I grant your request unconditionally—no time limit." She turned to Wang Chan, sincerity in her gaze. "As for Fellow Daoist Wang, I'll impart the [Thunder Seal Curse] today, along with the [Water-Fire Escape Art]."

Wang Chan and Ning Jingming exchanged startled glances.

Qu Lian smiled faintly. "No ulterior motives. I merely wish to befriend you both."
