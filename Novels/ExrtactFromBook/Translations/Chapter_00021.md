# Chapter 21: Each Realm a World Apart

Within the Jade Sky Realm, the eleven supreme cultivation sects represent the pinnacle of this world's practitioners. 

To qualify as a supreme sect means their foundational cultivation methods can lead directly to the Great Dao of immortality. 

According to the "Records of Observations," the path to immortality is divided into five major realms.

The first realm is the Qi Absorption Stage, also called the Initiation Realm. 

Practitioners at this stage must draw external primordial qi into their bodies for cultivation. Regardless of what type of primordial qi it is, as long as one can channel it into their body, retain it within, and condense their own spiritual power, they can be considered to have achieved minor completion of the Absorption Stage. 

Among the hundred thousand Absorption Stage practitioners in Flesh-Cutting Market, ninety percent remain at this level.

Progressing further, practitioners must temper the quality of their spiritual power, first elevating their primordial qi to the second rank. 

Only then can they be considered Foundation Establishment cultivators of the first realm, beginning preparations for true advancement to the second realm. 

First realm cultivators condense spiritual power and temper their bodies, capable of dispelling illnesses and calamities, living to around 150 years—an increase of thirty years in lifespan.

The second realm is collectively called the Divine Abilities Realm, with each school having different methods of advancement. 

Artifact refining cultivators form a Great Dao Golden Core, condensing seeds of divine abilities, hence this realm is also called the Golden Core Realm. 

Demonic cultivators and bloodline practitioners condense bloodline power, transforming their bodies to cultivate bloodline abilities that dramatically increase combat strength. 

Second realm cultivators gain over two hundred years of lifespan, typically living between three to four hundred years. 

The number of second realm cultivators drops sharply—from Flesh-Cutting Market's hundred thousand first realm practitioners, fewer than one in ten reach Foundation Establishment. 

Of those, perhaps one in a hundred may eventually break through to the second realm. 

All who advance are invariably those with profound foundations and heaven's favor.

The third realm is the Nascent Soul Realm, also called the Divine Soul Realm. 

Practitioners at this stage condense their heart's divinity and spiritual power into a nascent soul, achieving tremendous growth in divine abilities and peerless combat power. 

Third realm cultivators enjoy a thousand-year lifespan, free from illness and calamity, comprehending heavenly fate above and yin-yang principles below. 

At this stage, practitioners become exceedingly rare—entire continents may go decades without a single third realm cultivator appearing.

The fourth realm is the Immortality Realm. Legends say cultivators at this stage can regenerate from a drop of blood, with primordial spirits that never perish, achieving true immortality. 

Such cultivators can only be found among supreme sects, having vanished from the mundane world.

The fifth realm is the Celestial Realm. The "Records of Observations" contains no records whatsoever about this stage—not even legends remain!

Five realms of immortality—each stage a world apart!

Each realm represents an insurmountable chasm. 

Countless beings struggle and toil upon this Great Dao of immortality, chasing after that elusive, intangible outcome!

For Han Yue at this moment, he had merely taken his first steps on the path of immortality—the road ahead remained long indeed.

After absorbing this new information, Han Yue set a preliminary goal: to join a supreme sect and seek the true Great Dao of immortality!

Though the eleven supreme sects each had their specialties, all were equally unreachable heights for the current Han Yue. 

His physical age was under twenty, leaving over a hundred years before reaching the lifespan limit of first realm Foundation Establishment. He still had ample time to refine his foundation and seek opportunities to formally enter a sect.

Imagining this vast world with its bizarre and fantastical realms, Han Yue felt his heart surge with excitement—he longed to travel everywhere and broaden his horizons!

He sensed his time in Flesh-Cutting Market wouldn't last much longer. Sooner or later, he would embark on a true journey to seek the Dao.

However, for the next few years, Han Yue would continue steadily accumulating resources here. 

Backed by the boundless outer territories, Flesh-Cutting Market offered endless demonic beast resources for Han Yue to efficiently harvest. 

The massive population of cultivators also created tremendous consumption potential, establishing highly specialized commercial channels like merchant houses. 

With this foundation, Han Yue's wealth accumulation far surpassed what peers could imagine—an advantage he intended to fully exploit!

He'd already decided: he wouldn't leave this environment until his storage space overflowed with rare treasures!

As time passed, Han Yue's money-making accelerated. He now earned several thousand merchant coins monthly, periodically acquiring major items. 

Thus Han Yue continued his disciplined routine—cultivating, hunting, selling meat, saving money!

His reputation in Flesh-Cutting Market grew ever larger. 

Rumors spread that Heavenly District's Courtyard Nine had gained a newly advanced second realm cultivator who hunted demonic beasts daily for pleasure, his achievements matching an entire street's worth of shops. 

Flesh-Cutting Market hadn't seen such a ferocious second realm cultivator in ages!

Of course, this owed much to promotional efforts by Courtyard Nine's cultivators led by Little Six!

This lifestyle continued until the year's final day. 

Han Yue didn't go out that day because Little Six had been waiting outside his door since dawn.

Today was the annual Second Realm Demonic Beast Meat Distribution Ceremony—Flesh-Cutting Market's year-end grand feast!

---

For Courtyard Nine, this day held extra significance. 

It was their beloved Little Six's latest attempt to break through to the Absorption Stage!

With four second realm demonic beasts, Little Six would have four chances to attempt qi absorption. 

Success would let him skip the qi tempering process entirely, directly advancing to first realm Foundation Establishment. 

At his age, that would signify profound foundations and exceptional talent—with greater growth potential ahead. 

Failure would force Little Six to revert to absorbing first realm beast qi for advancement. 

All his perseverance over the years would become sunk costs—precious time wasted!

Normally cheerful, Little Six was uncharacteristically tense today, expression grave and words sparse. 

He waited to depart with Han Yue, hoping his idol Brother Blade could lend him strength and luck!

Han Yue led Little Six to Courtyard Nine's banquet hall where Fang Yi had already gathered everyone. 

Seeing Little Six arrive, Fang Yi stepped forward to ruffle his hair reassuringly:

"Don't pressure yourself, Little Six. If it doesn't work this year, we can try again next. Your sister can afford to support you!"

Little Six shook his head. "No need to persuade me, Sister. My mind's made up!"

"If I fail this time, it means Yan Little Six lacks the talent! I won't keep burdening everyone!"

To each their own aspirations—Flesh-Cutting Market wasn't the place for sentimental attachments. 

Fang Yi didn't press further, simply leading the group out. 

The streets were already bustling as shops emptied, everyone converging on the central plaza. 

Second realm demonic beast meat represented unmissable cultivation resources for all—even Han Yue had never tasted it before. 

Soon they reached the plaza and joined the meat distribution queues.
