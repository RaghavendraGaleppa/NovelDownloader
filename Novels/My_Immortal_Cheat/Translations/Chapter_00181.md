# Chapter 181: Forbidden Treasure

“Escaped a calamity?”

A cold voice rang out, and everyone’s expressions stiffened. They suddenly remembered that they seemed to have forgotten something.

They instantly looked in the direction from which the voice came. In the spot where the lotus seed had been, a figure sat cross-legged, enveloped in golden mist. Golden lotuses bloomed in the void, and sounds of the Great Dao resonated in the sky, as if in praise.

Within the golden mist, a pair of black eyes slowly opened. The Saint-Devil’s true body had appeared. As his pupils grew brighter, they seemed capable of tearing through the outer starry sky.

The Saint-Devil made no move; he merely opened his eyes. Yet, from those seemingly calm black eyes, two golden beams of light shot forth.

*Whoosh!*

As he opened his eyes, those two golden beams were like two immortal swords unsheathed, cleaving through the void and rushing forth at extreme speed!

At this moment, the four Heavenly Kings felt their hearts pound, and they couldn’t help but tremble all over. Their scalps tingled, and they felt a chill.

“Dao Lord!”

The red-haired Heavenly King gritted his teeth and spat out these two words. They had thought the Saint-Devil had only gained an opportunity, but they never expected him to directly reach the Dao Lord realm. It was simply unbelievable.

Between heaven and earth, in the ethereal realm, it was as if a supreme being was looking down upon them, making them want to submit.

The two golden beams, unleashed by the Saint-Devil opening his eyes, pierced through the void and appeared before them. The momentum was terrifying, like immortal swords streaking across the sky, directly crashing down with fragments of the Great Dao.

“This is too much! What if he is a Dao Lord?!”

The red-haired Heavenly King let out a fierce shout, directly exhaling a blast of red flames. With a rumble, it surged forth like a vast ocean, colliding with the two golden beams pouring down from the high heavens.

Countless fragments of the Great Dao, utterly terrifying, obscured the sun and moon, tearing apart the sky, as if they would shatter the starry sky itself.

Yet, it was useless. The two golden beams passed through the sea of red flames, directly piercing through the red-haired Heavenly King’s forehead.

Two golden beams spanning the void, capable of killing even in this manner, were truly chilling.

*Whoosh!*

From where the Saint-Devil sat cross-legged, a figure moved!

Fragments of the void danced and wrapped around his body. Space held no meaning for him; it could not bind him.

A figure of unparalleled dominance. As he arrived, clouds in all directions exploded, the firmament cracked, and the starry sky dimmed, all suppressed by him!

The entire heaven and earth wailed and trembled slightly, as if being suppressed by him.

With a cold snort, he waved his hand, and the void shattered, then instantly incinerated, exploding like fireworks, magnificent in the outer reaches.

This sight was too terrifying. The void turned to ash at his mere flick of a finger. Violent explosions echoed from beyond the heavens, making everyone tremble.

The Saint-Devil was engulfed in chaotic energy, shrouded and wrapped, only a vague, terrifying figure could be dimly seen, with only a pair of indifferent eyes visible, soul-stirring.

“Who will pay for my Big Brother’s life?”

The Saint-Devil spoke calmly. The void seemed unable to bear his weight, crumbling. He had just broken through and couldn’t fully control his energy. He had truly only opened his eyes just now, without intentionally attacking, yet he possessed such power. He was truly incomparable to a Heavenly King.

“Your Big Brother self-destructed, it has nothing to do with us!”

Someone said, trembling. In the face of death, even if they were Heavenly Kings, they behaved no differently than mortals.

“Then who forced him to self-destruct?”

The Saint-Devil landed before them, like a great sun descending. They dared not look directly at him.

“He insisted on self-destructing himself! We tried to persuade him, but he wouldn’t listen!”

The Saint-Devil was silent for a moment. It seemed that was indeed the case.

“So, you’re blaming my Big Brother?”

The Saint-Devil took a step forward. *Boom!* It was as if an ancient divine mountain pressed down upon them, making them involuntarily kneel on the ground.

“No, no, not His Senior, not His Senior!”

That person shook their head like a rattle-drum.

“If you’re not blaming him, then you’re blaming yourselves. Go down and accompany him.”

The Saint-Devil didn’t want to argue with them anymore. Without giving them a chance to speak, he casually waved his hand. A gust of wind blew, and they had already turned into ashes, scattered by the wind.

He then stood still, closing his eyes again, sensing the changes within himself, and at the same time, waiting for Zhou Tian’s resurrection.

During this time, some people came to investigate due to the immense energy fluctuations, but upon seeing the Saint-Devil, they all left with greatly changed expressions.

Time passed quickly. When the blood-red disappeared and the world once again became sacred, a figure suddenly appeared in the sky.

The Saint-Devil opened his eyes, and a ripple spread out. That person instantly appeared before him, then skillfully took out a piece of clothing and put it on him.

“How do you feel?”

The person in front of the Saint-Devil spoke. It was Zhou Tian, who had just been resurrected.

“Better than ever before!”

The Saint-Devil spread his arms, his bright, long hair fluttering without wind, as if feeling the world.

“Are you a saint now, or a devil?”

Zhou Tian asked again.

“I am a saint and a devil, and even more, the Saint-Devil!”

The Saint-Devil spoke, unwavering in his conviction about his existence.

“Amazing, amazing.”

Zhou Tian casually humored him, then asked, “So you’re a Dao Lord now?”

“Correct.”

“Then, have you avenged your Big Brother?”

“…”

The Saint-Devil was silent for a moment before saying, “They’re all dead.”

“Hmm, that’s good then. I suffered a huge loss helping you.”

Zhou Tian said with a pained expression. He had used up a resurrection skill charge, and self-destruction didn’t even count as a death, because it was suicide.

*Sigh*… Self-destruction felt good for a moment, but afterwards… *emmm*.

“Thank you, Big Brother.”

The Saint-Devil suddenly bowed respectfully to Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian was suddenly bewildered. Had the personality fusion messed with his brain?

“The grace of achieving Dao must be repaid!”

The Saint-Devil was very solemn. For years, no one knew his pain. Now, this problem was resolved, and he had become a Dao Lord. Without Zhou Tian’s help, he probably wouldn’t have been able to obtain that lotus seed this time.

“Alright, alright, just remember Big Brother’s kindness.”

Zhou Tian waved his hand, feeling goosebumps all over. This Saint-Devil really had something wrong with his head. First, he threatened Zhou Tian with his life to make him come, and now he was being so mushy.

“What do we do now?”

Zhou Tian changed the subject. Two grown men expressing affection always felt a bit awkward.

“Go there!”

The Saint-Devil pointed a finger. That place was where the Dao light emanated, half the sky dyed in its colors, resplendent with flowing light. Heavenly dragons roared, phoenixes sang, and the ethereal forms of myriad spirits manifested.

“There? Do you know what’s there? Why is there such a huge phenomenon?”

Zhou Tian asked.

The Saint-Devil’s eyes were deep as he replied, “That lotus was formed from the projection of Wutian’s fundamental treasure. After fusing with the lotus seed it bore, I vaguely obtained some information.”

“There are two true exotic treasures in this place. One is a forbidden treasure that Wutian obtained back then. It was precisely because of it that he attracted those people from Border Prison.”
