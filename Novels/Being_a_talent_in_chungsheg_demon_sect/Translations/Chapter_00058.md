Chapter 58: The Saint Sect is Full of Talents

Lu Yang didn't pay much attention to Wang Song, merely lamenting that Wang Bairong, the old man of the Scripture Depository and a friend from his past lives, actually had descendants. Perhaps he could look after them in a future life, but for now, he had more important matters to attend to.

Lu Yang activated his escape light, left his cave abode, and simultaneously retrieved his Enlightened Dao jade slip to begin comprehending "The Saint's Plunder."

An ancient saying goes: "As long as saints exist, great thieves will never cease." This doesn't mean saints are thieves, but rather that saints establish laws for the world, which, while regulating human conduct, also inadvertently provide convenience for great thieves. However, this is the orthodox interpretation. The understanding within "The Saint's Plunder" is starkly different:

"The Saint's Plunder" states: Saints use their own rules to profit themselves; those who do not comply are treated as bandits. So-called saints are simply great thieves who plunder the world.

Therefore, to cultivate this body-refining cultivation method, one must establish a method of cultivation for the world. When everyone in the world follows this method, the cultivator can plunder the qi-destiny of all people to nourish themselves. This is the true meaning of the cultivation method: "Saints are great thieves; great thieves are the Great Dao."

To forge a Saint's Golden Body with the smoke and fire of the mortal world. Once the Golden Body is forged, its durability is akin to "the Saint's law, unchangeable for ten thousand generations," ranking among the top ten even among the Saint Sect's many body-refining cultivation methods.

Upon reading this, Lu Yang was utterly astounded.

"Turning all people into cultivation resources... the Saint Sect is still the Saint Sect. Every time I develop a slight positive impression of them, they always manage to open my eyes wide..."

To be honest, ever since he met Ming Chan, Yun Miaozhen, and others, Lu Yang's impression of the orthodox path had significantly declined. Indeed, orthodox sects like the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion are very good to their own people, meeting all orthodox standards in every aspect. However, this is limited only to "their own people."

What constitutes "their own people"? The orthodox path emphasizes karma and past and present lives. If you accumulated good karma and merit in a past life, then you are "their own person" and can receive the orthodox path's favor. Conversely, if you committed evil in a past life and accumulated karma, then even if you are pure and innocent in this life, you cannot enter the orthodox path. You might even be directly killed by them under the pretexts of "for your own good," "cleansing your karma," or "you'll have your own opportunities in the next life." Yun Miaozhen, that crazy woman, is a typical example.

With such a comparison, Lu Yang discovered the watershed between the orthodox and demonic paths. For the Saint Sect, disciples are all talents, so they recruit without reservations, teaching everyone regardless of background. Whether one has a past life or what their merits are is completely irrelevant. The orthodox path, on the other hand, emphasizes "acting on behalf of Heaven." Reincarnation, karma, destiny—the orthodox path places extreme importance on merit, karma, and past lives in this regard, often recruiting disciples based on these factors.

Both have their pros and cons; the only difference is which is more "human-like."

Thinking this, Lu Yang couldn't help but feel helpless: "Not a single normal sect. What's wrong with this world...? It must be a systemic problem!"

As he pondered, Lu Yang had already arrived deep within the sea of clouds. Soon, a majestic and grand black mountain range entered Lu Yang's sight. It was none other than "Yin Mountain," also the location of the Sanhe Association's main headquarters.

Just then, a hearty laugh suddenly rang out: "Junior Brother Lu, you've finally come out of seclusion!"

The next second, a figure identical to thirty years ago appeared outside Yin Mountain. Lu Yang smiled slightly at the sight, then cupped his hands in a respectful greeting: "Greetings, Senior Brother Luo."

"Between you and me, there's no need for formality." Luo Wuya chuckled, patting Lu Yang's shoulder. He had always held Lu Yang in high regard; otherwise, he wouldn't have specifically sent him "The Saint's Plunder" cultivation method.

Luo Wuya had also partly guessed Lu Yang's purpose. "Junior Brother, you're here for 'The Saint's Plunder,' aren't you?"

Lu Yang nodded: "This cultivation method is indeed profound and unfathomable, but its scope is extremely wide, and it takes an extremely long time. I'm afraid it cannot be achieved overnight..."

"Hahaha," Luo Wuya burst into laughter. "Junior Brother, you're not actually thinking of leaving the Saint Sect and cultivating this method from scratch in the mortal world, are you? The Saint Sect is vast and rich in resources, full of talents. Why go through such trouble? Regarding 'The Saint's Plunder,' the Saint Sect already has a complete cultivation method for it."

Lu Yang cupped his hands: "Please enlighten me, Senior Brother."

"Come with me." Luo Wuya led Lu Yang directly into a grand hall within Yin Mountain, where a massive crystal sphere was prominently placed in the center.

"This place is called the 'Refining Law Secret Realm'." Seeing Lu Yang's puzzled expression, Luo Wuya pointed to the crystal sphere and explained: "Don't let its size deceive you; this is actually a Dao Lord's creation!"

"A Dao Lord...?!" Lu Yang's heart immediately trembled. Foundation Establishment is a True Person, Golden Core is a True Monarch, and only Nascent Soul cultivators are respectfully addressed as Dao Lords. Could this object actually be refined by such an existence?

"Within the 'Refining Law Secret Realm' are 140 million living people. Each of them has strong qi and blood, and pure souls. One person here is equivalent to more than ten ordinary mortals from the outside world. Whether used for refining magical treasures or cultivating cultivation methods, they are all top-grade materials. Junior Brother, they are perfectly suited for your cultivation of 'The Saint's Plunder'."

Upon hearing this, Lu Yang gasped, drawing a cold breath: "140 million 'talents'..."

It seemed that now that he had broken through to Great Perfection of Qi Refining and joined the Sanhe Association, a Foundation Establishment faction, he was finally qualified to learn a bit about the Saint Sect's true heritage.

Just then, the secret realm suddenly shone brightly. The next second, a black-robed youth walked out of it, his face livid with frustration: "Damn those unruly commoners... I failed again!" After speaking, the youth glanced at Luo Wuya, then left directly without a word. Lu Yang naturally didn't speak either. It wasn't until the youth had walked far away that he looked at Luo Wuya, only to see Luo Wuya reveal a hint of schadenfreude.

"That's also an inner sect true disciple, the only son of True Person Chongguang, named Chongming. Don't mind him; he failed again in cultivating 'The Saint's Plunder'."

"I won't hide it from you, Junior Brother; 'The Saint's Plunder' isn't that easy to cultivate." At this point, Luo Wuya's expression became solemn again: "Don't underestimate the people in this secret realm. Although they are 'talents,' they are not fools."

"As you know, Junior Brother, 'The Saint's Plunder' requires one to create a cultivation method out of thin air for the people, and only then can one cultivate. The more profound the created method, the greater the feedback upon success. However, we are not Dao Lords; the cultivation methods we create are mostly superficial and easily seen through."

"The failures of 'The Saint's Plunder' stem from this."

"Among the disciples who previously cultivated 'The Saint's Plunder,' there were even cases where their true identities were discovered by the living people, who then feigned compliance and eventually counter-attacked, turning them into a laughingstock of the Saint Sect."

"So, Junior Brother, you must think twice about how to cultivate this method." After speaking, Luo Wuya took out another jade slip and handed it to Lu Yang: "I also cultivated this method back then, so I have some shallow experience."

"Many thanks, Senior Brother!"

"It's all for the Sanhe Association, isn't it? I'm waiting for you to come out of seclusion having achieved great success. If you truly cultivate 'The Saint's Plunder,' Junior Brother, you'll be considered quite formidable among the true disciples."

Lu Yang's eyebrows twitched upon hearing this, catching Luo Wuya's implied meaning. Only by cultivating "The Saint's Plunder" would he be "not weak." So... I'm still not good enough now?

Lu Yang remained calm, still respectfully bowed, and then approached the "Refining Law Secret Realm." With a sweep of his spiritual sense, a flood of information poured into his mind.

As expected of a Dao Lord's creation, this secret realm could actually be "configured"! Human history, geographical features, and architecture could all be shaped according to his thoughts. This mighty power of changing heaven and earth with a single thought filled Lu Yang with awe and immense apprehension.

Because in his mind, one thought stubbornly lingered. The secret realm was a Dao Lord's creation. If a Dao Lord could accomplish such terrifying things within the secret realm, then in reality... did they possess the same power?

The living people within the secret realm were "talents" to him. So what about the Saint Sect's cultivators to a Dao Lord?

Lu Yang dared not think further, only letting out a helpless sigh: "Damn it, the Saint Sect is truly full of 'talents' everywhere!"
