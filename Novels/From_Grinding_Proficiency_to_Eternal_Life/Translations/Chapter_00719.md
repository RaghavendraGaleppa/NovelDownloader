# Chapter 719: The Dharma Lineage

Once this array is fully deployed, its power is immeasurable.

However, under the concealment array formed by the Shadow Concealment Flags, these sword-shaped array banners were hidden. Xu Yunfan had even specially taken out a long sword refined from the essence of nine celestial stars combined with the Qi of Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil—a treasure-grade artifact—to serve as the array's core.

Just as Xu Yunfan was focusing intently, remotely controlling the deployment of these two earth-shattering killing arrays through Han Shi from eight hundred miles away, a faint yet undeniable fluctuation emanated from the protective mountain array outside the Primordial Origin Sect's Divine Thunder Mountain in the Taidang Lingxu Realm.

Xu Yunfan's main body frowned slightly and split off a strand of his consciousness.

His divine sense swept over the area outside the mountain. He saw the ruler of the Primordial Origin Sect, the mid-Nascent Soul True Lord Pudu, standing with a smile atop the sea of clouds outside the array. His aura was perfectly harmonious, and a compassionate Dao rhythm faintly radiated from him.

Xu Yunfan did not dare to slight this Senior Brother. With a thought, the protective mountain array opened a portal, and a path paved with purple-gold thunderlight stretched out to welcome the guest.

His figure flashed, and he appeared at the mountain gate, cupping his fists in salute.

"Senior Brother Pudu has graced us with your presence. I failed to welcome you properly. Please, come inside and talk."

Pudu True Lord, with his ancient and plain face, wore a peaceful smile and nodded. "No need for such formality, Junior Brother Shengxiao."

He followed Xu Yunfan into the main hall of the Divine Thunder Palace.

The two sat down on the cloud platforms. Naturally, spiritual youths formed from thunderforce served tea infused with pure thunder spiritual energy.

After a round of pleasantries regarding the world's Qi mechanisms and the sect's recent affairs, Pudu True Lord set down his teacup, his gaze falling on Xu Yunfan, and got to the main point.

"Junior Brother Shengxiao, you are now the Mountain Lord of one of the Nine Immortal Mountains and a member of the sect's upper echelon. The Nine Immortal Mountains of the Primordial Origin Sect each have their own Dharma lineages to pass down, which is why our foundation is stable and our fortune is long-lasting."

Pudu True Lord's tone was calm.

"You have now established the Shengxiao Dharma lineage, and your disciples are gathering, forming a promising atmosphere. This is a good thing. However, for the Dharma lineage to grow and the Primordial Origin Sect to prosper, relying solely on gathering disciples to cultivate freely is ultimately too scattered."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but mutter to himself. The Primordial Origin Sect had always adopted a laissez-faire approach. For Pudu True Lord to suddenly visit, he must have an ulterior motive. Xu Yunfan showed a hint of confusion on his face.

"What does Senior Brother mean? My Divine Thunder Peak now has many disciples diligently cultivating the Divine Thunder Art, and the Dharma lineage is already established. How can it be called scattered?"

Pudu True Lord shook his head slightly.

"The foundation of a Dharma lineage lies in having an orderly inheritance and passing down the torch. Although you have many disciples practicing the Divine Thunder Art, you lack true inner disciples who have entered the hall and inherited your mantle. This is not a long-term solution."

Xu Yunfan found it even more strange. The Primordial Origin Sect had always adhered to the iron law of natural selection and the survival of the fittest. He spoke directly: "Senior Brother, isn't the tradition of our Primordial Origin Sect precisely 'survival of the fittest, the capable rise, the weak fall'?

"The Great Dao is a contest, each relying on their own abilities. Why is there a need to deliberately accept disciples and teach them?

"If the disciples below have talent and perseverance, they will naturally stand out. If they perish midway, that is also the fate of their Dao path; it cannot be forced."

In short, those who survive are geniuses, and dead geniuses are not geniuses.

In the tens of thousands of years of history of the Primordial Origin Sect, there was no shortage of disciples who achieved great success late in life, reaching the Nascent Soul True Lord realm and standing at the pinnacle of the Taidang Lingxu Realm. Even late Nascent Soul Great True Lords had emerged in abundance.

Pudu True Lord looked at Xu Yunfan, shook his head slightly, and still spoke unhurriedly: "That may be so. But the development of the sect must also consider the long term. Some seedlings have excellent bone structure and comprehension, and their temperament is also top-tier. Just because they lack a master to guide them ahead or lack crucial protection, they perish early amidst the thorns on the path of seeking the Dao. This is truly a pity."

He paused and emphasized, "It's too much of a pity for them to die halfway."

Xu Yunfan's thoughts raced.

Pudu True Lord's words were truly inconsistent with the Primordial Origin Sect's一贯 ruthless style.

The Primordial Origin Sect cultivated cultivators who could fight their way out of mountains of corpses and seas of blood. It preached laissez-faire. Dead geniuses were no longer geniuses.

Only such an environment could produce the fierce cultivators denounced as heretics and fiends by the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Bodhisattva Pure Land.

As the ruler, how could Pudu True Lord not understand this principle?

He suddenly mentioned that seedlings dying was a pity; there must be a deeper meaning.

Furthermore, as consumable materials, one must have the awareness of being consumable materials. The Qi Condensation disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect are either manipulated by Foundation Establishment Realms into becoming invisible puppets through karmic ties, or crushed by various loans, after which their bodies and souls are used as various nourishments.

It's just like cutting leeks. Once this batch is cut, just reopen the mountain gate to recruit new disciples, and when the time is ripe, cut them again.

This way of passing down the torch is a characteristic of the Primordial Origin Sect.

A look of difficulty and evasion appeared on Xu Yunfan's face. He cupped his fists and said, "What Senior Brother says makes sense. However, Junior Brother I have just taken over Divine Thunder Peak, with myriad matters complex, and my own cultivation cannot be neglected. I fear I have no time to spare to teach disciples meticulously.

"Moreover, accepting disciples and passing down the Dao is a great responsibility, not a child's play.

"The disciples currently under me, such as Bi Yuan, have followed me for many years, yet I have not formally included them among my direct disciples..."

Listening to Xu Yunfan's evasions, Pudu True Lord's smile remained unchanged, but his eyes deepened.

He picked up his teacup and took a light sip, as if casually saying, "Bi Yuan? I remember him. Back in the Divine Thunder Peak, he was half a guide for you. Now, with the support of your Divine Thunder Dharma lineage's fortune, he has barely managed to establish his Dao Foundation. Truly not easy."

These words pointed out that Bi Yuan's ability to establish his Foundation was largely due to the fortune dividends brought by Xu Yunfan achieving the True Lord realm and establishing Divine Thunder Peak. In Pudu True Lord's eyes, his own talent and potential were merely so-so.

Xu Yunfan understood in his heart. The evaluation that Bi Yuan barely managed to verify his Dao Foundation was indeed not weighty enough in Pudu True Lord's eyes.

Moreover, whether it was Lu Chuan or Chu Chengnan, they cultivated his methods, not the Divine Thunder Path. Pudu True Lord naturally hoped that Xu Yunfan would contribute something, rather than just taking from the Primordial Origin Sect.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but cough twice and fell silent.

Pudu True Lord set down his teacup, his gaze meeting Xu Yunfan's directly, his tone still calm.

"As for responsibility, True Lord Qingyuan perished in body and Dao. Someone must take over and handle the karmic entanglements left by his lineage, as well as some internal and external affairs of the sect.

"Some burdens, others may not be able to bear, nor may they be willing to bear. Junior Brother, as you are now the Lord of Divine Thunder Peak, some matters, you must take on."

He didn't say directly that you killed him, but linking True Lord Qingyuan's perishing with "you must take on," the implication was clear.

This old thing. When I was proving the Dao and attaining the Nascent Soul realm, he turned a blind eye. When I killed True Lord Qingyuan, he turned a blind eye. Now he comes here to nag.

Xu Yunfan's heart chilled, but his face instantly turned solemn. He spoke righteously: "Senior Brother is mistaken! Senior Brother Qingyuan met with a calamity and perished because his luck was poor and he was surrounded by powerful enemies. What does that have to do with me?

"Although Junior Brother I may have had disagreements with Senior Brother Qingyuan in ideology, the bond of being fellow sect members still exists. I would never harm him! Senior Brother must not believe rumors!"

He denied it outright, his attitude resolute.

Pudu True Lord looked at Xu Yunfan's slightly agitated defense, the corner of his mouth curling into a profound smile. He neither admitted nor refuted it. He simply picked up his teacup and took another sip, as if that thunder spiritual tea had an infinite aftertaste.
