Chapter 106: Great Victory Over the Commander, Blood Palm Leaves Seclusion

On the arena stage.

"Good lad, you've only been at the manor for a few months. Without Pang Long's care, how could you have achieved such a position today with whatever meager skills you possess?"

"You don't know the immensity of heaven and earth, yet you've become so arrogant. You want to challenge my authority? Very well, today I shall let you taste my might."

Hua Han Eagle furrowed his brows, cursing inwardly. He was determined not only to win but to do so with overwhelming dominance. He knew Li Xian was adept at the "Four Directions Fist," so he decided to use his own strengths to defeat the enemy's, which would be truly impressive.

He immediately struck with the move "East Goes, West Comes."

This technique involved both fists striking out simultaneously, like two dragons probing the sea. The real and the illusory flowed naturally, grabbing left while seizing right, attacking right while capturing left. Two fists and two hands executed the effect of four.

Li Xian couldn't help but laugh. He saw Hua Han Eagle's fist technique was crude and unsightly. Though it whistled through the air with great momentum, it was mostly impractical.

He was deeply versed in the Four Directions Fist, knowing its advantages and disadvantages, its strengths and weaknesses, and the flaws in each stance.

This move, "East Goes, West Comes," attacked the left and right flanks. It appeared to be a simultaneous strike with both hands, both offensive and defensive, allowing one to engage in direct combat and still protect the front gate if the enemy struck.

In reality, it left the center gate wide open.

Li Xian took a step back, skillfully evading the fist's锋芒. Then, his right hand slapped the scabbard. The narrow sword shot out of its sheath, and the hilt drove straight for Hua Han Eagle's center gate.

Hua Han Eagle paid it no mind, intending to grab the hilt. After seizing the sword, he would unleash the "Chain of Chaotic Wind Blades" to claim victory in one go.

But just as he was about to move, he found his hands would not obey his commands. He was caught in a dilemma, flustered and in a rush, unable to avoid the center gate...

With a "thud," the hilt struck Hua Han Eagle's chest. He was sent flying off the stage, crashing down miserably.

Winter had already passed, and the ground was no longer covered in a blanket of snow. The manor's grounds were mostly paved with blue bricks, but there were still some areas of yellow dirt.

Hua Han Eagle happened to land on the dirt. It didn't hurt, but it was a great humiliation. His commander's uniform was instantly soiled.

The narrow sword bounced back, and Li Xian caught it, sheathing it once more. He cupped his fist and said, "Fourth-rank Guard Li Xian, I thank you for your concession." Finding the victory uninteresting, he turned to leave.

Hua Han Eagle scrambled to his feet, his face covered in mud, burning with shame and fury. He swept his gaze over the crowd of guards. He saw them first staring in disbelief, then their expressions became varied and complex, gloating and欲言又止.

He had deliberately built up the atmosphere beforehand, yet the most crucial link was his utter defeat. Though the others dared not speak, they must be sneering in their hearts.

Thinking of this, Hua Han Eagle, both proud and insecure, could not tolerate it. He felt a rush of blood to his head and had to regain his honor immediately.

"Again!"

Hua Han Eagle leaped onto the stage, soaring two zhang high like a great eagle. In an instant, he executed the "Fire Eagle Claw," using the extremely lethal stance "Hawk Pouncing on a Tiger."

Li Xian turned to evade and asked with a smile, "Commander Hua, haven't you already lost?"

"Lose, my ass! It doesn't count! You haven't defeated my Fire Eagle Claw yet, so we can't talk about winning or losing!" Hua Han Eagle's claw technique was fierce and overwhelming, paying no heed to anything else. Every claw was used with full force, accompanied by a "tearing" sound.

"What happened to 'a man's word is his bond'?" Li Xian provoked verbally, dodging calmly.

Hua Han Eagle felt deeply shamed and chose not to answer, his claws aiming for Li Xian's head. This move was called "Mad Eagle Shattering the Skull," a truly vicious killing technique.

Li Xian did not retreat but advanced instead. His body was like a gentle breeze, skillfully sliding past the claw strike, invading Hua Han Eagle's inner circle, and ramming with his shoulder.

A "thud" was heard. Hua Han Eagle's whole body shook, feeling an urge to vomit blood. With this single ram, the difference in their internal energy was as vast as heaven and earth.

The gap in their strength was one reason; Hua Han Eagle, in his anger, focused solely on wild attacks and neglected defense was another. Even a three-year-old could see that the outcome was already decided.

Li Xian kicked Hua Han Eagle away and顺势 drew his sword. The Great Luo Blade, wide and unrestrained, swept in like a gale.

In an instant, twenty-one strikes were delivered, each hitting a vital point.

But they only penetrated the skin by three-tenths of a fen.

Three breaths later, Li Xian sheathed his sword and walked out of the main courtyard.

Hua Han Eagle stood dumbfounded, feeling no pain. He said, "Stop your tricks, I haven't lost yet, watch me..." He circulated his internal energy.

At that moment, blood surged rapidly, breaking through the skin. In an instant, he became a man of blood. Upon closer inspection, his body was covered in dense sword marks. Had any of the cuts been a fraction deeper, it would have been enough to take his life.

And yet...

Every strike was perfectly measured, stopping just short. It struck his face but did not harm his life.

"Twenty-one times..."

"He could have killed me twenty-one times just now!?"

A chill ran through Hua Han Eagle's entire body, and he stood frozen like a wooden chicken.

The guards were terrified, as if they had encountered a ghost. Zhao Han and the others were also filled with shock.

"This Great Luo Blade Technique... how did it become so divine in his hands?" A B-rank guard who also practiced the Great Luo Blade was utterly perplexed.

Leaving the manor.

On the way back to Heihe Village, Li Xian reflected on the recent fight, summarizing his experience.

"Hua Han Eagle's Fire Eagle Claw is indeed not weak. Striking from the air is extremely formidable. When he struck just now, it was like a great fire rushing at my face, scorching and unbearable, like a flying eagle pouncing, swift and fierce beyond words."

"But his mindset was unbalanced, and he was anxious to win. In my eyes, naturally, there were many flaws. I only needed to seize one, and even if my Great Luo Blade was only 'proficient,' it was enough to achieve victory."

Li Xian had been practicing martial arts for several months.

He had experienced life-and-death struggles and arena fights... all of it. He increasingly felt that the application of martial arts is very important. The guards of the First Unison Manor, like the others, apply their martial arts in a rigid, one-size-fits-all manner.

The difference is related to personal aptitude, as well as the guidance of a good teacher.

Li Xian left the manor and walked to a mountainside, looking back.

The scenery between heaven and earth was vastly different. The silver attire had turned into a green carpet. A gentle breeze blew, and the moisture of the water filled his face. The river was wide, and the mountains were towering.

It happened to be morning.

Distant rays of morning light shone in countless beams, breathtakingly beautiful. Having seen too much snow scenery, and now seeing this vitality, the feeling was entirely different.

Gazing at the Black Water River...

Li Xian inexplicably thought of the "Initial Realm" scene. Though he was curious, he had no intention of investigating.

"I now have some martial arts under my belt."

"Dealing with the likes of Hua Han Eagle is, of course, easy. However, the 'Li Haitang,' 'Fur-cloaked Maiden,' and 'Yang Huayu' I saw before were about the same age as me, yet they were already 'Eating Essence' long ago."

"Compared to them, my strength is far inferior."

Li Xian looked at the green trees along the way. Birds were picking at wood to build their nests, yet no one drove them away. They were far more carefree and at ease than humans.

"The manor has a strict hierarchy. If I had the strength, wandering outside alone would be better, even if it were a bit more dangerous."

"But leaving the manor, martial arts would be hard to obtain. How am I to understand the ins and outs of the martial world?"

"I will first cultivate quietly in the village. The various martial arts I have are enough for me to practice for a year or half. I can make plans then."

Li Xian weighed the pros and cons, feeling the path ahead was narrow. He had few choices. The Jianghu is a world that devours people, and the manor is also a world that devours people.

Heihe Village is located in a remote area, among the mountains. Without the harassment of mountain bandits, it is truly a sanctuary for quiet cultivation.

Returning to the village.

Li Xian let out a long breath, butchered a tiger to make a stew, and enjoyed the delicacies of the mountains. Suddenly, he saw the "Deer-Shooting Bow" hanging in his room. It had been used frequently lately, causing the bow body to crack slightly.

"The Deer-Shooting Bow is a hunting bow; it's gradually becoming unsuitable for me now."

"Coincidentally, the last time I went into the mountains, I saw a yellow willow tree. Why not make a new bow and bury my old friend here?"

Li Xian gently stroked the bow body.

The affection here is hard for others to understand, but times change, and blindly clinging to the past is not advisable.

That afternoon, he felled the yellow willow tree. Yellow willow is a rare wood of considerable value. This wood is tough and light, with excellent elasticity.

It also has the property of "absorbing oil." By absorbing animal oil, it can increase the bow's toughness and elasticity. Li Xian often goes hunting in the mountains, so he has plenty of animal oil.

He applied it over and over again, letting it ferment and dry in the sun...

Then, he used the "Golden Leopard Sinew" for the string.

After some time, the Deer-Shooting Bow was transformed into the "Golden Leopard Bow." Whether in feel or power, it had increased several times over.

Li Xian moved the animal fur and bone ornaments from the Deer-Shooting Bow to the Golden Leopard Bow. By沾上 his own aura, he established a connection with the bow.

Life in the mountains was monotonous but fulfilling, and there is little to say about it.

His heart was focused. He cultivated deeply in the mountains, and heaven rewards the diligent, making progress every day.

Meanwhile, in the manor, the winds and clouds were changing, without a moment's rest.

Time flies like an arrow, and the sun and moon shuttle like a loom.

In the blink of an eye, it was mid-May.

Black Water Port, Black Water River.

The river channel shimmered with light, dotted with large ships and small boats.

At the mouth of the pier, a "human flesh sail" fluttered in the wind. Cries and screams came from time to time.

"Damn it, this woman couldn't take it. She's dead and stinking already."

A member of the Black Water Gang stepped on a face, grabbed a head of hair, and climbed to the top of the "flesh sail." Pinching his nose, he untied a woman with disheveled hair and no breath left.

He pulled out the black rods that had pierced her hands and feet, and threw the corpse into the river.

The gang member climbed down the human flesh sail. Passing a spot, he suddenly grinned and said, "Commander Yang, long time no see. I used to work under you. I wonder if you still recognize me."

"Hello, I didn't expect you to be promoted so quickly."

His words were full of pride.

"Kill... kill me..." Yang Cheng's skin was dark. The wounds on his four limbs had already scabbed over, merging with the black rods, a terrifying sight.

"Kill you? In your dreams." The gang member slapped him twice, "Slapping you is more like it."

Climbing down the human flesh sail.

The gang member brought a bucket of yellow water. It was made by boiling fish scraps and leftovers over a high fire, with an unspeakable foul stench.

"Flesh sails, it's feeding time."

"Use your mouths to catch it."

He threw it forcefully, splashing it onto the human flesh sail. Most of the people on the sail had lost the will to live, but they were incredibly hungry, so instinctively opened their mouths to catch it. Despite their reluctance, they relied on the filthy substance to barely stay alive.

"Yo, Commander Yang, don't say I'm not good to you. Here, open your mouth, I'll give you an extra mouthful," the gang member laughed.

Yang Cheng numbly opened his mouth, and the foul yellow stuff splashed on his face. He drank it down, feeling humiliated and numb.

He passed out. He didn't know how much time had passed before his eyes trembled open, looking towards another large ship...

In his vision, that large ship was filled with the gang's main forces.

The gang's twelve commanders and the Six Sons of Zheng Blood Palm were gathered on the deck.

Zheng Blood Palm's fifth son, named Zheng Lüxiu, asked, "Third Brother, is Father really coming out of seclusion today?"

Zheng Blood Palm's third son, Zheng Ziqi.

Since returning from the First Unison Manor, he had been acting as the head of the gang's affairs. Zheng Blood Palm, due to his serious injuries, had focused on recuperating and had not shown his face for a long time.

On weekdays, he only dealt with Zheng Ziqi.

"He should be," said Zheng Ziqi.

"Third Brother, why doesn't Father recuperate in the hall, but insists on living on the ship?" Zheng Lüxiu asked.

"I'm not sure either," Zheng Ziqi thought for a moment and said, "I heard Father say that woman's power is strangely deep. Her palm energy remains in his body and cannot be expelled. He needs to borrow the Yin and damp energy of the river to feel a bit better."

The two were just talking when they heard footsteps. Zheng Ziqi raised his right hand in a gesture, and it fell silent instantly.

Zheng Blood Palm walked out slowly. The slanting sunlight revealed his true appearance. His cheeks were sunken, his eye sockets protruded, and he was gaunt and skeletal.

His former burly figure was completely gone.

"Father, you..." Zheng Lüxiu couldn't believe it.

"I'm fine..." Zheng Blood Palm was skin and bones, but his voice was full of strength. "Let's discuss this back at the hall."

Zheng Blood Palm had come out of seclusion with serious injuries, his vitality greatly depleted. He had lost three layers of skin and a lot of flesh, but he had fortunately managed to pull through.

After washing up and changing into new clothes, his former tight-fitting clothes now looked loose.

"Dad, what about the grudge for our Seventh Brother?" Zheng Ziqi asked. "You were in seclusion the whole time, so I didn't dare make a decision."

"Should we gather the gang and storm the manor? We have the numbers. We can form a formation and throw our lives at them. I don't believe we can't take down that woman!"

Zheng Blood Palm raised his right hand in a gesture.

Zheng Ziqi immediately fell silent. Zheng Blood Palm said with lingering fear, "That woman is too powerful; she's not someone we can provoke. We've already made amends for the raid on the manor, so let it rest."

"The仇 for killing our Seventh Son must be avenged. This time, we will prepare gifts and send them over. We will focus on negotiation. We will use silver to buy the life of that凶贼. We absolutely must not use force."
