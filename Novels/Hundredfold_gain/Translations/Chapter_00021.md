# Chapter 21: Unexpected Challengers  

Qi Chuan swept his spiritual sense across his dantian and discovered clusters of spiritual energy gathered together like a bowl of water, flowing and rippling gently within.  

"This spiritual energy is at least fifty percent more abundant than at the peak of the third level of Qi Refinement!" Qi Chuan nodded slightly.  

Although the quantity had only increased by half, the improvement in strength was far greater. The energy was now more condensed and refined, having undergone purification and tempering during the breakthrough. Due to the enhanced quality, even if he cast the same spell, its power would be significantly stronger at the fourth level of Qi Refinement compared to the third.  

Moreover, this was just the initial state after breaking through. As he continued cultivating, his spiritual energy would continue to grow.  

This made it clear—the gap between the fourth and third levels of Qi Refinement was much wider than that between the third and second levels. It was the difference between the mid and early stages of Qi Refinement.  

After assessing his post-breakthrough condition, Qi Chuan looked ahead and murmured, "I've reached the fourth level now. At this age and cultivation level, will I be able to secure an inner sect disciple spot in Fengyue Sect?"  

By his estimate, there were still about three months before Fengyue Sect opened its mountain gates for recruitment. However, the Qi Clan would likely determine the inner sect candidate earlier.  

He didn’t know the exact timing—he could only wait.  

But while waiting, he couldn’t afford to slack in his cultivation.  

Still, having just broken through, it was time to take a short break.  

Qi Chuan left his small house and walked to the fields atop the peak, casually tending to the spiritual plants.  

**[You diligently tended to spiritual plants for half an hour, triggering a 2x multiplier. Your experience and skill in plant cultivation have slightly improved.]**  

---  

A month passed in the blink of an eye.  

On this day, the Qi Clan elders announced that they would determine the inner sect disciple candidate in advance. They summoned all Qi Clan cultivators to the main hall of the ancestral peak for the selection.  

One by one, cultivators emerged from their respective peaks and headed toward the main hall.  

At his own secluded peak—  

"Ah-Chuan, let’s go. Time to watch the excitement," Qi Baicang called out, finding Qi Chuan in the middle of tending a spiritual field.  

"Alright." Having just finished his work, Qi Chuan agreed. After tidying up, he followed his second uncle to the main peak.  

"Rumor has it that besides deciding the inner sect spot, they’ll also confirm the three outer sect disciple positions today. So, any thoughts on competing for an outer sect spot?" Qi Baicang asked with a smile.  

"Outer sect disciple? Not interested," Qi Chuan replied, shaking his head.  

"No? Well, that’s understandable. No matter—we’ll just enjoy the show." Qi Baicang patted his shoulder reassuringly.  

He assumed that his nephew’s recent cultivation progress had been slow, still stuck at the second level of Qi Refinement—not even reaching its peak. Thus, competing for an outer sect spot was likely out of reach.  

But that was only natural.  

How old was Qi Chuan?  

He had only joined the main clan four years ago. Reaching the second level of Qi Refinement with an eighth-grade spiritual root was already impressive.  

Thinking of himself—having cultivated for decades yet still stuck at the third level—Qi Baicang could only sigh in understanding.  

---  

Soon, they arrived at the main hall of the ancestral peak.  

Dozens of Qi Clan cultivators had gathered, taking their seats.  

The clan leader, Foundation Establishment elder Qi Wuyou, along with the Transmission Elder and other elders, sat at the front, surveying the crowd.  

Though many had come, only a few young cultivators were actually eligible to compete for the spots. Most were just spectators.  

Fengyue Sect had allocated one inner sect and three outer sect disciple positions to the Qi Clan—but with strict age restrictions. Only those under eighteen could qualify.  

Naturally, this narrowed the pool of candidates significantly.  

"Today, we will first determine the inner sect disciple position. Those who believe they have the qualifications, step forward," Clan Leader Qi Wuyou announced without preamble.  

As soon as he spoke, the gazes of the elders—including Qi Wuyou himself—landed on a red-robed young woman seated among the crowd.  

Nearly every cultivator in the hall also turned their attention toward her.  

Over the past three years, ever since news of Fengyue Sect’s recruitment spread, many in the Qi Clan had learned about the coveted inner sect position.  

Everyone understood its significance.  

An inner sect disciple of Fengyue Sect was almost guaranteed to reach the late stages of Qi Refinement, with a chance to even reach the tenth level—perfection.  

Most importantly, Fengyue Sect held the path to Foundation Establishment. As an inner sect disciple, one might gain access to such opportunities.  

Thus, securing this position was akin to ascending to the heavens in a single step.  

Those in the know were already aware that the inner sect spot was as good as decided.  

The red-robed girl was rumored to possess a fourth-grade spiritual root. Though her exact cultivation level remained unknown, reaching the peak of the third level of Qi Refinement was highly probable.  

Many curious eyes lingered on her.  

Under the weight of their gazes, the girl—Qi Chan’er—lifted her delicate face slightly. Meeting the expectant look from her grandfather, the Transmission Elder, a faint smile curved her lips as she prepared to rise.  

But just as she was about to stand—  

"Clan Leader, Elders, this junior believes he is qualified to compete for the inner sect position!"  

A confident voice, brimming with conviction, suddenly rang out across the hall.  

What?  

Someone dared to challenge a fourth-grade spiritual root talent for the inner sect spot?  

Who was this dark horse?  

Shocked eyes turned toward the source of the voice.  

A young man stood from his seat, bowing solemnly to the elders. His tanned face was set with determination.  

"This junior, Qi Li, is currently at the second level of Qi Refinement!"  

A faint spiritual pressure—characteristic of the second level—emanated from him.  

The hall fell into stunned silence.  

Before anyone could react, another voice rose defiantly.  

"Clan Leader, Elders, this junior also believes he is qualified to compete for the inner sect position!"  

"This junior is Qi Huo, and my cultivation has also reached the second level of Qi Refinement!"  

Another challenger?  

Eyes swiveled toward a black-robed youth who had now risen to his feet, his spiritual pressure confirming his claim.  

For a moment, the hall was utterly silent.
