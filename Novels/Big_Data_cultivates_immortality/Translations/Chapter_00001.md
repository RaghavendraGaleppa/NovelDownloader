# Chapter 1: Who's Undergoing the Heavenly Tribulation?  

Zhengyang City, 4:00 PM. The sky, which should have been bright with sunlight, was instead shrouded in thick, dark clouds, turning the afternoon into something resembling night.  

Accompanying the ominous clouds were gusts of howling wind and distant flashes of lightning, the thunder rumbling like the world was coming to an end.  

Feng Jun sat in his employee dormitory, staring blankly out the window. He slammed his beer bottle onto the table and let out a heavy sigh. "Damn... which fellow cultivator is undergoing their heavenly tribulation?"  

Feng Jun wasn’t actually a cultivator—he was just an avid reader of web novels. His sarcastic remark stemmed from his foul mood.  

He was about to quit his job.  

Feng Jun was twenty-four years old, a graduate of Jiangxia University with dual degrees in Chinese Literature and Business Administration.  

Though the expansion of university admissions had made bachelor’s degrees as common as stray dogs in the city, graduating with two degrees from a prestigious 985 university still placed him among the so-called "chosen ones."  

Yet, graduation had led straight to unemployment. He had spent two years struggling in the southern city where his girlfriend lived before coming alone to Zhengyang with a wealth of experience—most of it bitter.  

His current workplace—if it could even be called that—was the Hongjie Culture and Entertainment Co., Ltd.  

Who knew why a fitness club would brand itself with "culture" in its name? Maybe it was one of those "sports and arts are inseparable" situations?  

That’s right—Feng Jun worked at the Hongjie Fitness Club.  

Not as one of those legendary personal trainers surrounded by admirers, but as a lowly attendant responsible for reception, errands, and cleaning.  

Being a trainer required certifications, and Hongjie wasn’t some shady roadside gym. It was one of the most reputable fitness clubs in Zhengyang.  

Feng Jun had landed the job partly because of a shortage of young labor in the market and partly because of his decent looks—rugged features and a sturdy build. He wasn’t some pretty-boy idol, but he could pass for "fit and strong."  

But only after getting hired did he learn that becoming a trainer required qualifications.  

What a tragic revelation.  

So here he was, a dual-degree graduate reduced to a mere attendant at a fitness club.  

Of course, even attendants had their moments. Over the three months he’d worked there, a few middle-aged women had shown interest in him. But Feng Jun had turned them down—their intentions weren’t exactly pure.  

The main issue was that they were... well, not exactly easy on the eyes. Some even had unbearable body odor and an overbearing demeanor.  

A few trainers had mocked him for his stubbornness, sneering, "Even postgrads can be poor but proud."  

For fuck’s sake, a dual degree isn’t the same as a master’s!  

Regardless, Feng Jun was something of an oddity at Hongjie—overqualified yet underemployed, with a stubborn pride unbecoming of someone in the service industry.  

Customers didn’t appreciate his attitude, and his coworkers looked down on him.  

Today, one of his colleagues had stolen a client right out from under him.  

That morning, four young, attractive girls had walked into the club. They weren’t members—just drop-ins looking to work out. One of them, a tall girl, was particularly stunning.  

Feng Jun had been the one to greet them. If he could convince them to sign up for memberships during their session, he’d earn a commission.  

Honestly, he hadn’t held much hope. The girls looked like college students, and there weren’t any universities nearby.  

Plus, students were young and carefree—few had the means or long-term interest in fitness memberships.  

But even this small opportunity was snatched away when Liu Shuming, one of the trainers, stepped in, offering to provide "consultation and service."  

As Liu approached, he shooed Feng Jun away with a dismissive wave. "Shoo, shoo... I’ll take it from here."  

Feng Jun was furious—not just about the lost commission, but also the sheer disrespect. Was it so hard to even look at him while talking?  

But he couldn’t say anything. In a fitness club, trainers outranked attendants.  

Then... disaster struck. Liu got beaten up.  

By the four girls.  

Despite his muscular build, Liu was no match for two of the girls, who turned out to be skilled fighters.  

The manager, Guo, rushed over to mediate and learned that the girls had repeatedly refused Liu’s "assistance," only for him to persist—complete with inappropriate touching.  

Liu defended himself, claiming he was just trying to provide "enthusiastic service" to encourage membership sign-ups.  

Guo apologized to the girls, comped their session, and sent them off with sweet talk before turning to assign blame.  

Strangely, she directed her anger at Feng Jun.  

"Feng Jun, since you were the one who received them, why didn’t you follow up? The clients explicitly said they didn’t want a trainer!"  

Liu also glared at Feng Jun, eyes burning with resentment. "If you’d handled it properly, this wouldn’t have happened!"  

Feng Jun’s pride wasn’t just for show. He threw his cleaning rag to the ground and shot Guo a cold look. "I didn’t ask Liu to take over. He didn’t even look at me when he shoved me aside—and now he’s blaming me for stealing his business?"  

"What kind of attitude is that?" Guo’s voice turned shrill. "Is that how you speak to a superior?"  

Feng Jun turned and walked away. "I’m not feeling well. I’m going back to rest."  

At that moment, he had already made up his mind: he was done with this shithole.  

So he bought a six-pack and returned to his dorm, slowly drinking while pondering his next move. Where would he go after quitting?  

Zhengyang was a quasi-sub-provincial city, but decent jobs were scarce. Menial work like serving or manual labor was easy to find, but positions befitting his education? Nearly impossible.  

He’d spent weeks job-hunting in Zhengyang before settling for the fitness club.  

Going back to his hometown was an option—his parents ran a small business there and had connections that could land him a job. He could even take over the family trade.  

But as a dual-degree graduate from a top-tier university, how could he face returning? He couldn’t bear to give up the city’s vibrancy—or the humiliation.  

As he stared out the window at the apocalyptic storm, he debated: quit now, or wait for his paycheck?  

After two years of scraping by, he had barely any savings. Even with the money his parents had sent for job-hunting, his bank account held little over 10,000 yuan. His phone was a freebie from a mobile plan—technically a smartphone, but barely better than a burner.  

At some point, the rain outside intensified, pelting the window like bullets. Lightning flashed brighter with each strike, thunder shaking the walls.  

Feng Jun finished the half-bottle of baijiu left in the dorm, followed by several beers. Drunk and frustrated, he reached for his phone to call a friend, only to find it at 3% battery.  

He plugged it in, then collapsed onto the bed, passing out with the phone still clutched in his hand. In a dormitory like this, theft was common—he’d lost money more than once.  

Life at the bottom was hard. Too hard to put into words.  

He didn’t know how long he’d been asleep when a blinding bolt of lightning lit up the room. A surge of electricity raced through the charger, straight into the battered phone.  

Feng Jun jolted awake as thunder exploded right above him, shaking the building. The windowpane had cracked down the middle. "What the hell? That lightning struck less than 300 meters away!"  

Then he noticed the searing pain in his hand. The phone was still there, but the charging cable... was blackened.  

The smell of burnt rubber hung in the air.  

Before he could react, shouts erupted from neighboring rooms.  

"Shit! My TV just smoked! That lightning was insane!"  

"Damn it, doesn’t this building have a lightning rod?"  

The dorm was in an old four-story building with a lightning rod, but the strike had been too close, too powerful. At least fifty TVs and countless phones and routers in the area had been fried.  

Feng Jun didn’t care about the rest—he just wanted to know if his phone still worked.  

The battered device might’ve been slow, but it was his lifeline—his contacts, his internet access.  

He pressed the home button. To his surprise, the screen lit up, sluggish but functional.  

Maybe he should test it with a call? As the thought crossed his mind, he glanced at the time.  

8:00 PM?  

That wasn’t too odd—he’d fallen asleep around 6:00.  

But why... was his battery already at 100%?
