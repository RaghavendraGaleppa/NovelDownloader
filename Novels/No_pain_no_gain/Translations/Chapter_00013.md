# Chapter 13: Magic Tool Fragment

The one-eyed giant, with a height like an iron tower, was precisely the Third Boss of the Wild Wolf Gang. Ever since Han Zhen's master, Deputy Sect Master Wu, had used his superior power to kill the Third Boss's only son, news of Han Zhen becoming Deputy Sect Master Wu's personal disciple had immediately reached the Wild Wolf Gang. Naturally, a portrait of Han Zhen had also found its way to the Third Boss's desk through an insider. To personally retaliate against Deputy Sect Master Wu, only by killing someone he valued in the same way could he truly feel the pain.

When the one-eyed giant saw the staff in the hands of the fleeing person, for a moment, he thought it was utterly impossible. As the Third Boss of the Wild Wolf Gang, he had roamed the martial world for decades. He knew deeply that profound True Qi cultivation required time to hone, let alone such a physique at such a young age. External martial arts were even harder to cultivate than internal arts, yet this kid possessed both. At most, he had only been practicing martial arts on the mountain for two years. How could he have such profound True Qi and martial arts attainments? This could no longer be explained by mere talent; he must harbor a great secret!

The Third Boss conceived the idea of capturing Han Zhen alive, the killing intent in his eyes transforming into greed. But his actions showed no slack. As the bowstring hummed, an arrow shot forth like a meteor streaking across the night sky. This arrow wouldn't take Han Zhen's life; it would only cripple half his body. The Third Boss watched as Han Zhen, leaping into mid-air, twisted his waist in a large somersault, throwing an armor-piercing arrow from his hand, which created ripples of air. It not only shattered the arrow shot by the Third Boss but also narrowly grazed past him, piercing through several Wild Wolf Gang disciples behind him. Only a moment later did the explosive sound of breaking the sound barrier reach the surroundings, waking half the town. Han Zhen was forced to change direction, landing steadily on the long street. His legs crushed the bluestone slabs beneath him, shedding the force, and then he strode away without looking back.

At the same time, the tavern door instantly burst open from the inside out. A silver flash appeared, and several heads flew into the air. In an instant, three or four Wild Wolf Gang disciples died a tragic death. It turned out that Hall Master Yue, awakened by the commotion, had hidden behind the main hall's door amidst the chaos, seizing Han Zhen's attack as an opportunity to cooperate and find a way out of the predicament. Only after stepping out of the tavern did Hall Master Yue realize that the Wild Wolf Gang had deployed so many men. Seeing several familiar old rivals, and even the Third Boss of the Wild Wolf Gang, renowned for his peerless archery, personally present, he knew he was doomed today. Hall Master Yue couldn't help but curse, "When did the Wild Wolf Gang turn into a bunch of rats!" In response to Hall Master Yue was a volley of crossbow bolts. He quickly rolled and hid behind the brick wall of the tavern's main hall.

Seeing that the Wild Wolf Gang's attention had been drawn to himself, Hall Master Yue's plan had succeeded. "Little Han, you must escape successfully! Remember to avenge us in the future." Hall Master Yue had made up his mind to buy as much time as possible for Han Zhen, preventing the Wild Wolf Gang's experts from pursuing him. With Han Zhen's talent and intellect, he wouldn't need decades to glimpse the realm of a Martial Grandmaster. By then, he would surely be able to eradicate the Wild Wolf Gang!

Delayed for a moment, the one-eyed giant glanced at Han Zhen, who hadn't run far. "Don't let anyone inside escape! I'll be back soon!" The Third Boss discarded his bow, drew his saber, and strode after him like a shooting star. Though the kid was fast, he unfortunately hadn't specifically trained in lightness skill, so he was destined to be caught. The Third Boss lightly tapped his foot, stirring up a gust of wind. Despite his massive size, his movement technique was incredibly ghostly.

Han Zhen ignored everything and sped up, only wanting to lead his pursuer as far away as possible. This could be considered a slight atonement for his act of abandoning his comrades and escaping alone. Han Zhen had already resolved not to delay any further. Upon returning to the Seven Mysteries Sect, he would immediately plan for the subsequent cultivation methods and spells of the Evergreen Art. However, things did not go as planned. Even though Han Zhen had gained a head start, after several tens of breaths, the giant had caught up to him.

"Disciple of that old dog Wu, only you, this little bastard, won't escape today!" Han Zhen stopped, turning to look at the enemy who had caught up behind him. "What's wrong? Not running anymore?" The one-eyed giant held his long saber, his expression grim. "I have a question: Was this aimed at me from the very beginning?" Han Zhen raised his staff, walked towards the giant, and looked up, his expression very serious. "So what if it was?" The Third Boss raised his long saber and grinned. "That's good then."

Han Zhen had always pursued stability, avoiding getting entangled in various worldly affairs. Even when Wu Yan provoked him repeatedly, he hadn't taken it to heart. But why did some people always push him relentlessly?

Han Zhen tore off his upper clothing. Crimson, python-like patterns spread across his body, and the sound of cracking joints emanated from him. Disregarding the bloody mist seeping from his skin and the pain of tearing meridians, he activated the secret technique of Fierce Python Strength to its maximum extent. Only with an immortal cultivation art accompanying him could Han Zhen be so fearless. Han Zhen stomped his right foot fiercely on the bluestone ground. A huge wave of True Qi spread out from him as its center, and ripples, like waves, seemed to appear in the air. In front of him, the standing one-eyed giant took a step back. The veins on his saber-wielding hands and even his arms bulged high, and a muffled thrumming sound like bowstrings resonated from his muscles and tendons, clearly indicating he had pushed his True Qi to its limit.

He watched Han Zhen, who was shooting towards him, his battle intent rising to its peak. On the long street, the staff and the broad golden saber clashed fiercely. "Die!" The one-eyed giant felt a tremor in his tiger's mouth, and immense force came from the saber hilt, nearly making him lose his grip. In this contest of strength, he actually fell into a disadvantage. The one-eyed man was pushed down, one knee bent, half-kneeling on the ground. Taking advantage of the moment before new force arrived, he flipped the blade, placing his other hand on the saber's surface to distribute the force. Han Zhen used the leverage to flip over, and his staff landed on the saber's surface a second time. A muffled explosion erupted, and instantly, violent currents of True Qi surged from their point of contact. Following this, fiery red True Qi filled the entire vision of the Third Boss's remaining eye.

True Qi Externalization! No longer merely attached to the weapon! He never expected to see someone use this move in his lifetime. The palm-wide long saber shattered from the middle, its fragments embedding themselves in the Third Boss's body and face. Then, the staff naturally landed on the Third Boss's head. A moment later, the massive headless corpse fell to the ground with a thud.

Something fell from the corpse's neck, hitting the bluestone slab with a crisp sound. "This is..." Han Zhen felt an extremely familiar energy signature; it was a minuscule fluctuation of spiritual energy. Han Zhen removed an arrowhead hanging around the headless corpse's neck. He didn't know what material it was made from, but it felt slightly cool to the touch and emitted a faint spiritual glow.

The sounds of shouting and killing continued. Han Zhen looked into the distance and saw that the archers on the rooftops had already switched to fire arrows, confirming Han Zhen's suspicion. The enemy, fearing punishment for their prolonged failure to capture, decided to simply burn down the entire tavern. Han Zhen carefully put the arrowhead into his embrace, picked up the great saber that had broken into two, and turned back.

Suddenly, a broken saber landed in front of the commander who was about to order the fire attack. What had returned was half of the Third Boss's weapon. Everyone who saw this scene wondered if they were hallucinating. Then, Han Zhen, with the staff strapped to his back, his upper body covered in bizarre patterns like a divine fiend, descended from the sky.

On the Seven Mysteries Sect's side, numerous disciples were overwhelmed with both surprise and joy at their sudden salvation from despair. As for Hall Master Yue's expression, it was incredibly colorful, and the two protectors were dumbfounded, recognizing Han Zhen's perfected Fierce Python Strength. This kid Han Zhen actually took down the Third Boss of the Wild Wolf Gang by himself! How many years had he even been practicing martial arts? The Wild Wolf Gang disciples immediately became unsettled. Everyone looked at Han Zhen, who had abruptly entered the battlefield, with both surprise and fear, turning their gaze to their commander, faintly showing signs of retreat.
