# Chapter 118: The Machine Tool  

Li Shiming stepped out of a cave dwelling at the lower levels of Xun Peak, with a late-stage Qi Refining senior brother politely seeing him off.  

This was the eighth sect mission he had completed—setting up formations for fellow disciples. He had deliberately chosen tasks that rewarded sect contribution points, even if the payouts were modest.  

His formations maximized their inherent power, earning him a small reputation among late-stage Qi Refining disciples who needed such services.  

Yet, after twenty days, he had only completed eight missions, earning a total of 400 contribution points. To him, this pace was still too slow.  

The limited rewards were partly due to the missions being from Qi Refining disciples, who could only offer so much.  

The reason he spent so much time and effort on these tasks was simple: he was worried.  

In the twenty days since returning to the sect, aside from daily use of the *Spring Breeze Nurturing Technique* at Eagle Beak Island, he had spent most of his time in the underground space.  

The interrogation of Han Tianlei had concluded—the deceased spirit farmer on Eagle Beak Island had no connection to him, and the sect still hadn’t found the real culprit.  

Li Shiming knew the spirit farmer had likely been killed in retaliation by the Holy Ice Sect. The question was whether they realized they had targeted the wrong person.  

Every time he returned to the sect, he reviewed the surveillance footage for any suspicious activity near Eagle Beak Island, but so far, nothing new had appeared.  

This didn’t mean he was safe. Fortunately, Eagle Beak Island was close to the Nine Peaks, and with the upgraded small-scale mountain-protection formation, a repeat of the previous breach was unlikely.  

"Junior Brother Li, hold on!" Just as Li Shiming was about to head to the Spiritual Mechanism Pavilion, a voice called out to him as he was leaving Xun Peak.  

The speaker was a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator whose demeanor was unlike most—he exuded an easygoing charm.  

"Apologies for interrupting, Junior Brother Li. My name is Yun Ze. My family runs the Yun Trading House within the sect," the man introduced himself with a smile.  

*Ah, a businessman.* Li Shiming finally understood the man’s unusual aura.  

"How may I help you, Senior Brother Yun?" Li Shiming asked, still unsure why Yun Ze had stopped him.  

Seeing that Li Shiming didn’t seem familiar with the Yun Trading House, Yun Ze wasn’t surprised.  

Though the Yun Trading House was one of the larger merchant operations catering to Qi Refining disciples, Li Shiming had only recently joined the sect and lived alone outside its main grounds. It made sense he wouldn’t know about it.  

"The Yun Trading House is officially recognized by the sect and specializes in supplying resources to cultivators—all purchasable with spirit stones," Yun Ze explained, getting straight to the point.  

Li Shiming’s interest was piqued. Since Qiu Tan’s disappearance, his usual supply channels had dried up.  

Given the current circumstances, he dared not venture too far from the Nine Peaks, making it impossible to procure resources on his own.  

He was indeed running low—from formation materials to cultivation resources, he needed everything.  

The reason he had been grinding sect missions was to earn enough contribution points to exchange for some of these resources.  

"Senior Brother Yun, I happen to need a batch of supplies. You’ve arrived just in time to solve my urgent problem!" Li Shiming said with a smile.  

"Just tell me what you need, Junior Brother. I can arrange procurement and delivery to your cave dwelling," Yun Ze replied warmly, pleased to have secured a deal.  

Though Li Shiming’s reputation as a formation master was still modest, merchants like Yun Ze knew better.  

Formation masters were lucrative clients—anyone with such skills could earn vast sums of spirit stones if they put in the time.  

Moreover, formation masters were also major consumers of resources, as researching formations required vast amounts of materials.  

Every up-and-coming formation master was a potential long-term customer for trading houses.  

"Here’s a list of what I need. How soon can you arrange it?" Li Shiming handed over a paper list.  

Yun Ze was momentarily surprised—he hadn’t expected Li Shiming to be so prepared. He felt a surge of relief; if he hadn’t approached Li Shiming first, this deal might have gone to a competitor.  

The sect recognized multiple trading houses, and competition was fierce.  

Unlike the markets outside the Nine Peaks, these trading houses only dealt with promising disciples, offering services as both a business and an investment.  

By supporting talented cultivators early, they secured future patronage.  

When these disciples grew stronger, they would, in turn, support the trading houses.  

This symbiotic relationship didn’t hinder profits—a single deal with a promising disciple could eclipse dozens of transactions in the outer markets.  

"Ten sticks of Soul-Calming Incense aren’t cheap. Some of the mundane items on your list are in stock, but the rest will take about half a month. The formation materials can be delivered immediately," Yun Ze explained after reviewing the list.  

"How much in total?" Li Shiming had plenty of spirit stones—over two thousand, not counting those obtained from Baili Jinyan.  

His bottleneck had never been spirit stones, but sect contribution points.  

"1,680 spirit stones. The spiritual items will be delivered to your cave dwelling by dawn tomorrow. The mundane items are complimentary and will be sent as soon as they arrive," Yun Ze calculated swiftly.  

"Deal." Li Shiming handed over the spirit stones without hesitation.  

Within the sect, fraud was unthinkable—Yun Ze wouldn’t dare, and Li Shiming had no reason to worry.  

Transactions were recorded in identity jade slips, and any breach would bring sect intervention.  

This was the advantage of dealing with recognized trading houses.  

"Feel free to contact me for future needs," Yun Ze said with genuine warmth, offering his identity jade slip.  

They exchanged contact details, allowing Li Shiming to place orders within a thousand li of the sect.  

Watching Li Shiming leave, Yun Ze smiled in satisfaction.  

He had cashed in favors to pinpoint Li Shiming’s mission location and intercept him before competitors could.  

Securing a budding formation master like Li Shiming was worth far more than the ten favors he’d spent.  

Li Shiming was equally pleased. His post-return cultivation plan included the *Ice Heart Jade Mind Technique*, but he had lacked the foundational resource—Soul-Calming Incense—to begin formal training.  

The sect did sell it, but the contribution points required were steep. Meeting Yun Ze had been a stroke of luck—spirit stones alone sufficed, sparing his hard-earned points.  

The next morning, Yun Ze personally delivered the goods to Eagle Beak Island.  

Once secured, Li Shiming retreated to the underground space.  

There, a machine tool was nearing completion.  

Over the past days, aside from cultivation and missions, he had devoted himself to building this device.  

This wasn’t an ordinary machine tool—it was an industrial mother machine, a device capable of manufacturing other machines.  

The idea had taken root soon after settling in, and now it was finally materializing.  

Design blueprints for such machines were stored in IBMz15, heavily encrypted and classified.  

They included domestic and foreign designs, though their origins were beyond his knowledge.  

He had chosen the most mature model—a five-axis dual-swivel milling machine. The numerical control system relied on IBMz15, as he couldn’t yet produce microchips independently.  

Without chips, many advanced technologies remained out of reach.  

However, aside from the control system, every other component met or exceeded the precision standards of his previous world.  

This was because the machine had been crafted within the computer room space, where his micron-level control and the Three-Tier Sword Base allowed for flawless machining.  

No matter how complex the metalwork, the Sword Base—reduced to its finest cutting form—could achieve micron-level precision under his meticulous guidance.  

This surpassed anything achievable in his past life. The *Sword Control Art* and the infinitely sharp, shape-shifting Sword Base made perfection possible.  

Of course, the machine wasn’t without flaws—material limitations being the primary issue.  

He lacked access to all the rare metals required for ideal alloys, meaning the machine might deform slightly under thermal stress, reducing precision.  

His solution? Learning the art of *Enchantment*—a crucial step in artifact crafting where specific runes were inscribed to imbue objects with special properties.  

Basic enchantments included Spirit-Storage, Acceleration, Fortification, Deceleration, Flame, and Frost runes. Only with these could an artifact be considered genuine.  

Enchantment required precise spiritual sensitivity to locate the equilibrium point on an artifact’s坯体 (坯体: blank/form). This was a forte of formation masters.  

Many artifact craftsmen hired formation masters for this step, though some could do it themselves—a rare skill.  

Enchantment demanded not only spiritual acuity but also mastery of each rune’s true essence, akin to learning new spells.  

For formation masters, enchantment was a lucrative side hustle.  

At the Qi Refining stage, fees were modest, but demand was high. A steady partnership with a trading house could yield substantial income.  

At the Foundation Establishment stage, rewards grew—along with the difficulty.  

Li Shiming’s interest in enchantment wasn’t for profit but for his machine.  

Even subpar metals, when enchanted with Fortification runes, would resist deformation under extreme conditions.  

Tooling was simpler—custom-made low-grade artifacts could be refined further in the computer room space with the Sword Base.  

The machine wasn’t operational yet, but its mere presence filled Li Shiming with pride.  

This was the dawn of his personal industrial revolution. Once activated, it could manufacture any complex machinery he needed.  

With the Yun Trading House’s help, most raw materials were accessible. For the rest, he’d find alternatives.  

It was a process of problem-solving, blending the best of both worlds—technology and cultivation—to achieve his goals.  

Next, Li Shiming took out the formation materials he had purchased and crafted new formation flags. After completion, he placed them near the spiritual vein for nurturing.  

He decided against using the Spirit-Gathering Plate in the underground space anymore—each removal disrupted the spiritual energy accumulation, slowing his clone’s progress with the *Five Elements Absorption Technique*.  

While the plate was precious to ordinary Qi Refining disciples, Li Shiming, with his formation expertise, could replicate its effects—even improve upon them.  

Finally, he retrieved the Soul-Calming Incense—the most expensive item on his order at 100 spirit stones per stick.  

These ten sticks accounted for over half his expenditure, highlighting the steep costs of cultivating beyond standard Qi Refining methods.  

Among Qi Refining disciples, the incense was typically used to recover from qi deviation during advanced cultivation.  

Even Foundation Establishment cultivators found it useful for mental recovery during spiritual training.  

Thus, Yun Ze had assumed the order was for a qi-deviated disciple, never guessing it was for Li Shiming’s own spiritual cultivation.  

Holding an incense stick, Li Shiming hesitated. Should his main body train first, or the clone?  

The clone had practiced the *Ice Heart Jade Mind Technique* before, but its original soul had vanished, replaced by a new corpse-spirit. He wasn’t sure if any remnants of spiritual sense remained.  

The clone’s current state was bizarre—a fusion of life and death, freely switchable, defying conventional understanding.  

"Let the clone try first," he decided, lighting a stick within the computer room space.  

His consciousness fully merged with the clone as he focused his mental energy according to the technique.  

The incense’s fragrance filled the clone’s lungs, bringing unprecedented clarity—like a bucket of ice water poured over the mind.
