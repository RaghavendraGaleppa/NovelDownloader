# Chapter 28: The Completed Formula

The red-haired elder was visibly excited when he saw Jiang Li, instantly teleporting to his side and pulling him inside by the arm. The strength in that grip was impossible to resist, leaving Jiang Li no choice but to be dragged along helplessly.

Just as the elder had said, five bottles of pills were arranged on the table. The elder himself looked haggard, his Taoist robe stained black, his hands and face covered in pill residue—clear signs he hadn't left the alchemy chamber for a long time.

From the previous trial runs, it was evident that the Hardened Skin Pill was nearing completion, reaching a critical juncture. That was why the elder was so excited, even presenting five different modified formulas for Jiang Li to test. 

It was as if he didn't care whether Jiang Li lived or died.

"Junior Brother Jiang Li! You look terrible! Are the side effects from last time still lingering, or have they gotten worse?" Xiao Si, noticing Jiang Li's pallor, immediately grew concerned and tried to intercede on his behalf. 

"Master! Shouldn’t we wait a bit longer before testing the pills? Junior Brother Jiang Li’s body can’t take much more!"

But the red-haired elder remained unmoved, completely ignoring Jiang Li’s condition. 

"Nonsense! The formula is at a critical stage! Do you want all our efforts to go to waste?" 

"Don’t say such things again. Once the testing is done, I’ll prepare some restorative pills to help Jiang Li recover."

The towering, fiery-haired elder, standing over two meters tall, glared fiercely—enough to make any child under eight wet themselves in fear. Xiao Si, scolded into tears, could only watch worriedly, not daring to say more.

Indeed, when comparing the value of a mid-tier Yellow-grade pill formula to that of an outer sect disciple, the choice was obvious.

"Senior Sister Xiao Si, don’t worry, I’ll be fine." 

"Once the Hardened Skin Pill is perfected, I’ll take the time to rest properly."

Jiang Li reassured her before picking up the pills on the table and swallowing them one by one.

Truth be told, these experimental versions of the Hardened Skin Pill were already much weaker than the original. Despite Jiang Li’s help in testing, the elder’s alchemical skills were still lacking. Some side effects baffled him entirely, forcing him to dilute the potency bit by bit to mitigate the issues. 

The current version only enhanced skin defense by 35%, a 15% drop from the first complete version Jiang Li had tried. 

This effect barely met the criteria for a mid-tier Yellow-grade pill—the elder’s last stand. Any weaker, and not only would the pill’s grade drop drastically, but its defensive boost would also become negligible, rendering it useless.

Without further ado, Jiang Li began testing them one after another.

**[Consumed Experimental Hardened Skin Pill...]**  

This one caused muscle stiffness. What good was enhanced defense if he couldn’t move? Clearly unacceptable.  

**[Consumed Experimental Hardened Skin Pill...]**  

This one had no side effects, but the hardened skin patches were scattered randomly like spots on a Dalmatian—no good.  

**[Consumed Experimental Hardened Skin Pill...]**  

This one caused three days of hair loss? Well... that didn’t affect combat. Maybe keep it as a backup option.  

**[Consumed Experimental Hardened Skin Pill...]**  

This one seemed to have no effect at first. Wait, this was interesting...  

**[Consumed Experimental Hardened Skin Pill...]**  

This one caused unstoppable nosebleeds for half an hour. No thanks—mid-battle, enemies might mistake him for a pervert.  

After consuming all five pills, Jiang Li wiped the twin trails of blood from his nose and excitedly pushed the middle bottle toward the elder.  

"Elder! Success! We finally have it!"  

"This is the one! This is it!"  

Blood still dripping, Jiang Li feigned incoherent excitement.  

"Really? Truly? No side effects at all?"  

The elder was overjoyed but still skeptical.  

"Elder, after taking this pill, my scalp just itched a little, and I lost some hair—nothing else."  

Jiang Li wiped his bloody hand over his head, pulling away a clump of about a hundred strands. But that was all.  

"Hahaha! Excellent! A few lost hairs don’t count as side effects! It’s done! I’ve really done it!"  

The elder was ecstatic, even tossing a Hair-Loss Hardened Skin Pill into his own mouth. After a moment, his joy only grew.  

While the two celebrated, Xiao Si wore an expression of disgust and took a subtle step back, distancing herself from the pill.  

A mid-tier Yellow-grade pill might seem like a low-ranking achievement, hardly significant.  

But... economic value isn’t determined by grade alone.  

A limited-edition supercar is expensive and profitable, sure.  

But can it really out-earn mass-produced electric scooters sold worldwide? Impossible.  

Similarly, in the cultivation world, Heaven-grade pills were practically unheard of.  

Even Earth-grade or Mystic-grade pills, which might take a decade to refine a single batch, couldn’t compare in profitability to widely used pills like Qi-Nourishing Pills or Qi-Restoring Pills.  

Practical, simple, and mass-producible—those were the real moneymakers.  

As a combat consumable, the Hardened Skin Pill wouldn’t outsell basic pills, but its practicality and affordability ensured its value.  

"Xiao Si, clean up this trash, then take your junior brother to the Alchemy Hall to register."  

With the formula complete, the failed versions were instantly deemed worthless.  

But Jiang Li still had his uses—instead of being discarded, the elder kept his promise, instructing Xiao Si to register him as a nominal disciple.  

"Yes, Master!"  

"Thank you, Elder—no, thank you, Master!"  

Jiang Li corrected himself mid-thanks, while the elder continued laughing heartily.  

As Xiao Si began clearing the table, Jiang Li hurriedly took over.  

"Senior Sister Xiao Si, let me handle this!"  

He gathered the remaining failed bottles into his arms, his enthusiasm warming Xiao Si’s heart.  

She thought, *With this junior brother around, maybe some of my workload can finally be shared.*  

"Come, Junior Brother Jiang Li. Let’s clean up that blood first, then I’ll take you to register."  

"Of course, thank you, Senior Sister."  

Earlier, to make himself look worse, Jiang Li had deliberately left the nosebleed effect active.  

Now that things were settled, he promptly removed the status.  

After freshening up in the washroom, he returned and tossed the four bottles into the waste bin.
