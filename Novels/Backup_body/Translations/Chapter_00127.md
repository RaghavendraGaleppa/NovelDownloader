# Chapter 127: Flesh That Never Ages! A Soul That Never Perishes!

The vast sea roared with towering waves as a ship cut through the turbulent waters. 

The Nine Spirits Immortal Island, one of the three great immortal islands of the Eastern Sea, had been struck by a falling celestial star, forming a hidden realm. None who entered had ever returned, turning it into a forbidden land. 

Rumors spread that where the celestial star had fallen, all life had perished, leaving nothing behind. The island had become a forbidden zone of the Eastern Sea. 

Those disciples of the Nine Spirits Immortal Island who had been away and failed to return now found themselves as stray dogs, bereft of their home. 

Especially after the island's destruction, some of its elders and true disciples, carrying the island's treasures or secrets, became prey in the eyes of other factions. 

The island's core cultivation techniques and secret arts alone were enough to tempt any power. Moreover, the disciples of the island had long carried an air of arrogance. If they had offended any faction in the past, those who had once feared the island's might and swallowed their grievances now saw an opportunity for revenge. 

"Eldest Brother, news came this morning that Elder Jiang Xu of the Supreme Elder rank has been 'invited as a guest' by the Penglai Immortal Island," a young man reported in a low voice, his expression heavy with sorrow. 

The so-called "invitation" was nothing more than a polite term for capture. As a Supreme Elder of the Nine Spirits Immortal Island, Jiang Xu—a Human Immortal—undoubtedly knew many of the island's secrets and was well-versed in its techniques and arts. 

By extracting Jiang Xu's knowledge, Penglai Immortal Island could bolster its own foundation. Moreover, if they could subdue him, they would gain another Human Immortal-level powerhouse. 

"At least Penglai is one of the three great immortal islands. They won't treat him too harshly," said the young man addressed as Eldest Brother, his brow furrowed. "It's the other first-rate sects of the Eastern Sea and those ruthless heretical factions we should worry about—they won't hold back!" 

For Penglai, capturing the disciples of Nine Spirits Immortal Island was a boon, enriching their foundation, but it was merely icing on the cake. 

For other factions, however, the island's secrets, techniques, and methods represented the "supreme methods" they had long lacked—keys to elevating their own strength and achieving the status of an "immortal island." 

"Our sect was destroyed by a celestial star, struck by divine punishment. Now, those of us disciples who were outside the island are walking treasures just by virtue of the techniques and arts we carry," sighed the Eldest Brother. 

"A common man's wealth is his own ruin. And given our origins, even the most ordinary items on us—spirit stones, magical tools, talismans, elixirs—are treasures beyond the reach of ordinary cultivators." 

He glanced at his junior brothers and sisters and sighed again. "Even a Human Immortal like Elder Jiang Xu was surrounded and captured by Penglai. What chance do we have?" 

"What should we do now?" asked a young woman. 

"Hide our identities, change our names, find a place to recuperate," the Eldest Brother replied. "We must search in secret for other elders and disciples scattered outside, gather our strength, and only then can we stand firm in this vast sea." 

"According to the latest news, the closest to us is Senior Brother Haoyang, but that was half a month ago. We don't know if he's still there," another young man said quietly. 

"After half a month, if he's still there, he's likely already been captured," the Eldest Brother said with a strange expression. "But since we're nearby, we might as well investigate. Maybe we can find traces of him." 

This Junior Brother Haoyang had long been at odds with him. 

Both were at the peak of the Qi Refining Realm. Years ago, they had competed for the position of Chief Disciple, and the Eldest Brother had prevailed, becoming the island's Young Master. 

Haoyang had never accepted this, and their relationship had remained strained. 

But now, with the Nine Spirits Immortal Island destroyed, their foundation lost, they were like driftwood—or stray dogs. 

At this point, no matter their past grievances, they had to unite to preserve the last remnants of their sect's legacy. 

After all, they were still brothers of the same sect. Faced with such a catastrophe, how could they cling to old grudges? 

As they approached a nearby island, the group hid in the ship while the Eldest Brother, Hao Jian, along with a young man and woman, went ashore to investigate. 

The island was small but densely populated, home to a sect founded by a Human Immortal. However, in the centuries since, none of its descendants had broken through to the Human Immortal Realm. The strongest among them were only at the peak of Qi Refining. 

Junior Brother Haoyang had once been sent here to help the island fortify its defenses against tidal waves and sea monsters, forging a bond with its people. 

His recent visit had two purposes: to meet friends and to collect tribute, as the island was a vassal of Nine Spirits Immortal Island. 

But now that the island was gone, these vassal territories could no longer be trusted, nor could they expect any tribute. 

Hao Jian only wanted to confirm whether Haoyang was still here. 

After some investigation, he learned that Haoyang had recently been taken away by the Violet Tide Dao Sect. 

The Violet Tide Dao Sect was a first-rate sect, second only to the immortal islands. To capture a peak Qi Refining expert from an immortal island, they must have either ambushed him with overwhelming numbers or sent a Human Immortal to intervene. 

"Retreat!" 

Hao Jian and his two companions purchased supplies, loaded them onto the ship, and left the island. 

But before they had traveled a hundred li, they spotted a figure floating in the sea. 

"Hmm?" 

Hao Jian focused his gaze and his heart lurched. "That's the attire of Nine Spirits Immortal Island! Rescue him!" 

When they pulled the man aboard, they were shocked to find it was Junior Brother Haoyang. 

Half an hour later, Haoyang awoke, exhausted, and recounted how he had been captured by the Violet Tide Dao Sect and later escaped. 

Finally, with a complex expression, he looked at the Eldest Brother before him. 

"The Violet Tide Dao Sect is searching for our sect's supreme treasure, the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron. Rumors say... it's in your possession." 

Haoyang's voice was low. "That is the symbol of the sect leader, one of the three great treasures of our island. Did you truly receive it?" 

The cauldron was not just a treasure—it represented the authority of the sect leader. Moreover, the island's six supreme techniques were inscribed upon it. 

"A celestial star fell, creating a hidden realm," Haoyang said. "The sect leader was unparalleled in divination. Could he truly have known nothing of such a calamity?" 

He stared at the Eldest Brother. "He must have known. He must have prepared. The Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron... is with you!" 

Hao Jian's expression shifted, and he moved to stand— 

But Haoyang suddenly spat out a sword beam aimed straight at his face! 

Hao Jian gathered his Qi to block it, but a searing pain erupted in his back. 

He looked down to see the tip of a bloodied sword protruding from his chest. 

Behind him stood another disciple of Nine Spirits Immortal Island, who whispered, "Eldest Brother... my junior sister is in the hands of the Violet Tide Dao Sect... don't blame me..." 

"The Violet Tide Dao Sect promised me that if I succeeded, I could swear an oath of eternal loyalty and become their Dao Child!" 

Haoyang rose to his feet, no longer appearing weak or injured. His eyes were cold and ruthless. "As the Chief Disciple of Nine Spirits Immortal Island, I've never accepted you..." 

Screams erupted across the ship! 

The last remnants of Nine Spirits Immortal Island's legacy were nearly wiped out here. 

"You dare betray the sect?" 

Hao Jian slumped to the deck, disbelief in his eyes. He turned his head to see his junior sister lying in a pool of blood, her delicate face frozen in fear and resentment. 

He glared at Haoyang, gritting his teeth. "The Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron is the hope of rebuilding Nine Spirits Immortal Island..." 

Haoyang stepped forward, his expression fierce. "Nine Spirits Immortal Island can be rebuilt—by me. It doesn't have to be you." 

With that, he struck out with a palm, unleashing a torrent of flames! 

But with a deafening boom— 

The deck beneath Hao Jian gave way. 

He plummeted through the ship and into the sea. 

The entire vessel erupted in flames. 

"Senior Brother Haoyang! The ship's formation has trapped us!" 

"He prepared for this—if he couldn't escape, he'd take us all down with him!" 

The flames consumed the ship, reducing everything to ashes. 

Hao Jian sank deeper into the sea, his consciousness fading. 

The sect leader had entrusted him with the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron, believing he could rebuild Nine Spirits Immortal Island. 

But now, the cauldron would sink with him into the depths, lost for who knew how long. 

"I was too trusting of Haoyang. My death is deserved. But the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron... buried at the bottom of the sea... I've dragged the last hope of Nine Spirits Immortal Island into the abyss..." 

Despair filled his heart—until suddenly, the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron within him emitted a radiant light, enveloping him completely. 

His mind reeled as an overwhelming flood of information surged into his consciousness! 

Still only at the Qi Refining Realm, he couldn't withstand the influx and immediately blacked out. 

Deep beneath the sea, a beam of light wrapped around his body and shot westward—a thousand li in an instant! 

At that very moment, on the western coast of the sea— 

Li Zhengqing stood with his eyes closed, wielding the Great Derivation Void-Shattering Sword Qi. One after another, his sword beams struck the sea, stirring monstrous waves. 

Each slash seemed to split the ocean itself! 

"Has the master gone mad?" muttered the Five Elements Creation Tree. "Even if he's gained some fortuitous encounter and his sword Qi can now force even Human Immortals to retreat, does he really need to practice swordsmanship in the middle of the sea?" 

"Of course he does. When I was three, I used to breathe fire for fun," said the Hanging Bird. 

"When I was young, I skipped stones across water. Who would've thought Brother Zhengqing, nearly a Human Immortal, still has such childlike whimsy," sighed Yuan Zhengfeng. 

"Maybe he's displaying his prowess to intimidate the factions watching us?" mused the Ghost Valley Spirit Official. "But his injuries aren't fully healed. Every sword beam strains his meridians and flesh. Why push himself?" 

"The master has always enjoyed self-harm. He even lets Duanlang bite him sometimes," the Five Elements Creation Tree added. 

"Flip! Flip!" chirped the Duanlang Gu. 

"..." The little dragon girl propped her chin in her hands, staring at Li Zhengqing as if he were an idiot. 

"..." 

Li Zhengqing ignored the chatter behind him. 

According to the golden fortune-telling, practicing his swordplay at sea for an hour would yield benefits. 

Though he didn't know why, he followed the guidance—even if it made him look like a fool in their eyes. 

"Huh?" 

Suddenly, the dragon girl perked up. She dashed past Li Zhengqing and dove into the sea. 

"What are you doing?" Li Zhengqing quickly retracted his sword Qi, afraid of harming her. 

"Whoosh! Whoosh!" she replied before vanishing beneath the waves. 

"Keep going?" 

Li Zhengqing obliged, carefully directing his sword Qi away from her. 

He glanced back. The Ghost Valley Spirit Official spread his wings and flew after the dragon girl. The Hanging Bird, carrying the Dragon Pillar of the Hall, followed suit. 

Deep beneath the sea, a beam of light streaked toward them at incredible speed, carrying a human figure. 

But suddenly, a massive tentacle lashed out, blocking its path! 

The light of the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron repelled the tentacle. 

Then two more tentacles appeared, then another—eight in total! 

A colossal squid, hundreds of zhang long, with glowing, intelligent eyes, had ensnared the cauldron and was dragging it into the abyss. 

But from the direction of the shore, a silver-white streak shot forth—a jade-white true dragon, thirty zhang long, its scales pristine, eyes gleaming. 

Though smaller in size, the dragon's might was undeniable. With a single swipe of its claws, it tore through the squid. 

Freed, the Nine-Foot Sacred Cauldron shot toward the shore. 

The jade dragon engaged the demonic squid in a fierce battle, churning the depths. 

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official hovered above the sea, observing. "There's something down there." 

He waved a hand. "Hanging Bird, intercept that light! I'll help the little one deal with this demon!" 

But before he could act, a figure emerged from the depths, standing atop a towering wave. 

"That is my mount." 

"..." 

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official shuddered, his face twisting in shock. 

The newcomer gazed at the battle below. "In the past, only flood dragons existed. Now, a true dragon walks the earth—a being equal to gods and immortals." 

He turned to the Ghost Valley Spirit Official and sighed. "If true dragons are real, and deities walk among men, how could there be no true immortals in the heavens? This time, though I failed to find the immortals above, I've witnessed a fallen immortal in the mortal realm." 

His eyes dimmed. "Little one, since thirteen hundred years ago... we've been wrong. Everything... has been under their control." 

"Is it really you?" 

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official's expression shifted wildly. "After all these years... you're still alive?" 

His mind reeled with disbelief. 

He had expected this man to still live—but not that he would endure for nearly two thousand years, his flesh unaged, his soul undying! 

The First Generation Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World Heavenly Venerable of the Golden Ship of Salvation!
