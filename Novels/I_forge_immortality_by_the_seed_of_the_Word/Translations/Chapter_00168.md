# Chapter 165: Strike! Overwhelming Power!

"Don't go any further, run away now!"

On one of the viewing platforms in the middle layer of the Jiaoyun Secret Realm, a beautiful woman in her twenties clenched her fists unconsciously, her gaze fixed intently on the twenty-ninth competition arena, her eyes filled with concern.

In her line of sight, Zhang Jing, whose face appeared extremely young, was walking step by step into the dense forest ahead, seemingly without any precautions.

Yet in the dark shadows of the forest, eleven cultivators lay hidden in ambush, waiting to strike. These individuals had suppressed their auras to the extreme, their formation spread out like an open net, quietly awaiting their prey to walk right in.

The tension was palpable.

Just watching this scene made the woman feel as if she were suffocating.

"How shameless of these people! Not only are they robbing others, but they're also ganging up on a single person—and they're planning to ambush him from the shadows!" she fumed, her red lips pursed in anger.

Beside her, a young man of similar age, sensing her concern, followed her gaze. After a moment, he said with a hint of jealousy, "Someone so young coming to participate in the Jiaoyun Secret Realm... probably from some backwater place, clueless about how things work, just rushing in at the mention of the Jiaoyun Secret Realm. But Yun'er, you can't blame those people for ganging up or ambushing him. After all, there's no rule in the secret realm that forbids such tactics."

"If anything, he shouldn't have taken that golden decree."

"That's just twisted logic!" the woman retorted, glaring at him sharply.

"This is the reality of the immortal path. Treasures always belong to those with 'virtue,'" the man replied, a complex look flashing in his eyes as if recalling something.

"With this Jiaoyun Decree in hand, I can just find a quiet place to wait out the remaining twenty days until the first round ends," Zhang Jing mused to himself, a faint smile flickering in his eyes.

Holding the Jiaoyun Decree, the weight in his heart finally lifted.

As for continuing to search for other Jiaoyun Decrees—the thought crossed his mind briefly before he dismissed it. The effects of the decrees didn't stack, so there was no point wasting effort on it.

He would much rather spend the time meditating and preparing for the next round—or even the competition for the top rank among Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Before entering the competition arena, he had vaguely sensed that among the many Foundation Establishment cultivators participating in the Jiaoyun Secret Realm, there were some formidable opponents. Securing the top rank might not be as easy as he had initially thought.

Especially with the rules of the first round, Zhang Jing saw many uncertainties ahead.

Lost in thought, Zhang Jing suddenly halted, his gaze sweeping his surroundings.

The area was dimly lit, with towering ancient trees blocking out the sky, creating an illusion of peace and tranquility.

Yet, in Zhang Jing's perception, faint traces of hostility continuously emanated from the shadows around him. Most people, unable to extend their spiritual sense, might not detect this subtle hostility.

But the primal instincts of the Moonlight Python Devouring Qi Seed, which had granted Zhang Jing the physique of a python, were exceptionally sensitive to such things.

"One, two, three..."

He began counting aloud, his clear voice echoing through the shadowy ancient forest—completely unbothered by the ambush.

---

On the other side, the burly man with a fierce expression among the ambushers frowned in confusion when he saw their prey suddenly stop. Then, hearing the counting, his bewilderment deepened. He glanced back at their leader, his eyes asking: *Why isn't he moving forward? What's he counting for?*

Meeting his gaze, the black-robed leader also looked puzzled—until Zhang Jing stopped at eleven.

Then, realization struck.

"Stop hiding, attack now! Damn it, he's counting us!" the black-robed leader roared in fury, his voice drowning out Zhang Jing's and startling the birds and beasts in the forest.

At his command, the hidden attackers hesitated briefly before unleashing their assault.

In an instant, violent surges of mana surrounded Zhang Jing.

Swords, spears, halberds, and all manner of magical artifacts shot out from different directions. Within half a breath, they intertwined like a net above Zhang Jing, carrying a terrifying aura as they descended toward him.

Every ancient tree in their path was reduced to dust.

The air itself groaned under the pressure.

Simultaneously, dozens of powerful talismans were activated, flying toward Zhang Jing like a storm. Alongside them came a barrage of spells—some icy, some heavy, some razor-sharp.

The combined forces churned the spiritual energy within dozens of miles into chaos, making it nearly impossible to manipulate.

The black-robed leader stared fixedly at Zhang Jing, searching for the fear he expected to see.

*So what if he noticed us? He didn’t even run—he actually counted us out loud! Bet he didn’t expect us to be so prepared,* he thought smugly.

But his triumph lasted less than half a breath.

A sudden burst of five-colored light illuminated the terror in his eyes.

A massive hand had appeared out of nowhere, each finger shimmering with a different hue, interwoven with five distinct Dao Intentions. As they flowed, they exuded a harmonious balance of the Five Elements.

The colossal palm descended slowly—yet with impossible speed.

The overwhelming display of power from the eleven attackers was instantly drowned out by the radiant five-colored brilliance.

The net of artifacts? The storm of talismans and spells?

In an instant, they vanished like snowflakes falling into molten lava.

**Boom!**

A palm-shaped crater over thirty feet deep appeared on the ground, the five-colored light surging outward, clearing the area in all directions.

The ambushers were exposed, their faces frozen in horror.

In the next moment, ten flashes of white light appeared—the competition arena's protective mechanism activating, teleporting them out of the secret realm.

At the very back, the sole remaining black-robed figure scrambled backward in panic, transforming into a shadowy streak as he fled.

Beneath his hood, his face was twisted in terror.

*Five Dao Intentions!*

That casual strike from his opponent had contained five powerful Dao Intentions—and they were the Five Elements, perfectly balanced and reinforcing each other.

Worse yet, all five seemed to be at the Great Perfection stage.

The sheer terror of it was unimaginable.

*A monster! He must be one of those freaks from a top-tier legacy faction!*

Regret flooded his heart.

*Why did I let greed get the better of me? Now everything’s lost!*

Just then—

**Clink!**

The crisp sound of clashing artifacts rang in his ears.

A chill ran down his spine.

He turned his head stiffly, only to see a shimmering five-colored river—like a massive chain—streaking across hundreds of feet toward him.

In that moment, there was no escape.
