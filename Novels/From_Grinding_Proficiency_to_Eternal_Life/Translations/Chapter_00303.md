# Chapter 303: The Abyss Depths

However, in the right formation, Wu Ming of the Cold Crow Peak crossed his fingers beneath his chin. His blackened nails glimmered faintly in the shadows. The remaining few had their eyes half-closed, as if their minds were wandering far away. Even though Shen Wuya, seated at the very top, wore a smile, his body remained completely motionless.

Their apparent deafness stood in stark contrast to the enthusiastic response from the left side.

"Since half of the elder chiefs have agreed, the matter is passed."

Bi Yuan's expression remained indifferent. With a light sweep of his sleeve, he took the lead and stepped out of the hall.

"Please, everyone, follow me."

Cui Yu and the others naturally followed without hesitation. Shen Wuya paused for a moment before slowly trailing behind. Not long after, the group had followed the Sect Master to the edge of a sheer cliff.

Before them lay a thousand-zhang-deep abyss, as if a god had split the entire Clear Weeping Mountain in two with a divine axe.

Gale-force winds howled at the mouth of the abyss. Faintly visible below were black and red intertwined evil spirits, surging like living creatures at the bottom of the valley. Sometimes they condensed into the shape of blades, other times they transformed into fierce beasts.

Deeper still, the sounds of countless weapons clashing echoed incessantly, as if millions of vengeful souls were locked in a fierce battle at the bottom of the chasm.

"This is the entrance to the Sword Burial Abyss," Bi Yuan said, clasping his hands behind his back. His black Daoist robe fluttered violently in the evil wind. "When the Dao Sect was founded thousands of years ago, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was incredibly abundant. The founding ancestor used the 'Nine Heavens Thunder Summoning Technique' to split open the mountain's interior, using the earth's veins and evil spirits to nurture weapons. Before passing away, every generation of disciples would cast their personal swords into it."

Xu Yunfan focused his gaze and saw that the walls of the abyss were densely packed with weapons embedded in them.

The upper layers were mostly made of ordinary iron, long rusted into jagged, crimson shapes. About a hundred zhang down, weapons with chilling glows began to appear. The blades were entwined with various-colored sword auras. At the very bottom of the abyss, seven distinct beams of light swam like dragons. Every time they collided, they stirred up visible ripples of evil spirit.

"When I entered the abyss to claim a sword years ago, I saw a 'Black Ice Soul Sword' fly out from the bottom," Bi Yuan said. He lightly tapped a finger, and a beam of pure Yang true qi shot into the abyss, instantly causing dozens of weapons to hum. "But just how many divine weapons are there... even I am not entirely clear to this day. In short, there are many divine weapons inside. The accumulation of thousands of years is more than you can imagine."

At this point, a hint of a sigh suddenly crossed Bi Yuan's face.

Back then, when those Heavenly Demons invaded, the Dao Sect bore the brunt of the attack. The Sword Burial Abyss suffered many twists and turns—matters known only to the Sect Master, passed down through generations.

He suddenly turned his head and looked at Shen Wuya, a smile that was not quite a smile on his face. "Even the 'Azure Dark Sword' that Junior Brother Shen took away back then was, in reality, merely an item from the middle layers. I hear there are Eighth-Rank divine weapons inside."

Shen Wuya's expression stiffened slightly, and the fingers inside his sleeves clenched once more. The Sect Master's words were clearly meant to prick his pride. That he had failed to reach the true core of the Sword Burial Abyss back then was naturally known to Bi Yuan.

This old dog was clearly venting his anger due to Shen Wuya's actions in the hall earlier.

"It is now the third quarter of noon," Bi Yuan suddenly announced.

He raised his hand, and a shockingly powerful pure Yang true qi—so potent it made Xu Yunfan's expression change—erupted from his palm. Transforming into a ten-zhang-long crimson light, it struck the abyss.

Instantly, the surging evil spirits receded like the tide, revealing a spiraling bronze walkway descending down the abyss wall.

Bi Yuan solemnly instructed, "Remember, you only have four hours. If you see a weapon actively coming toward you, do not be greedy. In the Sword Burial Abyss, it has always been the person choosing the weapon, but also the weapon choosing its master."

"Yes, Master. I will keep it in mind!" Xu Yunfan replied.

Taking a deep breath, Xu Yunfan stepped into the Sword Burial Abyss.

In an instant, evil spirits as thick as substance rushed at him, as if thousands of tiny needles were piercing his skin, causing the muscles throughout his body to tense involuntarily.

The weapons within the abyss seemed to sense him, trembling and humming one after another. The sharp, piercing qi they exhaled carved deep and shallow marks into the rock walls.

He walked slowly down the bronze walkway. With every step, the bronze beneath his feet glowed with ancient runes, dispersing the evil spirits that tried to coil around him.

These were Daoist patterns carved by the ancestors of the Dao Sect when the sect's spiritual energy was still abundant. They possessed incredibly miraculous effects.

The rock walls on both sides were filled with embedded weapons: rusted broken blades, chillingly cold longswords, and strange, unconventional weapons, all glowing faintly under the nourishment of the evil spirits.

After descending a hundred zhang, the mist suddenly cleared.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. At the corner of the walkway ahead, a white-haired old man was sitting cross-legged!

The old man's eyes were tightly shut, and a green-bladed longsword lay across his knees.

The sword had no scabbard. Its blade was as clear as autumn water, and the sword aura it exhaled created a vacuum zone three zhang around the old man, even pushing back the evil spirits.

What was even more startling was that the old man's breathing was perfectly synchronized with the sword's hum, as if man and sword had long since become one.

"A high-level expert of the Dao Sect?"

Xu Yunfan's heart trembled violently. He subconsciously tensed his body slightly; the blood energy within him rose like a dragon and tiger. If the other party made any hostile move, he could react immediately.

Seeing that the old man showed no reaction, sitting as still as a boulder, Xu Yunfan cautiously sidestepped and walked around him, continuing his descent step by step.

"Quite interesting," a hoarse voice echoed through the deep abyss walls, laced with amusement.

At this moment, the white-haired old man had already stood up. His thin fingers gently stroked the longsword on his knees. The blade hummed, actually resonating with the evil spirits at the bottom of the abyss.

What was even more shocking was that as the old man stood, the surging evil spirits around him automatically retreated like subjects avoiding a king, creating a clear path on the bronze walkway.

The old man said no more. He simply followed Xu Yunfan at a steady pace. His footsteps and the hum of the sword were perfectly in sync, like some ancient rhythm.

Xu Yunfan, unaware of this, continued to descend rapidly. The old man's steps were not fast, but his figure was like a phantom. With a single stride, he would cross four or five sections of the bronze walkway.

A distance of a thousand zhang took Xu Yunfan a full hour to traverse.

When he finally set foot on the bottom of the Sword Burial Abyss, the sight before him took his breath away.

The bottom of the abyss was actually a bronze platform a hundred zhang in diameter. The platform was carved with intricate runes, and in the center stood seven copper pillars. Each pillar was wrapped in chains as thick as an arm.

The other ends of the chains disappeared into the bottomless abyss below the platform. Faintly, one could hear the creaking sound of the chains being pulled taut, as if they were restraining some colossal creature.

Even more astonishing was that dozens of divine weapons floated between the seven copper pillars.

A long spear, entirely crimson, from which magma-like liquid constantly dripped.
A nine-section purple-gold mace, each section wrapped in lightning.
An ancient bronze sword, upon which a dragon-shaped phantom perched.

Beneath these divine weapons, seven longswords swam like fish through the air. Every time they approached a copper pillar, the chains would tremble violently.

"The little娃娃 (kid) has good eyesight," the old man's voice suddenly sounded right beside his ear.

Xu Yunfan's expression changed drastically. When he turned his head, he realized the other party was already standing three feet to his side.

The old man's thin finger was pointing toward the bottomless abyss below where the chains on the copper pillars extended.

"If you want the top-tier divine weapons, they are still down there," he said.

Xu Yunfan subconsciously took a step back. The muscles of his entire body tensed instantly. Veins bulged on his neck like coiling dragons, and the blood energy within him boiled with a roar.
