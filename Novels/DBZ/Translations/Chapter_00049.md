# Chapter 49: Guests Follow the Host's Lead

The sudden voice immediately drew the attention of everyone present.

In the next moment, Wei Qian saw two green-robed cultivators descending from the clouds. One was at the fifth level of Qi Refining, while the other was at the fourth.

"Immortals! They're immortals!" 

Chief Yuan, his adopted son, and the others on the deck immediately dropped to their knees upon seeing the green-robed cultivators. Only one and a half people remained standing.

The one was naturally Wei Qian. The half was Chief Yuan's daughter, Yuan Mei. She had initially remained standing, but her father had grabbed her and forced her down when he knelt. Though Yuan Mei had trained in martial arts, her skills were no match for her father, a grandmaster of martial arts.

Wei Qian's unconventional behavior made him the center of attention. Even the two newly arrived "immortals" turned their gaze toward him.

"Brother," the fourth-level Qi Refining cultivator glanced at his companion, silently seeking his opinion. 

In their perception, Wei Qian was merely a mortal. However, they didn't act immediately—what if this person was a disguised cultivator?

Chief Yuan, already kneeling, whispered urgently with a hint of anger, "Brother Wei, don't be reckless! Offending immortals will bring you no good end! I'm only saying this for your sake!"

His concern was genuine, though only partially. The rest stemmed from fear that Wei Qian's "arrogance" might anger the immortals and bring misfortune upon him as well. He was already regretting having spoken to Wei Qian and bringing him aboard the ship in the first place.

"Elder Brother, he's definitely a mortal," the other green-robed cultivator carefully assessed before replying via sound transmission.

The elder brother trusted his sibling's judgment. Once, when they had posed as rogue cultivators to ambush a group, it was his younger brother's keen perception that had detected a hidden late-stage Qi Refining expert among them, saving them from disaster.

With this confirmation, the elder brother began contemplating how to deal with this insolent mortal. The two had traveled from a remote region to attend an auction, and after exhausting much of their energy and spiritual power flying on their artifacts, they had spotted the ship and decided to rest briefly.

The brothers were accustomed to being revered as exalted immortals among mortals. Never had they expected to encounter such an impudent fool on their journey.

Meanwhile, Wei Qian was pondering a similar question. 

*Is it just my bad luck that I always run into such people whenever I go out, or is the cultivation world's atmosphere so rotten that most cultivators behave this way?* 

After careful consideration, he concluded it was definitely the latter. It couldn't possibly be his fault.

He saw no reason to continue concealing his identity. Just as the green-robed cultivator stepped forward to speak, Wei Qian deactivated his *Breath Concealment Art*, releasing his spiritual aura.

The moment they sensed his power, the green-robed cultivator hastily withdrew his foot. The words of reprimand died in his throat, replaced by a forced smile that looked more like a grimace.

"So there was a fellow Daoist here all along!" 

Internally, he sighed in relief. Had he acted or spoken rashly, he might have made an enemy. His younger brother could even detect late-stage Qi Refining cultivators in hiding, yet he had failed to see through Wei Qian's disguise. Though Wei Qian only displayed mid-stage Qi Refining cultivation, the green-robed cultivator now regarded him as a Foundation Establishment expert.

"This ship is full. You two should find another place to rest," Wei Qian said indifferently.

In truth, the massive ship could easily accommodate dozens more people. But since Wei Qian's cultivation surpassed theirs, his word was law—even if the ship were empty, it was "full" if he said so.

"Of course, of course! We'll take our leave immediately. No need to see us out." With that, the two green-robed cultivators hastily mounted their artifacts and flew away.

The kneeling mortals on the deck witnessed everything. Chief Yuan looked up, his expression shifting between confusion and shock. His body trembled slightly.

"Brother Wei... you... you're an immortal?"

"Indeed. Eight years ago, I chanced upon the path of cultivation." 

Wei Qian raised his right hand, and a spiritual flame ignited in his palm, swelling into a fireball the size of a human head.

This undeniable proof left Chief Yuan's face flushed with embarrassment. Just moments ago, he had warned Wei Qian not to offend immortals—only to discover that Wei Qian himself was one, and clearly stronger than the two green-robed cultivators, whom he had effortlessly dismissed with a single sentence.

"Continue forward. That misty area ahead is where cultivators are gathering."

Wei Qian now held the highest status on the ship. His orders were carried out immediately, without Chief Yuan needing to repeat them. The adopted son didn't dare even look at Wei Qian anymore, kowtowing frantically as he passed by. Wei Qian ignored him—he had no intention of dealing with the man. If he wanted to kowtow, so be it.

Inside the ship, in a spacious cabin, Wei Qian leisurely took the seat of honor. Chief Yuan and the others followed meekly, sitting as guests without protest.

"Immortal Wei," Chief Yuan ventured cautiously after some hesitation, "does my daughter... have the potential for cultivation?"

Yuan Mei stared at Wei Qian with wide eyes, her breathing quickening with anticipation. 

*Immortal—what a lofty title! If I could become one too...*

Wei Qian thought for a moment, then beckoned Yuan Mei forward. "Come, let me test if you have spiritual roots."

"Go, quickly!" Chief Yuan urged in a hushed but excited voice.

Yuan Mei approached, and Wei Qian placed a hand on her dantian, channeling a warm current of energy into her body. After a moment, he withdrew his hand.

Meeting the hopeful gazes of father and daughter, Wei Qian shook his head regretfully.
