Chapter 56: Investing in Jiang Chulong, the Strange Princess (Consolidated)

Golden Destiny!

This was the highest destiny he had encountered so far, aside from Bing Tuozi.

Li Mo gazed at the data displayed by the Destiny Divine Eye and then looked at the frail beggar girl lying on the ground. The contrast between the two was staggering. He stood there, stunned, as if struck by lightning, ensuring he hadn't misread the information.

The youngest daughter of the Yu Dynasty Emperor! Born with a sword fetus! Li Mo's mind echoed with these descriptions, still struggling to snap back to reality.

Although Jiang Chulong's golden destiny was inferior to Bing Tuozi's, it still left a significant impact on him. He wasn't aware of how many powerful beings existed in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, but in terms of status and identity, who could surpass the supreme ruler?

No wonder Jiang Chulong had managed to maintain her golden destiny despite falling to such dire circumstances. For others, being plagued by a death-related fate would be considered fortunate.

"She must be the person Bing Tuozi is searching for!" Li Mo thought to himself, becoming increasingly convinced.

It dawned on him that Bing Tuozi wasn't looking for a lost relative or friend; instead, she had seen Jiang Chulong at some point and recognized her exceptional talent, prompting her to send Li Mo to find her.

"Big Brother Li, what's wrong?" Meng Can asked, raising his head in concern.

The other young beggars looked over, their expressions ranging from curiosity to fear.

Li Mo withdrew his intense gaze and said, "Bing Tuozi... if she's here, I'll... never mind." He composed himself and walked into the dilapidated house.

He placed his hand on Jiang Chulong's weak wrist and closed his eyes to sense her condition. Her vitality was faint, her internal organs were severely damaged, and she suffered from a serious cold, wound infection, and severe malnutrition due to prolonged hunger.

At this point, Jiang Chulong was like a fragile, leaking porcelain doll that would shatter with a single fall. For anyone else, death would have been inevitable.

However, Jiang Chulong's situation was peculiar; whenever her life force seemed about to extinguish, a mysterious energy would pull her back.

"What's wrong with Sister Jieba?" Meng Can asked cautiously.

Li Mo opened his eyes and replied softly, "Her condition is complicated, but she can be treated." Since Jiang Chulong's golden destiny didn't display any signs of a death-related fate, she wouldn't die, even if Li Mo didn't intervene.

After some contemplation, Li Mo removed the Fire Sparrow Feather Brocade Pouch from his chest and gently placed it in Jiang Chulong's hand. "This pouch will nourish her body. We'll need to wait until she's stronger before administering medicinal supplements."

As soon as the pouch was in her hand, Jiang Chulong's breathing became slightly more stable, and she stopped sweating cold sweat.

Li Mo heard the system's feedback prompt: "Congratulations, Host, for investing in 'Jiang Chulong' with a 'Fire Sparrow Feather.' Investment Return: Earth Pulse Spirit Milk. Do you want to receive it?"

Li Mo mentally responded, "No."

The young beggars looked at each other, their faces filled with joy. "Sister Jieba will be okay!" "Big Brother Li's medical skills are incredible!"

As they rejoiced, the eldest beggar returned with a piece of yellow salt, his head bowed. "Big Brother Li, we don't have money..."

Li Mo chuckled. "So, you're planning to invite me to dinner?"

The beggars looked at each other, embarrassed. Meng Can had never seen anyone as powerful as Li Mo; even the imposing guards were submissive in his presence.

Li Mo walked to the earthen pot and added rice and meat, effortlessly cooking a meal. "I've been away from cooking for two days, and I'm not used to it anymore."

The beggars watched in awe as Li Mo cooked with ease. "Big Brother Li, do you often cook in Qingyuan Sect?" "Yes, the food in the cafeteria is terrible."

As they ate the wild vegetable and lean meat porridge, Li Mo had secretly added a Five-Element Purple Spirit Pill, a precious item that could replenish one's vitality.

After the meal, the beggars were full and content. Li Mo watched them with a smile, and the system prompted him with information about "Da Zhu," one of the beggars.

Li Mo's investment in the beggars didn't yield any substantial returns, but he felt a sense of satisfaction.

Suddenly, he heard footsteps behind him. Jiang Chulong, with her eyes covered by a cloth, stood at the door, her gaze wary.

"You... you're..."

"Yes, I made the meal, and I gave you the brocade pouch," Li Mo replied.

Jiang Chulong tried to speak but stumbled and nearly fainted. Li Mo caught her and said, "You should eat first; don't worry about other things."

Jiang Chulong eventually returned with a bowl of porridge, the last one left in the pot. "You... you eat first..."

Li Mo was taken aback by her concern for him despite her own fragile state. "You're worried about me when you're still hungry? You're a strange princess..."
