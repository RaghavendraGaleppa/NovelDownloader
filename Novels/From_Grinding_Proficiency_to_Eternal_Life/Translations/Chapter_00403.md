# Chapter 403: The Unique Characteristics of the Demon Sect

Pushing open the long-sealed wooden door, sunlight poured in.

Xu Yunfan squinted his eyes, gazing at the towering Scripture Pavilion in the distance.

The path of cultivation is long. One should dabble in various arts such as Pill Refining, Artifact Forging, Talismans, and Formations.

After all, in this demon sect that devours people without spitting out their bones, having an extra skill means an extra way to survive.

With the Attribute Panel at his disposal, not cultivating would be a true waste of nature's gifts.

His main profession was smithing, and besides, the armor and weapons on his body needed modifications, so naturally, he paid more attention to the art of artifact forging.

He didn't hesitate any longer.

Xu Yunfan climbed the bluestone steps. On the mountainside of the Hundred Desires Peak, a gray-black building was built against the mountain. On its upturned eaves hung bronze bells that made dull sounds in the wind.

The Scripture Pavilion of the Hundred Desires Peak, like those on other peaks, was a place for the disciples of each peak to consult cultivation methods and scriptures.

However, compared to the solemnity of other sects' scripture pavilions, the outer walls of this one were covered with dark red vines, making it look as if it had been soaked in blood from a distance.

In front of the Scripture Pavilion was a small platform, paved with mottled bluestone slabs, with a few stubborn wild grasses growing in the cracks.

This scene looked truly desolate and lifeless; there were practically no disciples coming and going.

Xu Yunfan felt a bit surprised.

Logically speaking, the Scripture Pavilion should be one of the places where disciples gather most frequently in a sect.

But right now, there wasn't even a ghost in sight, which was truly unexpected.

Xu Yunfan walked closer and found that the door was carved with intricate formation patterns, with spiritual light faintly flowing within.

As soon as he reached out to push the door, a red light flared from the formation on the door, blocking him outside.

"New here?"

A lazy voice came from the side.

Xu Yunfan turned his head to see a youth in a gray disciple uniform leaning against a door pillar, playing with a jade tablet. "Entering the Scripture Pavilion requires three hundred contribution points."

Xu Yunfan frowned slightly. "So expensive?"

The disciple on duty sneered. "Think it's expensive? You can go to the Scripture Pavilions on other peaks."

He looked Xu Yunfan up and down, a hint of mockery in his eyes. "If you want to enter the Scripture Pavilion on other peaks as a non-disciple of that peak, the contribution points required will be doubled."

Xu Yunfan was silent for a moment, then took out his identity jade tablet from his robe. "I'll pay."

The disciple on duty took the jade tablet and lightly swiped it against the formation next to the door. Three hundred contribution points immediately vanished from the tablet.

He tossed the jade tablet back to Xu Yunfan, a meaningful smile playing on his lips. "Please."

Pushing open the heavy wooden door, Xu Yunfan stepped into the Scripture Pavilion.

The imagined scene of scriptures piled high like mountains and jade slips stacked in heaps did not appear. Instead, what greeted him was an empty hall, with only a few lonely bookshelves standing there, holding a mere handful of books.

"This..."

Xu Yunfan was momentarily stunned, and a wave of anger at being deceived surged in his heart.

Three hundred contribution points were a considerable sum even among outer disciples; they could be exchanged for many cultivation pills or a good amount of materials. And this was all he got for it—a hollow shell?

He finally understood why the disciple on duty had such a strange expression earlier; he was clearly waiting for a good show.

Xu Yunfan recalled what he had seen and heard on the Hundred Desires Peak over the past few days. The looks those fellow disciples gave the newcomers always carried a hint of amusement and anticipation. Now that he thought about it, they were probably waiting to see the newbies get scammed.

"As expected..."

Every single one of these people is a beast.

Xu Yunfan gave a bitter laugh and shook his head.

The rules of the Primordial Origin Sect were like this. Even if you know it's a trap, you have to jump in.

Those old disciples seemed to particularly enjoy this kind of pleasure in harming others without benefiting themselves. Even if they didn't gain any benefit, they were content as long as they could see others suffer.

He walked slowly to the nearest bookshelf and casually picked up a book.

The cover read "Introduction to the Hundred Desires Heart Sutra." Flipping it open, he saw that only the first three pages had content, while the rest were blank.

"This actually works?"

Xu Yunfan was so angry he almost laughed.

He put down this "scripture" and checked a few others. The situation was more or less the same; either the content was incomplete or it was some irrelevant miscellaneous notes.

Clearly, these were just filler items, nothing more than some inconsequential, even completely unrelated, books. There were even a few volumes of "Liu Huangshu"!

Xu Yunfan put down the book with an expressionless face.

If he ever had the capability in the future, he would definitely smash this entire Hundred Desires Peak to pieces.

There were also a few jade slips in the corner of the hall. Xu Yunfan picked one up and poured his consciousness into it, discovering that it recorded a dual-cultivation technique called "Joyful Union Art," but the crucial parts had been deliberately erased.

Even such a low-level method had its cultivation secrets hidden.

Truly shameless to the extreme!

"No wonder the disciples of the Hundred Desires Peak are all like this..."

Xu Yunfan remembered the strange looks his fellow disciples had given him.

Aside from the true scripture of the Hundred Desires Swallowing Yuan Great Method received upon entry, everything else had to be exchanged for with contribution points. And the Scripture Pavilion had clearly scammed many people.

Cultivators who grew up in such an environment would be abnormal if their psychology weren't twisted.

He walked to the window and looked at the distant mountains through the mottled window lattice.

The buildings on other peaks were faintly visible. There must also be a Scripture Pavilion standing there, and presumably, the situation wasn't much better.

The Primordial Origin Sect was truly worthy of being called the Primordial Demon Sect. Everyone was a beast, every place was a trap, and every step was a scheme. One could easily fall victim with the slightest carelessness.

Just as Xu Yunfan was preparing to leave, he suddenly noticed an inconspicuous small door in the corner.

He walked over and pushed it, finding the door locked, with a formation protecting it as well.

"Does this place also require an additional fee?"

Xu Yunfan had already figured out the套路 of the Primordial Origin Sect.

He looked around and, as expected, found a small stone tablet next to the door, which read: "Inner Room Reading: 500 Contribution Points/Hour."

"Truly obsessed with money..."

The corner of Xu Yunfan's eye twitched slightly. He was almost certain that even if he spent another 500 contribution points to go in, it would be almost identical to the outside. If there was any conscience left, the greatest possibility was that they would put a copy of the Hundred Desires Swallowing Yuan Great Method inside.

In a place like the Primordial Origin Sect, it was impossible to obtain true cultivation methods and scriptures without paying a price.

It was better to spend contribution points at the Primordial Origin Sect's exchange office than in the Scripture Pavilion.

This was another characteristic of the Primordial Origin Sect's disciples: after scamming someone, they would always leave a faintly visible path for you, allowing you to see a glimmer of hope in despair, and then continue walking on this cruel path of cultivation.

After all, if they truly treated all disciples as expendables, how could they cultivate true talent for the Primordial Origin Demon Sect?

In the end, they still had to cultivate some true talents.

When Xu Yunfan walked out of the Scripture Pavilion, that disciple on duty was still there. Seeing Xu Yunfan come out, he wore a meaningful smile. "How were the gains?"

Xu Yunfan didn't answer. He just gave the man a calm glance and turned to leave.
