# Chapter 28: Restart

Li Shiming closed the door to his study, located within the main house. The bookshelves were lined with ordinary books—none of the family's inherited classics were present. 

The texts needed for his examinations remained packed in the chests he'd brought, which he wouldn't have time to unpack until the next day. Not that he needed them, but maintaining appearances required the pretense.

With some urgency, he retrieved the Spirit Gathering Plate and removed the four depleted spirit stones from its slots. Carefully, he inserted four fresh spirit stones into the plate's indentations.

Studying the intricate patterns on the plate, he recalled the optimal activation sequence he'd deduced during twelve days of research. A faint glow of spiritual energy flickered at his fingertip as he traced precise lines across the plate's surface. The energy from the four spirit stones flowed into the plate, circulating through its channels.

Activating the Spirit Gathering Plate wasn't particularly complex—any pre-formed array only required understanding the energy flow's direction to activate it properly, as Fan Yiyang had explained. Having used the plate for a month, Li Shiming had recorded its operation extensively in his IBM z15 mainframe's memory. This allowed him to identify the most efficient energy pathways between the stones and plate, even without comprehending its underlying principles.

When the plate shimmered to life, forming a sphere of illumination, he knew he'd succeeded. 

Gazing at the activated plate, Li Shiming felt a surge of excitement. With it operational again, he could resume cultivating the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique" and have sufficient energy to practice other spells. Even his spirit rice cultivation would benefit—he could afford to cast the "Spring Rain Transformation Technique" more liberally.

Sitting atop the plate, he initiated the second-level circulation pattern of his cultivation technique. Soon, he sank into deep meditation.

After two hours, he opened his eyes, sensing the tangible increase in his spiritual energy. The relief was so profound it nearly brought tears to his eyes. Only after losing something does one appreciate its value—without spiritual energy, he'd lived in constant fear of regressing from the second to first layer of Qi Refinement. 

This wasn't an unfounded concern. Maintaining his second-layer cultivation had only been possible through daily consumption of spirit rice. Ordinary food would have caused his body to reject spiritual energy, leading to gradual decline. Fan Yiyang's immediate interest in purchasing spirit rice upon their first meeting underscored how vital spirit food was to cultivators.

Li Shiming didn't dwell on these thoughts. With a mental command, he stored the Spirit Gathering Plate in his server room dimension. He didn't bother deactivating it—with a hundred spirit stones in reserve and a means to earn more, the monthly expenditure of four stones was inconsequential. 

The server dimension also benefited from concentrated spiritual energy, which would become increasingly important as he cultivated more advanced spiritual plants beyond spirit rice.

"Master, when would you like your meal?" Siqin asked immediately when he opened the study door.

"Have the kitchen send it over. No need for you to attend," Li Shiming replied casually.

Siqin bowed in acknowledgment, though her disappointment was palpable. Recently, the young master had stopped allowing her to serve during meals, leaving her feeling slighted. 

Li Shiming paid no mind to his maid's moods. Until he revealed his cultivator status to his family, maintaining ordinary appearances was essential. During meals, he simply stored the food away to create the illusion of having eaten—his true sustenance came solely from spirit rice.

After his abbreviated meal and ablutions, he retired to his bedroom. Twelve days aboard the official vessel followed by intensive cultivation had left him mentally drained, and he thought no further on other matters.

As night deepened, the three-sectioned compound darkened like all its neighbors, sinking into slumber.

"Drought brings fire danger—mind your candles and lamps!" 

The night watchman's call and the rhythmic tapping of his bamboo clapper echoed faintly through the darkness—the third watch had arrived.

Li Shiming's ear twitched as his eyes snapped open. Since eliminating power conservation concerns, he'd maintained constant connection between his enhanced senses and the IBM z15 mainframe even while sleeping.

The sudden alarm blaring in his mind had come from the security protocol he'd programmed—a safeguard against threats during vulnerable states like sleep or meditation.

He remained perfectly still, maintaining the appearance of sleep while his heightened hearing analyzed faint sounds. Footsteps on roof tiles registered clearly, and his mind's eye visualized a figure in soft-soled shoes moving toe-first across the rooftop—real-time analysis provided by the mainframe.

The intruder's position was pinpointed directly above the main chamber. Their movements were so silent that without the mainframe's surveillance, Li Shiming would never have detected them so early.

His eyes tracked the figure's progress across the ceiling. Whether this was a random passerby or a targeted visitor remained unclear—until the telltale whisper of silk against brick confirmed the intruder was descending the exterior wall toward him.

This raised troubling questions. He hadn't even begun visiting his father's old friends—who knew he'd taken residence in the ancestral home? What grudge could prompt an assassination attempt on his first night in the capital?

The nearly imperceptible puncture of window paper triggered another mainframe visualization—the intruder inserting a bamboo tube through the breach.

"Poison? Or knockout fumes?"

The distinction mattered little. He held his breath instantly. In truth, most mundane toxins and narcotics were ineffective against a second-layer Qi Refinement cultivator. Only spiritually-enhanced poisons posed real danger—and anyone capable of procuring such wouldn't need to skulk about so cautiously.

Pale smoke wafted into the chamber. After a pause, a dagger slid between window frames, levering them open. The intruder slipped inside, landing with catlike silence that tightened Li Shiming's nerves.

From the intruder's flawless movements, this was clearly a martial arts expert. Though a second-layer cultivator, Li Shiming possessed alarmingly few combat techniques.
