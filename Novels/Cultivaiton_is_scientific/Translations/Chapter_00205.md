# Chapter 205: Purple Qi

Though Swordholding Peak wasn't particularly tall among the surrounding mountains, its location was excellent, unobstructed by any towering peaks that might block the distant horizon.

As the red sun leaped up from below the earth, all 1,500 Fresnel reflector mirrors atop the peak instantly reflected crimson light, converging on Li Shiming's body.

The ethereal purple qi—usually only perceptible when circulating the "Purple Qi from the East" technique within his body—now visibly manifested around him under the influence of the Fresnel reflectors.

As Li Shiming practiced "Purple Qi from the East" to absorb the first wisp of purple qi born from heaven and earth, he felt the energy pouring into every pore of his body. The Fresnel reflectors directed sunlight across his entire body rather than focusing on a single point.

The purple qi of heaven and earth could only be absorbed during the brief moment of sunrise before dissipating beyond reach.

Li Shiming absorbed vast amounts of purple qi into his body, where it integrated into every part of him. His spirit immediately felt invigorated, his mind clearer—a sign of enhanced mental faculties. His physical body experienced improvements akin to a breakthrough in body refinement, marking a significant overall enhancement.

This comprehensive upgrade confirmed the success of his experiment. While the 1,500 Fresnel reflectors didn't amplify the purple qi by the exaggerated factor of 1,500, he estimated at least a hundredfold increase in absorption.

Previous experiments had shown ordinary mirrors couldn't reflect purple qi—only Fresnel reflectors could. His analysis suggested the chaotic refraction of the rising sun's purple qi could be transformed into a unified directional reflection through his modified Fresnel mirrors.

This discovery dramatically enhanced the effectiveness of "Purple Qi from the East." If widely adopted, Fresnel reflectors could revolutionize the cultivation world. However, Li Shiming had no intention of sharing this innovation. Widespread use would only intensify competition over limited cultivation resources, ultimately harming the cultivation world. He wasn't inclined toward such altruism.

To prevent discovery, he equipped all 1,500 Fresnel reflectors with concealment arrays and self-destruct mechanisms. If the mountain peak's defensive array was forcibly breached, every reflector would automatically destroy itself.

With a hundredfold increase in purple qi absorption, each day's harvest equaled what others might gather in a hundred days. Even the excess qi that dissipated within his body provided gradual, subtle benefits.

After completing "Purple Qi from the East," Li Shiming capitalized on his surging vitality to practice "Vajra Protection Divine Art." A sip of spirit monkey wine summoned the wrathful vajra manifestation as he executed the foundational movements between motion and stillness.

Crisp cracking sounds echoed through his body—each pop marking strengthened bones, while muscles and skin simultaneously enhanced. The bone-cracking gave way to vibrations from tendons and contracting muscles, followed by drum-like resonances across his skin.

These physical sounds signaled substantial progress. Months of monkey wine-enhanced body refinement, combined with today's purple qi boost, finally elevated his physique to the Great Completion stage of the Foundation Establishment realm—nearly a year ahead of schedule.

The purple qi's converted energy, not fully absorbed during cultivation, transformed into specialized reinforcement reserves. As he practiced "Vajra Protection Divine Art," what would normally require a hundred days of purple qi accumulation was expended in rapid advancement.

This accelerated his body refinement to Great Completion—not an endpoint, but a state where further enhancement no longer required external resources, steadily pushing his physique beyond Foundation Establishment limits.

Previously, during Qi Refinement, his "Vajra Protection Divine Art" true intent manifestation and third-grade metal cultivation via "Sword Demon Secret Canon" had elevated his physique to match ordinary mid-Foundation Establishment body refiners. Now, this new breakthrough brought him to late-Foundation Establishment levels.

As an early-Foundation Establishment cultivator with ample time ahead, Li Shiming could continuously strengthen his body through perfected refinement techniques.

Post-"Vajra Protection Divine Art," his bulging muscles required subsequent "Sword Demon Secret Canon" practice to condense and further temper under third-grade metal infusion.

Standing up after sword cultivation, Li Shiming marveled at the explosive power coursing through him. Wielding his third-grade sword base, he felt confident challenging late-Foundation Establishment opponents in close combat.

Returning to his cave abode, he discovered an even greater surprise while practicing "Nine Heavenly Thunderbolt Technique"—a 1% increase in cultivation speed. While modest compared to the near 200% boost Li Yuanba's assistance provided during Qi Refinement, this improvement stemmed from his own enhanced aptitude rather than his clone's sacrificed progress.

"Could morning purple qi absorption really be this effective?" Li Shiming marveled at "Purple Qi from the East's" unexpected potency.

In truth, similar dawn qi techniques were common in Daoist traditions, but their efficacy depended on consistent practice—a challenge for Foundation Establishment cultivators who often entered prolonged seclusion, making daily sunrise rituals impractical. Thus, such techniques were typically abandoned after Qi Refinement, not due to quality but practicality.

The next morning's hundredfold purple qi absorption brought further mental and physical enhancements, plus another 1% cultivation speed increase. This seemingly minor technique was unlocking doors to higher realms.

Li Shiming immersed himself in this new routine—morning purple qi absorption, followed by body and sword refinement, with remaining time devoted to thunder technique cultivation.

Two months later, a summons from Master Su brought him to Heavenly Eye Peak.

"Junior Brother, we heard you've been secluded at Swordholding Peak without even paying respects to Master," Senior Sister Ye Jingxian chided upon meeting at the pavilion.

"Senior Sister, I think we forgot to tell Junior Brother about monthly visits," Second Senior Brother Xu Chuan interjected.

"Ah, right," Ye Jingxian recalled. "From now on, visit on the first of each month for collective greetings and guidance."

"Understood, Senior Sister," Li Shiming acquiesced.

"Can't blame us—he went straight into seclusion without socializing," Second Senior Brother Wan Zheng shrugged.

"Consolidating his breakthrough was priority," Ye Jingxian defended before advising, "Foundation Establishment is a marathon, not a sprint. You should network with other elders' disciples too—Elder Ma expects your visit."

Master Su's sudden appearance prompted bows from all five disciples. "Shiming, must I summon you annually?" he sighed.

"I'll adjust my schedule, Master," Li Shiming replied.

"Solitary cultivation has pitfalls. Seek guidance to avoid deviation," Master Su cautioned, acknowledging his disciple's dedication.

"So you've decided against changing your core technique?" Master Su inquired, having awaited this discussion.

"The 'Nine Heavenly Thunderbolt Technique' resonates with me," Li Shiming explained.

"Ah, your profound fortune—it must complement your Dao body," Master Su mused, recalling this was why he'd accepted Li Shiming.

Such compatibility was rare, as most cultivators had limited technique options. While sect heritage techniques offered established paths with shared resources, competition for those resources intensified at higher realms—precisely why Master Su and Elder Ji conflicted over singular advancement opportunities.

Choosing an unconventional path like thunder cultivation meant forging ahead without guidance, but with easier resource access given the lack of competing disciples.

"Your body refinement improved again?" Master Su noted with surprise.

"Yes, Master. I recently achieved Great Completion," Li Shiming admitted, presenting his remaining monkey wine—now ineffective for him but sufficient to guide another cultivator from novice to Minor Achievement.

"Fortune truly favors you," Master Su marveled at this serendipitous find, exemplifying Li Shiming's exceptional luck.
