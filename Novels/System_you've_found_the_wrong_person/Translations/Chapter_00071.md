# Chapter 71: Senior, Your Blade Isn't as Sharp as Your Tongue!  

Zhao Wudao.  

Known as the One-Eyed Divine Lord.  

Ranked thirty-third on the Earthly Rankings.  

The eldest among the nine sworn sons of the Great General, Prince Yan, Yu Yun.  

His disheveled hair obscured half his face, leaving only a single eye fixed intently on Dou Changsheng. A flicker of surprise crossed his expression—he hadn’t expected Dou Changsheng to choose him outright.  

This chaotic melee in the plaza had no rules—any means were permissible.  

Yet no one chose to hide, waiting until the last moment to emerge and claim victory.  

For the younger generation like Dou Changsheng, facing an Earthly Ranking master was a rare opportunity—a chance to test whether these renowned figures had been as formidable in their youth. It was a trial of fate.  

As for the Earthly Ranking experts, each carried their own dignity.  

Even those without shame wouldn’t resort to underhanded tactics in such a setting.  

After all, this wasn’t a life-or-death struggle, and reputation mattered. Moreover, every one of them was already under scrutiny.  

While Dou Changsheng chose Zhao Wudao, Jin Wuming confronted Du Changwang. Clearly, their encounter in Daliang City had left a sour impression on Jin Wuming. If not for Du Changwang’s status as a Pure Yang master, Jin Wuming would have already cut him down. Now, on equal footing, failing to land a few strikes would be a disservice to himself.  

Zhao Wudao drew the long blade at his waist—a weapon with a broad spine, a sharp edge, and an unusually elongated blade, distinct from ordinary sabers. It bore an eerie gemstone embedded in its surface, resembling an eye.  

A glimmer of light flickered across it, as if the eye blinked—an unsettling sight.  

Zhao Wudao spoke calmly, "I began training under my sworn father from childhood."  

"Back then, he wasn’t yet renowned—just an ordinary officer in the military."  

"The techniques I learned were all battlefield forms—broad, sweeping strikes suited for charging formations, not single combat."  

"This eye of mine was gouged out by a martial artist from the jianghu."  

"It wasn’t that I didn’t want to compensate for my weakness, but I simply lacked the means. Sects, noble clans, and dynasties all hoarded martial knowledge, rarely sharing it with outsiders. The path of a rogue cultivator is harder than ascending to heaven."  

"It wasn’t until I turned twenty-five that my sworn father earned the right to lead his own army. With a small force, he marched deep into Eastern Qi, capturing over a dozen cities in a single campaign, shaking the world."  

"From then on, he gained the favor of the late emperor, who imparted martial techniques and military strategies."  

"Thus, I too rose in status, obtaining my first supreme art. Only after studying it did I realize how wondrous such techniques could be."  

"A single day’s effort surpassed ten days of prior training. The purity of my true qi increased three to fivefold. The lifelong toil of an ordinary person couldn’t compare to a decade of mastering a supreme art."  

"It made all my previous struggles seem like a joke."  

"I don’t like you."  

"From the moment I first saw you, I despised you."  

"People like you—born into great clans—appear as if the heavens themselves favor you. You have the guidance of divine and mystical elders, the protection of the Nine Heavens Cloud Crane, respect wherever you go, and supreme arts within easy reach. Resources others can only dream of are things you wouldn’t even glance at."  

"*The Formation of Ten Thousand Armies* is my sworn father’s secret technique—the foundation of his martial path."  

"It was only through comprehending this art that he rose above the masses."  

"But the price he paid for it was immeasurable."  

"*A general who doesn’t understand astronomy, geography, esoteric gates, yin-yang principles, battle formations, or military strategy is but a mediocrity.*"  

"Those words are easy to say, but for my sworn father—with no teacher, no military texts—everything was pieced together through his own efforts, gleaned from overheard conversations and advice from other officers."  

"The world sees only his glory—his Eastern Qi campaign that shook the realm, his fame as a legendary general. But what I witnessed were the decades of toil behind that single battle."  

"You learned *The Formation of Ten Thousand Armies* far too easily. My sworn father showed you such favor, yet you sought to sow discord between him and his sons."  

"Every one of us brothers regards him as our true father."  

"He is the most important person in our lives. We’ve fought and bled together—I won’t allow an outsider to ruin this hard-won bond."  

Disdain, undisguised, was impossible to miss.  

Dou Changsheng had sensed Zhao Wudao’s hostility, but he hadn’t expected it to run so deep.  

Yet despite his contempt, Zhao Wudao had never acted against him. Had Dou Changsheng not provoked him, Zhao Wudao would have ignored him entirely. The root of it all was Yu Yun’s influence—this man revered Yu Yun as a god.  

Dou Changsheng frowned. Among the nine sworn sons, one had undoubtedly colluded with Chen Qingyao.  

The words of the Ageless Witch were trustworthy.  

At her level, there was no need to deceive him.  

Good advice is wasted on those doomed to perish. Had Yu Yun been present, Dou Changsheng might have spared some words—after all, the man had treated him well, imparting *The Formation of Ten Thousand Armies*. But Zhao Wudao offered no such incentive. There was no point in pressing a cold face with warm words.  

Dou Changsheng drew the Hero’s Sword and spoke slowly, "Let me correct one thing, Senior."  

"I am not from the Xiangzhou Wang Clan. I hail from a mountain village in the Northern Territories."  

"Every bit of strength I possess today was earned through my own efforts."  

(After all, the future Dou is still Dou. His hard work is Dou Changsheng’s hard work.)  

"And as you said, the world sees only my glory, not the sacrifices behind it."  

"Qingyang Daoist of the Three Suns Sect faked his death—I nearly became the scapegoat."  

"During the Northern Territories’ military payroll escort, I faced multiple ambushes."  

"Lately, misfortune has dogged my steps—a mere Innate Realm cultivator repeatedly dragged into battles between Earthly Ranking masters."  

"Anyone who survived what I’ve endured would naturally reap similar rewards."  

"I chose you, Senior, because I’ve mastered the Great General’s *The Formation of Ten Thousand Armies*. Since I lack the chance to demonstrate it to him directly, I’ll show you the results—so you may relay them to him."  

Zhao Wudao sneered at Dou Changsheng’s righteous demeanor. "Your words only make me seem petty."  

"Enough talk."  

"Let’s see what your so-called efforts have achieved."  

With a single slash, his blade light surged like thunder, erupting through the air with a deafening roar!  

Torrents of Innate True Qi surged like a raging river, overwhelming and unstoppable.  

Watching this, Dou Changsheng chuckled. "Senior, your blade isn’t as sharp as your tongue."  

His acupoints flared open, and Innate True Qi erupted like a flood. A single sword stroke sent it cascading from the heavens, drowning the earth like an apocalyptic deluge. The blade light was swallowed instantly, the tide surging toward Zhao Wudao.  

True Qi became soldiers, forming battle formations. Ten thousand troops charged—unstoppable.  

"Allow me to show you what *The Formation of Ten Thousand Armies* truly is!"

**Author’s Note:**  

Rather than a separate post, I’ll include my launch thoughts here.  

This chapter serves as a natural pause—necessary to ensure tomorrow’s subscription numbers look decent.  

The novel will launch tomorrow around noon, likely between 12 and 1 PM, depending on when the feature goes live.  

This story has been a passion project. My mindset has stabilized—even after failing to advance past the second round (where I’d usually drop a book, like *The Undying*, abandoned after 150 first-day reads), I persisted. This time, with just 100 initial reads and 50 the next day, I kept going, determined to prove my writing could still resonate.  

As a friend advised: *Give it your all. Test whether your work can still succeed. If not, adapt. Step out of your comfort zone, learn, and experiment.*  

So I stayed steady, fought through a week without promotion, and won the revival round, completing all four stages—mission accomplished.  

Next goal: 1,000 first-day subscriptions. Realistically, it’ll likely be 900, maybe 800+. Regardless, I’ll keep writing, aiming for 1 million words by New Year’s and an average of 2,000 subscriptions.  

Lastly, as always—please subscribe on launch day, and votes are appreciated!
