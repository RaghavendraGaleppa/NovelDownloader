# Chapter 32: The Beauty Nie Ying!

Outside the Hundred Machines Hall, Lin Yun led a crowd of two to three hundred people, completely surrounding the place.

"Where is that old bastard Ye Ming?!"  
"Come out here now!"  
"How dare you act but not own up to it?!"  
"A dignified mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator bullying a newly enrolled ninth-level Qi Condensation disciple—have you no shame?!"  
"Daring to steal from my brother!"  
"You've got some nerve!"  
"Who gave you the courage?!"  
"Go ask around! Han Li is my sworn brother—closer than blood!"

The Hundred Machines Hall was where disciples usually submitted and received tasks, so it was normally a busy place. Now, the sect members who had come to hand in or pick up missions were all gathered around, watching the spectacle. After asking around, they quickly understood the situation.

It turned out that Elder Ye Ming of the Hundred Machines Hall had seized the Foundation Establishment Pill from a new disciple who had entered the valley with an Ascension Token. Now, the aggrieved party had come seeking justice.

"Pah—that old dog Ye Ming deserves this!" one disciple spat. "Last time I handed in a spirit fruit collection mission, I submitted the exact amount, but that bastard withheld three and got me punished by the sect!"  

"That old thief is truly black-hearted! Once, I earned ten spirit stones from a mission, but he pocketed six and only gave me four, claiming he was 'holding them for me' until I reached Foundation Establishment!"  

"Exactly! If you don’t grease his palms regularly, Ye Ming makes life miserable—delaying mission completions or assigning the worst tasks!"  

"Rumor has it he even set up some shady faction through his lackey Ye Long, forcing disciples to pay spirit stones just to join and get the safer, higher-paying missions. Those who refuse are left with scraps!"  

Among the crowd stood a stunning woman in blue robes, her skin like polished jade, radiating an otherworldly beauty. Her name was Nie Ying. Though her family, the Nies, wasn’t one of the three great clans of Yellow Maple Valley, their influence was nothing to scoff at.  

A century ago, the Nies had sponsored a Thunder Spirit Root cultivator, who later successfully formed a Golden Core. That cultivator, Lei Wanhe, repaid the family’s kindness by taking Nie Ying—the most outstanding talent of her generation—as his disciple.  

Thanks to Lei Wanhe’s backing, the Nies’ status in Yellow Maple Valley had soared, placing them just below the three great families. Inspired by their success, the Chen family had tried to recruit the Wind Spirit Root prodigy Lu Yunfeng from the Lu family—though now that Lu Yunfeng was dead, their focus had shifted to Lin Yun.  

Listening to the Qi Condensation disciples’ grievances, Nie Ying frowned. She had always thought Elder Ye Ming was decent—after all, he treated her with utmost respect whenever they crossed paths. But now, the truth was laid bare.  

Born into privilege and raised under the wing of a Golden Core cultivator, Nie Ying had lived a sheltered life. Unlike the arrogant and domineering Dong Xuan’er, however, she had not developed a spoiled temper. Nor was she as cautious and self-serving as Han Li.  

Instead, Nie Ying was warm-hearted, always eager to help others and build connections. She despised those who kept to themselves. In her eyes, the Nie family’s rise was entirely due to befriending Lei Wanhe, so she sought to emulate that approach.  

Yet, her sheltered upbringing also left her naive, far too trusting for a cultivator.  

"Ye Ming! You thieving dog!"  
"Ye Ming! Scoundrel!"  
"Ye Ming! Coward!"  

The crowd’s chants grew louder as more disciples joined in, their pent-up frustrations boiling over. Most were powerless Qi Condensation cultivators who had suffered under Ye Ming’s exploitation. The elder always justified his embezzlement with lofty excuses, and those who dared complain faced dire consequences.  

Once, a disciple had reported him to the sect leader, only to be "reimbursed" before mysteriously dying on a monster-hunting mission soon after. Everyone knew Ye Ming was behind it—but no one could prove anything.  

Now that he had crossed the wrong people, they were eager to see him fall.  

"What’s all this racket?!"  
"Have you all lost your minds?!"  
"Are your tasks done?!"  
"Have you advanced your cultivation?!"  
"Have you even swept the mountain gates?!"  
"Lowly Qi Condensation trash, thinking you can sit at the table?!"  

Before the speaker even emerged, a barrage of insults erupted from inside the Hundred Machines Hall.  

Nie Ying’s frown deepened. She had initially wondered if Ye Ming might be wrongly accused, but his vile words erased all doubt. She had been deceived by his facade.  

Ye Ming strode out arrogantly with Ye Long at his side, sneering at the sea of angry faces through the hall’s protective barrier. But the moment he spotted Lin Yun and the Chen family members, his haughty demeanor crumbled.  

"Ah, Elder Chen! What brings you here?" he fawned, forcing a smile. "Had I known you were coming, I would’ve prepared spirit tea and welcomed you properly!"  

His sycophantic tone was a far cry from his earlier arrogance. Still, the old fox stayed safely behind the barrier, sensing the hostility outside.  

"Elder Ye, as the overseer of the Hundred Machines Hall, your power and prestige are unmatched," Elder Chen said dryly, glancing around meaningfully. "I’m just a withered old man with no influence left in Yellow Maple Valley. How could I presume to claim kinship with someone of your standing?"  

"Elder Chen, you flatter me! Tell me, what have I done wrong?" Ye Ming asked nervously, studying Chen’s expression—but the elder simply closed his eyes, refusing to engage.  

He truly didn’t understand. Every overseer in the sect skimmed a little off the top. Such gray-area profits were tacitly allowed—otherwise, how could anyone survive on the paltry single mid-grade spirit stone the sect distributed annually?  

"Old dog! Was it you who stole my brother’s Foundation Establishment Pill?!" Lin Yun pointed at Ye Ming and roared.
