# Chapter 121: Fellow Daoist, Why Resist?

As Lu Yang appeared, his vast, mountain-like power not only made Guang Hai's expression change drastically but also struck terror into the nearby Guang Ming.

Then, Guang Ming looked at his opponent, Qin Tianhe.

Perhaps it was a meeting of kindred spirits, or a fated encounter between formidable opponents. While the Pure Land and Sacred Sect fought to the death, these two were also locked in an intense battle. At this moment, with Lu Yang's appearance, Guang Ming and Qin Tianhe exchanged a glance, then tacitly moved their battlefield further away. As for Guang Hai's plea for help, Guang Ming turned a deaf ear, for he had already seen Lu Yang take out that terrifying banner.

Meanwhile, the other Buddhist cultivators obeyed Guang Hai's command. Seven Vajra Dharma Bodies immediately turned, intending to reinforce Guang Hai. However, almost simultaneously, Lu Yang also shook the Myriad Spirits Banner, and a stream of banner spirits emerged.

"Kill them all." Lu Yang gave the command indifferently, then turned to look at the grim-faced Guang Hai, who held a talisman in his hand.

The Life-Bonding Talisman! This Pure Land Fruition-stage treasure could directly teleport a marked individual to its wielder's side. Guang Hai had just attempted to teleport the Eight Divisions of Buddhist Deities over.

However, he failed.

The next second, he looked around again, only to find that the surrounding scenery had drastically changed. It was no longer inside a spirit treasure but had transformed into clear mountains and waters.

The Profound Abyss Stillness Scroll! Bestowed by True Lord Chongguang, this was True Monarch Clear Snow's Fruition-stage treasure, possessing the miraculous effect of locking down space. It had already been unfurled the moment Lu Yang appeared.

When Lu Yang found him, he couldn't escape!

Realizing this, Guang Hai finally accepted reality. His expression returned to composure. With a flick of his kasaya, he instantly unfurled twelve iridescent array diagrams, then his figure vanished into the deepest part of the formations. He clearly had no intention of clashing head-on with Lu Yang but planned to use the arrays to stall for time.

Lu Yang scoffed at this. "Fellow Daoist, why make a trapped beast's struggle? I have a perfect spot for you on my banner!"

As a seventh-rank formation master, he could tell at a glance that Guang Hai didn't truly understand formations. Although he had laid out the arrays, his aura wasn't integrated with the array diagrams.

As his voice fell, Lu Yang didn't hesitate, stepping directly into the array formation!

Seeing this, Guang Hai immediately shook his array flags without a word. The twelve grand arrays began to operate, and shimmering Buddhist light instantly congealed into a magnificent temple.

"Rise!"

Feeling the immense power emanating from within the formation, Guang Hai finally breathed a sigh of relief. These twelve array diagrams were actually part of a single grand formation. The complete version should have thirty-six. The formation itself was meant to be used in conjunction with the Eight Divisions of Buddhist Deities, capable of creating an environment infinitely close to a Pure Land, complementing them. This way, with the Eight Divisions of Buddhist Deities collectively borrowing an Arhat rank and the Pure Land environment created by the formation, they could unleash power truly comparable to early Foundation Establishment in a short period. Although there were only twelve now, for defense, it was still not something ordinary cultivators could breach.

Boom!

Just as Guang Hai was thinking this, before he could react, a loud bang echoed. The twelve array diagrams simultaneously shook and let out a crisp cracking sound!

The next second—

"Sky Collapse."

The first, the second, the third... under Guang Hai's dumbfounded gaze, the twelve array diagrams shattered at an astonishing speed!

Witnessing such a terrifying scene, Guang Hai didn't even have time to feel fear, still in a state of bewilderment. He had thought he had estimated Lu Yang's strength as highly as possible, but upon seeing it firsthand, he realized he had still underestimated his opponent. He couldn't help but ask the same question that Guang Hui had posed before his death:

"Is this person... a Foundation Establishment cultivator?"

Seeing the twelve array diagrams about to be breached by Lu Yang alone, Guang Hai had no time to think and could only take out a lifelike dragon-shaped pendant from his robes.

*Crack!*

Gritting his teeth, Guang Hai squeezed it with force. The pendant instantly shattered, and then a massive wave of Divine Sense surged forth, merging into Guang Hai's Sea of Consciousness.

*Whoosh!*

In an instant, waves rose without wind. Guang Hai's features gradually smoothed out, all panic and emotion vanishing, leaving only calm and serenity. Though still the same person, his eyes now glowed with brilliant Buddhist light, and his entire demeanor changed. He put his palms together, lightly chanted a Buddhist name, and his aura infinitely soared, reaching a level infinitely close to, yet still beneath, Foundation Establishment!

"Amitābha."

Resonating Buddhist chants, teachings like thunder, and a powerful aura spread with the sound waves, instantly alarming the Buddhist cultivators and Sacred Sect True Disciples who were locked in fierce combat.

"Things are getting hot, retreat!"

The Sacred Sect True Disciples were clearly pragmatic, immediately retreating and putting swift distance between themselves and "Guang Hai," not daring to approach his position.

The Buddhist cultivators, on the other hand, stirred with thunderous shouts and excitement.

"It's Venerable Fuluo!"

"Guang Hai is Venerable Fuluo's eldest disciple; did he summon the Venerable himself?"

"We're saved!"

Foundation Establishment! This was Foundation Establishment! Even just a wisp of Divine Sense was enough to make Qi Condensation cultivators flee in fear. No wonder the Pure Land was so confident this time; they truly had a trump card prepared.

However, just then, a loud bang echoed. The twelve array diagrams completely shattered, and the collapsing spiritual light poured out like a breaching flood. Lu Yang walked out from within, a sword rainbow circling his body.

Among all present, only his expression remained calm.

Seeing this, "Guang Hai" instead narrowed his eyes, showing an interested expression: "Benefactor, your spiritual roots are profound. Why not take refuge in my Pure Land?"

Though the voice was still Guang Hai's, it possessed an indescribable magic, each word a resonant pearl, like an old monk in a meditation hall gently tapping a wooden fish, making people involuntarily sink into it, shedding all distracting thoughts, and developing a desire to convert, to speak the secrets hidden in their hearts.

Named as taking refuge, it was in reality soul-searching!

"Bullshit, bald monk!" Lu Yang coldly retorted, his Foundation Establishment Divine Sense, cultivated through the Heavenly Silkworm Secret Art, exploded without reservation, directly dispelling the strangeness in "Guang Hai's" voice.

However, "Guang Hai" was even more delighted at this: "Indeed, it is the Nine Transformations Dragon Art."

Immediately after, he put his palms together again and laughed aloud: "Benefactor, why resist? Since you cultivate my true art, I am the karmic connection you cannot escape."

"...You're right." Lu Yang stared straight at "Guang Hai" with a sneer. "I do have a karmic connection with Fuluo. Unfortunately, you only resemble him; you are not the true Fuluo."

As his voice fell, the Myriad Spirits Banner shook. Dharma Protector Sunu stepped out from it, her status and aura, not at all weaker than "Guang Hai" at this moment, even far surpassing it, instantly erupted!

In an instant, the originally complacent "Guang Hai's" face slightly changed.

With Sunu's appearance, the Buddhist light that had previously emanated from "Guang Hai" dimmed once more, replaced by baleful yin, filling half the sky.

Seeing this, "Guang Hai's" smile gradually faded.

"Laugh, why aren't you laughing now?"

"Fellow Daoist, why resist?"

Lu Yang held the Myriad Spirits Banner, looking at the Fuluo Arhat as if he were a plump prey: "My banner is precisely in need of talent like you, Fellow Daoist!"
