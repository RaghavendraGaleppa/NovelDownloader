# Chapter 500: As Expected, It's the System

Lu Chunyang was powerful, yes, but could he possibly be strong enough to stand against all the True Lords in the world who coveted a higher realm and fought for a limited number of positions? The stronger he becomes, the more people will stand in his way. We shall see!"

After venting this fierce but hollow threat, the divine sense from Qixia Peak receded like the tide, retreating deep into its own cave heaven, and remained completely still.

The other divine senses also fell silent. Finally, the teasing divine sense from Yuheng Peak left a light,飘飘然一句: "Indeed, no matter how high the Way of the Sword, there are always shackles. The Great Dao is arduous..."

Then it too returned to silence.

The Twelve Sword Peaks returned to their quietude, only the low howl of wind passing through the sword forest remained, as if the invisible confrontation from before had never happened.

Lu Chunyang retracted his gaze, pondering how to take the next step.

In his eyes, the so-called Lord Qixia was nothing but a clown, truly laughable.

Even if he were to personally go to the Primordial Demon Sect and drink merrily with its current Sect Master, these people would only dare to be angry but not speak out.

The strong are always lonely; only the weak huddle together to exclude others.

Lu Chunyang's thoughts raced as he looked in the direction Xu Yunfan had left.

Perhaps, he had found a clue to his breakthrough.

***

Deep within the exclusive cave residence of the Garrison Commander at Cold Crow Pass.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged in the core meditation chamber. Layer upon layer of defensive formations guarded this place, watertight and impenetrable. Light circulated, isolating it from the outside world.

Now that his True Martial Subduing Demons Scripture had been stripped away, and the Purple Celestial Heavenly Gang Evil Qi had become another's dowry, he was left with only cultivation level but no combat strength.

Only by arranging layer upon layer of defenses through the Dao of Formations did he feel a slight sense of security.

But then again, although the cultivation from the True Martial Subduing Demons Scripture had all gone to his clone, Wukong, under the absolute control of the Attribute Panel, the clone's power was still his power. Perhaps he could give the Bodhi Pure Land a huge surprise with this in the future.

At this moment, through the Attribute Panel deep in his consciousness, he was sharing the vision of another "himself."

That was the perspective of the red-haired monkey, "Wukong," who had just broken out of the Xuanhuang Stone Embryo on the peak of the Eastern Wasteland.

He did not forcefully take control, but merely watched everything unfold through Wukong's sight. If he were to forcefully take control and seize Wukong, it might attract the attention of the World Honored One, Tathagata.

In the画面, the罡 wind howled.

The gaunt, mortal-bodied Tripitaka pressed his palms together, his countenance dignified and庄严. And the newly born Wukong, in the most devout posture, knelt before his master's blood-stained moon-white monk robes, kowtowing three times—"Thump! Thump! Thump!"—the impacts shaking the rocks, leaving a clear mark on his forehead.

Then, treasures were bestowed.

The Sea-Straddling Purple Gold Rod, neither gold nor wood, was a profound blue like an abyss. The body of the rod faintly revealed the patterns of a Black Tortoise coiled with a snake. When swung, it seemed to have the power of a vast sea surging forth, making the air thick and heavy.

It was a divine weapon refined from the Dao Rhyme of the *True Martial Subduing Demons Scripture* that had once bound the Stone Embryo's true body.

The Six-Word Golden Locking Golden Armor, its dark gold body woven with countless fine, scale-like Sanskrit characters of the Six-Word Mantra. Its treasure light was restrained. The "卍" character breastplates on the chest and back glowed with circulation, as if cast from the limitless merit and faith of the Buddhist nation. It was as gentle as jade yet indestructible.

Wukong, unable to contain his excitement, donned the armor and grasped the rod, resembling a Dharma Protector Vajra descending to the world. He repeatedly thanked Tripitaka: "Thank you, Master! Thank you, Master!"

Next came the transmission of the Dharma.

Xu Yunfan clearly "heard" Tripitaka's voice. Through a mind-to-mind transmission, the supreme battle art named the *Great Power Virtue Bright King Battle Tathagata Sutra* was imprinted into the core of Wukong's consciousness.

Though there was no sound, Xu Yunfan felt as if he had personally experienced the feeling of the sutra's true meaning surging through and cleansing his mind and spirit.

Transforming the Black Tortoise into the Bright King Who Subdues Hell, turning "Subduing Demons" into "Battle Tathagata."

The Vajra巨力 of the "Twelve Layers of Buddhist Power Golden Bell."

The destructive might of the "Tathagata Divine Palm" that shatters mountains.

A single spark in the heart that can purify all things—the Nirvanic Buddhist Karma Fire.

Wukong excitedly prostrated himself: "This disciple... understands! Thank you, Master for transmitting the Dharma!"

Finally, a grand Buddhist ritual began, covering the entire Eastern Wasteland.

Tripitaka made a great vow to traverse the tens of millions of miles of demon lands, subdue demons and vanquish fiends, establish a Pure Land, and welcome the descent of the position of the "Great Compassionate Light in the Lotus Supreme Sovereign Buddha."

And the newborn Wukong, holding the Sea-Straddling Purple Gold Rod and wearing the Six-Word Golden Locking Golden Armor, held his head high and said with a youthful yet resolute voice: "This disciple, Wukong, is willing to accompany the Master. To battle the hordes of demons, to protect the True Sutra! The demons are not yet eradicated, so this heart shall not rest!"

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan's consciousness in the shared vision let out a silent, cold sneer: "Heh... what a deep calculation, Bodhi Pure Land, Tripitaka monk. You want to establish a Buddhist kingdom on earth in the Eastern Wasteland, I wonder if the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Primordial Origin Sect will sit by and watch."

Even if the World Honored One Tathagata likes to bully newbies, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the Primordial Origin Sect are not without their own Lords.

Xu Yunfan calmed his mind and carefully comprehended this *Battle Tathagata Sutra*.

"This *Great Power Virtue Bright King Battle Tathagata Sutra*, on the surface, is compatible with Wukong's Stone Embryo Buddha Body and the foundation secretly containing the True Martial Dao Rhyme, making it peerless in battle.

Its essence, however, is clearly a custom-made bait, a bridge.

Its core purpose is to be maximally compatible with the projection of the supreme position of the 'Great Compassionate Light in the Lotus Supreme Sovereign Buddha'. It aims to completely transform Wukong into the most perfect 'Śāriputra' for the eastward transmission of the Bodhi Pure Land, to carry the position of the Sovereign Buddha!"

As his thoughts churned, Xu Yunfan's gaze fell on the exceptionally conspicuous line of special prompt on the Attribute Panel.

[Force Control Doubled].

Xu Yunfan's heart settled. His greatest cheat right now was naturally this Attribute Panel.

"I'm afraid no one would have thought that this clone, from beginning to end, every thought, every wisp of power, is under my absolute control.

Even if Buddhist light is poured into it, even if incense and offerings seep in, even if the so-called consciousness of 'Wukong' is nurtured, it cannot escape the brand my Attribute Panel has imprinted upon its origin core."

Under the Attribute Panel's Force Control, it was a power that completely transcended cause and effect. It did not bear Buddhist karma, nor did it inherit karmic links, yet it could reap the benefits without sowing.

Before, Grandmaster Lu Chunyang's Unreturning Sword Intent severed the visible karmic line, but the Attribute Panel severed an even more fundamental authority.

Most importantly, as long as he willed, he could take over the clone Han Shi, or the clone Wukong, at any time.

This *Battle Tathagata Sutra* was useless to him. If he were to practice it recklessly, he would likely suffer a heavy blow immediately. Only the clone Wukong could bear its karmic consequences.

Just wait and see the big surprise he would give the Bodhi Pure Land.

He did not hesitate to cut off the synchronous connection with Wukong's vision. The wind and frost on the Eastern Wasteland's peak and the grand vow instantly disappeared.

Immediately after, his mind moved, and the画面 on the Attribute Panel switched.

The real-time status of another clone, Han Shi, appeared.

*Name: Han Shi (Cloud Scroll Avatar)*

*Status: Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Art [Qi Refining Late Stage · Perfection]*

*Realm: Sword Embryo初步 Condensed, perfectly pregnant (Qi Refining Late Stage · Perfection)*

Glancing at the information status of the clone Han Shi, Xu Yunfan felt a slight surprise. How long had it been? Even though the flow of time in the Divine Martial Realm, this small界天, was faster than in the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm, but at most, had the other side cultivated for thirty years?
