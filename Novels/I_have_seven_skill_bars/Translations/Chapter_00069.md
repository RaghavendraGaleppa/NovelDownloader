# Chapter 69: Breaking the Record

Long ago, Ding Rui had already determined that the harvest from his spirit field would definitely be enough to meet the sect's requirements. But now, he was also very curious: just how good was his first harvest as a spirit farmer?

"Come on! Get to work!"

Following the shout from the lead outer sect disciple, the other four also got to work.

Harvesting the spirit paddy, threshing the spirit rice. Counting and gathering were the final steps. The outer sect disciples only needed to spread out the harvested spirit rice, then sweep their true essence over it to count the exact quantity.

Batch after batch of spirit paddy was counted, then placed into the large bags they had brought. This process continued for an entire afternoon before it concluded!

"I'm done. 700,000 grains."

"Mine's 600,000 grains."

"I have 710,000 grains here."

"500,000 grains."

"360,000 grains!"

Finally, the five reported their respective counts. And when the last person finished reporting, nearly everyone in the entire 520 Spirit Field stared wide-eyed, dumbfounded—including Ding Rui himself!

700,000 grains plus 600,000 grains equals 1,300,000 grains. Just the figures from the first two outer sect disciples alone already exceeded the sect's strict requirements. Adding another 710,000 grains, that's 2,010,000 grains.

"Is it... a new record already?"

They spoke over each other, their voices filled with disbelief.

Finally, their gazes once again converged on Ding Rui. They looked at him as if he were an inner sect disciple, this spirit farmer before them giving them a surreal feeling.

"So much spirit rice, was this really cultivated by our Profound Talisman Sect disciples?"

"This must be a genius spirit farmer..."

"I must spread this news!"

...

The outer sect disciples' gazes transformed from peaceful when they first arrived, to shocked, and finally even tinged with reverence. The speed of this change caught Ding Rui completely off guard.

He saw the five outer sect disciples off, accompanying them to the gate of the spirit field. He only stopped walking when he saw them place the harvested spirit rice onto a floating boat and depart on it. The five of them were also reluctant to leave, turning back to glance at him occasionally, as if Ding Rui were a cultivator of some rare species.

...

"This is incredible."

Battle-type cultivators were undoubtedly important, but sometimes other types of cultivators were equally crucial. Just like now, when the sect region needed a large quantity of Vein-Opening Flowers, what was most needed were numerous spirit farmers.

...

Ten days later.

Spirit Field 520 welcomed another guest. And this person was someone Ding Rui was somewhat familiar with.

"You're Junior Brother Ding Rui, correct?"

"I'm here to inform you that, by sect command, your Spirit Field 520 must begin cultivating Vein-Opening Flowers from now on, and no longer plant spirit paddy. Of course, if you cultivate the Vein-Opening Flowers well, the rewards granted by the sect will only be higher than for spirit rice, not lower. You can take a look at the specific distribution method."

Dongfeng looked down at Ding Rui, holding a small notebook for records in his hand, and handed Ding Rui another notebook containing the distribution method.
