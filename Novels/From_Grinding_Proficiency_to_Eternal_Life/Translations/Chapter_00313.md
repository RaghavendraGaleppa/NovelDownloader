# Chapter 313: Penglai Pavilion

Further away, from the top floor of the "Drunken Immortal Tower" where wine banners fluttered in the wind, faint sword sounds leaked through the window. Two figures playing Go were silhouetted against the paper window. The sword qi stirred by the falling pieces made the copper bells at the eaves chime incessantly.

Li Haomiao listened to Fang Mushan's commentary while sweeping a glance at the girl in a light yellow dress leaning against the railing.

"That's not someone from the Sound Killing Sect. She's from Penglai Pavilion, one of the Six Great Sects of Great Zhou. Penglai Pavilion has always been mysterious, seeking not the secular world but the so-called Dao of Immortals. They have rarely participated in worldly disputes, but now it seems..."

At this point, the girl seemed to sense something and turned her head to look at Li Haomiao.

The moment Li Haomiao met the girl's gaze, starlight seemed to swirl in her eyes, and the vermilion mark between her eyebrows faintly emitted a green light.

Li Haomiao felt a slight shock in his spirit. The Subdragon Seal inside his clothes suddenly became hot. He immediately averted his gaze, his fingers unconsciously stroking the wrapping on the hilt of the sword at his waist.

Xu Yunfan, watching from the side, recognized that this movement was clearly a habitual action of Li Haomiao when he was unsettled.

However, the girl did not retract her gaze. Instead, she swept her eyes over Li Haomiao's shoulder and paused for half a breath on Xu Yunfan at the edge of the crowd.

Xu Yunfan had suppressed his aura to that of an ordinary person using the Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Technique, even matching his breathing rhythm to that of the waiters in the Drunken Immortal Tower. But when the girl's gaze swept over him, he still felt the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace in his sleeve tremble slightly, as if sensing some kind of transcendent aura.

*She is very strong!*

Xu Yunfan's heart chilled.

This girl was definitely not weak. Perhaps her age was not as young as she appeared.

The girl finally raised her fair wrist to tuck a stray strand of hair behind her ear. This movement caused the silver bell on her wrist to ring softly, the sound like a clear spring washing over jade.

Li Haomiao, pretending to adjust his collar, caught a glimpse with his peripheral vision of the unique cloud pattern restrictions of Penglai Pavilion engraved on the silver bell. The bell's core was actually a miniature Bagua compass.

His heart shook violently. He remembered the "Starry Heart-Questioning Bell" recorded in ancient texts, said to be able to reveal flaws in a cultivator's Dao Heart.

This was a supreme treasure of Penglai Pavilion, a Grade 7 divine weapon of the Non-Offensive type. Legend had it that it could soothe the human heart and refine the soul. Generally, only figures at the Sect Master level could wear it.

Fang Mushan keenly sensed the stagnation in the atmosphere and was about to speak to smooth things over when the sound of Golden Armor Imperial Guards shouting at vendors came from downstairs.

Amidst this brief commotion, the girl's figure had already vanished like a smoke cloud from the carved railing. The only thing left was a cup of Xueya tea still warm on the table, the tea leaves at the bottom arranged strangely into half of a broken hexagram.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed. He had seen the girl's movement clearly; it wasn't an abrupt disappearance, but a bizarre movement technique. For a moment, her speed even broke the sound barrier, yet she showed no sign of it, not even stirring a gust of wind.

*Ninth Realm!*

He had just entered the Imperial City, and he had already encountered a super expert at the level of a Ninth Realm Supreme Grandmaster!

Xu Yunfan suddenly recalled that the Ten Extremes Martial Way did not seem to record any martial arts from Penglai Pavilion. Back when the Sword Sage Lone Nine suppressed the entire Jianghu, making everyone afraid to lift their heads, he must have gone to the Penglai Pavilion in the East Sea.

But why hadn't he included Penglai Pavilion's martial arts? He would ask if he had the chance.

The girl's movement technique just now was extremely strange.

At this moment, Fang Mushan whispered, "The southwest corner."

Xu Yunfan glanced with his peripheral vision. In front of a black-tiled building with the sign "Four Seas Escort Bureau," more than ten bare-chested strongmen were loading and unloading goods.

The muscles on their shoulders writhed like mice, a clear sign that they had cultivated the "Raging Bull Strength" of the Molnan Dao to its extreme.

Raging Bull Strength, when perfected, possessed the strength of nine bulls. It was a basic martial art of the Maitreya Temple.

"What a chaotic mix of fish and dragons in the Imperial City," Fang Mushan sneered, his thumb unconsciously stroking the hilt of his knife. "When I left the Imperial City back then, there weren't so many demons and monsters."

Li Haomiao shook his head slightly. "Great Zhou is currently in troubled waters, yet the Imperial City's imperial examination proceeds as scheduled and is even spread throughout the world. Naturally, this attracts the attention of many."

A convoy entered the Imperial City discreetly. After settling down in the courtyard of the Daozong residence, Xu Yunfan stood in the courtyard paved with bluestone, gazing at the towering giant city known as the "Number One City Under Heaven."

Although the blood sacrifice at the Star Observation Platform failed a few days ago, causing a disturbance in the earth's veins and resulting in cracked city walls and collapsed houses, the current Imperial City had been completely renewed, showing no traces of the disaster.

In the twilight, the lights of the Imperial City were as bright as day. The Vermilion Sparrow Street was filled with streams of people, and the golden roof of the distant Imperial Palace reflected a blood-red hue in the setting sun.

Xu Yunfan's fingers unconsciously stroked the dragon's mouth at the back of the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace. The mace body transmitted a slight tremor. The spiritual energy network of this city had clearly been torn apart by someone. Although it appeared restored on the surface, chaotic spiritual energy still surged in the dark.

After dinner, he straightened his clothes and said to Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan, "I plan to go out for a walk to see the scenery of the Imperial City. Would you like to join me?"

"I grew up in this place. No matter how much I look, I've seen enough... You, on the other hand, can be considered as returning in glory and revisiting your old haunts. You might as well go take a look," Li Haomiao said, shaking his head slightly. He tapped the Subdragon Seal at his waist with his fingers and whispered, "Brother Fang and I still have matters to attend to. We need to contact some old ministers from the past to see if we can dig up any useful information."

Fang Mushan stood with his arms crossed, his gaze sweeping over the bustling street outside the window. He quickly cautioned, "The Imperial City is currently surging with undercurrents, and various forces are entrenched here. Since you've just arrived, it's best not to go too far."

Xu Yunfan smiled and said, "Don't worry, I'm just strolling around casually."

Just as he was about to step out the door, several Daozong disciples on guard duty quickly stepped forward. The leading disciple in a cyan shirt cupped his fist respectfully and said, "Since Senior Brother Xu has just arrived at the Imperial City, why not let us junior brothers accompany and guide you?"

A round-faced disciple behind him was even more enthusiastic. "This disciple has been stationed in the Imperial City for three years. I know exactly which teahouse on Vermilion Sparrow Street has the best Xueya tea, which acrobatics show in the West Market is the most spectacular, and even the old artisan shops in the alleys at the foot of the Imperial City walls are as familiar to me as the back of my hand!"

As he spoke, he magically produced a scroll of silk from his sleeve. "I drew a detailed map last night, marking the visible and hidden bases of various sects. With this, Senior Brother can move about more conveniently."

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over the characters marked in red on the silk scroll, such as "Heavenly Work Cave Hidden Stake" and "Nine Stars Sect Contact Point," and the smile at the corners of his mouth deepened.

*Damn, the identity of the Daozong's second-ranked true disciple is really great. Even when going out for a stroll, there are followers who come automatically.*

The reason these disciples were so eager was none other than his current status as the Sect Master's second-ranked true disciple. After becoming famous in the Thirty-Six Consecutive Rings Battle, he had even defeated Chu Cangming, who was vaguely considered the number one youth in the Daozong. Everyone in the Daozong knew that his master, Bi Yuan, had high hopes for him.

Not to mention that he possessed the divine weapon obtained from the Sword Burial Abyss, making him a candidate for the next Sect Master and Dao Son. If he spent a few decades settling in and integrating his identity as a latecomer, he might really be able to sit on the position of Sect Master. These Daozong disciples naturally dared not show the slightest negligence.

"Thank you for the trouble, fellow junior brothers."
