# Chapter 37: Fleeing at the Sight of Danger

"Yes, that's the right method," Chi Defeng nodded and said, "When encountering an anomalous entity, either your cultivation is deep enough to wear it down directly, or you run. If you can't run, then there's no other way."

"Can anomalous entities induce illusions?" Chen Fei suddenly asked.

"You've encountered one of that caliber?" Chi Defeng looked at Chen Fei with some surprise.

"I'm not sure," Chen Fei shook his head.

"Anomalous entities do indeed vary in strength and weakness. Those that can induce illusions are the most troublesome."

Chi Defeng thought for a moment, then went to another room. He reappeared a moment later, holding a manual which he handed to Chen Fei.

Chen Fei looked at Chi Defeng in confusion.

"The Clear Heart Art."

"From the Immortal Cloud Sword Sect?"

"Not every cultivation method comes from the Immortal Cloud Sword Sect," Chi Defeng chuckled, scolding him lightly. "I don't know which sect it's from. It doesn't help with cultivation nor can it be used to harm enemies. It merely calms the heart and mind. If you cultivate it to initial mastery, you'll be able to remain a bit calmer when things happen."

"Can it help break free from an anomalous entity's illusions?"

Whether the formula for the Light Spirit Pill could be deduced or not didn't affect Chen Fei much in the short term. However, whether he could run fast or not was extremely important.

In the last few incidents he'd encountered, if Chen Fei hadn't run fast enough, he'd already be dead.

Thus, apart from his cultivation realm, Chen Fei was most focused on movement techniques. As new cultivation methods continuously integrated, Chen Fei could feel his movement technique becoming faster and faster.

Even his regular speed was gradually approaching his previous sprint state.

Chen Fei had never seen a Marrow Tempering Realm martial artist, so he didn't know what kind of speed they possessed. But in his estimation, their speed should be comparable to his current speed, or perhaps even slightly inferior?

As for the Clear Heart Art, Chen Fei hadn't neglected it either. Besides its use against anomalous threats, with his initial mastery of the Clear Heart Art, Chen Fei found that his state of mind had become much more stable.

Before, due to insufficient strength and the various dangers surrounding him in this world, Chen Fei always lacked a sense of security.

This lack of security manifested as Chen Fei constantly "grinding experience." He had no so-called entertainment life, no free time; Chen Fei was always cultivating various techniques.

This constant tension made Chen Fei involuntarily excited, but at the same time, a deep-seated fatigue accumulated irresistibly within him.

"The army is entering the city! The army is entering the city!"

A sudden clamor erupted outside the alchemy room. As Chen Fei stepped out, Liu Jun ran up to him, shouting.

"The imperial army is here?"

Chen Fei's brow furrowed. The army had finally arrived in Pingyin County. He just didn't know if they intended to garrison here or merely pass through.

That evening, the most bustling restaurant in Pingyin County was brightly lit.

Both the county magistrate's yamen and the various aristocratic families gathered there to feast the army's generals.

Chen Fei was also invited, but he merely sat in a corner on the first floor of the restaurant.

With cups being exchanged and toasts made, the atmosphere in the restaurant was exceptionally lively. Chen Fei sat in his corner, observing the people around him. He didn't speak, nor did he try to strike up conversations, simply treating himself as invisible.
