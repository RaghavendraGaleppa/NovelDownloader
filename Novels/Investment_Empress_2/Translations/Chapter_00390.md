# Chapter 390: Jiang Yu (1/2)

The commotion at Broken Axe Mountain was far too conspicuous, practically an open invitation to the world that it housed a terrifying legacy and heaven-shaking treasures, beckoning heroes to come and claim them.

The elders of the Clear Abyss Sect could not possibly turn a blind eye.

However, the Sect Master had to remain to guard the sect.

Sending an ordinary Inner Scene cultivator might not be sufficient. They certainly couldn't send Shang Wu. If Shang Wu went, the issue wouldn't be about the legacy anymore; it would be about how many sects would come to settle scores with the Clear Abyss Sect afterward.

Even if they obtained the legacy in the end, it might not be worth the trouble...

At that moment, Elder Qian suddenly raised a finger, indicating he had a plan.

Wasn't Jiang Yu about to personally visit the Clear Abyss Sect?

Obviously, this Crown Prince of the Great Yu Dynasty wouldn't miss the excitement at Broken Axe Mountain. As the number one Hidden Dragon and a noble prince, he would surely have powerful experts following him.

If something happened to anyone, Jiang Yu would be the last person to be harmed.

Coincidentally, Li Mo and Little Bing'er had rendered great merit. When the time came, instead of asking for rewards, they could treat Jiang Yu as a tool and have him explore Broken Axe Mountain with them. This would ensure their safety while not missing the opportunity.

"Hmph... Then we'll settle accounts with him after Broken Axe Mountain."

Although the beautiful Master was displeased with the Crown Prince, she still felt the safety of her precious disciple and Little Bing'er was more important.

"......"

The teachers and elders were indeed thoughtful.

But Li Mo actually wasn't worried about safety issues regarding Broken Axe Mountain at all. After all, those strange phenomena and special effects were manually added by him; it might not be that dangerous inside.

Besides, the圣子 (Saint Son) of the Summoning Demon Cult and a group of demon cult members were also going to Broken Axe Mountain.

The Beast Hall Master called him brother.

The Summoning Saint Son had to call him uncle.

Inside Broken Axe Mountain, the one who should be worried about personal safety didn't seem to be him.

Li Mo didn't express an opinion, merely telling Elder Xie to rest assured.

Even with several people on the Somersault Cloud, its speed didn't slow down much. Before long, the Clear Abyss Sect was visible in the distance.

The Clear Abyss Sect was now decorated with lanterns and colorful banners, arranged very elaborately, but it didn't seem to be for the New Year.

Two huge banners were pasted on the main peak.

The first one read:

【Congratulations to our sect's Li Mo and Ying Bing for advancing hand in hand, achieving fourth and fifth places respectively on the Hidden Dragon List.】

The second one read:

【Welcome to the Crown Prince's arrival at our sect to guide the work of the Clear Abyss Sect's guarding jurisdiction.】

This gave Li Mo a strange sense of déjà vu, as if he had returned to high school in his previous life...

Li Mo looked into the distance. His eyesight was now exceptionally sharp.

In the distance, Ziyang Prefecture City was also covered in a silver white snow. Faintly, it seemed he could see a small hotpot restaurant by the official road fifty miles away, doing a booming business.

Chulong and the others must have had a lively New Year...

The Somersault Cloud landed in front of the mountain gate, and Elder Xie went to the main peak hall.

"You guys are finally back."

Shang Wu stretched lazily and said, "Finally, I'm not alone anymore. Little Bing'er, shall we go take a hot spring bath?"

"Hot spring..."

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and hadn't had time to agree when she suddenly remembered something.

Shang Wu, the fighting queen of the Clear Abyss Sect, lived alone in the Autumn Water Pavilion for so long...

Reference to the Jade Peak...

"Li Mo, where are you going?"

"I'm going to the Happy Sheep Hotpot Restaurant to wish Chulong a happy New Year,顺便 (by the way) to see how big her glasses are."

Ying Bing originally wanted to go see Chulong too.

But thinking of the Autumn Water Pavilion, which might or might not exist anymore, she wanted to go back and check quickly.

"Go ahead then, what about dinner?"

"I'll be back for dinner."

"Okay."

Li Mo waved to her and stepped onto the Somersault Cloud again.

......

Meanwhile.

The Happy Sheep Hotpot Restaurant, not far from Broken Axe Mountain, was known for its excellent flavor and had a great reputation. It had become a favorite spot for people in Ziyang Prefecture and passing martial artists.

On the first day of the New Year, business was even more booming.

---

"Hey, the strange phenomena at the bottom of Broken Axe Mountain have stopped recently. Is the legendary divine sword about to appear?"

"What divine sword? It's clearly the Buddha's remains."

"Why argue about it? So many Hidden Dragons and geniuses, experts on the Human List, and strong figures on the Earth List are flocking there. What does it have to do with us?"

A bearded martial artist changed the subject.

What is most talked about in the martial world?

Nothing more than divine skills, divine weapons, heroic figures... and beauties.

Among the Nine Heavens Ten Earths Wind Cloud List, the Hundred Flowers List is sold at the highest price because it has the most buyers...

"Tsk tsk, the top three of the Hundred Flowers List have changed. The first is still the Empress who is the model of feminine virtue, the second is still Sect Master Tan Tai of the Penglai Star Sect, a powerhouse on the Heaven List, but the third is actually her!"

"The Cold Fairy just passed her sixteenth year; she hasn't fully bloomed yet. How can she be compared?"

"The damn Unfettered Sky Sect, why don't you include a picture!"

"Hehe, if the little girl Jiang at the hotpot restaurant took off her blindfold, and if her features aren't bad, maybe she could make the list?"

"Go try taking it off for her."

A meddlesome martial artist egged on the bearded man at the same table.

"Little Jiang, bring two more bottles of wine!"

The big man was also a reckless person. After a few drinks, he completely forgot that Mei Yi, sitting at the counter, was watching him with an unfriendly expression.

But Mei Yi's expression suddenly froze.

Jiang Chulong was carrying two bottles of wine. She had just walked to the big man's table and hadn't even put the wine down when her body suddenly stiffened.

"Huh?"

The big man was stunned and turned his head. He saw a man standing at the door.

Wearing a golden crown and a moon-white long robe, with sword-like eyebrows and star-like eyes. The beard at the corners of his mouth was slightly blue, giving off an imposing and sharp aura of someone long accustomed to high status.

The most striking thing was those deep eyes.

Double pupils.

In a daze, you might even think the one standing there was a dragon holding a divine sword in its mouth.

Beside him stood two sword-maidens, one in green and one in pink, holding swords.

Seeing the young master narrow his eyes.

The sword-maiden in pink grasped the long sword in her arms, and a piercing glint lit up in her eyes.

"Ah... ah, my head... my head..."

In a daze, the big man saw his own head fly off. Feeling as if he were suffocating, he clutched his neck and collapsed to the ground.

His companions, seeing this, knew the man was unapproachable and quickly carried him out.

This killing intent wasn't just directed at the big man; the hotpot restaurant emptied out in a flash.

"Who taught you martial arts?"

The double pupils in the young master's sword-like eyes seemed to scrape over Jiang Chulong like cold steel.

"Your Highness..."

Mei Yun hurriedly stood up, looking terrified.

Jiang Chulong's face was pale, but she stubbornly tugged at Mei Yi's sleeve and lowered her head:

"Mei Yi, we... we don't... don't know him."

"The shop today... today... will... close early."

She started wiping the tables, crouching down to pick up the silver scraps left behind by the customers before they left.

The woman in pink beside her shouted, "His Highness is speaking to you, come over and kneel!"

After she spoke, she glanced at Jiang Yu.

Receiving his approval.

She reached out and drew in a withered branch from outside. Without using true energy, she whipped it towards Jiang Chulong. The sword intent was like a lone peak in the clouds.

"Your Highness!"

Mei Yun had just taken a step forward but was forced to withdraw it by that pair of double pupils.

*Slap—*

The sword sheath struck Jiang Chulong's back. She neither dodged nor counterattacked, stumbling from the blow. The festive red dress seeped with deeper bloodstains.

Jiang Yu's double pupils were calm, as if speaking of something commonplace:

"Beat her until she fights back."

"Let me see just how much skill you've learned from those backcountry techniques."
