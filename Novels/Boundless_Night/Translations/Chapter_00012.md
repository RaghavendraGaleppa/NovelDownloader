Chapter 12 Silver Vine Town

In the frigid winter, amidst ice and snow, a red glow burst forth from the mountains, butterflies danced in the night sky, and large showers of light fell, possessing an elegant, transcendent beauty.

This wondrous sight stunned Qin Ming and Xu Yueping, who paused to gaze at it.

A cold wind howled, causing branches in the dense forest to sway violently and sweeping up large patches of snow. The "red butterflies" dancing in the distance were carried closer by the strong wind.

Xu Yueping stared at the crimson-dyed night, finally determining what it was.

"A mutated plant is 'blooming,' overflowing with vibrant new life force. A few nearby wild beasts and fierce birds are about to mutate."

As he spoke, the fluttering "butterflies" drew nearer. A small number were blown over by the mountain wind. Upon closer inspection, they were luminous petals.

Qin Ming casually caught a few, his fingers glowing faintly red from their light.

Xu Yueping even put two petals into his mouth and ate them directly. When this type of mutated plant blooms, both its flowers and fruits carry a strong new life aura, beneficial to the human body.

"Slightly sweet," Qin Ming also tasted a few, lamenting that so few had fallen here.

In the distant mountains, the petals were dense, like burning crimson clouds, dispelling the night.

Large numbers of birds flew into the night sky, chasing the glowing red petals, while on the forest floor, ape cries and tiger roars echoed, as many creatures vied for them.

Qin Ming was eager to rush over.

Xu Yueping shook his head, stopping him. "Forget it. By the time we get there, it'll be bare, and we might even encounter dangerous exotic birds or mountain monsters."

The "blooming" of mutated plants occurs irregularly, regardless of season, making them hard to actively seek out. Moreover, they wither and die completely after their spectacular display.

Qin Ming sighed, "It's not just the deep mountains and vast swamps; even near our dwelling places, there's much mystery. I truly wish to pierce through the dense night fog and venture into the depths of the boundless world to see for myself."

Xu Yueping nodded, "It's good to have ambition; that's how you get the drive to improve. If you have the chance, go to Red Mist City in the distance for a visit first."

He believed that only by going there could one truly glimpse a corner of the real world.

He added, "You could even go there to study."

"Has Uncle Xu been there?" Qin Ming asked him.

A few wrinkles had appeared at the corners of Xu Yueping's eyes. He replied, "I've been there. I was deeply shaken, gradually recognizing reality, and after adjusting my mindset, I admitted my own mediocrity."

His words were calm, devoid of youthful vigor, bearing only the vicissitudes of middle age.

"Uncle Xu, you've seen and experienced a great deal," Qin Ming could only offer this comfort.

Xu Yueping gave a bitter smile, "Who didn't have dreams when they were young?"

He had the latter half of the sentence unspoken, but felt it was too melancholic and颓废, so he kept it to himself, not wanting to influence Qin Ming. Many things, after all, would eventually be worn away by reality.

"We haven't encountered a single prey in over ten li," Xu Yueping complained, hoping to hunt something in the wilderness to exchange for food and drink in town.

"They're probably all attracted by the mutated plant," Qin Ming speculated.

Normally, this stretch of road would require people to travel in groups, as all sorts of creatures could appear in the dark wilderness.

"Hey, at least we're not empty-handed!" Xu Yueping, after multiple forays into the dense forest, finally shot a muntjac, weighing around forty catties.

They walked quickly, covering thirteen li, and Silver Vine Town was in sight.

Under the night sky, distant lights shimmered faintly, and buildings appeared indistinctly, like a beautiful painting trimmed by tranquil years.

Here, the number of travelers significantly increased. There were those returning from hunting outside town, those entering to sell mountain goods, and even beast-drawn carts hurrying past with cargo.

Xu Yueping was familiar with Silver Vine Town and led Qin Ming directly forward.

Along the main street, many shops lined the sides, red lanterns hung under their eaves, and people bustled to and fro, making it very lively.

Each shop was filled with a dazzling array of goods, including exquisite porcelain, magnificent silk, and spices native to the mountains.

By the roadside, delicious snacks like pancakes and wontons were sold. The aromas of various foods wafted through the air, accompanied by hawkers' cries, full of a lively, earthy atmosphere.

Compared to this, Qin Ming found Twin Trees Village exceedingly quiet.

Xu Yueping went to inquire about grain prices and was told they remained at an exceptionally high, supply-short state. Heavy snow had blocked the roads, making it difficult to transport grain from afar.

The central area of Silver Vine Town was brightly lit. The Fire Spring was located here. Although it was in its depletion phase, the eight-zhang square pond still shimmered with rippling light and exuded a misty aura.

A silver ancient vine, as thick as a water bucket, was rooted in the Fire Spring, which glowed like molten lava. This was the origin of Silver Vine Town's name.

It looked extraordinary, but it was still an ordinary plant, absorbing limited spiritual energy from the Fire Spring.

Qin Ming discovered living creatures in the pond – a type of glowing red shellfish, as translucent as jade, with fiery mists flowing as their shells opened and closed.

"Fire Clams. Even in such a large pond, only a few dozen are raised. They say they taste incredibly delicious and contain potent active substances. I wonder where they'll end up, and for whom they're meant."

Xu Yueping whispered. These Fire Clams, at the very least, had to be raised in a second-grade Fire Spring like the one in this town; otherwise, their spiritual energy wouldn't be sufficient to sustain them.

The busiest shops were all near the Fire Spring, such as the old-established weapon store, which saw many people coming and going. The harsh environment of the wilderness made everyone want a good weapon in hand.

Scattered snowflakes began to fall from the sky. Xu Yueping led Qin Ming towards the adjacent bar. Many exquisitely crafted hanging lamps adorned the entrance, and sunstones placed inside cast a brilliant glow.

Bar businesses thrived later in the night. It was still early, and the place was almost empty.

"Are we the first guests?" Xu Yueping asked with a smile.

A young man nodded ceremoniously, confirming it. He hadn't quite woken up yet and was quite unwilling to provide service so early.

Xu Yueping said, "Please tell your boss we're looking for Feng Yi'an."

The young man, whose polite smile had been half-hearted, instantly cleared his head. "Our boss isn't here, but he gave instructions in advance. I'll go find Mr. Feng for you right now."

"This muntjac meat is tender and fresh. It should be enough to exchange for some good wine, right?" Xu Yueping offered the muntjac as payment.

Normally, the bar would refuse, but food was currently scarce. The young server immediately nodded in agreement.

"This bar owner calls himself a 'West Fire Luo' person," Xu Yueping told Qin Ming. "Many years ago, his father, as a retainer, once followed a master who rode a monstrous bird from the west."

Some said that master traveled the world, while others claimed he was killed by 'Moon Worms' while exploring a higher-grade Fire Spring deep in the mountains.

His follower settled here and opened this bar.

"Mr. Feng should appear around noon today," the young man informed them a moment later, preparing to summon someone to serve.

Xu Yueping waved his hand. "No singing or hot dances. Just bring us food and good wine. We're here to discuss business today."

The bar's decor was quite exquisite, with various colored crystal lamps hanging, though the sunstones placed inside were small, creating a hazy, dreamlike light.

Xu Yueping lowered his voice, "It's still early, Little Qin. You wait here. I'm going to pay a visit to that old gentleman."

Qin Ming nodded, knowing he was going to try his luck at the old noble's mansion, and that stopping him would be useless.

The bar fell quiet. Qin Ming took a sip of the amber liquid in his glass. Although not spicy, he still wasn't used to the taste.

Time slowly passed. He watched the snow falling outside the window, people coming and going, feeling the prosperity and bustle rarely seen in Twin Trees Village.

Xu Yueping returned, brushing off a few snowflakes from his clothes. After rubbing his hands together, he drank several cups of wine in quick succession. "It really tastes better than what I have at home."

"Uncle Xu, are you alright?" Qin Ming asked.

Xu Yueping replied, "What could be wrong with me? Oh, right, when I visited, they were very polite and warmly received me. They said they'd give you a chance later."

"Huh?" Qin Ming was surprised. This was different from what he'd imagined; they actually hadn't refused.

He asked for more details and was immediately speechless.

The one who warmly received Xu Yueping was the butler; it was impossible to see the old noble.

The butler wore a gentle smile, more like he was maintaining proper courtesy. Many people had visited recently, and he said he would arrange a time for outstanding young men to meet the old noble together.

Qin Ming said, "They're politely declining."

Xu Yueping took another drink. "You can lift six hundred catties. With such a brilliant achievement, I think they'll look at you differently."

Qin Ming spoke, "You revealed my background, and even though they smiled, they treated you very calmly. That should explain everything. You also mentioned they came from afar, perhaps from some splendid city. They must have seen much of the world."

Xu Yueping recalled some rumors: that noble young lady's talent seemed exceptionally high.

He frowned. "You're considered stunning in our region, and they still don't think much of it?"

Although he was a bit unwilling, he had a premonition after being politely received by the butler. He simply wanted to help Qin Ming seize this opportunity and, at the same time, resolve the issue of the Patrol Team pressuring them.

Qin Ming's expression was serious. "Uncle Xu, don't overthink it. We shouldn't get too involved with mysterious nobles who come from big places to small towns."

Xu Yueping immediately became alert. Who knew if the other party was in seclusion or fleeing disaster? He nodded solemnly. "You're right."

Noon was when the night was lightest, allowing a blurry view of the mountains outside Silver Vine Town.

Feng Yi'an appeared, accompanied by two patrolmen, bringing gusts of cold air as they entered the bar through the wind and snow.

"Brother Xu, sorry about this. It must have been a long trip and a long wait for you. We just returned from patrol," Feng Yi'an greeted him warmly.

Seeing his seemingly sincere demeanor, Qin Ming felt immense revulsion in his heart and wanted nothing more than to smash this bearded man's face with a punch.

He had already learned from Xu Yueping that this group of patrolmen usually didn't take their duties seriously, only appearing in the mountains together in the middle and end of the month.

Although the sun had vanished, and there was no longer the brilliant sight of a bright moon high above and stars filling the sky, people still used the old calendar, referring to the beginning and end of the month.

Many times, some members of the Patrol Team would linger in the bars and restaurants of various towns, even keeping mistresses.

Xu Yueping forced a smile and replied, "Brother Feng, you're too polite. We know patrolling is hard work for you, and we haven't waited long."

Feng Yi'an then looked at Qin Ming. "Little Brother Qin, you're a fine young man with unlimited potential. I hope you can join our Patrol Team in the future."

He patted Qin Ming's shoulder to show closeness, then called a server, asking for a private room.

Feng Yi'an looked at the two behind him. "Brother Xu and I will chat first. You two can get some drinks with Little Brother Qin and then go check the restaurant next door for some good dishes."

He mainly wanted to drop his pretense and speak with Xu Yueping alone. Indeed, once they entered the private room, his attitude changed.

"Old Xu, you're not playing along. Being too serious in life will only make you tired and miserable. Don't forget, you have a wife, children, and elderly parents. It's quite normal for a few fierce beasts to occasionally charge into your home from the deep mountains late at night, isn't it?" Feng Yi'an lightly patted Xu Yueping's face with his palm.

He was no longer boisterous now, smiling indifferently, his gaze gradually growing cold. This was blatant intimidation.

"I will plant Black Moon immediately when I return," Xu Yueping said.

"You've made me very uncomfortable this time. You won't bow your head unless I kill some people in the mountains, will you? And I even made a special trip here for you. The team leader was very displeased when he heard!" Feng Yi'an increased his strength, slapping Xu Yueping's face again.

Fifteen minutes later, Feng Yi'an was the first to emerge from the private room on the second floor, a smile on his face.

"Let's go," Xu Yueping said to Qin Ming.

Feng Yi'an said with a smile, "Brother Xu feels that planting Black Moon is very urgent and wants to head back first. If Little Brother Qin isn't in a hurry, you can stay and have a few drinks."

Qin Ming shook his head, declining. "No, I'll go with Uncle Xu. The wilderness hasn't been peaceful lately, and it's good to have someone watching out for you when traveling together."

Watching them disappear at the bar's entrance, one of the men beside Feng Yi'an spoke, "Even if that young man has a golden foundation, what of it? Clearly, he and Xu Yueping are cut from the same cloth. Why be so polite to him?"

Feng Yi'an said, "Indeed, it's hard to say what heights he can reach, and he's not one of us. But since we haven't openly fallen out yet, it's best to show some respect—unless we decide to kill him immediately..."

"Uncle Xu!" Qin Ming noticed a very faint handprint on Xu Yueping's left cheek. He immediately understood that Xu Yueping had been humiliated in the private room.

He could feel that humiliation, and a surge of anger pulsed in his heart. He took a deep breath and said, "Uncle Xu, they've been doing evil deeds repeatedly. I feel that even Heaven can't stand it anymore and will soon collect them!"
