# Chapter 12: Rising Fame, Boundless Future

"You..."

The four stewards exchanged glances, their expressions shifting uncertainly. Steward Lin's eyes were filled with disbelief as he muttered, "You killed the mountain patrol spirit beast?"

Li Zhengjing wiped the blood from his face and smiled. "Indeed. What's the penalty for killing a spirit beast? Do I have to pay with my life?"

"Don't be ridiculous!" 

A loud voice came from outside the courtyard as a burly man strode in, wearing a gold token at his waist and exuding a powerful aura—clearly an inner sect elder!

"For self-defense, killing an enemy is no crime! No matter how precious the spirit beast, once it goes berserk, it's fine to kill it!" 

The elder looked at Li Zhengjing with admiration and said, "As an outer sect disciple, you must have only recently received the Visceral Nurturing Qi Technique and just reached the 'Inner Qi' stage. Yet with minimal foundation, you managed to kill a spirit beast bare-handed—your future is boundless!"

The four stewards bowed in unison. "Greetings, Elder Xie!"

Ignoring them, Elder Xie Qingchang walked past and approached Li Zhengjing. "I am Xie Qingchang, an inner sect elder of the Ancient Moon Peak. This year, I oversee the Law Enforcement Hall. Hearing of the spirit beast's rampage, I came to investigate personally."

He glanced at the leopard's corpse and said, "The body will be taken to the Law Enforcement Hall for examination. As for you, once your injuries heal, report to the hall and recount tonight's events in detail."

With a faint smile, he added, "But I can grant you this—you may keep the leopard's penis as a tonic."

Li Zhengjing placed the organ aside and cupped his hands in thanks. "Much obliged."

Xie Qingchang nodded, then turned to the stewards. "Last night, an unexplained fire broke out at the mountain's base. The sect is now on high alert."

"Nine spirit beasts were dispatched from the inner sect to assist in patrols. All were tamed by the Beast Taming Hall and should not lose control easily."

"Yet you outer sect stewards, tasked with supervising these beasts, nearly caused a death. Everyone involved must report to the Law Enforcement Hall for questioning!"

"If the beast's rampage was not your fault, I will hold the Beast Taming Hall accountable tomorrow."

With that, Xie Qingchang said coolly, "Let's go."

Steward Lin and the others remained composed and complied. Whether Li Zhengjing lived or died, the Law Enforcement Hall would investigate the spirit beast's rampage, and they had already prepared their defense.

As the four stewards followed Xie Qingchang away, Law Enforcement Hall disciples arrived to remove the leopard's corpse.

Li Zhengjing sensed the "Inner Qi" cultivated through the Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique and felt a newfound sense of security.

"You... nurtured Visceral Inner Qi?" 

A voice filled with complex emotions came from the courtyard—Xie Guihai.

Looking at the blood-drenched, fearsome figure before him, Xie Guihai felt a pang of defeat. Without waiting for a reply, he waved dismissively and turned to leave. But then he paused, reached into his robe, and tossed a medicine bottle backward.

"This is for your wounds. The hand injuries are one thing, but a scarred face would mar the sect's dignity."

"Thanks!"

Li Zhengjing caught the bottle, applied the powder to his wounds, and bandaged his arm. Staring at his torn palm, he recalled catching the leopard's tail mid-battle.

The spirit leopard's tail, infused with blood qi, had been terrifyingly powerful!

"In that final strike, I concentrated my Visceral Inner Qi into my fist. The force was ten times stronger than before!"

Exhaling deeply, he relished the stability his newfound strength brought. "Logically, a newly ascended 'Inner Qi' cultivator's power should be weak. Yet mine is far stronger—this Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique is even more formidable than I imagined!"

Beyond the technique's potency, another factor was the abundant spiritual energy from the Five Elements Creation Balm within him.

His breakthrough under life-or-death pressure had been explosive. While others might slowly tap into their Inner Qi like a spring, his had surged forth like a flood.

The sheer volume of Inner Qi he unleashed at the breakthrough moment dwarfed that of typical new Inner Qi cultivators by three to five times!

With this realization, he walked to the rockery and looked at the sack wrapped in chains. "I'm pleased you didn't make a noise tonight to alert the Law Enforcement Hall."

Silence.

Unease crept in as Li Zhengjing untied the sack and peeled it back.

Relief washed over him—the Five Elements Creation Tree was still there, unmoved.

But the tree lay dormant, as if lifeless.

Frowning, he kicked the stump.

The tree shuddered, then extended roots from the soil, waving frantically in the air like a panicked plea.

"Forgive me, Master! This lowly one was severely drained and fell asleep to recover! It won't happen again!"

"Rest then."

Li Zhengjing's tone was indifferent as he re-covered the tree with the sack and secured it. His gaze then caught on something—the letter from "Dark Flower Lane" delivered earlier.

Now with heightened senses from his Inner Qi, he detected a scent on the letter akin to the spirit leopard's.

His eyes sharpened. "Did this letter's scent lure the leopard here?"

He didn't know whether this crisis stemmed from the elusive Thousand Illusion Divine Lord or Steward Chen Youyu's schemes. But it no longer mattered—with Inner Qi attained, he matched the stewards in both strength and status.

"If I can't handle that bastard Thousand Illusion Divine Lord, I can certainly deal with these washed-up old men like Chen Youyu and Zhou Shaojie—stuck at the Inner Qi stage for decades!"

Tucking the letter away, murderous intent flared within him. "Killing a leopard is nothing. Killing them is the real goal."

Meanwhile, at Chen Youyu's residence...

Pei Ying returned with alarming news.

Chen Youyu staggered as if struck by lightning. "Impossible... How could he reach the Inner Qi stage?"

The flawed Visceral Nurturing Qi Technique should have crippled Li Zhengjing's organs—how did he cultivate Inner Qi?

Yet the news spread like wildfire, sweeping through the outer and inner sects: Outer Sect Disciple Li Zhengjing had slain a spirit beast bare-handed!

Even among inner sect disciples, few could defeat a spirit beast unarmed. Yet Li Zhengjing, having practiced the technique for barely twenty days, had done so upon reaching the Inner Qi stage?

When the news reached Chen Yang, his face twisted with shock and suspicion.

He knew Li Zhengjing's technique was flawed. How had he succeeded?

"Did he obtain the complete technique? Does he know the original was sabotaged?"

"Or does he possess unparalleled comprehension, deducing the full method from the flawed version?"

"Could he have an innate constitution that allows Inner Qi cultivation despite the flaws?"

Countless theories raced through Chen Yang's mind. But one thing was clear: Li Zhengjing had ascended to the inner sect, his future limitless.

"With his potential and the grudges fostered by Chen Youyu's suppression—not to mention his ties to Yuan Zhengfeng—he can never be an ally."

Taking a deep breath, Chen Yang steeled himself. "If we don't eliminate him now, he'll become an unstoppable threat."
