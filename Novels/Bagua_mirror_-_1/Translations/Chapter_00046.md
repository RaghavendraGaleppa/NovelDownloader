# Chapter 46: Suspicion

The two Green-Scaled Horned Pythons maintained a distance of about ten zhang between them, forming a pincer formation against Qin Chong and Zhao Yin. Although these demon beasts were low in cultivation, they displayed a hint of intelligence with this tactic.

"Got it!"

"Aim for their underbellies seven inches below the head or their eyes. Their scales make other areas too well-defended to penetrate easily."

Though Qin Chong found Zhao Yin somewhat long-winded at the moment, he didn't voice any objections—being looked after like this was actually rather comforting.

"Alright!"

Just then, the two pythons launched their attack first. Despite their massive two-to-three-zhang-long bodies, they slithered forward with surprising speed.

"Whoosh!"

Zhao Yin immediately summoned a top-grade flying sword artifact, sending a streak of green light straight toward one python's eye—its vital spot.

Instead of dodging, the charging python fearlessly continued its advance. At the last moment, it tilted its head slightly and deflected the flying sword with one of its horns.

"Clang!" The sword struck the horn without leaving a scratch.

Unfazed, Zhao Yin manipulated the sword into a spinning motion, redirecting it toward the python's eye again. Yet the creature jerked its head once more, forcefully knocking the weapon away.

Zhao Yin's brow furrowed, his expression turning grave. "Kid, be careful. These damned beasts seem smarter than they look."

When he glanced at Qin Chong, however, the young man had already moved far ahead, having somehow circled behind the other python. A streak of black light shot out, skimming along the ground before slicing upward at the python's underbelly.

Not wanting to waste time, Qin Chong had directly deployed his top-grade artifact—the Black Profound Sword.

Seeing this, Zhao Yin was momentarily stunned. Qin Chong was still displaying only sixth-level Qi Refining cultivation, yet he wielded a top-grade artifact with ease. Still, it reassured him—with such skill, Qin Chong could handle one python alone. He refocused on his own opponent.

Qin Chong's strike proved effective. Though it didn't hit the critical seven-inch spot, it left a long gash along the python's belly. Blood gushed out, and even some internal organs spilled forth.

However, serpentine demon beasts possessed remarkable vitality. Even in this state, the creature remained combat-ready, letting out a hiss before twisting its head to strike at Qin Chong.

Qin Chong had anticipated this. He swiftly dodged and repositioned himself, seeking the next opening.

Meanwhile, Zhao Yin—seeing Qin Chong's success—adjusted his own strategy, aiming for his python's vulnerable underbelly.

After a brief struggle, Qin Chong seized an opportunity. His Black Profound Sword flashed out once more, cleanly slicing through the seven-inch weak point on his python's belly. The beast collapsed, immobilized but still writhing weakly.

With his opponent dealt with, Qin Chong moved to assist Zhao Yin—only to find the older man had already finished off his python in an even more brutal fashion. His flying sword had pierced clean through the seven-inch spot, killing it instantly.

Qin Chong delivered a final strike to his own dying python, ending its suffering.

After exchanging a glance, both men collected the python carcasses and hurried toward their next target. Though this area saw few visitors, the earlier commotion might have drawn attention. They left without a word.

This marked their first harvest since entering the secret realm—five or six Dragon's Chant Herbs each, plus a Green-Scaled Horned Python.

As they traveled, Zhao Yin grew pensive, occasionally stealing glances at Qin Chong.

"Kid, your cultivation isn't just sixth-level Qi Refining, is it?"

A seasoned veteran, Zhao Yin had noticed Qin Chong's effortless control of a top-grade artifact—something impossible for a typical sixth-level cultivator.

Qin Chong had expected this. With their partnership lasting throughout the secret realm's trials, hiding his true strength indefinitely would be impractical. He'd deliberately used the Black Profound Sword from the start, knowing Zhao Yin would eventually find out.

"I might have held back a little. Just being cautious."

"Hmph. So you don't trust me? Why team up if that's the case?"

"If I really wanted to hide it, I wouldn't have used a top-grade artifact. I just kept some cards in hand in case we face greater dangers later."

"Crafty little fox. Whatever concealment method you're using, it's flawless—I couldn't sense anything off. If not for how smoothly you handled that artifact, I'd never have suspected."

"Guess I wasn't hiding it well enough after all," Qin Chong chuckled before changing the subject. "Let's head to the next Dragon's Chant Herb location. No point dawdling."

"Getting those few herbs earlier was already lucky. The next spot might not be so easy."

"We'll see when we get there."

But when they arrived, the sight left them speechless.

The area bore signs of a recent battle—lingering traces of three cultivators and four or five late-stage first-rank demon beasts. Most telling were the freshly upturned patches of soil on a nearby slope—every herb had been stripped clean, seedlings and all.

"Which bastard did this? They didn't even leave the seedlings!" Zhao Yin fumed.

"Right? Seedlings need time to grow and absorb nutrients. How ruthless," Qin Chong agreed, surprising Zhao Yin with his concurrence.

"Whatever. Let's move on."

Over the next stretch, they checked four or five more Dragon's Chant Herb sites—only to find most already plundered. At the final location, they managed to scavenge a few remaining herbs.

"Didn't expect any leftovers."

"After all this rushing around, it'd be unfair if we didn't find at least something."

"Fairness? What's that?"

"Quit yapping, kid. Let's wrap this up."

With all possible Dragon's Chant Herb locations exhausted, they turned their attention to Scarlet Vermilion Fruits.

Though lower in grade than Dragon's Chant Herbs, these fruits were far rarer—only two locations in the entire Dragon's Chant Mountain housed them. Worse, the fruit trees grew on sheer cliffs dozens of zhang high. Normally, harvesting them wouldn't be difficult, but the secret realm's flight-restriction arrays made the task daunting.
