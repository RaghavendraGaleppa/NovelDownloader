**Chapter 155: Assistance**

Bang! A muffled sound echoed, and blood splattered. Zhou Tian’s shoulder bled as the God King retracted his golden ancient spear, blood dripping from its tip.

“You are no match for me!” The God King’s eyes were cold, like lightning from an ice cavern. His ancient spear had just pierced Zhou Tian’s shoulder.

“Don’t draw conclusions until the very last moment.” Zhou Tian smiled freely, his wound already mending. His massive palm condensed thousands of lightning bolts, striking directly at the God King.

The God King’s gaze hardened. He bellowed, “Seeking death!”

Clang, clang, clang! Billions of spear lights burst forth, blindingly bright, as if reopening the divine realm. This was the God King of All Gods’ famous grand technique, his unique divine art. A layer of brilliant wings seemed to cover his body, transforming him into a divine bird that spread its wings and soared skyward! Innumerable ancient spear phantoms followed, densely packed. With a slight tremor, billions of spear lights shot out, threatening to destroy heaven and earth!

Zhou Tian’s expression darkened. His opponent’s weapon was a damaged Heavenly Venerate artifact, and his divine abilities could also be called invincible. Furthermore, he was a Heavenly Venerate level expert from ancient times, with incredibly rich combat experience, completely different from fighting the Saint Devil. Zhou Tian was already at a disadvantage. However, Zhou Tian’s own body naturally counterattacked powerfully. Every pore on his skin spewed flames, encircled by lightning. From a distance, he looked like a blazing sun, with killing moves emanating from every inch of his being!

Rumble! Heaven and earth cracked, and this void was on the verge of destruction.

“Zheng, zheng…” Chaotic Qi surged! The space between the two was dazzling, completely submerged by spear light. The God King of All Gods was like a divine spear; with every tremor, all heavens seemed to be torn apart and pierced through. Zhou Tian, on the other hand, was like a scorching sun, dazzling all over. Billions of crimson-gold flames and lightning surged. This was no ordinary fire or lightning, but a unique blend of Yin and Yang energies, containing inexplicable power.

“Pfft!” In the end, blood welled from Zhou Tian’s abdomen, pierced through by a spear light, transparent from front to back. It was a fatal killing blow from the God King, hidden among billions of spear lights, aimed at his heart, but it only hit his abdomen.

“Oh no!” “Tian’er!” “Zhou Tian!” Everywhere, people cried out in alarm. Zhou Changsheng, Zhou Zui, Tian Ling, and others were extremely nervous, their hearts in their throats, utterly worried and terrified. Even Yan Mo was incredibly tense, for at this moment, Zhou Tian no longer represented just himself. If he were to fall, perhaps no one present would escape.

“Why do you keep fighting me with abnormal energy? At this level, one’s own will, embedded in divine abilities, is the strongest weapon. You… there’s something wrong with you!” The God King of All Gods stood holding his spear. After his initial shock, and having exchanged blows with Zhou Tian, he keenly sensed Zhou Tian’s abnormality. The use of abnormal energy, while naturally gained with higher realms and insights into heaven and earth, is not how most powerful experts choose to fight.

“Your observation is quite keen. I hope you, old senior, can defeat me within your limited time.” Zhou Tian clutched the wound on his abdomen. Green energy surged, the energy of life, which had miraculous effects on healing injuries. He was putting on a brave face, but his time was also limited. Nearly half of the thirty-one seconds had passed, and he didn’t know how much longer the God King of All Gods could exist.

“If this continues, Tian’er will surely lose!” Zhou Changsheng’s expression was tense. “The God King of All Gods possesses a Heavenly Venerate artifact and abundant combat experience. Tian’er merely forcefully reached this level using some means. He absolutely cannot continue like this!”

“Let me do it,” Yan Mo spoke. “Both of your Heavenly Venerate artifacts no longer have artifact spirits. Only my Ruler of Suppression retains a trace of sentience that can be lent out.” At this point, no one could harbor selfish thoughts, or it would be tantamount to courting death!

Zhou Changsheng and Xuan Zhenzi exchanged glances and nodded. A complete Heavenly Venerate artifact possesses an artifact spirit, and some powerful Heavenly Venerate artifact spirits are no weaker than a true Heavenly Venerate. Their Heavenly Venerate artifacts were on the verge of shattering, their artifact spirits long gone. They were bound to them through special methods, allowing only them to wield them. Only Yan Mo’s Ruler of Suppression still had an artifact spirit, as it hadn’t been subjected to special methods.

The ancient ruler reappeared in Yan Mo’s hand, floating in the air, simple and unadorned. Whoosh! The ancient ruler shot out, and Yan Mo’s body instantly exploded. Zhou Changsheng and Xuan Zhenzi acted together, reassembling Yan Mo’s body, though it was dim and flickering, on the verge of collapse.

Rumble! Thunder rolled, and a thunder dragon descended from the sky. It was the Lord of Thunder taking action to block the ancient ruler. Crack! The thunder dragon was shattered, but the ancient ruler’s momentum remained unchecked. The Lord of Thunder’s expression was grim. The golden ancient spear had been taken by the God King of All Gods, and without Heavenly Venerate artifacts, they had no means to resist.

“I am the God King!” The God King of All Gods chanted in a sutra-like voice. His physical body disintegrated on its own, transforming into Dao symbols that permeated the sky, forming a terrifying ocean of order that surged towards Zhou Tian.

“So what if it’s abnormal energy?!” In an instant, he conjured a thunder pool. Within it, not only were there lightning flashes, but also various abnormal energies: Yin-Yang qi, golden flames, dark waves, like true phoenixes dancing within. Fragments of time permeated the air. So what if it was merely abnormal energy? It was still half-step Heavenly Venerate level energy; how much worse could it be? The thunder pool served as a foundation, brewing peerless abnormal energy. A hazy chaotic mist enveloped it, and all the abnormal energies merged into Chaotic Qi. This was currently the only known energy that could not be directly utilized; even Heavenly Venerates struggled to condense it directly from themselves, only able to collect and merge it.

Whoosh! From the ocean of order that the God King had transformed into, a golden long spear stabbed out, carrying chilling killing intent, radiating extreme brilliance. Golden light engulfed this void! The thunder pool, dragging Chaotic Qi, resisted! Boom! The area exploded, and the void shattered like glass. Zhou Tian flew backward, Chaotic Qi permeating. The God King of All Gods reassembled his form, also slightly swaying. The erosive power of Chaotic Qi was rare in the world; just now, as he transformed into an ocean, he was permeated by Chaotic Qi.

Just as he was about to pursue his advantage with the spear, his gaze suddenly narrowed. He slightly shifted his body, as a streak of light swept past his ear, severing a strand of his lustrous, crystalline hair.

Meanwhile, Zhou Tian, from a distance, felt his mind stir. He extended his hand, and an ancient ruler landed in his palm, instantly growing tens of millions of times larger, perfectly fitting his current Dharma Body. Simultaneously, streams of information flowed from the ruler into his mind. Zhou Tian laughed, “Haha, indeed, the world is truly unpredictable!”

“Educate all beings!” Zhou Tian waved the ancient ruler in his hand, and a vast, boundless River of Righteous Qi emerged, its source and end unseen. Within the long river were thousands of strange phenomena: the phantom of a preacher from ancient times, and babbling children reciting scriptures. This was the manifestation of educating all beings. It bore some resemblance to the divine ability Zheng Yusheng displayed that day.
