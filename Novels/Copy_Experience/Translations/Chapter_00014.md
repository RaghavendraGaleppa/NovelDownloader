# Chapter 14: Crisis Approaches

He Qing followed closely behind the woman as she walked out. The woman turned back, gave him a gentle smile, then bowed to Lu Xu before turning and re-entering her room. He Qing's gaze followed her the entire time, his eyes full of tenderness.

"Fellow Daoist He, time to come back to your senses!" Lu Xu teased.

He Qing chuckled, scratching the back of his head, his face slightly flushed. He glanced at Lu Xu and remarked, "Fellow Daoist Lu, your mana is becoming increasingly profound. I'm afraid it won't be long before you reach the third layer of Qi Condensation!"

He hadn't noticed that Lu Xu had already broken through to the third layer of Qi Condensation. Lu Xu had hidden his cultivation, only displaying it at the second layer of Qi Condensation. He adhered to the principle of keeping a low profile, not wanting his breakthrough to attract too much attention and potentially invite danger.

Shaking his head, Lu Xu said, "The third layer of Qi Condensation isn't that easy to break through. Fellow Daoist He, are you heading out?"

"Yes, taking my wife home. I might not be back tonight!" He Qing replied with a slight smile.

"Be careful, Fellow Daoist He, that area isn't very safe!"

"Thank you for the reminder. With my humble possessions, I shouldn't be targeted by rogue cultivators!"

He Qing called his wife out, and the two left the courtyard, one after the other. Lu Xu noticed the second-story window on the other side open. Han Erlengzi (Han the Simpleton) was staring intently at the couple below, his eyes seemingly filled with envy.

"This kid..."

Unlike Old Man Xu and He Qing, who only considered marrying and having children when they reached middle age and their path to cultivation seemed hopeless, this Fellow Daoist Han's thoughts were quite progressive. He had only been cultivating for a few years and was already thinking about marrying and starting a family. It seemed he had no great desire for immortal cultivation and longevity; instead, he looked forward to a life with a wife, children, and a warm *kang* (heated bed).

"He's got a future, this kid. He's already saved himself decades of detours in his thinking!" Lu Xu mused inwardly with a slight tease. Not everyone can hope for longevity. Seeing one's path clearly early on is also a form of wisdom.

Back home, Lu Xu began to ponder: "Now that I have another replication opportunity, who should I replicate?" He couldn't help but feel a little troubled, as he realized he had subtly reached the development ceiling of Qinghu Market. In this market, Earth Fire was monopolized, Demonic Fire was hard to find, making both alchemy and artifact refining difficult to develop. As for formations, it was even less likely; it was almost impossible to find a formation master. He could only focus his attention on talisman crafting.

But... with Lu Xu's current experience, how difficult would it be to find a talisman master whose experience he could replicate? There were very few with higher experience than him. These people were either with the Mo family or in the Divine Talisman Hall, none of whom were easily accessible.

"Forget it, I'll take it one step at a time. I'll slowly gather information and look for opportunities!"

After making his decision, Lu Xu continued his calm life. He had now changed his previous lifestyle. Instead of fixating on one thing for a period, he now cultivated while crafting talismans. In the past, he was so short on spirit stones that he lived a bit wildly. He desperately crafted talismans, neglecting even his cultivation. Now, he chose to balance both cultivation and talisman crafting. However, doing so meant the number of talismans he produced was much lower than before.

Three months later, it was time for the transaction he had agreed upon with Tan Hu. Over these three months, Lu Xu had crafted 160 talismans. He divided these talismans into two portions: 40 were for scattered sales to other cultivators, and 120 were for Tan Hu.

The next day, Lu Xu took the 120 talismans to the market's trading area, met with Tan Hu, and completed another transaction.

"Fellow Daoist Lu, in the mortal town outside the market, there's a secret market exchange that's regularly organized. Are you interested in attending? I can introduce you!" Tan Hu suddenly said this after the two completed their transaction.

"Secret market?"

"That's right. Fellow Daoist should understand that some transactions between cultivators can't see the light of day, which is why secret markets came into being!" Tan Hu said to Lu Xu, a certain glint flashing in his eyes.

"Isn't that just a black market?" Lu Xu understood.

"Fellow Daoist Tan, please forgive me, but I have no interest in such secret markets!" Lu Xu resolutely rejected Tan Hu's invitation.

"That's a pity, but if Fellow Daoist Lu ever becomes interested, you can always let me know!" Tan Hu didn't press the matter, smiled, and turned to leave.

Lu Xu watched his retreating back, deep in thought. To be honest, he was quite interested in secret markets, but since Tan Hu was the one inviting him, he had to be cautious. He didn't trust this man at all!

After completing the transaction with Lu Xu, Tan Hu wandered aimlessly around the market for a few more rounds, bought a few things, and then quietly left Qinghu Market. In front of the mortal town, his figure reappeared. Blending into the crowd, Tan Hu took a circuitous route and arrived at a private room in a teahouse.

"How many talismans did you buy this time?" A voice sounded in the room. It was a person sitting at the tea table, wearing a long robe and a bamboo hat, their face obscured.

"Only 120 talismans!" Tan Hu sat down opposite the person with the bamboo hat, quite familiarly, and took out a brocade pouch from his embrace, handing it over.

"That's a bit few. Have you investigated the person you traded with thoroughly? Is there really a talisman crafting organization behind him?"

Tan Hu shook his head: "The number of talisman masters in the market is fixed. That kid's claim of a talisman crafting organization doesn't hold water!"

"So, that means he crafted all these talismans himself? You said his cultivation isn't high, yet he can produce so many talismans. His talent in talisman crafting must be extraordinary, I presume?"

"He's only been on the path of cultivation for a little over four years!" Tan Hu said slowly after a moment of silence.

"Impossible!" The person in the bamboo hat suddenly sat upright as if they had heard something unbelievable. "Four years? How could he become a talisman master like this in just four years? There's definitely something fishy!"

"I also think there's something off about him. He most likely possesses a certain Talisman Dao physique!" Tan Hu said with a serious expression: "Now, there are two possibilities: either he's a once-in-a-myriad-years genius, or there's really some damn organization behind him. I lean towards the former!"

The person in the bamboo hat was silent for a moment after hearing this, then slammed a fist on the table, saying with conviction: "This person must be brought under our control!"

Tan Hu shook his head: "It's difficult. He's always been wary of me, and he usually doesn't leave the market more than ten li. The Mo family patrols those areas very diligently, so I can't make a move!"

"Killing him isn't hard, but capturing him alive is almost impossible!"

Hearing this, the person wearing the bamboo hat was silent for a moment, then said: "The late-stage Qi Condensation experts in the organization are all busy with that matter and can't support you. You'll have to figure it out yourself! If you can capture this person, you'll have rendered a great service and will have a chance to obtain a Barrier-Breaking Pill!"

Hearing the words "Barrier-Breaking Pill," Tan Hu's breathing suddenly grew heavy. "Don't worry, I'll get this done!"
