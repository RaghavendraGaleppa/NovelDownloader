# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 125: The Eerie Dagger  

Compared to demonic beasts, plant spirits might not necessarily be more powerful, but they possessed one distinct characteristic. Ordinary demonic beasts constantly emitted demonic energy, making them easily detectable by cultivators who could then remain vigilant.  

However, plant spirits, unless they chose to reveal themselves, were indistinguishable from ordinary plants when motionless, effortlessly evading a cultivator's spiritual sense. This made them perfect for ambushes.  

The Daoist was ensnared by a vine as thick as a bucket, its surface covered in terrifying thorns. His face twisted in horror, though he also felt a sliver of relief. Had he not preemptively reinforced himself with a spiritual shield, this spirit would have already sent him to the underworld.  

A ruthless glint flashed in the Daoist's eyes!  

With a flip of his hand, a dagger appeared in his grasp. The dagger was pitch-black and utterly unremarkable in appearance, yet from a distance, Lin Xuan could sense an astonishing surge of spiritual energy emanating from it.  

The Daoist stabbed downward viciously!  

*Crack…*  

A strange, agonized shriek followed as the vine that had entangled the Daoist rapidly withered. Its once-vibrant color turned sickly yellow, as though its life force had been drained in an instant.  

"Audacious! How dare you harm the spirit of our Bìyún Mountain!"  

"Disgusting! You must have a death wish!"  

Shouts of fury and shock echoed, yet no figures appeared. Lin Xuan, hidden in the distance, furrowed his brows and concealed his presence even more carefully.  

Then, the blue light barrier began to shift.  

No longer shooting beams of light, the barrier now shimmered with an immortal aura as countless luminous swords separated from it.  

Red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, violet—a dazzling display of colors!  

"The Seven-Colored Sword Formation!"  

The Daoist gasped in horror, his face paling as if facing imminent doom.  

Lin Xuan's heart also trembled. Back in the Floating Cloud Valley, he had heard of the Seven-Colored Sword Formation—a formidable array capable of effortlessly slaying even Core Formation cultivators. He never expected to witness it here!  

"At least you recognize it. Now, go and join our spirit in death!"  

A cold, emotionless voice echoed from behind the light barrier. Then, countless radiant swords rose into the air, their dazzling colors painting a breathtaking yet deadly spectacle.  

*Sssshhh—*  

In almost an instant, the umbrella-shaped defensive spiritual artifact was shattered into useless scrap, and the Daoist was pierced through by thousands of swords, his body riddled with holes.  

Moments later, the blue light barrier vanished without a trace, as though it had never existed. The figures of several cultivators came into view.  

Two men and one woman.  

All appeared to be around thirty years old, though they were likely older. Given their early Foundation Establishment cultivation, unless they were prodigies, it was impossible for them to be so youthful.  

They must have cultivated techniques with potent age-preserving effects.  

The woman was plain in appearance but dressed flamboyantly, her every gesture exaggerated. She kicked the Daoist's corpse disdainfully. "This wretch actually dared to kill our mountain's Thorn Spirit. Death was too good for him!"  

"Junior Sister is right," one of the men agreed. "Though the Thorn Spirit only had two centuries of cultivation, it was a rare variant from the wildlands. Master went through great trouble to find it. Now, all three of us will face punishment."  

"Exactly!" the other man chimed in angrily. "We were going to spare his life to interrogate him—see who had the audacity to trespass into our Bìyún Mountain's herb garden. But since he refused to cooperate, we had no choice but to kill him."  

"Speaking of which…" The leftmost male disciple frowned. "Though the Thorn Spirit's cultivation wasn't high, its body was incredibly resilient. Even a top-grade spiritual artifact could barely scratch it. The only thing capable of killing it instantly would be a magic treasure."  

"Ha! Senior Brother, you jest," the other man scoffed. "What kind of trash was this rogue Daoist to possess a magic treasure? Even if he did, with his Foundation Establishment cultivation, he wouldn't be able to wield it."  

"Both Senior Brothers make valid points," the woman said with a coy laugh, covering her mouth. "But that dagger must have something special about it, or else it couldn't have destroyed the Thorn Spirit. Arguing is pointless—let’s just examine it."  

"Ah, Junior Sister is as clever as ever."  

"And if it truly is a rare treasure, it’ll fetch a hefty sum of spirit stones. We can split the profits three ways. Even if Master punishes us, it’ll be worth it!"  

"Senior Brother He, such bold words! If Master heard you, he’d lock you in the dark chamber for half a year!"  

Laughing and scolding, the woman crouched down to inspect the corpse. Listening to their conversation, Lin Xuan was equally curious but clenched his teeth and suppressed the urge to act.  

He had witnessed the terrifying power of the Seven-Colored Sword Formation firsthand. There was no way he would foolishly put himself in danger.  

With a disgusted kick, the woman shoved the Daoist's body aside and picked up his storage pouch.  

After channeling her spiritual sense into it, she easily located the dagger. A gleam of delight flashed across her face. "This is it."  

She retrieved it and held it in her palm as the two male disciples crowded around to examine it.  

But in the next moment, their expressions twisted in horror.  

"Junior Sister, be careful!"  

"It—it's alive!"  

"Ah—!"  

A scream tore through the air as blood splattered. The dagger pierced through the woman's heart in a flash before shooting off into the distance.  

The sudden turn of events left the two men stunned—one pale and trembling, the other frantically trying to staunch the woman's bleeding wounds.  

But it was too late. The woman’s eyes remained wide open, filled with disbelief. She had never imagined she would meet her end in such a manner.  

After a long silence, the two men finally regained their senses, exchanging uneasy glances. The destruction of the Thorn Spirit would have only earned them a scolding from their master, but now, with their junior sister dead…  

It wasn’t that they had any deep affection for her—rather, she was their master’s descendant from the mortal world. Neither dared imagine the wrath their master would unleash.  

"Wait—what about the dagger?"  

They searched for the culprit, scanning the area with their spiritual senses, but found nothing. Had the dagger truly gained sentience and flown off on its own? Or had someone stealthily taken it?
