Chapter 3: Good Noodles Require Three Kneads and Three Rests

At the crack of dawn, a faint light filled the bridal tent.

On the brocade bed, Suo Chanzhi lay on her side, her disheveled hair resembling wild grass flourishing in spring. Her exquisitely beautiful face was half-hidden amidst the tangled dark locks, her brows slightly furrowed, and tear stains faintly visible at the corners of her eyes.

A light, thin quilt was draped over her body, having slipped from her shoulder to reveal a patch of skin as smooth as jade. On that jade-like skin were several fresh bruises, turning the tender shoulder into the color of blue and white porcelain.

It was the hour of the rooster's crow, the fifth watch. Since there were no roosters on the Gobi, there was naturally no crowing, yet Suo Chanzhi opened her eyes at roughly the same time.

Her eyelids fluttered a few times before her eyes slowly opened. It took a good while for her hazy gaze to clear, and only then did she recall everything from last night. For a moment, she couldn't tell what she was feeling.

From this moment on, she was no longer the person she used to be.

Behind her, a scorching breath was steadily exhaling against her smooth back. Suo Chanzhi didn't dare to turn around. She bit her lip and endured for a while longer, gradually steadying her breathing before struggling to get up.

But the moment she moved, a wave of pain shot through her body, and she couldn't help but grit her teeth.

She had summoned Yang Can last night in full ceremonial attire. It was true that she had no white mourning clothes on the journey, but she also had her own little scheme. She knew that what happened that night could never see the light of day, but this was, after all, the important moment when she transformed from a young girl into a woman. She didn't want her life to be filled with too many regrets; she wanted this moment to give her as many beautiful memories as possible.

Yet the only impression left in her mind was one of roughness and brutality. Suo Chanzhi knew that that wretched man was deliberately tormenting her because he was unwilling to accept the situation.

She gritted her teeth and stubbornly tried to get up again. With just a slight movement, her beautiful brows furrowed once more, but she still forced herself to endure the discomfort and struggled to rise.

After she was fully dressed, she did a quick check and, seeing nothing unusual on her body, tiptoed out of the bridal tent.

Hearing the sound of the tent flap gently closing, Yang Can, who had been pretending to sleep, suddenly opened his eyes. He rolled over and grabbed the candlestick from the bedside table. First, he skillfully broke off half of the candle, placing the sharp-tipped copper candlestick within easy reach, then quickly got dressed.

When Yang Can was dressed and still no one came to silence him, he grabbed the candlestick and darted towards the tent entrance...

Yang Can had entered this timeline three years ago by accident. This world was not a historical period from his original world, but its historical development and geographical names were very similar to the late Northern and Southern Dynasties, just before the Sui and Tang in his original timeline. He seemed to have entered a parallel world.

Before his transmigration, Yang Can was a worker in the IT industry. The skills he had learned were naturally useless in this world. Being a stranger with nothing, he suffered a great deal when he first arrived. Just as he was about to starve to death, he was fortunate enough to be taken in by a horse ranch.

This ranch belonged to the Yu family of the Tianshui faction, one of the Eight Great Factions of Longshang. Yang Can worked there as a horse herder for two and a half years. Until half a year ago, a young man rode up on a horse and collapsed in front of him, continuously spitting out dark purple blood.

Yang Can randomly picked some herbs used for treating livestock, boiled them into a paste, and fed it to him. Unexpectedly, he actually managed to turn a dead horse back into a living one.

This "living horse" was the heir apparent of the Tianshui faction's Yu family, Yu Chengye.

Yu Chengye had been ambushed during a hunt, hit by a poisoned arrow. He was lucky enough to be saved by Yang Can while fleeing for his life. Young Master Yu, appreciating his extraordinary speech and the fact that he had saved his life, recruited Yang Can as a "guest advisor."

Yang Can's bitter days were finally over. He thought that by relying on the heir of a great faction, he would have everything he desired. Who knew that the wind would be too strong and the rain too heavy, and the tree would fall...

Regarding Suo Chanzhi's promise of being "second only to one person," Yang Can didn't believe a word of it. With such a grand conspiracy, the Suo family would never let him live. The problem was, he could no longer rely on the Yu family's power. Because even if he was completely innocent, the fact that he had slept with the Yu family's eldest daughter-in-law was an indisputable truth. For the Yu family, he, Yang Can, had given them a reason to kill him. If he wanted to survive now, he had to rely on himself.

Suo Chanzhi stumbled out of the bridal tent. In the rising sun, Grandma Tu was sitting cross-legged in front of the main tent, as if she never needed to sleep. Suo Chanzhi immediately lightened her steps, trying to make her posture and gait as light and natural as they were before last night. However, she still walked like a mermaid newly come ashore.

"Grandma Tu..." Suo Chanzhi stumbled to Grandma Tu's back, cleared her hoarse throat, and said in a low voice, "You can do it now!"

As she said this, the great beauty Suo's heart was completely calm. What talk of a day's marriage being a hundred days' kindness? Pah! The thought of that beast having treated her like livestock all night made her wish that wretched man would die right away. Considering that he would be the biological father of her child, not doing it herself was already the greatest kindness.

"Do it? Do what?" Grandma Tu turned her face around, looking at Suo Chanzhi in confusion.

Suo Chanzhi was also confused by her question and stammered, "Isn't it what you said, Grandma? After the deed is done, just..."

Grandma Tu suddenly understood and couldn't help but let out a "heh," saying impatiently, "After the deed is done? Is the deed done now? Are you sure the two of you only did it once and you're pregnant?"

Who said it was only once? Three times, four times... Three or four times? She was so muddled by the end she couldn't remember clearly, but it definitely wasn't just once. However, such details from the bedroom were too embarrassing to say out loud. She hesitated for a moment before saying timidly, "Wouldn't it be fine if it was just one night?"

"It's not impossible, it might work. Who knows if it's a sure thing? So, to be sure, it's better to do it a few more times to be reliable." Grandma Tu, who had never had a man, spoke with great confidence. "From now on, I will try to delay our progress. Miss Chanzhi, you must make full use of the time before we arrive at the Yu family. Ask him for it every day. As long as he can still hold on, make him hold on to the death. That way, our chances will be greater."

These wild and wolfish words made Suo Chanzhi's face flush red. Grandma Tu earnestly instructed, "Miss, you must seize this opportunity. We must have a child! Otherwise, we're finished!"

Suo Chanzhi nodded with a red face. The first step is the hardest, and now she has taken it. What else is there to be afraid of? Grandma Tu is right; if she can't get pregnant, wouldn't she have been bullied for nothing?

Suo Chanzhi and Grandma Tu were still talking outside when the flap of the bridal tent was quietly closed, hiding the pair of eyes that had been visible through the crack.

Yang Can, holding the candlestick, sat down by the tent door. Judging by the situation, at least for today, the Suo family wouldn't kill him to silence him. That gave him time to think about a counter-strategy.

It was early in the morning, and Suo Chanzhi, despite her discomfort, had gone to discuss matters with that Grandma Tu. This showed that Grandma Tu was likely an important figure in orchestrating all this. Yu Chengye had only been dead for less than an hour last night; could Suo Chanzhi have come up with such a method to break the situation? That seems highly unlikely. A young bride suddenly faced with such a great change, how could she calm down so quickly and come up with such an astonishing solution?

Perhaps there are no shortage of prodigies in this world, but Suo Chanzhi clearly isn't one of them. This bride isn't the type of woman with deep scheming. Last night, this noble daughter of the Suo family wanted to set rules for him, but what happened? He ended up "setting" her into "gui" (rules) and "ju" (boundaries)... and she was completely powerless to resist. A brand new car that hadn't even been broken in was almost driven to engine seizure by him.

Yang Can had already seen through her "fierce on the outside but weak on the inside." With Suo Chanzhi's ability to react, it was highly unlikely she was a genius beauty with superior intellect. Therefore, Grandma Tu is not only a participant in the seed-borrowing plan, but also... very likely the planner of the plan...

Thinking of this, Yang Can couldn't help but frown. This inference is logical, but it lacks the fundamental motive for the logic to hold: He was the groom's escort. Along the way, he was the Yu family member who had the most contact with the Suo family. He remembered that this Grandma Tu was not Suo Chanzhi's dowry maid, but was given to Suo Chanzhi by the main wife of the Suo family.

If Grandma Tu had raised Suo Chanzhi since childhood, one could say she treated Suo Chanzhi like her own daughter and was therefore willing to risk execution to plan for her. But since Grandma Tu was a gift from the main wife of the Suo family, how could she have such deep feelings for Suo Chanzhi? The reason Suo Chanzhi gave him was her own motive, not Grandma Tu's motive for actively participating.

Therefore, Grandma Tu must have another purpose. What could her purpose be?

As an IT industry worker, the knowledge Yang Can learned in his previous life was naturally useless in this world. However, the core qualities and transferable skills cultivated during the process of learning and practicing those skills could still be useful in this life. For example, the ability to deconstruct problems and deduce causality; the ability to formulate plans and optimize processes; the ability to integrate information and learn quickly; and the ability to understand and adapt across cultures...

To break this situation, he not only needs to know who formulated the plan, but also what the other party's true purpose is. With the information he currently has, it's not enough for him to make an accurate judgment on this matter. Since the Suo family has no intention of killing him now, he needs to use this precious time to figure all of this out as soon as possible, so he can take targeted action and make a response!

Thinking of this, Yang Can put the candlestick back on the bedside table, stuck the candle back in, and then turned and walked out of the tent.

When Yang Can walked out of the tent, Suo Chanzhi had already disappeared. The scrawny old woman, Grandma Tu, stood in front of him like a ghost.
