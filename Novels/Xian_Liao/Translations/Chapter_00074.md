# Chapter 74: Decapitation

Zhou Qing received a letter from Zhang Jingxiu detailing the matter of the great pine tree on Mount Taihe.

"It's actually related to the mulberry branch from the great mulberry tree?"

Zhou Qing found this quite surprising, but Zhang Jingxiu and Xiao Ruowang wouldn't joke about such matters. It seemed the mulberry branch from the great mulberry tree had indeed caused changes in the ancient pine tree on Mount Taihe.

"That welcoming pine on Mount Taihe has stood for countless years. The yin energy from the great mulberry tree must have awakened some latent sinister and eerie qualities within it."

Having embarked on the path of immortality, encountering such supernatural phenomena was only natural.

His cultivation had reached another stable transitional phase where he could practice anywhere, though the effects would vary.

The incomplete version of the Evergreen Immortality Technique offered two methods of qi refinement: one involved absorbing extraordinary energies from nature, such as the yin energy from the great mulberry tree, the faint spiritual energy in his courtyard, or consuming rare elixirs...

Coincidentally, Zhou Qing had obtained snow ginseng and jade toads from the Enchantress. After reaching the Xiantian realm, he refined them into Snow Ginseng Jade Toad Pills, which provided slight assistance in cultivation.

Additionally, the human body contained essence, and refining essence into qi. His achievements in physical cultivation greatly aided his qi refinement. Extracting essence from his own blood and qi to cultivate true qi progressed at about the same rate as absorbing yin energy from the great mulberry tree.

Blood and qi could also be replenished through food and nourishing elixirs.

However, cultivating with the great mulberry tree had the added benefit of harmonizing yin and yang while suppressing the tree's sinister energy.

Zhou Qing now realized that if he hadn't continuously absorbed the mulberry tree's yin energy while channeling his excessive yang energy into it, the tree might have demonized and harmed living creatures.

In a way, he had been using his own body to feed a potential demon, which could be considered a virtuous deed.

Moreover, during his spare time, Zhou Qing had developed fasting pills. These could be taken with water during travels through wilderness areas to sustain himself. However, the cost of producing these pills was too high to make them practical for widespread use, such as military rations.

Currently, Zhou Qing was at the peak of the first level of body refinement. Fushan had likely reached the second level, while Fusong and Zhang Jingxiu were at the first level. Having come from martial arts backgrounds focused on blood and qi, their achievements in qi refinement lagged behind their physical cultivation.

But Zhou Qing differed from Zhang Jingxiu and Fusong. Before reaching the Xiantian realm, Zhou Qing had already undergone blood and qi transformation, marrow cleansing, and bone replacement. Thus, upon entering the Xiantian realm, he immediately reached the peak of the first level of body refinement.

As for Fushan, after wandering the mountains for years and losing his sanity, his mind had become childlike, allowing him to focus solely on cultivation while instinctively consuming rare herbs and the flesh of fierce beasts. This had enabled him to reach the second level of body refinement.

Zhou Qing only needed to complete the natural transformation that came with reaching the Xiantian realm to smoothly advance to the second level of body refinement.

Now that Fusong had also lost his mind, following Fushan's path, there was still some chance he might break through to the second level. However, Fusong's foundation was significantly weaker than Fushan's and even inferior to Zhang Jingxiu's.

Among the four Xiantian masters, Zhou Qing's path to immortality was the smoothest, followed by the insane Fushan. Zhang Jingxiu, through the Taihe Sect's Sun and Moon Spirit Refinement Technique, had hope of catching up to Fushan. Fusong was likely the weakest.

"Second Brother still isn't up to par!"

If Fusong recovered from his madness too soon, it might hinder his body refinement. But if he remained insane for too long... well, though madness might aid cultivation, who would actually want to be insane?

Additionally,
