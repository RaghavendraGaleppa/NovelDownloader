Chapter 18: When the Spring Rain Arrives

The first rain of spring had arrived.

It began with heavy, distinct drops, like marbles clattering against the green roof tiles. Soon, a sound like a roaring tide rose from the forest, hazy as the mist kicked up by a waterfall. Thunder rolled in waves, and the ridge beasts crouching on the upturned eaves seemed to come alive in that moment. From the mouths of each beast, streams of glistening water flowed down.

On the山庄’s (mountain manor’s) flat, flagstone ground, the rain pecked out dense, jumping droplets. Even the kitchen smoke, drifting from the cookhouse, was softened by the rain, diagonally entwining itself within the curtain of water.

In the courtyard stood an apricot tree. Its newly bloomed pink-white petals stretched out to meet the rain arrows, each one cupping a pool of heavenly water.

Yang Can stood in the wing room, the window open. Through the rain curtain hanging beneath the eaves, he watched the scene in the courtyard.

There, two rows of sword-wielding warriors stood solemnly on either side of the flagstone path, clad in straw raincoats. Rainwater flowed rapidly from their coats to the ground.

On the long flagstone path, a tall, slightly hunched figure strode forward. The guard holding an umbrella for him had to jog to keep up with his pace.

Ahead, under the ceremonial gate, appeared a graceful figure dressed in plain white. It was Suo Chanzhi, as beautiful and delicate as a pear blossom in the rain. She stood beneath the hanging flower gate cover of the second gate. Seeing the tall figure arrive before her, she bowed gracefully.

The tall figure stopped. It was unclear what he said to Suo Chanzhi, but she bowed to him again before turning to walk with him into the second courtyard. Two umbrellas drifted slowly toward the main hall of the second courtyard.

*Who is this person? Could it be the Suo family’s...*

Just as Yang Can thought of this, he heard a crisp voice. "That is the Second Master of our Suo family."

Yang Can retracted his gaze and looked toward the speaker. It was Little Qingmei. She held an oil-paper umbrella and stood beneath the apricot tree.

"The Suo family's Second Master has arrived?"

Qingmei nodded slightly. "After Young Master Yu died, Matron Tu sent someone riding day and night to report to the Suo family. Upon hearing the news, our Clan Master immediately sent the Second Master over."

Yang Can’s heart leaped with joy. Without the Suo family's involvement, this play would be hard to perform well. Fortunately, the key actor had arrived!

Qingmei paused and added, "The day before yesterday, the Clan Master gathered the elders of the Yu family and went to the water prison."

"What is in the water prison?" Yang Can asked.

"The water prison holds that horse thief. Oh! That's right, Commander Cheng is inside as well," Qingmei replied.

Yang Can nodded. *Very good, the opening drum has sounded; the grand play is about to begin.*

"Thank you for the trouble, Qingmei," Yang Can said with a smile, nodding to Little Qingmei. He knew she had come specifically to tell him this news. It was very likely Suo Chanzhi who had sent her.

Little Qingmei raised her oil-paper umbrella and tilted her head to look at Yang Can. Her white teeth peeked from between her red lips, looking as if she wanted to say something but hesitated. In the end, she said nothing, merely pursed her lips, lifted her skirt, and drifted away gracefully.

She wore a pair of high-toothed wooden clogs, so that when she stepped into the water, it wouldn't easily wet her feet. Yang Can watched from the window. They were a pair of lacquered black wooden clogs, with indigo straps tied around ivory-white ankles, making those ankles look exceptionally slender.

When she lifted her foot, the wooden clog and her snow-white foot would separate; she would hook the clog with just her toes, creating a perfect arc between her arch and the clog. When she set her foot down, the clog would touch the ground first. With a soft "tap," her light, delicate foot would land on the clog, like a goose's web lightly touching the water.

The rhythm of the feet was a delight to the eye. Yang Can couldn't help narrowing his eyes. Not only was her mouth small, but her feet were small too. He estimated they were around a size 32 or 33.

Little Qingmei, holding her umbrella in one hand and her skirt in the other, suddenly stopped and turned back to look at Yang Can. She had suddenly remembered something she wanted to tell him. Their Second Master Suo had a temper as fierce as fire. If Yang Can were to confront him, he had to be careful not to provoke him, or else a beating would be the lightest consequence.

But as she turned back, she caught Yang Can staring at her.

Qingmei's eyebrows shot up dangerously.

Oblivious, Yang Can raised his eyebrows at her, looking puzzled.

"Tap!"

Her wooden clog stomped hard on the flagstone floor!

*At a time like this, he still has the free time to peek at my butt? This reckless, death-seeking bastard!*

Little Qingmei was both embarrassed and angry, though she didn't notice a faint sense of secret pleasure mixed in. She went off with a "tap-tap-tap," walking with great force, the clogs making a crisp string of sounds on the flagstones, like scattered chess pieces.

Yang Can inexplicably touched his chin. *What’s wrong with her?*

Qingmei, her little face绷紧 (tightly绷紧), disappeared through the gate of the second courtyard without looking back. In the rain curtain, only the Suo family guards remained, standing as rigid as spears.

*What's interesting about guards?* Yang Can closed the window.

The "clattering" sound of the rain was blocked outside, though it still drifted in through the cracks.

Yang Can lay back on the bed and closed his eyes slightly.

Everyone was here. It was time to raise the curtain on the play.

For him, the most critical moment had arrived!

Whether he could transform from an extra into a leading actor on this stage depended entirely on his performance from here on out.

In the rain, in the Mingde Hall of Phoenix Mountain Manor, the heads of the various branches of the Yu family and the elders were all seated. The sound of the dripping rain outside made the atmosphere in the hall somewhat oppressive.

The funeral had been held, and the mourners had all descended the mountain, but the Yu family members remained. The Yu family was vast and populous; it was rare to have such an opportunity to gather everyone so completely. Naturally, they had to discuss some important family affairs.

Especially since the heir apparent had just died, the Yu family had to consider a major issue: the establishment of an heir!

Establishing an heir in the Yu family was like establishing a crown prince in a country; there had to be a designated successor recognized by all parties.

Logically, since Yu Chengye was gone, Yu Chenglin, the second son of Yu Xinglong, should be established as the heir.

However, it was well known that the Clan Master Yu Xinglong was frail and chronically ill. Yu Xinglong's second son, Yu Chenglin, was only seven years old this year. It would take at least twenty years for him to have the ability to stand on his own.

But given the Clan Master's health, whether he could hold on for another twenty years was uncertain to everyone.

Although the Yu family was, in fact, a local regime that needed to draw on the governance experience of a dynasty in many aspects, it was also more flexible, and its rules were not as rigid as an imperial court's.

In such an unstable future situation, for the stable development and inheritance of the family, the heir did not necessarily have to be the second son of the main line.

Today, Yu Xinglong had convened the elders and heads of the various branches in the Mingde Hall to discuss matters. Everyone had guessed that the establishment of an heir would be the most important topic today.

As expected, after everyone was seated, Yu Xinglong dispensed with any掩饰 (disguised) or委婉 (euphemistic) process and got straight to the point, stating the reason for today's family meeting.

"My son Chengye died young. The Yu family must establish a new heir. My second son Chenglin, though young, is quite intelligent. I wish to establish Chenglin as the heir. Does anyone from the various branches have any objections?"

Upon hearing this, the heads of the various branches subconsciously looked at Yu Huanhu.

Yu Huanhu kept his eyes on his nose and his nose on his heart, looking like an old monk entering a state of meditation, not saying a word.

Too many people believed Yu Chengye's death was related to him. At this time, his every word and action could be misinterpreted, placing him in an awkward position. It was not suitable for him to jump out and challenge this openly.

After waiting for a moment and seeing that the hall was silent, Yu Xinglong coughed lightly and said slowly, "If you all have no objections, then this Clan Master shall announce..."

"Big Brother, wait a moment! This little brother has something to say!"

Finally, someone stood up.

The one who spoke was Yu Xiaobao, the head of the third lineage of the Yu family's main branch.

Yu Xinglong's generation had three brothers: Yu Xinglong, Yu Huanhu, and Yu Xiaobao.

When Young Master Bao was young, he would lead three or five arrogant servants every day, carrying hawks and hunting with dogs, frequenting the pleasure quarters. He was a complete playboy.

A person like this was naturally unfit for great responsibility, so the power of the main branch had basically been divided up by his two older brothers.

Who would have thought that after this playboy turned forty, he suddenly became "unconfused" and started dedicating himself to business?

However, Young Master Bao had started his career too late. The main branch's "cake" had already been divided up by his two older brothers, and he was a man with great ambition but little ability. What kind of business could he possibly run?

Yu Xinglong and Yu Huanhu both treated this younger brother as a joke, letting him do as he pleased and not bothering to discipline him much. It didn't matter anyway.

But no one expected that in such a setting today, he would jump out.

Yu Xinglong did not look at Yu Xiaobao but first glanced at Yu Huanhu. He wasn't sure if the third brother suddenly jumping out was at the instigation of the second brother.

Yu Xiaobao said boldly, "Big Brother, speaking of Chenglin, that child is indeed very intelligent. But he is too young, and Big Brother, you are too old—no, I mean your health is too weak. With Chenglin's age and Big Brother's health, is it really appropriate to establish Chenglin as the heir?"

Such blunt words could only be spoken by Yu Xiaobao; he had been like this since he was a child. However, what he said was also what many people were worried about.

The mortality rate for children in this era was too high. Who could guarantee that a seven-year-old child would grow up without illness or disaster? Besides, it was well known that Yu Xinglong's health was poor. If Yu Chenglin hadn't grown up yet and Yu Xinglong had already passed away, what would they do?

Yu Xinglong's face darkened. He glanced coldly at Yu Xiaobao and asked, "Then, according to Third Brother's opinion, what should be done?"

Yu Xiaobao said, "I think that child Ziming is quite good."

Ziming was a courtesy name. His given name was Yu Rui, and he was Yu Huanhu's eldest son.

Yu Huanhu glanced faintly at Yu Xiaobao. *Third Brother is really a cute little thing. His method of instigating conflict between me and Big Brother is as naive as ever.*

Seeing that Yu Huanhu didn't respond, Yu Xiaobao actively pulled him into the water, asking, "Second Brother, what do you think of my suggestion?"

Yu Huanhu smiled, the two nasolabial folds as clear as knife marks划过 (cutting across) the sand. He shook his head and said slowly, "Not very good. My son, Yu Rui, is not qualified."
