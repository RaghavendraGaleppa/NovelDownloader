# Chapter 327: The Soul Returns, The Great Saint's Shadow, Han Zhen Dies!

In the rear of the chaotic battlefield, a series of ferocious roars echoed, sounding as if they had resounded from extremely ancient times to the present day.

Dozens of terrifying Disaster Beasts crossed the battlefield, most of which were Great Demons, and there were even several Demon Kings!

The Nine-Headed Bird was shrouded in black clouds. As its wings flapped, the sound of yin winds howling and vengeful spirits moaning could be faintly heard. The earth's veins surged, and the ground rolled up—a Great Demon was burrowing underground. A Great Wind stirred up boundless gales, rampaging across the battlefield...

"Hahaha, that brat is mine!"

"These humans are so weak; they can't even wear down a bit of our spirit. We have to rely on us."

"Save a mouthful of flesh for me! I want to see if this golden body tempered by fire is crunchy when chewed!"

These high-level Disaster Beasts were existences capable of wreaking havoc in a region and destroying cities and nations. Now, they surged forth en masse. Wherever they passed, they不分敵我 (didn't distinguish friend from foe), crushing everything in their path.

The arrival of this "reinforcement unit" caused the enemy side to pay a painful price first.

Such a scene was like the end of the days.

Even the Greenwood defenders on the city wall couldn't help but look at each other, seeing the wavering in each other's eyes.

"If the Disaster Beasts had attacked the city like this on the first day, would we have... been crushed instantly?"

"Can Young Master Li and Commander Qu break through such a heavy encirclement?"

"I just shot an arrow. That arrow could pierce through bluestone, yet before it could touch that Great Wind, it was blown away like a piece of withered grass..."

"Can we... still win?"

High-level Disaster Beasts seem to have a natural deterrent effect on humans.

This is the reason they were worshipped as gods for so many years, and it is also the result.

Once they appear, they symbolize a great disaster.

They are the root of disaster and the embodiment of fear.

It should be noted that many of the Greenwood defenders were recruited locally, and their fear of Disaster Beasts is engraved in their bones.

"Young Master Li is still fighting in the thick of battle, and you guys are talking such pessimistic nonsense behind his back?!"

Wu Lang had a few teeth missing, his mouth full of blood, and his speech was slanted. He scanned the crowd, causing some soldiers who were frightened to lower their heads, stopping the spread of panic.

"Heaven never seals off all roads."

"I haven't even run yet, what are you afraid of?!"

Huang Donglai appeared on the wall, covered in dust. He had been deep in thought for a long time. If it were Brother Li, what would he do now?

"If we tie the Thunderfire Crisping Pills to crossbow bolts and shoot them out..."

"Even if the bolts can't hurt the enemy, the explosions should at least have some effect."

After Huang Donglai finished speaking, Wu Lang's eyes lit up.

However, after searching for a long time...

Huh?

Where were the remaining Thunderfire Crisping Pills?

...

"Young Master Li, just charge forward."

Qu Sheng rode the Snow-Treading White Dragon, and the aura of the Outer Scene began to emanate from him.

The Inner Scene can form a domain.

The Outer Scene, however, is truly able to release the scene in one's heart to influence the heavens and earth.

Li Mo looked over in a daze. He saw Qu Sheng as he spoke, his wildly dancing black hair suddenly frosted over.

"Who says that upon the success of a general, the names of the dead are forgotten?"

"I remember them..."

Qu Sheng remembered every fallen comrade.

He came from a poor family and joined the army early. At first, he was a child soldier, doing the work of collecting bodies and cleaning up the battlefield.

This was actually a lucrative job. If he secretly took a few things from the corpses, as long as the squad leader received some "filial piety," he would turn a blind eye.

But his luck was probably bad.

He encountered people who hadn't breathed their last many times while collecting bodies.

He thus learned the secrets of many dying people, and his realm improved rapidly. Because he understood the reasons why many people died in battle, he actually managed to survive by crawling through the battlefield.

He remembered many names because of this.

Many of those names didn't even appear on the casualty lists.

He also heard this sentence countless times:

"Take my share and live on together."

Later, the child Qu became Squad Leader Qu, Platoon Leader Qu, Battalion Leader Qu...

He observed the gods, and it came naturally.

The dying gifts of his comrades成就了 (achieved) the Greenwood Commander of today.

One, dozens, hundreds, thousands... The sound of hooves went from sparse to a storm-like intensity. Having lost his personal troops, Qu Sheng once again had thousands of soldiers and horses behind him.

Those long-dead soldiers transformed into battle-souls drenched in blood, standing behind him once again.

The soul returns!

This is his Outer Scene.

"Today, I shall die with you all to fulfill a great regret of my life!"

"Shall we go to the Yellow Springs together?!"

Greenwood Commander Qu Sheng, having absorbed over fifty thousand battle-soul soldiers and armor.

Is a God-General of the present age!

The torrent of battle-souls swept across the battlefield. The dead followed their armor-stripped commander and crashed head-on into the tide of Disaster Beasts.

The Disaster Beasts were fierce and wild, but the battle-soul soldiers were already dead; how could one merely describe them as "fearless of death"?

They even carried Thunderfire Crisping Pills!

When their forms were about to dissipate, they would pounce on the Disaster Beasts and detonate themselves!

For a time, the momentum of those high-level Disaster Beasts was forcibly halted.

"Commander..."

Li Mo sat atop his Cloud Horse.

Silently, he had swapped the hammer in his hand for one identical to the previous one, unnoticed by anyone.

The Ten-Thousand-Enemy Hammer can accommodate a hundred sets of armor.

What if he added the power of the World Force?

The World Force now was no longer what it used to be. As his realm increased, it could no longer be called a World Seed; it could now be called a nascent small world.

He was still not at the Inner Scene, unable to project it out.

---

However, merely utilizing its power was already a majestic force like a collapsing mountain or a turning tide.

Li Mo remained silent, enduring these two forces. Even with his formidable physique, he felt the subtle signs of being overburdened.

His eyes now held only one target.

"Han Zhen!"

A Great Demon Disaster Beast blocking the front, unable to dodge in time, was shattered head-on by the charge.

The golden light of his Vajra Body dissipated, and he broke through the blood mist.

At this moment, all the totems around him were dimmed by the shadow above his head.

The battlefield fell silent.

The space before him suddenly cleared, for no enemy dared to stand in his way. Just this aura was enough to make those所谓的勇士 (so-called warriors) tremble with fear.

Gods?

Gods can die too.

When the gods in their eyes, who were omnipotent and controlled natural disasters, were blocked and killed, their faith collapsed along with them.

No one knew who fled first.

But it immediately triggered a chain reaction, leading to a total rout.

"I didn't expect... you really could reach me."

"What kind of power is this..."

Han Zhen felt his scalp tingling at this moment, panicking for the first time, unable to maintain the dignity of a Grand Imperial Preceptor.

But he knew he couldn't run.

Running would only lead to a faster death.

"Yet the blood sacrifice is still not enough..."

That blood-red arm opened the mouth on its palm grotesquely, writhing uncontrollably, and took a bite out of Han Zhen's abdomen.

Han Zhen's face turned pale.

One of his internal organs had been eaten.

He formed an ancient hand seal. The bronze divine tree behind him continuously collapsed and disappeared, while a blood shadow emerged from within.

Han Zhen hugged the sky with his arms in the air, a pathological, fanatical smile on his face:

"The Blood God granted me eternal life! What can you use to kill me?!"

"I am the Grand Imperial Preceptor of the Great Shang! And you... a guard of the imperial tomb..."

A terrifying and ancient aura descended.

Thousands of red lights gradually enveloped Han Zhen.

It seemed as if something was using him to descend.

In the void, a gaze fell upon Li Mo, filled with infinite malice and greed.

"Grand Imperial Preceptor of the Great Shang?"

Li Mo looked straight ahead at the man who felt like the master of the heavens and earth, who once held the Great Dao, standing above all others.

He spat out a mouthful of blood.

"Go to hell!"

*Rumble—*

The Cataclysmic Meteor Hammer let out an excited roar. The hammer treasure was finally able to smash something to its heart's content, acting like a vortex, indiscriminately devouring all power.

"Die!"

Han Zhen faced this hammer head-on. Every inch of his skin peeled away in pieces, revealing the flesh and blood beneath.

He no longer had any space to cast any secret techniques.

Similarly.

Li Mo couldn't use that invulnerable, indestructible Vajra Body for the time being!

"Just survive this one hammer..."

The blood shadow behind Han Zhen let out an agitated roar.

That unnaturally strong arm, having devoured the boundless blood essence, grotesquely detached itself from Han Zhen's shoulder and grew endlessly.

Then it turned into layers of flesh cocoons, wrapping him up layer by layer.

Li Mo wouldn't stop, nor could he stop.

The Eighty Strikes arrived as scheduled!

Why are the stars getting closer?

No, it's not that the stars are closer.

It's the sky collapsing!

The Sky-Overturning Strike!

The power of the battle formation, the Heaven-Defying Battle Secret, the seven Xuan Dan, the World Force... all were condensed into this single hammer strike.

*Boom—*

The flesh cocoon was instantly obliterated. Han Zhen, trapped inside, was shaken out violently. In mid-air, his eyes were still filled with disbelief.

In a daze, Li Mo's figure merged with the godly intent fighting against the heavens behind him, covering him.

The blood god shadow behind Han Zhen, like dew seeing the morning sun, evaporated instantly.

"Blood Phoenix Essence... Ancestral Spirit... Blood God... Save me!"

Han Zhen's fear was meaningless.

His will to restore the nation wasn't firm; he only had the ambition to make a comeback under the banner of restoration. Now, it all turned to nothing under this hammer.

The air on the battlefield seemed to solidify.

Han Zhen.

Is dead!

Li Mo watched the other party disperse.

He finally couldn't hold back the darkness before his eyes. He barely put the hammer treasure away, but didn't dare to let go of the breath in his heart.

He had achieved the feat of taking the head of the enemy commander amidst ten thousand soldiers.

But he was still in the midst of ten thousand enemies.

There were wolves circling around.

But Little Li, at this moment, besides barely being able to stand, couldn't even move a finger, let alone summon the Somersault Cloud.

PS: I could have updated earlier. Last time, a reader lord complained about stopping at a critical point, so I stayed up all night to finish this segment in one go.

My liver hurts, please charge and support, reader lords.
