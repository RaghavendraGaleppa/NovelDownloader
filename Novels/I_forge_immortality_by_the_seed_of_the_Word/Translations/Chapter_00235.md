**Chapter 233: Distinction Among True Disciples, Heavenly Injury Demonic Star**

"Why hasn't Junior Brother Zhang Jing arrived yet? Is he perhaps not in the Grotto-heaven?"

Sitting in the third seat of the front row, a man dressed in a light grey daoist robe spoke, a smile of unclear meaning on his face, as if hinting at something. He seemed to be talking to himself.

However, as soon as his voice sounded, the eyes of everyone else in the hall involuntarily fell upon Feng Wuyu, who was sitting in the second seat of the front row, eyes closed in meditation.

Hearing these words, Feng Wuyu slowly opened his eyes and subtly glanced at Senior Sister Kong in the first seat. He paused, then patiently explained, "Junior Brother Zhang Jing is cultivating in his daoist temple. He just received a decree from Venerable Master, so he should be on his way now. Junior Brother Jian, please wait patiently."

No sooner had the words left his mouth than the previously speaking Jian Zhongfu exclaimed, "Junior Brother has actually established a daoist temple in our Heavenly Realm? Isn't that a bit too reckless?"

"Yes, it is," said a red-robed woman in the fourth seat of the front row, her delicate brows slightly furrowed as she picked up the conversation, complaining somewhat, "Junior Brother Zhang Jing is only at the Golden Core Realm. Why would he think of establishing a daoist temple so early? Can he find a suitable spiritual land? At such a cultivation level, it would be better to cultivate honestly in the Grotto-heaven, otherwise, he wouldn't have delayed things like today."

"Junior Sister Zhai, you jest," Feng Wuyu said with a faint smile, his tone light and breezy, "The matter of Junior Brother establishing a daoist temple in the Heavenly Realm was approved by Venerable Master, so there must be a reason for it. We are not Junior Brother, how can we arbitrarily comment? If you wish to know about Junior Brother's daoist temple, we can go and visit after this True Disciple Dharma Assembly. Coincidentally, Junior Brother Zhang Jing is just establishing his daoist temple, and according to custom, he needs to preach a sermon to the disciples to complete the karmic cycle."

"As for Junior Sister's talk of 'delaying things', Venerable Master has not even appeared yet."

"Enough!" Senior Sister Kong swept her gaze across the faces of the three people on her right and suddenly spoke, "Considering this is Junior Brother Zhang Jing's first time attending the Grotto-heaven True Disciple Dharma Assembly, I ask all junior brothers and sisters to be more understanding."

"We respectfully obey Senior Sister's admonition!" Everyone responded in unison.

Feng Wuyu said nothing, merely taking another deep look at Senior Sister Kong.

...

Time flowed slowly.

A terrifying Dao Body with a bird's face and human body suddenly appeared directly above the grand hall. The void itself abruptly came alive, becoming incredibly active, as if it had truly gained sentience.

This was—

Below, Zhang Jing, who had just arrived and had barely settled into his seat, couldn't help but feel a tremor of shock as he looked at this Dao Body of his Venerable Master.

The last time he saw this Dao Body, his cultivation was still low. At that time, he was merely surprised by its grotesque appearance, but felt nothing else.

This time was completely different. Behind what seemed to be the empty back of this Dao Body of his Venerable Master, Zhang Jing's spiritual sense stirred, faintly perceiving the existence of six sky-shrouding wings, formless and insubstantial, omnipresent, condensing the boundless Dao of Void, and becoming a master of the void with a single thought.

The next instant, a majestic Daoist sound resonated. Zhang Jing suddenly snapped back to his senses.

"Since everyone is here, this Grotto-heaven True Disciple Dharma Assembly will proceed as usual," True Monarch Yuanming said indifferently, glancing at the disciples below.

As his voice fell, he closed his eyes, and his figure immediately sank into layers of void, appearing indistinctly.

"We respectfully obey Venerable Master's command!"

Below, the nine true disciples, including Zhang Jing, instantly stood up, bowed in unison, and responded respectfully.

With that, two meditation cushions quietly appeared above everyone. Senior Sister Kong and Senior Brother Feng Wuyu simultaneously vanished from their spots and reappeared on the cushions.

"This time, it will still be hosted by Junior Brother Feng and me," Senior Sister Kong began. "There are three matters for all junior brothers and sisters to discuss and deliberate upon. The first is the specific arrangements for your duty shifts within the Grotto-heaven over the next thousand years."

With that, Senior Sister Kong smiled at Zhang Jing and then said, "Junior Brother Zhang Jing, your cultivation is still low, so it's best for you to focus on cultivating. Therefore, I will not arrange for you to participate in duty shifts this time."

"Junior Brother understands," Zhang Jing said calmly, bowing slightly.

"Good!"

...

Who knew how much time had passed.

"Next, we begin the second item: discussing the management of the 1,927 secret realms belonging to the Vermilion Heaven Grand Haze Grotto-heaven."

Upon hearing this, Zhang Jing's eyes brightened, no longer holding their previous calm. If he understood correctly, what Senior Sister Kong just said meant that the Grotto-heaven had nearly two thousand secret realms under its jurisdiction? And these secret realms were actually given by Venerable Master for them, the true disciples, to manage?

*Whoosh—*

Zhang Jing's heart pounded violently. Having experienced the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, he naturally understood how immense the gains would be if one could manage a secret realm.

However, the next moment, Senior Sister Kong's voice came, delivering a harsh blow.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, your cultivation is still low, so I won't be assigning any specific secret realms for you to manage."

Zhang Jing's gaze instantly hardened. However, the very next sentence that followed made him breathe a sigh of relief.

"But Junior Brother, rest assured, you will not receive a single fraction less of the fortune that is due to you."

"Thank you, Senior Sister," Zhang Jing responded with a smile.

It was at this moment that Feng Wuyu, who had been silent for a long time, finally couldn't help but speak, "Senior Sister Kong, this action might be a bit inappropriate. What does managing a secret realm have to do with one's cultivation level?"

"Junior Brother, you jest. How can it be unrelated to cultivation? If Junior Brother Zhang Jing were at the Dao Integration Realm today, would he have been this late?" Senior Sister Kong said with a composed expression. "Furthermore, the fortune due to Junior Brother Zhang Jing will not be diminished by a single fraction by us. If Junior Brother Feng still insists, why don't we put this matter to a vote among all junior brothers and sisters again?"

"Another vote?" Feng Wuyu looked at the few people below who seemed to be avoiding his gaze, couldn't help but snort coldly, then said expressionlessly, "Senior Sister's arrangements are excellent. Junior Brother admires them."

Below, Zhang Jing looked at Senior Brother Feng Wuyu, who appeared isolated and helpless. He wanted to help, but before he could speak, he was stopped by the other's gaze. He suddenly realized that with his current cultivation, he definitely couldn't interject now, nor was he capable of refuting anything. At this moment, the only thing he could do was listen quietly.

"Is there some other profound mystery to this right to manage secret realms?" His eyes flickered slightly.

However, the next moment, Zhang Jing shook his head slightly, a sudden sense of detachment rising in his heart. Anyway, looking at the current situation, he wouldn't get even a sliver of the right to manage secret realms this time. Since that was the case, why bother thinking so much about it?

...

...

Sanyuan City.

In a dimly lit room in a small alley.

"Darling, it's time for your medicine."

A woman dressed plainly but whose exquisite beauty could not be concealed carefully brought a bowl of cloudy herbal soup to the bedside, her voice gentle.

"My dear wife, you've suffered these past few days. Once I'm better, I'll go out and sell steamed buns."

Wu Da on the bed struggled to sit up, tremblingly took the herbal soup, and began to drink it in small sips. However, after only two sips, he felt something was wrong. Today's medicine... had a faint, sweet, fishy taste, making him want to vomit and difficult to swallow.

"Wife, today's medicine—" Noticing his wife's evasive gaze, Wu Da's voice trailed off.

As if possessed, the reminder from that young master years ago echoed in his mind. He seemed to realize something, looked at his wife in disbelief, and made to throw the bowl in his hand.

However, it was already too late.

"Quick! Make Darling drink the soup, there's no turning back. If we delay any longer, if Second Brother comes back and discovers something, how could you and I possibly survive?" A hoarse voice quietly reached Pan Jinlian's ear.

Her heart tightened.

No sooner said than done. Pan Jinlian disregarded everything else, rushed forward in a panic, taking two steps at a time, grabbed the medicine bowl, and poured it directly into Wu Da's mouth.

"Darling, my darling!" She cried, tears streaming down her face like pear blossoms in the rain, as she poured the poison. The intense sorrow in her voice made everyone who heard it weep.

A hunched figure also rushed in, firmly pressing down Wu Da's flailing legs, the smile on his face growing even more radiant.

Two hours later.

In the county yamen.

"Wu Da died suddenly of illness?" Li Jiu abruptly stood up, a hint of surprise on his face.

The next moment, "Trouble! All of you, quickly follow me to the scene. This Wu Da knows a very important person. If this isn't handled properly..." Thinking of this, a sense of solemnity arose in Li Jiu's heart. Before, he didn't know the young master's true identity, and he dared not neglect him in the slightest, let alone now.

"Yes!"

Not long after, a large group of people swiftly walked out of the county yamen, heading directly towards Wu Da's residence.

No one noticed that the moment Wu Da died, a trace of black divine light suddenly illuminated, instantly covering all of Sanyuan City. And it was spreading at an extremely terrifying speed in a certain direction, its target none other than Zhang Jing's Spiritual Pivot Mountain Daoist Temple!

On the other side, under the shroud of the black divine light, in less than half a moment, Sanyuan City had already undergone a tremendous transformation. The city walls, which had been condensed with immortal light, suddenly turned into ordinary earth; other pavilions, terraces, and buildings all transformed into wood and bricks, exuding a faint, old, and decaying aura.

It was now precisely an ancient county town. Even the clothing and appearance of the pedestrians walking within had changed. Yet, neither ordinary people nor cultivators realized the changes happening to themselves or their surroundings. Everything, in their eyes, seemed as if it had always been that way.

"Tsk, the time is ripe, the curtain is drawn. This time, the Heavenly Injury Demonic Star Daoist Rite is complete; there can be no more mishaps."

"Those thirty-six immortal peaks perfectly align with the Heavenly Stems Dao Mechanism!"

A voice from the ethereal depths quietly resonated, carrying a hint of hope.
