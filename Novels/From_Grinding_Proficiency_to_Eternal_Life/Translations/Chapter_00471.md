# Chapter 471: Treading the Ritual, Invoking the Gang and Sha

Aside from the Word of Lin, this was the greatest harvest.

As for the Word of Lin...

Xu Yunfan glanced at his clone. The memories regarding the Word of Lin had been deliberately erased by him.

The essence of this sword manual lay in Sword Intent!

The manual's opening stated: "A swordsman of the myriad chariots seeks nothing from the outside; only the heart and will matter, and the sword embryo will gestate on its own. Without spiritual qi, one's heart cannot be obstructed; without primordial qi, one's will cannot be broken. Using the spirit to command the sword, using the will to temper the blade, one self-transforms into infinite methods, one self-evolves into myriad phenomena."

This was the fundamental reason Xu Yunfan had chosen it as his clone's cultivation method.

It did not depend on whether the surrounding spiritual qi of heaven and earth was abundant.

Although the Suspended Sky Prefecture of the Divine Martial Realm was filled with the qi of the metal element, the Heaven and Earth Qi or Stellar Qi that cultivators usually absorbed and refined was thin to the point of being nearly non-existent.

If his clone cultivated a conventional manual, it would be impossible to make any progress here.

But the Myriad Chariots Sword Manual was different. It cultivated the mind, spirit, will, and the very essence of the sharp sword intent itself!

Everything was ready.

Xu Yunfan's main body stood still on the ground, while his avatar was swept away by his great hand and thrown to the edge of a mortal city in the Divine Martial Realm to fend for itself and grow.

As for him, he would attract the firepower.

He slowly rose until he was hovering in mid-air, facing the Nine Heavens.

Next, he would invoke the legendary Emperor Star's Gang!

As long as that True Lord Qingyuan wanted the most perfect fruit, he would definitely spend great effort to obtain the Purple Micro Heavenly Gang of the Big Dipper and inject it into the Divine Martial Realm.

His expression solemn, Xu Yunfan formed an incredibly ancient and profound hand seal, his mouth emitting a low and clear chant. Every syllable seemed to cause the void to vibrate.

This was the supreme ritual recorded in the *True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra* for guiding the highest-grade stellar Gang and Sha!

As the chanting began, Xu Yunfan's main body held his palm upward, and an object slowly materialized.

It was a pigeon-egg-sized, translucent stone, inside which countless stellar fragments seemed to be rotating.

"Zhou Tian Guiding Star Sand"!

The moment this object appeared, the sharp metal qi filling the surroundings seemed to be devoured and tamed by it, becoming much gentler.

He had scavenged this from a loose cultivator inside Cold Crow Pass. Ever since he left the pass to wander around, that fellow had come charging straight at him with a fixed gaze.

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't let him go easily.

After beating him until he cried for his father and called for his mother, the fellow offered this item.

Looking at it now, it was clear that his karma had been manipulated, his mind clouded, and his perception altered, which led to this.

He had delivered it with his own eyes.

Xu Yunfan suddenly threw the Guiding Star Sand into the air and roared, "Fix the Star Pivot!"

The Guiding Star Sand abruptly stopped a hundred zhang above the avatar's head, emitting circles of gentle yet incredibly firm starlight ripples. These rapidly spread out, forming a massive starlight force field with a radius of ten li.

This force field quickly pushed away the inherent sharp metal qi of Suspended Sky Prefecture, creating a relatively "clean" area for guidance.

Xu Yunfan's slightly closed eyes opened within the starlight ripples. The Martial Dao Heavenly Eye on his forehead now glared wide open, its gaze sharp as lightning.

His ten fingers rapidly changed forms, and golden runes formed from pure True Martial Subduing Demon Power were continuously打入 the void.

These runes were not fixed; they constantly deconstructed and reassembled with the avatar's movements, like countless tiny stars arranging and evolving, constructing an incredibly complex three-dimensional formation diagram.

The True Form Diagram of the Big Dipper's Nine Stars!

The main position corresponded precisely to the supreme Purple Micro Emperor Star in the center of the heavens!

Damn it. If it weren't for my Attribute Panel, which allows me to master all the techniques of each stage as soon as the realm is completed, I would have had to study this ritual for years before I could perform it.

Xu Yunfan cursed inwardly. Just this current effort had already consumed nearly a third of his body's magical power.

Simultaneously, Xu Yunfan's expression remained solemn as he flipped his hand and took out another object.

This object was actually a drop of dark red liquid, heavy as mercury.

"Battle Soul Blood Essence," taken from the depths of Cold Crow Pass, a fusion of the blood and bravery of all the soldiers who had died in battle throughout the generations!

This was an essential "sacrificial" offering to invoke the belligerent Emperor Star!

When the Heavenly Tribulation of Slaughter was stirred back then, Cold Crow Pass was a strategic point for military forces and a strange place, so the battles for it were incredibly fierce.

There was no shortage of this blood essence mixed with battle bravery.

"Condense the Gang and Sha, open the Heavenly Path!" Xu Yunfan shouted sharply, flicking a finger.

The drop of "Battle Soul Blood Essence" instantly turned into a streak of blood-colored light, accurately plunging into the main star position of the Purple Micro Big Dipper that was being constructed!

*Hum!*

The moment the blood color merged with the star chart, the massive three-dimensional star chart floating in the air suddenly burst forth with an indescribable, intense light!

It was not gold, but a deep, noble purple-gold that implicitly held the power to give life and death to all things!

An ancient, vast, majestic, and domineering aura of extreme coldness, as if it had pierced through the barrier of the Divine Martial Realm's round heaven and square earth, descended from the boundless, dark depths of the Nine Hells!

The mountains and earth of Suspended Sky Prefecture, as if cast from divine metal, emitted groans of unbearable strain under this aura!

The ritual had begun!

Xu Yunfan stood at the center of the purple-gold light, withstanding unimaginable pressure. His body seemed as if it would be crushed by this Emperor Star's Qi that had not yet truly descended. His skin cracked inch by inch, seeping golden blood, but was rapidly repaired by the runes around him.

His Magical Body was actually struggling to endure?

He let out a muffled groan, remaining silent. His fingers formed a profound hand seal, and his lips silently mouthed the true word 'Lin'.

In an instant, the qi mechanisms around his body suddenly stagnated, and his spiritual sense became as clear and transparent as ice crystals.

In the Lin Word State, Xu Yunfan's seven emotions and six desires completely faded away, his mind reaching the Supreme State of no sorrow or joy.

His soul seemed to be forcibly elevated, and his thinking speed increased exponentially. The howling Gang winds of metal, the trembling earth, and the falling star-destroying thunder and fire all became slow and clear in his perception.

Every detail was broken down into the most basic fragments of information and recombined under reasoning that transcended reason.

This was the confidence that allowed him to face the Purple Micro Heavenly Gang and forge it in one go.

Only in the absolute rationality of the Lin Word State could he precisely capture that trace of the Emperor Star's origin within this torrent of destruction.

To condense the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Sha.

His magical power pushed to its limit, Xu Yunfan slowly unfolded his Dao Foundation. Behind him, a vague yet incredibly majestic Dharma Form with three heads and six arms, clad in black armor and stepping on a turtle and snake, faintly appeared!

This Dharma Form held a Subduing Demon Divine Sword formed from true energy, existing between reality and illusion, its tip pointing straight at the source from which the purple-gold light descended!

The other hands held various refined treasures. The Black Nether Heavy Halberd spat out Nether Sha Qi, and the space wherever its tip passed twisted.

The Azure Chain Sword was like a swimming dragon or a startled swan. As its light divided, the chains clanged.

The Blazing Fire Flying Wheel spun like the sun, its scorching flames burning the eight desolations.

The Black Ice Sword's glint was chilling, and wherever it passed, frost froze for a thousand li.

These four treasures and the main hand's Subduing Demon Sword reflected each other. Under the illumination of the Purple Micro Star Power, they erupted with divine might that suppressed this region's starlight!

"All demons submit, the True Martial suppresses the world! The Grand Supreme Star Flow, the Purple Micro Commands the Poles!"

The grand voice, pulled by the main body and the Dharma Form, completely merged at this moment, shaking the very clouds!
