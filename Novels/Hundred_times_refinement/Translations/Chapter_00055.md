## Chapter 5: Xisu Dan (Purifying the Marrow Pill)

Lin Xuan's face remained expressionless, but his hands were clenched tightly, his fingernails digging into his palms, and his lips were bitten. This state didn't last long; after a few minutes, Lin Xuan took a deep breath, sat back down, and continued his efforts.

The next morning, the sun rose over the Flying Cloud Palace, the most important building in the Drifting Cloud Valley. On the first day of every month, disciples in the Ling Dong period gathered here to receive the necessary pills for their cultivation. Despite having only slept for less than three hours, Lin Xuan arrived on time. The spacious hall was already filled with over a hundred disciples, all of whom were more skilled than Lin Xuan. His arrival sparked discussions and cold remarks.

"Look at that guy, a mortal without a spiritual root, still trying to cultivate to become an immortal," someone sneered.

"Humph, he doesn't even look that good. It's a waste of pills to keep him in the sect," another disciple said.

"Who wouldn't know that? He's been cultivating for three years and is still stuck in the first layer of the Ling Dong period. It's laughable," a third disciple chimed in.

Lin Xuan ignored the jeers, his expression unchanged, as if he were listening to the barking of mad dogs. He quietly took his place at the back of the group.

The sound of an ancient bell echoed through the hall, and the disciples stopped their discussions, lining up. An old man, accompanied by several young attendants, entered the hall. Each attendant carried a tray covered with a red cloth, emitting a fragrance that refreshed the mind.

"Ma Shishu!" the disciples greeted, bowing.

The old man, Ma Shishu, nodded slightly, his expression haughty. Despite his relatively low cultivation, being only at the Foundation Establishment stage, he was in charge of the sect's pharmacy, giving him significant authority.

In the world of cultivation, besides talent and effort, pills were indispensable. They could significantly accelerate one's progress, serving as a shortcut. However, the materials needed to refine these pills were rare and precious, so the sect could only provide a limited number to its disciples.

According to the rules, disciples in the Ling Dong period could receive two Xisu Dan (Purifying the Marrow Pill) each month. These pills were designed to purify the body, dispel impurities, and stimulate the production of a small amount of spiritual energy. The effectiveness varied depending on the individual's talent.

The ceremony began, and the disciples lined up to receive their pills. When it was Lin Xuan's turn, Ma Shishu looked at him with disdain, took two pills from the tray, and tossed them to Lin Xuan.

"Thank you, Shishu," Lin Xuan said, but his eyes twitched as he caught the pills. They were waste pills, not the real Xisu Dan.

In the world of cultivation, alchemy was a complex art that required not just rare materials but also precise techniques, including the control of the three true fires, the timing of opening the furnace, and the material of the cauldron. Even experienced alchemists could fail, turning precious materials into useless waste.

Waste pills contained excessive impurities and were harmful if ingested. Lin Xuan realized that Ma Shishu had intentionally given him waste pills, a clear act of disdain.

"Shishu, you've made a mistake. These waste pills are not fit for consumption," Lin Xuan pointed out.

"What's wrong with them? Your talent is so poor that even good pills would be wasted on you. Waste pills might be just right for you," Ma Shishu sneered. "I'll be generous; I'll give you a few more bottles."

Ma Shishu tossed two more bottles to Lin Xuan, saying, "You're getting a special treatment. Two bottles, that's more than anyone else gets."

Lin Xuan's expression didn't change, and he bowed. "Thank you, Shishu."

Ma Shishu was taken aback by Lin Xuan's reaction. He had expected Lin Xuan to be furious and make a scene, giving him an excuse to expel Lin Xuan from the sect. However, Lin Xuan remained calm, accepting the waste pills without complaint.

Lin Xuan understood that Ma Shishu had a motive for his actions, likely to humiliate or expel him. By remaining calm and accepting the waste pills, Lin Xuan avoided falling into Ma Shishu's trap, leaving the latter frustrated and speechless.
