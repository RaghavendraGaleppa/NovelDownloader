Chapter 1: The Desolate Ancient Continent

On the vast and desolate ancient continent, the strong preyed upon the weak. Martial prowess was the only law of survival. Here, power was everything; without it, one was no different from an ant, easily crushed under the feet of the powerful.

In a remote corner of the continent lay the Azure Dragon Empire. Within the empire was a small city named Linhai City. In the northern part of the city stood the Ye Clan, one of the three great clans of the city.

The Ye Clan's training grounds.

The morning sun cast its golden rays upon the stone platform. A group of young disciples, all clad in training attire, were gathered around, their eyes fixed intently on the center of the platform.

"Next, Ye Xuan!"

A cold, indifferent voice rang out. The speaker was a middle-aged man with a stern expression, the head of the outer court disciples, Elder Zhang.

As the name was called, a slender figure slowly walked onto the platform. The youth had sharp eyebrows and star-like eyes, but his face was pale, and his aura was weak. He was Ye Xuan, the former genius of the Ye Clan.

"Go on, show us what you've got. Don't tell me you're still stuck at the third level of the Martial Apprentice Realm?" A mocking voice came from the crowd.

Ye Xuan ignored the taunts. He took a deep breath, gathered his strength, and threw a punch at the stone pillar in front of him.

"Bang!"

A dull sound echoed. The stone pillar trembled slightly, but the pattern on it remained unchanged.

"Ye Xuan, Martial Apprentice Realm, third level. Result: Unqualified." Elder Zhang announced coldly.

The words fell, and the surrounding disciples immediately erupted in laughter.

"Hahaha, he's still at the third level! He's been stuck there for a whole year!"

"Truly a waste of a good name. The former genius has fallen."

"His fiancée, Murong Bing, is already at the eighth level of the Martial Apprentice Realm. She's about to enter the inner court. How can he still be so useless?"

The sarcastic remarks were like sharp daggers, piercing Ye Xuan's heart. However, he remained silent, his fists clenched so tightly that his knuckles turned white.

He was not a native of this world. A year ago, he was a top agent from the 21st century, but due to a mission accident, his soul穿越 (chuānyuè) to this world. However, the original owner of this body was also a genius, but due to a failed attempt at breaking through to the Martial Apprentice Realm, his meridians were damaged, and his cultivation base plummeted. He was then despised and bullied by everyone, eventually leading to his death from depression.

After Ye Xuan took over this body, he discovered that the original owner's damaged meridians were almost impossible to repair. However, he also found that there was a mysterious ancient pagoda in his soul sea. This ancient pagoda was extremely ancient, with nine floors, but it was currently in a sealed state. Only the first floor was slightly active, and it could absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to refine into a pure energy that could repair his meridians.

Over the past year, Ye Xuan had been secretly repairing his meridians using this method. Although the progress was slow, it was effective. Now, his meridians were almost fully repaired, but he deliberately kept a low profile, hiding his true strength, waiting for the right moment to reveal his true abilities.

"Ye Xuan, are you done yet? If you're done, get off the stage! Don't waste everyone's time!" Elder Zhang said impatiently.

Ye Xuan withdrew his fist, turned around, and walked off the platform without looking back.

"Brother Xuan, don't be discouraged. You'll definitely be able to catch up!" A warm voice came from the side. It was his good friend, Ye Feng.

Ye Xuan nodded slightly, but before he could speak, a cold and arrogant voice interrupted them.

"Ye Xuan, you're still not giving up? With your crippled meridians, you'll never be able to enter the Martial Apprentice Realm. You'd better listen to me and pack your things and leave the clan. Don't come to the training ground to embarrass yourself anymore."

The speaker was Ye Haoyu, the current number one genius of the Ye Clan. He was tall and handsome, with a noble aura. He was also the fiancé of Murong Bing, the woman who was once Ye Xuan's fiancée.

"Ye Haoyu, what do you mean by this? Brother Xuan is also a member of the Ye Clan!" Ye Feng said angrily.

"Member? Hmph, a废物 (fèichù) who can't even pass the assessment is a disgrace to the clan. I'm doing this for the good of the clan." Ye Haoyu sneered.

"You..." Ye Feng was so angry that he couldn't speak.

Ye Xuan pulled Ye Feng back, looked at Ye Haoyu calmly, and said, "I'll leave if I want. It's not up to you to decide. As for the assessment, I'll pass it when I want to. Also, Murong Bing is no longer my fiancée. You can have her. Don't use her to lecture me."

After saying that, Ye Xuan turned and left, leaving a stunned crowd and a face full of disbelief on Ye Haoyu's face.

"Damn it! Ye Xuan, you're courting death!" Ye Haoyu roared, his aura suddenly rising, and he was about to attack.

"Stop it! This is the training ground, not a place for you to fight!" Elder Zhang stepped forward and stopped him.

Ye Haoyu glared at Ye Xuan's retreating figure, his eyes filled with killing intent. "Ye Xuan, just you wait. At the clan competition in three days, I'll make you pay the price for your arrogance!"

Ye Xuan walked back to his room, closed the door, and sat cross-legged on the bed. He immediately felt the mysterious ancient pagoda in his soul sea. The pagoda was only the size of a palm, exuding an ancient and mysterious aura. At this moment, the first floor of the1. Remove all advertisements and non-story metadata. 2.

At this moment, the first floor of the pagoda was faintly glowing, and a pure energy was slowly flowing out, nourishing his meridians. He knew that the moment to reveal his true strength was approaching. The clan competition in three days would be the stage for his comeback.
