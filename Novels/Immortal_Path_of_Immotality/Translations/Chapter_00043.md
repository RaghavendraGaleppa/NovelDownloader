# Chapter 43: United We Stand

When Master Nan activated the yellow talisman, erecting a protective barrier, all attackers immediately shifted their focus to his younger sister.

The blue-skirted girl had never trained in martial arts. As an early-stage Qi Refining cultivator, her only technique was a basic fireball spell, and her spiritual energy was already nearly depleted from previous skirmishes.

Facing simultaneous attacks from over a dozen Xiantian experts, her face paled in terror. She desperately channeled her remaining spiritual energy, hurling fireball after fireball in a futile attempt to block the incoming assaults. Meanwhile, wind blades shot from the dense forest increased dramatically, each one neutralizing her spells one by one.

Even with Master Nan assisting her defense, several attacks slipped through. A fist struck her chest while a palm slammed into her abdomen, sending her flying backward with a spray of blood until she nearly tumbled into the frigid pond.

Seeing his sister fall, Master Nan instantly teleported to her side and transferred his protective talisman onto her body.

However, the two Xiantian experts who had delivered the fatal blows were clearly seasoned veterans with deadly precision—one strike had shattered her heart meridian, the other destroyed her dantian.

The blue-skirted girl's breathing grew faint as death approached. With great effort, she shook her head at her brother, attempting to remove the talisman and urge him to flee. But Master Nan, overwhelmed by grief, could only recall their years of wandering together since adulthood—seeking opportunities, evading pursuers, finally finding refuge as honored guests in Prince Chu's residence...

"ARRGHH!"

With an anguished roar, Master Nan gently laid his dying sister within the yellow protective barrier. Gripping his golden spear, he charged back into battle with renewed fury.

On the ground, the blue-skirted girl could no longer speak. Pale as death with her cultivation ruined and life fading, she weakly reached toward her brother before her arm finally fell limp.

...

None of the battling Xiantian experts paid any attention to this tragic scene. After decades in the martial world, who among them hadn't experienced their own heartbreaks? Some had suffered even greater losses than Master Nan!

The pursuit of opportunity required carving a bloody path through all opposition. Death was simply an accepted risk on this path.

Now with bloodshot eyes, Master Nan fought with reckless abandon, trading injury for injury. Despite severe wounds, his golden spear whirled like a tempest. Even with Lin Shan's intermittent wind blade attacks from the forest, several Xiantian experts fell to the enraged cultivator's spear.

The remaining combatants, now beyond retreat, matched his ferocity in a deadly exchange of blows.

Then—Lin Shan seized his chance.

A precisely timed wind blade flashed through the chaos, severing Master Nan's left arm at the shoulder!

The surrounding Xiantian experts, seeing this opening, pounced like wolves upon the wounded cultivator.

With a pained cry, Master Nan tore the green talisman from his waist wound and slapped it onto his severed arm. The makeshift solution worked—the gushing blood instantly stopped.

"Seriously?" Lin Shan muttered incredulously from his hiding place. This was his first time seeing talismans reused like bandages.

As a metal-attributed mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator, Master Nan only seemed proficient in golden spear techniques and explosive blade projections. While lacking ranged attacks beyond spear throws, his stockpile of talismans kept him stubbornly alive.

Lin Shan remained concealed—a cornered beast was most dangerous, and emerging now risked taking a spear to the chest.

...

Master Nan was now a horrific sight—missing an arm, with a gaping waist wound and countless other injuries. After another fierce exchange, he suddenly disengaged and retreated to the pondside where his sister's lifeless body lay.

Without words or ceremony, he tore the yellow protective talisman from her corpse and activated it upon himself, the familiar golden barrier shimmering back to life.

"What the hell?!"

Lin Shan and the eight remaining Xiantian experts cursed in unison. How many times could this damn talisman be reused?

Master Nan coldly scanned the forest where Lin Shan hid, then abruptly turned and fled toward the opposite tree line.

He wasn't foolish—earlier grief had driven him to fight recklessly, but losing an arm and depleting his spiritual energy had restored his reason. As the saying went: "With life preserved, firewood can always be gathered." A sentiment any seasoned martial artist understood.

With an enemy cultivator ambushing from the woods, continuing the fight meant certain death once his energy ran dry. Retrieving the defensive talisman and breaking through was his only option.

The remaining Xiantian experts hesitated, watching his retreat. Partly from lingering fear, partly because their original goal—the Xiantian Vermilion Fruit—seemed achievable now that Master Nan was fleeing.

Then a sinister voice cut through the silence: "You've all killed Master Nan's beloved sister. If he escapes back to Prince Chu's palace, none of you will survive his vengeance!"

Lin Shan immediately recognized Jiang Hu's voice—the cunning old fox had perfectly voiced his own thoughts.

The eight Xiantian experts exchanged grim looks before charging in pursuit.

Just as Master Nan reached the tree line, a barrage of black arrows rained down. From behind every tree and bush emerged over a hundred black-clad assassins, each wielding crossbows—Jiang Hu's Nightingale assassins, positioned in advance.

The arrows pinged harmlessly against the yellow barrier, creating ripples across its surface.

Lin Shan joined the assault, knowing the talisman's protection couldn't last forever under sustained attack. "The barrier won't hold! Everyone attack together!" he shouted, unleashing a relentless stream of wind blades while carefully conserving enough spiritual energy for emergencies.

The remaining Xiantian experts, seeing the hidden immortal's renewed assault, rallied their forces. Soon warriors from various factions emerged, joining the hail of arrows and blades. Xiantian experts added their own projectile attacks to the onslaught.

Master Nan zigzagged desperately, but each time he neared the forest's safety, hidden wind blades forced him back. After enduring ten breaths of continuous bombardment, the golden barrier finally shattered under the collective assault.

Even ants could kill an elephant when they swarmed in sufficient numbers—and talismans were no exception, especially with Lin Shan's cultivator-level attacks bolstering the assault.

With the barrier gone, the attackers surged forward eagerly. Killing an immortal cultivator would become legendary in the martial world, a story to boast about for lifetimes. For martial artists, sometimes reputation outweighed profit itself.

And with Master Nan now defenseless and faltering, this was the moment to strike.

"KILL!"

The human tide crashed forward. Even seven or eight previously hidden Xiantian experts emerged from concealment to join the final assault.

...

Master Nan laughed bitterly as he whirled his golden spear in desperate arcs, corpses piling around him until blood flowed in rivulets.

But exhaustion finally claimed him.

The final blow came from none other than Jiang Hu—the ultimate opportunist striking the killing stroke.
