# Chapter 39: A Beauty's Heart Flutters!  

"Thank you, Senior Brother Lin." The young man didn't actually want to come and receive these so-called worthless talismans, but he had no choice. Due to Lin Yun's free talisman campaign, those in the Yellow Maple Valley who hadn't claimed theirs or helped spread the word were becoming increasingly rare. These individuals had suddenly become hot commodities, drawing everyone's attention.  

The young man surnamed Li had refused many times, but there was no way around it. Every single person had come to invite him, and if he didn't show up, it would undoubtedly raise suspicions.  

Though his status was lofty and he looked down on these lower-realm worms, he had just undergone a body possession and needed to remain cautious and low-key. Drawing attention was the last thing he wanted.  

Unable to refuse any longer, he reluctantly came and befriended Lin Yun.  

If he didn't show up, others would surely keep disturbing his cultivation. It was better to just take the talisman and be done with it, so he could quietly continue his training in peace.  

Looking at the guy before him, he truly thought Lin Yun was an idiot. Wouldn’t it be better to keep these thousand-plus high-grade primary talismans for himself? Why give them away for free?  

What kind of logic was that? Did hearing others express gratitude for free stuff really feel that good?  

Truly a lowly race—weak in innate talent, so they had to huddle together for warmth.  

Lin Yun, on the other hand, could only say that giving things away for free did pain him, but the benefits he could extract from these people—now that was truly satisfying!  

"You're too kind! Junior Brother, with your talent, your future is bound to be bright," Lin Yun said with a smile.  

"Thank you for the praise, Senior Brother." The young man's smile was stiff, clearly unaccustomed to smiling.  

After taking the talisman, he was immediately surrounded by ten people. He casually handed the talisman to one of them and walked away without another word.  

**[Ding! Congratulations, host, for obtaining a top-tier defensive artifact—Lotus Leaf Armor.]**  
**[Ding! Congratulations, host, for obtaining Silver Essence.]**  

A short while later, all the talismans on Lin Yun's stall were gone.  

"Everyone, today's batch of talismans has been distributed. I'll be back here tomorrow," Lin Yun announced to the crowd.  

Of course, he still had more talismans left, but producing over a thousand high-grade primary talismans wasn't something he could do overnight. He needed time to rest and cultivate, and currently, he only had a few hundred on hand.  

Take it slow—let the news spread further, attracting even more people.  

"Junior Brother Lin!" Just as Lin Yun was about to leave, Nie Ying flew up from behind, landing gracefully beside him.  

---

"Hey—look! Isn’t that Senior Sister Nie Ying?" The sight of the handsome young man and the beautiful woman standing together in the sky immediately drew the attention of passersby, who stopped to watch from a distance.  

"Isn’t that Senior Brother Lin?"  

"Why are the two of them standing so close? I heard Senior Brother Lin was very close to Chen Qiaoqian from the Chen family."  

The passing Qi Refinement disciples gazed curiously from afar.  

"Damn it! I’m so jealous of Senior Brother Lin! Not only is he the most handsome man in Yellow Maple Valley, but he’s also the top talisman-making genius. And now, even the most beautiful woman in the valley, Senior Sister Nie Ying, has taken a liking to him?"  

"Why does he get all the good things?"  

"Nonsense! Since when was Senior Sister Nie the most beautiful? The title belongs to Junior Sister Xuan'er!"  

"I disagree. It should be Senior Sister Chen. Her ability to switch between coldness and warmth is what truly captivates men."  

The onlookers began debating who the most beautiful woman in Yellow Maple Valley was.  

But beauty is subjective—different strokes for different folks.  

Just like in Lin Yun’s previous life, when people online debated which female celebrity was the most beautiful, opinions often centered around a few famous names, but there were always those with unique tastes.  

However, purely in terms of facial features, Nie Ying did surpass both Qiaoqian and Dong Xuan'er.  

"Senior Sister Nie?" Lin Yun teased. "Even if you want a free talisman, you’ll need to bring ten people."  

"Ah?" Nie Ying was taken aback. She hadn’t expected Lin Yun’s first reaction to be about the talismans, and her heart sank slightly.  

Hearing that she, too, had to follow the rules made her even more disappointed.  

So, in this junior brother’s eyes, she was no different from any other ordinary disciple in Yellow Maple Valley?  

But that made sense. After all, she’d heard that this junior brother was very close to the eldest daughter of the Chen family, one of the three great clans of Yellow Maple Valley.  

"Haha—Senior Sister Nie, I was just joking. A beauty like you is naturally exceptional." Lin Yun laughed and handed her a high-grade fire-attribute talisman.  

"Ah—" Nie Ying was pleasantly surprised. She looked at Lin Yun hopefully. "Really? Junior Brother Lin, won’t this violate your principles?"  

---

"Haha—rules are for ordinary people. Someone as stunning as you, Senior Sister, is far from ordinary." Lin Yun smiled, his smooth flirting rolling off his tongue effortlessly.  

"Thank you, Junior Brother. I’ll accept it gladly." Nie Ying happily took the talisman.  

**[Ding! Host has gifted friend Nie Ying a high-grade primary Fire Snake Talisman, triggering "Cast thy bread upon the waters."]**  
**[Ding! Congratulations, host, for obtaining a mid-grade intermediate talisman: Fire Phoenix Talisman.]**  
**[Treasure Description: Fire-attribute mid-grade intermediate talisman.]**  
**[Ding! Nie Ying’s favorability +30. Current favorability: 60 (Heart Aflutter)]**  
**[Ding! Nie Ying’s favorability has reached 60. Host can draw one reward from friend Nie Ying.]**  
**[Ding! Congratulations, host, for obtaining: Flaming Essence Stone.]**  

"A mid-grade intermediate talisman? Huge win!"  

Looking at Nie Ying, who was overjoyed at receiving a talisman from him alone, Lin Yun inwardly scoffed, "Tsk, women!"  

"They always want you to stick to your principles—except when it comes to them, where they expect special treatment and favoritism."  

"Got it under control." Lin Yun’s gaze briefly swept over Nie Ying. "Well, another fish in the pond."  

"Luckily, Qiaoqian is preparing for Foundation Establishment, and Dong Xuan'er is under Hong Fu’s house arrest. The pond is safe for now."  

"But until I reach Foundation Establishment, I should keep my distance. Getting too close now would be risky."  

"Raising too many 'fish' without sufficient strength might lead to a tragic end, just like that guy Cheng."  

"Junior Brother Lin, would you like to take a walk with me?" Nie Ying lowered her head, blushing slightly. As someone usually aloof, this was the first time she’d ever invited a man—one she was fond of, no less.  

"No time. I’m very busy these days." Lin Yun shook his head without hesitation. "Senior Sister Nie, is there anything else important?"  

"If not, I need to return to my cultivation. I still have talismans to make."  

**Rule of Raising Fish:** *What you can’t have, you always want.*  

**Never let a woman get you too easily!**  

Besides, he genuinely had no free time right now.  

"Ah?!" Nie Ying was stunned, staring blankly at Lin Yun. *"Are you serious? Are you kidding me? Are you out of your mind?"*  

"You’re rejecting me? Do you have any idea no man has ever refused me before?"  

*"Hmph—man, you’ve successfully caught my attention!"*  

"Nothing else." Nie Ying, thoroughly embarrassed by the rejection, wished she could vanish into thin air.  

---

"Then farewell, Senior Sister. I’ll take my leave." Without another word, Lin Yun turned and walked away.  

"Ah? He really left?!"  

"What a blockhead!"  

"Did you really think I just wanted to take a walk?"  

"Couldn’t you tell such an obvious hint?"  

Nie Ying was fuming.  

"But this only makes you more intriguing, Junior Brother. Such innocence is rare in the cultivation world. Let your senior sister protect you properly!"  

"Only I am the right one for you."  

Nie Ying assumed Lin Yun was too naive to pick up on her hints, which only made her desire him more.  

**Rule of Raising Fish:** *The most skilled hunters often appear as prey.*  

**[Ding! Nie Ying’s favorability +10. Current favorability: 70 (Love Takes Root.)]**  

Watching Lin Yun’s retreating figure, Nie Ying opened her delicate hand, revealing the fire-attribute talisman he’d given her. She carefully placed it inside a precious jade box.  

"Ah? That’s it?"  

The onlookers were disappointed.  

A short, stout disciple with a strange wooden cane on his back grumbled, "Senior Brother Lin is so clueless! If Senior Sister Nie approached me, I’d stick to her all day. Even if she wanted the stars, I’d pluck them for her!"  

"That’s exactly why she wouldn’t even glance at you, Wang Laoba!"  

"Hahaha—"  

Amidst the laughter, the crowd dispersed.  

In the dull and monotonous world of cultivation, a bit of gossip was a welcome distraction from the solitude of training.  

Meanwhile, Lin Yun returned to his residence.  

He needed to organize his plans and schedule.  

As the saying goes: *"He who fails to plan, plans to fail."*  

Moreover, some of his recent gains had exceeded his expectations, requiring him to adjust his future cultivation path accordingly.  

"Before that, let’s tally my recent harvests."  

"System, open my personal panel."
