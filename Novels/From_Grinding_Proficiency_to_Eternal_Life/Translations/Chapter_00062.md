# Chapter 62: Gathering of the Many

The backyard?

Xu Yunfan looked at the vermilion-painted gate not far away.

He gazed deeply at it and was about to turn away when his steps suddenly halted.

不知何时，一名身材极其伟岸的灰衣僧人站在了墙角，离他不过十余米距离。粗布袈裟下的肌肉如地龙翻涌，呼吸间竟能清晰看到两条白练般的热雾。然而，他眉眼间却是一派慈悲相，含笑看着他。

What a tall monk! He must be at least two and a half meters tall!

Standing there, he looked exactly like a Vajra Arhat.

"Monk Puwu at your service. Benefactor, you have been wandering around the temple for a whole day. May I ask what you are looking for?"

"I have long heard of the Temple of Thousand Buddhas. Naturally, I came today to see every nook and cranny to my heart's content."

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan sized up the monk.

His skin was tough as leather, his tendons coiled like dragons, and his muscles bulged like mountains.

His skin tempering was perfected; he was at least a First-Rank Martial Master. Though his veins were prominent, they lacked the explosive tension of perfected muscle tempering, meaning he hadn't quite reached the peak of that stage.

It was a mystery how he had grown to such a height and physique; it was truly astonishing. Relying solely on his innate, extraordinary body, he could likely fight a Second-Rank Martial Master to a standstill.

Such a figure usually wouldn't show himself, lest he frighten the pilgrims and tourists.

Puwu suddenly understood. He smiled and said, "Benefactor, please do not go any further. The area behind this is the living quarters for the monks of this temple."

Xu Yunfan nodded. "Thank you for informing me, Master."

He didn't linger any longer and turned to leave.

Puwu watched Xu Yunfan's retreating back until it completely disappeared from his sight before slowly turning around. He walked forward and pushed open the vermilion gate, entering the courtyard.

After eating the unique vegetarian meal of the Temple of Thousand Buddhas, Xu Yunfan wiped his mouth and quickly left the temple.

Since there was nothing in the front courtyard, he naturally needed to wait for nightfall to take action.

In the woods not far from the Temple of Thousand Buddhas, with nothing else to do, Xu Yunfan continuously pulled and moved the Extreme Daoist's remains, all the while trying to conceal his figure.

*You continuously hide your form, avoiding a rabbit's alertness and approaching silently. Your Hunting proficiency has increased.*

*Tap.*

Xu Yunfan shot out from behind a tree and stepped down firmly on the wild rabbit that was about to flee. Seeing the notification of increased Hunting proficiency appear in his vision, a smile crept onto his face.

Then, he loosened his foot, and the rabbit scurried out from under him again. Xu Yunfan repeated the process, moving his figure once more, hiding behind a tree, and approaching silently.

Since mastering the basics of Hunting, though he had used it often, he had yet to reach the level of minor completion.

He was still short by at least over a hundred points of proficiency.

With time on his hands and powerful warrior monks inside the Temple of Thousand Buddhas, it wasn't suitable to practice the Cloak Hammer Technique, which would make too much noise. Practicing his Hunting skill was a good alternative.

Late into the night, Xu Yunfan looked up at the bright moon and sparse stars. Just as he was about to continue up the mountain, his gaze shifted slightly to the top of a tree not far away.

He quickly strapped the Extreme Daoist's remains to his body. The membranes of his feet, taut like bowstrings, exerted force as a whole, making him glide across the ground. There was no sound of crushing fallen leaves or the whistling of clothes. The seven hundred and twenty bones in his body, regulated by his Qi and Blood, transformed into a precise mechanism.

Three silhouettes were visible among the branches of an ancient cypress tree fifteen zhang away, rising and falling with the canopy.

"Is the divine weapon really nearby?"

A slightly sharp voice filled with doubt rang out.

"Who knows? There are all sorts of rumors in Beiye City now. Some say it's in the Eight Hundred Li Wasteland of Ice, some say it's inside the Temple of Thousand Buddhas, and others say it's on an unnamed cliff. Who the hell knows?"

A bearded, burly man sat cross-legged on a branch as thick as a bowl's mouth. The muscles of his thighs had箍ed the tree trunk, leaving ring-shaped indentations. His voice was somewhat coarse and very gloomy.

"The bastards selling information in Beiye City have hearts as black as coal. I bet they'd even mix hallucinogens into the temple's incense ash."

"We've been searching for days and haven't even found a single hair. What a waste of time."

The scar-faced man hanging upside down below suddenly opened his eyes, his steady voice sounding. "Alright, alright. Though there are many warrior monks in the Temple of Thousand Buddhas, we aren't the only ones tonight. I'm afraid many others have the same idea as us."

After a moment of silence, the sharp voice expressed some concern. "The strength masters of the Temple of Thousand Buddhas are famous throughout Qingzhou. I'm afraid they won't be easy to deal with."

"To hell with that! We don't have to be the first to act. We can just fish in troubled waters. Besides..." The bearded man casually grabbed the tree trunk next to him. With the force of his knuckles, the trunk crumbled and fell like flour.

"I've been wanting to test those bald donkeys. I want to see just how tough those strength masters, tempered by the temple's secret medicines, really are."

After the discussion, the three quickly made their decision. They unleashed their movement techniques and quickly headed towards the Temple of Thousand Buddhas.

The scar-faced man suddenly shot up, his toes leaving spiderweb-like cracks on the tree trunk.

The three turned into grey shadows and raced towards the temple. The friction of their coarse cloth clothes against the air actually produced a hissing sound like a snake's tongue.

Divine weapon again.

Watching the three retreating figures, the now-visible Xu Yunfan was speechless. Three Martial Masters, at least at the peak of the First Rank, had appeared...

No matter how extraordinary the divine weapon is, it's impossible for it to be in the Temple of Thousand Buddhas. These martial artists must be crazy from their desire for it.

In the past, if these three First-Rank Martial Masters had appeared together in Beiye City, even the city's governor would have inquired about it. But now, with the news of the divine weapon spreading, experts from all directions have gathered.

However...

With these muddle-headed people leading the way, it will be much easier for me to find those Strength Master Bodhisattva statues. If Qin Bo wasn't lying, there is a high possibility they are in the backyard.

In the dead of night, Xu Yunfan moved unhurriedly to the west wall of the temple. The buildings here were continuous and undulating, making it easy to climb over.

Along the way, there were at least five groups of people with the same idea.

Everyone basically maintained a safe distance and didn't get too close to each other.

Occasionally, one could hear the curses of people who had been recognized.

"Song Qing! You killed my junior sister. This time, I will make you pay with your life!"

"Diao Yunjiang! You treacherous swine! Today that I've run into you, I'll make sure you regret it!"

"..."

Though they cursed loudly, they all tacitly avoided fighting, afraid of drawing the attention of the temple's monks.

West wall of the Temple of Thousand Buddhas.

Xu Yunfan, disguised with a mask, looked at the foot of the west wall. There were at least six or seven people dressed in black, standing close to the wall.

The group looked at each other, and then quickly came to a consensus.

Someone immediately spoke in a deliberately hoarse voice. "In that case, everyone shall go their own way."

Everyone agreed.

Xu Yunfan heard a hint of familiarity in that deliberately rough and hoarse voice. Upon closer inspection, he couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.

Su Shiyu?!

This woman, where did she learn her clumsy martial arts? She was skillfully throwing a grappling hook and climbing the high temple wall, using both hands and feet.

Though her movements were crude in their force application, they were nimble and efficient. It was clear she had practiced this move countless times to achieve such a result.

The others didn't hesitate either. Each displayed their unique skills, quickly climbing the wall and scattering in all directions.

Xu Yunfan looked up and couldn't help but sigh.

Inside the Temple of Thousand Buddhas, the number of people who had sneaked in was probably even greater than the monks themselves.

On the eaves, in the corners, at the mouths of the rafters, there was hardly any space left to stand.

Where did all these people come from?!
