# Chapter 58: Crafting Talismans (Please Keep Reading!)

The disciples lined up one by one before the Liu-named duty disciple, each handing over twelve spirit stones. The Liu disciple had clearly come prepared, continuously retrieving talisman brushes, ink, and paper from his storage pouch.

Standing in line, Chu Ning faintly overheard murmurs from those behind him:

"These talisman brushes and ink seem to be of very ordinary quality. I remember this grade would only cost eight spirit stones for the brush and one each for the ink and paper if bought from the sect."

"Senior Brother Liu went through the trouble of procuring these for us—earning one extra spirit stone is reasonable. Even if we bought them at the market, it'd cost at least ten stones. Besides, going to the market would waste our time, and we only have five days."

Hearing this, Chu Ning remained silent. He couldn't help but think of Zhuang Yunde and suddenly felt that the plump senior brother was actually quite decent. At the very least, if Zhuang Yunde wanted something from him, he would first ensure Chu Ning gained something in return.

Though these thoughts crossed his mind, Chu Ning handed over his spirit stones without hesitation when his turn came. Taking the talisman brush, ink, and paper, he turned and left the training ground immediately. Though his own storage pouch contained plenty of talisman paper, he saw no point in explaining.

As he left, his gaze swept over the others who had advanced alongside him. Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang had already departed. He noticed Lu Ming and Chen Jinhua now standing in line at the back. Only Jiang Dawei remained seated, his face twisted in indecision—until the moment Chu Ning stepped out, when he finally rose to join the queue.

Clearly, for most disciples, despite the steep cost of twelve spirit stones for this attempt, the temptation was too great to resist.

Chu Ning didn't linger. He hurried back to his quarters. The Spirit Plantation Hall hadn't yet assigned him new fields or living arrangements, but he set those thoughts aside for now.

Once inside, he immediately took out the talisman brush, ink, and paper from his storage pouch, then carefully studied the sheet detailing the method for crafting Wood Escape Talismans.

After fifteen minutes, he had committed the process to memory. Just as he was about to begin, he hesitated, then closed his eyes to practice his Soul Refinement Art instead. Crafting talismans required intense focus and steady concentration—qualities the Soul Refinement Art excelled at cultivating.

Another half-hour passed before Chu Ning opened his eyes again, a slight frown creasing his brow. Today's Soul Refinement session seemed less effective than his usual morning and evening practices. "Perhaps I'm too preoccupied with the talismans today," he mused dismissively.

His attention returned to the materials on the table. He mentally reviewed every detail of the talisman-crafting process, ensuring he had memorized every contour of the spiritual patterns perfectly.

Only then did he smooth a sheet of talisman paper on the table and uncork the ink. Immediately, a metallic tang laced with spiritual energy wafted up—unsurprising, as he'd heard talisman ink was typically mixed with demon beast blood.

He dipped the brush, channeled spiritual energy into it, and brought the tip to the paper. The energy flowed through the brush, guiding the ink as it began tracing the mystical patterns.

Yet scarcely had he begun when the energy at the brush's tip fluctuated uncontrollably. The paper burst into flames, crumbling to ash—his first attempt ending in failure.

Setting the brush down, Chu Ning closed his eyes, analyzing his mistake. The spiritual energy had destabilized during control, the slightest variance dooming the process. But discouragement never touched him. With his Talisman Source Spiritual Body, his innate talent far surpassed ordinary practitioners. Even this fleeting insight was a testament to that gift.

Drawing a deep breath, he laid out another sheet, dipped the brush, and began anew. The tip glided smoothly across the paper as he meticulously guided the energy through each curve of the pattern.

When the final stroke connected, completing the intricate design, a flicker of satisfaction arose—only for the paper to ignite instantly as he lifted the brush.

"Lost focus at the end," he muttered, recognizing the misstep. Without pause, he prepared another sheet. Energy surged into the brush, ink met paper, and his movements flowed seamlessly.

Now familiar with the pattern from previous attempts, his spiritual energy coiled like a serpent across the page, his consciousness wholly absorbed in the act. The mystical lines seemed etched into his mind, his hand moving with effortless precision.

In less time than before, the completed pattern materialized. Without hesitation, he lifted the brush—simultaneously, faint azure light pulsed across the paper before vanishing into its fibers. A thrum of spiritual power lingered as a finished talisman lay before him.

"Success! A Wood Escape Talisman!" Chu Ning's lips curved as his eyes gleamed. Though untested, the talisman's steady energy resonance—from experience—signaled superior quality.

A top-grade Wood Escape Talisman, achieved on just his third attempt.

"The Talisman Source Spiritual Body's talent is truly miraculous," he marveled inwardly. Picking up the talisman, he considered testing it immediately, then reconsidered—this wasn't the place.

He carried it to the Ink Bamboo fields instead. Standing at one edge, he channeled energy into the talisman and activated it.

Azure light enveloped him. In a flash, he reappeared thirty meters away.

"Mastered the crafting. Now to test the success rate." Chuckling, he returned to his quarters and resumed his work.

By the time he stopped nearly two hours later, exhaustion and exhilaration warred on his face. Before him lay a neat stack of flawless Wood Escape Talismans.
