## Chapter 63: Killing

The moon shone brightly in the sky, casting a silver glow over the landscape. Li Zhi Ming, unusually, did not retire to his room to sleep after soaking his feet. Instead, he donned a windbreaker and stepped out into the night air. Under the moonlight, his spirit seemed to be washed clean, and the tranquility was almost palpable. He strolled up the mountain slope, where the green bamboo stood tall and resilient, their leaves constantly falling and regrowing.

The mountain path was carpeted with a layer of fallen bamboo leaves, and the moonlight cast a silver sheen on them, creating a dappled effect. The sound of a large bamboo rat scurrying into the underbrush broke the silence as it fled at the sight of Li Zhi Ming. Standing on the mountain slope, Li Zhi Ming felt a sense of melancholy wash over him.

As he gazed up at the sky, the stars twinkled like diamonds against the dark canvas. The vast expanse seemed to hum with an energy all its own. He felt infinitesimally small yet connected to the universe. The mountains stretched out before him, a sea of green that seemed to slumber in the night, like black dragons lying in wait.

In this moment, Li Zhi Ming thought that perhaps living in such a valley wasn't a bad thing. His thoughts wandered from his past to the present, from his childhood in Dongxiang to his current status as a young healer at Qixuan Gate. He pondered the lives of those with green命格, those powerful figures who seemed to operate on a completely different plane of existence.

As he walked to the mountaintop, the chill in the air grew more pronounced. A misty veil shrouded the bamboo forest, and Li Zhi Ming wrapped his clothes tighter around him. He couldn't help but think about the vast differences in the world, how some people seemed to float above the fray while others were bound by their circumstances.

The thought process was fleeting yet seemed to stretch on forever. When Li Zhi Ming came back to himself, a considerable amount of time had passed. The cold seeped into his bones, and he shivered.

"Does growing up mean losing the ability to dream?" Li Zhi Ming mused with a wry smile, shaking his head. He turned to leave, but his gaze fell upon a figure on the cliffside.

The figure, clad in dark clothing, seemed to blend into the shadows. At first, Li Zhi Ming thought it was just his imagination, but his keen senses, honed from years of practice, allowed him to see the figure clearly even in the darkness. It was a person, clinging to the cliffside like a gecko, dressed in night attire.

"Another member of the Haisha Gang?" Li Zhi Ming's eyes narrowed as he stood on the cliff, his figure shrouded in shadows. He made no move to hide or escape.

The figure, Hu Yun, a renowned thief and assassin, had been tasked with infiltrating Qixuan Gate. He had been here before, and his employer had offered a handsome sum for his services. Hu Yun had confidence in his abilities, particularly his exceptional agility.

As he ascended the cliff, he spotted Li Zhi Ming standing among the bamboo. For a moment, Hu Yun was taken aback. He had not expected to encounter anyone, let alone a young man dressed in such an unusual outfit.

Hu Yun's expression darkened, and he charged towards Li Zhi Ming, a glint of steel in his hand. "You're looking for death, I suppose?" he snarled.

Li Zhi Ming didn't flinch. With a swift movement, he grasped Hu Yun's wrist, his fingers closing around it like a vice. "Dali Jin'gang Zhi!" he murmured, and Hu Yun recognized the technique.

The two engaged in a brief, intense struggle. Hu Yun tried to break free, but Li Zhi Ming's grip was unyielding. In a flash, Li Zhi Ming turned behind Hu Yun and plunged a blade into his neck. The assassin's eyes widened in shock, and then Li Zhi Ming's large, silver hand closed around his head.

The sound of crushing bone was followed by the lifeless body tumbling down the mountain. Li Zhi Ming wiped his hand clean with a handkerchief and discarded it, watching as it fluttered down to join the body.

"It's the fourth time this half-year," Li Zhi Ming remarked to himself, shaking his head. He turned to leave, feeling a sense of fatigue. "Time to go down the mountain and rest."
