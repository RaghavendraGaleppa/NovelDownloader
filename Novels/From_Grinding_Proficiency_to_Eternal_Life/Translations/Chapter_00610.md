Chapter 610: The Characteristics of the Primordial Sect

Sun Yue’s mountain-collapsing inverted hanging divine fist struck from the front, while Mo Qisha’s soundless and peerless annihilating god-killing stab came from behind.

One was violent and fierce, the other ruthless and fatal.

One operated in the open, unleashing power that could shake mountains and move the earth.

One operated in the shadows, suppressing all aura to deliver a life-taking blow.

Their timing was impeccable, occurring precisely at the moment Ye Yuan had to switch his aura while resisting the previous two attacks. Furthermore, the sudden eruption of the Rank 6 Formation’s full power had caused his aura to stagnate for a split second.

The two seized the perfect moment. Sun Yue’s mountain-collapsing giant fist sealed off Ye Yuan’s retreat, while Mo Qisha’s shadow-like God-Slaying Sword Gang stabbed directly at his vital point.

Xu Yunfan, watching from within the Thunder Formation, couldn't help but secretly praise, "Truly worthy of being the direct lineage of the Primordial Sect!"

To be honest, every true person who rose from nothing within the Primordial Sect and stepped into the Foundation Establishment realm one step at a time was a genius of breathtaking talent.

However, among geniuses, there are those who are even more breathtaking, making the others seem ordinary by comparison.

Yet, at the center of the storm, Ye Yuan’s eyes, like a cold pool, remained without a ripple.

Facing this joint attack that seemed to cut off all paths to survival, he merely uttered four indifferent words.

"Mediocre trash!"

Before the words had fully faded, the seemingly ordinary iron sword in his hand suddenly let out a low hum.

The sword body invoked the true meaning of the Big Dipper’s Yaoguang Star dividing the sea, and the phantom of the void behind him suddenly appeared once more.

Seven unimaginably large Sword Soul Stars hung high in the sky. The star at the Yaoguang position shone with ten thousand rays of light, as if the power of an entire star river was pouring into the sword’s edge.

A terrifying Sword Intent, domineering and majestic, forward-moving, capable of severing all tangible and intangible things in the world, erupted once more.

This was the fierce Sword Intent he had devoted his entire life to.

This Sword Intent was grand and awe-inspiring. The moment it erupted with full force, it caused the Rank 6 Formation enveloping the valley, the "Nine Heavens Five Thunders Yin-Yang Chaos God Covering Evil Formation," to tremble.

Ye Yuan’s wrist turned gently. The iron sword, like a startled swan or a fleeting shadow, thrust forward with a move that was simple to the extreme, yet contained the boundless true meaning of destruction.

"Sss!"

With a light sound, the long sky seemed to be cut open by an invisible sharpness.

Sun Yue’s mountain-collapsing giant fist aura, the so-called indestructible Giant Spirit Battle Body, was like paper in the face of this fierce Sword Intent.

Blood burst out from his right shoulder. The entire arm, carrying terrifying power, was instantly severed and sent flying.

The stump was as smooth as a mirror. He couldn't even let out a miserable cry. His mountain-like, burly body was shaken by the irresistible sword force, causing him to stumble and retreat violently.

At the same instant, Mo Qisha held the Shadow Seven Extinction Sword.

This lifebound treasure, entirely black, capable of absorbing light and radiating the凝聚 to the extreme aura of God-Slaying.

The sword body silently shattered inch by inch.

"Clang!"

The fragments didn't scatter. Instead, they were carried by the violent Sword Intent and surged backward, like countless black fangs, piercing deeply into Mo Qisha’s chest.

"Pfft!"

Mo Qisha’s body shook violently. The front of his blue robe was instantly soaked in blood.

Those originally deep and cold eyes were now filled with unbelievable horror and the desperation of a man facing death.

He stared fixedly at Ye Yuan, his throat making a gurgling sound. A glimmer of true spirit light suddenly lit up between his eyebrows, and he desperately tore free from his残 body.

This true spirit, carrying his remnant soul, was extremely cunning. It used the massive spiritual energy turbulence and chaotic light and shadow caused by the instant explosion and collapse of Xu Yunfan’s formation as cover, and with a "whoosh," it fled into the void. It was the Primordial Sect’s secret technique of Samsara Rebirth.

Ye Yuan’s single sword strike had forced him to abandon the body he had cultivated for many years, using only a wisp of true spirit to charge into the Samsara Nether Sea.

Xu Yunfan’s pupils contracted sharply. This fierce Sword Intent was simply unbelievable.

"Kill!"

Sun Yue, who witnessed this scene from the side, was so enraged that his eyes were about to split. Blood gushed like a spring from the stump of his right arm.

He wasn't grieving for Mo Qisha. The Ye Yuan before them possessed strength that exceeded everyone’s imagination.

With Mo Qisha dead and no one to restrain him, he would have to face Ye Yuan directly.

What despair and terror.

This man’s strength was terrifying. He had likely already touched the edge of seeking gold, and on top of that, he had comprehended the fierce Sword Intent. It was simply terrifying.

The intense pain and despair instantly ignited the ferocity deep in his bones.

"Die together!"

He roared hoarsely. The blood and energy in his body surged like mercury to the extreme. The faint golden light on his skin suddenly became intense, and his muscles and bones emitted a dull, grating sound like metal and stone grinding.

The ultimate life-forcing move of the Myriad Calamities Indestructible Giant Spirit Battle True Art, "Heaven and Earth Together," was recklessly activated.

Waves of self-destructive energy instantly formed, powerful enough to turn a hundred zhang radius into dust.

Unfortunately, Ye Yuan’s sword was faster than his collapsing will!

Turning his wrist was just a feint. Ye Yuan didn't even spare a glance at the self-destructing Sun Yue.

The three-foot-long sword simply flicked upward casually, like a goat hanging its horns. A fine, thread-like, yet extremely condensed white-gold sword rainbow surged upward, arriving later but reaching first.

Sss!

The Sword Intent precisely pierced into Sun Yue’s crazily erupting Heavenly Spirit Cover!

The刚猛 self-destructive energy that had just been brewing, without even a complete rumble, was directly cut apart and annihilated at its source by this peerless fierce Sword Intent.

Sun Yue’s mountain-like残 body, as if all its essence, energy, and spirit had been drained,软绵绵地轰然坠落尘埃, and was completely silent.

Rumble!

Only at this moment did the final, unrestrained killing move accumulated by the Nine Heavies Five Thunders Yin-Yang Chaos God Covering Formation under Xu Yunfan’s control come crashing down.

However, Ye Yuan didn't even look up.

He simply flicked his sword backward, his movements flowing smoothly, as if he had long expected this.

A white-gold sword rainbow, spanning heaven and earth, as if capable of splitting the world, instantly surged up against the heavens.

The majestic sword light collided with the purple thunder filling the sky.

Zila!

Boom!

The billions of thunderbolts were like a狂潮 crashing against a reef, torn apart in the middle by this powerful and domineering sword light.

The terrifying shockwave shattered the clouds, and the Yin-Yang Evil Force chains shattered inch by inch.

The core formation flag of the peak Rank 6 Formation, amidst a grating sound of shattering, exploded with a bang!

The formation was directly broken by this single sword strike.

The shockwave from the broken formation swept through the canyon. Xu Yunfan’s heart gave a violent alarm. He suddenly turned his head to look at the position where Zhang Qiaoluo and Lu Chuan had been standing moments before.

But he only saw the strong wind sweeping over the broken stones. Where was there a single person?!

"They escaped?!"

A nameless fire "whooshed" up in Xu Yunfan’s heart, and he almost cursed out loud.

Not a single one of them had any sense of honor when they came out to play.

It was completely the style of the Primordial Sect!

Deserting in the heat of battle, letting the Taoist friends die rather than oneself—this was an instinct engraved in their bones.

When they came out to play, the "righteousness" of these fellow sect brothers and sisters was truly thin to the extreme.

They had started by speaking with such justice and righteousness, but once there was trouble, they really ran.

Just as Xu Yunfan was distracted and cursing in this lightning-fast moment, Ye Yuan’s cold gaze had already pierced through the smoke and dust, locking firmly onto him.

That gaze was like a tangible sword edge, stabbing Xu Yunfan’s back with coldness. The Martial Dao Sky Eye between his eyebrows actually instinctively felt a chill.

Xu Yunfan dared not hesitate for half a moment.

While cursing in his heart, the three layers of karma secret techniques around his body instantly operated to the extreme. He formed a hand seal and detonated the final, on-the-verge-of-collapse formation.
