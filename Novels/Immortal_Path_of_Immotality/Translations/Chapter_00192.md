# Chapter 190: The Light of Righteousness (Happy New Year)

Within the borders of Lu Country, a flying vessel soared across the sky.

The passengers peered down with fresh curiosity, having never ventured beyond Great Song to such distant lands—even the Daoist Huang and Yan Yuanchun were no exception.

Villages with curling smoke, grand towering cities, meticulously arranged terraced fields, and academies resonating with recitations—Lu Country seemed to have a strong scholarly atmosphere. Every region had Confucian academies where children of appropriate age learned to read and write. Occasionally, they could hear common folk revering the sages' rites and laws.

However, this was only true for the first half of their journey. Ten days later, the scenery below changed dramatically. Many academies lay abandoned, overgrown with weeds and reduced to ruins, inhabited only by wolves and wild hares.

"We must have entered the territory of the three demonic sects," Yan Yuanchun remarked, holding a jade slip map given by the Black Lotus Sect's Discipline Dharma King before their retreat. She pinpointed their approximate location.

The map roughly outlined the power distribution across dozens of nearby countries. Lu Country was split into two vast regions—black and white. The black represented the demonic sects: the Black Lotus Sect, Blood River Hall, and Hundred Ghosts Sect. The white represented the two major Confucian clans and various local orthodox sects.

Speaking of Lu Country's Confucian sects, Yan Yuanchun shared the intelligence gathered by the Black Lotus Sect. These so-called "Confucian sects" were not true Confucian practitioners but rather cultivators cloaked in Confucian guise. They cultivated something called "righteous qi," but like demonic qi, blood qi, or ghost qi, it was merely a variant transformed from spiritual energy.

In this world, spiritual energy was the dominant force—a hallmark of this cultivation era. True Confucianism had vanished several chaotic epochs ago. Legends spoke of an era when "literary qi" permeated the world, where great scholars could command the heavens and earth with their words. Modern cultivators scoffed at such tales, dismissing them as absurd.

Even the current "Confucian sects" merely fashioned their magical tools to resemble scholarly implements. They might spout lofty words, but in battle, they fought no differently from other cultivators. They consumed pills, used spirit stones, and valued the six arts of cultivation far more than poetry or calligraphy. A well-written poem might earn praise, but in a fight, who would bother with verses?

According to the demonic sects' investigations, Lu Country's cultivation forces adopted the "Confucian" facade because certain scheming elders sought to emulate ancient records from ruins of bygone epochs, hoping to cultivate legendary powers. The "academies" were merely fronts, charging spirit stones to teach cultivation techniques and spells.

A millennium ago, the three demonic sects migrated here under the support of a super demonic sect spanning dozens of countries. After arduous struggles, they carved out a foothold in Lu Country, eventually splitting the land equally with the local orthodox factions. Behind the scenes, this conflict seemed to mirror a larger power struggle between two super factions, with Lu Country serving as a mere chessboard—details beyond the ken of ordinary cultivators.

Five days later, the landscape grew increasingly desolate. Villages and cities lay empty, the land barren and strewn with corpses. The group grew puzzled—had the demonic sects failed to manage their territory properly? In the Eastern Sea, they recalled, demonic sects had maintained order without indiscriminate slaughter.

Their confusion deepened as they arrived at the marked location on the map. The area was eerily silent, dominated by three towering peaks that pierced the clouds like colossal swords. 

The right peak bore a majestic blood-red palace shrouded in a sea of crimson. The central peak featured a fearsome ghost king statue with bared fangs. The left peak hosted a colossal Buddha seated serenely on a lotus throne.

Yan Yuanchun pointed ahead, explaining, "These three spiritual mountains are the headquarters of the demonic sects. To withstand the orthodox factions' attacks, they've formed a defensive triangle. The outer appearance is just an illusion—a grand protective formation shields the true sect grounds. Once inside, we'll see bustling fellow disciples."

The demonic cultivators' faces lit up with excitement, eager to return to their holy land. Though the unnatural silence unsettled them, they brushed it aside in their anticipation.

Lin Shan trembled with excitement, eyeing the giant Buddha atop the left peak. Had the Black Lotus Sect stored their faith power there? If he could just touch it, would ancient essence flood into him?

Yan Yuanchun formed hand seals, following the instructions in the jade slip, and opened a portal in the protective formation. The flying vessel passed through a rippling light barrier.

A strange sensation washed over them as they entered a swirling tunnel of blue and black patterns. The dizzying visuals made some nauseous, but they obediently closed their eyes.

The tunnel ended abruptly. With a "whoosh," the vessel emerged into chaos.

"Kill! Eradicate the demonic heretics today!"

"Leave none alive! Purge the three sects!"

"Restore Lu Country! Expel the evil!"

"The light of righteousness shines upon the land~"

Lin Shan and the others were dumbfounded. Wasn't this the demonic sects' headquarters? Why were they singing about "the light of righteousness"?

As their vision cleared, they saw the three towering peaks—but swarming with white-robed Confucian cultivators, numbering in the tens of thousands! The demonic cultivators, clad in black and red, were retreating up the mountains under relentless assault.

The sky blazed with magical clashes. A dozen colossal figures—Nascent Soul elders—battled fiercely. Golden Core experts dueled mid-air, their spells lighting up the heavens.

Their flying vessel had stumbled into a full-scale invasion. The demonic sects' headquarters were under siege, their grand formation breached. They had arrived just in time to witness the final assault.

Lin Shan connected the dots—the abandoned lands they'd passed, the sudden withdrawal of allies in Great Song, the lack of reinforcements—it all made sense now.

Before they could react, Confucian artillery locked onto their vessel.

"Boom!"

The defensive formations shattered like eggshells. The explosion sent Lin Shan flying, crashing onto a battlefield below. Dazed and aching, he struggled to his feet amidst the carnage.

Around him, corpses littered the ruins. Small skirmishes persisted, but the main battle raged on the central peak. 

Surveying the chaos, Lin Shan shuddered. "This isn't my fight. Time to leave!"

His miniature skeleton companion, Black Skeleton Demon Lord, chimed in, "Let's find Elder Zhong—a Nascent Soul expert can protect us—"

Before it could finish, they spotted Daoist Huang locked in combat with a Confucian elder.

"Never mind," the skeleton amended. "Too dangerous. Let's find Protector Yan—"

But Yan Yuanchun was already engaged with a Golden Core opponent.

The skeleton hesitated. "Well... maybe regroup with Luan Chun—"

A glance revealed Luan Chun and her group surrounded by white-robed attackers.

The skeleton fell silent under Lin Shan's withering gaze. "Fine. Let's just run."

"Ha! Found another survivor!" Two Confucian cultivators descended, eyeing Lin Shan like prey. "This one took two cannon blasts unscathed. Easy merit for us!"

The skeleton shrunk into silence.

The two scholars, clearly avoiding the frontlines, leisurely discussed Lin Shan's fate as if he were already captured.

Lin Shan steadied his breathing, subtly recovering with the help of his artifact. He stepped forward with a polite bow.

The scholars returned the gesture, puzzled.

Lin Shan smiled innocently. "Why stop me, brothers? Shouldn't you be fighting at the front?"

They blinked. "Aren't you a demonic heretic?"

Lin Shan spread his hands. "I'm just passing through. Do I look like a demonic cultivator to you?"
