# Chapter 276: She Has No Beloved Demon, Does He Prefer Humans?

The violent natural forces of the Five Elements Realm's various regions calmed as they reached the solitary peak at its center, as if reaching a harmonious equilibrium.

"Fifty..."

"Seventy-two..."

"Eighty..."

Li Mo counted the various essences the System had just rewarded him with as he descended the solitary peak.

He had just saved too many demons and hadn't had time to tally them up. Now that he had finished counting, he realized the number had exceeded seventy-two types, reaching over a hundred. He even had the luxury of being picky, eliminating those with overlapping bloodline powers.

Unfortunately, there wasn't enough time; he would have to refine the essences one by one after leaving.

For now, he needed to secure the Divine Jade Phoenix...

"Hm?"

Li Mo retracted his thoughts and looked down at the foot of the solitary peak, seeing various demon races standing there. He couldn't help but look puzzled.

Because the Peerless Flood Dragon had saved them from suffering, and the Azure Luan Goddess had slain demons and eliminated evil.

The demons gathered at the foot of the solitary peak were exceptionally numerous.

However, each and every demon stood there, not a single one taking a step to go up. Those who were familiar with each other huddled together for warmth, whispering about their recent experiences.

After talking it over, they discovered that many demons had come here for... the exact same reason?

Thus, all the demons turned their gaze toward a certain pure-blooded flood dragon who had just arrived.

"The moment Wu Mo descended from the heavens, he was simply my peerless hero."

"He even rushed across two realms just for me; he has me in his heart."

"He not only saved me but also kindly told me to 'get lost a bit.' He even knows that my Wild Boar Clan likes to roll in the mud. He truly understands me."

"I hope he doesn't get hurt in his struggle with the Azure Luan Goddess..."

Li Mo: "?"

He vaguely remembered a past life where he performed a brave act for justice, and a girl said she would repay him by being a cow or a horse in her next life.

Why is everyone wanting to give themselves to him now?

At this moment, a certain Azure Luan Goddess seemed out of place.

Behind her was the magnificent radiance of the Divine Jade Phoenix, casting a flowing luster onto the tassels of her green dress. Her serene gaze swept over the chattering demons of various races before lingering faintly on one.

*Ding-a-ling—*
*Bzzzt—*

The Azure Luan clansmen began communicating among themselves.

"Why does everyone want Wu Mo to win? Damn it, we can't speak, and these crude demons don't understand music."

"Goddess, you can speak, so why are you silent?"

"Sss... Since she can speak, has she already found her fated one?"

"The other night, I got up to use the restroom. Guess what I saw?"

"I saw the Goddess go to the Tree of Fate alone!"

The Azure Luan Clan and the bird clans who were secretly enjoying the gossip through the music heard the meaning within the melody and couldn't help but recoil in shock.

Her?

The Tree of Fate?

Are these two things even compatible in the same style?

"So our Azure Luan Goddess also has a demon that haunts her dreams?"

"I have no beloved demon."

A fair, slender finger gently plucked the strings of the zither, and the sound of flowing water came from the instrument. However, the sound seemed to emanate from the girl's embrace.

Along with the zither music came the girl's slightly dissatisfied sidelong glance.

Opposite her, the young Flood Dragon Li saw the big-headed doll's head being rubbed even harder and felt his scalp tingle. His mouth suddenly moved on its own accord:

"Stop! Everyone, look at me!"

"Actually, I don't like demon races!"

The Peerless Flood Dragon Li's words rang out with the weight of iron. His firm gaze was like other demons looking at a divine jade from beyond the heavens.

The foot of the solitary peak immediately erupted in an uproar. Especially some female demons who had already set their hearts on him; they were struck as if by a bolt from the blue, their demon hearts shattering into pieces on the ground.

The Peerless Flood Dragon actually wasn't interested in demons?

Then does he mean...

This statement quickly sparked widespread discussion among all demon races. Even the Demon Kings and Great Demons watching the Heavenly Screen from the outside couldn't help but voice their opinions.

"Not interested in demons? Does that mean he likes... humans?"

The Whale Clan Demon King looked stunned, muttering to himself.

---

"Then does that mean the True Dragon bloodline cannot stay in the demon race?! What about the diversity of our demon race's bloodlines?!" A Great Demon lamented in pain.

"How can that be? That's just too perverse," Manbo said with grief and indignation.

Wu Qing: "?"

"Great Masters, say something! Isn't it said that once a human-demon romance appears among humans, monks will come out to execute heaven's will?"

This was a cultured demon who knew a little about things on the human side.

But not much.

The monks of the Void Monastery: "......"

Heng Yuan: "....."

"Master, why is your face red?"

Murong Xiao asked with concern; his master seemed to be in great discomfort.

Monk Huai Kong's eyes were blank for a moment; he vaguely remembered there was such a thing. He tore open the void and took out a book:

"Ah, this poor monk seems to have seen a record of this matter and bought the book back."

"This story is purely fictional; please do not project it onto reality?"

Murong Xiao saw the words on the book cover.

Then he heard Monk Huai Kong frown and say:

"Yes, I remember now. The baldies in this book are terrible. Our monastery's monks should take warning from this and not do such things that damage merit."

Heng Yuan Old Monk's face turned even redder.

No beloved demon...
Not liking demon races...

Shang Qinqin held a bag of sunflower seeds, watching the young man and girl in the Heavenly Screen. Her eyes shone, and she cracked the seeds faster and faster.

She was completely focused and didn't notice the unfriendly expression of the Void Monastery's floor-sweeping monk.

At this time, a demon asked:

"The Azure Luan Clan is regarded by humans as a symbol of love and is most versed in matters of the heart. What does Clan Leader Shang think of this?"

"I'm watching while cracking seeds."

"????"

"Ahem, Wu Mo came from human territory and has never seen other demons since he was young. It's understandable that he would like human women."

Meanwhile.

Inside the Five Elements Realm.

Chidra and the half-demons looked at each other, lost in thought.

This isn't right?

What were they here for again?

So no one cares about the Heavenly Jade?

"You guys said, since Wu Mo likes humans but not demons, what does he think of human-demon hybrids?" a half-demon woman with three pink fox tails muttered.

Chidra and a few half-demons frowned and looked at her, so she lowered her head.

The battle for the divine jade was supposed to be at its most intense now that they had reached the foot of the solitary peak.

But now the demons have no intention of fighting at all!

"If the other demons don't fight, how will the True Phoenix bloodline and the True Dragon bloodline fight?"

Chidra felt this couldn't go on.

Squinting his eyes, he walked into the open space between the Peerless Flood Dragon and the Azure Luan Goddess.

"Hmph..."

"Scram."

He had only uttered a tone word when he was cut off by the voice of Ying Bingqing, as cold as the moon.

It was because Chidra just had to block her line of sight.

"..."

Chidra had a noble identity and was revered as a Divine Son; when had he ever been treated like this? He gritted his teeth and roared:

"Scram! Just! Scram!"

He had only rolled halfway.

The light of the Heavenly Jade on the solitary peak suddenly burst forth with ten thousand phenomena. In a daze, one could see countless strange beasts and fantastical clans, all vividly alive within the light and shadow.

The Heavenly Jade was about to decide its owner.
