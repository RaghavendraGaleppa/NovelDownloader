# Chapter 148: The Imperial Treasury

Countless demonic cultivators surged into the capital city of Bianliang from all directions, their spiritual lights illuminating the darkness. 

Above them, hundreds of glowing orbs clashed in the sky while below, hundreds of thousands of soldiers roared in battle both inside and outside the city walls. Millions of commoners were displaced, turning the hundred-mile radius into complete chaos.

Lin Shan summoned the high-grade magical artifact "Puppet Chariot" he had obtained from Elder Tortoise, loading it with over twenty subordinates. They crushed through the corpses and ruins outside the city walls, following the tide of invaders straight through the southern gate.

As they charged forward, countless arrows rained down from the city towers, but Lin Shan's men on the chariot blocked them all without him needing to lift a finger.

Once inside the city, they found streets and alleys filled with chaotic battles between Foundation Establishment and Qi Condensation cultivators. The demonic cultivators wore black cuffs while the righteous ones sported purple sashes, making it easy to distinguish friend from foe.

The rumbling Puppet Chariot rolled forward, its bronze puppet horses leaping over tripwires set up by righteous cultivators along the streets. Various obstacle artifacts like caltrops and spiked barriers were smashed through by the unstoppable chariot.

Spells bombarded them from all sides, but Black Skeleton Lord, Old Man Zhong, and the others channeled spiritual energy into the chariot's defensive barrier, blocking the attacks like fireworks against a shield. Magical artifacts came flying at them, only to be knocked away by the chariot's bronze puppet drivers, their spears moving in impenetrable patterns.

The group advanced relentlessly, their momentum unstoppable. Cultivators on the southern avenue scattered before them, none daring to stand in their way. The chariot raced through the streets like a hurricane, crushing through obstacles and dominating the battlefield.

From a bird's-eye view, the Puppet Chariot resembled a sharp blade slicing through waves of people, charging from outside the city straight into its heart with unstoppable force.

Black Skeleton Lord and Old Man Zhong stood proudly on either side, their subordinates swelling with pride behind them. The two bronze puppets remained immovable, ignoring everything around them as they marched forward with heads held high—as if traversing unopposed territory.

Lin Shan sat imposingly at the chariot's center, appearing calm as an old dog while inwardly panicking like a startled colt.

Fortunately, the Golden Core cultivators were all occupied with each other in the skies, leaving no time to bother with those below. Otherwise, even if righteous Golden Cores couldn't intervene due to battlefield rules, a demonic Golden Core might have taken offense at this upstart's arrogance and casually cut him down.

But in this vast battlefield with thousands of Foundation Establishment cultivators, there were always those who couldn't stand Lin Shan's ostentatious display. How dare a mere early Foundation Establishment cultivator put on such airs?

Two righteous Foundation Establishment cultivators blocked their path, their robes embroidered with crane patterns from some third-rate sect. Without hesitation, Lin Shan tossed out his ring and jade bracelet artifacts.

The two artifacts expanded midair, encircling the opponents. As the righteous cultivators hurriedly summoned their own artifacts to defend, Lin Shan followed up with a teacup and a miniature pagoda that came crashing down, trapping the duo inside with loud banging noises.

Lin Shan nodded in satisfaction—he had perfectly replicated Qi Zhong's signature move from the Qianyun Pavilion. This four-artifact combo could trap most opponents for a good while. As the chariot passed the hundred-meter mark, the four artifacts returned to him.

The two righteous cultivators emerged blinking into the light, exchanged glances, and decided against pursuit. Anyone who could casually toss out four high-grade artifacts wasn't someone they could handle—they themselves had only two high-grade artifacts, painstakingly saved up over years.

After all, small sects couldn't compare to top-tier ones. Between paying sect taxes for spiritual veins and cave dwellings, a Foundation Establishment cultivator might only earn a few hundred spirit stones a year—barely enough for cultivation resources, let alone saving up for artifacts. Even rogue cultivators had it worse!

In the cultivation world, wealth accumulated with time and age, leading to gradual strength increases—this was common knowledge.

That young man earlier, with his abundance of artifacts at such a young age, was clearly either extraordinarily lucky or backed by a powerful patron. Either way, not someone to provoke.

Lin Shan mused that these artifacts had practically thrown themselves at him—he couldn't refuse even if he wanted to. How embarrassing.

Weaving through the city's chaotic streets, the Puppet Chariot crushed through countless thoroughfares filled with battles. Though many Foundation Establishment cultivators tried to stop them, Lin Shan forcefully broke through each time—his true target was the Great Song Imperial Palace.

That long-coveted Black Lotus Buddha Statue!

With his subordinates' help, Lin Shan reached the palace gates with minimal spiritual energy expenditure. Thousands of demonic cultivators were already bombarding the palace's defensive formations, finally breaking through with a cacophony of ghostly howls.

Lin Shan arrived just as the palace fell, marveling at the demonic cultivators' ferocity. The southern and northern gates had only been breached less than two hours ago—he'd rushed here as fast as he could, yet they'd already taken the palace?

Watching the wolf-like demonic cultivators swarm inside, Lin Shan hurried in after them, leaving the chariot outside. With Black Skeleton Lord and Old Man Zhong guarding it, they should be safe enough.

---

This was Lin Shan's third visit to the palace. The outnumbered righteous cultivators inside were gradually overwhelmed by the demonic tide. Palace maids and eunuchs fled in all directions while mortal imperial guards attempted futile resistance.

Human desires ran rampant—many demonic cultivators leered as they stormed into palaces, committing acts of rape and plunder.

With the imperial harem's three thousand beauties—maids and concubines alike—the demonic cultivators were like tigers among sheep.

Screams, cries, curses, and ghostly howls filled the air, transforming the imperial sanctum into a living hell.

"Demonic scum, all of you deserve death!"

A thunderous roar came from ahead as a middle-aged man in purple Daoist robes appeared. Dark clouds gathered above him, lightning dancing wildly as countless bolts struck down.

Lin Shan recognized him—"Thundercloud Master," an old acquaintance from the Purple Mists Sect. Even now, he remained dutifully guarding the palace. Remembering how Thundercloud Master had once saved his life, Lin Shan felt awkward about their current opposing factions. Better to avoid meeting altogether.

Pulling a veil artifact from his hidden storage bracelet and adding a bamboo hat for good measure, Lin Shan skirted around Thundercloud Master toward the palace depths.

---

Crash!

A palace door was kicked open, letting in a cold gust of wind. Several demonic cultivators inside, about to assault palace maids and concubines, turned angrily at the interruption.

"Who the hell—"

Their voices died as they sensed the Foundation Establishment aura from the newcomer. The men froze, unsure whether to pull up their half-dropped pants or not.

"Ten breaths. Get out."

The intruders scrambled away gratefully, even closing the door behind them while inwardly grumbling—high cultivation really had its privileges. How could one man handle so many women?

Ignoring their vulgar thoughts, Lin Shan approached a disheveled concubine: "Where's the imperial treasury?"

The woman only sobbed, her milk-white skin exposed through torn silks, her mind clearly shattered by the near-violation.

"Answer me! Where's the treasury?"

Lin Shan frowned impatiently. His time was limited—who knew if other cultivators had already reached the giant Black Lotus Buddha Statue? With demonic cultivators' tendency to leave no stone unturned, he'd find nothing but scraps if he delayed.

The maids all wept with their mistress as if Lin Shan were forcing some depraved orgy.

Twang!

He flicked his sword, its hum vibrating through the hall.

"Count of three. No answer—you die."

"Three."

"Two."

"Wait! North palace! Behind the fake mountain by the second well!"

Lin Shan sheathed his sword, adjusted his hat, and bolted north. Behind him, the maids stared blankly at his retreating figure while the concubine continued sobbing.

The palace was packed—every demonic cultivator knew the imperial city held the capital's greatest treasures. The crowds thickened by the minute.

Unable to push through, Lin Shan summoned a mid-grade flying sword to skim above the throng—only to be intercepted by an imperial Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"Imperial grounds forbid demonic trespass!"

Lin Shan, rushing toward the treasury, looked up and grinned.

It was the very same imperial elder who'd once hunted him! Before Lin Shan could seek him out, the man had delivered himself.

"Heh! I am the Mighty Bear Mountain Master. Your bad luck to meet me!"

Opting for a quick resolution, Lin Shan charged straight at him. The elder blinked in confusion—shouldn't they exchange ranged spells first? Was this brute really going for melee combat?

Mighty Bear Mountain Master? The name sounded formidable—a body cultivator?

As the elder hastily summoned a high-grade defensive artifact, determined to block this intruder, Lin Shan's azure sword flashed.

Sssshhk!

They passed each other in a blur. The elder and his artifact split cleanly in half, tumbling from the sky in a shower of blood.

Lin Shan never broke stride, streaking north like a meteor while the elder's storage bag mysteriously flew after him.

---

After much searching, Lin Shan finally located the imperial treasury in the northern palace depths.

A few demonic cultivators rummaged about when a shout came from above:

"I am the Mighty Bear Mountain Master! All of you—scram!"

Looking up to see a veiled, hat-wearing Foundation Establishment cultivator glaring coldly, they fled without hesitation. Demonic cultivators were notoriously temperamental—killing their own was commonplace. Better safe than sorry.

Lin Shan nodded, pleased with this alias. "Mighty Bear Mountain Master" sounded intimidatingly fierce—perfect for intimidation. Moreover, moving through the Black Lotus Sect's ranks while searching for the statue required anonymity.

With the area cleared, he approached a fake mountain entrance in the front garden. The winding underground path led to a bronze door—likely protected only by imperial family's formations rather than the major sects' grand arrays. A single slash from his Water Severing Sword split both door and wards, allowing him to stroll inside.

The interior opened into a vast underground space illuminated by luminous pearls. Stacks of gold and silver ingots covered the floor, chests of jade and agate stood neatly arranged, shelves displayed antiques and curios...

There were also mundane divine weapons—each comparable to the Kunwu Blade he'd once gifted Nightingale Jiang.

Silks and satins hung on racks, martial arts manuals filled bookshelves, aged medicinal roots sat in boxes, and mortal elixirs rested in jade bottles...

Finally, in the deepest corner:

A ten-foot-tall Black Lotus Buddha Statue.
