# Chapter 59: Parting Ways  

The massacre at the Flesh Market had shattered Fang Yi and Xiao Liu's fundamental understanding of the world.  

Among those they had witnessed—Tu Sheng, the Great Ape, Yang Fan, and Han Yue—these cultivators wielded formidable divine abilities and secret treasures. Their combat prowess was fundamentally different from that of ordinary cultivators like Fang Yi in the Flesh Market.  

The gap between them was as vast as two separate worlds.  

When the Great Ape unleashed his **Heaven-Earth Dharma Form**, even the third-tier leader of the merchant house fled in terror. The seemingly powerful and long-established Flesh Market shattered like an egg at the slightest touch. Against the overwhelming might of the Great Ape, the ordinary cultivators of the Flesh Market stood no chance.  

Meanwhile, Yang Fan and Han Yue slaughtered second-tier demon beasts as easily as butchering dogs and chickens. With their divine abilities, they could even challenge the Great Ape, a higher-tier opponent. Just these two alone surpassed the combined strength of most rogue cultivators in the Flesh Market.  

Fang Yi and Xiao Liu's perspectives had undergone a fundamental shift.  

Originally, the Flesh Market had been their birthplace, their home filled with family and friends. Courtyard Nine was their ancestral legacy, a small, stable haven within the chaotic market. At one point, their ambitions had been simple—to cultivate diligently, hunt well, and strive to become second-tier cultivators as soon as possible. They wanted to slay more demons, earn more money, and lead Courtyard Nine to a better life.  

In the teachings passed down from their elders, there had never been any mention of pursuing the power of the third-tier Divine Realm.  

But now, having witnessed how easily true power in this world could obliterate everything they cherished, Fang Yi and Xiao Liu were forced to reshape their worldview.  

From a cultivator's perspective, the two, who had once been muddled, now viewed their cultivation with a higher purpose for the first time.  

This was the solidification of their Dao Hearts.  

In truth, it wasn’t just Fang Yi and Xiao Liu—many cultivators in the Flesh Market felt the same. Whether driven by admiration, hatred, or fear, they all awakened to the impulse of pursuing a greater path.  

Yet within the Flesh Market, there was no inheritance of the great Dao. Many factions didn’t even possess methods to ascend to the third tier.  

Thus, Fang Yi and Xiao Liu had long considered leaving with Han Yue to seek their own paths.  

But plans could never keep up with changes.  

The three of them had different directions to pursue.  

Han Yue had already determined his path, while Fang Yi and Xiao Liu still needed to search for theirs.  

After hearing their thoughts, Han Yue could only offer his blessings.  

His own Dao Heart was resolute, but he never imposed his views or demands on the cultivation paths of those around him.  

---  

To Han Yue, it was naturally a good thing that his two friends sought higher aspirations.  

From his **Silver Hairpin**, he retrieved two talismans and said,  

"Fang Yi, Xiao Liu, with your bloodline-based cultivation, the Beast Taming Sect in Guizhou would be the most suitable for you."  

"Here are two sect tokens of the Beast Taming Sect. With these, you can directly enter as inner disciples."  

"Additionally, one of the sect’s true disciples, Luo Erjia, is a good friend of mine."  

"I’ll write a letter for you. Once you arrive at the sect, seek her out for some protection."  

Having already successfully taken a master, Han Yue was about to leave Guizhou. The Beast Taming Sect’s entry tokens he had accumulated were now useless to him—better to use them to help his friends.  

Fang Yi and Xiao Liu hadn’t expected such a pleasant surprise.  

Xiao Liu couldn’t help but exclaim,  

"Brother Blade, you always manage to surprise me! You’ve even prepared our future paths!"  

"I was worried my aptitude wouldn’t be enough to enter a sect with Sister Fang Yi!"  

Han Yue gave them his final advice.  

"Once you enter the Beast Taming Sect, focus wholeheartedly on your cultivation!"  

"Being a disciple of a major sect is vastly different from being a rogue cultivator in the Flesh Market. Prioritize longevity above all else!"  

Fang Yi and Xiao Liu nodded in agreement.  

With their paths set, the three of them no longer had any attachment to the ruined Flesh Market. After chatting for a while longer, they each retired to their rooms.  

The next morning, Han Yue stepped out of his room.  

A day of meditation had dispelled all the exhaustion of the past days. After a night of studying **The Supreme Cavern-Nine Heavens Spirit Refinement Secret Record**, his horizons had broadened immensely.  

Glancing at the still-closed doors of his friends’ rooms, he said nothing.  

Among cultivators, partings were inevitable. The mountains were high, the roads long—if fate willed it, they would meet again.  

Han Yue summoned his escape light and soared toward the meeting point with his master.  

Some time later, Fang Yi awoke. Seeing Han Yue’s empty room, she remained silent.  

She then roused Xiao Liu, and the two began packing.  

Unlike Han Yue’s unburdened departure, Fang Yi and Xiao Liu loaded a large cart with weapons, equipment, provisions, and valuables—fully prepared for their long journey.  

Only then did they set off, their sixteen-horse-drawn cart speeding away.  

In the Flesh Market, countless lives bustled about, unaware that by sheer coincidence, true cultivators of the great Dao had emerged from this remote corner of the world.  

Han Yue streaked through the sky, his golden light piercing the clouds.  

---  

As he flew, he contemplated the three newly acquired cultivation manuals in his mind.  

**Thunder Nourishes the Soul** and **Silken Thunder Armor** required careful study before he could begin practicing them properly.  

Meanwhile, **The Supreme Cavern-Nine Heavens Spirit Refinement Secret Record** could serve as an intriguing read, something to peruse in his spare time.  

Han Yue skipped over the refinement processes and focused instead on the functions of the artifacts and the required third-tier materials.  

Far from finding it dull, he was fascinated by the myriad mystical artifacts and unique third-tier treasures described.  

Among the three third-tier materials in his possession—**Stone-Encased Flame**, **Hare-Hour Gold**, and **Tiger-Hour Silver**—each could serve as the primary material for formidable artifacts.  

Take, for example, this one:  

**Artifact: Heart-Lantern Basket**  

**Effects:**  
- Can refine flame cores within the body, tempering flesh and spirit to enhance cultivation.  
- Greatly amplifies the power of compatible elemental divine abilities.  
- Can unleash flame cores to attack enemies.  

**Third-Tier Primary Materials:**  
Stone-Encased Flame, Samadhi True Flame, Southern Brightness Departing Flame, Solar True Flame, Frost-Within Cold Flame, and other third-tier spiritual fires.  

The **Heart-Lantern Basket** was clearly a formidable treasure. Beyond offense, it offered numerous benefits, including cultivation enhancement and divine ability amplification.  

**Stone-Encased Flame** seemed poorly suited for the Shenxiao Palace’s true inheritance, as it could only forge a limited number of artifacts.  

Aside from the **Heart-Lantern Basket**, there was only one other artifact—**Five Viscera Refining Furnace**—with similarly profound effects.  

**Artifact: Five Viscera Refining Furnace**  

**Effects:**  
- Refines the five viscera, six bowels, sinews, bones, skin, and flesh.  
- Tempers the body, replenishes vital life essence, dispels illness, and extends lifespan.  
- Greatly enhances the effects of body-refining divine abilities.  
- Can refine materials to replenish essence and boost cultivation.  

**Third-Tier Primary Materials:**  
Stone-Encased Flame, Southern Brightness Departing Flame, Samadhi True Flame, and other third-tier spiritual fires.  

The **Five Viscera Refining Furnace** was clearly tailored for bloodline cultivators, offering immense benefits to physical cultivation.  

Yet it still didn’t suit Han Yue’s needs.  

In contrast, the other two third-tier metals—**Hare-Hour Gold** and **Tiger-Hour Silver**—had far broader applications. The artifacts they could forge were much more compatible with Han Yue’s path.
