# Chapter 60: Traces of the Python

"Brother, thanks to your strategy of luring the enemy out, otherwise I wouldn't have known how to deal with the Lake Mountain bandits. This battle has severely weakened them - they're no longer a threat."

At the victory banquet, Prefect Feng raised his cup to toast Zhou Qing. Though now a high-ranking prefect, while Zhou Qing was merely a provincial scholar who hadn't passed the imperial exams (meaning the best official position he could obtain was a seventh-rank county magistrate), Prefect Feng's enthusiasm toward Zhou Qing remained undiminished.

Beyond admiring Zhou Qing's character and talent, the considerable profits he gained annually from Zhou Qing's business ventures also played... a minor role. 

After all, officials traveled thousands of miles only for wealth.

This sworn brother of his allowed him to make money without large-scale corruption, and now had even helped him achieve this bandit-suppression merit - practically a rebirth parent. Now he wouldn't need to worry about failing the year-end performance review. 

Prefect Feng was truly a capable minister of his generation, not some idle bureaucrat. As for Chang Wanli, he was an excellent trainer for the naval forces, also recommended by Zhou Qing.

Zhou Qing clinked cups with the prefect and smiled modestly: "This was all the prefect's achievement. I merely provided some small intelligence."

Prefect Feng chuckled, "Brother remains as humble as ever. Fortune-tellers once said my success would be built on ten thousand bones, which I half-believed, fearing I'd fail those around me. But after meeting you, I realized you're the noble person in my destiny. Let's toast together - today is Minor New Year's Eve. I wish everyone glorious prospects and good fortune in the coming year."

The cups kept clinking in continuous celebration.

Chang Wanli thanked Zhou Qing repeatedly, his tiger-like eyes glistening with tears. That day's heavy blow against the Lake Mountain bandits had avenged half of his Immortal Mist Sect's grievances. 

This iron-willed man, who had fought through severe injuries to escort his sect's orphans to Qingfu Temple for treatment without shedding a tear, now had moist eyes. He'd thought revenge would take ten years, yet in less than two years it was partially achieved - entirely due to Scholar Zhou's recommendation and the prefect's discerning eye.

Never had this martial artist imagined he'd become a prefecture's naval chief instructor, now poised for further promotion through military merit, surpassing all his sect's former members. Truly his ancestors' blessing.

Commoners practiced martial arts or studied ultimately to earn money. Scholarship was naturally preferable, sparing physical hardship. But Scholar Zhou's mastery of both civil and martial arts, along with his medical skills, was utterly admirable. 

Chang Wanli, though rough, understood such a man would thrive in both peace and chaos. He was grateful to Prefect Feng, but more so to Scholar Zhou.

In official terms, Zhou Qing was his patron and lifesaver - a relationship indelible for life, encompassing both recommendation and salvation.

The naval commander also treated Zhou Qing with unusual courtesy, which puzzled Zhou Qing. This Commander Sun had little interaction with him, and though sworn brothers with Prefect Feng, his politeness seemed excessive.

Only when Commander Sun presented a farewell gift, whispering "Give my regards to the prince," did Zhou Qing understand - the commander belonged to Prince Qinghe's faction, having received a letter mentioning Scholar Zhou of neighboring Jiangzhou as a distant relative of the late princess and a man of great talent to be treated respectfully if encountered. 

The official networks were complex, but ultimately required capability to warrant connections.

The operation led by Prefect Feng and Commander Sun severely damaged the Lake Mountain bandits. While clearing the battlefield, they discovered corpses from the Sea Sand Gang and Golden Light Temple among the bandits, learning through interrogations how vicious the bandits had been - even turning on their underworld allies.

Only Elder Zhitong of Golden Light Temple survived, though the vicious bandits had left the renowned Jiangzhou monk severely injured - limbs severed, senses destroyed, now deaf, mute, blind, and unable to write. 

Being Buddhist, Prefect Feng alleviated the elder's pain and rushed him to Golden Light Temple, fearing his death outside would be life's great regret. Official reports merely mentioned the bandit suppression victory, with details conveyed through confidential letters.

Zhou Qing's group had never visited Lake Mountain or Tai Lake, but still lamented the bandits' brutality. Golden Light Temple and Qingfu Temple shared Jiangzhou, while the Sea Sand Gang were allies of the Black Tiger Gang - making the incident both tragic and... satisfying.

"Junior brother, remember this mantra: 'The dormant dragon has yet to rise, the thunder has yet to sound.'"

Zhou Qing's Shadowless Steps grew more refined, his blood and qi flow enhancing lightness, moving silently through tender foliage with only sunlight-cast shadows betraying his presence. Observers might mistake it for ghostly movement.

Venturing miles deep, he spotted deer drinking at a stream when suddenly a crimson python erupted from the water, swallowing a fawn with terrifying speed that stunned even Zhou Qing. 

The python's hunting prowess, unimpeded by previous poison and chicken harassment, unsettled him. Regaining composure, Zhou Qing followed at a distance until explosive thunder-like sounds led him to a shocking sight - a maddened daoist, bones resonating like thunder, wrestling the python bare-handed.

Returning, Zhou Qing noted the great mulberry tree's eerie chill, though its joyful swaying seemed genuine - perhaps spring's effect. His rooster companion, Morning Sun, brought a foot-long red snake whose consumption advanced Zhou Qing's Deer Play mantra. 

After taking another seventh-grade Blood Qi Pill to solidify the Deer Play's foundation, Zhou Qing gave two of his remaining five pills to Fusoong to aid his thunder-receiving ritual, despite the low survival odds - a personal path none could dissuade.

The remaining three pills were reserved for emergencies or trades.

After Lantern Festival, estate manager Hu Youtian reported missing livestock and eerie hissing in Zhou Village, culminating in a villager's disappearance - reminiscent of the ghost fox incident, prompting requests for Qingfu Temple's help.

Zhou Qing deduced the python had come, likely targeting his well-fed livestock over lean spring prey. After winter starvation and injuries, the python would recuperate before seeking revenge. Possibly a demonic beast with an inner core enabling tracking, it required immediate attention.

Initial defenses proved ineffective as the python vanished again, presumably digesting. Zhou Qing knew warnings were useless before incidents - villagers only heeded visible threats. Now was damage control time.

Determining to scout the mountains alone with Morning Sun (Fusoong being occupied with his thunder ritual), Zhou Qing recognized even perfect planning might fail against the python's monstrous size and strength. Even his Gang Qi could barely penetrate its defenses, likely only enraging the creature. 

This python, cultivated to such potency, resisted even deadly poisons. Had it directly consumed the seven-leaf ginseng, only a Xiantian master could subdue it.

Reentering the wilderness, Zhou Qing felt a tiger returning to its domain - utterly confident against even a hundred soldiers, especially at night when he could become the hunter.

With Morning Sun flitting through branches like a golden pheasant and sunlight filtering through leaves, Zhou Qing grew tranquil, even feeling an urge to permanently return to nature - whether from Five Animals Play's influence or a cultivator's instinct.

Sensing the forest's dangers sharpened his awareness without fear, instead stirring a heroic spirit to contend with nature's perils. Cultivation was ultimately about wrestling fate from heaven.

Discovering fresh python trails, Zhou Qing became vigilant, leaping treetops for better vantage despite sparse foliage. His Shadowless Steps made him light as a crane while his surveying gaze remained tiger-like - this was his territory now.

Roaming like a tiger king, Zhou Qing's movements grew increasingly silent until spotting deer at a stream. The python's lightning strike on a fawn replayed, its terrifying speed emphasizing how poison and harassment had previously slowed it. 

Tracking the submerged red behemoth, Zhou Qing heard thunderous explosions ahead, leading to the unbelievable sight of the mad daoist battling the python barehanded with thunderous bone resonance.
