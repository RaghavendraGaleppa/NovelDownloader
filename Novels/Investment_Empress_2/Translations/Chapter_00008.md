# Chapter 8: His Vision Is Himself? The First Purple Destiny (1/2)

“He reached the top too?”

“If I weren’t barely standing myself, I’d suspect the Ascension Stone Stairs were broken!”

“But if he reached the top, why didn’t he cause any special commotion?”

“Who cares? He walked up so easily. His bone structure is definitely at least Grade C.”

The crowd was already buzzing with discussion.

Just now, Ying Bing had attracted a hundred birds paying homage, a grand spectacle indeed.

When Li Mo went up, however, there were no such strange phenomena.

“Impossible, absolutely impossible! He must have cheated!”

Wang Hu had tumbled down from the dozens of steps and was already dazed from the fall.

Seeing the shameless scoundrel who had ambushed him reach the top made him so angry his vision went black.

His back teeth were nearly ground to dust; he wished he could rush up and drag Li Mo down.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t even stand up right now.

“Cousin! This小子 is insidious and vicious, unworthy of becoming a disciple of the Clear Abyss Sect!”

“Shut up! The Elders will make the judgment!”

Wang Hao also felt it was humiliating, but he及时 interrupted his cousin’s unbridled rambling.

How that小子 was judged was a matter for the higher-ups.

They weren’t qualified to question the fairness of the Initiation Ceremony.

Of course, Wang Hao also felt that Li Mo must have used some other method.

The sect had records.

The Fifth Generation Sect Master of the Clear Abyss Sect had the vision of a silver river flowing straight down three thousand feet. The Sixteenth Generation Sect Master had summoned the revival of ten thousand trees.

Even the current Sect Master, Shangwen Cang, had the phenomenon of countless swords trembling and bowing.

Everyone who reached the top had an extraordinary aura manifested.

...

Unlike the众人 climbing the stone stairs, the high officials on the viewing platform had fallen silent.

They were all at least at the Observation of the Divine Realm, capable of seeing things the naked eye could not.

Thus, in their eyes, the少年 with the crow on his head did have a miraculous vision.

Behind him, there was a silhouette, its back to the myriad living beings.

That silhouette seemed plain and unremarkable, yet it was incredibly profound.

The fisherman by the riverbank... the scholar reading under a lamplight... the general stepping into the imperial court...

It was as if if one wasn't careful, the silhouette would change.

But when one came back to their senses, it returned to normal, still that锦衣翩翩的少年郎.

Li Mo’s silhouette?

On the Ascension Stone Stairs, it reflected himself?

This is a ghost!

The elders exchanged glances, seeing the absurdity and confusion in each other's eyes.

They had never imagined such a thing would happen.

But one thing was unquestionable.

This少年 was extraordinary.

“Since he has climbed the hundredth step, he can be a True Disciple. What do you all think?” Xue Jing calmly loosened his grip, tossing aside a beard hair he had accidentally pulled out.

“Agreed.”

“Hmm, I also think we should observe him.”

“But both of them have reached the hundredth step.”

Elder Han He put down his tea bowl and said hesitantly:

“The ancestral teachings state that the one who reaches the top is a candidate for Sect Master, to be cultivated as the future successor of Clear Abyss Mountain.”

“How can a sect accommodate two successors?”

The main issue was that such a situation had never occurred before, where two people reached the top simultaneously within a hundred years.

For a moment, all the elders looked at the Sect Master.

Shangwen Cang fell silent for a moment:

“Ying Bing shall be the Sect Master’s True Disciple. Li Mo shall be a True Disciple.”

Regarding this.

The elders didn't find it surprising.

One reflected an ordinary self.

The other reflected a noble and mysterious phoenix, like a secluded moon.

The latter clearly had more potential.

...

*Dong—*

A long bell toll echoed through the mountains.

The long incense in the giant bronze furnace burned out; an hour had passed.

Once the time was up, the youths on the platform relaxed their strength. Some were overjoyed, some remained calm, and others were filled with unwillingness.

But now, everything was settled.

In the second round, only about seven to eight hundred people actually remained to enter the Clear Abyss Sect.

The elders of the various peaks of the Clear Abyss Sect also descended from the high platform.

Shangwen Cang took a step forward, and the noisy field immediately fell silent.

“Those entering the Outer Sect, go to the Outer Court Affairs Hall to receive your waist tokens and miscellaneous items.”

“Those entering the Inner Sect may choose a peak to join. The functions and focuses of each peak differ, and the martial arts they specialize in are also different. You have three days to understand this.”

“Whether you join the Inner or Outer Sect, you must not slack off. You are all still young, and the world is not yet decided.”

The Sect Master’s voice carried a natural, intimidating power.

Li Mo looked towards the elders and was slightly stunned.

Xue Jing was blinking at him.

*Oh...*

Li Mo had been curious before how a barefoot doctor from a medical clinic could拿出 the Pure Yang Pill.

“Ying Bing is a True Disciple and shall enter my sect.”

Shangwen Cang said again.

The众人 who hadn't left yet had long expected this, but they still couldn't help but be mentally shaken.

To be accepted as a disciple by the Sect Master of the Clear Abyss Sect, Shangwen Cang!

Crossing the Ascension Stone Stairs, one step to the sky.

Just moments ago, they were all接受 the Initiation Ceremony together. In the blink of an eye, their fates were as different as heaven and earth. Nothing illustrates the unpredictability of life better than this.

“Li Mo, Lin Jiang, and Mu Rongxiao also have the potential to be True Disciples.”

“Is there any Elder willing to accept a disciple?”

---

True Disciples were also a limited resource.

Each Elder could accept at most five True Disciples.

“Unfortunately, my sect is already full.”

“Lin Jiang, you have the Mantis Legs, Magpie Shoulders, and Green Snake Spine. I specialize in long weapons. Are you willing to follow me?”

“Tsk tsk tsk, this小子 Mu Rongxiao is quite good, actually possessing the bloodline of an auspicious beast. A good seed!”

Lin Jiang was quickly accepted by an Elder.

Mu Rongxiao even sparked a competition among three Elders and eventually became a disciple under Elder Han He.

“These two.”

Li Mo was also observing them.

【Name: Lin Jiang】
【Age: 16】
【Bone Structure: Mantis Legs, Green Snake Spine, Magpie Shoulders】
【Realm: 4th Meridian of the Qi and Blood Realm.】
【Destiny: Blue】
【Evaluation: This person's talent is acceptable, but he is eager for quick success and instant benefit. A rigid character is prone to break. If he awakens in time, he may still reach a higher level.】
【Recent Encounter: Having just become a True Disciple of the Clear Abyss Sect, he wants a weapon above the 'Sharp' grade.】

...

【Name: Mu Rongxiao.】
【Age: 16.】
【Bone Structure: Roaring Flood Dragon Body.】
【Realm: 5th Meridian of the Qi and Blood Realm.】
【Destiny: Blue.】
【Evaluation: His father is human, his mother a transformed flood dragon. His nature is kind but heavily influenced by his bloodline. If he can combine the advantages of both, his future is limitless; if he combines the disadvantages, he will bring disaster to an area.】
【Recent Encounter: Suppressing his instincts for a long time, hoping to calm the嗜血 nature in his bones.】

*Hiss...*

Li Mo lightly吸了口凉气.

I thought he possessed the bloodline of an auspicious beast?

Father is human, mother is a flood dragon?

Mu Rongxiao’s father is a狠人啊; even Xu Xian would have to serve him tea.

He silently memorized where the two had gone.

“By the way, what about me?”

Li Mo snapped back to reality and found the elders looking at him with somewhat difficult expressions.

“This child’s talent is excellent, but how should we teach him?”

This was what all the elders were thinking simultaneously.

For a moment, the field fell silent.

Suddenly, a lazy voice broke the silence:

“小子, *hic*... are you willing to become my disciple?”

Li Mo looked in the direction of the voice.

He saw a woman in palace attire standing there, hands on her hips, trying hard to look serious and dignified.

Her features were dignified and magnificent, and her loose palace attire couldn't hide her惊人 figure.

Standing there, she was like a peony blooming wildly.

“Naturally.”

Li Mo didn't hesitate for long and performed a salute.

“This... Senior Sister Shang Wu...”

Xue Jing was stunned and wanted to say something.

But Shang Wu斜 him a threatening look and clenched her slender,粉 fist.

“Ah, it's also excellent to become her disciple. From now on, you'll be the only seedling of the Ninth Peak.”

Xue Jing followed suit, his face changing at lightning speed.

“Greetings, Master.”

Li Mo stepped forward to pay his respects, feeling strange.

Why did the elders look at him with a hint of sympathy?

He couldn't help but use his Destiny Divine Eye.

【Name: Shang Wu.】
【Age: 27.】
【Bone Structure: South Ming Fire Lotus Body.】
【Realm: 7th Heaven of the Inner Scenery Realm.】
【Destiny: Purple.】
【Evaluation: The youngest elder of the Clear Abyss Sect. You can doubt her character, but please do not doubt her strength. She possesses an extraordinary origin.】
【Recent Encounter: Out of money for alcohol, currently thinking about how to squeeze some silver from the elders of other peaks. She is very interested in the Sect Master's True Disciple, Ying Bing.】

Li Mo: “?”

No wonder the高层的眼神 were all strange.

By all appearances, Shang Wu wasn't a good master.

And... so it wasn't because of his extraordinary bones that he was accepted, but because she was interested in Ying Bing?

Those evaluations...

Made Li Mo doubt the value of a Purple Destiny.

“After all, it's the first time I've encountered a Purple one.”

“It's fine if I can't learn anything. There's bound to be investment returns.”

Thinking this, Li Mo relaxed.

“Hmph hmph, from now on, you're under my protection. If you're outside, just报 my name.”

Shang Wu slapped his shoulder, as if she were摸骨 for him again.

Li Mo吸了口凉气; her grip was really strong.

Not far away.

Ying Bing, who had already accepted a master, watched the woman in palace attire and the无奈少年.

“So she entered Shang Wu's sect...”

Ying Bing微不可察的 nodded.

If Li Mo could learn even a fraction of Shang Wu's true skills, he might be able to hold a place among his peers in the Ziyang Prefecture.

Of course, in the Eastern Wilderness Domain, he wouldn't be considered a genius and likely wouldn't be able to登上 the system's rankings.

“Four True Disciples in one session. Our Clear Abyss Sect is bound to prosper.”

“Come, follow this old man to handle the entry procedures.”

The short, fat elder looked at the几个人 with a beaming smile.
