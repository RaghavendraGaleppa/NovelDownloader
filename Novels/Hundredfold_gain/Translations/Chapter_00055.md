# Chapter 55: All Achieved Mid-Grade, Cultivating the Clear Spirit Eyes

Gazing at the brand-new mid-grade Fireball Talisman he had just drawn on the stone table, a look of astonishment appeared in Qi Chuan's eyes.

"Generally speaking, using low-grade spirit ink and low-grade talisman paper to draw a mid-grade talisman isn't impossible, but the success rate is extremely low—it's very difficult to achieve."

"Who would have thought my luck would be this good? I actually managed to accomplish this without even realizing it..."

After some thought, Qi Chuan attributed it to the high-grade spirit brush.

After all, using a high-grade spirit brush to draw low-grade talismans was somewhat overkill.

To some extent, it could be said to have counterbalanced the negative effects brought by the low-grade spirit ink and talisman paper.

Moreover, before this, after drawing dozens of low-grade Fireball Talismans—enhanced by the multiplier effect of his golden finger—his talisman-making skills had been continuously improving within the low-grade tier, gradually approaching the level of a mid-grade talisman master.

Under these circumstances, further amplified by the hundredfold boost from his golden finger, he directly succeeded in drawing a mid-grade Fireball Talisman, thereby advancing to the rank of a mid-grade talisman master.

"I truly never expected that just days after obtaining the first-tier talisman-making legacy, I've already reached the level of a mid-grade talisman master!"

"Could it be that I actually have a talent for talisman-making? Otherwise, even with the golden finger's multiplier effect, progress shouldn't have been this fast."

With this thought, Qi Chuan couldn't help but stroke his chin, privately musing that he must be a talisman-making prodigy.

After all, for ordinary people, even becoming a low-grade talisman master was quite challenging, let alone a mid-grade one.

It required extensive practice with large amounts of talisman paper and spirit ink, even wearing out many spirit brushes in the process—consuming vast resources before achieving success.

And after becoming a low-grade talisman master, it would still take a considerable amount of time to recoup the costs of those practice materials through talisman sales.

And that was just for low-grade talisman masters.

As for him?

He had only used one bottle of low-grade spirit ink, a few dozen sheets of low-grade talisman paper, and a few days' time.

Moreover, he hadn't just reached low-grade—he had achieved mid-grade.

If other low-grade talisman masters found out, they'd probably be furious.

"Now that I've mastered the Fireball Talisman at the mid-grade level, I might as well bring the Water Arrow Talisman and other talismans up to speed."

"With the foundation of the mid-grade Fireball Talisman, improving these other talismans should be much easier."

After his breakthrough with the Fireball Talisman, Qi Chuan turned his attention to the others.

---

He took out another sheet of talisman paper and began drawing.

This time, however, it wasn't a Fireball Talisman—it was a Water Arrow Talisman.

[You successfully drew a low-grade Water Arrow Talisman, triggering a 30x multiplier. You gained 30x the rewards, and your experience and skill in drawing Water Arrow Talismans improved slightly.]

Soon, words appeared before Qi Chuan's eyes once more.

...

Over the next ten days, Qi Chuan divided his time between cultivating with the Evergreen Technique to refine his cultivation and practicing the remaining four basic elemental talismans, including the Water Arrow Talisman.

As a result, not only did his skills in drawing these four talismans improve rapidly, but his spiritual energy also continued to grow steadily.

After all, in the world of cultivation, one's own strength was always the top priority.

No matter what, Qi Chuan would never neglect his cultivation progress.

During this period, he also found time to visit the Alchemy Pavilion, handing over the two Black Jade Serpent Gallbladders he had obtained to the alchemists there to refine into Black Jade Restoration Pills.

The Alchemy Pavilion also offered alchemical services. If inner disciples provided their own materials, the cost would be significantly lower.

Although Black Jade Serpent Gallbladders could be stored for a relatively long time, Qi Chuan felt it was best to refine them as soon as possible for Second Uncle, resolving his minor meridian issues earlier rather than later.

Ten days later.

Qi Chuan sat at the stone table, holding the Mystic Elephant Spirit Brush. As the brush tip traced the final stroke on a sheet of talisman paper, completing the Wood Vine Talisman's formation, the entire array became seamless.

Immediately, Qi Chuan formed hand seals, channeling wisps of spiritual energy into the formation. Soon, the infusion of energy was successfully completed.

At the same time, another line of text appeared before his eyes:

[You successfully drew a mid-grade Wood Vine Talisman, triggering a 28x multiplier. You gained 28x the rewards, and your experience and skill in drawing Wood Vine Talismans improved slightly.]

At the same time, new insights into drawing Wood Vine Talismans surfaced in his mind.

After absorbing these insights, the text before his eyes gradually faded.

"Finally, I've mastered the Wood Vine Talisman—the last of the five basic elemental talismans—at the mid-grade level."

Qi Chuan smiled faintly as he picked up the mid-grade Wood Vine Talisman from the table.

Like before, this talisman had been drawn using low-grade spirit ink and talisman paper.

Now, Qi Chuan had mastered all five basic elemental talismans—Fireball, Water Arrow, and the others—at the mid-grade level. He could draw any of them at will.

---

During this period, he had exhausted three bottles of low-grade spirit ink and a hundred sheets of low-grade talisman paper, necessitating a resupply from the Alchemy Pavilion.

"However, advancing from a mid-grade to a high-grade talisman master will likely be more troublesome and take a bit more time. So, I'll take talisman-making slowly—I can't expect to jump to high-grade overnight."

Qi Chuan thought to himself.

"Ah, right—I still haven't practiced the Clear Spirit Eyes. This kind of vision technique is best mastered early; it could be incredibly useful in critical moments."

He retrieved the manual for the Clear Spirit Eyes and began studying it carefully.

He recalled the second bandit who had been tailing him during his last outing.

From his vague senses, that bandit had been slightly stronger than him—likely at the sixth level of Qi Refining.

Though someone of that strength could easily be crushed with a talisman treasure if they attacked, the fact that he could only vaguely sense their presence—without being able to see their form or exact hiding spot—left Qi Chuan unsettled.

After all, what if the next hidden assailant was even stronger?

"I hope mastering the Clear Spirit Eyes won't be too difficult..."

Qi Chuan murmured softly as he flipped through the manual, reading intently.

[You diligently studied the Clear Spirit Eyes, attempting to grasp its basics. Triggering a 19x multiplier, you gained 19x the rewards, and your understanding of the Clear Spirit Eyes improved slightly.]

Soon after finishing his reading, text appeared before his eyes.

New comprehension of the Clear Spirit Eyes emerged in his mind.

"So, the initial stage of mastering the Clear Spirit Eyes doesn't require any medicinal aids—it just involves channeling spiritual energy into the eyes in a specific pattern. However, after the basics are mastered, some medicinal assistance might be necessary."

After digesting this understanding, Qi Chuan muttered to himself.

Since the foundational stage only required manipulating spiritual energy, with his hundredfold multiplier, the process should be relatively straightforward.
