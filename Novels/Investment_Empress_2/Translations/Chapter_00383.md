# Chapter 383: I Don't Care! Breaking the Trap! Special Effects Bombardment

While creating spectacular and dazzling special effects, Li Mo was also pondering a question. Although he had helped the Demonic Cult unravel the game board because of the 'Dream God' who seemed to have targeted Bing Da Zi, helping the Demonic Cult retrieve their ancestral god was likely a crime.

The Great Yu Dynasty's laws explicitly prohibited participating in or engaging in demonic cult activities.

Of course, the law was one thing.

Li Mo did not want to aid a tyrant.

"Seven columns, twelve rows, what wicked scheme are you plotting now?"

Ying Bing quietly guided his moves while sensing that Little Li seemed to have a bold idea.

"What do you mean 'again'?"

Li Mo coughed lightly and explained in his heart: "Given the deep connection with the Demonic Cult, the Dream God is probably not a benevolent existence. If we allow it to return to the Demonic Cult, wouldn't that just fuel their arrogance? Moreover, after its return, it might use the Demonic Cult's power against you."

"What do you want to do?"

"There are usually two best ways to solve any problem."

Li Mo held the Shen Ling Divine Pearl, exuding an air of profound mystery just like Bing Da Zi.

"Which two?"

"First, solve the person who created the problem. But this Dream God has an extraordinary origin. If we fight it head-on, we might be the ones getting solved..."

Li Mo shook his head and placed a piece according to Bing Da Zi's guidance.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and pondered for a moment before nodding slightly. She knew that the one currently online wasn't the childish Li Mo, but the reliable Li Mo.

"And the second?"

"The second is to make a big scene!"

"?"

"As long as we let more people know that an extraordinary legacy has appeared in the Broken Axe Mountain, it will definitely attract the attention of the powerful figures from the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Even if we want to enter the Broken Axe Mountain, it will be much safer."

"If that's the case, the things inside the legacy..."

"I don't care!"

Li Mo's answer was firm and without hesitation. As long as Bing Da Zi was safe and sound, why bother with those trivial treasures?

"......."

Ying Bing's cold eyes trembled slightly, like the reflection of the moon in a rippling well. She did indeed want to explore the Broken Axe Mountain. But for her, what mattered wasn't those external objects, but the root cause of the Ying family's destruction.

"Then I'll cause some trouble with you once more..."

She picked up a white piece with her slender fingers.

At the same time, a thousand miles away, Li Mo also made his move. The two of them placed their pieces on their respective boards at the exact same moment.

*Clack—*

The sound was crisp and pleasant.

In the sky, the pure white fish-dragon of Qi bit the neck of the black fish-dragon of Turbid Qi. Countless divine intentions swept through the area. The eyes of the skeletons shone brightly with spiritual energy, and a sense of relief and liberation arose within them.

"What a layout, what a calculation, what a move!"

"I never thought I would see this game resolved after death. I die without regret."

"To be reborn from the dead, what I lacked back then was determination!"

One skeleton after another bowed deeply toward Li Mo, then their spiritual energy completely dissipated. Li Mo returned the bow, then stood with his hands behind his back.

The group of powerful figures lowered their heads in deference. He stood atop the game board, his blue robe fluttering in the wind, truly like a banished immortal descending to the world! The coldness in his eyes remained as always, as if he had just done something effortless.

"The one who set up this board still needs more practice."

He plays so fast!

His pose is so cool!

And he can even manually add special effects to himself.

Who wouldn't be dazzled by this?

---

Luo Yexian's scalp tingled. Who else could be the one who set up the board but their ancestral god? What did his brother Heitu mean? Dream God, you still need to practice! This was completely speaking to him as an equal.

"The trap that has lasted for thousands of years has finally been broken..."

Tan Zhuyin, the Demonic Cult's Holy Son, trembled with excitement, his mind filled with ecstasy. In an instant, he seemed to see many scenes: him obtaining the legacy, him returning to the top of the潜龙 list and crushing Jiang Yu beneath his foot, and him entering the Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect and becoming an existence like the Immortal Heitu...

"Immortal, this is a small token of my gratitude, please accept it."

Tan Zhuyin didn't hesitate to take out a statue of an Eight-Armed Bodhisattva. The thick power of the common people coiling around it was almost tangible. Although it was very impure, after being purified by the Empty Bright Ten Thousand Colors Pagoda, a considerable amount should remain. The Holy Son felt a pang of pain, but compared to the legacy left by the Dream God, what were a few drops of the power of the common people? Besides, he didn't think he could get away with owing this person a debt.

"This big nephew is quite sensible."

Li Mo waved his sleeve and put the statue away, then slowly said, "Since that's the case, I'll give you another piece of advice: it's best not to enter this legacy site for the time being."

"?"

Tan Zhuyin was taken aback.

Just as the words fell.

*Rumble—*

A earth-shaking commotion suddenly came, as if heaven and earth were turning over, the world was being inverted, like a natural disaster descending upon the world!

"This is..."

"This game board is connected to the Broken Axe Mountain Range. It has accumulated the spiritual煞 energy for thousands of years to prevent outsiders from entering. Now that the game is broken, the sealed spiritual煞 energy will naturally return to the heavens and earth. Even if I wanted to explore it, I wouldn't choose this moment."

"How... how long will the spiritual煞 energy take to disperse?"

The Demonic Cult's Holy Son's expression changed.

"Until after the New Year at the earliest."

Because Little Li wanted to have a good New Year. In fact, the spiritual煞 energy could dissipate today. But Li Mo planned to use special effects to maintain it and add some extra ingredients to it...

Now, Tan Zhuyin no longer doubted what Li Mo said. He frowned and said, "By then, if others are attracted, there will be more variables."

"This place was left by your cult's ancestral god. Hasn't He awakened? Why are you afraid of others snatching it?"

"That... makes sense."

Li Mo nodded. Seeing that dawn was approaching, he found a random excuse to take his leave. Luo Yexian quickly asked Tan Zhuyin to see his uncle off. Before Tan Zhuyin could recover from his shock, Li Mo had already used the Somersault Cloud and 'whooshed' away.

"He is truly a figure among gods and immortals."

Luo Yexian clicked his tongue in wonder. "By the way, you might meet your aunt next time. Your aunt is even more of a celestial beauty, making all the beauties on the Hundred Flowers List look dull in comparison."

"Oh? How does she compare to Ying Bing?"

"They each have their own unique charm."

"So she's not a woman of the mortal world..."

...

Li Mo returned to Qinghe County that very day and threw the Eight-Armed Bodhisattva statue into the Empty Bright Ten Thousand Colors Pagoda to be refined. Then, every morning, he had a new task: to go to the Broken Axe Mountain and put on a special effects bombardment. Bing Da Zi acted as his special effects consultant.

On the first day, celestial flowers rained from the sky.

On the second day, golden lotuses sprouted from the ground.

On the third day, a purple aura arrived from the east.

All sorts of phenomena were like setting off fireworks, and they weren't repeated day after day. If the Dream God were truly awake, it would probably doubt whether it was still dreaming.

Damn, baby, was I originally this awesome?
