# Chapter 24: Gathering of Prodigies, The Prodigy List!

Prodigy Camp!

Three large characters seemed carved onto the entrance itself.

Su Yu and Bai Zhan slowly descended from the vehicle. Su Yu gazed at the colossal building before him, utterly captivated.

"How about it? Our Prodigy Camp isn't bad, is it?" Bai Zhan said with a chuckle.

Su Yu nodded. To be honest, he had never seen such a magnificent structure before. In Heng City, most buildings were small, nothing particularly impressive.

"Alright, for the next two or three months, you'll be living here. You'll have plenty of time to get acquainted. Now, follow me!"

"I reckon those little rascals are getting impatient!" Bai Zhan said with a smile, leading Su Yu into the Prodigy Camp.

Just entering the Prodigy Camp, Su Yu felt countless gazes lock onto him. It was as if any inappropriate move on his part would result in a severe blow.

"These are the auras of some of the powerful individuals in the Prodigy Camp. As long as you don't violate the camp's rules, there won't be any problems," Bai Zhan explained with a smile.

Su Yu nodded, then followed closely behind Bai Zhan, slowly making his way deeper into the Prodigy Camp. After an unknown amount of time, they passed through building after building.

Suddenly, a bald man roared, his voice laced with a faint trace of spiritual energy. The assembled youths all turned to look at the middle-aged man, involuntarily straightening their backs. Then, they quickly formed a single file line.

Su Yu stood quietly at the back of the crowd, sensing the numerous prodigies before him. His heart couldn't help but churn with waves of shock. This was because, among this group, there were a good seven or eight cultivators in the Blood Refinement Realm alone. As for the rest, even the weakest had a vitality of five or higher!

"Is this the caliber of prodigies from the entire Jiangnan Province? Truly monstrous!"

"If Jiangnan Province is like this, then looking at the entire country, wouldn't those top-tier prodigies be even more terrifying?"

Upon this thought, Su Yu's eyes filled with battle intent. Su Yu never felt himself to be weaker than anyone. Given enough time and with the system's help, surpassing this group was merely a matter of time.

"You are all geniuses from various parts of Jiangnan. Among you, there are those in the Blood Refinement Realm and those in the Vitality Realm. But the moment you step into the Prodigy Camp, you are no longer geniuses."

"You... only have one name!"

"Rookies!"

"Combat! Within the Prodigy Camp, there's an Illusion Tower. For every floor you clear, you'll earn corresponding points. Breaking a record will directly grant you ten thousand points!" As he spoke, a peculiar smile appeared on the bald man's face.

"Let me specifically tell you, the Illusion Tower has a total of one hundred floors. To this day, the highest record stands at eighty-nine floors. I hope someone in this batch can break that record!"

Someone curiously asked, "Instructor, who set that record?"

A hint of pride appeared on the bald man's face. "Naturally, it's the current Marquis-ranked expert, Marquis Saint Spear!"

"Hiss, it's a Marquis-ranked expert? Does that mean if we can reach the eighty-ninth floor, we'll be able to become powerful experts like Marquis Saint Spear in the future?"
