# Chapter 572: Hand Over the True Sutra

He took a step forward, and the Profound Yin Qi within him surged violently, forming a churning mass of ink-black mist that brought with it a bone-piercing chill.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained placid. He simply looked calmly at Zhao Moyang, a faint trace of mockery in his eyes, and said nothing.

Seeing this, Zhao Moyang did not grow angry. Both were Foundation Establishment true cultivators with extraordinary mental fortitude; how could they easily have their emotions provoked by others?

He continued, "The Divine霄 Nine Firmaments Profound Void Indestructible Sutra is the manifestation of an empty Dao Fruit from the Thunder Path. It naturally carries the imprints of the Thunder Great Dao's laws. What is even rarer is that all past karma has been completely severed and stripped away, turning it into a blank slate with no owner. How could such a true method be fitting for a mere mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator like you to possess?"

Zhao Moyang’s voice suddenly rose, filled with unparalleled greed and scorching desire.

Xu Yunfan was speechless. He smiled and said, "I was wondering what this was about. It turns out you want to learn the Divine霄 Sutra. Senior Brother Zhao, if you had just said so earlier. Tomorrow, I’ll set up a disciple-accepting ceremony on Divine霄 Peak. If you bow and kowtow to me three times and nine times to become my disciple, in my joy, I will surely accept you. Who knows, I might even teach you the Divine霄 true method."

Zhao Moyang chuckled. The words spoken by the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect were far more profound and harsh than this. He had grown calloused from hearing them along the way. Xu Yunfan’s words were still quite mild, and he didn't react much to them.

Xu Yunfan said this, then swept his gaze over the few of them, his expression somewhat ambiguous as he said, "Why go to such great lengths? Even if you get it, how will the three of you divide it?"

Sun Qishan said, "How we divide it is none of your concern."

Zhao Moyang said, "Today, you will hand it over whether you want to or not. Otherwise, this place will be your burial ground. That nascent洞天 of yours would be just right for us to refine into our lifebound magic treasures."

With these words, the mask was completely torn off. They clearly intended to strip Xu Yunfan of everything.

Killing someone in another界 Heaven, the karma of the Taihua Lingxu World would not be able to trace it.

Leng Yuehua remained silent, the small green bamboo sword circling her body already humming and trembling, locking onto Xu Yunfan's vital points.

Sun Qishan grinned, revealing his white teeth in a ferocious smile. He drew the black giant axe from behind his back, an axe wider than a door panel. Fierce and violent demonic energy shot into the sky. The blood-colored patterns on the axe lit up, exuding a thirst for blood.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes slightly.

The Divine霄 Nine Firmaments Profound Void Indestructible Sutra was the fundamental true method for his Golden Core Dao path. It was also something that cultivated in tandem with his Dao Foundation, linked to his very life. How could he hand it over?

He instantly understood that it must have been from the previous battle with Nezha. When he had不惜代价 (spared no cost) to trigger the core lightning power of the array, the aura of this empty Dao Fruit could not be completely concealed. It was ultimately seen through by these fellow sect true cultivators with their profound cultivation and sharp eyesight.

He hadn't expected them to form an alliance in such a short breath, and they were exceptionally proficient in this kind of work.

In this Heavenly Battlefield, far from the jurisdiction of the sect, where the strong prey on the weak, the fellowship of fellow disciples with their masks torn off is even more deadly than foreign demons.

Truly worthy of being from the Primordial Origin Sect; each and every one of them is vicious in their thinking.

In the depths of his sea of consciousness, his soul operated at its limit, rapidly deducing strategies to escape or even counter-kill.

Just at this critical moment, when the killing intent in the standoff was almost condensing into a tangible storm...

"Buzz!"

A terrifying pressure, more condensed, more overbearing, and more unquestionable than the aftershocks of the battle between the True Lord of Qingyuan and the Heavenly Emperor, descended upon this heaven and earth like an invisible ancient divine mountain.

Time seemed to freeze instantly.

Leng Yuehua, who was about to activate her green bamboo sword, stiffened abruptly.

Sun Qishan, who was grinning as he raised his giant axe, had the expression on his face frozen.

Even Zhao Moyang, whose aura was locked onto Xu Yunfan, flashed with undisguised horror and panic in his eyes.

Everyone couldn't help but look up at the sky.

Above the shattered high heavens, beside the clashing lights of the True Lord of Qingyuan and the Heavenly Emperor, a pure, ultimate, seemingly all-destroying dark golden brilliance quietly lit up.

The light was not dazzling, but it carried a supreme majesty that saw through all things and controlled life and death.

Within the dark golden halo, the figure of an old man in a grey cloth robe, with a slightly stooped figure, appeared silently.

This old man had an ordinary, even somewhat withered, appearance, holding an unremarkable, yellowish and mottled withered wooden cane in his hand.

Just by standing there, all the chaotic and violent energy storms around him—whether the immeasurable clear qi of the True Lord of Qingyuan, the majestic imperial might of the Heavenly Emperor, or the residual Buddhist light and shattered sword qi—all flowed around him like gentle streams, daring not to offend him in the slightest.

True Lord Pudu.

The only True Lord at the late-stage Golden Core of the Primordial Origin Sect, and the ultimate commander of this Heaven's offensive.

No sooner had True Lord Pudu appeared than he lightly tapped the void with that withered wooden cane in his hand.

"Buzz!"

Without any visible exertion, an unremarkable dark golden ripple, seemingly containing the principles of endless time flow and the birth and destruction of all things, spread out silently and instantly swept across the entire high heaven battlefield.

The Heavenly Emperor, who was fighting the True Lord of Qingyuan to a stalemate and drawing upon the suppression of the entire Heavenly Dao's laws, had his merit-protected imperial body tremble violently. His majestic imperial might, as if encountering an invisible barrier, actually showed a hint of stagnation.

The imperial might that could crush mountains and rivers suddenly slowed in its flow before this seemingly simple dark golden ripple, as if it had fallen into a sticky quagmire of time.

True Lord Pudu's stooped figure did not swell, but a phantom of an infinite world naturally reflected behind him.

In that phantom, stars were born and destroyed, seas turned to mulberry fields, and sentient beings multiplied and withered away. It was grand and immense, filling the cosmos with its will.

This Dharma Form was not illusory, but rather the projection of his Dao Realm brought about by his late Golden Core cultivation, where his own洞天 (Heavenly Cave) did not fall and had already begun to gradually evolve into a world.

"Qingyuan, this creature's roots have been blessed by the laws of this world. Join forces and slay it quickly. Do not get entangled in a protracted battle."

True Lord Pudu's voice was calm and ancient, as if he were discussing a trivial matter like slaughtering a chicken.

In True Lord Pudu's eyes, it was indeed a trivial matter. After all, with tens of thousands of years of cultivation, he had conquered too many界 Heavens.

Even if this界 Heaven had multiple Dao Fruits, before a True Lord at the late Golden Core stage...

One could only say, a grain of rice dares to shine?

The True Lord of Qingyuan's eyes flashed with brilliance as he let out a sharp shout.

"Good!"

The clear qi around him surged suddenly. The Ten Thousand Swords of the Clear World, which he had evolved, merged into one. With this powerful aid, the edge of that sword of judgment suddenly increased by ten percent. The sword momentum, which was originally being resisted by the Heavenly Emperor borrowing the Dao Fruit and the might of the heavens, suddenly tore through everything and slashed fiercely toward the Heavenly Emperor's true body like a tear in the sky.

The Heavenly Emperor's Dharma body, which was ten thousand zhangs of clear light, trembled violently, and for the first time, a look of furious shock appeared on his face.

A single True Lord of Qingyuan was already enough to be on par with him. Now, add another True Lord whose aura was far more profound and ancient than Qingyuan's, and whose Dao Realm projection was as heavy as the sky collapsing.

The Heavenly Emperor position he was so proud of, under the joint erosion of these two True Lords from the Taihua Lingxu World, began to waver.

"Dev!"

True Lord Pudu no longer looked at the Heavenly Emperor. His withered wooden cane pointed directly west.

A dark golden light at the tip of the cane suddenly lit up, crossing an endless space in an instant.
