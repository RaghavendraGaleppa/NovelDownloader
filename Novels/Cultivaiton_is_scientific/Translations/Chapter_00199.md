# Chapter 199: Resolution  

Li Shiming knew something was amiss the moment the defensive formation was tampered with via the control token. He swiftly suppressed the spiritual energy within his body, gradually ending his cultivation of the *Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique*.  

Fortunately, thanks to the precautions he had taken, he had a few extra moments to react. Otherwise, with the formation forcibly deactivated during his cultivation, he would have been exposed without any chance to defend himself.  

Anger surged within him. Had he not believed this place to be utterly secure, he would never have chosen to cultivate his primary technique here. After all, forcibly interrupting such cultivation carried the risk of qi deviation.  

By the time he ended his practice, the defensive formation outside had been completely breached.  

Li Shiming sensed the auras of four mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, along with the presence of an isolation formation.  

*"This is a targeted plot!"* he immediately realized.  

This was at the foot of the Shushan Sect's mountain. Any inn daring to operate here should have guaranteed the safety of its guests.  

His first thought was of the token he carried. He recalled how Xu Chuan had been ambushed shortly after entering the Hundred Thousand Mountains. It seemed someone didn’t want him to meet Elder Su.  

*"Since you want to play games, then let’s make this a spectacle!"* A plan formed in his mind.  

This place was special. Even if he had the ability to kill mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, he wouldn’t recklessly attack here. If he were accused of initiating an assault, the consequences would be severe.  

His thoughts flashed by in an instant. His body crashed through the wall behind him—now that the formation was gone, the courtyard walls were as flimsy as paper to a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Li Shiming’s retreat put distance between himself and the four assailants.  

The four mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators weren’t concerned. Their formation disk had already sealed the area, making escape impossible.  

But they didn’t know they were facing a high-level formation master—one whose computational abilities far surpassed those of ordinary formation masters.  

Li Shiming’s spiritual sense swept over the isolation formation. While such formations were troublesome for those unfamiliar with formations, to a high-level formation master, it was like a college student solving elementary school problems.  

Of course, solving it still took time—time that depended on the formation master’s skill.  

As he retreated, five spirit stones appeared in Li Shiming’s hand. IBMz15 had already analyzed the formation’s energy pathways through his spiritual sense.  

He flung the five spirit stones into the formation, each landing on a critical node. The formation disk couldn’t account for such an abrupt disruption, instantly losing control.  

The isolation formation shattered, leaving nothing between Li Shiming and the four cultivators.  

*"Demonic sect cultivators have infiltrated! They’ve colluded with the inn to assassinate guests!"* Li Shiming amplified his voice with *Words Like Blossoms*, ensuring it echoed throughout Guan Mountain Town.  

At the same time, the standoff between the five Foundation Establishment cultivators became visible to all.  

With the isolation formation gone, the four mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators were caught off guard, their auras flaring as they prepared to attack. Li Shiming, facing four opponents, also had no choice but to unleash his full power.  

*"Where are the demonic sect cultivators?"* The quickest to react were the Shushan Sect disciples. Regardless of rank, they all rushed toward the inn.  

To sect disciples, the appearance of demonic sect cultivators was a direct challenge to the Shushan Sect—one that demanded retribution, even at the cost of their lives.  

Other cultivators followed. Their livelihoods depended on Guan Mountain Town’s safety, making this their concern as well.  

Thus, the inn’s courtyard became the scene of an absurd spectacle. The "Four Tigers of Liew Mountain" had just expended their energy breaking the defensive formation, preparing for a second assault, when their own isolation formation failed.  

Before they could act, Li Shiming’s shout drew a crowd.  

The situation spoke for itself. Four mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators surrounding a courtyard, with a formation disk beside them—anyone could see what was happening.  

Could anyone believe that a lone early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator had invited four mid-stage experts and set up a formation disk in advance?  

*"A misunderstanding! These four seniors are guests of the inn—they must have taken the wrong path!"* The innkeeper stepped forward, bowing and offering excuses.  

*"What a convenient ‘misunderstanding’!"* Li Shiming scoffed. *"The defensive formation of my courtyard conveniently opened for these four demonic sect cultivators. How many guests have been murdered here in secret?"*  

His words sent chills through the crowd. This wasn’t just about demonic sect cultivators—it implicated sect members in the conspiracy.  

A formation expert among the crowd inspected the courtyard’s formation. When he looked up at the innkeeper, his gaze had turned icy.  

The Four Tigers of Liew Mountain didn’t dare move. Over a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators were present, and the Shushan Sect would surely intervene. Even if they could fight their way out, where would they go? The sect’s pursuit would be relentless.  

With the formation expert’s confirmation, no one was fooled. The innkeeper was clearly involved.  

Some sensed deeper machinations, but most were outraged. Regardless of Li Shiming’s identity, assassinations in Guan Mountain Town threatened everyone’s interests.  

The town’s safety was its selling point. Many cultivators worked hard to earn spirit stones just to rent a room here for cultivation breakthroughs. If the inn’s security was compromised, who would come?  

*"I bear a token from True Disciple Xu Chuan, here to meet Elder Su. The arrangements were already made with the town’s overseers!"* Li Shiming raised the token high, amplifying his voice with spiritual energy.  

The crowd’s expressions darkened. The inn had conspired with outsiders to assassinate a true disciple’s messenger—this was no small matter.  

The Four Tigers nearly wet themselves. They hadn’t known this involved a Golden Core elder—one who could crush them effortlessly.  

Their only hope was True Disciple Ji, but they dared not speak.  

*"I demand to see Elder Su! Can anyone here relay my message? I’m certain Elder Su will be grateful. Of course, you may choose not to—but then, how will Elder Su view your involvement?"*  

His words struck a chord. Regardless of the details, an attack on a true disciple’s messenger had occurred in Guan Mountain Town. If they ignored it after being reminded, they risked being seen as complicit.  

Sect disciples silently activated their identity tokens to report to the sect. Even if they couldn’t contact Sky Eye Peak directly, they had to inform the sect of the situation.  

Just then, six Foundation Establishment auras approached—a crimson flying vessel descended.  

*"The sect’s enforcement team!"* someone exclaimed.  

*"Four Tigers of Liew Mountain! You dare attack a true disciple’s messenger? Surrender now!"* the team leader barked.  

A subtle hand signal passed between the leader and the Four Tigers, who immediately relaxed, submitting to arrest.  

Four sets of spirit shackles—artifacts that sealed spiritual seas—locked them in place.  

*"Disperse! This matter is under our jurisdiction,"* the leader ordered.  

The crowd began to scatter, but Li Shiming saw everything—the signal, the Four Tigers’ reaction. The forces opposing Xu Chuan were formidable indeed.  

*"You violated town rules by engaging in combat. Come with us for questioning. Rest assured, we’re fair,"* the leader said coolly.  

*"How convenient that the enforcement team was already waiting outside,"* Li Shiming retorted, his voice carrying.  

Many had noticed the suspicious timing. The enforcement team wasn’t stationed here—they should have taken much longer to arrive from the sect.  

But this involved true disciples and a Golden Core elder. No one dared interfere.  

*"Resist, and we’ll execute you on the spot,"* the leader growled.  

In truth, his team had been meant to clean up, not intervene directly. But True Disciple Ji had issued strict orders.  

Arresting Li Shiming meant provoking Elder Su—a figure whose influence rivaled Elder Ji’s. The leader was stepping into a viper’s nest.  

*"Let’s see you try."* A calm voice cut through the tension, carrying an aura of absolute authority.  

*"E-Elder Su!"* The leader paled.  

*"You’ve gone to great lengths to block my guest,"* Elder Su said icily.  

The enforcement team dropped to their knees, silent.  

*"Take these four back. If they die, so do you. I’ll send someone to take over."*  

Elder Su wouldn’t handle this publicly. He turned to Li Shiming, his expression softening slightly.  

*"You’ve had a rough journey. Come, let’s talk in the sect. This town needs… restructuring."*  

With a wave, they vanished, leaving the trembling innkeeper behind.  

Elder Su’s words had sealed the inn’s fate.  

---  

Elsewhere, Ji Hongbo received the latest report from Guan Mountain Town. When he heard of the Four Tigers’ capture and Elder Su’s appearance, his face tightened.  

With Elder Su involved, this was no longer a conflict between true disciples—it had escalated to a clash between elders.  

He hadn’t consulted his father, Elder Ji, before acting. Now, he had no choice.  

Ji Hongbo arrived at Elder Ji’s cave abode and sent a signal.  

*"Enter,"* Elder Ji’s voice echoed.  

*"Father."* Ji Hongbo bowed.  

*"Worried? Don’t be. Four outsiders can’t prove anything. Your rivalry with Xu Chuan is permitted—the sect encourages competition among true disciples."* Elder Ji’s gaze was serene, as if seeing through everything.  

*"You knew?"* Ji Hongbo relaxed slightly.  

*"How can you grow without trials? Your generation lacks experience. Your schemes, Xu Chuan’s sincerity—both are valid paths. The sect cares not for right or wrong. Elder Su overstepped by intervening. He can’t pursue this further."*  

Elder Ji spoke from a lofty perspective. To him, true disciples’ conflicts were child’s play.  

Still, he knew his son had crossed a line regarding Elder Su’s injury. But since it was done, he’d handle the fallout.  

Ji Hongbo was his son, raised to strategize—a path Elder Ji had chosen for him.  

*"Reflect on my words in seclusion for three months."*  

With that, Elder Ji dismissed him.
