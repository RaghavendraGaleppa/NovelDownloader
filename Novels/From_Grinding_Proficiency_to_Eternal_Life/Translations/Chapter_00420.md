# Chapter 420: Leaving the Mountain, Foundation Establishment!

“Where on earth did Hundred Peaks True Monarch find such a monster?!”

A disciple of the Seven Killing Peak felt his heart pounding wildly. *If he is truly at the Qi Condensation stage, doesn’t that mean… he can step into Foundation Establishment at any time?!*

The disciples from the three factions were roiling with shock. They had originally thought this contest was merely a struggle between Qi Condensation cultivators, but Xu Yunfan’s appearance made them doubt that assumption.

Could it be that the True Monarchs tacitly allowed Foundation Establishment True Masters to enter?

But how could that be?!

With a Golden Core True Lord personally presiding over the event, it was absolutely impossible for Foundation Establishment cultivators to sneak in!

Unless…

Unless Xu Yunfan was truly only at the Qi Condensation stage, yet possessed combat prowess comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator!

This thought sent a chill through everyone’s hearts. Their gazes toward Xu Yunfan were no longer merely wary, but filled with deep fear!

Beside him, a disciple of the Hundred Desires Peak, who had a delicate face but clearly possessed a feminine appearance for a man, shouted, “Senior Brother Xu, the Summit Hall! The Sword Sect and the Pure Land have broken through the outer restrictions!”

Xu Yunfan looked up. Outside the Cloud Mist Hall at the highest point of the Suspended Mountain, the nine golden suns of Pure Yang True Monarch cast their shadows down from the dome.

A twelve-person Sword Sect formation, their swords and bodies united as one, was grinding the blocking disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect into blood mist.

Even more terrifying was the golden pillar of light descending from the western horizon—that was the “Guiding Buddha Light” of the Bodhisattva Pure Land. The demonic cultivators touched by it screamed while clutching their heads, twisted black smoke rising from their bodies.

However, the Primordial Origin Sect’s Clear Source True Monarch was not to be outdone. Immortal light shimmered around him as he transformed boundless clear qi into a sweet dew that rained down upon all.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained unchanged as he drew the long, crimson sword at his waist that had not been used for a long time.

Although this eighth-grade divine weapon, the Silken Thread Sword obtained from the Divine Martial Realm, seemed a bit lacking here, it was enough for him to wield the Demon-Subduing Sword of the True Martial Demon-Subduing Sutra.

Xu Yunfan’s wrist flicked lightly, and the Silken Thread Sword instantly straightened like a taut string.

Before the blade moved, a crimson sword qi burst from the tip, drawing three mournful blood marks in the void.

The sword qi was as fine as a hair, yet extremely condensed.

*Swish!*

The first strike came without warning.

Like a bloodline crossing the sky, the sword light accurately pierced the leading sword cultivator’s glabella.

The man didn't even have time to block; his protective sword qi was pierced like thin paper. The instant the sword tip passed through his skull, Xu Yunfan’s wrist twisted slightly, and the Silken Thread Sword suddenly softened, wrapping around the neck of the second sword cultivator like a living creature.

*Crack!*

Amidst the sound of cartilage shattering, Xu Yunfan formed a sword seal with his left hand and pointed at the third sword cultivator from a distance.

The sword qi of the Silken Thread Sword suddenly暴涨 (exploded) ten zhang long, and the blade turned into a blood-colored lightning bolt.

That sword cultivator hurriedly raised his sword to meet the attack, only to see the crimson sword light suddenly split into three.

Two illusory shadows feigned an attack on the eyes, while the real killing strike came from below, slashing diagonally up to sever his right arm holding the sword clean off at the shoulder.

Before the severed arm even hit the ground, Xu Yunfan had already sheathed his sword.

Three blood columns sprayed out simultaneously; they were already dead, their souls vanishing into the Sea of Suffering in the cycle of reincarnation.

Xu Yunfan didn't stop, sweeping toward the summit like a ghost.

Along the way, he encountered three sword cultivators forming a formation, and he simply crashed into the center of the sword array.

The black light erupting from the Xuanwu Demon-Subduing Seal shattered all the flying swords. Immediately after, he grabbed the heads of two sword cultivators with both hands, pouring his vast true essence into their Heavenly Spirit Covers.

The bodies of the two sword cultivators swelled like inflated leather balls before finally exploding into a rain of blood with a *bang*.

The third sword cultivator was terrified to the point of liver and gall bursting; he turned to flee but was caught by Xu Yunfan’s grabbing hand from a distance.

The Demon-Subduing Earth Evil Qi turned into black threads, tearing the man’s spine out of his body, joint by joint.

Amidst a piercing scream, as the Cloud Mist Hall came into view, a giant *Swastika* character suddenly appeared on the ground.

Eighteen gilded Buddha statues burst out of the ground. Each statue held a seated old monk in its palm.

The sound waves formed by their synchronized chanting instantly turned the five leading disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect into meat paste.

“Demon!”

The central old monk opened his eyes; within them seemed to be the birth and destruction of myriad Buddha realms. “This old monk is Cihang. Today, I shall send you to meet King Ksitigarbha!”

“You dare call yourself Cihang?”

Xu Yunfan sneered, completely unaffected by the myriad chants. He had already贴 (stuck) to the old monk’s side like a ghost.

His right hand formed a blade with two fingers, wrapped in True Martial Heavenly Gang, and plunged straight into the other party’s Dantian.

*Pfft.*

Cihang looked down in disbelief, watching as Xu Yunfan pierced his Dantian Qi Sea with a single finger.

As Xu Yunfan’s five fingers clenched, the immense Buddhist power was frantically devoured by the True Martial Devouring Demon.

The remaining seventeen old monks were horrified upon seeing this. They exerted themselves in unison, and instantly, Sanskrit and Buddhist chants resounded throughout the entire Suspended Mountain.

The violent Buddhist sound waves blew a deep pit into the plaza in front of the Cloud Mist Hall. Xu Yunfan was swept away by the shockwave, crashing through three dragon-winding pillars before stopping his momentum.

Xu Yunfan’s figure instantly crashed into the midst of them, splashing a large amount of brilliance.

When the dust settled and the light faded, Xu Yunfan shook his hand. The area before the hall had become a slaughterhouse.

The Seven Sword Sect had only seven sword cultivators left, desperately holding on. The monks of the Bodhisattva Pure Land were almost all dead.

The Primordial Origin Sect was even worse off; more than twenty Qi Condensation disciples were left with only three bloody figures barely clinging to life.

This was naturally intentional by Xu Yunfan. If the Primordial Origin Sect disciples had all survived, wouldn't that just be asking for trouble.

At this moment, the True Martial Heavenly Gang and Demon-Subduing Earth Evil in his body had completely fused, turning into a chaotic Xuanhuang (black and yellow).

In his Dantian, the Xuanwu Demon-Subduing Seal became even more solid. The starlight flowing between the turtle shell patterns faintly revealed the trajectory of the Zodiac constellations.

Every time he slew a demon, Xu Yunfan felt the true essence in his body surge.

The sword cultivators of the Seven Sword Sect were viewed by him as "Sword Demons"; slaying them allowed him to devour their sword intent. The monks of the Bodhisattva Pure Land were viewed as "Buddha Demons"; converting them allowed him to seize their Buddhist power. The disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect were viewed as "Human Demons"; killing them allowed him to refine their essence blood.

Although, due to the presence of the True Monarchs, he did not make a move against his own people, the contributions from the disciples of the Seven Sword Sect and the Bodhisattva Pure Land were sufficient.

The true essence in his body was now like a vast star sea, flowing ceaselessly.

At his back, the True Martial Millstone slowly rotated, grinding all the foreign true essences he had devoured into the purest essence, merging it into his four limbs and hundred bones.

On the surface of his skin, mysterious Dao patterns faintly appeared. Every pattern writhed as if it had life, swallowing and spitting out the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

Even more wondrous was that his spiritual sense could now look inward. He could see the Xuanwu Seal in his Dantian undergoing a qualitative change.

Between the coiling turtle and snake, strands of golden Dao patterns appeared, entwining like chains or extending like veins.

“Dao Foundation self-generating…”

Xu Yunfan realized.

Ordinary cultivators establishing their foundation need to use their own bodies as furnaces, melting Heavenly Gang and Earth Evil, performing the Foundation Establishment ritual, and ascending according to the method they cultivate. Only after success can they forge a Dao Foundation.

But he needs to use demon-slaying as the Foundation Establishment ritual. Since he has already far exceeded the requirements, he can naturally lay a supreme foundation.

The True Martial Demon-Subduing Sutra is originally a path that is currently empty; it takes demon-slaying and demon-devouring as the foundation of cultivation.

Even the Martial Dao Crystal is redundant; it is merely an embellishment. It is fine without it, but better with it.

Now that he has slain all the demons on the Suspended Mountain, the true essence in his body has reached the limit of Qi Condensation, lacking only the final step.

He looked at the information prompts that were almost flooding his vision.

‘Your proficiency in the True Martial Demon-Subduing Sutra is rising rapidly.’
‘Your True Martial Demon-Subduing Sutra has reached Great Perfection.’
‘You seem to be on the verge of stepping into True Martial Foundation Establishment.’
‘You are about to establish your foundation…’
‘…’

“Leave the mountain, establish foundation!”

(Tomorrow is the Foundation Establishment! Sorry for the delay, I really needed to lay the groundwork and expand the world-building of this realm. I hope to receive everyone's criticism and corrections. Thank you!)
