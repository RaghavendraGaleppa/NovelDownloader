# Chapter 7: The Trading House

Han Yue understood that only through tempering with true qi could his physical body grow increasingly stronger, capable of containing and generating more magical power.

As he consumed the ox heart and liver, the massive energy accumulated began to be slowly absorbed during his tempering process. Gradually, the energy within Han Yue's body reached saturation. Simply tempering his flesh could no longer absorb more primal qi, yet the primal qi from the beef he had ingested continued to disperse.

Han Yue continued to channel the power of thunder, shattering and purifying the primal qi. Slowly, this refined primal qi began converging toward his sea of consciousness. The two divine runes within his sea of consciousness started spontaneously absorbing the primal qi, converting it into divine power. Han Yue had finally found a second source to replenish his divine power.

However, the primal qi from the first-tier Steel Ghost Ox was of low quality. The conversion process into divine power was highly inefficient. The two divine runes acted like bottomless pits, devouring all the primal qi Han Yue absorbed, while only growing slightly brighter. Han Yue estimated that roughly one hundred portions of first-tier primal qi could be converted into just one portion of divine power. Still, this was a significant supplement. Han Yue now had a stable source of divine power. As long as he controlled the frequency of using his divine abilities and actively replenished his energy through meat consumption, he could ensure he would never fall into a state of energy depletion where he couldn't use his divine abilities.

At this stage, Han Yue had already formed a direction and plan for acquiring his third divine ability—though he still needed to accumulate more information.

Han Yue spent the long night immersed in cultivation.

——————

Early the next morning, Han Yue, led by Xiao Liu, left the Ninth Courtyard. They followed the road toward the center of the Celestial District. The streets were bustling with people coming and going from various courtyards. From time to time, someone would greet Xiao Liu—despite his young age, he seemed quite socially adept.

"Brother Dao," Xiao Liu said, "when you come to Fenrouji, the first stop is undoubtedly the Forty-Ninth Courtyard of the Celestial District. This courtyard has been built on commerce for over a thousand years. Their motto is 'Everything can be bought, everything can be sold!' It's the largest trading market within a radius of ten thousand miles. Everyone simply calls it 'The Trading House.'"

"The Trading House is one of the few courtyards in Fenrouji that has been passed down since its founding. Every generation of its master has been a Great Cultivator of at least the second tier, without exception. Our courtyard buys many things from them every year, and any surplus materials are also sold there."

"Brother Dao, if there's anything you need to buy, just say the word. The courtyard master approved a hundred trading coins for us—that can buy a lot of stuff."

As they walked, Xiao Liu continued his introduction, passing one uniquely styled building after another.

"What are trading coins? Does everyone use them for transactions?" Han Yue asked.

"Trading coins were originally the exclusive currency of the Trading House," Xiao Liu explained. "They were designed to facilitate transactions. One trading coin is equivalent to one low-grade spirit stone. As the Trading House's influence grew and its goods became more comprehensive, the entire Fenrouji began recognizing their currency. Nowadays, everyone uses trading coins for transactions. Outsiders also exchange their goods or spirit stones for trading coins at the Trading House before using them in Fenrouji."

Han Yue understood—the Trading House was a massive monopoly that controlled currency issuance and dominated the flow of goods and trade. It must be an extremely wealthy organization, no wonder it had maintained its legacy for a thousand years. With ample resources, it could undoubtedly nurture and cultivate more powerful cultivators.

From a distance of several courtyards, Han Yue caught sight of the Trading House. It was an exceptionally grand structure, towering above the surrounding buildings. As they approached, Han Yue saw that the Trading House occupied fifty acres of land. The entire building stood two hundred meters tall, with ten floors constructed entirely of thick, jade-white stone, exuding a bright and solemn aura.

The first floor alone accounted for half the building's height—nearly a hundred meters—and was completely hollow, supported only by a few massive stone pillars that bore the weight of the upper levels. Within this vast space lay the corpses of four enormous demonic beasts, which were being systematically dismembered. The various parts were hung on iron chains and hauled upstairs. Surrounding the beasts were dense crowds of onlookers, all seemingly indifferent to the spectacle.

Noticing Han Yue's curiosity, Xiao Liu explained, "In Fenrouji, trade related to demonic beasts is the Trading House's primary source of income. All the demonic beasts they acquire are processed and disassembled on this floor. This scene is nothing special—when a second-tier beast is being processed, it's truly spectacular. The place gets so crowded you can barely move."

Han Yue followed Xiao Liu up to the second floor. According to Xiao Liu, each floor of the building had a specific function. The first four floors were the Trading House's own shops, dedicated to purchasing, selling, refining, and knowledge, respectively.

The second floor was for buying—appraising, purchasing, and accepting pledges from visitors. The third floor was for selling—offering all manner of physical goods. The fourth floor was for refining—processing raw materials, whether for alchemy, artifact forging, or treasure crafting. The fifth floor was for knowledge—handling all transactions related to information and techniques.

The sixth floor was a free-trade bazaar where visitors could set up their own stalls. Though chaotic, it was always bustling with activity. Floors seven and above were exclusive zones requiring reservations, catering to high-level cultivators and wealthy patrons. Xiao Liu had never been up there and knew little about them.

Without hesitation, Han Yue headed straight for the fifth floor—the domain of knowledge and techniques. However, passing through the second floor, he took the opportunity to have the cleaver he had obtained from the demonic realm appraised. After spending five trading coins, he quickly received the appraisal results:

**[Blade of Gengjin (Unfinished)]**  
**Material: Gengjin Metal**  
**Tier: First-tier, top-grade**  
**Appraisal: A blade forged entirely from Gengjin metal, tempered by high-tier primal qi. The material is pure and of excellent quality, extremely hard. After further refinement, it has a high probability of advancing to the second tier.**

Han Yue had grown quite accustomed to using the cleaver, never realizing it was merely an unfinished blade. However, thanks to its extraordinary material and the tempering it had undergone from the [Thoughtless Slash], its quality was exceptional. The appraiser was reluctant to let go of the blade and made Han Yue a high-priced offer to purchase it. Of course, Han Yue had no intention of selling his trusty weapon. Declining the offer, he led Xiao Liu upstairs.
