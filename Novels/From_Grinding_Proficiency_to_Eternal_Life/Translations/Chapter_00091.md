Chapter 91: The Mountain Summit

Xu Yunfan took one last look at the two figures lying on the ground, their life gradually fading.

Chu Xuan had already completely stopped moving. Ning Wuque's earlier attack had severed her vitality. Her eyes were still fixed on Ning Wuque, who was looking up at the sky, his own gaze gradually losing its focus.

Xu Yunfan crouched down and brushed his hand over their necks. Beneath the skin, which still held a trace of warmth, the blood vessels had long since ceased to pulse.

Just as his True Blood had awakened, it was Chen Tiangang who had pierced through his vitality with a single claw. How could a warrior at the Blood Transformation Realm possibly be a match for someone who had not even reached the Three Unifications of the Outer Body?

He looked up. The figure of General Cui was flickering amidst the rising flames of the Cicada Gate's buildings ahead. The firelight cast the General's shadow long and distorted. The supervising officer was calmly wiping his blade, his foot stepping on the head of the Cicada Gate's last remaining elder.

The elder's eyes were wide open, canthi tearing apart, filled with unwillingness and fury.

This elder was the Cicada Gate's only Great Martial Master at the Three Unifications of the Outer Body, yet he was beheaded in a single strike.

General Cui's deliberate delay was clearly meant to send Ning Wuque to his death.

Xu Yunfan hesitated no longer and hurried toward the Cicada Gate's rear mountain. He still hadn't obtained the Cicada Shirt martial art from the Muscle Refining Realm; he needed to go to the Transmission Cave in the rear mountain to retrieve it.

On the stone path of the rear mountain, the smell of scorching filled the air, like a gloomy haze that refused to disperse. As Xu Yunfan stepped over a still-smoking broken beam, his ears suddenly twitched.

Thirty zhang away, in the pine forest, the clanging of chain mail and the death rattles intertwined, piercing through the silence that was about to settle over the mountain gate.

Amidst the chaotic sounds, Xu Yunfan caught a familiar shout and roar. His figure flashed instantly, like an arrow leaving a bow, rushing toward the source of the sound.

When Xu Yunfan got close, the scene before him ignited an unprovoked killing intent in his chest.

Lin Hanyi was seen being mercilessly pinned to an ancient cypress tree by three anti-armor spears. Blood flowed slowly down the rough bark, dyeing the ground a deep crimson.

The Xuanjia soldiers surrounding her had ferocious expressions as they raised their curved blades to gouge out her remaining right eye.

The blade was suddenly shattered into dust by a flying pebble.

Xu Yunfan's figure crashed through several trees. The Weng Jin Hammer in his hand swept out with the force of a thousand jun, the resulting wind pressure directly flipping two soldiers to the ground.

The third soldier couldn't dodge in time. The hammer head pierced into his chest cavity, and the immense impact force nailed his entire body into the three-inch-thick mountain rock, instantly splattering a patch of blood onto the stone.

The remaining two tried to scramble up, but the heavy hammer flying toward them sent them tumbling backward like rag dolls. The Xuanjia armor on their bodies was shattered by the blow, and fragments of the armor shot out with a 'puffing' sound, embedding into the dirt, stones, and tree trunks.

Sweeping his gaze around and confirming there were no more enemies, Xu Yunfan walked to Lin Hanyi's side. His five fingers gripped the shaft of the anti-armor spear. The muscles in his arm bulged like twisting steel cables as he slowly pulled the spear out.

The sound of the spear tip grinding against bone made one's teeth ache. Lin Hanyi couldn't help but let out a muffled groan, cold sweat dripping down her pale chin.

When the three blood-stained spearheads were pulled out one by one, they brought out fragments of bone that fell to the ground with a crisp sound.

"Hold on."

Xu Yunfan tore open the blood-stained hem of his clothes. The fabric made a tearing sound as it wrapped around the wound.

He noticed that Lin Hanyi's left shoulder blade was shattered. He carefully avoided the collapsed flesh and skin while bandaging. This was the most fatal injury for a martial artist. Without some divine elixir or precious medicine in the future, Lin Hanyi's martial arts were essentially ruined.

Lin Hanyi's涣散 gaze gradually focused. Her blood-stained eyelashes trembled, her face pale as she looked at Xu Yunfan, who was wrapping her wound with a rag.

It was a long while before she spoke. "I wronged you. I thought you were just a convert from the outside, here for the Cicada Gate's martial arts, or even a spy for the imperial court. Now it seems..."

She couldn't continue, her face full of bitterness.

Xu Yunfan said somewhat helplessly, "Senior Sister, I came to apprentice myself precisely to find a backer and practice superior martial arts. I didn't expect such a thing to happen."

He looked at Lin Hanyi's dejected expression and continued, "Now that the Cicada Gate's disciples are mostly dead or injured and the mountain gate is destroyed, I plan to go to the Transmission Cave to find the Cicada Shirt martial art."

He had pondered it carefully. The Heavenly Zen Qi was extremely exquisite and had the effect of hardening the body. The Cicada Shirt could take him to the next level, perhaps truly making him impervious to blades and spears, or even resistant to sharp weapons.

Hearing this, the spirit in Lin Hanyi's eyes was immediately extinguished by half. She felt somewhat helpless and fell silent for a moment. Watching Xu Yunfin finish bandaging her wounds, she finally spoke. "The Cicada Shirt isn't in the Transmission Cave. I placed it in the Thunder Tower at the summit of Accumulated Thunder Mountain a few days ago. That is where our Cicada Gate raises the Cicadas."

"Thunder Tower..."

Xu Yunfan was a bit surprised. He had been practicing on the summit these past few days and had naturally seen that tower. The entire tower was forged from refined iron. The tip of the tower had an extremely tall lightning rod. Accumulated Thunder Mountain was shrouded in dark clouds all day, with thunder and lightning striking down from time to time. Fully half of the lightning that struck the summit landed on the Thunder Tower.

"Cicadas need lightning as a guide to be raised alive; otherwise, they wouldn't be so precious."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly and stood up. "Senior Sister Lin, there is a small path leading down the mountain in the rear. I think you should be clear about that."

The route Lin Hanyi had retreated along was precisely the direction of that path.

Her gaze slowly turned to the Cicada Gate, which was engulfed in a raging inferno, her expression full of gloom. She had once thought that with a prodigy like Ning Wuque in this generation, coupled with the addition of the naturally gifted Xu Yunfan, the Cicada Gate would surely be able to escape its predicament of a shortage of talent and restore its prestige.

However, all of this turned out to be a conspiracy orchestrated by their master, Chen Tiangang.

Now that things had come to this, the centuries-old foundation of the Cicada Gate had been destroyed just like that.

She never expected that all of this was Chen Tiangang's doing.

Now that the situation was irreversible, everything was over.

"Junior Brother Xu, I'm leaving. If we have the chance to meet again in the future, I will surely repay your kindness!"

Lin Hanyi gave Xu Yunfan a deep look, then clutching her injured shoulder, she stumbled and disappeared into the forest.

Xu Yunfan could see the unwillingness in Lin Hanyi's eyes. She probably wasn't willing to let this go. Among the Five Ridges and Seven Mountains of Wuzhou, even if the 100,000 Tiger and Xuanjia Armies had shattered the mountain gate, the scattered disciples were still an extremely formidable force.

That Empress was truly ruthless.

Instead of eliminating the Incense Sect, she instead mobilized a great army to target the sects.

Usually, there were no shortage of dirty dealings within the sects, but in such a situation, most would unite against a common enemy. What would the other sects in the various provinces think if they saw this?

If things weren't handled carefully, the entire Great Zhou Dynasty could be overturned because of it.

What was she trying to achieve?

Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to think about it. He put force into his feet and quickly rushed toward the summit of Accumulated Thunder Mountain. If he didn't take advantage of the chaos now, once the Xuanjia Army surrounded the area, he would have no chance left.

"Such audacity, to dare to ascend the mountain!"
