# Chapter 150: Opening the Immortal Cave, Becoming a Local Immortal

Upon entering the mountain belly, all three immediately broke into smiles. Before them lay yet another spirit vein. With a brief sense, they instantly discerned its grade.

"A second-tier spirit vein!" Jiang Hongguang exclaimed in surprise. "And its quality isn't low; it must be mid-grade. Spirit veins of this caliber are only found on Thousand Illusions Island and among the top twenty islands."

At this, Jiang Hongguang's expression suddenly turned serious. He was well aware of what such a spirit vein implied. The hidden spirit vein he had previously discovered was merely a low-grade second-tier one, yet it had already attracted the attention of the perfected Qi Refining stage island master of Stele Forest Island. If word got out that this island contained a mid-grade or higher second-tier spirit vein, even the Six Great Clans would be tempted.

Chu Ning saw the expression on Jiang Hongguang's face and naturally understood his thoughts. His brows twitched slightly; he hadn't expected such a high-grade spirit vein to be present on Flying Rainbow Island. Although it seemed a bit small, its high grade meant that such a spirit vein could indeed attract the covetous gaze of Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Just as Chu Ning was about to speak, Jiang Hongguang preempted him: "Fellow Daoist Chu, this spirit vein has just been discovered, and no one knows about it except the three of us. My wife and I can swear on our Dao Hearts that we will never reveal a single word of this matter to anyone else."

Before Chu Ning could reply, Jiang Hongguang continued, "Our family consists of three people, and this spirit vein is a little too small for us to establish a cave abode. How about you establish your cave abode on this spirit vein, and we find another place? What do you think, Fellow Daoist Chu? Of course, if Fellow Daoist Chu has other arrangements for that spirit vein, your arrangements will take precedence."

Chu Ning looked at Jiang Hongguang with a hint of surprise after hearing his words. Although the spirit vein was described as small, it was only about 30% smaller than the previous one. Establishing two cave abodes on it would be no problem at all. For Jiang Hongguang to be so decisive now made Chu Ning look at him in a new light. However, Chu Ning also understood that all of this was naturally built upon the strength he had displayed earlier.

After some thought, Chu Ning replied, "In that case, many thanks, Fellow Daoist Jiang! My cave abode will be built here. I naturally have no use for the other spirit vein, so Fellow Daoist Jiang can arrange it as he sees fit."

Jiang Hongguang immediately smiled and waved his hand. "Fellow Daoist Chu, you jest. This island was saved with your help, and this spirit vein was also discovered by you. Strictly speaking, the other spirit vein being entirely ours is already thanks to your good fortune."

Having said that, Jiang Hongguang continued, "This area is inherently sparsely populated, but I will immediately return and send a message to the entire island that Yan Peak is off-limits from now on. However, Fellow Daoist Chu, you should definitely set up a formation here."

"A formation!" Chu Ning was enlightened by the suggestion but also felt a bit lost. How would he know how to set up such a thing?

Yu Yuanxiu, who was beside him, seemed to guess Chu Ning's thoughts and reminded him, "It's not too difficult. There are corresponding formation plates and flags sold in the Cen family's shop on Thousand Illusions Island, along with instructions on how to set them up."

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning nodded at once. "Alright, thank you both for the reminder. I'll open my cave abode first, and then I'll go to Thousand Illusions Island to take a look."

"In that case, we won't disturb Fellow Daoist Chu." Jiang Hongguang took his leave immediately, knowing that opening a cave abode was a relatively private matter. Chu Ning naturally did not try to keep them. After seeing them out of the mountain belly, he returned inside.

After another careful examination, a trace of joy unconsciously appeared on Chu Ning's face. Jiang Hongguang's assessment had been conservative; the section of the spirit vein they had just seen was only a relatively lower quality part of it. In fact, another section of this spirit vein had reached the quality of a high-grade second-tier spirit vein.

"If this spirit vein were a bit larger, it might have already met the standards for establishing a sect. Using it now to set up a cave abode, even I feel it's a bit extravagant," Chu Ning thought to himself, but his hands did not stop moving. This was his first time establishing his own cave abode, and Chu Ning began working according to his practical needs.

Firstly, a cultivation chamber, a talisman crafting room, and a resting room were naturally essential. Chu Ning placed these in the area with the highest quality spirit vein. Above that highest quality section of the spirit vein, Chu Ning carved out six cave chambers. Immediately after, he opened up a few more chambers nearby to serve as spirit beast rooms. These naturally included spaces for Little White and the Iron Rock Beast. However, Chu Ning also left some extra space, considering that he might raise other spirit beasts in the future.

The cave chambers were more or less complete. Chu Ning looked at the large area in front of him, feeling a slight headache. For him, another very important element was the herb garden and spirit fields.

After all, he had a large number of spirit plants to cultivate. However, the spiritual energy in the soil above this mountain peak was insufficient. If he were to open up an herb garden, he would need to excavate almost half of the mountain. This was mainly because it was a hidden spirit vein. Otherwise, with such a high-grade spirit vein present, the soil above would definitely be teeming with spiritual energy.

Thus, Chu Ning began clearing the land with the Iron Rock Beast. Fortunately, there was a low-lying area right next to the mountain peak, which was perfect for piling up the excavated soil. Otherwise, the sheer volume of soil alone would have been a headache for Chu Ning.

After a few days, Chu Ning had dug down almost half of the mountain but stopped digging further. This location was already quite conspicuous; if it weren't for Jiang Hongguang's order to avoid this area, it would likely be discovered by anyone who took a quick look. And if he dug any deeper, any cultivator would easily sense the spirit vein below.

"It seems I still need to go to Thousand Illusions Island to buy a set of formations first." Thinking this, Chu Ning walked out of his cultivation chamber. The only thing that worried Chu Ning was that because he had opened up a large number of spirit fields and herb gardens, the scope of this cave abode was truly immense. Coupled with his high requirements for these formations and restrictions, he wondered if the Cen family would even sell such formations.

"Little White!" Chu Ning called out to Little White. "Guard the cave abode and don't let anyone get close. If any cultivators come, scare them away."

Little White responded with a soft "Ying." Chu Ning then left with peace of mind. The little fellow was already a high-grade first-tier spirit beast. If it could cultivate and advance, it wouldn't be far from breaking through to a second-tier spirit beast. Ordinary Qi Refining Stage Level 9 cultivators would likely not be its match. As long as outsiders didn't come, the people on this island posed no threat to it.

As for the Iron Rock Beast, it couldn't be left here yet. Chu Ning had simply used a spell to create a basic contract for it according to the method he had obtained from the spirit beast stable disciple. He was still the only one who could command it. Although Little White would often tease it, it couldn't fully command it when faced with serious situations. Therefore, to avoid any complications, Chu Ning took it with him in a spirit beast pouch.

When entering and exiting Flying Rainbow Island again, Chu Ning naturally did not disturb Jiang Hongguang and his wife. He directly arrived at Thousand Illusions Island via the teleportation array. After a brief inquiry, he headed straight for the Cen family's shop. Not far from the teleportation array was Thousand Illusions Island's market. The Six Great Clans of the Thousand Islands Alliance all had their shops in the market.

The Cen family's shop was named Cen Workshop. It was easily recognizable at a glance. Chu Ning casually observed the market and noticed that other families, like the Chen and Liu families, also used similar naming conventions. It seemed that in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands, the names of the Six Great Clans of the Thousand Islands Alliance were themselves brands, naturally offering greater recognition.

While the name Cen Workshop wasn't particularly grand, its location was well-chosen. It was a three-story building, exquisitely designed and elegant. As Chu Ning entered the Cen Workshop, a cultivator immediately approached him. He was likely at Qi Refining Level 5, and greeted Chu Ning enthusiastically, "Senior, what would you like to buy or sell? Our Cen Workshop has pills, talismans, artifacts, and formations. Of course, our most powerful offerings are formations."

Chu Ning was slightly surprised to hear this. He had always thought that Cen Workshop only sold items for setting up formations, but he hadn't expected it to be so comprehensive. Taking this opportunity, Chu Ning quickly glanced around. However, he found that the talismans and artifacts were not of particularly high grade. The talismans, surprisingly, only went up to high-grade low-tier, and there were only three or four types, with their quality naturally being inferior to those he crafted. This was quite accurate to his prior judgment of the overall talisman level in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands. As for artifacts, Chu Ning only saw mid-grade ones.

Shaking his head, Chu Ning directly asked the cultivator, "How can I choose a formation?"

"Senior, tell me your requirements, and I can help you select from our existing formation flags and plates. If there's nothing suitable, we can also ask the clan to refine one. You can also ask a formation master from our clan to set it up for you, which is the fastest way."

Hearing the cultivator's words, Chu Ning shook his head slightly. He would definitely not consider inviting a formation master to set it up; that would expose his cave abode. So, Chu Ning said to the attendant, "I need a relatively high-grade formation, capable of covering an area of about two hundred mu. It needs to have a concealment effect, allow for separate restrictions within, and some areas also need a spirit-gathering effect. The defensive capability needs to be strong, the stronger the better..."

As Chu Ning spoke, the Qi Refining Level 5 cultivator in front of him immediately showed a surprised expression. When Chu Ning finished, he quickly said, "Senior, the requirements for the formation you need are too high. Please wait a moment, I'll go speak with the manager."

Chu Ning nodded in agreement, and the attendant immediately turned and went upstairs to the second floor. At this time, Chu Ning also saw other cultivators entering.

They were all inquiring about formations. One person bought a set of ordinary formations, just for simple concealment, but the price was surprisingly high, a full 500 spirit stones. This made Chu Ning click his tongue in silent calculation. If the formation he bought was truly high-grade, the price would likely be substantial. He did have some wealth, but he still needed to cultivate later. Without selling a large number of talismans, his income source was no longer as stable as before.

"Perhaps I could find a shop in this market and hire someone to help me sell talismans?" This thought popped into Chu Ning's mind. He had only sold talismans in the rogue cultivator gathering area before, and he hadn't looked into how to open a shop in Thousand Illusions Island's market. But he felt it was a good idea.

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, the attendant returned and came before him. "Senior, please come upstairs. Our manager is waiting for you upstairs."

Chu Ning nodded lightly. He also felt that the formation he wanted was probably beyond what an attendant could handle. The Cen family was reputed as the foremost formation family in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands. For their manager to be willing to personally come out, Chu Ning naturally felt more at ease. The attendant led Chu Ning up the stairs, but surprisingly, directly to the third floor. This surprised Chu Ning slightly, as he had originally thought that the second floor was where more advanced formation transactions took place.

On the third floor, the attendant led Chu Ning directly to a room marked "Teahouse," invited Chu Ning inside, and then withdrew himself. The teahouse clearly had some kind of restriction; Chu Ning couldn't see inside, but he could easily walk in. However, when Chu Ning stepped inside, he paused slightly.

Inside the teahouse, there was a tea table, and behind it sat a white-robed woman with an ethereal aura, her face covered by a white veil. It was none other than Fairy Cen. Chu Ning, now closer, sensed her aura slightly and confirmed it was indeed a Foundation Establishment cultivator. He immediately bowed and saluted, "Greetings, Senior Cen!"

"Fellow Daoist Chu, please be seated. There's no need for the title of 'Senior'; just calling me Fellow Daoist will suffice." Chu Ning secretly sighed in admiration. No wonder she was so highly regarded by the male cultivators in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands. Fairy Cen's voice was exceptionally melodious, utterly pleasant to the ear, inspiring a desire to glimpse her face beneath the veil.

Thinking this, Chu Ning courteously replied, "I wouldn't dare. Senior is a Foundation Establishment cultivator; I, your junior, should naturally show respect and dare not address you as an equal."

Fairy Cen heard this and her bright eyes settled on Chu Ning. "Respect? Perhaps not. When I asked my maid to invite Fellow Daoist Chu earlier, you refused quite decisively." As she spoke, Fairy Cen's divine sense enveloped Chu Ning. Chu Ning felt the pressure, which wasn't strong and didn't seem malicious. His expression remained normal, and he bowed again, saying, "Senior, please don't be offended. It was truly odd how that female Daoist came that day. I felt that someone of your esteemed status wouldn't seek out a junior without reason. Fearing it was someone else with ulterior motives, using your name, I simply left."

Fairy Cen retracted her divine sense and said with a light chuckle, "In that case, it was indeed my oversight. I should have come to find you myself that day."

"I wouldn't dare trouble Senior," Chu Ning quickly bowed again.

"Fellow Daoist Chu, please be seated!" Fairy Cen then pointed to the seat opposite her. Chu Ning didn't hesitate and immediately sat down.

"My name is Cen Ziqin. My age is likely similar to Fellow Daoist Chu's, and what I said earlier about not calling me Senior truly comes from my heart," Fairy Cen said slowly as she brewed tea. "Being called 'Senior' all the time always makes me feel old."

Chu Ning paused slightly upon hearing this, somewhat understanding why she felt this way. So he directly said to Cen Ziqin, "Then I shall heed Fellow Daoist's words."

Cen Ziqin looked at Chu Ning with a hint of surprise. Though her face was still veiled, Chu Ning detected a smile in her eyes.

"Fellow Daoist, please sample this spirit tea. The Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands are very suitable for growing spirit tea, but when it comes to quality, our Cen Workshop's tea is top-tier." As Cen Ziqin spoke, she casually waved her hand, and a cup of spirit tea floated to Chu Ning. Chu Ning reached out, took a sip, and immediately felt spiritual energy circulating and a fragrant taste lingering in his mouth.

"Good tea!" Chu Ning praised, then went straight to the point: "Fellow Daoist Cen, I came here mainly to purchase items for setting up a formation."

"I've already heard about it from the people in the workshop," Cen Ziqin replied casually, then directly took out a set of formation flags from her storage pouch. "This set of formation flags was recently researched and refined by me, consolidating many of my insights into the Dao of formations. Although it differs somewhat from our Cen family's most top-tier grand formations and isn't quite enough for something like a grand protective formation, it still cannot cover such a large area.

But if it's used to set up a cave abode, I believe that within the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands, there is no cultivator strong enough to break through this formation." Cen Ziqin's voice was calm, and her words were not humble. However, considering her reputation as the "Number One Formation Master of the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands," Chu Ning chose to believe her.

At this point, Cen Ziqin's words continued. "Moreover, this formation indeed has a spirit-gathering effect, which should meet Fellow Daoist's needs. As for separating different restricted zones, I haven't incorporated that yet. But it's not difficult; Fellow Daoist just needs to give me a few days, and I can refine a few more formation flags to meet your requirements." As she spoke, Cen Ziqin's bright eyes looked directly into Chu Ning's face. "I wonder if Fellow Daoist is satisfied with this formation?"

Chu Ning did not answer directly but instead asked, "Fellow Daoist Cen, this formation must be quite valuable, wouldn't it?"

Cen Ziqin nodded then shook her head. "I said before, this formation was just developed by me. If you say it's valuable, in terms of formation grade and efficacy, it's indeed among the best in this Cen Workshop. But while this thing cost me a lot of effort, it's not a rare heavenly treasure after all. As for its value, that's entirely up to me to decide."

Hearing Cen Ziqin's words, Chu Ning was silent for a long while. Then he spoke again, "I wonder what conditions Fellow Daoist Cen has? I imagine it's not something that can be simply bought with spirit stones."

Cen Ziqin chuckled softly. "Fellow Daoist Chu is clever. If I wanted spirit stones, I only need to spread the word, and I believe there would be many cultivators in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands willing to pay a high price. I really wouldn't need to offer it to Fellow Daoist. However, I'd like to make a trade with Fellow Daoist for this set of formation flags."

"A trade?" Chu Ning looked at her with some confusion upon hearing this.

"Precisely, a trade!" Cen Ziqin nodded slightly. Without waiting for Chu Ning to ask again, she continued, "If I'm not mistaken, the high-grade low-tier talismans Fellow Daoist used in the competition a few days ago were crafted by yourself, weren't they?"

Chu Ning nodded; there was nothing to hide. After all, he had sold many talismans in the rogue cultivator trading area before. At this moment, he seemed to vaguely guess something.

Seeing Chu Ning admit it, Cen Ziqin followed up: "The trade I want to make with Fellow Daoist is this: I will gift this set of formation flags to Fellow Daoist. And Fellow Daoist, in turn, will entrust the talismans you craft to our Cen Workshop for sale."

Chu Ning heard Cen Ziqin's words, which were not far from what he had expected, and asked with a hint of curiosity: "Fellow Daoist Cen, your Cen Workshop's formations are so renowned; in this short while I've been here, many people have already come to inquire about purchasing them. My talismans aren't of extremely high grade and may not be as attractive as your formations. Why would you consider selling my talismans?"

Cen Ziqin heard Chu Ning's words and, without hesitation, replied directly, "Fellow Daoist may not have been in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands for very long, but you should have heard. The Six Great Clans of the Thousand Islands Alliance are both cooperative and competitive. When dealing with outsiders, they naturally cooperate. But internally, each family hopes to obtain more resources and strengthen their own power."

Chu Ning nodded; he had no difficulty understanding this point. A structure like the Thousand Islands Alliance was indeed prone to such phenomena.

Cen Ziqin then continued, "While our Cen family has made considerable achievements in the Dao of formations, we are quite ordinary in other aspects. Whether it's talisman crafting, alchemy, or artifact refining, we are far behind the other families. Therefore, in terms of resource acquisition speed, we are also much slower than the other five families. As Fellow Daoist knows, formations are not needed frequently; once purchased, they might not be needed again for decades. The reason why Fellow Daoist saw many customers at Cen Workshop just now is also because the Thousand Islands Competition just concluded, and some cultivators need to set up formations. Otherwise, there aren't many people here."

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning finally understood. Now, he also understood why Cen Ziqin had sought him out. After some thought, Chu Ning asked, "If the talismans are to be sold here, how does Fellow Daoist Cen plan to conduct the trade?"

"Fifty-fifty!"

As soon as Cen Ziqin spoke these words, Chu Ning immediately said indifferently, "Fellow Daoist Cen, why don't you tell me how this formation would be traded for spirit stones instead?" Fifty-fifty, what kind of joke was that? If he found a shop in this market and hired someone to help sell talismans, he would definitely get more than 50% profit.

Hearing Chu Ning's blunt refusal, Cen Ziqin paused slightly. Then, she chuckled lightly, "Fellow Daoist, why be like this? The division can naturally be negotiated. How about this: you take 55%, and we take 45%?"

Chu Ning shook his head, then directly stated, "This price is non-negotiable. Eighty-twenty. If Fellow Daoist agrees, we'll finalize the deal directly."

Hearing Chu Ning's words, a hint of anger flashed in Fairy Cen's bright eyes. She unconsciously unleashed her Foundation Establishment cultivator aura. Chu Ning's heart immediately jolted. While calmly sipping his spirit tea, his other hand had already moved to his storage pouch.

Seeing Chu Ning's action, Cen Ziqin's eyes flickered. She suddenly dispersed her aura, then said with a light, smiling voice, "Fellow Daoist, can't you be a little understanding? It's truly not easy for me, a woman, to manage this Cen Family Workshop. The family faces considerable pressure."

Chu Ning saw Cen Ziqin disperse her aura and slightly moved his hand away from his storage pouch. He then said with a wry smile, "Fellow Daoist Cen, please don't joke with me. You are a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and your formation talent surpasses everyone. Who in the family would dare to show you disrespect?"

Cen Ziqin saw Chu Ning's unyielding demeanor, her bright eyes flickered. Then she said seriously, "Fellow Daoist, eighty-twenty is impossible. How about..."

Half an hour later.

Chu Ning walked out of the Cen Workshop with a normal expression. After a fierce negotiation, the two finally reached a mutually satisfactory deal. Chu Ning ultimately agreed to a 60/40 split. The most important reason for agreeing to this proportion was, of course, the Cen family's status. They were, after all, the Alliance Master's family of the Thousand Islands Alliance.

Although Chu Ning had seemed impervious to persuasion earlier, he had actually been observing Cen Ziqin's actions the entire time. This Fairy Cen, despite her high cultivation, clearly wasn't very cunning; Chu Ning could discern her intentions from her every move. If it had been an old fox with more experience, Chu Ning wouldn't have dared to be so presumptuous. He had also been keeping an eye on her; if she had truly resorted to strong-arm tactics, Chu Ning, being dependent on others, would naturally have had to reconsider. Fortunately, this Fairy Cen did not truly use her power to suppress him.

But Chu Ning also knew when to stop. At the same time, another important reason Chu Ning chose to agree to this split was the set of formation flags in her hand. Such a valuable item was truly not something he could currently buy with spirit stones. So, even if calculated precisely, he wasn't at a disadvantage.

However, Chu Ning also had one condition: that it should not be revealed that he was the one who crafted the talismans. Chu Ning could foresee that if the Cen family could indeed produce a batch of high-quality talismans, and if Cen Ziqin also found a way to promote them, the Cen Workshop's talisman business would definitely boom. This would inevitably compete with the business of the other five families. And if the other five families knew that these talismans were made by Chu Ning, it would be equivalent to unknowingly offending them. This was something Chu Ning was absolutely unwilling to do. He just wanted to cultivate peacefully and steadily.

At first, Cen Ziqin did not agree to this. Her original intention was to use the talismans crafted by Chu Ning as a gimmick to make a big splash. After all, Chu Ning's display of talisman arts in the Thousand Islands Competition had already gained him some fame.

However, given Chu Ning's firm demand and his declaration that he would not make the deal if this point was not agreed to, Fairy Cen finally consented. Correspondingly, Chu Ning, who had originally wanted 65%, finally conceded to 60%. Fairy Cen also made a demand: a supply of one thousand talismans every ten days, with at least 60% being high-grade low-tier talismans. Otherwise, the quantity would have to increase. Chu Ning initially showed great difficulty with this but ultimately reluctantly agreed. In his heart, he didn't even consider this quantity of talismans a problem. Crafting a hundred talismans a day was no trouble at all for someone with his extremely high success rate. Of course, in front of her, he still had to appear to be struggling.

Just as Chu Ning walked out of Cen Workshop, on the third floor of Cen Workshop, Cen Ziqin watched Chu Ning's retreating figure with a smile in her bright eyes.

"A hundred talismans a day, that should be squeezing him quite a bit. Actually, as long as his high-quality talismans drive sales, our own talismans can also sell, so overall, we'll naturally earn a lot more." Cen Ziqin mumbled softly. Then, recalling Chu Ning's bargaining and unyielding demeanor earlier, she pondered. "He seems cautious and meticulous, yet he was neither humble nor arrogant when facing me, a Foundation Establishment cultivator. This person is quite interesting. It's said he hasn't been in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands for long. Before this, he must have seen some grander world."

...

Three days later, Chu Ning entered Cen Workshop again and received a complete set of formation items from Cen Ziqin. At the same time, he also gave her a thousand talismans. Chu Ning simply said he still had many left from before, and Cen Ziqin didn't think much of it. Additionally, Chu Ning gave Cen Ziqin a portrait, informing her that from now on, a person named Liu Ping would be responsible for the talisman transactions. The location for handing over the talismans also couldn't be on Thousand Illusions Island, but rather on Misty Isle, which was more populous and bustling. Cen Ziqin could also designate someone to go for the transaction. Although Cen Ziqin found it slightly inconvenient, she ultimately agreed. However, she found Chu Ning's extreme caution somewhat amusing.

Chu Ning didn't care what the other party thought. After everything was settled, he quickly left Cen Workshop and returned to Yan Peak on Flying Rainbow Island. Then, he took out the formation plate and flags from his storage pouch and began to study them. Chu Ning had never set up a formation before, but fortunately, Cen Ziqin had explained everything in great detail, even giving Chu Ning a schematic diagram.

Chu Ning first placed the formation plate in the core position, then, according to the diagram, began to arrange the formation flags. Sometimes the position wasn't precise, so Chu Ning had to adjust them repeatedly. And because Chu Ning also required different chambers, spirit fields, and herb gardens to have corresponding restrictions, there were naturally more formation flags. By the time Chu Ning had everything arranged, more than half a day had passed.

When the last formation flag was inserted, Chu Ning came to the formation plate's position and activated the incantation. Instantly, streams of spiritual energy surged from the spirit vein and converged into the formation plate. A magical scene then unfolded: the entire Yan Peak began to be enveloped in layers of white mist. If anyone outside were to see it, they would magically discover that the entire mountain peak disappeared into the white mist in the blink of an eye. Immediately, the white mist also vanished. In its place, a mountain peak appeared, identical in shape to the original Yan Peak.

Chu Ning, inside the formation, sensed his surroundings briefly and then, curious, stepped out of the formation. Hovering in the air, Chu Ning looked at the mountain peak, which was now exactly the same as it was before he opened his cave abode, and felt a great sense of wonder. The set of formation flags Cen Ziqin had given him was indeed capable of deceiving external sight to appear identical to the original mountain peak.

After some thought, Chu Ning released his puppet bird and commanded it to fly towards the mountain peak. The puppet bird had barely reached the mountain top when, the next moment, Chu Ning completely lost contact with it. And the puppet bird plummeted directly downwards. Chu Ning tried to release his divine sense to probe, but his divine sense was completely blocked by a layer of restriction upon touching the grand formation.

Thinking for a moment, Chu Ning raised his hand, and a streak of crimson flame shot towards the grand formation. This pillar of fire hit the outer restriction and instantly dissipated, while the formation's protective restriction didn't even show the slightest ripple.

"This formation is truly good. It doesn't even seem to have a name yet." Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction. He had thought about giving it a name, but then decided against it. As long as the formation was effective, a name was irrelevant. Holding the restriction jade token, he directly returned inside the formation. Chu Ning then immediately began the second half of his cave abode construction.

He directed the Iron Rock Beast to excavate all the excess soil from the herb garden and spirit fields. After another day of work, Chu Ning's self-opened cave abode was finally fully formed.

The side facing the lake had been completely opened up. Chu Ning's cultivation chamber and living quarters were on this side. At the same time, this side also had a few stone rooms, providing a place for occasional visitors to stay. From the cave chamber halfway up the mountain, Chu Ning could simply look up and see the shimmering lake. Outside the cave chamber, Chu Ning even made a frame similar to the reclining chair in his previous room. When he had nothing to do, he could enjoy the lake and mountain scenery.

In the next cave chamber, Chu Ning dug a bit deeper, with a clear spring in the middle. Around the spring, two larger fire spirit crystals were buried, making the entire room's fire-attribute spiritual energy incredibly rich, even feeling a bit hot in the air. However, under the effect of the cave chamber's restrictions, these fire-attribute spiritual energies condensed without dissipating, and the spring itself became a natural hot spring.

A few chambers away were the spirit beast rooms, one each for Little White and the Iron Rock Beast, with a few empty ones remaining.

Stepping out of the cave chambers, one's gaze was met by a massive herb garden. This area of the herb garden was still within the scope of the high-grade spirit vein. Therefore, both the quality of the spirit soil and the density of spiritual energy could barely compare to the cave abode Chu Ning briefly resided in at Qingxi Sect for two months. Since Chu Ning hadn't yet planted all the spirit herbs, the herb garden was still just one large area. Chu Ning still had some formation flags in his hand; once the spirit herbs were planted, he could freely set up restrictions to separate areas within it.

Beyond the herb garden were spirit fields spanning a full hundred mu. Their spiritual energy density and the grade of their spirit soil were no lower than the twenty mu of spirit fields outside Yanji Market. However, although these hundred mu of spirit fields were also covered by the formation, relatively speaking, the outer defenses would be weaker. The main protective restrictions of the formation still lay at the edge of the herb garden. After all, he would plant higher-value spirit herbs and plants in the herb garden, while the quality of what was planted in the spirit fields would naturally be lower.

After taking Little White and the Iron Rock Beast for a stroll, Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction. Then he turned to the two little fellows and said, "Next, I'll be planting spirit herbs and plants here. Don't run around anymore and trample them."

"Ying!" Little White nodded灵性 (intelligently/with spiritual awareness). The next moment, it sent a divine sense message. "Can I eat them when they're grown?"

Chu Ning smiled, "Yes, but you have to help them ripen faster."

"Ying!" Little White whined, as if saying it already knew that would be the case.

Chu Ning chuckled, clearly explaining which areas they could go and which they couldn't, then sent both little fellows back to the spirit beast room. Then, he began to take things out of his storage pouch.

The first thing Chu Ning took out was the jade box containing the seedlings of the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit. Chu Ning had obtained these seedlings several months ago, but since he hadn't found a suitable place to plant them, they had remained in his storage pouch. Not only these seedlings, but because Chu Ning had been constantly refining his magic power, he hadn't consumed the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit itself, nor the Azure Wood Prime Yang Pills. However, Chu Ning wasn't in a hurry to consume them now; he would deal with these spirit herbs and plants first.

At this moment, he opened the jade box and took a look; the seedlings were still preserved quite well. Chu Ning immediately took out these seedlings and began planting them in the herb garden. After planting over thirty saplings, Chu Ning began casting spells. Chu Ning still used the Azure Wood Spring Radiance spell; he hadn't yet cultivated or used the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell. The Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit was too precious, so Chu Ning didn't want to try lightly for now.

After casting the Azure Wood Spring Radiance spell for a while, Chu Ning proceeded to plant the other seedlings. By then, about half an hour had passed. Chu Ning returned to the area where the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit had been planted and carefully sensed it. He could clearly perceive wisps of spiritual energy converging towards the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit. However, his brows also furrowed slightly. This was because, at this moment, among the spiritual energy converging towards the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit, the wood-attribute spiritual energy was significantly more abundant, while the fire-attribute spiritual energy was somewhat lacking. This was naturally because the Azure Wood Spring Radiance spell itself was a wood-attribute biased spell. It didn't matter for some ordinary spirit plants, but the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit required a very balanced mix of wood and fire attribute spiritual energy. Otherwise, even if it bore fruit, the quality would be greatly diminished.

However, Chu Ning had somewhat anticipated all of this. He directly took out three larger fire spirit crystals from his storage pouch and buried them in several locations within this herb garden. At the same time, he took out a few more formation flags from his storage pouch and, finding the right spots, inserted them. Instantly, an invisible restriction separated this small herb garden. This was precisely the spirit-gathering effect Chu Ning had emphasized when purchasing the formation earlier. Otherwise, the fire-attribute spiritual energy within these fire spirit crystals would simply dissipate, which would be a huge waste.

Immediately after, Chu Ning went to other herb gardens and cast the Sweet Rain spell and the Azure Wood Spring Radiance spell one after another. Only then did Chu Ning go to the outer spirit fields and plant the Iron Stem Orchids and other items from his storage pouch. Then, he also cultivated and planted some Golden Yuan Fruits. At the same time, the Purple Crystal Bamboo, which he hadn't planted for some time, Chu Ning also took out some bamboo rice and cultivated several mu of it. After all, he would need to supply talismans to the Cen family daily. It was better to craft the talisman paper himself to ensure higher quality. Chu Ning also planted some spirit plants that could produce mid-grade talisman paper, making it convenient for him to craft mid-grade low-tier talismans. He also planted some spirit rice for self-sufficiency.

In just half a day, the area outside Chu Ning's cave abode was filled with various spirit herbs and plants, presenting a vibrant and lively scene. Chu Ning then directly went to the Iron Stem Orchid planting area. He first reviewed the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell from the Profound Azure Arts jade slip in his mind. Then, after forming several hand seals, he unleashed a spell technique onto the Iron Stem Orchids. Since this Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell was recorded in this Heaven-tier high-grade cultivation method, he wanted to see what kind of miraculous effects it truly had. And when this spell technique was cast, Chu Ning paused slightly. Because at the same time, a very profound sensation surged into his mind.

**Chapter 151: Those Who Trespass the Cave Abode Shall Die!**

"This Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell can actually control the absorption of spiritual energy attributes?" Chu Ning recalled the process of casting the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell just now. Vaguely, he sensed that at a certain stage in the middle, the five-element spiritual energy in the spell showed signs of differentiation. It seemed that as long as he desired, he could control the spell to absorb only a specific attribute of spiritual energy.

So, Chu Ning once again began forming hand seals. Indeed, the moment he completed the hand seals, the five-element spiritual energy separated. However, when Chu Ning tried to isolate a single type of spiritual energy, he did not succeed. But even so, Chu Ning did not feel discouraged; instead, his eyes lit up. "It really can!" As for the failure, Chu Ning understood that it was merely due to his insufficient spell proficiency. However, for him, this was not a problem. Although this Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell could strip five-element attribute spiritual energy for spirit plants, it was still inherently a wood-attribute biased spell. And with Chu Ning possessing the Yin Wood Spirit Body, cultivating this spell and improving his proficiency, even achieving instant casting, was only a matter of time.

Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately began to cast the spell repeatedly in the spirit field of Iron Stem Orchids. Chu Ning had already cultivated the Azure Wood Spring Radiance spell. Although this Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell was more advanced, with the enhancement of his Yin Wood Spirit Body, his spell proficiency was rapidly increasing. In just half a day, Chu Ning's time to form hand seals had greatly shortened. At this moment, he once again formed hand seals, and as he cast the spell, he flicked his index finger. Instantly, a green light flew from Chu Ning's hand. As this wisp of green light landed on the Iron Stem Orchids, spiritual energy immediately surged around them. Wisps of pure wood-attribute spiritual energy converged towards the Iron Stem Orchids.

"It worked! As expected, starting with wood-attribute spiritual energy is faster!" Chu Ning's face showed joy at the sight. According to the cultivation method of the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell, it was possible to separate all five attributes of spiritual energy for spirit plants to absorb. But Chu Ning, thinking that he was most familiar with wood-attribute spiritual energy, started with that attribute, and indeed succeeded in a short amount of time. Immediately after, Chu Ning continuously tried, and his technique became more and more proficient.

"In about a month, instant casting will be no problem at all. The cultivation difficulty of this spell is much easier than the Blazing Flame Art." A smile appeared on Chu Ning's face at this moment.

Seeing that the sky was about to darken, Chu Ning turned and flew back towards his cave abode. Upon reaching the herb garden, Chu Ning went to check on the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit again. "After adding the fire spirit crystals and with the effect of this spirit-gathering formation, the fire-attribute spiritual energy in this herb garden is noticeably denser. This means that, conversely, the Azure Wood Spring Radiance spell I just cast, even if it's biased towards wood, the wood-attribute spiritual energy still can't keep up."

Chu Ning mumbled, his face devoid of any worry. Instead, he chuckled, "It seems this Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell will come in handy. I can use this Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell to make the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit directly absorb wood-attribute spiritual energy. Coupled with the nourishment from the fire-attribute spiritual energy of the fire spirit crystals, as long as I control it slightly, I can achieve perfect balance." While thinking this, Chu Ning casually cast the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell on each Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit a few times, then returned to his cave chamber.

Lying in the cave chamber with the fire spirit crystals, soaking in the unique hot spring. At this moment, Chu Ning couldn't help but sigh. "Comfortable, this is truly the life of an immortal!" No scheming, no worries about plots. Just cultivating in peace and growing stronger. It was rare for Chu Ning to enjoy such leisure since entering the path of cultivation. He soaked in the hot spring for more than half an hour.

After returning to his cultivation chamber, Chu Ning laid out a pile of items before him, pondering his next cultivation plan. He should be able to cultivate steadily here for a long time, and naturally, he could think about how to further enhance his strength.

"Azure Wood Prime Yang Pills." Chu Ning picked up one bottle of pills. "There are 150 pills here, and I don't know what their efficacy is like. If I take one a day, it can last for about half a year. I also have these Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruits, but eating them now would be a bit of a waste." Chu Ning looked at the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruits filling several jade boxes beside him. What he was thinking about was the Foundation Establishment method recorded in the Fiery Wood Divine Art. He was already at the perfected Qi Refining stage, and the next step was to face Foundation Establishment. The most common method for Foundation Establishment was undoubtedly taking a Foundation Establishment Pill.

However, it was not absolute. Some cultivators could also establish their Foundation by cultivating special techniques or consuming heavenly spiritual fruits. The Fiery Wood Divine Art recorded precisely such a method. By consuming a large number of wood and fire dual-attribute spiritual fruits, one could regulate the body's qi and blood, and magic power to their optimal state, making the wood and fire dual-attribute magic power incredibly pure.

Alternatively, if spiritual herbs were abundant, one could also refine a pill called the Profound Spirit Treasure Pill, which had an even better effect. After continuously using these heavenly spiritual fruits or the Profound Spirit Treasure Pill for a period, and with the help of the Fiery Wood Divine Art's cultivation method, one could directly condense magic power into liquid through the principle of wood generating fire, and successfully establish their Foundation in one go. Using this method, because the magic power would be very abundant during the perfected Qi Refining stage, the cultivator's magic power would be stronger than ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators after successfully establishing their Foundation. Moreover, their Dao base would be of a higher grade compared to those who used Foundation Establishment Pills.

However, this method also mentioned that the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit did not have the effect of strengthening divine sense. Therefore, after Foundation Establishment, the divine sense would not be as strong as other cultivators, especially in the early Foundation Establishment stage, where the gap would be very noticeable. However, the cultivation speed in the later stages of this method was faster, and by the middle and late Foundation Establishment stages, relying on stronger and purer magic power, once the divine sense caught up, one could widen the gap with other Foundation Establishment cultivators. Moreover, this method was very beneficial for condensing a Golden Core. After forming a Golden Core, one's strength would be significantly greater than cultivators of the same rank.

At the same time, this method had another drawback. That is, if there were not enough spiritual fruits like the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit to strengthen one's magic power, and one failed to establish Foundation in one go, then if one were to take a Foundation Establishment Pill at that point, it would be even more difficult to achieve magic power liquefaction due to the overly strong magic power. Foundation Establishment would also be more difficult than for ordinary cultivators. Therefore, although this method existed, it was rarely used due to the difficulty of finding wood and fire dual-attribute spiritual fruits, coupled with various drawbacks.

When Chu Ning first browsed this Foundation Establishment method, he immediately felt that this method was perfectly suited for him. He now possessed so many Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruits, and coupled with his own cultivation of the Divine Sense Refining Art, his divine sense was only stronger, not weaker, than other cultivators. If he could establish his Foundation according to this method, he could not only compensate for his weaknesses but also leverage his strengths. The only thing that worried Chu Ning was that the method's description of the quantity of spiritual fruits was extremely vague. This was also because everyone's physique was different, and the specific quantity could only be determined by one's own perception. This was why Chu Ning was so eager to plant the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruits now. The maturation cycle of this fruit was indeed quite long, and even with various spells to accelerate its growth, he had no idea how much time it would take. And he felt that the spiritual fruits he currently possessed might not be enough.

"Let's try it first." Chu Ning quickly made up his mind. "If the quantity of Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruits is sufficient then, I'll just establish Foundation directly. If not, I'll find another way to acquire a Foundation Establishment Pill."

While thinking this, Chu Ning casually poured out an Azure Wood Prime Yang Pill. Feeling the pure wood and fire dual-attribute spiritual energy contained within, Chu Ning first checked his cultivation progress.

[Fiery Wood Divine Art (Heaven-tier High-grade), First Layer (170/5000)]
[Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, First Scroll, Unbreaking Sinews (738/1500)]
[Divine Sense Refining Art, Second Layer (325/2000)]

Then, Chu Ning directly popped the pill into his mouth and began cultivating the Fiery Wood Divine Art. This cultivation lasted for a full half night. It wasn't until deep into the night that Chu Ning opened his eyes, a hint of surprise flashing within them. "The spiritual energy in this Azure Wood Prime Yang Pill is actually so pure and dense; only half of its medicinal power has been assimilated." Chu Ning then looked at the change in his cultivation proficiency in his mind.

[Fiery Wood Divine Art (Heaven-tier High-grade), First Layer (172/5000)]

With only half of the pill's medicinal power assimilated, the Fiery Wood Divine Art had increased by a full 2 points. This truly brought Chu Ning a pleasant surprise. Calculating this way, if he could take one pill a day for cultivation, he could increase his proficiency by 4 points. Combined with other cultivation, increasing by 5 to 6 points a day would be no problem at all. This would mean he could cultivate the Fiery Wood Divine Art to the first layer in about three years.

However, Chu Ning's brows immediately furrowed; he realized a crucial problem. He only had 150 Azure Wood Prime Yang Pills. Thinking this, Chu Ning's mind stirred again. He took out a jade slip from his storage pouch. This jade slip was something he had obtained from Shang Rui's storage pouch earlier. Since he didn't know much about pills, Chu Ning had left it in his storage pouch without looking at it. But since the other party could refine this pill, perhaps this jade slip contained its formula.

Chu Ning picked up the jade slip and examined it, feeling both pleased and worried. This jade slip indeed contained many pill formulas, including the formula for the Azure Wood Prime Yang Pill. However, as a low-grade second-tier pill, not only were the refining materials of a high grade, but it also had certain requirements for the alchemist's skill. "I've never refined pills before..." Chu Ning sighed slightly and put the jade slip away. He had indeed thought about trying his hand at alchemy just now. But then he immediately abandoned the idea.

Without the Azure Wood Prime Yang Pill, there were naturally other spirit pills and herbs available to advance his cultivation. With no clear path now, trying to directly learn alchemy would be time-consuming and laborious. Moreover, his current cave abode wasn't very convenient for alchemy. Even if Chu Ning hadn't refined pills before, he knew that while fire spirit crystals and other dense fire-attribute items could provide a fire source for alchemy, the most common and widely used method was ground fire. If he wanted to refine pills, he would have to go to another place with ground fire. Furthermore, he would need to find a way to obtain basic alchemy techniques. With that time, he might as well craft more talismans or cultivate with spirit stones. Since he already had the Fire Element Spirit Body, he might later refresh a spirit body similar to talisman crafting but for alchemy. At that time, considering learning alchemy would be much more effective.

Body refinement and divine sense refinement could also return to normal. In terms of body refinement, Chu Ning still had quite a few Golden Orchid Fruits in his storage pouch. After all, Gu Xiaoqing had picked hundreds more for him recently. Although he had used some in the past month, they would last for more than half a year of body refinement without any problem. And within that half a year, new Golden Orchid Fruits would also be cultivated. The only problem was that he seemed to be facing a bottleneck soon. As for divine sense refinement... Chu Ning felt quite helpless; he hadn't found a good way to accelerate it yet. He could only slowly grind away by consuming divine sense through talisman crafting.

"Soul-Stabilizing Pearl." Chu Ning suddenly remembered the Soul-Stabilizing Pearl he had unexpectedly acquired some time ago. "When I have time, I should make a trip to Water Cloud Island."

Putting all his items back into his storage pouch, Chu Ning finished cultivating his Divine Sense Refining Art before finally going to sleep.

The next morning, Chu Ning resumed his usual cultivation routine. He first cultivated the Divine Sense Refining Art, then the Fiery Wood Divine Art, digesting the remaining medicinal power of the Azure Wood Prime Yang Pill that hadn't been fully absorbed the previous night. Immediately after, he took a Golden Orchid Fruit and began cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art. After reaching perfected Qi Refining, the Golden Orchid Fruit still had some effect on Qi Refining, but it wasn't as strong as before. Chu Ning just needed to find a chance later to absorb and digest the medicinal efficacy of this spirit fruit.

Chu Ning then went to the herb garden to check on the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit he had planted yesterday. As expected, he found that the wood and fire dual-attribute spiritual energy on the seedlings was much more balanced. However, the spiritual energy from the fire spirit crystals was indeed dense; compared to the wood-attribute spiritual energy, it was still somewhat lacking.

Seeing this, Chu Ning immediately cast the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell several times on each plant, helping them to gather wood-attribute spiritual energy. He then went to the herb garden and spirit fields, casting spells on different fruits one by one. Finally, he arrived at a small, separated plot of spirit field, his eyes flickering.

Since inadvertently cultivating the Golden Orchid Fruit through hybridization earlier, Chu Ning had been wondering if it was possible to hybridize and cultivate other spirit fruits. He just hadn't had a good opportunity to try before. At this moment, Chu Ning took out two more types of spirit plants from his storage pouch. One was precisely the Iron Stem Orchid. When planting yesterday, Chu Ning had specially set aside twenty plants; ten were for cultivating Iron Orchid Fruit seeds, and these ten Chu Ning planned to use for hybridization experiments. After all, the previous appearance of the Golden Orchid Fruit indicated that the Iron Stem Orchid could be pollinated.

After planting these ten plants, Chu Ning picked up another type of spiritual plant, the Prime Yang Fruit seedling. This seedling was obtained from within the Spirit Domain. Only after reading Shang Rui's jade slip two days ago did he realize that this fruit was one of the main ingredients for refining the Azure Wood Prime Yang Pill. Planting the Prime Yang Fruit and Iron Stem Orchid crisscross in this section, Chu Ning then adjusted the restrictions to cover this area, ensuring that no other spiritual plant pollen could enter.

At this point, Chu Ning began his daily spell cultivation. He could only merge three fireballs with the Blazing Flame Art, still far from truly mastering it. And as for the Fire Phoenix Feather Spear, he hadn't had a chance to try it out before and hadn't fully grasped how to best utilize its power.

As Chu Ning was cultivating, he suddenly heard a voice from outside: "Fellow Daoist Chu, I am Jiang Hongguang. Is it convenient for you to come out for a moment?" Hearing this, Chu Ning stopped cultivating. Sensing that there were no outsiders outside the cave abode, only Jiang Hongguang, his wife, and his sister, he activated the formation control jade slip. The next moment, a passage appeared outside. Chu Ning's voice also rang out, "Fellow Daoist Jiang, please enter the cave abode for a chat."

Jiang Hongguang and the two others outside the cave saw the suddenly appearing passage, exchanged glances, and then walked along the passage. They entered a semi-open stone room facing the lake. Chu Ning was standing in the stone room, looking at the three with a faint smile. "I didn't know Fellow Daoist Jiang was coming, I apologize for not greeting you sooner." Chu Ning cupped his hands, and Jiang Hongguang repeatedly said polite words.

"We thought Fellow Daoist Chu might be busy setting up his cave abode a few days ago, so we didn't disturb you. Today, we figured Fellow Daoist should be nearly done. So, we thought of coming to visit. Our visit is a bit presumptuous, please don't take offense." As Jiang Hongguang finished speaking, the straightforward Jiang Lan immediately said, "Senior Brother Chu, your cave abode is really nice!" Jiang Lan exclaimed with admiration on her face, "You can even see the lake view." As she spoke, her gaze drifted behind her, and she asked curiously, "It's so big behind..."

"Cough!" Jiang Hongguang lightly coughed at this moment and chided, "Xiao Lan, don't be rude." Yu Yuanxiu also lightly tugged at Jiang Lan; it was indeed impolite to inquire about someone else's cave abode layout without permission. Jiang Lan also realized her mistake at this point and lightly stuck out her tongue.

Chu Ning, seeing this, chuckled and said, "It's nothing, I just opened up some spirit fields in the back to plant some spirit plants." Jiang Hongguang then took over, explaining his purpose, "Fellow Daoist Chu, according to our previous agreement, this island will be co-managed by our two families from now on. Although you humbly asked me to continue overseeing the specific management, there are still many cultivators on the island. These days, some cultivators from other islands have also come to visit. Many of them have heard about your impressive display in the Thousand Islands Competition. I intend to arrange a banquet to officially welcome Fellow Daoist. What do you think?"

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning immediately waved his hand, "Fellow Daoist Jiang, there's no need for such an elaborate arrangement. I'm used to living alone and don't like lively gatherings, so the banquet isn't necessary. As for the other fellow daoists on the island, I don't have much interaction with them for now. Now that they know my cave abode is here, and with the formation, there won't be any accidental intrusions or misunderstandings, so there's no great need to meet."

Chu Ning refused very directly. He wished that everyone in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands would forget his performance in the Thousand Islands Competition. At this moment, why would he want to meet these people? If these cultivators tried to forge relationships or anything similar, it would be endlessly troublesome.

Before Jiang Hongguang could speak, Chu Ning continued, "Fellow Daoist Jiang, I stand by my words: everything on the island remains as before, you manage it as you should. As for those visiting fellow daoists, just tell them I'm in seclusion cultivating and not receiving guests for the time being."

Seeing Chu Ning's firm stance, Jiang Hongguang naturally found it difficult to say anything more. So, he took out a metal token from his storage pouch and handed it to Chu Ning, saying, "In that case, this identity token is for Fellow Daoist. From now on, when you display this token on the island, everyone will recognize you. At the same time, this identity token is also uniformly issued by the Thousand Islands Alliance to island masters in the Qi Refining stage.

If Fellow Daoist encounters any danger within these Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands, as long as you inject spiritual power, the Thousand Islands Alliance's enforcement team will sense it and appear." At this point, Jiang Hongguang paused before continuing, "However, their speed is still somewhat lacking, and they generally won't intervene in minor disputes." Chu Ning roughly understood what he meant, didn't think much of it, and reached out to take it.

Jiang Hongguang then continued, "Since Fellow Daoist Chu is dedicated to the Dao, we won't disturb you further. From now on, I will come to split the harvest with you once every six months."

"Harvest?" Chu Ning was slightly taken aback upon hearing this. He hadn't heard Jiang Hongguang mention any harvest here before. Jiang Hongguang smiled and said, "I hadn't informed Fellow Daoist about this before."

"Although this island previously only had a first-tier spirit vein, it still had quite a few cultivators because of its considerable area. Most of these cultivators have planted some spirit fields, and they have to submit a harvest to the island every six months, totaling about 1800 spirit stones. Except for the 30% tribute submitted to the Thousand Islands Alliance, the rest belongs to us." Chu Ning finally realized what he meant.

Jiang Hongguang's smile grew wider. "Thanks to Fellow Daoist's efforts, in the Thousand Islands Competition, you defeated Tranquil Spring Island and Stele Forest Island, so our Flying Rainbow Island doesn't have to pay tribute. Therefore, our income will be significantly higher for the next few years." Speaking of this, Jiang Hongguang tentatively asked, "Fellow Daoist, what do you think is a suitable way to divide this harvest?"

A harvest of nearly two thousand spirit stones every six months wasn't particularly small, but Chu Ning didn't pay much attention to it, as his talisman crafting income could exceed that in half a month. However, Chu Ning also understood that there was a limit to being modest. So, after a slight deliberation, he said, "How about a fifty-fifty split?"

"Of course!" Jiang Hongguang immediately agreed. Clearly, Chu Ning's proposed split was already very satisfactory to him. Although nominally their family would earn 20% less than before Chu Ning arrived, their family now also had a second-tier spirit vein. While this spirit vein wasn't as large as the first-tier one, its income exceeded that of the first-tier spirit vein.

After Jiang Hongguang and his family happily departed, Chu Ning once again immersed himself in cultivation. He took a Golden Orchid Fruit and began his daily cultivation of the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art.

[Fiery Wood Divine Art (Heaven-tier High-grade), First Layer (174/5000)]
[Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, First Scroll, Unbreaking Sinews (740/1500)]
[Divine Sense Refining Art, Second Layer (325/2000)]

"If it's like the previous cultivation of the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, when proficiency reaches half, I'll face a bottleneck. I won't be able to improve through ordinary spirit fruits or cultivation. I wonder if this 'Unbreaking Sinews' is the same." Chu Ning pondered slightly, feeling a hint of melancholy. After all, he currently had no suitable heavenly spiritual fruits for body refinement, though he still had three Seven-Star Spirit Fruits left. However, during the breakthrough of the "Indestructible Bones" bottleneck, the effect of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit had already greatly diminished. It was hard to say for the breakthrough of "Unbreaking Sinews."

Thinking this, Chu Ning shook his head, but his cultivation of the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art did not stop. After several consecutive days of cultivation, the proficiency of "Unbreaking Sinews" in the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art finally reached 750. When Chu Ning cultivated with Golden Orchid Fruits for another two days, as expected, the cultivation of "Unbreaking Sinews" remained stagnant.

"Another bottleneck!" In the cultivation chamber, Chu Ning held a Seven-Star Spirit Fruit and then tossed it into his mouth. At this moment, he only had this item, so he could only give it a try. After consuming three consecutively, looking at the change in proficiency, Chu Ning's expression was incredibly complex.

[Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, First Scroll, Unbreaking Sinews (930/1500)]

He had originally thought that the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit's effect on bottleneck breakthroughs was just less obvious. He never expected the effect to be so greatly diminished. After three fruits, the proficiency only increased by 180 points. And at this moment, all the items he had that could break bottlenecks were used up. It seemed that this path of body refinement was about to encounter a major bottleneck.

Shaking his head, he then walked out of the cultivation chamber and into the herb garden outside. Entering the herb garden where the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit was planted, Chu Ning first cast the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell, then began cultivating the Fiery Wood Divine Art. The hidden talent of the Yin Wood Spirit Body was described as being able to convert and absorb the spiritual energy gathered by wood-attribute spells used on spirit plants. Although the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell could strip away five-element spiritual energy, it was also wood-attribute, so Chu Ning naturally wanted to give it a try.

At the same time, Chu Ning had another question. What if the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell he stripped was not wood-attribute spiritual energy, but fire-attribute spiritual energy? For example, if he cultivated it to be more proficient later, he could strip wood and fire dual-attribute spiritual energy to help the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit grow.

All of this required Chu Ning to slowly explore.

"The Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell can indeed be used for cultivation!" Half an hour later, Chu Ning opened his eyes in the herb garden, his gaze filled with joy. However, he could only absorb wood-attribute spiritual energy. He couldn't absorb the fire-attribute spiritual energy that the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit absorbed from the fire spirit crystals. As for his other speculation, he could only try it after the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell was cultivated to be more proficient.

In the following time, Chu Ning cultivated spirit plants, crafted talismans, and cultivated every day. Aside from the slight distress concerning body refinement, he lived a very leisurely life. Every ten days, Chu Ning would leave Flying Rainbow Island once, taking talismans to trade with Cen Workshop. He, of course, used an illusion spell to change his appearance to match the portrait he had given Cen Ziqin. Cen Ziqin also didn't personally come; each time, she sent a trusted manager to collect the talismans and hand over spirit stones to Chu Ning.

Six months passed in such stable cultivation. During these six months, Chu Ning took one Azure Wood Prime Yang Pill and one Golden Orchid Fruit daily, in addition to crafting talismans and analyzing talisman origins to cultivate his divine sense. Basically, the Fiery Wood Divine Art could increase by 5 points daily, and the Divine Sense Refining Art could increase by 2 points. The "Unbreaking Sinews" in the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art wasn't completely stagnant either; after a very long period of exploration, Chu Ning finally discovered that although he couldn't break through major bottlenecks, if he persisted in taking Golden Orchid Fruits and cultivating, he could still increase it by 1 point every ten days. This speed was painstakingly slow. But Chu Ning, lacking other treasures, still chose to do so.

Progress in spells was also good. The Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell had already been cultivated to instant casting, and he could now strip fire-attribute spiritual energy. Chu Ning's previous deduction was also fully confirmed: when he used the Profound Azure Spring Radiance spell on the Blazing Wood Twin Life Fruit to absorb both wood and fire attribute spiritual energy, Chu Ning could then absorb both types of spiritual energy when cultivating the Fiery Wood Divine Art. This was precisely the main reason why Chu Ning's Fiery Wood Divine Art could maintain a daily proficiency increase of 5 points. As for the Blazing Flame Art, he was already able to merge 10 fireballs. Chu Ning had also completely understood the divine ability of the Fire Phoenix Feather Spear.

At this point, Chu Ning was very confident that even without the black dagger, he could easily kill a perfected Qi Refining cultivator of the same rank. He could even put up a fight against a Foundation Establishment cultivator. His overall strength had still improved significantly. However, in terms of talisman crafting, he encountered a small bottleneck.

This afternoon, Chu Ning was crafting talismans in his cave abode's cultivation chamber. However, his brow remained furrowed. "This mid-grade low-tier talisman, logically, I should have fully mastered it, but why is its success rate still not improving?" For low-grade talismans, Chu Ning first learned the Profound Water Spirit Talisman by analyzing its talisman origin. After breaking through to perfected Qi Refining, he also tried another low-grade attack talisman from the Profound Talisman Treasure Scroll. However, after half a year, no matter how much Chu Ning practiced, the success rate remained around 50%. This success rate would naturally be quite good for an ordinary talisman master. But for Chu Ning, whose basic talisman crafting success rate used to reach 70-80%, he was not satisfied.

At first, Chu Ning thought it was simply because the success rate for mid-grade low-tier talismans inherently improved slowly, due to his lack of practice. But at this moment, Chu Ning vaguely felt that this was not the case. Picking up his talisman brush again, Chu Ning's divine sense did not just focus on the brush tip and talisman patterns. Instead, he meticulously used his divine sense to perceive the entire process, from injecting magic power to completing the stroke. After crafting ten more talismans this way, he stopped and looked at the mid-grade talisman brush in his hand. After this period of repeated contemplation, he felt that the problem might lie with the talisman brush itself. A mid-grade talisman brush was essentially equivalent to the grade of a mid-grade artifact. And within mid-grade talisman brushes, there were also differences in quality. This brush was given to him by Liao Yunming of the Spirit Talisman Pavilion when he first learned talisman crafting, so its quality probably wasn't exceptional. The mid-grade low-tier talismans Chu Ning was now crafting were equivalent to the level of ordinary spells cast by perfected Qi Refining or early Foundation Establishment cultivators. Therefore, Chu Ning suspected that the quality of this brush could no longer keep up with his talisman crafting level. Chu Ning had just deliberately used his divine sense to sense it more, and indeed found that because the requirements for injecting magic power were higher, occasional fluctuations in magic power would occur.

"It seems it's time to get a higher quality talisman brush," Chu Ning mumbled softly. However, thinking that the art of talisman crafting was not particularly flourishing within the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands, he was somewhat worried about whether he could still obtain a higher-grade talisman brush. Putting away his talisman crafting tools, Chu Ning slowly walked out to the scenic area outside his cave abode, where his reclining chair was. He planned to enjoy some leisure time watching the sunset.

As the sun slowly sank from the horizon, the sky gradually darkened. It was almost completely dark in another half an hour. At this moment, Chu Ning, who was gently swaying in his reclining chair, suddenly stiffened. He instantly stood up. Far in the distance, several streaks of light were rapidly rushing towards his direction.

"Someone is flying through the air towards this island?" Chu Ning's brows slightly furrowed upon seeing this. This situation was truly rare. In the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands, because almost every island had a teleportation array, it was rare to see cultivators flying over the lake surface. And when Chu Ning focused his gaze, his brows couldn't help but furrow slightly.

At this moment, several streaks of light had already flown into the island's range, one after another. So he could see clearly. There were two groups of people, one in front and one behind. The foremost was only a yellow-faced middle-aged cultivator, riding on an artifact. His posture seemed unstable, indicating he was somewhat injured. Following closely behind were two others, one a square-faced cultivator, and the other wearing a gray robe. Although Chu Ning couldn't fully sense them yet, they all appeared to be Foundation Establishment cultivators.

The first person, upon seeing Chu Ning's formation here, seemed to notice something. He flew directly towards this location. Before Chu Ning could speak, this person directly landed in front of the mountain. Then, whether this person understood some formation techniques or used some other method, he actually charged directly into Chu Ning's formation. However, he was quickly trapped in the outermost layer by the formation. The few people chasing behind stopped immediately when they saw him disappear. The two exchanged glances, and one of them spoke loudly, "Whose cave abode is this, Fellow Daoist? We were chasing an opponent just now. This person intruded into your formation restriction. We hope Fellow Daoist can help send him out."

Hearing this voice, Chu Ning responded in a deep voice, "I will open the restriction now. The senior who intruded earlier, please exit the cave abode. I have no intention of getting involved in your disputes." As Chu Ning spoke, he activated the jade talisman, opening the restriction that had trapped the cultivator. Of course, the outside was still impassable at this point. However, the person inside could still leave if they wished.

But what made Chu Ning frown again was that this person did not leave. Instead, he said, "Fellow Daoist inside, I see this formation is quite extraordinary, and these two won't be able to break it for a while. If you just let me hide in here, I will greatly repay you."

Because of the formation restriction, the people outside naturally could not hear this person speaking. But the square-faced cultivator seemed to anticipate what this person would say, and at this moment, continued, "Fellow Daoist, we are from the Thousand Islands Alliance. This person is a rogue cultivator who stole something from our Thousand Islands Alliance and escaped here."

Chu Ning heard this, and his figure flashed several times, arriving near the cultivator who had first intruded into the formation. He was preparing to forcibly escort the person out. However, his figure had just appeared when this Foundation Establishment cultivator's figure flashed, and he reached out to grab Chu Ning. The person's movement was extremely fast, so much so that even Chu Ning didn't have time to re-hide himself within the formation.

Seeing this, Chu Ning instinctively activated his defenses and simultaneously launched a punch. This was, after all, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, so Chu Ning held nothing back in his attack. The flames on his Blazing Bracelet ignited, combined with the Heavenly Gang Fist.

"Bang!" The fiery fist, amidst the other party's already pale face and surprised expression, directly struck the cultivator. The next moment, this Foundation Establishment cultivator, who was already heavily injured and unprepared, directly collapsed to the ground. He was already seriously wounded, and under Chu Ning's single punch, he actually died.

Chu Ning was slightly stunned at the sight, and at the same time, couldn't help but feel a headache. He had punched purely out of self-preservation and instinct. How could he have known that the other party's injuries were so severe that he couldn't even withstand a punch from Chu Ning that wasn't even combined with his Shocking Thunder Steps? This Foundation Establishment cultivator's background was unknown. Although the people outside couldn't see Chu Ning personally kill this person through the formation, the fact that he entered alive and exited dead seemed difficult to explain.

Thinking this, Chu Ning sighed slightly. However, he still directly threw the corpse out of the cave using object manipulation. "Seniors outside, this senior's injuries were too severe, and he couldn't hold on, so he has passed away."

The two Foundation Establishment cultivators outside took the corpse, both slightly stunned. Then, their faces showed joy, and they immediately began searching for something on the cultivator's body. At the same time, they also checked his storage pouch. However, after they looked through it, their expressions turned somewhat unpleasant. The two exchanged glances, and then a square-faced cultivator, about forty years old, spoke, "Fellow Daoist inside, this person does not have what we are looking for on him. We suspect he hid it inside Fellow Daoist's cave abode. Please open the formation, and we will come in to search."

Chu Ning, who had originally thought the matter was over, was slightly taken aback. He used his divine sense to briefly scan the area where the cultivator had been, but found nothing. He immediately said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoists, please leave. This person did not hide anything here with me." As Chu Ning finished speaking, the square-faced cultivator outside snorted coldly, "Don't think we know nothing about Flying Rainbow Island. You are merely a Qi Refining cultivator. We were being polite by calling you Fellow Daoist. Junior, quickly open the formation!"

Chu Ning coldly glanced outside. He now understood that this matter was probably not going to end peacefully today. Even if he opened the cave abode and let them search, they wouldn't stop if they didn't find anything. They would probably try to search him. Furthermore, letting them search his cave abode would be a great humiliation, which Chu Ning could hardly bear.

"I'll say it again, open the formation, otherwise, don't blame us for forcing our way in. Do you really think a Qi Refining cultivator setting up a formation can stop us?" The square-faced Foundation Establishment cultivator's face was filled with a cold sneer. Chu Ning remained silent upon hearing this. Then, a barely audible voice echoed within the cave abode.

"Those who trespass the cave abode shall die!"

At the same time, the two outside, hearing Chu Ning's continued silence, the square-faced cultivator shouted, "Do it!" As his words fell, the two joined forces, simultaneously activating their artifacts, and attacked the formation covering Chu Ning's cave abode.
