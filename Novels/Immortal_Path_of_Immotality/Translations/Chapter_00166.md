# Chapter 165: The Gongsun Family

Three months later, the temporary headquarters of the Demonic Path in the Eastern Sea issued a general mobilization order for war.  

All logistics cultivators and wounded soldiers recuperating in the rear areas of the Eastern Sea were to immediately proceed to the frontlines in the inland Luosong Mountain Range without delay.  

This meant that even Lin Shan and the other Altar Purifiers had no choice but to answer the summons, being dragged into the war effort like ducks to a slaughterhouse.  

Unlike the situation a decade ago, when the Demonic Path had been at the height of its power with countless experts, their forces were now stretched thin. Every available hand was being pressed into service.  

Lin Shan’s orders were to report to the newly reorganized Ninth Division in the central war zone. The division’s commander was none other than his old superior, Yan Yuanchun—a small mercy that showed the Demonic Path still had some consideration for its members.  

After several months of cultivation, Lin Shan had finally stabilized his mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, confident that he could hold his own in battle.

Half a month later, a passenger flying vessel quietly traversed the heartland of the Eastern Song Dynasty.  

Inside the spacious cabin, Lin Shan sat cross-legged in a corner, quietly meditating. The vessel was packed with nearly a thousand Demonic Path cultivators, two-thirds of whom were old, weak, injured, or otherwise unfit for combat.  

These were originally logistics personnel or wounded soldiers, but with the frontlines in dire straits, they had been called up as reinforcements. Some clustered in small groups, exchanging rumors and news they had gathered.  

"My brother-in-law from the sect said the Luosong Mountain front has become a meat grinder—major battles every three days, minor skirmishes every two."  

"Exactly! My senior brother at the front wrote that the Righteous Path’s reinforcements from the northwest and southwest are endless. Our Demonic Alliance is probably—"  

"Your news is outdated. I heard that ten days ago, two of the dozen main camps at the Luosong Mountain entrances were breached. Now we’re just patching holes!"  

"Rumor has it that many of the surrendered sects and families in the Eastern Song are wavering. These fence-sitters might become a hidden threat in our rear!"  

"I’ve heard whispers that the Yellow Springs Sect from the Great Yan and the Rain Pavilion from the Southern Sea are secretly negotiating a withdrawal. Once they’re gone, the Dry Cloud Pavilion and Beast Taming Valley will join the fight!"  

"Does that mean the Righteous Path’s Nascent Soul cultivators will soon number in the double digits?"  

The cabin buzzed with speculation. It was hard to tell which rumors held water, but the vivid descriptions made even Lin Shan’s heart race.  

The Demonic Path’s three sects had held their ground in the Luosong Mountains precisely because the Righteous Path’s two other major sects were tied down by their allies. This allowed them to wait for reinforcements from the main sect in the State of Lu, which would restore their overwhelming advantage against the Violet Thunder Sect.  

But all this hinged on a delicate balance. If the reinforcements didn’t arrive in time, and the allies from the north and south truly withdrew, how could they continue the fight?  

Even if the rumors were just smokescreens, the breaches in the frontlines—though later patched—might have allowed some enemies to slip through. These infiltrators could now be stirring trouble in the Demonic Path’s rear, fanning the flames of dissent.  

Lin Shan’s heart grew heavy. The situation was far worse than before. With the Demonic Path weakened, it was uncertain whether their northern and southern allies would continue their support. The surrendered factions in the Eastern Song’s heartland might indeed start reconsidering their allegiances.  

No wonder his clansman, Lin Fan, had gone to great lengths to send him a message urging him to abandon the Demonic Path. The Righteous Path must have inside information, confident that prolonging the war would work in their favor.

The flying vessel crossed the skies and arrived at the Luosong Mountain front, landing steadily beside the camp at the edge of the Poison Burial Gorge.  

Surprisingly, the camp was eerily quiet. There was none of the usual oppressive atmosphere of war, nor were there large numbers of elite Demonic Path cultivators—just a sparse scattering of patrolling soldiers.  

A vulture perched on the watchtower at the camp’s entrance stared coldly and spoke in a human voice:  

"Halt! Identify yourselves!"  

The thousand Demonic Path cultivators disembarked and lined up at the camp’s entrance for inspection. Two humanoid puppets stood at the front, their eyes emitting white beams—some kind of detection method to verify the authenticity of identity tokens and individuals.  

Lin Shan didn’t cut in line. He patiently underwent the inspection and was cleared to enter the camp.  

Inside, over twenty people had been waiting for him. The moment he stepped in, they rushed over, clinging to him like lifelines.  

"Envoy! You’re finally out of seclusion! We missed you so much!"  

"Without you, we’ve been lost—barely surviving every mission!"  

"Only under your leadership do we feel safe. These past few years, we almost died so many times!"  

"I thought I’d never see you again—wait, no! I mean, it’s great that you’re alive! Or rather, that I’m alive—"  

Lin Shan was initially pleased to see his old subordinates, but one idiot’s bumbling words made him feel like he’d swallowed a fly. He shot the man a sidelong glance, recalling that this was the same eccentric who had once survived alone in the Poison Mist Forest for three or four days during their crossing of the Poison Burial Gorge.  

"Eh? You’ve actually reached the peak of Qi Refinement’s ninth layer?"  

When Lin Shan had first taken command in the Eastern Sea, he’d had over a hundred subordinates. Now, only these twenty-plus remained—a sobering attrition rate.  

After a decade of trials, most of his men had used their merit points to advance to the late stages of Qi Refinement. A few standouts, like this fellow, had reached the peak of the ninth layer and were ready to attempt Foundation Establishment.  

"Not bad... Wait, where’s the Red-Faced Monk?"  

He remembered the Red-Faced Monk had also been at the peak of Qi Refinement, but the man was nowhere to be seen.  

His right-hand man, Old Man Zhong, stepped forward hesitantly to explain.  

"Ten years ago at the Bianliang Camp, a Red-Faced Monk arrived with your message talisman. I assigned him accordingly. But after the cataclysmic battle at the Violet Thunder Sect, he suddenly left the team and vanished."  

It was a strange affair. The battle at the Violet Thunder Sect had been devastating for the Demonic Alliance.  

Lin Shan’s squad, though originally a band of slippery opportunists, had somehow managed to escape unscathed under Old Man Zhong’s leadership. It spoke volumes about their survival skills.  

As for the Red-Faced Monk, for reasons unknown, he had chosen to leave the team at that critical juncture. His current whereabouts—and whether he was even alive—remained a mystery.  

Lin Shan sighed. He’d valued the man’s silver tongue, thinking he might prove useful if Lin Shan ever visited the Joyous Sect in the Pilo Desert. But life and death were part of the natural order, and he had learned not to dwell on such losses.  

After catching up with his men, Lin Shan entered the central command tent alone.  

Inside, three Golden Core Protectors of the Black Lotus Sect were deep in discussion. Seeing that Protector Yan was occupied, Lin Shan waited quietly by the side.  

Eventually, the other two Protectors left, leaving only Yan Yuanchun and Lin Shan.  

"Greetings, Protector. Here are my transfer orders."  

Lin Shan handed over the dispatch from the Eastern Sea headquarters. Yan Yuanchun merely tucked it away without much scrutiny.  

"You’ve got good timing, avoiding the bloodbath at the Violet Thunder Sect. Pity about Yu Chun, Huan Chun, and Yun Chun, though..."  

Yan Yuanchun had lost most of her direct subordinates at the Violet Thunder Sect, including three of her Foundation Establishment female disciples—painstakingly nurtured protégés from Yichuan. The loss weighed heavily on her.  

Not knowing how to console her, Lin Shan changed the subject. "What about Luan Chun?"  

At the mention of Luan Chun, Yan Yuanchun’s expression softened with affection. "She’s fine. I’ve sent her on a mission deep in the rear."  

Then, with a teasing glint in her eye, she added, "Why the special concern for her?"  

Lin Shan paused, then chuckled lightly. "Just a fellow disciple’s courtesy inquiry."  

Yan Yuanchun studied him carefully. Seeing no shyness or evasion in his clear gaze, she sighed inwardly. She had half-hoped to matchmake Lin Shan and Luan Chun. The young man was talented and reliable, and she knew him well after all these years.  

With the war taking a dire turn, she couldn’t protect Luan Chun forever. Entrusting her to Lin Shan would have been ideal. But the boy showed no interest—if anything, he seemed to carry an air of lofty ambition.  

Was her beloved disciple not good enough for him?  

After a brief contemplation, Yan Yuanchun let the matter drop.  

Lin Shan seized the moment to voice his confusion about the camp’s unusual quiet.  

"Protector, I heard the Luosong front is supposed to be a constant battleground. Why is it so deserted here?"  

Yan Yuanchun explained that several Righteous Path teams had indeed emerged from the Poison Burial Gorge recently, but the camp’s defenders—rested and ready—had repelled them.  

Later, the Righteous Path had breached the northern and southern fronts (under the Hundred Ghosts Sect and Blood River Hall’s jurisdictions), stretching their defenses thin. With the Poison Burial Gorge being a natural stronghold, most elites had been redeployed to support the flanks, leaving only the Eastern Sea’s old and infirm to hold the gorge.  

The fiercest fighting was now concentrated at Chaisang Harbor and Eastgate Pass, where land and naval battles raged daily—the infamous "meat grinder" of current rumors.  

"Since you’re here, I have a mission for you."  

Yan Yuanchun unfurled a map of the Song Dynasty, her eyes tracing its mountains and plains.  

"The Poison Burial Gorge is quiet, but the Eastern Song’s heartland is our rear. Many minor sects and families there are double-dealing, wavering whenever the frontlines falter."  

"New intelligence suggests some have secretly contacted the Righteous Path. For such fence-sitters, the Demonic Path shows no mercy. If confirmed, there’s only one punishment: annihilation!"  

Lin Shan shivered at Protector Yan’s icy tone. But upon reflection, he understood. With the Demonic Path at a disadvantage, harsh measures were necessary to make an example and deter further betrayal.  

"Others will handle stabilizing the rear. Right now, the frontlines are desperate for reinforcements. Your mission is to secure additional troops."  

Yan Yuanchun turned to him solemnly.  

"In Shangdang Commandery, there’s a cultivation family—the Gongsun. A thousand years ago, they were a subordinate family of our Demonic Path, founded by a Black Lotus true disciple. They’re among the more trustworthy families. You’ll deliver a mobilization order and bring back their forces."  

"I’ll give you the new United Command’s dispatch. If you succeed, return with the troops. If not... stay there and observe. Your presence here won’t make a difference anyway."  

Lin Shan stiffened slightly, reading between the lines:  

If he couldn’t bring reinforcements, he should remain in Shangdang—a tacit permission to avoid the frontlines without drawing criticism.  

Clearly, Protector Yan was pessimistic about the war’s outcome and was already planning escape routes for her subordinates. Luan Chun’s reassignment likely followed the same logic.  

"Understood. Thank you, Protector."  

Lin Shan spent another half-hour discussing cultivation with Yan Yuanchun, benefiting greatly from her Golden Core-level insights.  

As he left the tent, the midsummer sun scorched the earth. Crows cawed incessantly outside the camp, and the Poison Burial Gorge loomed in the distance, shrouded in mist. An inexplicable heaviness settled over his heart.  

He gathered his men to accompany him on the mission to the Gongsun family. They caught on immediately—a trip to the rear was far preferable to the frontlines—and celebrated accordingly.  

After brief preparations, the group set out the next day aboard the Descending Cloud Banner, flying northward.  

---  

Meanwhile, in a cave within the Eastern Song’s hills, a group of Righteous Path cultivators huddled in discussion. Sentries kept watch outside.  

"The general offensive begins in two months. The Dry Cloud Pavilion and Beast Taming Valley will join the assault."  

"Indeed, our Righteous Path’s full counterattack is imminent. A pity I won’t witness that grand spectacle firsthand!"  

"Elder Mang, don’t fret. Stirring chaos in the Demonic Path’s rear may yet kindle a spark that sets the plains ablaze."  

"Well said! The Eastern Song’s sects and families have suffered under the Demonic Path. Showing them goodwill will surely win them back."  

"From our earlier probes, over thirty factions are potential defectors: the Jiangdong Withered Glory Pagoda, Lingnan Ancient Sage Village, Huaibei Golden Jade Sect, Yanmen Five Suns Palace, Shangdang Gongsun Family..."  

---  

Five days later, Lin Shan’s group arrived leisurely at the Gongsun family’s estate, riding a cloud.
